        "Q: Good morning, Isaac.",
        "A: Good morning, Joan.",
        "Q: It\u2019s nice to see you.",
        "A: Nice to see you, too.",
        "Q: Isaac, what was your name when you were born?",
        "A: Isaac David Nehama. In -- in Greece, or in Sephardic communities, the middle name 1s\nalways the patronimic, the father\u2019s name.",
        "Q: Which is different in the Ashkenazi tradition, which --",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: -- you, it\u2019s never that.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Now, you had a nickname, didn\u2019t you?",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t a n-nickname, it was the diminutive, which is often done in -- in Greece, to\ntake the ending of the name itself. So Isaac 1s Saaco, and it got shortened to Zako, and\nthat\u2019s how I was known by my parents, my brothers, and friends.",
        "Q: And this was when you were very -- as -- as a young kid, I gather, yes?",
        "A: Yes, I -- that\u2019s right, but it remained like that, and today my wife addresses me as Zako.",
        "Q: But no one else does?",
        "A: I think one friend that I met in California. I told him about that, and he still calls me\nZako.",
        "Q: Now when were you born?",
        "A: I was born in 1926, April 29.",
        "Q: And you were born where?",
        "A: I was born in Athens. My parents had migrated from the city where they were born,\nwhich was at that time, when they were born, called Monastir, part of the Ottoman\nEmpire. And after the first World War, they left because the conditions there were\nterrible, and ended up in Athens, and that\u2019s where I was born.",
        "Q: L-Let\u2019s -- let\u2019s talk a little bit about what it was like to grow up in Greece, and what it\nwas like in particular in your family.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: First let\u2019s talk about your parents, and then we\u2019ll go to your two siblings.",
        "A: All right.",
        "Q: T-Tell me about your father and your mother.",
        "A: My father was -- when I began to understand the situation, my father was an accountant.\nHe was th-the chief accountant of a very large company that dealt in -- in importing\ntextiles, and selling wholesale. My father was lame because he had polio as a young\nchild, and essentially almost a club foot, which had then to be corrected in an operation\nthat took place in Paris, when he was a teenager. And he stayed on in Paris, and did --\nstudied accounting. My mother was a -- a teacher in a school in the town where she was\nborn, in an Alliance Frangaise school. So, because they both very proficient in French,\nthen it was compulsory to speak French at home. Between themselves, my parents talked\nin Ladino, or Judeo-Espagnol, which I had to do also with my maternal grandmother,\nwhen she visited us, because that\u2019s the only language she knew.",
        "Q: Now, did your parents come from a wealthy background, I mean, your father had been in\nParis, and having medical care there, as well as studying, or -- or not?",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s interesting that you ask that, because it\u2019s now that I\u2019m finding out, through\nsome of the work that I have done for the -- for the Holocaust Museum, about my\nparent\u2019s backgrounds, and very slowly I -- I have found out, that especially in my father\u2019s\nfamily, they were very prominent. Both, I think, in financially, but also as leaders of a\ncommunity. My great-grandfather, Solomon, was one of the first 13 signatures in 1864 to\nopen Alliance-Frangaise schools in Monastir. My grandfather Isaac, whose name I bear,\nwhich was another tradition in Sephardic homes, was a president of the Jewish\ncommunity of Monastir. And my Uncle Solomon, who was my father\u2019s eldest brother,\nwas president of the Joint Distribution Committee. So, apparently they must have been a\nvery prominent family. My grandfather -- and I still remember a letterhead, it was in\nseveral languages, but the one that I remember was in French, fournisseur de l\u2019arm\u00e9e\nturque. And we see he used to s -- to sell goods to the Turkish army. Grain, and other\nmaterial, not -- not weapons, but -- so they had been in that business for a long time.",
        "Q: So wha -- it\u2019s -- 1 -- why did it take you so long to find out, did your father not tell you\nabout the history of the family, or --",
        "A: He -- you see, you have to remember, I think in Europe generally, avi was something\npeculiar to my family, parents don\u2019t exchange a lot of confidences when you\u2019re young.\nThings immediately change, magically, when you reach manhood, or adulthood in -- in\nEurope. And then you become a friend, and things then open up. You see, I left Greece\nwhen I was 19, to come to study in United States, so I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to\nengage my father in reminiscences, so my brother -- younger brother, who stayed with\nmy father until my father\u2019s death in Greece, he knows much more sometimes, about\nstories that my father told him, than I had an opportunity to do -- to do.",
        "Q: So tell me what sort of a person your father was as a father to you. Wer -- were -- did you\n-- would you have considered yourself close, prior to the war?",
        "A: Yes, well not really close, again, because of what I mentioned before. We were not\ndistant, but my father was a -- a very even tempered individual. He encouraged me in my\nstudies. He insisted to review my homework even, I think, when I first went to high\nschool in the gimnasium. There were things that he had no notion at all, whether\nmathematics, or physics, and yet he insisted to review the homework. I -- by contrast, my\nmother was a -- a very demanding person. Having been a teacher, and also\ntemperamentally, she asked of me to do things -- to excel, to study my f -- French\nlessons, to practice -- at one time I started learning the violin at the Athens Conservatory,\nbut the war put an end to all of that, so I didn\u2019t pursue that instrument. So there was\nalways a contrast. My -- my mother was much more demanding individual, my father a\nmuch more even tempered, but still expecting things.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And -- and would you say that as a child you felt close t -- though they weren\u2019t\nsharing information with you --",
        "A: Right, yeah.",
        "Q: -- were you able to come to them with difficulties, or -- or were -- would you talk to your\nfriends about those kinds of things?",
        "A: No, I would -- up to a certain point, then ev -- eventually I would have to learn to talk to\nmy -- my parents, but I would talk to my mother, because I lived all day long with -- with\nher, and it was almost a natural thing for me, the first person to think of telling her about\nsomething.",
        "Q: And it would be her.",
        "A: It\u2019d be her, yes.",
        "Q: Did you go -- y -- s -- when we wer -- drove here in the car, you talked about taking your\nkids for a walk. Did your father and mother go for walks with you, and -- and do things\nwith you?",
        "A: My father did not, because -- as I mentioned before, because of his lameness. My mother\ntook me about four or five blocks away from -- from the house where we -- I grew up.\nThere was a little park, and then she would take us, I\u2019m sure when I was very young.\nLater on, when I reached the age of 10, I then started taking my younger brother on\nwalks. Another thing that I remember we did very frequently was -- as I said, my\nmaternal grandmother visited us twice a week, she lived with a -- an aunt. And it was\nreally for an able person, it was let\u2019s say, a 15 minute walk. But for my grandmother, it\nturn out to be maybe a half an hour, or a little bit more, because she was older, and she\nwould have to rest from time to time. And the little park was on the way, so we\u2019re -- I\nwould go to the keropper, and we would eventually reach the park, sit at the bench, let\nher rest. And my mother would come sometimes together.",
        "Q: When di -- because I didn\u2019t know this, when -- when did you start violin lessons?",
        "A: Oh, I started violin lessons when I was eight or nine years old, maybe 10. But I started\nschool when I was four, the reason being that that was when my second brother was born,\nSamuel. And I don\u2019t know, perhaps I was too much, and my mother needed to have free\ntime to care for my brother. She knew the teacher in the Jewish school, which was around\nthe corner from my house. So she asked her if sh -- I could go there for a few hours, just\nsort of to be kept, and not to interfere with the house affairs. But apparently I must have\npicked up, because there from then on, I continued, and I went to -- to school. But I think\nusually at the end of a school year, then my actual age would be apparent to the teachers.\nSo the first six years of primary school -- at the time I went to school it was six years\nprimary, six years high school, or gimnasium. For the first seven years of sc -- of\nschooling, I changed school every year, because -- for the reason I mentioned before,\nthey would find out from my behavior I was a lot younger than -- than my grade, and\nthey would wo -- washme -- wanted me to -- to remain for another year in the same\ngrade, but of course, my parents did not want to do that, and I continued.",
        "Q: And your violin came in the midst of this?",
        "A: The violin came -- yes, I started with a -- a private teacher, who lived a few blocks from\nmy house, for about a year. And then my parents decided that I ought to go to the\nconservatory, and I had to give an audition, and I was then admitted, and I started\nstudying. I have -- I have to change, because now I remember, I started in 1939, so I was\nabout 13 then. The reason I\u2019m saying that now, in recollection, was because I was at the\nconservatory for two years -- two and a half years, and then after the -- the occupation,\nafter the war, it closed.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: It closed for a -- at least a year, year and a half, that\u2019s what interrupted the violin lessons.",
        "Q: So you were very good to go to conservatory, no?",
        "A: Well, but for only a year, year and a half, I didn\u2019t reach any exalted levels.",
        "Q: Did you love it?",
        "A: At that time I did. The violin is a very hard instrument, and to -- to -- to make 1t make a\npleasant sound, it -- the technique in itself is very hard. I had a boyhood -- childhood\nfriend, two years older than I, Saby Shabetai, he lived in the apartment above ours. And\nwhen I would eg -- do exercises, then the windows were open, and then from time to time\nhe would shout and tell me to stop that horrible sound. But I -- I persevered, but the war\nput an end to that.",
        "Q: Right, right. And you have two brothers, Samuel, who was born in 1930, I believe?",
        "A: In 1930, yes.",
        "Q: And --",
        "A: And the youngest, he was named Nehama, he was born in 1934.",
        "Q: Right. Tell me a little bit about Samuel. Was this hard for you, when the second brother --\nyou were four -- you were four years old when he --",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t hard --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- but I think it\u2019s -- I can see it in my own children and grandchildren, that the four age\ndifference, for the first 10 - 15 years, is almost an -- an unbridgeable gap. You have\ndifferent friends. I -- I -- I didn\u2019t have, I ca -- as I recall, any problems with my younger\nbrother, but I wasn\u2019t really that close to him.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But in contrast, with the youngest brother -- let me call him Meko, because that\u2019s how we\n-- we called him, from the diminutive Nehameko, I was much closer to him. I was sort of\nhis protector. I would take him for walks to the park. I would sometimes supervise the\nfirst lessons that he had in going to school. And this is how we were growing up. I\u2019m --\nI\u2019m sure that a little bit later on, if -- if things had not happened w-what actually\nhappened, I would have been friendly with all of them.",
        "Q: All of them. How do you account for being so close, or wanting to do things with the\nlittlest one, and not with the one [indecipherable]",
        "A: I think simply that -- that I thought it was a natural thing. I -- I don\u2019t think I was asked by\nmy mother, but simply I -- I felt that it was a natural role to play, because I was now big\nenough to protect him if he would go out and play, if another kid would attempt to beat\nhim up, I would be around to --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- to protect him.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: It was just a -- a role I -- I -- I fell into naturally. I don\u2019t think I was asked to do it.",
        "Q: Was yours a religious household?",
        "A: We were observant in all the Jewish traditions, I\u2019m talking the Sabbath, and of course, all\nthe holidays.",
        "Q: So you observed the Sabbath?",
        "A: Yes, I think at the age of five and on, my Friday chore, before the actual Sabbath started,\nwas to deliver a bottle of olive oil to the synagogue, because in Sephardic synagogues,\nthere are no candles. Everything is in glass containers with olive oil and wicks that burn.\nAnd the thing that you do is to keep the synagogue supplied with oil. And since it was so\nnear my house, then I would be asked to deliver a -- a bottle of oil. Also, my memories,\nboth of the Sabbath, and -- and -- and the major holidays, they are visual, oral, and\nolfactory, because Friday afternoon, before the onset of Sabbath, when the dining room\nand the living room were closed, the floors were waxed, and I still remember the -- the\nwax smell, which wa-was indicative of the preparations for the Sabbath.",
        "Q: And do you remember the smell of food, specific food?",
        "A: A little bit at times. I have more visual memory of the dishes that my mother cooked.\nSome of them were, at least visually, very attractive. And I also le -- remember at times\nwhen she would do a number of desserts that required the rolling of dough to a very thin\nlayer, which today you can buy at the store, it\u2019s called phylo -- phylo, which is a Greek\nword. But in those days, she did it, and if you don\u2019t -- you cannot roll it, you roll it up to a\ncertain point, and then I remember she wore a sleeveless dress, and would powder her\narms with flour, and then get under the dough and begin to pull it from every corner.\nAnd you have to be very careful. Very often it would break, and there\u2019s nothing you can\ndo. You would have to start all over again. So I remember these things.",
        "Q: Now, in the Sephardic tradition, are there particular kinds of Jewish dishes within that\ntradition?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a Sephardic tradition so much, as it is the tradition of the territories.\nI think that if you take the cuisine that I think my mother -- first of all, I think because of\nthe way she was taught, butter was never used. I don\u2019t remember seeing butter in my\nhome.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Yes, it was -- first of all, you wanted to avoid having butter, in case inadvertently you\nused it with a -- a meat dish. But it was partly that, partly that both in Greece, and in\nwhere she was born, there is not much dairy. At least -- Greece is not a country with lots\nof dairy land to grow cattle to produce dairy products. Ev-Everybody cooks with olive\noil. So there\u2019s a tremendous similarity. So, the -- the infusion is p-partly Mediterranean,\npartly Turkish, partly Greek cuisine, but I think in -- in my mother\u2019s case, there are some\nremnants of dishes that hark back, I think, from the 14\" or 15\" century in Spain, because\nthey were descendants of the Sephardic Jews who were expelled from Spain.",
        "Q: You were -- were you going to synagogue on a regular basis, or more --",
        "A: Every Saturday.",
        "Q: Every Saturday you went?",
        "A: Every Saturday.",
        "Q: And did your mother also go?",
        "A: Yes. Now, I don\u2019t know if she went every Saturday, but a -- frequently -- certainly the\nholidays she went. And perhaps you know that in Sephardic synagogues, the women\u2019s\nsection is usually a balcony that\u2019s above it.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Did you ever question that when you were a kid?",
        "A: No, you sort of accepted, as being either tradition, historically, until the new -- you find\nout that there\u2019s also some religious grounds.",
        "Q: And were your parents active in Jewish community affairs that you knew of?",
        "A: My father was in the B\u2019nai Brith. And again, because of his lameness, I remember a first\ncousin of his, a m -- I don\u2019t know [inaudible] was very active in Greece, especially in the\nlate 30\u2019s when refugees that would appear at the Port of Pireas were not al -- were\nallowed to disembark. Perhaps some of them ended up in Palestine. Others, I think -- it\u2019s\nnot like that famous ship that roamed the -- the oceans, and eventually had to return. I\nforget it\u2019s -- the name of that ship, but the Holocaust Museum ha -- is --",
        "Q: The Saint Louis.",
        "A: The Saint Louis, yes.",
        "Q: That had to go back to Europe, right.",
        "A: Yes, yes, right, to Europe. So he couldn\u2019t do -- be as active as my -- my -- his cousin was\nin going and delivering goods, and food, and money, so he -- he did it through whatever -\n- his -- his appearances in B\u2019nai Brith, and my mother was a member of WIZO. So she\nwould frequently ha -- go to meetings, and whatever as they -- they --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- they were doing.",
        "Q: Now were you involved -- were there Jewish youth groups in -- in Athens?",
        "A: Not really. Athens before the war had a population -- a Jewish population of\napproximately 2500 persons. In a city of 800,000, or close to a million if you add the\nsuburbs and the Port of Pireas, and they were dispersed. This is in contrast to Salonika,\nwhich had a -- a pre-war po -- total population of about 125,000, of which half went --\nslightly over half was Jewish, and who lived also, traditionally, in sec -- sec -- sectors of\nthe city. They were not ghettos, but they were distinctly Jewish neighborhoods. There\nwere no such thing in Athens.",
        "Q: So how -- how are you feeling as a Greek boy, who is also Jewish in this -- in this\ncontext? Did you feel Greek, were you feeling separate as a Jewish person, or was there a\ngood deal of integration?",
        "A: Oh, there was a lot of integration, there was no overt anti-Semitism, other than these\nmindless thing that boys sometimes cruelly would say. For example, sometimes I would\nbe called a Jew by little, younger boys in -- in the same class. Or at times they would\nfling this silly thing that Jews grab Christian children and put them in a barrel that has\nnails inside, so they roll the barrel to extract the blood, so that they can drink it. You\nknow, the -- those famous blood libel. But this was only for children. You asked af --\nbefore, about Jewish groups. There was really not a -- not Jewish groups as such before\nthe war. There may have been a -- a small group of [indecipherable] call themselves\nMaccabis. But I was too young to -- to join. I think around the age of 10, perhaps -- yes,\n10 or 11, I joined the Boy Scouts. And it turned out that there was a group of about\nperhaps 18 or 20, and we belong to that same group, and all of them were Jews. The\nleader was a prominent young man at that time, 20 or 22, of a very prominent family.\nAnd so we called ourselves Maccabis, but it was primarily as Boy Scouts. But that ended\nin 1939 because the then Fascist regime of Metaxas abolished all Boy Scouts, not the\nJewish, every Boy Scout, or any other organization, because they wanted to promote the\nthen nascent Fascist organization.",
        "Q: And when did they take over, when did the Fascists take over in Greece, what\u2019s the\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: 1936.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Mm-hm. So did your life change at that moment very much, or not so much?",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: | -- I -- this -- this was -- had only a -- a visible effect, I think, to those who were\npolitically involved. And I don\u2019t mean only all the left, or even the far left, but generally\nin Balkan politics, the [indecipherable] opponents get not to be treated very well. But in\nthe Fascist organizati -- regime, 1t was merely ignorance, or shoving them to the side.\nThey were sent to prison, they were sent to islands in exile. But I didn\u2019t know that then,\nand this did not affect us in -- in a daily, visible way. You could see that principally in\nthat -- with the formation of this youth group, then very often y -- friends would appear in\nschool already dressed in that uniform, not only -- not because they really wanted it so\nmuch, because they were ready to go to a meeting afterwards, and they didn\u2019t want to go\nback home and change. But this didn\u2019t last very long, because this thing didn\u2019t take hold\nuntil \u00b039 - \u201940, the establishment of this youth movement. By \u201941, Metaxas was dead, and\n-- and the country was occupied.",
        "Q: Right, right. In addition to the conservatory, you were going to school in addition to the\nconservatory, right? The conservatory was only part of what you were doing, right?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh conservatory was only two or three times a week.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: No, the schooling was -- and I went to a special high school that was of a kind -- because\nfrom early age my father determined that I should be an engineer. So I went to a -- to one\nof two special high schools in Athens, where the emphasis was in mathematics, or\nmathematics and science, therefore aiming to eventually go to the Polytechnic Institute\nfor engineering.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. I\u2019m going to have to change the tape, so we\u2019ll stop for a second.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: Isaac, when you went to this special gimnasium, or high school, were you as happy to be\ngoing there as your father was to send you? Was -- were these the subjects that you liked\nthe most?",
        "A: I think yes. I think after perhaps the age of six or seven, either by dint of repetition from\nmy father, and also because I perhaps began to -- to like, or had no difficulty with\nmathematics, then I didn\u2019t question it. I was going to private schools, although I -- I\nmentioned to you earlier, I was changing because of this age phenomenon. And in order\nto transfer from a private school, to a public school in Greece, at least at that time, I had\nto take a special exam, that I could make a grade. My last year in private school was in a\nCatholic school. That\u2019s a different story, because my father had gone to that school in\nMonastir when he was young, because it was the only school where you could learn\nforeign languages. So there was an equivalent school in Athens, so I went to that. Then I\nhad to take a special exam. I did not -- luckily I didn\u2019t question it, it was almost a natural\nthing to me, it was an -- an expected thing, and I think that I -- I -- there was no reason to\neven think about it, I thought it was just a natural progression.",
        "Q: Did you have hobbies when you were growing up?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: What?",
        "A: I think, in retrospect, I -- and I say that now because now I can see how this thing is\ntraced, I liked to build things. For a -- I build all kinds of kites. You have to remember\nthat you couldn\u2019t go in those days to a store and buy a kite. We only buy materials, from\nthe skeleton, of course were pieces of wood, to paper, and then you had to construct it,\nthen assemble it, and eventually fly it. Then, I would build lots of shadow puppets. Do\nyou know what shadow puppets are? These are f-flat -- if you take a -- a -- a figure of an -\n- of an individual, and say articulate it at the legs and at the arms, and if you hold this\ncardboard piece behind a screen that 1s backlit, you hold it against the screen, then the\naudience on the other side see the -- the puppet, which is essentially it\u2019s outline, and it\u2019s -\n- although it can be colorful, because the colors go -- come through the -- for screening\nwe used to use a sheet, a white thing. So, I used to make that. Now, it progressed. In the\nbeginning, of course, you go to the store and buy the -- a -- a book of the outlines of the\nfigures, which you had to cut very, very carefully. And in the beginning, as a child, I\nwould do them out of cardboard, but to -- to do it with cardboard, which was\n[indecipherable] you had to have a chisel. Well, chisels were not that readily available, so\nwhat we would do is to eventually get a very large nail, and take it and put it on the track\nof the streetcar. And when the streetcar went over the nail, 1t would flatten the edge, and\nmake it a chisel. So we would use that to cut the -- but after, if you become very\nproficient, and you continue, then you begin to make them out of thin plywood, which of\ncourse required different tools, you had a drill, and of course a coping saw with a very\nthin blade, that you have to be very careful because they break very, very frequently, and\nit\u2019s a very elaborate thing because it\u2019s a full -- a [indecipherable] you know, the --\nespecially around the hair. These are the kinds of things I would do. Then, I built a -- a\nradio, you know, out of crystal. I had to go and find appropriate crystal, and get the -- the\nthings, wind the coil. Then we used to try to build telephones. We begin with the usual\ntelephone of two cans with a string, but then we got a little bit more elaborate, and started\nbuilding things that will go a longer distance, with actual wires. So that\u2019s -- I think I trace\nmy interest in -- in building things.",
        "Q: When you were doing these puppets, did you actually do little shows for [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh yes, of course, af -- after all this -- there were also books, because first of all, th-the\nmain character is called Karagioz, and it\u2019s a remnant from the 400 years of Turkish\noccupation of Greece, because literally Karagioz means black eyes. He was, I don\u2019t\nknow, perhaps Pucinello in Italian Renaissance plays, or Tilolenspiegel. It\u2019s a\ncombination of a character who was perhaps completely illiterate, but street smart, and\nwho would always outwit more serious and officious, in particular, because the -- the --\nthe opponents were always Turks, you see, and -- and -- and al -- all --all the police, or\nsome -- a clerk, so always the street mart boy -- actually man later on, because he had\nchildren himself, would outwit them all. Of course we would learn the parts, and then at\nthat time we would try to invite[indecipherable], and we sometimes ask for a fee, you\nknow, for those who would come, and we would put on a show.",
        "Q: That must have been great fun.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And I gather, because you were doing this with other people, that these were friends of\nyours, of like interests.",
        "A: Right, they were either people in the immediate neighborhood, or later on, for more\nserious things, that they were much more complex, there were, I\u2019m sure, school friends,\nschool mates.",
        "Q: So your memories of your childhood are very pleasant?",
        "A: Yes, why, because family life was good, pleasant. School was pleasant too, at times\ndifficult, which 1s something that -- that every child meets. But nothing dark until \u201940 --\nlate \u00b040 or \u201941.",
        "Q: Are you hearing things about -- I mean, I know in 1933 you\u2019re a little bit too young to\nhave begun to hear things about what\u2019s happening in Germany, although I don\u2019t know, I\nmean, did you have some sense, as you began to be six, seven, eight years old, that\nsomething was going on in Europe that was no so good?",
        "A: Yes. I have to speak for myself.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I think my earliest recollection, which I date my becoming politically aware, is 1936,\nwith the onset of this Spanish Civil War. I think the reason being primarily that it was\nwritten up in the newspapers. My mother and father, in particular my mother -- and I\nreally do not know why. I try sometimes to understand why, because obviously I didn\u2019t\nhave conversations with her about things like that. But she was very interested in politics,\nand I know she read, and she discussed things with my father. So I would then read the\narticles also. So I began to become very sensitive about the situation in Europe. Then, in\n\u201937 or \u00b038, the interest broadened primarily because in -- in the synagogue, during for\ninstance the break in the entire day of Yom Kippur, after the morning prayers, we\nwouldn\u2019t even go home, although it was around the corner, we would stay in the yard.\nAnd we began to see for the first time, people who -- who had never seen before. And\nthese were Ashkenazi -- Jewish people from Czechoslovakia, or Germany, who had\nfound refuge in -- in Greece, in escaping the na -- so one couldn\u2019t help being sensitive to\nthis, primarily because my parents talk about it, even when na -- friends came to visit,\nand we could overhear their conversation. It -- it\u2019s went around, things like this. So I -- I -\n- I can -- I can date my awareness. I don\u2019t -- and also I had begun to be very interested in\n-- in history. I always loved history, I -- I read history books for children from an early\nage, including myths, and mythology. Excuse me. So I was aw-aware from the middle\n30\u2019s.",
        "Q: Did you talk about this with your friends, or did you just mainly keep it to yourself?",
        "A: I think we would talk a little bit primarily about following the headlines. Re-Remember\nthere were stories which went in is -- Spanish Civil War, then I remember stories of\nbombardments by German planes, and we would ask, what -- what -- what are Germans\ndoing in -- in Spain? But of course, now one knows that there was a contingent of a -- a --\nit became almost a proving ground for many of their -- their -- their weapons. Or the\nItalians, you know, also the same thing. By contrast, although the French and the British\nwere neutral, and in fact at times m-made terrible obstacles to try to help the -- the\nloyalists, you have to remember that because of -- of speaking French, I have to say that\nwe were a very Francophile family, so I -- I had read French history. My father, after the\nwar, had bought a book about the second World War that was illustrated with\nphotographs, and I remember spending endless hours leafing through the book, looking at\nphotographs of the French generals, French soldiers, battle scenes, plus also the text.",
        "Q: So you -- bef -- before 1939 - 1940, were you worried about what might happen to\nGreece? Do you remember as a child worrying?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: No, you weren\u2019t.",
        "A: No. And that\u2019s why, in 1940, when Italy declared war, when we -- Greece went to war\nwith Italy, I think it\u2019s fair to say that it was a surprise to everyone. I -- there may have\nbeen understanding by much more politically savvy individuals than a 13 year old, that\nperhaps Greece inevitably, or no part was going to be spared, and we always get to be\ninvolved. But I don\u2019t think anyone expected the sort of -- of overt th -- move on the part\nof Mussolini to -- to demand access to Salonika, which of course has to be refused, and\nthe rest, as we say, 1s history, right?",
        "Q: Did -- were you forced to join a Fascist group? Because I know that Samuel was in one.",
        "A: Yes, yes, not I, because what happened was the dissolution of the Boy Scouts -- and I still\nremember, you see 25 March is the national holiday in Greece, because it\u2019s when the war\nof independence in 1821 started against the Turks. So, usually were parades, and we as\nBoy Scouts participated in the parades. But in that year, in 1940, which was the order to\ndissolve the Boy Scouts, it was our last day, we were all dressed in our uniforms and so\nforth. But the Fascist youth begun, I think first year of high school, and they would\ngradually proceed to the later grades. But by 1940 or \u201941, I was in now the fifth grade,\nwhich was the next to last grade, so I didn\u2019t have to. That was one reason. The other\nreason 1s that if we insisted, as aliens, not being Greek citizens, we didn\u2019t have to be part\nof it. But I think in Sam\u2019s case, instead of making a fuss, he put this blue thing.",
        "Q: So you were not citizens?",
        "A: No, we were not Greek citi -- I came to the United States, as I mentioned to you earlier in\nprivate, on a Yugoslav ci -- passport.",
        "Q: Right, right. Hm. So when the occupation happens, the invasion is 1940, and then the\nItalian --",
        "A: No. Excuse me. In -- in O-October of 1940, Italy essentially gave an -- send an ultimatum\nto Greece, to essentially let it come through. Which was effectively like saying we want\nto occupy you [indecipherable]. You Metaxas even said no, and the war started between\nGreece and Italy, primarily taking place in Albania, because the Italians had already\noccupied Albania, so they tried to invade that northwestern part of Greece known as\nEpirus, from the Albanian border. Well, they were not only repulsed, but also the Greeks\nbegan to advance. So for the full of -- of 40, and the spring of \u201941, the -- the -- the war in\nGreece was only between the Italians and the Greeks. It was not until April of \u201941 that\nGermany declare war, and -- an-and -- and invaded, and the reason principally is that in\nYugoslavia, the then regent had, not necessarily allied himself with Germany, but had\nsigned a non-aggression pact with Germany, but then there was a revolution, or a coup by\nyoung officers in the Yugoslavian army, and they expelled the regent, and elevated the\nyoung then King Peter, who was a minor, to become king, and overturned the\narrangement with Germany, which infuriated Hitler, and in -- in a lightning campaign\nthat lasted, I think, about three and a half to four weeks, all of Yugoslavia and Greece\nwere Overrun.",
        "Q: Mm. And that was in April of \u201941?",
        "A: Yes. The Germans entered Athens April 30\" of \u201941, the day after my birthday.",
        "Q: And -- and how was that in relationship to your Bar Mitzvah, that -- was your Bar\nMitzvah later?",
        "A: No, but -- no, Bar Mitzvah was earlier because I had my Bar Mitzvah when I -- in 1939,\nand it was a very elaborate affair, at least as I --",
        "Q: Yes? As you remember?",
        "A: As I remember, we were, you know -- first of all, the preparation itself. Actually, when I\nwe -- first went to school, first grade of primary school, I went to a Jewish school. I\nwould have continued, but the school was bursting, they didn\u2019t have enough facilities, so\nthey had to close it, because they were going to build a different -- a -- a much larger\nfacility. So I began to go to -- to Greek schools. So I had begun to -- to read Hebrew, and\nunderstand at least a little bit of -- of Hebrew. But that, essentially did not continue,\nbecause then I started going to Greek schools. But I think about six to seven months\nbefore my -- my Bar Mitzvah, I began to take then lessons, with the then rabbi of Athens.\nSo I got well prepared, and so I --",
        "Q: Was it a big party?",
        "A: Yes, I remember it lasted almost all day long --",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: -- because the -- the people came sort of in waves. I-It was -- we received in our\napartment. In those days I think nobody would go and -- and -- and engage a hall\nsomeplace, and -- and -- for guests. So I think people know that they had to stagger, so\nthey came after the -- the ceremony in the synagogue, they came in continuous waves,\nthat lasted practically all day long.",
        "Q: And these were children and adults, or only adults?",
        "A: Both.",
        "Q: Both.",
        "A: Both. [indecipherable] were children of comparable age.",
        "Q: Right, not little.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: So when the occupation hap -- do you remember seeing German troops?",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]. So that must have been really frightening.",
        "A: Well, it was frightening because for one thing, by -- by that time, we knew what had\nhappened to Europe, what -- what ha -- what happened to Jews in particular, so we -- we\nknew it was not a good thing for us, all right? But again, th-there\u2019s another th -- aspect\nwhich becomes important for our story, that Athens was occupied by Italians. I think\nHitler, as a sop to Mussolini, gave him Athens, and a few other larger ci-cities, and\nregions of Greece to occupy. Unfortunately, well -- I don\u2019t know if that would have made\nit -- it may -- it might have made a difference. Salonika was under total German\noccupation.",
        "Q: Right, right, and that means that the greatest number --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- of Jews living in Greece were under German occupation.",
        "A: Right. So, vi-visibly, of course we could see Germans, ma -- German soldiers, but\nItalians were a lot more visible. And all this would cha -- were issued, as any occupying\nauthority does, promulgating laws, and things like this, always, although there was -- they\nwere coming from the quisling government, the collaborating government, but generally\nit was according to the orders of -- and they would cite, in particular, Italian thing.",
        "Q: So in \u201941 and \u201942, does your life change very much, or is there a kind of -- once the\noccupation starts, does it settle down?",
        "A: Well, it changed in many respects, but I -- I continue with school, I f -- I finish high\nschool in -- in \u00b042. The winter of \u201941 to \u00b042, which was the first winter under occupation,\nturn out to be the most terrible winter of the occupation from the standpoint of famine.\nFor the first time, you know, we had begun to see weak people who had fallen in the\nmiddle of the street, and gradually even some of them who were left there, and some of\nthem dead. So it was a very, very -- and it -- it -- be -- coincidentally also, Athens,\ngenerally, had mild winters. I remember only once in my entire childhood remembering\nsnow. Snow, it was only something that you read in books. And we woke up one day and\nthe roofs were a little white. And some of us went immediately to try to make a\nsnowman, but the moment we reached the street, the snow had melted. There wasn\u2019t very\nmuch left. But that was a very rough winter, it was very, very cold. There was no heating,\nlack of food. I think that probably what happened is that the black market and other\nclandestine ways of getting food -- also, people didn\u2019t know what the occupying powers\nwere going to do in grabbing hold of the agricultural produce that naturally came out of --\nout of Greece. But in -- in -- in short, it was a terrible winter, but then things begun to be\nbetter. We did not suffer very much in our family, because -- although we didn\u2019t get the\nkinds of foods that we were used to. Then I remember being sent by my mother to stand\nin -- on queues, in lines, to buy a piece of feta, a piece of cheese. And sometimes we\nwould stand on line for hours only to -- to reach the door practically, and then be told that\nthere\u2019s no more I-left. So we spent a great deal of time like that. But I was not directly\naffected with it in school. We had to be very careful, I -- we were advised and\nadmonished by our teachers not to make any politically overt statements in class, for\nobvious reasons. But ho -- yor -- y-you knew that you were not entirely free to say what\nyou wanted to, and you had to be very, very careful. There was no curfew in Athens\nbecause at least at that time it would have been almost impossible to enforce. A -- as soon\nas I finish hi -- high school in \u201942, normally I would have then taken the exams to get into\nthe Polytechnic Institute, but it was closed. The university was closed. So I then, until the\nbeginning of the Jewish persecution in Athens, I worked for slightly over a year for a\nman who was in -- during the occupation there was a clan-clan-clandestine stock\nexchange. We\u2019re not talking about stocks, or bonds, or -- the only means of transaction,\nthe only thing that was transacted was gold. Gold coins, English sovereigns, French gold\nfrancs, Swedish francs, and occasionally bars, small bars of gold. And this market was\nobviously entirely underground, because it was under penalty of death if you were caught\nwith gold. The way the market was done, it was strictly over the telephone. Somebody\nwould call and -- in the morning and say, \u201cI have 10 -- 10 liras,\u201d they used to be called\ncollectively, \u201cto sell, what is the asking price?\u201d And this market would fluctuate entirely\non what would happen in the international news. If the Germans were winning, then the\nGreek drachma would lose even more of it\u2019s value. We talk about, by that time, a million\ndrachmas, you know, it was -- millions was just like to buy some candy. If the allies were\nwinning, on the contrary, then the drachma would rise, because you know, naturally\npeople thought that with the allied side winning, then the days of liberation for Greece\nwould come, and therefore the drachma would gain, you know, gain value. So that\u2019s what\nI did. I mean, I would then -- my -- my -- my -- the -- the man I worked for would be the\nmiddle man. He would then sell -- get a buyer, get a seller. And then I would then have to\nfrom time to time, deliver the goods, which were rolls, maybe of 10 silver coins, and I\nwould deliver them to the -- go pick them up, and -- and deliver them. And it was, you\nknow, it was a dangerous thing, because if I was fa -- fa -- if I were found out, then it\nwould have been terrible. But I was not found out.",
        "Q: Let me go back to the school for a moment.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: Was there propaganda in the school, or were there -- were the classes really pretty\nstraightforward?",
        "A: There was no propaganda. There were -- especially in that high school. I -- I -- I think it\nwas too early. There was not enough time for the occupying forces to begin something\novert that would trickle down into the lessons themselves. I mean, what we were -- as I\nsaid, admonished by our teachers not to do, is not to make overt statements against the\noccupying powers. Even in -- in jest, you know, for obvious reasons. But there was no --\nno effect -- no visible effect.",
        "Q: So there were y -- there was no -- you -- you didn\u2019t have to do a --a -- a heil to anybody?",
        "A: Oh no, no, none of that.",
        "Q: Nothing?",

        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Because the firm continued, and then there was no -- they didn\u2019t shut down any\nbusinesses. Again, I -- it -- it requires emphasis to contrast it with not only what happened\nafterwards, but also with the situation in Salonika, in that there were no effect on Jewish\nbusinesses. The Italians didn\u2019t shut any -- anything down. So there -- the textile firm\ncontinued, and my father continued.",
        "Q: Was this surprising to you, given that the Italians were allies of the German?",
        "A: Well, it were not surprising -- I mean, I di -- I -- I don\u2019t --",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t know what to expect?",
        "A: Right. And -- and you see, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- we begun to hear not only stories, but\nthings which I remember y -- I knew my parents were discussing. Very early after the\noccupation, in the fall of \u00b041, the Germans in Salonika conscripted all males, I think\nbetween the age of 18 to 45 or 50, and they were taken into forced labor along the Greek\nBulgarian border to do road work. I think 1t was primarily harassment. And I remember\nwer -- of course lots of conversations that my parents and their friends are discussing a\ndelegation from a number of prominent Jews of Athens and Salonika, including I think\nthe rabbi in Corats in Salonika, went to Vienna. And after a few weeks they came back,\nand there was a deal struck, apparently, where a head toll had to be paid to sort of get th-\nthose Jews -- Salonika Jews, released from the forced labor. But you see, the -- again,\nthese things are happening in Salonika. The things trickle down, or come down relatively\nquickly, but the Italians refused to do -- to take any anti-Jewish me -- measures. If I -- I\nhave looked into that. I -- very often, I -- I t -- I say to my children, other people that I\nthink I survived because the Italians did not enforce. I have spoken to a number of\npeople, some of them even s -- students of that period, and no -- knowledgeable. They\nascribe to the f -- these thing to the fact that the Italian army refused to take any political\nmeasures. So they say it was not an attempt to save Jews, but because simply they refused\nto get involved politically. However, now I have read, and I have seen tremendous\ninstances where Italians, and the only ones were army contingents, really did go out of\nthe way to save Jews. So Athens was fortunate in that regard.",
        "Q: Now, you said when the Germans came in, when the occupation happened, when the\nGermans and the Italians came in, that you and your family knew something of what had\nbeen going on in Germany, and Czechoslovakia --",

        "Q: -- and in Austria.",

        "A: We knew that -- th-that they had lost livelihoods --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- they were not allowed to be in many professions, many of them had to leave. We saw\nvisibly, with our own eyes, refugees. I, in the winter of \u201940 - \u00b041, I would send my -- my\nfather to take classes -- not classes, to be taught by a private tutor, who was a Jewish top\nengineer in the scuda works in Czechoslovakia. I was sent there not because I needed any\ntutoring, but because it was an indirect way to really contribute something for this\nindividual and his wife. And I still remember this man, relatively young, you know,\nextremely bright, and so we -- all of those things were known. The Kristallnacht --",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That was most prominent thing. So we go -- get into \u201942 now, and the only thing that we\nare able to learn forst -- firsthand, because from the radio, which is under control of the\nItalians and Germans, of course, you -- you\u2019re not going to learn anything. And the\nnewspapers also, were all of them simply writing handouts, and nobody would write\nanything that was in any contradi -- but of course we knew from other sources, including\nlistening to foreign broadcasts about how the war is going, and -- and you know that until\nlate \u00b042, things were not very good for -- for the allies. But there was nothing until the\nbeginning of \u201943, when in very quick succession, we began to hear about things which\nreally were not only palpably true, but were very close to home. Perhaps we will come to\nthat point if you ask me again in the beginning of \u201943, but I can re-remember palpably,\naround the beginning or -- or end of March of \u201943, and beginning of April \u201943, suddenly a\n-- a -- the -- my parents look was dark, and didn\u2019t change. It was not something that was\ntemporary that something was bothering them, or something like this. It just -- something\ndescended, a pall. Now, we were not told about it, but I now, in retrospect, and I think I\nknow that the fate of the relatives in Monastir, which occurred -- the fateful day was 11\nMarch, \u201943, which I know subsequently, and the Salonika -- the expulsion of the Jews\nfrom Salonika took place early April of \u201943. That was just the beginning, for me at any\nrate, of an extremely visible effect that I saw, and I began to feel, but 1t was vague,\nbecause no one knew at that time about concentration camps. The story was relocation,\nwhich of course, that\u2019s what the Germans were giving out. But definitely, that\u2019s --\nsomething like that, that I -- I -- I -- I know was a -- a tremendous change, which lasted,\nof course, and persisted.",
        "Q: Right. Do you think your parents knew more than you did?",
        "A: Oh, absolutely, yes. And again I have to s -- to -- to -- to stress, I don\u2019t think that my --\nmy parents did not tell us, for the usual reasons that sometimes -- or the phrase, to protect\nour sensibilities. It was not -- not that. But the thing was so immense, and yet, they\nthemselves having suffered so much 1n the b -- bombardment in the second World War,\nbecause Monastir was a pla -- a -- a battleground between the -- the Germans and their\nallies, and they --",
        "Q: You mean the first World War.",
        "A: The first wor -- I\u2019m sorry, the first World War, right. Having lived through that, and also,\nyou know, in th-the psyche of the Sephardim, going back five centuries, But I remember\njust a few weeks before the Germans arrived in Athens, that I don\u2019t know, perhaps a\nchildish, but I remember asking my -- my father, why don\u2019t we leave, and get on a ship\nand go away? Because during the war, and listening to what was happening to France,\nand -- and Poland, and things like this, there was definitely a feeling that we -- we began\nto get bombarded by the Germans. Now, of course my father not -- he didn\u2019t really\nridicule the thing, but I mean, it wasn\u2019t really that easy to just get on there, we go where,\nyou know, at that time. Where were we gonna go? But I still remember that I had\nreactions, because I had heard what was happening in -- but it was something that was so\nvague, that I couldn\u2019t put something, you know, a face, or something concrete in the way\nof measures. But definitely a -- 1t was something -- I thought it was a dark cloud that\ngrew, and ga -- became darker, and then enveloped us all.",
        "Q: And you became depressed as you saw your parents beco -- I mean, it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s as if there -\n- there\u2019s a shroud on them, on your face.",
        "A: No, I -- I -- I think at that time, I was in a kind of schizophrenic situation. I used to go to\nwork, then in the evening I would go with my friends, my schoolmates, most of them.\nAnd 1-in fact, it was a -- a kind of a thing tha-that very often one considers that there was\nmore going on in Athens at that time, especially it\u2019s night life. More cabarets, and more\n[indecipherable]. It\u2019s almost as if people think that since there 1s no tomorrow, they might\nas well do what -- whatever they can for the time that they have left. I was too young, I\ndidn\u2019t go to cabarets, but we used to go out, an-and go occasionally t -- and drink a beer,\nor something like that. So, I was then able to en -- en -- most of them, there were about\nfour or five, were Greek Orthodox, there\u2019s only another Jew beside myself in that small\ncircle. The depression would be felt at home, because again it was so apparently\noverwhelming, and it was impossible to -- oh, except only to see them visually in my --\nmy parents faces. They didn\u2019t talk about it, and I think they probably became even very\ncareful in even ve -- when they were talking to each other, lest the -- they be overheard\nand frighten us unnecessarily. Not unnecessarily, but at least in ways that children were\nnot to be expected to be able to cope with.",
        "Q: When you were out was it mainly with boys, or is it a mixed group of girls and boys?",
        "A: Oh no, no, there were no mixed groups.",
        "Q: Oh, no mixed groups? No.",
        "A: No, not in those days, no, no. It was primarily boys. Occasionally you try to -- to chase a\ngirl or two, but there were -- there were no mixed groups.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t go out with any girls of your -- at -- and you\u2019re [indecipherable] 15?",
        "A: Yeah -- no, no, not at that time. I look at them, but never go out.",
        "Q: So the girls would go out together, if they would go out, and probably wouldn\u2019t go out in\nthe evening alone?",
        "A: Probably not. Most of them were, you know, very restricted. I mean, they would go, they\nwould go out in a big company, either with their parents, or with their brothers, or\ncousins.",
        "Q: I see. So it\u2019s a little different than probably some of what happened in Europe at that\ntime?",
        "A: Oh sure.",
        "Q: There may have been --",
        "A: Oh yes --",
        "Q: -- a different kind of social existence.",
        "A: Right, yes.",
        "Q: And how was your brother -- your two brothers doing at this time?",
        "A: Well, you know, they -- they had their own friends.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Again, schooling continued, so in -- in some aspects, it\u2019s almost an unreal situation to talk\nif there is a -- a continuing normal life going on in the face of impending danger, but\ncould you -- one has, even I think very clever people had the foresight to really imagine\nit\u2019s dimensions. And I don\u2019t think that -- that -- that necessarily this thing I mentioned\nearlier about so many nightclubs in Athens, I mean this feeling that well, there\u2019s only\nanother day to live for, so let\u2019s, you know, make merry. I don\u2019t think there was very\nmuch of that, but the uncertainty of what hap-happens, especially seeing in the winter of\n\"41, dead people in the street, so -- made everybody aware that there was a lot of fragility,\nnot in life in general, I -- even in normal times, but especially in those -- in those times.",
        "Q: Did you see dead bodies in the street?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes.",
        "Q: What did that do to you? Do you remember your -- the first time?",
        "A: Well, o-of course, in the beginning you do -- you don\u2019t even believe it, you know, then\npeople who w -- would surround some person, you know. In the beginning, of course\nthere was attempts to -- to -- to help, and carry. But when it became more prevalent, and\nit would become such a -- a common occurrence -- I don\u2019t want to give the impression\nthat that\u2019s just a little, but, you know, they were there. And I think the thing that struck\nme after a little while, something that led -- I also had to do, is you don\u2019t even stop. You\njust go on, because you know, practically, there is nothing you can do. In one of the main\nsquares of Athens, it\u2019s called Omonia, which mean co -- means Concorde -- Place de la\nConcorde in -- in Paris. It was a station -- a subway, the metro, but was un-underground.\nAnd on the square itself, above the metro, the metro station, there was a grate where most\nof the warm gases that emanated from -- and, but it was filled up with derelicts that were\nhomeless, and filthy, because that was the only warmth that they could get. They would\nhover over the grates, and so that became a part of daily life, and I\u2019m sorry to say in\nretrospect, that one becomes inured to things like that.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah, it\u2019s interesting that you talk about sort of living -- you live on two levels.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: One you ke -- try to keep normalcy --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- and yet, at the same time, you have this very different thing.",
        "A: This pall, this different -- this different thing, this -- this thing which was visible in my\nparent\u2019s faces. First, any -- even in their own comportment, I mean, I don\u2019t remember,\nyou know, for those six or seven months prior to the dispersal, seeing them even smile.\nAnd I can only imagine the kind of burden that they felt.",
        "Q: Did you have relatives living in Salonika?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t?",
        "A: No. We had lots of relatives in Monastir.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: My father, brother and his family, a sister, and her family, in fact two sisters and their\nfamilies, but on the maternal side, there were two aunts, my mother\u2019s sisters, living in\nAthens with their families. The eldest sister had migrated with her family to Palestine.\nThey lived in Salonika, but in \u201930 -- to \u201933, they left and went to -- to Palestine. So, w-we\nhad -- then there were cousins, all of them in Athens. We had no relatives in Salonika,\nexcept that some who were fortunate enough -- and there were very, very few, one or two\nwho escape Macedonia, Monastir or Bitola, as it was called, and make it to Athens, and\nin fact -- t-to -- to -- first to Salonika, but very quickly, my f -- father\u2019s niece, my first\ncousin, and her husband and young daughter came to Athens, but we had no -- but I -- I\nthink that there\u2019s no question that my parents knew, or had heard, although I\u2019m sure it\nmust have been a very murky story, because the details do not even a -- become known\nuntil after the war, and -- and years after the war, that all the Monastir Jews, all the Bitola\nJews were expelled, as well as those in Scorpia expelled. They were -- they were -- th-\nthey disappeared.",
        "Q: And was that area under Bulgarian occupation?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah. So they were actually, they were deported before the Salonika Jews.",
        "A: Just only three weeks --",
        "Q: Oh, this is -- this is -- yes.",
        "A: -- three weeks. It was a con -- a -- a -- a-- a concerted effort. It was not only the\nMacedonia Jews because the Bulgarians were given that part of former Yugoslavia, and -\n- as well as part of northern Greece. And the Jews in Thrace, and other parts of northern\nGreece, under Bulgarian occupation, also were deported by the Bulgarians. Their fate\nwas slightly different from those of Monastir because they were taken by barges up in the\nDanube, one of them was sunk, and people drowned, and eventually they got them to rail\nheads, and took them by transports to Auschwitz, and to -- but all of the other\nMacedonian Jews, all of them ended up in Treblinka. And nobody returned.",
        "Q: Right. Did you have to wear a Jewish star?",
        "A: No. Again, I remind you, and I -- and myself, because the Italians did not enforce any\nlaws -- any racial laws.",
        "Q: But when -- excuse me -- 1n 1943, after the armistice in Italy, and the Italians are no\nlonger occupying the area that you\u2019re living in, the Germans occupy.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So something changes radically --",
        "A: Immediately.",
        "Q: -- at that time, right?",
        "A: Immediately, yes. Well --",
        "Q: Did you, by the way, know what was going on in Italy, that the allies --",
        "A: Sure, of course.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: We know what\u2019s going on in North Africa, the allies are winning, then the invasion in\nSicily, and then finally the a -- a -- ar -- the Italian armistice. But things happened so fast,\nthere was no time for reflection, because I -- I think within a day or two, I think it\u2019s\naround September eighth, or ninth, or 10, or \u201943, the Germans take over Athens. And we\ndidn\u2019t have time to see visually what the effect of the change was, but practically the\nsecond or third day, we already are told by the rabbi of Athens, that the Germans are now\nasking f-for Jews to go and register. And be -- because, I think of the knowledge of what\nhad happened in Salonika, that this was essentially a -- a core to disperse. So within a day\nor two after we received this news about first registration, we then abandoned everything\nand went into hiding. So there was no time, and by therefore even -- since that happen,\nthere were no Jews around Athens to be told to go and wear a star.",
        "Q: So how -- do you know how the decision was made to disperse? Had your father been\npreparing this? As if this might happen, do you know?",
        "A: Let me tell you what -- what I -- I -- I remember.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I -- as I say, it was, I think evening -- the first thing that I know is that my boss told me\nthat he is obliged to close shop. He is -- he has to go into hiding. So I say good-bye to\nhim, and it must have been a -- as I said, perhaps two or three days after the -- the\narmistice and the occupation of Athens by the Germans. When I return home, it must\nhave been around six o\u2019clock, seven o\u2019clock in the evening, my father convened a family\ncouncil, which was a first. And -- but very calmly, but with a few measured words,\nsimply said, \u201cWe have to go into hiding, because the Germans are taking over, and\nthey\u2019re going to come after us, personally. So we\u2019re going to have to go into hiding, and\nwe have to disperse. We cannot take anything other than the clothes on our backs.\u201d I had\nbegun to think about that, because I had heard a little bit about the Salonika thing. So, I\nhad spoken to one of my friends, ones that I went out with who was a former schoolmate\nof mine from high school. His name was Thanassis Michalopoulos. So as soon as my\nfather told us what the decision was, then wa -- he turned to me, and he says, \u201cWell,\nyou\u2019re going to go in here.\u201d Apparently he had spoken to a friend and neighbor. And I\ntold him, \u201cAll right, but let me -- also, I have spoken to Thanassis Michalopoulos,\u201d he\nknew him, \u201cand he was going to menti -- talk to his parents, and I\u2019m to see him\ntomorrow, why don\u2019t we wait until tomorrow?\u201d He says, \u201cFine.\u201d So, ev-eve-eventually --\nI mean, the following day, I spoke to Mehanis, and he said, \u201cYou are welcome.\u201d And I\nhad not even met his parents. I went to their home, and immediately they, with no fuss,\nno nothing, said, \u201cYou can stay with us for as long as you want.\u201d Then I went home, it\nwas the last day that we were together, and my mother and Sam, and Meko were going to\ngo together to one of the suburbs, as the -- again arranged by my father. And my father\nwith another Greek friend. So, well, we know, we said good-bye, embraced, but of course\nI -- I was told by my father his address, because I would need money from time to time,\nand I would have to go and see him. But then I went with the few clothes I had with me,\nand stayed in Thanassis\u2019s house.",
        "Q: I think we should stop the tape --",
        "A: All right.",
        "Q: -- now, because the story\u2019s going to get very complicated.",
        "A: Right.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "Q: -- unusual. This is the first time you ever had a family --",
        "A: Council.",
        "Q: Council. Was -- was he very explicit with you? It -- beyond saying we have to disperse,\nwe have to go into hiding because the Germans are going to come after us? Did he -- did\nyou say, well what -- what are they going to do? Did [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, no. Yeah, he was -- I mean, I -- because it was, a first experience, but in other words,\neven in retrospect I remember even at that time, or a day or two later, in thinking what he\nsaid, I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t rehearse it. He didn\u2019t -- I mean, he -- obviously he knew what he\nwanted to say, but he did it with -- quite directly. He was quite clear, in other words, he\nset the scene, and said we are coming under German occupation. We now know what\nhappened to the Jews of Salonika, and their fate is unknown, but it can only be a terrible\nthing. That is why we are now been given the signal. And I remember he used that word,\nwe be given the signal to disperse all of -- all those who can, because we should not fall\nin -- in German hands. So he -- he set the stage rather clearly, it wasn\u2019t -- it di -- did\n[indecipherable] or things like that. It -- having then set the stage, then just as clearly he\nthen said what my mother and he had decided to do, that we would have to split because\nwe couldn\u2019t all remain together, unfortunately it was impractical going into a friend\u2019s\nhouse that people are not ready to take on five people. So all those things were very clear,\nvery measured, and I don\u2019t recall -- I mean, there was -- I mean we looked at -- at each\nother, my brothers and -- and I, and we looked at them, but it was done in such a realistic,\nbusinesslike way. There was no -- there was no emotional ah -- I mean, I -- my -- I saw\nmy mother crying, but not in a -- in a loud or emotional outward way, was just silent tears\ncoming down -- down her face. But I think probably my father wanted to make sure that\nhe could convey this news without causing, you know, u-undue anxiety, or panic, more\nthan simply what the situation dictated.",
        "Q: Isaac, you said to th -- this was a few minutes ago, off camera, about how you wish, but\nthere\u2019s no answer to the question of the look that your parents had, a sort of gray --\ngrayness, and no smiles.",
        "A: Dark, black, black.",
        "Q: And dark, dark and black.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That you wish that they had been able to communicate what it was that they were feeling\nor thinking. Is it possible also, that they had very little information? That they knew\nsomething was ominous, but they -- they also had no words. Is it --",
        "A: Oh, yes, I mean, s -- I\u2019m sure they had no conception of the dimensions of the horror, but\non the other hand, I mentioned earlier, as early as \u00b041, the Germans did the conscription\nof the Jews in Salonika.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Ransom had to be paid. Then the deportation occurred, and actually, this was written up\nin the papers, because the then archbishop of Greece wrote a -- a -- a letter to the Greek\nprime minister, the -- the collaboration government, protesting the -- this treatment of the\nJews of Salonika. And very well known, he was threatened to be shot by the German\ngeneral occupying Greece at that time, and there\u2019s a equally famous reply that he made,\nand he said, \u201cGeneral Stroop, Greek -- Greek clergy are hanged, are not shot. Please\nobserve this tradition.\u201d So, information was available. Finally, I -- I -- I have to tell you --\nwhich I have now pieced together subsequently, 1s my father\u2019s niece, the daughter of his\nsister, and her husband had escaped the last minute from Monastir, went to Salonika\nbecause they had family there, but they were told they were crazy to come to Salonika,\nbecause it was under German occupation. Go to Athens. So they came to Athens, I\nimagine around May of \u201943. Italian -- I mean, that\u2019s still under the Italian occupation.\nAnd I\u2019m sure that from Allegra -- that was my cousin\u2019s name, Allegra Russo, and her\nhusband, they were told whatever they know, because they had seen these things first\nhand, I mean, the treatment of the Macedonian Jews of Bitola, it was unspeakable from\nthe first minute of the occupation. So they knew.",
        "Q: But obviously, you picked up enough to talk with your friend even prior to this family\ncouncil.",

        "Q: How --",
        "A: -- pe -- | -- I -- I -- I be -- I sensed, a-as well as heard, because after all, also, my -- the\nman I worked for himself was from Salonika, and had left Salonika a y -- a year or two\nearlier to come to Athens. So, y-you -- you piece -- piece this together, and you know.\nBut I have to -- to tell you that I didn\u2019t discuss the possibility of going into hiding to my\nfriend Thanassis 1n the hearing of the others. I don\u2019t know why, maybe the subject was so\ndelicate, I think, that I spoke to him alone.",
        "Q: None of your other friends were there?",
        "A: Right. So it isn\u2019t something that I had been preparing. And possibly I must have to\nThanassis maybe a week or so before the -- the actual happening, when we put it into\neffect.",
        "Q: Now, you also said that very quickly the Jews of Athens dispersed, many of them would\njust --",
        "A: Disappeared, yes.",

        "A: And th-th-the only thing I -- I -- I -- [remember some Gr-Greek family that hid Jew --\nJewish people, were asked wh-why do they do that.

        "A: Of all of Greece?",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure there might have been, but it was not as regular as it\u2019s done in the United States,\nor even other parts of Europe. But, if you talk about -- particular about the Jewish\npopulation --",

        "A: Now recall that in every community, births and deaths were registered in the Jewish\ncommunity, but also with the Greek authorities. So it was known --",
        "Q: Who was Jewish --",
        "A: -- for example -- yes, because these were remnants in Greece, and in -- in -- 1n the\nBalkans of the 500 years of Ottoman rule, where not only the Jewish communities, the\nGreek communities under Ottoman rule, they were a se -- effectively self regulating, and\nself governing, except, of course, for matters of war, or crimes, or things like that. But\nJews, or even Christians under Ottoman rule, if they had the dispute with -- as a business\ndispute with a partner, they didn\u2019t go to Turkish court. There was a Jewish court in the\nJewish community, that adjudicated things like that, which is a long tradition, as we all\nknow in Europe.",
        "Q: Now the reason why I\u2019m asking is because does this mean that the Germans, when they\ncome in, can easily get a list of who the Jews are, and where they\u2019re living?",
        "A: Yes, the answer 1s, I think, yes. Now, the list may not have been up to date, because\neffectively, some people who are coming from Salonika and other parts of -- of Greece to\nAthens, because of the favorable atmosphere of the Italian occupation, they didn\u2019t\nnecessarily go to the community and register. I believe, but I am not entirely sure a-about\nwhat I\u2019m going to say, that when the rabbi received the instruction to issue then a\nproclamation for the Jews to come and register, I think the paperwork also went with\nhim. So he -- he or -- or -- or other people in the community that went into hiding, hid --",
        "Q: That paperwork.",
        "A: -- the -- the -- the main files.",
        "Q: So does that mean that most of the Jews did not register? Some must have.",
        "A: Well, unfor -- unfortunately, month later -- by that time I\u2019m in the mountains, but I\u2019m -- I\n-- | learn after the war, some people, you know, foolishly, in March, or April \u201944 -- now,\nwe're going about a year later, the Jews issue another proclamation -- I mean, the\nGermans, saying Jews can come and register to get matzoh distributed, and some of\nthem, believe it or not, did go, and they were grabbed, and --",
        "Q: Now, before you go to the mountains, you are hiding for about how long?",
        "A: Two or three weeks, yeah.",
        "Q: Two or three -- just a few weeks?",
        "A: Yeah, two or three weeks in Thanassis\u2019s house. I -- I go out in the evenings, at times. I --\nI went, saw my father two or three times. I went and saw my mother and brothers twice.\nAnd --",
        "Q: And you were the only one who could do that? In -- the other mem -- other members of\nthe family didn\u2019t come to see you, you went to see them?",
        "A: No, yes. First of all, now I got -- my younger -- two younger brothers lived in an eastern\nsuburb of Athens. I -- my friend\u2019s house was a 10 minute walk really, from the apartment\nwhere we lived. So it was much more, not only convenient, but I think more prudent for\nme to go -- my father, of course, could not navigate, as we know, and I went -- took the\nbus, and went to the suburbs, and saw my mother and brothers twice. I saw my father at\nleast three times, including when I went to tell him of my decision to go to the mountains.",
        "Q: And what did he say?",
        "A: Well, he tried to dissuade me, because he said that I am young, and this 1s not a -- a life\nthat somebody of my age can cope with. But I think when he saw that I was determined,\nhe insisted that since in my travels I may have to go through checkpoints, if somehow I\nwere discovered, he begged me, in fact he insisted that I then run away on purpose so I\ncould be shot and killed, so I would not fall alive in the hands of the Germans. He -- he\ngave me some money to pay for my passage to the mountains, and parenthetically my\nfriend had also asked me that -- that he had decided also to go to the mountains, but his\nparents did not know, and he -- but he didn\u2019t have enough money for the fare, so I asked\nmy father for that also. I did not go to see my mother, because I th -- believed that it\nwasn\u2019t an attempt at dis -- dissuasion, that it would be something more emotional, that I\npossibly could not then handle. And when I -- I -- I was concerned that she might\nsucceed. And since I was determined to go to the mountains, I didn\u2019t go to see her, and\nthis is something that I have regretted, and I will possibly regret forever, that I -- I didn\u2019t -\n- I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t say good-bye to her.",
        "Q: Or to your two brothers.",

        "Q: How did you make the decision to go? What -- what made you, since you weren\u2019t very\npolitical [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, we knew -- y -- people know, because they talk -- you hear things. First of all,\npeople are shot at times because a German soldier was killed, assassinated by the\nresistance, then they grab people at -- at random, and shoot them. And it was known, I\nmean, we knew that there was a part of Greece, generally in the northwestern part from\nthe direction of Athens, in those mountains around Thessaly, and that -- that there was a\nportion which, if I re-remember hearing maybe as early as the summer of \u201943, it was\ncalled free Greece. And that\u2019s all that -- that I knew personally. So when I made the\ndecision, because I -- what led me to make this decision first of all is the negative factor\nthat I couldn\u2019t possibly remain in hiding for goodness knew how long. No one knew how\nlong the -- the situation may last. A few weeks, maybe a few months, it\u2019s something, but\nwhat if it\u2019s years? So I -- I decided I have to get out some -- somewhere. So I said, all\nright, I\u20191l go in the direction which I hear is free Greece. When I talked with my friend,\nThanassis, he was much more politically involved, something that I did not know until\nthat moment, that yes, he also had decided to do that, and he wanted to join a specific\ngroup of the Greek resistance, known as the Zervas forces. He knew that they were in a\nspecific part of Thessaly. So that\u2019s why we decided to take the bus, which was not a bus,\nit was a truck, and -- and head to Thessaly. But from my standpoint that\u2019s all the\ninformation I -- I -- I had.",
        "Q: You had. Now let -- now let me go back to this choice that you made not to see your\nmother, a-and your brothers. Do you --",
        "A: Choice.",
        "Q: Choice.",
        "A: | --",
        "Q: Do you really regret having gone to the mountains? You don\u2019t.",
        "A: No, I\u2019m alive because I went to the mountains.",
        "Q: You went to the mountains.",
        "A: No, I -- well, two things. First of all -- or many things. At times in the mountains I\nthought about -- I -- I thought about them continuously, but th -- I had no news. But I\nthought instead about what was going to be after the war. See, being the eldest child, and\nmy mother was a rather dominant and strong willed individual. We had clashes at -- at\ntimes. And I remember them saying that well now, I w -- I -- I was growing up, now all\nthese things were behind me, and how things were going to be a lot better, and I was\nreally going to be now a magnificent child, that my mother will be proud of me and so\nforth. So there was a lot of that kind of a thing built up, which came crashing down when\nI found out that they were not around any more. And then subsequently, from my brother,\nI learned that my mother was terribly worried about me, because she did not know where\nI was. She had -- they had no news, no -- we could not communicate. There was no way\nfor me -- there were -- I couldn\u2019t write them a letter, for obvious reasons, and there were\nno visitors in the -- especially in the mountains where I was, there was no one that I knew\ncould g -- bring them news. So all these things have a -- had a cumulative effect, and so\nsince the regret -- I had the regret when I made the decision, and maybe a few days, and a\nfew weeks, and a few months, and every time I think about it, it becomes bigger, because\nof other things that I\u2019ve learned. So it piles up.",
        "Q: Right. But she knew that you were going to the mountains because your father had\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: Of course my father -- now, [indecipherable] where my poor father, what did he know,\nother than I -- I was leaving, I was going to go in the direction somewhere. And --",
        "Q: And of course, he doesn\u2019t know --",
        "A: He doesn\u2019t know where I --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] you not make it.",
        "A: No, of course not.",
        "Q: So, in some ways you create a level of anxiety that you didn\u2019t want to create with people,\nbut you had tried to make a decision that was best for you.",
        "A: Right. A-And I ended up 1n a place, and at the time where -- I\u2019m not trying to rationalize\nor excuse it, it would have been almost impossible for me to even send word.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: For example -- perhaps we will come to that point later on when I got to the mountains,\nbecause Thanassis decided not to stay, and then he -- he returned. I did not dare tell\nThanassis where my father was, because we were told, and enjoined when we had this\nfamily council, we were going to go into hiding, and other then because of need, like\ngoing and -- and -- and getting money, or seeing, you know, a -- a loved one, we are not\nto divulge where they are.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And I said, I -- I know from my brother when they were caught by the Germans, they\nwere beaten, because among other things, that -- that they wanted to do is to reveal where\nmy whereabouts were, and where my father\u2019s where -- whereabouts were.",
        "Q: So they knew you existed?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] they knew this, what this family make up was.",
        "A: Right. Oh, sure.",
        "Q: Was -- was there a s -- a network of people who were rescuing people, or were these\nreally individuals that had been chosen by --",
        "A: Yeah, there was no network.",
        "Q: No network.",
        "A: We don\u2019t have anything, as in Denmark, which was -- wasn\u2019t a network so much, but you\nknow, an almost simultaneous reaction of putting all of the -- all -- 99 percent of the\nDanish Jews into boats and ferrying them across to Sweden. All these things were done, I\nthink, on individual measures. There were -- but there is no question that, for example, in\nthe -- in the northern parts of Greece, I mean, I know that there were at times, attempts by\nthe partisan forces, to encourage Jews to leave their homes, and go to the mountains,\nwhich is not an easy thing to -- to do, but nevertheless, they -- they did.",
        "Q: Were you frightened by your own decision, or were you excited that you were finally\nmaking a decision to do something, as opposed to waiting?",
        "A: I was not excited in the sense of -- that I would -- I looked at it as an adventure.",
        "Q: No [indecipherable]",
        "A: It was primarily, you know, a relief that at least I -- I wouldn\u2019t have to -- to live in hiding,\nand -- and be a burden on -- on these friends and so forth.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But there was a great deal of uncertainty, which lasted for about a -- a few days, until my\njourney to the mountains, because I went into an unknown. I could have gone to a\ndifferent region, where I wouldn\u2019t have found anything. Fortunately, I found this specific\nthing, and I -- and -- and before [indecipherable] got transformed, so I didn\u2019t go into this\nthing either as a, you know, a -- a -- a youthful adventure. It was not all that, it was a -- a\nserious undertaking.",
        "Q: A serious undertaking.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: But you did not have a -- in a certain way, a political point of view, except to get away\nfrom the Germans.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Whereas your friend really wanted to join what was an anti-Communist group.",
        "A: Right, yes.",
        "Q: He -- is it this -- pronounced --",
        "A: Zervas.",
        "Q: Zervas.",
        "A: Yeah, he was a -- a former officer in the Greek army, who had formed his own bands in\nthe mountains, and who for a time, they were all collaborating, until they became\npolitically at loggerheads, and started fighting each other, which was a horrible thing, but",
        "Q: So it was -- you didn\u2019t care which group you got to, at first? It was just getting out.",
        "A: First of all -- right. F-For me, it was getting out, and -- and -- and -- and escaping the\nGermans. I had no background or predilection, politically speaking, about which group I\nwas going to -- to join.",
        "Q: And your -- your friend Thanassis --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- left because he couldn\u2019t get into that group, that group was not [indecipherable]",

        "Q: What do you -- what do you have, the two of you?",
        "A: We just have the clothes on our back.",
        "Q: Your clothes. You have a little money?",
        "A: We have just enough for the fare, which I had gotten the day before, and a -- a -- a few\nspare drachmas --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- you know, for something to -- to -- to eat.",
        "Q: And he did not say anything to his parents?",

        "A: Worse, right.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] he didn\u2019t say anything.",
        "A: And he was -- and he was the only child, as well, yes. So I can only imagine their horror,\ndismay, and so forth. So we got to the -- I want to call it bus station, there were no --\nthere was no bus station, it was a -- a place in Athens where all the -- the -- the trucks --\nbecause the o -- there were only trucks available to do that, and they w -- there was no\ngasoline. They were powered -- it was in the rear of the car or truck, a -- something like a\n-- a furnace where you burn wood, and the gases would be diverted to drive the pistons\nfor the engine. So we got there, and th-the usual thing was that first th-the goods were\npiled up on the truck, and then the passengers, in that particular case, for us it was about a\ndozen or so, simply sat on top of an open truck. And that\u2019s -- was the -- the only way to\ntravel.",
        "Q: Okay, I think we\u2019ll stop the tape --",
        "A: All right.",
        "Q: -- and when we begin next time, we\u2019 Il begin the journey into the mountains.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: Okay?",
        "A: Right.\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "Q: Isaac, when we -- we la -- the last part of the tape that we were on a few minutes ago, you\nwere getting on top of the flat bedded truck that has all of this material on it, and I gather\nthat these trucks were always going to the mountains? I mean, did they, or not?",
        "A: No, not to the mountains. They were essentially traveling from Athens to various towns\nor cities.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: And some of them was going also in other directions, from -- between other cities. It was\nprimarily commerce because there were no -- at that time there were no -- not only -- no\nhighways, as we know it, but even routes that an ordinary trucks, even with powerful\nengines, could possibly negotiate to go up mountains.",
        "Q: And so who\u2019s on, besides you, and --",
        "A: And Thanassis.",
        "Q: Thanassis, who -- just --",
        "A: People -- villagers who -- people who travel, I -- I imagine, because with the -- especially\nwith the advent of -- of the black market, or let -- let\u2019s call it the underground market,\nright? The villagers would bring things that -- that obviously are important to Athens,\nfood primarily, and in turn they would exchange it for goods of all kinds, and principally\ntextiles. Occasionally some light machinery, or -- that existed at that time. So, 1t was\nprimarily a commercial thing. Of course you had also -- excuse me -- not tourist, but\npassengers who visited relatives in Athens, or vice versa. These are generally the\n[indecipherable]. But I think all the -- the buses, if I can call them that, were -- that I saw\nat that time, because they were so laden with goods, and because they were so expensive,\nthey wanted to make sure that cargo would be transported, as well as passengers.",
        "Q: Did you have an I.D. card of some kind?",
        "A: Ah, as in -- im -- important, very interesting. It was necessary for me to get an I.D.\nBefore the German takeover of Athens, I had an I.D. with my real name, but now I had to\nf -- get a Greek identity, that\u2019s to say a Christian Orthodox 1 -- identity. Thanassis had a\nfriend who was a policeman, and I guess he was trustworthy enough to ask him to help\nme get an identity card. He was able to get the card itself, I gave him a photo, and he did\nthe appropriate thing of pasting the photograph in the appropriate place, plus filling out\nall the -- the other things. But there\u2019s wa -- there was one thing that had to be done to\nwhich he had no access. And the last thing was that the seal was embossed. But that seal\nwas only at headquarters. So he, having no access there, he told me, \u201cI regret it, but I\ncannot get you anything more than that.\u201d So before embarking on my trip, I took an old\ncoin, a pre-war five drachma piece, and I put it at the corner of the photograph and\nhammered it, so that it left an impression, because the coin, in it\u2019s face, had embossed\nletters, I\u2019m sure it had said Elliniki Dimokratia, Greek Republic. But it had to be some\nsemblance, so I think it would not have withstood the scrutiny even by an amateur, but\nfortunately the only two checkpoints we went through from -- after leaving Athens, to my\neventual destination in Kardhitsa, in Thessaly, it was during a driving rain. We were, of\ncourse, entirely soaked to the bone, on top of that -- those trucks, but by the same token,\nthe -- the guards, which were -- were Germans, with Greek police, didn\u2019t pay that much\nattention. So I didn\u2019t have to -- to do what I had promised my father I would do.",
        "Q: Now, Nehama must have been clearly a Jewish name.",
        "A: Oh yes, right.",
        "Q: Right? So you would have been too noticeable.",
        "A: Oh yes, my Greek name on that fake identity was Yannis, or John Dimokritos, which 1s a\nrather famous name of a -- of a Greek philosopher. In fact, the first one to declare, on no\nevidence at all, other than his -- his mind, the existence of an atom.",
        "Q: Atom, right, right. All right, so you\u2019re on this -- you go through two checkpoints --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- so you don\u2019t have to run away the way your father --",
        "A: My father --",
        "Q: -- has suggested you do if there\u2019s a problem.",
        "A: Right. But because, you know, those trucks, as I, I think mentioned, possibly in the last\ntape, they were not driven by a gasoline engine, but by burning wood. So they didn\u2019t\nhave that much of power. So it\u2019s another -- a long trip, and because of the rain, we then\nhad to stop in -- en route, in a town called Lamia, which is, you know, a sizeable town.\nSo we stopped there for the night.",
        "Q: And where did you stay that night?",
        "A: Well, we arrived there, because we were soaked, the first thing we thought was to dry\nourselves, so next to the station where we stopped, if you can call it the -- the bus station,\nwas a restaurant. We were very hungry. So, we went there, and really stood near the\nkitchen, so we could -- the heat would dry our clothes. And when we were ready to go\nout after the meal, to find a place to stay, a hotel, if there such a thing existed. But then\nthey told us in the restaurant, that in five minutes the curfew began. And it was patrolled\nby German patrols, and you shouldn\u2019t be found out walking after curfew time. So where\ndo we go? We had no place to go, but next to the -- to the restaurant was the -- I think the\none and only bordello in town, so that\u2019s where we ended up.",
        "Q: So tell -- so just because it\u2019s a little bit funny --",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: What was the situation, you go and you say we\u2019re two kids, and we have no place to stay,\nwill you let us stay here? Is that what you end up --",
        "A: Well, they welcome you, of course you are obliged to take a girl.",
        "Q: Aha, yes, really?",
        "A: Well sure, 0-otherwise you [indecipherable] alone for the entire night. I mean, they knew\nthat, of course the curfew had started, and so the price was appropriate for -- for night.",
        "Q: So this 1s a new experience?",
        "A: Yes, this was.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And you spent one night there?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did they feed you breakfast in the morning?",
        "A: Feed who? No, no, no, I di -- not -- at the place?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No, we just -- we -- we knew, were told that the -- the bus people would come around.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Because they knew some people probably were there [indecipherable |",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And -- because they wanted to -- to start early.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So we left a-around seven o\u2019clock, and -- first of all, I -- I think I -- probably you know\nthat in the Balkan countries, generally people don\u2019t have breakfast. If they have, they\nmay have a cup of coffee. I don\u2019t know if we had anything, so we just got on the bus,\nagain on the -- on the truck, and by the end of that second day, we arrived at our\ndestination, Kardhitsa.",
        "Q: And then what happened? [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, we alighted, and we got off. Now for us was -- was the end, and nearby was\n[indecipherable] Kardhitsa, although it was not part of quote, free Greece unquote, but it\nwas near enough the foothills of the mountains that there had been no Italian or German\npresence in Kardhitsa. This was voluntarily, they had left it, but it doesn\u2019t mean -- but it\nwas still -- still 1t was on the plains of Thessaly, 1t was not occupied by the partisans\neither. So let\u2019s call 1t a no-man\u2019s land.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So, the -- we -- we looked around, and we struck up a con -- a conversation with the\nteacher, a teacher in one of the schools of -- in Kardhitsa, and ha -- Thanassis, who had a\nspecific destination in mind, I think very quickly asked the -- the teacher, we\u2019re going to\ngo and join z -- Zervas, so where do we go to do that? And the teacher said, \u201cZervas was\naround this area, but that\u2019s a few months ago, and there\u2019s been some fighting with\nELAS,\u201d so that was the other side, \u201cand I\u2019m afraid that the nearest place that you can find\nZervas was Epirus,\u201d which is near the -- the Albanian border, which was very far away,\nand totally beyond our means, even if we could find transport to go there. We didn\u2019t\ndiscuss it very much more at that time, and the -- the teacher was really kind enough, we\ndidn\u2019t even ask him, but he offered to let us stay in his house overnight, and we could\ndecide what to do the following morning. So he offered us food and -- and lodging,\nwithout payment. When we -- we got up the following day, Thanassis apparently having\nreflected on -- on the situation, and he really didn\u2019t give me many reasons, but he said to -\n- to me, very clearly, \u201cI really cannot proceed any further. I understand that in your case,\u201d\n-- because the only other choice that was available is to join ELAS, who -- who were only\n30 or 40 kilometers away from Kardhitsa. \u201cI understand your situation, but I cannot, and I\nwill therefore return to Athens.\u201d But he had no more money, I had no money left. We\nembraced, I thanked him. We took I-leave of each other, and I mentally, visually, still\nremember seeing him walking, because even the directions, he wasn\u2019t going to take a\nhighway, there was no such thing, or a route, so he\u2019s following the railroad tracks. So I --\nI see the railroad tracks, and Thanassis walking. It\u2019s like a -- the end of a -- of a movie, as\nit fades, you know, in the -- in the background. So, I then asked the --",
        "Q: Let me -- let me ask you a question, though --",
        "A: Yeah? I\u2019m sorry, yes --",
        "Q: -- before you move on.",
        "A: All right.",
        "Q: How do you understand his decision now? Do you think it was because he didn\u2019t want to\njoin the -- the Communist group, he really wa -- wanted to join the other [indecipherable |",
        "A: The -- it -- the former, but let\u2019s be careful.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: ELAS was not a Communist group.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: In included, obviously, but it was not a Communist group.",
        "Q: Right, okay.",
        "A: Only for --",
        "Q: Right, no, no, that\u2019s important.",
        "A: Right, right. And, it\u2019s only --",
        "Q: So it wasn\u2019t anti-Communist?",
        "A: No, but --",
        "Q: So that it would include Communists?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Right. It was a coalition of leftist parties.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: There\u2019s no question that it was dominated by the -- the far left, because they were the best\norganized group of resistance, but EAM ala -- EAM was the political side, and ELAS\nwas the -- the military side.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But they were a conglomeration, and I met lots of people who had nothing to do with the\nCommunists up there. Perhaps later on, but it\u2019s -- it\u2019s appropriate now for me to tell you,\nbecause you asked me this question about Thanassis, that at the end of the war, when I\nreturned to Athens, within a couple of weeks there was the so-called troubles, between\nthe central government, now liberated. And I had not even had the chance to visit him\nand his parents, and thank them, and tell them that I have survived, and everything like\nthat, because this problem arose, where the streets now, there\u2019s shooting going on\nbetween factions. And it was at the end of December, after my return from concentration\ncamp, the British concentration camp, [indecipherable] in Egypt, that I learned that\nThanassis was killed during this month of -- or couple of weeks of trouble. So here again,\nin a different vein as my mother, here is another case of somebody who went with me, I\ndidn\u2019t have a chance to see him ag -- again after we -- we parted, but there\u2019s no question\nthat he was really a member of an extremely rabid right wing group. And therefore, it\nwould have been unthinkable for him to -- to -- to -- to join --",
        "Q: To join, yeah. But -- but even being a member of such an extreme right wing group didn\u2019t\nmean he wouldn\u2019t help you as a Jew.",
        "A: No question.",
        "Q: There -- that there -- the anti-Semitism was nothing in his situation.",
        "A: No, no, nothing. These thing, they\u2019re two separate things.",
        "Q: -- things. All right, so -- okay.",
        "A: So that\u2019s cr -- Thanassis 1s gone now, unfortunately.",
        "Q: Yes [indecipherable]. So he goes, and now you have to [indecipherable]",
        "A: I asked the teacher, I said, well -- and he -- he -- it was very easy. He says, \u201cDo you see\nthe top of this mountain?\u201d And he pointed west, almost straight due west. \u201cThat\u2019s where\nyou go.\u201d And that\u2019s what it is. I just following that kind of thing, I began on the road,\nwhich is in the beginning a g -- visible road, and it fades into a -- a kind of a track, and it\ntook close to five hours to negotiate that. And I was reaching -- I could see the monastery\nbecoming bigger and bigger. But the biggest shock was just I think half an hour before I\nwent -- I got to the grounds of the monastery te -- all of the surrounding area of trees,\nforest, grass, all that, is filled up with Italian soldiers, but all of them armed. And I\u2019m\nwalking through, and I see partisans with beards talking to the Italians. Now, I know\nthere was an armistice, but of course I had no idea what had happened in the -- between,\nand I -- I -- especially armed Italians. But -- well, subsequently I learned it was a -- a\nregiment of Italian cavalry called Aosta, from the region in Italy, that voluntarily joined\nthe -- the partisans. And course I had more dealings with them. And so I got to the -- to\nthe monastery.",
        "Q: Did they stop you, these soldiers, as you were walking --",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, they just chatting, and passing the day.",
        "Q: And here\u2019s this kid walking?",
        "A: And this -- this kid walking, and I reached the monastery, I saw a number of partisans,\nand some of them -- it was still early afternoon, the sun is still shining, although it\u2019s close\nto November. It was a warm day. And I don\u2019t know why they were naked to the waist,\nbut I learned subsequently why. But I asked to go and see the leader. And I was shown up\nto the leader, a tall man with a long beard. And I immediately -- I briefly told him that I\nhad come to join the partisans. He didn\u2019t laugh [indecipherable]",
        "Q: He didn\u2019t laugh [indecipherable]",
        "A: He didn\u2019t laugh, but -- but at least he -- he smiled, he says, \u201cLook, th-this is -- this is\nextremely rough life, you are very young.\u201d And then, just as simply, I told him that I had\nno choice. I\u2019m a Jew, and the Germans are -- are persecuting us, and I cannot return to\nAthens. He says, \u201cAll right, stay. Stay.\u201d And that was the end of it. Tha --",
        "Q: Did you also tell him that you had been a Boy Scout, as if that might be --",
        "A: Yes, tha -- to convince him, yes, I told him I was a Boy Scout, he -- he laughed.",
        "Q: Did he laugh?",
        "A: Yes, he laughed. Then I went to the yard again, and finally I got enough courage to ask,\nbecause then I began to observe the partisans who were naked to the midriff, because\nthey were feeling their shirts. And I know what they were doing, they were killing lice,\nokay\u2019? They were delousing themselves, just -- and I, for me it was such a -- a -- a new\nthing to see fact, that I asked one of them who was doing it, how many had he killed. He\nlooked at me. Oh, such a crazy question. He didn\u2019t count. But to -- to sort of\n[indecipherable] he said, \u201c47.\u201d Such a great number. Little did I know that very quickly, I\nwill be doing exactly the same thing.",
        "Q: So did -- did the leader, the -- of this particular part of the resistance immediately say you\ncan do x or y, or --",
        "A: No, no. I mean, he [indecipherable] all right, but we\u2019Il have to decide what we -- you\u2019re\ngoin -- we\u2019re gonna have you do. But almost immediately, the following day, I was then\nassigned the -- if I can call it the graveyard shift of being a telephone -- telephone\noperator. These telephones were military field telephones, strung with wires. And there\nwas a little room, this was a -- in a monastery, a former monastery, there were cells on all\nfloors. And there was a little telephone room. Now, my shift started around 11 o\u2019clock at\nnight. Before going there, I had to go to the commissary, or what -- yeah, to get a little tin\ncontainer that was filled with rough kerosene oil, because that was the only light that was\n[indecipherable], they had no electricity. So -- so we had this lamp with a wick. And I\nknew from the very first day after -- at the end of my shift, my throat, nose, and\neverything else were black, I would spit black stuff. I\u2019m inhaling the smoke that came out\nof that wick during -- during the -- the shift. Of course, when the phone would ring, then I\nwould respond, take notes. Times I was given messages to -- well, I remember the -- the\nsecond night, before starting my shift, again I was going to the commissary, but I have to\n-- to remind me -- myself and you that when you -- the first noticeable thing when you\nare in the mountains, and anyplace is how black and dark it is. In cities, even in a\ndarkened place, the glow of city lights still there. But in the mountains, two things are\nimmediately noticeable. The silence is deafening, literally, you hear nothing. That\u2019s why\nyou can hear things from a distance. And it\u2019s also very dark. But there were no lights in\nthe monastery corridors. So I\u2019m going to the mo -- to the commissary to fill my lamp\nwith oil, and then the first thing I know is one leg is going through a hole, and then\ninstinctively the other leg is going through a hole, and I\u2019m falling through space. And in -\n- in the middle of the fall, I hit a -- a beam on the side, and after a couple of other\nseconds, it was -- actually it only took a few seconds, I fell through two floors. And I -- I\nmust have screamed, in the process of falling, and they came running. I just got up.",
        "Q: You were --",
        "A: And they -- and they all marvel, and they thought that it was a miracle that it happened,\nthey said to me that you\u2019re -- I was particularly lucky.",
        "Q: So that was your introduction.",
        "A: My introduction, and I stayed on on that particular job for about two weeks. And then for\nthe following two weeks, I was then made a messenger. I had to take messages to -- but\nto division headquarters. And the higher in rank was the military unit, the higher was also\nphysically, in the mountains, the division was higher and higher. And this is when I was\ngiven a rifle, I was given -- was an Italian rifle, and -- a -- a -- two rounds of -- of --",
        "Q: Ammunition?",
        "A: Ammunition. Then I was then given the messages, and I was given the general direction\nof a -- just march that way. And I didn\u2019t know whether my destination was, and we\nwould meet an occasional shepherd tending goats or sheep, and you would say, how long\nis, and then mention the name of the place, and he would say half an hour. They have no\nconception of time in terms of the units that we use. You walk for another three hours,\nand it\u2019s still not there. And that\u2019s what I did for the next week or so.",
        "Q: Now what --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Let me ask you something. Do you become a messenger because you\u2019ve done your\ntelephone operator job so well, or did they just happen to need [indecipherable |",
        "A: No, they -- th-they -- they just -- they -- they decided that now they needed somebody to\ncarry messages, and I became available, or I could be spared from the telephone thing.\nAfter all, as I said, there were three shifts, because the thing had to be tended all the time.\nAnd that\u2019s when I became a messenger, but when I returned from the last trek in\ndelivering a message, then there was a general retreat, because the Germans decided,\nwhich they did periodically, to do a sweep. And in fact, we could begin to see, at the\ndistance, the trucks coming up, and armored vehicles, you know, because they didn\u2019t\nhave tanks, or anything like that. And -- but this what -- what happened throughout the\noccupation, the Italians would sweep up from time to time. Sometimes light sweeps,\nsometimes very heavy. And this was a heavy sweep, so we are retreating. So, the\nmonastery was evacuated, the Italian soldiers also accompanied us, and we\u2019re going\nhigher and higher. There was no action, other than occasionally firing a gun out toward\nthe Germans, but we don\u2019t engage heavily armed enemy, that\u2019s not what partisan war 1s.\nAnd after about two or three weeks of going higher than, the Germans decided that they\nhad done as much damage as they -- they could, which really didn\u2019t do anything other\nthan burning some villages, they went back to the -- to the plains. And that\u2019s when, then,\nI was able to join a -- a real unit rather than a band, th-th-the -- the -- the -- the group that\nI saw in the monastery was a portion of a major unit, which the first regiment of\nThessaly, and the first regiment of Evzones, to which then I became -- I -- I joined.",
        "Q: Let me ask you something. Did you, when you became a messenger, did you wear special\nclothes, or you were wearing the clothes you came in?",
        "A: I\u2019m still having -- there were no clothes to go around, you know.",
        "Q: Right. So you\u2019re still wearing [indecipherable]",
        "A: I\u2019m still in the civilian clothes, which are beginning now to -- to tatter, and --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- also get dirty, and filthy, where I was able to scare up another pair of underwear to -- to\nchange, [indecipherable] if I see things of that kind. That\u2019s it. I still remember that\nfortunately, I don\u2019t know why, I had traveled from Athens to Kardhitsa wearing also a --\na blue overcoat, which was sort of a lined overcoat, maybe a treated fabric that will\nwithstand rain, but it was a very, very handy thing, because I went through a whole heavy\nwinter in -- with -- with only these clothes.",
        "Q: And the rifle that you were given, were you trained on the rifle?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: They just gave it to you?",
        "A: They gave me the rifle [indecipherable] you know, the -- the -- the cartridges were in a\nclip, five to a clip, and they -- they pull the -- I forget now all these terms which I f --\nknow from the army, and you push the clip down, push the bolt back again, and you are\nready to fire. I had never fired a rifle, and I still remember I\u2019m marching about an hour\naway from the monastery. I\u2019m in the middle of a natural plateau in the middle of the\nmountain, there\u2019s nobody around. Total silence. And I fire the first bullet of my life, just\nto -- to even get familiar with the sound. I didn\u2019t fire at anybody --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- was toward -- towards the sky. But I -- that\u2019s the first time I fired.",
        "Q: All right, let\u2019s stop the tape.\nEnd of Tape #5\nTape #6",
        "Q: -- you\u2019re at a very high point in the mountains and you\u2019ve joined a real regiment, I\ngather.",
        "A: Right. I should have go-got interviewed by an officer, not -- he was not the commanding\nofficer of the regiment, and I think they are probably debating about what -- to have me\ndo. Certainly I was not either trained, or old enough to join a -- a -- a fighting unit. And\nthen, the -- the same afternoon, I am called to go and talk to the second in command. Let\nme parenthetically note that in ELAS there was always dual leadership. There was the\nmilitary commander -- I don\u2019t want to -- I -- th-the -- the -- the second in command, it\nwas not a rank, but he was the equivalent of a political officer. If you want to call it a\ncommissar, right? Well, they were called captanios, which 1s a gen -- generic name for\ncaptain, or -- or an officer of some rank. So I go to his office, and he told me that he has\nan important mission for me. He didn\u2019t know me, but he had ler -- known that I was from\nAthens, that I spoke French, and some Spanish, was a very important mission. He says,\n\u201cEvery year, the little rivlets, or even creeks, which are dry most of the year, but in\nspring, after the snows fall, then these creeks flood, and even the little rivers flood, and --\nand always there are people who drown. Now, our mission, or the mission I\u2019m going to\nentrust you with is this. Because we don\u2019t know when the next sweep is going to come,\nand we want to be sure that our line of retreat is available to us, we don\u2019t want to have to\nford something that\u2019s not passable. So what I want you to do is, I\u2019m going to put you in\ncharge here,\u201d I\u2019m 16 and a half years old, \u201cput you in charge of a -- a group. And there\u2019 Il\nbe two Italian officers, they are both engineers. And your mission is to go to a number of\nvillages,\u201d which had -- he had written down, near some of those rivers. \u201cAnd you will tell\nthem that you have orders for the village people to help you do two things. First, cut\ndown trees to provide material for building the bridge. The Italian officers would\nmeasure, and find the appropriate place, and then you would -- the villagers would help\nwith labor to cut the logs, and also with material such as nails, and things like this, as\nwell as labor, to assemble the bridge.\u201d And so he gave me official orders signed,\nwhatever it was, I don\u2019t even know if it -- there was a seal. So -- and then I was\nintroduced, there were in the outside, these two men, who had officer uniforms. They\nwere also armed, you know? Now, I did not know Italian, but between French and\nLadino, I could make out a few things, and we could begin to understand each other. I\nthink they had been briefed -- that\u2019s now th-the word, about what the -- the mission was.\nAnd so, the following morning, you have the Nehama group walking to our destination.\nAnd it took us --",
        "Q: This -- this --",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: Isn\u2019t this rather unusual, to have a 16 and a half year old who -- who -- who hasn\u2019t been\nin this group for more than four or five weeks?",
        "A: Look, I -- I can only speculate that probably it was either a stupid, half-baked idea, or it\nwas a Serious idea, but a half-baked notion of how to implement it. Or, it 1s not they\nwanted to get rid of me, you know, from there, but I -- the -- the -- the -- the plausible\nexplanation is that 1 -- this was a real need, all right? That was not the only way to skin\nthat particular cat, or fording a bridge, but they thought, why don\u2019t we take advantage of -\n- because the military engineers are trained to do things like this using what locally\navailable materials are. So, it was not a crazy notion of trying to build -- and we aren\u2019t\ntalking about large rivers, I\u2019m talking maybe the biggest one that we -- we would have\nhad to do was for to five meters, which is 15 - 20 feet. Not -- we weren\u2019t talking about\nhuge things. So, the -- the -- the notion was certainly plausible, and necessary, you know,\nin order to maintain, you know, open slide of communication. You don\u2019t want to be\nretreating, and then suddenly have your backs to the river. But, I mean, if they wanted to\ndo it very seriously, they wouldn\u2019t have sent a 16 and a half year old boy, they would\nhave something else, maybe another contingent of two or three, who would then also\nparticipate in the actual building. But --",
        "Q: Up to this point, these few weeks that you\u2019re in the group, do some of the older men\nbefriend you? I mean, do you feel s --",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: They do?",
        "A: Oh yes [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So you -- they wi --",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: -- they welcome you in?",
        "A: Right, right, yeah.",
        "Q: And do they, in some sense try to ta -- you\u2019re the youngest person there, right?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: And there are no women, it\u2019s all boys -- men? Or are there women?",
        "A: Ah, there are women, but I didn\u2019t see them yet --",
        "Q: Aha, okay.",
        "A: -- in the partisans, until after the end of that mission that failed, right.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] okay. So you feel very comfortable with these people?",
        "A: Sure, yes.",
        "Q: And --",
        "A: I share their life --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I eat with them, we talk.",
        "Q: Now, all this time, of course, you are still preoccupied in some way with what\u2019s\nhappening to the family?",
        "A: Yes, I\u2019m preoccupied, but it\u2019s the kind of a thing that th -- 1s -- is -- I don\u2019t -- I have no\ncontact left any more. I\u2019m thinking of them, but it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a kind of thought that goes\nnowhere, because there is nothing I can do in trying some method of trying to get news\nfrom them, either deliver my news, or their news. So I -- so that I\u2019m getting adjusted even\nto the notion of being out of contact.",
        "Q: Do they ask you about your family, these guys?",
        "A: Look, I don\u2019t think we spoke very much. I mean, occasionally the conversation would\ncome back, because later on, when I was part of a real, ongoing military unit, after thes --\nthis mission of -- that I returned from. And there was a large contingent of regimental\nheadquarters, where we were really living, and staying together, and talking. Then we\nstarted exchanging, but in the first month or two, most of the time we are talking about is\n-- first of all, the next preoccupation, or the only preoccupation is what are you going to\neat, because there 1s no food to be had there. This 1s not a unit where you\u2019re going to go\nfor chow, when something rings, you have to scrounge for things. So most of the th -- of\nthe time, and necessarily is you\u2019re thinking about only one thing, survival.",
        "Q: All right, let\u2019s -- describe this -- it ends up being a somewhat --",
        "A: Oh, right.",
        "Q: -- failed mission of bridges.",
        "A: Failed mission. Very briefly we went to the first village, I approached the teacher, I\nshowed him the orders. And they said, sure, sure. The following morning we will gather,\nsure, sure, because they put us up for the evening. They were a little skittish I could see in\ntheir eyes of that -- of having to b -- to also host two Italian officers, armed. Because you\ngot to remember, for the previous two years, that region -- you know from time to time\nyou would have incursions of Italians who would burn their villages. I mean, I saw the\nrems of that, the hulks of -- of just nothing but walls with -- with the open sky. But at\nleast they did not a-attack us. They would put us up. But they wouldn\u2019t show up. And\nalthough tried to get [indecipherable] would say again following morning, the long and\nthe short is we went through two or three other villages with almost identical results. But\nthe -- the third or fourth village, it was just, I think, after Christmas of \u201943, maybe\nDecember 28 or 29. We got to this village, and -- although the sa -- the story was the\nsame tomorrow, but they didn\u2019t put us up in a house in that -- in that village. Instead they\nguided us something like close to a half an hour walk from the village. And in the middle\nof nowhere there was a little barn, and it was two stories. And in the lower part was a\ntethered donkey, and the upper was just a -- a room, but it had a fireplace. So he says,\n\u201cThis 1s where you\u2019re going to -- to stay for your -- during your stay.\u201d All right. So that\u2019s\nwhere we slept the first night. When we got up the following morning, it had begun to\nsnow incessantly, which continued for a week. Now, very quickly we were totally\nsnowbound. Fortunately -- I mean, the way we survived is once a day, around midday or\nso, a poor, elderly woman from the village would trudge all that distance, with a sack of\nroughly ground corn flour. And that\u2019s our subsistence, we would take the corn flour and\nmelt some snow, knead it into some kind of a dough, and pat it to a semblance of a bread,\nand then we would burn it on the fireplace. That\u2019s what we ate. Now, the -- I think the\nsecond week, she brought us an egg. And we were, of course, you know, we haven\u2019t seen\nanything like this, and we were overjoyed, but very quickly we decided that it would be --\nto divide it into three -- I mean, we would not even feel it in our mouths. So we decided\nto keep it as a symbol of our eventual deliverance, both from the snow outside of that\n[indecipherable] the mission as well as the war, because -- and then I continue, very\nquickly, I mean we used the egg to play games with the mice. The mice would come out\nat night, because it was the gallery of all the [indecipherable]. And we had not thought,\nwe had left the egg someplace, and then in the glow of -- still of the fire -- we used to go\nout and gather branches, and burn them. We saw how mice steal the egg. One mouse\ntakes it in 1t\u2019s paws, and sort of -- and the others drag it by the tail. So we discovered the\ngame, so we used to take the egg, and have bets made, and races. We would leave it like\nthis, and then we see the mouse come, and we say -- the bet was how fast he will get to\nthe hole, of course, by the time he reached the hole, we grab the egg again, and -- so\nthat\u2019s the way -- and that\u2019s how I began to learn Italian because spending all day long, we\nused to sing Italian songs. And I clearly remember the first day that -- when the s-snow\nended, it was the kind of a thing that you know when the snow clears, and the -- the sky is\ncompletely s -- cloud free, and bright, blinding brightness because of the white, and we\nheard that drone of aircraft, which was an incredible sound. And we look up, and we see\nhuge formations of bombers, which we di -- concluded couldn\u2019t be anything but allied,\nbecause the Germans didn\u2019t have very much of an air force. And -- and -- and -- and I\nthink in retrospect, because we -- I know I can tell you, I can -- the direction which they\nwere flying, namely northeast, they probably were coming from Italy to bomb the oil\nfields in Ploesti in Romania. So, you know, we could almost -- the kind of a thing that we\nall three of us looked up, and -- and sort of begged that the day will come for us very\nquickly. So, after -- after the second week there, we, you know, concluded that we were\nnot going to get anywhere, especially now since the ground was covered with snow, even\nif things had changed, the attitude had changed. So, we -- I had lost also a sense of\norientation where we were. Where is the nearest partisan unit? We had been on the road\nfor practically a month. So I was told, and we were pointed to some direction, and we got\nthere, and the first person I saw was Saby Shabetai, my friend and neighbor from our\napartment in Athens. I approached him, I addressed him, he turned around, he says,\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d And when I told him, he was, you know, horrified, dismayed. I must\nhave been filthy, in rags, you know, uncombed, literally dirty, because we had no means\nof bathing, washing, or anything like that, as well as, of course, hungry. But -- so that\u2019s\nwas regimental headquarters, and that\u2019s the unit I then became part of for the remaining\nof my --",
        "Q: And he was part of that unit",
        "A: No, no, he was --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Saby told me very quickly -- Saby, he was a very clever fellow, but he didn\u2019t have any\ntraining like I did. He was two years older. He became a spy. And that was, he would --\nhe would go to Trikala, wer -- w-wearing decent civilian clothes, and I guess he -- there\nmust have been contacts, and he would stay with them, but he would -- the spy part was\nthey try to find out movements. Are there convoys of trucks, or is there a train that\u2019s\ncoming, passing, that\u2019s laden. So that if there would be any action to be taken against\neither a convoy of trucks, or a con -- or -- or blow up a train, [indecipherable], the British\nhad much greater network of intelligence 1n Greece, and all the major actions that took\nplace was always because the British knew, and then they would -- they would agree with\nthe guerrillas, to blow up a train, or to destroy a bridge, the [indecipherable] the most\nmajor action was done at the request of the British. And a big viaduct was blown up. That\nwas quite a few months before my arrival. During my time, there were two actions of\nblowing up bridges in the area where my regiment operated. I was not involved in that.",
        "Q: So when you, or the ra -- do you end up being able to take a shower or something, 1s it\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: Eventually, yes, I took a bath, there were no showers, a -- a bath, and -- and given a --\nactually, we were -- the pants I had -- oh, and then, I had lost my shoes, because in fo --\nin fording up one of the rivers, I was told by a partisan, which is true in all armies, that\nwhen you are going to cross a river, tie the shoelaces, and tie them around the rifle, and\nhold them like that. So I don\u2019t know, maybe I didn\u2019t tie them well enough, and we\u2019re in\nthe middle of this little rivlet, this little stream, but it\u2019s quite swift, and one of the shoes\nfalls, and I -- I see disappearing down, and it\u2019s going too fast for me to do anything. So I\nwas left with one shoe. So I thought, okay, I will wear only one shoe, but it\u2019s bad,\nbecause then you begin to hurt all over. So I threw the other one out, and I was barefoot.\nAll of this time, the snow, and so forth, it was -- I was totally barefoot. But the pants\nsurvived, after my return, after they were washed by a villager. And I was given a tunic.\nAt the top -- a tunic, an Italian soldiers tunic, but no shoes, but a -- a villager gave me\npigskin shoes, it\u2019s just a piece of pigskin, which is then pierced, and tied with -- with\nstring. Which is all right, it\u2019s like a ballet slipper that you use, which 1s fine. But two\nweeks later, when I was asleep, a dog ate one of the shoes, because it was food for them.",
        "Q: So, did you get frostbite on your feet? Did you --",
        "A: Fortunately not, you know, the feet would get very, very cold, and the -- the -- the\nItalians, you know, maybe they had been taught, or they knew, they were much, of\ncourse, older than I am, to rub -- rub them with snow. And if you do that, I don\u2019t think\nit\u2019s the rubbing with snow, but rubbing them fast, it just restores the blood circulation.\nThis is what you have to make sure, you know, fortunately I didn\u2019t get frostbite. But three\nweeks after my arrival at headquarters, I got, you know, pleurisy, a very bad cold, I mean,\nwhen a little bit of fluid collects in -- in the pleura, not the lungs, but in the pleura. And --\nbut there was a ni -- a little infirmary, and had an Italian doctor, I can still remember him,\nhe was a -- a short, very intelligent looking Sicilian. He was almost entirely black, from\nbrown skin, but very, very capable, very clever with -- practically had no facilities, but\ntook care of his patients.",
        "Q: Was -- did he misdiagnose what was wrong with you?",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Everything was -- was fine.",
        "Q: Well, what did they give you for this?",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "Q: Nothing.",
        "A: Just simply to be covered, you know, with additional blankets. They -- they had no --\nthere -- there were no medicines to be had. Sulfa was beginning to be known at that time,\nand of course, they were equipped in their own army, but we didn\u2019t have su-such\nsupplies.",
        "Q: So you were sick what, for a week, 10 days, something like this?",
        "A: Yes, unfortunately be -- behind -- 1t was in a -- in a abandoned church, an old church, and\nso looking out of the window was the cemetery. It was not a -- and I remember another\nfellow patient and I were talking, and we were s -- thinking that, well okay, they won\u2019t\nhave very far to travel if we have to end up there.",
        "Q: So you get another job?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: After you get sick?",
        "A: After I got sick and recover, I was --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- because by that time, there was also another transformation that had taken place a few\nmonths before my arrival in the partisans, namely the partisans became organized as a\nmodern army, with echelons, distinct divisions, regiments, battalions, companies. At least\non paper, all right? And -- whereas before, these were independent units, marauding,\ndoing whatever they could, but this was put on a much more professional footing,\nbecause by that time, the -- the man in command of the entire ELAS was General\nSarafias, who was a professional military officer before the war. So when I then was\nassigned to the regiment -- now the -- the regimental commander was a -- a man who\npermanent [indecipherable] was a major in the former Greek army, by the name of\nKarfis. And he happened to have as an adjutant, a recent graduate of the military -- Greek\nmilitary academy. So he was the usual, you know, not spit and polish, because we didn\u2019t\nhave the things for that, but saluting, although there wasn\u2019t s-so much saluting with the\npartisans, you know. The method of addressing each other was synagonistis, which\nmeans fellow fighter. It was -- it wasn\u2019t comrade, it wasn\u2019t mister. It was even t -- with an\nofficer of superior rank, you would address him as fellow fighter, and then his name. So,\nbecause I think of the fact that my background, finishing high school, command of a\nlanguage, and so forth, I was given a -- a clerical job, primarily enciphelment -- codes.\nBecause by that time, there were even radios, and nearby, because very near the\nregimental place, there was the -- the airfield, if I can call it that, 1t was just a bare piece\nof ground, but it was situated in the natural plateau, the one that I fired, remember?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: My first rifle. And when in the su -- in the summer months, when the | -- land was dry,\nthen it was able to support the weight of an aircraft, and they would fly them over there,\nfrom Egypt, and for missions back and forth. And because of the proximity, then there\nwas a permanent detachment of British officers, liaison officers, that have been\nparachuted, or brought by aircraft, next to our regimental headquarters. So at times, I\nwould then be asked to go -- I did not know English, but some of them, some of the\nEnglish officers knew French, and I was able to converse. Plus they were the only ones\nthat had long range, short wave radios. You know, the rest of -- I mean, the partisans,\nonly division had a radio, and in our headquarters we didn\u2019t have a radio in the\nbeginning, so everything had to be through again, field telephony. But by then, it was\nnecessary, because of certain engagements, to encode messages, and so I was pressed in\nthat job.",
        "Q: Did you like that job? Was it interesting?",
        "A: Well, you know, no clerical job is interesting, everything becomes routine a little bit, but\nit was -- the thing that that -- am-amazed me 1s that after awhile, I didn\u2019t have to look at\nthe decoding book to decode text. I had begun to learn, and -- and visualize the -- the\ndecipherment -- th-the [indecipherable] and -- but I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t want to sh -- people\nto see that, because, you know, I was told that -- that, you know, if you eventually\nmemorize it, then -- then you -- if you are ever caught, then under torture you may reveal\nthe codes, although I\u2019m sure that the things that they had to communicate were not of\nmomentous strategic im-importance to --",
        "Q: But they would also change the codes",
        "A: Yeah, but -- bu-but, you do that -- we didn\u2019t have -- 1n all that -- I\u2019m talking about\npractically from February through November, practically the nine months that I -- my\nremain -- stayed with the partisans service, we changed codes routinely only twice. So\nthere wasn\u2019t that kind of a [indecipherable] because I don\u2019t think they were high level\ncodes. But they were important to us, and -- well, th-that was not the only thing I had to\ndo. Then the adjutant orders had to be typed. We had -- we found a ramshackle\ntypewriter, and some paper. I was the only one who was able to use that and type some\norders.",
        "Q: So you had learned typing, sort of?",
        "A: Sort of. More of the two or three fingers, which I still have to use today.",
        "Q: So, I\u2019ve -- how are things now, is this unit now going out and doing sabotage, or is it\nquiet, and that\u2019s not what you\u2019re doing [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, no, no, no. Again, because it was regimental headquarters -- now, it\u2019s fighting units,\nand sabotage are in the region. I mean, if I drew a circle, it would probably cover, you\nknow, a radius of 50 - 60 kilometers. 40 miles, you know, because the [indecipherable]\nadjacent things. By that time, in the beginning of the partisan war, the major things that\nthe partisans had to do -- wa-wanted to do, was A, kill known collaborators, primarily to\nelevate the morale of the people. You know, begin to give them a sense that there are\npeople who are protecting them. That those who collaborate with the enemy are going to\nget their just desserts. And because you cannot fight heavy engagements, there were\noccasional skirmishes, and fi -- and attacks with -- with isolated Italian, or -- or German\nunits. But in our sector, when we begun to do a systematic thing of attacking convoys\nbecause our unit was the nearest to the main road that goes from Trikala to eventually\nKardhitsa, and then Lamia, and so forth, to south [indecipherable] Greece. So that -- that\nwas essentially the -- the -- the mission, if I can call it, of the regiment. We -- we never\ngot engaged. We don\u2019t do that with the -- the light weapons. The heaviest weapons I\nremember we had in the whole regiment was two heavy machine guns. You can\u2019t engage\nan enemy that has armory units, with two heavy machine guns.",
        "Q: Okay, we\u2019ve come to the end of the tape.",
        "A: All right.\nEnd of Tape #6\nTape #7",
        "Q: Are you getting news about the front? I mean clearly the -- the -- there\u2019s a turn 1n the war,\nand there\u2019s been a turn in the war since \u00b043, or late \u201942.",
        "A: Right, well, most of the spring, we knew -- first of all to us, through the British\nconnection, primarily, as well as independently, the Greek connections, because of\ncourse, division talk to the agency in Athens, or the top command of ELAS. So -- but it\nwould come to us two or three weeks late. So it primarily still involves the -- the\ncampaign in Italy. The -- the great event occurs June six, when Normandy occurs in the\nwar. We -- we get also news of the eastern front. But that was the -- the -- the first major\nevent. That really didn\u2019t have an immediate effect, other than si -- psychological, that\nnow these two great parts of the allies are converging. But I think through a -- the stream\nof -- of messages coming from division, and from ELAS headquarters, definitely show an\nincrease in the pace of operations, for two reasons. First of all, visibly, from reports,\nGermans are abandoning smaller towns, and concentrating in major arteries now. Why\nwould they do that, since no -- no -- nobody thought that the Greece itself was about to be\ninvaded by allied troops. So -- so that was one -- one reason. Then, also, the news began\nto -- to trickle down again. We had more contact even from tiko partisans, who had much\nbetter communications, and already we began to see that the Russians are approaching\nthe silent part of Europe, namely the Balkans, and it doesn\u2019t take a strategic, Napoleonic\nmind, a short look at the map indicates that -- because Greece is al-almost like a\npeninsula, the bottom of the Balkans, if the Russians were advancing that much, I think\nwhich eventually what happened is that the Germans would have an untenable position in\nthis. So, this explains why the Germans were consolidating their lines, and because in the\nmeantime, attempts had been made by the British mission to try to unite the warring\nfactions of the Greek resistance. And eventually, in the -- in June or July of \u201944, there was\na--as--a signed agreement that was signed by representatives in the Middle East, in\nLebanon, I believe, Beirut, which then held until the end of the war. So -- so we had this\npace going on. But again, the day to day life for -- for us, food was very scarce, as usual,\nalthough it was regimental headquarters, th-they didn\u2019t grow crops or -- or other food.\nAlso clothing, and -- and -- and sanitary conditions were not -- I mean, if you went to\nsleep at night, especially in -- in the winter, well in the middle of the night, you know,\npeople are getting -- or you sleep on the floor, people are getting up and stepping\n[indecipherable] sometimes on bodies, make their way to -- to go out, maybe to relieve\nthemselves. But very often it was not for that reason. You would go up, and open the\ntunic to let the cold air come in to quiet the lice, because in sleeping ne -- bodies next to\neach other, the lice begin to get warm, and begin to -- to move, and you -- it\u2019s not\nparticularly pleasant, and to quieten them again, you go out, open the tunic, let the cold\nin, and they quiet for a bit, and you sleep for another hour or two. Th-This -- this -- this\npersisted until when it became real warm in the mountains, May, June, and on, because\nthen you could go bathe in the streams, and that would -- we used to do that every day,\nand at times it effectfully -- eventually happened to me later on, a month or two later,\nwhen I went swimming, and I had been perspiring, running to get to the place to swim,\nand I must have caught a cold, which was then misdiagnosed as malaria, and I had other\nproblems. But this was -- the pace noticeably started. There were more action from our\nunits in the [indecipherable], plus the -- the clear indication where they had come from\nheadquarters in the Middle East, or from ELAS headquarters, to harass Germans, even\nnotably those who were retreating and going north, but not to attempt any major action,\neven if we were able to. The reason being that they didn\u2019t want to infuriate the Germans,\nbecause fay -- they didn\u2019t really have to infuriate them, they were doing that anyhow in\nmany cases, namely, a scorched earth policy, they attempted to blow up the port facilities\nin Pireas, and it was only a last minute action by the partisans in the city, that averted the\nblowing up of port facilities in Pireas. So -- so noticeably we saw the pace accelerate.",
        "Q: Did you want to join them?",
        "A: I?",
        "Q: Yes. Would --",
        "A: I hadn\u2019t seen any action, I -- only action I saw was a -- a month later, which was -- came\nout in -- inadvertently. I don\u2019t think I had -- I -- I knew that it wasn\u2019t a question of\nroughness or the danger, but that really I had no experience, and I had seen enough of\nwhat had been going on to know that I should not be entrusted with lack of appropriate\ntraining, on -- on anything major.",
        "Q: Let me go back for a moment.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: There wasn\u2019t that much food, but you all were smoking cigarettes, which\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, food was always, I think once a day. And most of the time, because that which was\n-- was available were -- I still remember them, black eyed -- they look like black eyed\npeas, or black eyed beans. But these were from old, even sometimes abandoned\ngovernmental warehouses. There -- the villagers would make flour available, whatever\nthey were able to do. And those things were usually spoiled rotten, and you\u2019d find little\ncrawling worms inside, but not after boiling, we used to joke that we would eat meat also,\nwhile eating the -- the beans. But, again, rel-relief would come from hunger in -- in the\nsummertime, when -- because of vegetables [indecipherable] vegetables. I forgot what\nyou asked me --",
        "Q: I was asking about cigarettes [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah. Well, the only way to relieve hunger --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- and that\u2019s where I learned to smoke, but we didn\u2019t have tobacco. So you would take\nleaves from trees, and dry them, and crunch them, and usually find a piece of newspaper.\nIn -- in the area where we were, a governmental warehouse had been raided and tons,\nliterally tons of contraband cigarette paper, which was -- used to be sold legally to roll\ncigarettes, had been found. But because it had been contraband, it was so massive, you\ncannot burn paper so easily, as you know, even in fireplace, if you put a book, it takes --\nit\u2019s hard to burn it. So, the government had fumigated these warehouses with sulfur,\nwhich had permeated the cigarette paper, so if you use that, which was from some\nrespects easy, but it stunk, and smelled, and tasted of sulfur so much, we use newspaper.\nThe problem with the newspaper is you take a puff, and it -- a flame at the end of the\nthing, instead of burning as a [indecipherable] a flame burning. And this is the reason\nwhy, it was primarily to assuage hunger.",
        "Q: So it was very difficult to actually do that --",
        "A: Right, right, yeah.",
        "Q: -- given the circumstances.",
        "A: Later on, occasionally, somebody would find -- because that region of Greece also is a\ntobacco growing region, which wa -- we were able to find tobacco [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Now, were you finding that in the villages in spite of your bridge failure --",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: -- that people were supporting the partisans, or not?",
        "A: Oh yes, there is no question, because first of all, there is no question that without the\nsupport of the -- the people who had suffered a great deal, who also knew that harboring\nvillagers, really almost invited punitive raids by the Italians, by the Germans. And in\nspite of that they persisted, and without them I think no -- not only our movement, I think\nno partisan movement can possibly exist, survive, let alone thrive, and operate.",
        "Q: The ital -- the Italians taught you songs --",
        "A: And -- and also, you know, poems, and --",
        "Q: Right, uh-huh.",
        "A: Right, yeah.",
        "Q: So, you got a certain kind of education from them.",
        "A: Sure, sure.",
        "Q: W-Were -- were there partisan songs that were sung [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, the only Italian, or foreign partisan songs that I -- I learned was from a captured\nGerman soldier, who turn out to have been a -- formerly in --in Nazi prisons, but as the\nwar 1s progressing, and manpower is lowest, the Germans began to free -- free, I mean let\nthe prisons out, and sometimes eventually including criminals. But first they started with\npolitical prisoners, former Communists, Leftists, Social Democrats, you -- you name it.\nBut when they set them free, so to speak, they put them in special German units, in fact\nthey had a number, I forget it, it was 888, or 999, something like that. And they were\nnever let in big numbers, they were dispersed and sent throughout Europe. And generally\nthey would be given menial, or clerical, or support jobs, so they were not in any armed\nway, or possibly representing a risk to the other German military. And so he -- he -- he\nwas captured, after he came also willingly, and he was acting in some cases as an\ninterpreter when we captured others, and interrogate them, and he taught me all kinds of\nsongs that were sung throughout Europe in French -- I learned the in -- the Internationale\nin French, a couple of partisan songs in German, some in it -- lots of them in Italian. Bon\ndira rosa, which was Red Flag [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Do you ever sing them again?",
        "A: No, occasionally I -- I wanted to -- I remember many of them, not sometimes the\ncomplete words, and I try to find disks, and eventually so-some friend located, but very\nfew were songs that I remember we sang. I think that what happened some group got\ntogether, and maybe officially these s-songs were called the songs of the resistance, but\nthey were not have been s --",
        "Q: Things that you were --",
        "A: -- we Sang every day.",
        "Q: I -- I have a song that I taped --",
        "A: Of the Greek resistance?",
        "Q: Not -- no, it wasn\u2019t the Greek resistance.",
        "A: Oh, no, no.",
        "Q: Although actually I interviewed someone who was in the Greek resistance --",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: -- an -- publicly, and he and someone in the audience sang one of the songs. I\u2019Il have to\nfind it for you so you can hear it.",
        "A: Sure, sure.",
        "Q: And see whether you recognize it.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: There was an Italian woman that I interviewed, who was in the Italian resistance, and she\nplayed from a tape, one of the songs. It\u2019s a wonderful song --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- and I'll have to -- I'll have to play it for you also, so you can --",
        "A: [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Is there anything you could sing now, that you remember?",
        "A: Oh yes, you know, I -- I\u2019ll sing, as I said, a -- not a st -- a whole stanza, but it -- it would\nstart, [sings]. And it goes on. And it literally means we are not -- we are not afraid, we are\nnot scared of German guns, or of the Fascist swords, because we are all fighting for\ndemocracy and freedom.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Many, many tunes, you know, as you know, they came from partisan, Russian partisan\nsongs, but with Greek words, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah. Now you -- it\u2019s clear that the war is closing, but there 1s an -- an action that\nhappens that\u2019s sort of by accident.",
        "A: Right, the -- that\u2019s right, the only one that I participated.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Well very quickly, one -- one morning, if I -- I remember, it was close to 10 o\u2019clock in\nthe morning, and I was sort of manning the telephone, and it rang, and they asked the\nother -- at the other end, to speak to the colonel. So, but I couldn\u2019t get the colonel, I got\nthe adjutant. Well, very quickly what tran-transpired, regimental headquarters was in a\npart that was really a short distance from the plains of Thessaly, but it was a -- a suitable\nelevation. And there was a -- a kind of like an entry, a pass, a mountain pass, and\nessentially what the telephone call said is four or five or six German trucks have entered\nthis pass, which had been manned by a very small unit of partisans, about five or six. And\nwe, of course knew that coming to the pass and going south, ended in a cul-de-sac,\nbecause there was nothing, after you\u2019ve gone for another kilometer, just there was a w --\na mountain wall. So, when they saw that happening, you know, that\u2019s why they called to\nalert us. They were not able, those who were guarding the pass, to engage how many\nGermans there would be, and the nearest unit that -- of a sufficient strength, was at least\nthree or four hours away. So very quickly the commanding officer decided that the\n[indecipherable] is to fool the Germans into thinking that they are surrounded, that there\nare many more than actually we were. So he dispatched anybody who could walk,\nincluding us clerical personnel in the regimental unit, to go, so we grabbed the -- our\nweapons, and after running for about 45 minutes, and out of breath, you could see down\nin that cul-de-sac, and all the -- the Germans had se -- literally circled the wagons, and\nsome of them had gone hiding. And as they were being fired by the unit that was\nguarding the pass, they would return -- was rifle fire, they didn\u2019t have anything heavy.\nAnd so we started firing at them, and they were firing at us. And they -- since they saw\nthings coming from both directions, they really concluded that they were in -- in dire\nstraights. And we were afraid that they would communicate via radio to their original\nunit, and they would come to relieve them, with a much bigger force. But apparently,\nthey either didn\u2019t have radio, or if they had, they didn\u2019t know where they were, see, they\ngot lost. And by that time, in about three hours, or -- the main fighting unit came, and\nstarted -- the partisan unit, firing at the Germans, and then, after about a few minutes, you\nbegin to see a white flag, but just before that happened, suddenly there was a little noise,\nor -- or -- or sound near where I was behind a rock. And at the same time that I heard the\nsound, I also felt a -- kind of a -- of a pain, temporary pain in the right knee, and when I\nbend down I saw it was a tear, and something -- oozing a little bit of blood. And it must\nhave some part of a -- of a bullet that had hit a rock and splintered, and part of the thing\nricocheted, but it didn\u2019t go inside, I didn\u2019t find anything, it wasn\u2019t a major wound, and it\ndidn\u2019t hurt, but nev-nevertheless when I was taken to [indecipherable] I was bandaged by\na woman who turned out to be a Jewish woman, who had gone to school for midwives,\nwith a -- a -- a young girl, who was next door neighbors to us. So -- but it was the only\naction that I saw. I mean we -- we -- the number of Germans killed was, I think, eight or\nnine, and two were wounded, they were carried out with a litter and three prisoner.",
        "Q: And did you shoot when you were --",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah, you did.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you hit anything?",
        "A: Oh ye -- you shoot -- you, first of all, we di -- we -- we didn\u2019t see -- we didn\u2019t shoot at the\nsoldiers, because the only thing [indecipherable] was the trucks, so we s -- we sh -- we\naimed --",
        "Q: At the trucks.",
        "A: At -- at the -- not the trucks so much, but again, it was psychological to impress them that\nfire is coming from both directions, so they feel that they are trapped, and they -- which\nthey were.",
        "Q: What happened to these two guys that were captured [indecipherable]",
        "A: The three who were captured --",
        "Q: Ah, three --",
        "A: -- the two were -- I think one was a very young -- young fellow. I can still remember, he\nmust have been really almost my age, really -- at least he looked it -- like that. And I\nremember he, all throughout the time that he\u2019s marched, and taken up to -- he\u2019s yelling\nGerman curses, which I do not understand, and heil Hitlers interspersed with German\ncurses. [indecipherable] And when we got there, he was then in-interviewed, or\ninterrogated by this German solider, who came out, and he told me in French, because\nthat\u2019s how I communicated with him, in French, that it was a hopeless case of a fanatic\nmember of the Hitlerjugend, who -- and I think he was -- he was shot -- actually not shot,\nhe was killed, but again, because of a bullet was a scarcity, I didn\u2019t see it, I didn\u2019t witness\nit, but the following day I was told that they had cut his throat. Also, it would have been a\nlittle hard to carry, I mean, we be-began to be more ba -- mobile, and we didn\u2019t have the\nfacilities to -- to carry extra.",
        "Q: Did they kill the other two?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t?",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: And did they --",
        "A: They -- they -- they -- they were given to the British.",
        "Q: So there were a lot of British --",
        "A: Well, it was not a -- a --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, a mix thing, but I mean at least the -- the -- the British -- they didn\u2019t incarcerate\nthemselves, but they made arrangements with the local gendarmerie in Kardhitsa to -- to\nguard them. That\u2019s after we begun to descend.",
        "Q: From the mountain.",
        "A: From the mountains. We kept them until then.",
        "Q: And the British were not terribly fond of your particular group [indecipherable]",
        "A: They were not. Th-The British meddled a lot in -- since -- in fact, after the -- the War of\nIndependence in 1821, they always thought of Greece as a -- a part of their own\nbackyard. But, look, they -- they were primarily, interested as they should have been, in\nmaking sure that the Germans felt the brunt -- whether it was harassment, or actual, you\nknow, telling action like blowing up bridges and so forth. Because if nothing else, it kept\nunits pinned down. Now, we could not account for pinning, you know, crack divisions,\nbut anything, you know, a help. But there\u2019s no question that they were much more\ninclined to help the Zervas forces than -- but, eventually they saw the -- the light, and --\nand it was almost like a kind of contract. You take this action, blow up this convoy, and\nthen the next two weeks, liberators would -- would uppen, so I -- we used to go and that\u2019s\nwhen I got my first shoes, after an air drop.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Finally, yes.",
        "Q: So you -- you were for weeks, months, without them?",
        "A: Months without --",
        "Q: Months without shoes?",
        "A: -- without -- with pig shoes, you know.",
        "Q: Well, except one -- one got eaten --",
        "A: Well, yeah, but it -- I -- I --",
        "Q: -- but you got another one?",
        "A: -- I regr -- I replaced it.",
        "Q: You replaced it?",
        "A: Yes, right.",
        "Q: Were you wearing socks?",
        "A: No, no such thing.",
        "Q: No. So did they cover your toes, these things?",
        "A: Yes. This is like a ballet -- like a ballet --",
        "Q: Yeah [indecipherable] like a ballet --",
        "A: -- slipper, yes.",
        "Q: I see. It\u2019s a good thing it was warm weather. Now, it\u2019s clear that liberation is going to\ncome.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: It won\u2019t -- may -- maybe a few months --",
        "A: No, it began to be visible in beginning of August, even --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- it was -- maybe the ending of August, in two ways. First of all, because our units are\nmore active -- but I have to tell you that I can remember it now in my mind\u2019s ear, because\nI had never heard all these months the sound of artillery. You know, there\u2019s no artillery in\npartisan, but now you begin to hear, at a great distance, this dull thud, boom, boom,\nboom. And at night, you know, it\u2019s not a heavy sound, it\u2019s not continuously\n[indecipherable] but it\u2019s there. And at night you hear the same sound, but at the same\ntime you see also the illumination in the horizon. So you -- you -- you know somebody is\nfiring, all right? So essentially what\u2019s -- what\u2019s happened is by then the Germans are in\nvery well organized retreat, they\u2019re abandoning Greece. And of course, that\u2019s understood,\nand known, and so the partisans units physically are themselves beginning to move first\nto harass the rear of the departing Germans, but also to get low, because the lower parts\nnow are themselves free. So -- so it became a combination of news, combination of an\naction, a combination of hearing things, seeing things, and then beginning to assess the\n[indecipherable] because as soon as these things started, headquarters wasn\u2019t going to\nstay in the rear where we were. We be -- ousess began to descend to lower elevations.",
        "Q: Are you also hearing about killing centers in the east?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t hear anything?",
        "A: That -- at least -- I mean, 1 -- I cannot le -- I did not hear --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- at all. Whether it was known, or whether it was known at the higher levels, at\nheadquarters, I do -- I don\u2019t think so, because for example, I read the memoirs of\nYugoslav partisans, some of them Bitola Jews, one of them, Zamilla Kolomonos, who\nwas my fa -- my mother\u2019s maiden name, although no relation. And they only find out at\nthe end of the war, because coincidentally, Ilia Aaronburg, the Russian author, had been\nto a tour of concentration camps, and who had been a -- obviously -- apparently to\nTreblinka, and who told the survivors, 67 out of 3500 Bitola Jews, that all were\nexterminated in Treblinka with no survivors. So I don\u2019t think that this kind of thing was -\n- was known until really I think se -- the Russians I think, because they wer -- they were\nthe first that liberated parts of Poland. You know, my brother, when they had to abandon\nAuschwitz, was because of the approaching Russians. So I think through that way, but it\ndid not reach the partisans, certainly, and I think even -- even after we were liberated, we\ndidn\u2019t understand the kind, as well as the magnitude, both in -- in -- in kind, and -- and --\nand -- and size of the horror that had occurred.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.\nEnd of Tape #7\nTape #8",
        "Q: W -- let me ask you the same question that I just asked you.",
        "A: All right.",
        "Q: What -- di -- was it in some ways helpful to you that you didn\u2019t know? Would it have\nactually made a difference?",
        "A: Either I did not know, or did not learn about the --",
        "Q: Know about the [indecipherable |",
        "A: -- the extermination?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: It\u2019s very hard not to -- to put myself in a kind of a frame at -- of mind that I had at that\ntime, and try to speculate what it would have caused if -- 1f I had known. I s -- I think, as\nI mentioned earlier -- perhaps we were off camera, I don\u2019t recall any more, that it\u2019s a lot -\n- both easier for me, and much more pleasant in my mind, to tell you what my mind was\noccupied with during -- especially the su -- the late summer months, as we begin to really\nmore than hope now, we can see this being a tangible, reachable goal, to be liberated.\nThat more increasingly, my thoughts are, constantly are with the family, and of course\nthe big unknown. And I -- I -- I can still remember going on long walks in the middle of\nthe mountains, and sitting on a rock, and looking at the horizon, beyond which you\ncannot see, because the next ridge intervenes, and try to go mentally beyond that ridge,\nand then I would see the family. See, it -- I mean, picture them in my -- in my mind, but\nalmost all the thought were, no matter how they started, were all how things are going to\nbe, not how things they were, but how they are going to be, and I was -- it was this -- this\nfeeling that with liberation there will be really I -- a -- a greater, brighter thing for\neverybody, and now the experience in the mountains and so forth, had begun to ba -- I -- I\ngrew up, almost overnight.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I had -- I don\u2019t think I had another childish thought after I -- after the monastery in\nMessenikolas. So this is what was -- I was preoccupied with, that I -- that I would have to\ngo to the university, and how it will be with my mother, my father, and my brothers. How\nI would able to guide them, and with all my experience. So that was what was\npreoccupying -- you know, it would have been te-terrible, you know, to -- to -- to have\nhad these kinds of things be disturbed by if we had learned what was actually happening.",
        "Q: Right, what was happening. So, in many ways you were constructing a future --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- at this point.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, perhaps temperamentally, I\u2019ve always been much more f-forward looking -",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- than retrospective looking. And it\u2019s essential for me to have a -- an objective, so I\nwould always formulate objectives that would be reached, that I can then act on. And\nthat\u2019s what was the primary -- and the -- the -- the closer this thing is -- is coming, the\nmore eager I am to -- to do it.",
        "Q: So tell me about what liberation was like, how -- what led up to --",
        "A: Very quickly, the thing that -- like many things like that happen very quickly, and that\nwas -- towards the tail end of September, maybe beginning of October, we are issued\norders that indeed we have to start descending down, and we physically begin to descend,\nand out of nowhere, I thought no one -- because I had -- in the month I had never seen\nthat, a tiny little Fiat automobile, which was a -- a captured It-Italian army vehicle, which\nI think the Italians called topolino, which means little mouse, which was -- it was smaller\nthan a VW. And that\u2019s where -- there was a driver -- imagine that little thing, four people.\nAn-And I don\u2019t know why, here\u2019s the colonel sitting in the passenger seat in front, and in\nthe rear seat is the adjutant, who has the rank of a captain, and me. But it\u2019s almost -- what\n-- as we are unload -- or taking the few files that we took with us, and maybe because I\nwas helping, I just got in, and that\u2019s it. So for hours we are driving down very rough\nroads and things like this, stopping every so often, until finally, towards 10 or 11 o\u2019clock\nat night, we stop someplace to -- for a relieve and -- and even to have a bite that we had\ncarry with us. And we slept on the ground, and we are already now in the plains of\nThessaly. And the following morning as we are ready again to -- to proceed, the colonel\nturns the adjutant and says, \u201cWhat\u2019s Nehama doing here?\u201d I mean, I\u2019ve been with him for\na whole day, talking and driving. He just then realized that I was there, apparently. Out.\nSo without any other thing, I\u2019m ordered out of the vehicle in the middle of nowhere, and\nthey left me. I mean, I had my rifle, and a few personal belongings. But -- but -- but soon,\nvery soon, I -- I could hear even a truck coming, and it was a truck that the -- the g -- the\npartisans had commandeered, and it was -- so they stopped, and I -- I got on.",
        "Q: They picked you up.",
        "A: And it took us to -- to Trikala. So as I said, these things occur very, very fast. And in fact\nwhen I was left, and then I boarded the truck, that\u2019s was the first time when I saw visual\nevidence of the German retreat, because on the side of the road, there were burned\nvehicles, because they had been attacked, and I saw a considerable num -- number of\ndead German soldiers. Dead, in fact I still remember one of them on his back with a belly\ndistended, because you know the corpse inflates after awhile, and stinks. And these were\nvisual, you know, again, evidence, th-that -- that they finally had left. And so we reached\nTrikala. And I don\u2019t know whether we encamped someplace. But then, a couple of days\nlater, we were ordered to get to Larisa. Larisa is a much larger city, and happens to be a --\nalso most central city and strategic city, because the railroad line runs through Larisa. So\nI got to Larisa, and essentially I rejoined the regimental unit.",
        "Q: And what constituted liberation, I mean, how -- how did it happen that somebody said it\u2019s\nover, the war is over?",
        "A: Oh, nobody said that, I mean --",
        "Q: Nobody said that, just --",
        "A: Again, this is not a single event.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So last night you\u2019re a slave, and the next your -- you\u2019re free. It\u2019s happens, but the reason\nI\u2019m say it happens with such rapidity 1s, we didn\u2019t -- we were not in constant touch, so we\ndid not know if indeed we finally have seen the last of the rear guard of the retreating\nGermans, you know? Units are moving up, but there may be others coming behind them.\nBut so -- so all these thing you are doing, partly by your feel of the terrain, and what\u2019s\nhappening in front of you, at the same time also, you\u2019re receiving orders which\nthemselves are -- are delayed because again, the communications are not what we have\ntoday. So it would take hours until you begin to get confirmation that yor -- you\u2019re f -- f -\n- eventually seeing the end of the German columns. Let alone that some of our outlying\nunits, on purpose were harassing the retreating Germans so to -- to speed them o-o-on\ntheir way.",
        "Q: So is there a moment, let\u2019s say you -- the war -- the war is not over --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- for a number of months, but in terms of Greece --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- 1s there a moment that you remember saying there 1s not just this free --",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: -- little area, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s the country?",
        "A: Yes. The moment I got to Trikala. You see, since I thought maybe it\u2019s a local situation --",
        "Q: Uh-huh, mm-hm.",
        "A: -- but there, I -- Is -- talked to people in the city, in -- and as well as other parts, as from\nother units, and because by that time they knew, because they knew that Athens was free,\nand Pelaponsis was free, and Lamia was free, and therefore they were free, and so that\u2019s -\n- that\u2019s when I knew that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: Did you feel physical relief? Did -- do you remember?",
        "A: I -- first of all, I -- I still remember that as we are coming down the mountains, almost as -\n- as we are reaching the plains, not on purpose, I think accidentally I turned west, and I\nsaw the retreating heights, where I spent the previous 13 months or so. It\u2019s almost like\nvisibly doing two things, thanking them for saving me, and two, you know, saying good-\nbye, that\u2019s why I\u2019ve had since then, a tremendous love and affinity for mountains. So that\nwhen -- when I finally got to Trikala, and I -- I -- and I was told that -- that then the rest\nof the country was free, there wasn\u2019t elation. I -- I -- I don\u2019t believe that either mentally,\nor psycholo -- it was definitely not a letdown, but it was a kind of calm that now said, all\nright, now you have to cease worrying about survival from the standpoint of an enemy\naction, all right, and what di -- the German represented. And soon you\u2019ve got to be able\nto gather forces to do what I had been planning to do in the mou -- in the mountains. So\nthere was -- it was a feeling of -- a great deal of something, some weight lifted from the\nmind, that that part you don\u2019t have to worry. But that didn\u2019t linger, and inst -- and it was\ns-supplanted by now, in the coming days, you\u2019re going to rejoin the family and you will\nthen be able to pursue what you\u2019ve been hoping to do. It was more serenity than elation. I\nmean elation was there, I mean we shouted a little bit, but it was -- it didn\u2019t last very long,\nthere was much more -- I don\u2019t know whether I had a presentiment, I -- I -- obviously I --\nI -- I didn\u2019t, but I -- it was -- I think others had the same thing, because when we went to\nLarisa, I met another Jewish boy, actually the son of the owner of the f -- company that\nmy father worked for, who was the -- almost the last person I could imagine would have\nbeen there. But he was there, and we had -- we talked for hours. And I think we almost\nshared similar -- had similar reaction to the events.",
        "Q: And his name?",
        "A: Saby Camhi. He\u2019s -- he\u2019s been dead a number of years now.",
        "Q: Now, some woman came by, Popi?",
        "A: In -- that was in Larisa. In fact, the day after I -- I saw Saby Camhi, whom I encountered\nin -- it was a little park across the building where we were housed, and I had gone for a\nstroll. And the following day I was maybe typing something, or writing something, and\nsomebody come and told me that there 1s a lady at the office of the adjutant, which was\nnext to the colonel\u2019s office, asking for me. First of all, who could have possibly be asking\nfor me in Larisa? So if -- 1 -- I went there, and she told me her name, Popi Stassnopoulos,\nand she told me that she is passing on her way to Trikala, and somehow my parents has\nlearned that I was with this partisan unit. Maybe Saby Shabetai or his parents ha --\nbecause Saby still part of that. And so she had been asked by my father to get in touch\nwith me, bring me news of the family, and to urge me to go and see them as soon as\npossible. I had no thoughts of that yet, because I didn\u2019t know by what means I would -- I\nwould leave to do that. It didn\u2019t occur to me to do that -- first of all, it was really almost a\n-- a week or two after we -- no, less than that, and we -- we liberated. She asked me if I\nhad money to travel to Greece. I -- I had no money, the -- the -- we did get paid in the\npartisans. And she opened her purse and gave me -- which I thought it was a large --\nrather a large denomination bills, or several of them, and told me that that would\nadequately cover a bus ticket. And all the -- she was on her way to the station to go, and I\n-- and I offered to -- to walk with her. She says no, thanks a lot, but -- but she -- I asked if\nwas news about my mother, but everybody wa -- were -- there were anxious moments,\nyou know, during all the hiding, and so forth, but they\u2019re all very well, and extremely\nanxious to see you, and so don\u2019t tarry. I have to -- to -- to let, I -- just a month before, in\nthe middle of the summer, I had caught a cold, and I was offered a leave o -- a medical\nleave absence, but at the time I was offered, where was I going to go? I didn\u2019t have\nrelatives in the middle of the mountains. But I had asked the doctor if he could ge -- keep\nit for me. And so after I saw Mrs. Stassnopoulos, Popi, then I remembered this promise,\nso I went to him, and I said, \u201cIs this still valid?\u201d Sure. So immediately he signed the three\nweek medical leave, which I then presented to the adjutant. He said it was fine with him.\nHe says, \u201cWhen do you want to leave?\u201d I said, \u201cAs soon as I can.\u201d So I went to the bus\nstation, and I booked a s -- a seat on the bus on a Sunday, which was November, I think\nNovember 19. And that was the end of my stay with the partisans.",
        "Q: Had you dreamt -- do you remember dreams during this time?",
        "A: I\u2019m sure I dreamt, but I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: [indecipherable], uh-huh.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So you get on the bus November 19\", to travel, yes?",
        "A: It\u2019s a Sunday.",
        "Q: It\u2019s a Sunday.",
        "A: That\u2019s important, I\u2019ll tell you why.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But unlike when I came up from Athens, this time it was a regular bus, so it could make\ngood time, and we arrived in Athens in -- around three or four o\u2019clock in the afternoon.\nNow Athens pre-war, as well as post war, I mean, I think all cities on Sunday, they are so\nquiet, it -- it -- it sounds almost de-deserted, especially in the commercial. So I -- so we\nend up in the bus station, and I got out of the bus, and I call on the telephone. Now\nactually, in my house we didn\u2019t have a telephone, we share it with the people upstairs, the\nShabetais, and so I think Mrs. Shabetai answered, and I said I just arrived, she says, \u201cAll\nright, come on, come on.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to take a -- a taxi.\u201d So I got ona\ntaxi, and eventually f -- it wasn\u2019t really -- 1t was Omonia, that square I mentioned to you\nearlier, where people will sit on the grates during the war. It\u2019s a 10 minute ride at most.\nAnd we got to the front of the house, but there\u2019s no one there. I thought that by -- by then,\nby the time I made the telephone call, I would find my younger brothers there, eager to --\nto see me arrive, there\u2019s no one. And so I opened the main en -- entrance door, and I go\nup the stairs to the third floor, where our -- our apartment was, and I knocked on the\nfloor, and the door opens, and who do I see? Popi. Mrs. Stassnopoulos. She is the woman\nthat had come to Larisa to talk with me. And she went like this, go upstairs. I mean, I\u2019m\ntoo dumbfounded to even ask her why. So I trudge another -- another floor, and I knock\non the door, and Mrs. Shabetai opened the door, and she embraced me, and she takes me\nby the hand into their living room, and there\u2019s my father. And I still remember him,\nbecause that -- it was a -- a kind of a thing that he wore in winter, a flannel robe. And\nhe\u2019s sitting in a kind of deck chair, because he -- he liked that kind of thing, with\narmrests. Well, I went in and embraced him, and he kissed me, and -- and I see he is\ncrying, and I say, \u201cWhere is mother, and where 1s -- where is Sam, and Meko?\u201d Well he -\n- | don\u2019t think he was in a state to -- to talk, but Mrs. Shabetai came again, and put her\narm around me, and Mr. Shabetai took hold of my arm and told me that things were --\nhad been terrible, you know, and the only thing is that they were caught somehow, but\nnobody knew now where they were. This is what I -- I found when I got there. I really\ncannot even remember the remaining of -- of the day. I\u2019m sure I must have something to\neat, because I hadn\u2019t eaten all day long. I don\u2019t know whether I ate it, when apparently I\nthen -- and we went downstairs to our apartment, but very quickly to not make a final tie\nwith Mr. and Mrs. Stassnopoulos, whom I met. When we\u2019re ab -- left our apartment, then\npeople who were looking for places, they -- and the Stassnopoulos found, or got ahold of\nour apartment, and they moved there, and at liberation, they could not be expelled. They\ndidn\u2019t even have a place to go, so for a -- they stayed in the same place, we shared the\napartment for a number of months. And relations were not really the best after a-awhile,\nit was difficult to do that. But essentially my father and I shared a room, and they shared\nthe other bedroom. You know -- and even I know that the following -- I don\u2019t know whi -\n- how I slept that night, how -- how I was able to sleep, I didn\u2019t know what to think. And\nI\u2019m sure I must have asked my father, but he -- he had no details as to exactly what had\nhappened, how they had been caught, or -- now, he knows, because other people had said\nthat -- that -- that they were taken to Haidari, and that from there nobody else then knew.\nActually, we know now -- I know now that my mother and my two brothers were put on\nthe last transport that left Greece, that -- and the reason that was being delayed was\nbecause they were waiting for the 2400 Jews of Rhodes, which again, you know, with the\nItalian armistice, they had the Germans occupied, and they had rounded up, and they\u2019re\nbringing them by boat. And they made the last transport in -- in -- in August. It\u2019s very\nhard, you know, sometimes when I think that the first time I began to learn and see that\nindeed the -- the Germans may be on the way out from Greece, it must have been July,\nmaybe, or maybe early August of \u201944. And to think that within a month they would be t --\nbeing transported literally, you know, along the railway line in front of me in Thessaly,\nwell, figuratively speaking -- well even harder than after another month or two, would\nhave been over. Well, it happened.",
        "Q: Was your father able to talk with you about what he experienced --",
        "A: Slowly.",
        "Q: -- or was [indecipherable |",
        "A: Slowly, yeah, he -- you know, I -- I -- I cannot -- now, and then, but of course more now,\nhaving children myself, I -- I began to feel, you know, that as soon as he emerged from\nhiding, he finds that he has no wife, and -- or children. He doesn\u2019t know where I am, or\nwhere the rest of the family are, and -- and he has no answers, you know, nobody can --\ncan tell him. I mean, in the case of my mother and my brothers, he has surmised that\nsomething horrible happened. At least I had told him I was going to go up the mountain,\nbut whether I\u2019m alive or not, he had no idea until the Shabetais return, which was not\nuntil, you know, two or three weeks later. And only slowly he began to -- to tell me how\nit was. I\u2019m -- in fact I remember he told me that around September, he finally, in the last\nplace where he was hiding in one of the suburbs of Athens, he got up, and he knew it was\nYom Kippur, and he begun to pray. And out of the window, he saw another man in the --\nin the yard in the adjacent house, who was also praying. And that\u2019s when he realized it\nmust be another Jew, and 1-it wasn\u2019t in yet the liberation, not freedom yet, and when they\ngot liberated, they -- they -- and he did -- he was another Jew. So, I mean for my father, s\n-- being immobilized, first of all because of his -- of his leg, but even because of hiding,\nyou know, when -- even people who were fully functional were -- couldn\u2019t roam around\nthe streets, you know, from fear of being seen by somebody, denounced, there were many\nof -- of this kind of people, in fact, you know, my family, as I know from my brother,\nwere found by Rekanati, who was a -- a Jew, a Salonika Jew who worked for the\nGermans, and well, he was, you know, shot. And so we were trying to pick up life again,\nout of the -- but no sooner are we doing that that the troubles start. And at one point,\nbecause I didn\u2019t know what to do, I thought that I want to rejoin my unit, and my father\nwent into hysterics, literal hysterics, which I thought a little bit ludicrous for a man of his\nage. But now I can understand. I mean, he is the only son that\u2019s left to him, and he\u2019s now\ntalking about going and rejoining the unit, you know. And it -- well, it wasn\u2019t so much his\nshouting that kept me there, but the doctor who gave me the leave, turn out to be staying\nat the apartment across the street from us. So I went and I -- I said to him, \u201cWhat shall I\ndo?\u201d He said, \u201cDon\u2019t go anyplace. Stay here.\u201d Yeah. And that\u2019s what I did.",
        "Q: How old was your father at this time, you think?",

        "Q: -- how long was it wh -- after you had seen your father that you knew it was\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: Right. May I fo -- spend a couple of minutes --",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: -- to mention what happened to me after, in December of \u201944, when finally the problem --\nthe political fighting was over. Our neighbor, who w -- was liberated by German -- I\nmean -- German -- British -- British troops, and Greek police. And, I mean everything\nhad been closed, there would have been -- had been no food, other than what one had,\nyou know, kept in before the trouble started. So the following day, I went and stood in\nline at the grocery store two blocks from our apartment, waiting to get whatever, you\nknow, was -- was available. And five minutes later, after I started s-standing in line, a\nnumber of police officers, gendarmerie come, and they\u2019re going down the line, who is\nIsaac Nehama? So, me. Well they take me, and first they took me to the apartment, and I\nsaw my father, there were other policemen and gendarme around, some of them in\ncivilian clothes, some of them in uniform. And my father is really half hysterical, half --\nnot hysterical, I mean vocally, but frightened, but at the some time, also resolute, because\nthey are doing searches, and so forth, and he had a few gold sovereigns left on his person,\nand they found it. He -- at -- for a moment he thought that they were going to grab it\naway, and there was the only thing that we had left to our name, so he started shouting,\nand screaming, and so forth. Well they -- they didn\u2019t take the money, but they took me\naway, they took me to the police station and they began to pummel me with the butt of\nthe rifles, because they wanted me to reveal names of EAM/ELAS people in the\nneighborhood. I told them I hadn\u2019t been in the neighborhood for over a year. I was not a\npart of that before I left. Yes, I was in ELAS, but I went to survive, not to -- for political\nreasons, and certainly I did not know anyone in the neighborhood of that. Well, I was\nbeaten for -- for quite a time, but at the end I was put in a -- in a car, and taken to the\nplace which ironically, in the center of Athens, was the place where the Gestapo used to\nround up their prisoners in the basement. It was a -- an office building, had the basement,\nor the base for a garage. And by the time I got there, it was dark, and I was -- a door\nopened, and I was shoved, almost total darkness, except you could feel the smell and the\nnoise of lots of other people. In short, they had been rounding up people, and the\nfollowing day they put us in trucks, they took us to a -- ac -- a mini camp, a detention\ncamp with barbed wire, near the shore, Glifada, which is a suburb of Athens, a s --\nbeautiful spa. And I -- I was kept there for a -- a day and a half, and then we were taken,\nand put on to Pireas on ships. We didn\u2019t know where we were going, and after a traverse\nof I think three or four days and nights, then also it happens in darkness we will\ndisembark. And we found ourselves in -- in the middle of a desert, at least it looked like a\ndesert. Now subsequently I learned it was Lugia. Well, what had happened, the British\nthen had taken all these things as prisoners, because the people of ELAS had taken some\nBritish soldiers as -- as prisoners, so it was kept as a kind of bargaining chip. Well,\nfortunately, in the meantime, my father, through frantic efforts, and a cousin of his, knew\nthe Europe Times correspondent in Athens, who knew Damaskinos, the archbishop, who\nhad become regent by that time, and told him about the fate of this Jewish boy who goes\nto save himself, loses most of his family, and -- and now he\u2019s a -- a prisoner of the\nBritish. Because two days after I arrived in Lugia, then once a day some British soldier\nwill come with a clipboard and mention names. And somebody said to me, \u201cYour name\nhas been called.\u201d So effectively, the word had come down, and I was repatriated. So I\nthink this needs to -- to have a nice book end for my partisan --",
        "Q: And -- and this lasted for a week?",
        "A: F-F-For a -- from the time that I was picked up, till the time I returned was, I think, 15\ndays. And I came back, I think, the seventh or eighth of January of \u201945.",
        "Q: Now, you were --",
        "A: I think you were asking me earlier about when Sam returned.",
        "Q: No, but let me ask you something.",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "Q: Was this the first time in your life that you were beaten?",
        "A: Yes, by supposedly our allies.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, look I can understand they -- they -- you know, they -- what they were trying to do,\nI -- I wasn\u2019t beaten by the British themselves, I was beaten by the Greek gendarmerie,\nwho were, of course, doing the beating of -- of the -- I think the British, wa -- once I got\nto the detention place in Athens itself, and to [indecipherable], once we came under\nEnglish army control, people not beaten. If anything else we were well treated. I mean,\nfood was there plentiful. In Libya one day, a man came, an English, with a English\nuniform, and I saw in his shoulder a patch that said Palestine. I took a chance, and I\naddressed him in Hebrew, the only phrase that I -- I knew, do you speak Hebrew? And he\nsays, \u201cAre you,\u201d -- I didn\u2019t know how to -- I didn\u2019t know any more Hebrew other than\nthat, but I told him my name. Then he said, \u201cOkay, come in the evening.\u201d Then in the\nevening he brought me a couple of bars of chocolate. Tha -- of course, it wasn\u2019t really in\nhis power to let me out. But I was let out in a few days anyhow.",
        "Q: Were you very hurt when they -- when they hit you, I mean you --",
        "A: I mean, I don\u2019t know if they did it on purpose, they really pummeled me in the upper\nbody and the legs.",
        "Q: With the butt of a rifle?",
        "A: Yes, and at -- at one point, the man had this -- th -- even a bayonet fixed, and he went like\nthis, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m sure that -- and because I think he -- it pierced my overcoat, that famous\nblue overcoat, which I mentioned to you, I had -- I had still saved it from the partisan\ndays, and had rit -- brought -- brought back, but it was just a -- a -- a -- a savage beating.",
        "Q: Did that do something to you, as a human being, did that --",
        "A: Of course, I -- well, first of all, I was -- I was really, for one thing, taken aback that -- that\nsuch savagery was possible, and especially for something that w -- I had not done, or for -\n- I could not fulfill a request which in good consc -- I wasn\u2019t hiding anything. It wasn\u2019t as\nif they were asking me the name of my unit, or where are they? I would have told them.\nThere was nothing s-secret about that. But they -- they were -- and I can see that this was\nnot done at the request of the British, but it was simply on their own initiative. It was that\nhorrible thing. Greece, unfortunately, is the only country where the resistance, which in\nspite of all of this horrible political infighting, at least did something to shore up the\nmorale of the people, inflict losses on the Germans and the Italian. It was never officially\nrecognized until about 10 years ago, when finally Papandreaou, the minister who was\nnow the prime minister is dead, rammed a law through one of the two Houses of\nParliament. He didn\u2019t even clear both of them. And this is the tragedy, the pity of Greek\npolitical life and affairs, that even after 50 or more years, they are not even willing to say\nbygones be bygones, at least recognize a contribution that was made, of substantial\ndimensions.",
        "Q: Okay, Sam.",
        "A: All right. Well, I then resumed my life in the sense that I began to prepare myself. Now\nit\u2019s beginning of the year of \u201945, for taking the entrance examinations at the Polytechnic\nInstitute in -- in sep --",
        "Q: Mm-hm. The same place you were going to go to --",
        "A: In September, right. But it means preparation. Well, of course the war -- war is still\nraging in Europe, I mean, still going on, and finally it ends at the end of April of \u201945, and\nsoon thereafter, the stories first trickle, then becomes a torrent, both in the newspaper\nstories, as well as the newsreels, to see the emaciated, things in extermination camps, the\ncrematoria, the piles of corpses, and all this horror. Well, what can one do but, you know,\nwithout any trace of where our loved ones are. And it was not until I think beginning of\nAugust, of \u201945, that first on the radio -- at the time of news, they didn\u2019t have the things as\nbulletins, at the time of news, it would be an extended time that they took to recite names,\nbecause as news be-began to trickle down, and come down from Europe of prisoners\nfrom the -- the concentration camps, some -- 1n some cases the Greeks themselves,\npolitical prisoners who were in Dachau, then there was also news from contingents of\nGreeks that had gone, some of them forcibly, some of them voluntarily, to work in\nGerman factories. But they got, of course also co -- caught by the fighting of the war.\nSome of them never returned, and so they also had to be listed. And then one day in the\nbeginning of August of \u201945, a neighbor called me and told me that she heard my brother\u2019s\nname mentioned. But because I -- I didn\u2019t wa -- I didn\u2019t know whether she had heard\ncorrectly, whether she made a mistake, whether the -- the possibility of there being\nanother person of the same name. I didn\u2019t tell my father, and I immediately came down, it\nwas very early in the morning, and I ran to the offices -- the nearest office of the\nnewspaper. I went to the -- and I -- and I told them what I wanted, and they had the list\nthat it was going to appear in the afternoon paper, and then I saw Sam Nehama, comma,\nAthens. So I was confident enough because I knew that they -- we are the only Nehamas\nin -- in Athens, so I then brought this thing with me, and show it to my father. And now\nof course, there is no way, I mean, I asked at the newspaper office how can one get in\ntouch, because usually this information came via UNRRA, who was the relief\norganization that shepherded all these DPs, in the displaced persons camps. But there was\nnothing tangible, but while we are fretting, I mean, when we gonna hear, and when is he\ngonna come, the following day he called on the phone. Now, on the phone he told us that\nhe was in Bari. So, I thought meant that he was going to take the -- the ferry, which takes\nabout a day to get to Corling. And then -- so we thought that it was going to be a few\ndays more. And then, about half an hour later, the phone rang again, I remember it was at\nthe neighbors, and I had to run upstairs, and it was Sam again, he says, \u201cI -- I -- I called\nyou from Corling. I didn\u2019t want to break the news so suddenly upon you that I\u2019m here,\nI\u2019m not in Bari, I\u2019m already in Greek territory, I\u2019m in Kolif, which is an hour and a half.\nSo, I told my father, Sam is here, he couldn\u2019t believe it, of course he couldn\u2019t come -- I --\nand ran to the railr -- railroad station. He came off, you know, was whole hundreds,\nliterally, of people retur -- returning from Germany, and Europe, and he had on short\ncorduroy, brown corduroy pants, in the manner of lederhosen, you know, which I\u2019m sure\nhe must have gotten in Germany from one agency or the other. And of -- of course, first\nof all the -- what impressed me was his size, it was -- he was a grown man, and -- and\ncertainly he was not thin, he looked rather -- very, very healthy and well fed. And --",
        "Q: And how old is he now? You were nine -- you were --",
        "A: At -- at -- at the moment we are talking about our reunion --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Okay, he was 15 years old.",
        "Q: And he\u2019s a grown man [indecipherable] because of what he [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, no, he\u2019s -- he still, you know, has a youthful face.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But he has the stature of a grown man, he was not the little, short boy that I had left\nbefore. And let alone that in my mind\u2019s eye, having seen the newsreels, and read the\nstories, and when I knew that he was also liberated, you know, I thought I was going to\nsee a broken individual, not -- if not ema-emaciated, or a s -- a skeleton with skin, but\ncertainly even with premature gray hair. Fortunately none of that had touched Sam,\nwhich I\u2019m very, very happy for him. I think in contrast, I think I had been much more\naffected by the -- the war, though I did not see the -- the horrors that he did, but by the\nseparation, because I was at an -- at an age where I could begin to -- to think about things\nlike this, and in -- in -- internalize them.",
        "Q: It\u2019s interesting, because one would assume, theoretically --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- that a young boy who went to Auschwitz would be more affected than the boy who\nwas in the resistance.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: Originally, when I was told that you were interested in interviewing me, I told Sharon\nMueller that I have nothing to say, compared to what Sam went through. But Sharon is a\nwise lady, and she said, \u201cThe invitation is not proportional to the travail that one has\nundergone, with what one has to say.\u201d So that persuaded me to come and -- and talk with\nyou. But I always think that the -- compared to what he saw, and what he went through,\nmine really paled [indecipherable] insignificance, except that things that -- the way they\naffected me.",
        "Q: Affected you, yeah.",
        "A: I would -- perhaps I would have felt -- and I\u2019ve had the same kind of -- of -- even if I was\nin hiding, because I was at a -- you know, even two or three years made a difference, and\nmaybe my own inclination [indecipherable] was to -- to think about these things, and I\nthought a lot about them. And the -- the -- the pain of not finding them, seeing them in\nnewsreels what had gone on, and seeing the enormity of these things, all of those things\nthen combined to very quickly l-leave, at least in me, what I perceive -- I cannot\nobviously speak for Sam and what is deep in his mind, but I had a -- a much more -- I felt\nit, I think more than he did. That\u2019s -- I -- I think that I did, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m not sure that that\u2019s\ntrue, objectively.",
        "Q: But you also, in terms of being with the partisans, and maybe this makes a difference, not\nonly were you older, but you had time to think about it, you had time to --",
        "A: Yes, although in both cases, there was always the question of survival.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But can you imagine me -- when -- when he retells in his tape the Death March from\nAuschwitz to only a rail head, which is less than 50 kilometers away, and it took three\ndays, and no sleep, and you don\u2019t dare fall by the wayside, because you\u2019re gonna be shot.\nI think a minute of that is more than the entire year of what I went through.",
        "Q: My suspicion is, but I don\u2019t know, is you didn\u2019t ask him, immediately what happened,\nyou wa -- you waited until -- or did you? Did you go alone before you went to see your\nfather?",
        "A: Or -- no, no, I -- I didn\u2019t -- no. I knew that my f-father was waiting and anxious. I\nwouldn\u2019t have dare take Sam and say let\u2019s go and have a chat. So no, we went. But even\nin the subsequent days, because I did not know, number one, seeing the horrors in the\nnewsreel, and not knowing yet to -- ho -- how much they had affected him. Now,\noutwardly he\u2019s -- he\u2019s j -- fine, but I wanted to be careful, so I -- I -- I did not broach\nthings like this. And really, even things like -- when did you arrive in Auschwitz. Even I\nasked him a few years ago, because then I wanted to find the exact date. He said, \u201cI can\ngive it to you within four or five days.\u201d Well, I went to the Holocaust Museum, I went to\nthe library, found the famous Auschwitz Chronicles of Danuta, and what do I see? 17\" of\nAugust, an entry that a contingent is expected tomorrow of 20 odd thou -- thousand and t-\ntwenty -- 2100 Jews from Rhodes. It was a mistake, they didn\u2019t put the Athenians. And\nthen it says, me -- X number of males were given numbers, starting from B something to\nB -- and I know Sam\u2019s na -- number is B7464. So he was right smack in the middle of\nthat range, so I know now the day they got to Auschwitz. Now, I asked Sam what time of\nday, and he told me it was still dawn, almost, just before dawn. Because I\u2019ve tried to\nthink when did my mother and father -- and my -- my mother and brother die. Nobody\nknows, but from Sam I know it was either the same day, or the latest the following day.\nThey didn\u2019t keep them. They had no place to -- to -- they had to dispose of them. So at\nleast I -- I can -- I have narrowed the day of my mother\u2019s and brother\u2019s deaths.",
        "Q: But his coming -- his coming back was confirmation that no one else was coming, right?\nAnd how do --",
        "A: First of all, I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t know whether he was coming back, given his age, and --\nand -- and -- and seeing that at the time of the arrival, the very young, the very old, or\nwomen with very young, regardless of their own ability to work or not, the freakle finger\ndeter -- I mean, who do you expe -- how do you expect that -- wha -- what expectation do\nyou have that a 14 year boy will appear capable of concentration camp labor? So, I mean,\nonly the darkest thoughts exist, and it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a miracle that -- that I think this arrived,\nbecause he was bigger for his stature for his age, plus that thing that he did in the Greek\nconcentration camp, I think is responsible for his not being chosen to go the other\ndirection.",
        "Q: What did he do in the concentration camp? Because anyone who watching this will not\nknow what that means.",
        "A: Yeah, well, Sam is very good about that, he says well, first of all he had to go undergo\nquarantine that lasted for several weeks. Wa -- there was very little to be done. Then, he\nwas taken and to -- there was a neighboring camp, actually a farm, and it was about 10\nkilometers from the main Birkenau camp, called Budi, which was a -- a farm, more a\nfarm complex. And that young kids were doing far-farm work, picking things up, and\nthings like that. And that\u2019s from where he -- he eventually had to do the -- the march, and\nget to Buchenwald, and -- and I think the interrogator asked them what he did in\nBuchenwald, with [indecipherable] did, he says, \u201cNothing.\u201d Because in Buchenwald was\nnot that kind of a camp, it was not a -- a labor camp.",
        "Q: Right. How did your father, when he met Sam, it must have been that he was extremely\n[indecipherable] with joy at seeing [indecipherable] children, and the loss of his wife --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: I -- I -- I can see the scene, and he is crying, well, but I think both he and I, without even\ndiscussing it, we -- we took it easy, we didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t ply Sam with lots of questions\nright in the beginning. And in fact, some of the details which I -- he relates on the tape, in\nparticular the -- the beating that they received at the hands of the German police, I only\nheard it for the first time myself on the tape. So I -- because w -- we did not know what\neffect this kind of questioning would have on him, it certainly would open up wounds\nthat perhaps ought to be left to heal for a bit. So we were very, very careful. Course, you\nknow, unfortunately, I -- I don\u2019t know, y-y -- you realize tha-that -- that although you\nwant to know, you\u2019re -- you\u2019re hungry for that, but it isn\u2019t gonna change the outcome. So,\nwaiting a little bit longer, I -- I -- I don\u2019t want to say that we -- we didn\u2019t want to know.\nWhat I think was much more [indecipherable] was we wanted to tread very carefully,\nbecause we did not know what this might do to s -- to -- to Sam. In the same way I think\nthat even my father did not ply me with very pressing questions continuously about my\nexperiences in the camp. I mean, after I told him -- I mean in the ca -- in the -- 1n the -- in\nthe mountains. After I told him of -- of traversing the [indecipherable] and getting to\nKardhitsa, and then how finally I got there. But [indecipherable] from time to time I\nwould tell him a few things that happen in the mountains, but he didn\u2019t press. I think that\nif I had stayed longer, we would have exchanged stories. He would have told me things\nabout his own childhood, and I would have told him about my mountain experiences.\nEnd of Tape #9\nTape #10",
        "Q: Did you ask your father about his year in hiding?",
        "A: Yes, several times, but the --",
        "Q: Two years, actually.",
        "A: Two year?",
        "Q: Well, it was a two [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, no, no, no. It was from September of \u201943, to October of \u201944, 13 month. The -- es-\nessentially the same period for me in the mountains. Two things. My father was, because\nof his leg, was not a mobile individual, therefore it is that he missed going out. Of course,\nbeing cooped up, he -- I think he changed altogether, three locations. He went with some\nfriends in the beginning, then just for security, and -- and before suspicions would a -- a -\n- a -- be a-aroused, he -- he -- he moved. I don\u2019t think he had, first of all, things to read,\nlike books or things like this. And I don\u2019t think my father read that much, as compared\nwith my mother, who was an avid reader. So he told me -- well, primarily of -- of A,\nthinking about the rest of us, counting the minutes and the hours and the anxiety that he\nfelt -- he -- he -- he spoke about that. And always, before my mother and brothers were\ncaught, he l-looked forward to seeing, occasionally, when they would come, my mother\nventured, I think once or twice, to come down. Very often I think was really Sam who\nplayed the intermediary, or my father would then use still some-somebody else to deliver\nmoney, or -- or news. So, I think that the picture that I have now of my father, and the\nconversation that I had with him was that he simply spent this 13 months in -- in a -- with\na mixture of despair, stoicism, hope. I -- he didn\u2019t express much more than that, and I\nknow, I cou -- I cou -- I could imagine how it must have been for him cooped up in -- in\nthose places.",
        "Q: Now, in 1946, you went to the -- the Polytechnic Institute of Athens?",
        "A: Mm, at the end of *45 --",
        "Q: End of \u00b045.",
        "A: -- I took the entrance examinations, and I was accepted. But almost simultaneously, I was\ninformed -- because I did not know that until after 1t happened, that my father, all this\ntime after the liberation, even -- even before Sam returned, was working behind the\nscenes -- at least he did not tell me, that\u2019s what I mean by behind the scenes, to, through\nhis contacts in -- with the B\u2019nai Brith, to see what he could do to assure my education.\nAnd so finally things have progressed far enough, I guess from the other end, from the\nUnited States, that he had to tell me. And my first reaction was, I have to confess, a little\nbit negative because -- not so much the idea of going to the United States to study, but\nthat suddenly my future had been already prepared for me. When I was a child, to be an\nengineer is fine, and I grew to like it, but later on, you know, I -- I -- \u2019m now an adult, I\ncan -- I ca -- I have to decide for myself. But that only lasted for a few hours, or a few\ndays, and so I attended classes at the Polytechnic only for, essentially the first semester,\nbecause then everything -- I had to get to ready to come United States. Among other\nthings to get ready is getting the visas and passports, but even more than that was\ntransportation. Remember, it was still a year after the war, and we had to wait for the next\navailable ship with a opening that was traveling the United States, and that -- the first\nopening was in October of \u201946. And that\u2019s when I --",
        "Q: Now let me express some surprise to you.",
        "A: All right.",
        "Q: Here your father has two children, lost his wife and his youngest son, and he, it sounds\nlike almost immediately began to plan so that you would have a different sort of future,\nthat wouldn\u2019t be in Europe.

        "Q: Well, I might have gone there, so it\u2019s good that you said that.",
        "A: Well, there is no question my -- my father, I mean, he wa -- he used to tell me, I\nremember, even when I was already in high school, if I would ask him for some money to\ndo so something like, I don\u2019t know, go to a movie, or something -- or -- or go buy\nsomething, he would say to me, \u201cLook, I don\u2019t have the money to give you for that\npurpose. But if you were to ask me that you want to go buy a book, even if I don\u2019t have\nthe money, I will tell you what I will do. I will not smoke for a week to save from\nsmoking, so -- so -- anything that has to do with education, I, you know, I\u2019Il do, or that,\u201d -\n- so it\u2019s not surprising to me, and I -- and I know in some respects, because I learned\nthese things subsequently, my -- my f-father would say things that were not true, fibs,\nlies, but they were lies in -- for good purposes. But even before he worked this thing with\n-- through the B\u2019nai Brith for a scholarship for me to come to the United States, I know\nhe wrote a letter to Churchill saying -- which was a bit of an exaggeration, that he, at the\nrisk of his life had hidden a British soldier who had to go into hiding -- because a British\ncontingent had come to help the Greeks when we were fighting the Italians. And then, of\ncourse, in \u00b041. It was partly true. There was a man who was in the British army that\nhappened to be f -- his parents from Monastir. And he came to the synagogue, you know,\nfor Pessach. And so we invited him, and he joined us for [indecipherable]. That\u2019s what\nhappened, that\u2019s true. But he was not really hiding.",
        "Q: Hiding.",
        "A: And so -- so he -- he -- in other words, my father would do anything, even embellish the\ntruth, or stretch it, to assure that I had the proper education.",
        "Q: And he really thought you couldn\u2019t get it in --",
        "A: Oh no, no, it wasn\u2019t that.",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t that.",
        "A: No, no, no. No, that -- that -- that -- that -- on the other hand, getting into the United\nStates -- because for a long time, in a c -- in a certain ways my father was naive. When I\nwas growing up, I was going to be a textile engineer. Well why? I mean, dit -- what does\nhe know about textiles, other than some son of some business assoc -- associate had gone\nand studied textile engineering in Yaszh, in Belgium, which a-apparently had a well-\nknown textile engineering school. So I was being prepared fully for engineering, but also\nfor textile engineer. Of course I -- all of that got changed, you know, when I decided to\nbe an electrical engineer, and [indecipherable] textiles. But h -- he understood this much,\nthat opportunities in Europe, education opportunities, let alone the United States, which\nwas a mirage, you know, sort of not only far away physically, but so distant emotionally.\nSo he would do anything.",
        "Q: So r -- let me then ask you the more difficult question. How did you dare leave?",
        "A: Well, how I dare leave, first of all I was 1 -- after awhile inebriated by the thought that I\nwas going to go to the United States. Second, Sam had returned, so I knew my father was\nnot alone. Third, I was joined by a cousin, whose -- whose father was my father\u2019s cousin.\n[ -- I -- with a young man, Jeff Levi -- lev -- Levis was his name, we came together on the\nsame ship. He went to Iowa, I went to Illinois. We related from both sides, the maternal\nand the paternal side. So, and he was an only child. And therefore, I -- putting all these\nthings together, there were no limits to that what parents would not do to further -- after\nall, I was going to study. It didn\u2019t necessarily mean that I was going to go there forever. I\ncould have easily, in normal times, be sent to study in Manchester, which has another\ntextile engineering sch -- school. So there were -- th -- there were no thoughts -- now, if --\nif Sam had not returned, I can, as they say in Greek, I could put my hand on flames and\nswear that my father would have done the same thing, and he would have pushed me, and\nencouraged me, and really shoved me, because he -- he felt the -- the value of -- of\neducation. And I did it.",
        "Q: You had no family here?",
        "A: No, I had --",
        "Q: When you came -- th-that cousin --",
        "A: -- my -- an uncle --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: --anunclein anuncle in New York whom I saw when I -- when I landed.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But that\u2019s it, I -- I then went to school in Illinois, and --",
        "Q: Did you have English by then?",
        "A: No, but you see in engineering --",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t -- yeah.",
        "A: -- you don\u2019t need very much, especially in the -- in the beginning, which is mathematics.\nI -- in fact, I knew more mathematics than -- than they taught in the first two or three\nyears in -- in ri -- in college, because in high school, especially the one that I went, which\n[ -- it was so intensive in mathematics and engineering. No, I had no English, but I\nlearned it.",
        "Q: And you liked this country when you came, or didn\u2019t you?",
        "A: Of course -- well --",
        "Q: Okay, it must have [indecipherable]",
        "A: In the be -- well, first of all I, again, in the first four years, I was busy learning and getting\nand education, trying to get a degree. Then the decision to go to graduate school was\nreally, of course, mine, primarily, but I began to get encouragement from professors that I\nhad in undergraduate school.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And I was encouraged enough to -- to stay in, although I had no means of, you know,\nindependently, I was given a -- an assistanceship -- a research assistanceship, which\nwould pay the tuition, and 103 dollars a month, and that\u2019s all I had to live on, because my\nfather from time to time would send me in a letter, a five dollar bill, or a 10 dollar bill. So\nit was primarily the encouragement I got from -- from teachers that made me stay, and in\nfact I stayed another two years in Illinois.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]. Uh-huh.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And where did you go to graduate school?",
        "A: In Illinois also, yes.",
        "Q: In Illinois, you stayed in Illinois.",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: And the first time you saw your father after you came to the United States, and your\nbrother?",
        "A: Ah yes, finally I left Illinois, I began to work at Bell Telephone Laboratories, and within\na few months after starting work at Bell Labs, I was drafted.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Because the draft was still on, and of course I would have had the choice of not going to\nthe army, s -- being an alien. But of course, I could never again stay in this country. We\nhaven\u2019t talked about the fact that -- that 1t was in \u201950, at one point I was to be expelled by\nthe Immigration and Naturalization Service, because I had essentially overstayed my\nstudent visa. It\u2019s another long story, but my professors intervened, and the long and the\nshort is that Senator Douglas introduced a private bill in congress, and I got to stay in the\nUnited States on a law named for me, for the relief of Isaac Nehama, signed by President\nEisenhower.",
        "Q: Really? No kidding.",
        "A: Not too many people have laws made for --",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: -- for them individually. And -- but coming back after Bell Labs, I was drafted. Of\ncourse, within six months after Europe, drafted in the army, you don\u2019t wait the five years,\nfor obvious reasons, the country asked you to go and -- and s -- maybe die for the\ncountry, they don\u2019t make you wait for citizenship, so I was naturalized in Colorado\nSprings, where I was stationed.",
        "Q: So you -- that was in \u201950 --",
        "A: In f -- between *53 and \u201955.",
        "Q: Does that mean that you -- well, you didn\u2019t lose Greek citizenship because you -- you\nnever were a Greek citizen, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: I was never a Greek citizen. I was a Yugoslav citizen, but I didn\u2019t know Yugoslavia.",
        "Q: Yugoslav citizenship, right.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: So after that you went back and visited?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: During my s -- years in the army, a-after the -- a few months after arriving in Colorado\nSprings, I got a call from the Red Cross, my father had an accident, he -- really he fell.\nHe slipped, the cane slipped, and he fell, but because the left leg was always the weaker,\nhe fell with the weight of the body on the leg, and broke it. So I was given compassionate\nemergency leave, which in order to use it, I hitchhiked, and it took me three weeks to get\nthere. Hitchhiking means I will go for air base to air base, and ask if there is a plane\ngoing in that general direction. So I -- I got from Colorado Springs, eventually to Stuart\nAir Force base in Massachusetts, then in the Azores, Libya, Athens. And fortunately, then\nI presented myself to the military attach\u00e9 at the Greek embassy -- at the American\nembassy in Athens, and that\u2019s when he stamped my order and the 30 days counted from\nthe day of my arrival.",
        "Q: Oh, how nice.",
        "A: Well, eventually it was over, and on the return it took two months to find -- ah but I --\nagain, I -- I got stuck in Washington for the first time, for three weeks there were no\nplanes going in the general direction of Colorado Springs.",
        "Q: So when you look back on all of this, ho-how do you place your life in context of those\nyears?",
        "A: Which years? The -- the -- the partisan years, the --",
        "Q: The war, and the partisan, yeah.",
        "A: The -- the -- the context 1s that t -- two aspects about it. One, that it\u2019s definitely it was as\n-- extremely significant period in my life, and I think to a large extent, a considerable\nextent, also forming. You know, it was the kind of a maybe -- I don\u2019t want to use the\nword crucible.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: But -- right. The -- the second part, when I reflect, at times -- and it lasted for --\nfortunately for me, and I think for my family and all friends, a very short time, mainly --\nespecially when I first came United States, I was surprised, because many of my fellow\ncitizens were veterans, American veterans who had flown missions over Germany, and\nvery dangerous stuff. In fact, I arrived United States November \u201946, the day before mid-\nterm elections. And when I asked the question, are you voting tomorrow, first of all they\ndidn\u2019t know there were elections. Now, in European tradition, university students are\nalways at the forefront of political activity. So here are people, not only students, but you\nknow, veterans of a war. So for a bit I got so disoriented that there was no -- that -- that\nmy experiences really, you know, I was beaten into wonderful shape, and very quickly, I\nthink, after I began to think seriously about that time, how ludicrous the thought is,\nbecause I would have preferred a banal, normal childhood, with my mother and brothers\nand family than -- than being formed into a fine shape. No thank you very much. I would\nnot wish it, you know, on -- on anybody else.",
        "Q: Is there anything you\u2019d like to s-say that I -- that I missed, or you\u2019d like to say --",
        "A: No, I'd like to thank you, almost in the same -- for the same reasons that Sam says the\nsame thing to his own interviewer, because the other reason, other than Sharon\u2019s very\nwise statement persuading me to do that, is that 1t leaves something for either my\ndescendents, number one, as well as perhaps people in the future, who might be\ninterested about this particular period. And this I\u2019m saying now, following a year and a\nhalf of work as a volunteer for the Holocaust Museum and doing this thing for the Bitola\nJews, I have lived with, essentially almost 2000 faces of people who are all dead, and\nwho -- whose names then I had to type it into a database, and who become alive, and then\nreading books, and talking about that. So, I want to thank you for then doing that, because\nit leaves something which might be of some small value or use to some interested\nhistorian, or -- or person in the future.",
        "Q: Well, I want to thank you. You tell a very vivid story. And your -- your articulateness 1s\nreally appreciated. I want to thank you very much for being willing to do this. I know that\nit\u2019s not easy.",

        "A: This is the house where I was born. It was built by a sculptor, a Greek sculptor in 1867,\nand the legend is that the two kariatids, the two women, the statues, were in honor of two\nbeautiful sisters who lived a block away from there.",
        "Q: And when was this taken?",
        "A: This photograph was taken in \u201979, I was on a visit to Athens with a son, and my sister-in-\nlaw came with me, and she took the photograph.",
        "Q: And this is the same? Whoops.",
        "A: It\u2019s the same, but this is taken from a book of photographs by the famous French\nphotographer Krastier Brason. It attracted him aesthetically, artistically, and he took quite\na few photographs of that house.",
        "Q: And this one?",

        "Q: Go ahead.",
        "A: This is the same place, restored. For more than 20 years there were articles in the press,\ndecrying that poor shape in which this classic, or example of classic Greek architecture\nwas left. So there was enough of -- of pressure on the authorities to do something, so eve\n-- effec -- eventually, with some contribution from the ur -- European community, the\nplace was restored, and this is what it looks like now. And this -- this happened, in fact,\nthe facade was revealed early this year.",
        "Q: And this one?",
        "A: This is the apartment where I lived when I grew up, with my family, most of my life. It\nwas in a -- the third floor of a -- an apartment house. The address was Asomatin 11, and\nthe reason that also this particular place was restored because it is an example, perhaps\nthe first example of a multi-storied edifice in Athens.",
        "Q: And this?",
        "A: That\u2019s the apartment restored.",
        "Q: Why 1s there a flag there?",
        "A: I have no idea, because I know this much, that it\u2019s not inhabited by renters, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s not\nan apartment house any more, it\u2019s offices. Some of them governmental, some of them an\nassociation. So perhaps for that reason there\u2019s a -- a flag.",
        "Q: And this?",
        "A: This is the view from the house where I grew up, from the roof, or really -- it was really\nnot a roof, you went up a stairway in the back. It was like a -- a terrace, where we would\nsometimes have picnics there, or sleep in the summer months. But if I looked towards the\nsoutheast, this is what I would see, the Acropolis.",

        "A: This is my mother, Sarah, her maiden name Kolonomos. It\u2019s the only photograph that 1s\nleft to us that you can see full face, but actually it was a -- a passport picture, and the only\nsurviving thing. We have other photographs which have her with my brothers, but this is\nthe only full faced photograph.",

        "Q: And this photo?",
        "A: This photo was taken when I was one year old, around 1927. It was taken in Lutraki,\nwhich is a spa of natural springs of water that\u2019s believed to be beneficial for what ails\nyou. And here\u2019s my father with a cane, and my mother in the foreground. And in the back\nit\u2019s a nanny, I don\u2019t even remember her, or know her name, and myself as a baby,\npossibly a year old, or even less.",

        "Q: And it looks like you\u2019re wearing a woman\u2019s sweater.",

        "Q: And this?",
        "A: This is a photograph of my maternal grandmother, her name was Miriam Kolonomos,\nand my two younger brothers, Sam on the left, and Nehama, or Mekos in the middle.\nTaken in the little park which was only a few blocks away from our home.",
        "Q: And this?",

        "A: My mother and younger brother Mekos in the park near our house.",
        "Q: And how old do you think Mekos is there?",
        "A: Five. So this must have been taken in \u201939, the latest 40.",
        "Q: And this?",
        "A: This is the youngest brother, Nehama Mekos Nehama. And the -- it\u2019s so true to the way\nhe looked, and the expression on his face, I -- very much alive for me right now.",
        "Q: And this handsome gentleman?",
        "A: Yes, this handsome s-shot is of Samuel, my second brother. And this was probably taken\nin \u00b048 or \u00b049, after I had left for the United States, and Sam must have been 17 or 18.\nThat is to say, after he returned from Auschwitz. This a photograph of a friend on the left,\nby the name of Sam Armorilio, and myself. It was one of those so-called --",
        "Q: Instant.",
        "A: -- instant, yes, instantaneous pictures taken by roving photographers in the streets of\nAthens, they would shoot, give you a ticket. If you were interested, you call them. But the\nsignificance for that is that it was taken in January \u00b045, so it\u2019s probably the first postwar\npicture that I think was ever taken of -- of me.",

        "Q: So you -- bef -- before 1939 - 1940, were you worried about what might happen to\nGreece? Do you remember as a child worrying?",
        "Q: No, you weren\u2019t.",
        "Q: Did -- were you forced to join a Fascist group? Because I know that Samuel was in one.",
        "Q: So you were not citizens?",
        "Q: Right, right. Hm. So when the occupation happens, the invasion is 1940, and then the\nItalian --",
        "Q: Mm. And that was in April of \u201941?",
        "Q: And -- and how was that in relationship to your Bar Mitzvah, that -- was your Bar\nMitzvah later?",
        "Q: Yes? As you remember?",
        "Q: Was it a big party?",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: And these were children and adults, or only adults?",
        "Q: Both.",
        "Q: Right, not little.",
        "Q: So when the occupation hap -- do you remember seeing German troops?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]. So that must have been really frightening.",
        "Q: Right, right, and that means that the greatest number --",
        "Q: -- of Jews living in Greece were under German occupation.",
        "Q: So in \u201941 and \u201942, does your life change very much, or is there a kind of -- once the\noccupation starts, does it settle down?",
        "Q: Let me go back to the school for a moment.",
        "Q: Was there propaganda in the school, or were there -- were the classes really pretty\nstraightforward?",
        "Q: So there were y -- there was no -- you -- you didn\u2019t have to do a --a -- a heil to anybody?",
        "Q: Nothing?",
        "Q: So it was very straightforward?",
        "Q: Okay, we\u2019re going to change the tape.\nEnd of Tape #2",
        "Q: -- his job is the accountant with the textile firm in \u201941 and \u00b042?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Was this surprising to you, given that the Italians were allies of the German?",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t know what to expect?",
        "Q: Now, you said when the Germans came in, when the occupation happened, when the\nGermans and the Italians came in, that you and your family knew something of what had\nbeen going on in Germany, and Czechoslovakia --",
        "Q: -- and in Austria.",
        "Q: What was it that you knew at that point about what the Germans were doing?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: You knew about that?",
        "Q: And this is from the newspaper as well as from stories people are --",
        "Q: And the radio, perhaps?",
        "Q: Clandestinely.",
        "Q: There is a difference once Germany attacks the Soviet Union, because now it isn\u2019t simply\noppression and people losing citizenship, and -- not that that\u2019s simple, but it becomes\nmuch worse, because murder starts happening. Now, did you hear about the murder of\nJews after the attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, in June of 1941?",
        "Q: No.",
        "Q: No, no, no.",
        "Q: I\u2019m wondering what you\u2019re hearing about --",
        "Q: -- what the [indecipherable] are doing --",
        "Q: -- yes, in occ -- in occupied Europe, and whether you -- eventually you begin to hear that\nthe Salonikan Jews have been deported, or --",
        "Q: Okay, all right, then let\u2019s press on.",
        "Q: Awhile, yes.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right. Do you think your parents knew more than you did?",
        "Q: You mean the first World War.",
        "Q: And you became depressed as you saw your parents beco -- I mean, it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s as if there -\n- there\u2019s a shroud on them, on your face.",
        "Q: When you were out was it mainly with boys, or is it a mixed group of girls and boys?",
        "Q: Oh, no mixed groups? No.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t go out with any girls of your -- at -- and you\u2019re [indecipherable] 15?",
        "Q: So the girls would go out together, if they would go out, and probably wouldn\u2019t go out in\nthe evening alone?",
        "Q: I see. So it\u2019s a little different than probably some of what happened in Europe at that\ntime?",
        "Q: There may have been --",
        "Q: -- a different kind of social existence.",
        "Q: And how was your brother -- your two brothers doing at this time?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Did you see dead bodies in the street?",
        "Q: What did that do to you? Do you remember your -- the first time?",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah, it\u2019s interesting that you talk about sort of living -- you live on two levels.",
        "Q: One you ke -- try to keep normalcy --",
        "Q: -- and yet, at the same time, you have this very different thing.",
        "Q: Did you have relatives living in Salonika?",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And was that area under Bulgarian occupation?",
        "Q: Yeah. So they were actually, they were deported before the Salonika Jews.",
        "Q: Oh, this is -- this is -- yes.",
        "Q: Right. Did you have to wear a Jewish star?",
        "Q: But when -- excuse me -- 1n 1943, after the armistice in Italy, and the Italians are no\nlonger occupying the area that you\u2019re living in, the Germans occupy.",
        "Q: So something changes radically --",
        "Q: -- at that time, right?",
        "Q: Did you, by the way, know what was going on in Italy, that the allies --",
        "Q: You did?",
        "Q: So how -- do you know how the decision was made to disperse? Had your father been\npreparing this? As if this might happen, do you know?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: I think we should stop the tape --",
        "Q: -- now, because the story\u2019s going to get very complicated.",
        "Q: -- unusual. This is the first time you ever had a family --",
        "Q: Council. Was -- was he very explicit with you? It -- beyond saying we have to disperse,\nwe have to go into hiding because the Germans are going to come after us? Did he -- did\nyou say, well what -- what are they going to do? Did [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Isaac, you said to th -- this was a few minutes ago, off camera, about how you wish, but\nthere\u2019s no answer to the question of the look that your parents had, a sort of gray --\ngrayness, and no smiles.",
        "Q: And dark, dark and black.",
        "Q: That you wish that they had been able to communicate what it was that they were feeling\nor thinking. Is it possible also, that they had very little information? That they knew\nsomething was ominous, but they -- they also had no words. Is it --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: But obviously, you picked up enough to talk with your friend even prior to this family\ncouncil.",
        "Q: How --",
        "Q: None of your other friends were there?",
        "Q: Now, you also said that very quickly the Jews of Athens dispersed, many of them would\njust --",
        "Q: So this means that the population of non-Jewish Greeks are very open to helping the\nJews. Or is th -- am I -- is that not --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Greeks.",
        "Q: Right, yeah.",
        "Q: Had there -- had there been a census of Greece within, I don\u2019t know, in 1933, 1936 --",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "Q: I am.",
        "Q: Who was Jewish --",
        "Q: Now the reason why I\u2019m asking is because does this mean that the Germans, when they\ncome in, can easily get a list of who the Jews are, and where they\u2019re living?",
        "Q: That paperwork.",
        "Q: So does that mean that most of the Jews did not register? Some must have.",
        "Q: Now, before you go to the mountains, you are hiding for about how long?",
        "Q: Two or three -- just a few weeks?",
        "Q: And you were the only one who could do that? In -- the other mem -- other members of\nthe family didn\u2019t come to see you, you went to see them?",
        "Q: And what did he say?",
        "Q: Or to your two brothers.",
        "Q: How did you make the decision to go? What -- what made you, since you weren\u2019t very\npolitical [indecipherable]",
        "Q: You had. Now let -- now let me go back to this choice that you made not to see your\nmother, a-and your brothers. Do you --",
        "Q: Choice.",
        "Q: Do you really regret having gone to the mountains? You don\u2019t.",
        "Q: You went to the mountains.",
        "Q: Right. But she knew that you were going to the mountains because your father had\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: And of course, he doesn\u2019t know --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] you not make it.",
        "Q: So, in some ways you create a level of anxiety that you didn\u2019t want to create with people,\nbut you had tried to make a decision that was best for you.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "Q: So they knew you existed?",
        "Q: [indecipherable] they knew this, what this family make up was.",
        "Q: Was -- was there a s -- a network of people who were rescuing people, or were these\nreally individuals that had been chosen by --",
        "Q: No network.",
        "Q: Were you frightened by your own decision, or were you excited that you were finally\nmaking a decision to do something, as opposed to waiting?",
        "Q: No [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: A serious undertaking.",
        "Q: But you did not have a -- in a certain way, a political point of view, except to get away\nfrom the Germans.",
        "Q: Whereas your friend really wanted to join what was an anti-Communist group.",
        "Q: He -- is it this -- pronounced --",
        "Q: Zervas.",
        "Q: So it was -- you didn\u2019t care which group you got to, at first? It was just getting out.",
        "Q: And your -- your friend Thanassis --",
        "Q: -- left because he couldn\u2019t get into that group, that group was not [indecipherable]",

        "Q: Let\u2019s -- let\u2019s go back.",
        "Q: The day that you\u2019re going to leave.",
        "Q: Right?",
        "Q: What do you -- what do you have, the two of you?",
        "Q: Your clothes. You have a little money?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: And he did not say anything to his parents?",
        "Q: Worse than you.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] he didn\u2019t say anything.",
        "Q: Okay, I think we\u2019ll stop the tape --",
        "Q: -- and when we begin next time, we\u2019 Il begin the journey into the mountains.",
        "Q: Okay?",
        "Q: Isaac, when we -- we la -- the last part of the tape that we were on a few minutes ago, you\nwere getting on top of the flat bedded truck that has all of this material on it, and I gather\nthat these trucks were always going to the mountains? I mean, did they, or not?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: And some of them was going also in other directions, from -- between other cities. It was\nprimarily commerce because there were no -- at that time there were no -- not only -- no\nhighways, as we know it, but even routes that an ordinary trucks, even with powerful\nengines, could possibly negotiate to go up mountains.",
        "Q: And so who\u2019s on, besides you, and --",
        "Q: Thanassis, who -- just --",
        "Q: Did you have an I.D. card of some kind?",
        "Q: Now, Nehama must have been clearly a Jewish name.",
        "Q: Right? So you would have been too noticeable.",
        "Q: Atom, right, right. All right, so you\u2019re on this -- you go through two checkpoints --",
        "Q: -- so you don\u2019t have to run away the way your father --",
        "Q: -- has suggested you do if there\u2019s a problem.",
        "Q: And where did you stay that night?",
        "Q: So tell -- so just because it\u2019s a little bit funny --",
        "Q: What was the situation, you go and you say we\u2019re two kids, and we have no place to stay,\nwill you let us stay here? Is that what you end up --",
        "Q: Aha, yes, really?",
        "Q: So this 1s a new experience?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: And you spent one night there?",
        "Q: Did they feed you breakfast in the morning?",
        "Q: Yeah.",

        "Q: Right.",

        "Q: -- before you move on.",
        "Q: How do you understand his decision now? Do you think it was because he didn\u2019t want to\njoin the -- the Communist group, he really wa -- wanted to join the other [indecipherable |",

        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right, okay.",
        "Q: Right, no, no, that\u2019s important.",
        "Q: So it wasn\u2019t anti-Communist?",
        "Q: So that it would include Communists?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: To join, yeah. But -- but even being a member of such an extreme right wing group didn\u2019t\nmean he wouldn\u2019t help you as a Jew.",

        "Q: -- things. All right, so -- okay.",

        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t a n-nickname, it was the diminutive, which is often done in -- in Greece, to\ntake the ending of the name itself. So Isaac 1s Saaco, and it got shortened to Zako, and\nthat\u2019s how I was known by my parents, my brothers, and friends.",
        "A: Yes, I -- that\u2019s right, but it remained like that, and today my wife addresses me as Zako.",
        "A: I think one friend that I met in California. I told him about that, and he still calls me\nZako.",
        "A: I was born in 1926, April 29.",
        "A: I was born in Athens. My parents had migrated from the city where they were born,\nwhich was at that time, when they were born, called Monastir, part of the Ottoman\nEmpire. And after the first World War, they left because the conditions there were\nterrible, and ended up in Athens, and that\u2019s where I was born.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: All right.",
        "A: My father was -- when I began to understand the situation, my father was an accountant.\nHe was th-the chief accountant of a very large company that dealt in -- in importing\ntextiles, and selling wholesale. My father was lame because he had polio as a young\nchild, and essentially almost a club foot, which had then to be corrected in an operation\nthat took place in Paris, when he was a teenager. And he stayed on in Paris, and did --\nstudied accounting. My mother was a -- a teacher in a school in the town where she was\nborn, in an Alliance Frangaise school. So, because they both very proficient in French,\nthen it was compulsory to speak French at home. Between themselves, my parents talked\nin Ladino, or Judeo-Espagnol, which I had to do also with my maternal grandmother,\nwhen she visited us, because that\u2019s the only language she knew.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s interesting that you ask that, because it\u2019s now that I\u2019m finding out, through\nsome of the work that I have done for the -- for the Holocaust Museum, about my\nparent\u2019s backgrounds, and very slowly I -- I have found out, that especially in my father\u2019s\nfamily, they were very prominent. Both, I think, in financially, but also as leaders of a\ncommunity. My great-grandfather, Solomon, was one of the first 13 signatures in 1864 to\nopen Alliance-Frangaise schools in Monastir. My grandfather Isaac, whose name I bear,\nwhich was another tradition in Sephardic homes, was a president of the Jewish\ncommunity of Monastir. And my Uncle Solomon, who was my father\u2019s eldest brother,\nwas president of the Joint Distribution Committee. So, apparently they must have been a\nvery prominent family. My grandfather -- and I still remember a letterhead, it was in\nseveral languages, but the one that I remember was in French, fournisseur de l\u2019arm\u00e9e\nturque. And we see he used to s -- to sell goods to the Turkish army. Grain, and other\nmaterial, not -- not weapons, but -- so they had been in that business for a long time.",
        "A: He -- you see, you have to remember, I think in Europe generally, avi was something\npeculiar to my family, parents don\u2019t exchange a lot of confidences when you\u2019re young.\nThings immediately change, magically, when you reach manhood, or adulthood in -- in\nEurope. And then you become a friend, and things then open up. You see, I left Greece\nwhen I was 19, to come to study in United States, so I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to\nengage my father in reminiscences, so my brother -- younger brother, who stayed with\nmy father until my father\u2019s death in Greece, he knows much more sometimes, about\nstories that my father told him, than I had an opportunity to do -- to do.",
        "A: Yes, well not really close, again, because of what I mentioned before. We were not\ndistant, but my father was a -- a very even tempered individual. He encouraged me in my\nstudies. He insisted to review my homework even, I think, when I first went to high\nschool in the gimnasium. There were things that he had no notion at all, whether\nmathematics, or physics, and yet he insisted to review the homework. I -- by contrast, my\nmother was a -- a very demanding person. Having been a teacher, and also\ntemperamentally, she asked of me to do things -- to excel, to study my f -- French\nlessons, to practice -- at one time I started learning the violin at the Athens Conservatory,\nbut the war put an end to all of that, so I didn\u2019t pursue that instrument. So there was\nalways a contrast. My -- my mother was much more demanding individual, my father a\nmuch more even tempered, but still expecting things.",
        "A: Right, yeah.",
        "A: No, I would -- up to a certain point, then ev -- eventually I would have to learn to talk to\nmy -- my parents, but I would talk to my mother, because I lived all day long with -- with\nher, and it was almost a natural thing for me, the first person to think of telling her about\nsomething.",
        "A: It\u2019d be her, yes.",
        "A: My father did not, because -- as I mentioned before, because of his lameness. My mother\ntook me about four or five blocks away from -- from the house where we -- I grew up.\nThere was a little park, and then she would take us, I\u2019m sure when I was very young.\nLater on, when I reached the age of 10, I then started taking my younger brother on\nwalks. Another thing that I remember we did very frequently was -- as I said, my\nmaternal grandmother visited us twice a week, she lived with a -- an aunt. And it was\nreally for an able person, it was let\u2019s say, a 15 minute walk. But for my grandmother, it\nturn out to be maybe a half an hour, or a little bit more, because she was older, and she\nwould have to rest from time to time. And the little park was on the way, so we\u2019re -- I\nwould go to the keropper, and we would eventually reach the park, sit at the bench, let\nher rest. And my mother would come sometimes together.",
        "A: Oh, I started violin lessons when I was eight or nine years old, maybe 10. But I started\nschool when I was four, the reason being that that was when my second brother was born,\nSamuel. And I don\u2019t know, perhaps I was too much, and my mother needed to have free\ntime to care for my brother. She knew the teacher in the Jewish school, which was around\nthe corner from my house. So she asked her if sh -- I could go there for a few hours, just\nsort of to be kept, and not to interfere with the house affairs. But apparently I must have\npicked up, because there from then on, I continued, and I went to -- to school. But I think\nusually at the end of a school year, then my actual age would be apparent to the teachers.\nSo the first six years of primary school -- at the time I went to school it was six years\nprimary, six years high school, or gimnasium. For the first seven years of sc -- of\nschooling, I changed school every year, because -- for the reason I mentioned before,\nthey would find out from my behavior I was a lot younger than -- than my grade, and\nthey would wo -- washme -- wanted me to -- to remain for another year in the same\ngrade, but of course, my parents did not want to do that, and I continued.",
        "A: The violin came -- yes, I started with a -- a private teacher, who lived a few blocks from\nmy house, for about a year. And then my parents decided that I ought to go to the\nconservatory, and I had to give an audition, and I was then admitted, and I started\nstudying. I have -- I have to change, because now I remember, I started in 1939, so I was\nabout 13 then. The reason I\u2019m saying that now, in recollection, was because I was at the\nconservatory for two years -- two and a half years, and then after the -- the occupation,\nafter the war, it closed.",
        "A: It closed for a -- at least a year, year and a half, that\u2019s what interrupted the violin lessons.",
        "A: Well, but for only a year, year and a half, I didn\u2019t reach any exalted levels.",
        "A: At that time I did. The violin is a very hard instrument, and to -- to -- to make 1t make a\npleasant sound, it -- the technique in itself is very hard. I had a boyhood -- childhood\nfriend, two years older than I, Saby Shabetai, he lived in the apartment above ours. And\nwhen I would eg -- do exercises, then the windows were open, and then from time to time\nhe would shout and tell me to stop that horrible sound. But I -- I persevered, but the war\nput an end to that.",
        "A: In 1930, yes.",
        "A: And the youngest, he was named Nehama, he was born in 1934.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t hard --",
        "A: -- but I think it\u2019s -- I can see it in my own children and grandchildren, that the four age\ndifference, for the first 10 - 15 years, is almost an -- an unbridgeable gap. You have\ndifferent friends. I -- I -- I didn\u2019t have, I ca -- as I recall, any problems with my younger\nbrother, but I wasn\u2019t really that close to him.",
        "A: But in contrast, with the youngest brother -- let me call him Meko, because that\u2019s how we\n-- we called him, from the diminutive Nehameko, I was much closer to him. I was sort of\nhis protector. I would take him for walks to the park. I would sometimes supervise the\nfirst lessons that he had in going to school. And this is how we were growing up. I\u2019m --\nI\u2019m sure that a little bit later on, if -- if things had not happened w-what actually\nhappened, I would have been friendly with all of them.",
        "A: I think simply that -- that I thought it was a natural thing. I -- I don\u2019t think I was asked by\nmy mother, but simply I -- I felt that it was a natural role to play, because I was now big\nenough to protect him if he would go out and play, if another kid would attempt to beat\nhim up, I would be around to --",
        "A: -- to protect him.",
        "A: It was just a -- a role I -- I -- I fell into naturally. I don\u2019t think I was asked to do it.",
        "A: We were observant in all the Jewish traditions, I\u2019m talking the Sabbath, and of course, all\nthe holidays.",
        "A: Yes, I think at the age of five and on, my Friday chore, before the actual Sabbath started,\nwas to deliver a bottle of olive oil to the synagogue, because in Sephardic synagogues,\nthere are no candles. Everything is in glass containers with olive oil and wicks that burn.\nAnd the thing that you do is to keep the synagogue supplied with oil. And since it was so\nnear my house, then I would be asked to deliver a -- a bottle of oil. Also, my memories,\nboth of the Sabbath, and -- and -- and the major holidays, they are visual, oral, and\nolfactory, because Friday afternoon, before the onset of Sabbath, when the dining room\nand the living room were closed, the floors were waxed, and I still remember the -- the\nwax smell, which wa-was indicative of the preparations for the Sabbath.",
        "A: A little bit at times. I have more visual memory of the dishes that my mother cooked.\nSome of them were, at least visually, very attractive. And I also le -- remember at times\nwhen she would do a number of desserts that required the rolling of dough to a very thin\nlayer, which today you can buy at the store, it\u2019s called phylo -- phylo, which is a Greek\nword. But in those days, she did it, and if you don\u2019t -- you cannot roll it, you roll it up to a\ncertain point, and then I remember she wore a sleeveless dress, and would powder her\narms with flour, and then get under the dough and begin to pull it from every corner.\nAnd you have to be very careful. Very often it would break, and there\u2019s nothing you can\ndo. You would have to start all over again. So I remember these things.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a Sephardic tradition so much, as it is the tradition of the territories.\nI think that if you take the cuisine that I think my mother -- first of all, I think because of\nthe way she was taught, butter was never used. I don\u2019t remember seeing butter in my\nhome.",
        "A: Yes, it was -- first of all, you wanted to avoid having butter, in case inadvertently you\nused it with a -- a meat dish. But it was partly that, partly that both in Greece, and in\nwhere she was born, there is not much dairy. At least -- Greece is not a country with lots\nof dairy land to grow cattle to produce dairy products. Ev-Everybody cooks with olive\noil. So there\u2019s a tremendous similarity. So, the -- the infusion is p-partly Mediterranean,\npartly Turkish, partly Greek cuisine, but I think in -- in my mother\u2019s case, there are some\nremnants of dishes that hark back, I think, from the 14\" or 15\" century in Spain, because\nthey were descendants of the Sephardic Jews who were expelled from Spain.",
        "A: Every Saturday.",
        "A: Every Saturday.",
        "A: Yes. Now, I don\u2019t know if she went every Saturday, but a -- frequently -- certainly the\nholidays she went. And perhaps you know that in Sephardic synagogues, the women\u2019s\nsection is usually a balcony that\u2019s above it.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: No, you sort of accepted, as being either tradition, historically, until the new -- you find\nout that there\u2019s also some religious grounds.",
        "A: My father was in the B\u2019nai Brith. And again, because of his lameness, I remember a first\ncousin of his, a m -- I don\u2019t know [inaudible] was very active in Greece, especially in the\nlate 30\u2019s when refugees that would appear at the Port of Pireas were not al -- were\nallowed to disembark. Perhaps some of them ended up in Palestine. Others, I think -- it\u2019s\nnot like that famous ship that roamed the -- the oceans, and eventually had to return. I\nforget it\u2019s -- the name of that ship, but the Holocaust Museum ha -- is --",
        "A: The Saint Louis, yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes, right, to Europe. So he couldn\u2019t do -- be as active as my -- my -- his cousin was\nin going and delivering goods, and food, and money, so he -- he did it through whatever -\n- his -- his appearances in B\u2019nai Brith, and my mother was a member of WIZO. So she\nwould frequently ha -- go to meetings, and whatever as they -- they --",
        "A: -- they were doing.",
        "A: Not really. Athens before the war had a population -- a Jewish population of\napproximately 2500 persons. In a city of 800,000, or close to a million if you add the\nsuburbs and the Port of Pireas, and they were dispersed. This is in contrast to Salonika,\nwhich had a -- a pre-war po -- total population of about 125,000, of which half went --\nslightly over half was Jewish, and who lived also, traditionally, in sec -- sec -- sectors of\nthe city. They were not ghettos, but they were distinctly Jewish neighborhoods. There\nwere no such thing in Athens.",
        "A: Oh, there was a lot of integration, there was no overt anti-Semitism, other than these\nmindless thing that boys sometimes cruelly would say. For example, sometimes I would\nbe called a Jew by little, younger boys in -- in the same class. Or at times they would\nfling this silly thing that Jews grab Christian children and put them in a barrel that has\nnails inside, so they roll the barrel to extract the blood, so that they can drink it. You\nknow, the -- those famous blood libel. But this was only for children. You asked af --\nbefore, about Jewish groups. There was really not a -- not Jewish groups as such before\nthe war. There may have been a -- a small group of [indecipherable] call themselves\nMaccabis. But I was too young to -- to join. I think around the age of 10, perhaps -- yes,\n10 or 11, I joined the Boy Scouts. And it turned out that there was a group of about\nperhaps 18 or 20, and we belong to that same group, and all of them were Jews. The\nleader was a prominent young man at that time, 20 or 22, of a very prominent family.\nAnd so we called ourselves Maccabis, but it was primarily as Boy Scouts. But that ended\nin 1939 because the then Fascist regime of Metaxas abolished all Boy Scouts, not the\nJewish, every Boy Scout, or any other organization, because they wanted to promote the\nthen nascent Fascist organization.",
        "A: 1936.",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: | -- I -- this -- this was -- had only a -- a visible effect, I think, to those who were\npolitically involved. And I don\u2019t mean only all the left, or even the far left, but generally\nin Balkan politics, the [indecipherable] opponents get not to be treated very well. But in\nthe Fascist organizati -- regime, 1t was merely ignorance, or shoving them to the side.\nThey were sent to prison, they were sent to islands in exile. But I didn\u2019t know that then,\nand this did not affect us in -- in a daily, visible way. You could see that principally in\nthat -- with the formation of this youth group, then very often y -- friends would appear in\nschool already dressed in that uniform, not only -- not because they really wanted it so\nmuch, because they were ready to go to a meeting afterwards, and they didn\u2019t want to go\nback home and change. But this didn\u2019t last very long, because this thing didn\u2019t take hold\nuntil \u00b039 - \u201940, the establishment of this youth movement. By \u201941, Metaxas was dead, and\n-- and the country was occupied.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh conservatory was only two or three times a week.",
        "A: No, the schooling was -- and I went to a special high school that was of a kind -- because\nfrom early age my father determined that I should be an engineer. So I went to a -- to one\nof two special high schools in Athens, where the emphasis was in mathematics, or\nmathematics and science, therefore aiming to eventually go to the Polytechnic Institute\nfor engineering.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: I think yes. I think after perhaps the age of six or seven, either by dint of repetition from\nmy father, and also because I perhaps began to -- to like, or had no difficulty with\nmathematics, then I didn\u2019t question it. I was going to private schools, although I -- I\nmentioned to you earlier, I was changing because of this age phenomenon. And in order\nto transfer from a private school, to a public school in Greece, at least at that time, I had\nto take a special exam, that I could make a grade. My last year in private school was in a\nCatholic school. That\u2019s a different story, because my father had gone to that school in\nMonastir when he was young, because it was the only school where you could learn\nforeign languages. So there was an equivalent school in Athens, so I went to that. Then I\nhad to take a special exam. I did not -- luckily I didn\u2019t question it, it was almost a natural\nthing to me, it was an -- an expected thing, and I think that I -- I -- there was no reason to\neven think about it, I thought it was just a natural progression.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: I think, in retrospect, I -- and I say that now because now I can see how this thing is\ntraced, I liked to build things. For a -- I build all kinds of kites. You have to remember\nthat you couldn\u2019t go in those days to a store and buy a kite. We only buy materials, from\nthe skeleton, of course were pieces of wood, to paper, and then you had to construct it,\nthen assemble it, and eventually fly it. Then, I would build lots of shadow puppets. Do\nyou know what shadow puppets are? These are f-flat -- if you take a -- a -- a figure of an -\n- of an individual, and say articulate it at the legs and at the arms, and if you hold this\ncardboard piece behind a screen that 1s backlit, you hold it against the screen, then the\naudience on the other side see the -- the puppet, which is essentially it\u2019s outline, and it\u2019s -\n- although it can be colorful, because the colors go -- come through the -- for screening\nwe used to use a sheet, a white thing. So, I used to make that. Now, it progressed. In the\nbeginning, of course, you go to the store and buy the -- a -- a book of the outlines of the\nfigures, which you had to cut very, very carefully. And in the beginning, as a child, I\nwould do them out of cardboard, but to -- to do it with cardboard, which was\n[indecipherable] you had to have a chisel. Well, chisels were not that readily available, so\nwhat we would do is to eventually get a very large nail, and take it and put it on the track\nof the streetcar. And when the streetcar went over the nail, 1t would flatten the edge, and\nmake it a chisel. So we would use that to cut the -- but after, if you become very\nproficient, and you continue, then you begin to make them out of thin plywood, which of\ncourse required different tools, you had a drill, and of course a coping saw with a very\nthin blade, that you have to be very careful because they break very, very frequently, and\nit\u2019s a very elaborate thing because it\u2019s a full -- a [indecipherable] you know, the --\nespecially around the hair. These are the kinds of things I would do. Then, I built a -- a\nradio, you know, out of crystal. I had to go and find appropriate crystal, and get the -- the\nthings, wind the coil. Then we used to try to build telephones. We begin with the usual\ntelephone of two cans with a string, but then we got a little bit more elaborate, and started\nbuilding things that will go a longer distance, with actual wires. So that\u2019s -- I think I trace\nmy interest in -- in building things.",
        "A: Oh yes, of course, af -- after all this -- there were also books, because first of all, th-the\nmain character is called Karagioz, and it\u2019s a remnant from the 400 years of Turkish\noccupation of Greece, because literally Karagioz means black eyes. He was, I don\u2019t\nknow, perhaps Pucinello in Italian Renaissance plays, or Tilolenspiegel. It\u2019s a\ncombination of a character who was perhaps completely illiterate, but street smart, and\nwho would always outwit more serious and officious, in particular, because the -- the --\nthe opponents were always Turks, you see, and -- and -- and al -- all --all the police, or\nsome -- a clerk, so always the street mart boy -- actually man later on, because he had\nchildren himself, would outwit them all. Of course we would learn the parts, and then at\nthat time we would try to invite[indecipherable], and we sometimes ask for a fee, you\nknow, for those who would come, and we would put on a show.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Right, they were either people in the immediate neighborhood, or later on, for more\nserious things, that they were much more complex, there were, I\u2019m sure, school friends,\nschool mates.",
        "A: Yes, why, because family life was good, pleasant. School was pleasant too, at times\ndifficult, which 1s something that -- that every child meets. But nothing dark until \u201940 --\nlate \u00b040 or \u201941.",
        "A: Yes. I have to speak for myself.",
        "A: I think my earliest recollection, which I date my becoming politically aware, is 1936,\nwith the onset of this Spanish Civil War. I think the reason being primarily that it was\nwritten up in the newspapers. My mother and father, in particular my mother -- and I\nreally do not know why. I try sometimes to understand why, because obviously I didn\u2019t\nhave conversations with her about things like that. But she was very interested in politics,\nand I know she read, and she discussed things with my father. So I would then read the\narticles also. So I began to become very sensitive about the situation in Europe. Then, in\n\u201937 or \u00b038, the interest broadened primarily because in -- in the synagogue, during for\ninstance the break in the entire day of Yom Kippur, after the morning prayers, we\nwouldn\u2019t even go home, although it was around the corner, we would stay in the yard.\nAnd we began to see for the first time, people who -- who had never seen before. And\nthese were Ashkenazi -- Jewish people from Czechoslovakia, or Germany, who had\nfound refuge in -- in Greece, in escaping the na -- so one couldn\u2019t help being sensitive to\nthis, primarily because my parents talk about it, even when na -- friends came to visit,\nand we could overhear their conversation. It -- it\u2019s went around, things like this. So I -- I -\n- I can -- I can date my awareness. I don\u2019t -- and also I had begun to be very interested in\n-- in history. I always loved history, I -- I read history books for children from an early\nage, including myths, and mythology. Excuse me. So I was aw-aware from the middle\n30\u2019s.",
        "A: I think we would talk a little bit primarily about following the headlines. Re-Remember\nthere were stories which went in is -- Spanish Civil War, then I remember stories of\nbombardments by German planes, and we would ask, what -- what -- what are Germans\ndoing in -- in Spain? But of course, now one knows that there was a contingent of a -- a --\nit became almost a proving ground for many of their -- their -- their weapons. Or the\nItalians, you know, also the same thing. By contrast, although the French and the British\nwere neutral, and in fact at times m-made terrible obstacles to try to help the -- the\nloyalists, you have to remember that because of -- of speaking French, I have to say that\nwe were a very Francophile family, so I -- I had read French history. My father, after the\nwar, had bought a book about the second World War that was illustrated with\nphotographs, and I remember spending endless hours leafing through the book, looking at\nphotographs of the French generals, French soldiers, battle scenes, plus also the text.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: No. And that\u2019s why, in 1940, when Italy declared war, when we -- Greece went to war\nwith Italy, I think it\u2019s fair to say that it was a surprise to everyone. I -- there may have\nbeen understanding by much more politically savvy individuals than a 13 year old, that\nperhaps Greece inevitably, or no part was going to be spared, and we always get to be\ninvolved. But I don\u2019t think anyone expected the sort of -- of overt th -- move on the part\nof Mussolini to -- to demand access to Salonika, which of course has to be refused, and\nthe rest, as we say, 1s history, right?",
        "A: Yes, yes, not I, because what happened was the dissolution of the Boy Scouts -- and I still\nremember, you see 25 March is the national holiday in Greece, because it\u2019s when the war\nof independence in 1821 started against the Turks. So, usually were parades, and we as\nBoy Scouts participated in the parades. But in that year, in 1940, which was the order to\ndissolve the Boy Scouts, it was our last day, we were all dressed in our uniforms and so\nforth. But the Fascist youth begun, I think first year of high school, and they would\ngradually proceed to the later grades. But by 1940 or \u201941, I was in now the fifth grade,\nwhich was the next to last grade, so I didn\u2019t have to. That was one reason. The other\nreason 1s that if we insisted, as aliens, not being Greek citizens, we didn\u2019t have to be part\nof it. But I think in Sam\u2019s case, instead of making a fuss, he put this blue thing.",
        "A: No, we were not Greek citi -- I came to the United States, as I mentioned to you earlier in\nprivate, on a Yugoslav ci -- passport.",
        "A: No. Excuse me. In -- in O-October of 1940, Italy essentially gave an -- send an ultimatum\nto Greece, to essentially let it come through. Which was effectively like saying we want\nto occupy you [indecipherable]. You Metaxas even said no, and the war started between\nGreece and Italy, primarily taking place in Albania, because the Italians had already\noccupied Albania, so they tried to invade that northwestern part of Greece known as\nEpirus, from the Albanian border. Well, they were not only repulsed, but also the Greeks\nbegan to advance. So for the full of -- of 40, and the spring of \u201941, the -- the -- the war in\nGreece was only between the Italians and the Greeks. It was not until April of \u201941 that\nGermany declare war, and -- an-and -- and invaded, and the reason principally is that in\nYugoslavia, the then regent had, not necessarily allied himself with Germany, but had\nsigned a non-aggression pact with Germany, but then there was a revolution, or a coup by\nyoung officers in the Yugoslavian army, and they expelled the regent, and elevated the\nyoung then King Peter, who was a minor, to become king, and overturned the\narrangement with Germany, which infuriated Hitler, and in -- in a lightning campaign\nthat lasted, I think, about three and a half to four weeks, all of Yugoslavia and Greece\nwere Overrun.",

I\nwould have continued, but the school was bursting, they didn\u2019t have enough facilities, so\nthey had to close it, because they were going to build a different -- a -- a much larger\nfacility. So I began to go to -- to Greek schools. So I had begun to -- to read Hebrew, and\nunderstand at least a little bit of -- of Hebrew. But that, essentially did not continue,\nbecause then I started going to Greek schools. But I think about six to seven months\nbefore my -- my Bar Mitzvah, I began to take then lessons, with the then rabbi of Athens.\nSo I got well prepared, and so I --",

In those days I think nobody would go and -- and -- and engage a hall\nsomeplace, and -- and -- for guests. So I think people know that they had to stagger, so\nthey came after the -- the ceremony in the synagogue, they came in continuous waves,\nthat lasted practically all day long.",

But again, th-there\u2019s another th -- aspect\nwhich becomes important for our story, that Athens was occupied by Italians. I think\nHitler, as a sop to Mussolini, gave him Athens, and a few other larger ci-cities, and\nregions of Greece to occupy. Unfortunately, well -- I don\u2019t know if that would have made\nit -- it may -- it might have made a difference. Salonika was under total German\noccupation.",

And all this would cha -- were issued, as any occupying\nauthority does, promulgating laws, and things like this, always, although there was -- they\nwere coming from the quisling government, the collaborating government, but generally\nit was according to the orders of -- and they would cite, in particular, Italian thing.",
        "A: Well, it changed in many respects, but I -- I continue with school, I f -- I finish high\nschool in -- in \u00b042. The winter of \u201941 to \u00b042, which was the first winter under occupation,\nturn out to be the most terrible winter of the occupation from the standpoint of famine.\nFor the first time, you know, we had begun to see weak people who had fallen in the\nmiddle of the street, and gradually even some of them who were left there, and some of\nthem dead. So it was a very, very -- and it -- it -- be -- coincidentally also, Athens,\ngenerally, had mild winters. I remember only once in my entire childhood remembering\nsnow. Snow, it was only something that you read in books. And we woke up one day and\nthe roofs were a little white. And some of us went immediately to try to make a\nsnowman, but the moment we reached the street, the snow had melted. There wasn\u2019t very\nmuch left. But that was a very rough winter, it was very, very cold. There was no heating,\nlack of food. I think that probably what happened is that the black market and other\nclandestine ways of getting food -- also, people didn\u2019t know what the occupying powers\nwere going to do in grabbing hold of the agricultural produce that naturally came out of --\nout of Greece. But in -- in -- in short, it was a terrible winter, but then things begun to be\nbetter. We did not suffer very much in our family, because -- although we didn\u2019t get the\nkinds of foods that we were used to. Then I remember being sent by my mother to stand\nin -- on queues, in lines, to buy a piece of feta, a piece of cheese. And sometimes we\nwould stand on line for hours only to -- to reach the door practically, and then be told that\nthere\u2019s no more I-left. So we spent a great deal of time like that. But I was not directly\naffected with it in school. We had to be very careful, I -- we were advised and\nadmonished by our teachers not to make any politically overt statements in class, for\nobvious reasons. But ho -- yor -- y-you knew that you were not entirely free to say what\nyou wanted to, and you had to be very, very careful. There was no curfew in Athens\nbecause at least at that time it would have been almost impossible to enforce. A -- as soon\nas I finish hi -- high school in \u201942, normally I would have then taken the exams to get into\nthe Polytechnic Institute, but it was closed. The university was closed. So I then, until the\nbeginning of the Jewish persecution in Athens, I worked for slightly over a year for a\nman who was in -- during the occupation there was a clan-clan-clandestine stock\nexchange. We\u2019re not talking about stocks, or bonds, or -- the only means of transaction,\nthe only thing that was transacted was gold. Gold coins, English sovereigns, French gold\nfrancs, Swedish francs, and occasionally bars, small bars of gold. And this market was\nobviously entirely underground, because it was under penalty of death if you were caught\nwith gold. The way the market was done, it was strictly over the telephone. Somebody\nwould call and -- in the morning and say, \u201cI have 10 -- 10 liras,\u201d they used to be called\ncollectively, \u201cto sell, what is the asking price?\u201d And this market would fluctuate entirely\non what would happen in the international news. If the Germans were winning, then the\nGreek drachma would lose even more of it\u2019s value. We talk about, by that time, a million\ndrachmas, you know, it was -- millions was just like to buy some candy. If the allies were\nwinning, on the contrary, then the drachma would rise, because you know, naturally\npeople thought that with the allied side winning, then the days of liberation for Greece\nwould come, and therefore the drachma would gain, you know, gain value. So that\u2019s what\nI did. I mean, I would then -- my -- my -- my -- the -- the man I worked for would be the\nmiddle man. He would then sell -- get a buyer, get a seller. And then I would then have to\nfrom time to time, deliver the goods, which were rolls, maybe of 10 silver coins, and I\nwould deliver them to the -- go pick them up, and -- and deliver them. And it was, you\nknow, it was a dangerous thing, because if I was fa -- fa -- if I were found out, then it\nwould have been terrible. But I was not found out.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: There was no propaganda. There were -- especially in that high school. I -- I -- I think it\nwas too early. There was not enough time for the occupying forces to begin something\novert that would trickle down into the lessons themselves. I mean, what we were -- as I\nsaid, admonished by our teachers not to do, is not to make overt statements against the\noccupying powers. Even in -- in jest, you know, for obvious reasons. But there was no --\nno effect -- no visible effect.",

The Italians didn\u2019t shut any -- anything down. So there -- the textile firm\ncontinued, and my father continued.",
        "A: Well, it were not surprising -- I mean, I di -- I -- I don\u2019t --",
        "A: Right. And -- and you see, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- we begun to hear not only stories, but\nthings which I remember y -- I knew my parents were discussing. Very early after the\noccupation, in the fall of \u00b041, the Germans in Salonika conscripted all males, I think\nbetween the age of 18 to 45 or 50, and they were taken into forced labor along the Greek\nBulgarian border to do road work. I think 1t was primarily harassment. And I remember\nwer -- of course lots of conversations that my parents and their friends are discussing a\ndelegation from a number of prominent Jews of Athens and Salonika, including I think\nthe rabbi in Corats in Salonika, went to Vienna. And after a few weeks they came back,\nand there was a deal struck, apparently, where a head toll had to be paid to sort of get th-\nthose Jews -- Salonika Jews, released from the forced labor. But you see, the -- again,\nthese things are happening in Salonika. The things trickle down, or come down relatively\nquickly, but the Italians refused to do -- to take any anti-Jewish me -- measures. If I -- I\nhave looked into that. I -- very often, I -- I t -- I say to my children, other people that I\nthink I survived because the Italians did not enforce. I have spoken to a number of\npeople, some of them even s -- students of that period, and no -- knowledgeable. They\nascribe to the f -- these thing to the fact that the Italian army refused to take any political\nmeasures. So they say it was not an attempt to save Jews, but because simply they refused\nto get involved politically. However, now I have read, and I have seen tremendous\ninstances where Italians, and the only ones were army contingents, really did go out of\nthe way to save Jews. So Athens was fortunate in that regard.",

        "A: That was most prominent thing. So we go -- get into \u201942 now, and the only thing that we\nare able to learn forst -- firsthand, because from the radio, which is under control of the\nItalians and Germans, of course, you -- you\u2019re not going to learn anything. And the\nnewspapers also, were all of them simply writing handouts, and nobody would write\nanything that was in any contradi -- but of course we knew from other sources, including\nlistening to foreign broadcasts about how the war is going, and -- and you know that until\nlate \u00b042, things were not very good for -- for the allies. But there was nothing until the\nbeginning of \u201943, when in very quick succession, we began to hear about things which\nreally were not only palpably true, but were very close to home. Perhaps we will come to\nthat point if you ask me again in the beginning of \u201943, but I can re-remember palpably,\naround the beginning or -- or end of March of \u201943, and beginning of April \u201943, suddenly a\n-- a -- the -- my parents look was dark, and didn\u2019t change. It was not something that was\ntemporary that something was bothering them, or something like this. It just -- something\ndescended, a pall. Now, we were not told about it, but I now, in retrospect, and I think I\nknow that the fate of the relatives in Monastir, which occurred -- the fateful day was 11\nMarch, \u201943, which I know subsequently, and the Salonika -- the expulsion of the Jews\nfrom Salonika took place early April of \u201943. That was just the beginning, for me at any\nrate, of an extremely visible effect that I saw, and I began to feel, but 1t was vague,\nbecause no one knew at that time about concentration camps. The story was relocation,\nwhich of course, that\u2019s what the Germans were giving out.

Because during the war, and listening to what was happening to France,\nand -- and Poland, and things like this, there was definitely a feeling that we -- we began\nto get bombarded by the Germans.

I was too young, I\ndidn\u2019t go to cabarets, but we used to go out, an-and go occasionally t -- and drink a beer,\nor something like that. So, I was then able to en -- en -- most of them, there were about\nfour or five, were Greek Orthodox, there\u2019s only another Jew beside myself in that small\ncircle. The depression would be felt at home, because again it was so apparently\noverwhelming, and it was impossible to -- oh, except only to see them visually in my --\nmy parents faces. They didn\u2019t talk about it, and I think they probably became even very\ncareful in even ve -- when they were talking to each other, lest the -- they be overheard\nand frighten us unnecessarily. Not unnecessarily, but at least in ways that children were\nnot to be expected to be able to cope with.",
        "A: Oh no, no, there were no mixed groups.",

        "A: Yeah -- no, no, not at that time. I look at them, but never go out.",
        "A: Probably not. Most of them were, you know, very restricted. I mean, they would go, they\nwould go out in a big company, either with their parents, or with their brothers, or\ncousins.",
        "A: Oh sure.",
        "A: Oh yes --",
        "A: Right, yes.",

        "A: Again, schooling continued, so in -- in some aspects, it\u2019s almost an unreal situation to talk\nif there is a -- a continuing normal life going on in the face of impending danger, but\ncould you -- one has, even I think very clever people had the foresight to really imagine\nit\u2019s dimensions. And I don\u2019t think that -- that -- that necessarily this thing I mentioned\nearlier about so many nightclubs in Athens, I mean this feeling that well, there\u2019s only\nanother day to live for, so let\u2019s, you know, make merry. I don\u2019t think there was very\nmuch of that, but the uncertainty of what hap-happens, especially seeing in the winter of\n\"41, dead people in the street, so -- made everybody aware that there was a lot of fragility,\nnot in life in general, I -- even in normal times, but especially in those -- in those times.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes.",

In the beginning, of course\nthere was attempts to -- to -- to help, and carry. But when it became more prevalent, and\nit would become such a -- a common occurrence -- I don\u2019t want to give the impression\nthat that\u2019s just a little, but, you know, they were there. And I think the thing that struck\nme after a little while, something that led -- I also had to do, is you don\u2019t even stop. You\njust go on, because you know, practically, there is nothing you can do. In one of the main\nsquares of Athens, it\u2019s called Omonia, which mean co -- means Concorde -- Place de la\nConcorde in -- in Paris. It was a station -- a subway, the metro, but was un-underground.\nAnd on the square itself, above the metro, the metro station, there was a grate where most\nof the warm gases that emanated from -- and, but it was filled up with derelicts that were\nhomeless, and filthy, because that was the only warmth that they could get. They would\nhover over the grates, and so that became a part of daily life, and I\u2019m sorry to say in\nretrospect, that one becomes inured to things like that.",

        "A: My father, brother and his family, a sister, and her family, in fact two sisters and their\nfamilies, but on the maternal side, there were two aunts, my mother\u2019s sisters, living in\nAthens with their families. The eldest sister had migrated with her family to Palestine.\nThey lived in Salonika, but in \u201930 -- to \u201933, they left and went to -- to Palestine. So, w-we\nhad -- then there were cousins, all of them in Athens. We had no relatives in Salonika,\nexcept that some who were fortunate enough -- and there were very, very few, one or two\nwho escape Macedonia, Monastir or Bitola, as it was called, and make it to Athens, and\nin fact -- t-to -- to -- first to Salonika, but very quickly, my f -- father\u2019s niece, my first\ncousin, and her husband and young daughter came to Athens, but we had no -- but I -- I\nthink that there\u2019s no question that my parents knew, or had heard, although I\u2019m sure it\nmust have been a very murky story, because the details do not even a -- become known\nuntil after the war, and -- and years after the war, that all the Monastir Jews, all the Bitola\nJews were expelled, as well as those in Scorpia expelled.

It was not only the\nMacedonia Jews because the Bulgarians were given that part of former Yugoslavia, and -\n- as well as part of northern Greece. And the Jews in Thrace, and other parts of northern\nGreece, under Bulgarian occupation, also were deported by the Bulgarians. Their fate\nwas slightly different from those of Monastir because they were taken by barges up in the\nDanube, one of them was sunk, and people drowned, and eventually they got them to rail\nheads, and took them by transports to Auschwitz, and to -- but all of the other\nMacedonian Jews, all of them ended up in Treblinka.

But things happened so fast,\nthere was no time for reflection, because I -- I think within a day or two, I think it\u2019s\naround September eighth, or ninth, or 10, or \u201943, the Germans take over Athens. And we\ndidn\u2019t have time to see visually what the effect of the change was, but practically the\nsecond or third day, we already are told by the rabbi of Athens, that the Germans are now\nasking f-for Jews to go and register. And be -- because, I think of the knowledge of what\nhad happened in Salonika, that this was essentially a -- a core to disperse. So within a day\nor two after we received this news about first registration, we then abandoned everything\nand went into hiding. So there was no time, and by therefore even -- since that happen,\nthere were no Jews around Athens to be told to go and wear a star.",
        "A: Let me tell you what -- what I -- I -- I remember.",
        "A: I -- as I say, it was, I think evening -- the first thing that I know is that my boss told me\nthat he is obliged to close shop. He is -- he has to go into hiding. So I say good-bye to\nhim, and it must have been a -- as I said, perhaps two or three days after the -- the\narmistice and the occupation of Athens by the Germans. When I return home, it must\nhave been around six o\u2019clock, seven o\u2019clock in the evening, my father convened a family\ncouncil, which was a first. And -- but very calmly, but with a few measured words,\nsimply said, \u201cWe have to go into hiding, because the Germans are taking over, and\nthey\u2019re going to come after us, personally. So we\u2019re going to have to go into hiding, and\nwe have to disperse. We cannot take anything other than the clothes on our backs.\u201d I had\nbegun to think about that, because I had heard a little bit about the Salonika thing. So, I\nhad spoken to one of my friends, ones that I went out with who was a former schoolmate\nof mine from high school. His name was Thanassis Michalopoulos. So as soon as my\nfather told us what the decision was, then wa -- he turned to me, and he says, \u201cWell,\nyou\u2019re going to go in here.\u201d Apparently he had spoken to a friend and neighbor. And I\ntold him, \u201cAll right, but let me -- also, I have spoken to Thanassis Michalopoulos,\u201d he\nknew him, \u201cand he was going to menti -- talk to his parents, and I\u2019m to see him\ntomorrow, why don\u2019t we wait until tomorrow?\u201d He says, \u201cFine.\u201d So, ev-eve-eventually --\nI mean, the following day, I spoke to Mehanis, and he said, \u201cYou are welcome.\u201d And I\nhad not even met his parents. I went to their home, and immediately they, with no fuss,\nno nothing, said, \u201cYou can stay with us for as long as you want.\u201d Then I went home, it\nwas the last day that we were together, and my mother and Sam, and Meko were going to\ngo together to one of the suburbs, as the -- again arranged by my father. And my father\nwith another Greek friend. So, well, we know, we said good-bye, embraced, but of course\nI -- I was told by my father his address, because I would need money from time to time,\nand I would have to go and see him. But then I went with the few clothes I had with me,\nand stayed in Thanassis\u2019s house.",
        "A: All right.",
        "A: Right.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "A: Council.",
        "A: No, no. Yeah, he was -- I mean, I -- because it was, a first experience, but in other words,\neven in retrospect I remember even at that time, or a day or two later, in thinking what he\nsaid, I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t rehearse it. He didn\u2019t -- I mean, he -- obviously he knew what he\nwanted to say, but he did it with -- quite directly. He was quite clear, in other words, he\nset the scene, and said we are coming under German occupation. We now know what\nhappened to the Jews of Salonika, and their fate is unknown, but it can only be a terrible\nthing. That is why we are now been given the signal. And I remember he used that word,\nwe be given the signal to disperse all of -- all those who can, because we should not fall\nin -- in German hands. So he -- he set the stage rather clearly, it wasn\u2019t -- it di -- did\n[indecipherable] or things like that. It -- having then set the stage, then just as clearly he\nthen said what my mother and he had decided to do, that we would have to split because\nwe couldn\u2019t all remain together, unfortunately it was impractical going into a friend\u2019s\nhouse that people are not ready to take on five people. So all those things were very clear,\nvery measured, and I don\u2019t recall -- I mean, there was -- I mean we looked at -- at each\nother, my brothers and -- and I, and we looked at them, but it was done in such a realistic,\nbusinesslike way. There was no -- there was no emotional ah -- I mean, I -- my -- I saw\nmy mother crying, but not in a -- in a loud or emotional outward way, was just silent tears\ncoming down -- down her face. But I think probably my father wanted to make sure that\nhe could convey this news without causing, you know, u-undue anxiety, or panic, more\nthan simply what the situation dictated.",
        "A: Dark, black, black.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh, yes, I mean, s -- I\u2019m sure they had no conception of the dimensions of the horror, but\non the other hand, I mentioned earlier, as early as \u00b041, the Germans did the conscription\nof the Jews in Salonika.",
        "A: Ransom had to be paid. Then the deportation occurred, and actually, this was written up\nin the papers, because the then archbishop of Greece wrote a -- a -- a letter to the Greek\nprime minister, the -- the collaboration government, protesting the -- this treatment of the\nJews of Salonika. And very well known, he was threatened to be shot by the German\ngeneral occupying Greece at that time, and there\u2019s a equally famous reply that he made,\nand he said, \u201cGeneral Stroop, Greek -- Greek clergy are hanged, are not shot. Please\nobserve this tradition.\u201d So, information was available. Finally, I -- I -- I have to tell you --\nwhich I have now pieced together subsequently, 1s my father\u2019s niece, the daughter of his\nsister, and her husband had escaped the last minute from Monastir, went to Salonika\nbecause they had family there, but they were told they were crazy to come to Salonika,\nbecause it was under German occupation. Go to Athens. So they came to Athens, I\nimagine around May of \u201943. Italian -- I mean, that\u2019s still under the Italian occupation.\nAnd I\u2019m sure that from Allegra -- that was my cousin\u2019s name, Allegra Russo, and her\nhusband, they were told whatever they know, because they had seen these things first\nhand, I mean, the treatment of the Macedonian Jews of Bitola, it was unspeakable from\nthe first minute of the occupation. So they knew.",
        "A: Yes. I had --",
        "A: -- pe -- | -- I -- I -- I be -- I sensed, a-as well as heard, because after all, also, my -- the\nman I worked for himself was from Salonika, and had left Salonika a y -- a year or two\nearlier to come to Athens. So, y-you -- you piece -- piece this together, and you know.\nBut I have to -- to tell you that I didn\u2019t discuss the possibility of going into hiding to my\nfriend Thanassis 1n the hearing of the others. I don\u2019t know why, maybe the subject was so\ndelicate, I think, that I spoke to him alone.",
        "A: Right. So it isn\u2019t something that I had been preparing. And possibly I must have to\nThanassis maybe a week or so before the -- the actual happening, when we put it into\neffect.",
        "A: Disappeared, yes.",
        "A: No, of course it -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s --",
        "A: We are -- those who survived -- those -- we survived because of the Greeks.",
        "A: And, I mean, I think most of them, great majority of them knew the risks that they were\nrunning, because to be found out doing that, you yourself are to be shot, or -- or\nimprisoned and so forth.",
        "A: And th-th-the only thing I -- I -- I -- [remember some Gr-Greek family that hid Jew --\nJewish people, were asked wh-why do they do that. And they said, \u201cWe are human\nbeings.\u201d And I think that I have no other word, or better word than humanity. It was\nnothing ideological, they didn\u2019t -- it -- 1t wasn\u2019t an exalted thing, or philosophical, 1t was\njust sheer humanity, goodness.",
        "A: Of all of Greece?",
        "A: I\u2019m sure there might have been, but it was not as regular as it\u2019s done in the United States,\nor even other parts of Europe. But, if you talk about -- particular about the Jewish\npopulation --",
        "A: Now recall that in every community, births and deaths were registered in the Jewish\ncommunity, but also with the Greek authorities. So it was known --",
        "A: -- for example -- yes, because these were remnants in Greece, and in -- in -- 1n the\nBalkans of the 500 years of Ottoman rule, where not only the Jewish communities, the\nGreek communities under Ottoman rule, they were a se -- effectively self regulating, and\nself governing, except, of course, for matters of war, or crimes, or things like that. But\nJews, or even Christians under Ottoman rule, if they had the dispute with -- as a business\ndispute with a partner, they didn\u2019t go to Turkish court. There was a Jewish court in the\nJewish community, that adjudicated things like that, which is a long tradition, as we all\nknow in Europe.",
        "A: Yes, the answer 1s, I think, yes. Now, the list may not have been up to date, because\neffectively, some people who are coming from Salonika and other parts of -- of Greece to\nAthens, because of the favorable atmosphere of the Italian occupation, they didn\u2019t\nnecessarily go to the community and register. I believe, but I am not entirely sure a-about\nwhat I\u2019m going to say, that when the rabbi received the instruction to issue then a\nproclamation for the Jews to come and register, I think the paperwork also went with\nhim. So he -- he or -- or -- or other people in the community that went into hiding, hid --",
        "A: -- the -- the -- the main files.",
        "A: Well, unfor -- unfortunately, month later -- by that time I\u2019m in the mountains, but I\u2019m -- I\n-- | learn after the war, some people, you know, foolishly, in March, or April \u201944 -- now,\nwe're going about a year later, the Jews issue another proclamation -- I mean, the\nGermans, saying Jews can come and register to get matzoh distributed, and some of\nthem, believe it or not, did go, and they were grabbed, and --",
        "A: Two or three weeks, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, two or three weeks in Thanassis\u2019s house. I -- I go out in the evenings, at times. I --\nI went, saw my father two or three times. I went and saw my mother and brothers twice.\nAnd --",
        "A: No, yes. First of all, now I got -- my younger -- two younger brothers lived in an eastern\nsuburb of Athens. I -- my friend\u2019s house was a 10 minute walk really, from the apartment\nwhere we lived. So it was much more, not only convenient, but I think more prudent for\nme to go -- my father, of course, could not navigate, as we know, and I went -- took the\nbus, and went to the suburbs, and saw my mother and brothers twice. I saw my father at\nleast three times, including when I went to tell him of my decision to go to the mountains.",
        "A: Well, he tried to dissuade me, because he said that I am young, and this 1s not a -- a life\nthat somebody of my age can cope with. But I think when he saw that I was determined,\nhe insisted that since in my travels I may have to go through checkpoints, if somehow I\nwere discovered, he begged me, in fact he insisted that I then run away on purpose so I\ncould be shot and killed, so I would not fall alive in the hands of the Germans. He -- he\ngave me some money to pay for my passage to the mountains, and parenthetically my\nfriend had also asked me that -- that he had decided also to go to the mountains, but his\nparents did not know, and he -- but he didn\u2019t have enough money for the fare, so I asked\nmy father for that also. I did not go to see my mother, because I th -- believed that it\nwasn\u2019t an attempt at dis -- dissuasion, that it would be something more emotional, that I\npossibly could not then handle. And when I -- I -- I was concerned that she might\nsucceed. And since I was determined to go to the mountains, I didn\u2019t go to see her, and\nthis is something that I have regretted, and I will possibly regret forever, that I -- I didn\u2019t -\n- I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t say good-bye to her.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Well, we knew -- y -- people know, because they talk -- you hear things. First of all,\npeople are shot at times because a German soldier was killed, assassinated by the\nresistance, then they grab people at -- at random, and shoot them. And it was known, I\nmean, we knew that there was a part of Greece, generally in the northwestern part from\nthe direction of Athens, in those mountains around Thessaly, and that -- that there was a\nportion which, if I re-remember hearing maybe as early as the summer of \u201943, it was\ncalled free Greece. And that\u2019s all that -- that I knew personally. So when I made the\ndecision, because I -- what led me to make this decision first of all is the negative factor\nthat I couldn\u2019t possibly remain in hiding for goodness knew how long. No one knew how\nlong the -- the situation may last. A few weeks, maybe a few months, it\u2019s something, but\nwhat if it\u2019s years? So I -- I decided I have to get out some -- somewhere. So I said, all\nright, I\u20191l go in the direction which I hear is free Greece. When I talked with my friend,\nThanassis, he was much more politically involved, something that I did not know until\nthat moment, that yes, he also had decided to do that, and he wanted to join a specific\ngroup of the Greek resistance, known as the Zervas forces. He knew that they were in a\nspecific part of Thessaly. So that\u2019s why we decided to take the bus, which was not a bus,\nit was a truck, and -- and head to Thessaly. But from my standpoint that\u2019s all the\ninformation I -- I -- I had.",

        "A: No, I -- well, two things. First of all -- or many things. At times in the mountains I\nthought about -- I -- I thought about them continuously, but th -- I had no news. But I\nthought instead about what was going to be after the war. See, being the eldest child, and\nmy mother was a rather dominant and strong willed individual. We had clashes at -- at\ntimes. And I remember them saying that well now, I w -- I -- I was growing up, now all\nthese things were behind me, and how things were going to be a lot better, and I was\nreally going to be now a magnificent child, that my mother will be proud of me and so\nforth. So there was a lot of that kind of a thing built up, which came crashing down when\nI found out that they were not around any more. And then subsequently, from my brother,\nI learned that my mother was terribly worried about me, because she did not know where\nI was. She had -- they had no news, no -- we could not communicate. There was no way\nfor me -- there were -- I couldn\u2019t write them a letter, for obvious reasons, and there were\nno visitors in the -- especially in the mountains where I was, there was no one that I knew\ncould g -- bring them news. So all these things have a -- had a cumulative effect, and so\nsince the regret -- I had the regret when I made the decision, and maybe a few days, and a\nfew weeks, and a few months, and every time I think about it, it becomes bigger, because\nof other things that I\u2019ve learned. So it piles up.",

All these things were done, I\nthink, on individual measures. There were -- but there is no question that, for example, in\nthe -- in the northern parts of Greece, I mean, I know that there were at times, attempts by\nthe partisan forces, to encourage Jews to leave their homes, and go to the mountains,\nwhich is not an easy thing to -- to do, but nevertheless, they -- they did.",

Fortunately, I found this specific\nthing, and I -- and -- and before [indecipherable] got transformed, so I didn\u2019t go into this\nthing either as a, you know, a -- a -- a youthful adventure.

So we got to the -- I want to call it bus station, there were no --\nthere was no bus station, it was a -- a place in Athens where all the -- the -- the trucks --\nbecause the o -- there were only trucks available to do that, and they w -- there was no\ngasoline. They were powered -- it was in the rear of the car or truck, a -- something like a\n-- a furnace where you burn wood, and the gases would be diverted to drive the pistons\nfor the engine. So we got there, and th-the usual thing was that first th-the goods were\npiled up on the truck, and then the passengers, in that particular case, for us it was about a\ndozen or so, simply sat on top of an open truck. And that\u2019s -- was the -- the only way to\ntravel.",
        "A: All right.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Right.\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "A: No, not to the mountains. They were essentially traveling from Athens to various towns\nor cities.",
        "A: And Thanassis.",
        "A: People -- villagers who -- people who travel, I -- I imagine, because with the -- especially\nwith the advent of -- of the black market, or let -- let\u2019s call it the underground market,\nright? The villagers would bring things that -- that obviously are important to Athens,\nfood primarily, and in turn they would exchange it for goods of all kinds, and principally\ntextiles. Occasionally some light machinery, or -- that existed at that time. So, 1t was\nprimarily a commercial thing. Of course you had also -- excuse me -- not tourist, but\npassengers who visited relatives in Athens, or vice versa. These are generally the\n[indecipherable]. But I think all the -- the buses, if I can call them that, were -- that I saw\nat that time, because they were so laden with goods, and because they were so expensive,\nthey wanted to make sure that cargo would be transported, as well as passengers.",
        "A: Ah, as in -- im -- important, very interesting. It was necessary for me to get an I.D.\nBefore the German takeover of Athens, I had an I.D. with my real name, but now I had to\nf -- get a Greek identity, that\u2019s to say a Christian Orthodox 1 -- identity. Thanassis had a\nfriend who was a policeman, and I guess he was trustworthy enough to ask him to help\nme get an identity card. He was able to get the card itself, I gave him a photo, and he did\nthe appropriate thing of pasting the photograph in the appropriate place, plus filling out\nall the -- the other things. But there\u2019s wa -- there was one thing that had to be done to\nwhich he had no access. And the last thing was that the seal was embossed. But that seal\nwas only at headquarters. So he, having no access there, he told me, \u201cI regret it, but I\ncannot get you anything more than that.\u201d So before embarking on my trip, I took an old\ncoin, a pre-war five drachma piece, and I put it at the corner of the photograph and\nhammered it, so that it left an impression, because the coin, in it\u2019s face, had embossed\nletters, I\u2019m sure it had said Elliniki Dimokratia, Greek Republic. But it had to be some\nsemblance, so I think it would not have withstood the scrutiny even by an amateur, but\nfortunately the only two checkpoints we went through from -- after leaving Athens, to my\neventual destination in Kardhitsa, in Thessaly, it was during a driving rain. We were, of\ncourse, entirely soaked to the bone, on top of that -- those trucks, but by the same token,\nthe -- the guards, which were -- were Germans, with Greek police, didn\u2019t pay that much\nattention. So I didn\u2019t have to -- to do what I had promised my father I would do.",
        "A: Oh yes, right.",
        "A: Oh yes, my Greek name on that fake identity was Yannis, or John Dimokritos, which 1s a\nrather famous name of a -- of a Greek philosopher. In fact, the first one to declare, on no\nevidence at all, other than his -- his mind, the existence of an atom.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: My father --",
        "A: Right. But because, you know, those trucks, as I, I think mentioned, possibly in the last\ntape, they were not driven by a gasoline engine, but by burning wood. So they didn\u2019t\nhave that much of power. So it\u2019s another -- a long trip, and because of the rain, we then\nhad to stop in -- en route, in a town called Lamia, which is, you know, a sizeable town.\nSo we stopped there for the night.",
        "A: Well, we arrived there, because we were soaked, the first thing we thought was to dry\nourselves, so next to the station where we stopped, if you can call it the -- the bus station,\nwas a restaurant. We were very hungry. So, we went there, and really stood near the\nkitchen, so we could -- the heat would dry our clothes. And when we were ready to go\nout after the meal, to find a place to stay, a hotel, if there such a thing existed. But then\nthey told us in the restaurant, that in five minutes the curfew began. And it was patrolled\nby German patrols, and you shouldn\u2019t be found out walking after curfew time. So where\ndo we go? We had no place to go, but next to the -- to the restaurant was the -- I think the\none and only bordello in town, so that\u2019s where we ended up.",

        "A: Well, they welcome you, of course you are obliged to take a girl.",
        "A: Well sure, 0-otherwise you [indecipherable] alone for the entire night. I mean, they knew\nthat, of course the curfew had started, and so the price was appropriate for -- for night.",

        "A: No, no.",

        "A: Because they knew some people probably were there [indecipherable |",
        "A: And -- because they wanted to -- to start early.",
        "A: So we left a-around seven o\u2019clock, and -- first of all, I -- I think I -- probably you know\nthat in the Balkan countries, generally people don\u2019t have breakfast. If they have, they\nmay have a cup of coffee. I don\u2019t know if we had anything, so we just got on the bus,\nagain on the -- on the truck, and by the end of that second day, we arrived at our\ndestination, Kardhitsa.",
        "A: Well, we alighted, and we got off. Now for us was -- was the end, and nearby was\n[indecipherable] Kardhitsa, although it was not part of quote, free Greece unquote, but it\nwas near enough the foothills of the mountains that there had been no Italian or German\npresence in Kardhitsa. This was voluntarily, they had left it, but it doesn\u2019t mean -- but it\nwas still -- still 1t was on the plains of Thessaly, 1t was not occupied by the partisans\neither. So let\u2019s call 1t a no-man\u2019s land.",
        "A: So, the -- we -- we looked around, and we struck up a con -- a conversation with the\nteacher, a teacher in one of the schools of -- in Kardhitsa, and ha -- Thanassis, who had a\nspecific destination in mind, I think very quickly asked the -- the teacher, we\u2019re going to\ngo and join z -- Zervas, so where do we go to do that? And the teacher said, \u201cZervas was\naround this area, but that\u2019s a few months ago, and there\u2019s been some fighting with\nELAS,\u201d so that was the other side, \u201cand I\u2019m afraid that the nearest place that you can find\nZervas was Epirus,\u201d which is near the -- the Albanian border, which was very far away,\nand totally beyond our means, even if we could find transport to go there. We didn\u2019t\ndiscuss it very much more at that time, and the -- the teacher was really kind enough, we\ndidn\u2019t even ask him, but he offered to let us stay in his house overnight, and we could\ndecide what to do the following morning. So he offered us food and -- and lodging,\nwithout payment. When we -- we got up the following day, Thanassis apparently having\nreflected on -- on the situation, and he really didn\u2019t give me many reasons, but he said to -\n- to me, very clearly, \u201cI really cannot proceed any further. I understand that in your case,\u201d\n-- because the only other choice that was available is to join ELAS, who -- who were only\n30 or 40 kilometers away from Kardhitsa. \u201cI understand your situation, but I cannot, and I\nwill therefore return to Athens.\u201d But he had no more money, I had no money left. We\nembraced, I thanked him. We took I-leave of each other, and I mentally, visually, still\nremember seeing him walking, because even the directions, he wasn\u2019t going to take a\nhighway, there was no such thing, or a route, so he\u2019s following the railroad tracks. So I --\nI see the railroad tracks, and Thanassis walking. It\u2019s like a -- the end of a -- of a movie, as\nit fades, you know, in the -- in the background. So, I then asked the --",
        "A: Yeah? I\u2019m sorry, yes --",
        "A: All right.",
        "A: The -- it -- the former, but let\u2019s be careful.",
        "A: ELAS was not a Communist group.",
        "A: In included, obviously, but it was not a Communist group.",
        "A: Only for --",
        "A: Right, right. And, it\u2019s only --",
        "A: No, but --",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right. It was a coalition of leftist parties.",
        "A: There\u2019s no question that it was dominated by the -- the far left, because they were the best\norganized group of resistance, but EAM ala -- EAM was the political side, and ELAS\nwas the -- the military side.",
        "A: But they were a conglomeration, and I met lots of people who had nothing to do with the\nCommunists up there. Perhaps later on, but it\u2019s -- it\u2019s appropriate now for me to tell you,\nbecause you asked me this question about Thanassis, that at the end of the war, when I\nreturned to Athens, within a couple of weeks there was the so-called troubles, between\nthe central government, now liberated. And I had not even had the chance to visit him\nand his parents, and thank them, and tell them that I have survived, and everything like\nthat, because this problem arose, where the streets now, there\u2019s shooting going on\nbetween factions. And it was at the end of December, after my return from concentration\ncamp, the British concentration camp, [indecipherable] in Egypt, that I learned that\nThanassis was killed during this month of -- or couple of weeks of trouble. So here again,\nin a different vein as my mother, here is another case of somebody who went with me, I\ndidn\u2019t have a chance to see him ag -- again after we -- we parted, but there\u2019s no question\nthat he was really a member of an extremely rabid right wing group. And therefore, it\nwould have been unthinkable for him to -- to -- to -- to join --",
        "A: No question.",
        "A: No, no, nothing. These thing, they\u2019re two separate things.",
        "A: So that\u2019s cr -- Thanassis 1s gone now, unfortunately.",
        "A: I asked the teacher, I said, well -- and he -- he -- it was very easy. He says, \u201cDo you see\nthe top of this mountain?\u201d And he pointed west, almost straight due west. \u201cThat\u2019s where\nyou go.\u201d And that\u2019s what it is. I just following that kind of thing, I began on the road,\nwhich is in the beginning a g -- visible road, and it fades into a -- a kind of a track, and it\ntook close to five hours to negotiate that. And I was reaching -- I could see the monastery\nbecoming bigger and bigger. But the biggest shock was just I think half an hour before I\nwent -- I got to the grounds of the monastery te -- all of the surrounding area of trees,\nforest, grass, all that, is filled up with Italian soldiers, but all of them armed. And I\u2019m\nwalking through, and I see partisans with beards talking to the Italians. Now, I know\nthere was an armistice, but of course I had no idea what had happened in the -- between,\nand I -- I -- especially armed Italians. But -- well, subsequently I learned it was a -- a\nregiment of Italian cavalry called Aosta, from the region in Italy, that voluntarily joined\nthe -- the partisans. And course I had more dealings with them. And so I got to the -- to\nthe monastery.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, they just chatting, and passing the day.",
        "A: And this -- this kid walking, and I reached the monastery, I saw a number of partisans,\nand some of them -- it was still early afternoon, the sun is still shining, although it\u2019s close\nto November. It was a warm day. And I don\u2019t know why they were naked to the waist,\nbut I learned subsequently why. But I asked to go and see the leader. And I was shown up\nto the leader, a tall man with a long beard. And I immediately -- I briefly told him that I\nhad come to join the partisans. He didn\u2019t laugh [indecipherable]",
        "A: He didn\u2019t laugh, but -- but at least he -- he smiled, he says, \u201cLook, th-this is -- this is\nextremely rough life, you are very young.\u201d And then, just as simply, I told him that I had\nno choice. I\u2019m a Jew, and the Germans are -- are persecuting us, and I cannot return to\nAthens. He says, \u201cAll right, stay. Stay.\u201d And that was the end of it. Tha --",
        "A: Yes, tha -- to convince him, yes, I told him I was a Boy Scout, he -- he laughed.",
        "A: Yes, he laughed. Then I went to the yard again, and finally I got enough courage to ask,\nbecause then I began to observe the partisans who were naked to the midriff, because\nthey were feeling their shirts. And I know what they were doing, they were killing lice,\nokay\u2019? They were delousing themselves, just -- and I, for me it was such a -- a -- a new\nthing to see fact, that I asked one of them who was doing it, how many had he killed. He\nlooked at me. Oh, such a crazy question. He didn\u2019t count. But to -- to sort of\n[indecipherable] he said, \u201c47.\u201d Such a great number. Little did I know that very quickly, I\nwill be doing exactly the same thing.",
        "A: No, no. I mean, he [indecipherable] all right, but we\u2019Il have to decide what we -- you\u2019re\ngoin -- we\u2019re gonna have you do. But almost immediately, the following day, I was then\nassigned the -- if I can call it the graveyard shift of being a telephone -- telephone\noperator. These telephones were military field telephones, strung with wires. And there\nwas a little room, this was a -- in a monastery, a former monastery, there were cells on all\nfloors. And there was a little telephone room. Now, my shift started around 11 o\u2019clock at\nnight. Before going there, I had to go to the commissary, or what -- yeah, to get a little tin\ncontainer that was filled with rough kerosene oil, because that was the only light that was\n[indecipherable], they had no electricity. So -- so we had this lamp with a wick. And I\nknew from the very first day after -- at the end of my shift, my throat, nose, and\neverything else were black, I would spit black stuff. I\u2019m inhaling the smoke that came out\nof that wick during -- during the -- the shift. Of course, when the phone would ring, then I\nwould respond, take notes. Times I was given messages to -- well, I remember the -- the\nsecond night, before starting my shift, again I was going to the commissary, but I have to\n-- to remind me -- myself and you that when you -- the first noticeable thing when you\nare in the mountains, and anyplace is how black and dark it is. In cities, even in a\ndarkened place, the glow of city lights still there. But in the mountains, two things are\nimmediately noticeable. The silence is deafening, literally, you hear nothing. That\u2019s why\nyou can hear things from a distance. And it\u2019s also very dark. But there were no lights in\nthe monastery corridors. So I\u2019m going to the mo -- to the commissary to fill my lamp\nwith oil, and then the first thing I know is one leg is going through a hole, and then\ninstinctively the other leg is going through a hole, and I\u2019m falling through space. And in -\n- in the middle of the fall, I hit a -- a beam on the side, and after a couple of other\nseconds, it was -- actually it only took a few seconds, I fell through two floors. And I -- I\nmust have screamed, in the process of falling, and they came running. I just got up.",
        "A: And they -- and they all marvel, and they thought that it was a miracle that it happened,\nthey said to me that you\u2019re -- I was particularly lucky.",
        "A: My introduction, and I stayed on on that particular job for about two weeks. And then for\nthe following two weeks, I was then made a messenger. I had to take messages to -- but\nto division headquarters. And the higher in rank was the military unit, the higher was also\nphysically, in the mountains, the division was higher and higher. And this is when I was\ngiven a rifle, I was given -- was an Italian rifle, and -- a -- a -- two rounds of -- of --",
        "A: Ammunition. Then I was then given the messages, and I was given the general direction\nof a -- just march that way. And I didn\u2019t know whether my destination was, and we\nwould meet an occasional shepherd tending goats or sheep, and you would say, how long\nis, and then mention the name of the place, and he would say half an hour. They have no\nconception of time in terms of the units that we use. You walk for another three hours,\nand it\u2019s still not there. And that\u2019s what I did for the next week or so.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, they -- th-they -- they just -- they -- they decided that now they needed somebody to\ncarry messages, and I became available, or I could be spared from the telephone thing.\nAfter all, as I said, there were three shifts, because the thing had to be tended all the time.\nAnd that\u2019s when I became a messenger, but when I returned from the last trek in\ndelivering a message, then there was a general retreat, because the Germans decided,\nwhich they did periodically, to do a sweep. And in fact, we could begin to see, at the\ndistance, the trucks coming up, and armored vehicles, you know, because they didn\u2019t\nhave tanks, or anything like that. And -- but this what -- what happened throughout the\noccupation, the Italians would sweep up from time to time. Sometimes light sweeps,\nsometimes very heavy. And this was a heavy sweep, so we are retreating. So, the\nmonastery was evacuated, the Italian soldiers also accompanied us, and we\u2019re going\nhigher and higher. There was no action, other than occasionally firing a gun out toward\nthe Germans, but we don\u2019t engage heavily armed enemy, that\u2019s not what partisan war 1s.\nAnd after about two or three weeks of going higher than, the Germans decided that they\nhad done as much damage as they -- they could, which really didn\u2019t do anything other\nthan burning some villages, they went back to the -- to the plains. And that\u2019s when, then,\nI was able to join a -- a real unit rather than a band, th-th-the -- the -- the -- the group that\nI saw in the monastery was a portion of a major unit, which the first regiment of\nThessaly, and the first regiment of Evzones, to which then I became -- I -- I joined.",
        "A: I\u2019m still having -- there were no clothes to go around, you know.",
        "A: I\u2019m still in the civilian clothes, which are beginning now to -- to tatter, and --",
        "A: -- also get dirty, and filthy, where I was able to scare up another pair of underwear to -- to\nchange, [indecipherable] if I see things of that kind. That\u2019s it. I still remember that\nfortunately, I don\u2019t know why, I had traveled from Athens to Kardhitsa wearing also a --\na blue overcoat, which was sort of a lined overcoat, maybe a treated fabric that will\nwithstand rain, but it was a very, very handy thing, because I went through a whole heavy\nwinter in -- with -- with only these clothes.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: They gave me the rifle [indecipherable] you know, the -- the -- the cartridges were in a\nclip, five to a clip, and they -- they pull the -- I forget now all these terms which I f --\nknow from the army, and you push the clip down, push the bolt back again, and you are\nready to fire. I had never fired a rifle, and I still remember I\u2019m marching about an hour\naway from the monastery. I\u2019m in the middle of a natural plateau in the middle of the\nmountain, there\u2019s nobody around. Total silence. And I fire the first bullet of my life, just\nto -- to even get familiar with the sound. I didn\u2019t fire at anybody --",
        "A: -- was toward -- towards the sky. But I -- that\u2019s the first time I fired.\nTape #6",
        "A: Right. I should have go-got interviewed by an officer, not -- he was not the commanding\nofficer of the regiment, and I think they are probably debating about what -- to have me\ndo. Certainly I was not either trained, or old enough to join a -- a -- a fighting unit. And\nthen, the -- the same afternoon, I am called to go and talk to the second in command. Let\nme parenthetically note that in ELAS there was always dual leadership. There was the\nmilitary commander -- I don\u2019t want to -- I -- th-the -- the -- the second in command, it\nwas not a rank, but he was the equivalent of a political officer. If you want to call it a\ncommissar, right? Well, they were called captanios, which 1s a gen -- generic name for\ncaptain, or -- or an officer of some rank. So I go to his office, and he told me that he has\nan important mission for me. He didn\u2019t know me, but he had ler -- known that I was from\nAthens, that I spoke French, and some Spanish, was a very important mission. He says,\n\u201cEvery year, the little rivlets, or even creeks, which are dry most of the year, but in\nspring, after the snows fall, then these creeks flood, and even the little rivers flood, and --\nand always there are people who drown. Now, our mission, or the mission I\u2019m going to\nentrust you with is this. Because we don\u2019t know when the next sweep is going to come,\nand we want to be sure that our line of retreat is available to us, we don\u2019t want to have to\nford something that\u2019s not passable. So what I want you to do is, I\u2019m going to put you in\ncharge here,\u201d I\u2019m 16 and a half years old, \u201cput you in charge of a -- a group. And there\u2019 Il\nbe two Italian officers, they are both engineers. And your mission is to go to a number of\nvillages,\u201d which had -- he had written down, near some of those rivers. \u201cAnd you will tell\nthem that you have orders for the village people to help you do two things. First, cut\ndown trees to provide material for building the bridge. The Italian officers would\nmeasure, and find the appropriate place, and then you would -- the villagers would help\nwith labor to cut the logs, and also with material such as nails, and things like this, as\nwell as labor, to assemble the bridge.\u201d And so he gave me official orders signed,\nwhatever it was, I don\u2019t even know if it -- there was a seal. So -- and then I was\nintroduced, there were in the outside, these two men, who had officer uniforms. They\nwere also armed, you know? Now, I did not know Italian, but between French and\nLadino, I could make out a few things, and we could begin to understand each other. I\nthink they had been briefed -- that\u2019s now th-the word, about what the -- the mission was.\nAnd so, the following morning, you have the Nehama group walking to our destination.\nAnd it took us --",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: Look, I -- I can only speculate that probably it was either a stupid, half-baked idea, or it\nwas a Serious idea, but a half-baked notion of how to implement it. Or, it 1s not they\nwanted to get rid of me, you know, from there, but I -- the -- the -- the -- the plausible\nexplanation is that 1 -- this was a real need, all right? That was not the only way to skin\nthat particular cat, or fording a bridge, but they thought, why don\u2019t we take advantage of -\n- because the military engineers are trained to do things like this using what locally\navailable materials are. So, it was not a crazy notion of trying to build -- and we aren\u2019t\ntalking about large rivers, I\u2019m talking maybe the biggest one that we -- we would have\nhad to do was for to five meters, which is 15 - 20 feet. Not -- we weren\u2019t talking about\nhuge things. So, the -- the -- the notion was certainly plausible, and necessary, you know,\nin order to maintain, you know, open slide of communication. You don\u2019t want to be\nretreating, and then suddenly have your backs to the river. But, I mean, if they wanted to\ndo it very seriously, they wouldn\u2019t have sent a 16 and a half year old boy, they would\nhave something else, maybe another contingent of two or three, who would then also\nparticipate in the actual building.

I mean, occasionally the conversation would\ncome back, because later on, when I was part of a real, ongoing military unit, after thes --\nthis mission of -- that I returned from. And there was a large contingent of regimental\nheadquarters, where we were really living, and staying together, and talking. Then we\nstarted exchanging, but in the first month or two, most of the time we are talking about is\n-- first of all, the next preoccupation, or the only preoccupation is what are you going to\neat, because there 1s no food to be had there. This 1s not a unit where you\u2019re going to go\nfor chow, when something rings, you have to scrounge for things. So most of the th -- of\nthe time, and necessarily is you\u2019re thinking about only one thing, survival.",
        "A: Oh, right.",
        "A: Failed mission. Very briefly we went to the first village, I approached the teacher, I\nshowed him the orders. And they said, sure, sure. The following morning we will gather,\nsure, sure, because they put us up for the evening. They were a little skittish I could see in\ntheir eyes of that -- of having to b -- to also host two Italian officers, armed. Because you\ngot to remember, for the previous two years, that region -- you know from time to time\nyou would have incursions of Italians who would burn their villages. I mean, I saw the\nrems of that, the hulks of -- of just nothing but walls with -- with the open sky. But at\nleast they did not a-attack us. They would put us up. But they wouldn\u2019t show up. And\nalthough tried to get [indecipherable] would say again following morning, the long and\nthe short is we went through two or three other villages with almost identical results. But\nthe -- the third or fourth village, it was just, I think, after Christmas of \u201943, maybe\nDecember 28 or 29. We got to this village, and -- although the sa -- the story was the\nsame tomorrow, but they didn\u2019t put us up in a house in that -- in that village. Instead they\nguided us something like close to a half an hour walk from the village. And in the middle\nof nowhere there was a little barn, and it was two stories. And in the lower part was a\ntethered donkey, and the upper was just a -- a room, but it had a fireplace. So he says,\n\u201cThis 1s where you\u2019re going to -- to stay for your -- during your stay.\u201d All right. So that\u2019s\nwhere we slept the first night. When we got up the following morning, it had begun to\nsnow incessantly, which continued for a week. Now, very quickly we were totally\nsnowbound. Fortunately -- I mean, the way we survived is once a day, around midday or\nso, a poor, elderly woman from the village would trudge all that distance, with a sack of\nroughly ground corn flour. And that\u2019s our subsistence, we would take the corn flour and\nmelt some snow, knead it into some kind of a dough, and pat it to a semblance of a bread,\nand then we would burn it on the fireplace. That\u2019s what we ate. Now, the -- I think the\nsecond week, she brought us an egg. And we were, of course, you know, we haven\u2019t seen\nanything like this, and we were overjoyed, but very quickly we decided that it would be --\nto divide it into three -- I mean, we would not even feel it in our mouths. So we decided\nto keep it as a symbol of our eventual deliverance, both from the snow outside of that\n[indecipherable] the mission as well as the war, because -- and then I continue, very\nquickly, I mean we used the egg to play games with the mice. The mice would come out\nat night, because it was the gallery of all the [indecipherable]. And we had not thought,\nwe had left the egg someplace, and then in the glow of -- still of the fire -- we used to go\nout and gather branches, and burn them. We saw how mice steal the egg. One mouse\ntakes it in 1t\u2019s paws, and sort of -- and the others drag it by the tail. So we discovered the\ngame, so we used to take the egg, and have bets made, and races. We would leave it like\nthis, and then we see the mouse come, and we say -- the bet was how fast he will get to\nthe hole, of course, by the time he reached the hole, we grab the egg again, and -- so\nthat\u2019s the way -- and that\u2019s how I began to learn Italian because spending all day long, we\nused to sing Italian songs. And I clearly remember the first day that -- when the s-snow\nended, it was the kind of a thing that you know when the snow clears, and the -- the sky is\ncompletely s -- cloud free, and bright, blinding brightness because of the white, and we\nheard that drone of aircraft, which was an incredible sound. And we look up, and we see\nhuge formations of bombers, which we di -- concluded couldn\u2019t be anything but allied,\nbecause the Germans didn\u2019t have very much of an air force. And -- and -- and -- and I\nthink in retrospect, because we -- I know I can tell you, I can -- the direction which they\nwere flying, namely northeast, they probably were coming from Italy to bomb the oil\nfields in Ploesti in Romania. So, you know, we could almost -- the kind of a thing that we\nall three of us looked up, and -- and sort of begged that the day will come for us very\nquickly. So, after -- after the second week there, we, you know, concluded that we were\nnot going to get anywhere, especially now since the ground was covered with snow, even\nif things had changed, the attitude had changed. So, we -- I had lost also a sense of\norientation where we were. Where is the nearest partisan unit? We had been on the road\nfor practically a month. So I was told, and we were pointed to some direction, and we got\nthere, and the first person I saw was Saby Shabetai, my friend and neighbor from our\napartment in Athens. I approached him, I addressed him, he turned around, he says,\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d And when I told him, he was, you know, horrified, dismayed. I must\nhave been filthy, in rags, you know, uncombed, literally dirty, because we had no means\nof bathing, washing, or anything like that, as well as, of course, hungry. But -- so that\u2019s\nwas regimental headquarters, and that\u2019s the unit I then became part of for the remaining\nof my --",
        "A: No, no, he was --",
        "A: Saby told me very quickly -- Saby, he was a very clever fellow, but he didn\u2019t have any\ntraining like I did. He was two years older. He became a spy. And that was, he would --\nhe would go to Trikala, wer -- w-wearing decent civilian clothes, and I guess he -- there\nmust have been contacts, and he would stay with them, but he would -- the spy part was\nthey try to find out movements. Are there convoys of trucks, or is there a train that\u2019s\ncoming, passing, that\u2019s laden. So that if there would be any action to be taken against\neither a convoy of trucks, or a con -- or -- or blow up a train, [indecipherable], the British\nhad much greater network of intelligence 1n Greece, and all the major actions that took\nplace was always because the British knew, and then they would -- they would agree with\nthe guerrillas, to blow up a train, or to destroy a bridge, the [indecipherable] the most\nmajor action was done at the request of the British. And a big viaduct was blown up. That\nwas quite a few months before my arrival. During my time, there were two actions of\nblowing up bridges in the area where my regiment operated. I was not involved in that.",
        "A: Eventually, yes, I took a bath, there were no showers, a -- a bath, and -- and given a --\nactually, we were -- the pants I had -- oh, and then, I had lost my shoes, because in fo --\nin fording up one of the rivers, I was told by a partisan, which is true in all armies, that\nwhen you are going to cross a river, tie the shoelaces, and tie them around the rifle, and\nhold them like that. So I don\u2019t know, maybe I didn\u2019t tie them well enough, and we\u2019re in\nthe middle of this little rivlet, this little stream, but it\u2019s quite swift, and one of the shoes\nfalls, and I -- I see disappearing down, and it\u2019s going too fast for me to do anything. So I\nwas left with one shoe. So I thought, okay, I will wear only one shoe, but it\u2019s bad,\nbecause then you begin to hurt all over. So I threw the other one out, and I was barefoot.\nAll of this time, the snow, and so forth, it was -- I was totally barefoot. But the pants\nsurvived, after my return, after they were washed by a villager. And I was given a tunic.\nAt the top -- a tunic, an Italian soldiers tunic, but no shoes, but a -- a villager gave me\npigskin shoes, it\u2019s just a piece of pigskin, which is then pierced, and tied with -- with\nstring. Which is all right, it\u2019s like a ballet slipper that you use, which 1s fine. But two\nweeks later, when I was asleep, a dog ate one of the shoes, because it was food for them.",
        "A: Fortunately not, you know, the feet would get very, very cold, and the -- the -- the\nItalians, you know, maybe they had been taught, or they knew, they were much, of\ncourse, older than I am, to rub -- rub them with snow. And if you do that, I don\u2019t think\nit\u2019s the rubbing with snow, but rubbing them fast, it just restores the blood circulation.\nThis is what you have to make sure, you know, fortunately I didn\u2019t get frostbite. But three\nweeks after my arrival at headquarters, I got, you know, pleurisy, a very bad cold, I mean,\nwhen a little bit of fluid collects in -- in the pleura, not the lungs, but in the pleura. And --\nbut there was a ni -- a little infirmary, and had an Italian doctor, I can still remember him,\nhe was a -- a short, very intelligent looking Sicilian. He was almost entirely black, from\nbrown skin, but very, very capable, very clever with -- practically had no facilities, but\ntook care of his patients.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.",
        "A: Everything was -- was fine.",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "A: Just simply to be covered, you know, with additional blankets. They -- they had no --\nthere -- there were no medicines to be had. Sulfa was beginning to be known at that time,\nand of course, they were equipped in their own army, but we didn\u2019t have su-such\nsupplies.",
        "A: Yes, unfortunately be -- behind -- 1t was in a -- in a abandoned church, an old church, and\nso looking out of the window was the cemetery. It was not a -- and I remember another\nfellow patient and I were talking, and we were s -- thinking that, well okay, they won\u2019t\nhave very far to travel if we have to end up there.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: After I got sick and recover, I was --",
        "A: -- because by that time, there was also another transformation that had taken place a few\nmonths before my arrival in the partisans, namely the partisans became organized as a\nmodern army, with echelons, distinct divisions, regiments, battalions, companies. At least\non paper, all right? And -- whereas before, these were independent units, marauding,\ndoing whatever they could, but this was put on a much more professional footing,\nbecause by that time, the -- the man in command of the entire ELAS was General\nSarafias, who was a professional military officer before the war. So when I then was\nassigned to the regiment -- now the -- the regimental commander was a -- a man who\npermanent [indecipherable] was a major in the former Greek army, by the name of\nKarfis. And he happened to have as an adjutant, a recent graduate of the military -- Greek\nmilitary academy. So he was the usual, you know, not spit and polish, because we didn\u2019t\nhave the things for that, but saluting, although there wasn\u2019t s-so much saluting with the\npartisans, you know. The method of addressing each other was synagonistis, which\nmeans fellow fighter. It was -- it wasn\u2019t comrade, it wasn\u2019t mister. It was even t -- with an\nofficer of superior rank, you would address him as fellow fighter, and then his name. So,\nbecause I think of the fact that my background, finishing high school, command of a\nlanguage, and so forth, I was given a -- a clerical job, primarily enciphelment -- codes.\nBecause by that time, there were even radios, and nearby, because very near the\nregimental place, there was the -- the airfield, if I can call it that, 1t was just a bare piece\nof ground, but it was situated in the natural plateau, the one that I fired, remember?",
        "A: My first rifle. And when in the su -- in the summer months, when the | -- land was dry,\nthen it was able to support the weight of an aircraft, and they would fly them over there,\nfrom Egypt, and for missions back and forth. And because of the proximity, then there\nwas a permanent detachment of British officers, liaison officers, that have been\nparachuted, or brought by aircraft, next to our regimental headquarters. So at times, I\nwould then be asked to go -- I did not know English, but some of them, some of the\nEnglish officers knew French, and I was able to converse. Plus they were the only ones\nthat had long range, short wave radios. You know, the rest of -- I mean, the partisans,\nonly division had a radio, and in our headquarters we didn\u2019t have a radio in the\nbeginning, so everything had to be through again, field telephony. But by then, it was\nnecessary, because of certain engagements, to encode messages, and so I was pressed in\nthat job.",
        "A: Well, you know, no clerical job is interesting, everything becomes routine a little bit, but\nit was -- the thing that that -- am-amazed me 1s that after awhile, I didn\u2019t have to look at\nthe decoding book to decode text. I had begun to learn, and -- and visualize the -- the\ndecipherment -- th-the [indecipherable] and -- but I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t want to sh -- people\nto see that, because, you know, I was told that -- that, you know, if you eventually\nmemorize it, then -- then you -- if you are ever caught, then under torture you may reveal\nthe codes, although I\u2019m sure that the things that they had to communicate were not of\nmomentous strategic im-importance to --",
        "A: Yeah, but -- bu-but, you do that -- we didn\u2019t have -- 1n all that -- I\u2019m talking about\npractically from February through November, practically the nine months that I -- my\nremain -- stayed with the partisans service, we changed codes routinely only twice. So\nthere wasn\u2019t that kind of a [indecipherable] because I don\u2019t think they were high level\ncodes. But they were important to us, and -- well, th-that was not the only thing I had to\ndo. Then the adjutant orders had to be typed. We had -- we found a ramshackle\ntypewriter, and some paper. I was the only one who was able to use that and type some\norders.",
        "A: Sort of. More of the two or three fingers, which I still have to use today.",
        "A: No, no, no, no. Again, because it was regimental headquarters -- now, it\u2019s fighting units,\nand sabotage are in the region. I mean, if I drew a circle, it would probably cover, you\nknow, a radius of 50 - 60 kilometers. 40 miles, you know, because the [indecipherable]\nadjacent things. By that time, in the beginning of the partisan war, the major things that\nthe partisans had to do -- wa-wanted to do, was A, kill known collaborators, primarily to\nelevate the morale of the people. You know, begin to give them a sense that there are\npeople who are protecting them. That those who collaborate with the enemy are going to\nget their just desserts. And because you cannot fight heavy engagements, there were\noccasional skirmishes, and fi -- and attacks with -- with isolated Italian, or -- or German\nunits. But in our sector, when we begun to do a systematic thing of attacking convoys\nbecause our unit was the nearest to the main road that goes from Trikala to eventually\nKardhitsa, and then Lamia, and so forth, to south [indecipherable] Greece. So that -- that\nwas essentially the -- the -- the mission, if I can call it, of the regiment. We -- we never\ngot engaged. We don\u2019t do that with the -- the light weapons. The heaviest weapons I\nremember we had in the whole regiment was two heavy machine guns. You can\u2019t engage\nan enemy that has armory units, with two heavy machine guns.",
        "A: All right.\nEnd of Tape #6\nTape #7",
        "A: Right, well, most of the spring, we knew -- first of all to us, through the British\nconnection, primarily, as well as independently, the Greek connections, because of\ncourse, division talk to the agency in Athens, or the top command of ELAS. So -- but it\nwould come to us two or three weeks late. So it primarily still involves the -- the\ncampaign in Italy. The -- the great event occurs June six, when Normandy occurs in the\nwar. We -- we get also news of the eastern front. But that was the -- the -- the first major\nevent. That really didn\u2019t have an immediate effect, other than si -- psychological, that\nnow these two great parts of the allies are converging. But I think through a -- the stream\nof -- of messages coming from division, and from ELAS headquarters, definitely show an\nincrease in the pace of operations, for two reasons. First of all, visibly, from reports,\nGermans are abandoning smaller towns, and concentrating in major arteries now. Why\nwould they do that, since no -- no -- nobody thought that the Greece itself was about to be\ninvaded by allied troops. So -- so that was one -- one reason. Then, also, the news began\nto -- to trickle down again. We had more contact even from tiko partisans, who had much\nbetter communications, and already we began to see that the Russians are approaching\nthe silent part of Europe, namely the Balkans, and it doesn\u2019t take a strategic, Napoleonic\nmind, a short look at the map indicates that -- because Greece is al-almost like a\npeninsula, the bottom of the Balkans, if the Russians were advancing that much, I think\nwhich eventually what happened is that the Germans would have an untenable position in\nthis. So, this explains why the Germans were consolidating their lines, and because in the\nmeantime, attempts had been made by the British mission to try to unite the warring\nfactions of the Greek resistance. And eventually, in the -- in June or July of \u201944, there was\na--as--a signed agreement that was signed by representatives in the Middle East, in\nLebanon, I believe, Beirut, which then held until the end of the war. So -- so we had this\npace going on. But again, the day to day life for -- for us, food was very scarce, as usual,\nalthough it was regimental headquarters, th-they didn\u2019t grow crops or -- or other food.\nAlso clothing, and -- and -- and sanitary conditions were not -- I mean, if you went to\nsleep at night, especially in -- in the winter, well in the middle of the night, you know,\npeople are getting -- or you sleep on the floor, people are getting up and stepping\n[indecipherable] sometimes on bodies, make their way to -- to go out, maybe to relieve\nthemselves. But very often it was not for that reason. You would go up, and open the\ntunic to let the cold air come in to quiet the lice, because in sleeping ne -- bodies next to\neach other, the lice begin to get warm, and begin to -- to move, and you -- it\u2019s not\nparticularly pleasant, and to quieten them again, you go out, open the tunic, let the cold\nin, and they quiet for a bit, and you sleep for another hour or two. Th-This -- this -- this\npersisted until when it became real warm in the mountains, May, June, and on, because\nthen you could go bathe in the streams, and that would -- we used to do that every day,\nand at times it effectfully -- eventually happened to me later on, a month or two later,\nwhen I went swimming, and I had been perspiring, running to get to the place to swim,\nand I must have caught a cold, which was then misdiagnosed as malaria, and I had other\nproblems. But this was -- the pace noticeably started. There were more action from our\nunits in the [indecipherable], plus the -- the clear indication where they had come from\nheadquarters in the Middle East, or from ELAS headquarters, to harass Germans, even\nnotably those who were retreating and going north, but not to attempt any major action,\neven if we were able to. The reason being that they didn\u2019t want to infuriate the Germans,\nbecause fay -- they didn\u2019t really have to infuriate them, they were doing that anyhow in\nmany cases, namely, a scorched earth policy, they attempted to blow up the port facilities\nin Pireas, and it was only a last minute action by the partisans in the city, that averted the\nblowing up of port facilities in Pireas. So -- so noticeably we saw the pace accelerate.",
        "A: I?",
        "A: I hadn\u2019t seen any action, I -- only action I saw was a -- a month later, which was -- came\nout in -- inadvertently. I don\u2019t think I had -- I -- I knew that it wasn\u2019t a question of\nroughness or the danger, but that really I had no experience, and I had seen enough of\nwhat had been going on to know that I should not be entrusted with lack of appropriate\ntraining, on -- on anything major.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, food was always, I think once a day. And most of the time, because that which was\n-- was available were -- I still remember them, black eyed -- they look like black eyed\npeas, or black eyed beans. But these were from old, even sometimes abandoned\ngovernmental warehouses. There -- the villagers would make flour available, whatever\nthey were able to do. And those things were usually spoiled rotten, and you\u2019d find little\ncrawling worms inside, but not after boiling, we used to joke that we would eat meat also,\nwhile eating the -- the beans. But, again, rel-relief would come from hunger in -- in the\nsummertime, when -- because of vegetables [indecipherable] vegetables. I forgot what\nyou asked me --",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah. Well, the only way to relieve hunger --",
        "A: -- and that\u2019s where I learned to smoke, but we didn\u2019t have tobacco. So you would take\nleaves from trees, and dry them, and crunch them, and usually find a piece of newspaper.\nIn -- in the area where we were, a governmental warehouse had been raided and tons,\nliterally tons of contraband cigarette paper, which was -- used to be sold legally to roll\ncigarettes, had been found. But because it had been contraband, it was so massive, you\ncannot burn paper so easily, as you know, even in fireplace, if you put a book, it takes --\nit\u2019s hard to burn it. So, the government had fumigated these warehouses with sulfur,\nwhich had permeated the cigarette paper, so if you use that, which was from some\nrespects easy, but it stunk, and smelled, and tasted of sulfur so much, we use newspaper.\nThe problem with the newspaper is you take a puff, and it -- a flame at the end of the\nthing, instead of burning as a [indecipherable] a flame burning. And this is the reason\nwhy, it was primarily to assuage hunger.",
        "A: Right, right, yeah.",
        "A: Later on, occasionally, somebody would find -- because that region of Greece also is a\ntobacco growing region, which wa -- we were able to find tobacco [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: Oh yes, there is no question, because first of all, there is no question that without the\nsupport of the -- the people who had suffered a great deal, who also knew that harboring\nvillagers, really almost invited punitive raids by the Italians, by the Germans. And in\nspite of that they persisted, and without them I think no -- not only our movement, I think\nno partisan movement can possibly exist, survive, let alone thrive, and operate.",
        "A: And -- and also, you know, poems, and --",
        "A: Right, yeah.",
        "A: Sure, sure.",
        "A: No, the only Italian, or foreign partisan songs that I -- I learned was from a captured\nGerman soldier, who turn out to have been a -- formerly in --in Nazi prisons, but as the\nwar 1s progressing, and manpower is lowest, the Germans began to free -- free, I mean let\nthe prisons out, and sometimes eventually including criminals. But first they started with\npolitical prisoners, former Communists, Leftists, Social Democrats, you -- you name it.\nBut when they set them free, so to speak, they put them in special German units, in fact\nthey had a number, I forget it, it was 888, or 999, something like that. And they were\nnever let in big numbers, they were dispersed and sent throughout Europe. And generally\nthey would be given menial, or clerical, or support jobs, so they were not in any armed\nway, or possibly representing a risk to the other German military. And so he -- he -- he\nwas captured, after he came also willingly, and he was acting in some cases as an\ninterpreter when we captured others, and interrogate them, and he taught me all kinds of\nsongs that were sung throughout Europe in French -- I learned the in -- the Internationale\nin French, a couple of partisan songs in German, some in it -- lots of them in Italian.

And it literally means we are not -- we are not afraid, we are\nnot scared of German guns, or of the Fascist swords, because we are all fighting for\ndemocracy and freedom.",
        "A: Many, many tunes, you know, as you know, they came from partisan, Russian partisan\nsongs, but with Greek words, yes.",
        "A: Right, the -- that\u2019s right, the only one that I participated.",
        "A: Well very quickly, one -- one morning, if I -- I remember, it was close to 10 o\u2019clock in\nthe morning, and I was sort of manning the telephone, and it rang, and they asked the\nother -- at the other end, to speak to the colonel. So, but I couldn\u2019t get the colonel, I got\nthe adjutant. Well, very quickly what tran-transpired, regimental headquarters was in a\npart that was really a short distance from the plains of Thessaly, but it was a -- a suitable\nelevation. And there was a -- a kind of like an entry, a pass, a mountain pass, and\nessentially what the telephone call said is four or five or six German trucks have entered\nthis pass, which had been manned by a very small unit of partisans, about five or six. And\nwe, of course knew that coming to the pass and going south, ended in a cul-de-sac,\nbecause there was nothing, after you\u2019ve gone for another kilometer, just there was a w --\na mountain wall. So, when they saw that happening, you know, that\u2019s why they called to\nalert us. They were not able, those who were guarding the pass, to engage how many\nGermans there would be, and the nearest unit that -- of a sufficient strength, was at least\nthree or four hours away. So very quickly the commanding officer decided that the\n[indecipherable] is to fool the Germans into thinking that they are surrounded, that there\nare many more than actually we were. So he dispatched anybody who could walk,\nincluding us clerical personnel in the regimental unit, to go, so we grabbed the -- our\nweapons, and after running for about 45 minutes, and out of breath, you could see down\nin that cul-de-sac, and all the -- the Germans had se -- literally circled the wagons, and\nsome of them had gone hiding. And as they were being fired by the unit that was\nguarding the pass, they would return -- was rifle fire, they didn\u2019t have anything heavy.\nAnd so we started firing at them, and they were firing at us. And they -- since they saw\nthings coming from both directions, they really concluded that they were in -- in dire\nstraights. And we were afraid that they would communicate via radio to their original\nunit, and they would come to relieve them, with a much bigger force. But apparently,\nthey either didn\u2019t have radio, or if they had, they didn\u2019t know where they were, see, they\ngot lost. And by that time, in about three hours, or -- the main fighting unit came, and\nstarted -- the partisan unit, firing at the Germans, and then, after about a few minutes, you\nbegin to see a white flag, but just before that happened, suddenly there was a little noise,\nor -- or -- or sound near where I was behind a rock. And at the same time that I heard the\nsound, I also felt a -- kind of a -- of a pain, temporary pain in the right knee, and when I\nbend down I saw it was a tear, and something -- oozing a little bit of blood. And it must\nhave some part of a -- of a bullet that had hit a rock and splintered, and part of the thing\nricocheted, but it didn\u2019t go inside, I didn\u2019t find anything, it wasn\u2019t a major wound, and it\ndidn\u2019t hurt, but nev-nevertheless when I was taken to [indecipherable] I was bandaged by\na woman who turned out to be a Jewish woman, who had gone to school for midwives,\nwith a -- a -- a young girl, who was next door neighbors to us. So -- but it was the only\naction that I saw. I mean we -- we -- the number of Germans killed was, I think, eight or\nnine, and two were wounded, they were carried out with a litter and three prisoner.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh ye -- you shoot -- you, first of all, we di -- we -- we didn\u2019t see -- we didn\u2019t shoot at the\nsoldiers, because the only thing [indecipherable] was the trucks, so we s -- we sh -- we\naimed --",
        "A: At -- at the -- not the trucks so much, but again, it was psychological to impress them that\nfire is coming from both directions, so they feel that they are trapped, and they -- which\nthey were.",
        "A: The three who were captured --",
        "A: -- the two were -- I think one was a very young -- young fellow. I can still remember, he\nmust have been really almost my age, really -- at least he looked it -- like that. And I\nremember he, all throughout the time that he\u2019s marched, and taken up to -- he\u2019s yelling\nGerman curses, which I do not understand, and heil Hitlers interspersed with German\ncurses. [indecipherable] And when we got there, he was then in-interviewed, or\ninterrogated by this German solider, who came out, and he told me in French, because\nthat\u2019s how I communicated with him, in French, that it was a hopeless case of a fanatic\nmember of the Hitlerjugend, who -- and I think he was -- he was shot -- actually not shot,\nhe was killed, but again, because of a bullet was a scarcity, I didn\u2019t see it, I didn\u2019t witness\nit, but the following day I was told that they had cut his throat. Also, it would have been a\nlittle hard to carry, I mean, we be-began to be more ba -- mobile, and we didn\u2019t have the\nfacilities to -- to carry extra.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, no, no.",

        "A: Well, it was not a -- a --",
        "A: Yeah, a mix thing, but I mean at least the -- the -- the British -- they didn\u2019t incarcerate\nthemselves, but they made arrangements with the local gendarmerie in Kardhitsa to -- to\nguard them. That\u2019s after we begun to descend.",
        "A: From the mountains. We kept them until then.",
        "A: They were not. Th-The British meddled a lot in -- since -- in fact, after the -- the War of\nIndependence in 1821, they always thought of Greece as a -- a part of their own\nbackyard. But, look, they -- they were primarily, interested as they should have been, in\nmaking sure that the Germans felt the brunt -- whether it was harassment, or actual, you\nknow, telling action like blowing up bridges and so forth. Because if nothing else, it kept\nunits pinned down. Now, we could not account for pinning, you know, crack divisions,\nbut anything, you know, a help. But there\u2019s no question that they were much more\ninclined to help the Zervas forces than -- but, eventually they saw the -- the light, and --\nand it was almost like a kind of contract. You take this action, blow up this convoy, and\nthen the next two weeks, liberators would -- would uppen, so I -- we used to go and that\u2019s\nwhen I got my first shoes, after an air drop.",
        "A: Finally, yes.",

        "A: Right.",
        "A: No, it began to be visible in beginning of August, even --",
        "A: -- it was -- maybe the ending of August, in two ways. First of all, because our units are\nmore active -- but I have to tell you that I can remember it now in my mind\u2019s ear, because\nI had never heard all these months the sound of artillery. You know, there\u2019s no artillery in\npartisan, but now you begin to hear, at a great distance, this dull thud, boom, boom,\nboom. And at night, you know, it\u2019s not a heavy sound, it\u2019s not continuously\n[indecipherable] but it\u2019s there. And at night you hear the same sound, but at the same\ntime you see also the illumination in the horizon. So you -- you -- you know somebody is\nfiring, all right? So essentially what\u2019s -- what\u2019s happened is by then the Germans are in\nvery well organized retreat, they\u2019re abandoning Greece. And of course, that\u2019s understood,\nand known, and so the partisans units physically are themselves beginning to move first\nto harass the rear of the departing Germans, but also to get low, because the lower parts\nnow are themselves free. So -- so it became a combination of news, combination of an\naction, a combination of hearing things, seeing things, and then beginning to assess the\n[indecipherable] because as soon as these things started, headquarters wasn\u2019t going to\nstay in the rear where we were. We be -- ousess began to descend to lower elevations.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: That -- at least -- I mean, 1 -- I cannot le -- I did not hear --",
        "A: -- at all. Whether it was known, or whether it was known at the higher levels, at\nheadquarters, I do -- I don\u2019t think so, because for example, I read the memoirs of\nYugoslav partisans, some of them Bitola Jews, one of them, Zamilla Kolomonos, who\nwas my fa -- my mother\u2019s maiden name, although no relation. And they only find out at\nthe end of the war, because coincidentally, Ilia Aaronburg, the Russian author, had been\nto a tour of concentration camps, and who had been a -- obviously -- apparently to\nTreblinka, and who told the survivors, 67 out of 3500 Bitola Jews, that all were\nexterminated in Treblinka with no survivors. So I don\u2019t think that this kind of thing was -\n- was known until really I think se -- the Russians I think, because they wer -- they were\nthe first that liberated parts of Poland. You know, my brother, when they had to abandon\nAuschwitz, was because of the approaching Russians. So I think through that way, but it\ndid not reach the partisans, certainly, and I think even -- even after we were liberated, we\ndidn\u2019t understand the kind, as well as the magnitude, both in -- in -- in kind, and -- and --\nand -- and size of the horror that had occurred.\nEnd of Tape #7\nTape #8",
        "A: All right.",
        "A: Either I did not know, or did not learn about the --",
        "A: -- the extermination?",
        "A: It\u2019s very hard not to -- to put myself in a kind of a frame at -- of mind that I had at that\ntime, and try to speculate what it would have caused if -- 1f I had known. I s -- I think, as\nI mentioned earlier -- perhaps we were off camera, I don\u2019t recall any more, that it\u2019s a lot -\n- both easier for me, and much more pleasant in my mind, to tell you what my mind was\noccupied with during -- especially the su -- the late summer months, as we begin to really\nmore than hope now, we can see this being a tangible, reachable goal, to be liberated.\nThat more increasingly, my thoughts are, constantly are with the family, and of course\nthe big unknown. And I -- I -- I can still remember going on long walks in the middle of\nthe mountains, and sitting on a rock, and looking at the horizon, beyond which you\ncannot see, because the next ridge intervenes, and try to go mentally beyond that ridge,\nand then I would see the family. See, it -- I mean, picture them in my -- in my mind, but\nalmost all the thought were, no matter how they started, were all how things are going to\nbe, not how things they were, but how they are going to be, and I was -- it was this -- this\nfeeling that with liberation there will be really I -- a -- a greater, brighter thing for\neverybody, and now the experience in the mountains and so forth, had begun to ba -- I -- I\ngrew up, almost overnight.",
        "A: I had -- I don\u2019t think I had another childish thought after I -- after the monastery in\nMessenikolas. So this is what was -- I was preoccupied with, that I -- that I would have to\ngo to the university, and how it will be with my mother, my father, and my brothers. How\nI would able to guide them, and with all my experience. So that was what was\npreoccupying -- you know, it would have been te-terrible, you know, to -- to -- to have\nhad these kinds of things be disturbed by if we had learned what was actually happening.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, perhaps temperamentally, I\u2019ve always been much more f-forward looking -",
        "A: -- than retrospective looking. And it\u2019s essential for me to have a -- an objective, so I\nwould always formulate objectives that would be reached, that I can then act on. And\nthat\u2019s what was the primary -- and the -- the -- the closer this thing is -- is coming, the\nmore eager I am to -- to do it.",
        "A: Very quickly, the thing that -- like many things like that happen very quickly, and that\nwas -- towards the tail end of September, maybe beginning of October, we are issued\norders that indeed we have to start descending down, and we physically begin to descend,\nand out of nowhere, I thought no one -- because I had -- in the month I had never seen\nthat, a tiny little Fiat automobile, which was a -- a captured It-Italian army vehicle, which\nI think the Italians called topolino, which means little mouse, which was -- it was smaller\nthan a VW. And that\u2019s where -- there was a driver -- imagine that little thing, four people.\nAn-And I don\u2019t know why, here\u2019s the colonel sitting in the passenger seat in front, and in\nthe rear seat is the adjutant, who has the rank of a captain, and me. But it\u2019s almost -- what\n-- as we are unload -- or taking the few files that we took with us, and maybe because I\nwas helping, I just got in, and that\u2019s it. So for hours we are driving down very rough\nroads and things like this, stopping every so often, until finally, towards 10 or 11 o\u2019clock\nat night, we stop someplace to -- for a relieve and -- and even to have a bite that we had\ncarry with us. And we slept on the ground, and we are already now in the plains of\nThessaly. And the following morning as we are ready again to -- to proceed, the colonel\nturns the adjutant and says, \u201cWhat\u2019s Nehama doing here?\u201d I mean, I\u2019ve been with him for\na whole day, talking and driving. He just then realized that I was there, apparently. Out.\nSo without any other thing, I\u2019m ordered out of the vehicle in the middle of nowhere, and\nthey left me. I mean, I had my rifle, and a few personal belongings. But -- but -- but soon,\nvery soon, I -- I could hear even a truck coming, and it was a truck that the -- the g -- the\npartisans had commandeered, and it was -- so they stopped, and I -- I got on.",
        "A: And it took us to -- to Trikala. So as I said, these things occur very, very fast. And in fact\nwhen I was left, and then I boarded the truck, that\u2019s was the first time when I saw visual\nevidence of the German retreat, because on the side of the road, there were burned\nvehicles, because they had been attacked, and I saw a considerable num -- number of\ndead German soldiers. Dead, in fact I still remember one of them on his back with a belly\ndistended, because you know the corpse inflates after awhile, and stinks. And these were\nvisual, you know, again, evidence, th-that -- that they finally had left. And so we reached\nTrikala. And I don\u2019t know whether we encamped someplace. But then, a couple of days\nlater, we were ordered to get to Larisa. Larisa is a much larger city, and happens to be a --\nalso most central city and strategic city, because the railroad line runs through Larisa. So\nI got to Larisa, and essentially I rejoined the regimental unit.",
        "A: Oh, nobody said that, I mean --",
        "A: Again, this is not a single event.",
        "A: So last night you\u2019re a slave, and the next your -- you\u2019re free. It\u2019s happens, but the reason\nI\u2019m say it happens with such rapidity 1s, we didn\u2019t -- we were not in constant touch, so we\ndid not know if indeed we finally have seen the last of the rear guard of the retreating\nGermans, you know? Units are moving up, but there may be others coming behind them.\nBut so -- so all these thing you are doing, partly by your feel of the terrain, and what\u2019s\nhappening in front of you, at the same time also, you\u2019re receiving orders which\nthemselves are -- are delayed because again, the communications are not what we have\ntoday. So it would take hours until you begin to get confirmation that yor -- you\u2019re f -- f -\n- eventually seeing the end of the German columns. Let alone that some of our outlying\nunits, on purpose were harassing the retreating Germans so to -- to speed them o-o-on\ntheir way.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: Yes. The moment I got to Trikala. You see, since I thought maybe it\u2019s a local situation --",
        "A: -- but there, I -- Is -- talked to people in the city, in -- and as well as other parts, as from\nother units, and because by that time they knew, because they knew that Athens was free,\nand Pelaponsis was free, and Lamia was free, and therefore they were free, and so that\u2019s -\n- that\u2019s when I knew that\u2019s it.",
        "A: I -- first of all, I -- I still remember that as we are coming down the mountains, almost as -\n- as we are reaching the plains, not on purpose, I think accidentally I turned west, and I\nsaw the retreating heights, where I spent the previous 13 months or so. It\u2019s almost like\nvisibly doing two things, thanking them for saving me, and two, you know, saying good-\nbye, that\u2019s why I\u2019ve had since then, a tremendous love and affinity for mountains. So that\nwhen -- when I finally got to Trikala, and I -- I -- and I was told that -- that then the rest\nof the country was free, there wasn\u2019t elation. I -- I -- I don\u2019t believe that either mentally,\nor psycholo -- it was definitely not a letdown, but it was a kind of calm that now said, all\nright, now you have to cease worrying about survival from the standpoint of an enemy\naction, all right, and what di -- the German represented. And soon you\u2019ve got to be able\nto gather forces to do what I had been planning to do in the mou -- in the mountains. So\nthere was -- it was a feeling of -- a great deal of something, some weight lifted from the\nmind, that that part you don\u2019t have to worry. But that didn\u2019t linger, and inst -- and it was\ns-supplanted by now, in the coming days, you\u2019re going to rejoin the family and you will\nthen be able to pursue what you\u2019ve been hoping to do. It was more serenity than elation. I\nmean elation was there, I mean we shouted a little bit, but it was -- it didn\u2019t last very long,\nthere was much more -- I don\u2019t know whether I had a presentiment, I -- I -- obviously I --\nI -- I didn\u2019t, but I -- it was -- I think others had the same thing, because when we went to\nLarisa, I met another Jewish boy, actually the son of the owner of the f -- company that\nmy father worked for, who was the -- almost the last person I could imagine would have\nbeen there. But he was there, and we had -- we talked for hours. And I think we almost\nshared similar -- had similar reaction to the events.",
        "A: Saby Camhi. He\u2019s -- he\u2019s been dead a number of years now.",
        "A: In -- that was in Larisa. In fact, the day after I -- I saw Saby Camhi, whom I encountered\nin -- it was a little park across the building where we were housed, and I had gone for a\nstroll. And the following day I was maybe typing something, or writing something, and\nsomebody come and told me that there 1s a lady at the office of the adjutant, which was\nnext to the colonel\u2019s office, asking for me. First of all, who could have possibly be asking\nfor me in Larisa? So if -- 1 -- I went there, and she told me her name, Popi Stassnopoulos,\nand she told me that she is passing on her way to Trikala, and somehow my parents has\nlearned that I was with this partisan unit. Maybe Saby Shabetai or his parents ha --\nbecause Saby still part of that. And so she had been asked by my father to get in touch\nwith me, bring me news of the family, and to urge me to go and see them as soon as\npossible. I had no thoughts of that yet, because I didn\u2019t know by what means I would -- I\nwould leave to do that. It didn\u2019t occur to me to do that -- first of all, it was really almost a\n-- a week or two after we -- no, less than that, and we -- we liberated. She asked me if I\nhad money to travel to Greece. I -- I had no money, the -- the -- we did get paid in the\npartisans. And she opened her purse and gave me -- which I thought it was a large --\nrather a large denomination bills, or several of them, and told me that that would\nadequately cover a bus ticket. And all the -- she was on her way to the station to go, and I\n-- and I offered to -- to walk with her. She says no, thanks a lot, but -- but she -- I asked if\nwas news about my mother, but everybody wa -- were -- there were anxious moments,\nyou know, during all the hiding, and so forth, but they\u2019re all very well, and extremely\nanxious to see you, and so don\u2019t tarry. I have to -- to -- to let, I -- just a month before, in\nthe middle of the summer, I had caught a cold, and I was offered a leave o -- a medical\nleave absence, but at the time I was offered, where was I going to go? I didn\u2019t have\nrelatives in the middle of the mountains. But I had asked the doctor if he could ge -- keep\nit for me. And so after I saw Mrs. Stassnopoulos, Popi, then I remembered this promise,\nso I went to him, and I said, \u201cIs this still valid?\u201d Sure. So immediately he signed the three\nweek medical leave, which I then presented to the adjutant. He said it was fine with him.\nHe says, \u201cWhen do you want to leave?\u201d I said, \u201cAs soon as I can.\u201d So I went to the bus\nstation, and I booked a s -- a seat on the bus on a Sunday, which was November, I think\nNovember 19. And that was the end of my stay with the partisans.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure I dreamt, but I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It\u2019s a Sunday.",
        "A: That\u2019s important, I\u2019ll tell you why.",
        "A: But unlike when I came up from Athens, this time it was a regular bus, so it could make\ngood time, and we arrived in Athens in -- around three or four o\u2019clock in the afternoon.\nNow Athens pre-war, as well as post war, I mean, I think all cities on Sunday, they are so\nquiet, it -- it -- it sounds almost de-deserted, especially in the commercial. So I -- so we\nend up in the bus station, and I got out of the bus, and I call on the telephone. Now\nactually, in my house we didn\u2019t have a telephone, we share it with the people upstairs, the\nShabetais, and so I think Mrs. Shabetai answered, and I said I just arrived, she says, \u201cAll\nright, come on, come on.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to take a -- a taxi.\u201d So I got ona\ntaxi, and eventually f -- it wasn\u2019t really -- 1t was Omonia, that square I mentioned to you\nearlier, where people will sit on the grates during the war. It\u2019s a 10 minute ride at most.\nAnd we got to the front of the house, but there\u2019s no one there. I thought that by -- by then,\nby the time I made the telephone call, I would find my younger brothers there, eager to --\nto see me arrive, there\u2019s no one. And so I opened the main en -- entrance door, and I go\nup the stairs to the third floor, where our -- our apartment was, and I knocked on the\nfloor, and the door opens, and who do I see? Popi. Mrs. Stassnopoulos. She is the woman\nthat had come to Larisa to talk with me. And she went like this, go upstairs. I mean, I\u2019m\ntoo dumbfounded to even ask her why. So I trudge another -- another floor, and I knock\non the door, and Mrs. Shabetai opened the door, and she embraced me, and she takes me\nby the hand into their living room, and there\u2019s my father. And I still remember him,\nbecause that -- it was a -- a kind of a thing that he wore in winter, a flannel robe. And\nhe\u2019s sitting in a kind of deck chair, because he -- he liked that kind of thing, with\narmrests. Well, I went in and embraced him, and he kissed me, and -- and I see he is\ncrying, and I say, \u201cWhere is mother, and where 1s -- where is Sam, and Meko?\u201d Well he -\n- | don\u2019t think he was in a state to -- to talk, but Mrs. Shabetai came again, and put her\narm around me, and Mr. Shabetai took hold of my arm and told me that things were --\nhad been terrible, you know, and the only thing is that they were caught somehow, but\nnobody knew now where they were. This is what I -- I found when I got there. I really\ncannot even remember the remaining of -- of the day. I\u2019m sure I must have something to\neat, because I hadn\u2019t eaten all day long. I don\u2019t know whether I ate it, when apparently I\nthen -- and we went downstairs to our apartment, but very quickly to not make a final tie\nwith Mr. and Mrs. Stassnopoulos, whom I met. When we\u2019re ab -- left our apartment, then\npeople who were looking for places, they -- and the Stassnopoulos found, or got ahold of\nour apartment, and they moved there, and at liberation, they could not be expelled. They\ndidn\u2019t even have a place to go, so for a -- they stayed in the same place, we shared the\napartment for a number of months. And relations were not really the best after a-awhile,\nit was difficult to do that. But essentially my father and I shared a room, and they shared\nthe other bedroom. You know -- and even I know that the following -- I don\u2019t know whi -\n- how I slept that night, how -- how I was able to sleep, I didn\u2019t know what to think. And\nI\u2019m sure I must have asked my father, but he -- he had no details as to exactly what had\nhappened, how they had been caught, or -- now, he knows, because other people had said\nthat -- that -- that they were taken to Haidari, and that from there nobody else then knew.\nActually, we know now -- I know now that my mother and my two brothers were put on\nthe last transport that left Greece, that -- and the reason that was being delayed was\nbecause they were waiting for the 2400 Jews of Rhodes, which again, you know, with the\nItalian armistice, they had the Germans occupied, and they had rounded up, and they\u2019re\nbringing them by boat. And they made the last transport in -- in -- in August. It\u2019s very\nhard, you know, sometimes when I think that the first time I began to learn and see that\nindeed the -- the Germans may be on the way out from Greece, it must have been July,\nmaybe, or maybe early August of \u201944. And to think that within a month they would be t --\nbeing transported literally, you know, along the railway line in front of me in Thessaly,\nwell, figuratively speaking -- well even harder than after another month or two, would\nhave been over. Well, it happened.",
        "A: Slowly.",
        "A: Slowly, yeah, he -- you know, I -- I -- I cannot -- now, and then, but of course more now,\nhaving children myself, I -- I began to feel, you know, that as soon as he emerged from\nhiding, he finds that he has no wife, and -- or children. He doesn\u2019t know where I am, or\nwhere the rest of the family are, and -- and he has no answers, you know, nobody can --\ncan tell him. I mean, in the case of my mother and my brothers, he has surmised that\nsomething horrible happened. At least I had told him I was going to go up the mountain,\nbut whether I\u2019m alive or not, he had no idea until the Shabetais return, which was not\nuntil, you know, two or three weeks later. And only slowly he began to -- to tell me how\nit was. I\u2019m -- in fact I remember he told me that around September, he finally, in the last\nplace where he was hiding in one of the suburbs of Athens, he got up, and he knew it was\nYom Kippur, and he begun to pray. And out of the window, he saw another man in the --\nin the yard in the adjacent house, who was also praying. And that\u2019s when he realized it\nmust be another Jew, and 1-it wasn\u2019t in yet the liberation, not freedom yet, and when they\ngot liberated, they -- they -- and he did -- he was another Jew. So, I mean for my father, s\n-- being immobilized, first of all because of his -- of his leg, but even because of hiding,\nyou know, when -- even people who were fully functional were -- couldn\u2019t roam around\nthe streets, you know, from fear of being seen by somebody, denounced, there were many\nof -- of this kind of people, in fact, you know, my family, as I know from my brother,\nwere found by Rekanati, who was a -- a Jew, a Salonika Jew who worked for the\nGermans, and well, he was, you know, shot. And so we were trying to pick up life again,\nout of the -- but no sooner are we doing that that the troubles start. And at one point,\nbecause I didn\u2019t know what to do, I thought that I want to rejoin my unit, and my father\nwent into hysterics, literal hysterics, which I thought a little bit ludicrous for a man of his\nage. But now I can understand. I mean, he is the only son that\u2019s left to him, and he\u2019s now\ntalking about going and rejoining the unit, you know. And it -- well, it wasn\u2019t so much his\nshouting that kept me there, but the doctor who gave me the leave, turn out to be staying\nat the apartment across the street from us. So I went and I -- I said to him, \u201cWhat shall I\ndo?\u201d He said, \u201cDon\u2019t go anyplace. Stay here.\u201d Yeah. And that\u2019s what I did.",

        "A: Right. May I fo -- spend a couple of minutes --",
        "A: -- to mention what happened to me after, in December of \u201944, when finally the problem --\nthe political fighting was over. Our neighbor, who w -- was liberated by German -- I\nmean -- German -- British -- British troops, and Greek police. And, I mean everything\nhad been closed, there would have been -- had been no food, other than what one had,\nyou know, kept in before the trouble started. So the following day, I went and stood in\nline at the grocery store two blocks from our apartment, waiting to get whatever, you\nknow, was -- was available. And five minutes later, after I started s-standing in line, a\nnumber of police officers, gendarmerie come, and they\u2019re going down the line, who is\nIsaac Nehama? So, me. Well they take me, and first they took me to the apartment, and I\nsaw my father, there were other policemen and gendarme around, some of them in\ncivilian clothes, some of them in uniform. And my father is really half hysterical, half --\nnot hysterical, I mean vocally, but frightened, but at the some time, also resolute, because\nthey are doing searches, and so forth, and he had a few gold sovereigns left on his person,\nand they found it. He -- at -- for a moment he thought that they were going to grab it\naway, and there was the only thing that we had left to our name, so he started shouting,\nand screaming, and so forth. Well they -- they didn\u2019t take the money, but they took me\naway, they took me to the police station and they began to pummel me with the butt of\nthe rifles, because they wanted me to reveal names of EAM/ELAS people in the\nneighborhood. I told them I hadn\u2019t been in the neighborhood for over a year. I was not a\npart of that before I left. Yes, I was in ELAS, but I went to survive, not to -- for political\nreasons, and certainly I did not know anyone in the neighborhood of that. Well, I was\nbeaten for -- for quite a time, but at the end I was put in a -- in a car, and taken to the\nplace which ironically, in the center of Athens, was the place where the Gestapo used to\nround up their prisoners in the basement. It was a -- an office building, had the basement,\nor the base for a garage. And by the time I got there, it was dark, and I was -- a door\nopened, and I was shoved, almost total darkness, except you could feel the smell and the\nnoise of lots of other people. In short, they had been rounding up people, and the\nfollowing day they put us in trucks, they took us to a -- ac -- a mini camp, a detention\ncamp with barbed wire, near the shore, Glifada, which is a suburb of Athens, a s --\nbeautiful spa. And I -- I was kept there for a -- a day and a half, and then we were taken,\nand put on to Pireas on ships. We didn\u2019t know where we were going, and after a traverse\nof I think three or four days and nights, then also it happens in darkness we will\ndisembark. And we found ourselves in -- in the middle of a desert, at least it looked like a\ndesert. Now subsequently I learned it was Lugia. Well, what had happened, the British\nthen had taken all these things as prisoners, because the people of ELAS had taken some\nBritish soldiers as -- as prisoners, so it was kept as a kind of bargaining chip. Well,\nfortunately, in the meantime, my father, through frantic efforts, and a cousin of his, knew\nthe Europe Times correspondent in Athens, who knew Damaskinos, the archbishop, who\nhad become regent by that time, and told him about the fate of this Jewish boy who goes\nto save himself, loses most of his family, and -- and now he\u2019s a -- a prisoner of the\nBritish. Because two days after I arrived in Lugia, then once a day some British soldier\nwill come with a clipboard and mention names. And somebody said to me, \u201cYour name\nhas been called.\u201d So effectively, the word had come down, and I was repatriated. So I\nthink this needs to -- to have a nice book end for my partisan --",
        "A: F-F-For a -- from the time that I was picked up, till the time I returned was, I think, 15\ndays. And I came back, I think, the seventh or eighth of January of \u201945.",
        "A: I think you were asking me earlier about when Sam returned.",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "A: Yes, by supposedly our allies.",
        "A: Well, look I can understand they -- they -- you know, they -- what they were trying to do,\nI -- I wasn\u2019t beaten by the British themselves, I was beaten by the Greek gendarmerie,\nwho were, of course, doing the beating of -- of the -- I think the British, wa -- once I got\nto the detention place in Athens itself, and to [indecipherable], once we came under\nEnglish army control, people not beaten. If anything else we were well treated. I mean,\nfood was there plentiful. In Libya one day, a man came, an English, with a English\nuniform, and I saw in his shoulder a patch that said Palestine. I took a chance, and I\naddressed him in Hebrew, the only phrase that I -- I knew, do you speak Hebrew? And he\nsays, \u201cAre you,\u201d -- I didn\u2019t know how to -- I didn\u2019t know any more Hebrew other than\nthat, but I told him my name. Then he said, \u201cOkay, come in the evening.\u201d Then in the\nevening he brought me a couple of bars of chocolate. Tha -- of course, it wasn\u2019t really in\nhis power to let me out. But I was let out in a few days anyhow.",
        "A: I mean, I don\u2019t know if they did it on purpose, they really pummeled me in the upper\nbody and the legs.",
        "A: Yes, and at -- at one point, the man had this -- th -- even a bayonet fixed, and he went like\nthis, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m sure that -- and because I think he -- it pierced my overcoat, that famous\nblue overcoat, which I mentioned to you, I had -- I had still saved it from the partisan\ndays, and had rit -- brought -- brought back, but it was just a -- a -- a -- a savage beating.",
        "A: Of course, I -- well, first of all, I was -- I was really, for one thing, taken aback that -- that\nsuch savagery was possible, and especially for something that w -- I had not done, or for -\n- I could not fulfill a request which in good consc -- I wasn\u2019t hiding anything. It wasn\u2019t as\nif they were asking me the name of my unit, or where are they? I would have told them.\nThere was nothing s-secret about that. But they -- they were -- and I can see that this was\nnot done at the request of the British, but it was simply on their own initiative. It was that\nhorrible thing. Greece, unfortunately, is the only country where the resistance, which in\nspite of all of this horrible political infighting, at least did something to shore up the\nmorale of the people, inflict losses on the Germans and the Italian. It was never officially\nrecognized until about 10 years ago, when finally Papandreaou, the minister who was\nnow the prime minister is dead, rammed a law through one of the two Houses of\nParliament. He didn\u2019t even clear both of them. And this is the tragedy, the pity of Greek\npolitical life and affairs, that even after 50 or more years, they are not even willing to say\nbygones be bygones, at least recognize a contribution that was made, of substantial\ndimensions.",
        "A: All right. Well, I then resumed my life in the sense that I began to prepare myself. Now\nit\u2019s beginning of the year of \u201945, for taking the entrance examinations at the Polytechnic\nInstitute in -- in sep --",
        "A: In September, right. But it means preparation. Well, of course the war -- war is still\nraging in Europe, I mean, still going on, and finally it ends at the end of April of \u201945, and\nsoon thereafter, the stories first trickle, then becomes a torrent, both in the newspaper\nstories, as well as the newsreels, to see the emaciated, things in extermination camps, the\ncrematoria, the piles of corpses, and all this horror. Well, what can one do but, you know,\nwithout any trace of where our loved ones are. And it was not until I think beginning of\nAugust, of \u201945, that first on the radio -- at the time of news, they didn\u2019t have the things as\nbulletins, at the time of news, it would be an extended time that they took to recite names,\nbecause as news be-began to trickle down, and come down from Europe of prisoners\nfrom the -- the concentration camps, some -- 1n some cases the Greeks themselves,\npolitical prisoners who were in Dachau, then there was also news from contingents of\nGreeks that had gone, some of them forcibly, some of them voluntarily, to work in\nGerman factories. But they got, of course also co -- caught by the fighting of the war.\nSome of them never returned, and so they also had to be listed. And then one day in the\nbeginning of August of \u201945, a neighbor called me and told me that she heard my brother\u2019s\nname mentioned. But because I -- I didn\u2019t wa -- I didn\u2019t know whether she had heard\ncorrectly, whether she made a mistake, whether the -- the possibility of there being\nanother person of the same name. I didn\u2019t tell my father, and I immediately came down, it\nwas very early in the morning, and I ran to the offices -- the nearest office of the\nnewspaper. I went to the -- and I -- and I told them what I wanted, and they had the list\nthat it was going to appear in the afternoon paper, and then I saw Sam Nehama, comma,\nAthens. So I was confident enough because I knew that they -- we are the only Nehamas\nin -- in Athens, so I then brought this thing with me, and show it to my father. And now\nof course, there is no way, I mean, I asked at the newspaper office how can one get in\ntouch, because usually this information came via UNRRA, who was the relief\norganization that shepherded all these DPs, in the displaced persons camps. But there was\nnothing tangible, but while we are fretting, I mean, when we gonna hear, and when is he\ngonna come, the following day he called on the phone. Now, on the phone he told us that\nhe was in Bari. So, I thought meant that he was going to take the -- the ferry, which takes\nabout a day to get to Corling. And then -- so we thought that it was going to be a few\ndays more. And then, about half an hour later, the phone rang again, I remember it was at\nthe neighbors, and I had to run upstairs, and it was Sam again, he says, \u201cI -- I -- I called\nyou from Corling. I didn\u2019t want to break the news so suddenly upon you that I\u2019m here,\nI\u2019m not in Bari, I\u2019m already in Greek territory, I\u2019m in Kolif, which is an hour and a half.\nSo, I told my father, Sam is here, he couldn\u2019t believe it, of course he couldn\u2019t come -- I --\nand ran to the railr -- railroad station. He came off, you know, was whole hundreds,\nliterally, of people retur -- returning from Germany, and Europe, and he had on short\ncorduroy, brown corduroy pants, in the manner of lederhosen, you know, which I\u2019m sure\nhe must have gotten in Germany from one agency or the other. And of -- of course, first\nof all the -- what impressed me was his size, it was -- he was a grown man, and -- and\ncertainly he was not thin, he looked rather -- very, very healthy and well fed. And --",
        "A: At -- at -- at the moment we are talking about our reunion --",
        "A: Okay, he was 15 years old.",
        "A: No, no, he\u2019s -- he still, you know, has a youthful face.",
        "A: But he has the stature of a grown man, he was not the little, short boy that I had left\nbefore. And let alone that in my mind\u2019s eye, having seen the newsreels, and read the\nstories, and when I knew that he was also liberated, you know, I thought I was going to\nsee a broken individual, not -- if not ema-emaciated, or a s -- a skeleton with skin, but\ncertainly even with premature gray hair. Fortunately none of that had touched Sam,\nwhich I\u2019m very, very happy for him. I think in contrast, I think I had been much more\naffected by the -- the war, though I did not see the -- the horrors that he did, but by the\nseparation, because I was at an -- at an age where I could begin to -- to think about things\nlike this, and in -- in -- internalize them.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Originally, when I was told that you were interested in interviewing me, I told Sharon\nMueller that I have nothing to say, compared to what Sam went through. But Sharon is a\nwise lady, and she said, \u201cThe invitation is not proportional to the travail that one has\nundergone, with what one has to say.\u201d So that persuaded me to come and -- and talk with\nyou. But I always think that the -- compared to what he saw, and what he went through,\nmine really paled [indecipherable] insignificance, except that things that -- the way they\naffected me.",
        "A: I would -- perhaps I would have felt -- and I\u2019ve had the same kind of -- of -- even if I was\nin hiding, because I was at a -- you know, even two or three years made a difference, and\nmaybe my own inclination [indecipherable] was to -- to think about these things, and I\nthought a lot about them. And the -- the -- the pain of not finding them, seeing them in\nnewsreels what had gone on, and seeing the enormity of these things, all of those things\nthen combined to very quickly l-leave, at least in me, what I perceive -- I cannot\nobviously speak for Sam and what is deep in his mind, but I had a -- a much more -- I felt\nit, I think more than he did. That\u2019s -- I -- I think that I did, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m not sure that that\u2019s\ntrue, objectively.",
        "A: Yes, although in both cases, there was always the question of survival.",
        "A: But can you imagine me -- when -- when he retells in his tape the Death March from\nAuschwitz to only a rail head, which is less than 50 kilometers away, and it took three\ndays, and no sleep, and you don\u2019t dare fall by the wayside, because you\u2019re gonna be shot.\nI think a minute of that is more than the entire year of what I went through.",
        "A: Or -- no, no, I -- I didn\u2019t -- no. I knew that my f-father was waiting and anxious. I\nwouldn\u2019t have dare take Sam and say let\u2019s go and have a chat. So no, we went. But even\nin the subsequent days, because I did not know, number one, seeing the horrors in the\nnewsreel, and not knowing yet to -- ho -- how much they had affected him. Now,\noutwardly he\u2019s -- he\u2019s j -- fine, but I wanted to be careful, so I -- I -- I did not broach\nthings like this. And really, even things like -- when did you arrive in Auschwitz. Even I\nasked him a few years ago, because then I wanted to find the exact date. He said, \u201cI can\ngive it to you within four or five days.\u201d Well, I went to the Holocaust Museum, I went to\nthe library, found the famous Auschwitz Chronicles of Danuta, and what do I see? 17\" of\nAugust, an entry that a contingent is expected tomorrow of 20 odd thou -- thousand and t-\ntwenty -- 2100 Jews from Rhodes. It was a mistake, they didn\u2019t put the Athenians. And\nthen it says, me -- X number of males were given numbers, starting from B something to\nB -- and I know Sam\u2019s na -- number is B7464. So he was right smack in the middle of\nthat range, so I know now the day they got to Auschwitz. Now, I asked Sam what time of\nday, and he told me it was still dawn, almost, just before dawn. Because I\u2019ve tried to\nthink when did my mother and father -- and my -- my mother and brother die. Nobody\nknows, but from Sam I know it was either the same day, or the latest the following day.\nThey didn\u2019t keep them. They had no place to -- to -- they had to dispose of them. So at\nleast I -- I can -- I have narrowed the day of my mother\u2019s and brother\u2019s deaths.",
        "A: First of all, I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t know whether he was coming back, given his age, and --\nand -- and -- and seeing that at the time of the arrival, the very young, the very old, or\nwomen with very young, regardless of their own ability to work or not, the freakle finger\ndeter -- I mean, who do you expe -- how do you expect that -- wha -- what expectation do\nyou have that a 14 year boy will appear capable of concentration camp labor? So, I mean,\nonly the darkest thoughts exist, and it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a miracle that -- that I think this arrived,\nbecause he was bigger for his stature for his age, plus that thing that he did in the Greek\nconcentration camp, I think is responsible for his not being chosen to go the other\ndirection.",
        "A: Yeah, well, Sam is very good about that, he says well, first of all he had to go undergo\nquarantine that lasted for several weeks. Wa -- there was very little to be done. Then, he\nwas taken and to -- there was a neighboring camp, actually a farm, and it was about 10\nkilometers from the main Birkenau camp, called Budi, which was a -- a farm, more a\nfarm complex. And that young kids were doing far-farm work, picking things up, and\nthings like that. And that\u2019s from where he -- he eventually had to do the -- the march, and\nget to Buchenwald, and -- and I think the interrogator asked them what he did in\nBuchenwald, with [indecipherable] did, he says, \u201cNothing.\u201d Because in Buchenwald was\nnot that kind of a camp, it was not a -- a labor camp.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: I -- I -- I can see the scene, and he is crying, well, but I think both he and I, without even\ndiscussing it, we -- we took it easy, we didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t ply Sam with lots of questions\nright in the beginning. And in fact, some of the details which I -- he relates on the tape, in\nparticular the -- the beating that they received at the hands of the German police, I only\nheard it for the first time myself on the tape. So I -- because w -- we did not know what\neffect this kind of questioning would have on him, it certainly would open up wounds\nthat perhaps ought to be left to heal for a bit. So we were very, very careful. Course, you\nknow, unfortunately, I -- I don\u2019t know, y-y -- you realize tha-that -- that although you\nwant to know, you\u2019re -- you\u2019re hungry for that, but it isn\u2019t gonna change the outcome. So,\nwaiting a little bit longer, I -- I -- I don\u2019t want to say that we -- we didn\u2019t want to know.\nWhat I think was much more [indecipherable] was we wanted to tread very carefully,\nbecause we did not know what this might do to s -- to -- to Sam. In the same way I think\nthat even my father did not ply me with very pressing questions continuously about my\nexperiences in the camp. I mean, after I told him -- I mean in the ca -- in the -- 1n the -- in\nthe mountains. After I told him of -- of traversing the [indecipherable] and getting to\nKardhitsa, and then how finally I got there. But [indecipherable] from time to time I\nwould tell him a few things that happen in the mountains, but he didn\u2019t press. I think that\nif I had stayed longer, we would have exchanged stories. He would have told me things\nabout his own childhood, and I would have told him about my mountain experiences.\nEnd of Tape #9\nTape #10",
        "A: Yes, several times, but the --",
        "A: Two year?",
        "A: No, no, no, no. It was from September of \u201943, to October of \u201944, 13 month. The -- es-\nessentially the same period for me in the mountains. Two things. My father was, because\nof his leg, was not a mobile individual, therefore it is that he missed going out. Of course,\nbeing cooped up, he -- I think he changed altogether, three locations. He went with some\nfriends in the beginning, then just for security, and -- and before suspicions would a -- a -\n- a -- be a-aroused, he -- he -- he moved. I don\u2019t think he had, first of all, things to read,\nlike books or things like this. And I don\u2019t think my father read that much, as compared\nwith my mother, who was an avid reader. So he told me -- well, primarily of -- of A,\nthinking about the rest of us, counting the minutes and the hours and the anxiety that he\nfelt -- he -- he -- he spoke about that. And always, before my mother and brothers were\ncaught, he l-looked forward to seeing, occasionally, when they would come, my mother\nventured, I think once or twice, to come down. Very often I think was really Sam who\nplayed the intermediary, or my father would then use still some-somebody else to deliver\nmoney, or -- or news. So, I think that the picture that I have now of my father, and the\nconversation that I had with him was that he simply spent this 13 months in -- in a -- with\na mixture of despair, stoicism, hope. I -- he didn\u2019t express much more than that, and I\nknow, I cou -- I cou -- I could imagine how it must have been for him cooped up in -- in\nthose places.",
        "A: Mm, at the end of *45 --",
        "A: -- I took the entrance examinations, and I was accepted. But almost simultaneously, I was\ninformed -- because I did not know that until after 1t happened, that my father, all this\ntime after the liberation, even -- even before Sam returned, was working behind the\nscenes -- at least he did not tell me, that\u2019s what I mean by behind the scenes, to, through\nhis contacts in -- with the B\u2019nai Brith, to see what he could do to assure my education.\nAnd so finally things have progressed far enough, I guess from the other end, from the\nUnited States, that he had to tell me. And my first reaction was, I have to confess, a little\nbit negative because -- not so much the idea of going to the United States to study, but\nthat suddenly my future had been already prepared for me. When I was a child, to be an\nengineer is fine, and I grew to like it, but later on, you know, I -- I -- \u2019m now an adult, I\ncan -- I ca -- I have to decide for myself. But that only lasted for a few hours, or a few\ndays, and so I attended classes at the Polytechnic only for, essentially the first semester,\nbecause then everything -- I had to get to ready to come United States. Among other\nthings to get ready is getting the visas and passports, but even more than that was\ntransportation. Remember, it was still a year after the war, and we had to wait for the next\navailable ship with a opening that was traveling the United States, and that -- the first\nopening was in October of \u201946. And that\u2019s when I --",
        "A: All right.",
        "A: I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- you\u2019re -- you\u2019re -- you\u2019re -- you\u2019re -- you\u2019re kind, because I thought you\nwould continue, you would carry it one more step and say how did I dare then leave him?",
        "A: Well, there is no question my -- my father, I mean, he wa -- he used to tell me, I\nremember, even when I was already in high school, if I would ask him for some money to\ndo so something like, I don\u2019t know, go to a movie, or something -- or -- or go buy\nsomething, he would say to me, \u201cLook, I don\u2019t have the money to give you for that\npurpose. But if you were to ask me that you want to go buy a book, even if I don\u2019t have\nthe money, I will tell you what I will do. I will not smoke for a week to save from\nsmoking, so -- so -- anything that has to do with education, I, you know, I\u2019Il do, or that,\u201d -\n- so it\u2019s not surprising to me, and I -- and I know in some respects, because I learned\nthese things subsequently, my -- my f-father would say things that were not true, fibs,\nlies, but they were lies in -- for good purposes. But even before he worked this thing with\n-- through the B\u2019nai Brith for a scholarship for me to come to the United States, I know\nhe wrote a letter to Churchill saying -- which was a bit of an exaggeration, that he, at the\nrisk of his life had hidden a British soldier who had to go into hiding -- because a British\ncontingent had come to help the Greeks when we were fighting the Italians. And then, of\ncourse, in \u00b041. It was partly true. There was a man who was in the British army that\nhappened to be f -- his parents from Monastir. And he came to the synagogue, you know,\nfor Pessach. And so we invited him, and he joined us for [indecipherable]. That\u2019s what\nhappened, that\u2019s true. But he was not really hiding.",
        "A: And so -- so he -- he -- in other words, my father would do anything, even embellish the\ntruth, or stretch it, to assure that I had the proper education.",
        "A: Oh no, no, it wasn\u2019t that.",
        "A: No, no, no. No, that -- that -- that -- that -- on the other hand, getting into the United\nStates -- because for a long time, in a c -- in a certain ways my father was naive. When I\nwas growing up, I was going to be a textile engineer. Well why? I mean, dit -- what does\nhe know about textiles, other than some son of some business assoc -- associate had gone\nand studied textile engineering in Yaszh, in Belgium, which a-apparently had a well-\nknown textile engineering school. So I was being prepared fully for engineering, but also\nfor textile engineer. Of course I -- all of that got changed, you know, when I decided to\nbe an electrical engineer, and [indecipherable] textiles. But h -- he understood this much,\nthat opportunities in Europe, education opportunities, let alone the United States, which\nwas a mirage, you know, sort of not only far away physically, but so distant emotionally.\nSo he would do anything.",
        "A: Well, how I dare leave, first of all I was 1 -- after awhile inebriated by the thought that I\nwas going to go to the United States. Second, Sam had returned, so I knew my father was\nnot alone. Third, I was joined by a cousin, whose -- whose father was my father\u2019s cousin.\n[ -- I -- with a young man, Jeff Levi -- lev -- Levis was his name, we came together on the\nsame ship. He went to Iowa, I went to Illinois. We related from both sides, the maternal\nand the paternal side. So, and he was an only child. And therefore, I -- putting all these\nthings together, there were no limits to that what parents would not do to further -- after\nall, I was going to study. It didn\u2019t necessarily mean that I was going to go there forever. I\ncould have easily, in normal times, be sent to study in Manchester, which has another\ntextile engineering sch -- school. So there were -- th -- there were no thoughts -- now, if --\nif Sam had not returned, I can, as they say in Greek, I could put my hand on flames and\nswear that my father would have done the same thing, and he would have pushed me, and\nencouraged me, and really shoved me, because he -- he felt the -- the value of -- of\neducation. And I did it.",
        "A: No, I had --",
        "A: -- my -- an uncle --",
        "A: --anunclein anuncle in New York whom I saw when I -- when I landed.",
        "A: But that\u2019s it, I -- I then went to school in Illinois, and --",
        "A: No, but you see in engineering --",
        "A: -- you don\u2019t need very much, especially in the -- in the beginning, which is mathematics.\nI -- in fact, I knew more mathematics than -- than they taught in the first two or three\nyears in -- in ri -- in college, because in high school, especially the one that I went, which\n[ -- it was so intensive in mathematics and engineering. No, I had no English, but I\nlearned it.",
        "A: Of course -- well --",
        "A: In the be -- well, first of all I, again, in the first four years, I was busy learning and getting\nand education, trying to get a degree. Then the decision to go to graduate school was\nreally, of course, mine, primarily, but I began to get encouragement from professors that I\nhad in undergraduate school.",
        "A: And I was encouraged enough to -- to stay in, although I had no means of, you know,\nindependently, I was given a -- an assistanceship -- a research assistanceship, which\nwould pay the tuition, and 103 dollars a month, and that\u2019s all I had to live on, because my\nfather from time to time would send me in a letter, a five dollar bill, or a 10 dollar bill. So\nit was primarily the encouragement I got from -- from teachers that made me stay, and in\nfact I stayed another two years in Illinois.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: In Illinois also, yes.",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: Ah yes, finally I left Illinois, I began to work at Bell Telephone Laboratories, and within\na few months after starting work at Bell Labs, I was drafted.",
        "A: Because the draft was still on, and of course I would have had the choice of not going to\nthe army, s -- being an alien. But of course, I could never again stay in this country. We\nhaven\u2019t talked about the fact that -- that 1t was in \u201950, at one point I was to be expelled by\nthe Immigration and Naturalization Service, because I had essentially overstayed my\nstudent visa. It\u2019s another long story, but my professors intervened, and the long and the\nshort is that Senator Douglas introduced a private bill in congress, and I got to stay in the\nUnited States on a law named for me, for the relief of Isaac Nehama, signed by President\nEisenhower.",
        "A: Not too many people have laws made for --",
        "A: -- for them individually. And -- but coming back after Bell Labs, I was drafted. Of\ncourse, within six months after Europe, drafted in the army, you don\u2019t wait the five years,\nfor obvious reasons, the country asked you to go and -- and s -- maybe die for the\ncountry, they don\u2019t make you wait for citizenship, so I was naturalized in Colorado\nSprings, where I was stationed.",
        "A: In f -- between *53 and \u201955.",
        "A: I was never a Greek citizen. I was a Yugoslav citizen, but I didn\u2019t know Yugoslavia.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: During my s -- years in the army, a-after the -- a few months after arriving in Colorado\nSprings, I got a call from the Red Cross, my father had an accident, he -- really he fell.\nHe slipped, the cane slipped, and he fell, but because the left leg was always the weaker,\nhe fell with the weight of the body on the leg, and broke it. So I was given compassionate\nemergency leave, which in order to use it, I hitchhiked, and it took me three weeks to get\nthere. Hitchhiking means I will go for air base to air base, and ask if there is a plane\ngoing in that general direction. So I -- I got from Colorado Springs, eventually to Stuart\nAir Force base in Massachusetts, then in the Azores, Libya, Athens. And fortunately, then\nI presented myself to the military attach\u00e9 at the Greek embassy -- at the American\nembassy in Athens, and that\u2019s when he stamped my order and the 30 days counted from\nthe day of my arrival.",
        "A: Well, eventually it was over, and on the return it took two months to find -- ah but I --\nagain, I -- I got stuck in Washington for the first time, for three weeks there were no\nplanes going in the general direction of Colorado Springs.",
        "A: Which years? The -- the -- the partisan years, the --",
        "A: The -- the -- the context 1s that t -- two aspects about it. One, that it\u2019s definitely it was as\n-- extremely significant period in my life, and I think to a large extent, a considerable\nextent, also forming. You know, it was the kind of a maybe -- I don\u2019t want to use the\nword crucible.",
        "A: But -- right. The -- the second part, when I reflect, at times -- and it lasted for --\nfortunately for me, and I think for my family and all friends, a very short time, mainly --\nespecially when I first came United States, I was surprised, because many of my fellow\ncitizens were veterans, American veterans who had flown missions over Germany, and\nvery dangerous stuff. In fact, I arrived United States November \u201946, the day before mid-\nterm elections. And when I asked the question, are you voting tomorrow, first of all they\ndidn\u2019t know there were elections. Now, in European tradition, university students are\nalways at the forefront of political activity. So here are people, not only students, but you\nknow, veterans of a war. So for a bit I got so disoriented that there was no -- that -- that\nmy experiences really, you know, I was beaten into wonderful shape, and very quickly, I\nthink, after I began to think seriously about that time, how ludicrous the thought is,\nbecause I would have preferred a banal, normal childhood, with my mother and brothers\nand family than -- than being formed into a fine shape. No thank you very much. I would\nnot wish it, you know, on -- on anybody else.",
        "A: No, I'd like to thank you, almost in the same -- for the same reasons that Sam says the\nsame thing to his own interviewer, because the other reason, other than Sharon\u2019s very\nwise statement persuading me to do that, is that 1t leaves something for either my\ndescendents, number one, as well as perhaps people in the future, who might be\ninterested about this particular period. And this I\u2019m saying now, following a year and a\nhalf of work as a volunteer for the Holocaust Museum and doing this thing for the Bitola\nJews, I have lived with, essentially almost 2000 faces of people who are all dead, and\nwho -- whose names then I had to type it into a database, and who become alive, and then\nreading books, and talking about that. So, I want to thank you for then doing that, because\nit leaves something which might be of some small value or use to some interested\nhistorian, or -- or person in the future.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Right. Fade.\nEnd of Tape #10\nTape #11",
        "A: This is the house where I was born. It was built by a sculptor, a Greek sculptor in 1867,\nand the legend is that the two kariatids, the two women, the statues, were in honor of two\nbeautiful sisters who lived a block away from there.",
        "A: This photograph was taken in \u201979, I was on a visit to Athens with a son, and my sister-in-\nlaw came with me, and she took the photograph.",
        "A: It\u2019s the same, but this is taken from a book of photographs by the famous French\nphotographer Krastier Brason. It attracted him aesthetically, artistically, and he took quite\na few photographs of that house.",

        "A: This is the same place, restored. For more than 20 years there were articles in the press,\ndecrying that poor shape in which this classic, or example of classic Greek architecture\nwas left. So there was enough of -- of pressure on the authorities to do something, so eve\n-- effec -- eventually, with some contribution from the ur -- European community, the\nplace was restored, and this is what it looks like now. And this -- this happened, in fact,\nthe facade was revealed early this year.",
        "A: This is the apartment where I lived when I grew up, with my family, most of my life. It\nwas in a -- the third floor of a -- an apartment house. The address was Asomatin 11, and\nthe reason that also this particular place was restored because it is an example, perhaps\nthe first example of a multi-storied edifice in Athens.",
        "A: That\u2019s the apartment restored.",
        "A: I have no idea, because I know this much, that it\u2019s not inhabited by renters, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s not\nan apartment house any more, it\u2019s offices. Some of them governmental, some of them an\nassociation. So perhaps for that reason there\u2019s a -- a flag.",
        "A: This is the view from the house where I grew up, from the roof, or really -- it was really\nnot a roof, you went up a stairway in the back. It was like a -- a terrace, where we would\nsometimes have picnics there, or sleep in the summer months. But if I looked towards the\nsoutheast, this is what I would see, the Acropolis.",
        "A: This is my mother, Sarah, her maiden name Kolonomos. It\u2019s the only photograph that 1s\nleft to us that you can see full face, but actually it was a -- a passport picture, and the only\nsurviving thing. We have other photographs which have her with my brothers, but this is\nthe only full faced photograph.",

        "A: Yes.",
