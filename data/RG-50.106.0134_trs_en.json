        "Question: -- Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Martin Weiss,\nconducted by Margaret Garrett on August 26, 2000, in Bethesda, Maryland. This interview is\npart of the museum\u2019s project to interview Holocaust survivors and witnesses who are also\nvolunteers with the museum. This is the follow-up interview that will focus on Mr. Weiss\u2019s post-\nHolocaust experiences. In preparation for this interview, I listened to the entire interview you\nrecorded at the Simon Wiesenthal Center on July 28, 1994. I also listened to the first part of the\ninterview you recorded with the Shoah Foundation on September 28, 1998. I will not ask you to\nrepeat everything you said in that -- in -- in those interviews. Instead, I will use this interview as\nan opportunity to follow up on that interview and focus on your post-Holocaust experiences.\nThis is tape number one, side A. What is your name?",
        "Answer: My name is Martin Weiss. I was born in Polana, Ch -- Czechoslovakia on January 28\"\n1929.",
        "Q: And what was your name at birth?",
        "A: At birth it was Meyer Weiss.",
        "Q: In the previous tape that I listened to, you told in quite a bit of detail your experiences up until\nyou were living with your sister in Europe. Could you give her name and where you were living\nat that time?",
        "A: Yes, I lived with my sister, for -- in 1945, we lived in Karlovy Vary, which is in the Czech\nRepublic. And I lived with my sister, she had gotten married at that time to Fred Morris. So,\nactually we lived together til we came to the United States, which was, I believe July of \u201946.",
        "Q: And how did you and your sister decide to come to the United States?",
        "A: Soon as the war was over -- and we lived in Karlovy Vary, my brother-in-law was a\n[indecipherable] of -- in the Czechoslovakia legion in the Czech army at the time. So he --",
        "Q: Your -- your brother?",
        "A: My brother-in-law.",
        "Q: Oh, your brother-in-law.",
        "A: Fred Morris. He was a -- a -- an itch -- and he came back after the war with the Czech army\nfrom Russia. So he lived under the -- on the Soviet -- I mean, he was in the Soviet Union for part\nof the war. And he knew that we should not let us stay there because the Soviet Union will have\nstrong influence. So when they had the first elections and the communists won, we saw that the\nsecret police or so was getting very strong. We decided that we di -- immediately to get papers as\nsoon as possible and leave the country. So my brother-in-law had a brother in United States, so\nhe got an affidavit from him and my sister and myself got an affidavit from my distant cousin,\nwhich my sister acquired, and [indecipherable] his name was Sam Fuchs, and he sent us an\naffidavit to come to the United States. And my brother-in-law was capable enough that he got the\npapers moving very fast and we were fortunate we left rather early, one of the first people to\nleave that part of -- of Europe at the time. And on the way here we went through Sweden.",
        "Q: So is this by train?",
        "A: No, we went by bus to Denmark and from Denmark we went by a -- a ferry or a boat to\nSweden, and we took the ship from -- I believe it was Stockholm to -- to the United States.",
        "Q: Did you have --",
        "A: The ship\u2019s name by the way was the [indecipherable |",
        "Q: Did you have funds to buy your -- your passage?",
        "A: Well, y-yes, oddly enough we did. In the short time that we were -- spent in that -- in\nCzechoslovakia -- because my brother-in-law was a veteran, so they -- the Czechs were taking\naway business from the Germans and giving it to veterans. So he was one of those people, he got\na business from a German auto parts store and we -- also, when we left he sold -- he sold the\nstore of -- the fa -- in fact [indecipherable] the store to another fellow, and the other fellow had\nrelatives in the United States, he was able to get some money, so I remember we got something\nlike 1300 dollars, or maybe 2000 dollars and that covered our fare to the United States. So\nactually we paid af -- for own fare on the way here.",
        "Q: And was it just the three of you --",
        "A: A-Actually it was five of us. It was my brother-in-law, my sister and myself, and his brother\nand his wife. So th-there was five of us that came simultaneously.",
        "Q: And you came to New York?",
        "A: And we came to New York, and --",
        "Q: How was the crossing?",
        "A: The crossing was, you know, pretty good, although we got seasick, but oth-otherwise, you\nknow, we were -- it was a nice crossing, it was a -- a civilian ship, so it was good enough, as far\nas that goes. And we came to New York, and like I said, my brother-in-law has his brother here,\nand --",
        "Q: In New York?",
        "A: In New York, he lived in New York, and his -- and I had my sister, so immediately -- my\nsister lived in the Bronx at the time, so we spent about two, three weeks with her in the Bronx,\nbut after that I go -- she got me a job.",
        "Q: Now, is this another sister [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, the same sister. No, the sister that was here in the United States. See, I had a sister here in\nthe u -- in the -- in the Bronx.",
        "Q: And what was her name?",
        "A: Her -- oh, pardon me, her name was Ellen.",
        "Q: Ellen.",
        "A: Ellen, and --",
        "Q: And she was already [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh, she was the one that sent us the papers. I\u2019m sorry, thought I mentioned that. She is the\none sent us -- got the papers from Mr. Fuchs, the affidavit, I should say. She got us the affidavit\nand she send us the -- the -- the affidavit so that we can co -- we could come out.",
        "Q: Okay. And so she was living in the Bronx.",
        "A: Right, so she was living in the Bronx, and --",
        "Q: I don\u2019t understand, Mr. Fuchs --",
        "A: Mr. Fuchs was a distant cousin, as -- and he is the one --",
        "Q: And why did he get the affidavit [indecipherable] sister?",
        "A: Well because in -- a-at that time, it wasn\u2019t like now, at that time, to come to the United States\nyou had to have an affidavit to guarantee that you will not be a -- you will not go on welfare or\nyou will not be a problem to the States, that you\u2019ll be s -- suf -- self supporting. So miss -- to --\nin order -- the affidavit covered that part, that you could not get the visa unless you had a -- a --\nyou had a guarantee that you will not be --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- a burden to the States.",
        "Q: So that was from your distant cousin?",
        "A: That\u2019s from my distant cousin.",
        "Q: And your sister, Ellen --",
        "A: My sister is the one that\u2019s --",
        "Q: -- arranged that.",
        "A: -- arranged that, right, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So we -- she\u2019s -- she actually borrowed an apartment because she lived in a smaller place, and\nwe lived there about three weeks. We got a --",
        "Q: She arranged the apartment.",
        "A: She arranged the apartment, right. And after that I -- my sister and my brother-in-law had a --\nanother -- a sister in California, so he went with my sister to California immediately.",
        "Q: Now, that was your sister in California?",
        "A: Yes, my youngest sister that came --",
        "Q: And what was her name?",
        "A: No, not my sister, was my brother-in-law\u2019s sister in California.",
        "Q: Oh okay, okay.",
        "A: And he wanted to settle in California, so they went straight to California. And I settled,\nbecause I got a job, which was in the time, I think, most crucial. I got -- my sister got me a job\nwith someone in Carteret, New Jersey. His name was Billy Lebow. And she later, by the way,\nmarried. And she got me a job with him in a grocery store. That was my first job and I was very\nanxious to work so I could be self supporting.",
        "Q: Did you speak English?",
        "A: No, I did not speak a word of English. Actually, I never even -- I was never exposed to\nEnglish. The only time I heard English is when we were liberated by the Americans, and we\nheard it, but it didn\u2019t mean anything because it was a short time and we just didn\u2019t understand it.",
        "Q: So you arrived in New York, your sister Ellen helped you --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- by getting a job in three weeks and you spoke no English.",
        "A: No, no. And I started working in the store. Naturally I --",
        "Q: And what was the store?",
        "A: The store was a grocery store, okay, a small grocery store and I started working there, but one\nthing I --",
        "Q: What -- what was your job in the grocery store?",
        "A: My job was -- was doing everything, I was cleaning up, helping the butchers, or helping clean\nup. Deliver groceries on a bicycle.",
        "Q: You had some experience with butchering?",
        "A: No, actually I didn\u2019t, because I was very young whe -- when I left home, but my father did\nhave a butcher shop. So I had knowledge --",
        "Q: Was it --",
        "A: -- 0-of -- of that type of business, but I really never did that type of work.",
        "Q: So, but it was familiar surroundings, you mean.",
        "A: Yeah, was familiar surroundings, right.",
        "Q: And did your boss speak any of your languages?",
        "A: Yeah, my -- my boss, it was Willy Lebow, he spoke Yiddish, of course, and -- because he was\nfrom Europe as well. And later on it just -- a-as it happens, he -- not much later, he married my\nsister, okay. So my sister also moved out to Carteret.",
        "Q: Well before -- before then, you spoke Yiddish.",
        "A: Yeah, I spoke Yiddish, yes.",
        "Q: And what other languages did you speak?",
        "A: I spoke Yiddish, I spoke Czech, Russian, Hungarian and of course I understood Polish, or a --\nI also spoke German, you know, and that helped a lot because a -- when a -- in that part of -- a\nlot of the -- in that town, I should say, there were a lot of ethnic eastern Europeans. So I more or\nless had a -- you know, had a way to get by with some of the customers, so that I -- although\nlanguage was a problem, but my broth -- this William Lebow instead of pe -- speaking to me\nYiddish, he spoke to me in English only. So consequently I was forced to pick up the language a\nlittle faster, because everybody spoke to me in English.",
        "Q: So did he do that deliberately to [indecipherable]",
        "A: Deliberately.",
        "Q: -- English.",
        "A: Yeah, deliberately instead of giving me a crutch, to depend on Yiddish, spoke to me in\nEnglish.",
        "Q: And where -- where did you live?",
        "A: Well, I lived -- I got -- I was very lucky, I found a room in a nice house, oddly enough. It was\na new -- fairly new house that this working c-couple had, and they had a son, he was also my\nage. And it was a little Cape Cod, but I was fortunate, I got a room with this family. I paid them,\nyou know, for the -- rooming there. And his son had -- their son had one room and I had another\nroom upstairs and it worked out very nice. The woman kept the place clean and all I did really\nthere is sleep, you know, when I would come home from work or whatever. And later on I -- as\nsoon as I -- my sister got married, I used to have all -- most of my meals at her house, but I\nwould live on my own, you know, in this -- so this worked out very good, it was a --",
        "Q: And did you go to any school to learn English --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- or may -- you just --",
        "A: Yes, I -- while I -- as soon as I got settled, I started working -- I st -- enrolled in night school\nimmediately. I was going for a number of years to night school.",
        "Q: Is this -- was it first to learn English?",
        "A: To learn English basically, right. To learn English, right. And then when I used up the school\nin this town, I went to a couple of towns away there was -- they had a larger high school, they\nhave a little more advanced teaching, so I went over there and got some more English basically,\nand some other subjects that were whatever I wanted. But it was also at night. It was all after\nwork.",
        "Q: Did you have any contact during your early period here with Jewish agencies?",
        "A: No, I did not. I -- oddly enough, I didn\u2019t have any contact with agencies, I didn\u2019t get any help\nfrom agencies. I didn\u2019t look for it, I didn\u2019t even know whether they existed in -- in some sense.\nBut I -- I was completely -- soon as I got here I was completely on my own, which is, by the\nway, this is the way I wanted it. I didn\u2019t want any charity, I didn't want anything from anybody.",
        "Q: What -- why was that?",
        "A: No particular reason, I just didn\u2019t think of looking f -- to someone else, you know. Basically\nthat\u2019s all 1 -- I think that\u2019s the way it was.",
        "Q: Okay, so here you are in -- working in Carteret and going to school at night and having meals\nat your sister\u2019s.",
        "A: Right, and so now life took -- took on -- oh yes, in the beginning I did go back to New York\nlike on weekends, like on Sundays, because that\u2019s -- was the only day I was off and meet some\nother friends that I got to know, I knew a little, slightly. And we used to meet on Sunday and go\nout for dinner or to a movie, whatever. And -- but after --",
        "Q: How -- how did you get to know them?",
        "A: Well, some of them I knew -- I don\u2019t know, through the grapevine or you know, you know a\ncouple of people, then you would meet another two, three people and so on. So there was like\nfive, six of us that would meet periodically, and --",
        "Q: Were a-any of them people that you had known in Europe?",
        "A: A couple of them were -- I had known in Europe, but some of them I did not --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- I met here. And we were -- and the reason being is that -- oh yes, and there was still, on the\neast side there was some kind of a -- from one of the families there was a -- they had like a\norganization, they would meet once a month or something. So I went a couple of times there, and\nso on. And what [indecipherable] really was, that because you didn\u2019t know anyone, you didn't\nknow the language, so you could have [indecipherable] together. But after a very short time,\nmaybe like three months, four months, I somehow decided that that was not for me and that I\u2019m\ngoing to try and make fre -- American friends that are local so that I don\u2019t have to go to New\nYork. So I started more or less -- and I met a couple of Jewish boys in Carteret, New Jersey, and\nwe sort of became a little friendly and I went along whether it was to the beach or for pizza. And\nso slowly, slowly I started getting -- and with American kids saw that I\u2019m European. So I\nliterally -- some [indecipherable] I cut myself off entirely. Not by design, it just to happened that\nit -- it worked that way, you know. And of course I worked a lot. I de -- delivered groceries, big,\nbig boxes on this bicycle, it had one si -- a big basket and a small wheel in the front, and all th-\nth-the groceries are in big, big boxes. I was -- and I was only like 16 on -- going on 17 really,\nand I was pretty light. So the box were sometimes heavier than I was on the bicycle. But anyway,\nI did this for quite awhile, til I started driving. I was able to drive, you know, a van, which was\nlike a year, a year and a half later. And I worked, like I mentioned a lot of hours. We worked\nbetween 60 to 90 hours a week. Like I worked six days a week from seven to six and I -- two\ndays a week til nine o\u2019clock. And during the night we would go twice a week to the market to\npick up vegetables. So it was like between eight oc -- eight p.m. to maybe we\u2019 ll get back two,\nthree a.m., and the next morning we start all over again. So it was qu-quite hectic and I worked\nlike this for a number of years. And --",
        "Q: Thi -- this reminds me of what you said earlier, as a child you worked for your family --",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "Q: -- then you went to Hebrew school, then you went to regular school, then you went back to\nHebrew school --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- then you worked again for your family. It sounds like a --",
        "A: Yeah, we worked all the time.",
        "Q: -- similar kind of schedule.",
        "A: Well, th-this was sort of different because a-a-at home in Europe it was different because it\nwas home. It was a relaxed -- 1-1t -- I d -- I don\u2019t know about relaxed, but it was -- it was a\ndifferent -- the confines were different. Here it was strictly a job working, and it was frustrating\nbecause I didn\u2019t speak the language, and plus the hours were allow -- they didn\u2019t allow you too\nmuch time for anything else, and I did a lot of what I would call really dirty work, okay?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Such as a -- because conditions --",
        "Q: With no future.",
        "A: -- condition -- right, conditions weren\u2019t much different than this today because today you go\nfor a job, an immigrant comes in, it\u2019s much, much different because they come in, the conditions\nare entirely different. In those days you came -- it wasn\u2019t even that somebody was doing\nsomething wrong -- like my brother-in-law wasn\u2019t necessarily a mean guy, he was a nice guy. He\nhimself worked hard. His mentality worked 1n that direction, so what I was doing was not out of\nthe ordinary for him, but it was out of the ordinary for me --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- because like such thing as collecting the dirty garbage with the stinking vegetables, even in\nEurope I would -- didn\u2019t do that, you know, so it was the kind of a thing for a young boy it was\nvery demeaning, if you will.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But I still [indecipherable]. But nevertheless, I was getting paid and I was supporting myself\nand I remember a f -- I did want to move to California originally, that was my plan, and because\nthe job I got sidetracked here. In California by the way [indecipherable] that time, jobs were\nunavailable. So my brother-in-law was there, but he couldn\u2019t get a job. So that reinforced my\nneed to stay here because I was supporting myself.",
        "Q: Why did you think that you wanted to go to California?",
        "A: Well, number one I wanted to live with that particular sister, near -- near her, although I had a\ngood relationship with this sister as well, and she was very selfless. But the other one was\nyounger, prob -- closer to my age I should say and we had more -- we grew up together so we\nhad more of a -- a rapport, or whatever.",
        "Q: This is not the sister you came over -- was this the sister that you came over --",
        "A: That\u2019s the same sister that I came over with.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I -- I -- yeah. And so we had a sort of very good relationship and I -- I would have felt more\ncomfortable.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Okay. And not that this sister was not good, but I mean she -- she was actually always\nworried about me and so on. So -- but she was older and she left and I was like, about nine years\nold, so just for that reason alone, but otherwise I had equally as good a relationship with Ellen as\nI did with the other one, with Cindy. But as I worked, one thing that I do recall that used to\nfrustrate me, I wanted to go to school and I couldn\u2019t afford to go to school because I couldn\u2019t\nquit working. So every so often I -- I would get sort of upset about it [indecipherable]|tape\nbreak]",
        "Q: You were talking about wanting to go to school.",
        "A: Oh yes, however, there were a couple of reasons I couldn\u2019t go to school. First of all I -- my\npreparation wasn\u2019t as good because I left school when I was pretty young, a-a-after\n[indecipherable] grade, but -- plus I didn\u2019t -- my English was still very poor and I had no\nconfidence in going to school. Plus I couldn\u2019t afford to take off from work. So I soon decided\nthat that was the only thing I could do is work and anyway I worked like this til about -- for my\nbrother-in-law [indecipherable] for about -- til 1952, when I was drafted into the armed services,\nduring the Korean war.",
        "Q: Now, had you become a citizen?",
        "A: No, oddly enough. I was supposed to but somehow they didn\u2019t -- my papers didn\u2019t come\nthrough. So I was drafted into the service without being a citizen. And it\u2019s a very funny thing, I\nserved the whole time in the service and I was not even a citizen, but a -- and being in the service\ndidn\u2019t help my citizenship because it took another while befo -- when I got out of the service, to\nfind out why I didn\u2019t get my citizenship. And of course they gave me some kind of limp excuse\nthat I -- they were investigating me and so on that if I had any communist affiliations. So I was\nlaughing because at 16 how could I have communist affiliations? Nevertheless I -- I did get my\ncitizenship right after that.",
        "Q: Be -- before that, what was your job in the service, where were you?",
        "A: In the service I was stationed in Fort Lee, Virginia, and oddly enough I was there for a whole\ntwo years. I was in the food service, and as a matter of fact, my job there was rather good. I had\nan aba -- first year I had different jobs. I was an -- I worked as a cook for a very short time and --\nand after that I went -- they send me to -- for a short time to a meat plant, to a -- where they were\nprocessing the meat for -- for the post. But I was there also, a very short time. Then I -- the most\nof the time I was in a -- assigned to the officers\u2019 club, which I had a very good assignment, I was\nthe buyer for the -- I used to buy the meat there, and -- for the club and issue it to the kitchen.\nAnd so tha --",
        "Q: Make what in the kitchen?",
        "A: I would issue the meat to the kitchen.",
        "Q: Oh, issue the meat.",
        "A: A-And the officers\u2019 club. I was a -- prepared it for them and so on. So I had a very nice ga --\nactually it was a very nice job, I was completely on my own and they liked the job I was doing\nso they wouldn\u2019t release me to go elsewhere. And as a matter of fact one time I had a run in one\nof the lieutenants there, so I was lucky enough, I was -- got myself an order to go to\n[indecipherable] headquarters in Paris, and he wouldn\u2019t release me, so I stayed there for the\nwhole time. But after that things were rather good. So I really had a very nice job. It was like\ngoing to a civilian job every day that I had my own car there and I lived there f -- I was there like\nfor a -- a whole two years. And on weekends I was able to go to Richmond, and I would go\nsometime to a -- a Jewish dance or something of -- different things like this. And we would --\nactually, was a very good -- a good two years, cause I got to be in the service.",
        "Q: How was it being a Jew in the service?",
        "A: I had no problem at all with that. I -- you know, I just -- see, I never emphasized or made a\nbig issue of being Jewish. I never had a problem [indecipherable] in Europe when I worked with\nother people, I -- I used to just act normal and I -- I never encountered any -- any prejudices or\nany problems with that. And in fact in the -- in the -- this particular section in the officers\u2019 club, I\nwas the only Jewish person there. Oh wait, there was another Jewish fellow there for awhile\nfrom Brooklyn, but he -- nobody liked him and eventually, you know, he left from there. But it\nwasn\u2019t because he was Jewish, he was just not exactly a nice guy. And so I really didn't -- didn\u2019t\nexperience any bad like -- you know, bad times because I was Jewish. And after that, in \u00b052, I --\nI had plans to move to California finally, just --",
        "Q: So you\u2019re out of the service now?",
        "A: In \u201954, I should say, I came out of the service.",
        "Q: And what was your rank when you left?",
        "A: I was corporal.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Oh, while I was in the service, too, they gave me a choice to go to a linguist school in\nMonterey, California, which --",
        "Q: Wha -- what school?",
        "A: A linguist.",
        "Q: Oh, linguist.",
        "A: A ling -- ling -- linguist school.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And -- but at that time, which I was really, I wanted to do, I even took the tests, let\u2019s see in\nRussian, Hungarian and Czech and they -- I passed them and they wanted to send me to -- more\nfor Russian, and I -- it sounded very tempting but they asked me -- they had -- I had to sign up\nfor an extra year of service, which with hindsight I made a big mistake not taking it because the\nextra year I would have been in school anyway, a whole year. And -- but alrea -- I was already at\nthe time 24 -- yeah, was 24 - 20 fi -- going on 25 and I figured an extra year would make me a\nyear older when I came out of the service, instead of 26 I would be 27 and I just made a choice\nnot to take it. And that was a mistake on my part because I could have gotten -- they gave you a\nfour year college credit course in one year, really what it was. So that was one of my mistakes.\nAnyway, I s -- when I got out of the service, I had decided that I\u2019m not going to help my brother-\nin-law in the store, I\u2019m not going to get tied up again, I\u2019m going to go straight to California,\nbecause I always wanted to move to California. And as it -- lo and behold, my brother-in-law\nwas short handed as usual in the business, and because I felt obligated with my sister and him, I\nstarted helping and before you know it, I s-stayed -- I stayed here and --",
        "Q: He wasn\u2019t able to find anybody else?",
        "A: No, he always had -- he -- he\u2019s operated a small business and he was not forward-looking\nenough that he would expand or get more help. So --",
        "Q: No, but instead of hiring you --",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: -- he couldn\u2019t hire somebody in your place to do what you did?",
        "A: Well, he felt I was more capable because by that time he took over another store from one of\nhis brothers and the store didn\u2019t do so good, so I -- he felt that I could build it up. So one thing\nled to another, before you know it, I ended up buying the store from him, because it --",
        "Q: Now, how did you get enough money to buy the store?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t, I was paying them off in small amounts and he was pretty generous -- not that the\nstore was worth much, because the store really was not producing enough income, but --",
        "Q: But -- but were you able to, when you took over the store, before you bought it --",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: -- were you able to improve it?",
        "A: Yes, I -- I -- what I did, I was very good at the time, I was rather capable of taking a store that\nwas run down and -- and built 1t up, more-so than a -- somebody else.",
        "Q: What did you do?",
        "A: Well, I sor -- I just hustled, you know, I still just --",
        "Q: So you worked harder than someone else would have.",
        "A: -- I worked harder and I merchandised, I tried to give good service and whatever. And so\nwhenever I ran the store, things were running smoother than if somebody else ran it. And -- and\neventually my brother-in-law saw -- he sort of talked -- not talked me into it, but he -- they told\nhim it will be a favor and they turned over the store to me, in a sense. And I was --",
        "Q: Were they doing you a favor --",
        "A: Not --",
        "Q: -- or were they getting rid of it?",
        "A: Well, they were -- they were getting rid of it but they were actually think -- it -- it\u2019s very hard\nto say because their mentality was geared in certain -- it\u2019s very hard to understand that. I would\nnot accuse them of not -- of doing it to get rid of it or to -- or -- or for ulterior motives, because\nthey really -- you know, my sister had the best interest for m -- for me. And my brother-in-law\ntoo was the -- he was not a shady guy, it was straight. And I think in their own mind they thought\nthey were doing me a favor, okay. But what was happening 1s that the store was just not a place\nthat you could build it up too much. I would improve it, but I would not get where I could make\na good living out of it. In the meantime -- oh yes, in \u201956 -- \u201957 I got married, and then I realized -\n- not then, I -- I realized before that I have to make a little more of a living, so I worked hard and\nI tried to make a living and I barely scraped a living out of it. It was not a moneymaking\nproposition. Well, while I was there, somehow or another I -- by that time I saved some money --\noh, in the meantime [indecipherable] the money that I got -- that I saved, even though I was\nmaking very little in the beginning, I saved money from a he -- you know, on a regular basis, but\nI had -- in 1947 we discovered I had a brother that was in a prison in Russia. We found out that\nhe was alive, so this was a -- th -- actually the Russians kept him two years after the war was\nover as a prisoner, and they accused him of being a German, so they kept him with the German\nprisoners. They didn\u2019t believe that he was Jewish. So when he came home, they found out he\nwas alive, so a lot of the money that I saved, I spend a lot of money on he -- oh, he made his way\nto Czechoslovakia, because I had another -- a brother living in Czechoslovakia as well, another\nbrother, Mandel. He lived in the Liberez and somehow when my brother came back from Russia,\nhe found a few Jewish people that were -- remained there alone. One man who -- where -- where\nmy brother lived in Czechoslovakia. Sorry. [tape break]",
        "Q: -- that your brother came back to Czechoslovakia.",
        "A: Right, so my brother [indecipherable] spent all those years in Russia. He came -- somehow he\nmade his way to Czechoslovakia, to Liberez, where my brother Mandel lived at the time. And\nnaturally, he didn\u2019t have anything, so -- I was so happy that he was alive that I was willing to\nshare everything that I had. In the meantime my brother Mandel\u2019s wife was also very sick, she\nhad some kind of bone disease. And at that time they just came out with streptomycin. And we\nlived -- actually Carteret was next to Rahway, New Jersey where Merck produced streptomycin.\nAnd you couldn\u2019t even get it on the market, but I got somebody to get me some streptomycin and\nsent it to my sister-in-law. And none of them had money over there, so I tried to help my brother,\nhelp my -- both of my brothers. So I sp -- really spent all of my savings. However, my wi -- I got\nmarried, I lived in an apartment for a short time, like a year, year and a half and I found out that\nit was not really good because we had trouble with the landlord. So I got mad, I figured I would\ndecide -- I decided to buy a house. And at that time ta -- buying a house was not as simple as --\nas it is today because most people couldn\u2019t afford, or didn\u2019t buy a house as quick as today young\npeople do. Things were a la -- a little different. And anyway, I bought the first house and -- so\nthat by that time we had a little -- my daughter, Gail and so we moved into the house and we\nlived in Colonia, New Jersey. I moved out of Carteret because I didn\u2019t like it there, it was a very\nblue collar town and it was a very limited type of town and I wanted my kids to go to a little\nbetter school in a -- in a community that they had better schools, so I moved to Colonia, New\nJersey.",
        "Q: We-We\u2019re about at the end of the tape, so I have to stop and turn it over.",
        "A: Oh, okay.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: You were talking about getting married, having a child, moving from Carteret, the store not\nworking out. Backing up, where did you meet your wife?",
        "A: Oh, my wife I met in -- actually through a fr-friend, somebody she knew on a blind date,\nactually. And she was from Hillside, New Jersey. And we had a couple of dates and before you\nknow it we were getting married.",
        "Q: So did you know right away that she was the one?",
        "A: Yeah, actually I did, you know, oddly enough.",
        "Q: What -- can you say what there was, or is it -- must be something --",
        "A: Well, there was just a certain connection, I guess, you know, there\u2019s a certain spark or\nsomething. And I liked her immediately. And at first we didn't, somehow or another we didn\u2019t\nclick too much, so I -- for like about three or four months we hardly saw each other, and then\nafter that we started getting together again and all of a sudden I realized that -- that I was in love\nwith her. And before you know it, we got married. It was just that s-simple. But Pll backtrack a\nlittle bit.",
        "Q: And your wife is Jewish?",
        "A: Yes, my wife is Jewish. Yeah, she was the -- actually, her father had died when she was very\nyoung, so s -- her mother raised -- there were three sisters, you know, so she was the middle one.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And [Il backtrack a little bit to Carteret. Carteret was a -- well, where I had my store, was a\nvery simple blue collar town, like I s -- mentioned before, it was a lot of e-ethnic people, some of\nthem were first generation people, but all of them were actually foreigners, they were\nimmigrants. And when I had the store in Carteret I never liked Carteret too much because it was\nvery hickish and blue collar --",
        "Q: Very what?",
        "A: Very hick.",
        "Q: Oh, hick, okay.",
        "A: Yeah, hick. And I somehow -- and I didn\u2019t care for it too much because when I first came to\nCarteret I si -- lived there, I must say this, people were not bad by any means, even the Jewish\npeople, but their -- most of the people I found were very condescending, like even when they\nwere -- they really were not interested about what happened during the war, but everybody was\nlike -- like -- almost like you pat a dog, poor kid, and -- and I really remember I didn\u2019t like that. I\ndidn\u2019t want to be pitied, I didn\u2019t want to -- you know. And I remember that made a big\nimpression on me when I was very young, and I was very proud, if you will. And I -- all I\nwanted to be is this -- like everybody else. And that was one of the reasons I moved out of\nCarteret the first chance I had, okay. As a matter of fact, even my sister, my brother-in-law\nespecially, was against me moving out of town, it was what do you mean it\u2019s not good enough?\nAnd all the people in town used to tell me, what are you a big shot, it\u2019s not good enough to live\nhere? And all of a sudden I found, because I was an immigrant, that I had no right to make my\nown decision, that people actually thought -- they would almost think what you\u2019re entitled to,\nyou know. And now that I look back I find it funny, but at the time 1-it was -- it was a big thing.",
        "Q: Now what -- were your sister and brother-in-law treated the same way?",
        "A: No, no, my sister -- you have to remember my brother-in-law lived -- was already in the\nStates over 40 years when I came.",
        "Q: Over four?",
        "A: 40.",
        "Q: 40?",
        "A: Yeah. My -- this brother-in-law, this mist -- William Lebow. So he had brothers, they were all\nwell established, you know. So they were already part of the scene.",
        "Q: And ha -- and he was older --",
        "A: So he was -- he was the -- no, he was one of the people, you know, he was highly respected in\ntown, you know, his brothers were respected, they all had businesses.",
        "Q: And about how old a man was he?",
        "A: Well, at the time he was -- when he got mar -- right after -- at that time he was about 42 years\nold.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: [indecipherable] I\u2019m sorry I said he was here 40 years. He was here about 20 - 25 years\nalready at the time.",
        "Q: Oh, okay, and he was in his 40\u2019s?",
        "A: So he wa -- he was in his 40\u2019s.",
        "Q: And your sister, because she was his wife, was she treated like he was, or --",
        "A: Oh, no, no, no, no, they -- they were all treated right, but you know it was a kind of a -- the\nsituation was different, the society at the time. You had to co -- if you came in from out of town\nyou had to sort of prove to yourself that -- the townspeople thought they had a monopoly on the\ntown, something li -- it\u2019s just a sentimentality. But I was working in the store there -- once I\nowned the store and one of the things that was happening to me is that I was not making a lot of\nmoney, and -- I backtracked a little -- and I was -- it was getting on my nerves, I was not making\na lot of money and I was -- had to deal with a lot of people, they were like Ukrainian or Polish,\nand they\u2019d come in, I spoke their language, you tried to be nice and they would always accuse\nyou of being a cheat because you were Jewish and so on. So there was certain resentment on my\npart with certain accusation on their part. And I wasn\u2019t willing to take that garbage because I\nfigured if they don\u2019t like me, too bad, that\u2019s their problem. And I just wouldn\u2019t ba -- put it\nsimply, my tolerance level was not very high [indecipherable] treated and anti-Semitism. So in\nthe meantime, like I say, I\u2019m -- I -- the money wasn\u2019t there and one day I realized that I came to\nthe United States, I wanted to be an American, I want to act like one, I want to speak like one.\nHere I\u2019m spending most of the time with people that don\u2019t speak English and they are illiterate\nor -- or very poorly educated and I spend every day with these people and all of a sudden I found\nout that was not what I wanted. So I got very mad one day -- this is after spending there seven,\neight years, to my regret, I got mad and I said I\u2019m going to close the store, I\u2019m going to move to\nCalifornia this time to --",
        "Q: Yeah, were you married at this point?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: You were married.",
        "A: No, I was married, but by that time already my daughter was, let\u2019s see, must have been about\nfour years old. And by that time I had a son, Jeffrey, which came later, about a year and a half or\n-- yeah, almost two years after my daughter. So, they was both small, Jeffrey must have been like\nabout two years old. And I decided I\u2019ve had it with this and I\u2019m not going to live like I\u2019ve lived\nit -- like if I was in Europe, I want to live in America. So I wanted to get out of this\nneighborhood. Besides, I saw there was no -- no future there. So I picked up and I went to\nCalifornia with my wife and children, and by that time my other brother that had come out from\nRussia was -- also went to Israel with the Haganah from Czechoslovakia. But eventually we\nbrought him out to the United States because it was getting too expensive to upkeep him in\nIsrael, we have to send him money all the time, so we decided to bring him over here. So by that\ntime, that was, I think -- I\u2019m not sure what year it was. But anyway, by that time he was already -\n- we brought him out from Israel to the United States, and -- but he also moved to California\nbecause my sister was there. So he settled in California, so when I decided to move, he was\nalready living there, plus I had my other sister there. And when we got there we tried to get an\napartment, but in the meantime I had left a lot of loose ends here in New Jersey. So -- because I\ndidn\u2019t empt -- empty out a store and so on. So I had to come back, so I left my wife and my\nchildren there, and while I was here settling my affairs, my wife decided she didn\u2019t like it there\nand she came back -- she got -- hopped on a plane and came back. So that was --",
        "Q: With the children.",
        "A: With the children, right. So --",
        "Q: And only your stuff was still in California?",
        "A: No, and -- right, well we didn\u2019t move per se, you know, we just went physically, ourselves\nyou know.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: To find an apartment and so on. But our house -- oh yes, in the meantime, the house that I had\nbought, I sold, because I was moving in California, cause I -- I was so sure we were going to stay\nthere. But anyway, at the time my wife was a little emotionally upset and so on, because of sh --\nafter the children, she had a little tough time of it emotionally or mentally. So anyway she -- all\nof a sudden something struck her there, she didn\u2019t like California, so she got on a plane.",
        "Q: Did she have family here?",
        "A: Yes, she had family here.",
        "Q: On the east coast?",
        "A: Her mother lived here, although her -- her relationship with her mother was not great. But her\nsisters lived here -- no, actually one sister lived here at the time, one sister lived in California I\nthink, at the time. And anyway, she got on a plane and she came back with the children. So once\nshe was back, I didn\u2019t have much of a choice. My house was sold and the business was gone, so I\ngot an apartment momentarily and we lived in the apartment for a little while. And then along\ncame -- one of my lawyers that I knew told me there was this small house available, and I\ndecided that a house, it wouldn\u2019t cost me much more than the apartment, even though it was\nsmall.",
        "Q: Whoops, something happened.",
        "A: Oh [inaudible]",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Okay, anyway, so on the spur of the moment, instead of staying in this apartment which we\ndid not like, I decided -- I bought this house, it was a little smaller than I would have liked to, but\nwe could afford it. And it\u2019s what we could afford, so we moved into this small house, in Colonia\nagain. And the children started school over there, and we lived there f -- we intended to live there\nlike a couple years and we -- it turned out we lived there like about 10 - 12 years in this house,\ncause my wife didn\u2019t want to move from there, cause she got so used to it. But in the meantime I\ngot a job as soon as I came back, worked f-for again, a s-small s-supermarket for a shor -- for\nabout couple of years. And then I decided to go back and to -- I found a place and I wanted to\nopen a store. And again this time it was very important for me that I open in an area where you\nhave Americans, that I deal with regular people rather than like back in Europe. So I opened this\nstore in Madison, New Jersey, it was a new store and I struggled there --",
        "Q: A -- you opened the store, it was an independent --",
        "A: Ah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- grocery store?",
        "A: No, it was an independent, actually it was more of a butcher store, okay.",
        "Q: And you just opened it?",
        "A: I just opened it from scratch, right.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I set it up and I opened it, after I worked for this ga -- fellow, Woodbridge for a couple of\nyears. And like I said, this was a new shopping center, and I opened up, but it was a ups --\ncoming community. So I opened the store with a little -- in mind with a little hi -- better caliber\nof customer, and little up -- upscale, and I struggled there for a couple of years, again not making\nmoney. Actually, I was losing money for the first couple of years. But eventually I made it, the\nstore caught on eventually because from the start it got the good reputation. And I sit in this\nparticular store for the next 25 years, while my kids were growing up, I sent them through school\nand so on. So as far as living in general, you know, we tried to live as normal as possible, as any\nAmerican would. But here, for the first time in my life, the customers spoke English, I spoke\nEnglish and I felt like it was -- I arrived in the United States, I didn't have to put up with places\nlike Carteret. So in that respect I -- 1-it\u2019s sort of like my dream, I guess, of living as an American\ncame true.",
        "Q: So you had a really tough period for awhile.",
        "A: Well, 1-1t -- it was tough, I\u2019m sure it was not any tougher than anybody -- but hindsight it\ndoesn\u2019t seem so tough. At the time I -- I -- I remember, because one of the biggest problem was -\n- again, it\u2019s very hard to compare it to -- to 1999 or 2000, is because the amount of money people\nare making is -- was just entirely different level, you know, it was --- it was true everything was -\n-a-- alot of things were less expensive, but it was very hard to make -- make money and keep\nit, because things -- things were difficult, especially like in my case, you know, I\u2019m sure that\nthere were a lot of people, i-immigrants like myself had the same problem, nobody helped you\nperiod, whether it -- but -- which was okay because I wanted to be self reliant. However, 1n some\ncases people come, they get big wedding gifts, or they get a start here, they gotta push there.\nLike I had a friend, he was complaining about his father-in-law [indecipherable], but he would\nbuy him carpeting for the house, or -- or buy him a garage, or whatever, were -- were -- or -- or\nturned over the business to him, whatever, I didn\u2019t have that. So it was 1-in a sense struggle. On\nthe other hand, why should I look for some -- someone else to give it to me, you know, it\u2019s\nsimple as -- as far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s okay. But it was tough, because the amount of money\nyou made or you\u2019ve been able to keep was very difficult. And in that respect, I guess it was\ntough, but I imagine that most people had -- didn\u2019t have it much different.",
        "Q: So now your're retired?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And how did you decide to retire?",
        "A: Well again, I was in the store and we -- I was there like 25 years and the real estate -- the\nshopping center was sold to another company and the first thing the new company came in, they\ntook over, they wanted to triple my rent, which I could -- definitely could not afford. And by\nnow the business also was suffering, cause I was in the meat business and the cholesterol thing\ncame on very quickly, very strong, and all of a sudden the demand, plus the competition was just\ntoo much to -- to absorb, because the demand just dropped, and -- while the competition was\nincreasing. I was in an area, it was a very competitive area. There was like four or five\nsupermarkets within a couple of miles of me. But for the longest time I held out, but with a\nreduction of meat consumption, it was going down. So then when the new landlord came in, and\nhe demanded almost triple rent, plus extra added expenses, I just felt I couldn\u2019t afford to stay\nthere. So I retired prematurely; I really wanted to stay in business another four or five years. And\n-- so once -- which worried me, because I didn\u2019t think I could afford it economically. But\nsomehow or another, once I saw that I had to go, I made the best of it and so far so good.",

        "Q: -- not be working any more?",
        "A: -- I thought I would have a problem with that. As it turns out I don\u2019t have a -- I -- I adjusted\nvery easily. I amazed myself. I will say -- after I retired, I did, when I got out of business, I did\ngo part time. I worked for a supermarket in New Jersey for -- periodically. And when I didn\u2019t\nwork there I worked someplace else, couple of -- two or three days a week or so, and now that I\nmoved here actually, I\u2019m also doing -- basically still doing the same thing, I\u2019m working a little\nbit, part time and then I volunteer and I do things. I\u2019m not bored.",

        "A: Well, I find them, really --",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: -- most of the time. Because when I came here I -- it took a long -- I did some of it in New\nJersey, but when I came here I didn't know the area, I didn\u2019t know where to start. So it\u2019s a little -\n- I didn\u2019t depend on it too much. So I started working actually one day in Katz\u2019s. Here I walked\nin one day and he asked me if I could help him out, I got to talk to him. And I started helping\nhim out, I\u2019m still there.",

        "Q: Now, how did you happen to volunteer there?",
        "A: What happened 1s that I had -- in the beginning when I first moved here I had a hard time to\neven go into the museum, by the way, it took me like two or three years prior to -- that I went in.\nIt took me three years just to get in the door. But when I moved here, I kept on meeting people\nand they were telling me -- and once I walked into the museum, I realized that once I broke the\nbarrier and I was able to walk in there that I would like to volunteer. Because I was thinking\nprior to this to volunteer in other museum, like in the Smithsonian. But when I got familiar with\nthe Holocaust Museum, I decided to volunteer there.",
        "Q: And why did you decide to volunteer there?",
        "A: Well, I figured that just for the sake of enlightening, like people that come in or whatever, to\nmake them understand certain things what they saw, something like that, something\n[indecipherable |",
        "Q: What did you want them to understand?",
        "A: Oh, they\u2019Il un-understand, instead of just seeing pictures, or just seeing -- to give them a little\nmore meaning to it if -- if -- if I had the chance that -- to understand. Cause sometime you look at\npictures or you read something, it\u2019s one thing, but then sometime when another person sort of\nco-conveys a little explanation to you, maybe you got a little better insight of it.",
        "Q: Well, like what insight did you want them to have?",
        "A: Well, like understanding.",
        "Q: What did you want them to take away?",
        "A: Well, I want them to take away more or less the -- how precarious freedom can be. Basically,\nthis is the way I see things, that 1f you don\u2019t know what dangers lie, you\u2019re not careful to protect\nwhat you have. If you -- th-that freedom is something you don\u2019t take for granted. That -- it\u2019s\nsomething that you have to you know, that you have to be aware of what\u2019s out there and not to\nallow yourself to be caught in it, basically.",
        "Q: And what do you do at the museum?",
        "A: Well, this past two years, actually, I was taking young kids through the \u201cDaniel\u2019s Story,\u201d\nokay. N-Now this year I\u2019m going to go and -- in fact they\u2019re going to have a training course for\nolder kids, like in the permanent museum. So I\u2019m gonna volunteer in there, I think, also.",
        "Q: And you take people through, you mean you explain --",
        "A: Yeah, it -- it -- it --",
        "Q: -- you actually explain --",
        "A: -- yeah, explain it, you know --",
        "Q: -- things as [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- like in the \u201cDaniel\u2019s Story,\u201d it\u2019s for the younger children, that\u2019s four to seven graders. So\nwe take them through and we explain to them, we try to give them a certain understanding at\ntheir level. And oddly enough, in some cases I think it does a lot of good, you know.",
        "Q: So you -- you feel that they are receptive --",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "Q: -- that they can understand --",
        "A: Right, right --",
        "Q: -- and they\u2019re interested.",
        "A: -- right. And I -- and I\u2019ve also seen, from different aspects -- in fact, my daughter is on the\nboard of -- in the ADL and I\u2019ve ga -- and they have programs that are also sometimes in\nconjunction with the museum. And they started a program, they train teachers, the Catholic\ndiocese of the Washington area. And I\u2019ve seen what they did -- what they\u2019re doing in the\nCatholic schools is just phenomenal. And I -- I feel that when you get it out there, if you got\npeople that cooperate and they educate and they give them exposure that you get these kids that\nmake -- grow up to be anti -- very big anti-Semites, that they get it from education of certain --\nthey get certain information that I may -- they will not get at home, but they get it in the school,\nlike in the Catholic school an -- at that, that each time you in -- you inject people like this with a\nlittle knowledge, that sooner or later it helps someplace else as they grow up. You know what\u2019s -\n- even if they have a background of anti-Semitism, they already -- they got it in their own school,\nthrough good teachers, which I\u2019ve seen some of them are very, very capable. So this is the kind\nof stuff, that\u2019s one of the reasons I feel that it\u2019s very important to reach them. And a lot of the\nkids we get in the museum, many times you think of Jewish kids, actually we get kids from\nCarolinas, from Oklahoma and from that -- kids that never heard of Jews, or -- or never had any -\n- you know. So this way it gives them, instead of thinking of a Jew as a Jew, they think of Jew as\nperson that went through a bad experience. And -- and maybe some of them will understand\nsome of it. So in that respect I think it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a very good thing.",
        "Q: When we met a week or so ago, I thought you had said that you worked in the speaker\u2019s\nbureau?",
        "A: Oh yeah, I forgot, okay, I do that too, right, okay.",
        "Q: What do you do there?",
        "A: Well, in there I -- I speak before groups, every so often, just about my experience, basically.\n[-It\u2019s geared mostly to an individual\u2019s experience.",
        "Q: And how is that for you to do that?",
        "A: Well, at this age it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s a -- each time it\u2019s a little difficult because it\u2019s very emotional.\nBut in the same time I feel that again, if people hear it, if somebody comes up with denials and\nthey hear it from somebody like me that I went through it, all of a sudden th-they -- when a -- a\ndenier denies, they may not buy it. And then -- so in that respect I think it\u2019s -- as a matter of fact,\njust recently I spoke to the -- in the museum itself, and we had a full hou -- the whole theater was\nfull, actually standing room only. And I could not believe the amount of people that came --\ncame up to me and they were just, you know, genuinely touched and -- and they were [phone\nringing| Excuse me.",
        "Q: Okay, we\u2019ll turn it off. [tape break] You were talking about speaking at the museum recently\nand people coming up to you afterward.",
        "A: Oh yes, and it -- it was very, you know, I don\u2019t know, how can I put it? I -- I was very\nsurprised and -- because people came up and they actually [indecipherable] and asked for -- even\nfor an autograph, you know, they were like very taken wi -- and the response was just fantastic.\nAnd you have to remember, most of these people -- not most -- if not all of them were -- like\nprobably 90 percent of them were not Jewish, you know, and they wanted. So when you see it\nmakes an impact like that it gives you an idea that it -- it\u2019s the thing to do, you know, to -- to\nmake -- because th -- fa -- just for no other reason, just the fact that this way they could say gee, I\nmet someone, so who 1s this guy denying that this happened when it did happen. I met someone\nthat did.",
        "Q: Really.",
        "A: So that respect I think it -- it serves a big purpose.",
        "Q: You\u2019ve -- you\u2019ve done a lot of being interviewed, not only the speaking that you do, but for\nthe Wiesenthal Center, for the Shoah Foundation and now today. How is that for you? What is\nthat like for you?",
        "A: Well, a-at this stage 1-it\u2019s still -- every time I give an interview 1-1t\u2019s still difficult for some\nreason. Certain areas you just get very emotional. But the only reason I did it is because\neverybody says it\u2019s important for -- for the history, so when I was in California a few years ago,\nI -- you know, I did it because some -- for the same reason, and the same reason here. And I just\nfeel that if there\u2019s enough information out there that the deniers will have less chance of denying,\nbasically.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Can we go back? You mentioned that you had two children, but what was it like for\nyou when your childr -- when your first child was born?",
        "A: For me it was like probably the nicest thing that ever happened to me. ... When my daughter\nwas born, I -- it actually changed my life and gave me more purpose if anything, and it was just\none of the nicest things probably in my whole entire life. And -- and then of course my son came,\nso it, you know, iv -- 1t was just -- I enjoyed my kids from the time they were born. I -- I could\nhonestly say that. I\u2019m very fortunate in that regard. As a matter of fact, yesterday was our\nanniversary, our 44\" anniversary. So my daughter made dinner and I can honestly say -- she is\nlike 40 -- 42 years old, I think, and I had nothing but pleasure from her, so -- and now she has\ntwo children and it -- it\u2019s like I\u2019m getting it all over again, so it\u2019s really very, very nice. Now, my\nson got married and he -- he\u2019s also married a very nice woman and she 1s like -- like my\ndaughter. And they have a -- a little boy now, Joshua. And so in that regard I think that between\nmy children, my grandchildren, it\u2019s probably the crowning of my life, if you will.",
        "Q: You mentioned that you moved to this area about five years ago.",
        "A: Yes, five years ago.",
        "Q: And how did you decide to move to this area?",
        "A: Well, once I ga -- gave up the store, it was a matter of -- of I could not live where I was,\nbecause I liked it there too, but it was a matter of moving into a senior citizen complex or Florida\nor whatever. And then I realized that I would rather live near my daughter so I could watch my\ngrandchildren grow up. So that was a easy decision, and it was a good decision because I really -\n- and I didn't want to go out and live in a senior citizen complex because I really didn\u2019t want to\ngo out to pasture, I want to live among the living, that life goes on. And so basically I got what I\nwanted, you -- you know. So I -- I really made the right decision, as far as I\u2019m concerned.",
        "Q: I also wanted to ask you about your religion. You talked about that some when I was here a\ncouple of weeks ago, but I wonder if you would talk about that on the tape. You took -- you -- I\nsaw in the -- one of the tapes that you -- your family growing up was very observant and\nOrthodox and that you went to Hebrew school, you were Bar Mitzvahed, and then you were --\nthe Holocaust came along, and then what?",
        "A: Yes, I, as far as religion, I guess I\u2019m not what I would call religious, per se. I\u2019m more\nnonsectarian if you will, in some respects. Yet, Iam very Jewish , or I did [indecipherable] I wou\n-- did grow up, it seemed like when I -- where I grew up, everybody was Orthodox and\neverybody was observant, period. There it was a given, you were Jewish, you were brought up\nsomewhat -- most people were -- were Orthodox and -- and observant, especially in our town,\nbut most people were. In the city you found some people that were maybe wavering a little bit.\nBut I have to ad -- say, we got in -- when we got into a concentration camp, I remember the first\nholiday right a -- we came -- actually, we came to Mauthausen from Auschwitz, and I remember\nwe were in Mauthausen, this was like about a week after Auschwitz actually, a week or te -- to\ntwo weeks after Auschwitz, and it was [indecipherable] because -- I remember that. And my\nfather, my uncle, and whoever, you know, the oldest got together in a huddle and tried to say the\nprayers as much as -- most of them knew it by heart. And somehow [indecipherable] right there\nand then, I sort of like couldn\u2019t fake it, I just -- I just -- I just couldn\u2019t see it, because of what\nhappened. And from there on in I was not religious. I literally, in the beginning, I guess it used to\nbother me, but after awhile you just learn to live with it and I -- I just never got -- I never thought\nof religion as -- as an important part of my life, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. And when I lived in\nCzechoslovakia for a short time after the war, there was no o-organized synagogue or anything\nthat I recall a-at the time, and the government or the -- basically the whole population in general\nin Czechoslovakia was not exactly a religious type of country like in some countries. And\nwherever you went, on papers you have to fill out, we put out atheist fa -- because it was easier.\nIf you put on -- like in Europe you have to put on Jewish, or religion on a -- on application. And\nwe chose atheist for one simple reason, because if some clerk would get ahold of your paper, if\nyou said Jewish he probably wouldn\u2019t pass it. If it was atheist he would pass it, whatever. And --",
        "Q: Now this -- you said we, this is?",
        "A: Like in general -- ge -- a lot of Jewish people in we --",
        "Q: Like your sister, and --",
        "A: -- yeah, wa -- like a lot of Jewish in general. And it was -- religion was not part of your daily\nlife. And -- and then, of course, when I came to the United States I had to work Saturday right\nfrom the start and it so -- it so --",
        "Q: And that -- you were working for a Jew in a kosher store?",
        "A: Oh no, no, no. You mean here in the United States?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: No, no, I never worked -- no, this was a non-kosher business. I never worked in a kosher\nstore.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah. No, this was my brother-in-law had a non-kosher --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- it was a -- a regular store.",
        "Q: But he worked on Saturdays.",
        "A: He worked on Saturdays. And my brother-in-law [indecipherable] was really very agnostic,\nhe -- he just was not into religion. He was very smart, very well read person, but he was not\nreligious. But he was also very well learned in religion that -- the funniest thing, cause it was --\nhe was -- he went to Yeshiva and all that. But he -- he was definitely not religious. As a matter of\nfact he was -- and I have to admit, I sort of went along the same -- same route, because I worked\nSaturdays. And religion to me wasn\u2019t something that I had a need for, and I still don\u2019t\n[indecipherable]. So I\u2019m -- I -- I -- now I go to services and I do go because of my grandchildren\nand I want to belong, so I sort of -- but I\u2019m not a very religious person, per se. However I live, I\nthink in life I practice most of the Jewish teachings or -- or live my life as -- as a Jew. I never\ndenied being Jewish. I never went around with a thing on the lapel like some people to -- to\nprove that I\u2019m Jewish, I don\u2019t have to prove anything. So I never had that -- but o-otherwise my\nthinking is also more on a nonsectarian level in some respects, like politically I -- I am liberal, I\nguess you would say, politically. But I am conservative maybe in some areas, you know, and I\nguess Jews may be, okay. So I\u2019m not exactly -- but some -- but religion really doesn\u2019t play, or\nnever played a big part in my life. In other words, I looked at religion more of a -- as a crutch\nwoulds -- like someone -- I see some people do and I didn\u2019t want crutches. So this is my way of\nexplaining it.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: We do have to turn over the tape.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape two, side A, Martin Weiss. I -- I want to ask you what you think about some\ncontemporary things, like recently Joseph Lieberman was nominated to be vice president on the\ndemocratic ticket. How -- how did you feel about that?",
        "A: Well, I -- I feel good about it, however, I have a little problem with it. I -- I like the idea that\nhe was chosen, and I respect him, definitely, because I think he\u2019s a capable guy, not because he\u2019s\nJewish necessarily, but he has a certain -- he has a good character. But I think they overplayed a\nlittle too much, they made a -- a lot to -- too much to do with -- the press in particular, about him\nbeing Jewish. And I think sometimes the Jewish community made a big thing to know about him\nbeing Jewish. And I have a think on this that all things considered, that he\u2019s Jewish, we know\nthis and a -- but he is -- more, he is running as a citizen of the United States, not as a Jew, so they\nshouldn\u2019t make such a big issue of him being Jewish. In other words it shouldn\u2019t be -- like if this\nwas in 1900 and they were making a big to-do about him being Jewish, it\u2019s one thing, but you\u2019re\ntalking about 2000, where I think the citizens should be -- he\u2019s a citizen of the United States. So\nhe -- is he running as a Jew, or 1s he running as a citizen? And I think they\u2019re making too much\nof it, the fact that he is Jewish. And I have to admit, I have mixed feelings because when Jimmy\nCarter ran, one thing I didn\u2019t like about him 1s because of his religion, because he was a born\nagain. And I thought that was -- like it clouded his thinking in terms of decision making, or\nwhatever. So I should apply the same thing to hi -- to Lieberman. However, whether it\u2019s my own\nprejudice or what, I think Lieberman is more based -- how can I put it? Grounded, if you will,\nand Jimmy Carter was more emotionally born again, but -- where Lieberman is more of a -- has a\ngood character, plus he is jew -- he is Orthodox. So maybe there 1s a difference in how I see it,\nokay? But I don\u2019t like when they stress the Jewish part to the point where they already did.\n[inaudible]",
        "Q: There have been some portrayals of the Holocaust in movies recently, such as \u201cSchindler\u2019s\nList,\u201d and there was one, \u201cLife Can Be Beautiful.\u201d",
        "A: Yes, I saw both of them.",
        "Q: Yeah, what -- what do you think of like --",
        "A: Well, I -- I -- I really thought they were both very good. \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d of course, was in a\ndifferent -- on a different level. I think \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d I think was fantastic, and it didn\u2019t color\nanything, it gave it a picture from the raw, like -- like it -- not that I was in the same place or had\nthe same experience, but it was -- 1-1t was rather -- rather well done in the sense to give the\nportrayal of -- of what\u2019s -- how things were at the time, or how a soldier behaved, or how -- you\nknow, different things. As far as the Schindler story itself, Pll be honest with you, I never heard\nof it before the movie came about, I never heard of this. So from my vantage point I never\nbelieved something like this could happen in -- in reality. Evidently it did, so I -- you know, for\nme it was a -- you know, something almost hard to believe on the beginning, you know, until it\nwas well documented, that there was a German that was -- that would do something like he did.\nBut the movie itself, the portrayal and the circumstances of the inmates and th -- and -- versus\nthe officer and the -- and the part and so on. It -- it really gave it a -- a pretty good picture of a --\nwhat life was like.",
        "Q: And what about the other one, is it life --",
        "A: Oh, \u201cLife is Beautiful.\u201d",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: That one I liked too. At first I wasn\u2019t sure I'd like it because it was a comedy, how can you\nmake a comedy out of it? But all in all I thought it was really a very, very good movie. Very,\nvery good. I -- I thought it was just very clever and in spite of they tried to make other movies\nsomething similar, I don\u2019t think they came even close. This -- this one here I think was very\nunique for this type of movie.",
        "Q: Did you feel it was realistic, or --",
        "A: No, no, definitely was not realistic, but -- but it was --",
        "Q: What -- what did you like about it?",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s --",
        "Q: I didn\u2019t see the movie, I know what it\u2019s about, but I didn\u2019t see it.",
        "A: I -- I saw it awhile ago, so I don\u2019t remember exactly. But I liked about it because it -- it sort of\nconveyed a certain ca -- comedy -- a -- a sort of comical part of life, in a sense, from a satirical\npoint of view, or something like this. I think it has a certain satire that -- that was very\nilluminating as -- to some extent, sort of on a human nature, of a psyche, whatever, you know. So\nin that respect I thought it was a very good movie, you know.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: There was one movie [indecipherable] talking about movies that I saw recently that I really\nthought it was very good also. Maybe not quite as [indecipherable] but that was \u201cSunshine\u201d, I\ndon\u2019t know if you heard of it.",
        "Q: I did hear about it and it was highly recommended to me.",
        "A: And it really was one of the movies that -- the reason I thought it was very good is because it\ndealt with the subject of assimilation, which I found very unique to Hungarian Jews, to a lot of --",
        "Q: Unique to Hungarians?",
        "A: Yes. And a -- to Hungarian Jews because they tried very hard to assimilate and very har --\ntried to be very like -- almost like a intelligentsia type persona. You know, it -- it tried to take on\nthat -- that Germanic mantle, if you will. In -- in the -- Hungary it\u2019s very similar in the -- in the\nclass system and so on. Which I was viol [indecipherable] always very violently opposed to, you\nknow, from my point of view. And --",
        "Q: You were violently opposed to --",
        "A: Opposed to that Hungarian Jewish mentality, you know.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: And one of the reasons that I thought it was good is because of the -- it deals with the subject\nof assimilation and a lot of Hungarian Jews were -- because of you did have a class system on\nHungary, and so everybody tried to make sure they act like they were very fancy, or very uppity.\nAnd I remember even as a kid I used to find it very, very bothersome to me. And when I saw\nHungarian, a lot of Hungarian Jews, not all, a lot of Hungarian Jews, even during the war, a lot\nof the Hungarians were -- punished them because they were Jewish, and they were doing things\nto them that they were Jewish. They would always [indecipherable] breast that they\u2019re royal\nHungarians, okay, and I found that very, very disgusting to -- 1f you will. If somebody beats me\nI\u2019m not going to say I love you, you know. And basically this deals with that type of subject, you\nknow, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a very -- you have to understand that, the -- like in the context, you know. And I\nfound it very amusing that somebody had enough sense to make a movie like that. And that\u2019s\nabout as closest to what I think, the way I understood things, that -- that -- you know, this shows\nit for what it is. That if you are persecuted and somebody berates you because you\u2019re Jewish,\nyou don\u2019t join them and become one of them because he doesn\u2019t like you to be Jewish. Instead\nyou tell him to go to hell, you know, where I come from, you know. In fact during -- even in the\ncamps, I -- I recall, a lot of the Polish Jews -- like we always had markings where we came from.\nLike I -- even though I was from Czechoslovakia [indecipherable] we were taken to camp, but\nfrom Hungary. We were not from Czechoslovakia. So we had a mark that we came from\nHungary, a U for Ungar. And the Polish Jews used to hate Hungarian Jews, okay, and one of the\nreasons was, believe it or not, for that reason. And I was [indecipherable] when I lived among\nthe Hungarian Jews and I moved -- and I went from Hungary, I was -- lived on Hungary. But I\nhad the same resentment to them, for that reason, because they always insisted what good\nHungarians they were. And me, as a Jew, I don\u2019t care where I am, if a -- a Ukrainian doesn\u2019t like\nme, I\u2019m not going to say I love you, I\u2019ll hate him back. So, you know, that\u2019s my take on it, for\nwhat it\u2019s worth.",
        "Q: So you thought that was a good portrayal of --",
        "A: Yes, it was very good portrayal, a really [indecipherable] very good. It tells like of three\ngenerations, and could have had some different ways that I saw things, but nevertheless it -- it\nreally hit the mark. I thought 1t was very good.",
        "Q: Well, I don\u2019t have any more questions. Do you have anything that you would like to say, or\ncan you think of anything that I neglected to ask?",
        "A: No, I -- I did -- I think you covered it all. I would just like to say that by and large most of us\nwere lucky to come, make a life in the U.S.. And things -- all things considered, things have\nchanged in the United States too. I remember when I came there were a lot of things I didn't\nunderstand about -- there was Jim Crow and a lot of other things I remember. I used to go to\nnight school, I used to ask, and I could never understand it. But all things considered, that things\nhave improved, and they\u2019re improving constantly with civil rights. So I really think I\u2019m fortunate\nthat I\u2019m here. And I think probably most people that came from Europe the time I came would\nprobably -- probably endorse that. And that is going to be all that I have to say. I think it\u2019s -- and\nlife is good if you -- as long as you stay healthy.",

        "Q: And what do you do at the museum?",
        "Q: And you take people through, you mean you explain --",
        "Q: -- you actually explain --",
        "Q: -- things as [indecipherable]",

So,\nactually we lived together til we came to the United States, which was, I believe July of \u201946.",
        "A: Soon as the war was over -- and we lived in Karlovy Vary, my brother-in-law was a\n[indecipherable] of -- in the Czechoslovakia legion in the Czech army at the time. So he --",
        "A: My brother-in-law.",
        "A: Fred Morris. He was a -- a -- an itch -- and he came back after the war with the Czech army\nfrom Russia. So he lived under the -- on the Soviet -- I mean, he was in the Soviet Union for part\nof the war. And he knew that we should not let us stay there because the Soviet Union will have\nstrong influence. So when they had the first elections and the communists won, we saw that the\nsecret police or so was getting very strong. We decided that we di -- immediately to get papers as\nsoon as possible and leave the country. So my brother-in-law had a brother in United States, so\nhe got an affidavit from him and my sister and myself got an affidavit from my distant cousin,\nwhich my sister acquired, and [indecipherable] his name was Sam Fuchs, and he sent us an\naffidavit to come to the United States. And my brother-in-law was capable enough that he got the\npapers moving very fast and we were fortunate we left rather early, one of the first people to\nleave that part of -- of Europe at the time. And on the way here we went through Sweden.",
        "A: No, we went by bus to Denmark and from Denmark we went by a -- a ferry or a boat to\nSweden, and we took the ship from -- I believe it was Stockholm to -- to the United States.",
        "A: The ship\u2019s name by the way was the [indecipherable |",
        "A: Well, y-yes, oddly enough we did. In the short time that we were -- spent in that -- in\nCzechoslovakia -- because my brother-in-law was a veteran, so they -- the Czechs were taking\naway business from the Germans and giving it to veterans. So he was one of those people, he got\na business from a German auto parts store and we -- also, when we left he sold -- he sold the\nstore of -- the fa -- in fact [indecipherable] the store to another fellow, and the other fellow had\nrelatives in the United States, he was able to get some money, so I remember we got something\nlike 1300 dollars, or maybe 2000 dollars and that covered our fare to the United States. So\nactually we paid af -- for own fare on the way here.",
        "A: A-Actually it was five of us. It was my brother-in-law, my sister and myself, and his brother\nand his wife. So th-there was five of us that came simultaneously.",
        "A: And we came to New York, and --",
        "A: The crossing was, you know, pretty good, although we got seasick, but oth-otherwise, you\nknow, we were -- it was a nice crossing, it was a -- a civilian ship, so it was good enough, as far\nas that goes. And we came to New York, and like I said, my brother-in-law has his brother here,\nand --",
        "A: In New York, he lived in New York, and his -- and I had my sister, so immediately -- my\nsister lived in the Bronx at the time, so we spent about two, three weeks with her in the Bronx,\nbut after that I go -- she got me a job.",
        "A: No, the same sister. No, the sister that was here in the United States. See, I had a sister here in\nthe u -- in the -- in the Bronx.",
        "A: Her -- oh, pardon me, her name was Ellen.",
        "A: Ellen, and --",
        "A: Oh, she was the one that sent us the papers. I\u2019m sorry, thought I mentioned that. She is the\none sent us -- got the papers from Mr. Fuchs, the affidavit, I should say. She got us the affidavit\nand she send us the -- the -- the affidavit so that we can co -- we could come out.",
        "A: Right, so she was living in the Bronx, and --",
        "A: Mr. Fuchs was a distant cousin, as -- and he is the one --",
        "A: Well because in -- a-at that time, it wasn\u2019t like now, at that time, to come to the United States\nyou had to have an affidavit to guarantee that you will not be a -- you will not go on welfare or\nyou will not be a problem to the States, that you\u2019ll be s -- suf -- self supporting. So miss -- to --\nin order -- the affidavit covered that part, that you could not get the visa unless you had a -- a --\nyou had a guarantee that you will not be --",
        "A: -- a burden to the States.",
        "A: That\u2019s from my distant cousin.",
        "A: My sister is the one that\u2019s --",
        "A: -- arranged that, right, yeah.",
        "A: So we -- she\u2019s -- she actually borrowed an apartment because she lived in a smaller place, and\nwe lived there about three weeks. We got a --",
        "A: She arranged the apartment, right. And after that I -- my sister and my brother-in-law had a --\nanother -- a sister in California, so he went with my sister to California immediately.",
        "A: Yes, my youngest sister that came --",
        "A: No, not my sister, was my brother-in-law\u2019s sister in California.",
        "A: And he wanted to settle in California, so they went straight to California. And I settled,\nbecause I got a job, which was in the time, I think, most crucial. I got -- my sister got me a job\nwith someone in Carteret, New Jersey. His name was Billy Lebow. And she later, by the way,\nmarried. And she got me a job with him in a grocery store. That was my first job and I was very\nanxious to work so I could be self supporting.",
        "A: No, I did not speak a word of English. Actually, I never even -- I was never exposed to\nEnglish. The only time I heard English is when we were liberated by the Americans, and we\nheard it, but it didn\u2019t mean anything because it was a short time and we just didn\u2019t understand it.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: No, no. And I started working in the store. Naturally I --",
        "A: The store was a grocery store, okay, a small grocery store and I started working there, but one\nthing I --",
        "A: My job was -- was doing everything, I was cleaning up, helping the butchers, or helping clean\nup. Deliver groceries on a bicycle.",
        "A: No, actually I didn\u2019t, because I was very young whe -- when I left home, but my father did\nhave a butcher shop. So I had knowledge --",
        "A: -- 0-of -- of that type of business, but I really never did that type of work.",
        "A: Yeah, was familiar surroundings, right.",
        "A: Yeah, my -- my boss, it was Willy Lebow, he spoke Yiddish, of course, and -- because he was\nfrom Europe as well. And later on it just -- a-as it happens, he -- not much later, he married my\nsister, okay. So my sister also moved out to Carteret.",
        "A: Yeah, I spoke Yiddish, yes.",
        "A: I spoke Yiddish, I spoke Czech, Russian, Hungarian and of course I understood Polish, or a --\nI also spoke German, you know, and that helped a lot because a -- when a -- in that part of -- a\nlot of the -- in that town, I should say, there were a lot of ethnic eastern Europeans. So I more or\nless had a -- you know, had a way to get by with some of the customers, so that I -- although\nlanguage was a problem, but my broth -- this William Lebow instead of pe -- speaking to me\nYiddish, he spoke to me in English only. So consequently I was forced to pick up the language a\nlittle faster, because everybody spoke to me in English.",
        "A: Deliberately.",
        "A: Yeah, deliberately instead of giving me a crutch, to depend on Yiddish, spoke to me in\nEnglish.",
        "A: Well, I lived -- I got -- I was very lucky, I found a room in a nice house, oddly enough. It was\na new -- fairly new house that this working c-couple had, and they had a son, he was also my\nage. And it was a little Cape Cod, but I was fortunate, I got a room with this family. I paid them,\nyou know, for the -- rooming there. And his son had -- their son had one room and I had another\nroom upstairs and it worked out very nice. The woman kept the place clean and all I did really\nthere is sleep, you know, when I would come home from work or whatever. And later on I -- as\nsoon as I -- my sister got married, I used to have all -- most of my meals at her house, but I\nwould live on my own, you know, in this -- so this worked out very good, it was a --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, I -- while I -- as soon as I got settled, I started working -- I st -- enrolled in night school\nimmediately. I was going for a number of years to night school.",
        "A: To learn English basically, right. To learn English, right. And then when I used up the school\nin this town, I went to a couple of towns away there was -- they had a larger high school, they\nhave a little more advanced teaching, so I went over there and got some more English basically,\nand some other subjects that were whatever I wanted. But it was also at night. It was all after\nwork.",
        "A: No, I did not. I -- oddly enough, I didn\u2019t have any contact with agencies, I didn\u2019t get any help\nfrom agencies. I didn\u2019t look for it, I didn\u2019t even know whether they existed in -- in some sense.\nBut I -- I was completely -- soon as I got here I was completely on my own, which is, by the\nway, this is the way I wanted it. I didn\u2019t want any charity, I didn't want anything from anybody.",
        "A: No particular reason, I just didn\u2019t think of looking f -- to someone else, you know. Basically\nthat\u2019s all 1 -- I think that\u2019s the way it was.",
        "A: Right, and so now life took -- took on -- oh yes, in the beginning I did go back to New York\nlike on weekends, like on Sundays, because that\u2019s -- was the only day I was off and meet some\nother friends that I got to know, I knew a little, slightly. And we used to meet on Sunday and go\nout for dinner or to a movie, whatever. And -- but after --",
        "A: Well, some of them I knew -- I don\u2019t know, through the grapevine or you know, you know a\ncouple of people, then you would meet another two, three people and so on. So there was like\nfive, six of us that would meet periodically, and --",
        "A: A couple of them were -- I had known in Europe, but some of them I did not --",
        "A: -- I met here. And we were -- and the reason being is that -- oh yes, and there was still, on the\neast side there was some kind of a -- from one of the families there was a -- they had like a\norganization, they would meet once a month or something. So I went a couple of times there, and\nso on. And what [indecipherable] really was, that because you didn\u2019t know anyone, you didn't\nknow the language, so you could have [indecipherable] together. But after a very short time,\nmaybe like three months, four months, I somehow decided that that was not for me and that I\u2019m\ngoing to try and make fre -- American friends that are local so that I don\u2019t have to go to New\nYork. So I started more or less -- and I met a couple of Jewish boys in Carteret, New Jersey, and\nwe sort of became a little friendly and I went along whether it was to the beach or for pizza. And\nso slowly, slowly I started getting -- and with American kids saw that I\u2019m European. So I\nliterally -- some [indecipherable] I cut myself off entirely. Not by design, it just to happened that\nit -- it worked that way, you know. And of course I worked a lot. I de -- delivered groceries, big,\nbig boxes on this bicycle, it had one si -- a big basket and a small wheel in the front, and all th-\nth-the groceries are in big, big boxes. I was -- and I was only like 16 on -- going on 17 really,\nand I was pretty light. So the box were sometimes heavier than I was on the bicycle. But anyway,\nI did this for quite awhile, til I started driving. I was able to drive, you know, a van, which was\nlike a year, a year and a half later. And I worked, like I mentioned a lot of hours. We worked\nbetween 60 to 90 hours a week. Like I worked six days a week from seven to six and I -- two\ndays a week til nine o\u2019clock. And during the night we would go twice a week to the market to\npick up vegetables. So it was like between eight oc -- eight p.m. to maybe we\u2019 ll get back two,\nthree a.m., and the next morning we start all over again. So it was qu-quite hectic and I worked\nlike this for a number of years. And --",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, we worked all the time.",
        "A: Well, th-this was sort of different because a-a-at home in Europe it was different because it\nwas home. It was a relaxed -- 1-1t -- I d -- I don\u2019t know about relaxed, but it was -- it was a\ndifferent -- the confines were different. Here it was strictly a job working, and it was frustrating\nbecause I didn\u2019t speak the language, and plus the hours were allow -- they didn\u2019t allow you too\nmuch time for anything else, and I did a lot of what I would call really dirty work, okay?",
        "A: Such as a -- because conditions --",
        "A: -- condition -- right, conditions weren\u2019t much different than this today because today you go\nfor a job, an immigrant comes in, it\u2019s much, much different because they come in, the conditions\nare entirely different. In those days you came -- it wasn\u2019t even that somebody was doing\nsomething wrong -- like my brother-in-law wasn\u2019t necessarily a mean guy, he was a nice guy. He\nhimself worked hard. His mentality worked 1n that direction, so what I was doing was not out of\nthe ordinary for him, but it was out of the ordinary for me --",
        "A: -- because like such thing as collecting the dirty garbage with the stinking vegetables, even in\nEurope I would -- didn\u2019t do that, you know, so it was the kind of a thing for a young boy it was\nvery demeaning, if you will.",
        "A: But I still [indecipherable]. But nevertheless, I was getting paid and I was supporting myself\nand I remember a f -- I did want to move to California originally, that was my plan, and because\nthe job I got sidetracked here. In California by the way [indecipherable] that time, jobs were\nunavailable. So my brother-in-law was there, but he couldn\u2019t get a job. So that reinforced my\nneed to stay here because I was supporting myself.",
        "A: Well, number one I wanted to live with that particular sister, near -- near her, although I had a\ngood relationship with this sister as well, and she was very selfless. But the other one was\nyounger, prob -- closer to my age I should say and we had more -- we grew up together so we\nhad more of a -- a rapport, or whatever.",
        "A: That\u2019s the same sister that I came over with.",
        "A: I -- I -- yeah. And so we had a sort of very good relationship and I -- I would have felt more\ncomfortable.",
        "A: Okay. And not that this sister was not good, but I mean she -- she was actually always\nworried about me and so on. So -- but she was older and she left and I was like, about nine years\nold, so just for that reason alone, but otherwise I had equally as good a relationship with Ellen as\nI did with the other one, with Cindy. But as I worked, one thing that I do recall that used to\nfrustrate me, I wanted to go to school and I couldn\u2019t afford to go to school because I couldn\u2019t\nquit working. So every so often I -- I would get sort of upset about it [indecipherable]|tape\nbreak]",
        "A: Oh yes, however, there were a couple of reasons I couldn\u2019t go to school. First of all I -- my\npreparation wasn\u2019t as good because I left school when I was pretty young, a-a-after\n[indecipherable] grade, but -- plus I didn\u2019t -- my English was still very poor and I had no\nconfidence in going to school. Plus I couldn\u2019t afford to take off from work. So I soon decided\nthat that was the only thing I could do is work and anyway I worked like this til about -- for my\nbrother-in-law [indecipherable] for about -- til 1952, when I was drafted into the armed services,\nduring the Korean war.",
        "A: No, oddly enough. I was supposed to but somehow they didn\u2019t -- my papers didn\u2019t come\nthrough. So I was drafted into the service without being a citizen. And it\u2019s a very funny thing, I\nserved the whole time in the service and I was not even a citizen, but a -- and being in the service\ndidn\u2019t help my citizenship because it took another while befo -- when I got out of the service, to\nfind out why I didn\u2019t get my citizenship. And of course they gave me some kind of limp excuse\nthat I -- they were investigating me and so on that if I had any communist affiliations. So I was\nlaughing because at 16 how could I have communist affiliations? Nevertheless I -- I did get my\ncitizenship right after that.",
        "A: In the service I was stationed in Fort Lee, Virginia, and oddly enough I was there for a whole\ntwo years. I was in the food service, and as a matter of fact, my job there was rather good. I had\nan aba -- first year I had different jobs. I was an -- I worked as a cook for a very short time and --\nand after that I went -- they send me to -- for a short time to a meat plant, to a -- where they were\nprocessing the meat for -- for the post. But I was there also, a very short time. Then I -- the most\nof the time I was in a -- assigned to the officers\u2019 club, which I had a very good assignment, I was\nthe buyer for the -- I used to buy the meat there, and -- for the club and issue it to the kitchen.\nAnd so tha --",
        "A: I would issue the meat to the kitchen.",
        "A: A-And the officers\u2019 club. I was a -- prepared it for them and so on. So I had a very nice ga --\nactually it was a very nice job, I was completely on my own and they liked the job I was doing\nso they wouldn\u2019t release me to go elsewhere. And as a matter of fact one time I had a run in one\nof the lieutenants there, so I was lucky enough, I was -- got myself an order to go to\n[indecipherable] headquarters in Paris, and he wouldn\u2019t release me, so I stayed there for the\nwhole time. But after that things were rather good. So I really had a very nice job. It was like\ngoing to a civilian job every day that I had my own car there and I lived there f -- I was there like\nfor a -- a whole two years. And on weekends I was able to go to Richmond, and I would go\nsometime to a -- a Jewish dance or something of -- different things like this. And we would --\nactually, was a very good -- a good two years, cause I got to be in the service.",
        "A: I had no problem at all with that. I -- you know, I just -- see, I never emphasized or made a\nbig issue of being Jewish. I never had a problem [indecipherable] in Europe when I worked with\nother people, I -- I used to just act normal and I -- I never encountered any -- any prejudices or\nany problems with that. And in fact in the -- in the -- this particular section in the officers\u2019 club, I\nwas the only Jewish person there. Oh wait, there was another Jewish fellow there for awhile\nfrom Brooklyn, but he -- nobody liked him and eventually, you know, he left from there. But it\nwasn\u2019t because he was Jewish, he was just not exactly a nice guy. And so I really didn't -- didn\u2019t\nexperience any bad like -- you know, bad times because I was Jewish. And after that, in \u00b052, I --\nI had plans to move to California finally, just --",
        "A: In \u201954, I should say, I came out of the service.",
        "A: I was corporal.",
        "A: Oh, while I was in the service, too, they gave me a choice to go to a linguist school in\nMonterey, California, which --",
        "A: A linguist.",
        "A: A ling -- ling -- linguist school.",
        "A: And -- but at that time, which I was really, I wanted to do, I even took the tests, let\u2019s see in\nRussian, Hungarian and Czech and they -- I passed them and they wanted to send me to -- more\nfor Russian, and I -- it sounded very tempting but they asked me -- they had -- I had to sign up\nfor an extra year of service, which with hindsight I made a big mistake not taking it because the\nextra year I would have been in school anyway, a whole year. And -- but alrea -- I was already at\nthe time 24 -- yeah, was 24 - 20 fi -- going on 25 and I figured an extra year would make me a\nyear older when I came out of the service, instead of 26 I would be 27 and I just made a choice\nnot to take it. And that was a mistake on my part because I could have gotten -- they gave you a\nfour year college credit course in one year, really what it was. So that was one of my mistakes.\nAnyway, I s -- when I got out of the service, I had decided that I\u2019m not going to help my brother-\nin-law in the store, I\u2019m not going to get tied up again, I\u2019m going to go straight to California,\nbecause I always wanted to move to California. And as it -- lo and behold, my brother-in-law\nwas short handed as usual in the business, and because I felt obligated with my sister and him, I\nstarted helping and before you know it, I s-stayed -- I stayed here and --",
        "A: No, he always had -- he -- he\u2019s operated a small business and he was not forward-looking\nenough that he would expand or get more help. So --",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: Well, he felt I was more capable because by that time he took over another store from one of\nhis brothers and the store didn\u2019t do so good, so I -- he felt that I could build it up. So one thing\nled to another, before you know it, I ended up buying the store from him, because it --",
        "A: I didn\u2019t, I was paying them off in small amounts and he was pretty generous -- not that the\nstore was worth much, because the store really was not producing enough income, but --",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: Yes, I -- I -- what I did, I was very good at the time, I was rather capable of taking a store that\nwas run down and -- and built 1t up, more-so than a -- somebody else.",
        "A: Well, I sor -- I just hustled, you know, I still just --",
        "A: -- I worked harder and I merchandised, I tried to give good service and whatever. And so\nwhenever I ran the store, things were running smoother than if somebody else ran it. And -- and\neventually my brother-in-law saw -- he sort of talked -- not talked me into it, but he -- they told\nhim it will be a favor and they turned over the store to me, in a sense. And I was --",
        "A: Not --",
        "A: Well, they were -- they were getting rid of it but they were actually think -- it -- it\u2019s very hard\nto say because their mentality was geared in certain -- it\u2019s very hard to understand that. I would\nnot accuse them of not -- of doing it to get rid of it or to -- or -- or for ulterior motives, because\nthey really -- you know, my sister had the best interest for m -- for me. And my brother-in-law\ntoo was the -- he was not a shady guy, it was straight. And I think in their own mind they thought\nthey were doing me a favor, okay. But what was happening 1s that the store was just not a place\nthat you could build it up too much. I would improve it, but I would not get where I could make\na good living out of it. In the meantime -- oh yes, in \u201956 -- \u201957 I got married, and then I realized -\n- not then, I -- I realized before that I have to make a little more of a living, so I worked hard and\nI tried to make a living and I barely scraped a living out of it. It was not a moneymaking\nproposition. Well, while I was there, somehow or another I -- by that time I saved some money --\noh, in the meantime [indecipherable] the money that I got -- that I saved, even though I was\nmaking very little in the beginning, I saved money from a he -- you know, on a regular basis, but\nI had -- in 1947 we discovered I had a brother that was in a prison in Russia. We found out that\nhe was alive, so this was a -- th -- actually the Russians kept him two years after the war was\nover as a prisoner, and they accused him of being a German, so they kept him with the German\nprisoners. They didn\u2019t believe that he was Jewish. So when he came home, they found out he\nwas alive, so a lot of the money that I saved, I spend a lot of money on he -- oh, he made his way\nto Czechoslovakia, because I had another -- a brother living in Czechoslovakia as well, another\nbrother, Mandel. He lived in the Liberez and somehow when my brother came back from Russia,\nhe found a few Jewish people that were -- remained there alone. One man who -- where -- where\nmy brother lived in Czechoslovakia. Sorry. [tape break]",
        "A: Right, so my brother [indecipherable] spent all those years in Russia. He came -- somehow he\nmade his way to Czechoslovakia, to Liberez, where my brother Mandel lived at the time. And\nnaturally, he didn\u2019t have anything, so -- I was so happy that he was alive that I was willing to\nshare everything that I had. In the meantime my brother Mandel\u2019s wife was also very sick, she\nhad some kind of bone disease. And at that time they just came out with streptomycin. And we\nlived -- actually Carteret was next to Rahway, New Jersey where Merck produced streptomycin.\nAnd you couldn\u2019t even get it on the market, but I got somebody to get me some streptomycin and\nsent it to my sister-in-law. And none of them had money over there, so I tried to help my brother,\nhelp my -- both of my brothers. So I sp -- really spent all of my savings. However, my wi -- I got\nmarried, I lived in an apartment for a short time, like a year, year and a half and I found out that\nit was not really good because we had trouble with the landlord. So I got mad, I figured I would\ndecide -- I decided to buy a house. And at that time ta -- buying a house was not as simple as --\nas it is today because most people couldn\u2019t afford, or didn\u2019t buy a house as quick as today young\npeople do. Things were a la -- a little different. And anyway, I bought the first house and -- so\nthat by that time we had a little -- my daughter, Gail and so we moved into the house and we\nlived in Colonia, New Jersey. I moved out of Carteret because I didn\u2019t like it there, it was a very\nblue collar town and it was a very limited type of town and I wanted my kids to go to a little\nbetter school in a -- in a community that they had better schools, so I moved to Colonia, New\nJersey.",

        "A: Oh, my wife I met in -- actually through a fr-friend, somebody she knew on a blind date,\nactually. And she was from Hillside, New Jersey. And we had a couple of dates and before you\nknow it we were getting married.",
        "A: Yeah, actually I did, you know, oddly enough.",
        "A: Well, there was just a certain connection, I guess, you know, there\u2019s a certain spark or\nsomething. And I liked her immediately. And at first we didn't, somehow or another we didn\u2019t\nclick too much, so I -- for like about three or four months we hardly saw each other, and then\nafter that we started getting together again and all of a sudden I realized that -- that I was in love\nwith her. And before you know it, we got married. It was just that s-simple. But Pll backtrack a\nlittle bit.",
        "A: Yes, my wife is Jewish. Yeah, she was the -- actually, her father had died when she was very\nyoung, so s -- her mother raised -- there were three sisters, you know, so she was the middle one.",
        "A: And [Il backtrack a little bit to Carteret. Carteret was a -- well, where I had my store, was a\nvery simple blue collar town, like I s -- mentioned before, it was a lot of e-ethnic people, some of\nthem were first generation people, but all of them were actually foreigners, they were\nimmigrants. And when I had the store in Carteret I never liked Carteret too much because it was\nvery hickish and blue collar --",
        "A: Very hick.",
        "A: Yeah, hick. And I somehow -- and I didn\u2019t care for it too much because when I first came to\nCarteret I si -- lived there, I must say this, people were not bad by any means, even the Jewish\npeople, but their -- most of the people I found were very condescending, like even when they\nwere -- they really were not interested about what happened during the war, but everybody was\nlike -- like -- almost like you pat a dog, poor kid, and -- and I really remember I didn\u2019t like that. I\ndidn\u2019t want to be pitied, I didn\u2019t want to -- you know. And I remember that made a big\nimpression on me when I was very young, and I was very proud, if you will. And I -- all I\nwanted to be is this -- like everybody else. And that was one of the reasons I moved out of\nCarteret the first chance I had, okay. As a matter of fact, even my sister, my brother-in-law\nespecially, was against me moving out of town, it was what do you mean it\u2019s not good enough?\nAnd all the people in town used to tell me, what are you a big shot, it\u2019s not good enough to live\nhere? And all of a sudden I found, because I was an immigrant, that I had no right to make my\nown decision, that people actually thought -- they would almost think what you\u2019re entitled to,\nyou know. And now that I look back I find it funny, but at the time 1-it was -- it was a big thing.",
        "A: No, no, my sister -- you have to remember my brother-in-law lived -- was already in the\nStates over 40 years when I came.",
        "A: 40.",
        "A: Yeah. My -- this brother-in-law, this mist -- William Lebow. So he had brothers, they were all\nwell established, you know. So they were already part of the scene.",
        "A: So he was -- he was the -- no, he was one of the people, you know, he was highly respected in\ntown, you know, his brothers were respected, they all had businesses.",
        "A: Well, at the time he was -- when he got mar -- right after -- at that time he was about 42 years\nold.",
        "A: [indecipherable] I\u2019m sorry I said he was here 40 years. He was here about 20 - 25 years\nalready at the time.",
        "A: So he wa -- he was in his 40\u2019s.",
        "A: Oh, no, no, no, no, they -- they were all treated right, but you know it was a kind of a -- the\nsituation was different, the society at the time. You had to co -- if you came in from out of town\nyou had to sort of prove to yourself that -- the townspeople thought they had a monopoly on the\ntown, something li -- it\u2019s just a sentimentality. But I was working in the store there -- once I\nowned the store and one of the things that was happening to me is that I was not making a lot of\nmoney, and -- I backtracked a little -- and I was -- it was getting on my nerves, I was not making\na lot of money and I was -- had to deal with a lot of people, they were like Ukrainian or Polish,\nand they\u2019d come in, I spoke their language, you tried to be nice and they would always accuse\nyou of being a cheat because you were Jewish and so on. So there was certain resentment on my\npart with certain accusation on their part. And I wasn\u2019t willing to take that garbage because I\nfigured if they don\u2019t like me, too bad, that\u2019s their problem. And I just wouldn\u2019t ba -- put it\nsimply, my tolerance level was not very high [indecipherable] treated and anti-Semitism. So in\nthe meantime, like I say, I\u2019m -- I -- the money wasn\u2019t there and one day I realized that I came to\nthe United States, I wanted to be an American, I want to act like one, I want to speak like one.\nHere I\u2019m spending most of the time with people that don\u2019t speak English and they are illiterate\nor -- or very poorly educated and I spend every day with these people and all of a sudden I found\nout that was not what I wanted. So I got very mad one day -- this is after spending there seven,\neight years, to my regret, I got mad and I said I\u2019m going to close the store, I\u2019m going to move to\nCalifornia this time to --",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: No, I was married, but by that time already my daughter was, let\u2019s see, must have been about\nfour years old. And by that time I had a son, Jeffrey, which came later, about a year and a half or\n-- yeah, almost two years after my daughter. So, they was both small, Jeffrey must have been like\nabout two years old. And I decided I\u2019ve had it with this and I\u2019m not going to live like I\u2019ve lived\nit -- like if I was in Europe, I want to live in America. So I wanted to get out of this\nneighborhood. Besides, I saw there was no -- no future there. So I picked up and I went to\nCalifornia with my wife and children, and by that time my other brother that had come out from\nRussia was -- also went to Israel with the Haganah from Czechoslovakia. But eventually we\nbrought him out to the United States because it was getting too expensive to upkeep him in\nIsrael, we have to send him money all the time, so we decided to bring him over here. So by that\ntime, that was, I think -- I\u2019m not sure what year it was. But anyway, by that time he was already -\n- we brought him out from Israel to the United States, and -- but he also moved to California\nbecause my sister was there. So he settled in California, so when I decided to move, he was\nalready living there, plus I had my other sister there. And when we got there we tried to get an\napartment, but in the meantime I had left a lot of loose ends here in New Jersey. So -- because I\ndidn\u2019t empt -- empty out a store and so on. So I had to come back, so I left my wife and my\nchildren there, and while I was here settling my affairs, my wife decided she didn\u2019t like it there\nand she came back -- she got -- hopped on a plane and came back. So that was --",
        "A: With the children, right. So --",
        "A: No, and -- right, well we didn\u2019t move per se, you know, we just went physically, ourselves\nyou know.",
        "A: To find an apartment and so on. But our house -- oh yes, in the meantime, the house that I had\nbought, I sold, because I was moving in California, cause I -- I was so sure we were going to stay\nthere. But anyway, at the time my wife was a little emotionally upset and so on, because of sh --\nafter the children, she had a little tough time of it emotionally or mentally. So anyway she -- all\nof a sudden something struck her there, she didn\u2019t like California, so she got on a plane.",
        "A: Yes, she had family here.",
        "A: Her mother lived here, although her -- her relationship with her mother was not great. But her\nsisters lived here -- no, actually one sister lived here at the time, one sister lived in California I\nthink, at the time. And anyway, she got on a plane and she came back with the children. So once\nshe was back, I didn\u2019t have much of a choice. My house was sold and the business was gone, so I\ngot an apartment momentarily and we lived in the apartment for a little while. And then along\ncame -- one of my lawyers that I knew told me there was this small house available, and I\ndecided that a house, it wouldn\u2019t cost me much more than the apartment, even though it was\nsmall.",
        "A: Oh [inaudible]",
        "A: Okay, anyway, so on the spur of the moment, instead of staying in this apartment which we\ndid not like, I decided -- I bought this house, it was a little smaller than I would have liked to, but\nwe could afford it. And it\u2019s what we could afford, so we moved into this small house, in Colonia\nagain. And the children started school over there, and we lived there f -- we intended to live there\nlike a couple years and we -- it turned out we lived there like about 10 - 12 years in this house,\ncause my wife didn\u2019t want to move from there, cause she got so used to it. But in the meantime I\ngot a job as soon as I came back, worked f-for again, a s-small s-supermarket for a shor -- for\nabout couple of years. And then I decided to go back and to -- I found a place and I wanted to\nopen a store. And again this time it was very important for me that I open in an area where you\nhave Americans, that I deal with regular people rather than like back in Europe. So I opened this\nstore in Madison, New Jersey, it was a new store and I struggled there --",
        "A: Ah, yeah.",
        "A: No, it was an independent, actually it was more of a butcher store, okay.",
        "A: I just opened it from scratch, right.",
        "A: I set it up and I opened it, after I worked for this ga -- fellow, Woodbridge for a couple of\nyears. And like I said, this was a new shopping center, and I opened up, but it was a ups --\ncoming community. So I opened the store with a little -- in mind with a little hi -- better caliber\nof customer, and little up -- upscale, and I struggled there for a couple of years, again not making\nmoney. Actually, I was losing money for the first couple of years. But eventually I made it, the\nstore caught on eventually because from the start it got the good reputation. And I sit in this\nparticular store for the next 25 years, while my kids were growing up, I sent them through school\nand so on. So as far as living in general, you know, we tried to live as normal as possible, as any\nAmerican would. But here, for the first time in my life, the customers spoke English, I spoke\nEnglish and I felt like it was -- I arrived in the United States, I didn't have to put up with places\nlike Carteret. So in that respect I -- 1-it\u2019s sort of like my dream, I guess, of living as an American\ncame true.",
        "A: Well, 1-1t -- it was tough, I\u2019m sure it was not any tougher than anybody -- but hindsight it\ndoesn\u2019t seem so tough. At the time I -- I -- I remember, because one of the biggest problem was -\n- again, it\u2019s very hard to compare it to -- to 1999 or 2000, is because the amount of money people\nare making is -- was just entirely different level, you know, it was --- it was true everything was -\n-a-- alot of things were less expensive, but it was very hard to make -- make money and keep\nit, because things -- things were difficult, especially like in my case, you know, I\u2019m sure that\nthere were a lot of people, i-immigrants like myself had the same problem, nobody helped you\nperiod, whether it -- but -- which was okay because I wanted to be self reliant. However, 1n some\ncases people come, they get big wedding gifts, or they get a start here, they gotta push there.\nLike I had a friend, he was complaining about his father-in-law [indecipherable], but he would\nbuy him carpeting for the house, or -- or buy him a garage, or whatever, were -- were -- or -- or\nturned over the business to him, whatever, I didn\u2019t have that. So it was 1-in a sense struggle. On\nthe other hand, why should I look for some -- someone else to give it to me, you know, it\u2019s\nsimple as -- as far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s okay. But it was tough, because the amount of money\nyou made or you\u2019ve been able to keep was very difficult. And in that respect, I guess it was\ntough, but I imagine that most people had -- didn\u2019t have it much different.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well again, I was in the store and we -- I was there like 25 years and the real estate -- the\nshopping center was sold to another company and the first thing the new company came in, they\ntook over, they wanted to triple my rent, which I could -- definitely could not afford. And by\nnow the business also was suffering, cause I was in the meat business and the cholesterol thing\ncame on very quickly, very strong, and all of a sudden the demand, plus the competition was just\ntoo much to -- to absorb, because the demand just dropped, and -- while the competition was\nincreasing. I was in an area, it was a very competitive area. There was like four or five\nsupermarkets within a couple of miles of me. But for the longest time I held out, but with a\nreduction of meat consumption, it was going down. So then when the new landlord came in, and\nhe demanded almost triple rent, plus extra added expenses, I just felt I couldn\u2019t afford to stay\nthere. So I retired prematurely; I really wanted to stay in business another four or five years. And\n-- so once -- which worried me, because I didn\u2019t think I could afford it economically. But\nsomehow or another, once I saw that I had to go, I made the best of it and so far so good.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well --",
        "A: -- I thought I would have a problem with that. As it turns out I don\u2019t have a -- I -- I adjusted\nvery easily. I amazed myself. I will say -- after I retired, I did, when I got out of business, I did\ngo part time. I worked for a supermarket in New Jersey for -- periodically. And when I didn\u2019t\nwork there I worked someplace else, couple of -- two or three days a week or so, and now that I\nmoved here actually, I\u2019m also doing -- basically still doing the same thing, I\u2019m working a little\nbit, part time and then I volunteer and I do things. I\u2019m not bored.",

        "A: Well, I find them, really --",
        "A: -- most of the time. Because when I came here I -- it took a long -- I did some of it in New\nJersey, but when I came here I didn't know the area, I didn\u2019t know where to start. So it\u2019s a little -\n- I didn\u2019t depend on it too much. So I started working actually one day in Katz\u2019s. Here I walked\nin one day and he asked me if I could help him out, I got to talk to him. And I started helping\nhim out, I\u2019m still there.",
        "A: Katz\u2019s market in -- a kosher market. So I\u2019m there -- whenever I want to work, I ge -- he and I\nhave an arrangement, when I -- if I want to work, I work and if I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t.",

        "A: -- do service. So I put in like three days a week on average, two or three days a week. And\nwhat\u2019s nice about it, I -- I am not committed where I have to, you know, I -- I work -- whenever\nI\u2019m free, I work. So this way I could do what I want to do, still I work a little bit.",
        "A: I volunteer in the Holocaust Museum.",
        "A: What happened 1s that I had -- in the beginning when I first moved here I had a hard time to\neven go into the museum, by the way, it took me like two or three years prior to -- that I went in.\nIt took me three years just to get in the door. But when I moved here, I kept on meeting people\nand they were telling me -- and once I walked into the museum, I realized that once I broke the\nbarrier and I was able to walk in there that I would like to volunteer. Because I was thinking\nprior to this to volunteer in other museum, like in the Smithsonian. But when I got familiar with\nthe Holocaust Museum, I decided to volunteer there.",
        "A: Well, I figured that just for the sake of enlightening, like people that come in or whatever, to\nmake them understand certain things what they saw, something like that, something\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: Oh, they\u2019Il un-understand, instead of just seeing pictures, or just seeing -- to give them a little\nmore meaning to it if -- if -- if I had the chance that -- to understand. Cause sometime you look at\npictures or you read something, it\u2019s one thing, but then sometime when another person sort of\nco-conveys a little explanation to you, maybe you got a little better insight of it.",
        "A: Well, like understanding.",
        "A: Well, I want them to take away more or less the -- how precarious freedom can be. Basically,\nthis is the way I see things, that 1f you don\u2019t know what dangers lie, you\u2019re not careful to protect\nwhat you have. If you -- th-that freedom is something you don\u2019t take for granted. That -- it\u2019s\nsomething that you have to you know, that you have to be aware of what\u2019s out there and not to\nallow yourself to be caught in it, basically.",
        "A: Well, this past two years, actually, I was taking young kids through the \u201cDaniel\u2019s Story,\u201d\nokay. N-Now this year I\u2019m going to go and -- in fact they\u2019re going to have a training course for\nolder kids, like in the permanent museum. So I\u2019m gonna volunteer in there, I think, also.",
        "A: Yeah, it -- it -- it --",
        "A: -- yeah, explain it, you know --",
        "A: -- like in the \u201cDaniel\u2019s Story,\u201d it\u2019s for the younger children, that\u2019s four to seven graders. So\nwe take them through and we explain to them, we try to give them a certain understanding at\ntheir level. And oddly enough, in some cases I think it does a lot of good, you know.",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "A: Right, right --",
        "A: -- right. And I -- and I\u2019ve also seen, from different aspects -- in fact, my daughter is on the\nboard of -- in the ADL and I\u2019ve ga -- and they have programs that are also sometimes in\nconjunction with the museum. And they started a program, they train teachers, the Catholic\ndiocese of the Washington area. And I\u2019ve seen what they did -- what they\u2019re doing in the\nCatholic schools is just phenomenal. And I -- I feel that when you get it out there, if you got\npeople that cooperate and they educate and they give them exposure that you get these kids that\nmake -- grow up to be anti -- very big anti-Semites, that they get it from education of certain --\nthey get certain information that I may -- they will not get at home, but they get it in the school,\nlike in the Catholic school an -- at that, that each time you in -- you inject people like this with a\nlittle knowledge, that sooner or later it helps someplace else as they grow up. You know what\u2019s -\n- even if they have a background of anti-Semitism, they already -- they got it in their own school,\nthrough good teachers, which I\u2019ve seen some of them are very, very capable. So this is the kind\nof stuff, that\u2019s one of the reasons I feel that it\u2019s very important to reach them. And a lot of the\nkids we get in the museum, many times you think of Jewish kids, actually we get kids from\nCarolinas, from Oklahoma and from that -- kids that never heard of Jews, or -- or never had any -\n- you know. So this way it gives them, instead of thinking of a Jew as a Jew, they think of Jew as\nperson that went through a bad experience. And -- and maybe some of them will understand\nsome of it. So in that respect I think it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a very good thing.",
        "A: Oh yeah, I forgot, okay, I do that too, right, okay.",
        "A: Well, in there I -- I speak before groups, every so often, just about my experience, basically.\n[-It\u2019s geared mostly to an individual\u2019s experience.",
        "A: Well, at this age it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s a -- each time it\u2019s a little difficult because it\u2019s very emotional.\nBut in the same time I feel that again, if people hear it, if somebody comes up with denials and\nthey hear it from somebody like me that I went through it, all of a sudden th-they -- when a -- a\ndenier denies, they may not buy it. And then -- so in that respect I think it\u2019s -- as a matter of fact,\njust recently I spoke to the -- in the museum itself, and we had a full hou -- the whole theater was\nfull, actually standing room only. And I could not believe the amount of people that came --\ncame up to me and they were just, you know, genuinely touched and -- and they were [phone\nringing| Excuse me.",
        "A: Oh yes, and it -- it was very, you know, I don\u2019t know, how can I put it? I -- I was very\nsurprised and -- because people came up and they actually [indecipherable] and asked for -- even\nfor an autograph, you know, they were like very taken wi -- and the response was just fantastic.\nAnd you have to remember, most of these people -- not most -- if not all of them were -- like\nprobably 90 percent of them were not Jewish, you know, and they wanted. So when you see it\nmakes an impact like that it gives you an idea that it -- it\u2019s the thing to do, you know, to -- to\nmake -- because th -- fa -- just for no other reason, just the fact that this way they could say gee, I\nmet someone, so who 1s this guy denying that this happened when it did happen. I met someone\nthat did.",
        "A: So that respect I think it -- it serves a big purpose.",
        "A: Well, a-at this stage 1-it\u2019s still -- every time I give an interview 1-1t\u2019s still difficult for some\nreason. Certain areas you just get very emotional. But the only reason I did it is because\neverybody says it\u2019s important for -- for the history, so when I was in California a few years ago,\nI -- you know, I did it because some -- for the same reason, and the same reason here. And I just\nfeel that if there\u2019s enough information out there that the deniers will have less chance of denying,\nbasically.",
        "A: For me it was like probably the nicest thing that ever happened to me. ... When my daughter\nwas born, I -- it actually changed my life and gave me more purpose if anything, and it was just\none of the nicest things probably in my whole entire life. And -- and then of course my son came,\nso it, you know, iv -- 1t was just -- I enjoyed my kids from the time they were born. I -- I could\nhonestly say that. I\u2019m very fortunate in that regard. As a matter of fact, yesterday was our\nanniversary, our 44\" anniversary. So my daughter made dinner and I can honestly say -- she is\nlike 40 -- 42 years old, I think, and I had nothing but pleasure from her, so -- and now she has\ntwo children and it -- it\u2019s like I\u2019m getting it all over again, so it\u2019s really very, very nice. Now, my\nson got married and he -- he\u2019s also married a very nice woman and she 1s like -- like my\ndaughter. And they have a -- a little boy now, Joshua. And so in that regard I think that between\nmy children, my grandchildren, it\u2019s probably the crowning of my life, if you will.",
        "A: Yes, five years ago.",
        "A: Well, once I ga -- gave up the store, it was a matter of -- of I could not live where I was,\nbecause I liked it there too, but it was a matter of moving into a senior citizen complex or Florida\nor whatever. And then I realized that I would rather live near my daughter so I could watch my\ngrandchildren grow up. So that was a easy decision, and it was a good decision because I really -\n- and I didn't want to go out and live in a senior citizen complex because I really didn\u2019t want to\ngo out to pasture, I want to live among the living, that life goes on. And so basically I got what I\nwanted, you -- you know. So I -- I really made the right decision, as far as I\u2019m concerned.",
        "A: Yes, I, as far as religion, I guess I\u2019m not what I would call religious, per se. I\u2019m more\nnonsectarian if you will, in some respects. Yet, Iam very Jewish , or I did [indecipherable] I wou\n-- did grow up, it seemed like when I -- where I grew up, everybody was Orthodox and\neverybody was observant, period. There it was a given, you were Jewish, you were brought up\nsomewhat -- most people were -- were Orthodox and -- and observant, especially in our town,\nbut most people were. In the city you found some people that were maybe wavering a little bit.\nBut I have to ad -- say, we got in -- when we got into a concentration camp, I remember the first\nholiday right a -- we came -- actually, we came to Mauthausen from Auschwitz, and I remember\nwe were in Mauthausen, this was like about a week after Auschwitz actually, a week or te -- to\ntwo weeks after Auschwitz, and it was [indecipherable] because -- I remember that. And my\nfather, my uncle, and whoever, you know, the oldest got together in a huddle and tried to say the\nprayers as much as -- most of them knew it by heart. And somehow [indecipherable] right there\nand then, I sort of like couldn\u2019t fake it, I just -- I just -- I just couldn\u2019t see it, because of what\nhappened. And from there on in I was not religious. I literally, in the beginning, I guess it used to\nbother me, but after awhile you just learn to live with it and I -- I just never got -- I never thought\nof religion as -- as an important part of my life, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. And when I lived in\nCzechoslovakia for a short time after the war, there was no o-organized synagogue or anything\nthat I recall a-at the time, and the government or the -- basically the whole population in general\nin Czechoslovakia was not exactly a religious type of country like in some countries. And\nwherever you went, on papers you have to fill out, we put out atheist fa -- because it was easier.\nIf you put on -- like in Europe you have to put on Jewish, or religion on a -- on application. And\nwe chose atheist for one simple reason, because if some clerk would get ahold of your paper, if\nyou said Jewish he probably wouldn\u2019t pass it. If it was atheist he would pass it, whatever. And --",
        "A: Like in general -- ge -- a lot of Jewish people in we --",
        "A: -- yeah, wa -- like a lot of Jewish in general. And it was -- religion was not part of your daily\nlife. And -- and then, of course, when I came to the United States I had to work Saturday right\nfrom the start and it so -- it so --",
        "A: Oh no, no, no. You mean here in the United States?",
        "A: No, no, I never worked -- no, this was a non-kosher business. I never worked in a kosher\nstore.",
        "A: Yeah. No, this was my brother-in-law had a non-kosher --",
        "A: -- it was a -- a regular store.",
        "A: He worked on Saturdays. And my brother-in-law [indecipherable] was really very agnostic,\nhe -- he just was not into religion. He was very smart, very well read person, but he was not\nreligious. But he was also very well learned in religion that -- the funniest thing, cause it was --\nhe was -- he went to Yeshiva and all that. But he -- he was definitely not religious. As a matter of\nfact he was -- and I have to admit, I sort of went along the same -- same route, because I worked\nSaturdays. And religion to me wasn\u2019t something that I had a need for, and I still don\u2019t\n[indecipherable]. So I\u2019m -- I -- I -- now I go to services and I do go because of my grandchildren\nand I want to belong, so I sort of -- but I\u2019m not a very religious person, per se. However I live, I\nthink in life I practice most of the Jewish teachings or -- or live my life as -- as a Jew. I never\ndenied being Jewish. I never went around with a thing on the lapel like some people to -- to\nprove that I\u2019m Jewish, I don\u2019t have to prove anything. So I never had that -- but o-otherwise my\nthinking is also more on a nonsectarian level in some respects, like politically I -- I am liberal, I\nguess you would say, politically. But I am conservative maybe in some areas, you know, and I\nguess Jews may be, okay. So I\u2019m not exactly -- but some -- but religion really doesn\u2019t play, or\nnever played a big part in my life. In other words, I looked at religion more of a -- as a crutch\nwoulds -- like someone -- I see some people do and I didn\u2019t want crutches. So this is my way of\nexplaining it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Well, I -- I feel good about it, however, I have a little problem with it. I -- I like the idea that\nhe was chosen, and I respect him, definitely, because I think he\u2019s a capable guy, not because he\u2019s\nJewish necessarily, but he has a certain -- he has a good character. But I think they overplayed a\nlittle too much, they made a -- a lot to -- too much to do with -- the press in particular, about him\nbeing Jewish. And I think sometimes the Jewish community made a big thing to know about him\nbeing Jewish. And I have a think on this that all things considered, that he\u2019s Jewish, we know\nthis and a -- but he is -- more, he is running as a citizen of the United States, not as a Jew, so they\nshouldn\u2019t make such a big issue of him being Jewish. In other words it shouldn\u2019t be -- like if this\nwas in 1900 and they were making a big to-do about him being Jewish, it\u2019s one thing, but you\u2019re\ntalking about 2000, where I think the citizens should be -- he\u2019s a citizen of the United States. So\nhe -- is he running as a Jew, or 1s he running as a citizen? And I think they\u2019re making too much\nof it, the fact that he is Jewish. And I have to admit, I have mixed feelings because when Jimmy\nCarter ran, one thing I didn\u2019t like about him 1s because of his religion, because he was a born\nagain. And I thought that was -- like it clouded his thinking in terms of decision making, or\nwhatever. So I should apply the same thing to hi -- to Lieberman. However, whether it\u2019s my own\nprejudice or what, I think Lieberman is more based -- how can I put it? Grounded, if you will,\nand Jimmy Carter was more emotionally born again, but -- where Lieberman is more of a -- has a\ngood character, plus he is jew -- he is Orthodox. So maybe there 1s a difference in how I see it,\nokay? But I don\u2019t like when they stress the Jewish part to the point where they already did.\n[inaudible]",
        "A: Yes, I saw both of them.",
        "A: Well, I -- I -- I really thought they were both very good. \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d of course, was in a\ndifferent -- on a different level. I think \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d I think was fantastic, and it didn\u2019t color\nanything, it gave it a picture from the raw, like -- like it -- not that I was in the same place or had\nthe same experience, but it was -- 1-1t was rather -- rather well done in the sense to give the\nportrayal of -- of what\u2019s -- how things were at the time, or how a soldier behaved, or how -- you\nknow, different things. As far as the Schindler story itself, Pll be honest with you, I never heard\nof it before the movie came about, I never heard of this. So from my vantage point I never\nbelieved something like this could happen in -- in reality. Evidently it did, so I -- you know, for\nme it was a -- you know, something almost hard to believe on the beginning, you know, until it\nwas well documented, that there was a German that was -- that would do something like he did.\nBut the movie itself, the portrayal and the circumstances of the inmates and th -- and -- versus\nthe officer and the -- and the part and so on.

I -- I thought it was just very clever and in spite of they tried to make other movies\nsomething similar, I don\u2019t think they came even close. This -- this one here I think was very\nunique for this type of movie.",

        "A: I -- I saw it awhile ago, so I don\u2019t remember exactly.

I think it has a certain satire that -- that was very\nilluminating as -- to some extent, sort of on a human nature, of a psyche, whatever, you know.

You know, it -- it tried to take on\nthat -- that Germanic mantle, if you will. In -- in the -- Hungary it\u2019s very similar in the -- in the\nclass system and so on. Which I was viol [indecipherable] always very violently opposed to, you\nknow, from my point of view. And --",
        "A: Opposed to that Hungarian Jewish mentality, you know.",
        "A: And one of the reasons that I thought it was good is because of the -- it deals with the subject\nof assimilation and a lot of Hungarian Jews were -- because of you did have a class system on\nHungary, and so everybody tried to make sure they act like they were very fancy, or very uppity.\nAnd I remember even as a kid I used to find it very, very bothersome to me. And when I saw\nHungarian, a lot of Hungarian Jews, not all, a lot of Hungarian Jews, even during the war, a lot\nof the Hungarians were -- punished them because they were Jewish, and they were doing things\nto them that they were Jewish. They would always [indecipherable] breast that they\u2019re royal\nHungarians, okay, and I found that very, very disgusting to -- 1f you will. If somebody beats me\nI\u2019m not going to say I love you, you know. And basically this deals with that type of subject, you\nknow, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a very -- you have to understand that, the -- like in the context, you know. And I\nfound it very amusing that somebody had enough sense to make a movie like that. And that\u2019s\nabout as closest to what I think, the way I understood things, that -- that -- you know, this shows\nit for what it is. That if you are persecuted and somebody berates you because you\u2019re Jewish,\nyou don\u2019t join them and become one of them because he doesn\u2019t like you to be Jewish. Instead\nyou tell him to go to hell, you know, where I come from, you know. In fact during -- even in the\ncamps, I -- I recall, a lot of the Polish Jews -- like we always had markings where we came from.\nLike I -- even though I was from Czechoslovakia [indecipherable] we were taken to camp, but\nfrom Hungary. We were not from Czechoslovakia. So we had a mark that we came from\nHungary, a U for Ungar. And the Polish Jews used to hate Hungarian Jews, okay, and one of the\nreasons was, believe it or not, for that reason. And I was [indecipherable] when I lived among\nthe Hungarian Jews and I moved -- and I went from Hungary, I was -- lived on Hungary. But I\nhad the same resentment to them, for that reason, because they always insisted what good\nHungarians they were. And me, as a Jew, I don\u2019t care where I am, if a -- a Ukrainian doesn\u2019t like\nme, I\u2019m not going to say I love you, I\u2019ll hate him back. So, you know, that\u2019s my take on it, for\nwhat it\u2019s worth.",
        "A: Yes, it was very good portrayal, a really [indecipherable] very good. It tells like of three\ngenerations, and could have had some different ways that I saw things, but nevertheless it -- it\nreally hit the mark. I thought 1t was very good.",

I used to go to\nnight school, I used to ask, and I could never understand it. But all things considered, that things\nhave improved, and they\u2019re improving constantly with civil rights. So I really think I\u2019m fortunate\nthat I\u2019m here. And I think probably most people that came from Europe the time I came would\nprobably -- probably endorse that. And that is going to be all that I have to say. I think it\u2019s -- and\nlife is good if you -- as long as you stay healthy.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nConclusion of Interview\n"
