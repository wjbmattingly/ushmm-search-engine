        "Q: So where--where did you sleep?",
        "Q: Were you able to move around the ship freely, or were you confined to a space?",
        "Q: But had you had more clothing, would you have been able--would you have been\nallowed to move around the boat, or were you restricted?",
        "Q: Okay. So you're on the boat for three months. You said that you went to a lot of\ndifferent countries or different places. So where do you remember that you stopped?",
        "Q: Baguette?",
        "Q: They told you--the French told you to stay on the ship.",
        "Q: Did you see the French people or interact with them, or did you just hear about it?",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Now, after you are in France, where was the next stop?",
        "Q: Okay. So how--so when you were in France, before y'all left to go back to Hamburg,\ndid any of you think about trying to get off the boat, or did you think about getting off the\nboat? What were your thoughts?",
        "Q: Did y'all talk about that and make a decision as a group?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: So your thought--did you think if you were going to go back to Palestine, going to\nHamburg was the best idea?",
        "Q: Not very well.",
        "Q: Like a lookout?",
        "Q: Well, Like a guard tower or a --",
        "Q: So this is when you were already back in Hamburg.",
        "Q: So let's back up just a minute. How did it feel when you--you get to the port at\nHamburg?",
        "Q: Did they--did you know where you were going once you got to Hamburg? Did they\nsay where you--",
        "Q: So when you get to Hamburg, what happens when the boat gets to the port?",
        "Q: And did they tell you, when you were coming off the boat, where they were taking\nyou?",
        "Q: And where did you end up going to?",
        "Q: But what was--were you in a DP--or what was the name of the kibbutz or the DP\ncamp? Where were you located?",
        "Q: No. But when you--no, I mean the displaced persons camp. When you--when you get\noff the boat in Hamburg, where do you go in Hamburg?",
        "Q: So were you in a displaced persons camp? Where were you being held? Were you\nallowed--could you leave?",
        "Q: Were you allowed to leave you, or are were you still under--",
        "Q: So how long do you think you were in Hamburg at that time?",
        "Q: And where did you go after that?",
        "Q: So did you go straight from Hamburg back to Palestine?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: So were you in Hamburg the whole time?",
        "Q: And--",
        "Q:--you mentioned before they were teaching you how to do things. Was this in\nHamburg?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So did you--",
        "Q: You were--were you just waiting? You just wanted to wait until you could go back to\nPalestine? Or what were you thinking at the time?",
        "Q: How did you secure passage to Israel the second time?",
        "Q: When you were going back the second time, did you have the confidence that this\ntime you would be allowed in, or were you scared that the same thing would happen?",
        "Q: But--",
        "Q: So you were able to secure legal passage to go back to Palestine--",
        "Q:--in '48.",
        "Q: What was that trip like? Or was the boat similar to the Exodus? Or what were the\ndetails?",
        "Q: This is on the second trip back?",
        "Q: Right. So let's go back. So you were in Hamburg, and this 1s after the Exodus. And\nnow we are in '48.",
        "Q: And so you get on another--a second boat to try to go to Palestine.",
        "Q: So that was what I was asking about. What was that boat like?",
        "Q: So was it like the Exodus in a wooden boat, or was it metal?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: And how did you feel--did you feel confident that this time you were going to get in?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: And did you have enough supplies and food?",
        "Q: Were your brothers on the boat with you?",
        "Q: So you mentioned, though, they helped you get clothes. But did you see them in\nHamburg--",
        "Q:--between trips?",
        "Q: So when you got back to Hamburg--when you come back to Hamburg and you have\nno clothing--",
        "Q:--how--",
        "Q: Oh, a package. Okay.",
        "Q: So you're on this--do you know the name of this boat?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: And on the way--or what--where do you arrive in--in Palestine?",
        "Q: And how did you feel?",
        "Q: And how did you feel about that?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: What did you--what was your job?",
        "Q: Did your brothers emigrate or--",
        "Q: So you--but you came to Israel first.",
        "Q: Well, Palestine at the time--sorry--actually.",
        "Q: And how long were you in Israel?",
        "Q: And why did you come to the United States?",
        "Q: You wish you would have stayed in Israel?",
        "Q: Did you--after the journey on the Exodus, were you--did you stay in touch with people\nthat you had gone through that experience with?",
        "Q: Well, if they were on the Exodus with you, this was the same group of people when\nyou went back to Palestine.",
        "Q: And did you stay in touch with them when you lived in Israel?",
        "Q: And looking at the Exodus experience, sort of as a whole, how did you feel when you\nwere experiencing that as a concentration camp survivor?",
        "Q: But--my question is when--because of what you had experienced in the camps, when\nyou were on the Exodus, did you--how did--I mean how did you feel having this\nexperience, as a Holocaust survivor, after what you had already survived?",
        "Q: Did you think of the British in the same way as you thought of your European captors,\nor what were your feelings on--on the British?",
        "Q: Okay. Are there--are there any other details from that experience and being on the\nboat that you can think of that we haven't covered?",
        "Q: When you went on the kibbutz in Israel--",
        "Q:--were you assigned your own room or bunk or--you know, where were you living?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Any of them from the Exodus?",
        "Q: So you were really with the same group the whole time.",
        "Q: But she was with you on the Exodus and at the kibbutz?",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "Q: What was her name, or what is her name?",
        "Q: Dora Lebovitz.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: And did you talk about your experience?",
        "Q: So you--you--you--actually--you talked about your specific experience on the Exodus.",
        "Q: You--you mean in--in Palestine.",
        "Q: And how--how did you feel about that, as a survivor who had already survived so\nmuch, then participating in fighting?",
        "Q: You were fainting a lot?",
        "Q: Did this happen when you were on the--",
        "Q: Did--",
        "Q: Was there any medical staff, or who helped you when you--",
        "Q: So--but there was no--I mean were there doctors on the boat that helped take care of\nyou, or what was the situation like?",
        "Q: Okay. I think that covers--I'm trying to think if there's anything else that we didn't\ncover because you've already done another oral history where I think we have all the\ninformation. We just didn't get everything about your experience on the Exodus.",
        "Q: Yes, I watched it. But it--but 1t was good that we did this today because the--we didn't\ncover a lot on the Exodus.",
        "Q: In that interview.",
        "Q: So is there anything else you would like to add?",
        "Q: You're sorry that you left Israel. I'll make sure that that makes it in. Well, I appreciate\nyour time. And I'm sure--you know, stay in touch with the museum. But I appreciate\nyou taking the time to cover the history today.",
        "Q: I saw that you had one that you showed in your other oral history. There was a\nphotograph.",
        "Q: Yeah, we have many in the photo archive. So if he ever needs to, to check with the\nmuseum. We definitely have photos of the--of the ship.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: That I don't know. I would--we would have to do the research for you. But, you\nknow, I have not met another Exodus survivor.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: We have your information. Well, I want to thank you again for taking the time. And I\nknow it's a difficult subject matter to--to talk about.",
        "Q: But it's--it's great that we can document it.",
        "Q: Thank you very much. I hope you have a great day.",
