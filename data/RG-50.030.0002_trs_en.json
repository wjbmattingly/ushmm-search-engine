        "Q: I need you to start off by telling me your name, where you were born, what year you\nwere born in, and your name as it was then?",
        "A: All right. My name is Rita Kerner Hilton. I was born in Warsaw in 1926, July 22, 1926. I\nlived in Warsaw until I was six years old, seven years old, and then we moved to my\nmother's hometown Pomortsy. This is near Lodz, exiled city. My grandfather was a\npracticing dentist there and since my mother was a dentist, they decided to practice\ntogether. That's where I lived until the war broke out and the Ghettos and so on.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about your life growing up?",
        "A: When I was a small girl, my parents were doing very well financially. My father was a\nentrepreneur. My mother wasn't working at that time, and we always had a maid. I had a\nnanny when I was small. When we moved into Pomortsy, my grandmother was running\nthe house, but she always had sleep-in help. Since my mother worked in the office, it was\nin the same apartment, I had a babysitter, or whoever it was, a part-time governess who'd\ncome in after school hours and do homework with me and read with me, take me out to\nthe park. So, I had kind of a pampered existence. I went to sleep-away camp. I had a\nbicycle which was, you know, they were expensive. So, I did have a very loving, a very\npampered existence at that time.",
        "Q: Were you particularly religious?",
        "A: No. My grandfather strongly believed in reformed Judaism, which did not exist in Poland\nas such. They never kept a kosher home. We did observe holidays. We observed\nPassover, and he used to go to the synagogue on high holidays, sometimes would take\nme, but it was different. He strongly felt that if there would be a reformed Judaism then\nhe could probably follow it. He could not follow the orthodox, the rabbis teachings, and\nargue with some of them about it.",
        "Q: How integrated were you in the larger community? Were most of your friends Jewish?\nDid you go to a public school?",
        "A: Well, I went to a public school, which was hard to get in, but this was the best -- I'm\ntalking about primary school. We lived in a so-called new section of town, not the Jewish\nsection, a new section of town. There were maybe about few Jewish kids there, mostly\nfrom the prominent families, doctors, lawyers and stuff like this, dentists. And when I\nfirst came, I remember one of those days a kid called me a dirty Jew. I was a big girl, I\nwas in first grade, and I gave a smack to the right and a smack to the left, and I never had\nany problem in that school. When the time came to go to high school, there were three\nhigh schools in town. A girls' school, a boys' school and a German school. This town was\nvery much German. There were a lot settled by the Germans. They were German textile\nmarkets. This was a textile factory town. And they were having every year there were\nless Jewish kids accepted there. You had to pass an exam, and you had to be the top of\nthe top of the top to get into that school. If you couldn't get in, you had to commute to\nLodz, which was a 45 minute ride by street car. You had to go to private school then\nwhich was costly. Well, I got into that school. And again the first few days someone said\nsomething about being a Jew, but the principal of the school, she was very anti-semitic,\nbut she was very fair, and she did not stand for any discrimination. And again, I had no\nproblem. I had a bunch of friends, but little by little, I mean, there was one girl, later on,\nshe was in camp with me, Alena, and we used to fight like cats and dogs, but at the same\ntime we were the only Jewish kids in the same level, Jewish girls on that level. The year\nbefore they accepted I think three or four or five. Our year they accepted three, the\nfollowing year they accepted two. The boys had a harder time in school. There were a\ncouple boys who were sons of prominent doctor and they took his penis and dipped it in\nink, and also there was a doctor upstairs, a friend of my parents, they had a younger kid.\nHe started going to the same school that I did, but they taunted him and he started losing\nclumps of hair from nervousness, and they had to place him in Jewish schools. The\nJewish schools were state schools, but the principals, the teachers, the kids were Jewish,\nand there were two schools. One was the better one, and the other one wasn't so good.\nBut still, in order to get to the high school, if you came from the Polish school, your\nchances of getting into the high school were much better than if you came from the\nJewish school. You know, separated, but equal. And I had, as I said, had not too much\nproblems.",
        "Q: Were there social and cultural activities?",
        "A: At one time I know my mother used to go to all those fancy charity balls, a lot of them.\nAnd I think closer to the war, there were a couple Jewish charity balls. I think she still\nused to go to the Red Cross ball and so on. But there were less social contact. My mother\nhad a friend, a school friend, who was of a German decent, a very, very prominent\nfamily. They owned big factories, and she married a Polish boy. They were patients for\nyears and years and years. They used to socialize, and then closer to the war, that dried\nout. We didn't have those contacts as such.",
        "Q: So, let's talk a little bit about how things started to change. Were you aware of what was\ngoing on in Germany?",
        "A: Oh, yes. My aunt lived in Germany. They came to the States before the war. They knew\nit was coming on. Also, there was a group of Polish people who lived in Germany, never\nhad their German passports. They were never citizens, and in 1937, they all sent them out\nand we used to collect money for them. We used to give them meals and so on, because\nthey were thrown out from Germany without anything. So, we were aware very much of\nwhat was going on. But no one believed it was going to happen, what happened, because\nduring the first World War, the Germans were the better friends than the Russians.\nPeople did not like Russians in this part of Poland. So, we were aware, but we never\nthought they would destroy us all.",
        "Q: What happened when the Germans occupied your town?",
        "A: One of the first actions they put a bunch of restrictions. We couldn't use the street cars.\nWe couldn't use the cafe downstairs where everybody used to sit. No Jews were allowed\nthere. We couldn't go to the park. Schools were closed. I don't know when they told us to\nwear the -- before the stars, I think we had to wear the yellow armbands. There were\nscenes downstairs, I see through the window that they would grab a Jew witha \u2014_\u2014_ and\ncut the and cut the beard. And usually it was young kids doing it. The Hitler\nYouth were like a bunch of little puppies jumping on. This was the beginning. Then they\nstarted -- see we knew we would not be able to stay in the apartment. This was a fancy\nsection of town, and it was a very large apartment. What has happened was a crazy\nsituation and part of the apartment someone sublet it, it was a subleased to people who\nowned the cafe downstairs. They were German Nationals. And they requested that\nsection. So, we managed to get some furniture out because we were evacuated not by the\nGermans, but by this owner of the restaurant, the cafe. So, my mother got out some of her\nextra, one extra chair and a foot drill and some equipment and we got some furniture\nfrom that part of the apartment out, and we have hidden it. Some Pole took it for us. And\nwe did manage to get some valuables out, which eventually we left with the Poles. We\nnever saw it again. But at that time we -- and we kind of waited, when they are going to\nkick us out. And sure enough, the order came in 24 hours we had to leave beddings for 12\nbeds, all the china, all the furniture, all the equipment in the office. Everything had to be\nleft. We were allowed only to take our personal clothing. That's when we moved. That\nPole he promised us it would be out of town, a little suburban area, very quiet. Nothing\nwill happen to us, and then he -- the Jews were not allowed to have money, \"X\" amount\nof German marks, no gold, no silver, no diamonds, and when they started talking about\nforming the Ghetto in he persuaded my grandfather that he's going to save\nfor safekeeping, he'll take all his valuables. And Grandfather had all his money in a gold\nmoney belt. His total life savings were in those gold coins. American dollars, British\nsterling pounds, everything in gold. So, he left it with the Pole, and after the Ghetto was\nformed, we couldn't get out, but we sent someone to pick it up, and he denied that he had\never had it. We never saw that stuff again.",
        "Q: Did that surprise you?",
        "A: At that time, yes. At that time, he was so -- seemed like my father knew him and we\nknew him. We stayed with him. We paid rent, but we stayed with him for a couple of\nmonths. There was also a situation where we wanted to go to Warsaw. My mother\ndecided to smuggle herself, smugglers and go to Warsaw. She had some fabrics she felt\nshe'll take it to Warsaw and sell it maybe live on it for a while. Our relatives in Warsaw\nwanted ut to move there. They felt that this was not German, this was the protector at this\npart of Poland at that time. So, she went. She had a fur coat, and covered in fabric and\nwent and was stopped somewhere and all the smuggled goods were taken away. We\ndidn't know what happened, but they let them out. This was a put up. They just wanted to\nget the goods. So, a few days later she came home, luckily for us.",
        "Q: Now, I'd like to get a sense of the mood when the Germans came in. Were people fearful?\nWere people being abused?",
        "A: No. The fear was when we were all running to Lodz before the Germans came. I don't\nthink people were so fearful. It's hard to say how they felt. We all didn't know what\nwould happen. By 11th of November, this is a Polish holiday, and just before they\narrested all the prominent people in town, not only Jews, they arrested Poles, they\narrested anyone, teachers, lawyers, bankers, whoever had any prominence so they\ncouldn't start any uprising. They wouldn't stir the population against the Germans. And\nwe never saw them again. Some of the Poles were let out. Some Poles were let out, but --",
        "Q: You don't know what happened?",
        "A: No. And then, as I said, it was winter, I think it was March, maybe February, when the\nGhetto was formed, the Ghetto.",
        "Q: 1940?",
        "A: Yes. And we didn't have a place to go. There was my grandmother's sister. She had a\nthree or four bedroom apartment. By that time, there were two other families living in\npart of that apartment and we wound up in a little room. Some other relatives were there.\nIt was just bedlam. Finally, we found out that there was a little house that belonged to a\npharmacist, a Polish pharmacist, and they told he has to get out of his apartment. So, we\nshared that apartment with a few other families, and that's where Mom opened up the\noffice, reopened her office. This was an open Ghetto. There were no wires, no barbed\nwires, just check points. Jewish police were watching it. The Poles and the Germans\nwould come into the Ghetto. If they didn't know you, you could get out. I had a friend\nwho would go out, but no one knew him in town. But I couldn't get out because they\nknew me, and I could never step my foot out, outside. The Ghetto was on two sides of\nthat little section. There was a main street going through with the street cars, so we had\ncertain hours we could walk through, walk across the main street. You could walk across\nin the morning. You could cross 1n the afternoon. Once you went on the one side, you\ncouldn't go back until the hour came that you could do it. They formed a factory. They\nstarted having German army coats made, and money was coming in. There were various\npeople who were in charge of the Ghetto, and there was one so-called revolution after\nanother one. One group would kick them out and get other ones, with the help of the\nGermans. Personally, our family, my mother was having a lot of patients. There were no\nPolish dentists in town, so her patients would come in.",
        "Q: Polish people?",
        "A: Polish people. We had access to food. We had access to a lot of things. She was making\nmoney, and she was helping the whole family. She had aunts and uncles and she was\nsupporting everybody at that time. I worked with my grandfather in an outpatient clinic.",
        "Q: This was a dental clinic?",
        "A: No. Grandfather before he became a dentist, he was something you called a feltcher (ph).\nIt's almost like a medic. My grandfather was doing it. My grandfather was doing it. So,\nhe was very well educated in medicine basically. Never became a doctor. And there was\na need for an outpatient clinic, so this was free of charge. He opened it up under the\nhospital of the Jewish government, and I worked with him. The afternoons I had tutors,\nand my mother was very anxious for me to finish my -- somehow not to lose my years of\neducation, so in the afternoon I had a tutor and was doing the high school program as\nmuch as we could, but at least I had somewhat. I wasn't left completely wild.",
        "Q: Tell me about the organization of the Ghetto. Who was preventing you from coming and\ngoing?",
        "A: There was a so-called Jewish , originally there was one lawyer in charge of\nit. There was a bunch of people who took over, and there were all kinds of unsavory\nthings. Unsavory in terms of there were rations coming in, the food was coming in, and I\nthink they were selling it in the Black Market. There was another group denounced them.\nEventually they were arrested and some of them were hanged later in Lodz Ghetto. There\nwas a Jewish police, but they were strictly order police. I don't think they wore hats. They\njust wore arm bands. They were watching all the end streets of the Ghetto and the\ncrossing streets. We had a whole little government which was running with the\nunderstanding of the Germans and they were dealing with the Germans. The food and\neverything else was going through that group.",
        "Q: This group was corrupt?",
        "A: The first one, yes. I mean, I wouldn't say the first one. That one lawyer was not, but the\ngroup which took over, they were corrupt, very corrupt.",
        "Q: How did people get chosen for these duties?",
        "A: I don't know. I think they just got a group of people together and went to the Germans\nand what they did, I don't know. This third group they were a couple of brothers and\nsomeone else, and they denounced the second group as corrupt, because I guess they got\nwind of what was going on.",
        "Q: Were there any women in positions of responsibility?",
        "A: I don't think so. Not at that time, no.",
        "Q: Do you remember how you all felt about these Jewish police taking orders from the\nGerman.",
        "A: Well, they were not really taking orders from the Germans. They had to do a job and\nthere were friends among them. I mean, they were not in any way abusing people or\nkilling people, or hitting people. They were just standing there and wouldn't let you go.\nThe Germans and the Poles could come into Ghetto, and they told you not to go. This is\nthe border, this is the line, you can't cross the line, period.",
        "Q: Did they have any other responsibilities like organizational schools?",
        "A: No, in Ghetto, there was absolutely nothing, no schools. The only thing\nwe had organized, they organized a hospital. It was an old factory, and we organized it as\na hospital. We had a bunch of fundraisers, which were like reviews, and people\nvolunteered to entertain and perform and we would all go to the shows and that would\nraise money for the hospital. But that was the extent of this cultural events.",
        "Q: Now, you said your mother worked and she had outside patients. Did you have enough to\neat?",
        "A: Oh yes. My family, at that time, we had too much to eat, because we had access to\neverything at much lower prices than the real Black Market. Those items were on the\nBlack Market, but we were going directly from the Poles to us as I guess going to some\nmiddle man in the Ghetto. So, we did have enough to eat. Grandma again, had a little girl\nwho helped run this place, and as a result my mother was supporting that family, and the\ntutor's family, and she had two aunts and one uncle. She was supporting them, giving\nthem money so they could buy their food.",
        "Q: Were times hard for other people in the Ghetto, or was this Ghetto not too severe?",
        "A: No, it wasn't too severed. But it was, like those two women who were teaching me, there\nwere two sisters that lived with their mother, and they had absolutely no way of getting\nany money. They were tutoring me and they were tutoring my other friends, so that was\ntheir main way of making money. My mother gave orders that when they came in the\nafternoon, we served a little snack. I didn't need a snack, but by serving some little\nsandwiches or something the tutor could eat and she didn't have to eat home. So, there\nwere ways of helping people.",
        "Q: Was your sense for other people, was there food rationing?",
        "A: There was rationing. There was a Black Market. There was rationing, but again it was not\nso bad like in Lodz. I mean, people survived. No one starved to death. The Jewish\nadministration, I think they had some kind of a welfare department because Mom was\ntaking in any patient who couldn't pay, Jewish patient, would get a slip from the\ndepartment and they would come in and she treated them free. She'd never take any\nmoney. I mean people had money, but that was something else. But if they didn't, they\nwere all treated for free.",
        "Q: Were most people in the Ghetto working, older people or not?",
        "A: I don't think so. I don't think so. That Ghetto lasted about two years. People still had\nthings. People were selling things. They were selling linens. They were selling, if they\nhad any jewelry, they were selling, so I don't think at that time, and look, I was a young\ngirl, and I was concerned with working and meeting boys later and so on, and doing some\nschool work, so maybe I did not delve into that too deeply.",
        "Q: So, you were still doing all of those things?",
        "A: I was still doing all of those things until the Ghetto was closed.",
        "Q: Now, how at this point you had really lost touch with all of your non-Jewish friends?",
        "A: All right, there was an interesting encounter I had. In high school, we had one girl who\nwas of German decent, and as before they would taunt Jewish girls, the year before the\nwar, they started taunting her. We would not go to the -- they had catholic classes in\nschool. The priest would come in and teach them catholic, you know, the religion. So, we\nwere excused for the hour and the three of us, there was another girl and we used to sit in\nthe cafeteria and just sit and kill an hour. They used to send once a week a Jewish teacher\nto teach all of the Jewish girls, the Jewish religion. So, the kids would taunt her, and I\nwas one of the few people who were friendly with her. And I met her one day in the\nGhetto, she worked in the Ghetto, and I was shocked because she hugged me and kissed\nme on the street. Her family declared themselves Tolstoy, you know, the German\nNationalist. And she gave me a big greeting, and I was very much surprised. But you see,\nI took her part and defended her against the Polish girls before the war. But that was the\nonly contact I had with her. I mentioned that woman who was my mother's friend, she\nmarried a Pole. When the war broke out they were in the textile business like everybody\nelse in town, and Mom decided to invest some money in some wool clothes. Because we\nfigured that during the war the factories will be closed, then that will be worth more\nmoney, but she left the fabric -- I mean I don't know how many bolts of fabric she\nbought, she left if with that family, with him and his family. When it came the time that\nshe wanted to sell it, he was the only one who came with the money. She sent him a\nmessage and within a few days, and this was a nice profit, because naturally that thing\nincreased in value and we got it. We got the money. So, he was one of the few. He was\ngood and he was honest and he didn't look to take the stuff and not to deliver.",
        "Q: So, it sounds like in the Ghetto you were able to carry on somewhat of a normal\nexistence?",
        "A: Basically.",
        "Q: It didn't change things, but you were still able to eat?",
        "A: In my family.",
        "Q: And there weren't too many rough restrictions?",
        "A: Well, no. We had every once in a while the Germans would come in. There were\nrestrictions where you couldn't have certain metals and precious metals and then they\nstarted raids, and it was just wild. They would come in from all sides, line up, the ones\nwith the brown shirts and the red armbands, they were lined up at arms lengths, they even\ntook the boy scouts, the Hitler Youth, they lined up and they would go from apartment to\napartment from room to room and looking for furs and looking for metals and naturally\nsilver. But even cooper and pewter, whatever metals they could melt. There were several\nincidents like this. They were also at one time, they wanted to evacuate Jewish\nyoungsters. They were looking -- my mother got hold of -- I mean she knew about it a\nfew days before, and I was hidden and some Jewish woman came with the Germans and\nsaid there is a young girl. I said I'm in the hospital, I was in the hospital.",
        "Q: What were they going to do?",
        "A: They took them away. We do not know what happened to them.",
        "Q: Were Jews allowed to keep businesses or anything like that?",
        "A: Local businesses. There was a restaurant and shoemakers and things like this,\nbut no business as such. Once they established the factory, they were making money.\nThey were paying them money, the operators. That brought some income to the Ghetto\nunder ;",
        "Q: I want to back track for a second because I forgot to ask you about how before the\nGermans arrived in your town, your community starting to prepare for that possibility?",
        "A: I don't know. I really don't know what way they did and whether they didn't. There were\na lot of people like the doctor upstairs. There were Polish, in the Polish army officers,\nthere were Jewish officers, and they were drafted and they went with the Army. Most of\nthem, they wound up in Italy or many of them went up in . We don't know\nwho killed them. I think the Germans, but the Germans were blaming the Russians, and\nthe Russians were blaming the Germans. But this was most of the Polish army was\ndestroyed there, the officers.",
        "Q: You had mentioned that there was sort of an organizing for this. The masks --",
        "A: Oh, the masks because they were afraid to throw down the gas bombs. We were afraid of\nthe gas bombs. There were a few raids in town, and we used to sit when there was a raid,\nwe used to sit I don't know what you call it -- in Poland they had the drive in like it was a\ndrive in under to go to the yard. So, they had this one section and it was supposedly the\nsafest place to be in case of an attack or bomb falling down. There were some dog fights\naround. We saw a German plane being shot down. The Polish army was a joke. We never\nrealized that. We thought, oh they are so strong. They used to have a song about the\nmarch of the Reds. He wouldn't give anything. He wouldn't give a buck, and when we\nstarted running away from the Germans we were following the Polish army. They were\nwith the little scrawny horses, with little cots pulling the small arms, absolutely\ndisorganized bunch of nothing. They were like 18th century and here was the smite of\nGerman army. So, they were overrun in no time.",
        "Q: So what were these masks?",
        "A: They were afraid of gas. They were supposed to be prevent us from being poisoned by\ngas.",
        "Q: Did you use them?",
        "A: One time we were sitting down, there was a raid, and everybody was \"Oh, they threw a\nbomb.\" They were masks like surgeons wear. The whole thing was a joke, but we didn't\nrealize it.",
        "Q: Anything else you all did in preparation for this?",
        "A: No, that's all.",
        "Q: What were the circumstances that you had to leave?",
        "A: They announced that the Ghetto would be liquidated, and we had like two days to get\nready.",
        "Q: This was when?",
        "A: May of '42. In fact, the 15th or 16th of May because my friend, Alena had a birthday that\ndate. They announced -- first of all there was a group of men who will be working in\nthose factories, the coat factories. They will stay for a while. They selected a group of\npeople who would stay in the Ghetto and clean it up. And they needed medical person\nalso. There was a doctor and he was old and he was a bachelor, and he had a sister who\nwas a dentist, and they volunteered to stay. Our family was ordered to go to the hospital,\nbecause there were a lot of patients. The population was told to bring all the infirm, all\nthe sick ones, all the very old ones to the hospital. So, on a given day, and we were\nallowed to just take what we had on our backs and those bundles. We wore a few layers\nof clothes and we went to the hospital. On the given day, when we got to the hospital, we\nwere told that there 1s an old age home somewhere so we carried the patients, whoever\nwas left, and this place was filled to the rafters because they brought everybody who was\nin any way infirm there. That first day, they marched the whole population to that\nstadium, which was actually at the other end of town. And we have been in a hospital that\nnight, so we haven't seen what happened, but we were told what happened. As they\napproached the stadium there was an area which was like fenced off which was before\nyou entered actually the stadium. They started separating the parents, the old ones, and\nthey started taking the children away. All the children under ten years old. I was told that\nthey threw a baby over the fence and said we don't need such . Smashed\nchild's, baby's head on a fence. They took them all to the railroad station. They grabbed a\nbunch of boys, young fellows and they took them to the railroad station. That night, they\ntook all the women who were left to Lodz. The following day they came to the hospital,\nand the group which came were the same boys and they were friends of ours. They were\nmy friends. I knew them. They told us that they were putting people into those cattle cars\nand then they took the women to Lodz by street cars and just the men are left in the\nstadium. They were the ones who carried the patients to the lorries, carts really, and they\nannounced who couldn't walk should go on a lorry. And my grandmother felt that she\ncouldn't walk all the way down. So, we had kind of a touchy moment because we walked\nthrough town. I think this was Sunday, because a lot of people were there and some of\nthem would make the sign of a cross when they recognized us, and the whole personnel\nwas walking. There was one woman who was hiding a kid in her backpack and she was\nwalking. She wouldn't go on the cart, and when we reached shortly before we reached the\nstadium, you had to turn left at the stadium and the station was straight ahead and all the\ncarts with the patients went straight, and the cart with the boys went straight and then we\nkind of froze for a minute, and the cart with my grandmother and other people went\nleftward to the stadium. So, they were with us. That night and a man told us again about\nthese awful, awful scenes which took place -- I think that out of population of 8,000\nfinally 3,000, 3,500 wound up in large Ghetto. That night they took us to Lodz by street\ncars. The street cars stopped running about midnight, and that's when they were taking us\nall to large Ghetto. That second day, were just men and group from hospital.",
        "Q: And the children who hadn't been evacuated?",
        "A: Well, I don't think there were too many children at that time.",
        "Q: Because of that earlier --?",
        "A: That day before, they took them all away.",
        "Q: You had mentioned that earlier in the Ghetto --?",
        "A: There were some teenagers, but not too many. I think they sent them to some work\ncamps, but not too many. We arrived at Ghetto late at night and they put us in some\nplace, just empty rooms. We were told that the gypsies were evacuated from that area\nbefore and that's just like a holding area. And people were crying and crying about their\nlost children and their grandchildren. It was just very, very sad about the old people, and\nsome other people wanted to know about what happened to the sick and the infirm. They\nleft them in the hospital, and what happened to them? And that same morning some\nfriends of our starting coming in looking for us, and one couple took care of my mother\nand me, and one person took my grandmother, someone took my grandfather. We stayed\nwith those people. They shared a couple of days they shared their food with us. They\ncould hardly afford it. Then we got a room for the four of us and we started our existence.\nI wouldn't call it living, in the large Ghetto.",
        "Q: One thing that strikes me about all of this is your mother must have been pretty strong?",
        "A: She was unbelievable. She held the family together. She had tremendous resources. Later\non, here, she was very unsure of herself and very vague and afraid, and even my husband\nwho knew her younger, younger age, he couldn't understand how absolutely brave and\nresourceful and fighting for life.",
        "Q: Was that unusual for a woman?",
        "A: To be a dentist?",
        "Q: Not to be a dentist, but to really be taking care of everyone?",
        "A: Well, she had to. There was no one else. She went to school when she was 18 years old.\nWhen she finished high school she went to Warsaw to study dentistry. There were no\ndorms, she lived on her own. She rented a room and lived on her own. She had to. Her\nfather paid for it, but still, she had to be resourceful.",
        "Q: So, now you're in Lodz.",
        "A: We're in Lodz.",
        "Q: Conditions, I'm sure, are a little bit different?",
        "A: Conditions are horrid. We had this one room, which was our bedroom, our living room,\nour kitchen, our bathroom. The first few nights, Mom and I slept on a straw mattress on\nthe floor, and mice came in and started running on our faces, so we had to give this up.\nSo, we shared one bed and Grandma had a cot, and Grandfather had a bed. We all\nworked. , who was the head of Lodz Ghetto, didn't like dentists, so she\nworked as a nurse in one of the factories. I worked in a brassiere factory. Grandfather\nwas working also like a male nurse in one of the factories. Grandma got a job, old ladies\nwere sorting rags and making bowls out of those colored rags, and eventually some\nyounger women were knitting rugs for the Germans. The problem was that the rags were\nfull of lice and they were sorting them on wire tables. So, she was bringing the lice home.\nWhen they give us rations, you have to pick up the rations, the first day because very\noften they would run out of the things. I think there were 750 to 900 calories a day what\nwe were getting at that time. And just before the winter they decided to give us rations\nfor the whole winter. Our wood and coal and turnips and potatoes and cabbage and beets.\nSo, we had to go and pick it up at night. Mom and I would stand in line. The only way to\npick this up was to put it on a sack and put it on your shoulders and carry it. You\nwouldn't let anyone carry it, because they would disappear. We had four people, so we\nsometimes had to do it in four installments, four nights in a row to pick up that stuff. On\nthe one bed we had the coal and the wood, and on the other bed we had all the potatoes\nand cabbage and we had the inventory. We knew how many months it was supposed to\nlast, and every couple of nights we would check which potatoes were getting rotten. And\nthis is the potatoes we ate because we knew it had to last for the whole winter. We also\ngot bread, a loaf of bread. So, again, we cut up the bread in sections and little slices so we\nhad for breakfast a piece and for lunch a piece and for dinner a piece and so we were not\n-- we were always hungry, but some people would eat the bread on the first day or the\nsecond day and they were starving the rest of the week. And what else we did, we all got\nsome kind of a -- we didn't make anything warm to drink in the morning but you could\nbuy hot water or coffee, so Grandma was going later to work so she volunteered. Then\nshe started tripping on the street and falling down. She would come with a bloody face,\nwhether she was weak or whether she had pressure too long, we don't know. So, we gave\nthat up. During the day we all got soup. If you worked, you got the soup. And you had to\nwork because you would get the money, the German money. The , they\nwere named after Mr. who was the absolute tyrant in the Ghetto. And\nthen at night we made a little something to eat, from whatever we had, whatever rations\nwe had. If we had any vegetables we made it a little bit thick with any starches or\nwhatever they give us. This was the existence. Cold miserable and we all started getting\nsick. I was getting abscesses on my face and sties in my eyes. Grandfather fell on ice and\nbroke his arm, and he started staying in bed. Grandmother had those dizzy spells, and we\njust tried to exist, and this was two years.",
        "Q: Did you have much contact with people outside of your family?",
        "A: Oh yes. At work, you work. I had a boyfriend, and we used to walk the streets because he\nhad no place to go, and I had no place to go, so it was cold and we used to walk the\nstreets and talk.",
        "Q: Were there curfews?",
        "A: I think there were curfews. I'm sure there were. We didn't walk at night. We walked on a\nSaturday. It was a day off, so we walked. Towards the very end of the Ghetto, I got a job\nin the fields, in the vegetable fields. There were two kinds of police in the large Ghetto.\nThere was this regular order police. They watched the exits. They watch order and stuff\nlike this. And there was so-called commando. The head of\ncommando was someone called Mark Kleeger (ph). Those bunch of thugs,\nthey would get orders from Germans to deliver diamonds or deliver or find gold among\nthe Jews, but they were nasty. They would come into someone's house looking for this\nstuff, and naturally they figure out the person would hide the stuff in sugar or flour. So,\ninstead of taking a plate or a bowl, they would just dump everything out on the floor\nlooking for the valuables. They were in charge of the fields where they distributed the\nvegetables. I mean, so if you knew someone and we knew someone and they were there\nand they put the finger on the scale a little bit or lifted the scale you could get a little bit\nmore. They had special rations. They ate in special places. They would buy their\ngroceries in a special store like all the others of ;",
        "Q: These were Jewish police?",
        "A: That was Jewish police. And as I said, he had those fields out near the Jewish cemetery.\nHe established vegetable fields. We had people working there. And I was getting sick and\nthrough connections and through people I got the job in those fields. It was a hard labor.\nSo, first of all you got two soups a day instead of one. I had to walk two or three miles to\nthat place, but the fresh air. I mean there was nothing much to do, the fresh air and the\nsun started drying up my face, and then we were working when we were weeding, we\nwould take the weeds home. They were a source of green vegetable. When we were\nthinning out radishes, we would eat raw radishes. That they couldn't catch us, but when\nwe were doing something with the weeds, weeding the weeds, we used to eat the raw\nbean and put the greens back into the ground so they couldn't figure out who was eating\nthem. We weren't really stealing, we were just hungry so we'd eat a bean. But that helped\nme later on to survive the rest of it, because all of a sudden my health improved so much.\nAnd because I was getting two soups a day, I didn't have to each so much at home. I was\ngetting the extra soup. I would bring it home at night so we had it. And my grandfather\nwas getting weaker and weaker. He couldn't eat. This was really awful, so we kept on\nsaving his bread. And his wish was to live so long that we can pick up his rations. This\nwas his inheritance because he said he lost all his gold, he can't leave us anything else.\nWhat we did he died the day before the rations came, and we didn't report it until the\nfollowing day, we picked it up and then I reported the death, so we had this extra little\nfood and an extra loaf of bread, which later I left 1f in Auschwitz because we're still\nhoarding and we're still afraid to let go and eat everything a once. But the existence in\nLodz Ghetto was awful. They also had the criminal police, , this was German\npolice. They had their headquarters in a little church, and they would call people in and\nsay what do you have? Our landlord, he was the head of fences before the war. A real,\nvery unsavory character, but he had a heart of gold. And he must have had money. They\nbeat him to death. They let him out, he died a day later. But he was like -- his face was\nlike liver. He never told them what he had. They called my mother in. They said we\nheard you are a rich dentist from . What do you have? And she said, \"Well, I\nhave a couple of gold chains, I have a little diamond.\" And they said, bring it in. So, she\nbrought it in and they let her go. So, they were satisfied. If she would have said she had\nnothing, they would have tortured her. This between the and the Jews\nunder commando, this was pretty tight situation over there. And then they started\nevacuations. They were evacuating constantly people. One of the worst actions was when\nthey took the children out. Orders came that they have to take the children, they're going\nto take them to better places. There will be fresh air and farms and the people put signs\non it and they mobilized all the Jewish police including all the people who worked for the\nhealth department, including my mother, and they had to go and collect the children. The\nchildren were being taken voluntarily by the parents, taken down, because they couldn't\nhide them. The moment the family would hide a child, the rations would be taken away,\nso not only the child didn't have the rations, but the family wouldn't have the rations. Our\nnext door neighbors had hidden a child and they struggled. Unfortunately she died later,\nbut it was -- and then they were taking the old people. They would make you line up on\nthe street and get out and just select the old people and the children Now, one of the\nworst actions was around the Jewish holidays, this was '44, I believe. And we lived on\nthe corner, and the lady the one who was our so-called landlady, she was the wife of the\nguy who was killed. Before the war she was in Argentina. So, we started lining up on one\nstreet and she called everybody up and she said forget it. This is not our street. Our\naddress is the next street. There were two entrances there. She said, all of you go back\nhome and hide. Just sit quiet, don't open the window, don't stand next to windows. At that\ntime she had hidden some children and my grandparents. We didn't know where they\nwere, somewhere. They had all kinds of nooks and crannies in that building, and we had\nall hidden quietly, and at noon they rang the whistles and they stopped the action. So,\nthey were ready to call that second street, where we were, they called it off, so we were\nsaved. If she would have -- we walked out and somebody said to us, someone who knew\nus and said, where are your parents, and my mother said, hidden. He said, that's silly,\nthey'll find them. They'll kill them. And he was not sure about mom, but when we went\nback, like I said, that action was closed. I mean stopped, and that's it.",
        "Q: Were you all sort of fatalistic about this? Was it terrifying to you?",
        "A: It was terrifying. You didn't know what's going to happen. Some friends of my mother's\nhe was high official, she had her parents, and they went down when the street went down,\nand he told that he'll be able to release them because he was a very, very high position,\nand he could never do anything about it. They took him. They started having lists and\nfirst I knew I was not on the list. One of my grandmother's sister was on the list, and we\ntried to get her out, and my friend told her to go, because there was no -- you couldn't\nsupport them. You couldn't do anything with them. Once they were on the list, the rations\nwere cancelled. So, who could afford to feed them. So, they took her, and my\ngrandmother had one brother and two sisters in large Ghetto. One of the sister-in-laws\ndied, two children were evacuated, one uncle was evacuated, the girl finally\n, and she died there. The other aunt, they took them away and we never\nheard of them again. The woman, the last one's husband was either taken away or died,\nand she was the last one who was evacuated before our family was gone. So, they all\nwere gone. I mean, there were relatives in other towns, but we never knew what\nhappened to them, but those I knew until '43 what happened to them.",
        "Q: Now, I want to know a little bit more to the organization of this Ghetto. I know there\nwere Jewish police.",
        "A: Well, the organization was the head of the large Ghetto was .",
        "Q: Did you have any contact with him?",
        "A: No, he slapped my mother's face once, because he thought she was peddling something\non the street and he was going in his carriage and there was a peddlar and she ran into our\nbuilding and my mother was working in the building and he ran after her and slapped her\nface. At one time I wanted to get a petition, when I had those abscesses, for some\ndifferent job. I never got into him. I never had any contact with him. He had his own\nclique. His brother, we called Prince Joseph, after Napoleon's brother. They all had good\napartments. They had special rations. They all wore high boots like the Germans. They\nall rode in those carriages with the horses, and he thought he was a king. The money was\n--the only money we could use in Ghetto were pictures on it. We called it\n. That was the only way you could buy anything. He liked the doctors, he\ndidn't like the dentists, so the dentists were person non grata.",
        "Q: Your mother didn't practice dentistry at all in the large Ghetto?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: All right, we'll get to that. I'll let you finish.",
        "A: If someone displeased him, he would just send them out, either send them out on\ntransport or if someone did something which was according to his rules not right, maybe\nabuses, they were assigned to the feces brigade. And this was the most horrid thing you\never saw. They would collect, there were cesspools, so they would collect the feces from\nthe cesspool in wagons 1n special tanks. But those people were pulling those things, and\nthey had to empty them somewhere in the suburbs of the Ghetto. I remember there was a\nyoung couple. I don't know what he did, and they punished him. She was a beautiful\nblonde and she used to pull that thing. They were covered with feces. Naturally a lot of\nthose feces were full of disease, so those people never lasted too long. You probably\nknow the landmark of the Ghetto was everybody carried a little canteen to work because\nwe got our soup in it. So we all carried it. As a matter fact, I got as a birthday present,\nsomeone made one that was not made out of tin but made some nice metal so that it didn't\nhave that tinny taste, because the soup would get soured in it. Even those people who\npulled those feces wagons, they would walk around with their bowl or their canteens\nattached to their belts because somehow on their route they would stop and wherever and\nthey would get their soup. So, as filthy and dirty and miserable as they were, they ate on\nthe road. But those people really, this was like he punished them. This was worse\npunishment I think than being evacuated on the transports. I also had a hard time with\ngrandfather when he was dying. We had cold water only. We had to pump the water\ndownstairs to bring it up. And they had laundries, public laundries. You sent out your\nstuff, took three months, two months you got it back. Not that we had valuable things.\nThey gave us things out when we came to the Ghetto. Well, Grandfather was sick\ntowards the end and he had uremia, and he had accidents, and 1n order to change the bed I\nhad to pick him up and put him on another bed. We'd change the bed and finally when he\ndied -- he wanted to commit suicide. He had some procaine (ph) and his cousin caught\nhim and he was ready to take it, but anyway, he died. In order to bury him, one had to\nprovide two clean sheets for a shroud. We had no clean sheets. So, I went to these friends\nof my mother's who lived in Lodz before the war, and there were several families there\nthat they all lived in Lodz. And that was the one who lost their parents, and I said, could\nyou lend me two sheets so I can bury Grandfather and we will either buy some on the\nBlack Market later on, or we'll get our bundle and we'll give it back to you. She said,\n\"No, I'm sorry, I don't have it.\" I was devastated. And finally the people next door who\nwere new acquaintances, the ones who had lost the child, she knocked on the door. She\nsaid, \"I hear you have a problem. Here are the two sheets.\" So, this is how we managed\nto bury him in clean sheets. This was towards the end of the war, and they felt that they\nare going to survive the war and they're going to have their linens and have everything\nelse. They lost half of their family and they still couldn't understand that those things\nwere not important.\nTape #2",
        "Q: I was mentioning that as far as I understand it, there was a lot of organization in the large\nGhetto. Cultural activities, little religious programs, theater?",
        "A: I have never attended any of it. I don't know anything much. There was a private library,\nand I used to go for books. The front was bordering the street which was closed. The\nmain street of Lodz Ghetto had street cars going like in . No one lived\nin those buildings. I think they had factories, most of them. There was barbed wire. This\nwas guarded by the Jewish policeman watching that no one should sneak out and so on.\nThat library, the private lending library was on that street, but I know we used to go\nthrough the back and stand in line and borrow books. That's the only thing which I had in\nterms of cultural events. As I said, I was there for two years, and we had to take care of\nthe old people. We had to bring the rations, and bring the food and do the fire and bring\nthe water, and bring the slops down. Everything was on my mother's and my back, and\none time she had an infection in her finger, so she couldn't grab. She had an infection in\nher palm and she couldn't carry things. She would go with me to pick up the rations just\nto guard me and I was carrying it. I worked, and as I said, Saturdays I would go out, and I\nmet this guy. I started going out with him on Saturdays. We would just walk, because he\nwas taking care of his mother and sister-in-law and a child, and he was a policeman, but\nhe was not doing anything how should I say, he didn't beat people. He was watching, I\nthink he was a sergeant, but they call it in German \" \" that means people who\nkept the order. They were not the criminals and they were not the commander.\nThose were the thugs. They are the ones who are the messy guys.",
        "Q: When you would take walks, what would you see?",
        "A: People very often, you saw people lying on the ground. They found bodies on the street.\nThe children, they used to sell , and there were children, there was a\nlittle chant the little children would sell , and\nthree for one mark. This was almost like a Ghetto song, those little children selling.\nChildren were working. My mother was working in a factory where children were\nworking. I don't know what jobs they had, sorting something putting something together.\nThey were little children. And I remember once she told a story about a little boy and he\nsaid he saw a goose, but he said it in Jewish and he says I saw a gants, not something\nwhole a gants, he meant a goose and he started flapping with his wing and trying to say\nwhat the goose was. And he saw a gants, and my mother said the eyes would dig because\nhe saw an animal. Even the little children, the ones who were finally eventually were\nevacuated, but at one time they had little factories for them. Even they had to work to get\na little soup. Life was -- there were wives who fought with husbands about food. The\nhusbands would threaten the wives or steal. People would steal the food from each other.\nPeople would sell the bread for cigarettes and then they were starving. It was so difficult\nto live. Now, I was a young girl and I didn't have any clothing, and we used every piece\nof scrap of whatever we could do something to make something. When we first came in,\nthey gave us some stuff, some linens, some pots and pans, because they had from other\nliquidated Ghettos, they would get the stuff in and when people were brought in, that was\nthe organization. They would distribute some of the stuff. I remember we got this big\ngrey shawl with fringes on it, full of holes. And I ripped the shawl, I took out the fringes\nand pieced the whole thing together. I think I made three hats for us, for mother, for\ngrandmother and for me, because it was cold and some mittens. We grabbed things out of\nthe Ghetto, Ghetto. Among other things there was a piece of fabric. I'll\nalways remember it was an orange piece of fabric and I needed something. And it was\nnot enough for a dress. I had a friend who was working with me and she was a\ndressmaker and she said find some wool. So we found -- I found some on the Black\nMarket, some yarn, and she made me knit parts of the sleeves and the yoke and the\nturtleneck, and some trim on the skirt, she made like pockets, and I had a beautiful dress,\nI mean made out of very small piece of fabric and those scraps. And the Polish peasant\nwomen never wore coats, even working women, they wear those big plaid throws, I mean\nlike big squares. They were square. So, I was with Mom, we bought this plaid thing and\nmade a jacket for me, because you had to I needed some clothes. I was outgrowing what I\nhad, and I needed something. We managed as I say, things from scraps. Every little scrap\nof wool, every piece of scrap of something, you pieced it. You bought pieces of wool and\nmade a sweater. You're talking about people in Ghetto how short sighted they were.\nWhen I was working for that factory, the corset factory, we would get this was for the\nGerman population, and Germans would send in cut out pieces of brassieres, I mean they\nwere all cut, and all the fittings and the little hooks and buttons, whatever, slides for the\nbrassieres or if we did corsets there were stays and eyelets, and we had to count\neverything and package it in small loads so we would distribute it to the assembly line. I\nworked in the warehouse where we would distribute. We even measured thread. We gave\nthem certain amount of thread so no one could steal anything. The guy who was in charge\nof the factory was a manufacturer before the war, and he felt that the factory has to be run\nin the correct order. There were times we had absolutely nothing to do. No shipment\ncame. There was very little and the assembly line was working very slowly and they\nwould come in and they needed a dozen buttons, a dozen stays and we would just give\nthem to the assembly line, but the biggest work was when the shipments would come in.\nWe had to count, like I say, every button and repackage it. So, the foreman of the factory\nused to say, \"Whatever you're doing, just make believe you're working.\" So, we would\nhave a book in the drawer and we'd knit under the table and on the table we would have\nbutton or stays open up a package and make believe we were counting or whatever. This\nguy would come in, you would have to hide from him because he did not believe, he\ncould not bring himself to say, \"Look girls, there is nothing to do.\" As long as the\nGermans don't come in and they don't catch you with it, he was petrified. When the time\ncame for me to get transferred to the fields, I needed his release, and he wouldn't release.\nWith all the connections I had to get to those fields, he didn't want to lose one of his\nworkers. Finally, someone from our hometown, who was also director of a more\nimportant factory, he was a director of the uniforms, the coats for the German Army, he\nfinally approached him and said, \"There's a young girl here. She's sick. She needs some\nfresh air. This dust in the factory is killing her.\" I couldn't breath, I was having attacks of\nasthma. \"Why don't you release her?\" Finally, I got the release from him, but when I\napproached him he wouldn't do it. There were many people like this. They were so self\nimportant. They felt so important, and they were nobodies nothings. All of a sudden they\nbecame heads of factory or whatever. And Ghetto was one huge factory, starting from\nelectronic equipment, uniforms, which was the most important things, boots, supplies for\nthe Army, going down to the brassieres, hats, artificial flowers, brooms. And even those\nrag rugs, braided rugs which were made out of scraps. They would take torn sheets which\nthey would get from various cities when the other towns or cities were liquidated like in\n. That group saw that the good stuff went to Germany or for the\nGerman settlers. The junk came back to Lodz Ghetto. Some of the stuff was torn, they\nwere rags. They would dye them different colors and make braided rugs out of them. So,\neverybody was working and everybody produced something, and we produced and the\nGhetto was getting food. There was no money.",
        "Q: How were these people selected to be in positions of authority whether it was the police\nor the factory?",
        "A: I don't know, connections, basically.",
        "Q: Were there ever women in positions of authority?",
        "A: I think so. I think so, I don't know how many, mostly a men's society. The guy Kleeger,\nthe one who was the head of the commando, he had a brother who's the\nmost extremely decent guy, and she was a friend of my mother's from before the war, and\nhe was in charge -- this is a specialty of empty containers. You see, if they brought\ncontainers to Ghetto, let's say they brought brown sugar or they brought flour or\nsomething, that department would scrape out the things and there was still food in it and\nthey had to return to those things back to the Germans to refill it. So, he was in charge of\nthe empty containers. This was -- he had a high position, but he felt that this was a\nposition which in any way he's not jeopardizing anyone's life and anyone's position. He\nwanted to survive, and he survived and his wife, but this was his job, and one day I told\nyou when the commander, his brother's hoodlums were coming into the\nbuilding, one day he was passing our apartment building and he saw the guys were\ncoming in to check, and he just walked in. My grandparents were home. He walked in\nand just sat down and talked to them. He was waiting for those guys to come and he\nwanted to chase them on their way. He felt they shouldn't anyway, he never said anything\nlater, and they left the building and he later told my mother that he came in because my\ngrandparents said \"What was Simon doing here? He just came to visit us in the middle of\nthe day?\" He came, he wanted to prevent any scenes with my grandparents. As I said, he\nwas the most decent guy in the world. His brother survived, I think, either brother or\nnephew. He was hiding. Those people survived that lived in Israel, and we saw them.\nThere were a lot of decent people.",
        "Q: There was also corruption?",
        "A: I think there was corruption. There had to be corruption. There had to be corruption. You\nsee, in large Ghetto I was such a low level of living that I really don't know what was\ngoing on, but we know -- the whole administration and when I read this book about Lodz\nGhetto, one time he had theaters here and orphanages, he had schools, he was making\nthe famous speech, give me your children, he felt justified in sending out\nthe children because maybe he can save some people. When finally it came to his\nevacuation, they gave him a special passenger car. He didn't go 1n a cattle car, and he\nexpected that they were going to take him on an inspection of camp and he's going to\nhelp them in Auschwitz. And there are three theories what happened to him. One was that\nsome people from Lodz Ghetto killed him when he arrived. Some of them he was gassed\nor some German killed him. So, we don't really know what happened to him. Now, once\nthey evacuated us, the evacuation --see what happened, they were having more and more\nlists and more and more evacuations and they would grab people on the streets. I was\nafraid to go anyplace. And I had some money coming to me and some vegetables coming\nto me because the vegetables all of a sudden were ripening, and I was afraid to go by\nmyself to the place that I was working. And this friend of mine, the policeman, he said\nhe'll take me, because at least we hope they won't grab me on the street when I'm being\nescorted. At that time, we knew something was going to happen, so we made this big out\nof some fabric back packs and packed all our valuables and some food. That was sitting\nready to be taken in case they evacuate us. We never knew in the last few weeks of\nAugust, this was the beginning of August '44. He was late, and that in a way helped me\nand Mom be together, because by the time he arrived, they took us by that time they just\nblew the whistles everybody out. That's it. So, we went down, and downstairs he was\nthere. He just came. If he would have been 15 20 minutes before I would have left and I\nwould have never been with my family. I would have gone with him. So, he helped us to\ngo to the train station and that's where they put us in the cattle cars. There were about 80\npeople in the cattle car and one bucket, one slop bucket. I don't even know if there was\nanything to drink. We all had something to eat, I mean whatever we grabbed. As I said,\nwe had an extra bread which we never allowed ourselves to eat the whole bread. We're\nsaving it because what happens tomorrow. We were so conditioned to it that you have to\nsave something for tomorrow. And Grandma was embarrassed to go in the bucket. She\ncouldn't -- and we tried to cover her with the coat and so on. People were dying on the\ntrain. This was one night when I --",
        "Q: I'm sorry to interrupt you but did you have any idea where people were being sent?",
        "A: No, there were all kinds of rumors but no one knew.",
        "Q: Had you heard about this before?",
        "A: We didn't hear of Auschwitz. We heard about bad things happening, but the only time\nthat I knew something was happening when those boys told us that the people were taken\nto cattle cars, the old people and the children, and those boys were never heard of again.\nBack track, one of my friends was hung in Lodz Ghetto. He was found, he was trying to\nescape from camp. And this was a boy I saw him when I was 15, I gave him my\nphotograph, and then somebody told me that he was hung, and they found my photograph\nwith him. Since that time, I was going up the ladder. I had boyfriends who were much\nolder than him, and I became obsessed to get that photograph back, because I felt if that\nboy felt that way that he had my photograph, it was taken when I was 12 or 13, before the\nwar. I finally tracked that photograph down and had it, and I told you that the people\nfrom Ghetto some of them were hung. The ones who were in charge of the\nGhetto at one time, which I mention it in my book. So, when we got -- what were we\ntalking about?",
        "Q: The cattle cars, going to Auschwitz.",
        "A: Yes, the cattle cars, going to Auschwitz. We arrived at Auschwitz, and it was dark in the\ncattle cars. All of the sudden the light was kind of blinding. They lined us all up in fives.\nWe had my grandmother with us. They told us to leave this stuff whatever we had. I just\nhad like a little lunch bag, and I had my photographs there, and I had some money there,\nand a couple of rings and things like this. Mother, I think had probably instruments. If\nanything, aside from anything else she had was instruments. She had a red cross arm\nband, because in Ghetto everybody was identified by something. They had caps and they\nhad bands, and they had different hats with different 1.d.'s and so on.\nwas big on uniforms but couldn't afford uniforms, so he was giving people hats. As we\nwere approaching , there were a lot of Polish couple, like trustees\nworking there, the ramp, and I didn't realize until later what this Pole did. He saved our\nlives. What he did, is pushed me into the line first and separated me from my mother and\nmy grandmother and put some people in between. Then he put my mother in, again, put\nsome people in between, and then put my grandmother. He knew where she was going.\nHe wasn't sure where my mother was going. He knew where I am going. And the family\nwas together. Very often they's say let me go with that loved one and they would oblige.\nSo, naturally they send me in and then he asked my mother where she is going, and she\nsaw the sign and she said I am going to work. The sign was , SO She said\nI'm going to work. He looked at her, clapped her on her behind and let her go. And\nnaturally, they send Grandmother to the left, and my mother had nightmares because it\nwas so confusing that we didn't have a chance to look what happened to her. It was so\nfast, and so unbelievably confusing, and I think that the Pole by separating us, knew what\nhe was doing and he saved us, the two of us.",
        "Q: Was there a general hysteria?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: People just weren't --?",
        "A: There's a by word of Auschwitz \"shnell (ph)\" Everything they did you had to do fast,\nfast, fast. You had no time to regroup, you had no time think, you had no time to do\nanything. Get off the trains, line up, fast. That's all you could hear \"Shnell, shnell,\"\nWhen they finally regrouped us on the other side of the table, again they formed us in\nfives. There were groups of prisoner girls, and they started driving us, practically driving\nus, fast, running, and while we were running, we encountered a group of subhumans, to\nus at that time they were subhumans, they wore tops of men's pajamas, but they were not\nthe regular prison garb. They all had their hair shaved. They had the wooden lace shoes\non. Their doppers (ph) were plastic or fabric or whatever, or no, they were wood sabits\n(ph) like Dutch shoes, because it was muddy around. There were sent in another\ndirection, and they started yelling give me your bread, give me something, they'll take it\naway it from you. Give it to us, and they were supervised by the Germans, but basically\nthey were smacking them, and we were shocked seeing that group, and naturally wouldn't\ngive them the bread. I mean, God forbid, we had to hide the bread for us. We'll need it.\nAnd finally they brought us into an area where the baths were. This was a real legitimate\nbath, a processing area. By that time it was getting dark, and they warned us to turn in all\nthe gold and all the diamonds and all the valuables that we have because they'll be taken\naway. And rumors were going that they were going to do very personal inspections. Well,\nMom had a bridge with two diamonds in. She had it made in such a way that she could\ntake it out. The diamonds were taken out of the things and she had it in her mouth. This\nwas like a final ration in case we need anything. And I was very upset. I got panicky and\nI said I don't want to give these Germans absolutely nothing. Let's bury them. And I also\nhad a couple of rings, old rings. And in the dark, my mother says \"Are you sure?\" And I\nsaid Mom, I don't want you to give it to them and they are going to look in your mouth\nand they will find it and they will get, and I don't want them to have it. And there we put\ninto the ground, ground it with our heels, and got rid of the diamonds and got rid of the\ngold. There were a couple of other things they took, but this, it's like a feeling, like great\nwe didn't give it to them. Anyway, they took us to this shed --.",
        "Q: What happened to the diamonds?",
        "A: She ground them into the ground.",
        "Q: Was that the end of the story with the diamonds?",
        "A: Yes, but we wouldn't give it to the Germans. That was fun --, when I think about it now,\nthis was fun, because they didn't get it. Maybe somebody eventually found it, maybe not.\nI don't care. They were sewed in a little plastic thing -- well, we didn't have plastic.\nAnyway, they took us to the shed. We had to get undressed, get the clothes off. They took\neverything away from us and they sent us to the sauna and lucky for me, I don't know\nwhy, they didn't cut my hair. They did shave our hair and they give us tattoos. It was very\nlate at night by that time. They were getting a lot of transports. Rumor was that they\nwanted us to -- eventually would have gassed us, but they were so busy, the crematorium\nwas so busy that they felt maybe they can do something with us, the able bodied people.\nAnd, they gave us some clothes. I wound up with a skirt, my mother wound up with a\nmini, So we switched and the wooden shoes. Then the last act was they painted a stripe, a\nred stripe down our backs and that broke me up. Talking about panic, and we walked\nnaked in front of the guys, in front of the Germans and in front of Polish copos.\nSomehow, I took this whole thing without shedding a tear, but when they painted that\nstripe on my back, I started crying. Again, one of the Poles walked over to me, hugged\nme and said, \"Don't worry, you'll survive. You'll be okay.\" I mean, I spoke Polish at that\ntime fluently, and I was a pretty girl at that time, and he felt sorry for me so he said,\n\"Don't worry, you'll make it, just don't cry.\" So, they sent us out, by now it's late at night.\nThey didn't have a barrack for us. They'll send us to the latrine. I don't know if you know\nwhat the latrine in Auschwitz looked. They were concrete benches with holes that could\naccommodate 500 people at once. There were benches on both sides and then in the\nmiddle there was a long bench from back to back there were holes with a pit underneath.\nAnd that's how we were using as toilets. Well, that's where we spent the night, in the\ntoilets. Well, I don't have to repeat Auschwitz stories. We stood up from 5:00 in the\nmorning or 6:00 in the morning and then they put us in the barracks and we had 14\npeople, 12 to 14 people to one six by six or seven by seven bed. They gave us a can of\nwhatever they gave us was in a metal can, no spoon, no nothing, and five people had to\neat out of it, so everybody's watching how many swallows you did of that. And one of the\nfirst nights there, once we got into the barrack, they were burning, the crematorium was\ngoing night and day.",
        "Q: You knew what it was?",
        "A: We didn't. But someone woke up and those barracks, like you see in the Museum how\nthey look, they had little windows on top and someone must have woken up and saw this\nred glow in the sky and someone started crying all of a sudden 1,000 women started\ncrying and people who were in charge of it, group of Hungarian girls, they started yelling\nto be quiet because the Germans would come in and so forth. We still didn't know what\nhappened. We knew something bad had happened, but we didn't know about the\ncrematoriums, what's happening.",
        "Q: You didn't know what the crematoriums were? How many people were in your barrack?",
        "A: About a thousand.",
        "Q: From all over?",
        "A: This was probably mostly Polish group run by the Hungarians. The girls who were in\ncharge had short skirts and they for some reason they all like polka dotted blouses and\nthey had their hair. They cut my hair some more. They didn't like my having hair, so they\nshaved it a little -- they didn't shave it, but they cut it completely. And Mom developed,\nwe were afraid, because she developed from the wooden shoes a wound on her ankle and\nthat was festering, and two weeks later they had the selection, luckily they put us through\na shower again, and the paper bandage fell off, so when they selected her, they didn't see\nher with the bandage. As much as that was festering and messy, they didn't do anything.",
        "Q: Was your day fairly controlled?",
        "A: Extremely. We had to get up, I don't know, 5:00 or 6:00. It was cold in the morning. You\nstood on that for hours. They counted, and counted first from the\nbarrack, then they counted from the section, then they counted -- they had to count the\nwhole camp through and had to tally. If someone died, they had to tally. If someone died,\nthey had to tally. If they couldn't find someone, they were looking for them.",
        "Q: This is the whole camp, not just your barrack?",
        "A: No, no, they started with counting the barrack, then there was a whole section, then they\nhad to have it to one person, and if they couldn't find her they were looking for them.\nSomebody was maybe hiding. Maybe someone died, maybe someone couldn't get up. It\nstarted over and over and over. And the morning was cold. Then they would give us five\nminutes in the bathroom. Sometimes they put us in one of the other barracks was like a\nwashroom. I don't know how many spigots, but again, it was fast, fast, fast. There was no\ntoilet paper, there was nothing. You couldn't wash, you couldn't do anything. If you\nmanaged to put your hand under the spigot and get a little water, they gave us something\nin the morning, I don't know if they gave us bread at night or in the morning -- no, I think\nwe used to get the bread at night and save a piece to have it for the morning, and they\ngave us some soup during the day and some kind of a liquid during the day, in the\nmorning. Once we were standing in the , and one of the girls, whatever she\nhad she had some kind of a jacket with patch pockets, and I said, \"Gee, that would be\nnice to have for bread.\" And she ripped out the pocket and said, \"Here.\" She knew my\nmother from her town, because we would save the piece of bread to have it for the\nmorning, and you were afraid to put it down. You slept on top of the bread so God forbid\nsomeone shouldn't steal if from you. So, that pocket was a great thing to put the piece of\nbread. I mean, you know, such little things can mean so much to you. Anyway, luckily\nfor us we only stayed only two weeks there. This was hell.",
        "Q: Did you work?",
        "A: No. Yes, I offered -- I couldn't sleep. Mom was doing something, checking some things.\nYou know they asked who was a medical thing, so she would go down, and they made us\nsit in those beds and you couldn't lay down. You just had to sit. Fourteen people in one of\nthose platforms. Well, I couldn't sleep at night with all the noise and at night they had the\nslop bucket at the door and somebody had to go, they had to go to the slop bucket and\nwhen the slop bucket was full, had to be taken to the latrine. Well, I volunteered. And\none of the escort from one of the other girls, from one of the workers, but they felt\nthemselves above carrying a slop bucket, and at least I could get some fresh air. Walk,\nwhen the bucket was full, I could go walk out.",
        "Q: Did you see anything strange when you'd walk out at night?",
        "A: Nothing, it was just dead. Nothing was seen, no one was walking, except as I said,\nfigures taking the slop bucket. That's about all. No one was allowed to go to the\nbathroom. But, I was waiting for that occasion.",
        "Q: It just sounds sort of eerie.",
        "A: It was very hot in the afternoon. This was still August. So during the day, it got hot, and\nin our camp they would send us out again for another count, and by that time it was hot,\nand we stood there for hours until they tallied. It was a way of torture. They were just\ncruel and people were fainting and people were dying in the lines and you were not\nallowed to help them. You had to leave them the way they were. If someone passed out,\nthey passed out. That's it.",
        "Q: You went out a night, did you see the crematorium flames or smell them?",
        "A: There was a small and there was dust, but we didn't -- there was some white stuff\nfloating, but we didn't know what it was. The first night the glow was unbelievable. And\nwe were afraid, I don't know, we were afraid to do anything. You were not allowed to.\nOnce I was in the bathroom, maybe I wasn't moving fast enough, there was this famous\nErma , She later came to Bergen-Belsen, blonde, gorgeous cool\nand she had this big whip and she smacked me with a whip. Because as I said, the whole\nward was fast, whatever you did. You had to line up fast, you had to go to the bathroom\nfast. They gave you five minutes in the bathroom. Five minutes maybe not even five\nminutes to get some water to wash up, wash up, maybe you could wet your face maybe\ntake a sip of water and wet your hands. That's about all. Conditions were awful.",
        "Q: How were the other guards, the copos, your block elders?",
        "A: I don't know. It's hard to say. They lived very nicely, especially the block elders. They\nhad little rooms with quilts and they had little stoves. And one with the block elder she\nwould help and then they had a whole bunch of lesser girls and -- our group was\nHungarian so there was a communication gap. Some of them spoke German, some of us\nspoke German and some of us didn't. I didn't speak too well German, but I understood.\nSo, you were afraid of them.",
        "Q: Were they nasty?",
        "A: Sometimes, like I said with the hair. They couldn't stand the fact that I had hair. I mean I\ndidn't. I had short hair, but they couldn't stand that. They didn't have a razor, so they\nclipped it and said that's to prevent lice. Because they saw some workers working on the\nroof, again Polish workers. I talked to them once. I don't know how I managed to say\nsomething, and I said I could use a stick, and he said fine, tomorrow we'll work on the\nroof and I'll make you a stick for the soup. It's like a tongue depressor and he dropped\nthat stick for me, so I could dig into the soup. They didn't like it. So, the following day,\nthey called me down to the bottom of the thing and said, \"We have to cut the hair.\" So,\nthey cut some more. I had no choice. Because except for the block elders and their\nassistants the rest of them had shaved heads. How they got there, how they became them,\nI don't know. There was a woman who came along, she was a dentist from Poland, and\nshe kind of asked my mother and said, you know, I can get you a job and so on and she\nwas hinting that my mother has anything she should give it to her and she could arrange\nfor her to get a job as a dentist. At that time we didn't have anything, and my mother was\nupset. She said, if I had the diamond, I could have given her the diamond. I could have\ngotten a job. Lucky for us, we didn't have the diamonds and they sent us out to Bergen-\nBelsen.",
        "Q: Why don't you tell me how that came about?",
        "A: About two weeks after we were in Auschwitz, they lined up, had another selection. They\ntook us to the showers, gave us some clothes, and they took aware our clothes. I mean if I\nhad a little -- I had a little skirt and a tank top, they took the skirt away. The tank top was\nso short, I had a ribbon in the tank top and I had to tie it between my legs otherwise my\nwhole behind was showing. And they ran us out, and again they had a selection and they\nwere supposed to send us out. Then something happened, the trains were not there, and\nthey put us in some temporary barrack. The following day, they ran another selection.\nThey gave us a bath, and they put us on the train. This was the time I really don't know if\nAuschwitz had two stations or not because this is the only time and I went back to\nAuschwitz, I remember, we went through the main camp of Auschwitz, because we were\nin and this was, I saw the red buildings, the permanent buildings. I saw the\nband playing. So, I had a feeling they had some other station in Auschwitz proper which\nthey loaded us. They unloaded the cars somewhere else, and they put us there. They put\nus in cattle cars again. They give us a piece a bread and a piece of cheese. There was one\nwater bucket with water, and there was one slop bucket, and they put us on the trains. I\nthink we were there either two nights or three nights, and one night they stopped\nsomewhere and they brought a fresh bucket of water, and assigned someone to distribute\nthe water. Brought a little cup and we were supposed to have a sip. One woman got so\nfrenzied, she grabbed her shoe and dipped it in there and drank from the shoe. When they\ngive us the clothes, by that time, I've got those laced up shoes with wooden soles. One\nwas white and one was black, and I had this men's shirt, long flannel thing, blue satin,\nsignificant later, I'll tell you about that story. We stayed, and as I said the train was on\nand off and on and off. At night it would stop. I remember once we were next side there\nwere real cattle making cattle noises. This was an absolute nightmare. Later on when I\nhad my typhous fever, all I had I kept on saying, take the train out of my head, get the\ntrain out of my head. That's all I could hear is that. It took me years before I wanted to\ntake a train anyplace, because even when I was in Europe and we traveled later, I was\nvery reluctant to take a train. We finally arrived at Bergen-Belsen about maybe the third\nday. All the passing and stopping we passed, I think, Dresden. We saw someone tried to\nclimb up. We could see the bombed out cities and we were very happy to see those\nbombed out cities. I think it must have been the third day. We felt that another night on\nthe train we will completely lose our identity and it was confusing. We were getting\nconfused without food, without drink, and with the total darkness for so long, no knowing\nwhere we were going, what we're doing. Anyway, they took us, we came to Bergen-\nBelsen, and until that time Bergen-Belsen was not a concentration camp. They had\nvarious camps of various entities, prisoner of war camp, but there was no camp\nconcentration camp as such. Again, they asked people who can't walk who would like to\ngo by truck, and I think one or two people who were very sick, they went. Otherwise, my\nmother with the bad leg, she would not go on the truck. She was afraid, because we knew\nby now, by that time, when you are sick something bad is going to happen to you. We\nfinally got into the main camp. It was a long, long street. The front of the street, the\nbeginning of the street, there was administration places, there was a bath, there was a\nlittle crematorium which they could burn two bodies. But this was done for bodies. It was\nnever done to use it for killing people. If people died, they would use it. They gave us a\nbath and we put our clothes in a little basket, and when we walked out from the other side\nof the bath, we got the clothes. They marched us down to the end of the street of the\ntown, the very end of the camp, and there was this big tent that could accommodate about\n1,000 people. It was clean. We all got a blanket each. On the floor of the tent was\nwooden shavings, bales of wooden shavings, clean, never used. There as a latrine in the\nback right under the guards tower, big pits and there was a couple pieces of wood where\nyou could kind of lean against, but you could use it any time you wanted. There was a\nwooden trough with pipe. We could use the water any time we wanted. They nominated\none lady, she was from Germany, she spoke German, as camp director, and her assistant,\nshe was originally from Germany, so they spoke fluently German. They counted us once\na day. This camp is located on the , So It's like heather. At that time there was\nfields in back of us, later on they build more and more and more but at that time it was\njust us and the fields. So, we could sit in the sun. We could drink when we wanted, we\ncould go to the toilet when we wanted. Even at night, if you wanted to go to the toilet, --\nif the guards heard something going on, he would put the light on, the spot light on, if he\nheard a movement. So, maybe they eliminated you when you were using the bathroom.\nWhen the girls were sitting there, they would just look. After a while, you lose all\ninhibitions, and if they want to look, let them look. That's what we're going to do. At that\ntime we didn't have any doctors so the first day, the second day, they brought a big chest\nwith some first aid things and some pills, some equipment. Mom became the doctor.\nThere was a head dentist, I don't know his name, but he was until the very end, a very,\nvery decent guy. So, one of the first questions he asked me is \"How come your head is\nshaved?\" They couldn't understand that. There were SS but they had no idea about the\nhorrors of Auschwitz or the other camps. They were just half way decent people in the\nbeginning. The food we got was paradise next to Auschwitz. Fairly decent soup, we got\nsome kind of coffee in the morning and a nice piece of bread and at night very often they\nhad something, a piece of cheese or some artificial jam or something and Sundays we'd\nget red cabbage and there was some meat in it and potatoes with jackets and this was the\nfirst few weeks. The next few days they put another tent up. We got a big group of\nHungarian women another tent up. So, about that time there was 3,000 people in that\ncompound, because there were other groups.",
        "Q: All coming from Auschwitz?",
        "A: I think so. I think they were coming from Auschwitz because the other ones were\nHungarians. Can I tell you something interesting about -- by that time, we didn't have a\ndoctor and they brought a bunch of women from the Warsaw uprising, gentile women.\nThey were not with us, but they brought one of the doctors to us to work with us and one\nof the women somehow when there was another nurse and I and my mother and people\nwere coming in with various ailments, there was one lady who was from Germany, had\nlost her husband and child. She was not Jewish. Her husband was Jewish, and she kind of\nstarted becoming administrator to the very end. She was the administrator of the hospital.\nAs a matter of fact, we saw her in the United States. She survived. So, we would sleep --\nit was so cold, but we would sleep, this Polish doctor, and Lisa and my mother and I\nwould take one blanket and put it underneath us on the shavings and would cover\nourselves with the three other blankets. It was much warmer. And the body head kept us\ngoing. It was getting cold. By that time, I think my mother started looking at some teeth. I\nmean, checking, also everything on the floor, we had no place to do but, one day we got\nnotified and some people approached Mom and the other women and a few other ones\nthat this is Yom Kippur and the Hungarians are going to have a service and\nwe are invited. After dark come in one by one and come in, sneak in. So, one by one, it\nwas very dark, and you know they closed the camp. Except for the towers, there was no\none in camp. They would close it up, all the Germans would just disappear at darkness.\nAnd we all hide under the blankets. We wrapped ourselves in blankets and quietly\nwalked into the tent. They lined up the shavings in such a way they were like benches. In\nthe very front they made a out of the shavings covered with blanket. How\nthey got a candle, I do not know, but they had a tiny little candle. There as a young girl\nand an elderly woman and they sang the whole out of memory. And\nthey sung, and they warned us please do not cry, please do not wail, please do not make a\nsound. Don't sing, don't do anything, just be quiet, because the Germans would have shot\nall of us. I tell you, this was one, even the Polish woman, she was sitting there with the\ntears running down her eyes, this Polish doctor. We all sat, and until today I go to\nservices and when I hear the chant, I see that scene because it was eerie.\nCan you imagine, by that time there must have been 1,500 women there, like ghosts\nsitting in the gray blankets listening to the service, and then again, they let us out one by\none, two by two, please don't say anything. Don't talk when you walk, just sneak into\nyour own tent. This was unbelievable, the faith, and as I said we all took chances by\nattending that service.",
        "Q: Since you were not particularly religious growing up, how did the part of that service\nmake you feel?",
        "A: Unbelievable because I knew -- let's put it this way. We had a record of one of the\nfamous cantors home so I have heard I don't think I ever went to services,\nbecause this was such an Orthodox synagogue, so I couldn't go maybe when I was little\nkid they took me, Grandfather took me, but I never went. But I always heard this record,\nbecause my father liked that cantor and he had this record. And I used to play with the\nrecord player, so I was very much aware of that chant, and I knew it. I knew the melody,\nand I knew that this was something very, very important.",
        "Q: Was there a special sense of solidarity?",
        "A: Solidarity, feeling of something, hope. To do something like this in such circumstances\nwas unbelievable, especially after Auschwitz where we were so controlled and here we\ncould attend this service.",
        "Q: About the camp, were you isolated from all these other groups?",
        "A: Yes. Well, the way the camp was done was like I said, wa one long street and there were\nvarious sub camps on various sides. We were aware of several of them, and later on I was\naware of more of them. One was called the stern camp and one was called the diamond\ncamp, and those were the people from Holland and Belgium. The rumor --they lived with\nthe families at that time. That's when the children came in. Rumor was that they paid a lot\nof money to the Germans to bribe them in terms of giving them diamonds and gold and\nmoney, so when they evacuated them, they promised that they'll be kept separate and\nthey'll be kept with the families, and they'll not be destroyed. Eventually, they separated\nthem. They sent the parents out and the children were kept and I'll tell you about the\nchildren camp a little bit later. They started bringing more and more people to our\nsection, our compound. It's getting crowded. One day the tents blew off. There was a big\nstorm and wind and just the tents collapsed. So, they put us somewhere temporary, and\nfor a so called hospital they build a little tent in a corner and the rest of the people were\nin the barracks. And that's the first time I saw myself. Those barracks had windows. It\nwas just a temporary measure until they could build some more places for us. I walked\none day, and I saw this person walking without hair and wearing this crazy blue striped\ndress, and I knew that this original model, there's only one. No one else has this copy of\nthat. And I couldn't believe that this was me, and I stood there and I looked at my\nreflection an I touched my face and I touched my hair. I couldn't believe -- I mean I was\nlike a little baby, like you show a baby a picture and he says that's me. That's the way I\nwas. I couldn't believe that's me. I looked at the dress and said no there's no other one,\nthat's me. I'm the only one. It was a shocking experience to see yourself.",
        "Q: How long had it been since you had seen yourself?",
        "A: This was after Yom Kippur, probably two months or so. It had to be in October because I\ndon't know exactly when Yom Kippur took place, but this was shortly afterward when the\ntents were blown down. So, then one of the people who one of the tasks was one of my\nfriend Alena who went to school with me, her mother was a pediatrician before the war.\nDuring the war, the beginning of a war, she was run over by a truck, so her face -- she\nwas never a pretty women, but her face was damaged, crooked and stuff like this. Well,\nshe became a doctor, and they sent another one, Doctor Annie. She was a woman born in\nRussian, went to medical school in Russia, married a French diplomat and she lived in\nGermany. She was Jewish, but she lived in Germany before Hitler, because he was a\nFrench diplomat. She was a socialite. She never practiced medicine, but this was our\nother doctor. By that time they moved us again. They build some barracks and they built\na so-called hospital. We were moved like three times. So, this was when Schnabbles (ph)\nstarted coming in. We had one big room where the patients stayed in the bunk, and one\ncorner we had the staff, and by that time they brought more nurses, must have been about\nSIX nurses, seven nurses and two doctors, my girlfriend Alena was a nurse. My mother\nwas there. On the one window we had this out patient clinic and in the back was a little\ntiny room and it was a dental office.",
        "Q: Excuse me, this is completely separate from the barracks?",
        "A: They had access to it. It was part of the camp, but this was a separate little building.\nThat's when we started seeing the two I don't know what you call it, the German -- they\nwere like medial corps men, or something. One was a decent guy, his name was Fisher.\nAnd he liked to grab the girls' boobs. So, we gave him a name of Fisher Tapper. Tapper\nin Jewish is to tap, to grab it, and he liked to grab whenever he could when no one else\nwas looking. The other one was obnoxious. He was a young fellow and we called him the\npig, so I don't know his name. And Doctor Schnabbles started coming in. He was an\nelderly man, according to rumors again, he was a nose and ear man. He was checking\nwhat patients and what cases we have. One of the first patients which he started doing\nsomething with, was a woman came on the transport, had a compound fracture of her\ntibia. The skin was broken, the bone was sticking out. It was a horror. They put some\nkind of a metal frame around it and she had to be operated on. So, he decided -- first of\nall, it was cool. He never would take off his coat. He did all his surgeries in his coat. He\ndecided to set the leg. Well, he was not very successful. So, the pediatrician opened up\nher mouth and said, \"Doctor, don't you think you should do this and that?\" Well, that\nwas the end of her. She was ugly as it is, he didn't like it with the scars and all on her\nface, but that put her in disfavor. We had two guys were watching, he tried to set the leg.\nHe never did. The woman was crippled. She survived the war, I think, but she was in the\nhospital with us all the time.\nTape #3",
        "A: So, the first time he started setting that leg, it never took. Well, Schnabble was looking\nalways for patients, what he could operate on. He was always checking what we have. At\nthat time, our staff consisted of Lisa, who the director of the hospital. We had a scribe\nbecause they wanted reports. How many patients were admitted, what they were coming\nin for, what sicknesses we had and stuff like this. There must have been six or seven\nnurses, and then we had two orderly ladies. We even had like a little toilet in the back.\nThose two women had to take the stuff out, but we had like a little outhouse attached to\nthe hospital. I don't remember what we had later, but that one I knew we had.",
        "Q: How many doctors were there?",
        "A: At that time, they took the Polish woman away, there was my friend Alena, Doctor\nand Doctor Annie, the Russian woman, who didn't know much about\nmedicine, but she was there.",
        "Q: How many of the nurses really had any medical training?",
        "A: Very few. What I had was like a practical nurse whatever I picked up, so did my\ngirlfriend Alena. There were one or two, there was one Dutch, she came and there was\nanother one, a Belgium that really had training or not, but we did what we could do. Let's\nput it this way. It was more than the other people could do. And then I had a little dental\noffice. We had also all kinds of patients and they were there forever. Some of them died,\nsome of them we let out. Basically, a lot of surgical things. I remember there was one\nyoung girl who claimed she could never get up and we tried to get her up, and we could\nnever get her up. Sometimes we climbed up and to get her out of the bed to straighten out\nthat mess, and never knew what was wrong with her. One day she just died, so evidently\nthere was something wrong with her. There was another young girl she had a groin\nabscess which was draining for weeks and months. I mean the woman with the leg, I\nremember once I wanted to wash my famous dress, I mean we had nothing. So, if you\nwanted to wash a dress you borrowed something from a patient and wore that for a day\nand washed the dress and the patient was lying naked. Conditions were pretty horrid, but\nas I said, they were still feeding us. We got the bread in the morning, and we, the\npersonnel didn't have to stay and it was getting cold. We also had a young girl\nwho was a mental patient, whether she was manic-depressant, I don't know. One day,\nSchnabble came in and decided to do some kind of a surgery, and we didn't have\nelectricity so they brought carbide lights. She got frantic. Something was going on in the\nother room and the lights. This was a scene like . She went wild. We\nstarted chasing her. She was running and she was jumping over the patients. She was\nclimbing the beds and they were the two, three story beds. And people, in that frenzy\nthey are extremely strong, and they are extremely violent and they are very agile. Well,\nwe finally got her and had some shots for her and put a straight jacket on her and got her\nsome shots. She was petrified of Schnabble. One of the tents was still up and I spent with\nher about two or three days in the tent. My mother was petrified that she's going to kill\nme, but she kept calm. I mean, you could talk to her a little bit, you couldn't get the story\nout of her. After that outburst, that place where we give her the injection, that festered\nand eventually she died. She had an infection. When we knew Schnabble was coming, we\nused to put the straight jacket on her, because she was so petrified. When he walked in,\nwe all had to stand at attention. We couldn't move. The only person who ever moved was\none of the little orderlies. She was a little woman, blonde nose, no teeth. She was a young\nwoman, bow legged, and she wanted to show him that she was working, so she would\nsweep the floor, including his feet. It was a riot, and he used to say, \"The only one who\nworks here is this one, the little one. She's the only one who's working.\" As I said, she\nwould sweep over his books, and he liked her. He never did anything in any way to stop\nher. Well, one of the first opportunities he had to send Doctor out, they\nwere sending out the transports. The transports, at that time, were going in and out,\nwhether this was to a labor camp or something, so he sent her out, because he couldn't\nstand her, because she tried to correct him.",
        "Q: Alena's mother?",
        "A: Alena's mother. So, they went out. They did survive the war. I think they wound up in\nand went back to Poland. Her mother died in Lodz or , and\nshe survived and she was an artist, and she lived in Paris. I was in touch with her, and\nthen she died of cancer. So, she was a young woman. But they survived the war. By that\ntime, Mom had got some kind of ear infection, and I remember she was in such pain. She\ngot some medication and she was cold. So, someone had a pair of prison underpants,\nstripes. I remember she put it on her head because this was the only warm thing she could\nput on her head. She was sitting in the bunk, lying on the bunk with the underpants on her\nhead like a hat. At that time, somehow, Lisa, this was the administrator, and the other one\nthat was the scribe, somehow they were trying to do a little , and get my mother\nout, because they needed a dentist and they were bringing this man dentist, he was Dutch,\nfrom another camp. I think at that time, Binko (ph) came around, I don't know what\nhappened, but there was a lot of whispering going on and a lot of talking back and forth,\nbut whether the German dentist --whatever happened, Mom got better and went back to\npractice.",
        "Q: Tell me about Binko?",
        "A: Well, she was a dentist.",
        "Q: What was her full name?",
        "A: Haddasa Binko (ph). She was a dentist. She came in couldn't find a job, was looking for a\njob. How she became the head doctor, don't ask me. She must have talked to the right\npeople, Germans probably, and they appointed her the head doctor. That little barrack\nwas getting too small for us so again they built another one. By that time we had a\nseparate room for the staff. I think we were doing the outpatient in the same room. I\nfinally beg hospital beds a small little room which was my mother's office. In the back, at\nthat time, they brought in a group of women from Slovakia. I don't know if they were\nJewish or not, with children. They had little children with them, and they built like an\nannex to our hospital, at the end of our hospital they were getting more firewood to warm\nup the place. They were getting some special soups, and they had some little possessions\nwith them. They had pillows, they had some tea. Every once in a while we could get\nwhen the transport came in, they would bring us a box of junk, medical supplies and all\nkinds of odds and ends. I was in charge of all the medical supplies. Whenever I got any\nvitamins I would take it to the children, because I felt that this was very important for the\nmothers, so I became very friendly with them. Anything with baby powder, whatever\nthey found and the Germans wouldn't use I started packages and so on. A little cough\nmedicine for children, pediatrics, so I would take it to those women. Later on they helped\nme. Anyway, it was getting cold, it was getting very, very nasty. The weather was getting\nnasty. One day a young woman came with pain -- and you see by that time we had a\ncouple of other doctors, I think. We tried to avoid telling Schnabble what was wrong with\nthe patient. We didn't have the means to diagnose. We had no blood tests. We had no x-\nrays, it was just feel and think.",
        "Q: Were people coming in for all kinds of conditions?",
        "A: Everything, and I can tell you, describe the conditions. There was one thing, dental\ncondition, which I think it's called , where pieces of gums and lips would rot,\ndecompose, and they would come in sometimes with a whole mouth missing, lips\nmissing. I remember once three sisters came. One was completely gone. The other one\nhad quite an advanced case. The third one had just started, and every once in a while we\ngot vitamins. I mean we got all kinds of crazy things, which were odds and ends from\nvarious shipments, because the rest of the supplies -- oh yes, they used to give us once in\na while paper bandages, and peroxide and some vitamins maybe and some aspirins. We\ndid get some stuff, but it was little odds and ends like vitamin C. You had to use ,\nthe one who got the shot of vitamin C was the one who had the least advanced case of\nthat cancer of the mouth, because we felt one or two shots may prevent that thing to\nspread further and maybe we could save. The oldest one, there was no way of saving. She\nwas, for all practical -- maybe here in the United States with heavy doses of vitamins and\nheavy doses of medication, maybe one could save her, maybe, maybe not. But certainly\nyou couldn't save her. This was what we had to do. There was another thing which later\ncame up, much later. A patient would come in with a little blister and the blister would\nget bigger and bigger and bigger. Unless that blister was opened and drained very often\nhalf of the body was covered with the blister. What did this? I don't know, because I'll\ntell you later about the British doctors who were there and we used to tell them what to\ndo with it, because they had no idea what to do with it.",
        "Q: How did you figure it out?",
        "A: We found that when they came with the blister and when we pierced the blister and\ndrained it, and had some dressing we put it on, maybe some antiseptic powder, whatever\nwe had we tried, somehow we could close the blister if 1t wasn't too advanced case of it.",
        "Q: Did you have enough supplies?",
        "A: No, I'll tell you about that later. Anyway, that one time this was one of the most horrid\nstories I ever saw. A young woman came in and the suspicion was that she had appendix\ninflamed. It just happened that Schnabble walked in and he heard what was going on.\nWhat do you have. See, we had to give them reports, and at one time this one medical\nguy used to stay the doctors have to stay at the stairs. When he comes in in the morning\nto pick up the reports, he doesn't want to get off the bicycle. You had to hand him that\nwhile he was on the run. He was awful, screaming, yelling. Anyway, Schnabble came in\nand found out that girl is complaining about appendix. He decided he is going to operate.\nFelt her around, I think he put rubber gloves on or whether his leather gloves, again, he\nwearing his coat. We set up the surgery in the dental office. He ordered his help, the\nRussian boys should bring some wood, so they brought some wood. It was raining. It was\nsleeting, so I started a fire in that little wooden stove. He assigned my mother to the\nanesthesia. She was his favorite anesthetist. The anesthesia consisted of a little mask, a\nlittle cage that goes and you drip ether drop by drop from the bottle. No other support,\nnothing. Annie was helping him, two guys were standing there, and I think he had one\nother girl, a nurse to assist, and I was the dirty nurse at that time. He opened her up,\ncouldn't find her appendix. He saw something and he said, well, I don't know that looks\nsuspicious, he was ready to cut this out. This was the bladder. It looks like a fish bladder.\nHe poked around. He decided he can't find the appendix. He took all the intestines out.\nAnd the conditions are not sterile exactly. I mean the fire which was going there, it's full\nof soot and he can't find it. Put everything back together, took everything out again. He\nstill can't find her appendix. At that time he barked to one of the guys, go bring Alenluf\n(ph). Alenluf was a Greek doctor, I don't know if he was the main compound or where he\nwas, but he was in the men's camp, and I understand he was a very known surgeon. Well,\na guy went on the bicycle and Doctor Alenluf was running after him. In the meantime,\nwe kind of kept covered and kept the ether slow, not to have her in a deep sleep. I grab\nAlenluf's coat and put a pair of rubber gloves on him. That's what I manage because by\nnow he's very impatient. Alenluf looked in and found the appendix which was not\ninfected at all, and closed her up. She developed peritonitis. For three days that woman\nwas in a coma screaming and he was coming in. He sent morphine. He sent painkillers.\nHe also sent diet soup for her and white bread, but she couldn't eat anything. It lasted\nthree days, and she died. But this was a horror. And you can't say anything, and he's\npulling out all of her intestines out on the table and back into the cavity and back on the\ntable and back in the cavity. It was a horror. And you have to stand there with a poker\nface and don't say a word, nothing. You can't react. And even this Doctor Alenluf, very\ngingerly worked and did whatever he had to do, and he didn't say you did wrong,\nnothing. He just did his job and that's it. This was one of the worst things which I\nwitnessed. Now the funny thing happened with those slovak women. We had a bunch of\nsyringes and we had various -- like I said, you asked about supplies, we would write that\nwe need so and so many bandages and so many aspirins, we need so much -- they would\ncut it down in half, but they would bring us stuff. And we had some pain killers and we\nhad something if someone had an attack of something. We also had babies. There were\nbabies born. We had one woman once who knocked on the door in the middle of the\nnight and said she's in labor, and our administrator went over, Doctor Annie went over to\nthe tower and said, look we have a woman in labor. None of us is a midwife. So, they\ncame in. The two guys, and they went from barrack to barrack and they found a midwife\nand the baby was delivered. I think Schnabble showed up so he called him Joseph Von\nJordan, because there was a ditch over there and he said this is River Jordan. And the\nfollowing day he sent a few diapers and something, there were a few of them, but the\nbaby eventually died because the conditions were so bad that those infants could not\nsurvive. But, they didn't take away the babies. They didn't kill the babies. They didn't do\nany harm to them.",
        "Q: There were a number of babies in the camp?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Were they family camps?",
        "A: That was later that we got into. At that time there were just a few newborn, we had a few\nof them and those slovak women who had their children with them. Anyway, one day I\nneeded my syringes to be sterilized and walked through and the Slovaks had a fire going,\nand I said, \"Would you let me do the syringes here?\" She said, \"Oh, you're so busy. Why\ndon't you let me do it. I'll watch it for you, and I'll do it.\" I said \"Fine.\" I came back. She\nburnt every one of them. Now, this could be considered sabotage. I mean you know you\nhad to really be so careful because here you are burning eight syringes. I was beside\nmyself. I was afraid that Schnabble would come in and want to do something, give them\nan injection, whatever if he said something we had to do it. Well, I didn't know what to\ndo. Finally I got this guy Fisher on the side and he was from Northern Poland originally,\nand we were afraid to speak in front of him because we were afraid he understand Polish\nand I told him. I told him what happened. I said, look I was busy and I took it to them and\nthey burned it and they didn't pay attention. He started bringing, the same day he came in\nthe afternoon, he brought one syringe. Whether he stole them, how he got them within a\nweek I had the whole set of syringes back and he never denounced me. He never said\nanything to Schnabble, nothing. So, even in those conditions there were people who were\na little compassionate. By that time things were getting bad, more transports. I believe\nthis was the time they brought the commandant from Auschwitz and he was cruel.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: I think Horss. And that she's the head and she was blonde and some\nothers. I mean this nasty crew from Auschwitz came.",
        "Q: Do you know about what time, what year that was?",
        "A: This was in '44, had to be around winter of '44, because it was getting cold when we lived\nin Auschwitz, when we had those surgeries. Also, when they were bringing the soups to\nthe hospital, there were a bunch of wild women running around and trying to take the\nsoups, the kettles, so we had to with sticks and stand guard, to escort the people who\nbrought the soup, because they would just eat them and run with them. We needed them\nfor the patients. The camp was getting bigger and bigger, and one day they said they were\ngoing to move all of our patients, and the whole camp first, on the other side of main\nstreet. This was originally a prisoner of war camp, and they had some permanent\nbuildings which were hospital buildings, and they moved first the camp and then they\nmoved the hospital. Our group was assigned to main building number one. It had an\noperating room. It had a dental office. It had some wards. We had like an outpatient\nroom. So, the first order of business was that the operating room had white tile floors and\nwalls. So, the first thing they did, they removed all the tiles, the ceramic tiles, because the\ncommandant wanted that for his bathroom. I believe we had electricity. I can't even\nremember. They must have had electricity because my mother had this sterilizer that was\nan electric sterilizer or she had spirit or something to sterilize the instruments. The dental\noffice was so beautifully equipped that when the Red Cross would come in an examine\nthe camp, that's where they would take them, because there was all the equipment you\nwanted to have. No x-rays, but everything else. There was enough novocain that we were\nafraid if we used up the novocain, the war would never end. Then there must have been a\nroom for the nurses, and then there was room where the doctors lived and Mom took me\nwith her and I shared a bed with her because they wouldn't give me a bed. I was a nurse\nand they wouldn't give me a bed.",
        "Q: So, all along you were living in the hospital?",
        "A: Right, right. And that room was Doctor Annie and a couple of other doctors, Lisa was the\nadministrator, Theresa who was the scribe, then they sent in another dentist, the Russian\ndentist, Larissa. One day, the commandant children governor who was a Seventh Day\nAdventist, was German, they were arrested. She came down with typhus. This was much\nlater, so she was put in with the doctors in that room. That was his orders that she should\nbe kept in that room. We had one surgical ward where people had all kinds of wounds,\nsurgical wounds. Sometimes we had to cut something, and we were getting very little\nsupplies, and I took it upon myself -- because I was working always with Doctor Annie in\nthe outpatient clinic. I very seldom worked the wards. I did very well with the outpatients\nin whatever had to be done. Whenever we got supplies I used to go in to change the\ndressings and you almost needed a gas mask for it. This was stinky, festering thing and\nwe didn't have enough bandages. We didn't get them enough. We couldn't change them\nevery day. Maybe once a week, once in ten days they would bring us the supplies and\nthere was some peroxide and maybe some ointment, maybe some powder to dust on the\nwounds, and I used to get so many blessings when I used to change the dressings. This\nwas the main hospital building. The next one was the nicest building. That's where the\nchildren were. By that time, they took away or send them out or whatever happened to\nthe parents of the Dutch and Belgium children, so they formed an orphanage there, and\nthe Slovak women lived there with their children, and then the few mothers as long as the\nbabies were alive, they lived there. That's were Doctor lived. That place\nwas heated. They gave them some food. They were getting the white soup for the\nchildren. They were getting the white bread, and I have a feeling they must have\ninoculated the children for typhus, because I was not aware of many of them having\ntyphus fever. I know they were inoculating people because at one time Binko and I and\nanother nurse went to one of the subcamps or whatever and those people had passports\nfrom Argentina, from Brazil from Australia. Whether they were real passports, whether\nthey were false passports, we don't know because many of them were Polish Jews. But\nwe went out there when the epidemic started and we were inoculating the whole group\nthere. Then there were two other barracks where one was not so bad and then there was\none which was worse condition and then there was one number 5 where I think there\nwere 500 people dead and 100 dead every day. They would bring the people -- they\nwould just bring them in blankets and leave them there. I mean, people who were in the\ndifferent barracks would just bring them in the blankets, and if there was any hope for\nthem, they were separated and put somewhere else, but those were people like in a\nhospice, they were just dying there. I was very friendly with the head nurse and she had\nshe used to say to me after I had typhus fever come and I'll give you some bread because\nthey didn't eat. She would get and she had a count of 500 so she got 500 pieces of bread\naccording to the count. She said, they're not eating, and you may as well have another\npiece of bread and get some strength.",
        "Q: The dead people, they just dumped them outside?",
        "A: That I'll tell you. When we first came in there was a little morgue not far from the\nhospital buildings. A little concrete structure. Well we started taking the people out.\nEverybody was taking them out. Well, after a while that place would not accommodate\nthe bodies and they didn't have time to take them. It got to a point that it was like a\ntremendous field of dead bodies, and that's what the British finally saw. Families would\nwalk by and look and who do I know there. If the blanket wasn't soiled, we would save\nthe blankets for other people and if they were soiled we left them there. The pile was\ngrowing taller and bigger and bigger and taking more room and they had no -- they could\nnot keep up with removing the bodies. Toward the end when there was this tremendous\nepidemic, they would give people extra soups, they were giving them all kinds of\nprivileges. They would dig ditches and burn the bodies. They just could not keep up with\nit. When the British liberated the camp, the camp took the British General, whoever it\nwas, showing the camp, and naturally they avoided that area. So, there was a bunch of\nnoisy girls and he said, never mind, come here, come here. We didn't speak English, but\nthey said you have to see this place. And the British were flabbergasted seeing that, and\nthey made the German officers remove those bodies. They came so beautiful the first day.\nThey came with their hair done, and their uniforms were so nice and clean and they had\nto handle those bodies, and the deeper they were going, the more decomposed those\nbodies were. Believe me, at the end of the day, they looked as raggedy as most of the\nprisoners. This was horrid. Anyway, the camp was getting bigger. There were transports\ncoming in every few days, and they needed help with the transports. When the transports\ncame in, the able bodies would get a shower and they would place them in camp, but\nthere were some sick people coming in and they were checking who was sick and who is\nnot, so they would need a doctor to ascertain whether the person could be saved. A few\nwere nurses, and I felt so badly, the girls were going out every night one I said, \"I'm\ngoing. I have to help them. I just can't let them work both nights.\" So, we went out. By\nthe time we got there, most of the able bodies they were processed. There was this big\nroom with all kinds of bundles. They made the people leave the bundles and there were\nsick people. Some of them were lame, but we managed to undress them and put their\nclothes in those little fish net bags and once they went through the thing, the steam would\nkill the vermin, and they could go on the other side and find their own clothes. There was\none woman who was in a coma, and the Germans kept saying, \"Throwing her out. She's\nhalf dead, she's dead.\" I kept on shoving her around that place behind some things\nbecause I felt by the time I finished, maybe she'll revive. Whether she was in a diabetic\ncoma, what, a fairly young woman well dressed, and every time they saw me, they said\n\"Come on take her out. Let's take her out. Let the guys take her out.\" So, I was hiding\nher behind bundles, behind anything. Unfortunately the end of the evening we couldn't do\nanything but slap her face. I tried to give her some water. Whatever we tried to do it\ncouldn't revive her, so they took her out. That transport was so full of lice. We got so\nbitten by lice.",
        "Q: Where were most of these transports from?",
        "A: They were from Hungary. I think Poland by that time was clean. They finished with\nthose.",
        "Q: They weren't necessarily coming from Auschwitz?",
        "A: No, no those people were coming with their own clothes and whatever the camp wore.\nThey were not from Auschwitz. They were not from camps. They were wherever they\nlived in. Anyway, then it was getting almost light and they said all right we're finished\nwith you. We can take you back to the barracks. And we said, \"You know, you bathed\neverybody, you deloused them, and here we are crawling with insects. We are bitten all\nover the place and why don't you let us have a shower and delouse us, our clothes,\notherwise we'll bring the whole stuff back to camp.\" They said that's a good idea and\nthey even stoked the fires and we had a nice warm shower.",
        "Q: How often did you shower?",
        "A: We never showered. The first time when they brought you to camp. This was the second\none. Maybe once they took us out. I don't remember.",
        "Q: So, you never washed?",
        "A: Well, we washed. Maybe once they took us to shower, maybe when we're changing\ncamps, I think they marched us. This was a pleasure, this shower, and they took our\nclothes and they deloused them. Three weeks later I came with the typhus fever. I came\nback and I said boy I was bitten and this one doctor was with me and three weeks later, as\nI said, to the day, I came down with it. At first they didn't know what was wrong with me.\nSo, by this time we didn't have Schnabble. We had a young doctor who was wounded at\nthe Russian front. His arm was injured and he was working in camp. They heard that I\nmight have typhus fever, so he and the dentist came to examine me, because they have\nnever seen typhus before, and they figure out that I have it. By that time, the doctors in\nthe room that I slept with they decided they don't want anyone with the typhus fever, so\nthey kicked me out on the ward. But I had my own bed, and I was lying next to a girl who\nused to be a patient of mine. She had t.b. but I tried to keep her on calcitum. The theory\nwas that calcium was good for t.b. and we had calcium, she would get it. Again, she was\na young woman. You tried to help people who were not too far gone. We felt if we could\nhelp them, keep them going for a while, maybe they can keep on going. By that time, the\nepidemic started. The typhus epidemic. It was by the end of the war, this must have been\nFebruary or March and by the end 90 percent of the people had typhus. My fever was\nbuilding up about three weeks. It's like with pneumonia. It build up, if the patient can\nsurvive the crisis. Well, Mom would warm up water in the sterilizer and wash me and\nbring water and wet my lips. And those Slovak ladies made me a little pillow. I'll never\nforget it. This tiny little pillow. They collected some feathers because they thought I was\nso nice to them, and they brought me this. And I kept on saying \"Get the train out of my\nhead, get the train out of my head. I can't stand the train.\" And when they would bring\nthe turnip soup into the room, it was wretched. I couldn't stand it. Finally one night, I\nmust have reached the crisis, and called this woman next door and said \"Get me my\nmother.\" So they woke up the night nurses, got my mother and she came running in and\nthere was a doctor and again we had some supplies. We had something to support the\nheart, just a stimulator heart, and they gave me a shot of it, because I felt I don't know. I\nthink I was dying. Then I got better. In the interim, I just want to bring out the difference\nbetween two doctors. I haven't seen those surgeries because I was so sick. This young\nGerman doctor performed some surgeries. Again, he wanted to learn. He did them in the\noperating room under sterile conditions and he always had this Greek doctor with him.\nSometimes he would I mean people told me about it. Sometimes he would hesitate what\nto do and he would look at the Greek doctor and the Greek doctor would say, \"Well, don't\nyou think you should do this,\" but very diplomatically, and he never offered advice until\nthe guy looked at him. He didn't know where he was going. So, they did perform some\nsurgeries on those people.",
        "Q: So there was actually a somewhat serious effort to cure people?",
        "A: I don't know if it was serious to cure people of if this was a way for him to learn. I mean\nthey never had the chance to -- if he is a very known professor and he is a young doctor\nand maybe he should learn. And he and his pal, the dentist, used to sit in the dental office\nmost of the day. He also had some massages done. First one masseuse and then the other\nfriend of mine, the one who was the head of that very sick ward. She would come in\nbecause he needed physical therapy on his arm. The first time we had the inkling that\nthings were going bad for Germans they were discussing it very quietly. The Russians are\nso and so many kilometers from Berlin and they were afraid of Russians. My mother\noverheard a conversation. Whether that was done to let us know, or they just forgot about\nher working because she ignored them, that's when we knew things were happening. By\nthe time, close to the liberation, there was cholera there. There was a raging epidemic of\ntyphus. There was all kinds of sickness and less supplies and less food. One day this\nother doctor, I think it was called up over lined us up -- we didn't have\nwater, I don't think we had bread. He said times are very bad but you cannot abuse your\npatients, you have to take care of them. He was trying to give us a pep talk how to take\ncare of our patients. How ridiculous. One day one of the guards -- I somehow suspected\nwhether they were experimenting with our lives. One day a young woman came in and\nshe had a turban, a very tightly wrapped turban around her head and she said she's\nitching. We took off the turban, her head was so covered with lice, like you see, you have\na big ant hill and you kick it apart and you see the ants coming out. I'm talking about big\nant hills. I mean, you couldn't see the hair. So, we cut it and put some disinfectant. We\nhad some anti-lice things, burned the hair outside, the whole thing, and I was wondering\nif by any chance if they did not decide that this is a fast way of doing it. Because they\nwere all inoculated. The Germans were all inoculated. After the war, I think some of\nthem got typhus, when they were handling the bodies, but they were very well isolated\nand inoculated. Whether they tried this, I don't know because I don't know how anyone\ncould have lived with that mess, and the way the turban was wrapped around her head, it\nwas a young woman. It was -- I've never seen anything like it. I'm telling you you see a\nant hill, a big one, and this is what is creepy. So, as I said, toward the end, there were so\nmany sick people. So many people dying, and you couldn't do a thing for them. Yes,\nthere was an effort to save them, every once in a while they had the surgeons that wanted\nto do something, but I don't think this was so much an effort to save them. I have a\nfeeling that this was an opportunity for the doctors to learn. Schnabble was just learning\nwhatever he wanted to do. I don't know what happened to him. He disappeared.",
        "Q: You mentioned a name \"Kramer.\" Isn't Kramer someone who also came from Auschwitz\nand replaced Horss?",
        "A: I don't know whether he replaced Horsss. I don't know. I think Horss was caught in\nBergen-Belsen. I really don't know.",
        "Q: This Kramer then was head of the camp?",
        "A: I know there was someone by the name of Kramer gave us a pep talk. I never seen Horss.\nI know of him, but I have never seen him.",
        "Q: Before we get to the end, I just want to ask you a couple questions. It sounds like you had\ncontact with people, prisoners from a lot of different surroundings, is that true?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Not so much from the other camps, but just with transports?",
        "A: The transports were coming in and this woman became the main camp. They would\nbreak out the fences between some other camps and that became a huge, huge, huge\ncamp.",
        "Q: So, then a lot of the subcamps got combined?",
        "A: Right. The Dutch and the Belgium camp, that was combined with ours. The Indonesia,\nno. What happened to the prisoner of wars or whatever, we took over those parts of the\nbuilding, I don't know what happened to them. I know the Russians were there.",
        "Q: When you were more integrated were the conditions and relationship also integrated or\ndid certain people just stay with their own.",
        "A: I think they stayed more or less within their own barracks. They had to stay\nand they were allowed to come to the hospital, but otherwise, I don't think there were any\nsocial activities there at that time.",
        "Q: Did you develop strong relationships with the other people you were working with?",
        "A: Some of them, yes. And there were a lot of strong relationship in terms of there was one\nof the nurses and she was very friendly with a couple of girls. She lived --she didn't live\nwith us. She lived with a couple of girls. One of them was the head, a block elder, and\nshe lived with them. They were like sisters. That was the thing. People were developing\nrelationships and if they were like sisters, they could help each other. Some of the\ndoctors, there were two, one of them died, so we were friendly later on, my mother and I,\nand we have seen her after the war and were together in Sweden. We maintained contact\nwith those people because we were together and there were a lot of relationships like this.\nPeople would adopt each other. Those were ones who had the easiest way of surviving,\nbecause when one was very sick, the other one helped them. We had friends, two sisters,\none is now in Brazil, one lives in California, and they were together, and one of them I\ndon't remember which one, she was so sick that the older sister would chew a piece of\nbread, because the bread was hard and she would chew a piece of bread and shove it in\nthe sister's mouth to make her so she could swallow it, and that's how they made it. So,\nthere were all kinds of pieces of kindness. And when I was so sick that that girl who I\nused to take care of before, she was the one who basically, because the nurses wouldn't\ndo much for me. They were busy. But she was conscious, she was not very sick. That's\nwhy they placed me there and she kept an eye on me. If I needed anything, the sicker I\nwas getting, she would take a sip of water and put it in my lips or wet something and put\nit on my lips and she was in a way taking care of me. She didn't do physically anything,\nshe was in bed, but she was kind of keeping an eye -- she was the one who alerted them\nthat I was coming down with the crisis, so she did help me. Mom got typhus later. I mean\nall the doctors got sick. I mean everybody was sick. The sign was if you spilled your\nwater like we had this French doctor, she had a bed above us, and the sign was that if you\nstarted taking water at night to bed and then spill it over head she had typhus. We knew\nthat she had. There were certain symptoms. I could recognize someone with the typhus\njust looking at them. Later on, the British doctors, they had no idea what's wrong with a\npatient. I said the trembling, the lip trembling, people didn't even have the spots, there\nwere certain symptoms you could just recognize they had typhus.",
        "Q: Certainly you've read stories and heard stories in camps about people that the need for\nsurvival --",
        "A: There was stories about it that there were. I never witnessed it but there were stories\nabout cannibals.",
        "Q: People would steal from each other?",
        "A: Oh, yes. It was known. If someone was unconscious they put a piece of bread in front of\nthem so they would steal it. This was, as I said, the will to survive. But it got so bad that\nthey were walking to camp, they were walking to the hospital and they were just\ndefecating.",
        "Q: This was another interesting thing I read in your testimony. When I read about Bergen-\nBelsen I guess towards the end it sounded as if, not from your testimony, but from\nelsewhere, that nobody really took care of anybody?",
        "A: Basically, no.",
        "Q: The authorities of the camp really didn't make any provisions to feed, to clothe, to house?",
        "A: Well, they were housed. There were barracks. Clothes, whatever they came with, and\nthere were some people working. As I said, when the people came in with their own\nclothes, the good stuff was taken away. They had big warehouses when the war ended.\nThe prisoners broke into those warehouses and everybody was carrying all kinds of\nclothing. One of the funniest thing this Russian dentist with his boyfriend and my mother\ndidn't know what happened, she was just recuperating from typhus and this guy walked\nin in a top hat, tuxedo with tails and a white scarf around his neck. He was one of the\nRussians. They were the first ones to break into the warehouses and he thought he looked\nvery snazzy in that outfit, this was after the war. But the war was a field of dead. There\nwere people dying by the thousands every day and they would just dump them out and\nthere was no way no matter what the Germans tried to do to bury them, and they would\nbring crews to the prisoners. They fed them extra, they forced them to work. There was\ntasks that they could not keep up. I think there were two graves when they finally cleaned\nout the camp, one I don't know how many thousands of people buried in those graves,\nmass graves.",
        "Q: What percentage of people do you think came through the hospital at one time or\nanother? You were treating women, correct?",
        "A: Yes. I don't know. I don't know. We had lines every day. As a matter of fact, after we\nwere liberated they took everybody to Bergen, but in the meantime the British helped us\nclean up some of -- they whitewashed some of the buildings, and I stayed another month\nor so, maybe another few weeks. No, we liberated the 15th of April, the 8th of May I was\nstill in the old place and they gave us new blankets and we were still admitting people\nand still taking care of it because the healthy ones they could process and take to Bergen,\nwhich was a military camp, and they placed them there. The sick ones, they had a whole\nprocedure they had to -- and they were magnificent. They would take them in and they\nwould bathe them on stretches and they would shower them and they cleaned their heads.\nAnd they were basically British soldiers and dress the wounds and place them in hospital\nbarracks. This was a very slow process. In the meantime, people were coming in. They\nneeded help now, and by that time we had some supplies. So, we were admitting some of\nthem and we were treating some of them on an outpatient basis, but at least we had some\nbandages and supplies. We had some medications. If they had a headache, we could give\nthem aspirin. I mean things like this, and they were still getting sick. They were still\ngetting typhus. That thing was still raging, and the British soldiers were all inoculated\nand toward the end there was a rumor they were going to evacuate the camp, like they did\nin Auschwitz. There was a march. There was a group that went on trains, and I think the\ntrains were bombed, and I think some of the Dutch Jews perished that way. Anyway,\nthere was a rumor that the camp is mine and they are going to evacuate the camp and\nwhoever can walk and the rest of the people will go, and the girls came over to me, the\nnurses that wanted to distribute some of the medicine what you have and the syringes and\neverything and they said, \"Are you going to walk?\" I said, \"No, I'm not leaving Mom,\nand she can't walk. I'm staying no matter what happened.\" Well, that night we had\nbombs and they bombed this was Lindenberg, the Allies bombed a nearby town and a\nday or two later we saw all the Germans walking -- the British didn't come in yet, but\nthey were walking with the white arm bands and for some reason I was sent out to either\nget the soup or get some supplies and I was passing the baths, the sauna and our favorite\nthe guy, the pig, this German, he was burning paper in this sauna, in the furnace. They\nwere very nice. They were still in charge, and they came in and they wore the arm bands,\ndidn't discuss anything, but at the same time the day the British came in there was a cook,\na German cook in one of the kitchens, and they were supposed to be working. He said, I\nhave another few bullets and I'm going to shoot all the Jews. He killed a girl, wounded\none, and the British were not in, the Germans were half way in and out. By that time we\nwere guarded by Hungarians. The guards were all released, outside guards. And there\nwas a group of Hungarians and they were guarding the camp with the guns. This was a\nGerman, and they felt, they swore that they are going to get themselves some Jews. One\nof the girls was brought in. She walked out, she said, \"We are free. We are liberated.\"\nBang, and she was gone. What has happened, when the British came in the 15th of April\nthe tank went through, waved the flag, everybody say hooray and they went out and we\nare still prisoners until they finally came in and started checking. Well, it was in the\nafternoon, they just went in until they could organize themselves. Then they discovered\nthe bodies so they called all the officers and the soldiers and they had to remove the\nbodies. Some of the girls were nuts. They were distributing the food in metal cans and\nthey were rusting. One of the girls saved the rations which was pretty awful and rotten\nand become spoiled and she wanted one of the Germans to eat it. And the Germans were\nguarded by the British because otherwise the mob would have torn them apart. There was\na language problem, but this one somehow managed to convey to the British soldier that\nshe doesn't want to do any harm. She just wants that German to eat that food, and he\nmade him eat it. The funny thing is, I went once to see this removal of the bodies. It was\na frantic scene. The girls were screaming and yelling and hollering and they wanted to\npull on the Germans. I went once to see it, but I just couldn't do it. I also went out, I think\none day after they liberated us and I went out -- the gates between the compounds were\nopen. The main street was open. That's where you saw this unbelievable mob of people\nwalking with all kinds of clothing because they broke into the depots and whatever they\ncould wear, the funniest outfits and funny things, and people were milling, looking for\nfriends and that's how I went to the men's place, the men's camp to look for people from\nmy town and people who I knew, and I found this one boy who had a very bad eye\ninfection and got him doctors and got him to a hospital. He lost his eye but he survived.\nHe's alive. He lives in California.\nTape #4",
        "Q: We started talking about liberation. I wondering if the Germans were sensing what was\nhappening and if there treatment of you changed, if you could feel their fear?",
        "A: Well, once the bombing took place nearby, a couple of days before the British came in,\nand that's where the German headquarters surrendered and therefore the Germans were\nwearing the white armbands. They were ready for take over and by that time, except the\ncrazy shooters, the ones we were in contact with, they were okay. Even the one that was\nscreaming, he was always quiet. I saw him burn the papers and I don't remember why I\nwent out, either to pick up some supplies because we still could not walk between the\ncompounds on the main street, but for some reason I was sent for something, I think we\nwere sent to the kitchen for soups. By that time they were not delivering and that's why I\nwent with a group of girls, and that's when I saw him burning those papers frantically.\nThey were packing and he didn't even see us.",
        "Q: They weren't trying to convince you how nice they were or anything like that?",
        "A: No, I don't think so. I understand that the dentist somehow got some testimony of various\nprisoners. They never approached us. This was one person I would have given him a\nclean bill of health. He was arrested, but then he was released because he really didn't do\nanything ever.",
        "Q: Do you remember how you felt when the British arrived?",
        "A: Unbelievable feeling of relief. Just went out to see them and we all went out to see them.\nFirst the people came in and said the British tank went in. I think I've seen the British\ntank. They were shooting, so we were afraid to walk around. The Germans were still\nshooting and the Hungarians were still watching. You couldn't go outside of the camp\nand after they finally took all the guns from those Germans, then you went out. That's\nwhen I went to the main, on the main street and I saw this unbelievable motley crew of\npeople. Some of them were still dying. Some of them were hardly moving. There were\nbodies around, but whoever could move, they were moving. They were walking, and they\nwere smiling. And unfortunately, there were so many people who died still after the\nliberation. It was incredible.",
        "Q: How did the British treat you?",
        "A: The liberators treated us very nice. The first day they decided we are starving so they\nbrought soup, and the soup was very rich, and we all ate the soup and all got deathly ill.\nOur bodies could not absorb this fat, so everybody got sick. We overate that soup. It was\na thick, I remember, with a coat of fat on top. They were very anxious to help us. The\nBritish would as I aid the British soldiers as such they were beautiful towards the\npatients. The British officers they were just -- later on they were funny, we had to fight\nthem, but in the beginning they were just very compassionate it. Then they realized that\nthe food they were giving us we can not take this very rich food, so they started giving us\nlike a diet food for a while until we could adjust. They were giving us those little K\nrations. They were giving us cigarettes and chewing gum and some lemonade and some\ncookies and were giving some tins of those cookies. I decided to smoke a cigarette. Mom\nsaid, I don't want you to smoke until after the war. The war was still on, so the 8th of\nMay and I was sitting and the cannons and you could hear the war was over and there\nwere announcements and stuff like this. I took a package of those -- I had a whole bunch\nof those little player cigarettes and I was smoking one after another. She said, I told you\nnot to smoke. She was so sick, she said I told you not to smoke. I said, \"Mom, the war is\nover. I'm smoking.\" This was like an act of rebellion.",
        "Q: How come you remained in the camp for a while after the British liberated you?",
        "A: They needed some people to be still there because as I said, the transfer of the patients\nwas such a slow one they needed us. It took them a while, maybe a week, ten days, two\nweeks. I don't know. And she was so sick, so I stayed. I couldn't move her. By the time\nwe got to Bergen, they didn't have any more room, so there was this huge officers' casino\nand they converted this to a hospital. This was the end of everybody in Bergen. And they\nhad this huge ballroom, it held about 170 beds. The place was gorgeous. It was a round\nbuilding. They called it the round house. Out of the ballroom, there was a magnificent\nterrace. And Rhododendron blooming around, it was just gorgeous. There were a couple\nrooms where they had the casino, but they removed all the tables and they patients there.\nI think the paper I gave you was signed by this doctor who became the head of this thing.\nAt that time our staff consisted of British doctors. They were volunteers, second or third\nyear medical students.",
        "Q: Your hospital was transferred to the town of Bergen?",
        "A: Well, there were a lot of buildings to the hospital, but this was the very, very end of it,\nbecause they were transferring people all the time, but this was the very end. There must\nhave been about 250, 300 patients at that time.",
        "Q: Did they burn down or do anything with the old quarters?",
        "A: I'll tell you that. So, we had rooms there. Mom started working a little bit there was a\ndental office there, but she had swollen legs. She was just working a few hours a day.\nThey had the most beautifully equipped kitchen I have ever seen. I don't know if many\nfancy restaurants here have kitchens, fully electric, they could cook a few hundred eggs\nat the same time. They had frying pans they could turn upside down by touching a button.\nIt was just unbelievable. There were naturally, a couple of elderly Germans running that\nkitchen for us. They claimed that they never knew anything about it. As I started telling\nyou there was the British doctor who was the head. A few British nurses, we had British\nvolunteer students at that time. A bunch of us, a few French nuns came from France and\nthey brought in a bunch of German nurses, and there was one ward with people with t.b.,\ndiarrhea, as sick as they come. The British assigned our girls to that room, and the room\nthat had 170 beds they were basically convalescing, and they gave the German nurses\nthis. And we went on strike. The rationale was that since some of the very sick people\ncannot don't know what's going on and the Germans may harm them and we will be much\nmore compassionate to them. Our argument was that we all went through typhus. We are\nall very weak, and there's no reason for us to be exposed at this point to t.b. and diarrhea\nand we should be assigned the convalescent, which was a much lighter load and let the\nGermans work there. So, we went on strike. We had a translator girl who spoke English\nand finally got through his head that this was the right thing to do. But he was very much\nafraid what will happen. We said we will supervise. We'll check, and the nurses were\nbusting because they were all registered nurses. We were all a motley crew. We didn't\nhave uniforms, I mean, like a butcher's apron. We had nothing, and we were watching\nwhat they were doing. Another thing I was very happy to do, they would send the women\nfrom the town from Bergen to clean the hospital and we had this was the ballroom, it had\na gorgeous parquet floor and we made them wash the floor twice a day. They would\ncome in the morning to clean, and they would come in the afternoon to clean, and God\nforbid that they left a dry spot. Wash it, the German word was . I couldn't\nspeak German very well, but this was a funny feeling, you know, I was in charge. So,\nlittle by little our big ward would empty because they were getting better and getting out.\nThe British, I started telling you about the British soldiers even before when they had this\nblister disease. Once, I remember one of the young fellows came and he was getting\nready, he found a patient with a blister thing and he was getting ready for a serious\nsurgery. I took him on the side, I said you are the doctor, I'm not, but we have had such\nexperience with it, you don't have to do serious surgery, just make sure you lance it and\ndrain it and then if you have -- they didn't have antibiotics but I think sulfur or whatever\nthey had, something to dress the wound and she'll be okay, because she didn't have\ntremendous blisters. He did it. They were still students. A lot of them got sick. They left\nand we had a group of Belgium medical students, volunteers and they were not treated by\nthe British very well. They used to mooch the cigarettes from us because we used to have\nall the cigarettes from the British. We were getting those packets every day. Somehow\nthey resented that. Those guys, I think they were older, and they were just very good,\ntrying to help the people and take care of them. The British burned Bergen-Belsen as they\nemptied it. They left one building standing and I don't know when there was a ceremony\nand we were invited, taken in by trucks. I think there is a picture at the Holocaust\nMuseum of that ceremony. This was when they raised the words of General Glen Hughes\nwho was the Second British Army. He said that now they can raise the British flag\nbecause this awful place doesn't exit any more and the ceremony was that they threw\nflame throwers burned the last barrack. Whether the administration building still stands, I\ndon't know, but this was the last thing and they raised the British flag over it because they\nnever raise a British flag over a place as horrid as Bergen-Belsen.",
        "Q: Did they burn it just for the horror of it, or did because they wanted to burn off the\ndisease?",
        "A: They wanted to burn off the disease. They were burning them as soon as they were\nempty. They were afraid. I mean the whole German population.",
        "Q: So, your life started becoming a bit more normal?",
        "A: Right. We were there until July and they had a movie and the survivors could go to the\nmovies during the day. The British soldiers it was there for the British soldiers at night,\nbut I was working during the day, so I was invited by the Belgs -- the Belgs could go at\nnight, so they would invite me to go to the movies. I was a young girl.",
        "Q: Do you remember what the first movie is you saw?",
        "A: I think with Esther Williams. A funny thing happened. One day they said they are going\nto hand someone, some Nazi somewhere nearby. Let's go, let's go see it. So, I said to\nMom, I'm going. Where are you going? I don't know, to Ludenberg. So one of the girls\nsaid oh we have a truck. There was one woman and three or four of us that went. There\nwas no hanging. We couldn't get a way back. There was no way of getting back. Finally\nwe found there was some camp under the Poles and four or five women invited us. They\nhad some food. They gave us their beds and we stayed with them at night. They gave us\nfood, and the following day we are trying to get in the worst way to go back to Bergen.\nWe are standing on the corner and there is a mob of people looking for transport and we\ntried to get anything you can. At that time, there was who became\nthe head of Bergen. He married Ms. Bimko. He knew my mother. They used to play\ncards together, whatever. He knew her. There was another guy, a British officer, who\nused to hang around, used to play bridge with a bunch of people in our hospital and he\nheard that I disappeared, that I went somewhere and there was no way of calling. There\nwas no way of doing something. And they had a vague idea of where I went with those\nwomen, but where did we go, Ludenberg. They were all very concerned and I'm standing\non the corner with those few women who is passing by but this British officer. His name\nwas Eric, on a motorcycle. I started hollering, Eric. He said you know the whole world is\nlooking for you. I said, well, we can't get back. No one wants to take us back. We can't\ncommunicate. We can't go back. So, he stopped the truck, on after another finally found\nout where they are going whether they can take us back. He said they'll take us back. So,\nwe get on the truck and there are some soldiers in the back and they are driving and\ndriving and they take us somewhere else and we said Where are you taking us?\" As I\nsaid, we couldn't speak English. Finally they explained to us that at a certain time those\nsoldiers have to be on the base otherwise they'll be AWOL, which I didn't know what the\nword means, but they explained that they had to be back. Once they will be taken back to\ntheir posts, then we'll be taken to Bergen. This was one of the high drinx after the war,\nwhat I did. Trying to be normal, being almost a normal teenager. I was 19, but still being\na normal, all of a sudden an act of rebellion , get out do something adventurous, naughty.",
        "Q: Free?",
        "A: Free, that's exactly what it was.",
        "Q: How did you get to Sweden? Why did you decided to go there?",
        "A: Well, what has happened at that time, Swedish government invited \"x\" amount of people\nto go and they needed doctors and nurses and dentists to go along to take care of the\npatients, so we signed up. They took us to , and that was also funny.\nThey had to clean us out, so they had two tents, one for the men and for one for the\nwomen and this friend of ours was a doctor got very friendly on the train going to\nand he came through and he said, \"You know, the women were washing\nme.\" And they made the German men, wash the women. They wanted to punish the\nGermans in a way, I don't know. They didn't try to punish us. We just decided the hell\nwith it. They're not meant to us. I mean, this was the thing, don't get shocked. Don't get\nshocked, they're not men. They're Germans, they're not even human beings. Let them\nwash us and that's all, because they really had to scrub us and they took us on a boat at\nnight. They gave us army coats and we sat on the deck at night, wool blankets or\nsomething else. It was very lovely. They fed us. They put us first in a place called\n. It was a school, and they kept us in quarantine. They boys were hanging\nthrough the windows looking for us, looking for girls, making dates the moment they let\nus out. There were all kinds of dates, and then they took us to another camp in\n. They started assigning people to work, so we were assigned to Northern\nSweden. This is, you see, talking about groups against groups. Even in camps they were\nfighting. After the liberation, there were incidents between the Poles and the Jews. In\nSweden, the camp that we were assigned to, my mother knew a man who really liked her\nand he said, oh I know a dentist, we need a dentist here and there were 200 Jews and 400\nPoles in the camp. They requested Mom by name. We didn't want to go to Northern\nSweden, but we had to go because they were requesting her not just a dentist, they\nwanted her. By that time, there was a nurse, so I was signed up as her assistant. We got\nthere and the Jews were going. What has happened? They were fighting. There was such\nincidents, such fighting, such name calling, that they took the Jews out and took them to\nanother camp. The Poles were so nasty and so anti-semitic. So even there, after that\nhappened, they were charming to us, I mean I was a Miss, but the Jews could not live in\nthat camp with the Poles. So, even then, and this is July August in '45, they still didn't\nhave enough.",
        "Q: You decided to go onto Sweden rather than go back to Poland?",
        "A: We definitely didn't want to go to Poland. I had an aunt here who left Germany before the\nwar. We wrote to her the first letter, turned out she got it. We gave it to some British\nsoldier to send it out, but she couldn't write to us in Germany. The moment we got to\nSweden, the first we went and put an application to the United States, so our order was\nvery long. We registered before even contacting, establishing contact with the family,\nand I found a crazy thing happened. My mother had some cousins and we\nknew one of them in New York. They were in the advertising business. He came to\nPoland before the war, and we wrote a letter to David Glicksman in New York. Well,\nDavid Glicksman changed his name to David Gipson. His brothers didn't, but he changed\nit. He lived in Manhattan and there must have been some kind of a dead letter office in\nNew York, and after the war they must have been opening those letters and tracing\npeople down. The letter was written in German. He got the letter. My aunt lived in\nWashington. He called her up. A few days before I had an uncle, my mother had an\nbrother in France who survived, and he contacted the family so we got established a\ncontact and in a few days money was coming in and packages were coming in and\ntelegrams were coming in and May 1946 we came here.",
        "Q: Let me just ask you a few general questions. We just a have a couple more minutes. It\nseems like your early days, your affluence, your family education, all of that really\nhelped you survive the war years?",
        "A: I think so. I think so. The fact that Mom was a dentist so she always either made money\nor later on we were in the position to be sheltered a little bit more. The fact that I worked\nwith Grandfather during the years in Ghetto, I really was very good at outpatient. I\nwanted to be a surgeon. I was very interested in medicine, and I was good at it, but when\nI came here I found out that I had to go back to school for a couple of years and by that\ntime, I didn't have the means to go to medical school, and I really didn't want to go to be\na nurse.",
        "Q: When things were really, really difficult during those years, and there was a lot of\ndepravation, what do you think sustained you?",
        "A: I think the family unit. The fact that we had the grandparents. We had to take care of\nthem. The first few years in Ghetto, we had to take care of the older people, no matter\nwhat. I mean we took care of my grandfather and he was such an unusual person. He was\na felcher and then he was grown up and then he went to dental school and became a\ndentist. He was extremely educated, self, well read and self educated extremely wise\nman, very much a head of his time. He believed in all kinds of inventions. He believed in\nall modern gadgets. The first modern gadget came in , I think my grandmother had one of\nthe first electrical irons. Things like this, he was very much. He said there are ships\nwaiting in America. Any moment they'll liberate us. They'll come in with food. They'll\ninvent a pill that you won't have to eat anything. You'll just be able to take a pill and it\nwill keep you going for a day. Little did he realize the to eat was very pleasant.",
        "Q: And the family unit sustained you because you lived with your mother?",
        "A: I lived with my mother. As I said, when the times she was sick, I would take care of her,\nwhen I was sick, she would take care of me. We watched each other.",
        "Q: Did that sort of help you not to feel so isolated from the world?",
        "A: I think so. I had her. I was very close to her.",
        "Q: When you think back, fifty years ago, your experiences, is there one haunting image? Is\nthere something you think?",
        "A: There is anger. I get angry. I watch something and I said how dare they do that to us.\nHow dare they made us subhumans. I mean we're human beings and what audacity to\ntreat us the way they treated us. What nerve they had to kill us. I mean it's such it doesn't\nmean if I meet a German I'm nasty to them, but I have a deep burning anger of why they\ndid it. What human being has a right to do to other human beings. I mean we watch those\nthings and we see those children. What right do people have to do it. But he was such a\nsystematic deliberate and also the question of dehumanizing us. People say why did you\nsubject yourself. They did it little by little. Layers, they took layers, they took our\napartment, they took the house, they took the privileges. They kicked us out from the\nhouse. They put us in the Ghetto. From the good conditions we wound up pour and no\nway of taking a bath and no way to shower yourself, living in that one room and\ngradually worse and worse and worse. It wasn't like they took someone from a very fancy\nhouse and put them in camp. Those people didn't survive, for the most part. They broke\ndown immediately. They did it deliberately and gradually. One step at a time, one\nhumiliation. The fact when we got to Auschwitz and they undressed us and we had to\nmarch in front of men. And the women, there were religious women, elderly women,\nyoung girls, and I was a young girl. I never undressed myself in front of any one. Here I\nhad to march naked in front of a bunch of men. This is all humiliation. This is all making\npeople subhuman. This is slowly and slowly and slowly so you had no we didn't have the\nstrength to fight them. There was no way of fighting them. I mean sure there was uprising\nin Warsaw Ghetto, but there was no movement in Lodz Ghetto like this and\nsaw to it. There was no such thing as revolution and I get angry. I get\nvery angry. That's why I'm doing this, why I'm speaking to people. I want to leave the\nhistory. I want that to be part of my history.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you want to say?",
        "A: No, do you have any questions.",
        "Q: There was no thought of resistance or rebellion at ?",
        "A: No. We were busy. We were busy and then the sickness. It was overwhelming, just like a\nflood. There was no dike, you could put your finger in and you couldn't do anything. You\ntried to do something, but there was nothing. We had no means to help the people. If they\nsurvived, they survived. If they didn't survive, you couldn't do anything. Some cousin,\nmy mother's cousin I found in one of the barracks, tried to get her something. The fever\ntook over, the typhus took over and she died. I mean, you were helpless.",
        "Q: But you must have felt you helped people.",
        "A: Oh, you tried. As I said the question was 1f someone wasn't very sick we could help them.\nIf we had the means, if we had the dressing, we had the pill we could give it them, maybe\nthey'll survive.",
        "Q: Thank you very much.",
        "A: You're welcome.\n"

        "A: All right. My name is Rita Kerner Hilton. I was born in Warsaw in 1926, July 22, 1926. I\nlived in Warsaw until I was six years old, seven years old, and then we moved to my\nmother's hometown Pomortsy. This is near Lodz, exiled city. My grandfather was a\npracticing dentist there and since my mother was a dentist, they decided to practice\ntogether. That's where I lived until the war broke out and the Ghettos and so on.",
        "A: When I was a small girl, my parents were doing very well financially. My father was a\nentrepreneur. My mother wasn't working at that time, and we always had a maid. I had a\nnanny when I was small. When we moved into Pomortsy, my grandmother was running\nthe house, but she always had sleep-in help. Since my mother worked in the office, it was\nin the same apartment, I had a babysitter, or whoever it was, a part-time governess who'd\ncome in after school hours and do homework with me and read with me, take me out to\nthe park. So, I had kind of a pampered existence. I went to sleep-away camp. I had a\nbicycle which was, you know, they were expensive. So, I did have a very loving, a very\npampered existence at that time.",
        "A: No. My grandfather strongly believed in reformed Judaism, which did not exist in Poland\nas such. They never kept a kosher home. We did observe holidays. We observed\nPassover, and he used to go to the synagogue on high holidays, sometimes would take\nme, but it was different. He strongly felt that if there would be a reformed Judaism then\nhe could probably follow it. He could not follow the orthodox, the rabbis teachings, and\nargue with some of them about it.",
        "A: Well, I went to a public school, which was hard to get in, but this was the best -- I'm\ntalking about primary school. We lived in a so-called new section of town, not the Jewish\nsection, a new section of town. There were maybe about few Jewish kids there, mostly\nfrom the prominent families, doctors, lawyers and stuff like this, dentists. And when I\nfirst came, I remember one of those days a kid called me a dirty Jew. I was a big girl, I\nwas in first grade, and I gave a smack to the right and a smack to the left, and I never had\nany problem in that school. When the time came to go to high school, there were three\nhigh schools in town. A girls' school, a boys' school and a German school. This town was\nvery much German. There were a lot settled by the Germans. They were German textile\nmarkets. This was a textile factory town. And they were having every year there were\nless Jewish kids accepted there. You had to pass an exam, and you had to be the top of\nthe top of the top to get into that school. If you couldn't get in, you had to commute to\nLodz, which was a 45 minute ride by street car. You had to go to private school then\nwhich was costly. Well, I got into that school. And again the first few days someone said\nsomething about being a Jew, but the principal of the school, she was very anti-semitic,\nbut she was very fair, and she did not stand for any discrimination. And again, I had no\nproblem. I had a bunch of friends, but little by little, I mean, there was one girl, later on,\nshe was in camp with me, Alena, and we used to fight like cats and dogs, but at the same\ntime we were the only Jewish kids in the same level, Jewish girls on that level. The year\nbefore they accepted I think three or four or five. Our year they accepted three, the\nfollowing year they accepted two. The boys had a harder time in school. There were a\ncouple boys who were sons of prominent doctor and they took his penis and dipped it in\nink, and also there was a doctor upstairs, a friend of my parents, they had a younger kid.\nHe started going to the same school that I did, but they taunted him and he started losing\nclumps of hair from nervousness, and they had to place him in Jewish schools. The\nJewish schools were state schools, but the principals, the teachers, the kids were Jewish,\nand there were two schools. One was the better one, and the other one wasn't so good.\nBut still, in order to get to the high school, if you came from the Polish school, your\nchances of getting into the high school were much better than if you came from the\nJewish school. You know, separated, but equal. And I had, as I said, had not too much\nproblems.",
        "A: At one time I know my mother used to go to all those fancy charity balls, a lot of them.\nAnd I think closer to the war, there were a couple Jewish charity balls. I think she still\nused to go to the Red Cross ball and so on. But there were less social contact. My mother\nhad a friend, a school friend, who was of a German decent, a very, very prominent\nfamily. They owned big factories, and she married a Polish boy. They were patients for\nyears and years and years. They used to socialize, and then closer to the war, that dried\nout. We didn't have those contacts as such.",
        "A: Oh, yes. My aunt lived in Germany. They came to the States before the war. They knew\nit was coming on. Also, there was a group of Polish people who lived in Germany, never\nhad their German passports. They were never citizens, and in 1937, they all sent them out\nand we used to collect money for them. We used to give them meals and so on, because\nthey were thrown out from Germany without anything. So, we were aware very much of\nwhat was going on. But no one believed it was going to happen, what happened, because\nduring the first World War, the Germans were the better friends than the Russians.\nPeople did not like Russians in this part of Poland. So, we were aware, but we never\nthought they would destroy us all.",
        "A: One of the first actions they put a bunch of restrictions. We couldn't use the street cars.\nWe couldn't use the cafe downstairs where everybody used to sit. No Jews were allowed\nthere. We couldn't go to the park. Schools were closed. I don't know when they told us to\nwear the -- before the stars, I think we had to wear the yellow armbands. There were\nscenes downstairs, I see through the window that they would grab a Jew witha \u2014_\u2014_ and\ncut the and cut the beard. And usually it was young kids doing it. The Hitler\nYouth were like a bunch of little puppies jumping on. This was the beginning. Then they\nstarted -- see we knew we would not be able to stay in the apartment. This was a fancy\nsection of town, and it was a very large apartment. What has happened was a crazy\nsituation and part of the apartment someone sublet it, it was a subleased to people who\nowned the cafe downstairs. They were German Nationals. And they requested that\nsection. So, we managed to get some furniture out because we were evacuated not by the\nGermans, but by this owner of the restaurant, the cafe. So, my mother got out some of her\nextra, one extra chair and a foot drill and some equipment and we got some furniture\nfrom that part of the apartment out, and we have hidden it. Some Pole took it for us. And\nwe did manage to get some valuables out, which eventually we left with the Poles. We\nnever saw it again. But at that time we -- and we kind of waited, when they are going to\nkick us out. And sure enough, the order came in 24 hours we had to leave beddings for 12\nbeds, all the china, all the furniture, all the equipment in the office. Everything had to be\nleft. We were allowed only to take our personal clothing. That's when we moved. That\nPole he promised us it would be out of town, a little suburban area, very quiet. Nothing\nwill happen to us, and then he -- the Jews were not allowed to have money, \"X\" amount\nof German marks, no gold, no silver, no diamonds, and when they started talking about\nforming the Ghetto in he persuaded my grandfather that he's going to save\nfor safekeeping, he'll take all his valuables. And Grandfather had all his money in a gold\nmoney belt. His total life savings were in those gold coins. American dollars, British\nsterling pounds, everything in gold. So, he left it with the Pole, and after the Ghetto was\nformed, we couldn't get out, but we sent someone to pick it up, and he denied that he had\never had it. We never saw that stuff again.",
        "A: At that time, yes. At that time, he was so -- seemed like my father knew him and we\nknew him. We stayed with him. We paid rent, but we stayed with him for a couple of\nmonths. There was also a situation where we wanted to go to Warsaw. My mother\ndecided to smuggle herself, smugglers and go to Warsaw. She had some fabrics she felt\nshe'll take it to Warsaw and sell it maybe live on it for a while. Our relatives in Warsaw\nwanted ut to move there. They felt that this was not German, this was the protector at this\npart of Poland at that time. So, she went. She had a fur coat, and covered in fabric and\nwent and was stopped somewhere and all the smuggled goods were taken away. We\ndidn't know what happened, but they let them out. This was a put up. They just wanted to\nget the goods. So, a few days later she came home, luckily for us.",
        "A: No. The fear was when we were all running to Lodz before the Germans came. I don't\nthink people were so fearful. It's hard to say how they felt. We all didn't know what\nwould happen. By 11th of November, this is a Polish holiday, and just before they\narrested all the prominent people in town, not only Jews, they arrested Poles, they\narrested anyone, teachers, lawyers, bankers, whoever had any prominence so they\ncouldn't start any uprising. They wouldn't stir the population against the Germans. And\nwe never saw them again. Some of the Poles were let out. Some Poles were let out, but --",
        "A: No. And then, as I said, it was winter, I think it was March, maybe February, when the\nGhetto was formed, the Ghetto.",
        "A: Yes. And we didn't have a place to go. There was my grandmother's sister. She had a\nthree or four bedroom apartment. By that time, there were two other families living in\npart of that apartment and we wound up in a little room. Some other relatives were there.\nIt was just bedlam. Finally, we found out that there was a little house that belonged to a\npharmacist, a Polish pharmacist, and they told he has to get out of his apartment. So, we\nshared that apartment with a few other families, and that's where Mom opened up the\noffice, reopened her office. This was an open Ghetto. There were no wires, no barbed\nwires, just check points. Jewish police were watching it. The Poles and the Germans\nwould come into the Ghetto. If they didn't know you, you could get out. I had a friend\nwho would go out, but no one knew him in town. But I couldn't get out because they\nknew me, and I could never step my foot out, outside. The Ghetto was on two sides of\nthat little section. There was a main street going through with the street cars, so we had\ncertain hours we could walk through, walk across the main street. You could walk across\nin the morning. You could cross 1n the afternoon. Once you went on the one side, you\ncouldn't go back until the hour came that you could do it. They formed a factory. They\nstarted having German army coats made, and money was coming in. There were various\npeople who were in charge of the Ghetto, and there was one so-called revolution after\nanother one. One group would kick them out and get other ones, with the help of the\nGermans. Personally, our family, my mother was having a lot of patients. There were no\nPolish dentists in town, so her patients would come in.",
        "A: Polish people. We had access to food. We had access to a lot of things. She was making\nmoney, and she was helping the whole family. She had aunts and uncles and she was\nsupporting everybody at that time. I worked with my grandfather in an outpatient clinic.",
        "A: No. Grandfather before he became a dentist, he was something you called a feltcher (ph).\nIt's almost like a medic. My grandfather was doing it. My grandfather was doing it. So,\nhe was very well educated in medicine basically. Never became a doctor. And there was\na need for an outpatient clinic, so this was free of charge. He opened it up under the\nhospital of the Jewish government, and I worked with him. The afternoons I had tutors,\nand my mother was very anxious for me to finish my -- somehow not to lose my years of\neducation, so in the afternoon I had a tutor and was doing the high school program as\nmuch as we could, but at least I had somewhat. I wasn't left completely wild.",
        "A: There was a so-called Jewish , originally there was one lawyer in charge of\nit. There was a bunch of people who took over, and there were all kinds of unsavory\nthings. Unsavory in terms of there were rations coming in, the food was coming in, and I\nthink they were selling it in the Black Market. There was another group denounced them.\nEventually they were arrested and some of them were hanged later in Lodz Ghetto. There\nwas a Jewish police, but they were strictly order police. I don't think they wore hats. They\njust wore arm bands. They were watching all the end streets of the Ghetto and the\ncrossing streets. We had a whole little government which was running with the\nunderstanding of the Germans and they were dealing with the Germans. The food and\neverything else was going through that group.",
        "A: The first one, yes. I mean, I wouldn't say the first one. That one lawyer was not, but the\ngroup which took over, they were corrupt, very corrupt.",
        "A: I don't know. I think they just got a group of people together and went to the Germans\nand what they did, I don't know. This third group they were a couple of brothers and\nsomeone else, and they denounced the second group as corrupt, because I guess they got\nwind of what was going on.",
        "A: I don't think so. Not at that time, no.",
        "A: Well, they were not really taking orders from the Germans. They had to do a job and\nthere were friends among them. I mean, they were not in any way abusing people or\nkilling people, or hitting people. They were just standing there and wouldn't let you go.\nThe Germans and the Poles could come into Ghetto, and they told you not to go. This is\nthe border, this is the line, you can't cross the line, period.",
        "A: No, in Ghetto, there was absolutely nothing, no schools. The only thing\nwe had organized, they organized a hospital. It was an old factory, and we organized it as\na hospital. We had a bunch of fundraisers, which were like reviews, and people\nvolunteered to entertain and perform and we would all go to the shows and that would\nraise money for the hospital. But that was the extent of this cultural events.",
        "A: Oh yes. My family, at that time, we had too much to eat, because we had access to\neverything at much lower prices than the real Black Market. Those items were on the\nBlack Market, but we were going directly from the Poles to us as I guess going to some\nmiddle man in the Ghetto. So, we did have enough to eat. Grandma again, had a little girl\nwho helped run this place, and as a result my mother was supporting that family, and the\ntutor's family, and she had two aunts and one uncle. She was supporting them, giving\nthem money so they could buy their food.",
        "A: No, it wasn't too severed. But it was, like those two women who were teaching me, there\nwere two sisters that lived with their mother, and they had absolutely no way of getting\nany money. They were tutoring me and they were tutoring my other friends, so that was\ntheir main way of making money. My mother gave orders that when they came in the\nafternoon, we served a little snack. I didn't need a snack, but by serving some little\nsandwiches or something the tutor could eat and she didn't have to eat home. So, there\nwere ways of helping people.",
        "A: There was rationing. There was a Black Market. There was rationing, but again it was not\nso bad like in Lodz. I mean, people survived. No one starved to death. The Jewish\nadministration, I think they had some kind of a welfare department because Mom was\ntaking in any patient who couldn't pay, Jewish patient, would get a slip from the\ndepartment and they would come in and she treated them free. She'd never take any\nmoney. I mean people had money, but that was something else. But if they didn't, they\nwere all treated for free.",
        "A: I don't think so. I don't think so. That Ghetto lasted about two years. People still had\nthings. People were selling things. They were selling linens. They were selling, if they\nhad any jewelry, they were selling, so I don't think at that time, and look, I was a young\ngirl, and I was concerned with working and meeting boys later and so on, and doing some\nschool work, so maybe I did not delve into that too deeply.",
        "A: I was still doing all of those things until the Ghetto was closed.",
        "A: All right, there was an interesting encounter I had. In high school, we had one girl who\nwas of German decent, and as before they would taunt Jewish girls, the year before the\nwar, they started taunting her. We would not go to the -- they had catholic classes in\nschool. The priest would come in and teach them catholic, you know, the religion. So, we\nwere excused for the hour and the three of us, there was another girl and we used to sit in\nthe cafeteria and just sit and kill an hour. They used to send once a week a Jewish teacher\nto teach all of the Jewish girls, the Jewish religion. So, the kids would taunt her, and I\nwas one of the few people who were friendly with her. And I met her one day in the\nGhetto, she worked in the Ghetto, and I was shocked because she hugged me and kissed\nme on the street. Her family declared themselves Tolstoy, you know, the German\nNationalist. And she gave me a big greeting, and I was very much surprised. But you see,\nI took her part and defended her against the Polish girls before the war. But that was the\nonly contact I had with her. I mentioned that woman who was my mother's friend, she\nmarried a Pole. When the war broke out they were in the textile business like everybody\nelse in town, and Mom decided to invest some money in some wool clothes. Because we\nfigured that during the war the factories will be closed, then that will be worth more\nmoney, but she left the fabric -- I mean I don't know how many bolts of fabric she\nbought, she left if with that family, with him and his family. When it came the time that\nshe wanted to sell it, he was the only one who came with the money. She sent him a\nmessage and within a few days, and this was a nice profit, because naturally that thing\nincreased in value and we got it. We got the money. So, he was one of the few. He was\ngood and he was honest and he didn't look to take the stuff and not to deliver.",
        "A: Basically.",
        "A: In my family.",
        "A: Well, no. We had every once in a while the Germans would come in. There were\nrestrictions where you couldn't have certain metals and precious metals and then they\nstarted raids, and it was just wild. They would come in from all sides, line up, the ones\nwith the brown shirts and the red armbands, they were lined up at arms lengths, they even\ntook the boy scouts, the Hitler Youth, they lined up and they would go from apartment to\napartment from room to room and looking for furs and looking for metals and naturally\nsilver. But even cooper and pewter, whatever metals they could melt. There were several\nincidents like this. They were also at one time, they wanted to evacuate Jewish\nyoungsters. They were looking -- my mother got hold of -- I mean she knew about it a\nfew days before, and I was hidden and some Jewish woman came with the Germans and\nsaid there is a young girl. I said I'm in the hospital, I was in the hospital.",
        "A: They took them away. We do not know what happened to them.",
        "A: Local businesses. There was a restaurant and shoemakers and things like this,\nbut no business as such. Once they established the factory, they were making money.\nThey were paying them money, the operators. That brought some income to the Ghetto\nunder ;",
        "A: I don't know. I really don't know what way they did and whether they didn't. There were\na lot of people like the doctor upstairs. There were Polish, in the Polish army officers,\nthere were Jewish officers, and they were drafted and they went with the Army. Most of\nthem, they wound up in Italy or many of them went up in . We don't know\nwho killed them. I think the Germans, but the Germans were blaming the Russians, and\nthe Russians were blaming the Germans. But this was most of the Polish army was\ndestroyed there, the officers.",
        "A: Oh, the masks because they were afraid to throw down the gas bombs. We were afraid of\nthe gas bombs. There were a few raids in town, and we used to sit when there was a raid,\nwe used to sit I don't know what you call it -- in Poland they had the drive in like it was a\ndrive in under to go to the yard. So, they had this one section and it was supposedly the\nsafest place to be in case of an attack or bomb falling down. There were some dog fights\naround. We saw a German plane being shot down. The Polish army was a joke. We never\nrealized that. We thought, oh they are so strong. They used to have a song about the\nmarch of the Reds. He wouldn't give anything. He wouldn't give a buck, and when we\nstarted running away from the Germans we were following the Polish army. They were\nwith the little scrawny horses, with little cots pulling the small arms, absolutely\ndisorganized bunch of nothing. They were like 18th century and here was the smite of\nGerman army. So, they were overrun in no time.",
        "A: They were afraid of gas. They were supposed to be prevent us from being poisoned by\ngas.",
        "A: One time we were sitting down, there was a raid, and everybody was \"Oh, they threw a\nbomb.\" They were masks like surgeons wear. The whole thing was a joke, but we didn't\nrealize it.",
        "A: No, that's all.",
        "A: They announced that the Ghetto would be liquidated, and we had like two days to get\nready.",
        "A: May of '42. In fact, the 15th or 16th of May because my friend, Alena had a birthday that\ndate. They announced -- first of all there was a group of men who will be working in\nthose factories, the coat factories. They will stay for a while. They selected a group of\npeople who would stay in the Ghetto and clean it up. And they needed medical person\nalso. There was a doctor and he was old and he was a bachelor, and he had a sister who\nwas a dentist, and they volunteered to stay. Our family was ordered to go to the hospital,\nbecause there were a lot of patients. The population was told to bring all the infirm, all\nthe sick ones, all the very old ones to the hospital. So, on a given day, and we were\nallowed to just take what we had on our backs and those bundles. We wore a few layers\nof clothes and we went to the hospital. On the given day, when we got to the hospital, we\nwere told that there 1s an old age home somewhere so we carried the patients, whoever\nwas left, and this place was filled to the rafters because they brought everybody who was\nin any way infirm there. That first day, they marched the whole population to that\nstadium, which was actually at the other end of town. And we have been in a hospital that\nnight, so we haven't seen what happened, but we were told what happened. As they\napproached the stadium there was an area which was like fenced off which was before\nyou entered actually the stadium. They started separating the parents, the old ones, and\nthey started taking the children away. All the children under ten years old. I was told that\nthey threw a baby over the fence and said we don't need such . Smashed\nchild's, baby's head on a fence. They took them all to the railroad station. They grabbed a\nbunch of boys, young fellows and they took them to the railroad station. That night, they\ntook all the women who were left to Lodz. The following day they came to the hospital,\nand the group which came were the same boys and they were friends of ours. They were\nmy friends. I knew them. They told us that they were putting people into those cattle cars\nand then they took the women to Lodz by street cars and just the men are left in the\nstadium. They were the ones who carried the patients to the lorries, carts really, and they\nannounced who couldn't walk should go on a lorry. And my grandmother felt that she\ncouldn't walk all the way down. So, we had kind of a touchy moment because we walked\nthrough town. I think this was Sunday, because a lot of people were there and some of\nthem would make the sign of a cross when they recognized us, and the whole personnel\nwas walking. There was one woman who was hiding a kid in her backpack and she was\nwalking. She wouldn't go on the cart, and when we reached shortly before we reached the\nstadium, you had to turn left at the stadium and the station was straight ahead and all the\ncarts with the patients went straight, and the cart with the boys went straight and then we\nkind of froze for a minute, and the cart with my grandmother and other people went\nleftward to the stadium. So, they were with us. That night and a man told us again about\nthese awful, awful scenes which took place -- I think that out of population of 8,000\nfinally 3,000, 3,500 wound up in large Ghetto. That night they took us to Lodz by street\ncars. The street cars stopped running about midnight, and that's when they were taking us\nall to large Ghetto. That second day, were just men and group from hospital.",
        "A: Well, I don't think there were too many children at that time.",
        "A: That day before, they took them all away.",
        "A: There were some teenagers, but not too many. I think they sent them to some work\ncamps, but not too many. We arrived at Ghetto late at night and they put us in some\nplace, just empty rooms. We were told that the gypsies were evacuated from that area\nbefore and that's just like a holding area. And people were crying and crying about their\nlost children and their grandchildren. It was just very, very sad about the old people, and\nsome other people wanted to know about what happened to the sick and the infirm. They\nleft them in the hospital, and what happened to them? And that same morning some\nfriends of our starting coming in looking for us, and one couple took care of my mother\nand me, and one person took my grandmother, someone took my grandfather. We stayed\nwith those people. They shared a couple of days they shared their food with us. They\ncould hardly afford it. Then we got a room for the four of us and we started our existence.\nI wouldn't call it living, in the large Ghetto.",
        "A: She was unbelievable. She held the family together. She had tremendous resources. Later\non, here, she was very unsure of herself and very vague and afraid, and even my husband\nwho knew her younger, younger age, he couldn't understand how absolutely brave and\nresourceful and fighting for life.",
        "A: To be a dentist?",
        "A: Well, she had to. There was no one else. She went to school when she was 18 years old.\nWhen she finished high school she went to Warsaw to study dentistry. There were no\ndorms, she lived on her own. She rented a room and lived on her own. She had to. Her\nfather paid for it, but still, she had to be resourceful.",
        "A: We're in Lodz.",
        "A: Conditions are horrid. We had this one room, which was our bedroom, our living room,\nour kitchen, our bathroom. The first few nights, Mom and I slept on a straw mattress on\nthe floor, and mice came in and started running on our faces, so we had to give this up.\nSo, we shared one bed and Grandma had a cot, and Grandfather had a bed. We all\nworked. , who was the head of Lodz Ghetto, didn't like dentists, so she\nworked as a nurse in one of the factories. I worked in a brassiere factory. Grandfather\nwas working also like a male nurse in one of the factories. Grandma got a job, old ladies\nwere sorting rags and making bowls out of those colored rags, and eventually some\nyounger women were knitting rugs for the Germans. The problem was that the rags were\nfull of lice and they were sorting them on wire tables. So, she was bringing the lice home.\nWhen they give us rations, you have to pick up the rations, the first day because very\noften they would run out of the things. I think there were 750 to 900 calories a day what\nwe were getting at that time. And just before the winter they decided to give us rations\nfor the whole winter. Our wood and coal and turnips and potatoes and cabbage and beets.\nSo, we had to go and pick it up at night. Mom and I would stand in line. The only way to\npick this up was to put it on a sack and put it on your shoulders and carry it. You\nwouldn't let anyone carry it, because they would disappear. We had four people, so we\nsometimes had to do it in four installments, four nights in a row to pick up that stuff. On\nthe one bed we had the coal and the wood, and on the other bed we had all the potatoes\nand cabbage and we had the inventory. We knew how many months it was supposed to\nlast, and every couple of nights we would check which potatoes were getting rotten. And\nthis is the potatoes we ate because we knew it had to last for the whole winter. We also\ngot bread, a loaf of bread. So, again, we cut up the bread in sections and little slices so we\nhad for breakfast a piece and for lunch a piece and for dinner a piece and so we were not\n-- we were always hungry, but some people would eat the bread on the first day or the\nsecond day and they were starving the rest of the week. And what else we did, we all got\nsome kind of a -- we didn't make anything warm to drink in the morning but you could\nbuy hot water or coffee, so Grandma was going later to work so she volunteered. Then\nshe started tripping on the street and falling down. She would come with a bloody face,\nwhether she was weak or whether she had pressure too long, we don't know. So, we gave\nthat up. During the day we all got soup. If you worked, you got the soup. And you had to\nwork because you would get the money, the German money. The , they\nwere named after Mr. who was the absolute tyrant in the Ghetto. And\nthen at night we made a little something to eat, from whatever we had, whatever rations\nwe had. If we had any vegetables we made it a little bit thick with any starches or\nwhatever they give us. This was the existence. Cold miserable and we all started getting\nsick. I was getting abscesses on my face and sties in my eyes. Grandfather fell on ice and\nbroke his arm, and he started staying in bed. Grandmother had those dizzy spells, and we\njust tried to exist, and this was two years.",
        "A: Oh yes. At work, you work. I had a boyfriend, and we used to walk the streets because he\nhad no place to go, and I had no place to go, so it was cold and we used to walk the\nstreets and talk.",
        "A: I think there were curfews. I'm sure there were. We didn't walk at night. We walked on a\nSaturday. It was a day off, so we walked. Towards the very end of the Ghetto, I got a job\nin the fields, in the vegetable fields. There were two kinds of police in the large Ghetto.\nThere was this regular order police. They watched the exits. They watch order and stuff\nlike this. And there was so-called commando. The head of\ncommando was someone called Mark Kleeger (ph). Those bunch of thugs,\nthey would get orders from Germans to deliver diamonds or deliver or find gold among\nthe Jews, but they were nasty. They would come into someone's house looking for this\nstuff, and naturally they figure out the person would hide the stuff in sugar or flour. So,\ninstead of taking a plate or a bowl, they would just dump everything out on the floor\nlooking for the valuables. They were in charge of the fields where they distributed the\nvegetables. I mean, so if you knew someone and we knew someone and they were there\nand they put the finger on the scale a little bit or lifted the scale you could get a little bit\nmore. They had special rations. They ate in special places. They would buy their\ngroceries in a special store like all the others of ;",
        "A: That was Jewish police. And as I said, he had those fields out near the Jewish cemetery.\nHe established vegetable fields. We had people working there. And I was getting sick and\nthrough connections and through people I got the job in those fields. It was a hard labor.\nSo, first of all you got two soups a day instead of one. I had to walk two or three miles to\nthat place, but the fresh air. I mean there was nothing much to do, the fresh air and the\nsun started drying up my face, and then we were working when we were weeding, we\nwould take the weeds home. They were a source of green vegetable. When we were\nthinning out radishes, we would eat raw radishes. That they couldn't catch us, but when\nwe were doing something with the weeds, weeding the weeds, we used to eat the raw\nbean and put the greens back into the ground so they couldn't figure out who was eating\nthem. We weren't really stealing, we were just hungry so we'd eat a bean. But that helped\nme later on to survive the rest of it, because all of a sudden my health improved so much.\nAnd because I was getting two soups a day, I didn't have to each so much at home. I was\ngetting the extra soup. I would bring it home at night so we had it. And my grandfather\nwas getting weaker and weaker. He couldn't eat. This was really awful, so we kept on\nsaving his bread. And his wish was to live so long that we can pick up his rations. This\nwas his inheritance because he said he lost all his gold, he can't leave us anything else.\nWhat we did he died the day before the rations came, and we didn't report it until the\nfollowing day, we picked it up and then I reported the death, so we had this extra little\nfood and an extra loaf of bread, which later I left 1f in Auschwitz because we're still\nhoarding and we're still afraid to let go and eat everything a once. But the existence in\nLodz Ghetto was awful. They also had the criminal police, , this was German\npolice. They had their headquarters in a little church, and they would call people in and\nsay what do you have? Our landlord, he was the head of fences before the war. A real,\nvery unsavory character, but he had a heart of gold. And he must have had money. They\nbeat him to death. They let him out, he died a day later. But he was like -- his face was\nlike liver. He never told them what he had. They called my mother in. They said we\nheard you are a rich dentist from . What do you have? And she said, \"Well, I\nhave a couple of gold chains, I have a little diamond.\" And they said, bring it in. So, she\nbrought it in and they let her go. So, they were satisfied. If she would have said she had\nnothing, they would have tortured her. This between the and the Jews\nunder commando, this was pretty tight situation over there. And then they started\nevacuations. They were evacuating constantly people. One of the worst actions was when\nthey took the children out. Orders came that they have to take the children, they're going\nto take them to better places. There will be fresh air and farms and the people put signs\non it and they mobilized all the Jewish police including all the people who worked for the\nhealth department, including my mother, and they had to go and collect the children. The\nchildren were being taken voluntarily by the parents, taken down, because they couldn't\nhide them. The moment the family would hide a child, the rations would be taken away,\nso not only the child didn't have the rations, but the family wouldn't have the rations. Our\nnext door neighbors had hidden a child and they struggled. Unfortunately she died later,\nbut it was -- and then they were taking the old people. They would make you line up on\nthe street and get out and just select the old people and the children Now, one of the\nworst actions was around the Jewish holidays, this was '44, I believe. And we lived on\nthe corner, and the lady the one who was our so-called landlady, she was the wife of the\nguy who was killed. Before the war she was in Argentina. So, we started lining up on one\nstreet and she called everybody up and she said forget it. This is not our street. Our\naddress is the next street. There were two entrances there. She said, all of you go back\nhome and hide. Just sit quiet, don't open the window, don't stand next to windows. At that\ntime she had hidden some children and my grandparents. We didn't know where they\nwere, somewhere. They had all kinds of nooks and crannies in that building, and we had\nall hidden quietly, and at noon they rang the whistles and they stopped the action. So,\nthey were ready to call that second street, where we were, they called it off, so we were\nsaved. If she would have -- we walked out and somebody said to us, someone who knew\nus and said, where are your parents, and my mother said, hidden. He said, that's silly,\nthey'll find them. They'll kill them. And he was not sure about mom, but when we went\nback, like I said, that action was closed. I mean stopped, and that's it.",
        "A: It was terrifying. You didn't know what's going to happen. Some friends of my mother's\nhe was high official, she had her parents, and they went down when the street went down,\nand he told that he'll be able to release them because he was a very, very high position,\nand he could never do anything about it. They took him. They started having lists and\nfirst I knew I was not on the list. One of my grandmother's sister was on the list, and we\ntried to get her out, and my friend told her to go, because there was no -- you couldn't\nsupport them. You couldn't do anything with them. Once they were on the list, the rations\nwere cancelled. So, who could afford to feed them. So, they took her, and my\ngrandmother had one brother and two sisters in large Ghetto. One of the sister-in-laws\ndied, two children were evacuated, one uncle was evacuated, the girl finally\n, and she died there. The other aunt, they took them away and we never\nheard of them again. The woman, the last one's husband was either taken away or died,\nand she was the last one who was evacuated before our family was gone. So, they all\nwere gone. I mean, there were relatives in other towns, but we never knew what\nhappened to them, but those I knew until '43 what happened to them.",
        "A: Well, the organization was the head of the large Ghetto was .",
        "A: No, he slapped my mother's face once, because he thought she was peddling something\non the street and he was going in his carriage and there was a peddlar and she ran into our\nbuilding and my mother was working in the building and he ran after her and slapped her\nface. At one time I wanted to get a petition, when I had those abscesses, for some\ndifferent job. I never got into him. I never had any contact with him. He had his own\nclique. His brother, we called Prince Joseph, after Napoleon's brother. They all had good\napartments. They had special rations. They all wore high boots like the Germans. They\nall rode in those carriages with the horses, and he thought he was a king. The money was\n--the only money we could use in Ghetto were pictures on it. We called it\n. That was the only way you could buy anything. He liked the doctors, he\ndidn't like the dentists, so the dentists were person non grata.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: If someone displeased him, he would just send them out, either send them out on\ntransport or if someone did something which was according to his rules not right, maybe\nabuses, they were assigned to the feces brigade. And this was the most horrid thing you\never saw. They would collect, there were cesspools, so they would collect the feces from\nthe cesspool in wagons 1n special tanks. But those people were pulling those things, and\nthey had to empty them somewhere in the suburbs of the Ghetto. I remember there was a\nyoung couple. I don't know what he did, and they punished him. She was a beautiful\nblonde and she used to pull that thing. They were covered with feces. Naturally a lot of\nthose feces were full of disease, so those people never lasted too long. You probably\nknow the landmark of the Ghetto was everybody carried a little canteen to work because\nwe got our soup in it. So we all carried it. As a matter fact, I got as a birthday present,\nsomeone made one that was not made out of tin but made some nice metal so that it didn't\nhave that tinny taste, because the soup would get soured in it. Even those people who\npulled those feces wagons, they would walk around with their bowl or their canteens\nattached to their belts because somehow on their route they would stop and wherever and\nthey would get their soup. So, as filthy and dirty and miserable as they were, they ate on\nthe road. But those people really, this was like he punished them. This was worse\npunishment I think than being evacuated on the transports. I also had a hard time with\ngrandfather when he was dying. We had cold water only. We had to pump the water\ndownstairs to bring it up. And they had laundries, public laundries. You sent out your\nstuff, took three months, two months you got it back. Not that we had valuable things.\nThey gave us things out when we came to the Ghetto. Well, Grandfather was sick\ntowards the end and he had uremia, and he had accidents, and 1n order to change the bed I\nhad to pick him up and put him on another bed. We'd change the bed and finally when he\ndied -- he wanted to commit suicide. He had some procaine (ph) and his cousin caught\nhim and he was ready to take it, but anyway, he died. In order to bury him, one had to\nprovide two clean sheets for a shroud. We had no clean sheets. So, I went to these friends\nof my mother's who lived in Lodz before the war, and there were several families there\nthat they all lived in Lodz. And that was the one who lost their parents, and I said, could\nyou lend me two sheets so I can bury Grandfather and we will either buy some on the\nBlack Market later on, or we'll get our bundle and we'll give it back to you. She said,\n\"No, I'm sorry, I don't have it.\" I was devastated. And finally the people next door who\nwere new acquaintances, the ones who had lost the child, she knocked on the door. She\nsaid, \"I hear you have a problem. Here are the two sheets.\" So, this is how we managed\nto bury him in clean sheets. This was towards the end of the war, and they felt that they\nare going to survive the war and they're going to have their linens and have everything\nelse. They lost half of their family and they still couldn't understand that those things\nwere not important.\nTape #2",
        "A: I have never attended any of it. I don't know anything much. There was a private library,\nand I used to go for books. The front was bordering the street which was closed. The\nmain street of Lodz Ghetto had street cars going like in . No one lived\nin those buildings. I think they had factories, most of them. There was barbed wire. This\nwas guarded by the Jewish policeman watching that no one should sneak out and so on.\nThat library, the private lending library was on that street, but I know we used to go\nthrough the back and stand in line and borrow books. That's the only thing which I had in\nterms of cultural events. As I said, I was there for two years, and we had to take care of\nthe old people. We had to bring the rations, and bring the food and do the fire and bring\nthe water, and bring the slops down. Everything was on my mother's and my back, and\none time she had an infection in her finger, so she couldn't grab. She had an infection in\nher palm and she couldn't carry things. She would go with me to pick up the rations just\nto guard me and I was carrying it. I worked, and as I said, Saturdays I would go out, and I\nmet this guy. I started going out with him on Saturdays. We would just walk, because he\nwas taking care of his mother and sister-in-law and a child, and he was a policeman, but\nhe was not doing anything how should I say, he didn't beat people. He was watching, I\nthink he was a sergeant, but they call it in German \" \" that means people who\nkept the order. They were not the criminals and they were not the commander.\nThose were the thugs. They are the ones who are the messy guys.",
        "A: People very often, you saw people lying on the ground. They found bodies on the street.\nThe children, they used to sell , and there were children, there was a\nlittle chant the little children would sell , and\nthree for one mark. This was almost like a Ghetto song, those little children selling.\nChildren were working. My mother was working in a factory where children were\nworking. I don't know what jobs they had, sorting something putting something together.\nThey were little children. And I remember once she told a story about a little boy and he\nsaid he saw a goose, but he said it in Jewish and he says I saw a gants, not something\nwhole a gants, he meant a goose and he started flapping with his wing and trying to say\nwhat the goose was. And he saw a gants, and my mother said the eyes would dig because\nhe saw an animal. Even the little children, the ones who were finally eventually were\nevacuated, but at one time they had little factories for them. Even they had to work to get\na little soup. Life was -- there were wives who fought with husbands about food. The\nhusbands would threaten the wives or steal. People would steal the food from each other.\nPeople would sell the bread for cigarettes and then they were starving. It was so difficult\nto live. Now, I was a young girl and I didn't have any clothing, and we used every piece\nof scrap of whatever we could do something to make something. When we first came in,\nthey gave us some stuff, some linens, some pots and pans, because they had from other\nliquidated Ghettos, they would get the stuff in and when people were brought in, that was\nthe organization. They would distribute some of the stuff. I remember we got this big\ngrey shawl with fringes on it, full of holes. And I ripped the shawl, I took out the fringes\nand pieced the whole thing together. I think I made three hats for us, for mother, for\ngrandmother and for me, because it was cold and some mittens. We grabbed things out of\nthe Ghetto, Ghetto. Among other things there was a piece of fabric. I'll\nalways remember it was an orange piece of fabric and I needed something. And it was\nnot enough for a dress. I had a friend who was working with me and she was a\ndressmaker and she said find some wool. So we found -- I found some on the Black\nMarket, some yarn, and she made me knit parts of the sleeves and the yoke and the\nturtleneck, and some trim on the skirt, she made like pockets, and I had a beautiful dress,\nI mean made out of very small piece of fabric and those scraps. And the Polish peasant\nwomen never wore coats, even working women, they wear those big plaid throws, I mean\nlike big squares. They were square. So, I was with Mom, we bought this plaid thing and\nmade a jacket for me, because you had to I needed some clothes. I was outgrowing what I\nhad, and I needed something. We managed as I say, things from scraps. Every little scrap\nof wool, every piece of scrap of something, you pieced it. You bought pieces of wool and\nmade a sweater. You're talking about people in Ghetto how short sighted they were.\nWhen I was working for that factory, the corset factory, we would get this was for the\nGerman population, and Germans would send in cut out pieces of brassieres, I mean they\nwere all cut, and all the fittings and the little hooks and buttons, whatever, slides for the\nbrassieres or if we did corsets there were stays and eyelets, and we had to count\neverything and package it in small loads so we would distribute it to the assembly line. I\nworked in the warehouse where we would distribute. We even measured thread. We gave\nthem certain amount of thread so no one could steal anything. The guy who was in charge\nof the factory was a manufacturer before the war, and he felt that the factory has to be run\nin the correct order. There were times we had absolutely nothing to do. No shipment\ncame. There was very little and the assembly line was working very slowly and they\nwould come in and they needed a dozen buttons, a dozen stays and we would just give\nthem to the assembly line, but the biggest work was when the shipments would come in.\nWe had to count, like I say, every button and repackage it. So, the foreman of the factory\nused to say, \"Whatever you're doing, just make believe you're working.\" So, we would\nhave a book in the drawer and we'd knit under the table and on the table we would have\nbutton or stays open up a package and make believe we were counting or whatever. This\nguy would come in, you would have to hide from him because he did not believe, he\ncould not bring himself to say, \"Look girls, there is nothing to do.\" As long as the\nGermans don't come in and they don't catch you with it, he was petrified. When the time\ncame for me to get transferred to the fields, I needed his release, and he wouldn't release.\nWith all the connections I had to get to those fields, he didn't want to lose one of his\nworkers. Finally, someone from our hometown, who was also director of a more\nimportant factory, he was a director of the uniforms, the coats for the German Army, he\nfinally approached him and said, \"There's a young girl here. She's sick. She needs some\nfresh air. This dust in the factory is killing her.\" I couldn't breath, I was having attacks of\nasthma. \"Why don't you release her?\" Finally, I got the release from him, but when I\napproached him he wouldn't do it. There were many people like this. They were so self\nimportant. They felt so important, and they were nobodies nothings. All of a sudden they\nbecame heads of factory or whatever. And Ghetto was one huge factory, starting from\nelectronic equipment, uniforms, which was the most important things, boots, supplies for\nthe Army, going down to the brassieres, hats, artificial flowers, brooms. And even those\nrag rugs, braided rugs which were made out of scraps. They would take torn sheets which\nthey would get from various cities when the other towns or cities were liquidated like in\n. That group saw that the good stuff went to Germany or for the\nGerman settlers. The junk came back to Lodz Ghetto. Some of the stuff was torn, they\nwere rags. They would dye them different colors and make braided rugs out of them. So,\neverybody was working and everybody produced something, and we produced and the\nGhetto was getting food. There was no money.",
        "A: I don't know, connections, basically.",
        "A: I think so. I think so, I don't know how many, mostly a men's society. The guy Kleeger,\nthe one who was the head of the commando, he had a brother who's the\nmost extremely decent guy, and she was a friend of my mother's from before the war, and\nhe was in charge -- this is a specialty of empty containers. You see, if they brought\ncontainers to Ghetto, let's say they brought brown sugar or they brought flour or\nsomething, that department would scrape out the things and there was still food in it and\nthey had to return to those things back to the Germans to refill it. So, he was in charge of\nthe empty containers. This was -- he had a high position, but he felt that this was a\nposition which in any way he's not jeopardizing anyone's life and anyone's position. He\nwanted to survive, and he survived and his wife, but this was his job, and one day I told\nyou when the commander, his brother's hoodlums were coming into the\nbuilding, one day he was passing our apartment building and he saw the guys were\ncoming in to check, and he just walked in. My grandparents were home. He walked in\nand just sat down and talked to them. He was waiting for those guys to come and he\nwanted to chase them on their way. He felt they shouldn't anyway, he never said anything\nlater, and they left the building and he later told my mother that he came in because my\ngrandparents said \"What was Simon doing here? He just came to visit us in the middle of\nthe day?\" He came, he wanted to prevent any scenes with my grandparents. As I said, he\nwas the most decent guy in the world. His brother survived, I think, either brother or\nnephew. He was hiding. Those people survived that lived in Israel, and we saw them.\nThere were a lot of decent people.",
        "A: I think there was corruption. There had to be corruption. There had to be corruption. You\nsee, in large Ghetto I was such a low level of living that I really don't know what was\ngoing on, but we know -- the whole administration and when I read this book about Lodz\nGhetto, one time he had theaters here and orphanages, he had schools, he was making\nthe famous speech, give me your children, he felt justified in sending out\nthe children because maybe he can save some people. When finally it came to his\nevacuation, they gave him a special passenger car. He didn't go 1n a cattle car, and he\nexpected that they were going to take him on an inspection of camp and he's going to\nhelp them in Auschwitz. And there are three theories what happened to him. One was that\nsome people from Lodz Ghetto killed him when he arrived. Some of them he was gassed\nor some German killed him. So, we don't really know what happened to him. Now, once\nthey evacuated us, the evacuation --see what happened, they were having more and more\nlists and more and more evacuations and they would grab people on the streets. I was\nafraid to go anyplace. And I had some money coming to me and some vegetables coming\nto me because the vegetables all of a sudden were ripening, and I was afraid to go by\nmyself to the place that I was working. And this friend of mine, the policeman, he said\nhe'll take me, because at least we hope they won't grab me on the street when I'm being\nescorted. At that time, we knew something was going to happen, so we made this big out\nof some fabric back packs and packed all our valuables and some food. That was sitting\nready to be taken in case they evacuate us. We never knew in the last few weeks of\nAugust, this was the beginning of August '44. He was late, and that in a way helped me\nand Mom be together, because by the time he arrived, they took us by that time they just\nblew the whistles everybody out. That's it. So, we went down, and downstairs he was\nthere. He just came. If he would have been 15 20 minutes before I would have left and I\nwould have never been with my family. I would have gone with him. So, he helped us to\ngo to the train station and that's where they put us in the cattle cars. There were about 80\npeople in the cattle car and one bucket, one slop bucket. I don't even know if there was\nanything to drink. We all had something to eat, I mean whatever we grabbed. As I said,\nwe had an extra bread which we never allowed ourselves to eat the whole bread. We're\nsaving it because what happens tomorrow. We were so conditioned to it that you have to\nsave something for tomorrow. And Grandma was embarrassed to go in the bucket. She\ncouldn't -- and we tried to cover her with the coat and so on. People were dying on the\ntrain. This was one night when I --",
        "A: No, there were all kinds of rumors but no one knew.",
        "A: We didn't hear of Auschwitz. We heard about bad things happening, but the only time\nthat I knew something was happening when those boys told us that the people were taken\nto cattle cars, the old people and the children, and those boys were never heard of again.\nBack track, one of my friends was hung in Lodz Ghetto. He was found, he was trying to\nescape from camp. And this was a boy I saw him when I was 15, I gave him my\nphotograph, and then somebody told me that he was hung, and they found my photograph\nwith him. Since that time, I was going up the ladder. I had boyfriends who were much\nolder than him, and I became obsessed to get that photograph back, because I felt if that\nboy felt that way that he had my photograph, it was taken when I was 12 or 13, before the\nwar. I finally tracked that photograph down and had it, and I told you that the people\nfrom Ghetto some of them were hung. The ones who were in charge of the\nGhetto at one time, which I mention it in my book. So, when we got -- what were we\ntalking about?",
        "A: Yes, the cattle cars, going to Auschwitz. We arrived at Auschwitz, and it was dark in the\ncattle cars. All of the sudden the light was kind of blinding. They lined us all up in fives.\nWe had my grandmother with us. They told us to leave this stuff whatever we had. I just\nhad like a little lunch bag, and I had my photographs there, and I had some money there,\nand a couple of rings and things like this. Mother, I think had probably instruments. If\nanything, aside from anything else she had was instruments. She had a red cross arm\nband, because in Ghetto everybody was identified by something. They had caps and they\nhad bands, and they had different hats with different 1.d.'s and so on.\nwas big on uniforms but couldn't afford uniforms, so he was giving people hats. As we\nwere approaching , there were a lot of Polish couple, like trustees\nworking there, the ramp, and I didn't realize until later what this Pole did. He saved our\nlives. What he did, is pushed me into the line first and separated me from my mother and\nmy grandmother and put some people in between. Then he put my mother in, again, put\nsome people in between, and then put my grandmother. He knew where she was going.\nHe wasn't sure where my mother was going. He knew where I am going. And the family\nwas together. Very often they's say let me go with that loved one and they would oblige.\nSo, naturally they send me in and then he asked my mother where she is going, and she\nsaw the sign and she said I am going to work. The sign was , SO She said\nI'm going to work. He looked at her, clapped her on her behind and let her go. And\nnaturally, they send Grandmother to the left, and my mother had nightmares because it\nwas so confusing that we didn't have a chance to look what happened to her. It was so\nfast, and so unbelievably confusing, and I think that the Pole by separating us, knew what\nhe was doing and he saved us, the two of us.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: There's a by word of Auschwitz \"shnell (ph)\" Everything they did you had to do fast,\nfast, fast. You had no time to regroup, you had no time think, you had no time to do\nanything. Get off the trains, line up, fast. That's all you could hear \"Shnell, shnell,\"\nWhen they finally regrouped us on the other side of the table, again they formed us in\nfives. There were groups of prisoner girls, and they started driving us, practically driving\nus, fast, running, and while we were running, we encountered a group of subhumans, to\nus at that time they were subhumans, they wore tops of men's pajamas, but they were not\nthe regular prison garb. They all had their hair shaved. They had the wooden lace shoes\non. Their doppers (ph) were plastic or fabric or whatever, or no, they were wood sabits\n(ph) like Dutch shoes, because it was muddy around. There were sent in another\ndirection, and they started yelling give me your bread, give me something, they'll take it\naway it from you. Give it to us, and they were supervised by the Germans, but basically\nthey were smacking them, and we were shocked seeing that group, and naturally wouldn't\ngive them the bread. I mean, God forbid, we had to hide the bread for us. We'll need it.\nAnd finally they brought us into an area where the baths were. This was a real legitimate\nbath, a processing area. By that time it was getting dark, and they warned us to turn in all\nthe gold and all the diamonds and all the valuables that we have because they'll be taken\naway. And rumors were going that they were going to do very personal inspections. Well,\nMom had a bridge with two diamonds in. She had it made in such a way that she could\ntake it out. The diamonds were taken out of the things and she had it in her mouth. This\nwas like a final ration in case we need anything. And I was very upset. I got panicky and\nI said I don't want to give these Germans absolutely nothing. Let's bury them. And I also\nhad a couple of rings, old rings. And in the dark, my mother says \"Are you sure?\" And I\nsaid Mom, I don't want you to give it to them and they are going to look in your mouth\nand they will find it and they will get, and I don't want them to have it. And there we put\ninto the ground, ground it with our heels, and got rid of the diamonds and got rid of the\ngold. There were a couple of other things they took, but this, it's like a feeling, like great\nwe didn't give it to them. Anyway, they took us to this shed --.",
        "A: She ground them into the ground.",
        "A: Yes, but we wouldn't give it to the Germans. That was fun --, when I think about it now,\nthis was fun, because they didn't get it. Maybe somebody eventually found it, maybe not.\nI don't care. They were sewed in a little plastic thing -- well, we didn't have plastic.\nAnyway, they took us to the shed. We had to get undressed, get the clothes off. They took\neverything away from us and they sent us to the sauna and lucky for me, I don't know\nwhy, they didn't cut my hair. They did shave our hair and they give us tattoos. It was very\nlate at night by that time. They were getting a lot of transports. Rumor was that they\nwanted us to -- eventually would have gassed us, but they were so busy, the crematorium\nwas so busy that they felt maybe they can do something with us, the able bodied people.\nAnd, they gave us some clothes. I wound up with a skirt, my mother wound up with a\nmini, So we switched and the wooden shoes. Then the last act was they painted a stripe, a\nred stripe down our backs and that broke me up. Talking about panic, and we walked\nnaked in front of the guys, in front of the Germans and in front of Polish copos.\nSomehow, I took this whole thing without shedding a tear, but when they painted that\nstripe on my back, I started crying. Again, one of the Poles walked over to me, hugged\nme and said, \"Don't worry, you'll survive. You'll be okay.\" I mean, I spoke Polish at that\ntime fluently, and I was a pretty girl at that time, and he felt sorry for me so he said,\n\"Don't worry, you'll make it, just don't cry.\" So, they sent us out, by now it's late at night.\nThey didn't have a barrack for us. They'll send us to the latrine. I don't know if you know\nwhat the latrine in Auschwitz looked. They were concrete benches with holes that could\naccommodate 500 people at once. There were benches on both sides and then in the\nmiddle there was a long bench from back to back there were holes with a pit underneath.\nAnd that's how we were using as toilets. Well, that's where we spent the night, in the\ntoilets. Well, I don't have to repeat Auschwitz stories. We stood up from 5:00 in the\nmorning or 6:00 in the morning and then they put us in the barracks and we had 14\npeople, 12 to 14 people to one six by six or seven by seven bed. They gave us a can of\nwhatever they gave us was in a metal can, no spoon, no nothing, and five people had to\neat out of it, so everybody's watching how many swallows you did of that. And one of the\nfirst nights there, once we got into the barrack, they were burning, the crematorium was\ngoing night and day.",
        "A: We didn't. But someone woke up and those barracks, like you see in the Museum how\nthey look, they had little windows on top and someone must have woken up and saw this\nred glow in the sky and someone started crying all of a sudden 1,000 women started\ncrying and people who were in charge of it, group of Hungarian girls, they started yelling\nto be quiet because the Germans would come in and so forth. We still didn't know what\nhappened. We knew something bad had happened, but we didn't know about the\ncrematoriums, what's happening.",
        "A: About a thousand.",
        "A: This was probably mostly Polish group run by the Hungarians. The girls who were in\ncharge had short skirts and they for some reason they all like polka dotted blouses and\nthey had their hair. They cut my hair some more. They didn't like my having hair, so they\nshaved it a little -- they didn't shave it, but they cut it completely. And Mom developed,\nwe were afraid, because she developed from the wooden shoes a wound on her ankle and\nthat was festering, and two weeks later they had the selection, luckily they put us through\na shower again, and the paper bandage fell off, so when they selected her, they didn't see\nher with the bandage. As much as that was festering and messy, they didn't do anything.",
        "A: Extremely. We had to get up, I don't know, 5:00 or 6:00. It was cold in the morning. You\nstood on that for hours. They counted, and counted first from the\nbarrack, then they counted from the section, then they counted -- they had to count the\nwhole camp through and had to tally. If someone died, they had to tally. If someone died,\nthey had to tally. If they couldn't find someone, they were looking for them.",
        "A: No, no, they started with counting the barrack, then there was a whole section, then they\nhad to have it to one person, and if they couldn't find her they were looking for them.\nSomebody was maybe hiding. Maybe someone died, maybe someone couldn't get up. It\nstarted over and over and over. And the morning was cold. Then they would give us five\nminutes in the bathroom. Sometimes they put us in one of the other barracks was like a\nwashroom. I don't know how many spigots, but again, it was fast, fast, fast. There was no\ntoilet paper, there was nothing. You couldn't wash, you couldn't do anything. If you\nmanaged to put your hand under the spigot and get a little water, they gave us something\nin the morning, I don't know if they gave us bread at night or in the morning -- no, I think\nwe used to get the bread at night and save a piece to have it for the morning, and they\ngave us some soup during the day and some kind of a liquid during the day, in the\nmorning. Once we were standing in the , and one of the girls, whatever she\nhad she had some kind of a jacket with patch pockets, and I said, \"Gee, that would be\nnice to have for bread.\" And she ripped out the pocket and said, \"Here.\" She knew my\nmother from her town, because we would save the piece of bread to have it for the\nmorning, and you were afraid to put it down. You slept on top of the bread so God forbid\nsomeone shouldn't steal if from you. So, that pocket was a great thing to put the piece of\nbread. I mean, you know, such little things can mean so much to you. Anyway, luckily\nfor us we only stayed only two weeks there. This was hell.",
        "A: No. Yes, I offered -- I couldn't sleep. Mom was doing something, checking some things.\nYou know they asked who was a medical thing, so she would go down, and they made us\nsit in those beds and you couldn't lay down. You just had to sit. Fourteen people in one of\nthose platforms. Well, I couldn't sleep at night with all the noise and at night they had the\nslop bucket at the door and somebody had to go, they had to go to the slop bucket and\nwhen the slop bucket was full, had to be taken to the latrine. Well, I volunteered. And\none of the escort from one of the other girls, from one of the workers, but they felt\nthemselves above carrying a slop bucket, and at least I could get some fresh air. Walk,\nwhen the bucket was full, I could go walk out.",
        "A: Nothing, it was just dead. Nothing was seen, no one was walking, except as I said,\nfigures taking the slop bucket. That's about all. No one was allowed to go to the\nbathroom. But, I was waiting for that occasion.",
        "A: It was very hot in the afternoon. This was still August. So during the day, it got hot, and\nin our camp they would send us out again for another count, and by that time it was hot,\nand we stood there for hours until they tallied. It was a way of torture. They were just\ncruel and people were fainting and people were dying in the lines and you were not\nallowed to help them. You had to leave them the way they were. If someone passed out,\nthey passed out. That's it.",
        "A: There was a small and there was dust, but we didn't -- there was some white stuff\nfloating, but we didn't know what it was. The first night the glow was unbelievable. And\nwe were afraid, I don't know, we were afraid to do anything. You were not allowed to.\nOnce I was in the bathroom, maybe I wasn't moving fast enough, there was this famous\nErma , She later came to Bergen-Belsen, blonde, gorgeous cool\nand she had this big whip and she smacked me with a whip. Because as I said, the whole\nward was fast, whatever you did. You had to line up fast, you had to go to the bathroom\nfast. They gave you five minutes in the bathroom. Five minutes maybe not even five\nminutes to get some water to wash up, wash up, maybe you could wet your face maybe\ntake a sip of water and wet your hands. That's about all. Conditions were awful.",
        "A: I don't know. It's hard to say. They lived very nicely, especially the block elders. They\nhad little rooms with quilts and they had little stoves. And one with the block elder she\nwould help and then they had a whole bunch of lesser girls and -- our group was\nHungarian so there was a communication gap. Some of them spoke German, some of us\nspoke German and some of us didn't. I didn't speak too well German, but I understood.\nSo, you were afraid of them.",
        "A: Sometimes, like I said with the hair. They couldn't stand the fact that I had hair. I mean I\ndidn't. I had short hair, but they couldn't stand that. They didn't have a razor, so they\nclipped it and said that's to prevent lice. Because they saw some workers working on the\nroof, again Polish workers. I talked to them once. I don't know how I managed to say\nsomething, and I said I could use a stick, and he said fine, tomorrow we'll work on the\nroof and I'll make you a stick for the soup. It's like a tongue depressor and he dropped\nthat stick for me, so I could dig into the soup. They didn't like it. So, the following day,\nthey called me down to the bottom of the thing and said, \"We have to cut the hair.\" So,\nthey cut some more. I had no choice. Because except for the block elders and their\nassistants the rest of them had shaved heads. How they got there, how they became them,\nI don't know. There was a woman who came along, she was a dentist from Poland, and\nshe kind of asked my mother and said, you know, I can get you a job and so on and she\nwas hinting that my mother has anything she should give it to her and she could arrange\nfor her to get a job as a dentist. At that time we didn't have anything, and my mother was\nupset. She said, if I had the diamond, I could have given her the diamond. I could have\ngotten a job. Lucky for us, we didn't have the diamonds and they sent us out to Bergen-\nBelsen.",
        "A: About two weeks after we were in Auschwitz, they lined up, had another selection. They\ntook us to the showers, gave us some clothes, and they took aware our clothes. I mean if I\nhad a little -- I had a little skirt and a tank top, they took the skirt away. The tank top was\nso short, I had a ribbon in the tank top and I had to tie it between my legs otherwise my\nwhole behind was showing. And they ran us out, and again they had a selection and they\nwere supposed to send us out. Then something happened, the trains were not there, and\nthey put us in some temporary barrack. The following day, they ran another selection.\nThey gave us a bath, and they put us on the train. This was the time I really don't know if\nAuschwitz had two stations or not because this is the only time and I went back to\nAuschwitz, I remember, we went through the main camp of Auschwitz, because we were\nin and this was, I saw the red buildings, the permanent buildings. I saw the\nband playing. So, I had a feeling they had some other station in Auschwitz proper which\nthey loaded us. They unloaded the cars somewhere else, and they put us there. They put\nus in cattle cars again. They give us a piece a bread and a piece of cheese. There was one\nwater bucket with water, and there was one slop bucket, and they put us on the trains. I\nthink we were there either two nights or three nights, and one night they stopped\nsomewhere and they brought a fresh bucket of water, and assigned someone to distribute\nthe water. Brought a little cup and we were supposed to have a sip. One woman got so\nfrenzied, she grabbed her shoe and dipped it in there and drank from the shoe. When they\ngive us the clothes, by that time, I've got those laced up shoes with wooden soles. One\nwas white and one was black, and I had this men's shirt, long flannel thing, blue satin,\nsignificant later, I'll tell you about that story. We stayed, and as I said the train was on\nand off and on and off. At night it would stop. I remember once we were next side there\nwere real cattle making cattle noises. This was an absolute nightmare. Later on when I\nhad my typhous fever, all I had I kept on saying, take the train out of my head, get the\ntrain out of my head. That's all I could hear is that. It took me years before I wanted to\ntake a train anyplace, because even when I was in Europe and we traveled later, I was\nvery reluctant to take a train. We finally arrived at Bergen-Belsen about maybe the third\nday. All the passing and stopping we passed, I think, Dresden. We saw someone tried to\nclimb up. We could see the bombed out cities and we were very happy to see those\nbombed out cities. I think it must have been the third day. We felt that another night on\nthe train we will completely lose our identity and it was confusing. We were getting\nconfused without food, without drink, and with the total darkness for so long, no knowing\nwhere we were going, what we're doing. Anyway, they took us, we came to Bergen-\nBelsen, and until that time Bergen-Belsen was not a concentration camp. They had\nvarious camps of various entities, prisoner of war camp, but there was no camp\nconcentration camp as such. Again, they asked people who can't walk who would like to\ngo by truck, and I think one or two people who were very sick, they went. Otherwise, my\nmother with the bad leg, she would not go on the truck. She was afraid, because we knew\nby now, by that time, when you are sick something bad is going to happen to you. We\nfinally got into the main camp. It was a long, long street. The front of the street, the\nbeginning of the street, there was administration places, there was a bath, there was a\nlittle crematorium which they could burn two bodies. But this was done for bodies. It was\nnever done to use it for killing people. If people died, they would use it. They gave us a\nbath and we put our clothes in a little basket, and when we walked out from the other side\nof the bath, we got the clothes. They marched us down to the end of the street of the\ntown, the very end of the camp, and there was this big tent that could accommodate about\n1,000 people. It was clean. We all got a blanket each. On the floor of the tent was\nwooden shavings, bales of wooden shavings, clean, never used. There as a latrine in the\nback right under the guards tower, big pits and there was a couple pieces of wood where\nyou could kind of lean against, but you could use it any time you wanted. There was a\nwooden trough with pipe. We could use the water any time we wanted. They nominated\none lady, she was from Germany, she spoke German, as camp director, and her assistant,\nshe was originally from Germany, so they spoke fluently German. They counted us once\na day. This camp is located on the , So It's like heather. At that time there was\nfields in back of us, later on they build more and more and more but at that time it was\njust us and the fields. So, we could sit in the sun. We could drink when we wanted, we\ncould go to the toilet when we wanted. Even at night, if you wanted to go to the toilet, --\nif the guards heard something going on, he would put the light on, the spot light on, if he\nheard a movement. So, maybe they eliminated you when you were using the bathroom.\nWhen the girls were sitting there, they would just look. After a while, you lose all\ninhibitions, and if they want to look, let them look. That's what we're going to do. At that\ntime we didn't have any doctors so the first day, the second day, they brought a big chest\nwith some first aid things and some pills, some equipment. Mom became the doctor.\nThere was a head dentist, I don't know his name, but he was until the very end, a very,\nvery decent guy. So, one of the first questions he asked me is \"How come your head is\nshaved?\" They couldn't understand that. There were SS but they had no idea about the\nhorrors of Auschwitz or the other camps. They were just half way decent people in the\nbeginning. The food we got was paradise next to Auschwitz. Fairly decent soup, we got\nsome kind of coffee in the morning and a nice piece of bread and at night very often they\nhad something, a piece of cheese or some artificial jam or something and Sundays we'd\nget red cabbage and there was some meat in it and potatoes with jackets and this was the\nfirst few weeks. The next few days they put another tent up. We got a big group of\nHungarian women another tent up. So, about that time there was 3,000 people in that\ncompound, because there were other groups.",
        "A: I think so. I think they were coming from Auschwitz because the other ones were\nHungarians. Can I tell you something interesting about -- by that time, we didn't have a\ndoctor and they brought a bunch of women from the Warsaw uprising, gentile women.\nThey were not with us, but they brought one of the doctors to us to work with us and one\nof the women somehow when there was another nurse and I and my mother and people\nwere coming in with various ailments, there was one lady who was from Germany, had\nlost her husband and child. She was not Jewish. Her husband was Jewish, and she kind of\nstarted becoming administrator to the very end. She was the administrator of the hospital.\nAs a matter of fact, we saw her in the United States. She survived. So, we would sleep --\nit was so cold, but we would sleep, this Polish doctor, and Lisa and my mother and I\nwould take one blanket and put it underneath us on the shavings and would cover\nourselves with the three other blankets. It was much warmer. And the body head kept us\ngoing. It was getting cold. By that time, I think my mother started looking at some teeth. I\nmean, checking, also everything on the floor, we had no place to do but, one day we got\nnotified and some people approached Mom and the other women and a few other ones\nthat this is Yom Kippur and the Hungarians are going to have a service and\nwe are invited. After dark come in one by one and come in, sneak in. So, one by one, it\nwas very dark, and you know they closed the camp. Except for the towers, there was no\none in camp. They would close it up, all the Germans would just disappear at darkness.\nAnd we all hide under the blankets. We wrapped ourselves in blankets and quietly\nwalked into the tent. They lined up the shavings in such a way they were like benches. In\nthe very front they made a out of the shavings covered with blanket. How\nthey got a candle, I do not know, but they had a tiny little candle. There as a young girl\nand an elderly woman and they sang the whole out of memory. And\nthey sung, and they warned us please do not cry, please do not wail, please do not make a\nsound. Don't sing, don't do anything, just be quiet, because the Germans would have shot\nall of us. I tell you, this was one, even the Polish woman, she was sitting there with the\ntears running down her eyes, this Polish doctor. We all sat, and until today I go to\nservices and when I hear the chant, I see that scene because it was eerie.\nCan you imagine, by that time there must have been 1,500 women there, like ghosts\nsitting in the gray blankets listening to the service, and then again, they let us out one by\none, two by two, please don't say anything. Don't talk when you walk, just sneak into\nyour own tent. This was unbelievable, the faith, and as I said we all took chances by\nattending that service.",
        "A: Unbelievable because I knew -- let's put it this way. We had a record of one of the\nfamous cantors home so I have heard I don't think I ever went to services,\nbecause this was such an Orthodox synagogue, so I couldn't go maybe when I was little\nkid they took me, Grandfather took me, but I never went. But I always heard this record,\nbecause my father liked that cantor and he had this record. And I used to play with the\nrecord player, so I was very much aware of that chant, and I knew it. I knew the melody,\nand I knew that this was something very, very important.",
        "A: Solidarity, feeling of something, hope. To do something like this in such circumstances\nwas unbelievable, especially after Auschwitz where we were so controlled and here we\ncould attend this service.",
        "A: Yes. Well, the way the camp was done was like I said, wa one long street and there were\nvarious sub camps on various sides. We were aware of several of them, and later on I was\naware of more of them. One was called the stern camp and one was called the diamond\ncamp, and those were the people from Holland and Belgium. The rumor --they lived with\nthe families at that time. That's when the children came in. Rumor was that they paid a lot\nof money to the Germans to bribe them in terms of giving them diamonds and gold and\nmoney, so when they evacuated them, they promised that they'll be kept separate and\nthey'll be kept with the families, and they'll not be destroyed. Eventually, they separated\nthem. They sent the parents out and the children were kept and I'll tell you about the\nchildren camp a little bit later. They started bringing more and more people to our\nsection, our compound. It's getting crowded. One day the tents blew off. There was a big\nstorm and wind and just the tents collapsed. So, they put us somewhere temporary, and\nfor a so called hospital they build a little tent in a corner and the rest of the people were\nin the barracks. And that's the first time I saw myself. Those barracks had windows. It\nwas just a temporary measure until they could build some more places for us. I walked\none day, and I saw this person walking without hair and wearing this crazy blue striped\ndress, and I knew that this original model, there's only one. No one else has this copy of\nthat. And I couldn't believe that this was me, and I stood there and I looked at my\nreflection an I touched my face and I touched my hair. I couldn't believe -- I mean I was\nlike a little baby, like you show a baby a picture and he says that's me. That's the way I\nwas. I couldn't believe that's me. I looked at the dress and said no there's no other one,\nthat's me. I'm the only one. It was a shocking experience to see yourself.",
        "A: This was after Yom Kippur, probably two months or so. It had to be in October because I\ndon't know exactly when Yom Kippur took place, but this was shortly afterward when the\ntents were blown down. So, then one of the people who one of the tasks was one of my\nfriend Alena who went to school with me, her mother was a pediatrician before the war.\nDuring the war, the beginning of a war, she was run over by a truck, so her face -- she\nwas never a pretty women, but her face was damaged, crooked and stuff like this. Well,\nshe became a doctor, and they sent another one, Doctor Annie. She was a woman born in\nRussian, went to medical school in Russia, married a French diplomat and she lived in\nGermany. She was Jewish, but she lived in Germany before Hitler, because he was a\nFrench diplomat. She was a socialite. She never practiced medicine, but this was our\nother doctor. By that time they moved us again. They build some barracks and they built\na so-called hospital. We were moved like three times. So, this was when Schnabbles (ph)\nstarted coming in. We had one big room where the patients stayed in the bunk, and one\ncorner we had the staff, and by that time they brought more nurses, must have been about\nSIX nurses, seven nurses and two doctors, my girlfriend Alena was a nurse. My mother\nwas there. On the one window we had this out patient clinic and in the back was a little\ntiny room and it was a dental office.",
        "A: They had access to it. It was part of the camp, but this was a separate little building.\nThat's when we started seeing the two I don't know what you call it, the German -- they\nwere like medial corps men, or something. One was a decent guy, his name was Fisher.\nAnd he liked to grab the girls' boobs. So, we gave him a name of Fisher Tapper. Tapper\nin Jewish is to tap, to grab it, and he liked to grab whenever he could when no one else\nwas looking. The other one was obnoxious. He was a young fellow and we called him the\npig, so I don't know his name. And Doctor Schnabbles started coming in. He was an\nelderly man, according to rumors again, he was a nose and ear man. He was checking\nwhat patients and what cases we have. One of the first patients which he started doing\nsomething with, was a woman came on the transport, had a compound fracture of her\ntibia. The skin was broken, the bone was sticking out. It was a horror. They put some\nkind of a metal frame around it and she had to be operated on. So, he decided -- first of\nall, it was cool. He never would take off his coat. He did all his surgeries in his coat. He\ndecided to set the leg. Well, he was not very successful. So, the pediatrician opened up\nher mouth and said, \"Doctor, don't you think you should do this and that?\" Well, that\nwas the end of her. She was ugly as it is, he didn't like it with the scars and all on her\nface, but that put her in disfavor. We had two guys were watching, he tried to set the leg.\nHe never did. The woman was crippled. She survived the war, I think, but she was in the\nhospital with us all the time.\nTape #3",
        "A: So, the first time he started setting that leg, it never took. Well, Schnabble was looking\nalways for patients, what he could operate on. He was always checking what we have. At\nthat time, our staff consisted of Lisa, who the director of the hospital. We had a scribe\nbecause they wanted reports. How many patients were admitted, what they were coming\nin for, what sicknesses we had and stuff like this. There must have been six or seven\nnurses, and then we had two orderly ladies. We even had like a little toilet in the back.\nThose two women had to take the stuff out, but we had like a little outhouse attached to\nthe hospital. I don't remember what we had later, but that one I knew we had.",
        "A: At that time, they took the Polish woman away, there was my friend Alena, Doctor\nand Doctor Annie, the Russian woman, who didn't know much about\nmedicine, but she was there.",
        "A: Very few. What I had was like a practical nurse whatever I picked up, so did my\ngirlfriend Alena. There were one or two, there was one Dutch, she came and there was\nanother one, a Belgium that really had training or not, but we did what we could do. Let's\nput it this way. It was more than the other people could do. And then I had a little dental\noffice. We had also all kinds of patients and they were there forever. Some of them died,\nsome of them we let out. Basically, a lot of surgical things. I remember there was one\nyoung girl who claimed she could never get up and we tried to get her up, and we could\nnever get her up. Sometimes we climbed up and to get her out of the bed to straighten out\nthat mess, and never knew what was wrong with her. One day she just died, so evidently\nthere was something wrong with her. There was another young girl she had a groin\nabscess which was draining for weeks and months. I mean the woman with the leg, I\nremember once I wanted to wash my famous dress, I mean we had nothing. So, if you\nwanted to wash a dress you borrowed something from a patient and wore that for a day\nand washed the dress and the patient was lying naked. Conditions were pretty horrid, but\nas I said, they were still feeding us. We got the bread in the morning, and we, the\npersonnel didn't have to stay and it was getting cold. We also had a young girl\nwho was a mental patient, whether she was manic-depressant, I don't know. One day,\nSchnabble came in and decided to do some kind of a surgery, and we didn't have\nelectricity so they brought carbide lights. She got frantic. Something was going on in the\nother room and the lights. This was a scene like . She went wild. We\nstarted chasing her. She was running and she was jumping over the patients. She was\nclimbing the beds and they were the two, three story beds. And people, in that frenzy\nthey are extremely strong, and they are extremely violent and they are very agile. Well,\nwe finally got her and had some shots for her and put a straight jacket on her and got her\nsome shots. She was petrified of Schnabble. One of the tents was still up and I spent with\nher about two or three days in the tent. My mother was petrified that she's going to kill\nme, but she kept calm. I mean, you could talk to her a little bit, you couldn't get the story\nout of her. After that outburst, that place where we give her the injection, that festered\nand eventually she died. She had an infection. When we knew Schnabble was coming, we\nused to put the straight jacket on her, because she was so petrified. When he walked in,\nwe all had to stand at attention. We couldn't move. The only person who ever moved was\none of the little orderlies. She was a little woman, blonde nose, no teeth. She was a young\nwoman, bow legged, and she wanted to show him that she was working, so she would\nsweep the floor, including his feet. It was a riot, and he used to say, \"The only one who\nworks here is this one, the little one. She's the only one who's working.\" As I said, she\nwould sweep over his books, and he liked her. He never did anything in any way to stop\nher. Well, one of the first opportunities he had to send Doctor out, they\nwere sending out the transports. The transports, at that time, were going in and out,\nwhether this was to a labor camp or something, so he sent her out, because he couldn't\nstand her, because she tried to correct him.",
        "A: Alena's mother. So, they went out. They did survive the war. I think they wound up in\nand went back to Poland. Her mother died in Lodz or , and\nshe survived and she was an artist, and she lived in Paris. I was in touch with her, and\nthen she died of cancer. So, she was a young woman. But they survived the war. By that\ntime, Mom had got some kind of ear infection, and I remember she was in such pain. She\ngot some medication and she was cold. So, someone had a pair of prison underpants,\nstripes. I remember she put it on her head because this was the only warm thing she could\nput on her head. She was sitting in the bunk, lying on the bunk with the underpants on her\nhead like a hat. At that time, somehow, Lisa, this was the administrator, and the other one\nthat was the scribe, somehow they were trying to do a little , and get my mother\nout, because they needed a dentist and they were bringing this man dentist, he was Dutch,\nfrom another camp. I think at that time, Binko (ph) came around, I don't know what\nhappened, but there was a lot of whispering going on and a lot of talking back and forth,\nbut whether the German dentist --whatever happened, Mom got better and went back to\npractice.",
        "A: Well, she was a dentist.",
        "A: Haddasa Binko (ph). She was a dentist. She came in couldn't find a job, was looking for a\njob. How she became the head doctor, don't ask me. She must have talked to the right\npeople, Germans probably, and they appointed her the head doctor. That little barrack\nwas getting too small for us so again they built another one. By that time we had a\nseparate room for the staff. I think we were doing the outpatient in the same room. I\nfinally beg hospital beds a small little room which was my mother's office. In the back, at\nthat time, they brought in a group of women from Slovakia. I don't know if they were\nJewish or not, with children. They had little children with them, and they built like an\nannex to our hospital, at the end of our hospital they were getting more firewood to warm\nup the place. They were getting some special soups, and they had some little possessions\nwith them. They had pillows, they had some tea. Every once in a while we could get\nwhen the transport came in, they would bring us a box of junk, medical supplies and all\nkinds of odds and ends. I was in charge of all the medical supplies. Whenever I got any\nvitamins I would take it to the children, because I felt that this was very important for the\nmothers, so I became very friendly with them. Anything with baby powder, whatever\nthey found and the Germans wouldn't use I started packages and so on. A little cough\nmedicine for children, pediatrics, so I would take it to those women. Later on they helped\nme. Anyway, it was getting cold, it was getting very, very nasty. The weather was getting\nnasty. One day a young woman came with pain -- and you see by that time we had a\ncouple of other doctors, I think. We tried to avoid telling Schnabble what was wrong with\nthe patient. We didn't have the means to diagnose. We had no blood tests. We had no x-\nrays, it was just feel and think.",
        "A: Everything, and I can tell you, describe the conditions. There was one thing, dental\ncondition, which I think it's called , where pieces of gums and lips would rot,\ndecompose, and they would come in sometimes with a whole mouth missing, lips\nmissing. I remember once three sisters came. One was completely gone. The other one\nhad quite an advanced case. The third one had just started, and every once in a while we\ngot vitamins. I mean we got all kinds of crazy things, which were odds and ends from\nvarious shipments, because the rest of the supplies -- oh yes, they used to give us once in\na while paper bandages, and peroxide and some vitamins maybe and some aspirins. We\ndid get some stuff, but it was little odds and ends like vitamin C. You had to use ,\nthe one who got the shot of vitamin C was the one who had the least advanced case of\nthat cancer of the mouth, because we felt one or two shots may prevent that thing to\nspread further and maybe we could save. The oldest one, there was no way of saving. She\nwas, for all practical -- maybe here in the United States with heavy doses of vitamins and\nheavy doses of medication, maybe one could save her, maybe, maybe not. But certainly\nyou couldn't save her. This was what we had to do. There was another thing which later\ncame up, much later. A patient would come in with a little blister and the blister would\nget bigger and bigger and bigger. Unless that blister was opened and drained very often\nhalf of the body was covered with the blister. What did this? I don't know, because I'll\ntell you later about the British doctors who were there and we used to tell them what to\ndo with it, because they had no idea what to do with it.",
        "A: We found that when they came with the blister and when we pierced the blister and\ndrained it, and had some dressing we put it on, maybe some antiseptic powder, whatever\nwe had we tried, somehow we could close the blister if 1t wasn't too advanced case of it.",
        "A: No, I'll tell you about that later. Anyway, that one time this was one of the most horrid\nstories I ever saw. A young woman came in and the suspicion was that she had appendix\ninflamed. It just happened that Schnabble walked in and he heard what was going on.\nWhat do you have. See, we had to give them reports, and at one time this one medical\nguy used to stay the doctors have to stay at the stairs. When he comes in in the morning\nto pick up the reports, he doesn't want to get off the bicycle. You had to hand him that\nwhile he was on the run. He was awful, screaming, yelling. Anyway, Schnabble came in\nand found out that girl is complaining about appendix. He decided he is going to operate.\nFelt her around, I think he put rubber gloves on or whether his leather gloves, again, he\nwearing his coat. We set up the surgery in the dental office. He ordered his help, the\nRussian boys should bring some wood, so they brought some wood. It was raining. It was\nsleeting, so I started a fire in that little wooden stove. He assigned my mother to the\nanesthesia. She was his favorite anesthetist. The anesthesia consisted of a little mask, a\nlittle cage that goes and you drip ether drop by drop from the bottle. No other support,\nnothing. Annie was helping him, two guys were standing there, and I think he had one\nother girl, a nurse to assist, and I was the dirty nurse at that time. He opened her up,\ncouldn't find her appendix. He saw something and he said, well, I don't know that looks\nsuspicious, he was ready to cut this out. This was the bladder. It looks like a fish bladder.\nHe poked around. He decided he can't find the appendix. He took all the intestines out.\nAnd the conditions are not sterile exactly. I mean the fire which was going there, it's full\nof soot and he can't find it. Put everything back together, took everything out again. He\nstill can't find her appendix. At that time he barked to one of the guys, go bring Alenluf\n(ph). Alenluf was a Greek doctor, I don't know if he was the main compound or where he\nwas, but he was in the men's camp, and I understand he was a very known surgeon. Well,\na guy went on the bicycle and Doctor Alenluf was running after him. In the meantime,\nwe kind of kept covered and kept the ether slow, not to have her in a deep sleep. I grab\nAlenluf's coat and put a pair of rubber gloves on him. That's what I manage because by\nnow he's very impatient. Alenluf looked in and found the appendix which was not\ninfected at all, and closed her up. She developed peritonitis. For three days that woman\nwas in a coma screaming and he was coming in. He sent morphine. He sent painkillers.\nHe also sent diet soup for her and white bread, but she couldn't eat anything. It lasted\nthree days, and she died. But this was a horror. And you can't say anything, and he's\npulling out all of her intestines out on the table and back into the cavity and back on the\ntable and back in the cavity. It was a horror. And you have to stand there with a poker\nface and don't say a word, nothing. You can't react. And even this Doctor Alenluf, very\ngingerly worked and did whatever he had to do, and he didn't say you did wrong,\nnothing. He just did his job and that's it. This was one of the worst things which I\nwitnessed. Now the funny thing happened with those slovak women. We had a bunch of\nsyringes and we had various -- like I said, you asked about supplies, we would write that\nwe need so and so many bandages and so many aspirins, we need so much -- they would\ncut it down in half, but they would bring us stuff. And we had some pain killers and we\nhad something if someone had an attack of something. We also had babies. There were\nbabies born. We had one woman once who knocked on the door in the middle of the\nnight and said she's in labor, and our administrator went over, Doctor Annie went over to\nthe tower and said, look we have a woman in labor. None of us is a midwife. So, they\ncame in. The two guys, and they went from barrack to barrack and they found a midwife\nand the baby was delivered. I think Schnabble showed up so he called him Joseph Von\nJordan, because there was a ditch over there and he said this is River Jordan. And the\nfollowing day he sent a few diapers and something, there were a few of them, but the\nbaby eventually died because the conditions were so bad that those infants could not\nsurvive. But, they didn't take away the babies. They didn't kill the babies. They didn't do\nany harm to them.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: That was later that we got into. At that time there were just a few newborn, we had a few\nof them and those slovak women who had their children with them. Anyway, one day I\nneeded my syringes to be sterilized and walked through and the Slovaks had a fire going,\nand I said, \"Would you let me do the syringes here?\" She said, \"Oh, you're so busy. Why\ndon't you let me do it. I'll watch it for you, and I'll do it.\" I said \"Fine.\" I came back. She\nburnt every one of them. Now, this could be considered sabotage. I mean you know you\nhad to really be so careful because here you are burning eight syringes. I was beside\nmyself. I was afraid that Schnabble would come in and want to do something, give them\nan injection, whatever if he said something we had to do it. Well, I didn't know what to\ndo. Finally I got this guy Fisher on the side and he was from Northern Poland originally,\nand we were afraid to speak in front of him because we were afraid he understand Polish\nand I told him. I told him what happened. I said, look I was busy and I took it to them and\nthey burned it and they didn't pay attention. He started bringing, the same day he came in\nthe afternoon, he brought one syringe. Whether he stole them, how he got them within a\nweek I had the whole set of syringes back and he never denounced me. He never said\nanything to Schnabble, nothing. So, even in those conditions there were people who were\na little compassionate. By that time things were getting bad, more transports. I believe\nthis was the time they brought the commandant from Auschwitz and he was cruel.",
        "A: I think Horss. And that she's the head and she was blonde and some\nothers. I mean this nasty crew from Auschwitz came.",
        "A: This was in '44, had to be around winter of '44, because it was getting cold when we lived\nin Auschwitz, when we had those surgeries. Also, when they were bringing the soups to\nthe hospital, there were a bunch of wild women running around and trying to take the\nsoups, the kettles, so we had to with sticks and stand guard, to escort the people who\nbrought the soup, because they would just eat them and run with them. We needed them\nfor the patients. The camp was getting bigger and bigger, and one day they said they were\ngoing to move all of our patients, and the whole camp first, on the other side of main\nstreet. This was originally a prisoner of war camp, and they had some permanent\nbuildings which were hospital buildings, and they moved first the camp and then they\nmoved the hospital. Our group was assigned to main building number one. It had an\noperating room. It had a dental office. It had some wards. We had like an outpatient\nroom. So, the first order of business was that the operating room had white tile floors and\nwalls. So, the first thing they did, they removed all the tiles, the ceramic tiles, because the\ncommandant wanted that for his bathroom. I believe we had electricity. I can't even\nremember. They must have had electricity because my mother had this sterilizer that was\nan electric sterilizer or she had spirit or something to sterilize the instruments. The dental\noffice was so beautifully equipped that when the Red Cross would come in an examine\nthe camp, that's where they would take them, because there was all the equipment you\nwanted to have. No x-rays, but everything else. There was enough novocain that we were\nafraid if we used up the novocain, the war would never end. Then there must have been a\nroom for the nurses, and then there was room where the doctors lived and Mom took me\nwith her and I shared a bed with her because they wouldn't give me a bed. I was a nurse\nand they wouldn't give me a bed.",
        "A: Right, right. And that room was Doctor Annie and a couple of other doctors, Lisa was the\nadministrator, Theresa who was the scribe, then they sent in another dentist, the Russian\ndentist, Larissa. One day, the commandant children governor who was a Seventh Day\nAdventist, was German, they were arrested. She came down with typhus. This was much\nlater, so she was put in with the doctors in that room. That was his orders that she should\nbe kept in that room. We had one surgical ward where people had all kinds of wounds,\nsurgical wounds. Sometimes we had to cut something, and we were getting very little\nsupplies, and I took it upon myself -- because I was working always with Doctor Annie in\nthe outpatient clinic. I very seldom worked the wards. I did very well with the outpatients\nin whatever had to be done. Whenever we got supplies I used to go in to change the\ndressings and you almost needed a gas mask for it. This was stinky, festering thing and\nwe didn't have enough bandages. We didn't get them enough. We couldn't change them\nevery day. Maybe once a week, once in ten days they would bring us the supplies and\nthere was some peroxide and maybe some ointment, maybe some powder to dust on the\nwounds, and I used to get so many blessings when I used to change the dressings. This\nwas the main hospital building. The next one was the nicest building. That's where the\nchildren were. By that time, they took away or send them out or whatever happened to\nthe parents of the Dutch and Belgium children, so they formed an orphanage there, and\nthe Slovak women lived there with their children, and then the few mothers as long as the\nbabies were alive, they lived there. That's were Doctor lived. That place\nwas heated. They gave them some food. They were getting the white soup for the\nchildren. They were getting the white bread, and I have a feeling they must have\ninoculated the children for typhus, because I was not aware of many of them having\ntyphus fever. I know they were inoculating people because at one time Binko and I and\nanother nurse went to one of the subcamps or whatever and those people had passports\nfrom Argentina, from Brazil from Australia. Whether they were real passports, whether\nthey were false passports, we don't know because many of them were Polish Jews. But\nwe went out there when the epidemic started and we were inoculating the whole group\nthere. Then there were two other barracks where one was not so bad and then there was\none which was worse condition and then there was one number 5 where I think there\nwere 500 people dead and 100 dead every day. They would bring the people -- they\nwould just bring them in blankets and leave them there. I mean, people who were in the\ndifferent barracks would just bring them in the blankets, and if there was any hope for\nthem, they were separated and put somewhere else, but those were people like in a\nhospice, they were just dying there. I was very friendly with the head nurse and she had\nshe used to say to me after I had typhus fever come and I'll give you some bread because\nthey didn't eat. She would get and she had a count of 500 so she got 500 pieces of bread\naccording to the count. She said, they're not eating, and you may as well have another\npiece of bread and get some strength.",
        "A: That I'll tell you. When we first came in there was a little morgue not far from the\nhospital buildings. A little concrete structure. Well we started taking the people out.\nEverybody was taking them out. Well, after a while that place would not accommodate\nthe bodies and they didn't have time to take them. It got to a point that it was like a\ntremendous field of dead bodies, and that's what the British finally saw. Families would\nwalk by and look and who do I know there. If the blanket wasn't soiled, we would save\nthe blankets for other people and if they were soiled we left them there. The pile was\ngrowing taller and bigger and bigger and taking more room and they had no -- they could\nnot keep up with removing the bodies. Toward the end when there was this tremendous\nepidemic, they would give people extra soups, they were giving them all kinds of\nprivileges. They would dig ditches and burn the bodies. They just could not keep up with\nit. When the British liberated the camp, the camp took the British General, whoever it\nwas, showing the camp, and naturally they avoided that area. So, there was a bunch of\nnoisy girls and he said, never mind, come here, come here. We didn't speak English, but\nthey said you have to see this place. And the British were flabbergasted seeing that, and\nthey made the German officers remove those bodies. They came so beautiful the first day.\nThey came with their hair done, and their uniforms were so nice and clean and they had\nto handle those bodies, and the deeper they were going, the more decomposed those\nbodies were. Believe me, at the end of the day, they looked as raggedy as most of the\nprisoners. This was horrid. Anyway, the camp was getting bigger. There were transports\ncoming in every few days, and they needed help with the transports. When the transports\ncame in, the able bodies would get a shower and they would place them in camp, but\nthere were some sick people coming in and they were checking who was sick and who is\nnot, so they would need a doctor to ascertain whether the person could be saved. A few\nwere nurses, and I felt so badly, the girls were going out every night one I said, \"I'm\ngoing. I have to help them. I just can't let them work both nights.\" So, we went out. By\nthe time we got there, most of the able bodies they were processed. There was this big\nroom with all kinds of bundles. They made the people leave the bundles and there were\nsick people. Some of them were lame, but we managed to undress them and put their\nclothes in those little fish net bags and once they went through the thing, the steam would\nkill the vermin, and they could go on the other side and find their own clothes. There was\none woman who was in a coma, and the Germans kept saying, \"Throwing her out. She's\nhalf dead, she's dead.\" I kept on shoving her around that place behind some things\nbecause I felt by the time I finished, maybe she'll revive. Whether she was in a diabetic\ncoma, what, a fairly young woman well dressed, and every time they saw me, they said\n\"Come on take her out. Let's take her out. Let the guys take her out.\" So, I was hiding\nher behind bundles, behind anything. Unfortunately the end of the evening we couldn't do\nanything but slap her face. I tried to give her some water. Whatever we tried to do it\ncouldn't revive her, so they took her out. That transport was so full of lice. We got so\nbitten by lice.",
        "A: They were from Hungary. I think Poland by that time was clean. They finished with\nthose.",
        "A: No, no those people were coming with their own clothes and whatever the camp wore.\nThey were not from Auschwitz. They were not from camps. They were wherever they\nlived in. Anyway, then it was getting almost light and they said all right we're finished\nwith you. We can take you back to the barracks. And we said, \"You know, you bathed\neverybody, you deloused them, and here we are crawling with insects. We are bitten all\nover the place and why don't you let us have a shower and delouse us, our clothes,\notherwise we'll bring the whole stuff back to camp.\" They said that's a good idea and\nthey even stoked the fires and we had a nice warm shower.",
        "A: We never showered. The first time when they brought you to camp. This was the second\none. Maybe once they took us out. I don't remember.",
        "A: Well, we washed. Maybe once they took us to shower, maybe when we're changing\ncamps, I think they marched us. This was a pleasure, this shower, and they took our\nclothes and they deloused them. Three weeks later I came with the typhus fever. I came\nback and I said boy I was bitten and this one doctor was with me and three weeks later, as\nI said, to the day, I came down with it. At first they didn't know what was wrong with me.\nSo, by this time we didn't have Schnabble. We had a young doctor who was wounded at\nthe Russian front. His arm was injured and he was working in camp. They heard that I\nmight have typhus fever, so he and the dentist came to examine me, because they have\nnever seen typhus before, and they figure out that I have it. By that time, the doctors in\nthe room that I slept with they decided they don't want anyone with the typhus fever, so\nthey kicked me out on the ward. But I had my own bed, and I was lying next to a girl who\nused to be a patient of mine. She had t.b. but I tried to keep her on calcitum. The theory\nwas that calcium was good for t.b. and we had calcium, she would get it. Again, she was\na young woman. You tried to help people who were not too far gone. We felt if we could\nhelp them, keep them going for a while, maybe they can keep on going. By that time, the\nepidemic started. The typhus epidemic. It was by the end of the war, this must have been\nFebruary or March and by the end 90 percent of the people had typhus. My fever was\nbuilding up about three weeks. It's like with pneumonia. It build up, if the patient can\nsurvive the crisis. Well, Mom would warm up water in the sterilizer and wash me and\nbring water and wet my lips. And those Slovak ladies made me a little pillow. I'll never\nforget it. This tiny little pillow. They collected some feathers because they thought I was\nso nice to them, and they brought me this. And I kept on saying \"Get the train out of my\nhead, get the train out of my head. I can't stand the train.\" And when they would bring\nthe turnip soup into the room, it was wretched. I couldn't stand it. Finally one night, I\nmust have reached the crisis, and called this woman next door and said \"Get me my\nmother.\" So they woke up the night nurses, got my mother and she came running in and\nthere was a doctor and again we had some supplies. We had something to support the\nheart, just a stimulator heart, and they gave me a shot of it, because I felt I don't know. I\nthink I was dying. Then I got better. In the interim, I just want to bring out the difference\nbetween two doctors. I haven't seen those surgeries because I was so sick. This young\nGerman doctor performed some surgeries. Again, he wanted to learn. He did them in the\noperating room under sterile conditions and he always had this Greek doctor with him.\nSometimes he would I mean people told me about it. Sometimes he would hesitate what\nto do and he would look at the Greek doctor and the Greek doctor would say, \"Well, don't\nyou think you should do this,\" but very diplomatically, and he never offered advice until\nthe guy looked at him. He didn't know where he was going. So, they did perform some\nsurgeries on those people.",
        "A: I don't know if it was serious to cure people of if this was a way for him to learn. I mean\nthey never had the chance to -- if he is a very known professor and he is a young doctor\nand maybe he should learn. And he and his pal, the dentist, used to sit in the dental office\nmost of the day. He also had some massages done. First one masseuse and then the other\nfriend of mine, the one who was the head of that very sick ward. She would come in\nbecause he needed physical therapy on his arm. The first time we had the inkling that\nthings were going bad for Germans they were discussing it very quietly. The Russians are\nso and so many kilometers from Berlin and they were afraid of Russians. My mother\noverheard a conversation. Whether that was done to let us know, or they just forgot about\nher working because she ignored them, that's when we knew things were happening. By\nthe time, close to the liberation, there was cholera there. There was a raging epidemic of\ntyphus. There was all kinds of sickness and less supplies and less food. One day this\nother doctor, I think it was called up over lined us up -- we didn't have\nwater, I don't think we had bread. He said times are very bad but you cannot abuse your\npatients, you have to take care of them. He was trying to give us a pep talk how to take\ncare of our patients. How ridiculous. One day one of the guards -- I somehow suspected\nwhether they were experimenting with our lives. One day a young woman came in and\nshe had a turban, a very tightly wrapped turban around her head and she said she's\nitching. We took off the turban, her head was so covered with lice, like you see, you have\na big ant hill and you kick it apart and you see the ants coming out. I'm talking about big\nant hills. I mean, you couldn't see the hair. So, we cut it and put some disinfectant. We\nhad some anti-lice things, burned the hair outside, the whole thing, and I was wondering\nif by any chance if they did not decide that this is a fast way of doing it. Because they\nwere all inoculated. The Germans were all inoculated. After the war, I think some of\nthem got typhus, when they were handling the bodies, but they were very well isolated\nand inoculated. Whether they tried this, I don't know because I don't know how anyone\ncould have lived with that mess, and the way the turban was wrapped around her head, it\nwas a young woman. It was -- I've never seen anything like it. I'm telling you you see a\nant hill, a big one, and this is what is creepy. So, as I said, toward the end, there were so\nmany sick people. So many people dying, and you couldn't do a thing for them. Yes,\nthere was an effort to save them, every once in a while they had the surgeons that wanted\nto do something, but I don't think this was so much an effort to save them. I have a\nfeeling that this was an opportunity for the doctors to learn. Schnabble was just learning\nwhatever he wanted to do. I don't know what happened to him. He disappeared.",
        "A: I don't know whether he replaced Horsss. I don't know. I think Horss was caught in\nBergen-Belsen. I really don't know.",
        "A: I know there was someone by the name of Kramer gave us a pep talk. I never seen Horss.\nI know of him, but I have never seen him.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The transports were coming in and this woman became the main camp. They would\nbreak out the fences between some other camps and that became a huge, huge, huge\ncamp.",
        "A: Right. The Dutch and the Belgium camp, that was combined with ours. The Indonesia,\nno. What happened to the prisoner of wars or whatever, we took over those parts of the\nbuilding, I don't know what happened to them. I know the Russians were there.",
        "A: I think they stayed more or less within their own barracks. They had to stay\nand they were allowed to come to the hospital, but otherwise, I don't think there were any\nsocial activities there at that time.",
        "A: Some of them, yes. And there were a lot of strong relationship in terms of there was one\nof the nurses and she was very friendly with a couple of girls. She lived --she didn't live\nwith us. She lived with a couple of girls. One of them was the head, a block elder, and\nshe lived with them. They were like sisters. That was the thing. People were developing\nrelationships and if they were like sisters, they could help each other. Some of the\ndoctors, there were two, one of them died, so we were friendly later on, my mother and I,\nand we have seen her after the war and were together in Sweden. We maintained contact\nwith those people because we were together and there were a lot of relationships like this.\nPeople would adopt each other. Those were ones who had the easiest way of surviving,\nbecause when one was very sick, the other one helped them. We had friends, two sisters,\none is now in Brazil, one lives in California, and they were together, and one of them I\ndon't remember which one, she was so sick that the older sister would chew a piece of\nbread, because the bread was hard and she would chew a piece of bread and shove it in\nthe sister's mouth to make her so she could swallow it, and that's how they made it. So,\nthere were all kinds of pieces of kindness. And when I was so sick that that girl who I\nused to take care of before, she was the one who basically, because the nurses wouldn't\ndo much for me. They were busy. But she was conscious, she was not very sick. That's\nwhy they placed me there and she kept an eye on me. If I needed anything, the sicker I\nwas getting, she would take a sip of water and put it in my lips or wet something and put\nit on my lips and she was in a way taking care of me. She didn't do physically anything,\nshe was in bed, but she was kind of keeping an eye -- she was the one who alerted them\nthat I was coming down with the crisis, so she did help me. Mom got typhus later. I mean\nall the doctors got sick. I mean everybody was sick. The sign was if you spilled your\nwater like we had this French doctor, she had a bed above us, and the sign was that if you\nstarted taking water at night to bed and then spill it over head she had typhus. We knew\nthat she had. There were certain symptoms. I could recognize someone with the typhus\njust looking at them. Later on, the British doctors, they had no idea what's wrong with a\npatient. I said the trembling, the lip trembling, people didn't even have the spots, there\nwere certain symptoms you could just recognize they had typhus.",
        "A: There was stories about it that there were. I never witnessed it but there were stories\nabout cannibals.",
        "A: Oh, yes. It was known. If someone was unconscious they put a piece of bread in front of\nthem so they would steal it. This was, as I said, the will to survive. But it got so bad that\nthey were walking to camp, they were walking to the hospital and they were just\ndefecating.",
        "A: Basically, no.",
        "A: Well, they were housed. There were barracks. Clothes, whatever they came with, and\nthere were some people working. As I said, when the people came in with their own\nclothes, the good stuff was taken away. They had big warehouses when the war ended.\nThe prisoners broke into those warehouses and everybody was carrying all kinds of\nclothing. One of the funniest thing this Russian dentist with his boyfriend and my mother\ndidn't know what happened, she was just recuperating from typhus and this guy walked\nin in a top hat, tuxedo with tails and a white scarf around his neck. He was one of the\nRussians. They were the first ones to break into the warehouses and he thought he looked\nvery snazzy in that outfit, this was after the war. But the war was a field of dead. There\nwere people dying by the thousands every day and they would just dump them out and\nthere was no way no matter what the Germans tried to do to bury them, and they would\nbring crews to the prisoners. They fed them extra, they forced them to work. There was\ntasks that they could not keep up. I think there were two graves when they finally cleaned\nout the camp, one I don't know how many thousands of people buried in those graves,\nmass graves.",
        "A: Yes. I don't know. I don't know. We had lines every day. As a matter of fact, after we\nwere liberated they took everybody to Bergen, but in the meantime the British helped us\nclean up some of -- they whitewashed some of the buildings, and I stayed another month\nor so, maybe another few weeks. No, we liberated the 15th of April, the 8th of May I was\nstill in the old place and they gave us new blankets and we were still admitting people\nand still taking care of it because the healthy ones they could process and take to Bergen,\nwhich was a military camp, and they placed them there. The sick ones, they had a whole\nprocedure they had to -- and they were magnificent. They would take them in and they\nwould bathe them on stretches and they would shower them and they cleaned their heads.\nAnd they were basically British soldiers and dress the wounds and place them in hospital\nbarracks. This was a very slow process. In the meantime, people were coming in. They\nneeded help now, and by that time we had some supplies. So, we were admitting some of\nthem and we were treating some of them on an outpatient basis, but at least we had some\nbandages and supplies. We had some medications. If they had a headache, we could give\nthem aspirin. I mean things like this, and they were still getting sick. They were still\ngetting typhus. That thing was still raging, and the British soldiers were all inoculated\nand toward the end there was a rumor they were going to evacuate the camp, like they did\nin Auschwitz. There was a march. There was a group that went on trains, and I think the\ntrains were bombed, and I think some of the Dutch Jews perished that way. Anyway,\nthere was a rumor that the camp is mine and they are going to evacuate the camp and\nwhoever can walk and the rest of the people will go, and the girls came over to me, the\nnurses that wanted to distribute some of the medicine what you have and the syringes and\neverything and they said, \"Are you going to walk?\" I said, \"No, I'm not leaving Mom,\nand she can't walk. I'm staying no matter what happened.\" Well, that night we had\nbombs and they bombed this was Lindenberg, the Allies bombed a nearby town and a\nday or two later we saw all the Germans walking -- the British didn't come in yet, but\nthey were walking with the white arm bands and for some reason I was sent out to either\nget the soup or get some supplies and I was passing the baths, the sauna and our favorite\nthe guy, the pig, this German, he was burning paper in this sauna, in the furnace. They\nwere very nice. They were still in charge, and they came in and they wore the arm bands,\ndidn't discuss anything, but at the same time the day the British came in there was a cook,\na German cook in one of the kitchens, and they were supposed to be working. He said, I\nhave another few bullets and I'm going to shoot all the Jews. He killed a girl, wounded\none, and the British were not in, the Germans were half way in and out. By that time we\nwere guarded by Hungarians. The guards were all released, outside guards. And there\nwas a group of Hungarians and they were guarding the camp with the guns. This was a\nGerman, and they felt, they swore that they are going to get themselves some Jews. One\nof the girls was brought in. She walked out, she said, \"We are free. We are liberated.\"\nBang, and she was gone. What has happened, when the British came in the 15th of April\nthe tank went through, waved the flag, everybody say hooray and they went out and we\nare still prisoners until they finally came in and started checking. Well, it was in the\nafternoon, they just went in until they could organize themselves. Then they discovered\nthe bodies so they called all the officers and the soldiers and they had to remove the\nbodies. Some of the girls were nuts. They were distributing the food in metal cans and\nthey were rusting. One of the girls saved the rations which was pretty awful and rotten\nand become spoiled and she wanted one of the Germans to eat it. And the Germans were\nguarded by the British because otherwise the mob would have torn them apart. There was\na language problem, but this one somehow managed to convey to the British soldier that\nshe doesn't want to do any harm. She just wants that German to eat that food, and he\nmade him eat it. The funny thing is, I went once to see this removal of the bodies. It was\na frantic scene. The girls were screaming and yelling and hollering and they wanted to\npull on the Germans. I went once to see it, but I just couldn't do it. I also went out, I think\none day after they liberated us and I went out -- the gates between the compounds were\nopen. The main street was open. That's where you saw this unbelievable mob of people\nwalking with all kinds of clothing because they broke into the depots and whatever they\ncould wear, the funniest outfits and funny things, and people were milling, looking for\nfriends and that's how I went to the men's place, the men's camp to look for people from\nmy town and people who I knew, and I found this one boy who had a very bad eye\ninfection and got him doctors and got him to a hospital. He lost his eye but he survived.\nHe's alive. He lives in California.\nTape #4",
        "A: Well, once the bombing took place nearby, a couple of days before the British came in,\nand that's where the German headquarters surrendered and therefore the Germans were\nwearing the white armbands. They were ready for take over and by that time, except the\ncrazy shooters, the ones we were in contact with, they were okay. Even the one that was\nscreaming, he was always quiet. I saw him burn the papers and I don't remember why I\nwent out, either to pick up some supplies because we still could not walk between the\ncompounds on the main street, but for some reason I was sent for something, I think we\nwere sent to the kitchen for soups. By that time they were not delivering and that's why I\nwent with a group of girls, and that's when I saw him burning those papers frantically.\nThey were packing and he didn't even see us.",
        "A: No, I don't think so. I understand that the dentist somehow got some testimony of various\nprisoners. They never approached us. This was one person I would have given him a\nclean bill of health. He was arrested, but then he was released because he really didn't do\nanything ever.",
        "A: Unbelievable feeling of relief. Just went out to see them and we all went out to see them.\nFirst the people came in and said the British tank went in. I think I've seen the British\ntank. They were shooting, so we were afraid to walk around. The Germans were still\nshooting and the Hungarians were still watching. You couldn't go outside of the camp\nand after they finally took all the guns from those Germans, then you went out. That's\nwhen I went to the main, on the main street and I saw this unbelievable motley crew of\npeople. Some of them were still dying. Some of them were hardly moving. There were\nbodies around, but whoever could move, they were moving. They were walking, and they\nwere smiling. And unfortunately, there were so many people who died still after the\nliberation. It was incredible.",
        "A: The liberators treated us very nice. The first day they decided we are starving so they\nbrought soup, and the soup was very rich, and we all ate the soup and all got deathly ill.\nOur bodies could not absorb this fat, so everybody got sick. We overate that soup. It was\na thick, I remember, with a coat of fat on top. They were very anxious to help us. The\nBritish would as I aid the British soldiers as such they were beautiful towards the\npatients. The British officers they were just -- later on they were funny, we had to fight\nthem, but in the beginning they were just very compassionate it. Then they realized that\nthe food they were giving us we can not take this very rich food, so they started giving us\nlike a diet food for a while until we could adjust. They were giving us those little K\nrations. They were giving us cigarettes and chewing gum and some lemonade and some\ncookies and were giving some tins of those cookies. I decided to smoke a cigarette. Mom\nsaid, I don't want you to smoke until after the war. The war was still on, so the 8th of\nMay and I was sitting and the cannons and you could hear the war was over and there\nwere announcements and stuff like this. I took a package of those -- I had a whole bunch\nof those little player cigarettes and I was smoking one after another. She said, I told you\nnot to smoke. She was so sick, she said I told you not to smoke. I said, \"Mom, the war is\nover. I'm smoking.\" This was like an act of rebellion.",
        "A: They needed some people to be still there because as I said, the transfer of the patients\nwas such a slow one they needed us. It took them a while, maybe a week, ten days, two\nweeks. I don't know. And she was so sick, so I stayed. I couldn't move her. By the time\nwe got to Bergen, they didn't have any more room, so there was this huge officers' casino\nand they converted this to a hospital. This was the end of everybody in Bergen. And they\nhad this huge ballroom, it held about 170 beds. The place was gorgeous. It was a round\nbuilding. They called it the round house. Out of the ballroom, there was a magnificent\nterrace. And Rhododendron blooming around, it was just gorgeous. There were a couple\nrooms where they had the casino, but they removed all the tables and they patients there.\nI think the paper I gave you was signed by this doctor who became the head of this thing.\nAt that time our staff consisted of British doctors. They were volunteers, second or third\nyear medical students.",
        "A: Well, there were a lot of buildings to the hospital, but this was the very, very end of it,\nbecause they were transferring people all the time, but this was the very end. There must\nhave been about 250, 300 patients at that time.",
        "A: I'll tell you that. So, we had rooms there. Mom started working a little bit there was a\ndental office there, but she had swollen legs. She was just working a few hours a day.\nThey had the most beautifully equipped kitchen I have ever seen. I don't know if many\nfancy restaurants here have kitchens, fully electric, they could cook a few hundred eggs\nat the same time. They had frying pans they could turn upside down by touching a button.\nIt was just unbelievable. There were naturally, a couple of elderly Germans running that\nkitchen for us. They claimed that they never knew anything about it. As I started telling\nyou there was the British doctor who was the head. A few British nurses, we had British\nvolunteer students at that time. A bunch of us, a few French nuns came from France and\nthey brought in a bunch of German nurses, and there was one ward with people with t.b.,\ndiarrhea, as sick as they come. The British assigned our girls to that room, and the room\nthat had 170 beds they were basically convalescing, and they gave the German nurses\nthis. And we went on strike. The rationale was that since some of the very sick people\ncannot don't know what's going on and the Germans may harm them and we will be much\nmore compassionate to them. Our argument was that we all went through typhus. We are\nall very weak, and there's no reason for us to be exposed at this point to t.b. and diarrhea\nand we should be assigned the convalescent, which was a much lighter load and let the\nGermans work there. So, we went on strike. We had a translator girl who spoke English\nand finally got through his head that this was the right thing to do. But he was very much\nafraid what will happen. We said we will supervise. We'll check, and the nurses were\nbusting because they were all registered nurses. We were all a motley crew. We didn't\nhave uniforms, I mean, like a butcher's apron. We had nothing, and we were watching\nwhat they were doing. Another thing I was very happy to do, they would send the women\nfrom the town from Bergen to clean the hospital and we had this was the ballroom, it had\na gorgeous parquet floor and we made them wash the floor twice a day. They would\ncome in the morning to clean, and they would come in the afternoon to clean, and God\nforbid that they left a dry spot. Wash it, the German word was . I couldn't\nspeak German very well, but this was a funny feeling, you know, I was in charge. So,\nlittle by little our big ward would empty because they were getting better and getting out.\nThe British, I started telling you about the British soldiers even before when they had this\nblister disease. Once, I remember one of the young fellows came and he was getting\nready, he found a patient with a blister thing and he was getting ready for a serious\nsurgery. I took him on the side, I said you are the doctor, I'm not, but we have had such\nexperience with it, you don't have to do serious surgery, just make sure you lance it and\ndrain it and then if you have -- they didn't have antibiotics but I think sulfur or whatever\nthey had, something to dress the wound and she'll be okay, because she didn't have\ntremendous blisters. He did it. They were still students. A lot of them got sick. They left\nand we had a group of Belgium medical students, volunteers and they were not treated by\nthe British very well. They used to mooch the cigarettes from us because we used to have\nall the cigarettes from the British. We were getting those packets every day. Somehow\nthey resented that. Those guys, I think they were older, and they were just very good,\ntrying to help the people and take care of them. The British burned Bergen-Belsen as they\nemptied it. They left one building standing and I don't know when there was a ceremony\nand we were invited, taken in by trucks. I think there is a picture at the Holocaust\nMuseum of that ceremony. This was when they raised the words of General Glen Hughes\nwho was the Second British Army. He said that now they can raise the British flag\nbecause this awful place doesn't exit any more and the ceremony was that they threw\nflame throwers burned the last barrack. Whether the administration building still stands, I\ndon't know, but this was the last thing and they raised the British flag over it because they\nnever raise a British flag over a place as horrid as Bergen-Belsen.",
        "A: They wanted to burn off the disease. They were burning them as soon as they were\nempty. They were afraid. I mean the whole German population.",
        "A: Right. We were there until July and they had a movie and the survivors could go to the\nmovies during the day. The British soldiers it was there for the British soldiers at night,\nbut I was working during the day, so I was invited by the Belgs -- the Belgs could go at\nnight, so they would invite me to go to the movies. I was a young girl.",
        "A: I think with Esther Williams. A funny thing happened. One day they said they are going\nto hand someone, some Nazi somewhere nearby. Let's go, let's go see it. So, I said to\nMom, I'm going. Where are you going? I don't know, to Ludenberg. So one of the girls\nsaid oh we have a truck. There was one woman and three or four of us that went. There\nwas no hanging. We couldn't get a way back. There was no way of getting back. Finally\nwe found there was some camp under the Poles and four or five women invited us. They\nhad some food. They gave us their beds and we stayed with them at night. They gave us\nfood, and the following day we are trying to get in the worst way to go back to Bergen.\nWe are standing on the corner and there is a mob of people looking for transport and we\ntried to get anything you can. At that time, there was who became\nthe head of Bergen. He married Ms. Bimko. He knew my mother. They used to play\ncards together, whatever. He knew her. There was another guy, a British officer, who\nused to hang around, used to play bridge with a bunch of people in our hospital and he\nheard that I disappeared, that I went somewhere and there was no way of calling. There\nwas no way of doing something. And they had a vague idea of where I went with those\nwomen, but where did we go, Ludenberg. They were all very concerned and I'm standing\non the corner with those few women who is passing by but this British officer. His name\nwas Eric, on a motorcycle. I started hollering, Eric. He said you know the whole world is\nlooking for you. I said, well, we can't get back. No one wants to take us back. We can't\ncommunicate. We can't go back. So, he stopped the truck, on after another finally found\nout where they are going whether they can take us back. He said they'll take us back. So,\nwe get on the truck and there are some soldiers in the back and they are driving and\ndriving and they take us somewhere else and we said Where are you taking us?\" As I\nsaid, we couldn't speak English. Finally they explained to us that at a certain time those\nsoldiers have to be on the base otherwise they'll be AWOL, which I didn't know what the\nword means, but they explained that they had to be back. Once they will be taken back to\ntheir posts, then we'll be taken to Bergen. This was one of the high drinx after the war,\nwhat I did. Trying to be normal, being almost a normal teenager. I was 19, but still being\na normal, all of a sudden an act of rebellion , get out do something adventurous, naughty.",
        "A: Free, that's exactly what it was.",
        "A: Well, what has happened at that time, Swedish government invited \"x\" amount of people\nto go and they needed doctors and nurses and dentists to go along to take care of the\npatients, so we signed up. They took us to , and that was also funny.\nThey had to clean us out, so they had two tents, one for the men and for one for the\nwomen and this friend of ours was a doctor got very friendly on the train going to\nand he came through and he said, \"You know, the women were washing\nme.\" And they made the German men, wash the women. They wanted to punish the\nGermans in a way, I don't know. They didn't try to punish us. We just decided the hell\nwith it. They're not meant to us. I mean, this was the thing, don't get shocked. Don't get\nshocked, they're not men. They're Germans, they're not even human beings. Let them\nwash us and that's all, because they really had to scrub us and they took us on a boat at\nnight. They gave us army coats and we sat on the deck at night, wool blankets or\nsomething else. It was very lovely. They fed us. They put us first in a place called\n. It was a school, and they kept us in quarantine. They boys were hanging\nthrough the windows looking for us, looking for girls, making dates the moment they let\nus out. There were all kinds of dates, and then they took us to another camp in\n. They started assigning people to work, so we were assigned to Northern\nSweden. This is, you see, talking about groups against groups. Even in camps they were\nfighting. After the liberation, there were incidents between the Poles and the Jews. In\nSweden, the camp that we were assigned to, my mother knew a man who really liked her\nand he said, oh I know a dentist, we need a dentist here and there were 200 Jews and 400\nPoles in the camp. They requested Mom by name. We didn't want to go to Northern\nSweden, but we had to go because they were requesting her not just a dentist, they\nwanted her. By that time, there was a nurse, so I was signed up as her assistant. We got\nthere and the Jews were going. What has happened? They were fighting. There was such\nincidents, such fighting, such name calling, that they took the Jews out and took them to\nanother camp. The Poles were so nasty and so anti-semitic. So even there, after that\nhappened, they were charming to us, I mean I was a Miss, but the Jews could not live in\nthat camp with the Poles. So, even then, and this is July August in '45, they still didn't\nhave enough.",
        "A: We definitely didn't want to go to Poland. I had an aunt here who left Germany before the\nwar. We wrote to her the first letter, turned out she got it. We gave it to some British\nsoldier to send it out, but she couldn't write to us in Germany. The moment we got to\nSweden, the first we went and put an application to the United States, so our order was\nvery long. We registered before even contacting, establishing contact with the family,\nand I found a crazy thing happened. My mother had some cousins and we\nknew one of them in New York. They were in the advertising business. He came to\nPoland before the war, and we wrote a letter to David Glicksman in New York. Well,\nDavid Glicksman changed his name to David Gipson. His brothers didn't, but he changed\nit. He lived in Manhattan and there must have been some kind of a dead letter office in\nNew York, and after the war they must have been opening those letters and tracing\npeople down. The letter was written in German. He got the letter. My aunt lived in\nWashington. He called her up. A few days before I had an uncle, my mother had an\nbrother in France who survived, and he contacted the family so we got established a\ncontact and in a few days money was coming in and packages were coming in and\ntelegrams were coming in and May 1946 we came here.",
        "A: I think so. I think so. The fact that Mom was a dentist so she always either made money\nor later on we were in the position to be sheltered a little bit more. The fact that I worked\nwith Grandfather during the years in Ghetto, I really was very good at outpatient. I\nwanted to be a surgeon. I was very interested in medicine, and I was good at it, but when\nI came here I found out that I had to go back to school for a couple of years and by that\ntime, I didn't have the means to go to medical school, and I really didn't want to go to be\na nurse.",
        "A: I think the family unit. The fact that we had the grandparents. We had to take care of\nthem. The first few years in Ghetto, we had to take care of the older people, no matter\nwhat. I mean we took care of my grandfather and he was such an unusual person. He was\na felcher and then he was grown up and then he went to dental school and became a\ndentist. He was extremely educated, self, well read and self educated extremely wise\nman, very much a head of his time. He believed in all kinds of inventions. He believed in\nall modern gadgets. The first modern gadget came in , I think my grandmother had one of\nthe first electrical irons. Things like this, he was very much. He said there are ships\nwaiting in America. Any moment they'll liberate us. They'll come in with food. They'll\ninvent a pill that you won't have to eat anything. You'll just be able to take a pill and it\nwill keep you going for a day. Little did he realize the to eat was very pleasant.",
        "A: I lived with my mother. As I said, when the times she was sick, I would take care of her,\nwhen I was sick, she would take care of me. We watched each other.",
        "A: I think so. I had her. I was very close to her.",
        "A: There is anger. I get angry. I watch something and I said how dare they do that to us.\nHow dare they made us subhumans. I mean we're human beings and what audacity to\ntreat us the way they treated us. What nerve they had to kill us. I mean it's such it doesn't\nmean if I meet a German I'm nasty to them, but I have a deep burning anger of why they\ndid it. What human being has a right to do to other human beings. I mean we watch those\nthings and we see those children. What right do people have to do it. But he was such a\nsystematic deliberate and also the question of dehumanizing us. People say why did you\nsubject yourself. They did it little by little. Layers, they took layers, they took our\napartment, they took the house, they took the privileges. They kicked us out from the\nhouse. They put us in the Ghetto. From the good conditions we wound up pour and no\nway of taking a bath and no way to shower yourself, living in that one room and\ngradually worse and worse and worse. It wasn't like they took someone from a very fancy\nhouse and put them in camp. Those people didn't survive, for the most part. They broke\ndown immediately. They did it deliberately and gradually. One step at a time, one\nhumiliation. The fact when we got to Auschwitz and they undressed us and we had to\nmarch in front of men. And the women, there were religious women, elderly women,\nyoung girls, and I was a young girl. I never undressed myself in front of any one. Here I\nhad to march naked in front of a bunch of men. This is all humiliation. This is all making\npeople subhuman. This is slowly and slowly and slowly so you had no we didn't have the\nstrength to fight them. There was no way of fighting them. I mean sure there was uprising\nin Warsaw Ghetto, but there was no movement in Lodz Ghetto like this and\nsaw to it. There was no such thing as revolution and I get angry. I get\nvery angry. That's why I'm doing this, why I'm speaking to people. I want to leave the\nhistory. I want that to be part of my history.",
        "A: No, do you have any questions.",
        "A: No. We were busy. We were busy and then the sickness. It was overwhelming, just like a\nflood. There was no dike, you could put your finger in and you couldn't do anything. You\ntried to do something, but there was nothing. We had no means to help the people. If they\nsurvived, they survived. If they didn't survive, you couldn't do anything. Some cousin,\nmy mother's cousin I found in one of the barracks, tried to get her something. The fever\ntook over, the typhus took over and she died. I mean, you were helpless.",
        "A: Oh, you tried. As I said the question was 1f someone wasn't very sick we could help them.\nIf we had the means, if we had the dressing, we had the pill we could give it them, maybe\nthey'll survive.",
        "A: You're welcome.\n"
