        "Question: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.\nThis is an interview with Blanka Rothschild, conducted by Regina Baier on July 13\",\nvideotaped interview conducted with Blanka Rothschild on September 27\", 1994.\nThe United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and\nToby Herr for making this interview possible. This is tape number one, side A. So\nmy first question to you is when were you born and where, and give us your full\nname again.",
        "Answer: My full name is Blanka Irma Rothschild. I was born in Poland, in Lodz, and\n-- August 19\", 1922.",
        "Q: And I would like to start with the time just before liberation. If you could set for\nus the context a little bit, where were you, when was it, and what was your physical\nhealth and your state of mind at that time. It\u2019s a pretty heavy question, but if you just",
        "A: Yes, Just prior to the liberation I was 1n so-called [indecipherable] which means in\nEnglish, a sick bay. I was lying there with some broken ribs, which I received on the\nlast beating that I got at the hands of the meister, the supervisor from the airplane\nfactory in which I w -- slaved. And at that time the allied forces were closing on the -\n- around our city, Bittenberg. We were not really sure who were they, but we were --\nwe were subjected to bombardments and the Germans closed us in the barrack, and\nthe -- the doors were locked and the windows were covered, and we were not let out\nto work, and as well with the sick bay. Since this came so rapidly, they did not have\ntime to dispose of us, because the plan was to somehow eradicated the camp with the\ninmates. I was brought from the sick bay to the main barrack when they closed it.\nAnd the following day, or two days later, one of the girls looked through the window,\nthe -- the shutter, and she have seen that the towers where the German soldiers were\nusually with -- watching us, ar -- they were absent, nobody was there. So they\ndecided to break the door open and run. And the ones who could, ran to the kitchen.\nThey brought us some very silly foods, margarine, one egg, I think, a couple of\npotatoes and we stayed for awhile there. We had very mixed emotions because we\ndidn\u2019t know what to do. However, we decided that the safest thing for us would be to\nleave the camp, since it was abandoned by the Germans. This was the supposedly\nmoment of the liberation, and we didn\u2019t feel liberated yet. It was very strange feeling.\nWe went across the street, my friends helped me.",
        "Q: You couldn\u2019t walk?",
        "A: Iam -- I -- I walked, because I -- the human need to survive is so great that you\nsummon all your energy to -- to survive. So I lived with this pain, and they helped\nme. And they -- as a matter of fact they say, Blanka, another day, another day and we\nwill be free. And we crossed the street. There was the house in which the\ncommandant lived from the camp, with a garden, lovely flowers which I envied when\nI passed by and saw it. We went inside, it was abandoned as well. And there were, I\nthink, seven of us, and one girl has -- had a mother with her yet. And they brought\nthe food, and somebody was preparing the food, and all of a sudden the commandant\ncame back with a gun, cocked the gun, aimed at the group of us and of course we\nwere petrified, we thought that\u2019s the end. And this big, strong man with the gun was\nafraid of us. And he backed out and disappeared. At that moment we thought the\nsafest thing would be to leave his house and go towards the fire, because this\nindicated that whoever is fighting, is a liberator.",
        "Q: How many of you at that time?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what happened, but we split. I was in a group of five. Two of the\ngirls were helping me, and the five of us were running. We passed a field, 1t was\nstreet or a field, there were two young men there, and they joined us. These were two\nPolish men who worked there during the war as hands at the farms because Germany\nneeded laborers, and they joined us. Since we were from Poland, we spoke Polish, so\nthe seven of us reached the front line. Unbelievable, unbelievable sight. The first\nsoldiers that we -- soldier that we saw was of Asiatic origin, I believe, some Mongol\nmaybe, with the eyes that make seem that he\u2019s Asiatic. And he was with the dirty\nuniform, filthy. And we kissed his boots. I remember that moment. And he motioned\nwith his hands for us to go in the back. We went in the back, they told us that we can\nhelp ourselves to food, which was in a barrel, there were herrings. We ate some of\nthe herrings, we got very sick from it because the bodies were empty -- the stomachs,\nrather, were empty. And there was no water because the pipes weren\u2019t working. So --\nbut we were pretty sick, in pretty bad shape.",
        "Q: So they were salt herrings, or [indecipherable]",
        "A: Long herrings, long herrings. And then they -- they told us to leave. This was the\nfront line after all, they were being shot and they shot back. So we reached a house --\nthis was a village, finally, and we reached the very first house, which had a slightly\ndamaged roof, I believe, and we went in. And it -- since the fighting go -- was going\non, we decided to go to the basement. They had the basement, which was very, very\nwell appointed. They had two sort of cots to sleep, with -- with linen on them, and\nthey were -- the walls were lined with shelves, and the shelves had all sorts of jars\nwith conserves and meat and -- and fruit. And in the other part of the basement there\nwere barrels. They were potatoes, carrots, and water. So, ever -- and -- and there were\nsome candles. So they were really very well prepared. And of course we ate some of\nthe stuff, and we lied down. And that basement was approachable by a swing door up\nand down, that\u2019s all I remember, up and down. And at some point during the night,\nthe door swang open and two Russians came, and they demanded girls. I believe that\nat least one of them was drunk, because he pulled up his gun and started to shoot at\nthe jars. Now, I said to myself, when I survived the five years, or over five years of\nwar, and I\u2019m still alive, I\u2019m not going to be subjected to that, I\u2019d rather die. So I ask\none of the Polish boys to save me, and I said to him, look, tell them that I\u2019m --\npretend I\u2019m your wife. I was lying on this cot, and he covered me, and he sat down\non top of me. And the other girl did the same, and one went in the back room where\nthe barrels were, and two girls were raped. Now the -- the Russian who was shooting\nat the jars, was laughing like a child. To him this was absolutely normal. Women and\nmen were made to -- to mate. So there was nothing strange to him. He couldn\u2019t\nunderstand that -- that we hated it, that we couldn't understand it. I remember that the\npieces of the broken jars, the glass, embedded in my left leg, and I still have the\nscars. And I didn\u2019t make a peep, not a sound, because I wanted to survive, so I was\nquiet. One of the girls became hysterical; her name was Blanka, I remember her, she\nwas the youngest. She became hysterical and she started to scream, so the Russian\ntook a candle, put the light on -- lit the candle and brought her some water. And he\nput the compress, cold compress on her forehead, he said, okay. When the morning\nfinally arrived --",
        "Q: Had he rape -- had -- had he just raped -- I mean, after the --",
        "A: Yes --",
        "Q: -- rape, or before, or --",
        "A: I he -- he raped -- one girl was raped on the floor, her name was Anya, she went to\nIsrael, I don\u2019t know too much about her now, and the other one was lying on the\nother cot, and it was dark, but we heard the sounds. And she was quiet. She was\nraped. She came from a very religious family, Jewish religious family, so in the\nmorning she did not tell us that she was raped, but we knew she was raped, because\nyou -- you could hear the sounds. Extraordinary. The next morning we decided to\nleave this place for something safer, and we walked through the village, found\nanother house. They were -- all the houses were abandoned by the Germans who\nwere running towards the American line, or English line. They did not want to be\ncaptured by the Russians. And the cows and the pigs were not fed so they were\nmaking sounds. We got into a house, we made ourselves comfortable, we ate. The\ntwo boys went to the garden and they chased some chickens, we cooked the chickens.\nAfter we finished eating we took the tablecloth with the china and threw it out of the\nwindow. That was -- this was the little revenge. We didn\u2019t want to wash the dishes,\nwe didn\u2019t know what will happen. It didn\u2019t feel like we are liberated. There was not\nthe sense of freedom yet. Oh, first of all, the war was still going on. We were so-\ncalled liberated by the Russians, who became in our eyes, another oppressors. So I\nquestioned myself, is -- was this worth it, all my suffering, to arrive at this moment?\nWhat\u2019s going to be? What will happen later on? And there was a story about -- I\nbelieve that I had on media tape, that we were so scared of the Russians that at night\nwe took a ladder and we went to the attic, and we slept in the attic, four of us. The\ntwo boys slept downstairs and one of the five girls, her name was Sarka, she found\nherself a r -- a Russian officer. She was a very enterprising young lady. The four of\nus were scared, four poor souls, so the four of us were upstairs, upstairs there was a\nbed, big, big bed, and the boys pulled the ladder down and we stayed up there at\nnight. And the same night, we have heard German voices, and we thought that the\nGermans came back. The Polish boys jumped out of the window. The house faced a\nsmall forest, a young forest, and evidently some of the soldiers who ran away, they\nwere hiding. They were hungry, so they broke to this kitchen to eat. So the Polish\nboys jumped from the window because they were downstairs, and they ran to the\nRussian commandantura to tell them that the ru -- there are Germans in the house.\nAnd we hear the Russians coming, and we understand them because the Russian and\nPolish are -- are Slavic languages, the -- the roots are sort of -- you could understand.\nThey wanted to throw --",
        "Q: Hand grenades?",
        "A: Hand grenades, and -- to the house. So the Polish boys said don\u2019t, don\u2019t, there are\nPolish girls upstairs. And we, all four of us, crept underneath the big bed, we\u2019re lying\nunderneath the bed, and Blanka, the youngest one who -- who -- who was hysterical\nbefore, she wet herself and we were lying down there in the urine, not even thinking\nabout it. Here we survived the Nazi camp, here we are so-called liberated, here are\nthe Germans downstairs and the Russians want to kill us. The -- the situation was\nabsolutely unbelievable. The Germans tried to escape through the kitchen door to the\n-- through the garden, and they were shot by the Russians, both of them. And the two\nbodies were for two days lying there. After that day, my fear was so intense, that I\ndid not want to stay with the girls. The next house ha-had French prison -- ex-\nprisoners of war, and I moved with them, they said they would take care of me, and\nthey did.",
        "Q: Through all of this you had broken ribs --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- and you were really ill, but --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- did you get any kind of -- of medical supplies, or --",
        "A: No, the Russians gave me -- as we -- when we were there at first, when they gave\nus some food, they gave me some bandages to wrap myself, that\u2019s all. I d -- I really\ndon\u2019t know how these people fought, because they were -- they didn\u2019t change their\nuniforms, they were dirty, they had all sorts of food that was unthinkable, and they\nwere fighting. They were very strong people, the -- the -- the stock. And the\nconditions were just tragic. I stayed with the French people, who took care of me. As\na matter of fact, I have pictures. They -- they gave me some pictures. And one of\nthem wanted me to go with him to France. He said, we will -- we will cure you there.\nAnd we stayed there for quite awhile, I don\u2019t remember the dates and how long. But\nthen the war was over on May sixth. We still stayed, because we didn\u2019t know what to\ndo and where to go.",
        "Q: How did you hear about that?",
        "A: Well, the Russians. Hitler kaput, Hitler kaput. It\u2019s over. Sarka had this Russian\nlieutenant, or I don\u2019t know what his rank was, she was very happy, and the three of\nthem with the two Polish boys were still in that house. I was with the French people.\nI was absolutely scared out of my wits.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] I will interrupt for just one second. So now we are continuing\nagain. So you were really scared.",
        "A: Yes. After I don\u2019t remember how many weeks, but few weeks, people started to\nthink of going back to their native countries. Now at that point, I did not know that\nmy family didn\u2019t survive, that not one of them survived. So I thought that my ob --\nfirst obligation was to go back to look for my family.",
        "Q: We should -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m sorry to interrupt.",
        "A: Yes?",
        "Q: We should probably say for the listeners who have not seen the videotape that\nyour father had already died before the war.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: But your mother and --",
        "A: Grandmother.",
        "Q: -- your grandmother --",
        "A: Well, my grandmother was taken away. I did not know if people who were taken\naway were all dead. We thought maybe some of them survive. And my mother was --\nyou know, when they parted us, I thought maybe she survived. So I thought that I\nhave to fulfill my -- my first obligation and go back. And there were people from\nPoland who walked with little carts and Polish flags, towards Poland. And I decided\nthat I will join them. There were carts, so I had some rides for awhile. And after\ntearful good-byes with the French people, that I will never forget, I left. And we\nwalked, and walked, and then they had the horse once. So the horse pull -- pulled the\ncart and I was in it. We reached a city called Lignitsa, which used to belong to\nGerman and became Polish, so I don\u2019t remember what the name was previous to it.\nLignitz?",
        "Q: Lignitz.",
        "A: Lignitz, probably. It was not too far from Breslau, and Breslau became Brotswow.\nAnd in Brotswow people already had apartments, people who survived. Now, I was\nnever very enterprising, so I just depended on that man who was walking. And we\nstayed in Lignitz -- Lignitsa for a couple of days, then we continued, and then we had\npart of the trip was done by a train that the trucks still remained somewhere. And\neventually I reached Warsaw.",
        "Q: How did you eat, and where did you get clothes [indecipherable]",
        "A: Who needed clothes? Who thought of clothes? I had something from the German\nhouse. I -- I\u2019m sorry to -- til today that I didn\u2019t bring with me -- didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t\nthink of preserving anything from the camp, I just want to get rid of it. So I went\nthrough -- through the closets with my friends, and I remember that I wore, I think it\nwas a man\u2019s shirt, blue, long-sleeve shirt, and some sort of a skirt. Some people were\nlooking for watches, for thi -- I -- I didn\u2019t think about it. I just wanted to see my\nfamily. When we reached Warsaw, which was bombed to rubble, and they left me\nthere, I didn\u2019t know what to do, how to reach my city, Lodz. I have no money, I have\nno possessions, I -- I\u2019m -- you see me, that\u2019s how I am. And there was a truck, a\nPolish man who had a sign he\u2019s going to Lodz. So I ask him if he could take me. And\nI said I have no money. He said okay. These times were different. People had some\nsort of -- I don\u2019t know, not obligation, but they felt like helping one another, because\nthe survivors were streaming back. So this man ow -- took me to his truck, and the\nfunny part of it is that he stopped in one city and he left the truck to go to eat, and he\ndidn\u2019t think that I -- of me, that I\u2019m hungry. Which -- which was sil -- really silly.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t eat?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t eat. I don\u2019t remember -- you see, certain things are faded in my memory\nbecause they are not of major importance. We eventually reached Lodz. We -- he let\nme out on a street, after all, this is my city, and Lodz was not really destroyed,\nbecause ra -- Lodz was occupied after few days. It\u2019s not too far from the German\nborder, so it was occupied pretty much untouched. Few buildings I think we lost, and\nI knew my way around. So I went to m -- he -- he dropped me off in my vicinity on\nthe -- the house that I lived in, the Dineska, 31A, still stood, very nice house, four\nstory house, a corner. And I went in and there was the superintendent who works for\nus, because the building belonged to my family. And he crossed himself when he saw\nme. His greeting to me was surprise, and why did I return, how did I survive, and\nwhy did I come back? He said, you can\u2019t go upstairs because people live there, and\nthe Germans took everything out of your place, everything. Carpets, and -- there is\nnothing left. But I said I w -- I still would like to go -- did somebody come back?\nAnybody came here? He said nobody did. But I still walked to my apartment and\nrang the bell, and they wouldn\u2019t let me in, the people who lived there. You see,\nPolish people were not really very friendly, and this is mi -- putting mildly. I went\ndownstairs and the st -- intendent -- the superintendent of the building told me that\ntwo blocks away, or three blocks away, there was a office by Jewish -- I don\u2019t know\nif this was HIAS, Jewish committee set up an office, and there were lists of people\nwho came back, or who inquired, or who survived, and that\u2019s where I went. And\nwhen I s-scanned the list, I didn\u2019t see any names from my family, any at all, but I saw\na name of my school girlfriend, and her address, which was not too far. And I went to\nher apartment. She lived with her husband, she was very happy to see me. She\nsurvived with her husband, she got married in ghetto. And when ghetto was being\nliquidated completely, after the great liquidations, there were two groups left. One\ngroup that I was with my mother in the hospital in on Wargevnitska. And the second\ngroup of 500 people, I believe, on Iyakuba in hiding. This 1s the only group that did\nnot leave fa -- Lodz, and survived in hiding because the Russians came to Poland just\nin time. We were taken at the last moment, in November.",
        "Q: How did you -- how did you feel, though, when you see no names from your\nfamily?",
        "A: [indecipherable] The emptiness, and the futility of survival. The futility of the\nyears of wishing and wanting and yearning to see somebody, to -- to live again, to --\nthe life was very bleak, that I had -- my feelings were that it wasn't worth survival. I\ndidn\u2019t know why I was chosen to survive. You must know that at that time I was not\nwell, I had bandages on me, I had no money, I had no possessions. I went to my\nfriend, I had some tapes put around me. You would be surprised how you can\nsurvive, how strong we are. The circumstances are just unbelievable. M-My friend at\nthis time, with her husband, were already in a very nice apartment, and they lived\nsome sort of normalized life. He was occupied with some enterprise, earning money,\nand I didn\u2019t feel very much wanted, since I did not have any family left, and Polish\npeople did not greet me very nicely. And I remember distinctly my bitterness that my\nPolish girlfriends did not come to see me when I went to ghetto, not one of them. My\ndear friends from school, of all these years. I decided to leave Poland. We have heard\nof displaced person camps in Germany, people who survived wi -- camps. And there\nwas another girl who survived as well, and I knew her, and the two of us decided to\nleave Poland and go to the camps.",
        "Q: This would probably be a good place to change, to stop --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: This concludes tape one, side A, interview with Blanka Rothschild.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Blanka Rothschild. This is tape number one, side B. Before we go on to\nGermany then, let me ask you this, how -- what got you through all of this? How do\nyou think you -- you survived? Was there anything in particular?",
        "A: I -- Lask myself that question many, many times, because it 1s -- 1t seems to me\nimprobable now. How did I cope with the situation? How did I survive, and why it\nwas me. It was combined with a sense of deep guilt that I was the one who survived.\nWhy I? I didn\u2019t feel worth it. There were people who were better in my family than I,\nand they didn\u2019t survive. They were younger, and some older. How did I go -- how\ndid I have this burst of energy to proceed to leave Poland, to think about it? Maybe it\nwas the -- the deep sense of bitterness towards people that I knew before the war who\nbetrayed me, because I thought this was betrayal. These were people who were\ncoming to my home, sleeping and eating, and I was helping them with work. I was\nfairly good student. And they did not know me when the war started. So leaving\nPoland was not as traumatic because there was nothing that I was leaving behind.",
        "Q: How did you leave, what [indecipherable |",
        "A: That\u2019s -- th-th -- these are amazing stories. You know, my -- my -- my -- my life\nis a -- like a kaleidoscope of different moments that collectively saved me. And it --\nthey came in the -- just the right moment. When I decided to leave with my friend\nIrka, her name was Irka, and strangely enough we shared the last name. We were not\n-- we were not related, but we were both Fisher. We decided to leave Poland and my\nfriend, in whose home I was staying, said to me, you know, I'll give you a couple of\nzlotys, which was the Polish money, very little, and she gave me two bottle of vodka.\nShe said, this is a very good trading mark with the Russians, if you need it. And it\nproved to be true. We were not bothered by any luggage because we had no\npossessions, neither one of us. Can you imagine this? I still wonder about it. The two\nof us went, we reached Posen -- Posinine -- Polish Posnine, Posen in German, a\nuniversity city which was on -- near the border, and we wanted to board a train which\nwas going to Germany. Now how do you board the train when you have no money or\nanything? Just so happened on this station, there -- there were -- the whole Russian\ncontingent of soldiers were sitting around waiting for this train. And Irka and I\ndecided to find one of the Russians, maybe he\u2019s Jewish, so he would help us. So we\nsaid to -- how do you find the Jew? How does Jew look like? Wha -- wa -- how we\ncan judge? We have to -- to chance. Or maybe we\u2019|l find somebody who is decent\nenough to help us. And we still have these vodka, covered of course, because the\nRussians and vodka, it\u2019s -- we walked -- they were making remarks as we were\npassing by, and we saw one tall individual in very long coat, reaching his ankles,\nwith a very prominent nose. And we said, do you think he might be Jewish? He was\nan officer, he had some insignia. And we approached him, and we asked -- we knew\nthe few words in Russian, Ve evrai means Jew in Russian. Ve evrai, and he said da.\nOh, that was first relief. We are little Polish, little Russian, we are two girls that are\nJewish, the families were killed. We have nobody. We want to leave Poland to go to\ndisplaced person camp. He offered to help us. He took us to his compartment, took\nhis filthy coat, the dirty pea coat, put us in the corner, and covered us with this --\nhanged this on a hook and covered us with this stinky coat, and he said, don\u2019t make a\nsound. And when the train started, he gave us some bread. He was very ni -- he -- we\ngave him the vodka, we were so delighted. And he said he was a dentist, and he said\nto us, don\u2019t go east, go west. And he said if he would have his wife, which was in one\nof the Russian cities [indecipherable] he wouldn\u2019t go back either. It -- it\u2019s\nunbelievable this -- the situations that I was involved with, the people that I met, the\npeople that did help me, that -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s a story after story after\nstory. And we reached Berlin after -- after stopping th -- at the border where we\nheard screaming because some women were being raped. I suppose German woman\nwere being raped by the Russians, and we were still under that coat, and we reached\nBerlin station, we got off, we thank him. We found two men that looked to us Jewish,\nand they were, and they gave -- put us on the bus, they paid the fare, they told us\nwhen to get off. Now, both of us spoke German. We got off and that was the first\nSchlactensee camp that we k -- arrived at.",
        "Q: And how did it go from there then, and so -- who -- who -- do you know who was\nministering that camp?",
        "A: I have no idea who was in charge, because I -- I was not too long in that place. I\ndon\u2019t want to sound snobbish, but it was difficult for me to get used to it. They did\ngive us a place to sleep and they did give us food, but we, both of us felt we would\nlike to -- and they helped us to -- to get a room by a German family, the first one,\nFrau Beans, I think, I don\u2019t remember, a war widow with a son and with her aunt.\nAnd we got a room there by her. It was not too far from Alexanderplatz in the\nRussian sector. We had some money, some ration cards. We lived like the Germans,\non a ration card at that time. It was still unbelievable that we survived to this point. I\ndid not have any joy of my freedom, because it was not the freedom that I was\nlonging for.",
        "Q: What would that freedom have been? Your family?",
        "A: My freedom would be, in my childish thinking, my freedom would be to be\nreunited with my family, and living a -- a normal life. Normal meant to me to be the\ncultural life. Something that I -- that I thirst for, I had hunger for it. That\u2019s why Irka\nand I, when we have this room, decided to go to a movie one day, because we wanted\nto start some sort of normal life. And we went to the movie, which was German\nmovie with Marie Carruk, I remember. I remember -- I don\u2019t remember the name of\nit, but I remember Marie Carruk, I don\u2019t know why. And once it was dark and the\nmovie was running, and we whispered to each other and all of a sudden we felt both\nus hands on our shoulders [indecipherable] and the Russians took us out of the o --\nmovie house. And we -- we couldn\u2019t understand, we were absolutely stunned. Well,\nwe spoke Polish to each other, so we were spies. Spiong. Crazy, crazy idea. Didn\u2019t\nwe go through enough? They took us to a si -- a station, Russian station\ncommandantura, sort of, and they had so many people they were get -- catching on\nstreets, people, Germans, that they opened that -- I remember a large wrought iron\ngates. They opened and they pushed us in and it was full of people that they caught\nfrom streets. You know, they were sending them to Siberia. And the two of us were\nthere too. Just so happened that that very day, Irka had a very bad toothache, and we\nwent to a dentist that the Jewish committee paid for, and he pulled her tooth. And it\nstarted to hurt her, and she started to cry. And she kept crying and they started to yell\nat her, they were annoyed that she was crying. And finally they were so annoyed that\nthey opened the gate and threw us out. This is another moment that saved us, because\nwe would have been sent with the rest of the people, God knows where. Once we\nwere thrown out, and went back to our room, the very next day I said to her, I\u2019m not\ngoing to st -- there were sectors, American, British, French and Russian. We were in\nthe Russian sector. Schlactensee was in the Russian sector. I said, I\u2019m going to go to\nAmerican sector, or English, or -- anything but. Now, th-the -- the [indecipherable]\nthat -- that train was going around Berlin to all the sectors. It -- at that time 1t was not\nclose, you could get on and get off. So how do you go -- everybody had to be\nregistered. You know, the German red tape, you have to be registered with polisi --\npolice. So what do we do? We were getting ration cards, certain rations from the\nAmerican relief organization, Jewish. There was a rabbi, with a --",
        "Q: Joint?",
        "A: Joint -- Joint Distribution, that\u2019s it, Joint Distribution. So we had some coffee and\ncigarettes. Now, to have coffee in Germany, you don\u2019t need diamonds after the war,\ncoffee was it. So our brains started to work, with this coffee, maybe they can register\nus in American sector. I can get rid of the coffee, anything just to get out from this\nterrible situation. And we left, we went to a police station in the American sector --\nunbelievable, is -- isn\u2019t it? It -- it\u2019s -- it -- it\u2019s like -- like make- up story. And we\ntalked to the German who was in charge, and I said, if you put our names there, here\nis the coffee, we just want to be in American sector. He understood because he also\nliked to be in American sector. He took the coffee, he put two -- two cards with our\nnames and registered us, and we never put a foot in the Russian sector again. We --\nno, Irka got herself some friend. Irka was a flirt, she was very pretty. I was always\nscared. I was always scared. So I applied and asked, and -- I don\u2019t remember this was\nthis was this German [indecipherable] of police that assigned me that -- to that room.\nNo, there was another camp, I was in another camp. That was Schlactensee, defin -- I\n-- [\u2019m mixing up. The first camp that I was was on Oranienbergerstrasse in the ru --\nRussian sector.",
        "Q: That was the Russian sector.",

        "Q: Schlactensee was the American --",
        "A: Schlacten -- Schlactensee -- you see, I mix -- I\u2019m sorry. Oranienbergerstrasse was\nthe first one, that was Russian sector. Then we went to Schlactensee, which was in\nAmerican sector. I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s so many years. And we were in Schlactensee, and we\nwere assigned places of course, and -- and I was there for awhile, and I didn\u2019t like it.\nI just didn\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t want to go into details, I just wanted to leave. I wanted to\nlive a little bit more normal. People were occupied doing things, going pl -- pl --\ndriving, making money. I-I was a lost soul, I didn't want to have --",
        "Q: Sort of black market activity [indecipherable |",
        "A: Sort of, yes. The exchanging stuff. They were going to Breslau and back, to\nBrotswow. I was never that enterprising. So all I wanted is to have a -- a private room\nsomewhere and -- and be left alone. And I went to the American Jewish chaplain and\nthere was some sergeant there who ask me if I have relatives in the United States. So\nI said, all I know is that my maternal grandmother had a sister and half a brother.\nAnd the sister lived in Detroit. So I gave him the name that I remembered, because I\nhad really nothing to do with them, and their name was Polsonsky, that\u2019s all I knew.\nAnd we received the ration cards and Irka got herself a -- a -- a gentleman. And I was\ngiven the room by Frau Pegello on Tanaustrasseactsane. Yes.",
        "Q: You still remember that.",
        "A: I still remember that. And there was a nice room, and I stayed there, and from\ntime to time I was going to this Joint Distribution, getting my ration there. I still had\ntough times. I still didn\u2019t feel that this is the freedom that I longed for, and I said\nwhat -- what life holds for me again? Wh-What I\u2019m gonna do? I didn\u2019t want to stay\nin Germany. I didn\u2019t want to stay in a country that I suffered, and that killed my\nfamily. I didn\u2019t want to live in Poland because this was a country that I grew up,\ncountry that I loved, country that -- whose language and literature and music I loved,\nand where people with whom I grew up didn\u2019t want me, so I didn\u2019t want them. The\nidea of going -- at this time there was no Israel or Palestine, wouldn\u2019t apply to me\nbecause I was too sick, I was not capable of any work. And America was the only\nsolution. About six months later I received a letter from the Joint Distribution, they\nlocated my family in Detroit. Family that changed the name, from Polsonsky to\nSouls.",
        "Q: That\u2019s amazing.",
        "A: It\u2019s amazing. You see, as I said collectively, all these little things, like beads in the\nnecklace, one was next and next and next. Evidently, when I have bad times, and\ndoubts, why -- why did I survive, and all this [indecipherable] they say, well you\nwere meant to survive and there was a purpose to -- to keep you alive. You\npropagate, you have a lovely daughter, and you have a wonderful grandchild. You\nhave now small family, but it\u2019s your own. I carved myself a niche 1n this liv -- living\nhere. And --",
        "Q: We'll talk about that some more, in more detail a little later. So how did you get to\nAmerica then?",
        "A: Well, they -- I had to wait for my turn for the visa to -- to this family. And the\nfamily, the half-brother of my grandmother lived in New Jersey. And his s-sons-in-\nlaw were attorneys. One was even prominent in Republican party. A water\ncommissioner from New Jersey. So they speeded up the process of -- to obtain visa\nfor me. And I was awaiting that result in this apartment, Frau Pegello, who after\nawhile warmed up to me, and wasn\u2019t afraid of me any more, and Frau Pegello always\ntold me, Fraulein Fisher, Miss Fisher, I am an old lady, I\u2019m over 90, I have seen a lot.\nI was a Nazi and all my neighbors were Nazis. And now nobody was Nazi, only I.\nWell -- well, we ended up as sort of friends. I said, I want you to learn about me, who\nI am, and -- and we -- we parted on friendly terms.

        "A: Bremerhaven, I think. I think Bremerhaven. On Marine Marlin, which was an\narmy transporter, used to transport the army back and forth. And this was another\npiece of injustice that I suffered, because we, the people who were -- some survivors\nthat were booked on this line were put in the very bottom of the boat, and the top\nwere reserved for the German war brides. So we were again nothing down there. To\ntop this off, we s -- we sailed in December of \u201946, and we encounter a horrible storm.\nWe lost part of the bow, and we were 16 days on the ocean. Everybody, including the\ncrew, was deathly sick. We were throwing up our guts, nobody could eat. And we\nwere wondering if -- why did we survive to die in the middle of the ocean? And that\nwas the trip. So -- and it was a gehanah.",

And I\nwas sitting there, and people were coming and picking up the -- the newcomers.\nNobody was coming for me, and I know that my family sponsored me and knew that\nI was coming. I was sitting there, almost the last one, and finally I saw a gentleman\nwalking by waving a photo. And the photo was of my grandmother. And I said to\nhim, my grand -- in Polish, and he didn\u2019t speak Polish. I said, speak German? No, he\ndoesn\u2019t speak, he only speaks English, American [indecipherable] only English. No\nPolish, no German, no Russian, no French, English. But he picked me out by hand\nand we walked out and there at the outside door stood an elderly gentleman with gray\nhair -- white, snow white hair with pink cheeks and blue eyes and I knew that\u2019s my\nfamily because he looked like my grandmother, and that was her half brother. And\nthis was his son-in-law who picked me up, he -- this was the lawyer. Now the story\nwas that I was supposed to go to my grandmother\u2019s sister in Detroit. What happened\nwas that it took our ship to sail for so many days that the elderly lady who so\nanxiously awaited my arrival, died just prior to the boat docking in New York. And\nthe family from Detroit let know the family in New Jersey that I am arriving on this\nship and somebody should pick me up because they are her funeral. Story. And they\ntook me to their place in New Jersey, and m-my great-uncle\u2019s wife spoke Polish and\nGerman, and was -- this was the first moment that I had some warmth, that -- this\nolder lady, whom I loved.",

And my mother was in Strussen, so she went there, where we were\nsupposed to be, by this German, I think his name was Zifer, who said you will be my\ngroup. Sort of like a Schindler.

        "A: Well, I arrived in New Jersey because the family to whom I was supposed to go in\nDetroit, there the lady who was my grandmother\u2019s sister passed away, and they let\nthe New Jersey part of the family know of my arrival. I was picked up at the pier, and\nI stayed with them, since Detroit was busy with the funeral and the mourning period.\nI stayed for couple of weeks in New Jersey, and I developed a very warm friendship\nwith the great-uncle, and his wife, who was an elder -- elderly, charming lady,\nspeaking few languages, and she endeared herself to me, because she made me feel at\nhome. It was warm, it was not anything material that I needed, I needed -- I needed\nlove and affection, and that\u2019s what she gave me. But after couple of weeks they sent\nfor me to go to Detroit. They put me on a train in a very beautiful, luxurious car. I\nwas sitting with the chair facing the window, turn around chair, I remember, and they\ngave the porter extra money to take care of me because I couldn\u2019t speak the language,\nto bring me food and so forth. And it was a long trip, and when the train arrived in\nDetroit, a whole group of people ar -- were awaiting me. Now, at this time, I forgot to\nmention that when I was leaving Germany, I was still having some ration from the\nJoint. I had some coffee, cigarettes, and I never smoked. So I decided to change this\nfor some decent clothes. So I received for my cigarettes [indecipherable] some fur\ncoat. Some -- I -- [indecipherable] I-I think 1t was, and a nice hat, and I looked -- I\nwanted to look presentable when I was arriving. So when J arrived in Detroit in this\ncoat, and white gloves, and I looked -- I suppose I was already nourished because in -\n- Joint gave us food, and in -- in New Jersey I was getting good food and care. So I\ncame -- I -- I looked almost human. They were all stunned. I don\u2019t know what did\nthey expect? Some spectacle? Somebody wh-who is from beyond the moon? Who --\nof course, I didn\u2019t speak English, but here I looked like a lady. And they brought me\nhome. The older lady and her husband were very nice and they spoke some German,\nso there was some communication. But they had only daughter who was, well, I must\nsay she had two degrees from various universities, but that doesn\u2019t make a person\nvery bright, or very polite. And she made my life miserable. She resented me. I was\nthe attention gathering point. My -- that -- that -- the daughter-in-law of this old lady\nthat died wanted to be very nice to me. She was very nice lady. She was patroness of\narts and music, and I could communicate with her because I loved it. And her\ndaughter resented every single thing that I -- I did or said. They sent me to a night\nschool to learn English. And this was a class composed of elderly people who came\nhere very early as -- I suppose 1-in the 1910 or 20\u2019s. They worked all their lives and\nnow that they were retired they were -- wanted to learn the proper language. So after\na few weeks, the teacher said, my dear, this is not a class for you, because y-you will\nlearn rapidly in a different class. And I stopped going there. What I really wanted\nwas to have a good medical care, but my family, for some reason, did not take me to\ndoctors.",
        "Q: Did you ask them to?",
        "A: No. I wouldn\u2019t ask.",
        "Q: Did they know how --",
        "A: They knew, but this was healed by this time. It was crooked, you can still touch it,\nhow crooked it is, but I didn\u2019t ask. I -- I just -- I never partook of anything that\nwelfare had to offer, or my family had to offer. I just wasn\u2019t brought up this way. So,\nway -- since I was here, I did not bother with that aspect, and it wasn\u2019t that noticeable\nat that time. And I -- I -- the family did not understand that I had pride, I didn\u2019t want\nto be given few cents. I was walking without a penny in my pocket. Now, when -- I\nwanted to work, I wanted to earn some money. Now, they took me to a bakery one\nday, and I was supposed to sell bread and cut bread, but evidently I wasn\u2019t fast\nenough, so after the whole day work, they dismissed me without pay. And I -- I came\nhome and everyone said, you didn\u2019t get paid? You have to get pay anyway. I said,\nbut they didn\u2019t like my work. So I didn\u2019t get any pay. So that was the end of the\nbakery. But I still didn\u2019t like being so dependant. I wanted to -- my independence.\nAnd I -- I was very unhappy with the daughter\u2019s treatment of me, so I decided to get\na job on my own. Now, Detroit has a large Polish population, and I went to that\nPolish sector -- these are people who live here many years, but Polish 1s still the\nlanguage of the house. I got my serve -- sort of menial job working on camera cases,\non -- I don\u2019t remember exactly, but I think it was --",
        "Q: Don\u2019t go quite so close to the microphone, just --",
        "A: [ -- I -- I think I was getting about 18 dollars a week. I -- those days, I -- and my\nfamily -- so-called family was absolutely stunned. You don\u2019t have to work, you have\nbed, and you have food, and you have -- I want to be independent. I don\u2019t want to ask\nfor 10 cents, if I want ice cream cone for instance, I just don\u2019t want to. So I decided\nto save the money enough for a ticket to go back to New York, and to the family in\nNew Jersey that I loved, that old lady. Now, the old lady with her husband in New\nJersey, who was my grandmother\u2019s half-brother, they were retired people in not too\ngreat financial situation. Their children were quite well off, but they lived a very\nnice, middle income group. And I got myself -- they accepted me with open arms,\nand I got myself -- I went to nursing class. By that time I was already rapidly learning\nthe language, reading, going to movies, picking up quickly. And I -- I couldn\u2019t go for\nthree years, so I went for a short course in private -- private nursing to take care of\nnewborn infants. I loved babies, and I didn\u2019t have to speak to them. And I got my\ndiploma, and my very first job that I had was with the doctor from the family who\nrecommended me to another doctor, they had new baby. And I became part of their\nfamily, they -- they were just -- till today. Till today I am in touch with them. And\nmy very first pay I gave to my aunt, and I said, now I\u2019m independent, I can pay. And\nit was a wonderful feeling. But the -- the freedom had a fringe always, of guilt. The\nsurvivor guilt. And I -- I was not the very happy person that I was before the war.",
        "Q: Could you -- could you talk to anybody about your experience? Did anybody ask\nyou, did they want to know how was --",
        "A: Well, people knew that bad things happened to me, but they thought that by\navoiding the subject they did not make me feel bad going back to it. And I thought\nmaybe even for therapeutic reasons I should have talked about it, and I did not start\nmy talking until quite late. It developed as my own project and it grew by word of\nmouth.",

Oh, that\u2019s just terrible, let\u2019s not talk about it. They thought that they did me a\nfavor not to go back into it. But I felt that since we were getting on, getting a little\nolder, and older, and something has to be said, something has to be aired. And when\nthe museum came into being, this was for me a -- a tremendous step. But by that time\nI was speaking already on my own.",
        "Q: Yeah, well, we\u2019ll get back to that a little later. So you were -- you now had to\nwork, and you felt independent.",
        "A: I felt independent.",
        "Q: Did you make friends?",
        "A: I made friends m-m-mainly were in the class, the nursing class that I was. I was a\nlarge group of people and I made some friends, I was invited for Christmas holiday,\nfor the Christmas tree and so forth, and we became friends, yes. And the people for\nwhom I worked, I was always very fortunate, I -- I worked for people who treated me\nas a member of a family, as an equal. Not like that cousin\u2019s daughter who made me\nfeel very inferior, and th-that\u2019s what I said, you don\u2019t need the college degrees to be\nabsolutely a -- a miserable, evil person. Knowing intelligence from book doesn\u2019t\nmake you a whole person.",
        "Q: Did you take -- take part in -- in Jewish -- in the Jewish community and activities -",
        "A: Not -- no, not in the beginning, no. I am not really very religious person. It would\nbe very difficult, even if I would have been, to continue being very rely -- religious.\nAs I said in my tape, some people lost their faith completely, and some people died\nwith the name of God on their lips. So my family, my father and my mother were no\n-- were very free thinkers. They were not very observant. My grandparents were. Th-\nThe older family. And we spent holidays together, which the memories of this I\ntreasure. That is the warmth, this is -- you ask me before what gave me the\nbackground, the strength. The strength, part of it, is due to the basic background of\nthe person. Of the family, of the ethical, moral upbringing of the behavior and of the\nsense of obligation to society and to myself and I always said that, if people ask me\nabout religion I said I -- I am not very organized in religion, but if I obey the\ncommandments, I\u2019m religious. It doesn\u2019t have to have a label. I don\u2019t do anything\nthat they say don\u2019t. And I -- and I do respect people and respected my parents, and I\ndidn\u2019t steal and I -- thou shall not kill. Yes, I am that kind of p -- th-therefore I am\nreligious. So I never thought that I needed a house of worship to make me religious.\nA human being can be religious, like my father said, that God surrounds us in -- in\nthe nature. When you sit at a bank of the river, as I did with my father, and we\nwatched the flow of the water, and the little ducks on it, and the flowers and trees,\nthis -- this 1s part of my religion.",
        "Q: Did you want to have a family at that time, and 1s that what you wanted your\nfamily to grow into, that kind of --",
        "A: When I survived and came here, this was the uppermost thing in my mind. I\nwanted a child so badly, because I felt that I owed this to my family. I wanted a child\nto show Hitler that I conquered him. And when my granddaughter -- the strange part\nhere is that I, my mother was not religious, my father was not religious, I was not\nreligious. My daughter is not religious, but she sent her daughter to Hebrew school,\nand her daughter had Bat Mitzvah, which neither she, nor I, nor my mother had. And\nI spoke at that Bat Mitzvah, and at one point I said, 1f I remember verbatim, that\nsome honorable people up there must be smiling today, because our seed survived\nafter all. I addressed this to my granddaughter. She is -- she\u2019s the one who is carrying\non. So sometimes -- and when I was pregnant, when I wanted to get pregnant, my\ndoctor said, this will be very bad for you, your back. It will throw you off completely.\nI said, it\u2019s worth it.

        "A: No, no. He was born in Germany, and his parents, a middle-class family, had six\nchildren, and in 1935 - six - seven, started to send the children out, one by one out of\nGermany. And they followed them in 1938. So this was wise, because if -- some very\nwealthy people didn\u2019t leave because nobody could believe what would happen. I\nmean, it was just unthinkable. But they survived because they were just middle class\npeople, they sent one by one the children here. My husband arrived here as a boy,\nwent to high school and high school, and started university in Rochester, but had a\nvery tough time financially, and had to -- he worked anyway. And I met my mother-\nin-law first, before I met my husband, as a -- as a nurse. And she was a dear, sweet,\nwonderful lady, who she -- when she lived in Brooklyn on a f -- low floor, the\nwindow was open and theres was sitting Frau Rochelle with cookies, and gave\neverybody cookies, and she was known in the whole neighborhood. And when she --\nwhen I took care of -- took care of -- was it that child in the hospital? But I got to\nknow her, and I visited her. And way -- she said, I have a son, a very nice boy. And\nlater when she talked to Harry over the phone, because Harry lived on the west coast,\nshe said, she\u2019s not only nice girl [speaks German here], she speaks German. That was\nto her -- because she didn\u2019t speak English, so to her this was just wonderful. And I\nmet my husband, she went to west coast, her si -- her daughter lived in Oregon, and\nthey sent for me, just like that, and I started -- first I corresponded with him. And I\nmet him and we went to Justice of Peace, I didn\u2019t have any wedding.",
        "Q: So what did you like about him?",
        "A: Pll tell you what I liked about him. I met some people in New York that were\ninterested that I -- but I couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t find really what I would have done\nbefore the war. I was not that desirable either, because I was not that well. I had to\ncompromise somehow. I wanted somebody who\u2019s nice, who has had some things that\nwe shared, love for music, love for animals, love for nature. We are otherwise very\ndifferent people. But I had to settle for certain things. My husband will like operas, I\nlike classical music. My husband will read certain things, I love to read, I\u2019m an avid\nreader. I enlarge my vocabulary, English, by reading. I went to community college to\nbetter myself. I -- I -- under normal circumstances, I suppose I would have gone on\nand on because, education. My husband, education 1s important to him, but he was\nnot as fast in it, and he worked, he made very mediocre living. I was happy. I mean,\nthis was not the most important things. I wanted to create a home and atmosphere\ninto which I bring the child and teach her from the very early on, love for music, love\nfor the word -- written word, and I succeeded.",
        "Q: Yes, you did.",
        "A: Yes, I succeeded.",
        "Q: When was she born, and what\u2019s her name?",
        "A: Her na --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] a little bit about her.",
        "A: My daughter -- well, when it came to naming her, my mother was Ann -- Anna --\nAnnemarie. So, Anna. My husband lost a sister in childbirth, her name was Rose, and\nI didn\u2019t like Rose. So we -- we made Rochelle Ann. And aftia -- after awhile we\ndropped the Ro because the kids in school teased her, roach. So it was Shell Ann.\nAnd now it\u2019s Shelly. Now she\u2019s Shelly. And she -- she has Master\u2019s degree in\nadvanced English from England. She writes, and she works for Santa Monica\ncollege, for the students. Her husband is from England, he\u2019s an attorney. And Alexis\n-- Alexis wants to be --",
        "Q: That\u2019s your granddaughter?",
        "A: My granddaughter is Alexis, Alexis Danielle. She wants to study environment law\n-- environment. She wants to save the world.",
        "Q: Good for her. We\u2019ll get to her a little later, I still would like to stay with your\ndaughter.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: When was she born, and what kind of parenting ideas did you have for her?",
        "A: Okay, she was born in March 22\", 1951, and I have to say that I was a little bit\nbrainwashed being in United States, by Dr. Salk. Dr. -- no, no, doctor -- not Dr. Salk.",
        "Q: Was -- was he the famous --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, the child --",
        "Q: Oh, Dr. Spo --",
        "A: Dr. Spock, Dr. Spock. I had his book, this was my bible, because I didn\u2019t know\nmuch about it. So I had Dr. Spock book, and I believed that the mother doesn\u2019t work,\nmother has to be home, mother has to bring up the child. Well -- well, my financial\nsituation was very precarious, we lived on a walk-up in the Bronx on the fourth floor,\none bedroom, which I gave to my child. We slept in the living room on a couch. I\nbelieved in the education. I was singing to her, reading to her, and she had dancing\nclasses. I -- I would have gone out without anything, but she had to have things that I\nthought were important, and she -- she was taught she will be polite, she was taught\nproper manners. Well, she became American very soon, you know, after the -- with\nschool, and the peer pressure, you know, that -- she was fairly good student, not the\nbest. She -- she did not try to achieve her potential, sometimes was lazy. But she\ndeveloped very, very good background culturally. She 1s avid reader, she 1s avid\ntheater-goer, she loves music. And Alexis plays piano beauti -- my daughter started\nto play piano but we gave up after I saw it was no use. It was no use. I had piano\nlessons and I wasn\u2019t good either. So I must admit, I wasn\u2019t good. My -- my -- my two\nuncles were pianists, but I didn\u2019t in-inherit this, and neither she did, did she? Alexis\nplays piano, but also she\u2019s not a pianist. She plays piano.",
        "Q: How did she di -- how did you teach limits, though?",
        "A: A very, very difficult in United States, because she would say, her mother let her\ndo this, or -- I said, well -- there was a saying in my house. She -- her best friend was\nbrought up in a very free house, very free. At the age of nine, she could go\n[indecipherable] hang out, or go to a movie or something. And she said Annie can go.\nI said, you can\u2019t go. So she used to -- she wanted to hurt me, she didn\u2019t know how.\nSo she said, you\u2019re such a continental mother. This was the worst she could come up\nwith. I was a -- I said yes, that\u2019s your misfortune. I -- I set the limits on -- to a certain\npoint. When -- Annie was brilliant, her best friend. No doubt about it, extremely high\nIQ. She went to Bronx High School of Science. My daughter didn\u2019t, my daughter\nwent just to high school. She was permitted to -- to do things, some her own. Her\nteacher told her mother that she reached the top, they can\u2019t teach her any more. Annie\nbecame some sort of a failure in life. They still communicate, they love one another,\nthey -- when Annie used to come to my house -- we lived in the same building, too.\nWhen a -- she used to come to my house, or -- I insisted on open door. This was one\nof my -- because Annie I didn\u2019t trust. Annie\u2019s smoking, and things -- what she was\nsmoking. My daughter didn\u2019t smoke. I said, I\u2019m not going to sit and preach to you\nthat it\u2019s bad for your health, but I said, look what\u2019s happening to these people later\non. You -- you have brain, use it. She never did.",
        "Q: You mean drugs?",
        "A: Drugs and things. Never did. Neither did Alexis, I\u2019m very fortunate. Neither did\nmy son, you know. Well, he was brought up by very square people in England. So we\nwere very lucky there. I never pressed on her any strong beliefs, she develop her\nown. You know, we had many arguments, a number of them, yes, because I tried to\nfoolishly spare her some of the disappointments in life. But evidently you have to go\nthrough the experience yourself to learn. And I wanted to spare her the hard lessons.\nSo sometimes it was backfiring. However, at the end she realized that maybe I was\nright after all. So --",
        "Q: Did she ask you -- did you talk to her at a certain point about what happened to\nyou? Did she -- when was --",
        "A: I la -- I never made a secret of my past, but she herself had -- her -- her love for\nme 1s so deep, so intense, that she did not want to know the details, til today. She\ncannot stand listening to how they did it to me, and what they did to me. For instance,\nthey pulled my wisdom teeth without anesthesia, learning. And at one point, and I\ndon\u2019t remember it was Ravensbriick, somebody pulled my teeth, yeah.",
        "Q: [inaudible]",
        "A: For instance, when we arrived in Ravensbruck, we were subjected to the medical\nexam. We had to be stripped naked in front of the men there and put on the chair with\nlegs up, I never saw this. They were looking for valuables, and -- and they were\nlaughing because we were virgins, few of us there. This -- 1t was very humiliating --\nhumiliating, degrading experience, that she wouldn\u2019t want to hear, and she wanted to\nspare me, le -- don\u2019t think about it. When I had bad dream, don\u2019t -- get away from.\nTil today she cannot stand my -- she feels sometime that I am too pessimistic, that I\nhave bad moments, and she calls every night. Every single night. And no matter,\neven if we had argument, which we do, she ends up with I love you. Because she\nonce said, I never want to be sorry that I never said to my mother I love you when\nshe was here. That some people say it\u2019s too late, I should have told my mother this\nand this. We are friends as well as mother and daughter, and that 1s wonderful.",
        "Q: Yeah. I have to change the tape again. This --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Blanka Rothschild. This is tape number two, side B. So we just talked about\nyour daughter.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And your very close relationship to her. It just occurred to me that in a sense that\nyou have not recreated, but -- but cre -- created something close to the relationship\nthat you had with your own mother, and your grandmother. And now you have very\nclose relationship with your daughter, and it -- one child, you were one child, too. It\u2019s\nan interesting progression, and your grandchild is very close --",
        "A: Very close. As matter of fact, she was here this weekend, spent with us, went with\nher Papa to the zoo, and here -- and Nana makes what she likes to eat, and we have\nbe --",

        "A: Nana and Papa.",
        "Q: Nana, that\u2019s you.",
        "A: Yes. Very, very close relationship. As -- my relation with my mother was more\nformal than my daughter and myself. We are more friends. Where with my mother\nthere was a -- a -- some formality, some respect, which here in the United States is a |\n-- sometimes a little absent. I sometimes wouldn\u2019t dare to approach my mother in a\nmanner that my daughter will come to me. However, we very freely express the love\nfor one another, and my daughter calls me nightly, saying I love you, Mom. And [Il\nsay I love you, no matter how angry I can be at her. So -- and this is the closeness.\nMy mother-in-law -- my mother, for instance, prior to the outbreak of the war, was\nbeing courted by a -- a physician, because my dad passed away couple of years. And\nshe tried to keep me still very, very young. She used to come home in the evening,\nand she\u2019d say, 1s the child asleep, and I was 14. So th-this didn\u2019t happen with my\ndaughter and me. That -- that was a little bit different.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- still, it is a very close --",
        "A: Oh yes, very close fami -- yes, absolutely. This -- this is as -- as I said previously,\nthis is my -- my solid background that -- the basis that gave me that push to survive\nand to live and to continue.",
        "Q: So how was survival in America, then? You continued to work? You had a\ndaughter, what -- where -- where -- where are we? We are now in --",
        "A: When I got married.",
        "Q: Yeah, but when did you get married?",
        "A: December 22\u2122, 1949.",
        "Q: In \u00b049.",
        "A: It\u2019s going to be 50 years this December. And we got married on the 22\u2122 of\nDecember because he had day off on Christmas, and we had no money, so there was\nvery -- just right. I remember a small, little detail, we went to the store to look for a\nwedding band, and the clerk said which one would you like, and I said, I would like\nthe cheapest. Yes, because it didn\u2019t matter to me.",
        "Q: It\u2019s -- it\u2019s lovely though. It\u2019s a small, delicate -- delicate band.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: So then the 50\u2019s approached.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you feel -- wa -- di -- do you remember when you began to feel comfortable\nin this country, or in your identity as American?",
        "A: The beginning was tough. I still had my European way of thinking. My\nupbringing. The -- certain things bothered me. I --",
        "Q: Like what, example?",
        "A: Sometimes there are bra -- they were abrasive, the Americans. I used to go to the\nsubway, and I used to get up and give my seat away, and people thought I was crazy,\nbut I was brought up this way. I couldn't understand otherwise. There were young\nkids spread around with the legs sticking out, they wouldn\u2019t dream of getting up. I\ncouldn\u2019t under -- this. In my mind, I criticized this. I ate differently, I used my fork\nand knife differently. I was different. It took me time. Not that -- funny part is I\nlearned to eat chicken drumstick with my hand now, and I think it\u2019s very\ncomfortable. I really like it. But I wouldn\u2019t dare to do it at home. No, the beginning\nwas tough. And the lack of the -- the knowledge of the language makes it very tough.\nAnd then you see people who even were kind towards the newcomers, still called us\nuh -- these are the -- they don\u2019t know much, they\u2019re from Poland, what do they\nknow? And I thought to myself, they don\u2019t really know me. They don\u2019t know my\npotential, and to them I was -- I was just the newcomer, a displaced person. What is a\ndisplaced person? A person who was chased away from somewhere and came here in\norder to rebuild their life. But that person, even though may not use your language\nyet, or your customs, can be equal, or sometimes even maybe superior to the people\nwho criticize her. So the beginning wasn\u2019t easy.",
        "Q: Did you feel that Americans knew about -- w-were they knowledgeable about th-\nthe Holocaust, especially what survivors had gone through?",
        "A: Nobody who is not walking in the shoes can understand fully what has happened.\nYou have to suffer to understand somebody else suffering. My -- my experience with\nthe family, for instance, with their daughter, she was minimizing everything, and I\nwas -- I -- I wouldn\u2019t talk about my experiences, because I felt that I created a\ndisruption in the family by my coming there. I didn\u2019t feel comfortable. I wanted to be\non my own. So my beginning was difficult, un-until I went back to New Jersey and\nstarted working. And then I got married. Even after I got married, my English wasn\u2019t\n-- getting better, not as fluent as it is now, I am more articulate with the passage of\ntime because I made my business to learn the language properly. And I will never get\nrid of my accent, but I will speak correctly, hopefully. I don\u2019t say don\u2019t, he don\u2019t, I\nmean, like, like, you know, you know. I try to avoid this, and I can see this in my\nown family, but th-this is something that makes me me.",
        "Q: You should never lose your accent. When -- when did things get a little easier for\nyou then?",
        "A: Well, when I had my child, it wasn\u2019t easy. I was very happy because I had the\nchild, and I wanted a daughter the worst way. I was so partial to it that sometimes it\nscared me, because the doctor said I should -- if I attempt to have a child, I shouldn\u2019t\nhave -- try again, because of my health. So I said, oh, if there is any power, anything\n-- | wanted a daughter because a daughter usually is closer to mother than a son. And\nwhen I had a daughter, I was absolutely in seventh heaven. At that time my husband\nworked nights because he had 15 percent bonus for working nights. We lived in New\nYork, and I lived on this fourth floor. And of course my pains came in the middle of\nthe night when he wasn\u2019t home. So we had prepared a telephone near my -- telephone\n-- maternity [indecipherable] sort of, and I called him, and the man downstairs came,\nhe says, come down. I says what do you mean come down, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I have\npains. I -- I had to walk down with my little piece of luggage down. It was a plain\nman with a car, who made himself maternity -- and he took me to the hospital in the\nmiddle of the night. I walked with this little luggage, with the pain, and they ask me,\nare you married? Because who comes alone to have a baby in the middle of the night.\nSo I said, what do you think? So this was funny. And of course, after I had my -- my\ndaughter, I was absolutely deliriously happy. And I totally devoted myself to\nbringing her up. And the result is good. It paid off. And we are very close. We share\nmany interests. Well, they are diverse. For instance, our taste in literature is a little\ndifferent. And I adopted some love of the new music, because after all I had a\nteenager home, a girl, so I could tolerate The Beatles, for instance. But when the new\ngroups started coming, I couldn\u2019t take this, quite. You know, it -- an-and especially\nnow, it -- it\u2019s a lot of vulgarity and -- and in the movements and in the -- in the lyrics,\nso-called. And this 1s -- this is totally u-undesirable.",
        "Q: When you began to make friends here, were they other survivors, or was it a -- a\nrange of people?",
        "A: No, strangely enough, when I moved to New York City, because I got married on\nwest coast, we -- we decided to come back because my husband\u2019s mother became ill\nwith cancer, and I said, I lost my family, and I love your mother, we have to go back\nto New York. And I was pregnant. We arranged rides from city to city, sharing\nexpenses until we reached -- reached New York. And we got an apartment at this\nwalk-up in the Bronx, and I see my mother-in-law deteriorating, but she did see her\ngranddaughter born. And I loved her. I respected her. What else can --",
        "Q: I asked -- I asked about friends.",
        "A: About friends, yes. We moved to this building in the Bronx, and there were no\nsurvivors that I knew in that building, but we became then the really good friends,\nbecause we were in the same, at that time, little lower middle class financially\npeople, but with the same hopes and aspirations. We wanted our children to be\neducated, and th -- to have a decent upbringing. I learned how to play Mahjong. And\nI played Mahjong with the ladies. And they were one Italian lady, Connie, whom I\nadore, and three Jewish ladies, one in my building, two across the street. It was safe\nto walk out on the street in the evening. When I took my baby in the carriage, we\nwalked to that park in the evening because it was hot, there was no air conditioning,\nand the apartment was s-stifling, and nobody was afraid because the times were\ndifferent. And we -- I met the other mothers with carriages there. And the -- it wasn\u2019t\neasy, but it was a happy time, because I had what I wanted. Of course, financially\nwas a little difficult. We never hit if off really, but it -- it -- it -- it didn\u2019t matter to me\nthat much because I saw what can happen. We had so much and we lost it overnight.\nSo, the priorities changed. What was important was to have good family and enough\nto eat and be dressed and go to s -- schools are free here, libraries are free here, which\nis wonderful. People don\u2019t know, there are so many free. We used to go to Lewison\nstadium those days for free concerts. I took the baby in the blanket and we were\nsitting like in a amphitheater, around, and listen to concerts. It was free, it was\nwonderful. So if you partake of what the city could offer you, it is not the amount of\nmoney that people try to amass more, the greed is so enormous. They never have\nenough. My priority was not to amassing wealth, but wealth of cultural things, of\ngood life, and I hope that in some measure, I achieved it.",
        "Q: Since you mentioned The Beatles, let\u2019s just say we are in the 60\u2019s somewhere.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Which events out of the 60\u2019s, say, remain as events that were -- had an impact on\nyour life? Can you -- whether here in the U.S., or in Israel.",
        "A: The Seven Day War, you mean?",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know, anything that --",
        "A: Well, as I previously s -- mentioned, I am not religious, however, I have a strong\nfeel of Judaic tradition in me, because it is -- it is ethical, it\u2019s moral and it is\nmisunderstood. And I thought that my people deserved to have their homeland after f\n-- millennia of suffering. And the creation of the state of Israel meant an -- a lot to\nme. I was deliriously happy when Israel came into bene -- being, because it gave\nhome and hope to countless people who didn\u2019t have it. I remember one event on -- at\nMadison Square Garden, there was a big gathering on -- that was on the eve of the\nSix Day War, I don\u2019t remember the date, but Golda Meir was speaking, and I got\nthere in, with a friend of mine. And they were holding that Israeli flag and people\nwere just throwing money in it. And I had very little, but whatever I had, I put it in,\nbecause it was an -- I -- I was elated that the people deserved it, they should have it,\nand -- the homeland. So, I myself could not fit into the life there, because you have to\nbe strong, you have to be healthy. My life I made in United States, I\u2019m very happy\nhere. I became an excellent citizen, my husband and I, because we are civically mind\npeople. We are volunteers; my husband in hospitals four days a week, and I with my\nspeaking and helping, and I was a school mother. I went on every trip with this class.\nI was always he- helping. Of course, without remuneration, just because I thought it\u2019s\nnecessary. And -- you know. Yes?",
        "Q: I -- I want to talk about in -- in -- in depth, really, about your work a little later.\nFor the time being, I would just like to ask you t-two more questions. Did you go to\nIsrael?",
        "A: I went once.",
        "Q: When was that?",
        "A: After the Six Day War. Six Day War, it was -- when the wall --",
        "Q: So it was [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- in Jerusalem was liberated. Now, the trip to Israel was, my husband had a sister\nin Israel, who was sent by the parents prior -- in the 1930\u2019s, early 1930\u2019s. So we went\nto his sister. And she had three daughters [indecipherable] were married and the --\nthe -- the sons-in-law took us with the car, we went to Jerusalem. This I have to say, I\nhave to mention this. For somebody who is not religious, when I walked in\nJerusalem, this was one of the biggest impacts on my life. When I touched the wall,\nsomething happened to me, because it was like a link in history. I touched the wall\nthat for so many years was important to my history. I remember my grandfather\nhaving the sign for Jerusalem in his room, because every Jew\u2019s hope was someday to\nbe in Jerusalem. I walked the streets that Christ allegedly walked, the 14 station of\ncross, and something happened to me. I was walking on the cobbled streets that Jesus\nwalked. It was important to me, historically. I went to the Mosque, to the Grand\nMosque. I took my shoes off, paid my respects. I went there and I went down and I\nsaw the huge rack that was supposed to be the sacrificial -- he was supposed to\nsacrifice his son there, Isaac, and God stopped him. So all these things that you read -\n- | have books on -- on all the world\u2019s religions here, because I was interested, the\nimpact of Jerusalem, it was very deep, emotionally, spiritually, and -- and I thought\nto myself, if people only would know -- all three great religions are meet in this little\nplace, if we could learn how to get along. The Arabs say Salaam, and we say Shalom,\nit\u2019s so much alike. Both are Semitic. Yugoslavia, all these people, it -- it\u2019s religion\ndivides them, why? Why\u2019?",
        "Q: Did you see the Yad Vashem, too?",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: What -- what was that whole experience? Did you learn something that you didn\u2019t\nknow?",
        "A: Yes, I -- I learned so -- a very powerful lesson, [Il tell you what. Yad Vashem,\nwhen I went in, I was in the gallery, af -- that was only once, and so many years ago,\nand I looked in the somber, dark cham -- chamber, with the names of the camps. I -- I\nbroke down, I cried, because I thought of the people who did not survive. And when I\nleft Yad Vashem, and I opened the door, and I walked out, and that was very sunny\nday, and there was this street with the trees, and -- called the Avenue of Righteous\nGentiles, with the name of the Righteous Gentiles underneath each tree, this was my\ngreatest impact of Israel, because I was not aware, up through that moment, that there\nwere Gentiles who did help. This was the very first time. Nobody told me about that\nbefore, I don\u2019t know why. That people did help, and people paid the supreme\nsacrifice, that people cared. I thought nobody did. And this, in itself, motivated me to\nspeak and to mention this fact in most of my speeches, that there were people who\nwere righteous, that there were people who cared, in spite of everything. It was\ntremendous impact. I always mention this.",
        "Q: Excuse me. Let\u2019s talk about your work then. When did you begin -- when did you\nbegin to speak out publicly in a more cons -- sort of in a more concentrated fashion?",
        "A: Well, I became -- I became more reassured in my English, and I -- and my\ndaughter also said that I have something that I should share with people, that a --\nmaybe -- she calls this a gift, that I am able to communicate and impart of myself,\nand -- and present in such a way that it will be not offending to some people, but\nrather, instructional. And I try to do my very best to -- to fulfill this. I go -- I used to\ngo to every place that ask me, anybody who was willing to listen, to schools, and\nchurches, and public -- not really public, but groups of people that wanted to hear me,\nand I was very happy. And when I started to see the results and the letters that I was\ngetting, this became the impetus even more so, that I was able to reach some of them.",
        "Q: What -- what did people say? Say a little bit more about what kind of different\ngroups you went to, and what -- what were some of the responses that you got.",
        "A: Well, as an example, I can give you for instance the Navy intelligence unit. This\nunit is comprised of very young people. And I always tell it -- I have to repeat myself\nthat if they\u2019re in intelligence unit, they must be fairly intelligent. I have to say this\nbecause -- but they are also, at the same time, are very gung-ho, very -- how did you\nlet yourself to -- to go this way, and to be done to you. They cannot perceive that the\ncircumstances under which we were, were so outrageous, we were not only\npersecuted and beaten and starved by the Germans, but the Polish population was sort\nof enjoying it. Helping, and not helping us. We tried to -- to -- if we could get a gun\nsmuggled to ghetto. Me -- I understood first in Yad Vashem that there were some\nPolish people who did help, but up til that moment, I did not know it. There\u2019s a\nwhole wall of people names that did help, and I was in a shock, because I didn\u2019t\nknow that. My love was concentrated on the country of Denmark because what --\nwhat they did, as a country, as a country. They saved about 95 percent of their Jewish\npopulation. And I -- each time -- in San Diego there 1s a little place in a Balboa park\nthat has that little -- a Danish place, and German place, and Polish place with the\nflag. On Sunday they\u2019re open. Whenever I walk to the little Danish place, and there 1s\na book that you write, I say thank you, Denmark. They don\u2019t know why and who and\nwhat, but it makes me feel good.",
        "Q: So you are trying to communicate to these little macho young people that --",
        "A: I try to communicate and you have no idea what a tremendous response I\u2019ve got.\nNow this was, I would say from the entire group, there was one Jewish woman\nlieutenant, and one half-Jewish. That\u2019s it. They were magnificent, all of them. They\nlisten intently, they made sort of mental notes. They ask question after my\npresentation. They listen to my explanation. I told them, yes, it\u2019s easy to say, but the\ncircumstances were such, we were completely helpless. I said, do you know how\nmany people committed suicide because they couldn\u2019t do anything? The world didn\u2019t\nlisten. They -- there was a Polish representative who -- who reached United States,\nJan Karski, he tried to tell them. They didn\u2019t want to listen, they didn\u2019t want to\nbelieve. So we were -- if the war would have been cut by a year, they could save God\nknows how many people. They never bombed the trucks that were leading to\nAuschwitz. So --",
        "Q: Did you tell them about s-small acts of resistance, as -- such as your -- your own?",
        "A: I did -- my -- absolutely. This -- this was a hit, because this sabotage, in their eyes,\nwas a tremendous act of courage, which it was, because we risked death at every\nmoment. But at that point we didn\u2019t care anyway, because we thought we will die\nanyway.",
        "Q: This is a story, just for our listeners, a story that Blanka has told in the videotaped\ninterview, when she was working in an aircraft factory, when she committed acts of\nsabotage, really.",
        "A: Ye-Yes. While -- excuse me, while I was riveting -- joining parts of the wings of\nthe p -- airplanes, I noticed a small notation in a Russian script, done by the Russian\nprisoners of war who worked at night shift, 1-1instructing us what to do and how to\nsabotage. When we joined the two parts, to leave a little bit opening at every third or\nfourth rivet, hoping that the force of air will force this rivet out. And this was\ntremendous, tremendous thing [indecipherable] us, and -- for us, and the -- the young\nintelligence officers were absolutely s -- mesmerized by this story.",
        "Q: Yeah, we should -- unfortunately we should stop here. And this is the end of tape\ntwo, side B, interview with Blanka Rothschild.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Blanka Rothschild. This is tape number three, side A. So, I just wanted to\nfollow-up a little bit on the response from the Naval intelligence unit. Just maybe\nelaborate a little bit more on what they said, and -- and --",
        "A: Well, when I spoke, it was very quiet, they were very intent on listening, they\nwere very polite. And when I finished, I\u2019ve seen few tears, I must say I did. Because\nthey were -- majority were men, but there a couple of women lieutenants, too. And\nthen there was a question answer period, and the qu -- two questions which very\nfrequently come up were asked there as well. And one of them was how did we\npermit this to happen to us. And of course, the answer is very incomprehensible to\nthem, but I try my very best to tell them that the circumstances under which we were\nkept completely prevented us from doing anything. There were a couple of revolts in\nsome camps, I believe, small, that the people were able to get some guns, some\nammunition, and even the Warsaw ghetto had revolt. But in Lodz ghetto, for\ninstance, where I was, it was impossible. We were surrounded by very anti-Semitic\npopulation. We could not get any gun for the life of it. We were -- as a matter of fact,\nthe people were rejoicing seeing our terrible situation. So -- and we were starved.\nNow, if you are starved, you don\u2019t have strength to pick up anything, how can you\nfight? That\u2019s why people were committing suicides, a lot of them. Besides the spirit\nwas completely broken when you saw members of your family and children being\ntaken away, and knew -- by that time you already knew that they were going to\nplaces where they were disposed of like a -- like a vermin. The second question that\nvery often I am asked 1s if I can forgive. I believe that I even spoke about it on my\nvideotape, and this question has two prongs. The people who committed these\nhorrible acts, and destroyed human beings, murder human beings, no I cannot forgive\nthem, and I never will. But the other people, the other German people, who did not\nparticipate, who were born after the war, who help, like Jehovah Witnesses, there is\nnothing to forgive. They did not do anything wrong. So as I said, there are two parts\nof this question.",
        "Q: When you go to -- you go to other place, to schools for instance, what -- ho-how\ndo you sort of experience a response there?",
        "A: Well, when I go to schools, I try to tailor myself to the audience that I\u2019m speaking\nto. If 1 am in a class of let\u2019s say, junior high students, who are young children, I\nalways tell them to close their eyes in the beginning of my presentation, because\nwhat they see in front of them is an elderly lady who has some problems walking,\nand they cannot relate too much to her. So when I ask them to close their eyes and try\nfor a moment to visualize me as they are now, a-as I once was. I was a young girl,\nand I had shared the same interests as they do now. I was thinking of my friends, and\nI was thinking of boys, and of secrets. So I was young, and I was fairly good looking,\nand I didn\u2019t have any other worries as -- if I g-got enough weekly allowance to buy\nmyself something. But of course, now I\u2019m older. So I -- I try to sort of bring them a\nlittle bit up to my level, and lower myself to their level and I go from there. So when\nI speak about us as young girls in ghetto, they try to -- try to bring this to the previous\nsaying, that oh yes, I was once young, and how did I got into the situation? They\nlisten intently, and they ask question afterwards, and they write me letters. I\u2019m a\nrecipient of many, many hu-hundreds of letters, some of them which I sent to the\narchives, to the museum.",
        "Q: In the end of this interview, maybe you can read a few excerpts from such letters.\nI have some, yeah -- not -- not right now, maybe.",
        "A: All right.",
        "Q: But -- but later on, so --",
        "A: All right. There is a Catholic school here in San Diego, Saint Madeline\u2019s, and I\nspoke. I was invited there three times already, to different classes. And I said to the\nteacher, but I\u2019m repeating myself. She said, but what you think the teachers do every\nyear, they repeat themselves. And it\u2019s a different class. As a matter of fact, some lay-\nsisters came from other classes, were standing at the door to listen, and -- and the\nreceptionist always [indecipherable] they -- they -- they ask questions, they bright,\nthey have -- they show that they have good schooling, and this is very rewarding to\nme, because if I can reach couple of them, then th -- I accomplished something.",
        "Q: Do you think the impact, or the impression of a survivor in -- 1n person, talking\nabout it, is a different one than reading it from -- 1-1n books or seeing films?",
        "A: Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely. And this is why I drive myself even though\nphysically it\u2019s getting exceedingly diffing -- difficult for me to do so, because I am\ndisabled. But I -- I -- I still try and -- when I tell them that they will be able in the\nfuture to say to some -- maybe their own children, I heard the story from the mouth\nof actual survivor, not from a book. And there is an impact there. And the children,\nespecially the -- the brighter ones, they do respond to it. They react. And that makes\nme happy.",
        "Q: Can you think of an example?",
        "A: Yes, I can think of the example of -- which is the letter that --",
        "Q: Yeah [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- from the high school.",
        "Q: I -- I looked for the --",
        "A: And th-this was a girl in high school, 1n a very affluent part of San Diego, who has\nwritten me.",
        "Q: Which one is it, this one?",
        "A: Yes. And my --",
        "Q: Oh, your glasses?",
        "A: I had them --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] they\u2019re just looking for -- over there.",
        "A: Yes. The girl who has written me, and I thought that was very significant. As a\nmatter of fact I sent a copy of it to Dr. Ringleheim in the museum. \u201cDear Mrs.\nRothschild. Thank you for coming to our school and telling us about the way it was\nfor you in the World War II. It meant a lot to me. My views on white supremacy and\nhating people of other ethnic backgrounds were changed. Your presentation helped\nme realize a lot of things that I never even thought of. I felt terrible to think my\nboyfriend of a year and a half, worshipped the man, the same kind of a man that\nbroke your back, or hit your grandmother. I\u2019m very sorry for many things I have said\nand done. I feel ashamed, ashamed for the SS tattooed on my hand. There are a lot of\nyoung people such as me who never even stopped to think of the real terrors. I know\nyou made a great impression on my mind, and I had stopped to think of the things\nthat I have said and done. Sincerely, C. Hale.\u201d Now, the letter is grammatically very\npoorly written, especially for a high school student in an affluent area. However, I\nmade a dent in her way of thinking. I made her think, and that is extremely important\nto me. She thought well enough of it to sit down and write to me. That means that she\n-- she some -- some sort of changed occurred in her. Now, even s -- even small\nchange. If she asks me to please continue speaking to people like her, that means that\nI have done some good.",
        "Q: You have spoken now for about 30 years?",
        "A: About, just about.",
        "Q: About [inaudible]",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What is the price that you pay for that role?",
        "A: The price that I pay is my health. It is getting extremely difficult for me,\nespecially when I have to travel. But I do not want to s-s -- keep that occasion. If I\u2019m\ninvited -- for instance, I was invited to Duke University twice already. And I went the\nfirst time a-absolutely on my cost, because I do not charge for my speaking, I feel\nthis is my obligation, my obligation to -- to those who cannot speak for themselves.\nThe second time I was invited, and I was -- I was provided with a fare and a hotel,\nwhich helped. But of course, nothing for the speaking. And I received a booklet,\nbeautifully done, because I spoke for two days. The first day it was in a large\nauditorium which was filled to capacity. Besides the students, there was also some\ncontingent of faculty and ministers, couple ministers. And the kids who came little\nbit late, were sitting on the aisles, on the floor, because all the seats were taken. And\nthe second day I spoke in a classroom. This 1s a special course on Holocaust at Duke\nInstitute at this year. And the teacher of the course, Miss [indecipherable] who is\nPolish, was kind enough to send me a booklet comprised of the letters, he-headed by\nher own letter, and in which she said that she gave the students a task of instead of a\nfinal, to write a letter responding to Mrs. Rothschild. And I have the letters, and this\njust very special to me, and a copy of it I send -- she sent me two copies, and the\nsecond copy I sent to Dr. Ringleheim at the museum.",
        "Q: Yeah, at the end of this interview we will read a -- a few excerpts from -- from\nthat booklet. But let me ask you also, when I ask you about the price, does it get\neasier to speak about it as the years go on, or do you still have a -- bad nights before\nor after, and bad dreams?",
        "A: I -- Lusually have, no matter how many years I will speak, there is apprehension\nbefore I go, because I don\u2019t know what kind of audience or reception I will receive,\nand there is sleeplessness that is usually associated with it, and it -- it bothers me a\ngreat deal. And then after I speak, and I come home, even though it was very good\nreception, I always have some thoughts that I omitted something important, that I\nshould have said this or that, and that was of major importance. But there is a sense\nof accomplishment.",
        "Q: Have you ever mistrusted your memory?",
        "A: I made couple of mistakes, even on my video. I tried to -- to tell Dr. Joan at the\nvery end, when I speak of my liberation, on the interviewer asked me the day I was\nliberated, I said, April 26, 1944, and it was 1945. That\u2019s one thing. And another one\nwas oh -- of -- I get mixed up with my mother. I -- I just cannot say the right --\nmaybe this is this -- the terrible pain that I have in my heart. And also, once I made a\nmistake on --in my speaking, when I talked about Bittenberg, which 1s the city that I\nslaved in Arado airplane factory, and I said that the city had the church on which\ndoor the Martin Luther affixed the 1905 thesis. And in one speech I said Martin\nLuther King. And they couldn\u2019t take that King out, because it was too late.",
        "Q: Well, we have corrected it here. Do you do anything to -- just to -- to ha -- to\nstimulate your memory? Is it -- 1s 1t fading, or is it still very strong, except for now\nand then?",
        "A: A cert -- no, certain things are very deeply engraved on my memory, that I will\nalways repeat it, and they stay with me. But many things slowly start fading away.\nAnd that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that I did speak for all these years. Yes, some things\nI -- as I said previously, I try to erase from my memory, like the faces of my\ntormentors. But some -- dates, for instance, I don\u2019t remember. And I don\u2019t remember\nwhat I wore when I left that camp. I called my friend in New York who was also in a\ncamp, she\u2019s, don\u2019t you remember? I said no. Then I -- I ask somebody about\nsomething and she said, Blanka, but I was with you. And I didn\u2019t remember that. So\nthe age takes over. That\u2019s why I\u2019m speeding with my speaking.",
        "Q: Did you ever go back to Germany, to Poland?",
        "A: I was in Poland only after I was liberated, and once I left after the bad reception, I\ndecided never, ever to come back to Poland. I was back in Germany couple of times,\nbecause the German government recognized that they did impair my health quite\nbadly. They crippled me, and the condition is worsening with age, so a couple of\ntimes I was granted a so-called cour. I was in a resort that the doctor treated me, and I\nreceived treatments, however what they gave me was not sufficient to cover all the\nexpenses like flight and the hotel, so I had to stop going to Germany for that reason.\nThe treatments were wonderful, much superior to the ones that I\u2019m getting here. I\u2019m\ngoing now to, so far, couple of times to Canestoga spa, which has some bath, and\nthey are not quite the same quality and value. But it does help me, so I do go there.",
        "Q: You never received compensation for slave labor?",
        "A: Not so far, I -- I\u2019m receiving a gesundheitshan. I\u2019m receiving a m-monthly rent for\nmy broken health, but now there 1s a class action for the slave labor and I filled the\npapers, and I hope that I will be able to -- after all, I worked in Lodz ghetto for a few\nyears, in a -- 1s -- not factory, but this was establishment. I was working making\nsweaters for Germans, they needed for the winters. And then we were working on\nsome cement place, making blocks for the buildings that were being destroyed. And\nof course in the airplane factory until the liberation in the camp.",
        "Q: When you went back to Germany, what was your impression then of the country\nof the Germans? Was there something that stays with you? Conversations you have\nhad, things you have seen?",
        "A: Well, when I went there, I used to go to the spa. In the spa there were many\npeople who were coming for their vacation, and they were at the -- their very best, at\nleisure. And if they ever ask me anything -- not a person that I met knew about\nanything, so they were quite innocent. They did not know about the atrocities, they\ndid not hear about the camps. Anyway, the people that I met never, with the\nexception of the old lady in Berlin after the war, who admitted that she was Nazi and\nso were all her friends, the doctor and the personnel in the spa were very nice. After\nall, they were being paid for it, and the people that I met there were friendly with me,\nbut then I met couple of Dutch people there who come in for the same treatment. And\nthere were a couple of people even from Israel that I met there, and the local\npopulation I -- I -- I made friends with a man who made me brace, because I have to\nwear back brace, I just put it on. And in the beginning he -- his reaction was not too\nfriendly, but after awhile when he got to know me, he became very friendly. He and\nhis wife visited us in United States. He made me brace, for which he was paid by the\nGerman government, and he made me a brace as a gift.",
        "Q: Do you think his original unfriendliness had -- he was just a grumpy person, or\ndid it have something to do with who you were? Not you as a person, but that you\nwere Jewish?",
        "A: I really couldn\u2019t put my finger on it. He was not too intelligent man, but he was a\nvery good businessman. So he knew how to -- how to work for the government\nbecause he was doing this type of work for war amputees and -- and the braces, not\ntoo many people nowadays know this. There\u2019s no industry for making this type of\nbraces, so he was just about one of very few in all of Germany, and he cashed on it.\nIn the beginning why he wasn\u2019t too friendly, well I was somebody strange, and\nmaybe he thought that I resented him. I had to go to him from Bad Kissingen to\nSchweinhold on train, but the next time when he saw me and he -- he met me, and he\nsort of liked me, he came with his car to pick me up, and spare me the ride on a train.",
        "Q: Nice. Did you have any anti -- did you hear any anti-Semitic remarks anywhere?",
        "A: Well, wa -- once. People were careful with me when they knew that I was Jewish,\nbut once I had an incident because the couple did not know I was Jewish. And that\nwas in a caf\u00e9 and we were sitting at the same table, and they admired me, I\u2019m -- to\nthem I was somebody from America. And they said, how do you like Germany\u2019? And\nI said it\u2019s very nice. And they said, well it\u2019s very nice, but too many Jewish people\nare coming back. And at that point I excused them from my table. At the same token\nI spoke -- my husband was with me the last time -- couple of times because I needed\nescort, I couldn\u2019t travel by myself. My husband and I were sitting 1n the park,\nspeaking of course, English. And an elderly gentleman with wife were sitting nearby\nand start the conversation with us in German. And he became a friend. He was there\nfor his health. And we went to the caf\u00e9s together, and he was a very charming man,\nand he -- when we left for the States, they brought us very nice gift. And we\nexchanged Christmas greetings.",
        "Q: You also told me, and not on the tape yet, but I would like you to talk about it,\nthat you had invited younger German people to your home in New York. Maybe you\ncould say something about that. When --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- when was that, and what --",
        "A: When I lived in New York City, prior to being on the west coast, we lived for 20\nyears in the city, we -- I contacted the -- The Quaker Society, American Friend\nSociety, and I ask them to send a couple of students for a holiday for a dinner,\nbecause I wanted people from different countries to learn about us, and I thought that\none on one, it\u2019s the best way to learn about people. And one day the lady from The\nFriend Society called me and asked me if I would mind if she would send a German\ngirl. And I said, by all means send her to me, let her see me as I am. And she and a\nDutch girl came together to our house. She was in the beginning very shy, and very\nsort of frightened. But as the things progressed, and the dinner, we became quite\nfriendly, and she left as a friend, and that was an accomplishment. Yes, I think that\nthe young people should try to reach and meet, maybe some survivors, or people who\n-- whose family suffered to -- to form a common bond. It\u2019s very important when\npeople try to understand each other. After all, we are all individuals, we are all\ndifferent. We have different points of view, religions, cultural background, but we are\nall human beings, so if we try to overcome our prejudices, and reach a hand and\nlisten, then the world would be much better, much better off.",
        "Q: Do you still have hope?",
        "A: Ah, that\u2019s such a tricky s -- question.",
        "Q: Honestly now.",
        "A: Honestly I -- I am -- I am at times pessimistic, because I don\u2019t see much progress\nin many parts of the world. I\u2019m afraid that the human race did not learn the powerful\nlessons that Holocaust and the previous genocides provided. They are still going on\naround the globe. And it\u2019s not only Yugoslavia, but it\u2019s in Rwanda, it\u2019s in Sri Lanka,\nit\u2019s in yugo -- it\u2019s in Ireland. Bo-Both people are Christian, only different\ndenomination and they hate one another. I -- this is the greatest divisor of people,\nreligion. And if people would really, truly were religious in their hearts, they would\nfind a way to -- to find this common bond, and the link. But truthfully, when I see the\nsituation in Kosovo and Yugoslavia, I -- I am not too optimistic, sadly.",

        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Blanka Rothschild. This is tape number three, side B. So after the sort of\nskeptical statement that you have just made, maybe we can continue with some hope\nafterwards, because we are looking at a booklet now. Maybe you should say\nsomething about that --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- and then we\u2019ll read a few ex-excerpts.",
        "A: Yes, on -- my last speaking enda -- engagement was at Duke University, and I\nspoke twice, one day to the third auditorium of student and some faculty and\nministers, and the next day I spoke before a class which was instituted this year,\nspecifically on Holocaust. The class is small si -- consisting of a teacher and 16\nstudents, and this teacher was kind enough to send me a lovely, bound booklet with\nsome of the -- with the letters. And she said she had high expectation for the class\nand student, and she worried, but eventually the class -- she was afraid that the class\nbecome desensitized by the narratives of horror. But eventually she saw the\ntransformation of students to deeper understanding. And she said, \u201cThis is the\nmoment that all teachers dream of, and I knew that the class had been successful. It\nwas your visit and your important message that coincided with this success. The\nstudent had already begun to bring the Holocaust, the human capacity for genocide,\nand the responsibility of the bystander into discussion about current social injustices\naround the world. They had started to question their own complicity. They asked\nwhat they could do for Kosovo, for Rwanda, for East Timor, for those suffering on\nour own soil, and it was your talk, your willingness to speak of your losses and to\ntestify for those who are forever silent. Your dedication to social action that solidified\nthis response from the students. It was invaluable for all students, ranging from those\nwho had never studied the Holocaust to your own granddaughter, to hear a survivor\nbear witness. All of the students posted lengthy notes about your visit on our email\nnews -- newsgroup.\u201d And I will read a couple of excerpts.",
        "Q: Yeah ga -- about five or so, because they are really important, I think.",
        "A: Yes, by the way, they -- they endeared themselves to me because they all called\nme Nana, as my granddaughter does, who is part of this class. \u201cDear Nana, some\npeople come into our lives and quickly live -- leave. Some stay for awhile, leave\nfootprints on our hearts, and we are never, ever the same.\u201d This is how she started her\nresponse.

I just want to finish by saying that I admire Alexis\u2019s\ngrandmother so much for not only coming to talk to us, but for just volunteering to\ntalk to anyone who is willing to listen.

        "A: This letter Pll -- Il read an excerpt from, 1s from a girl from a -- Kosovo. Dear\nNana, I\u2019m writing this letter to thank you for coming to Duke on Wednesday. I --\nalthough I was unable to attend your formal talk, I enjoyed hearing your stories from\nan intimate perspective. They\u2019re extremely vivid accounts of your experiences in the\nconcentration camp, and encouraged me to think more about the situation in regards\nto my relatives in Kosovo. I am sure that those who have heard you speak will agree\nthat you have made a tremendous impact on their lives. I will never forget being\nmoved to tears by your words and emotion. I find it extremely fortunate that I was\nable to hear your experiences. Again, I thank you so much for coming. Until then, to\nyour health and happiness. Melina.\u201d And this is from my granddaughter. \u201cDear Nana,\nthank you for doing something for me that forever will be part of my memories at\nDuke. Your speech was wonderful and inspirational as us -- always. The presence\nthat you have while speaking to o -- strangers, bearing your soul and revealing some\nof your most painful experiences, astounds me. As I have said before, your family\ncan rest in peace knowing that you told and continue to tell their story. You are -- you\nhave touched many lives with your testimony, but you have touched me because of\nthe person you ca -- became -- become after the war. Your generosity, love and\nstrength are your greatest assets and you have taught me well, as I now enter my\nsenior year of Duke and begin to look for the road I will travel next, I will keep all\nthat you have told me in my heart. Thank you again for coming to Duke and for\nsharing yourself so unselfishly. I love you. Always, Alexis.\u201d",
        "Q: How does that make you feel when you read that?",
        "A: Wonderful. Wonderful. Th-There\u2019s so many of them here, it\u2019s -- well, but Joan\nhas it.",
        "Q: Yeah. So you -- our listeners who would like to read more of those can find it at\nthe Holocaust Museum.",
        "A: Yes, the booklet 1s -- I -- the teacher was thoughtful enough to send me two\ncopies, one for me and one for the museum specifically, and I forwarded it to Dr.\nronga -- Ringelheim.",
        "Q: Well, since we are with the museum, let me follow up with a question about the\nmuseum. How do you -- how do you see the role of the Holocaust Museum in -- in\nWashington, D.C.? How do you feel about what -- what they are doing, or what they\nhave done already\u201d",
        "A: Well, I express myself, I feel very eloquently about it on my video. I -- I was\nabsolutely delighted with the creation of this museum, because it is a tremendous\ntool, not only of showing people what has happened, but as a tool for educating\npeople for the future, how to learn to get along. How to -- how to see things from the\nperspective of different human beings, people who went through it, people who did\nhelp, people who taught about it. The museum has testimonies of so many survivors,\nand they range from people who can hardly express themselves to people who are\nvery articulate and who can just bare their soul, and try to teach the listeners, and\nopen their eyes and ears and teach them the lessons.",
        "Q: I\u2019ve heard some survivors be quite critical, though, of the fact that this is not a\nmuseum solely dedicated to Jewish survivors. Ho-How do you feel about that?",
        "A: No, I disagree strongly. I disagree because then it would defeat the purpose. If it\nwould be only to perpetuate the Jewish Holocaust, it would be very parochial. I think\nthat the museum is a warning and teaching experience for people of all persuasions\nall around the world, of all the people who can have the access to the museum. It is a\nmorally and ethically marvelous tool, because it exposes people to -- not only to the\nevil, but also to the goodness. It exposes people to the teaching of the survivors like\nmyself, what did they learn, and what did they want to tell the future generations?\nBecause we as survivors are getting old, and we are dying out, and we will be the last\nones who will be heard from.",
        "Q: Do you think there can ever be too much education about the Holocaust? Because\nsome people are also a little fearful that too much quote, fixation on the Holocaust\ntakes away from more -- fr-from other aspects of Jewish culture.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I disagree. This is my point of view. You can never take away\nfrom the culture by teaching people how to get along with other people. It is this --\nmy individual understanding, and I hope by -- that people who will listen to me will\nagree with me, that the museum, it was created for the purpose of teaching people to\navoid in the future, genocides not only of Jewish people, but all the people\neverywhere on this earth. Unfortunately, we have the bad examples occurring now\nthroughout the world. And this museum teaches people how to -- how to understand\nthis, and how to avoid. How can the museum be a -- a -- 0-only preaching about the\nJewish genocide? There\u2019s genocide now going on.",
        "Q: D-Do you feel that there was a certain point in American history when people\nwere beginning to be more interested and more knowledgeable about the Holocaust\nin -- in -- as -- aS a Whole? Was -- do you think there was a certain turning point, or --\nyeah, well, that\u2019s the first point of my question.",
        "A: I think that many of the survivors who became successful 1n their private lives\nwere very instrumental in pushing the idea of creating this museum, and they were\nable to support it financially. And ever since that time -- there are other museums in\ndifferent countries that are being spurred by the idea of the -- of the Washington\nHolocaust Museum.",
        "Q: And how do you feel about sort of popular films and -- and sort of popular culture\nto -- representing the Holocaust?",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m not too fond of them because they could never really portray the true\nHolocaust. The movie \u201cHolocaust\u201d that was in three or four parts, was a -- a -- a fairy\ntale, absolutely pointless. On the other hand, \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d was a teaching tool. I\nfeel that Schindler deserved to be mentioned because no matter what his motives in\nthe beginning were -- he was a businessman who wanted to cash in on, and make\nmoney. However, eventually, by seeing the injustice and the h-horror of the German\nauthorities, he changed his mind and he became instrumental in saving people. So\nthis fi-film I believe it -- 1t was worthwhile.",
        "Q: Do you -- are you a part of a s-survivor group, or do you -- do you socialize with\nsurvivors?",
        "A: Not really, because where I lived, I -- I have my few friends here who happen to\nbe just American born friends, and not necessarily Jewish. I -- we have a writing\nclass, we have a reading club, and I also play Bridge. I do not belong to the group\nwhich is very active in our city, of -- there is no -- no reason really, I just can\u2019t travel\nthem and I -- I stay in touch with people who help me because I can\u2019t drive, they pick\nme up and take me with them.",
        "Q: Is there anything that you would like to say to end this interview? I have asked\nyou what I wanted you to ask -- what I wanted to ask you and --",
        "A: As usual, my ending would be first thanking the interviewer for taking the time,\nand being very kind, and asking me all the questions and traveling here in the very\nhot day. And my philosophy is always the same, I try to persuade people to open\ntheir hearts, and open their ears, and thinking of -- that we are here on this earth, put\non temporarily, and we should make the best of the time that is allotted to us. Why do\nwe have to fight? What divides us? We all are of human race, no matter what color,\nwhat religious persuasion. We should concentrate on doing the very best to get along\nand to -- to divert our energy and resources to help eradicate the [indecipherable] that\nwe have spread around the world.",
        "Q: Unfortunately, I have just thought of one more question, and that\u2019s the very last --",
        "A: That\u2019s ok -- that\u2019s all right.",
        "Q: -- I promise. When you think back about the last 55 years, that\u2019s a long time, it\u2019s\nfive and a half decades, is there something that you can say about that second life, if\nyou will, that you have lived -- and are still living, of course.",
        "A: Well -- well, my life as I would have thought when I was young and hope for the\nfuture, it\u2019s very different from the one I pictured for myself. For one thing I thought\nthat I will go on with my education to -- to the -- to the nth degree because school\nwas always my -- my favorite. And my health problems prevented me from it.\nHowever, I taught myself English well enough to be able to speak about it. And I --\nand I educated my daughter in the manner that I wanted to be educated myself. And\nthe next generation, my granddaughter as well. So these 50 years, I am proud of what\nI did in my small measure, to -- to help. And I can see that the help is in the form of\nthe letters that I receive from people who listen to me, and in the next generation, my\ndaughter and my granddaughter, who are perpetuating my dream of good life and\neducation and -- and being close to the family.",

        "Answer: My full name is Blanka Irma Rothschild. I was born in Poland, in Lodz, and\n-- August 19\", 1922.",
        "A: Yes, Just prior to the liberation I was 1n so-called [indecipherable] which means in\nEnglish, a sick bay. I was lying there with some broken ribs, which I received on the\nlast beating that I got at the hands of the meister, the supervisor from the airplane\nfactory in which I w -- slaved. And at that time the allied forces were closing on the -\n- around our city, Bittenberg. We were not really sure who were they, but we were --\nwe were subjected to bombardments and the Germans closed us in the barrack, and\nthe -- the doors were locked and the windows were covered, and we were not let out\nto work, and as well with the sick bay. Since this came so rapidly, they did not have\ntime to dispose of us, because the plan was to somehow eradicated the camp with the\ninmates. I was brought from the sick bay to the main barrack when they closed it.\nAnd the following day, or two days later, one of the girls looked through the window,\nthe -- the shutter, and she have seen that the towers where the German soldiers were\nusually with -- watching us, ar -- they were absent, nobody was there. So they\ndecided to break the door open and run. And the ones who could, ran to the kitchen.\nThey brought us some very silly foods, margarine, one egg, I think, a couple of\npotatoes and we stayed for awhile there. We had very mixed emotions because we\ndidn\u2019t know what to do. However, we decided that the safest thing for us would be to\nleave the camp, since it was abandoned by the Germans. This was the supposedly\nmoment of the liberation, and we didn\u2019t feel liberated yet. It was very strange feeling.\nWe went across the street, my friends helped me.",
        "A: Iam -- I -- I walked, because I -- the human need to survive is so great that you\nsummon all your energy to -- to survive. So I lived with this pain, and they helped\nme. And they -- as a matter of fact they say, Blanka, another day, another day and we\nwill be free. And we crossed the street. There was the house in which the\ncommandant lived from the camp, with a garden, lovely flowers which I envied when\nI passed by and saw it. We went inside, it was abandoned as well. And there were, I\nthink, seven of us, and one girl has -- had a mother with her yet. And they brought\nthe food, and somebody was preparing the food, and all of a sudden the commandant\ncame back with a gun, cocked the gun, aimed at the group of us and of course we\nwere petrified, we thought that\u2019s the end. And this big, strong man with the gun was\nafraid of us. And he backed out and disappeared. At that moment we thought the\nsafest thing would be to leave his house and go towards the fire, because this\nindicated that whoever is fighting, is a liberator.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what happened, but we split. I was in a group of five. Two of the\ngirls were helping me, and the five of us were running. We passed a field, 1t was\nstreet or a field, there were two young men there, and they joined us. These were two\nPolish men who worked there during the war as hands at the farms because Germany\nneeded laborers, and they joined us. Since we were from Poland, we spoke Polish, so\nthe seven of us reached the front line. Unbelievable, unbelievable sight. The first\nsoldiers that we -- soldier that we saw was of Asiatic origin, I believe, some Mongol\nmaybe, with the eyes that make seem that he\u2019s Asiatic. And he was with the dirty\nuniform, filthy. And we kissed his boots. I remember that moment. And he motioned\nwith his hands for us to go in the back. We went in the back, they told us that we can\nhelp ourselves to food, which was in a barrel, there were herrings. We ate some of\nthe herrings, we got very sick from it because the bodies were empty -- the stomachs,\nrather, were empty. And there was no water because the pipes weren\u2019t working. So --\nbut we were pretty sick, in pretty bad shape.",
        "A: Long herrings, long herrings. And then they -- they told us to leave. This was the\nfront line after all, they were being shot and they shot back. So we reached a house --\nthis was a village, finally, and we reached the very first house, which had a slightly\ndamaged roof, I believe, and we went in. And it -- since the fighting go -- was going\non, we decided to go to the basement. They had the basement, which was very, very\nwell appointed. They had two sort of cots to sleep, with -- with linen on them, and\nthey were -- the walls were lined with shelves, and the shelves had all sorts of jars\nwith conserves and meat and -- and fruit. And in the other part of the basement there\nwere barrels. They were potatoes, carrots, and water. So, ever -- and -- and there were\nsome candles. So they were really very well prepared. And of course we ate some of\nthe stuff, and we lied down. And that basement was approachable by a swing door up\nand down, that\u2019s all I remember, up and down. And at some point during the night,\nthe door swang open and two Russians came, and they demanded girls. I believe that\nat least one of them was drunk, because he pulled up his gun and started to shoot at\nthe jars. Now, I said to myself, when I survived the five years, or over five years of\nwar, and I\u2019m still alive, I\u2019m not going to be subjected to that, I\u2019d rather die. So I ask\none of the Polish boys to save me, and I said to him, look, tell them that I\u2019m --\npretend I\u2019m your wife. I was lying on this cot, and he covered me, and he sat down\non top of me. And the other girl did the same, and one went in the back room where\nthe barrels were, and two girls were raped. Now the -- the Russian who was shooting\nat the jars, was laughing like a child. To him this was absolutely normal. Women and\nmen were made to -- to mate. So there was nothing strange to him. He couldn\u2019t\nunderstand that -- that we hated it, that we couldn't understand it. I remember that the\npieces of the broken jars, the glass, embedded in my left leg, and I still have the\nscars. And I didn\u2019t make a peep, not a sound, because I wanted to survive, so I was\nquiet. One of the girls became hysterical; her name was Blanka, I remember her, she\nwas the youngest. She became hysterical and she started to scream, so the Russian\ntook a candle, put the light on -- lit the candle and brought her some water. And he\nput the compress, cold compress on her forehead, he said, okay. When the morning\nfinally arrived --",
        "A: Yes --",
        "A: I he -- he raped -- one girl was raped on the floor, her name was Anya, she went to\nIsrael, I don\u2019t know too much about her now, and the other one was lying on the\nother cot, and it was dark, but we heard the sounds. And she was quiet. She was\nraped. She came from a very religious family, Jewish religious family, so in the\nmorning she did not tell us that she was raped, but we knew she was raped, because\nyou -- you could hear the sounds. Extraordinary. The next morning we decided to\nleave this place for something safer, and we walked through the village, found\nanother house. They were -- all the houses were abandoned by the Germans who\nwere running towards the American line, or English line. They did not want to be\ncaptured by the Russians. And the cows and the pigs were not fed so they were\nmaking sounds. We got into a house, we made ourselves comfortable, we ate. The\ntwo boys went to the garden and they chased some chickens, we cooked the chickens.\nAfter we finished eating we took the tablecloth with the china and threw it out of the\nwindow. That was -- this was the little revenge. We didn\u2019t want to wash the dishes,\nwe didn\u2019t know what will happen. It didn\u2019t feel like we are liberated. There was not\nthe sense of freedom yet. Oh, first of all, the war was still going on. We were so-\ncalled liberated by the Russians, who became in our eyes, another oppressors. So I\nquestioned myself, is -- was this worth it, all my suffering, to arrive at this moment?\nWhat\u2019s going to be? What will happen later on? And there was a story about -- I\nbelieve that I had on media tape, that we were so scared of the Russians that at night\nwe took a ladder and we went to the attic, and we slept in the attic, four of us. The\ntwo boys slept downstairs and one of the five girls, her name was Sarka, she found\nherself a r -- a Russian officer. She was a very enterprising young lady. The four of\nus were scared, four poor souls, so the four of us were upstairs, upstairs there was a\nbed, big, big bed, and the boys pulled the ladder down and we stayed up there at\nnight. And the same night, we have heard German voices, and we thought that the\nGermans came back. The Polish boys jumped out of the window. The house faced a\nsmall forest, a young forest, and evidently some of the soldiers who ran away, they\nwere hiding. They were hungry, so they broke to this kitchen to eat. So the Polish\nboys jumped from the window because they were downstairs, and they ran to the\nRussian commandantura to tell them that the ru -- there are Germans in the house.\nAnd we hear the Russians coming, and we understand them because the Russian and\nPolish are -- are Slavic languages, the -- the roots are sort of -- you could understand.\nThey wanted to throw --",
        "A: Hand grenades, and -- to the house. So the Polish boys said don\u2019t, don\u2019t, there are\nPolish girls upstairs. And we, all four of us, crept underneath the big bed, we\u2019re lying\nunderneath the bed, and Blanka, the youngest one who -- who -- who was hysterical\nbefore, she wet herself and we were lying down there in the urine, not even thinking\nabout it. Here we survived the Nazi camp, here we are so-called liberated, here are\nthe Germans downstairs and the Russians want to kill us. The -- the situation was\nabsolutely unbelievable. The Germans tried to escape through the kitchen door to the\n-- through the garden, and they were shot by the Russians, both of them. And the two\nbodies were for two days lying there. After that day, my fear was so intense, that I\ndid not want to stay with the girls. The next house ha-had French prison -- ex-\nprisoners of war, and I moved with them, they said they would take care of me, and\nthey did.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, the Russians gave me -- as we -- when we were there at first, when they gave\nus some food, they gave me some bandages to wrap myself, that\u2019s all. I d -- I really\ndon\u2019t know how these people fought, because they were -- they didn\u2019t change their\nuniforms, they were dirty, they had all sorts of food that was unthinkable, and they\nwere fighting. They were very strong people, the -- the -- the stock. And the\nconditions were just tragic. I stayed with the French people, who took care of me. As\na matter of fact, I have pictures. They -- they gave me some pictures. And one of\nthem wanted me to go with him to France. He said, we will -- we will cure you there.\nAnd we stayed there for quite awhile, I don\u2019t remember the dates and how long. But\nthen the war was over on May sixth. We still stayed, because we didn\u2019t know what to\ndo and where to go.",
        "A: Well, the Russians. Hitler kaput, Hitler kaput. It\u2019s over. Sarka had this Russian\nlieutenant, or I don\u2019t know what his rank was, she was very happy, and the three of\nthem with the two Polish boys were still in that house. I was with the French people.\nI was absolutely scared out of my wits.",
        "A: Yes. After I don\u2019t remember how many weeks, but few weeks, people started to\nthink of going back to their native countries. Now at that point, I did not know that\nmy family didn\u2019t survive, that not one of them survived. So I thought that my ob --\nfirst obligation was to go back to look for my family.",
        "A: Yes?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Grandmother.",
        "A: Well, my grandmother was taken away. I did not know if people who were taken\naway were all dead. We thought maybe some of them survive. And my mother was --\nyou know, when they parted us, I thought maybe she survived. So I thought that I\nhave to fulfill my -- my first obligation and go back. And there were people from\nPoland who walked with little carts and Polish flags, towards Poland. And I decided\nthat I will join them. There were carts, so I had some rides for awhile. And after\ntearful good-byes with the French people, that I will never forget, I left. And we\nwalked, and walked, and then they had the horse once. So the horse pull -- pulled the\ncart and I was in it. We reached a city called Lignitsa, which used to belong to\nGerman and became Polish, so I don\u2019t remember what the name was previous to it.\nLignitz?",
        "A: Lignitz, probably. It was not too far from Breslau, and Breslau became Brotswow.\nAnd in Brotswow people already had apartments, people who survived. Now, I was\nnever very enterprising, so I just depended on that man who was walking. And we\nstayed in Lignitz -- Lignitsa for a couple of days, then we continued, and then we had\npart of the trip was done by a train that the trucks still remained somewhere. And\neventually I reached Warsaw.",
        "A: Who needed clothes? Who thought of clothes? I had something from the German\nhouse. I -- I\u2019m sorry to -- til today that I didn\u2019t bring with me -- didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t\nthink of preserving anything from the camp, I just want to get rid of it. So I went\nthrough -- through the closets with my friends, and I remember that I wore, I think it\nwas a man\u2019s shirt, blue, long-sleeve shirt, and some sort of a skirt. Some people were\nlooking for watches, for thi -- I -- I didn\u2019t think about it. I just wanted to see my\nfamily. When we reached Warsaw, which was bombed to rubble, and they left me\nthere, I didn\u2019t know what to do, how to reach my city, Lodz. I have no money, I have\nno possessions, I -- I\u2019m -- you see me, that\u2019s how I am. And there was a truck, a\nPolish man who had a sign he\u2019s going to Lodz. So I ask him if he could take me. And\nI said I have no money. He said okay. These times were different. People had some\nsort of -- I don\u2019t know, not obligation, but they felt like helping one another, because\nthe survivors were streaming back. So this man ow -- took me to his truck, and the\nfunny part of it is that he stopped in one city and he left the truck to go to eat, and he\ndidn\u2019t think that I -- of me, that I\u2019m hungry. Which -- which was sil -- really silly.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t eat. I don\u2019t remember -- you see, certain things are faded in my memory\nbecause they are not of major importance. We eventually reached Lodz. We -- he let\nme out on a street, after all, this is my city, and Lodz was not really destroyed,\nbecause ra -- Lodz was occupied after few days. It\u2019s not too far from the German\nborder, so it was occupied pretty much untouched. Few buildings I think we lost, and\nI knew my way around. So I went to m -- he -- he dropped me off in my vicinity on\nthe -- the house that I lived in, the Dineska, 31A, still stood, very nice house, four\nstory house, a corner. And I went in and there was the superintendent who works for\nus, because the building belonged to my family. And he crossed himself when he saw\nme. His greeting to me was surprise, and why did I return, how did I survive, and\nwhy did I come back? He said, you can\u2019t go upstairs because people live there, and\nthe Germans took everything out of your place, everything. Carpets, and -- there is\nnothing left. But I said I w -- I still would like to go -- did somebody come back?\nAnybody came here? He said nobody did. But I still walked to my apartment and\nrang the bell, and they wouldn\u2019t let me in, the people who lived there. You see,\nPolish people were not really very friendly, and this is mi -- putting mildly. I went\ndownstairs and the st -- intendent -- the superintendent of the building told me that\ntwo blocks away, or three blocks away, there was a office by Jewish -- I don\u2019t know\nif this was HIAS, Jewish committee set up an office, and there were lists of people\nwho came back, or who inquired, or who survived, and that\u2019s where I went. And\nwhen I s-scanned the list, I didn\u2019t see any names from my family, any at all, but I saw\na name of my school girlfriend, and her address, which was not too far. And I went to\nher apartment. She lived with her husband, she was very happy to see me. She\nsurvived with her husband, she got married in ghetto. And when ghetto was being\nliquidated completely, after the great liquidations, there were two groups left. One\ngroup that I was with my mother in the hospital in on Wargevnitska. And the second\ngroup of 500 people, I believe, on Iyakuba in hiding. This 1s the only group that did\nnot leave fa -- Lodz, and survived in hiding because the Russians came to Poland just\nin time. We were taken at the last moment, in November.",
        "A: [indecipherable] The emptiness, and the futility of survival. The futility of the\nyears of wishing and wanting and yearning to see somebody, to -- to live again, to --\nthe life was very bleak, that I had -- my feelings were that it wasn't worth survival. I\ndidn\u2019t know why I was chosen to survive. You must know that at that time I was not\nwell, I had bandages on me, I had no money, I had no possessions. I went to my\nfriend, I had some tapes put around me. You would be surprised how you can\nsurvive, how strong we are. The circumstances are just unbelievable. M-My friend at\nthis time, with her husband, were already in a very nice apartment, and they lived\nsome sort of normalized life. He was occupied with some enterprise, earning money,\nand I didn\u2019t feel very much wanted, since I did not have any family left, and Polish\npeople did not greet me very nicely. And I remember distinctly my bitterness that my\nPolish girlfriends did not come to see me when I went to ghetto, not one of them. My\ndear friends from school, of all these years. I decided to leave Poland. We have heard\nof displaced person camps in Germany, people who survived wi -- camps. And there\nwas another girl who survived as well, and I knew her, and the two of us decided to\nleave Poland and go to the camps.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: I -- Lask myself that question many, many times, because it 1s -- 1t seems to me\nimprobable now. How did I cope with the situation? How did I survive, and why it\nwas me. It was combined with a sense of deep guilt that I was the one who survived.\nWhy I? I didn\u2019t feel worth it. There were people who were better in my family than I,\nand they didn\u2019t survive. They were younger, and some older. How did I go -- how\ndid I have this burst of energy to proceed to leave Poland, to think about it? Maybe it\nwas the -- the deep sense of bitterness towards people that I knew before the war who\nbetrayed me, because I thought this was betrayal. These were people who were\ncoming to my home, sleeping and eating, and I was helping them with work. I was\nfairly good student. And they did not know me when the war started. So leaving\nPoland was not as traumatic because there was nothing that I was leaving behind.",
        "A: That\u2019s -- th-th -- these are amazing stories. You know, my -- my -- my -- my life\nis a -- like a kaleidoscope of different moments that collectively saved me. And it --\nthey came in the -- just the right moment. When I decided to leave with my friend\nIrka, her name was Irka, and strangely enough we shared the last name. We were not\n-- we were not related, but we were both Fisher. We decided to leave Poland and my\nfriend, in whose home I was staying, said to me, you know, I'll give you a couple of\nzlotys, which was the Polish money, very little, and she gave me two bottle of vodka.\nShe said, this is a very good trading mark with the Russians, if you need it. And it\nproved to be true. We were not bothered by any luggage because we had no\npossessions, neither one of us. Can you imagine this? I still wonder about it. The two\nof us went, we reached Posen -- Posinine -- Polish Posnine, Posen in German, a\nuniversity city which was on -- near the border, and we wanted to board a train which\nwas going to Germany. Now how do you board the train when you have no money or\nanything? Just so happened on this station, there -- there were -- the whole Russian\ncontingent of soldiers were sitting around waiting for this train. And Irka and I\ndecided to find one of the Russians, maybe he\u2019s Jewish, so he would help us. So we\nsaid to -- how do you find the Jew? How does Jew look like? Wha -- wa -- how we\ncan judge? We have to -- to chance. Or maybe we\u2019|l find somebody who is decent\nenough to help us. And we still have these vodka, covered of course, because the\nRussians and vodka, it\u2019s -- we walked -- they were making remarks as we were\npassing by, and we saw one tall individual in very long coat, reaching his ankles,\nwith a very prominent nose. And we said, do you think he might be Jewish? He was\nan officer, he had some insignia. And we approached him, and we asked -- we knew\nthe few words in Russian, Ve evrai means Jew in Russian. Ve evrai, and he said da.\nOh, that was first relief. We are little Polish, little Russian, we are two girls that are\nJewish, the families were killed. We have nobody. We want to leave Poland to go to\ndisplaced person camp. He offered to help us. He took us to his compartment, took\nhis filthy coat, the dirty pea coat, put us in the corner, and covered us with this --\nhanged this on a hook and covered us with this stinky coat, and he said, don\u2019t make a\nsound. And when the train started, he gave us some bread. He was very ni -- he -- we\ngave him the vodka, we were so delighted. And he said he was a dentist, and he said\nto us, don\u2019t go east, go west. And he said if he would have his wife, which was in one\nof the Russian cities [indecipherable] he wouldn\u2019t go back either. It -- it\u2019s\nunbelievable this -- the situations that I was involved with, the people that I met, the\npeople that did help me, that -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s a story after story after\nstory. And we reached Berlin after -- after stopping th -- at the border where we\nheard screaming because some women were being raped. I suppose German woman\nwere being raped by the Russians, and we were still under that coat, and we reached\nBerlin station, we got off, we thank him. We found two men that looked to us Jewish,\nand they were, and they gave -- put us on the bus, they paid the fare, they told us\nwhen to get off. Now, both of us spoke German. We got off and that was the first\nSchlactensee camp that we k -- arrived at.",
        "A: I have no idea who was in charge, because I -- I was not too long in that place. I\ndon\u2019t want to sound snobbish, but it was difficult for me to get used to it. They did\ngive us a place to sleep and they did give us food, but we, both of us felt we would\nlike to -- and they helped us to -- to get a room by a German family, the first one,\nFrau Beans, I think, I don\u2019t remember, a war widow with a son and with her aunt.\nAnd we got a room there by her. It was not too far from Alexanderplatz in the\nRussian sector. We had some money, some ration cards. We lived like the Germans,\non a ration card at that time. It was still unbelievable that we survived to this point. I\ndid not have any joy of my freedom, because it was not the freedom that I was\nlonging for.",
        "A: My freedom would be, in my childish thinking, my freedom would be to be\nreunited with my family, and living a -- a normal life. Normal meant to me to be the\ncultural life. Something that I -- that I thirst for, I had hunger for it. That\u2019s why Irka\nand I, when we have this room, decided to go to a movie one day, because we wanted\nto start some sort of normal life. And we went to the movie, which was German\nmovie with Marie Carruk, I remember. I remember -- I don\u2019t remember the name of\nit, but I remember Marie Carruk, I don\u2019t know why. And once it was dark and the\nmovie was running, and we whispered to each other and all of a sudden we felt both\nus hands on our shoulders [indecipherable] and the Russians took us out of the o --\nmovie house. And we -- we couldn\u2019t understand, we were absolutely stunned. Well,\nwe spoke Polish to each other, so we were spies. Spiong. Crazy, crazy idea. Didn\u2019t\nwe go through enough? They took us to a si -- a station, Russian station\ncommandantura, sort of, and they had so many people they were get -- catching on\nstreets, people, Germans, that they opened that -- I remember a large wrought iron\ngates. They opened and they pushed us in and it was full of people that they caught\nfrom streets. You know, they were sending them to Siberia. And the two of us were\nthere too. Just so happened that that very day, Irka had a very bad toothache, and we\nwent to a dentist that the Jewish committee paid for, and he pulled her tooth. And it\nstarted to hurt her, and she started to cry. And she kept crying and they started to yell\nat her, they were annoyed that she was crying. And finally they were so annoyed that\nthey opened the gate and threw us out. This is another moment that saved us, because\nwe would have been sent with the rest of the people, God knows where. Once we\nwere thrown out, and went back to our room, the very next day I said to her, I\u2019m not\ngoing to st -- there were sectors, American, British, French and Russian. We were in\nthe Russian sector. Schlactensee was in the Russian sector. I said, I\u2019m going to go to\nAmerican sector, or English, or -- anything but. Now, th-the -- the [indecipherable]\nthat -- that train was going around Berlin to all the sectors. It -- at that time 1t was not\nclose, you could get on and get off. So how do you go -- everybody had to be\nregistered. You know, the German red tape, you have to be registered with polisi --\npolice. So what do we do? We were getting ration cards, certain rations from the\nAmerican relief organization, Jewish. There was a rabbi, with a --",
        "A: Joint -- Joint Distribution, that\u2019s it, Joint Distribution. So we had some coffee and\ncigarettes. Now, to have coffee in Germany, you don\u2019t need diamonds after the war,\ncoffee was it. So our brains started to work, with this coffee, maybe they can register\nus in American sector. I can get rid of the coffee, anything just to get out from this\nterrible situation. And we left, we went to a police station in the American sector --\nunbelievable, is -- isn\u2019t it? It -- it\u2019s -- it -- it\u2019s like -- like make- up story. And we\ntalked to the German who was in charge, and I said, if you put our names there, here\nis the coffee, we just want to be in American sector. He understood because he also\nliked to be in American sector. He took the coffee, he put two -- two cards with our\nnames and registered us, and we never put a foot in the Russian sector again. We --\nno, Irka got herself some friend. Irka was a flirt, she was very pretty. I was always\nscared. I was always scared. So I applied and asked, and -- I don\u2019t remember this was\nthis was this German [indecipherable] of police that assigned me that -- to that room.\nNo, there was another camp, I was in another camp. That was Schlactensee, defin -- I\n-- [\u2019m mixing up. The first camp that I was was on Oranienbergerstrasse in the ru --\nRussian sector.",
        "A: That was the rush --",
        "A: Schlacten -- Schlactensee -- you see, I mix -- I\u2019m sorry. Oranienbergerstrasse was\nthe first one, that was Russian sector. Then we went to Schlactensee, which was in\nAmerican sector. I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s so many years. And we were in Schlactensee, and we\nwere assigned places of course, and -- and I was there for awhile, and I didn\u2019t like it.\nI just didn\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t want to go into details, I just wanted to leave. I wanted to\nlive a little bit more normal. People were occupied doing things, going pl -- pl --\ndriving, making money. I-I was a lost soul, I didn't want to have --",
        "A: Sort of, yes. The exchanging stuff. They were going to Breslau and back, to\nBrotswow. I was never that enterprising. So all I wanted is to have a -- a private room\nsomewhere and -- and be left alone. And I went to the American Jewish chaplain and\nthere was some sergeant there who ask me if I have relatives in the United States. So\nI said, all I know is that my maternal grandmother had a sister and half a brother.\nAnd the sister lived in Detroit. So I gave him the name that I remembered, because I\nhad really nothing to do with them, and their name was Polsonsky, that\u2019s all I knew.\nAnd we received the ration cards and Irka got herself a -- a -- a gentleman. And I was\ngiven the room by Frau Pegello on Tanaustrasseactsane. Yes.",
        "A: I still remember that. And there was a nice room, and I stayed there, and from\ntime to time I was going to this Joint Distribution, getting my ration there. I still had\ntough times. I still didn\u2019t feel that this is the freedom that I longed for, and I said\nwhat -- what life holds for me again? Wh-What I\u2019m gonna do? I didn\u2019t want to stay\nin Germany. I didn\u2019t want to stay in a country that I suffered, and that killed my\nfamily. I didn\u2019t want to live in Poland because this was a country that I grew up,\ncountry that I loved, country that -- whose language and literature and music I loved,\nand where people with whom I grew up didn\u2019t want me, so I didn\u2019t want them. The\nidea of going -- at this time there was no Israel or Palestine, wouldn\u2019t apply to me\nbecause I was too sick, I was not capable of any work. And America was the only\nsolution. About six months later I received a letter from the Joint Distribution, they\nlocated my family in Detroit. Family that changed the name, from Polsonsky to\nSouls.",
        "A: It\u2019s amazing. You see, as I said collectively, all these little things, like beads in the\nnecklace, one was next and next and next. Evidently, when I have bad times, and\ndoubts, why -- why did I survive, and all this [indecipherable] they say, well you\nwere meant to survive and there was a purpose to -- to keep you alive.

One was even prominent in Republican party. A water\ncommissioner from New Jersey. So they speeded up the process of -- to obtain visa\nfor me. And I was awaiting that result in this apartment, Frau Pegello, who after\nawhile warmed up to me, and wasn\u2019t afraid of me any more, and Frau Pegello always\ntold me, Fraulein Fisher, Miss Fisher, I am an old lady, I\u2019m over 90, I have seen a lot.\nI was a Nazi and all my neighbors were Nazis. And now nobody was Nazi, only I.\nWell -- well, we ended up as sort of friends. I said, I want you to learn about me, who\nI am, and -- and we -- we parted on friendly terms.

        "A: Bremerhaven, I think. I think Bremerhaven. On Marine Marlin, which was an\narmy transporter, used to transport the army back and forth. And this was another\npiece of injustice that I suffered, because we, the people who were -- some survivors\nthat were booked on this line were put in the very bottom of the boat, and the top\nwere reserved for the German war brides. So we were again nothing down there. To\ntop this off, we s -- we sailed in December of \u201946, and we encounter a horrible storm.\nWe lost part of the bow, and we were 16 days on the ocean. Everybody, including the\ncrew, was deathly sick. We were throwing up our guts, nobody could eat. And we\nwere wondering if -- why did we survive to die in the middle of the ocean?

I was sitting there, almost the last one, and finally I saw a gentleman\nwalking by waving a photo. And the photo was of my grandmother. And I said to\nhim, my grand -- in Polish, and he didn\u2019t speak Polish. I said, speak German? No, he\ndoesn\u2019t speak, he only speaks English, American [indecipherable] only English. No\nPolish, no German, no Russian, no French, English. But he picked me out by hand\nand we walked out and there at the outside door stood an elderly gentleman with gray\nhair -- white, snow white hair with pink cheeks and blue eyes and I knew that\u2019s my\nfamily because he looked like my grandmother, and that was her half brother. And\nthis was his son-in-law who picked me up, he -- this was the lawyer. Now the story\nwas that I was supposed to go to my grandmother\u2019s sister in Detroit. What happened\nwas that it took our ship to sail for so many days that the elderly lady who so\nanxiously awaited my arrival, died just prior to the boat docking in New York. And\nthe family from Detroit let know the family in New Jersey that I am arriving on this\nship and somebody should pick me up because they are her funeral. Story.

        "A: Well, I arrived in New Jersey because the family to whom I was supposed to go in\nDetroit, there the lady who was my grandmother\u2019s sister passed away, and they let\nthe New Jersey part of the family know of my arrival. I was picked up at the pier, and\nI stayed with them, since Detroit was busy with the funeral and the mourning period.\nI stayed for couple of weeks in New Jersey, and I developed a very warm friendship\nwith the great-uncle, and his wife, who was an elder -- elderly, charming lady,\nspeaking few languages, and she endeared herself to me, because she made me feel at\nhome. It was warm, it was not anything material that I needed, I needed -- I needed\nlove and affection, and that\u2019s what she gave me. But after couple of weeks they sent\nfor me to go to Detroit. They put me on a train in a very beautiful, luxurious car. I\nwas sitting with the chair facing the window, turn around chair, I remember, and they\ngave the porter extra money to take care of me because I couldn\u2019t speak the language,\nto bring me food and so forth. And it was a long trip, and when the train arrived in\nDetroit, a whole group of people ar -- were awaiting me. Now, at this time, I forgot to\nmention that when I was leaving Germany, I was still having some ration from the\nJoint. I had some coffee, cigarettes, and I never smoked. So I decided to change this\nfor some decent clothes. So I received for my cigarettes [indecipherable] some fur\ncoat. Some -- I -- [indecipherable] I-I think 1t was, and a nice hat, and I looked -- I\nwanted to look presentable when I was arriving. So when J arrived in Detroit in this\ncoat, and white gloves, and I looked -- I suppose I was already nourished because in -\n- Joint gave us food, and in -- in New Jersey I was getting good food and care. So I\ncame -- I -- I looked almost human. They were all stunned. I don\u2019t know what did\nthey expect? Some spectacle? Somebody wh-who is from beyond the moon? Who --\nof course, I didn\u2019t speak English, but here I looked like a lady. And they brought me\nhome. The older lady and her husband were very nice and they spoke some German,\nso there was some communication. But they had only daughter who was, well, I must\nsay she had two degrees from various universities, but that doesn\u2019t make a person\nvery bright, or very polite. And she made my life miserable. She resented me. I was\nthe attention gathering point. My -- that -- that -- the daughter-in-law of this old lady\nthat died wanted to be very nice to me. She was very nice lady. She was patroness of\narts and music, and I could communicate with her because I loved it. And her\ndaughter resented every single thing that I -- I did or said. They sent me to a night\nschool to learn English. And this was a class composed of elderly people who came\nhere very early as -- I suppose 1-in the 1910 or 20\u2019s. They worked all their lives and\nnow that they were retired they were -- wanted to learn the proper language. So after\na few weeks, the teacher said, my dear, this is not a class for you, because y-you will\nlearn rapidly in a different class. And I stopped going there. What I really wanted\nwas to have a good medical care, but my family, for some reason, did not take me to\ndoctors.",
        "A: No. I wouldn\u2019t ask.",
        "A: They knew, but this was healed by this time. It was crooked, you can still touch it,\nhow crooked it is, but I didn\u2019t ask. I -- I just -- I never partook of anything that\nwelfare had to offer, or my family had to offer. I just wasn\u2019t brought up this way. So,\nway -- since I was here, I did not bother with that aspect, and it wasn\u2019t that noticeable\nat that time. And I -- I -- the family did not understand that I had pride, I didn\u2019t want\nto be given few cents. I was walking without a penny in my pocket. Now, when -- I\nwanted to work, I wanted to earn some money. Now, they took me to a bakery one\nday, and I was supposed to sell bread and cut bread, but evidently I wasn\u2019t fast\nenough, so after the whole day work, they dismissed me without pay. And I -- I came\nhome and everyone said, you didn\u2019t get paid? You have to get pay anyway. I said,\nbut they didn\u2019t like my work. So I didn\u2019t get any pay. So that was the end of the\nbakery. But I still didn\u2019t like being so dependant. I wanted to -- my independence.\nAnd I -- I was very unhappy with the daughter\u2019s treatment of me, so I decided to get\na job on my own. Now, Detroit has a large Polish population, and I went to that\nPolish sector -- these are people who live here many years, but Polish 1s still the\nlanguage of the house. I got my serve -- sort of menial job working on camera cases,\non -- I don\u2019t remember exactly, but I think it was --",
        "A: [ -- I -- I think I was getting about 18 dollars a week. I -- those days, I -- and my\nfamily -- so-called family was absolutely stunned. You don\u2019t have to work, you have\nbed, and you have food, and you have -- I want to be independent. I don\u2019t want to ask\nfor 10 cents, if I want ice cream cone for instance, I just don\u2019t want to. So I decided\nto save the money enough for a ticket to go back to New York, and to the family in\nNew Jersey that I loved, that old lady. Now, the old lady with her husband in New\nJersey, who was my grandmother\u2019s half-brother, they were retired people in not too\ngreat financial situation. Their children were quite well off, but they lived a very\nnice, middle income group. And I got myself -- they accepted me with open arms,\nand I got myself -- I went to nursing class. By that time I was already rapidly learning\nthe language, reading, going to movies, picking up quickly. And I -- I couldn\u2019t go for\nthree years, so I went for a short course in private -- private nursing to take care of\nnewborn infants. I loved babies, and I didn\u2019t have to speak to them. And I got my\ndiploma, and my very first job that I had was with the doctor from the family who\nrecommended me to another doctor, they had new baby. And I became part of their\nfamily, they -- they were just -- till today. Till today I am in touch with them. And\nmy very first pay I gave to my aunt, and I said, now I\u2019m independent, I can pay. And\nit was a wonderful feeling. But the -- the freedom had a fringe always, of guilt. The\nsurvivor guilt. And I -- I was not the very happy person that I was before the war.",
        "A: Well, people knew that bad things happened to me, but they thought that by\navoiding the subject they did not make me feel bad going back to it. And I thought\nmaybe even for therapeutic reasons I should have talked about it, and I did not start\nmy talking until quite late. It developed as my own project and it grew by word of\nmouth.",
        "A: My public speaking.",
        "A: In private, well we mentioned things. They knew about my back being scarred,\nand the ribs crooked here, and about family, yes, everybody\u2019s gone, and everybody\u2019s\nkilled. Oh, that\u2019s just terrible, let\u2019s not talk about it. They thought that they did me a\nfavor not to go back into it. But I felt that since we were getting on, getting a little\nolder, and older, and something has to be said, something has to be aired. And when\nthe museum came into being, this was for me a -- a tremendous step. But by that time\nI was speaking already on my own.",
        "A: I felt independent.",
        "A: I made friends m-m-mainly were in the class, the nursing class that I was. I was a\nlarge group of people and I made some friends, I was invited for Christmas holiday,\nfor the Christmas tree and so forth, and we became friends, yes. And the people for\nwhom I worked, I was always very fortunate, I -- I worked for people who treated me\nas a member of a family, as an equal. Not like that cousin\u2019s daughter who made me\nfeel very inferior, and th-that\u2019s what I said, you don\u2019t need the college degrees to be\nabsolutely a -- a miserable, evil person. Knowing intelligence from book doesn\u2019t\nmake you a whole person.",
        "A: Not -- no, not in the beginning, no. I am not really very religious person. It would\nbe very difficult, even if I would have been, to continue being very rely -- religious.\nAs I said in my tape, some people lost their faith completely, and some people died\nwith the name of God on their lips. So my family, my father and my mother were no\n-- were very free thinkers. They were not very observant. My grandparents were. Th-\nThe older family. And we spent holidays together, which the memories of this I\ntreasure. That is the warmth, this is -- you ask me before what gave me the\nbackground, the strength. The strength, part of it, is due to the basic background of\nthe person. Of the family, of the ethical, moral upbringing of the behavior and of the\nsense of obligation to society and to myself and I always said that, if people ask me\nabout religion I said I -- I am not very organized in religion, but if I obey the\ncommandments, I\u2019m religious. It doesn\u2019t have to have a label. I don\u2019t do anything\nthat they say don\u2019t. And I -- and I do respect people and respected my parents, and I\ndidn\u2019t steal and I -- thou shall not kill. Yes, I am that kind of p -- th-therefore I am\nreligious. So I never thought that I needed a house of worship to make me religious.\nA human being can be religious, like my father said, that God surrounds us in -- in\nthe nature. When you sit at a bank of the river, as I did with my father, and we\nwatched the flow of the water, and the little ducks on it, and the flowers and trees,\nthis -- this 1s part of my religion.",
        "A: When I survived and came here, this was the uppermost thing in my mind. I\nwanted a child so badly, because I felt that I owed this to my family. I wanted a child\nto show Hitler that I conquered him. And when my granddaughter -- the strange part\nhere is that I, my mother was not religious, my father was not religious, I was not\nreligious. My daughter is not religious, but she sent her daughter to Hebrew school,\nand her daughter had Bat Mitzvah, which neither she, nor I, nor my mother had. And\nI spoke at that Bat Mitzvah, and at one point I said, 1f I remember verbatim, that\nsome honorable people up there must be smiling today, because our seed survived\nafter all. I addressed this to my granddaughter. She is -- she\u2019s the one who is carrying\non. So sometimes -- and when I was pregnant, when I wanted to get pregnant, my\ndoctor said, this will be very bad for you, your back. It will throw you off completely.\nI said, it\u2019s worth it. I had to have a child. I wanted to get married because of\n[indecipherable] you just didn\u2019t have a child without being married that -- those days.",

        "A: No, no. He was born in Germany, and his parents, a middle-class family, had six\nchildren, and in 1935 - six - seven, started to send the children out, one by one out of\nGermany. And they followed them in 1938. So this was wise, because if -- some very\nwealthy people didn\u2019t leave because nobody could believe what would happen. I\nmean, it was just unthinkable. But they survived because they were just middle class\npeople, they sent one by one the children here. My husband arrived here as a boy,\nwent to high school and high school, and started university in Rochester, but had a\nvery tough time financially, and had to -- he worked anyway. And I met my mother-\nin-law first, before I met my husband, as a -- as a nurse. And she was a dear, sweet,\nwonderful lady, who she -- when she lived in Brooklyn on a f -- low floor, the\nwindow was open and theres was sitting Frau Rochelle with cookies, and gave\neverybody cookies, and she was known in the whole neighborhood. And when she --\nwhen I took care of -- took care of -- was it that child in the hospital? But I got to\nknow her, and I visited her. And way -- she said, I have a son, a very nice boy. And\nlater when she talked to Harry over the phone, because Harry lived on the west coast,\nshe said, she\u2019s not only nice girl [speaks German here], she speaks German. That was\nto her -- because she didn\u2019t speak English, so to her this was just wonderful. And I\nmet my husband, she went to west coast, her si -- her daughter lived in Oregon, and\nthey sent for me, just like that, and I started -- first I corresponded with him.

I was not that desirable either, because I was not that well. I had to\ncompromise somehow. I wanted somebody who\u2019s nice, who has had some things that\nwe shared, love for music, love for animals, love for nature. We are otherwise very\ndifferent people. But I had to settle for certain things. My husband will like operas, I\nlike classical music. My husband will read certain things, I love to read, I\u2019m an avid\nreader. I enlarge my vocabulary, English, by reading. I went to community college to\nbetter myself. I -- I -- under normal circumstances, I suppose I would have gone on\nand on because, education. My husband, education 1s important to him, but he was\nnot as fast in it, and he worked, he made very mediocre living. I was happy. I mean,\nthis was not the most important things.

So I must admit, I wasn\u2019t good. My -- my -- my two\nuncles were pianists, but I didn\u2019t in-inherit this, and neither she did, did she? Alexis\nplays piano, but also she\u2019s not a pianist. She plays piano.",
        "A: A very, very difficult in United States, because she would say, her mother let her\ndo this, or -- I said, well -- there was a saying in my house. She -- her best friend was\nbrought up in a very free house, very free. At the age of nine, she could go\n[indecipherable] hang out, or go to a movie or something. And she said Annie can go.\nI said, you can\u2019t go. So she used to -- she wanted to hurt me, she didn\u2019t know how.\nSo she said, you\u2019re such a continental mother. This was the worst she could come up\nwith. I was a -- I said yes, that\u2019s your misfortune. I -- I set the limits on -- to a certain\npoint. When -- Annie was brilliant, her best friend. No doubt about it, extremely high\nIQ. She went to Bronx High School of Science. My daughter didn\u2019t, my daughter\nwent just to high school. She was permitted to -- to do things, some her own. Her\nteacher told her mother that she reached the top, they can\u2019t teach her any more. Annie\nbecame some sort of a failure in life. They still communicate, they love one another,\nthey -- when Annie used to come to my house -- we lived in the same building, too.\nWhen a -- she used to come to my house, or -- I insisted on open door. This was one\nof my -- because Annie I didn\u2019t trust. Annie\u2019s smoking, and things -- what she was\nsmoking. My daughter didn\u2019t smoke. I said, I\u2019m not going to sit and preach to you\nthat it\u2019s bad for your health, but I said, look what\u2019s happening to these people later\non. You -- you have brain, use it. She never did.",
        "A: Drugs and things. Never did. Neither did Alexis, I\u2019m very fortunate. Neither did\nmy son, you know. Well, he was brought up by very square people in England. So we\nwere very lucky there. I never pressed on her any strong beliefs, she develop her\nown. You know, we had many arguments, a number of them, yes, because I tried to\nfoolishly spare her some of the disappointments in life. But evidently you have to go\nthrough the experience yourself to learn. And I wanted to spare her the hard lessons.\nSo sometimes it was backfiring. However, at the end she realized that maybe I was\nright after all. So --",
        "A: I la -- I never made a secret of my past, but she herself had -- her -- her love for\nme 1s so deep, so intense, that she did not want to know the details, til today. She\ncannot stand listening to how they did it to me, and what they did to me. For instance,\nthey pulled my wisdom teeth without anesthesia, learning. And at one point, and I\ndon\u2019t remember it was Ravensbriick, somebody pulled my teeth, yeah.",
        "A: For instance, when we arrived in Ravensbruck, we were subjected to the medical\nexam. We had to be stripped naked in front of the men there and put on the chair with\nlegs up, I never saw this. They were looking for valuables, and -- and they were\nlaughing because we were virgins, few of us there. This -- 1t was very humiliating --\nhumiliating, degrading experience, that she wouldn\u2019t want to hear, and she wanted to\nspare me, le -- don\u2019t think about it. When I had bad dream, don\u2019t -- get away from.\nTil today she cannot stand my -- she feels sometime that I am too pessimistic, that I\nhave bad moments, and she calls every night. Every single night. And no matter,\neven if we had argument, which we do, she ends up with I love you. Because she\nonce said, I never want to be sorry that I never said to my mother I love you when\nshe was here. That some people say it\u2019s too late, I should have told my mother this\nand this. We are friends as well as mother and daughter, and that 1s wonderful.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",

        "A: Nana and Papa.",
        "A: Yes. Very, very close relationship. As -- my relation with my mother was more\nformal than my daughter and myself. We are more friends. Where with my mother\nthere was a -- a -- some formality, some respect, which here in the United States is a |\n-- sometimes a little absent. I sometimes wouldn\u2019t dare to approach my mother in a\nmanner that my daughter will come to me. However, we very freely express the love\nfor one another, and my daughter calls me nightly, saying I love you, Mom. And [Il\nsay I love you, no matter how angry I can be at her. So -- and this is the closeness.\nMy mother-in-law -- my mother, for instance, prior to the outbreak of the war, was\nbeing courted by a -- a physician, because my dad passed away couple of years. And\nshe tried to keep me still very, very young. She used to come home in the evening,\nand she\u2019d say, 1s the child asleep, and I was 14. So th-this didn\u2019t happen with my\ndaughter and me. That -- that was a little bit different.",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: It\u2019s going to be 50 years this December. And we got married on the 22\u2122 of\nDecember because he had day off on Christmas, and we had no money, so there was\nvery -- just right. I remember a small, little detail, we went to the store to look for a\nwedding band, and the clerk said which one would you like, and I said, I would like\nthe cheapest. Yes, because it didn\u2019t matter to me.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The beginning was tough. I still had my European way of thinking. My\nupbringing. The -- certain things bothered me. I --",
        "A: Sometimes there are bra -- they were abrasive, the Americans. I used to go to the\nsubway, and I used to get up and give my seat away, and people thought I was crazy,\nbut I was brought up this way. I couldn't understand otherwise. There were young\nkids spread around with the legs sticking out, they wouldn\u2019t dream of getting up. I\ncouldn\u2019t under -- this. In my mind, I criticized this. I ate differently, I used my fork\nand knife differently. I was different. It took me time. Not that -- funny part is I\nlearned to eat chicken drumstick with my hand now, and I think it\u2019s very\ncomfortable. I really like it. But I wouldn\u2019t dare to do it at home. No, the beginning\nwas tough. And the lack of the -- the knowledge of the language makes it very tough.\nAnd then you see people who even were kind towards the newcomers, still called us\nuh -- these are the -- they don\u2019t know much, they\u2019re from Poland, what do they\nknow? And I thought to myself, they don\u2019t really know me. They don\u2019t know my\npotential, and to them I was -- I was just the newcomer, a displaced person. What is a\ndisplaced person? A person who was chased away from somewhere and came here in\norder to rebuild their life. But that person, even though may not use your language\nyet, or your customs, can be equal, or sometimes even maybe superior to the people\nwho criticize her. So the beginning wasn\u2019t easy.",
        "A: Nobody who is not walking in the shoes can understand fully what has happened.\nYou have to suffer to understand somebody else suffering. My -- my experience with\nthe family, for instance, with their daughter, she was minimizing everything, and I\nwas -- I -- I wouldn\u2019t talk about my experiences, because I felt that I created a\ndisruption in the family by my coming there. I didn\u2019t feel comfortable. I wanted to be\non my own. So my beginning was difficult, un-until I went back to New Jersey and\nstarted working. And then I got married. Even after I got married, my English wasn\u2019t\n-- getting better, not as fluent as it is now, I am more articulate with the passage of\ntime because I made my business to learn the language properly. And I will never get\nrid of my accent, but I will speak correctly, hopefully. I don\u2019t say don\u2019t, he don\u2019t, I\nmean, like, like, you know, you know. I try to avoid this, and I can see this in my\nown family, but th-this is something that makes me me.",
        "A: Well, when I had my child, it wasn\u2019t easy. I was very happy because I had the\nchild, and I wanted a daughter the worst way. I was so partial to it that sometimes it\nscared me, because the doctor said I should -- if I attempt to have a child, I shouldn\u2019t\nhave -- try again, because of my health. So I said, oh, if there is any power, anything\n-- | wanted a daughter because a daughter usually is closer to mother than a son. And\nwhen I had a daughter, I was absolutely in seventh heaven. At that time my husband\nworked nights because he had 15 percent bonus for working nights. We lived in New\nYork, and I lived on this fourth floor. And of course my pains came in the middle of\nthe night when he wasn\u2019t home. So we had prepared a telephone near my -- telephone\n-- maternity [indecipherable] sort of, and I called him, and the man downstairs came,\nhe says, come down. I says what do you mean come down, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I have\npains. I -- I had to walk down with my little piece of luggage down. It was a plain\nman with a car, who made himself maternity -- and he took me to the hospital in the\nmiddle of the night. I walked with this little luggage, with the pain, and they ask me,\nare you married? Because who comes alone to have a baby in the middle of the night.\nSo I said, what do you think? So this was funny. And of course, after I had my -- my\ndaughter, I was absolutely deliriously happy. And I totally devoted myself to\nbringing her up. And the result is good. It paid off. And we are very close. We share\nmany interests. Well, they are diverse. For instance, our taste in literature is a little\ndifferent. And I adopted some love of the new music, because after all I had a\nteenager home, a girl, so I could tolerate The Beatles, for instance. But when the new\ngroups started coming, I couldn\u2019t take this, quite. You know, it -- an-and especially\nnow, it -- it\u2019s a lot of vulgarity and -- and in the movements and in the -- in the lyrics,\nso-called. And this 1s -- this is totally u-undesirable.",
        "A: No, strangely enough, when I moved to New York City, because I got married on\nwest coast, we -- we decided to come back because my husband\u2019s mother became ill\nwith cancer, and I said, I lost my family, and I love your mother, we have to go back\nto New York. And I was pregnant. We arranged rides from city to city, sharing\nexpenses until we reached -- reached New York. And we got an apartment at this\nwalk-up in the Bronx, and I see my mother-in-law deteriorating, but she did see her\ngranddaughter born. And I loved her. I respected her. What else can --",
        "A: About friends, yes. We moved to this building in the Bronx, and there were no\nsurvivors that I knew in that building, but we became then the really good friends,\nbecause we were in the same, at that time, little lower middle class financially\npeople, but with the same hopes and aspirations. We wanted our children to be\neducated, and th -- to have a decent upbringing. I learned how to play Mahjong. And\nI played Mahjong with the ladies. And they were one Italian lady, Connie, whom I\nadore, and three Jewish ladies, one in my building, two across the street. It was safe\nto walk out on the street in the evening. When I took my baby in the carriage, we\nwalked to that park in the evening because it was hot, there was no air conditioning,\nand the apartment was s-stifling, and nobody was afraid because the times were\ndifferent. And we -- I met the other mothers with carriages there. And the -- it wasn\u2019t\neasy, but it was a happy time, because I had what I wanted. Of course, financially\nwas a little difficult. We never hit if off really, but it -- it -- it -- it didn\u2019t matter to me\nthat much because I saw what can happen. We had so much and we lost it overnight.\nSo, the priorities changed. What was important was to have good family and enough\nto eat and be dressed and go to s -- schools are free here, libraries are free here, which\nis wonderful. People don\u2019t know, there are so many free. We used to go to Lewison\nstadium those days for free concerts. I took the baby in the blanket and we were\nsitting like in a amphitheater, around, and listen to concerts. It was free, it was\nwonderful. So if you partake of what the city could offer you, it is not the amount of\nmoney that people try to amass more, the greed is so enormous. They never have\nenough. My priority was not to amassing wealth, but wealth of cultural things, of\ngood life, and I hope that in some measure, I achieved it.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: The Seven Day War, you mean?",
        "A: Well, as I previously s -- mentioned, I am not religious, however, I have a strong\nfeel of Judaic tradition in me, because it is -- it is ethical, it\u2019s moral and it is\nmisunderstood. And I thought that my people deserved to have their homeland after f\n-- millennia of suffering. And the creation of the state of Israel meant an -- a lot to\nme. I was deliriously happy when Israel came into bene -- being, because it gave\nhome and hope to countless people who didn\u2019t have it. I remember one event on -- at\nMadison Square Garden, there was a big gathering on -- that was on the eve of the\nSix Day War, I don\u2019t remember the date, but Golda Meir was speaking, and I got\nthere in, with a friend of mine. And they were holding that Israeli flag and people\nwere just throwing money in it. And I had very little, but whatever I had, I put it in,\nbecause it was an -- I -- I was elated that the people deserved it, they should have it,\nand -- the homeland. So, I myself could not fit into the life there, because you have to\nbe strong, you have to be healthy. My life I made in United States, I\u2019m very happy\nhere. I became an excellent citizen, my husband and I, because we are civically mind\npeople. We are volunteers; my husband in hospitals four days a week, and I with my\nspeaking and helping, and I was a school mother. I went on every trip with this class.\nI was always he- helping. Of course, without remuneration, just because I thought it\u2019s\nnecessary. And -- you know. Yes?",
        "A: I went once.",
        "A: After the Six Day War. Six Day War, it was -- when the wall --",
        "A: -- in Jerusalem was liberated. Now, the trip to Israel was, my husband had a sister\nin Israel, who was sent by the parents prior -- in the 1930\u2019s, early 1930\u2019s. So we went\nto his sister. And she had three daughters [indecipherable] were married and the --\nthe -- the sons-in-law took us with the car, we went to Jerusalem. This I have to say, I\nhave to mention this. For somebody who is not religious, when I walked in\nJerusalem, this was one of the biggest impacts on my life. When I touched the wall,\nsomething happened to me, because it was like a link in history. I touched the wall\nthat for so many years was important to my history. I remember my grandfather\nhaving the sign for Jerusalem in his room, because every Jew\u2019s hope was someday to\nbe in Jerusalem. I walked the streets that Christ allegedly walked, the 14 station of\ncross, and something happened to me. I was walking on the cobbled streets that Jesus\nwalked. It was important to me, historically. I went to the Mosque, to the Grand\nMosque. I took my shoes off, paid my respects. I went there and I went down and I\nsaw the huge rack that was supposed to be the sacrificial -- he was supposed to\nsacrifice his son there, Isaac, and God stopped him. So all these things that you read -\n- | have books on -- on all the world\u2019s religions here, because I was interested, the\nimpact of Jerusalem, it was very deep, emotionally, spiritually, and -- and I thought\nto myself, if people only would know -- all three great religions are meet in this little\nplace, if we could learn how to get along. The Arabs say Salaam, and we say Shalom,\nit\u2019s so much alike. Both are Semitic. Yugoslavia, all these people, it -- it\u2019s religion\ndivides them, why? Why\u2019?",
        "A: Of course.",
        "A: Yes, I -- I learned so -- a very powerful lesson, [Il tell you what. Yad Vashem,\nwhen I went in, I was in the gallery, af -- that was only once, and so many years ago,\nand I looked in the somber, dark cham -- chamber, with the names of the camps. I -- I\nbroke down, I cried, because I thought of the people who did not survive. And when I\nleft Yad Vashem, and I opened the door, and I walked out, and that was very sunny\nday, and there was this street with the trees, and -- called the Avenue of Righteous\nGentiles, with the name of the Righteous Gentiles underneath each tree, this was my\ngreatest impact of Israel, because I was not aware, up through that moment, that there\nwere Gentiles who did help. This was the very first time. Nobody told me about that\nbefore, I don\u2019t know why. That people did help, and people paid the supreme\nsacrifice, that people cared. I thought nobody did. And this, in itself, motivated me to\nspeak and to mention this fact in most of my speeches, that there were people who\nwere righteous, that there were people who cared, in spite of everything. It was\ntremendous impact. I always mention this.",
        "A: Well, I became -- I became more reassured in my English, and I -- and my\ndaughter also said that I have something that I should share with people, that a --\nmaybe -- she calls this a gift, that I am able to communicate and impart of myself,\nand -- and present in such a way that it will be not offending to some people, but\nrather, instructional. And I try to do my very best to -- to fulfill this. I go -- I used to\ngo to every place that ask me, anybody who was willing to listen, to schools, and\nchurches, and public -- not really public, but groups of people that wanted to hear me,\nand I was very happy. And when I started to see the results and the letters that I was\ngetting, this became the impetus even more so, that I was able to reach some of them.",
        "A: Well, as an example, I can give you for instance the Navy intelligence unit. This\nunit is comprised of very young people. And I always tell it -- I have to repeat myself\nthat if they\u2019re in intelligence unit, they must be fairly intelligent. I have to say this\nbecause -- but they are also, at the same time, are very gung-ho, very -- how did you\nlet yourself to -- to go this way, and to be done to you. They cannot perceive that the\ncircumstances under which we were, were so outrageous, we were not only\npersecuted and beaten and starved by the Germans, but the Polish population was sort\nof enjoying it. Helping, and not helping us. We tried to -- to -- if we could get a gun\nsmuggled to ghetto. Me -- I understood first in Yad Vashem that there were some\nPolish people who did help, but up til that moment, I did not know it. There\u2019s a\nwhole wall of people names that did help, and I was in a shock, because I didn\u2019t\nknow that. My love was concentrated on the country of Denmark because what --\nwhat they did, as a country, as a country. They saved about 95 percent of their Jewish\npopulation. And I -- each time -- in San Diego there 1s a little place in a Balboa park\nthat has that little -- a Danish place, and German place, and Polish place with the\nflag. On Sunday they\u2019re open. Whenever I walk to the little Danish place, and there 1s\na book that you write, I say thank you, Denmark. They don\u2019t know why and who and\nwhat, but it makes me feel good.",
        "A: I try to communicate and you have no idea what a tremendous response I\u2019ve got.\nNow this was, I would say from the entire group, there was one Jewish woman\nlieutenant, and one half-Jewish. That\u2019s it. They were magnificent, all of them. They\nlisten intently, they made sort of mental notes. They ask question after my\npresentation. They listen to my explanation. I told them, yes, it\u2019s easy to say, but the\ncircumstances were such, we were completely helpless. I said, do you know how\nmany people committed suicide because they couldn\u2019t do anything? The world didn\u2019t\nlisten. They -- there was a Polish representative who -- who reached United States,\nJan Karski, he tried to tell them. They didn\u2019t want to listen, they didn\u2019t want to\nbelieve. So we were -- if the war would have been cut by a year, they could save God\nknows how many people. They never bombed the trucks that were leading to\nAuschwitz. So --",
        "A: I did -- my -- absolutely. This -- this was a hit, because this sabotage, in their eyes,\nwas a tremendous act of courage, which it was, because we risked death at every\nmoment. But at that point we didn\u2019t care anyway, because we thought we will die\nanyway.",
        "A: Ye-Yes. While -- excuse me, while I was riveting -- joining parts of the wings of\nthe p -- airplanes, I noticed a small notation in a Russian script, done by the Russian\nprisoners of war who worked at night shift, 1-1instructing us what to do and how to\nsabotage. When we joined the two parts, to leave a little bit opening at every third or\nfourth rivet, hoping that the force of air will force this rivet out. And this was\ntremendous, tremendous thing [indecipherable] us, and -- for us, and the -- the young\nintelligence officers were absolutely s -- mesmerized by this story.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: Well, when I spoke, it was very quiet, they were very intent on listening, they\nwere very polite. And when I finished, I\u2019ve seen few tears, I must say I did. Because\nthey were -- majority were men, but there a couple of women lieutenants, too. And\nthen there was a question answer period, and the qu -- two questions which very\nfrequently come up were asked there as well. And one of them was how did we\npermit this to happen to us. And of course, the answer is very incomprehensible to\nthem, but I try my very best to tell them that the circumstances under which we were\nkept completely prevented us from doing anything. There were a couple of revolts in\nsome camps, I believe, small, that the people were able to get some guns, some\nammunition, and even the Warsaw ghetto had revolt. But in Lodz ghetto, for\ninstance, where I was, it was impossible. We were surrounded by very anti-Semitic\npopulation. We could not get any gun for the life of it. We were -- as a matter of fact,\nthe people were rejoicing seeing our terrible situation. So -- and we were starved.\nNow, if you are starved, you don\u2019t have strength to pick up anything, how can you\nfight? That\u2019s why people were committing suicides, a lot of them. Besides the spirit\nwas completely broken when you saw members of your family and children being\ntaken away, and knew -- by that time you already knew that they were going to\nplaces where they were disposed of like a -- like a vermin. The second question that\nvery often I am asked 1s if I can forgive. I believe that I even spoke about it on my\nvideotape, and this question has two prongs. The people who committed these\nhorrible acts, and destroyed human beings, murder human beings, no I cannot forgive\nthem, and I never will. But the other people, the other German people, who did not\nparticipate, who were born after the war, who help, like Jehovah Witnesses, there is\nnothing to forgive. They did not do anything wrong. So as I said, there are two parts\nof this question.",
        "A: Well, when I go to schools, I try to tailor myself to the audience that I\u2019m speaking\nto. If 1 am in a class of let\u2019s say, junior high students, who are young children, I\nalways tell them to close their eyes in the beginning of my presentation, because\nwhat they see in front of them is an elderly lady who has some problems walking,\nand they cannot relate too much to her. So when I ask them to close their eyes and try\nfor a moment to visualize me as they are now, a-as I once was. I was a young girl,\nand I had shared the same interests as they do now. I was thinking of my friends, and\nI was thinking of boys, and of secrets. So I was young, and I was fairly good looking,\nand I didn\u2019t have any other worries as -- if I g-got enough weekly allowance to buy\nmyself something. But of course, now I\u2019m older. So I -- I try to sort of bring them a\nlittle bit up to my level, and lower myself to their level and I go from there. So when\nI speak about us as young girls in ghetto, they try to -- try to bring this to the previous\nsaying, that oh yes, I was once young, and how did I got into the situation? They\nlisten intently, and they ask question afterwards, and they write me letters. I\u2019m a\nrecipient of many, many hu-hundreds of letters, some of them which I sent to the\narchives, to the museum.",

As a matter of fact, some lay-\nsisters came from other classes, were standing at the door to listen, and -- and the\nreceptionist always [indecipherable] they -- they -- they ask questions, they bright,\nthey have -- they show that they have good schooling, and this is very rewarding to\nme, because if I can reach couple of them, then th -- I accomplished something.",

Thank you for coming to our school and telling us about the way it was\nfor you in the World War II. It meant a lot to me. My views on white supremacy and\nhating people of other ethnic backgrounds were changed. Your presentation helped\nme realize a lot of things that I never even thought of. I felt terrible to think my\nboyfriend of a year and a half, worshipped the man, the same kind of a man that\nbroke your back, or hit your grandmother. I\u2019m very sorry for many things I have said\nand done. I feel ashamed, ashamed for the SS tattooed on my hand. There are a lot of\nyoung people such as me who never even stopped to think of the real terrors. I know\nyou made a great impression on my mind, and I had stopped to think of the things\nthat I have said and done. Sincerely, C. Hale.\u201d Now, the letter is grammatically very\npoorly written, especially for a high school student in an affluent area. However, I\nmade a dent in her way of thinking. I made her think, and that is extremely important\nto me. She thought well enough of it to sit down and write to me. That means that she\n-- she some -- some sort of changed occurred in her. Now, even s -- even small\nchange. If she asks me to please continue speaking to people like her, that means that\nI have done some good.",
        "A: About, just about.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The price that I pay is my health. It is getting extremely difficult for me,\nespecially when I have to travel. But I do not want to s-s -- keep that occasion. If I\u2019m\ninvited -- for instance, I was invited to Duke University twice already. And I went the\nfirst time a-absolutely on my cost, because I do not charge for my speaking, I feel\nthis is my obligation, my obligation to -- to those who cannot speak for themselves.\nThe second time I was invited, and I was -- I was provided with a fare and a hotel,\nwhich helped. But of course, nothing for the speaking. And I received a booklet,\nbeautifully done, because I spoke for two days. The first day it was in a large\nauditorium which was filled to capacity. Besides the students, there was also some\ncontingent of faculty and ministers, couple ministers. And the kids who came little\nbit late, were sitting on the aisles, on the floor, because all the seats were taken. And\nthe second day I spoke in a classroom. This 1s a special course on Holocaust at Duke\nInstitute at this year. And the teacher of the course, Miss [indecipherable] who is\nPolish, was kind enough to send me a booklet comprised of the letters, he-headed by\nher own letter, and in which she said that she gave the students a task of instead of a\nfinal, to write a letter responding to Mrs. Rothschild. And I have the letters, and this\njust very special to me, and a copy of it I send -- she sent me two copies, and the\nsecond copy I sent to Dr. Ringleheim at the museum.\neasier to speak about it as the years go on, or do you still have a -- bad nights before\nor after, and bad dreams?",
        "A: I -- Lusually have, no matter how many years I will speak, there is apprehension\nbefore I go, because I don\u2019t know what kind of audience or reception I will receive,\nand there is sleeplessness that is usually associated with it, and it -- it bothers me a\ngreat deal. And then after I speak, and I come home, even though it was very good\nreception, I always have some thoughts that I omitted something important, that I\nshould have said this or that, and that was of major importance. But there is a sense\nof accomplishment.",
        "A: I made couple of mistakes, even on my video. I tried to -- to tell Dr. Joan at the\nvery end, when I speak of my liberation, on the interviewer asked me the day I was\nliberated, I said, April 26, 1944, and it was 1945. That\u2019s one thing. And another one\nwas oh -- of -- I get mixed up with my mother. I -- I just cannot say the right --\nmaybe this is this -- the terrible pain that I have in my heart. And also, once I made a\nmistake on --in my speaking, when I talked about Bittenberg, which 1s the city that I\nslaved in Arado airplane factory, and I said that the city had the church on which\ndoor the Martin Luther affixed the 1905 thesis. And in one speech I said Martin\nLuther King. And they couldn\u2019t take that King out, because it was too late.",
        "A: A cert -- no, certain things are very deeply engraved on my memory, that I will\nalways repeat it, and they stay with me. But many things slowly start fading away.\nAnd that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that I did speak for all these years. Yes, some things\nI -- as I said previously, I try to erase from my memory, like the faces of my\ntormentors. But some -- dates, for instance, I don\u2019t remember. And I don\u2019t remember\nwhat I wore when I left that camp. I called my friend in New York who was also in a\ncamp, she\u2019s, don\u2019t you remember? I said no. Then I -- I ask somebody about\nsomething and she said, Blanka, but I was with you. And I didn\u2019t remember that. So\nthe age takes over. That\u2019s why I\u2019m speeding with my speaking.",
        "A: I was in Poland only after I was liberated, and once I left after the bad reception, I\ndecided never, ever to come back to Poland. I was back in Germany couple of times,\nbecause the German government recognized that they did impair my health quite\nbadly. They crippled me, and the condition is worsening with age, so a couple of\ntimes I was granted a so-called cour. I was in a resort that the doctor treated me, and I\nreceived treatments, however what they gave me was not sufficient to cover all the\nexpenses like flight and the hotel, so I had to stop going to Germany for that reason.\nThe treatments were wonderful, much superior to the ones that I\u2019m getting here. I\u2019m\ngoing now to, so far, couple of times to Canestoga spa, which has some bath, and\nthey are not quite the same quality and value. But it does help me, so I do go there.",
        "A: Not so far, I -- I\u2019m receiving a gesundheitshan. I\u2019m receiving a m-monthly rent for\nmy broken health, but now there 1s a class action for the slave labor and I filled the\npapers, and I hope that I will be able to -- after all, I worked in Lodz ghetto for a few\nyears, in a -- 1s -- not factory, but this was establishment. I was working making\nsweaters for Germans, they needed for the winters. And then we were working on\nsome cement place, making blocks for the buildings that were being destroyed. And\nof course in the airplane factory until the liberation in the camp.",
        "A: Well, when I went there, I used to go to the spa. In the spa there were many\npeople who were coming for their vacation, and they were at the -- their very best, at\nleisure. And if they ever ask me anything -- not a person that I met knew about\nanything, so they were quite innocent. They did not know about the atrocities, they\ndid not hear about the camps. Anyway, the people that I met never, with the\nexception of the old lady in Berlin after the war, who admitted that she was Nazi and\nso were all her friends, the doctor and the personnel in the spa were very nice. After\nall, they were being paid for it, and the people that I met there were friendly with me,\nbut then I met couple of Dutch people there who come in for the same treatment. And\nthere were a couple of people even from Israel that I met there, and the local\npopulation I -- I -- I made friends with a man who made me brace, because I have to\nwear back brace, I just put it on. And in the beginning he -- his reaction was not too\nfriendly, but after awhile when he got to know me, he became very friendly. He and\nhis wife visited us in United States. He made me brace, for which he was paid by the\nGerman government, and he made me a brace as a gift.",
        "A: I really couldn\u2019t put my finger on it. He was not too intelligent man, but he was a\nvery good businessman. So he knew how to -- how to work for the government\nbecause he was doing this type of work for war amputees and -- and the braces, not\ntoo many people nowadays know this. There\u2019s no industry for making this type of\nbraces, so he was just about one of very few in all of Germany, and he cashed on it.\nIn the beginning why he wasn\u2019t too friendly, well I was somebody strange, and\nmaybe he thought that I resented him. I had to go to him from Bad Kissingen to\nSchweinhold on train, but the next time when he saw me and he -- he met me, and he\nsort of liked me, he came with his car to pick me up, and spare me the ride on a train.",
        "A: Well, wa -- once. People were careful with me when they knew that I was Jewish,\nbut once I had an incident because the couple did not know I was Jewish. And that\nwas in a caf\u00e9 and we were sitting at the same table, and they admired me, I\u2019m -- to\nthem I was somebody from America. And they said, how do you like Germany\u2019? And\nI said it\u2019s very nice. And they said, well it\u2019s very nice, but too many Jewish people\nare coming back. And at that point I excused them from my table. At the same token\nI spoke -- my husband was with me the last time -- couple of times because I needed\nescort, I couldn\u2019t travel by myself. My husband and I were sitting 1n the park,\nspeaking of course, English. And an elderly gentleman with wife were sitting nearby\nand start the conversation with us in German. And he became a friend. He was there\nfor his health. And we went to the caf\u00e9s together, and he was a very charming man,\nand he -- when we left for the States, they brought us very nice gift. And we\nexchanged Christmas greetings.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: When I lived in New York City, prior to being on the west coast, we lived for 20\nyears in the city, we -- I contacted the -- The Quaker Society, American Friend\nSociety, and I ask them to send a couple of students for a holiday for a dinner,\nbecause I wanted people from different countries to learn about us, and I thought that\none on one, it\u2019s the best way to learn about people. And one day the lady from The\nFriend Society called me and asked me if I would mind if she would send a German\ngirl. And I said, by all means send her to me, let her see me as I am. And she and a\nDutch girl came together to our house. She was in the beginning very shy, and very\nsort of frightened. But as the things progressed, and the dinner, we became quite\nfriendly, and she left as a friend, and that was an accomplishment. Yes, I think that\nthe young people should try to reach and meet, maybe some survivors, or people who\n-- whose family suffered to -- to form a common bond. It\u2019s very important when\npeople try to understand each other. After all, we are all individuals, we are all\ndifferent. We have different points of view, religions, cultural background, but we are\nall human beings, so if we try to overcome our prejudices, and reach a hand and\nlisten, then the world would be much better, much better off.",
        "A: Ah, that\u2019s such a tricky s -- question.",
        "A: Honestly I -- I am -- I am at times pessimistic, because I don\u2019t see much progress\nin many parts of the world. I\u2019m afraid that the human race did not learn the powerful\nlessons that Holocaust and the previous genocides provided. They are still going on\naround the globe. And it\u2019s not only Yugoslavia, but it\u2019s in Rwanda, it\u2019s in Sri Lanka,\nit\u2019s in yugo -- it\u2019s in Ireland. Bo-Both people are Christian, only different\ndenomination and they hate one another. I -- this is the greatest divisor of people,\nreligion. And if people would really, truly were religious in their hearts, they would\nfind a way to -- to find this common bond, and the link. But truthfully, when I see the\nsituation in Kosovo and Yugoslavia, I -- I am not too optimistic, sadly.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, on -- my last speaking enda -- engagement was at Duke University, and I\nspoke twice, one day to the third auditorium of student and some faculty and\nministers, and the next day I spoke before a class which was instituted this year,\nspecifically on Holocaust. The class is small si -- consisting of a teacher and 16\nstudents, and this teacher was kind enough to send me a lovely, bound booklet with\nsome of the -- with the letters. And she said she had high expectation for the class\nand student, and she worried, but eventually the class -- she was afraid that the class\nbecome desensitized by the narratives of horror. But eventually she saw the\ntransformation of students to deeper understanding. And she said, \u201cThis is the\nmoment that all teachers dream of, and I knew that the class had been successful. It\nwas your visit and your important message that coincided with this success. The\nstudent had already begun to bring the Holocaust, the human capacity for genocide,\nand the responsibility of the bystander into discussion about current social injustices\naround the world. They had started to question their own complicity. They asked\nwhat they could do for Kosovo, for Rwanda, for East Timor, for those suffering on\nour own soil, and it was your talk, your willingness to speak of your losses and to\ntestify for those who are forever silent. Your dedication to social action that solidified\nthis response from the students. It was invaluable for all students, ranging from those\nwho had never studied the Holocaust to your own granddaughter, to hear a survivor\nbear witness. All of the students posted lengthy notes about your visit on our email\nnews -- newsgroup.\u201d And I will read a couple of excerpts.",
        "A: Yes, by the way, they -- they endeared themselves to me because they all called\nme Nana, as my granddaughter does, who is part of this class. \u201cDear Nana, some\npeople come into our lives and quickly live -- leave. Some stay for awhile, leave\nfootprints on our hearts, and we are never, ever the same.\u201d This is how she started her\nresponse. Maggie Gandi wrote, \u201cMrs. Rothschild made clear not only her\nappreciation for the fact that we are studying the Holocaust, but also channe --\nchallenged us to spread what we have learned to future generations. Therefore, I\u2019m\ngoing to take from this class, more than the images provoked by any one passage or\nmovie clip, are the words of Mrs. Rothschild. The challenge that we not forget what\nwe have learned, and that we bear some of her burden by passing our knowledge onto\nour children and peers, so the stories of the Holocaust are never forgotten.\u201d Another\nstudent wrote, \u201cI had such a great time talking to her, not only about her Holocaust\nexperiences, but about life in general. I think that it took so much courage and\nfortitude for her to speak for over 30 years about -- 20 years, about her horrific\nexperience during the war. I just want to finish by saying that I admire Alexis\u2019s\ngrandmother so much for not only coming to talk to us, but for just volunteering to\ntalk to anyone who is willing to listen. I also admire her because she has such an air\nof dignity and pride that surrounds her. I am definitely a better person for having met\nher.\u201d There\u2019s so many. [indecipherable] Let\u2019s see now, I can\u2019t find -- \u201cIn our final\nmeeting the students presented me with a gift. They gave me a picture from -- frame\nengraved with the words, we will remember, April 14, 1999. Inside was a photo of\nyou and I with the entire class, taken on the day of -- of your visit. For me this gift is\na lasting monument, a commitment that the members of col -- Holocaust testimonies\nwill remain vigilant, strive for social justice, and educate future generations about the\nHolocaust.\u201d This 1s what -- she had it -- her letter with, but I wanted Melina.",
        "A: This letter Pll -- Il read an excerpt from, 1s from a girl from a -- Kosovo. Dear\nNana, I\u2019m writing this letter to thank you for coming to Duke on Wednesday. I --\nalthough I was unable to attend your formal talk, I enjoyed hearing your stories from\nan intimate perspective. They\u2019re extremely vivid accounts of your experiences in the\nconcentration camp, and encouraged me to think more about the situation in regards\nto my relatives in Kosovo. I am sure that those who have heard you speak will agree\nthat you have made a tremendous impact on their lives. I will never forget being\nmoved to tears by your words and emotion. I find it extremely fortunate that I was\nable to hear your experiences. Again, I thank you so much for coming. Until then, to\nyour health and happiness. Melina.\u201d And this is from my granddaughter. \u201cDear Nana,\nthank you for doing something for me that forever will be part of my memories at\nDuke. Your speech was wonderful and inspirational as us -- always. The presence\nthat you have while speaking to o -- strangers, bearing your soul and revealing some\nof your most painful experiences, astounds me. As I have said before, your family\ncan rest in peace knowing that you told and continue to tell their story. You are -- you\nhave touched many lives with your testimony, but you have touched me because of\nthe person you ca -- became -- become after the war. Your generosity, love and\nstrength are your greatest assets and you have taught me well, as I now enter my\nsenior year of Duke and begin to look for the road I will travel next, I will keep all\nthat you have told me in my heart. Thank you again for coming to Duke and for\nsharing yourself so unselfishly. I love you. Always, Alexis.\u201d",
        "A: Wonderful. Wonderful. Th-There\u2019s so many of them here, it\u2019s -- well, but Joan\nhas it.",
        "A: Yes, the booklet 1s -- I -- the teacher was thoughtful enough to send me two\ncopies, one for me and one for the museum specifically, and I forwarded it to Dr.\nronga -- Ringelheim.",
        "A: Well, I express myself, I feel very eloquently about it on my video. I -- I was\nabsolutely delighted with the creation of this museum, because it is a tremendous\ntool, not only of showing people what has happened, but as a tool for educating\npeople for the future, how to learn to get along. How to -- how to see things from the\nperspective of different human beings, people who went through it, people who did\nhelp, people who taught about it. The museum has testimonies of so many survivors,\nand they range from people who can hardly express themselves to people who are\nvery articulate and who can just bare their soul, and try to teach the listeners, and\nopen their eyes and ears and teach them the lessons.",
        "A: No, I disagree strongly. I disagree because then it would defeat the purpose. If it\nwould be only to perpetuate the Jewish Holocaust, it would be very parochial. I think\nthat the museum is a warning and teaching experience for people of all persuasions\nall around the world, of all the people who can have the access to the museum. It is a\nmorally and ethically marvelous tool, because it exposes people to -- not only to the\nevil, but also to the goodness. It exposes people to the teaching of the survivors like\nmyself, what did they learn, and what did they want to tell the future generations?\nBecause we as survivors are getting old, and we are dying out, and we will be the last\nones who will be heard from.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I disagree. This is my point of view. You can never take away\nfrom the culture by teaching people how to get along with other people. It is this --\nmy individual understanding, and I hope by -- that people who will listen to me will\nagree with me, that the museum, it was created for the purpose of teaching people to\navoid in the future, genocides not only of Jewish people, but all the people\neverywhere on this earth. Unfortunately, we have the bad examples occurring now\nthroughout the world. And this museum teaches people how to -- how to understand\nthis, and how to avoid. How can the museum be a -- a -- 0-only preaching about the\nJewish genocide? There\u2019s genocide now going on.",
        "A: I think that many of the survivors who became successful 1n their private lives\nwere very instrumental in pushing the idea of creating this museum, and they were\nable to support it financially. And ever since that time -- there are other museums in\ndifferent countries that are being spurred by the idea of the -- of the Washington\nHolocaust Museum.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m not too fond of them because they could never really portray the true\nHolocaust. The movie \u201cHolocaust\u201d that was in three or four parts, was a -- a -- a fairy\ntale, absolutely pointless. On the other hand, \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d was a teaching tool. I\nfeel that Schindler deserved to be mentioned because no matter what his motives in\nthe beginning were -- he was a businessman who wanted to cash in on, and make\nmoney. However, eventually, by seeing the injustice and the h-horror of the German\nauthorities, he changed his mind and he became instrumental in saving people. So\nthis fi-film I believe it -- 1t was worthwhile.",
        "A: Not really, because where I lived, I -- I have my few friends here who happen to\nbe just American born friends, and not necessarily Jewish. I -- we have a writing\nclass, we have a reading club, and I also play Bridge. I do not belong to the group\nwhich is very active in our city, of -- there is no -- no reason really, I just can\u2019t travel\nthem and I -- I stay in touch with people who help me because I can\u2019t drive, they pick\nme up and take me with them.",
        "A: As usual, my ending would be first thanking the interviewer for taking the time,\nand being very kind, and asking me all the questions and traveling here in the very\nhot day. And my philosophy is always the same, I try to persuade people to open\ntheir hearts, and open their ears, and thinking of -- that we are here on this earth, put\non temporarily, and we should make the best of the time that is allotted to us. Why do\nwe have to fight? What divides us? We all are of human race, no matter what color,\nwhat religious persuasion. We should concentrate on doing the very best to get along\nand to -- to divert our energy and resources to help eradicate the [indecipherable] that\nwe have spread around the world.",
        "A: That\u2019s ok -- that\u2019s all right.",
        "A: Well -- well, my life as I would have thought when I was young and hope for the\nfuture, it\u2019s very different from the one I pictured for myself. For one thing I thought\nthat I will go on with my education to -- to the -- to the nth degree because school\nwas always my -- my favorite. And my health problems prevented me from it.\nHowever, I taught myself English well enough to be able to speak about it. And I --\nand I educated my daughter in the manner that I wanted to be educated myself. And\nthe next generation, my granddaughter as well. So these 50 years, I am proud of what\nI did in my small measure, to -- to help. And I can see that the help is in the form of\nthe letters that I receive from people who listen to me, and in the next generation, my\ndaughter and my granddaughter, who are perpetuating my dream of good life and\neducation and -- and being close to the family.\n"
