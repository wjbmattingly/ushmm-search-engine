I went to school. I went to\nwhat we had called a public school but it was Jewish\npublic school as opposed to the general public school.\nMy parents were middle class people. My father hada\nsmall business and so did my mom. I had one sister and\nwe lived in a rather middle class neighborhood in an\napartment. And uh, I had a dog. Uh, that's about what\nall I can say. My--my uh interest at the time when I\nwas a child, especially the ages between maybe 7 and 10\nwas to swim in the summer uh in the river, uh skate in\nthe winter and uh play soccer and--and ping pong and\nthis was my uh what I like to do as a child.

The first\nchange was when the Soviet uh Union, the red army\noccupied Lithuania and that changed--I did not uh\nfeel--my parents did because my uh they lost their\nbusinesses do to confiscation of private property but I\nmyself did not feel any uh--uh lesser life.

So personally I felt very\nlittle. However, a year later, when the uh--Hitler's\nforces attacked uh the uh the--the Soviets, of course,\nretreated very quickly and--and within 2 days the\nGerman armies had occupied Kovno. And cause in\nthat--that was it began. My first notice of that was\nthat we lived in a building right next to the river;\nuh, on the riverside. And the airport was about maybe\n2 or 3 kilometers on the other side of the river\nand--and I--I was uh--uh--I was woked by explosions.\nWhen I looked out the window, I saw uh calks of smoke\nrising from the airport. Uh, my parents immediately\nrealized there's a war and when we turned on the radio,\nuh we realized that the Germans had attacked and that\nthey were marching towards our city. As I said, 2 days\nlater, they were uh, they occupied Kovno and the first\norder of their business was to uh--uh--uh to issue\nidics against the Jews and started to tell us what we\nVideo Tape No. Camera Roll No. Sound Roll No.\nKOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/DAVID LEVINE page 3\nInterviewed (5-1-97) by Sandra W.

So we had of\ncourse, radios at the time also we had to give up\ncameras uh, personally, I was only 12-years-old at the\ntime and uh course I was extremely scared of what would\nis about to come--not that I understood all that much\nbut what I heard the grown-ups talk and uh this-this\nfear was constantly with me and--and could always feel\nsome kind of a energy going through my body which I\ncould only describe as my stomach shaking and so on\nevery time I saw a German soldier. The other thing\nthat uh I was--was completely amazed me at that time\nwas the behavior of the general Lithuanian population\ntowards the Jews. It wasn't just that the Germans had\nuh--uh lead to us with their uh idics and laws and\nregulations but rather that the general population, the\nLithuanians, picked up arms, first against the Soviet\nsoldiers, as they were retreating.

Uh, in\naddition to that of course there was the scarcity of\nfood. Uh, immediately there was--whatever we had in\nthe house we ate. There was almost impossible for us\nto go out and to buy food. Uh, because in the stores,\nthey wouldn't sell us any. So somehow we had to gather\nwhatever we could--our--with our own wits to try to get\nsomething to eat or else you starved to death. And\nthat is part of what I used to do because I was small\nand young. I would go out and try to generate\nsome--some uh groceries somewhere and bring it home.\nUh at that time, it was pretty clear uh to me what the\nnext years, months or years would--would bring.\nSB: Um, tell me what happened to you uncle's family.\nDL: They lived in--in--in a--in a section of the city\nthat could called in Lithuanian it was called Viliolam-\npolay and in Yiddish it was called Slovakah.

That same area where my uncle's family had died\nearlier. Uh and it was called Slabatka and it was\ncalled a Slabatka ghetto and uh they had formed actual-\nly 2 ghettos because there was a main street or road\nthat ran through the uh city, so they had made one\nlarge ghetto, one small ghetto with a bridge that\ncrossed from one to the other. And--and we had to uh\nourselves find uh a place where to live. Of course\nthere were a number of uh people--Lithuanians, who\nlived in this area--they had to move out. In some\ncases we traded apartments. Some or traded places.\nThey would take the place or course we could take\nnothing with us except what we could carry like I said\nbefore transportation was forbidden. So, whatever uh\nwe could find in--in--in the empty apartments or what-\never what we could carry with us is what we sustained\nus for the rest of--of the time. Fortunately, we found\na place at the very end of the ghetto; in the very",
        "farthest part. And we found a 2 bedroom apartment that\nwas empty and um we moved in there of course the almost\nthe entire family that was left was moved in there.\nThere were as many as I believe 14 people.

The only thing is since a\nlittle a little innovation is that to carry some of the\nstuff that my mother needed uh for the new place cause\nwe made several trips back and forth. Uh, we uh took a\ntable and turned it upside down and made sort of a sled\nout of it and we put some cardboard around the legs and\ntied it with strings and put some stuff in there and\nthen pulled it all the way across perhaps as much as uh\num 7 or 8 kilometers and that was an ordeal but\nwe--we--we managed to take some things that we needed\nover and we moved into the new apartment and that--in\nthe ghetto--and that was, in away, to get it started\ncuz everyone will have a different story to tell and\nhow they got in and what happened cuz those uh Jews who\nalready lived there didn't have to do anything. The\nstayed in their own homes that they had lived in for\nmany years. Um, and uh, just life continued for a\nlittle while cuz the ghetto was uh surrounded with\nbarbed wire fences all the way around. There were\ngates to come in and out.

Uh, until uh\nsome things started happening very quickly and of\ncourse the first thing that happened was the--the\nelimination of the small ghetto that I had mentioned\nbefore. Um, there were perhaps as many as 2 or 3\nthousand people that lived in the small ghetto and all\nof them were taken to the 9th Fort at one time. I\nbelieve that was the beginning of October; either the\n4th or the 6th of October. And--and--and--and they\nwere taken there and--and--and at one point, they were\nbrought back because I don't know why. They were taken\nthere and brought back and--and they were telling us\nthat they had seen um they had seen graves--pre-dug\ngraves of what they thought were graves and but they\nhad brought them back, so we weren't very concerned\nabout that. But uh several days later, they took them\nout and didn't bring them back. And uh and this small\nwhatever--whoever was left in the small ghetto was\nforced into the large ghetto and uh the small ghetto\nstayed empty for a while. until the 28th of October and\nuh that 1s when the first what we called Indidist Case\nAction or the large selection and that is when half the\npeople of the ghetto were separated from the other half\nand taken to the 9th fort.

And we were told\nthat all of us had to leave our homes and uh gather in\na place called uh--uh the Democratu place and no one\nmay stay in the house and--and all the doors must be\nleft open because they were going to uh--going to\nsearch for contraband or hidden perhaps weapons, per-\nhaps communication radios, gold, silver, furs, whatever\nthey could find.

So as those\nwho had not yet gone through the selection, there was a\npiece of room between the those who had already gone\nthrough, those who had not. And occasionally some\nwould realize this was the good side and they would\nsneak over, even though there were Lithuanian guards\nguarding all the way across.
