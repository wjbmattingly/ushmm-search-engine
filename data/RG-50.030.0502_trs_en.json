        "Q: First let me say, welcome, I\u2019m so happy you\u2019re doing this for the Holocaust Museum.\nThank you, thank you, I\u2019m really glad to do it.",
        "Q: (Let\u2019s just start by you telling me your name, and when you were born, and where, and give\nme a little family picture.)\nMy name is Budd Schulberg, and I was born in really a neighborhood that is now Harlem \u2014 I was\nborn on 120\" Street, March 27, 1914.",
        "Q: And, in a way, my parents told me I was maybe the only person who was a born screenwriter,\nbecause my father wrote a photoplay \u2014 it was on a suffragist subject. My mother was a\nsuffragist, and he wrote a screenplay, a three-reel called \u201cWhat Every Woman Wants\u201d \u2014 I think it\nwas called. And he got $500 for that script, which was quite a lot for those days. And he told\nme it was that 500 that he paid the doctor, Dr. Jellyhouse \u2014 I\u2019ve always loved that name \u2014 who\ndelivered me, at home, and so I really owe my birth to film writing, you might say. My father\nwas one of the earliest, very early photoplay writers, as they called them then.\nWhat else?",
        "Q: (Take us from New York to California.)\nWe left when I was about six years old. And my father had been working for Adolf Zukor,\nFamous Players, as a writer and publicist, from about the age of 18 \u2014 he started very, very young.\nBut by the time I was born, he decided he would like to branch out on his own. And become his\nown film company producer. So we went out to Hollywood very early.\nI really remember the ride on that train. It was on the old Chief, Santa Fe Chief, before the\nSuperchief, even. And I vaguely remember that, being out on the observation car, and watching\nthe country fall away behind us.\nMy father and Louis Mayer, later the famous third \u201cM\u201d at MGM -\u2014 the two of them together set\nup a very early film studio, way downtown, not in what we call Hollywood now, but down by\nthe railroad tracks, way downtown Los Angeles. It was called the Mayer-Schulberg studio. So\nboth Mayer and BP, so they both were making these early silent films. That\u2019s about it.\nMy father\u2019s big discovery was Clara Bow. He found her in a Brooklyn beauty contest, actually,\nsigned her for 50 bucks a week, and brought her to Hollywood. I called Clara sort of a pre-\nMarilyn Monroe sex queen, sex appeal queen. She was known as the, as the \u201cIt\u201d girl, from a\nfamous novel of the time, and movie called \u201cIt.\u201d And she had it. Clara really did have It. She\nreally did. She\u2019s still amazing to watch in those silent films. And that\u2019s so \u2014",
        "Q: (How early did you get interested in writing?)\nVery, very early, I\u2019d say I was about 9 or 10, very early. It was very much a part of our\nhousehold atmosphere.\nMy father had started as a writer, with the, with those early photoplays. And he, also as a kid,\nworked on the old Daily Mail and a short time on the old World \u2014 papers that we, that we dearly\nmiss. There used to be about ten daily papers, and now we\u2019re down to about two and a half. So,\nso he, he had a great interest in, aside from film, in uh writing.\nAnd my mother was a frustrated librarian. And she set up a very big library, thousands of books,\nall set up like a regular library, all numbered like a library, a real library.\nMy father used to \u2014 Sunday morning was a ritual. He would read from the classics, aloud to us,\nSunday mornings until brunch, from about 9:30 or so. It\u2019s amazing what we read. We read\nthrough Dickens and Melville and Galsworthy, and we, how we, Sunday after Sunday for years\nand years, we heard that. So writing was very much part of our life. So I started when I was\nabout 9 or 10, started to write little stories, very much encouraged by my parents. So by the time\nI went to high school, I just thought of myself as a writer, as if it was already my profession.\nAnd it all went \u2014 it fell in place very naturally. I edited the high school \u2014 Los Angeles High\nSchool daily paper. We had a daily paper. I laugh because these days, my kids at Westhampton\nHigh School couldn\u2019t get out a monthly paper, and the thought of a daily paper, they couldn\u2019t\nimagine putting it out every day. But we did.\nSo anyway, that\u2019s why, so we breathed that atmosphere.\nMy sister Sonya wrote a very good novel when she was about 19, that Scribners published,\nentitled, They Cried a Little. Sonya said that in our house, where in other homes they might have\na piano and people might sit down \u2014 Sonya said, in our house, we had a typewriter, and as we\npassed we might type out a little jingle or something or a little story, and we all, Sonya and\nStuart, Stuart wrote very well, too.",
        "Q: (He was 8 years younger than you. That\u2019s quite a gap when you\u2019re kids.)\nIt was, yes.",
        "Q: (Were you and your siblings very competitive?)\nNot really. I was so much the elder of the three. And with my father and my mother divorcing\nwhen I was a teenager, 17 or 18, and Sonya and Stuart younger, uh, I was very worried about\nthem. I sort of uh, took on my father\u2019s failed responsibilities. I was worrying about their school\nand how they would react to a divorce, and all of that. So I wouldn\u2019t say we were very\ncompetitive, no.",
        "Q: (You were born just at the time that the First World War started. Do you have any memories\nof the First World War\u2019)\nIt\u2019s funny, I do have. One memory was being on a train going west, this was in 1918. It\u2019s\nalmost the first memory I have, being on a train. And I was about four years old. And, and my\nfather\u2019s partner, Harry Abrams, his daughter was about eight, and the two of us were in a bunk\ntogether. And we stopped in a station, and a train full of soldiers was just opposite the platform.\nAnd I remember looking at them and they were sort of jeering and making sort of lewd remarks\nabout, I don\u2019t know what they were saying, but I remember that moment.\nAnd I remember being with my mother ona _ as the soldiers were, had just come back from\nWorld War One and were marching down 5th Avenue, and I\u2019ve got just a glimpse of a memory\nof that. It\u2019s almost my earliest memories of World War One. I also remember collecting silver\ntinfoil, balls of it that somehow were being given for the war effort. I don\u2019t know exactly how\nthey used it, but those are the, those are about the only ways I relate to World War One.",
        "Q: (Let\u2019s jump forward to the approach of World War II. Now you have sudden success writing,\nright? Why don\u2019t you tell us about that period and give us a sense of Hollywood when the war\nstarted.).\nWell, 19 \u2014, let\u2019s see. When I got out of college in 1936, David Selznick, who had been my\nfather\u2019s assistant, had now set up his own studio, and was planning independent films, one of\nwhich of course became Gone with the Wind, and the first A Star is Born \u2014 which was the daddy\nof all those later Star is Borns.",
        "Q: (Let\u2019s start that sentence again.)",
        "Q: (Was there a direct connection between that experience and your later decision when faced\nwith testifying?)\nYeah. The funny thing is, while the, while the communists were denouncing me, Sam Goldwyn\nfired me. He was just ina rage. When I came in, he screamed at me. It was almost like that\nJudge Freisler. And he screamed at me. \u201cYou\u2019re a traitor! You\u2019re a traitor!\u201d Like that, he got\npurple, he was so mad. \u201cHow could you write that terrible book?!\u201d he screamed at me.\nAnd then, at the Motion Picture Producers Association meeting, that \u2014 my father of course was a\nmember and attended, and Louis B Mayer, his old partner, was now an enemy of my father. He\ntook off the same way, and he said, \u201cB.P. I blame you for this. You should have stopped him.\nIt\u2019s your fault.\u201d He was yelling, too. You have no idea how outraged they were about this thing.\nMy father said, \u201cLouis, I did try to stop him. I wrote him a letter begging him not to publish the\nbook.\u201d I still have that letter, by the way, that my father wrote me. \u201cIf you publish this book, it\nwill ruin you. You'll never be able to live. You\u2019ll never get a job here again. And not only that,\nit will hurt me, it will hurt your mother \u2014 who was just entering the agency \u2014 it will hurt the\nwhole family. You\u2019ve got to put \u2014 don\u2019t publish the book.\u201d My father wrote that.\nAnyway, Louis Mayer said \u2014 he said, \u201cYou know what I think we should do with him?\u201d He said,\n\u201cT think we should deport him.\u201d And he really meant it. It was really sort of fascinating, because\nI always said that Hollywood in those days was like its own country. They thought of it as their\nown country. It was like Luxembourg or something. They ran that country. And they could do\nanything they wanted. The, the district attorney, Huron Fitz was his name. He was on a weekly\nsalary. They paid him every week. And they could do anything. They could cover up any crime.\nIt never got in the paper. Clark Gable drunkenly killed somebody. He did. And no one every\nheard about it. Nothing. Because they ran everything, including the press. It was really their\ncountry. So when Mayer said that \u2014 it really, it sounds ridiculous, but in his mind, I should be\ndeported. And my father \u2014 I always said my father was much more intelligent than Louis, he\nknew so much more, but he wasn\u2019t as smart in a practical way as Louis was. And my father said,\n\u201cLouis,\u201d he said, \u201cmaybe you\u2019re right, but,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere do you think his St. Helena should\nbe?\u201d He said, \u201cMaybe we should deport him to Catalina Island.\u201d\nAnd according to my father, some of the producers laughed, but Louis didn\u2019t think that was a bit\nfunny. So it was really an odd thing, I was being deported, really, and, and uh, blacklisted, by\nboth the Hollywood moguls and the communist moguls, both. It was from both extremes. So I\nwent back to New York, and \u2014 of course, by that time, I felt the die was cast. And then, from\nthen on, which pretty much I\u2019ve done, I would stay east and be a fiction writer and so forth,\nwhich I\u2019ve tried to do.",
        "Q: (Remind us how old you were at that time \u2014 you were very young.)\nI was about 25.",
        "Q: (So wait till you\u2019re finished with the water... Tell us again that you were twenty five years\nold. I mean, that\u2019s a vulnerable time to be so berated by everyone around you.)\nYeah. That book changed my life completely. It even cost me harmony with my first love of my\nlife, my wife, Jigee, Virginia. It even cost me the marriage in a way, because Jigee wanted to\nstay west. She didn\u2019t like the east. And she thought the climate was bad for our little daughter\nVicky, and we sort of argued about that, back and forth. And the, she insisted, almost, on, on,\nthat we live out there. And I was saying, \u201cI can\u2019t live out there. It\u2019s over for me there. And in\nthe east, I\u2019m really accepted now. And I have a new contract for a book, and I\u2019m \u2014 my new life\nhas begun.\u201d\nIt really planted the seeds of our breaking up eventually. That book changed me in every\npossible way. It was really funny.",
        "Q: (Give us a sense of the chronology when it was published, and then, if you could move\nforward to the war, which obviously changed things for everybody, right?)\nI started the book in the spring of \u00b039. I finished it in the, about fall of, of 1940. It was\npublished, uh, on my birthday, uh, in 1941. And uh, and then, then I was working on my, I was\nback in Vermont. I was starting my second book. And then came Pearl Harbor, and we were\nin the war. And then I, I was anxious to get in the war, and I, uh, I applied to the Marine Corps.\nUh, and then I, I went back to Hollywood to see my daughter and Jigee, and at that time, I spoke\nto the, John Ford, the famous movie director. Ford was forming this outfit, the \u2014 called the Navy\nOSS Photographic Unit that would work with the, in the OSS with, with photographic in-\nintelligence. And because of my book\u2019s success, uh, Ford asked, Ford asked me, he said he\nwould like me to be in that unit. So that\u2019s what happened. I then applied, with his\nrecommendation. And that took about six months before I was approved.\nAnd in the meantime, I went down to Mexico and waited in Mexico and wrote screenplays to\nsupport myself, wrote screenplays down there, for Mexican producers.\nAnd then finally I was, I got my Navy commission and went to Washington to report to John\nFord. And that was the beginning of my war experience. I was in, in for about four years,\nbecause after the war, I was with the Nuremberg Trial. It seems to me, I think it was from spring\nof \u201842 to spring of *46 before I got, before I got out, because the last six or seven months was\nspent preparing a film for the Nuremberg, the photographic evidence for the trial.",
        "Q: (Tell us a bit more about John Ford\u2019s role. So you went into the Navy, because he was in the\nNavy, and he already was forming this unit.)\nYes. Exactly.",
        "Q: (But was it solely Navy personnel?)",
        "Q: (Tell us about John Ford and your story about his erratic responses to you in terms of\nrequiring Navy behavior.)\nJohn Ford, of course he was a genius, but he had a, I think he had a kind of sadistic trait. Because\nwhen I came in to report \u2014 I\u2019d known him in Hollywood, and I was still thinking of him as a\nmovie director and me as a young writer. So I walked in and said, \u201cHi Jack, I\u2019m here, like, what\ndo you want me to do?\u201d It was sort of like that. And Ford was now a Navy Commander, and he\nsaid, \u201cEnsign Schulberg, that\u2019s no way to report to your commander. Come to attention and\nsalute and make an official report.\u201d And so on. I thought the guy was crazy, but I said, \u201cEnsign\nSchulberg reporting for duty, Sir.\u201d And he\u2019s said, \u201cThat\u2019s more like it.\u201d So he\u2019s like a standard\nstiff-necked Navy commander. It was so typical Ford, so I say, OK, if that\u2019s what he wants, I'll\ndo it. I don\u2019t care.\nSo the next time I come into his office I give him a sal...and say, \u201cEnsign Schulberg reporting\nfor duty, Sir.\u201d John Ford says to me, \u201cOh, for Christ\u2019s sake, Budd, you don\u2019t have to go through\nall that. Sit down. Let\u2019s talk.\u201d Like now he\u2019s just a movie director again. That\u2019s the way he\nwas. He loved to keep people off balance. That was a big thing with Ford, to keep them off\nbalance. Whatever you thought he was going to say, he\u2019d say something different.\nBut he took glee in, and he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to send you to Fort Schuyler, and they\u2019 Il really\nknock some Navy discipline into you.\u201d He said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to find it very tough.\u201d He\ncouldn\u2019t wait for me to suffer there, at Fort Schuyler. And so I went to Schuyler \u2014 I didn\u2019t mind\nit really, I found it rather interesting. Tough, but \u2014 and we\u2019d run around the Fort at 6 o\u2019clock in\nthe morning and go all through this stuff, and so it was sort of interesting.\nAnd one really funny thing happened there.\nThere were two little ensigns from the South. One was named Watts and the other was named\nFurr. One came from Mississippi and the other from Georgia. And they would always stare at\nme. I\u2019d be doing something and they\u2019d look up and they were staring at me.\nAnd one night after mess, I came back to my bunk, and they came over, and they said, \u201cExcuse\nme, Schulberg, would you mind if we talk to you?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, no.\u201d So they sat down",
        "Q: (How are we doing on tape time? Time? OK)",
        "Q: (Was this in 1943? \u00b0447)\nYes, I'd say this was \u201843, \u201844, yes, as we moved through Belgium and into Germany.\nAnd then they used writers in a very creative way. They had writers like me work with, on the\nteam that would drop, drop agents behind the line. And each agent had about, a team of about\neight that took care of them. They all had different assignments. One would just \u2014 took care of\nhis general welfare. And, and one was involved in the aviation problems, when he could be\ndropped, the weather, and where, and stuff like that. And I as a writer would work on their cover\nstory, which was very much like writing a story. It was exactly like writing a character in\nfiction, because you would find out what they really did, and then just adjust it to what they\nwould say when they got, if they were interrogated. And so that was really interesting.\nRight before the end of the war, we had one, one guy who was a Danish agent. I was just\namazed at the, at the crazy courage of these people. And he\u2019d become quite famous. He had\nbeen actually dropped in Berlin or something, or got to Berlin. He went to the Adlon Hotel, and\nbecame a big pal of some big SS general. He was posing as a, as a neutral salesman of some\nkind \u2014 I forget what the hell they thought he was selling \u2014 but he became a pal and drinking\nbuddy, and so -.\nNow it was quite near the end of the war, and his main worry was that the war might end before\nhe could do 50 drops. He really was worried that the war would be over. He couldn\u2019t wait to get\nhis fiftieth in. And, but three days before, three or four days before the end of the war, back he\nwent again. I asked him, it\u2019s against regulations really, because everything is so secret. But if he\never survived, if he ever came to the States, I\u2019d love to know what happened to him. Because it",
        "Q: (So you had intelligence training, also \u2014 not just naval training, but intelligence training?)\nThat\u2019s right, so they sent me to that school; it\u2019s the same place where the CIA is now. Yeah, that\nwas interesting. They sent me to a school. There were a hundred or so agents, at agent school.\nWe were there about a couple of months, and each one had to make up a false identity, as to who\nthey were and what they did. And they just went, funny things \u2014\nI said I was a sports writer. You had to of course choose something that you could talk about, or\nbe questioned about, that they didn\u2019t know enough about, to pass. So I said I was a sports writer.\nI didn\u2019t say Los Angeles, but close to Los Angeles, like Alta \u2014_,_ that I knew enough about.\nSometimes at three o\u2019clock in the morning, they would wake you up and shake you and say,\n\u2018\u201cWhat\u2019s your name? What do you do?\u201d \u2014 kind of like that, to try and catch you. And\nfascinating, too, every Saturday night there was a long drinking session. They would all be at a\nlong table, and they had every kind of booze on the table, and they would encourage people to\ndrink. And they would see who fell apart in drinking, and who didn\u2019t. And they would weed\nthem out like that.",
        "Q: (Were you good at that?)\nYeah, I was. Yeah, I had had quite a bit of training in it by then. Yes, I was.\nYes, I passed the whole thing.",
        "Q: (Better at drinking than navigation. They have to change tapes, so we can take a little break.\nDid I hear you right?)\nSo I came back from that....\nEND of Tape 1",
        "Q: (Why don\u2019t you tell me how Stuart was brought into the unit and when that was?)\nWell, Stuart joined the Marine Corps. And after his Marine training \u2014 the same tough stuff \u2014\neven tougher maybe that he went through \u2014 he was assigned to a film unit, a film unit in the\nMarine Corps. Meantime, I heard that we\u2019d a slot open in our outfit. Someone had dropped out.\nI forget what happened to him. Anyway, I then recommended to Ray Kellogg that we get Stuart,\nI said he was really very, very able. And so they did suggest to Stuart that he apply, and Ford\napproved it, and so forth. And so Stuart came over, and from that time worked with us. And\nthat\u2019s how we both happened to be, at the end of the war, involved in the Nuremberg Trial\npreparation.",
        "Q: (Just a little background: Did you work at all with the Signal Corps? Did you have any\nconnection or cooperation with the Signal Corps units, and with George Stevens\u2019 unit?)\nNo, we had no connection whatsoever with the Signal Corps. It drives me a little crazy, because\nit will never get straightened out, I don\u2019t think. Somehow on the Internet it says that George\nStevens worked on the Nuremberg film. And I get questions many times: How was it to work\nwith George Stevens? And he seems inextricably bound up in our project. I didn\u2019t even know,\nknow George Stevens. I know his son quite well, but I don\u2019t think I even ever met George\nStevens. And he had nothing whatsoever to do with our project. Nothing.\nWhat he did, and where it got mixed up is that, apparently Stevens, at the end of the war got a\nfilm unit and went around photographing the concentration camps, and made several films that\nwere, I think, quite effective. But of course that was not involved at all in the Nuremberg Trial.\nFor one thing, as I mentioned last night, we could only use film that the Germans themselves had\nshot and prepared, so anything that George Stevens did with our army people would not be\nadmissible evidence. But we never saw George Stevens. And I don\u2019t think Ill ever be able to\ndisconnect it. It comes up constantly. It\u2019s right there, if you find it\u2014 George Stevens worked on\nthis.\nIt\u2019s one of the many, many troubles with the Internet, that\u2019s really a big negative for me. I get\nasked questions about Hollywood, about, did I get back to Hollywood work because I testified to\nthe committee after the war, and I didn\u2019t go anywhere near Hollywood. I still felt outlawed,\nunderstand. And I lived in, in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and just wrote books.\nBut all that misinformation is set in there, and it will be there forever.",
        "Q: (I agree.)\nAnd I\u2019m sure there\u2019Il be biographies written full of misinformation.",
        "Q: (OK, So George Stevens had nothing to do with The Nazi Plan.)",
        "Q: (And did George Stevens and his group have anything to do with John Ford and his unit?)\nNothing. Zero. Nothing. They were two completely separate \u2014 I think that Stevens apparently\ndid some very good work, but it had nothing to do with John Ford\u2019s OSS unit. Nothing.",
        "Q: (OK. Why don\u2019t you tell us, give us some detail about how it came about, your suggestion\nabout photographic evidence, and when you first came to Nuremberg, too, if you can go on to\nthat.)\nAt the end of the war, after the war was, was over, General Bill Donovan was very interested 1n,\nwas one of the first, I think, to be strongly in favor of an international tribunal to try the major\nwar criminals. And he, he called a meeting \u2014\nI need some water, too, cause my mouth gets dry from talking so much. (Drinks)\nHe called a meeting of, of all the various OSS departments to discuss how the OSS could\ncontribute to the building of an international trial. And again, Ray Kellogg, maybe Ford, but I\nworked much more closely with Kellogg than I did with Ford \u2014 Ford was over Kellogg, and Ford\nmight make suggestions to Ray, Ray Kellogg, but Kellogg was my immediate superior. So I\nguess Ray just chose me to go to the meeting, and so I did, and there was Bill Donovan talking\nabout the importance of the impending trial. And he felt that the OSS was logically set up to\nmake a major contribution to their intelligence work and all the rest of it. I got the feeling at the\nmeeting that, that I think Donovan saw himself as the main, would be the main U.S. prosecutor.\nI think he really hoped to have the job that eventually went to Justice Robert Jackson.\nAnyway, each one spoke up about what they could do, and naturally, coming from the Film OSS\nPhotographic \u2014 it was only logical to say that maybe there was photographic evidence that we\ncould use at, at a trial.\nAs aresult of that meeting, Kellogg then put me in, in charge of a photographic team that would\nlook, search for and gather and edit and present the photographic evidence at the trial. And so, so\nI ... Then I went back to Berlin, and, where, where the OSS was headquartered, and, and \u2014 with\nmy brother Stuart, to be in charge of the still photographic evidence. So, he set up in, I think in\nWiesbaden. And Stuart got the, the cooperation of Hans Hoffmann, who was Hitler\u2019s official\nphotographer. And Hoffmann, who \u2014 oddly enough, his son in law was Baldur, Baldur von\nSchirach, the, who was on trial, the head of the Hitlerjugend. It was really ironic because in a\nsense the father in law was helping to hang his son in law.\nBut as I point out \u2014 with all the Germans that we worked with they, once we won, they would do\nanything we wanted, that they were completely submissive, really, and cooperative, almost to a\nslavish point. I mean, I was sort of disgusted with it, ina way. We would say that the \u2014 feeling\nanti-German at that time, because we did feel that the country really overwhelmingly had\nsupported Hitler. You see those crowds of millions and millions of people would turn out for",
        "Q: (Was Hoffmann that cooperative too?)\nHoffmann was totally cooperative with Stuart and turned over his entire treasure trove of\nphotographs to Stuart. Went over with his staff, he had his staff down there, the way I had up in\nBerlin. (Coughing) (Drinks water)",
        "Q: (So, Budd, when did you first go to Nuremberg, to the city? And what did you find when you\nwere there\u2019)\nWhat did I find there, did you say?",
        "Q: (When did you first get to Nuremberg?)\nVery soon after we, after we set up headquarters in Berlin, in the Wannsee, very fancy, plush \u2014 it\nwas like the Beverly Hills of Berlin, I guess, in a way, or even Bellaire. And at that time, I, I uh,\nafter we set up shop there, then because, I went down to Nuremberg to talk with the Jackson\nlegal staff to get the particulars of the indictments and find out, find out specifically what, what\nphotographic, how the photographic evidence would, would dovetail with their actual\nindictments. And uh from the point on we worked very closely.\nThere was a lieutenant Jim Donovan who served as a liaison between the Jackson staff \u2014 he was\non Jackson\u2019s staff, well we all were really, we were officially on Jackson\u2019s staff too \u2014 would\nwork out the, the working arrangement between the indictments and what we could do to back\nup those indictments photographically.\nAnd we worked with Ben Kaplan, whom I still see from time to time on the Vineyard \u2014 a very\ndistinguished lawyer and I think a judge later, but we would work closely with them, and\nsometimes I was down there frequently. I might fly down for a few hours and fly back, and so I\nwas in Nuremberg a lot, every, maybe a couple of times a week even, during that period when\nwe were preparing the film.",
        "Q: (What was the city like? What was the atmosphere like\u2019)\nWell, the city was aruin. It was really a wreck. And the uh, and the Germans seemed very\nbeaten down and sort of depressed, and uh, and eager to please, really, eager to please you, and\nsort of scared of you, too. It was very much a sense of the conquered and the conquerors. But it\nwas shocking to see those cities. I saw Cologne, Berlin itself was, Jesus \u2014 I flew over Berlin in a\nsmall plane, and it looked like a honeycomb. There was hardly a roof left in all of this enormous",
        "Q: (Did you have any reflections on the impact of Allied bombing and whether it was justified?)\nWell, that\u2019s a tough question, because really you might say on both sides, it really doesn\u2019t\nseemed justified to uh bomb civilians, you know, on one side or the other, just as the Nazis were\ndoing in London, and we were doing in Dresden and everywhere else. We did destroy those\ncities. At the time, I felt that, at that time I felt that we had to do it, because we, apparently that\nwas, they thought, the only way to win the war. And God knows we had to win the war if we\nwanted to survive. At the time, at the same time, it was really horrendous to see what we had\ndone, I mean to people, and oh God, the wreckage of tt.",
        "Q: (I\u2019m sorry, go ahead.)\nWhen I saw Berlin, I, my feeling was that it would take fifty years or more to ever get it back\ntogether. I was amazed at how quickly they restored those cities. I was amazed at the resilience\nof people to rebuild them. I thought it would take all through the 20\" century.",
        "Q: (When did you first have real knowledge about what had been going on in the concentration\ncamps?)\nUm, trying to remember \u2014 there \u2014 Even before the war, there had been word, word had gotten out\nthat there were concentration camps, uh, in, in 19... let\u2019s see, what\u2019s it in, yeah, in 1938. Joe,\nJoe Louis\u2019s uh, when\u2014 it was a, famous story that, there was, you know, that was \u2014 Braddock\u2019s\nmanager was Jewish, and, and Goebbels was working very hard to set up a championship fight\nbetween Braddock the champion and Max Schmeling in Germany. And Joe Gould, the manager\n\u2014 I went to see him in the hospital shortly before he died. And whether he made it up or not, Joe\nGould told me that, that he got a phone call from Schmeling in Germany, and Max was dying to\nset up this rematch with Louis. And, so he called. Joe Gould was actually at, at Stillman\u2019s Gym\nwhen he got the call. And Schmeling said, \u201cJoe, I\u2019m here with, with, I\u2019m here with Mr.\nGoebbels in his office, and he would like to talk to you.\u201d And so there was Goebbels in Berlin\ntalking to this little Jewish guy in Stillman\u2019s Gym. And of course now, it sounds made up, but\nwhat, what Joe Gould told me that day in the hospital was that, he said, Goebbels said, \u201cWe\u2019re\nvery anxious to arrange a championship match between your fighter and our fighter, in Berlin,\nand we, and we want to know what your conditions are.\u201d And Gould said, \u201cWell first, I want\n500,000 dollars in a New York bank before we leave.\u201d And he said that Goebbels said, \u201cWell,\nthat\u2019s no problem.\u201d\nAnd he said, \u201cAnd also, we want, one judge must be American, and we want an English referee.\u201d\nAnd he said, \u201cWell, just a minute, I'll have to ask Mr. Schmeling.\u201d Then he came back he said,\n\u201cMr Schmeling says that\u2019s OK, too.\u201d And then he said, \u201cAnd we want ten first class passages,\nand, and first class accommodation for ten people in your best hotel,\u201d and so on. And he said,\n\u201cAlright that'll be alright. Is there any other condition?\u201d",
        "Q: (And that was for the OSS?)\nPardon me?",

        "Q: ( -- and so fast, so fast. So talk to me about what they wanted from you, how you could do it\nin the time there was. Tell us about that.)\nThey were building a case that the Nazis and Hitler had conspired almost from the beginning,\nalmost from 1933 on, to breach the Treaty of Versailles and to find ways to get around it. And\nso they had these, many different steps of the indictment \u2014 of crimes against humanity, and, and\ncrimes against the existing peace of the world, and so forth. There was a whole series of them.\nAnd for each one I would sit down with Donovan, sometimes with Ray Kellogg in attendance\nalso \u2014 Ray served as sort of an intermediary between Donovan and me \u2014 and Donovan would\nspell out, out for us what the indictments were, show us, in fact I would read them, and then ask\nus, \u201cHow do you think that you see film building or buttressing the case that we\u2019re making?\u201d So,\nso I would go away with that information and then, then look for film that would answer his, his,\nwhat he was looking for. So...",
        "Q: (Where did you look first?)\nStupidly, we, as a shortcut, because we were very, very worried about time \u2014 at that time it was\nlike August, and the trial was supposed to open on the 15\" of September. We had no time. So\nwe got, so as a Shortcut, we thought we\u2019d look at all the Fox Movietone footage, because actually\nthat was produced, had come from Germany, and so we got all of that, and it, I thought it didn\u2019t\nanswer all, all the things he was asking for, but some of them. And so I, I went down with a list.\nAnd at that point Donovan, Jim Donovan said, \u201cWell, Budd, that\u2019s film that was released in the\nUnited States. Even though the source was German, we can\u2019t use anything that was at the\ninfluence, say, of Fox Movietonews, because the defense attorneys would jump in and say \u2018That,",
        "Q: (Do you want to clear your throat? And then I\u2019d like to have you go back and tell us \u2014 This\nwas at the Babelsberg studio, right? Mention where Avenerius was taking you. And also, talk\nabout, you were presumably working on 35mm film, which is very unwieldy. Let\u2019s go back into\nthat, so you can tell us where, and some of those things about the film conditions, and how you\ncould handle film, both viewing it, copying it, all of that. So, go ahead.)\nWell, we got so much of this film from him, as I mentioned last night, and after a few days of\nthis, he suddenly stopped and suddenly became a little more stiff. Apparently his colonel had\nobjected to his giving us so much film, even though the Soviet Union was one of the four parties\nrepresented in the prosecution. But the colonel stopped it. And then, I won\u2019t go into so much\ndetail, but then we had to win over the colonel, which we did with this lavish party that we threw\nfor him, an all night into the dawn party. When the colonel got drunk enough and softened up,",
        "Q: (So what you\u2019re saying really suggests that even though there was officially a prohibition on\nfilming any of these kinds of activities, these guys were telling you that it was filmed.)\nOh yes.",
        "Q: (Presumably this was film that was kept highly secret, right?)\nYes, Yes",
        "Q: (And not something that went through the Propaganda Ministry. )\nNo.",
        "Q: (Well that\u2019s one question. And the other part is \u2014 these acres of films, was it your feeling that\nsome of that was official German film, like the Goebbels empire, or that these were all SS film\nlocations?)\nI don\u2019t know if they all were, because we really couldn\u2019t, we were not able to examine them the\nway that we would have wished to, but I got the feeling that these were more SS films that they\nwere hiding, rather than the Goebbels propaganda films. But there might have been some of\nboth. I really don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know the answer.",
        "Q: (But tell us again where the German newsreel material was that you found.)\nWell, that we found mostly in the Babelsberg, where, that Avenerius was in charge of. Most of\nthat film came from there that they had \u2014 all of the newsreel film that had been shot all, all\nthrough the war, from the early days.",
        "Q: (Do you remember where you found the film of the trial of the bomb plotters?)\nYes, I do. It, it was, I really, practically found that myself, with a couple of people with me. We\n\u2014 It was a film lab, and in the basement we found about twenty, twenty reels of film, and so I just\ntook it with us and went back and started to run it. We didn\u2019t know what was in it, and there was\nthe whole God damned trial of the plotters.\nI was rather surprised, seeing the film did, The Nazi Plan, which had only a snippet of the trial,\nthat I can\u2019t remember why that was chosen, because there were far more shocking scenes than\nthat one that we showed, that was not as abusive as some. I don\u2019t know why that one...\nFor some reason, Donovan, at first he didn\u2019t want to use any of the film. He thought that crimes\nagainst their own people would not be as germane. I didn\u2019t really understand it, because after all\nwe were using film of the anti-Jewish riots and so forth, which was against their own people. I\nnever really agreed with him. I don\u2019t know what his reticence was about that.",
        "Q: (Well, I wonder if 1t had anything to do with the fact that the people on trial for trying to kill\nHitler were not the defendants in the dock at Nuremberg. This was a really opposite polarity.)\nWell, that\u2019s true. And Judge Freisler was not \u2014 God he was a horrible, but it\u2019s true he was not on\ntrial.",
        "Q: (I think he was killed in an Allied bombing raid, actually, while he was in a courtroom.)\nFreisler, I think he was. I think he was killed. Thank God, he was a, God what a horrible....",
        "Q: (I share your, your passionate horror for that trial footage. I know it very well.)\nThat trial was something. Then also... I don\u2019t think, I don\u2019t think I spoke about it last night, but\nthe, our, our SS editors told us that the, uh, the uh, July 20\" people, in being convicted, they",
        "Q: (Filmed?)\nFilmed, I mean, yes, filmed. And the idea was that they would show that to every, in every\ndiplomatic center, show it to all the diplomats, Nazi diplomats and High Command people, as a\nway of frightening them against doing something like that again. What we heard was that it, it\nsort of backfired. It was so horrifying that they were afraid it would turn more people against the\nregime and they stopped circulating it.\nAnd of course we were dying to get hold of that film. We were told that someone had actually\nsold it to someone in, in Switzerland, and so I went to Switzerland, went to Bern and to Basel,\ntrying to find out if I could get the film. And a guy, a guy came to my hotel and said that he had\nthe film, and, and he asked me how much I would pay for it. And I forget what I said \u2014 I had\nbeen told, I think, that we could go up to 5000. I think I started at 2500. And he said, he\nwouldn\u2019t even think of it for 2500, and then we got up to 5000. And he came back and said,\n\u201cI\u2019ve got other people interested also, in it and I think they might be willing to pay more than\n5000.\u201d And then I only had permission for five, so I had to call Ray Kellogg and find out how\nmuch more we could pay than 5000. And it took time and red tape, and meanwhile this little guy\ncame back. I waited there in the hotel, and he came back and looked at me, and I think he asked\nsome exorbitant amount like 10,000. I said, well, I don\u2019t have that yet. And he said, \u201cWell, I\nhave someone who\u2019s willing to pay and I\u2019ve decided not to come back any more, and I\u2019m going\nto sell it to him.\u201d And apparently they did.\nApparently it was Nazi people in Spain, where a great many had been able to reach and survive,\nand they bought it. And I went back empty-handed. I was very disappointed I didn\u2019t get the\nfilm. If they\u2019d given me enough money, if they had said 20,000... It was almost, it was like\nbuying a Hollywood story, but \u2014 going back to my boss to ask how much money can I give him.",
        "Q: (Was he a German? Was this little man a German?)\nNo, I thought he was Swiss. I thought he was Swiss and not German.",
        "Q: (You know, everyone\u2019s still looking for that film \u2014 still looking for it.)\nThese two people, they had seen it. And they described that film to me, said it was the most\nhorrifying thing because the people lived for some time. And it was really gruesome. But it\u2019s\nnever been seen, huh?",
        "Q: (So who were the people who described \u2014 )\nIt\u2019s way down in Argentina, maybe, or somewhere, that film.",
        "Q: (But not in Russia, huh? You see a lot of speculation is that it got to Russia.)",
        "Q: (No, and I think the Russians would have exposed it if they had it.)",
        "Q: (So who told you about actually seeing the film?)\nI\u2019m trying to think \u2014 I\u2019m trying to remember. Curt von Molo told me that he had not seen the\nfilm, but that someone had, that he knew had seen the film and told him about it. But he himself\nhad not actually worked on that film. In fact, that there wasn\u2019t anything to edit. Apparently they\njust photographed it.",
        "Q: (So when you had to choose material for the Nazi Plan, I assume you were trying to show the\ndefendants, in action, among other things. How did you decide what to keep and what to throw\nout?)\nWell, it was awfully tough, because we had such an embarrassment of riches. We had so God\ndamn much material. What I would do is more or less make a list of what we had and then go\ndown check it out with Jim Donovan. And he would say \u2018Yes\u2019 to that \u2014 specifically, things like\nthe self-incriminating statements, like, like Goering, Goering reading the racist laws. So he said\n\u2014 In fact, watching the film yesterday, for the ordinary public, it\u2019s a shame we can\u2019t subtitle it,\nbecause Goering was saying something about the Jews, like that we need to sweep Germany\nclean with a steel broom, things like that, that were incriminating, so many things they were\nsaying that were definitely in breach of international law.\nSo it was just a question really of, of very difficult selection and, and elimination. I had told Jim\nDonovan that we could run, I thought we could, at one point I could see running all day from 9 to\n5, and we could run all day.\nAnd he said, well obviously, we can\u2019t do that. And we finally worked it down. Jim Donovan\nsuggested four hours. And so we went back and reviewed and tried to pick the high spots of the\nindictment that our film would relate to, but it, the... We had four film editors and they literally\nworked, I would say, twenty hours a day, I mean, they worked until two and three in the\nmorning, and started again at 7, they just worked around the clock. And that film unit had so\ndamn much film \u2014",
        "Q: (Tell us more about the editors and particularly I\u2019m interested in Joe Zigman since he also\nworked on the other film.)\nWe had three very good Hollywood film editors: Robert Parrish [Drinks] and Joe Zigman, and\nBob Webb. And then we had one Russian girl \u2014 I swear to God, I don\u2019t remember how she got\nassigned to us. She was very helpful. She was a very small Russian newsreel editor. I think her\nname was (Shostopol) or something.\nAnd so the four of them would work around the clock, looking at this film and then trying to\nfollow a sort of a rough outline that I would make. Let\u2019s see now, we start in 1930 and we show\nhighlights before Hitler comes in, and then, we sort of outlined it step by step, and then",
        "Q: (And were they handling original films, or did you make work copies? How did they do\nthat?)\nLet\u2019s see, at first we just looked at the original film, and then as we started making our\nselections, we would, then we would make copies of the footage that they were selecting.",
        "Q: (And the bosses in Nuremberg \u2014 describe again how, how they wanted to review the film\nwork.)\nWell, for one thing, they would say something, that they needed a photograph or something. The\nnext day, they\u2019d be calling and saying, \u201cWell, where is it? Bring it down.\u201d We would try to\nexplain, that first we have to select, we have to edit it, we have to \u2014 they never understood it.\nThey never understood. And General Donovan was very impatient. He had no patience with us\nat all, none at all. Because he would promise things on a high level that couldn\u2019t be fulfilled\ndown where we were, and that was the trouble. And he would be embarrassed, \u201cWell, where is\nit?\u201d So that, uh....\nDonovan finally pulled, he himself pulled out of the trial, as you know. His, his nose was out of\njoint because he was jealous of Justice Jackson, and he didn\u2019t want to play second fiddle to\nJackson, really and so, eventually he withdrew completely, but that didn\u2019t stop us, but we were\nleft in place without Donovan, to finish the work that we\u2019d been asked to do.",
        "Q: (So when you were working that quickly, and you got a little more time because the trial was\npostponed \u2014)\nThank God. When they said September 15\" \u2014 we, we debated whether to go down and admit, I\ndon\u2019t think that there couldn\u2019t be any photographic evidence. You'll have to\u2014 Even though\nJackson in his opening day remarks mentioned that, I think, it was historic, it was the first time\never that there would be \u2014 it was not only the first international trial, but the first trial I believe\nthat ever used photographic, film photographic evidence that way. And we were almost ready to\nsay we can\u2019t do it. And then word came, it\u2019s been postponed until October 15\". And then we\nhad a month\u2019s leave. But as we got toward October 15\" we weren\u2019t ready either. We still had\nlike a month\u2019s work, even killing ourselves with the work.\nAnd then thank God came this second postponement to November. And that really saved us,\nbecause without that, there wouldn\u2019t have been any Nazi Plan film in the courtroom.",
        "Q: (And when it was shown, I\u2019m imagining \u2014 was it a film with tape joins, or had you made a\nprint from, from the assembled material?)\nYes, we \u2018d made a print of the condensed four hour version, yeah, yes, but as noted Ray Kellogg\nhad to \u2014 he testified as to the authenticity of the film, that it was all German film and so forth,",
        "Q: (Did you ever consider whether you had too many Nazi Party rallies\u2019)\nI was worried about that. I was worried about the party rallies, but at the same time, the party\nrallies included two valuable things. One was what they actually said at those rallies, which as it\nmoved on, became more and more inflammatory as they got more and more powerful, and as the\nwestern democracies surrendered to them, and so on. They became more and more aggressive.\nSo there was that sense of, of growing confidence in their aggression that you can\u2019t trace.\nAnd also, there were people whose very presence indicted them. People would say that we, like\nSpeer was one, and Schacht was another \u2014 and a number of people \u2014 and Keitel and Jodl \u2014 but\npeople who said they were just German officials but not necessarily Nazi Party related. And\nshowing them with their Nazi badges and things was, was very helpful in indicting them. And,\nand Riefenstahl was helpful in identifying various people.",

No, I don\u2019t think they were overjoyed. I think they\nwere worried. They looked worried really. They looked very, they were very concerned.\nGoering 1s, 1s interesting. Goering was by far the smartest of all the people on trial.\nI remember the day at our hotel, when the captain psychiatrist came rushing in, all excited. He\u2019d\nbeen testing the IQs of the various defendants. And he said, \u201cMy God, that Goering he acts like\na clown. He\u2019s a genius.\u201d He said, \u201cHis IQ went through the roof, he\u2019s so smart.\u201d That guy\u2019s\nname was Murphy, Captain Murphy, who strangely enough years later committed suicide also. I\ndon\u2019t remember why.\nBut Goering tended to take the whole trial very seriously, as I mentioned last night. He acted\nlike, as a defendant was who feels that he has a chance of being found not guilty. I don\u2019t know if\nhe really thought so, but that\u2019s the way he acted, and that was his demeanor most of the time in\nthe courtroom. He would take notes, and he would consult with his attorney, and so forth, and he\ntook it very seriously.\nSome just sat like, as if they were staring. Streicher had a funny look on his face. And the two\nmilitary people, Keitel of the Army and Adm. Jodl [sic] very clearly, very clearly were saying,\nwere disassociating, their attitude was, we shouldn\u2019t be here, and we have nothing to do with\nthis. And they would sort of turn away, and act rather haughty, like that. They were all kind of\ndifferent.",

I had to take it down and screen it for\nJackson\u2019s staff to make sure it was all germane, and, and I was very worried about that too \u2014 that\nthey might say \u201cNo you can\u2019t\u201d \u2014 and they were very haughty, I mean they, their attitude toward\nus was sort of, \u201cWho needs them?\u201d I mean, \u201cThey\u2019re just a pain in the ass, sort of a nuisance,\u201d I\nfelt, and we don\u2019t really, they were such \u2014 not Donovan, but Ben Kaplan and the others.",

And so Stuart with Hoffmann got access to, I guess, as much\nstill photographs as I had film up in Berlin. He and the separate staff that he had went through",
        "Q: (And they were entered into evidence separately...)\nYeah, that\u2019s right. They were entered separately",
        "Q: (Were you and Stuart together when you went through OSS training?)\nNo, no we weren\u2019t at all, because my training preceded Stuart\u2019s, as I\u2019d been in for almost a year,\nI think, before Stuart was transferred to the Marine Corps. And I\u2019m not sure that...see, I\u2019m not\nsure that Stuart went through that, what you might call spy school. I don\u2019t remember that he did.",
        "Q: (Were you in Washington together?)\nOh yes, it was at the south Agriculture Building. That\u2019s where I mentioned before. It was\ntreated like a ship. It was referred to as a ship. And we would \u201cgo ashore\u201d and all this nonsense.",
        "Q: (You know it\u2019s right across the street from the Holocaust Museum?)\nI'll be damned. No, I didn\u2019t know that. That\u2019s where we were every day. That\u2019s really ironic.",
        "Q: (Could you tell us a little more about the SS editors? Von Molo & Rothe \u2014 what were their\nsympathies? What were their attitudes to what the Nazis had done?)\nWell, Walter Rothe was, had been a Fox Movietone film editor, he was a newsreel editor.\nCurt von Molo had been a feature film, film editor. He told me that he had worked with Fritz\nLang and with some of the top German directors, and he seemed very, he seemed quite\nintelligent. And the two of them, instead of being two Nazi POWs that might have managed\nsympathy for each other, the two of them couldn\u2019t stand each other. They didn\u2019t like each other.\nAnd each, both of them told me \u2014 \u201cI was recruited into the SS film unit but I was, I didn\u2019t want\nto do it, but I had to or else.\u201d Each one said the same thing, \u201cI was really anti Nazi.\u201d Each one\nsaid about the other guy: \u201cWalter Rothe really was a Nazi. He was very sympathetic.\u201d And Rothe\nsaid the same thing about von Molo. He was anti Nazi but von Molo was pro-SS and wanted to\nget in that SS film unit. They both said that. They had no use for each other at all. I really\ndidn\u2019t know which of them was right.\nAlso, Curt von Molo told me that all through the war, while he was working for the SS, that a\nJewish film editor had been hiding in his attic, like in his house. And I took that with a grain of\nsalt, because it was a joke to us. But from the first crossing over into Germany, we didn\u2019t meet a\nGerman who didn\u2019t have a Jew in the attic. How could there be six million Jews in the\nconcentration camps, because they must have all been up in the attics. Everybody we met,\nalmost without fail, would say, \u201cI was against Hitler and I saved a Jew in my attic.\u201d It got to be a\njoke with us. And von Molo said the same thing. He had this Jewish editor, and he said it was\nvery precarious because he did work on these horrible SS films, at the same time.",
        "Q: (Did Von Molo & Rothe ever ask you about being Jewish? Did they ever bring the subject\nup?)\nNo, not that I remember \u2014 no, I don\u2019t remember them ever, no, I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t think they did.",
        "Q: (Were there family members from your mother\u2019s side who were affected by the Holocaust?)\nWell, not really directly, no. My mother was born in Latvia, and she came to the States with her\nparents when she was very, very young, like a year old \u2014 a baby being held in her mother\u2019s arms,\nand she had no memory at all of Latvia, but that\u2019s where she was born. And my father, my\nfather was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and his parents had come from Lithuania. But\nneither family was German-Jewish or, or involved in the Holocaust.",
        "Q: (But you must have still felt a personal commitment to this history)",
        "Q: (Tell us more about attending the Dachau Trial \u2014 how long were you there)?\nI was only there about a week or so. In fact, 1t was so typical there. The, the, the pattern of\ndenial was amazing. The commander\u2019s name was Wolf, and I swear to God, he looked kind of\nJewish and had the Jewish name of Wolf. And his defense was sort of like, it really was, his\ndefense was sort of like \u2014 \u201cWell, I tried to save as many as I could. Like I could have killed 35\nor 40 thousand a week but I only killed 17 thousand.\u201d It was like he saved the lives of all these\npeople. That was, that attitude went all the way down the line.\nThere was one big stupid looking guard, and he was accused of maltreating the Jewish prisoners,\nand he actually said, he said, \u201cWell, this woman, you see,\u201d he said, \u201cI was under orders, I had to\nkick her,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t kick her nearly as hard as, I was trying to kick her as little as\u201d\u2019.. It\nwas, all the way down the line that was the attitude \u2014 that they did it as little as possible to\nsurvive. I loved that thing about the kicking. They only kicked her a little bit.",
        "Q: (Was Stuart with you at all in Nuremberg, or in Berlin? Did I ask you that already?)\nIt was just a short time. It seems to me \u2014 I wonder if Sandra could confirm this \u2014 as far as I can\nremember, Stuart, I don\u2019t think he was there on the, when we showed the film. I think by that\ntime Stuart \u2014 I\u2019m quite sure had gone home. I think he had finished his work. I just remember\nhim at the beginning. But I don\u2019t remember working with Stuart all the way through.",
        "Q: (Take us a little farther along into the Pare Lorentz documentary, and that project as it\nemerged.)\nI was living out on my farm. And I got back from the war in, I think it was February of \u201946 was\nwhen I finally got released from the Navy. And I got, I bought that farm out in Bucks County.\nAnd Pare Lorentz came out to see me. Oddly enough, he was married to the girl, Elizabeth\nGraham, that I had worked with as a co-writer for Selznick. And I knew her very, very well,\nliked her. And so he came out to see me to describe the film he was planning to make on\nNuremberg, and he thought that after my Nuremberg experience, I would be the logical one to\nwrite and work with him on the film.\nAnd I told him that I had been in the war for four years. I had just gotten out and now I had a\ncontract for a novel with Random House, and they were actually paying me so much a month as\nan advance, and I was living on that, and so I had to go back and get started on my other career.\nHe then tried again, sometime afterwards. I saw him in New York, and he again urged me to\nwrite this, he was very set on doing it. And at that point, we talked about Stuart. Stuart actually\nhad done an excellent job in Nuremberg. I mean on his he was very able and very smart with\nit, and so it just seemed a logical, logical job for Stuart, which Pare then proceeded to work with\nStu.",
        "Q: (Did you follow very closely the making of the project? Were you in touch with Stuart\nmuch?)",
        "Q: (Do you remember at all hearing about this remarkable film footage that Stuart uncovered of\nthis killing?\nWell, I just remember hearing about it once \u2014 that they actually had finally found something that\nwe had hoped to find. We never really found anything that was related to the gas chambers. We\nhad hoped to. And we\u2019d been told there was such film, but we had never uncovered it, so I was\nfascinated by what Stuart did, yeah. I wish we could have shown that at the trial.",
        "Q: (I\u2019m sure you do. Who told you that there was footage of the gas chambers? Was this more\nfrom your SS editors?)\nYes, yes, they said that it, it also had been photographed, yeah.\n(Did you ever come across Walter Frentz, who had worked with Leni Riefenstahl as a\ncameraman on the Olympics film?)\nI remember his name but I don\u2019t recall talking to him. I remember his name, I guess.",
        "Q: (Because he filmed some of those things you put in The Nazi Plan, you know.)\nNo, I don\u2019t remember talking to him directly, only hearing about him.",
        "Q: (Is there anything you could tell us about the link between the fact that Stuart and Joe\nZigman worked on both The Nazi Plan and the Nuremberg documentary? Do you have any\nthoughts about that continuity between them?)\nWell, only that, I think that Stuart, in getting ready to make that film with Pare, that a very\nlogical, the most logical film editor would have been someone who worked on The Nazi Plan.\nAnd he was very friendly with Joe Zigman. And, I think Bob Parrish had gone back to\nHollywood and was building his own career right after he got out. And so I think that Joe was\nthe logical choice for, and an ideal choice for Stuart. I remember him very well too, Zigman. He\nwas an awfully good person. Yeah.",
        "Q: (Pare Lorentz seems to remember him very fondly, too.)\nYes, he was awfully appealing. When did Joe die? Do you know when? Cause I lost touch with\nhim.",
        "Q: ( haven\u2019t found out exactly.)",
        "Q: (SS editors \u2014 How did the main film editors use them? Were they used as assistant editors?\nCutting?)\nNo, I don\u2019t recall them, I don\u2019t recall them.... They were much more just advising as to what\nfilm was available. I don\u2019t think that they, I don\u2019t remember them ever actually working on a\nMoviola, editing the film.",
        "Q: (And Movieolas are what you used, right?)\nThat\u2019s what they used then, oh yes, God, yes. Hours and hours and hours at the Moviola",
        "Q: (Separate tracks for sound?)\nYes, I think there were separate tracks, yeah.",
        "Q: (For your material for The Nazi Plan, if | understand correctly, you only used original tracks\nthat were found with the films?)\nAbsolutely, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s the only thing we could do. We couldn\u2019t use anything that was\nnot the German original, and nothing else, because they thought the defense attorneys would\npounce on it. And by the way, the defense attorneys took their jobs very seriously, because it\nwas not like a routine, cut and dried. They really, they were all excellent German lawyers. And\nthey worked very diligently and would make, I mean their, they argued very hard for their\nclients; they really did.",
        "Q: (Did you have a sense that there was anxiety on the part of the prosecution, as to whether the\nfilm evidence would be accepted and valid in supporting the indictment?)\nWell, uh, only at the beginning \u2014 at the beginning, much more than later. I would say that\ngradually, they became impressed with how detailed the dovetailing of the film and the\nstatements were to what they had on paper. And so the, I think the confidence grew as, as we\nwent along, and that when they found that statements and pictures really were incriminating, they\nfelt that it would bolster their case.\nI think it was quite surprising and very enterprising of Justice Jackson, coming from the\nbackground that he did \u2014 after all, he wasn\u2019t John Ford from Hollywood \u2014 that he was as, as, as\nopen to the use of film, which was so innovative and had never been done, as he was. He was\nreally very sympathetic to its use, as long as, as long as we were diligent. Ben Kaplan who\u2019s this\nvery nice guy that I still talk to on the Vineyard. He was very, very tough, and he was rather\nsnooty about it. I mean, he was doing it because they told him, but his heart wasn\u2019t really in it, I\ndon\u2019t think. But he would put it to very tough legal tests as to whether it was just movies or it\nreally was, really was indictable evidence, which was good, really. That was useful.",
        "Q: (I believe that was the standard. Visual images could be entered as long as they were\npertinent, directly pertinent to the charge.)\nExactly, exactly, exactly. And that\u2019s what he held us to. Yeah.",
        "Q: (Well, that must have made your job really hard at the beginning, when they hadn\u2019t decided\nyet what the indictments were going to be.)\nThat\u2019s very true. At the beginning, the whole thing was so, so nebulous, that we almost had to\ntry to read their minds as to what they would be looking for. We had to decide \u2014 these non-legal\nminds of ours \u2014 what did seem to us indictable evidence. Yeah, that\u2019s right. We had pretty good\n\u2014 but I must say, looking back, that we had a pretty good sense of what was really verbal and\nvisual crime. We had some sense of tt.",
        "Q: (Do you know what was done with the original film elements when you were finished?)\nWell, I was very nervous about that, because, for one thing, on the July 20\", all that film, I had\nsomething which, there was some army colonel that was attached to us, and we found out that he\nhad taken some of that film and sold it to some American company. And I just hit the ceiling,\nbecause all this stuff was very valuable in a private profit-making way. It was all very hot film,\nyou might say. I had nightmares about how people might try to grab it and steal it and, and, and\nsell it. And this colonel in the army, I asked that, I talked to Kellogg about him and asked that he\nbe removed from us. I talked to people about \u2014 you must not \u2014everybody has to be absolutely,\ntotally honest about this, and, and scrupulous about it. We must send all of it back to the\nNational Archives, and nowhere else. And that\u2019s what I did. I sent all of the film to the National\nArchives.",

What does this short\nperiod mean to you in terms of what you did?)\nWell, I think of myself as being very lucky, really, that I just happened to be in the right place at\nthe right time and that I was very lucky they chose me for that job. They could have picked\nsomebody else, I guess. And I think that just now, looking back that long ago as some, just one\nchapter in my life. In just a short time I\u2019ve celebrated the 60\" anniversary of the Nuremberg\nTrial. And quite recently I celebrated the 40\" anniversary of the Watts Writers Workshop, that I\ngot started when, on the day the curfew was lifted on the Watts riots, or the Uprising as they\nalways called it down there.\nI think I\u2019ve been lucky that I\u2019ve been able to be at certain places at the right times.",

Yeah, I felt awfully good last month, when I went for the 40\", and, and uh saw these\nmen who are now about 60 years old, who were really uh kids some were quite almost wild kids\nwho were running the streets and, uh, it was very, it was very moving for me to, when I, I call on\nthe phone to University of California at Northridge, and, and, the voice I hear is this very deep,\nprofound-sounding voice saying, this is Professor Scott, please leave a message, and I think of\nthis Professor Scott as this w-wild kid of nineteen, he was, uh, he had been in the riots and\nthrowing Molotov cocktails and all this.\nWhen I went down there, I went down on the first day that the, that the curfew was lifted and it\nwas pretty wild still there. Some buildings were still smoking and smoldering, and there were\nlittle fires in the different open lots, and it was very, it was very, very tense, and I got this idea,\nsort of a wild idea, of starting a writer\u2019s workshop, and, and I put up a notice in a, it was kind of\na settlement house called Westminster. I just put a sign up on the bulletin board saying \u201cWriter\u2019s\nWorkshop, anybody interested sign below.\u201d And I said I would be back every Wednesday.\nIt took me a long time, for about 2 2 months nobody came. Nobody came. I just sat there. I\njust sat there, and I learned a lot about Watts. I read the local paper, The Sentinel, I talked with\nthe social workers. I went down in the, in the pool hall, sat around there, got kind of snubbed\nand glared at. I learned a lot, and my wife Geraldine was sort of taunting me about this, and she\nsaid, \u2019'd come back and she said, \u201cWell, what happened?\u201d I'd say, \u201cWell nobody showed up.\u201d",

        "Q: And, in a way, my parents told me I was maybe the only person who was a born screenwriter,\nbecause my father wrote a photoplay \u2014 it was on a suffragist subject. My mother was a\nsuffragist, and he wrote a screenplay, a three-reel called \u201cWhat Every Woman Wants\u201d \u2014 I think it\nwas called. And he got $500 for that script, which was quite a lot for those days. And he told\nme it was that 500 that he paid the doctor, Dr. Jellyhouse \u2014 I\u2019ve always loved that name \u2014 who\ndelivered me, at home, and so I really owe my birth to film writing, you might say. My father\nwas one of the earliest, very early photoplay writers, as they called them then.\nWhat else?",
        "Q: (Take us from New York to California.)\nWe left when I was about six years old. And my father had been working for Adolf Zukor,\nFamous Players, as a writer and publicist, from about the age of 18 \u2014 he started very, very young.\nBut by the time I was born, he decided he would like to branch out on his own. And become his\nown film company producer. So we went out to Hollywood very early.\nI really remember the ride on that train. It was on the old Chief, Santa Fe Chief, before the\nSuperchief, even. And I vaguely remember that, being out on the observation car, and watching\nthe country fall away behind us.\nMy father and Louis Mayer, later the famous third \u201cM\u201d at MGM -\u2014 the two of them together set\nup a very early film studio, way downtown, not in what we call Hollywood now, but down by\nthe railroad tracks, way downtown Los Angeles. It was called the Mayer-Schulberg studio. So\nboth Mayer and BP, so they both were making these early silent films. That\u2019s about it.\nMy father\u2019s big discovery was Clara Bow. He found her in a Brooklyn beauty contest, actually,\nsigned her for 50 bucks a week, and brought her to Hollywood. I called Clara sort of a pre-\nMarilyn Monroe sex queen, sex appeal queen. She was known as the, as the \u201cIt\u201d girl, from a\nfamous novel of the time, and movie called \u201cIt.\u201d And she had it. Clara really did have It. She\nreally did. She\u2019s still amazing to watch in those silent films. And that\u2019s so \u2014",
        "Q: (How early did you get interested in writing?)\nVery, very early, I\u2019d say I was about 9 or 10, very early. It was very much a part of our\nhousehold atmosphere.\nMy father had started as a writer, with the, with those early photoplays. And he, also as a kid,\nworked on the old Daily Mail and a short time on the old World \u2014 papers that we, that we dearly\nmiss. There used to be about ten daily papers, and now we\u2019re down to about two and a half. So,\nso he, he had a great interest in, aside from film, in uh writing.\nAnd my mother was a frustrated librarian. And she set up a very big library, thousands of books,\nall set up like a regular library, all numbered like a library, a real library.\nMy father used to \u2014 Sunday morning was a ritual. He would read from the classics, aloud to us,\nSunday mornings until brunch, from about 9:30 or so. It\u2019s amazing what we read. We read\nthrough Dickens and Melville and Galsworthy, and we, how we, Sunday after Sunday for years\nand years, we heard that. So writing was very much part of our life. So I started when I was\nabout 9 or 10, started to write little stories, very much encouraged by my parents. So by the time\nI went to high school, I just thought of myself as a writer, as if it was already my profession.\nAnd it all went \u2014 it fell in place very naturally. I edited the high school \u2014 Los Angeles High\nSchool daily paper. We had a daily paper. I laugh because these days, my kids at Westhampton\nHigh School couldn\u2019t get out a monthly paper, and the thought of a daily paper, they couldn\u2019t\nimagine putting it out every day. But we did.\nSo anyway, that\u2019s why, so we breathed that atmosphere.\nMy sister Sonya wrote a very good novel when she was about 19, that Scribners published,\nentitled, They Cried a Little. Sonya said that in our house, where in other homes they might have\na piano and people might sit down \u2014 Sonya said, in our house, we had a typewriter, and as we\npassed we might type out a little jingle or something or a little story, and we all, Sonya and\nStuart, Stuart wrote very well, too.",

        "Q: (Were you and your siblings very competitive?)\nNot really. I was so much the elder of the three. And with my father and my mother divorcing\nwhen I was a teenager, 17 or 18, and Sonya and Stuart younger, uh, I was very worried about\nthem. I sort of uh, took on my father\u2019s failed responsibilities. I was worrying about their school\nand how they would react to a divorce, and all of that. So I wouldn\u2019t say we were very\ncompetitive, no.",
        "Q: (You were born just at the time that the First World War started. Do you have any memories\nof the First World War\u2019)\nIt\u2019s funny, I do have. One memory was being on a train going west, this was in 1918. It\u2019s\nalmost the first memory I have, being on a train. And I was about four years old. And, and my\nfather\u2019s partner, Harry Abrams, his daughter was about eight, and the two of us were in a bunk\ntogether. And we stopped in a station, and a train full of soldiers was just opposite the platform.\nAnd I remember looking at them and they were sort of jeering and making sort of lewd remarks\nabout, I don\u2019t know what they were saying, but I remember that moment.\nAnd I remember being with my mother ona _ as the soldiers were, had just come back from\nWorld War One and were marching down 5th Avenue, and I\u2019ve got just a glimpse of a memory\nof that. It\u2019s almost my earliest memories of World War One. I also remember collecting silver\ntinfoil, balls of it that somehow were being given for the war effort. I don\u2019t know exactly how\nthey used it, but those are the, those are about the only ways I relate to World War One.",

Why don\u2019t you tell us about that period and give us a sense of Hollywood when the war\nstarted.).\nWell, 19 \u2014, let\u2019s see. When I got out of college in 1936, David Selznick, who had been my\nfather\u2019s assistant, had now set up his own studio, and was planning independent films, one of\nwhich of course became Gone with the Wind, and the first A Star is Born \u2014 which was the daddy\nof all those later Star is Borns.",

The funny thing is, while the, while the communists were denouncing me, Sam Goldwyn\nfired me. He was just ina rage. When I came in, he screamed at me. It was almost like that\nJudge Freisler. And he screamed at me. \u201cYou\u2019re a traitor! You\u2019re a traitor!\u201d Like that, he got\npurple, he was so mad. \u201cHow could you write that terrible book?!\u201d he screamed at me.\nAnd then, at the Motion Picture Producers Association meeting, that \u2014 my father of course was a\nmember and attended, and Louis B Mayer, his old partner, was now an enemy of my father. He\ntook off the same way, and he said, \u201cB.P. I blame you for this. You should have stopped him.\nIt\u2019s your fault.\u201d He was yelling, too. You have no idea how outraged they were about this thing.\nMy father said, \u201cLouis, I did try to stop him. I wrote him a letter begging him not to publish the\nbook.\u201d I still have that letter, by the way, that my father wrote me. \u201cIf you publish this book, it\nwill ruin you. You'll never be able to live. You\u2019ll never get a job here again. And not only that,\nit will hurt me, it will hurt your mother \u2014 who was just entering the agency \u2014 it will hurt the\nwhole family. You\u2019ve got to put \u2014 don\u2019t publish the book.\u201d My father wrote that.\nAnyway, Louis Mayer said \u2014 he said, \u201cYou know what I think we should do with him?\u201d He said,\n\u201cT think we should deport him.\u201d And he really meant it. It was really sort of fascinating, because\nI always said that Hollywood in those days was like its own country. They thought of it as their\nown country. It was like Luxembourg or something. They ran that country. And they could do\nanything they wanted. The, the district attorney, Huron Fitz was his name. He was on a weekly\nsalary. They paid him every week. And they could do anything. They could cover up any crime.\nIt never got in the paper. Clark Gable drunkenly killed somebody. He did. And no one every\nheard about it. Nothing. Because they ran everything, including the press. It was really their\ncountry. So when Mayer said that \u2014 it really, it sounds ridiculous, but in his mind, I should be\ndeported. And my father \u2014 I always said my father was much more intelligent than Louis, he\nknew so much more, but he wasn\u2019t as smart in a practical way as Louis was. And my father said,\n\u201cLouis,\u201d he said, \u201cmaybe you\u2019re right, but,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere do you think his St. Helena should\nbe?\u201d He said, \u201cMaybe we should deport him to Catalina Island.\u201d\nAnd according to my father, some of the producers laughed, but Louis didn\u2019t think that was a bit\nfunny. So it was really an odd thing, I was being deported, really, and, and uh, blacklisted, by\nboth the Hollywood moguls and the communist moguls, both. It was from both extremes. So I\nwent back to New York, and \u2014 of course, by that time, I felt the die was cast. And then, from\nthen on, which pretty much I\u2019ve done, I would stay east and be a fiction writer and so forth,\nwhich I\u2019ve tried to do.",
        "Q: (Remind us how old you were at that time \u2014 you were very young.)\nI was about 25.",
        "Q: (So wait till you\u2019re finished with the water... Tell us again that you were twenty five years\nold. I mean, that\u2019s a vulnerable time to be so berated by everyone around you.)\nYeah. That book changed my life completely. It even cost me harmony with my first love of my\nlife, my wife, Jigee, Virginia. It even cost me the marriage in a way, because Jigee wanted to\nstay west. She didn\u2019t like the east. And she thought the climate was bad for our little daughter\nVicky, and we sort of argued about that, back and forth. And the, she insisted, almost, on, on,\nthat we live out there. And I was saying, \u201cI can\u2019t live out there. It\u2019s over for me there. And in\nthe east, I\u2019m really accepted now. And I have a new contract for a book, and I\u2019m \u2014 my new life\nhas begun.\u201d\nIt really planted the seeds of our breaking up eventually. That book changed me in every\npossible way. It was really funny.",
        "Q: (Give us a sense of the chronology when it was published, and then, if you could move\nforward to the war, which obviously changed things for everybody, right?)\nI started the book in the spring of \u00b039. I finished it in the, about fall of, of 1940. It was\npublished, uh, on my birthday, uh, in 1941. And uh, and then, then I was working on my, I was\nback in Vermont. I was starting my second book. And then came Pearl Harbor, and we were\nin the war. And then I, I was anxious to get in the war, and I, uh, I applied to the Marine Corps.\nUh, and then I, I went back to Hollywood to see my daughter and Jigee, and at that time, I spoke\nto the, John Ford, the famous movie director. Ford was forming this outfit, the \u2014 called the Navy\nOSS Photographic Unit that would work with the, in the OSS with, with photographic in-\nintelligence. And because of my book\u2019s success, uh, Ford asked, Ford asked me, he said he\nwould like me to be in that unit. So that\u2019s what happened. I then applied, with his\nrecommendation. And that took about six months before I was approved.\nAnd in the meantime, I went down to Mexico and waited in Mexico and wrote screenplays to\nsupport myself, wrote screenplays down there, for Mexican producers.\nAnd then finally I was, I got my Navy commission and went to Washington to report to John\nFord. And that was the beginning of my war experience. I was in, in for about four years,\nbecause after the war, I was with the Nuremberg Trial. It seems to me, I think it was from spring\nof \u201842 to spring of *46 before I got, before I got out, because the last six or seven months was\nspent preparing a film for the Nuremberg, the photographic evidence for the trial.",
        "Q: (Tell us a bit more about John Ford\u2019s role. So you went into the Navy, because he was in the\nNavy, and he already was forming this unit.)\nYes. Exactly.",
        "Q: (But was it solely Navy personnel?)",
        "Q: (Tell us about John Ford and your story about his erratic responses to you in terms of\nrequiring Navy behavior.)\nJohn Ford, of course he was a genius, but he had a, I think he had a kind of sadistic trait. Because\nwhen I came in to report \u2014 I\u2019d known him in Hollywood, and I was still thinking of him as a\nmovie director and me as a young writer. So I walked in and said, \u201cHi Jack, I\u2019m here, like, what\ndo you want me to do?\u201d It was sort of like that. And Ford was now a Navy Commander, and he\nsaid, \u201cEnsign Schulberg, that\u2019s no way to report to your commander. Come to attention and\nsalute and make an official report.\u201d And so on. I thought the guy was crazy, but I said, \u201cEnsign\nSchulberg reporting for duty, Sir.\u201d And he\u2019s said, \u201cThat\u2019s more like it.\u201d So he\u2019s like a standard\nstiff-necked Navy commander. It was so typical Ford, so I say, OK, if that\u2019s what he wants, I'll\ndo it. I don\u2019t care.\nSo the next time I come into his office I give him a sal...and say, \u201cEnsign Schulberg reporting\nfor duty, Sir.\u201d John Ford says to me, \u201cOh, for Christ\u2019s sake, Budd, you don\u2019t have to go through\nall that. Sit down. Let\u2019s talk.\u201d Like now he\u2019s just a movie director again. That\u2019s the way he\nwas. He loved to keep people off balance. That was a big thing with Ford, to keep them off\nbalance. Whatever you thought he was going to say, he\u2019d say something different.\nBut he took glee in, and he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to send you to Fort Schuyler, and they\u2019 Il really\nknock some Navy discipline into you.\u201d He said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to find it very tough.\u201d He\ncouldn\u2019t wait for me to suffer there, at Fort Schuyler. And so I went to Schuyler \u2014 I didn\u2019t mind\nit really, I found it rather interesting. Tough, but \u2014 and we\u2019d run around the Fort at 6 o\u2019clock in\nthe morning and go all through this stuff, and so it was sort of interesting.\nAnd one really funny thing happened there.\nThere were two little ensigns from the South. One was named Watts and the other was named\nFurr. One came from Mississippi and the other from Georgia. And they would always stare at\nme. I\u2019d be doing something and they\u2019d look up and they were staring at me.\nAnd one night after mess, I came back to my bunk, and they came over, and they said, \u201cExcuse\nme, Schulberg, would you mind if we talk to you?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, no.\u201d So they sat down",
        "Q: (How are we doing on tape time? Time? OK)",
        "Q: (Was this in 1943? \u00b0447)\nYes, I'd say this was \u201843, \u201844, yes, as we moved through Belgium and into Germany.\nAnd then they used writers in a very creative way. They had writers like me work with, on the\nteam that would drop, drop agents behind the line. And each agent had about, a team of about\neight that took care of them. They all had different assignments. One would just \u2014 took care of\nhis general welfare. And, and one was involved in the aviation problems, when he could be\ndropped, the weather, and where, and stuff like that. And I as a writer would work on their cover\nstory, which was very much like writing a story. It was exactly like writing a character in\nfiction, because you would find out what they really did, and then just adjust it to what they\nwould say when they got, if they were interrogated. And so that was really interesting.\nRight before the end of the war, we had one, one guy who was a Danish agent. I was just\namazed at the, at the crazy courage of these people. And he\u2019d become quite famous. He had\nbeen actually dropped in Berlin or something, or got to Berlin. He went to the Adlon Hotel, and\nbecame a big pal of some big SS general. He was posing as a, as a neutral salesman of some\nkind \u2014 I forget what the hell they thought he was selling \u2014 but he became a pal and drinking\nbuddy, and so -.\nNow it was quite near the end of the war, and his main worry was that the war might end before\nhe could do 50 drops. He really was worried that the war would be over. He couldn\u2019t wait to get\nhis fiftieth in. And, but three days before, three or four days before the end of the war, back he\nwent again. I asked him, it\u2019s against regulations really, because everything is so secret. But if he\never survived, if he ever came to the States, I\u2019d love to know what happened to him. Because it",
        "Q: (So you had intelligence training, also \u2014 not just naval training, but intelligence training?)\nThat\u2019s right, so they sent me to that school; it\u2019s the same place where the CIA is now. Yeah, that\nwas interesting. They sent me to a school. There were a hundred or so agents, at agent school.\nWe were there about a couple of months, and each one had to make up a false identity, as to who\nthey were and what they did. And they just went, funny things \u2014\nI said I was a sports writer. You had to of course choose something that you could talk about, or\nbe questioned about, that they didn\u2019t know enough about, to pass. So I said I was a sports writer.\nI didn\u2019t say Los Angeles, but close to Los Angeles, like Alta \u2014_,_ that I knew enough about.\nSometimes at three o\u2019clock in the morning, they would wake you up and shake you and say,\n\u2018\u201cWhat\u2019s your name? What do you do?\u201d \u2014 kind of like that, to try and catch you. And\nfascinating, too, every Saturday night there was a long drinking session. They would all be at a\nlong table, and they had every kind of booze on the table, and they would encourage people to\ndrink. And they would see who fell apart in drinking, and who didn\u2019t. And they would weed\nthem out like that.",
        "Q: (Were you good at that?)\nYeah, I was. Yeah, I had had quite a bit of training in it by then. Yes, I was.\nYes, I passed the whole thing.",
        "Q: (Better at drinking than navigation. They have to change tapes, so we can take a little break.\nDid I hear you right?)\nSo I came back from that....\nEND of Tape 1",
        "Q: (Why don\u2019t you tell me how Stuart was brought into the unit and when that was?)\nWell, Stuart joined the Marine Corps. And after his Marine training \u2014 the same tough stuff \u2014\neven tougher maybe that he went through \u2014 he was assigned to a film unit, a film unit in the\nMarine Corps. Meantime, I heard that we\u2019d a slot open in our outfit. Someone had dropped out.\nI forget what happened to him. Anyway, I then recommended to Ray Kellogg that we get Stuart,\nI said he was really very, very able. And so they did suggest to Stuart that he apply, and Ford\napproved it, and so forth. And so Stuart came over, and from that time worked with us. And\nthat\u2019s how we both happened to be, at the end of the war, involved in the Nuremberg Trial\npreparation.",
        "Q: (Just a little background: Did you work at all with the Signal Corps? Did you have any\nconnection or cooperation with the Signal Corps units, and with George Stevens\u2019 unit?)\nNo, we had no connection whatsoever with the Signal Corps. It drives me a little crazy, because\nit will never get straightened out, I don\u2019t think. Somehow on the Internet it says that George\nStevens worked on the Nuremberg film. And I get questions many times: How was it to work\nwith George Stevens? And he seems inextricably bound up in our project. I didn\u2019t even know,\nknow George Stevens. I know his son quite well, but I don\u2019t think I even ever met George\nStevens. And he had nothing whatsoever to do with our project. Nothing.\nWhat he did, and where it got mixed up is that, apparently Stevens, at the end of the war got a\nfilm unit and went around photographing the concentration camps, and made several films that\nwere, I think, quite effective. But of course that was not involved at all in the Nuremberg Trial.\nFor one thing, as I mentioned last night, we could only use film that the Germans themselves had\nshot and prepared, so anything that George Stevens did with our army people would not be\nadmissible evidence. But we never saw George Stevens. And I don\u2019t think Ill ever be able to\ndisconnect it. It comes up constantly. It\u2019s right there, if you find it\u2014 George Stevens worked on\nthis.\nIt\u2019s one of the many, many troubles with the Internet, that\u2019s really a big negative for me. I get\nasked questions about Hollywood, about, did I get back to Hollywood work because I testified to\nthe committee after the war, and I didn\u2019t go anywhere near Hollywood. I still felt outlawed,\nunderstand. And I lived in, in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and just wrote books.\nBut all that misinformation is set in there, and it will be there forever.",
        "Q: (I agree.)\nAnd I\u2019m sure there\u2019Il be biographies written full of misinformation.",
        "Q: (OK, So George Stevens had nothing to do with The Nazi Plan.)",
        "Q: (And did George Stevens and his group have anything to do with John Ford and his unit?)\nNothing. Zero. Nothing. They were two completely separate \u2014 I think that Stevens apparently\ndid some very good work, but it had nothing to do with John Ford\u2019s OSS unit. Nothing.",
        "Q: (OK. Why don\u2019t you tell us, give us some detail about how it came about, your suggestion\nabout photographic evidence, and when you first came to Nuremberg, too, if you can go on to\nthat.)\nAt the end of the war, after the war was, was over, General Bill Donovan was very interested 1n,\nwas one of the first, I think, to be strongly in favor of an international tribunal to try the major\nwar criminals. And he, he called a meeting \u2014\nI need some water, too, cause my mouth gets dry from talking so much. (Drinks)\nHe called a meeting of, of all the various OSS departments to discuss how the OSS could\ncontribute to the building of an international trial. And again, Ray Kellogg, maybe Ford, but I\nworked much more closely with Kellogg than I did with Ford \u2014 Ford was over Kellogg, and Ford\nmight make suggestions to Ray, Ray Kellogg, but Kellogg was my immediate superior. So I\nguess Ray just chose me to go to the meeting, and so I did, and there was Bill Donovan talking\nabout the importance of the impending trial. And he felt that the OSS was logically set up to\nmake a major contribution to their intelligence work and all the rest of it. I got the feeling at the\nmeeting that, that I think Donovan saw himself as the main, would be the main U.S. prosecutor.\nI think he really hoped to have the job that eventually went to Justice Robert Jackson.\nAnyway, each one spoke up about what they could do, and naturally, coming from the Film OSS\nPhotographic \u2014 it was only logical to say that maybe there was photographic evidence that we\ncould use at, at a trial.\nAs aresult of that meeting, Kellogg then put me in, in charge of a photographic team that would\nlook, search for and gather and edit and present the photographic evidence at the trial. And so, so\nI ... Then I went back to Berlin, and, where, where the OSS was headquartered, and, and \u2014 with\nmy brother Stuart, to be in charge of the still photographic evidence. So, he set up in, I think in\nWiesbaden. And Stuart got the, the cooperation of Hans Hoffmann, who was Hitler\u2019s official\nphotographer. And Hoffmann, who \u2014 oddly enough, his son in law was Baldur, Baldur von\nSchirach, the, who was on trial, the head of the Hitlerjugend. It was really ironic because in a\nsense the father in law was helping to hang his son in law.\nBut as I point out \u2014 with all the Germans that we worked with they, once we won, they would do\nanything we wanted, that they were completely submissive, really, and cooperative, almost to a\nslavish point. I mean, I was sort of disgusted with it, ina way. We would say that the \u2014 feeling\nanti-German at that time, because we did feel that the country really overwhelmingly had\nsupported Hitler. You see those crowds of millions and millions of people would turn out for",
        "Q: (Was Hoffmann that cooperative too?)\nHoffmann was totally cooperative with Stuart and turned over his entire treasure trove of\nphotographs to Stuart. Went over with his staff, he had his staff down there, the way I had up in\nBerlin. (Coughing) (Drinks water)",
        "Q: (So, Budd, when did you first go to Nuremberg, to the city? And what did you find when you\nwere there\u2019)\nWhat did I find there, did you say?",
        "Q: (When did you first get to Nuremberg?)\nVery soon after we, after we set up headquarters in Berlin, in the Wannsee, very fancy, plush \u2014 it\nwas like the Beverly Hills of Berlin, I guess, in a way, or even Bellaire. And at that time, I, I uh,\nafter we set up shop there, then because, I went down to Nuremberg to talk with the Jackson\nlegal staff to get the particulars of the indictments and find out, find out specifically what, what\nphotographic, how the photographic evidence would, would dovetail with their actual\nindictments. And uh from the point on we worked very closely.\nThere was a lieutenant Jim Donovan who served as a liaison between the Jackson staff \u2014 he was\non Jackson\u2019s staff, well we all were really, we were officially on Jackson\u2019s staff too \u2014 would\nwork out the, the working arrangement between the indictments and what we could do to back\nup those indictments photographically.\nAnd we worked with Ben Kaplan, whom I still see from time to time on the Vineyard \u2014 a very\ndistinguished lawyer and I think a judge later, but we would work closely with them, and\nsometimes I was down there frequently. I might fly down for a few hours and fly back, and so I\nwas in Nuremberg a lot, every, maybe a couple of times a week even, during that period when\nwe were preparing the film.",
        "Q: (What was the city like? What was the atmosphere like\u2019)\nWell, the city was aruin. It was really a wreck. And the uh, and the Germans seemed very\nbeaten down and sort of depressed, and uh, and eager to please, really, eager to please you, and\nsort of scared of you, too. It was very much a sense of the conquered and the conquerors. But it\nwas shocking to see those cities. I saw Cologne, Berlin itself was, Jesus \u2014 I flew over Berlin in a\nsmall plane, and it looked like a honeycomb. There was hardly a roof left in all of this enormous",
        "Q: (Did you have any reflections on the impact of Allied bombing and whether it was justified?)\nWell, that\u2019s a tough question, because really you might say on both sides, it really doesn\u2019t\nseemed justified to uh bomb civilians, you know, on one side or the other, just as the Nazis were\ndoing in London, and we were doing in Dresden and everywhere else. We did destroy those\ncities. At the time, I felt that, at that time I felt that we had to do it, because we, apparently that\nwas, they thought, the only way to win the war. And God knows we had to win the war if we\nwanted to survive. At the time, at the same time, it was really horrendous to see what we had\ndone, I mean to people, and oh God, the wreckage of tt.",
        "Q: (I\u2019m sorry, go ahead.)\nWhen I saw Berlin, I, my feeling was that it would take fifty years or more to ever get it back\ntogether. I was amazed at how quickly they restored those cities. I was amazed at the resilience\nof people to rebuild them. I thought it would take all through the 20\" century.",
        "Q: (When did you first have real knowledge about what had been going on in the concentration\ncamps?)\nUm, trying to remember \u2014 there \u2014 Even before the war, there had been word, word had gotten out\nthat there were concentration camps, uh, in, in 19... let\u2019s see, what\u2019s it in, yeah, in 1938. Joe,\nJoe Louis\u2019s uh, when\u2014 it was a, famous story that, there was, you know, that was \u2014 Braddock\u2019s\nmanager was Jewish, and, and Goebbels was working very hard to set up a championship fight\nbetween Braddock the champion and Max Schmeling in Germany. And Joe Gould, the manager\n\u2014 I went to see him in the hospital shortly before he died. And whether he made it up or not, Joe\nGould told me that, that he got a phone call from Schmeling in Germany, and Max was dying to\nset up this rematch with Louis. And, so he called. Joe Gould was actually at, at Stillman\u2019s Gym\nwhen he got the call. And Schmeling said, \u201cJoe, I\u2019m here with, with, I\u2019m here with Mr.\nGoebbels in his office, and he would like to talk to you.\u201d And so there was Goebbels in Berlin\ntalking to this little Jewish guy in Stillman\u2019s Gym. And of course now, it sounds made up, but\nwhat, what Joe Gould told me that day in the hospital was that, he said, Goebbels said, \u201cWe\u2019re\nvery anxious to arrange a championship match between your fighter and our fighter, in Berlin,\nand we, and we want to know what your conditions are.\u201d And Gould said, \u201cWell first, I want\n500,000 dollars in a New York bank before we leave.\u201d And he said that Goebbels said, \u201cWell,\nthat\u2019s no problem.\u201d\nAnd he said, \u201cAnd also, we want, one judge must be American, and we want an English referee.\u201d\nAnd he said, \u201cWell, just a minute, I'll have to ask Mr. Schmeling.\u201d Then he came back he said,\n\u201cMr Schmeling says that\u2019s OK, too.\u201d And then he said, \u201cAnd we want ten first class passages,\nand, and first class accommodation for ten people in your best hotel,\u201d and so on. And he said,\n\u201cAlright that'll be alright. Is there any other condition?\u201d",
        "Q: (And that was for the OSS?)\nPardon me?",
        "Q: (For the OSS?)\nFor the OSS, yes, everything I did was on behalf of our OSS unit, yes, yeah.",
        "Q: (OK, so let\u2019s jump in. The war ends, they undertake this incredibly ambitious \u2014 )\nVery. It had never been done before, never",
        "Q: ( -- and so fast, so fast. So talk to me about what they wanted from you, how you could do it\nin the time there was. Tell us about that.)\nThey were building a case that the Nazis and Hitler had conspired almost from the beginning,\nalmost from 1933 on, to breach the Treaty of Versailles and to find ways to get around it. And\nso they had these, many different steps of the indictment \u2014 of crimes against humanity, and, and\ncrimes against the existing peace of the world, and so forth. There was a whole series of them.\nAnd for each one I would sit down with Donovan, sometimes with Ray Kellogg in attendance\nalso \u2014 Ray served as sort of an intermediary between Donovan and me \u2014 and Donovan would\nspell out, out for us what the indictments were, show us, in fact I would read them, and then ask\nus, \u201cHow do you think that you see film building or buttressing the case that we\u2019re making?\u201d So,\nso I would go away with that information and then, then look for film that would answer his, his,\nwhat he was looking for. So...",
        "Q: (Where did you look first?)\nStupidly, we, as a shortcut, because we were very, very worried about time \u2014 at that time it was\nlike August, and the trial was supposed to open on the 15\" of September. We had no time. So\nwe got, so as a Shortcut, we thought we\u2019d look at all the Fox Movietone footage, because actually\nthat was produced, had come from Germany, and so we got all of that, and it, I thought it didn\u2019t\nanswer all, all the things he was asking for, but some of them. And so I, I went down with a list.\nAnd at that point Donovan, Jim Donovan said, \u201cWell, Budd, that\u2019s film that was released in the\nUnited States. Even though the source was German, we can\u2019t use anything that was at the\ninfluence, say, of Fox Movietonews, because the defense attorneys would jump in and say \u2018That,",
        "Q: (Do you want to clear your throat? And then I\u2019d like to have you go back and tell us \u2014 This\nwas at the Babelsberg studio, right? Mention where Avenerius was taking you. And also, talk\nabout, you were presumably working on 35mm film, which is very unwieldy. Let\u2019s go back into\nthat, so you can tell us where, and some of those things about the film conditions, and how you\ncould handle film, both viewing it, copying it, all of that. So, go ahead.)\nWell, we got so much of this film from him, as I mentioned last night, and after a few days of\nthis, he suddenly stopped and suddenly became a little more stiff. Apparently his colonel had\nobjected to his giving us so much film, even though the Soviet Union was one of the four parties\nrepresented in the prosecution. But the colonel stopped it. And then, I won\u2019t go into so much\ndetail, but then we had to win over the colonel, which we did with this lavish party that we threw\nfor him, an all night into the dawn party. When the colonel got drunk enough and softened up,",

And the other part is \u2014 these acres of films, was it your feeling that\nsome of that was official German film, like the Goebbels empire, or that these were all SS film\nlocations?)\nI don\u2019t know if they all were, because we really couldn\u2019t, we were not able to examine them the\nway that we would have wished to, but I got the feeling that these were more SS films that they\nwere hiding, rather than the Goebbels propaganda films. But there might have been some of\nboth. I really don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know the answer.",
        "Q: (But tell us again where the German newsreel material was that you found.)\nWell, that we found mostly in the Babelsberg, where, that Avenerius was in charge of. Most of\nthat film came from there that they had \u2014 all of the newsreel film that had been shot all, all\nthrough the war, from the early days.",
        "Q: (Do you remember where you found the film of the trial of the bomb plotters?)\nYes, I do. It, it was, I really, practically found that myself, with a couple of people with me. We\n\u2014 It was a film lab, and in the basement we found about twenty, twenty reels of film, and so I just\ntook it with us and went back and started to run it. We didn\u2019t know what was in it, and there was\nthe whole God damned trial of the plotters.\nI was rather surprised, seeing the film did, The Nazi Plan, which had only a snippet of the trial,\nthat I can\u2019t remember why that was chosen, because there were far more shocking scenes than\nthat one that we showed, that was not as abusive as some. I don\u2019t know why that one...\nFor some reason, Donovan, at first he didn\u2019t want to use any of the film. He thought that crimes\nagainst their own people would not be as germane. I didn\u2019t really understand it, because after all\nwe were using film of the anti-Jewish riots and so forth, which was against their own people. I\nnever really agreed with him. I don\u2019t know what his reticence was about that.",
        "Q: (Well, I wonder if 1t had anything to do with the fact that the people on trial for trying to kill\nHitler were not the defendants in the dock at Nuremberg. This was a really opposite polarity.)\nWell, that\u2019s true. And Judge Freisler was not \u2014 God he was a horrible, but it\u2019s true he was not on\ntrial.",
        "Q: (I think he was killed in an Allied bombing raid, actually, while he was in a courtroom.)\nFreisler, I think he was. I think he was killed. Thank God, he was a, God what a horrible....",
        "Q: (I share your, your passionate horror for that trial footage. I know it very well.)\nThat trial was something. Then also... I don\u2019t think, I don\u2019t think I spoke about it last night, but\nthe, our, our SS editors told us that the, uh, the uh, July 20\" people, in being convicted, they",
        "Q: (Filmed?)\nFilmed, I mean, yes, filmed. And the idea was that they would show that to every, in every\ndiplomatic center, show it to all the diplomats, Nazi diplomats and High Command people, as a\nway of frightening them against doing something like that again. What we heard was that it, it\nsort of backfired. It was so horrifying that they were afraid it would turn more people against the\nregime and they stopped circulating it.\nAnd of course we were dying to get hold of that film. We were told that someone had actually\nsold it to someone in, in Switzerland, and so I went to Switzerland, went to Bern and to Basel,\ntrying to find out if I could get the film. And a guy, a guy came to my hotel and said that he had\nthe film, and, and he asked me how much I would pay for it. And I forget what I said \u2014 I had\nbeen told, I think, that we could go up to 5000. I think I started at 2500. And he said, he\nwouldn\u2019t even think of it for 2500, and then we got up to 5000. And he came back and said,\n\u201cI\u2019ve got other people interested also, in it and I think they might be willing to pay more than\n5000.\u201d And then I only had permission for five, so I had to call Ray Kellogg and find out how\nmuch more we could pay than 5000. And it took time and red tape, and meanwhile this little guy\ncame back. I waited there in the hotel, and he came back and looked at me, and I think he asked\nsome exorbitant amount like 10,000. I said, well, I don\u2019t have that yet. And he said, \u201cWell, I\nhave someone who\u2019s willing to pay and I\u2019ve decided not to come back any more, and I\u2019m going\nto sell it to him.\u201d And apparently they did.\nApparently it was Nazi people in Spain, where a great many had been able to reach and survive,\nand they bought it. And I went back empty-handed. I was very disappointed I didn\u2019t get the\nfilm. If they\u2019d given me enough money, if they had said 20,000... It was almost, it was like\nbuying a Hollywood story, but \u2014 going back to my boss to ask how much money can I give him.",
        "Q: (Was he a German? Was this little man a German?)\nNo, I thought he was Swiss. I thought he was Swiss and not German.",
        "Q: (You know, everyone\u2019s still looking for that film \u2014 still looking for it.)\nThese two people, they had seen it. And they described that film to me, said it was the most\nhorrifying thing because the people lived for some time. And it was really gruesome. But it\u2019s\nnever been seen, huh?",
        "Q: (So who were the people who described \u2014 )\nIt\u2019s way down in Argentina, maybe, or somewhere, that film.",
        "Q: (But not in Russia, huh? You see a lot of speculation is that it got to Russia.)",
        "Q: (No, and I think the Russians would have exposed it if they had it.)",
        "Q: (So who told you about actually seeing the film?)\nI\u2019m trying to think \u2014 I\u2019m trying to remember. Curt von Molo told me that he had not seen the\nfilm, but that someone had, that he knew had seen the film and told him about it. But he himself\nhad not actually worked on that film. In fact, that there wasn\u2019t anything to edit. Apparently they\njust photographed it.",
        "Q: (So when you had to choose material for the Nazi Plan, I assume you were trying to show the\ndefendants, in action, among other things. How did you decide what to keep and what to throw\nout?)\nWell, it was awfully tough, because we had such an embarrassment of riches. We had so God\ndamn much material. What I would do is more or less make a list of what we had and then go\ndown check it out with Jim Donovan. And he would say \u2018Yes\u2019 to that \u2014 specifically, things like\nthe self-incriminating statements, like, like Goering, Goering reading the racist laws. So he said\n\u2014 In fact, watching the film yesterday, for the ordinary public, it\u2019s a shame we can\u2019t subtitle it,\nbecause Goering was saying something about the Jews, like that we need to sweep Germany\nclean with a steel broom, things like that, that were incriminating, so many things they were\nsaying that were definitely in breach of international law.\nSo it was just a question really of, of very difficult selection and, and elimination. I had told Jim\nDonovan that we could run, I thought we could, at one point I could see running all day from 9 to\n5, and we could run all day.\nAnd he said, well obviously, we can\u2019t do that. And we finally worked it down. Jim Donovan\nsuggested four hours. And so we went back and reviewed and tried to pick the high spots of the\nindictment that our film would relate to, but it, the... We had four film editors and they literally\nworked, I would say, twenty hours a day, I mean, they worked until two and three in the\nmorning, and started again at 7, they just worked around the clock. And that film unit had so\ndamn much film \u2014",
        "Q: (Tell us more about the editors and particularly I\u2019m interested in Joe Zigman since he also\nworked on the other film.)\nWe had three very good Hollywood film editors: Robert Parrish [Drinks] and Joe Zigman, and\nBob Webb. And then we had one Russian girl \u2014 I swear to God, I don\u2019t remember how she got\nassigned to us. She was very helpful. She was a very small Russian newsreel editor. I think her\nname was (Shostopol) or something.\nAnd so the four of them would work around the clock, looking at this film and then trying to\nfollow a sort of a rough outline that I would make. Let\u2019s see now, we start in 1930 and we show\nhighlights before Hitler comes in, and then, we sort of outlined it step by step, and then",
        "Q: (And were they handling original films, or did you make work copies? How did they do\nthat?)\nLet\u2019s see, at first we just looked at the original film, and then as we started making our\nselections, we would, then we would make copies of the footage that they were selecting.",
        "Q: (And the bosses in Nuremberg \u2014 describe again how, how they wanted to review the film\nwork.)\nWell, for one thing, they would say something, that they needed a photograph or something. The\nnext day, they\u2019d be calling and saying, \u201cWell, where is it? Bring it down.\u201d We would try to\nexplain, that first we have to select, we have to edit it, we have to \u2014 they never understood it.\nThey never understood. And General Donovan was very impatient. He had no patience with us\nat all, none at all. Because he would promise things on a high level that couldn\u2019t be fulfilled\ndown where we were, and that was the trouble. And he would be embarrassed, \u201cWell, where is\nit?\u201d So that, uh....\nDonovan finally pulled, he himself pulled out of the trial, as you know. His, his nose was out of\njoint because he was jealous of Justice Jackson, and he didn\u2019t want to play second fiddle to\nJackson, really and so, eventually he withdrew completely, but that didn\u2019t stop us, but we were\nleft in place without Donovan, to finish the work that we\u2019d been asked to do.",
        "Q: (So when you were working that quickly, and you got a little more time because the trial was\npostponed \u2014)\nThank God. When they said September 15\" \u2014 we, we debated whether to go down and admit, I\ndon\u2019t think that there couldn\u2019t be any photographic evidence. You'll have to\u2014 Even though\nJackson in his opening day remarks mentioned that, I think, it was historic, it was the first time\never that there would be \u2014 it was not only the first international trial, but the first trial I believe\nthat ever used photographic, film photographic evidence that way. And we were almost ready to\nsay we can\u2019t do it. And then word came, it\u2019s been postponed until October 15\". And then we\nhad a month\u2019s leave. But as we got toward October 15\" we weren\u2019t ready either. We still had\nlike a month\u2019s work, even killing ourselves with the work.\nAnd then thank God came this second postponement to November. And that really saved us,\nbecause without that, there wouldn\u2019t have been any Nazi Plan film in the courtroom.",
        "Q: (And when it was shown, I\u2019m imagining \u2014 was it a film with tape joins, or had you made a\nprint from, from the assembled material?)\nYes, we \u2018d made a print of the condensed four hour version, yeah, yes, but as noted Ray Kellogg\nhad to \u2014 he testified as to the authenticity of the film, that it was all German film and so forth,",
        "Q: (Did you ever consider whether you had too many Nazi Party rallies\u2019)\nI was worried about that. I was worried about the party rallies, but at the same time, the party\nrallies included two valuable things. One was what they actually said at those rallies, which as it\nmoved on, became more and more inflammatory as they got more and more powerful, and as the\nwestern democracies surrendered to them, and so on. They became more and more aggressive.\nSo there was that sense of, of growing confidence in their aggression that you can\u2019t trace.\nAnd also, there were people whose very presence indicted them. People would say that we, like\nSpeer was one, and Schacht was another \u2014 and a number of people \u2014 and Keitel and Jodl \u2014 but\npeople who said they were just German officials but not necessarily Nazi Party related. And\nshowing them with their Nazi badges and things was, was very helpful in indicting them. And,\nand Riefenstahl was helpful in identifying various people.",

        "Q: (When you showed the Nazi Plan in the courtroom, you were there. Were the defendants\nglad to see themselves up on the screen?)\nNo, I really wouldn\u2019t describe it that way. No, I don\u2019t think they were overjoyed. I think they\nwere worried. They looked worried really. They looked very, they were very concerned.\nGoering 1s, 1s interesting. Goering was by far the smartest of all the people on trial.\nI remember the day at our hotel, when the captain psychiatrist came rushing in, all excited. He\u2019d\nbeen testing the IQs of the various defendants. And he said, \u201cMy God, that Goering he acts like\na clown. He\u2019s a genius.\u201d He said, \u201cHis IQ went through the roof, he\u2019s so smart.\u201d That guy\u2019s\nname was Murphy, Captain Murphy, who strangely enough years later committed suicide also. I\ndon\u2019t remember why.\nBut Goering tended to take the whole trial very seriously, as I mentioned last night. He acted\nlike, as a defendant was who feels that he has a chance of being found not guilty. I don\u2019t know if\nhe really thought so, but that\u2019s the way he acted, and that was his demeanor most of the time in\nthe courtroom. He would take notes, and he would consult with his attorney, and so forth, and he\ntook it very seriously.\nSome just sat like, as if they were staring. Streicher had a funny look on his face. And the two\nmilitary people, Keitel of the Army and Adm. Jodl [sic] very clearly, very clearly were saying,\nwere disassociating, their attitude was, we shouldn\u2019t be here, and we have nothing to do with\nthis. And they would sort of turn away, and act rather haughty, like that. They were all kind of\ndifferent.",
        "Q: (in the dark?)\nWell, it was dark except for the light of the screen. I could see them though.",
        "Q: (Did you feel proud of your work\u2019)\nI guess so.",
        "Q: (interruption)\nI was feeling awfully relieved that we had it in time, I think that was my main emotion. It was\nreally touch and go, too. I mean I would get calls twice a day, \u201cHow is it? Is it ready?\u201d\nIt was also, I just couldn\u2019t take it down and show it. I had to take it down and screen it for\nJackson\u2019s staff to make sure it was all germane, and, and I was very worried about that too \u2014 that\nthey might say \u201cNo you can\u2019t\u201d \u2014 and they were very haughty, I mean they, their attitude toward\nus was sort of, \u201cWho needs them?\u201d I mean, \u201cThey\u2019re just a pain in the ass, sort of a nuisance,\u201d I\nfelt, and we don\u2019t really, they were such \u2014 not Donovan, but Ben Kaplan and the others.",

        "Q: (Do you remember what month it was, when in the course of the project?)\nWhen I took her there? I think it was quite soon before the trial actually started. I think 1t was\nlike a week before, in, in early November.",
        "Q: (Who wrote the intertitles for The Nazi Plan\u2019)\nWell, I think I did, with the people that we had. We had this German prosecutor who had \u2014 I\nnever quite understood how \u2014 he had defected in \u201941 and got to the States, I think probably\nthrough the efforts of the OSS he somehow got to Switzerland on German business or\nsomething, and then defected. And he was a very helpful of course in defining for us what we\nwere looking at.",

        "Q: (intertitles grew out of your list, your script you were taking back and forth for approval?)\nYes, I think it was, yeah. We didn\u2019t take the actual film. We would make a note describing what\nit was and, and summing up what was being said, or being written.",

He was really Hitler\u2019s photographer. And as I\nmentioned, he was the father in law of one of the major war criminals. Baldur von Schirach was\nthe head of the youth movement. And so Stuart with Hoffmann got access to, I guess, as much\nstill photographs as I had film up in Berlin. He and the separate staff that he had went through",
        "Q: (And they were entered into evidence separately...)\nYeah, that\u2019s right. They were entered separately",
        "Q: (Were you and Stuart together when you went through OSS training?)\nNo, no we weren\u2019t at all, because my training preceded Stuart\u2019s, as I\u2019d been in for almost a year,\nI think, before Stuart was transferred to the Marine Corps. And I\u2019m not sure that...see, I\u2019m not\nsure that Stuart went through that, what you might call spy school. I don\u2019t remember that he did.",
        "Q: (Were you in Washington together?)\nOh yes, it was at the south Agriculture Building. That\u2019s where I mentioned before. It was\ntreated like a ship. It was referred to as a ship. And we would \u201cgo ashore\u201d and all this nonsense.",

        "Q: (Could you tell us a little more about the SS editors? Von Molo & Rothe \u2014 what were their\nsympathies? What were their attitudes to what the Nazis had done?)\nWell, Walter Rothe was, had been a Fox Movietone film editor, he was a newsreel editor.\nCurt von Molo had been a feature film, film editor. He told me that he had worked with Fritz\nLang and with some of the top German directors, and he seemed very, he seemed quite\nintelligent. And the two of them, instead of being two Nazi POWs that might have managed\nsympathy for each other, the two of them couldn\u2019t stand each other. They didn\u2019t like each other.\nAnd each, both of them told me \u2014 \u201cI was recruited into the SS film unit but I was, I didn\u2019t want\nto do it, but I had to or else.\u201d Each one said the same thing, \u201cI was really anti Nazi.\u201d Each one\nsaid about the other guy: \u201cWalter Rothe really was a Nazi. He was very sympathetic.\u201d And Rothe\nsaid the same thing about von Molo. He was anti Nazi but von Molo was pro-SS and wanted to\nget in that SS film unit. They both said that. They had no use for each other at all. I really\ndidn\u2019t know which of them was right.\nAlso, Curt von Molo told me that all through the war, while he was working for the SS, that a\nJewish film editor had been hiding in his attic, like in his house. And I took that with a grain of\nsalt, because it was a joke to us. But from the first crossing over into Germany, we didn\u2019t meet a\nGerman who didn\u2019t have a Jew in the attic. How could there be six million Jews in the\nconcentration camps, because they must have all been up in the attics. Everybody we met,\nalmost without fail, would say, \u201cI was against Hitler and I saved a Jew in my attic.\u201d It got to be a\njoke with us. And von Molo said the same thing. He had this Jewish editor, and he said it was\nvery precarious because he did work on these horrible SS films, at the same time.",
        "Q: (Did Von Molo & Rothe ever ask you about being Jewish? Did they ever bring the subject\nup?)\nNo, not that I remember \u2014 no, I don\u2019t remember them ever, no, I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t think they did.",

My mother was born in Latvia, and she came to the States with her\nparents when she was very, very young, like a year old \u2014 a baby being held in her mother\u2019s arms,\nand she had no memory at all of Latvia, but that\u2019s where she was born. And my father, my\nfather was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and his parents had come from Lithuania. But\nneither family was German-Jewish or, or involved in the Holocaust.",

The, the, the pattern of\ndenial was amazing. The commander\u2019s name was Wolf, and I swear to God, he looked kind of\nJewish and had the Jewish name of Wolf. And his defense was sort of like, it really was, his\ndefense was sort of like \u2014 \u201cWell, I tried to save as many as I could. Like I could have killed 35\nor 40 thousand a week but I only killed 17 thousand.\u201d It was like he saved the lives of all these\npeople. That was, that attitude went all the way down the line.\nThere was one big stupid looking guard, and he was accused of maltreating the Jewish prisoners,\nand he actually said, he said, \u201cWell, this woman, you see,\u201d he said, \u201cI was under orders, I had to\nkick her,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t kick her nearly as hard as, I was trying to kick her as little as\u201d\u2019.. It\nwas, all the way down the line that was the attitude \u2014 that they did it as little as possible to\nsurvive. I loved that thing about the kicking. They only kicked her a little bit.",
        "Q: (Was Stuart with you at all in Nuremberg, or in Berlin? Did I ask you that already?)\nIt was just a short time. It seems to me \u2014 I wonder if Sandra could confirm this \u2014 as far as I can\nremember, Stuart, I don\u2019t think he was there on the, when we showed the film. I think by that\ntime Stuart \u2014 I\u2019m quite sure had gone home. I think he had finished his work. I just remember\nhim at the beginning.

And I got back from the war in, I think it was February of \u201946 was\nwhen I finally got released from the Navy. And I got, I bought that farm out in Bucks County.\nAnd Pare Lorentz came out to see me. Oddly enough, he was married to the girl, Elizabeth\nGraham, that I had worked with as a co-writer for Selznick. And I knew her very, very well,\nliked her. And so he came out to see me to describe the film he was planning to make on\nNuremberg, and he thought that after my Nuremberg experience, I would be the logical one to\nwrite and work with him on the film.\nAnd I told him that I had been in the war for four years. I had just gotten out and now I had a\ncontract for a novel with Random House, and they were actually paying me so much a month as\nan advance, and I was living on that, and so I had to go back and get started on my other career.\nHe then tried again, sometime afterwards. I saw him in New York, and he again urged me to\nwrite this, he was very set on doing it. And at that point, we talked about Stuart. Stuart actually\nhad done an excellent job in Nuremberg.

We never really found anything that was related to the gas chambers. We\nhad hoped to. And we\u2019d been told there was such film, but we had never uncovered it, so I was\nfascinated by what Stuart did, yeah. I wish we could have shown that at the trial.",

Was this more\nfrom your SS editors?)\nYes, yes, they said that it, it also had been photographed, yeah.\n(Did you ever come across Walter Frentz, who had worked with Leni Riefenstahl as a\ncameraman on the Olympics film?)\nI remember his name but I don\u2019t recall talking to him.

Do you have any\nthoughts about that continuity between them?)\nWell, only that, I think that Stuart, in getting ready to make that film with Pare, that a very\nlogical, the most logical film editor would have been someone who worked on The Nazi Plan.\nAnd he was very friendly with Joe Zigman. And, I think Bob Parrish had gone back to\nHollywood and was building his own career right after he got out. And so I think that Joe was\nthe logical choice for, and an ideal choice for Stuart. I remember him very well too, Zigman. He\nwas an awfully good person. Yeah.",
        "Q: (Pare Lorentz seems to remember him very fondly, too.)\nYes, he was awfully appealing. When did Joe die? Do you know when? Cause I lost touch with\nhim.",
        "Q: ( haven\u2019t found out exactly.)",
        "Q: (SS editors \u2014 How did the main film editors use them? Were they used as assistant editors?\nCutting?)\nNo, I don\u2019t recall them, I don\u2019t recall them.... They were much more just advising as to what\nfilm was available. I don\u2019t think that they, I don\u2019t remember them ever actually working on a\nMoviola, editing the film.",
        "Q: (And Movieolas are what you used, right?)\nThat\u2019s what they used then, oh yes, God, yes. Hours and hours and hours at the Moviola",
        "Q: (Separate tracks for sound?)\nYes, I think there were separate tracks, yeah.",
        "Q: (For your material for The Nazi Plan, if | understand correctly, you only used original tracks\nthat were found with the films?)\nAbsolutely, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s the only thing we could do. We couldn\u2019t use anything that was\nnot the German original, and nothing else, because they thought the defense attorneys would\npounce on it. And by the way, the defense attorneys took their jobs very seriously, because it\nwas not like a routine, cut and dried. They really, they were all excellent German lawyers. And\nthey worked very diligently and would make, I mean their, they argued very hard for their\nclients; they really did.",
        "Q: (Did you have a sense that there was anxiety on the part of the prosecution, as to whether the\nfilm evidence would be accepted and valid in supporting the indictment?)\nWell, uh, only at the beginning \u2014 at the beginning, much more than later. I would say that\ngradually, they became impressed with how detailed the dovetailing of the film and the\nstatements were to what they had on paper. And so the, I think the confidence grew as, as we\nwent along, and that when they found that statements and pictures really were incriminating, they\nfelt that it would bolster their case.\nI think it was quite surprising and very enterprising of Justice Jackson, coming from the\nbackground that he did \u2014 after all, he wasn\u2019t John Ford from Hollywood \u2014 that he was as, as, as\nopen to the use of film, which was so innovative and had never been done, as he was. He was\nreally very sympathetic to its use, as long as, as long as we were diligent. Ben Kaplan who\u2019s this\nvery nice guy that I still talk to on the Vineyard. He was very, very tough, and he was rather\nsnooty about it. I mean, he was doing it because they told him, but his heart wasn\u2019t really in it, I\ndon\u2019t think. But he would put it to very tough legal tests as to whether it was just movies or it\nreally was, really was indictable evidence, which was good, really. That was useful.",
        "Q: (I believe that was the standard. Visual images could be entered as long as they were\npertinent, directly pertinent to the charge.)\nExactly, exactly, exactly. And that\u2019s what he held us to. Yeah.",
        "Q: (Well, that must have made your job really hard at the beginning, when they hadn\u2019t decided\nyet what the indictments were going to be.)\nThat\u2019s very true. At the beginning, the whole thing was so, so nebulous, that we almost had to\ntry to read their minds as to what they would be looking for. We had to decide \u2014 these non-legal\nminds of ours \u2014 what did seem to us indictable evidence. Yeah, that\u2019s right. We had pretty good\n\u2014 but I must say, looking back, that we had a pretty good sense of what was really verbal and\nvisual crime. We had some sense of tt.",
        "Q: (Do you know what was done with the original film elements when you were finished?)\nWell, I was very nervous about that, because, for one thing, on the July 20\", all that film, I had\nsomething which, there was some army colonel that was attached to us, and we found out that he\nhad taken some of that film and sold it to some American company. And I just hit the ceiling,\nbecause all this stuff was very valuable in a private profit-making way. It was all very hot film,\nyou might say. I had nightmares about how people might try to grab it and steal it and, and, and\nsell it. And this colonel in the army, I asked that, I talked to Kellogg about him and asked that he\nbe removed from us. I talked to people about \u2014 you must not \u2014everybody has to be absolutely,\ntotally honest about this, and, and scrupulous about it. We must send all of it back to the\nNational Archives, and nowhere else. And that\u2019s what I did. I sent all of the film to the National\nArchives.",
        "Q: (So, you must have required security even for the cutting rooms?)\nWell, we did. Yes we did. Yes they did. Yes, we were concerned about that, yeah.",
        "Q: (Did you every sleep during this period?)",
        "Q: (There must have been a great deal of comradeship. )",
        "Q: (How do you look back on this fitting into your whole career and life? What does this short\nperiod mean to you in terms of what you did?)\nWell, I think of myself as being very lucky, really, that I just happened to be in the right place at\nthe right time and that I was very lucky they chose me for that job. They could have picked\nsomebody else, I guess. And I think that just now, looking back that long ago as some, just one\nchapter in my life. In just a short time I\u2019ve celebrated the 60\" anniversary of the Nuremberg\nTrial. And quite recently I celebrated the 40\" anniversary of the Watts Writers Workshop, that I\ngot started when, on the day the curfew was lifted on the Watts riots, or the Uprising as they\nalways called it down there.\nI think I\u2019ve been lucky that I\u2019ve been able to be at certain places at the right times.",
        "Q: (We only have a couple more minutes...)\nOk.",
        "Q: (Do you want to describe some more about the Watts Workshop? That seems like a\nwonderful...)\nWell, I... . Yeah, I felt awfully good last month, when I went for the 40\", and, and uh saw these\nmen who are now about 60 years old, who were really uh kids some were quite almost wild kids\nwho were running the streets and, uh, it was very, it was very moving for me to, when I, I call on\nthe phone to University of California at Northridge, and, and, the voice I hear is this very deep,\nprofound-sounding voice saying, this is Professor Scott, please leave a message, and I think of\nthis Professor Scott as this w-wild kid of nineteen, he was, uh, he had been in the riots and\nthrowing Molotov cocktails and all this.\nWhen I went down there, I went down on the first day that the, that the curfew was lifted and it\nwas pretty wild still there. Some buildings were still smoking and smoldering, and there were\nlittle fires in the different open lots, and it was very, it was very, very tense, and I got this idea,\nsort of a wild idea, of starting a writer\u2019s workshop, and, and I put up a notice in a, it was kind of\na settlement house called Westminster. I just put a sign up on the bulletin board saying \u201cWriter\u2019s\nWorkshop, anybody interested sign below.\u201d And I said I would be back every Wednesday.\nIt took me a long time, for about 2 2 months nobody came. Nobody came. I just sat there. I\njust sat there, and I learned a lot about Watts. I read the local paper, The Sentinel, I talked with\nthe social workers. I went down in the, in the pool hall, sat around there, got kind of snubbed\nand glared at. I learned a lot, and my wife Geraldine was sort of taunting me about this, and she\nsaid, \u2019'd come back and she said, \u201cWell, what happened?\u201d I'd say, \u201cWell nobody showed up.\u201d",
        "Q: (So you\u2019re back to where you were born.)\nPretty much, that\u2019s right. Yes, I am, it\u2019s very close to where I was born, I know.",
        "Q: (Budd, this is such a privilege and I thank you so much.)",
        "Q: (I wish we could keep going. We\u2019ll have to do it the next time).\nOh, alright, Raye, fine. It\u2019s been nice to talk to you.",

        "My father and Louis made their films for a few years, for about three or four years, and then\nLouis Mayer went to the newly formed MGM. And at that point my father went over, went back\nto Zukor, in a sense, and became head of the, of the west coast studio of Paramount. And so, all\nthrough my young manhood, growing up, I really grew up on the, in a way, on the backlot. I\nused to go there almost every day on my bike, drove through those famous gates, and roam\naround and play on the backlot sets, and wander into different stages where they were shooting\namazing films. So all these famous stars were like old hat to us \u2014 they were more like people\nwho just worked for my father \u2014 was the way we thought of them.",
        "Stuart had several short stories in The American Best Short Stories. He really wrote very well. If\nhe hadn\u2019t gotten into television producing, he might very well have just gotten into pure writing\nalso. It just ran in our family, really.\nMy sister is really an excellent writer. I\u2019ve often said, and I mean it. She\u2019s a better writer, she\u2019s a\nbetter, delicate writer than Iam. If we had a little contest, describing some Hollywood street.\nShe can still do that better than I can; she\u2019s very, very sharp.\nThe difference was that I made, I made much more of a job of it, an everyday job. And Sonya is\nso finicky that nothing ever satisfies her. She\u2019|l take a short story and work on it for a year, and\nstill not want to show it to anyone. She\u2019s a perfectionist. But in the real life of writing you can\u2019t\ndo that. You\u2019ll spend the rest of your life polishing one thing. And Sonya tends to do that.",
        "And, let\u2019s see, I came back and started working for David as a young screenwriter. And I had a\nseven-year contract \u2014 it started at 50 and went to 75 a week. At the end of seven years, I would\nhave been making $500. And, uh, but he, but even, a year and a half into it, I would write\nscreenplays that David, I don\u2019t think ever read; he was so busy making the films he was already\nplanning.\nAnd then they would call us in \u2014I thought of it as being a, sort of like being a pinch hitter who\ncomes in off the bench. If there was some immediate problem, David would call Ring Lardner\nand me \u2014 we were a writing team. We were both about 21, 22 years old. We were just out of\ncollege.\nAnd he would call us in on \u2014like on A Star is Born. They couldn\u2019t figure out the ending of A Star\nis Born, and we wrote the ending of it, that one where Janet comes out of Grauman\u2019s Chinese\nand sees her husband\u2019s footprints and handprints, and when she\u2019s asked her name. She\u2019s now a\nbig movie star, and he\u2019s gone down, and in fact he committed suicide because he couldn\u2019t stand\nhis failure while she\u2019s gone up. And she looks down, and when they ask her on the radio, she\nsays, \u201cThis is Mrs. Norman Maine.\u201d \u2014 and it\u2019s a big ending in the movie. Things like that, little\nbits and pieces. It wasn\u2019t awfully satisfying.\nBy the time he was about to pick up my third option, I went in to David and I asked David \u2014 I\u2019d\nknown him so well for years and years \u2014 my mother even put him, my mother really stage\nmanaged his wedding to Irene Mayer, my mother really sort of put them together, encouraged\nthem. And I\u2019d known him since I was a kid, and I said, \u201cDavid, do me a big favor, please, don\u2019t\npick up my option.\u201d And David was really very hurt. He said \u2014 he felt really insulted, and he\nsaid, \u201cWell, I have great plans for you. I was thinking that as I get older, I may retire, and you\nmight be ready to take over for me, and then my young son Danny, Danny would work for you\nthe way you work....\u201d You could see this going on until the 21\u201c century \u2014 a dynasty of the\nSelznicks and the Schulbergs.\nAnd I said, \u201cWell, I appreciate that, David, I really want to be a writer, and not really a big\nproducer, like you.\u201d And David said, he said, \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201c I know we carry you on the\npayroll as a writer\u201d \u2014 and that hurt my feelings a little bit, but that\u2019s exactly what he said \u2014 he\nsaid, \u201cI know we carry you on the payroll as a writer, but,\u201d he said, \u201cI figure that sooner or later\nyour producer\u2019s blood would begin to assert itself and that would kick in.\u201d\nI told Scott Fitzgerald that anecdote, and he used it in The Last Tycoon. It\u2019s in The Last Tycoon.\nSo anyway, to cut this a little shorter, I finally did get out of there. I started writing short stories\nfor Liberty and Colliers and for all the slick magazines. And I was doing very well with that.\nAnd one of the short stories was What Makes Sammy Run? And I then decided that I'd like to\nput, work out there and try to develop that as a novel. And that, that caused me quite a bit of\ntrouble. Because for one thing, I was, I was, I was a young member of the Communist Party\n(drinks) \u2014 (PAUSE)",
        "We met secretly every week, once a week, and we all had lots of assignments. We were very\nbusy infiltrating different organizations, the Screenwriters\u2019 Guild and the Anti-Nazi League \u2014 all\nkinds of things, the Democratic Party and Young Democrats, and we would try to infiltrate them,\nto influence them toward the communist program. So I asked at the meeting if I could be\nexcused from my regular assignments in order to \u2014 I'd like to stop and write this book.\nThe answer was, \u201cI guess you\u2019ll have to talk to Jack Lawson about that\u201d \u2014 Lawson was the head\nof the communist party \u2014 \u201cto decide whether the book would be valuable enough to the party to\njustify your dropping your assignments.\u201d So I went to see Lawson, and Lawson was, was very\ntough, really tough and hardnosed.\nAnd Jack said, \u201cWell, Budd, I think the only way we can handle this is that you make an outline\nof the book, show me the outline, and then if I think the book will be useful to the party, then I'll\nsort of supervise the writing of the book.\u201d And I said, \u201cJesus, Jack, I can\u2019t do that.\u201d And Jack\nstarted to give me things about the responsibility to the party. And that went on for many, many\nweeks, and I refused to do it. And they said, \u201cNo, you have to do it, or if you....\u201d\nFinally, one day I went home with my young wife, Jigee, and I said, \u201cJigee, I can\u2019t take the\nargument any more. It\u2019s just eating me up, and so what I want to do is get in the car and drive\naway and just leave. And even that was, even that \u2014 people don\u2019t realize how tightly disciplined\nthe party was. You couldn\u2019t just get in a car and drive away. If you were going to New York you\nhad to tell them where you were going. And then if you were staying more than two or three\nweeks, you were reassigned to a unit in New York. It was very tightly controlled. So I just \u2014 the\nvery act of getting in a car and driving away was a very serious defiance of the party discipline.\nAnd when I got back to, I went back to Dartmouth, where I\u2019d gone to college, and found a little\nhouse, very cheap, for about 50 or 60 bucks a month, it was. And for the next year I worked on\nthis book, Sammy. Meanwhile, while I was there, the Soviet-Nazi pact came down, and that\ndrove me even further from the party, because I felt that we all had to stand up to Hitler, and\nsuddenly, suddenly the party people were saying that it\u2019s just an imperialist war between the\nGermans and the English. And we should be neutral and stuff, which I thought was a grave\nmistake, also.\nAlso, and so I was even further alienated from the party. And I got the book done and, and went\nback and, uh, the top people like Lawson were mad, were very mad at me for going and doing\nthis on my own. But when the book was published, the book reviewer for the People\u2019s World,\nwhich was the western edition of the Daily Worker, Charles Glenn was his name \u2014 he wrote a\nrave review of the book. He thought the book was the Hollywood book, if not maybe the great\nAmerican novel that everyone was talking about \u2014 raved about it.\nThat caused a firestorm apparently. They called him in and they gave him hell \u2014 Lawson and\ncompany. Two weeks later he re-reviewed the book and he said, \u201cOn further consideration\u201d \u2014\nand he even said, \u201cIt\u2019s been pointed out to me the shortcomings,\u201d and he absolutely trashed the\nbook. Apparently they had threatened him that if he didn\u2019t, if he didn\u2019t do that he would be fired\nfrom the paper and maybe even kicked out of the party. He had to do it, and so he just trashed",
        "the book. It was a terrible book. It didn\u2019t do that and it didn\u2019t do that. It was really disgraceful,\njust disgraceful.",
        "(Drinks)",
        "No. It was not. It could have been anywhere. It could have been Marine, or Army. I think that\nJack just had contacts with the Navy. He was a friend of Bill Donovan, the OSS head, of the\nnewly formed OSS. And, so it was a Navy outfit that really was, didn\u2019t really have very much to\ndo with the Navy.\nAt the same time, there were some really ridiculously funny things like at our headquarters in\nWashington, at the Agricultural Building, if you wanted to go out for lunch, you would go to the\nMarine Sergeant and say, \u201cPermission to go ashore, Sir.\u201d We had all this naval talk, even though\nwe never saw a ship. But, Ford did send me for naval training anyway, to Fort Schuyler. I went\nto Fort Schuyler and got Navy indoctrination, where I had some trouble with navigation and all\nthese things, I wasn\u2019t very good at that.",
        "opposite me in this little bunk. And I said, \u201cOK, what do you want to talk about?\u201d And they\nsaid, in that thick southern accent, I can\u2019t do it, they said: \u201cSomeone told us that you were a\nJew.\u201d And they said, \u201cYou know, we\u2019ve never seen one before.\u201d It was like looking at a koala\nbear from Australia or something, and they\u2019d never seen one before.\nAnd then they, and then we got to chatting a bit. And then they \u2014 they were very polite. He said,\n\u201cWell, Sir, if you don\u2019t mind our asking,\u201d Furr said, \u201cWhat do you do in civilian life?\u201d And I\nsaid, \u201cWell, I\u2019m a writer.\u201d And Furr said, \u201cA writer. That\u2019s interesting.\u201d He said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a\ncouple\u201d \u2014 he came from Oxford, Mississippi \u2014 he said, \u201c\u201cWe\u2019ve got a couple of writers in our\ntown.\u201d And I said, and I said, \u201cYou mean Faulkner?\u201d And he said, \u201cYeah, the Faulkner\nbrothers, the brothers.\u201d\nHe said, \u201cYou know, those two guys\u201d \u2014 he said, \u201cI\u2019m a druggist.\u201d He worked in a drug store,\nand his whole view of Faulkner \u2014 he said, \u201cThese two Faulkner brothers,\u201d he said, \u201calmost every\nmorning, they come in and buy aspirin, because they\u2019ve got such bad headaches, because they\ndrink so damn much at night.\u201d That was his \u2014\nAnd I said, \u201cWell\u201d \u2014 and I said, \u201cWilliam Faulkner? You know William Faulkner?\u201d And he\nsaid, \u201cWell sure, I see him every morning.\u201d He said, \u201cHow do you know him?\u201d He had no idea\nthat he was famous. He just thought he was a crazy guy in town. They had no idea he was a\nfamous writer. They were so funny. They used to...\nAfter that, they would, whenever they saw me \u2014 I should write about them some time \u2014 they\nwould \u2014(Drinks)\nUmm, whenever they saw me, they would say, \u201cHi, Schulberg,\u201d and then they\u2019d look at each\nother, be sort of pleased. It was like that, I mean, it was just a, I was just a bizarre thing to them.\nI didn\u2019t feel really anti-Semitism, it was just, simply, they had never seen one, that\u2019s all. ----------\n------(?) or something. It was so...\nAnd the final exam - it was just murder. You, you had to chart the, chart the passage of a ship,\nand you get all these instructions, thirty knots at this and then left to here and right to there,\ntrying to take it from this one place all the way through the canal, to docking. And I didn\u2019t know\nwhat the hell I was doing. I was sweating. I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to flunk this thing, Ford is going to\nkill me.\u201d I couldn\u2019t do it.\nI swear to God, as I\u2019m sweating this out, Furr and Watts are sitting right across the aisle from\nme, and I see a hand coming in surreptitiously, and he shows me his paper so I could copy it and\npass. They saved me. They saved me \u2014 Furr and Watts. God, they were sort of lovable, really.\nI\u2019m sure when they went home, big stories about how they met this Jew. Now we know one,\nlike, we really saw one.",
        "So, then I came back from Fort Schuyler, and Ford called me in and said \u2014 well, by this time \u2019'm\nreally snapping, I\u2019m really Navy. I\u2019ve been there for three months or something. And I\u2019m very\nsnapped up.\nAnd Ford the sadist said, \u201cWell, how\u2019d you like that?\u201d And I said, \u201cGee, I really loved it,\nCommander, it was great.\u201d It was sort of laying into him, and he wanted me to say, God, I\nsuffered there or something. He was not happy \u2014 he thought I was suffering there at Fort\nSchuyler.\nBut after that, after that, the first nine or ten months or almost a year, we worked just in, in\nWashington. And Ford had made a film about, a film for public consumption about, about Pearl\nHarbor, and he asked me to write the, sort of the commentary, the narration, I mean, titles and\nstuff, and so on. I worked on films like that, which was more or less like working in Hollywood.\nAnd, then he sent me overseas to London. I was there in the blitz, and we did some, some\nundercover work in, in London, and then Paris.\nAnd then we had some really interesting assignments. One was not really involved in\nphotography. We were part of a little group that, as soon as a German town fell, we would rush\nin and try to grab as much information \u2014 we would go to the SS headquarters and things like that\nand grab papers and orders and things like that. It was interesting. It was interesting.",
        "was frustrating. When we did this work, when they made contact inside, they made someone,\nnot us, but just someone, in London I think it was, so we would never know what happened, we\ndidn\u2019t know whether they got killed or were doing great. We never could sort of complete the\nexperience. So I asked him, if he ever got out, if he survived this last one, and got to the States, I\nwish he would look me up and tell me what the hell happened to him. But I never heard from\nhim. I don\u2019t know what happened to him.",
        "Tape 2 of 3:",
        "Nothing.",
        "those rallies. And we said that we thought of the Germans as being either, either at your throat\nor, or at your feet. That\u2019s what we said.\nAnd at that point, we found them willing \u2014 that even formerly Nazi people would do anything\nthat you, anything that you wanted, because they were scared of us also. But by then we were\nthe conquerors and they were scared about what we might do to them.",
        "city. There was hardly any roofs on the buildings. You could just see right into them. It was\ntotally destroyed.",
        "Gould said that he said, \u201cWell, there\u2019s just one more. We\u2019d like you to release all, all the Jews\nfrom your concentration camps.\u201d\nSo that was \u201938. So by that time we were hearing rumors about the concentration camps. It was\nbeginning to get out. They were just starting. I\u2019m not sure exactly when they set them up. But\nthere were only a few in the beginning. I think Dachau was one of the early ones.\nIncidentally I, getting ready for the Nuremberg trial, I went to the Dachau trial as an observer.

It has to be only German film, made in Germany, photographed by the Germans,\nofficial Germans, too \u2014 the army or the Waffen SS people and so on.\u201d It made our job so much\nmore difficult. I wasn\u2019t sure we could really do it at all.\nAnd then we heard that that film was, the German film was all in the Russian sector, which made\nit even more difficult for us.\nIt\u2019s sort of a long story, Raye, but I went to the head of the Russian archives, this unusual man,\nuh, Major Avenerius he was, and I told him what we were looking for, and as I said last night,\nhe, he asked me, well, he said, \u201cDid you come up from the John Ford unit?\u201d And I said, \u201cYes,\u201d\nand he said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s very interesting.\u201d And it turned out that he was a John Ford scholar.\nHe knew every, he really knew every Ford movie. He named them, he must have named twenty\nof them or more, every single one, all the way back to the early 20s. He knew the obscure silent\nfilms. He knew every damned shot. It turned out he was a... He was like really basically a\ncivilian, and he\u2019d been a professor at the film institute in Moscow, and John Ford was his\nfavorite of all world directors. John Ford was his favorite director. He knew everything about\nFord.\nAnd he found it very interesting that Ford was the commander of the outfit. And he asked me if\nFord would be coming, and I said \u201cWell, yes he might come, just to inspect what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\nAnd he said, \u201cWould you introduce me to him?\u201d All his life he\u2019d wanted to meet John Ford. I\nsaid, \u201cWell, sure, if he comes. I think he may come.\u201d And with that, that opened the door. He\ntold me to come back in the morning. And he opened up to us only, German, not all but a lot of\nthe German newsreel film that they had shot themselves, and that we, a great deal of that record,\nthe whole record of the growth of the Nazis and their coming to power officially through that\nstrange uh, actually through an election, and all the rest of it.\nSo much of that film that we got from him the next day [coughs] we got because of the John\nFord connection. We actually got a truck and loaded the truck with film. We had, we only\nshowed four hours at the trial but we had maybe forty or fifty hours. We had hundreds and\nhundreds, hundreds of thousands of feet \u2014 it may have been as much as a million feet, I swear to\nGod.",
        "and we showed them the July 20\" trial, which they were very interested in, and they wanted a \u2014\nwe had that and they didn\u2019t \u2014 and they wanted a copy of that, which we would make for them.\nAnd so, softened up, the colonel then gave us permission to drive way into the Soviet sector. And\nit was on that trip that \u2014 which the Russians said it was the furthest any Americans had been\nallowed in to penetrate the Soviet sector \u2014 they knew of this tunnel where film had ... I should\nbacktrack.\nMy two, my two SS film editors \u2014 we had recruited them from a POW camp \u2014 Walter Rothe and\nCurt von Molo were their names - and they told us that there were films made of, actually\nshowing the Jews being shoved into cattle cars and ripped of their rings and jewelry and, and\nvarious atrocious things that the SS were doing to these poor Jewish victims. And, they had both\nworked on those, edited those films, and had shown them to Goebbels and Himmler, and\nobscenely, they called them \u2018desserts,\u2019 because they would be shown after dinner like a dessert\nin a\u2014I guess as an amusement, partly an amusement but partly it was supposed to be reporting.\nThese were like SS reports on what they were accomplishing. And they told us that there were a\ngreat many of these films. And the Russians said that they might be in this place, where they\u2019d\nbeen sort of sealed up in a tunnel. And they did take us there, and it was on fire. It was burning.\nIt was almost, it, it was, God, it looked like acres of film were burning. We did pick up little\npieces.\nAnd then they told us about two, two places in the sector, one called Rossleben and, and\nRudersdorf \u2014 two small towns where the same thing. They would apparently make a tunnel into a\nmountainside or a hillside, and then seal up this film. And they were hiding it. And, and so we\ndrove to both places. And in both places, of course, Rossleben and Rudersdorf, we found the\nsame thing that we had found in the Russian sector. The film was burning, or had been burned \u2014\nacres of it. It was huge. And once again, we were cheated out of getting what would have been\njust invaluable stuff. And again, we picked up here and there \u2014 it would be like a foot of, of film\nthat was \u2014 you could see what it was if you held it to the light. And we did find some of that and\nmade copies of it and, and brought that, and brought that down to Nuremberg. But I was\nconvinced by this having happened three times that someone must be informing them that, that\nwe were coming to get it.",

        "Yeah, but they never found it there.",

        "But it is true that the day of the Nazi Plan screening I was very, it was like three months of work,\nit was like your movie is about to open, and I was very keen to get there. I purposely got there as\nearly, so early I think I was the first one to walk in, and so I was able to get a seat. I sat at the\nend of the Russian table, and that table \u2014 as I noticed again last night \u2014 was like maybe ten feet\nfrom the dock, and from that vantage point, I was able to watch them. They were almost as near\nas you are, as you are to me, just a little further, but I could watch them absolutely, all their\nfaces, I just going down the line, back and forth.",
        "Tape 3 of 3:",
        "Leni Riefenstahl.\nWell, it seemed a fairly obvious search for us.\n[Sound problem \u2014 Boom mike was missing. |\nWell, the \u2014 of all the Nazi propaganda films that, many were made, by far the most, by far the\nmost illustrious, or you might say notorious, of the Germans was Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s master film\nof the Nazi party day \u2014 I think it was the seventh \u2014 called the Triumph of the Will. It was shot in\na way that you could see obviously idolized and made heroes of the people, by shooting at a low\nangle up on Hitler and the other Nazi leaders, a sense of really ex-, ex-, exalting them. The film,\nwhich was about a three-hour, very long documentary film, was a powerful, powerful piece of\nwork. It was overwhelming. The, the idea that Goebbels had, and Hitler, was to have a film that\ncould be shown, it was not only for German consumption. It was shown all over Europe.\nAnd I think that it definitely made a contribution to the capitulation of the western democracies,\ncapitulating to Hitler, letting him make one act of aggression after another, in the Rhineland, and\nthe Sudetenland, and on and on they went, one little step at a time.\nAnd the feeling was that, looking at that film, that it would make the non-German countries and\ntheir leaders say, \u201cHow can we possibly defeat that power?\u201d It was overwhelming, just\noverwhelming.\nI think 1t was General Donovan who said that the Triumph of the Will was worth two Wehrmacht\ndivisions. It was a powerful piece of propaganda.\nAnd so, it was, it didn\u2019t take any genius to think that we ought to talk to Leni Riefenstahl. She\nnot only made that one masterwork, but she made a number of small Parteitag films or reports.\nShe was very closely tied in with the whole Nazi propaganda machine. And so it was obvious\nthat we would want to, to speak with her and, and examine her, and bring her to Nuremberg.\nAnd so I went on a search one by one and first spoke to counter intelligence in Berlin, and they\ndirected to me to some place in Strasbourg. And I went there, and then I went to Kitzbihl. And\none by one, I got closer and closer to finding out where she actually was living \u2014 sort of hiding in\nthe open, in a way. It wasn\u2019t exactly hiding but she wasn\u2019t advertising either, what her address\nwas.\nAnd so I was able to actually, with a weapons carrier and an army driver, I was able to go to her\nhouse and literally just knock on the door. She was living in a very nice place \u2014 it was a big, big,\nrustic \u2014 it looked like three stories \u2014 a very, quite large \u2014 on a, overlooking a Bavarian lake. It\nwas a very nice place. So that\u2019s what I did. I just knocked on the door and somebody came to\nthe door.\nAnd I was in my Navy uniform, of course. And I said, \u201cI would like to speak to Miss\nRiefenstahl.\u201d And they let me in. It was a little man, said he would call her. So I sat down, and",
        "I waited. It took a very long time for her to come. I think it was almost half an hour, maybe.\nShe took a very long time coming. I think she was making up. After all, she was a movie star as\nwell as a filmmaker \u2014 big star in Germany \u2014all these famous ice movies that she made, and\nmountain movies.\nAnd she finally came, and I sat with her on a couch. And she started right away working on me.\nShe said, of course, \u201cI\u2019m a film artist, and internationally respected.\u201d And she gave a very\npositive rundown on herself. And she said, \u201cI\u2019m respected everywhere in London, in\nHollywood, and so forth, and I\u2019m not a Nazi, I\u2019m a pure film artist.\u201d That was her own party line\nand, boy, she stuck to it pretty well, too. And, and when she told me how well received she was\nin Hollywood, of course that was my hometown. She didn\u2019t know that I came from Hollywood.\nShe just saw a young, an American officer who was trying to do her in. And she told me that,\nafter all, even in 1938 everyone in Hollywood received her as a pure filmmaker and fellow artist.\nAnd I didn\u2019t tell her that I was in Hollywood when she came. Hal Roach was an extremely\nrightwing \u2014 the old comedy producer/director Hal Roach gave a party for her, a big reception\nparty, and asked all the main people in Hollywood to come. And all of the liberal people like\nMelvyn Douglas and Helen Gahagan and Dorothy Parker and so many, Freddy March \u2014 a whole\nbunch, there must have been twenty \u2014 they were each given a list of ten people to phone and say,\n\u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d I had a list myself. And the party was a fiasco. Only about eight or ten people \u2014\njust the extreme right wing people like Victor McLaglen, people like that \u2014 only the fascist\nminded people, of which there were unpleasantly some in Hollywood. It was a total fiasco.\nBasically, the party was a disaster for her. But I didn\u2019t tell her that. I just listened and listened.\nBut as I said last night, I had this warrant for her in my pocket. It was like burning a hole in my\npocket. I thought, I would just let her talk a little longer, so I relaxed her. I didn\u2019t argue with her\nat all about what she thought she was.\nFinally I took the thing out and said, \u201cMiss Riefenstahl, I\u2019m sorry, but I have to take you to\nNuremberg.\u201d And that\u2019s when she screamed \u201cPuppi, Puppi, they\u2019re, he\u2019s arresting me,\u201d she\nscreamed. \u201cHe\u2019s arresting me.\u201d And he ran in. I didn\u2019t know at the time, he was a major in the\nWehrmacht. And I told her, I tried to reassure her, I said, \u201cLook, you\u2019re not being put on trial\nwith Goering and von Ribbentrop, but we do need you as a material witness, and you\u2019ll be held,\nyoull be put up in one of the hotels, and held until the court releases you.\u201d\nAnd so out we went. We went in \u2014I wish I had a photo of that \u2014 because sitting outside was a\nweapons carrier, like an open truck almost. It was just the three of us, and we drove from there,\nfrom Kitzbuhl, all the way to Nuremberg. She didn\u2019t say anything on the way. She was just\nsilent. She didn\u2019t say anything. She was very ticked off \u2014 very. And I guess scared.",
        "They would run film, we ran the Triumph of the Will and the other film that she made, and we\nwould ask her to, we would stop it and ask her who was that, and who was that, and identifying\npeople. Where and when and who it was, really.",
        "thousands and thousands and thousands of photographs, doing much the same thing that I did,\nshowing them to Donovan as to their value as evidence at the trial.\n[Footnote: This refers to Heinrich Hoffmann.]",
        "I guess I didn\u2019t tell that last night. One Sunday, we \u2014 we would tend to try to rest on Sunday.\nWe were, everybody was really wiped out by this work. One Sunday, I said to von Molo,\n\u201cLook, Curt, I\u2019m really sick of hearing about these Jews in the attic, I\u2019ve had it up to here with it,\nand I\u2019ve got to tell you I don\u2019t believe it, and he said, \u201cWell, honestly, I\u2019m telling you the truth.\nIt was that fellow, a friend of mine, that I worked with in the studio, you know, UFA.\u201d\nAnd I said, \u201cLook, it\u2019s Sunday morning. Let\u2019s take the day off. We\u2019ll take a jeep, and you and I\nand a driver, we\u2019ll just drive around the whole day in Berlin.\u201d Because, that\u2019s right, he said,\n\u201cSomeone told me that he survived and that he\u2019s back. Someone said they saw him in Berlin, just\na few days ago, and thank God, apparently he\u2019s alive.\u201d So I said, \u201cCurt, let\u2019s take the day off.\nAnd we\u2019re going to look for this Jew in the attic.\u201d And we did. So we start out, and he noticed\nsome girl in Nuremberg, and we go there and we find her \u2014 it was incredible we could find\nanybody, with how they were living \u2014 the place was a total disaster \u2014 people were living 1n holes\nand doorways and Christ knows, anyway this first girl says, \u201cI heard that too.\u201d\nAnd I (referenced?) this person, we went to see him, it was amazing we\u2019d find anybody but there\nwas still, even with everything down, there was a kind of amazing word of mouth. People\nseemed to know where other people were. And to cut this short \u2014 after a few hours of going\nfrom one (street?) to another, and finally to his actual, we found his own girlfriend, who had\nsurvived the war. She lived all the way through the war in Berlin. And she said, \u201cYes, he is,\nhe\u2019s definitely here.\u201d And she told us where she thought he was. And we went there. And here\ncomes this little Jewish guy, he was still in his concentration camp stripes and still \u2014 he out,\nand he sees Curt, he hugs Curt, and he says to me, \u201cThis man saved my life. I actually lived in\nhis attic.\u201d\nAnd we finally found a real Jew in the attic. And apparently Curt was telling the truth the whole\ntime. And from that time on, I became very, now I believed, now I knew that Curt was for real\nand that he really, he told me that Fritz Lang left, and he tried to leave, and got stopped, or\nsomething. He wasn\u2019t able to leave. He was hoping to leave, too. Now I believed him. Now I\nthought that Walter Rothe was a Nazi rat. But it really was an unbelievable story.",
        "Oh gosh, yes, oh God, yes. Oh absolutely, we thought, after all, if we\u2019d been here, Warsaw or\nanywhere \u2014 We\u2019d be one of these poor wretches in the ovens, oh yes.\nOne funny thing happened in Wannsee. We were in this big mansion, really, in Wannsee. And\nwe just went in one day and said, \u201cWe\u2019re staying here.\u201d And they, the woman was very well-to-\ndo and she still had her servants and everybody living in the big house in Wannsee. Out in the\nback of the little garden where there was a freshly dug grave that we could see, and apparently\nthat was her husband. We never really got clear on what the circumstances were, but they were\nobviously very well connected; they had done very nicely, until one day I got a bad cold, and I\nstayed in bed, I was in this big | bedroom with my sniffles. And she and the staff were very\nconcerned about me. They were taking care of me, the poor thing. And they were bringing me\ntea and chicken soup and all kinds of things. And I thought to myself, \u201cIf this had been last year,\nthey would have been killing me, and now they\u2019re taking care of my cold.\u201d I never told them\nabout the Jewishness or anything. But it struck me funny, the concern they showed for me.\n(Did you or your brother experience any hostility from Germans in the initial encounters when\nyou started looking for materials?)\nNot really. The reaction I got was more, asking people, there\u2019d be kind of a sullen \u2014 some, they\nwere worried. My impression was, Raye, that they were more defensive in being worried they\nmight be involved. They were like Just like the Jew in the attic \u2014 the reverse of that was no one\nto have heard of a concentration camp.\nI went to Dachau. It must have been two miles outside of Dachau, and I got lost, and I asked the\nway to the Dachau concentration camp. And this was two miles away. They had never heard of\nit. They didn\u2019t know what I was talking about. That was the attitude \u2014 more than hostility, was, I\nwould say, their most concern was saving their own skin.",
        "And, and Wolf was, Wolf was hung. I think he was the only one there, I think, that was hung.\nThe others there got sentences, different, but depending on their importance, on their\ninvolvement.\n[Footnote: The Dachau Commander on trial was named Weiss \u2014 Martin Gottfried. A\nprosecution witness named Wolf demonstrated punishment on the whipping block at Dachau.\n[Footnote: 42 were charged; 40 stood trial.

It began\nNov. 15, 1945 and ran to December 13, 1945.]\nI was only there to see how the trial was run, sort of getting ready for Nuremberg, which was of\ncourse on a much, much higher scale.",
        "Yeah. I would not say very closely, no. I, of course I was in touch with Stuart and would see\nStuart from time to time in New York, and I think once or twice I went out and saw Pare with\nStuart and just heard what they were doing. I forget if they asked me anything, but they might\nhave. But it was more like that, but it, I was not in constant touch, but I was very aware of\nStuart\u2019s work and aware of the troubles he was having, that Sandra explained last night in much\nmore detail, but I was aware of all the back and forth troubles with the, uh, with the group in, in\nGermany that were trying to stop the film and so forth.",
        "Sleep? I don\u2019t think any of us every slept very much. I really don\u2019t. We were very hopped up.\nWe were so excited, and also driven. The phone calls from Nuremberg were a nightmare. When\nthe phone rang from Nuremberg, I would grit my teeth \u2014 I knew what was coming. And we\nwere, we lived really in, in fear that any moment, they would say, \u201cPack it in, we\u2019ll do without\nthe film.\u201d We were very afraid that might happen, and so we all went on, on very little sleep,\nvery little sleep.

        "And she\u2019d say, \u201cHow long can you really, sort of a Don Quixote act, this is getting ridiculous,\nhow many times can you go to Watts and nobody shows up?\u201d And I said \u201cWell, I think I'll just\nwait till, Pll give it from August until Thanksgiving.\u201d This is now into, maybe early October.\nAnd I said, \u201cIf nobody shows up by Thanksgiving ok, I'll, uh, PIl pack it in.\u201d\nFinally, finally, the next time I went down, this one guy came.

And, uh, and this Charles sat opposite me and the young man sat right up, right next to\nme and just staring right at me. It was a, uh, strange, just stared at me. And, uh, anyway, I\nbrought down Claude Brown\u2019s book, Manchild in the Promised Land and this guy Charles said,\n\u201cWhat is all this? What are you up to? What are you trying to do?\u201d He was rather, a little bit\nbelligerent, challenging, and I said, \u201c\u201cThere\u2019s no mystery to it, I\u2019m trying to start a writer\u2019s\nworkshop.\u201d\nAnd I then read to him some excerpts from Manchild in a Troubled Land, and it was a little bit\nabout, about Claude at the age of about 10, and, uh, there\u2019s been a riot in, in, uh, in Harlem, and\nhe\u2019s too small to go to it but his big brother\u2019s saying, \u201cBoy it was great. We got a, we got a\ntelevision set, and a radio and this and that,\u201d and, um, little Claude says, he writes this, \u201cGee, that\nsounds like such fun. When can we have another one, when can we have another riot?\u201d And\nwhen I read that out loud to him, his reaction was amazing, he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were\nallowed to write that in a book!\u201d He said, \u201cWould they arrest him for that?\u201d And I said, \u201cNot\nonly not arrest him, this book is a major bestseller. He\u2019s making a lot of money out of this\nbook.\u201d\nWell, he was just amazed. And that was, that really opened the door, I think he went back,\nbecause next the day, next Wednesday, two or three people showed up with him, I think,\nincluding Johnny Scott and a few other young poets. I\u2019Il make this short, but what they showed\nme \u2014I couldn\u2019t believe. Their work was so goddamn good. Johnny Scott was a goddamn\ngenius. I read some the other day, it\u2019s so good, and some of the others were too. And that was\nthe beginning.\nI then went to Los Angeles magazine and told them about this, and I showed them the work, and\nso they ran a piece with a page of their poetry and, uh, Jime Magazine picked up on it, did a big\nstory \u2014 also running a page of Johnny Scott and Jimmy Sherman, Sammy Harris, all these young\npoets. And for that to be in Time Magazine was a huge, huge thing. And they were offered\nmoney. Then it got bigger and bigger, and it\u2019s still going. We have now, now we have in New\nYork, and when I got to New York I started it there, and we now have the Frederick Douglass\nCreative Arts Center on, uh, on 96\" Street. And there we have a faculty of twenty, and it\u2019s, it\u2019s\nmuch more, much more structured now. Now it\u2019s a real writing school, and, uh, it\u2019s going very\nstrong.",
