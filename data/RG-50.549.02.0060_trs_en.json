        "Answer: Okay, mm-hm, my name is Guta Blass Weintraub. I was born in Poland, in the\ncity of Lodz, the second largest city of Poland, and I lived there all the time, until the\nbeginning of the war. My family consisted of four people all together, myself, my\nbrother, my mother, my father. We were a middle class family, maybe slightly upper\nmiddle. And life was good. That -- that\u2019s all I remember at that time, is little by little it\nstarted getting worse. To -- to -- to kind of jump from one to another, okay.",
        "Question: Well, can you tell me the names of your parents and brother?",
        "A: Uh-huh. My parents name is Noah Blass, my father. Then my mother was Bluma\nBlass. Her maiden name was Goldvasser, and what -- what else?",
        "Q: Your brother\u2019s name?",
        "A: Oh, my brother\u2019s. My brother\u2019s name was Moshe Ben Blass. It\u2019s Hebrew names, and\nthey were translated int-into Monyek Blass.",
        "Q: And was he younger or older than you?",
        "A: He was a year and a half younger than I am, and he died unfortunately, in a camp near\nAuschwitz, a camp for men, Brunow. He was there with my father, and after the war I\nfound out that they both died there. That\u2019s about all I heard about them.",
        "Q: Were you a particularly religious family?",
        "A: Comparing to religious -- being religious here, and being religious in Europe was that\nthe -- medium. I mean, just observant Jew, when they came to the States, seemed to be as\nreligious as the Orthodox ones, practically, because we took our religion very seriously,\nwhether we observed to the point where it was fanatic. So, of course, we observed it, but\nnot to the point a Hassidim did. So when we came here, I felt myself being quite\nreligious. And we belonged to a synagogue here, and -- I lived in Charleston, and -- by\nthe way. I moved right after I came to the States, I moved to Charleston, South Carolina,\nand we made our life over there. And of course we -- the first thing where we did, we\nbelonged to a synagogue, and it was the Orthodox synagogue of -- of Charleston.",
        "Q: But back when you were a child, your family wasn\u2019t particularly --",
        "A: Oh well, I -- we were observant, quite observant. We did not do anything that wasn\u2019t\nsupposed to, but the -- the difference may be -- the visible difference was that my father\nwore just regular clothes that everybody is wearing, where the Hassidim, the Orthodox --\nultra Orthodox were wearing their, you know, religious habits, and wha -- whatever. So\nthat was the only -- you -- you could distinguish a extremely religious Jew from just a\nreligious Jew. And of course there were Jewish people who were not observant at all, but\nthey -- everybody knew, and they consider themself being Jewish, but they were not\nobservant as we were.",
        "Q: Can you talk about your relationship with your parents? Were you very close to them?",
        "A: Well, like I said, my life was wonderful when I was growing up. We had a very close\nrelationship, very much so with my mother, and my father. I admired my father a great\ndeal. He -- he was el -- actually living, during World War Two in Germany. He spoke --\nspoke eng -- I mean, G-German very well. And I learned to speak German from him, and\n-- and -- well, my brother was too small to -- to learn German, but -- and then when the\nwar broke out, of course, I was frightened because I -- everything that was happening was\nso scary and unfamiliar to me that I -- I really didn\u2019t know how to look at it. So I remem -\n- remember my father always telling me, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the German are -- are not going\nto hurt anybody. They are intelligent, educated people, and they will not harm anybod-\nbody.\u201d The intelligence and education might apply to them, but the fact of the way they\nbehaved like animals, like you know, like -- like -- that remind me actually when -- when\nthere was a hunt -- you know, rabbit hunt, or deer hunt, or whatever it is in the English\nway, where they let all the dogs run after them, that just remind me of the situation in --\nin Germany.",
        "Q: Can you talk about life in the -- and I might be pronouncing this wrong, the wear --\nvearts --",
        "A: Yeah, it is a small town.",
        "Q: Ghetto, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: How long were you there, and -- and what was it like there?",
        "A: Okay, I like to describe the town. This was a small town with quite a large Jewish\npopulation. When the war broke out, they were supposed to -- or they were, actually,\nmaking a ghetto in -- in Lodz. And of course my -- my father, that was his decision, and\nwe ga -- went along with it, decided that we would move to the small town, maybe the\nGermans will not get there as fast as they get first to the large cities, which was really the\nfact. And also the reason we went to Vearshmeek was because my mother was born in\nVearshmeek, and she still had rel-relatives over there, sisters and -- yeah, sisters mainly,\nand so on. So we moved to Vearshmeek, and in the beginning it sim -- seemed to be\nokay, but the fact was that -- that our life changed because of not having proper living\nconditions and quarters and so on. So it was difficult, and of course my father\u2019s\nlivelihood ceased to exist, because he couldn\u2019t do what he did at home. And at home my\nfather had a factory of military uniforms. In other words, it was Boy Scouts, tha -- I mean\nthat led to it, Boy Scout, prepartor -- preparatory military, and then he also branched out\nto have sports goods like skiing outfits, and so on. So we were doing well, and I don\u2019t\nthink he had accumulated a fortune anywhere, or anything, unless I don\u2019t know. But we\nhad to leave everything, and just move there. My father organized for a wagon drawn by\ntwo horses, and we took what we could, and the -- just went, and of course we were very\nlucky, because somehow we were not disturb along the -- the way to -- you know, cause\nit could have been easily that the Germans would stop us and -- and suspect us of doing\nsomething wrong and so on. So we were not stopped, and we went straight to\nVearshmeek.",
        "Q: What were the living quarters like there for you?",
        "A: In Vearshmeek?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Well, we just occu -- well, first of all, the places in Vearshmeek -- it\u2019s a small town\ncomparing to -- to the large city, where you have -- we didn\u2019t have skyscraper-scrapers,\nbut we had buildings three, four, five story tall, and -- and in -- in Vearshmeek, the\nmajority of the buildings were wooden buildings, short, you know, one story, or whatever\nit is. So, no water in -- in the house, no bathrooms, and so on, so of course, it was quite a\ndifference. But it would have been all been good if 1 -- if 1t had not end the way it ended.\nAnd also, it was difficult to make ends meet. When -- during that time in Vearshmeek, I\nwas 14 years old or so, I -- with a friend of mine, we decided to make -- organize a\nkindergarten, which we did in -- in my apartment. My apartment consisted of a kitchen,\nand a larger room where the beds were, and table, whatever, just -- but we managed\nsomewhat, and we had a kindergarten, and people were very happy to -- to bring the\nchildren, because they were able to do other things, although their businesses and so on\ndid not -- did not -- almost didn\u2019t exist. But still, they were glad to have the children\naway, so I was earning some money. It was not a great deal, but 1t was enough to -- to\nbuy food, which was the most important thing at that time. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: An-And so you did have enough food. And what was sanitation like 1-in the --",
        "A: Sanitation, well, like I said, there were no bathrooms, there were no -- there\u2019s no\nwater, but with all this, you get used to it. When the water was brought in, we used our s -\n- the sanitation was basically almost like before, but the fact was that it was a little harder\nto obtain it, you know, to -- to work at 1t, cause water had to be brought in, and -- and\nthey had outies on -- in the backyard and whatever it is. So that\u2019s the way -- that\u2019s the\nonly way. If we were left alone in peace, we would have actually adapted to it, but every\nday they had different regulations, and finally they formed a ghetto, where at this -- to\nthis point, there was no ghetto in the city, and then they made a ghetto. Luck -- lucky\nenough where we lived. And this area was going to be part of the ghetto, so we didn\u2019t\nhave to move. But many other people had to move, and what happened then, they made\nthem move with us. In other words, we had the kitchen, and th -- the bedroom, which was\na little bit larger than -- than normally, so we had to share this with another family, 1t was\na family of a mother and daughter, and a husband, and a grandmother, and they all were\ntogether with us. And things begin to -- begin to be quite difficult.",
        "Q: You were doing some teaching at the kindergarten?",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "Q: You were doing some teaching w -- at the kindergarten?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: What about your own education?",
        "A: I started a w -- [had half a year of high school. I started -- I finished the -- you know,\npublic school, and then I went to a pu -- to a private school. And -- but I always wanted to\nlearn, and I always -- and my parents especially, were very particular, as far as our\neducation is concerned. So I know -- I had a teacher, a -- a group, in group studies where\nI was taking French. I tried to improve on German, I was taking Latin. I wa -- anything,\nanything just cause I was so hungry for knowledge. And we also, like I said, we took\nHebrew, because my -- my father wanted my brother to -- to learn Hebrew, so we were --\na man was coming for a half an hour, whatever it 1s, and was teaching us Hebrew, and --\nmy -- my brother and myself. So -- actually -- and then I was teaching myself a lot of\nthings, cause I was always curious, and so -- so that -- that was my education.",
        "Q: How long did you stay in -- in this ghetto?",
        "A: In this town, we were until 19 -- ninet -- beginning of 19 four -- four -- well, maybe a\nlittle -- in 1942, beginning of 1942. And at that time, they evidently wanted to -- to get\neverybody out, sent the majority of people to -- to concentration camp, and they had two\nfactories over there in Vearshmeek. One was a woodwork factory, which unbelievably\nbelonged to my first cousin. A big plant, you know, I don\u2019t know how many acres of\nland, with wood, and -- and so on. And they have a -- a tremendous hall where they had\nmachinery to cut and polish, and whatever it is. And that woodwork factory was taken\nover by the Germans to -- and transferred to produce articles and you know, for the war.\nLike, for example, they manufactured ammunition boxes, stretchers, and stuff like that.\nSo they took it over completely. Of course, my cousin and his family were shot during\nthat time. And of course, I don\u2019t know if they had any heirs to -- to claim it or whatever it\nis, but that was the situation. And of course then, like at the end of -- I may wrong as far\nas timing 1s concerned, but 1t might have been the end of \u201943, or maybe early beginning\nof \u201944, where they dissolved the camp where we were. We were working there, and I-\nliving there, and whatever it is. They arranged a area where we were living, like for\nexample men in one tremendous room, you know, in bunk beds, and women in the other\none. So it was like a barrack, mostly. And -- and we also received one meal a day of\ncooked -- cooked food, and then the rest of it we had to organize ourselves, so some\npeople who were from the city had brought in money, and they, since they knew the non-\nJewish people on the outside, they were elbo -- able to communicate with them, and get --\nget them to bring money for -- bring food for money, so for them it was easier. For\nmyself and my family it was harder, but we survived.",
        "Q: How long were you in the village all totaled, before you went to the work camp?",
        "A: Well, we -- we got there the very end of 1939, you know. That -- that would have been\nbecause they said they were going to close the ghetto in Lodz in 1940. So we just took off\nbefore the closing of the ghetto, because we knew -- or we had an idea that once we are\nclosed in the ghetto, we wouldn\u2019t be able to get out. So that\u2019s what happened.",
        "Q: I want to go back and ask you --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- one other question about your --",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: -- family environment. W-Were y -- were your parents, or was the family particularly\npolitical in any way, or -- what were your politics?",
        "A: It was -- 1-in those days, it was not -- there was no possibility from my point of view,\nand for what I remember, for any Jewish person to be political We just did what we\nsupposed to do, what we were oud -- allowed to do, and th-there was -- and if there -- we\nwere political, it would have been in the area of -- of Judaism, and speaking of Palestine\nat that time, and -- and so on. But other than that, we had no -- not much to say as far as\nthe politics of the country were concerned.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to jump ahead here, because we\u2019re covering some old ground --",
        "A: Fine.",
        "Q: -- and your -- your doing a very wonderful job of --",
        "A: Lam? I --",
        "Q: -- cleaning it up [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- that\u2019s all I remember.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You ask me about it in a year, most probably won\u2019t.",
        "Q: One of the things that -- that we wanted to clarify was when you got to -- I\u2019m -- and\nI\u2019m probably pronouncing --",
        "A: Vearshmeek.",
        "Q: No, mosha -- Moshakow.",
        "A: Yeah? Myoufka. Oh, that was -- okay, first of all I want to make it clear. In -- before\nthey expelled us, before those, you know, how it -- I --",
        "Q: Deported?",
        "A: Yeah, how do you say they -- evacuation, okay. Now, before the ev-evacuation from\nVearshmeek, we had -- Vearshmeek was a -- it was like a twin city. It -- one part was\nVearshmeek, and the other part was called Starachowice. Starachowice were -- was when\n-- where they had a sealed factory. I don\u2019t know what they did before the war in it, but\nevidently things for economy, for a -- you know, whatever it is, from -- for Poland. But\nwhen the Germans came in, they transferred that factory it -- into doing I don\u2019t know,\nmaybe bullets, maybe this, maybe that, I have no idea. So this is one place, okay. You\nspeaking of Myoufka, it was just a place high up on a -- on a big hill in the city of\nStarachowice, where they arrange for some reason, which is amazing because I -- I really\ndon\u2019t know how they could have done it so fast, unless this area was used for something\nelse -- they had little cabins -- cabins there and la -- in areas, and they put all of us,\nduring the evacuation of Vearshmeek, they put part of us there, and then a part of us in\nanother, similar place where they had barracks built. They evidently had an idea that this\nis what they were going to do, because they had to work from the beginning to be able to\n-- to have all this done.",
        "Q: One of the things that we wanted to have you go over was the attack of the guard, a\nfellow named Shrot.",
        "A: Oh, well that was about the same time when they evacuated us -- us from our -- the\nplace in Polish was named Tartuck. In German, it was called Zagaverker. It all means a f\n-- a wood -- wood factory, okay? When they expelled us from over there, they put us all -\n- there was a market, like every small city in Europe, and even the larger cities had\nmarketplaces, and they -- you know, chased us all through the marketplace, put us in\nrows and so on, and a -- did something the same what they did later on in concentration\ncamp, like making a selection. This one here, this one there, wi -- which meant -- later on\nwe found out, the younger people were left to work in the places that were still available,\nand they were producing goods for the German -- for the Germans, and the older ones\nwere moved straight on the trains, and they moved them to Auschwitz and other\nconcentration camps. Okay, well I was among them, and of course, we were lucky\nsomewhat. When they took me and my brother, and -- on one side, they put my parents\non the other side, I knew what was happening. I mean, you just -- 1t was a instinct that\ntold me what was happening. So, when they were running among -- there were hundreds\nand thousands of people, actually, because there was a great number of people that they\nsend from other cities to our -- to -- to Vearshmeek, because they did it very\nsystematically. Not just come to every city, and try to dig out to -- whatever number of\nJews was there. But they concentrated all the Jews from surrounding areas, and villages,\nand little towns, into one which was little largest -- larger. And then from over there they\nmade the selection and shipped the number of people to -- to a concentration camp, the\nremaining number they situated in different areas for work. And prior to it, you know,\nduring that selection, I was lucky because somehow -- I-I was very brave when I -- when\nI was young, I didn\u2019t feel like anybody could destroy me. You know, when you -- you are\nyoung, you just -- so I grabbed my parents from the lo -- line nearby, and pulled them in\nfront of me, and lucky enough nobody repla -- placed them back in the same place, and\nwe survived for awhile in this camp for -- I think we were there for almost two years.",
        "Q: Can you tell about that attack on the guard? A guard named -- 1s it Shrot?",
        "A: Shrot, yes.",
        "Q: Can you tell me?",
        "A: Yes, well you see, when we -- when they -- that was after the -- after they evacuated\nus, after the time we lived already on -- on a ta -- on the Tartuck, where the -- you know,\nwhere we work, after that they decided to evacuate us, and put us in concentration camps.\nSo they one day, without any warning, without anything, they -- they arrived wi -- with\nbuses, trucks that were covered with -- with canopy or whatever it is, and they just took\nus. They didn\u2019t even allow us to take anything that we wanted, which is a normal reaction\nof anyone that wants to take their things with them. W -- and packed us on the wagons,\nand we had no idea where we were going. So -- back -- what they did, they could not take\nus right away to the -- to the wagon -- to the trains to be send away, so they temporarily,\nfor two, three days, put -- put us in this little area where they had the barracks built, and\nleft us over there. And wh -- we waited for the train. When we got there, they had a big\narea which was like a yard, you know, and then the barracks were on the side. And when\nwe got there, the area that was supposed to be the yard had two great, long ditches dug on\n-- like between, you know, six or so yards between each other. And we couldn\u2019t\nunderstand what it was, but quickly we -- we find out -- found out what it was, cause they\ntold us right away the man should stand on one side of one ditch, the women on the other\nside of that ditch. And then this man that I was speaking about shouted who was -- he\nwas actually a -- from Ukraine, and -- and they -- in the beginning of the war the\nGermans solicited the -- the Ukraines and give them -- you know, to -- to belong -- to do\nthe dirty work, you know, and have sort of identifying clothes like a -- to make -- make\nus understand that they belong to the German army. Well these people did all the dirty\nwork, so they were, at that time, going to be the ones that were going to execute what the\nGermans told them to do. So, when we were standing on both sides, the German here,\nthis Shrot, started speaking in German, and said, \u201cYou have one minute to -- to be -- to\nsay your prayers, and you going to be shot.\u201d Just plainly, like that. Naturally, you can just\nimagine what happens to -- to a person when you hear something like that. We were all\nlike paralyzed. I mean, I -- I couldn\u2019t even move. The only thing was that my brain was\nworking. And when I looked at my mother, I -- and I saw her -- her -- her face was white\nlike a sheet of paper, and her heart was -- you c -- you could see it was, you know,\nbeating so hard I could almost hear it. And I guess prompted me to do something that\nmaybe normally I wouldn\u2019t do. I was so frightened for her and -- and they were the only\nones that I had. So I -- when he finished talking, I simply, without even thinking any\nmore, I jumped out, and he was standing us -- oh, in front of me, in front of the --\nbetween the two graves, and I jumped, and I jumped on his back, and grabbed him by his\nneck, and I-I always had long fingernails, and I -- you know, pressed as hard as I could.\nI\u2019m sure that I have wounded him in some areas. And I realized that if I -- I -- I didn\u2019t\nknow what else to do, I had no gun or anything. And the only thing I -- I -- at that\nmoment, my instinct told me just to cling on his back li -- on his back like that, that at --\nat a point like this, he will not be able to do anything to me. Which proved to be actually\ncorrect, because the Germans sta -- or the Ukraines started screaming, \u201cShoot her, shoot\nher.\u201d But of course, if they shot me, they would have sh-shot him, too, so tho -- they\ndidn\u2019t do it. In the meantime, as I was lying there -- as I was al -- still clinging to him,\nfinally we both fell down, and they -- they came and they pulled him away from me. As\nthey pulled him away, I realized that, as far as my life was concerned is -- it was finished.\nBut it took all the situation, and all the development, took so much time, that it was\ngetting dark outsir -- outside already. And then, when they pulled him away, they decided\nto shoot me. So they came to him, they told him shoot the beast, you know. In German is,\nsheeza de bestia, means shoot the be -- beast. And he said I -- and I heard it, m-my\nEnglish was good, and I could understand every word he was saying, and he said, \u201cNo, I\nwill not shoot her yet. She must,\u201d -- the word was edwastonsin, must perform, or dance,\nor -- what he meant by it is I -- he wanted me to -- to beg for our life and you know, go\ncrazy and kiss his feet, or whatever he planned. So he said, \u201cShe must dance a little\nbefore I shoot her.\u201d Finally -- and as I fell, I -- I decided I was not going to move no\nmatter what happens, that I\u2019m not going to budge. So they checked me, checked my\npulse, checked this, and it was -- stupid idiot couldn\u2019t even find a pulse, so they decided\nthat I was dead. And what happened --",
        "Q: Well, had they shot you at that point?",
        "A: Not yet, not yet. But then, one person, who became my sister-in-law later --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: But then one person, who became my sister-in-law later, a lady, she started crying,\nyou know, because people didn\u2019t know how to react. They didn\u2019t know what was good to\nsay, and what was bad to say. So she started crying, \u201cPlease help her, she must have just\nfainted.\u201d And you know, when I heard her say that -- I still remember it to this -- you\nknow, you remember every reaction, every -- what-whatever I felt. And she -- and I said\nto m-m -- was thinking to myself, \u201cMy God, please don\u2019t say anything, I don\u2019t want them\nto know that I am alive.\u201d And then when they finally pulled me away, they marched all\nthe people into the empty barracks that they had, you know, left, you know, unoccupied.\nAnd -- and there were two barracks, and they filled the two barracks, you know, they had\nbunkbeds over there. The amount of people from our camp was about 300, so it wasn\u2019t\nsuch a great number. And they put us in the barracks. I was still lying down on the\nground, and suddenly the -- 1t was dark already, and we heard American planes -- or were\n-- they were Russian planes, actually. They were cruising around and -- and dropping\nbombs. So we -- we knew about it, and we were quite aware of it. So they didn\u2019t do\nanything, and they had searchlights that they stopped using, because they were afraid that\nthey were going to bomb -- bomb us. And later, when the bombing stopped, they turned\non the searchlight, and they were going round and round, which would put lights on me,\ntoo, on the area where I was lying down. Anyhow, at that time, I realized, and I got used\nto the dark, and I saw the barracks, I had no idea that the people were marched into the\nbarracks at that time. But I was thinking, and I se -- and they were on stilts. So I had no\nother place where I could crawl to hide, and I just thought that if I do that, maybe that\nwill help, and I did that. And as I crawled under the barrack, I heard people walk, and I\nheard voices, even. And I recognized Polish, and Jewish, and I -- I -- I realized that these\nwere the people that I came with. Because at first I thought maybe they were other Jews\nfrom some other places, and -- and so on. And so anyhow, I still was sitting under the\nbarrack, and -- and I felt every time I was breathing, I felt I -- I was picking the whole\nbarrack on my back, you know. And nothing was happening after, you know, until\nmorning. At dusk in -- I realized -- and I was evidently not far from the little stairs, from\nthe you know, barrack. And I saw people walking down, and I saw they were having, you\nknow, all shoes, and you know, clogs, and this and that, which did not indicate that they\nwere Ss -- people that came from other places, that they were inmates from the -- from a\ncamp. And as I saw this, I decided I will step out, and -- I couldn\u2019t sit there underneath\nthe ba -- the barrack forever. So I stepped out, and as I came out from underneath the\nbarrack, here were stairs, and where I came out of the barrack, there was my father, my\nmother, my brother, all in tears, and terrified. Because, what happened -- evidently they\nwere communicating at night, and realizing that I -- my body was not in the same place\nwhere they shot me. Did I mention about the shooting before? No, I did not, you see,\nthat\u2019s what happens when you don\u2019t -- don\u2019t have a -- a schedule. Anyhow, after they put\nthe people in the barracks, you know, after they marched them there, the guy came over\nand shot me. And my head was like this. Now you most probably can still see a scar. I\ncan see it.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I can see it. It was right here. But you know, so many years, and whatever. So when --\nhe shot me, and since my face was only halfway exposed, and the other half was -- was,\nyou know, flush to the ground, he -- when he shot me, the bullet grazed my forehead, and\nI came from one point, out through the other. So I wasn\u2019t hurt greatly, or anything and --\nand it didn\u2019t even hurt for some reason, I don\u2019t know why. Maybe I was too excited. And",
        "Q: Was this the f -- who was the person who shot you?",
        "A: Shrot.",
        "Q: Shrot?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And how close a range was he?",
        "A: Well, he was standing over me, that\u2019s how close, and -- and he missed it. Because it\ncould have been obvious that when he\u2019s going to shoot me, he will shoot me right -- you\nknow, I -- right in my head all -- my temple, and be finished with it, but he did not.\nMaybe he was scared for his own life because they we -- started bombing.",
        "Q: And was he the only one around at that point?",
        "A: Wh-Who?",
        "Q: Just he and you, you were lying there, and --",
        "A: Y -- no, they -- there were the other -- no, the other ones, the other Ukrainians, that\nthey were packing everybody in the barracks. Now, there might have been a couple other\nones with him. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m sure there were, because since I wasn\u2019t killed yet, you\nknow, they thought maybe I\u2019Il jump up again. So -- and then they all left. But when the\nbombings stopped, they evidently, like I said, communicated among them, and they\nrealized that my body was missing. So, what they assumed that the Jewish people took\nme, and hid me. And the Jewish people when they found out -- they also found out that I\nwasn\u2019t there, because they came and asked them where I am, and I was still under the\nbarrack. So they said they didn\u2019t know. So they didn\u2019t -- so the Jews thought that the\nGermans took me, that, you know, I was dead and the Germans took me, and wanted to\ncover up -- because basically what we later found out, that they did not have a order to\nshoot all the people. And this is what they wanted to do. Without the order they would\nhave shot all of us, have -- has -- ha -- it wasn\u2019t for the incident and the situation that I\nsomewhat created not -- not knowing they would have shot all of us. But since the time\nlapsed, and it got dark, and the bombing started, they were worrying about their own\nlives, and therefore, all this stopped. And they didn\u2019t want to leave us on the grounds,\nbecause with a mass of people like that, you never know what they may do. So they were\nafraid of a riot, that they wouldn\u2019t be able to control us. So they put the people in the\nbarracks. And then -- of course, in the morning when I got out from the -- under the\nbarrack, I was shot. My face -- my face was somewhat bloody, but I scraped off the mo --\nmost of it, because I was curious what it was, and since I had one free hand to be able to\nmove, so I -- I touched it, and I realized that I wasn\u2019t hurt badly, and I -- and I am still\nalive. So when I c-came out, my parents were all in tears, and shock, and then when they\nrealize -- they all realize that I am alive, their first instinct was to -- to get rid of me\nsomewhat. I mean, not that they wanted to kill me or anything like that, but to hide me.\nAnd they decided to hide me under a mattress. It was not a mattress, but it was straw -- to\nhide me under the straw that -- you know. And the barrack was a long building, on both\nside were bunkbeds. And here in the middle was like an alley, you know, all the way\ndown. So they marched me, and they -- they put me under the straw. And -- all it was a\nfew minutes later, or it seemed like a few minutes later, this Shrot came, and he was\nentering the barrack from wa -- from one end, and walking with a gun in his hand, and\nscreaming, \u201cWo ist da bestia?\u201d Where 1s the beast. If you don\u2019t produce her right --\nimmediately, I\u2019m going to shoot everybody else. So I heard it, and I just knew it was bad,\nand I didn\u2019t want anything to happen to anybody else, and my parents and my brother. So\nI stepped out from it, and I knew that was the end of it, and I just simply decided that I\nam not going to be scared, that I am going to be proud, and I stepped out, and I said in\nGerman, \u201cHere I am.\u201d And then he grabbed me. Didn\u2019t shoot me. Evidently he had -- he\nhad orders from the German that was in charge of all the barracks, of all the Jews in\nVearshmeek. So he definitely had the orders not to shoot me. And so he grabbed me by\nmy hand, pulled me out and the -- the area -- the camp was wired all around with, I think,\nelectric wires, if I\u2019m not mistaken. And they -- he pulled me out and took me beyond the\nwires, you know, and pushed me in -- into a cab -- small cabin where they ke -- had wood\nfor fire and coal and so on. Was just a barely -- a place that I barely could -- could fit,\nbecause it was loaded with wood and lumber. And here I was, and then when he closed\nthe -- the -- locked the -- the cabin, he started shooting in the air, bang, bang, bang, you\nknow. And the people 1n con -- in the camp had said okay, this is the end of me because\nhe shot me. Well, that did not happen. A few minutes later, they send over the -- the\ncommander of the whole area, and he came in in his big, shiny boots, and guns, and\neverything, and he started speaking to me because he couldn\u2019t understand what happened\nto me. He saw a -- a wound right here, and he cou -- he says, \u201c\u201cWh-What happened to\nyou?\u201d So I says I -- and I tried to kind of minimize the whole thing and make it into\nsomething else, that -- not that I jumped him, that I wanted to play -- pray for my safety,\nand -- and he should leave me. As -- so I kind of did not say anything, I said I don\u2019t\nknow. Then he went to the back of my head, because he wanted to see if the bullet came\nout through there. I had a wound over there, but the -- the wound was from the butt of the\nrifle, you know, where they hit me before he shot me. So he couldn\u2019t understand, and he\nsays, \u201cWell, how did the bullet come?\u201d And he spoke to me German. \u201cHow did the bullet\ncome here, and then -- and -- and you are still here?\u2019 I -- I still told him that I didn\u2019t\nknow. But anyhow, at that point, when he finished talking to me, questioning me and so\non, he took me out, and of all the things, he took me near the barracks where they had a\nfirst aid station, you know, you know, kind of a improvised -- just anything. And he took\nme over there and had the people clean out -- clean up the wound, and put iodine,\nwhatever they did, and -- and bandage, and that\u2019s all. And then they put me in the\nbarracks, okay? That was one phase. And then while I wa -- I was in the barracks, we --\nwe were waiting, actually, for the -- for the trains to come. Th-The train -- the tra --\nrailroad tracks were outside the camp, and we were waiting for the trains to come.\nWhatever -- what actually happened, since the bombing, some of the tracks were\ndestroyed, and they could not come, so they had to do it the next day. So they came,\neverybody was gathering around, we ha -- and they thought it was a miracle, you know,\nhow Jewish people always think of a miracle. I mean, most probably other people, of\nother religion and so on will -- will kind of associate something like that with a miracle.\nSo he -- everybody was coming to me. I remember distinctly, now that -- a -- a man -- I\nmean, to me, he looked like a older man, he must have been in his early thir -- 30\u2019s, came\nto me, and by the way he was asking me questions, what happened and so on, I realized\nthat he most probably is a writer. And ch -- not changing the story, but -- but getting\nfinished with this, after the war I found this man, he lived in Israel. I found a book -- no-\nnot I, but my brother-in-law found it, cause he was working in a -- in -- in a library. He\nfound a book written by a guy named Moshe Porrot. And he was the one that wrote about\nthis incident and everything. Of course, he elaborated on it, and -- and stretched it, and\nwrote every detail of it. And after the war, when -- when I already had children and\neverything, my oldest son decided that this book, since 1t was written after the war, that it\nwas supposed to be registered at the Library of Congress, and so on. And we looked for\nit. We found the names, we found all kind of things, but we did not find the book.\nAnyhow, but it\u2019s still there, somewhere, with my name and whatever it is on it. So --",

So later, she survived\nsome time in Auschwitz, and then when they transferred us to Auschwitz, she got sick\nand when we were 1n viet -- in -- in Ravensbriick, she died over there after a few weeks.\nShe had a stroke, and she died over there. It was cold, it was February, of 19 -- 1945, I\nthink. And she -- she died, but she survived until -- until just about -- I would say about\ntwo months or so before they saved us. The Swedes came and took a number of Jewish\npeople and others -- a -- other people from the camp out, and to safety.",

And then,\nactually, it was already \u00b045, January \u00b045, cause my birthday was then, and they put us --\nfirst of all, we ha -- we were put on a march, and this march was very famous, they called\nit the Death March. Not only because ou -- of our group, but they were marching people\nfrom different camps. I -- I don\u2019t know exactly where they were marching them, but since\nit was February already -- January, February, I mean, the march actually occur --\noccurred in January, okay? So they were marching all these people, and it was snowing,\nand freezing, and -- and winters in Poland are very bad, as bad almost as in -- in some\nareas in Russia. So people were starving, and dying, and they were also dying of bullets,\nand through -- by the time we arrived anyone -- anyone to our destination, there was\nhardly anybody left. So we were -- I don\u2019t -- my mother and I were walking from\nAuschwitz on the middle of a big road, everybody -- and through villages or little towns,\nGerman towns, but everybody disappeared, and they were hidden in their houses, and we\ncould even see them trying to peek out through the windows, because they evidently had\nstrict orders not to be around. So -- and nobody was able to help us. Some people tried to\nescape, and -- but the ones who escape were anyhow killed later. So that\u2019s what\nhappened.",
        "Q: And how soon after you left Auschwitz did your mother die?",
        "A: Okay, we -- we went to -- we finally arrived in Ravensbruck, which was also a\nconcentration camp, a big one. At that time, they didn\u2019t have all of it -- all the ba --\nbarracks occupied. It was a tremendous concentration camp. Evidently they send those\npeople to -- to a crematoria in [indecipherable] so on, but they got rid of them, whatever\nway it was. So when we got there, 1t wasn\u2019t -- it wasn\u2019t all occupied, and we were put in\nsome barracks, and that was -- that was already end of -- end of January.

        "Q: And you had taken her -- some of her clothing and her hair, and I guess Arwin was\nwondering how she had all those things, the scarf, the garter belt, and her hair.",
        "A: No, no she didn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t have anything. Maybe you are talking about a spoon, and\na comb, and this and that, those things, okay. These things everybody had, because once\nwe were put in a concentration camp, they let us keep a spoon, and a -- and -- and -- and a\ncomb, and a little piece of soap. These things we had. And the clothing that we had were\nawkward clothing that were given to us by the Germans after they took our clothes away.",
        "Q: What about her hair? Cause I think you had said that you cut a little piece of her hair.",

And it was freezing, and she had evidently a\nstroke, and she died. So they made me, and a friend of mine carry her to a barrack where\nthey called it like a -- they -- hospital thing. It was not. They called it revere, which\nevidently in German it means hospital. So they asked me to take her over there. We took\nher over there, and put her on a -- on a bunkbed, and she actually was still alive, and --\nbut they would not let me attend to her. I don\u2019t know what I could have done, but they\nchased me out. So that evening, we were given -- once a day we were ga -- given food,\nyou know, soup made out of old, unpeeled potatoes, and whatever stuff 1t was. So when I\nreceived that, I took it to -- to this revere, to make sh -- make sure that maybe she would\ne-eat something. When I got into the place, there were some women that were supposed\nto be nurses, or whatever it is. And when s -- they saw me -- and they were Jewish,\nactually -- so one came to me, \u201cOh, you came to see your mother, your mother died.\u201d It\nwas a terrible shock to me, I cannot even describe it. So I ran -- no, I fainted, actually. At\nthat point when they told me this, I fainted, and the little container with soup and\neverything spilled. Then when I came to, I went to her, and -- and all I could do 1s close\nher eyes, and -- and then they told me I must leave. So you know, I wanted to have\nsomething from her. I have the hair here. And --",

        "Q: I didn\u2019t see the [indecipherable]",
        "A: You didn\u2019t see the pictures, but anyhow, they had -- took a picture of the spoon, the\ncomb, the soap, and a scarf, and the shoes. Okay, I had two shoes, both of them. And I --\nlater on, when they released -- they saved us, the Swedes came and saved us, I was able\nto take it out, although I wasn\u2019t supposed to because they were afraid of diseases. And\nyou know, we were under quarantine for a month or five weeks, or so. So I ha-had the\nshoes in a box. I donated one shoe when I went to Israel, and one I still have here. And I\nwanted to donate it to a museum here, but I didn\u2019t want them to throw it on a pile with\nanything else, but they did not want to, or couldn\u2019t accommodate me when I wanted them\nto -- to place it all individual as a -- as a group, the comb, and the scarf, and the spoon,\nand the shoes to -- and to put a name on it. It meant a awful lot to me, and 1t meant almost\nas much as having a -- a -- a burial place for my mother, a place where -- where there 1s\nevidence that she existed. Where -- to this day, actually, I am s -- very sentimental about\nthe idea of having it recorded anywhere. Like for example, unfortunately it\u2019s a sad story.\nI lost my son -- my oldest son was sick and he died like about 12 years ago, and when I\nput a -- his stone -- when they erected his stone, that tombstone, I also made sure that\nthere\u2019ll be evidence of -- of his past, so I wrote down that he was son of survivors, and\ngrandson and -- and uncle of Holocaust victims. And I put my parents name at the end to\n-- to at least have evidence, and have my parent\u2019s name, my brother\u2019s name anywhere on\n-- you know, for people -- people will not know anyhow, but the fact that it is there\nmakes me feel better. I\u2019m going to do the same thing evide -- I already have written my\nepitaph, this -- it most probably sounds awful, but this is -- and I wanted also my parents\nname on it, and evidence that they were Holocaust victims, and so on.

In other words, to a point where it\u2019s almost not -- that they don\u2019t feel, you know, the\n-- the act of killing, in other words. And if a animal is slaughtered not -- we don\u2019t use\nguns to slaughter the animal. It has to be completely painless, and totally sudden. Other\nthan that, the -- the meat is considered un -- unclean to eat, because the animal suffered,\nand so on. Well, this is as much I understand about it, okay? So -- but I don\u2019t eat meat\nanyhow, so it doesn\u2019t make any difference.",
        "Q: Well, I -- I wanted to go back and -- and pick up the story from when the Red Cross\ncame in and you were liberated. Can you --",
        "A: Yeah.",

Then also,\nfrom that point on, until the end, it would have made the most fascinating writing all\ntogether, and -- and I am upset about it, because I have it written in -- 1n parts like this\nsituation with this Shrot. So, unfortunately, maybe someday somebody\u2019s going to make\nsu -- sense of all the writings, and the tapes that I will have, and put together something.",
        "Q: You did tell much of the story in the video, leading up to liberation. Could you pick\nthe story up from there, and talk about what happened once you were liberated from the\ncamp?",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Good.",
        "A: So, when my mother died, a week later, they have send informati -- or told us that we\nare eligible to be saved, taken out of the camp. They didn\u2019t say by whom, and how, they\nonly said that we were going to be rescued, and allowed to be free, all we have to do 1s\ncome to the office, whatever -- wherever the office was, or wherever it was. That -- and\nto give our name, and all the information, and when the time comes, to -- we\u2019ll be\nshipped out. Well, I -- I didn\u2019t believe it, I really didn\u2019t because they did it on so many\noccasions that way, where they were promising the person that you going to -- you -- you\ncoming on, like for example in the camp where I was in Vearshmeek, at one time they\ncame and they told everybody, is there anybody that\u2019s got relatives in Israel? Well,\nnaturally some people did. So they found one la -- they -- the one lady that somehow was\nnot afraid to say it, and they told her, \u201cPack up all your things, whatever you have, and\nwe will -- we are going to send you to Israel.\u201d Well, it was not true, because what they\ndid, when she came out of the camp, all her things -- and she was a lady that lived in this\ntown, so she had many things with her that she was able to -- to take, and they shot her,\nand that was all. So of course that -- that memory stayed with me, and I didn\u2019t believe\nanything they -- they were doing. So when I heard this, I said oh yes, sure. But then I was\nthinking, I says, I lost my parents, lost my brother, I\u2019m by myself, where am I going to\ngo? And I -- I really didn\u2019t want to, I had no desire to live, because I was hungry all the\ntime. I was miserable, I had no place to -- to be comfortable for minute, or anything. So it\nwas very, very distressful and painful for me. So I really didn\u2019t care to live any more. So\nI says, well, that\u2019s a god -- a good way out, I am just going to go, and let them do\nwhatever they want to with me. And I signed up. And I had two friends from before the\nwar yet, that we happened to be together as school girls, and I made them do the same,\nbecause they -- they relied on what I wanted to do. So they came too, and sure enough\ntwo days later, they -- three -- three or four large buses, they looked like -- like streetcars,\nyou know, they removed all the junk, or whatever it is, for people to be able to be there,\nand they put us on there. They came with -- with some provision, food and stuff like that,\nand they took us in -- they took us to Sweden. We had to go by --",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry, what was it that you signed up for?",
        "A: To -- to g -- get on the transport to -- they should not kill me, that I -- I\u2019m -- they am --\nthey going to -- m -- a -- how do you say it, I don\u2019t know. That I was going to survive the\ncamp, and they were going to take me out to another country, or to it -- that I am going to\nbe free. And that was very hard to understand, we just didn\u2019t believe it. So, what they did",
        "Q: This is before libera -- this is before the liberation.",
        "A: Oh yeah, you see, I was liberated when I was in Sweden already. So the Swedish\ntrucks came, and they had food -- canned food, and stuff, whatever they could. And they\ngave us food, and -- and we were driving -- riding through -- by land, Denmark, and then\nto Sweden. From Denmark we had to go by -- by boat, I think. Isn\u2019t it bal -- Baltic Sea?\nAnyhow, yes, so then they took us to -- we were in Copenhagen for awhile, on the trains,\nbecause they transferred us on trains, after the buses, and we stayed there, and do -- we\nactually slept there, and they gave us food, because they were afraid of getting diseases.\nSo -- and then from the trains, we were taking on a ship. And the ship took us to a port in\nSweden. It was -- forgot the name of it, it was Checkenhaven, that\u2019s how you pronounced\nit in Swedish, it was a port in Sweden where we arrive. From there they took us to a\nspecial places, because they expected us, and they paid -- paid for us actually, with\ncoffee, penicillin, and aspirin. Those -- the Germans needed it, so they release I don\u2019t\nknow how many people, three, 400 people of different religion, Polish, an-and -- and\nJewish, and whatever it 1s, it did not make any difference at that time, but only the ones\nthat signed up for it. So they -- those were the people that they -- that they we-were\nsaved, and we were under quarantine together, and I was there with my belongings, with\nmy mother\u2019s things, and they didn\u2019t take it away. And we were there for a month, and\nthey dis -- they distributed us, or send us to different places, where they were going to\naccept us to work. Like, I was taken to a hotel in Oopsalla. It\u2019s a most historic c -- c --\ncity in s -- 1 -- in Sweden, and also the -- the oldest college -- university cities in Europe.\nSo I was there, and I worked there, and then later on I found out about my -- not relatives,\nbut I found out about my friend whom I knew before the war -- not before the war, but\nactually during the war, before the concentration camp. And he found me, and he wrote a\nletter, and this is how I came -- and he was in Germany at that time, so from Sweden they\nallowed me to go to Germany, they pol -- paid my transportation, and from -- no,\nbasically it wasn\u2019t that way. They send me to Poland because they could not send me to a\nforeign country, because they had -- they were sending me to my native country, so they\nsend me to Poland. And in Poland, m-my friend, he was -- he became my husband later\non -- knew where I was, and he send somebody to take me to Germany, and this 1s how\nwe got together, and we got married.",
        "Q: What -- what --",
        "A: Would you like to have something to drink?",
        "Q: Do you want to take a little break?",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "Q: Mm-hm. Now, during this period when you were going from Copenhagen to Poland to\nGermany, was --",
        "A: No, first we went from Copenhagen to Sweden.",
        "Q: Was the war over at this point?",
        "A: Not yet, not yet. The war ended May 10\", and we were -- we left February.",
        "Q: So who was it that was transporting you around?",
        "A: Well, first of all, we were transported by buses, and a very young Swedish man, as a\nmatter of fact, my age at that time, although some were Jewish that volunteered. You\nknow how it is, you know, just like the people that volunteer now to go to Greece, and so\non, to go to Turkey. So they volunteered, and they were driving. There was one attendant,\nand one driver, or maybe both of them and they were changing, you know, places. And\nthey took us to Copenhagen, okay? From over there, we went by train -- no, by sea to\nSweden. And from -- from Sweden -- no, we -- I lived in Sweden for about eight, nine\nmonths, and then when all this has developed that you could hear from different people,\nand about different people, it can correspond and so on, and that was the time when my\nhusband wrote a letter to the es -- ac-actually, 1t wasn\u2019t my husband that wrote the letter,\nit was my brother-in-law that wrote a letter looking for his sister-in-law, and I was n-not\neven close to being a sister-in-law or anything, but they evidently give priority to people\nthat were related, you know, and looking for them. So the letter came to me from him,\nand once we established our places, and were able to correspond, then we -- my husband\narranged what I told you before, that I had to come to Poland, from Poland I went to\nBerlin, because that\u2019s where he was. He had to wait because he found his father\nsomewhere, and he had to wait for his father to come to Berlin. So, we all came to Berlin,\nfrom Berlin we went to a camp, a -- oh my God, what was it? Buch -- no, I forgot already\nthe name of the camp. Anyhow -- Bergen-Belsen, okay, 1t was camp of Bergen-Belsen.\nAnd of course, the concentration camp was completely flattened, burned and everything.\nThere was no sign of concentration camp. After the war, you know, and th-there was so\nmuch typhus and everything. So it was burned down, and I am not sure if that was the\nonly reason that they burned it down, they just wanted to burn the evidence. And -- but\nnearby, like a couple miles away from the camp, was a camp where the Germans were --\nI don\u2019t know exactly what it was there bef-before the war, but it did not look like it was\nespecially built for them or anything, there were brick duplexes built, and th-the Germans\noccupied it, the ones that overseed the concentration camp and so on. So they occupied\nthe camp. Well, after the war, they put -- the Germans left, naturally, and they put all the\npeople from concentration camps, most of them were sick and so on, and he -- they put\nthem into all their apartments and the houses, whatever. And they immediately\nestablished -- they were doctors that came there from the States, and -- and from Canada,\nand they establish, you know, just like a little -- tiny, little complex -- living complex like\n-- it wasn\u2019t big enough to be a village, but it was like a camp, and they assisted the Jews,\nand there were all kind of newcomers that would come from concentration camps all\nover. They had no place to go, and they found out that this was the point of gathering on\nthis -- you know. So they would come over there, and that\u2019s where we lived. We lived\nthere for several months, and -- and that\u2019s where we got married, too. And when -- after\nthat, we had to go to Stuttgart. In Stuttgart, evidently, we were able to organize transport\nto [indecipherable] the United States. By then we already -- my husband established\nwhere his brother was living, and he was living in -- in Chicago. I discovered purely by\naccident, through a man that was in the army from Canada -- he lived -- cause when he\nwas telling me that his family was from Vearshmeek, and so on. So I got all excited, and\nI told him -- and I told him about my family, that my -- my grandmother lived in -- in\nToronto. So, through him I found out my relatives, and then I found the aunt, and -- and -\n- and -- in Charleston. And -- and that\u2019s how I came to Charleston. You know, it\u2019s so\nconfusing to remember about all these places, when you went, and when you came.\nAnyhow, this is -- through him, purely by accident, I found out -- I had no information,\nbut I found all this from him, and I was able to get in touch with my relatives in Canada, I\nvisited them later, and then whatever.",
        "Q: Was there any romance between Leon and you in -- in -- before the -- during the war?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. Yes, th -- not before the war. That was a funny incident, too. When we\nlived already where I -- where I told you the place, before they took us to this camp in\nVearshmeek, and at that time they were actually concentrating all the people from\ndifferent towns, no -- small villages and towns, in ve -- in Vearshmeek. And my father\nborrowed a sewing machine, that was before I -- I had kindergarten. And he decided to --\nto sew things. He didn\u2019t know how to sew, but he -- he knew how to cut, and prepare the\nmaterial, and I knew how to sew. So we did many things for people, like most of them --\npeople were coming, and they wanted like a one piece suit, and you know, pockets, and\nthis, and my husband-to-be came to our place, and he wanted my father to make a suit\nwith different hidden pockets here, and here, and here, and whatever it is. So my father\nwas doing it for him, and I was the one that was sewing it. And that was the time I met --\nmet him. He was sitting in our room with -- as big as this here, here, and a couch, and\nbed, and whatever it is. And -- and I remember when he came, he had money, he saved\nmoney. He was -- they were very rich, and we went through a -- a time where my father\nleft everything, and the money was not available, because either it was in a bank, or\nwhatever it was. So whatever he brought with them back to Vearshmeek was not that\nmuch to -- but Leon had all this, as a matter of fact, he had it hidden in a shoe -- in a heel\nof a shoe. And so -- anyhow -- so the reason I am saying it, because he came with a\nmaybe five or 10 pound bag of apples, and he was sitting on the couch, and eating one\napple after the other, which struck me funny. And we were not able to buy that, and\nmaybe bought three, four apples for everybody. One -- and so this is how I remember him\nthe first time. And then, when we were in -- you are tired already, huh? And then when\nwe were moved to the camp, he was moved to Myoufka at that time, okay? And I already\nlived in this camp, and -- but they couldn\u2019t establish themself to -- to the point where they\nwere useful to do anything, they didn\u2019t do anything, they were just in a camp, living\nthere. So he -- and there was a doctor there that was from my husband\u2019s hometown, so\nthey were friends. So they, somehow, somewhat made arrangement, my husband had\ndiamonds, and money saved, and whatever. So evidently he bribed somebody, and it\u2019s\nawtul word to use, isn\u2019t it, but it happened. So that they were able to transfer him. So they\ntrans -- transferred him, let\u2019s say this is the camp where I was, nearby was a camp which\nwas producing electricity, and they needed people, so my husband and this doctor were\ntransferred here, okay? So we were nearby, and then I was able to see him, and not once,\ntwice, or whatever it is. Then they combined all -- the both camps into one, cause they\nneeded people where we were. So my husband came, and the doctor, and he had a -- a --\nhe was working, they -- a -- occupied him to be the main person to see to people that got\nwounded during the work, and so on. So that\u2019s how I met my husband, and very casual\nand so on. But somehow, we knew each other, evidently he thought more of it than I did,\nbecause he took, you know, all the pain to find me after the war, you know. And when he\nfound me, and when I -- and when they wrote, I was glad in a way, cause it was the only\nperson that was looking for me. So I -- I came to Poland, and I came to Germany, and\nthen we went to Bergen-Belsen, and we lived there until we were able to go to -- to\nHamburg and wait for the ship to come to the -- to America.",
        "Q: And what year were you married?",
        "A: We got married in s -- 50 -- May \u201955. No, wait a sec, six -- 56. No, w-was it -- was it\n-- no, sic -- 40. My God, yes, \u201946, May \u00b046. The war ended in \u201945, in -- in May, and --\nand I meanwhile was in Sweden and came back, and whatever it -- yeah, that\u2019s when it\nwas.",
        "Q: When and where -- what year did you find out, or what -- when did you find out and\nhow, about the fate of your father and brother?",
        "A: Well, I found out -- first of all, I was looking, and I couldn\u2019t find them. And they were\nvery efficient because we were writing to different Jewish organizations who were\noccupying themself, and making a point of finding people, and they did not find. But\nthen, later on, I found from the people who were in the same camp and whatever it is, or\nwhatever, bits and pieces of information that he was sick, and that was in Brunow, a\ncamp near Auschwitz. It was a camp for -- for men, and that one person was sure that my\nbrother died, because he saw him in a very bad state, and then my father most probably ti\n-- dead, too. And if he did not, then the -- the -- at time when they went on this march\ncamp, which was the same time that we went, he might have not survived the camp,\neither, because I was never able to find him. That was all evidence and information I got.",
        "Q: And you found that out pretty soon after the war ended?",
        "A: More about after they ended, because I got pictures, and -- from people that -- that had\nbits of pieces of -- from either -- I don\u2019t know how they had it, don\u2019t ask me how, but\nthey -- they somehow obtained some little pictures here and there. Because we -- we were\nnot able to bring pictures or anything, cause you know, when -- when IJ arrived in\nAuschwitz, and they were taking us to -- they said to showers, and this and that, when\nthey stripped our clothes, we -- we thought that they were taking us to crematorium. But\nof course, it did not happen, it happened different. So when they took us there, I had with\nme some pictures, and money -- little money, which mean -- meant nothing. And they --\nthat was the only pictures I had, and the Germans would not let us take anything when\nthey -- when we went 1n the showers, and we -- we thought we were going to be gassed.\nAnd so they told us only to take the soap, and whatever.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: -- meant nothing, and they -- that was the only pictures I had, and the Germans would\nnot let us take anything when they -- when we went in the showers, and we -- we thought\nwe were going to be gassed. And so they told us only to take the soap, and whatever it 1s\nin. But we came out the other way of the -- of the room, and we didn\u2019t have anything. So\nthey -- we were given some clothes, and some didn\u2019t fit, and of course in -- in a way we\nwere able to trade it with the people that got too large clothes, to get it smaller, and\nwhatever it is. And the clothes consisted only of -- of overdress, and clogs, and that\u2019s all.\nWe didn\u2019t have any undergarments or any, and that\u2019s -- that\u2019s all we were given. So we\njust really didn\u2019t have anything.",
        "Q: Tell me about coming to America, what that was like, and what your impressions\nwere.",
        "A: Yes, I would like to speak about that, because it made -- first of all, a -- I was looking\nevery -- everywhere if I was not going to be oppressed, and -- and brutalized, and -- and\nhurt, and whatever, just -- I didn\u2019t know what to expect. And I was amazed, I was amazed\nthat actually there was kindness that I could notice in people\u2019s eyes, and behavior,\nwhatever it is. Of course, I did not need anything, because I was already going to be taken\ncare, and helped by my relatives that waited for me. Ellis Island -- I think at that time\nEllis Island was still in operation, 50 - 55 years ago, don\u2019t you think so? So -- so I didn\u2019t\nneed any specific help or anything, but -- and when I came to Charleston, I didn\u2019t need\nthat either, because my aunt helped us find a little apartment, and we lived very, very\nlimited. I mean, basically poorly on -- comparing to how I lived in Europe before the war,\nbut everything was good because of the fact that we were no oppressed, and -- and\ndiscriminated against, and so on. And I was amazed, I couldn\u2019t believe it. Then, I mean, I\n-- f-for example, I went to a doctor, you know, like in the process of -- of living in\nCharleston, I -- I had to find a doctor for different -- you know, you get -- all of a sudden\nyou get illnesses when you didn\u2019t even feel anything before. And I found a doctor who\nwas not Jewish, and I didn\u2019t even think anything about it. And he was so kind that -- that\nwhen I -- when I think about him to this day, I -- I have to cry, because that\u2019s how kind\nhe was to me. So, really, all these things like that, putting together, contributed to -- to --\nin a way to my recovery, and believing in human goodness, and so on. So I was very,\nvery happy to see that, and very amazed. I mean, I -- I -- things did not cease to amaze\nme, as it -- as it came along. Like, for example, why -- I don\u2019t know whether I should\nmention that, but I was not aware in those days of the situation between blacks and\nwhites. Because all I knew is from movies, and I -- I could not find anything basically\nbad and discriminating, you know, that whites did to blacks. But then, for example, on --\nin Charleston you -- it was obvious that blacks were supposed to sit to the back of the\nbus, and they were announcing, actually, for -- you know, people to vacate to the -- the\nfront area, and whatever it is. So, it -- it upsets me -- it upset me a lot, but there was\nnothing I could do. Then another thing that I noticed, for example, black people in -- in\nCharleston were very kind. I -- I\u2019m not talking about young people -- very young people,\nbecause they were either very young people, or kids, so you don\u2019t expect of them to\nbehave differently. But people sort of a little bit older, you know, where I walked -- when\nI walked the streets, or something, I noticed that they were taking off their hat, and they\nwere greeting me. And I couldn\u2019t understand why -- why -- why. I came to my aunt once,\nand I asked her, \u201cWhy do people greet me here all the time?\u201d I says, \u201cI don\u2019t know\nthem.\u201d So she said it was a -- a custom for them to do that. So, I -- I thought it was\nremarkable, and felt very sorry about it when I, later on, understood what was going on.\nThat\u2019s all.",
        "Q: Did you speak English when you first came to America?",
        "A: [have a very good background of Latin, and in German also. And I was able to\ntranslate things, but only the reading -- when I was reading it. When people were\nspeaking to me, it all sounded like, you know, jumble bumble, whatever it is. And I had\ndifficulties, but I made my point to learn how to speak. I -- my first book was, \u201cThe Good\nEarth.\u201d Can you imagine to try to un -- the reason I picked, \u201cThe Good Earth,\u201d because I\nread it in Polish, and therefore I -- if I didn\u2019t understand it all, I would j -- kind of make\nbelieve that I do, and whatever it is. And that was the first book I read.",
        "Q: What did your husband do for work to support yourself?",
        "A: Yes, well my husband, when we came -- and I told you that my aunt and my uncle\nwere the ones that sponsored us, and they helped us a little bit. And my -- my uncle had a\n-- a Supermarket, but the supermarket was not what -- what you call a supermarket now, it\nwas a grocery store, a large grocery store, and people were picking their own stuff, and\nthen coming to the register, so it was like a supermarket. So, since my husband learned --\nmy husband was actually a businessman before the war, and he was like about nine years\nolder than I am, so he was already a young man, able to work and -- and sustain himself.\nAnd -- and in -- in Charleston, he evidently, since he did not have anything else that he\ncould understand well, he w-was working in the business of grocery. And a year and a\nhalf later, he was able to buy a grocery store, a supermarket from a person -- of course,\nwe didn\u2019t have any money to buy it, but he was paying for 1t monthly as -- as 1t went, and\nthen we had a supermarket that we -- we moved to another part of town, and -- so he was\ndoing this, and then I was helping him. And then later on, he went in the business of\nwrecking. Wrecking was very prominent in a way that everybody was -- was wrecking.\nThey had houses from before the Civil War, and whatever it is. And they had, in -- in\nthose days they were building houses with old English brick, and those are the original\nbricks that were sent by ship from England, they were larger. And -- and the wrecking\nwas -- was very lucrative, because they were saving -- after wrecking it, they were\ncleaning the bricks, and they were reselling them, and they were a big -- it was important,\nit was a novelty, it was -- it was history. So they saved the brick, and people were able to\nmake lots of money. So then he was working -- of course, he was only supervising them,\nand how he knew about it, \u2019ll never know. He was supervising, and e-employing people,\nand paying them. He wasn\u2019t doing the original wrecking by himself. And this is how --\nand he did well. We did well, and we were thrifty. Oh yes, there\u2019s something else I would\nlike to speak about. When my children were born and of school age, I -- what\u2019s that?",
        "Q: A siren.",
        "A: Yeah? It sounded like voices, scared me. Anyhow, when the children beco -- became\nof school age, since I was very well taken care of as a child and schooled properly -- i-in\nother words I went to a kin-kindergarten, a private, Jewish owned kindergarten, it\u2019s not\nthat a -- a Jewish was -- they did not have any other kin-kindergarten. So I had to go to a -\n- a Jewish kindergarten. It\u2019s not -- I would -- the reason I\u2019m trying to mention it to you, it\nwas not because it was Jewish or not Jewish. But then I was in school, and then -- and\nschools in Poland were divided, Jewish people, and non-Jewish. So, we went to school\nSunday, and the non-Jewish children went to their school on Saturday, so that was the\ndifferent. And also, when I finished sixth grade, and of course I could have gone to the\nseventh grade, but since fortunately I was a good student, and I -- I also studied with --\nwith help, so I was advanced, and I was able to go to high school. And the high school\nused to call in -- in European, we used to call you gimnasium. Which translates evidently\ngymnasium here, but -- but that\u2019s not what it was. Gimnasium was the higher education,\nlike high school. And so I went to a private high school, and of course I wasn\u2019t there long\nenough, cause the war started, and the Germans occupied our schools, and we were not\nable to be there any more, because my school was only girls school. So we were not able\nto be there, because young soldiers and everything. And there were horrible things that\nwere going on, they were raping, and everything. So we were -- we -- they closed the\nschool. So that was it, but s-schooling for my parents meant awful lot, education and so\non. And yeah, e -- speaking of education, my z -- my brother went to a school that was\nbasically Hebrew, but of course, Polish was learned, and just like if he went to a day\nschool where, you know. And so we were really very carefully taken care of, as far as\neducation is concerned. So naturally, when I became a mother, and my children started\ngoing to school, I felt like I -- I -- I was thinking the same way, and -- although schools\nwere different, and better, and -- in Charleston, schools were segregated, you know, so\nyou -- it\u2019s not that 1t was better or worse, but -- but they had good schools, so -- but I\ndidn\u2019t care about it. My sons went to a military school, like children\u2019s military, the -- you\nknow, the grade school. And they were wearing uniforms, and everything, just like -- like\nregular military, but children. And my daughter went to a -- a s-school, and it was\nfamous, it still is famous. It\u2019s called Ashleigh Hall, where it -- it was just for girls, and\nthere were a -- it was a boarding school too, if somebody needed it. So my -- my children\nwere very good ta-taking care of, and all of them, I\u2019m very proud of them.",
        "Q: You have two sons, I --",
        "A: I had -- I had four sons.",
        "Q: Four sons?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And their names?",
        "A: Norman. Norman Joseph was my oldest son. Maurice Howard is my second son, he\nlives in Charleston now. Then I have Richard Ivan, and Stanley Paul, and well, my oldest\ndaughter is Blanche Dorothy, and my youngest daughter is Sherry Lisa Weintraub. They\nall -- actually, most of them lived here, except for my son now that 1s practicing dentistry\nin Charleston.",
        "Q: How did they get to know about your story as a Holocaust survivor?",
        "A: Well, it actually took a long time, because people did not talk. And I had a -- actually,\nno intention to tell them, because it was too sad, and young children, I didn\u2019t want to\noccupy their minds with this. And -- and -- on the other hand yet too, I thought that it was\nbad that I was a priva -- prisoner, and that maybe I did something bad, and I did not want\nto -- to tell the children, cause they wouldn\u2019t understand, so I did not. And therefore, I did\nnot. But then, later on, I remember on a couple occasions, when I used to come to pick up\nmy daughter from school, her -- the principal came to me and -- and asked me if I could\nteach the children French. And I told her, I -- I don\u2019t speak French, I speak just a little bit,\nI have learned a little bit, but that is not enough to teach anybody. And I told her I could\nmaybe as -- instruct them in German, but they did not have German. But anyhow, the\npoint is that they -- that they couldn\u2019t make me out what I am, and who I am, and they did\nnot -- could not make a connection at that time, what was the Holocaust, and what the\nHolocaust did to us. You see, people were completely ig-ignorant. They knew the -- the\nwar was bad, but they -- I -- they did not know how -- how it reduced us to become\nprisoners, and not -- nobodies, comparing to what we were before, and so on. So that\u2019s\nthe way it was.",
        "Q: So how was it that you -- how did you tell your -- your children?",
        "A: Later on, when people started reading about it, and talking about it, and -- and writing\nabout it. They -- people would come to me, they ask me to -- to do a interview on\ntelevision, and I did several of them. Then they ask me to write some things. They didn\u2019t\n-- they ask me to do different things, and speak to -- to schools, and -- and educate young\nschoolchildren, and tell them ideas. And -- and I was able to do that, and I wanted to do\nit, not only that I was able. And I did my best, and I was pretty busy all the time, and I\nworked, too. I had my own business that I -- I was a clothes designer, and I opened up my\nown shop in a shopping center, and I had to support my children later on, when my\nhusband died, and he died in -- in \u201973, which 1s a long time ago. So I still was busy, I had\narticles in the newspaper, and they would interview me, and have me tell them stories,\nand this is how everything came to light. And later on -- in the small cities, actually\npeople were talking freely about it, better. Where in the big cities, like New York,\nChicago, pe -- people did not crawl out from the woodwork until much later. I don\u2019t\nknow why. Maybe because there were more people in the larger cities, where in our -- in\nCharleston, we had maybe five or six family of survivors. So that\u2019s the way it 1s, and now\nmy grandchildren know a lot about it, too. One of my granddaughters wrote a story about\nme, and they had a little combination of stories in a -- in a book, where in high school,\nthey had to each come out with a story, and -- and it was published in a book. And it was\npublished only if it was good, and they were giving -- given a grade for it. So my\ndaughter -- my granddaughter did that, and I was very proud of it, proud of the fact that\nshe was interested to know, and so on. And they still do, nowadays too, I have very\nyoung grandchildren still, that are interested in, and they make me come to their school,\nand -- and s -- talk to them. Of course, you have to have a very special approach for\nchildren once you are a mother yourself, then you are able to apply it in a way where they\nwill understand it, and it will not be so -- so drastic, and shocking to them. So that\u2019s the\nway I did it.",
        "Q: Why did you decided to send you sons to military school?",
        "A: Well, it was not because of military in a way, but -- but because it was a -- a private\nschool. That was the only private school in -- in Charleston. And of the fact that -- that 1-\nit was a good school, and the only -- they were disciplined in a way, but not that they\nneeded discipline, cause my children were -- were very well behave -- behaved, but they\ndid have some military little things that they were doing. Like, for example, they had a\nroll call in the morning before they entered classes, they stayed on attention when things\nwere happening, and they were dressed military. So it was -- it was like a boost to their\npersonality, cause they felt like they were somebodies. And -- and this is what I felt that\nshould be instilled upon them, because I, during the war, lost all this. You know, the\nimportance, and the -- the assurance, and -- and whatever. So -- and then it was a private\nschool that -- that I was in favor of, and therefore I did it.",
        "Q: Did you feel patriotic, and did you feel like you were an American?",
        "A: Oh, I am still patriotic. I still feel that way. I -- I felt to -- I\u2019m still getting choked up --\nI felt that way, and I feel that way all the time when it comes to -- to different things, like,\nfor example, if you see on television different things that we are doing, or this, like for\nexample, they send people now to -- to Turkey to a -- assist them in saving the people\nfrom the ra -- from the earthquake. I feel choked up, and I feel like crying, and I am very\nproud of it. And then, one day I was, for example, in a s-store, where the clerk was a\nyoung Jewish boy, a Russian. Well, I didn\u2019t know if he was Jewish, or not Jewish, or\nwhatever it is. And I said something, not connecting, or referring to -- to his English, and\n-- because it was obviously with a Russian accent, and I can detect it immediately. So it\nwas not the reason for that, but I said something, and he said to me, \u201cThis is America.\u201d\nYou know, like proudly, see, because they just escaped from the -- from Russia. There is\nlots of people here from Russia. And when I found out, I says, \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d\nHe says, \u201cWell, I\u2019m happy to be here.\u201d And he told me he\u2019s going to college already, and\nso on. And then, in the process of -- of t-talking, he told me he was Jewish, because we\nwere talking. I says, \u201cWell, how -- how are you able to be -- go to college already? Your\nEnglish is,\u201d -- and I didn\u2019t want to insult him, \u201cis good, but is it good enough for\ncollege?\u201d He says, \u201cYes. Besides,\u201d he says, \u201cI am Jewish, and Jewish people are smart.\u201d\nBecause -- you know, because whatever, I don\u2019t know, I was proud of what he said. It\u2019s\nnot that I necessarily feel that way. I\u2019m proud of myself, and I\u2019m proud of being Jewish,\nand proud of whatever it is you have to. So -- but this is the -- and it struck me. I says,\n\u201cMy God, isn\u2019t that wonderful?\u201d And -- and -- and I always feel that way about the\nUnited States, feel about it to the point where I -- where I can sit and cry because of the\nway I\u2019m being treated here, and because of wh -- of the way I was able to grow up he --\nhere, and -- and establish my life, and -- and feel good about it, it\u2019s very important.",
        "Q: Pll just change th -- [break] Well let me ask you this; have you, and do you recall\nexperiencing much anti-Semitism in -- in this country?",
        "A: I am very upset with it, I\u2019m very upset with it. I -- as -- personally did not feel it, and\nif it was some -- somebody anti-Semitic that was in contact with me, or a -- they did not\nshow any evidence tha -- how he felt. But of cou -- of course I am very upset when they\nstill do it. But to be honest, unfortunately, not that it makes me feel better, we are not the\nonly group that -- that they are anti -- you know. There are a -- I see the same thing they\nfeel about Chinese people, about, still, African people, or still Indian people. Whatever it\nis, they -- they feel that way. So not that it -- I feel better being in a crowd, but I realize\nthat I\u2019m not the only one that is that way. And then I have great belief, and strong\nappreciation for -- for the Jewish people that establish their life here in America, and\nwhat they contributed. Makes me proud. So --",
        "Q: Tell me about the trip that you took to Germany to be a witness. How -- how did this\ncome about?",
        "A: Oh, the first trip was incredible.",
        "Q: What year was that?",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: What year was that?",
        "A: \u00b069. I -- I -- evidently some people that knew me from Vearshmeek, because\nincredibly enough, most of the people, all the 300 of -- other people that -- that were\nsaved by me -- I mean, I -- that was not my idea that -- that I developed, and realized that,\nbut the people were telling me that I saved them, because most of them live in New York,\nand -- and in Israel. When I came to Israel once for a visit, there was a gr-group of people\nthat was present when all this happened, and they invited me with a purpose. I didn\u2019t\nknow that, I just thought I was going to visit them, that -- you know, just to -- to\nremember them, because I was not a -- born in Vearshmeek, I was just a newcomer, but\nthey knew me enough from hearing about me, or little, you know, in touch with -- with\nme here, and there for a reason. So when I came to visit them, they surprised me to a\npoint where I really was sitting and crying for half an hour. Because they had the little get\ntogether, invited everybody who knew me, and when I came in, they s-screamed, \u201cOur\nhero 1s here.\u201d And then they made me believe that I was the one that was instrumental in\nsaving them. And then, when I started thinking about it, it really was so, because -- not\nthat I planned it that way, because I didn\u2019t plan it that way. But it happened though,\nbecause I -- I kind of messed up their timing, and it was dark, and then the planes were\nflying, and they couldn\u2019t finish what they wanted to do, and the next day it was already\nknown to the -- to the commander, and he didn\u2019t want that way. He says, \u201cWhy should I\nkill them here, let them go to -- to Auschwitz, let them do whatever they want to.\u201d So,\ntherefore, they -- they did not kill us. So he didn\u2019t want anybody, and besides it, the\nGermans themself were angry when the people f -- the Ukraine people did things without\ntheir specific instruction. They felt like they are the masters, and they are -- they are the\nones to tell them what to do, and whatever it 1s, so -- what -- what was the --",
        "Q: That your trip to Germany as a -- as a witness.",
        "A: Oh yeah. So anyhow -- I got sidetracked, right? I always do that. Anyhow, where --\nwhen people found out, they started being interested in the Jewish -- people started\ninterest -- be-become interested about the crimes, and -- and you know, and so on. And\nwhen they found somebody that was guilty of crimes against the Jewish people, they --\nthey made a trial, okay? The Germans thems -- themselves wanted to. So, when they\nfound out that I was a very strong witness against this guy, because I had something to\nshow myself for, and I was a witness when they -- from the camp where I was, I told you,\nin Vearshmeek, and where my husband was already there. And the doctor -- there was\noutbreak of typhus, and there were seven people who were sick. And the seven people,\nthey just didn\u2019t want to cure them and do anything, although they would have survived.\nThey made us put them on stretchers -- you know, the stretchers that we produced, and\ntake them to the cemeter -- cemetery. And on this cemetery, they had a big grave dug,\nand they made those people kneel down -- there were seven only, seven or eight -- and\nshoot them. So I was a witness of that, which was absolutely -- I mean he killed s-single-\nhandedly, seven people. And that\u2019s enough to be con-convicted if you kill one, right? S --\nand then he wanted to kill me, and didn\u2019t su-succeed.",
        "Q: This was -- this was the fellow Sch -- Shrot.",
        "A: Shrot. But there was another one that did this killing. You know, that was not the same\none, but --",
        "Q: Oh, two -- two men named Shrot?",
        "A: No, no, no. He was the one -- the one that killed the children was another one. But he\nwas brought to trial at the same time with the other one, with Shrot. So I -- I was witness\nto what he did to me, and I witness to the other things. And, of course, we came -- the\nGerman government actually paid for the trip, because I would have never spent money\nke -- I didn\u2019t have it. And I would have not done it to see that the -- the Germans that --\nthat did such horrible atrocities -- I was scared. The first time we finally arrived in\nHamburg, and we were stepping down, I -- I felt like I was absolutely going to have a\nheart attack to -- to -- to put my feet on the German soil, to feel -- you know, that they did\nall this and so on. It was a terrible experience, I -- I didn\u2019t want to, but I -- I had to. And I\nthink my husband was with me at that time, too, because I didn\u2019t want to go by myself.\nSo it -- it was aw-awful experience.",
        "Q: Were the men themselves there, on trial?",
        "A: He was there, yes, he was there. And he remembered, because I told him that he shot\nme, which he did, and he intended to shoot everybody else, which he did. And then he\ntold -- told that I jumped him, which was true, and I didn\u2019t object to it any more, because\nit was true.

        "A: -- this was true, he was there, but they -- the -- he was coming to the trial every day\nwith a suitcase, and documents and everything, like a big businessman. He was not in\njail. He was coming on his own, and they didn\u2019t do anything to him, because he was\njailed in Russia, right after the war, I think. Either he remained in Russia where they --\nwhen -- when they were in Russia, you know, trying to -- to beat the Russians, or he\nactually escaped Germany, and -- and Poland, because of the fact that he was doing all\nthese awful things, and -- and he went to Russia, or maybe there were -- he did some\nthings for the -- to the -- against the Russian people, and that\u2019s why they got him in --\njailed in Russia. So, because of the fact that he was in -- in jail for two years, or\nsomething like that, they didn\u2019t want -- they didn\u2019t do anything to him. In other words,\nthe fact that he killed so many people just didn\u2019t meke -- make any difference.",

And the way -- he was\n-- he learned a little bit of Hebrew, he came -- when he came out to his special area where\nhe was supposed to sit, you know, to his special booth, he came, and he said shalom to\neverybody in Hebrew, and he -- and he also was saying [indecipherable] all kind of\npapers, and documents. And he was answering questions; there were a number of Israel\nHolocaust survivors that were witnesses, and were with him, and -- and talked -- spoke\nagainst him. Didn\u2019t bother him at all.

The fact that they did the trial, and went through the -- to\nthe problems of getting people from -- because there were people from Canada, there\nwere people from Australia, there were people from all over, because after the war, all the\nsurvivors kind of scattered everywhere. They had n -- knew somebody, that\u2019s where they\nwent. Maybe I would have gone to Israel, maybe I would have gone anywhere else, but\nwhy -- why go anywhere else when I had relatives here?

        "Q: No, in 88.",
        "A: In \u201988. I was with friends, and I was already well rooted, and well established, and\nfeeling -- feeling American, that -- and I came, and I have seen what I have seen. I -- I did\nnot feel sentimental about the Polish people, because they were denouncing us, and they\nwere destroying us, and they were stealing and taking from us all the time. There was a\nnumber of Poles that were assisting Jewish people and helping them, there\u2019s no doubt\nabout it. But the greater majority was actually waiting to take it away. G -- I'll tell youa\nlittle s -- something that will indicate how it was. After the war, people were -- late --\nlater after the war, many people would travel to Poland to seek their roots, and find out --\nwell, there are some people from Israel that went there, and they went to a -- a -- a city\nwhere their parents used to live, grandparents and so on. And of course, they didn\u2019t find\nanybody over there, because they were all gone, and there was a little cemetery where\nthey could maybe identify with, or a remnant of a synagogue or so on. But they were\ntalking with people living in -- in very nice houses, they belong to Jews. Not that it -- the\nJews were privileged and had those houses, but jewis -- Jewish people were working\nhard, and they were a -- a -- improving their lives, and their existence, and everything,\nand they were very particular about it, so they had better houses, and better places to live\nin, they lived better. So they were asking this particular family or person that lived in this\nhouse, oh, you have a nice house. So they were telling them yes, the Jews had it, now we\ngot it. So the person they wanted was interviewed, and I was asking him how and what\nand whatever it is, and they were telling them -- which was very, very degrading for -- for\nme to listen, how they were talking about the Jewish people that were killed, murdered,\nor whatever it 1s, and left the house for them, they felt lucky that they had everything, all\ntheir belongings, and everything. Now, for example, they -- there was also a incident\nwhere they were interviewing children in schools. You want a pillow for your back?",
        "Q: No, that\u2019s okay.",
        "A: That would be nice interview, hi -- I don\u2019t really -- I -- I don\u2019t even care any more.\nAnyhow, so when they ask children, five year old children, six year old children, do you\nknow what a Jew is? No. You know how they look. So one kid says, \u201cOh yes, I know,\nthey have big ears, and big noses, and they got big teeth, and they are scary.\u201d This is how\nchildren were able to describe Jewish people, and it\u2019s not li-like that. Of course, in\nEurope, Jewish children, I -- I mean Jewish people were branded having big noses Here,\nyou got everybody, Arabs, the -- the Greeks, the -- there -- whatever it is, everybody\u2019s got\nbig noses, and it was not especially a trait of Jewish people. So, that\u2019s how they described\nthe Jewish people over there. And it was upsetting.",
        "Q: Did you go to your childhood summer home on that trip in 1988, in Lodz?",
        "A: Y -- y -- to my summer home? Yes. It was not my own, it was where we rented. Yes,\nwe went there. There was one lady in Lodz that took me -- her husband was driving, and -\n- course I was able to pi -- pay them, and I brought things for them, because how I found\nout about the person is also a whole, big story. But purely by accident, I was writing by\nthe name to the person, and the -- the letter was received by these people of the same\nname, and whatever it is. And they were not Jewish. I was writing to a Jewish friend that\nwas supposed to live in -- in Lodz, and they received it, and as I started writing to them, I\nfelt obligated to -- so I was writing, I was always putting money in the -- in the letter,\nbecause th -- she sounded kind, and nice, and whatever it is, and I knew that they were in\n-- lived poorly. So then when I came to Lodz, I got in touch with -- with her, and of\ncourse I stayed in a hotel, I didn\u2019t need anything from them, but they did offer to take me\nwhere I wanted to go by car. And since it was like about I would say two hours away\nfrom L\u00e9dz, they took me over there. And of course, I was -- 1t was on a [indecipherable].\nSo, I cannot even describe how I felt. I -- I felt like -- like -- like I could touch everything,\nand -- and it would be the same, and every -- course, the area -- this was where we used\nto come for vacation, and father used to come. That -- they took me to the train station,\nand I remember coming and waiting for Daddy to come from L6dz, because Daddy used\nto come for the weekend, you know, like Friday, and then leaving Monday morning, and\nyou know, everything was just -- just like I could touch it. So I lingered quite a little\nwhile over there, and she doesn\u2019t know -- she didn\u2019t know what I was looking at. And I\nwas looking, and I was touching, and I was doing things and -- that\u2019s all you can do, there\nis NO way you can possibly recover anything that you have lost, that\u2019s all. So it was a very\n-- a very touching and emotional moment. And of course, it did not look the same\nbecause they have rebuilt the areas, it\u2019s -- so I did not find the house where I was living,\nbut the train station looked somewhat similar to what -- what I remember. And then when\nwe want -- went to the area, they had it redone, rebuilt, and streets, and everything, I --\nbasically I didn\u2019t recognize it. But it was a incredible time. And then, of course, the way -\n- in Poland, you wouldn\u2019t believe it. Like, for example, I w --",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay, I\u2019m just stretching.",
        "A: I -- I looked at streets, you know, the main streets where there was lots of business,\nwhere they had lots of stores, and I know fortunately, or unfortunate, or some wartby\nwhatever it 1s, those buildings and -- and houses, and -- and businesses belonged to\nJewish people. So they had signs, for example, dressmaking, or this, hanging on the\nentrance of the -- of the air -- you know, the -- the areas in Europe had, like for example,\nthis was a big courtyard, and the houses were bi -- th -- were around, and there was a gate\nhere, where you entered, cause that\u2019s how most of the houses were, with a -- a -- cl --\nenclosed in courtyard for everybody. So, like on -- at the entrance of the -- of the\ncourtyard, they had different signs saying who 1s doing business of any kind, like for\nexample shoemaker, this and that, whatever. And then, in the front of the street, they had\nstores, and the stores were saying, like here, whatever the store was selling, whatever it\nis. So they still had the same size and everything there, all -- and of course now,\nrestaurants, they still had the Jewish restaurants with the same sign. Like, for example, a\nJewish delicacy is, like for example, have you ever heard of gefilte fish?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Did you really?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Huh. Well, okay. I-It w -- Jewish people eat it -- not -- they can eat it any time they\nwant to, but it was a custom that for Saturday -- Friday and Saturday, you made it,\nbecause we did not have refrigerations and so on, and it was -- we were able to keep it in\na cold place for a couple days to eat, because we were not allowed to -- to cook, or do\nanything. So we ate that, and we still do, so it\u2019s a very popular dish for Jews. So anyhow,\nwhat made me laugh is I saw a restaurant, and it says, of course in Polish, \u201cWe serve\nJewish gefilte fish.\u201d Now, that was in Polish, but I\u2019m translating it. And I said, \u201cMy God,\nthey didn\u2019t even know how to make it.\u201d You know, if they were not specifically\ninstructed to do it. And they had businesses, and Jewish people go there. And they -- they\n-- | went there too, cause I -- I had no way -- no other way to -- to go to eat. I wasn\u2019t very\nfond of -- of them, and bec -- I was hurt. I still had the feeling of -- of the way they\ntreated us, still had the taste of it. So I could not warm up in such a short time toward\nthem. Of course, now, it\u2019s a different generation, and it\u2019s different, so I feel differently\nabout it. I feel different, I -- differently about the Germans, okay? Because first of all, the\nGerman society is mixed, also, of different groups, of ethnic groups, in different\ncountries, and different thing. If Hitler we -- were to be alive, and if he saw his -- his\ncities in Germany, he most probably would commit suicide becau -- because he wa --\nwanted -- he was striving to destroy everybody that did not belong in Germany, and he\nwanted a clean Germany, only of typical, ethnic Germans, and no mixtures whatsoever.\nAnd like I said, I said oh my God, here I came to -- to Frankfurt, to the airport, and they\nhad groups of Indians from India, okay? Groups of people from different, other countries,\nfrom the Middle East, from here, from that, and then in the streets you saw Chinese\npeople, Chinese restaurants and everything, and I looked, and I said, \u201cMy God, it feels\nlike I\u2019m in the States.\u201d And then I said t -- the same thing that I told you about Hitler, I\nsaid, \u201cIf Hitler saw this, he would drop dead immediately,\u201d you know. So -- so I don\u2019t\nfeel -- I cannot say -- I -- I -- I feel something, but I would not say that I feel about every\nGerman the same way, because it\u2019s a different generation. And the time when I went to\nGermany -- Germany, if I saw somebody that was my age then, I would know that he was\nsomebody in the German army, somebody that oppressed the Jewish people, and -- and\nwhatever it is, so I would feel very badly. But now it\u2019s entirely a different -- different ge-\ngeneration, but of course, you still have the anti-Jewish, you know, anti-Semitic groups\nand so on. Like for example, the group here that was supposed to -- you know -- you\nknow, go around -- what do you call it? They -- an-anti-Nazi -- anti-Jews -- Jewish group\nthat was supposed to be here last -- last week.",
        "Q: Oh, the Ku Klux Klan?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, whatever ot -- I thought they were just strictly anti -- Nazis. On a -- they\nare a -- a combination of Ku Klux Klan, and whatever, okay. And, you know what\nsurprises me? That they came, and they asked for a permit, and the government gave\nthem a permit. Now how could it be? Knowing that these are that kind of people, and\nwho -- why doesn\u2019t somebody that belongs here, really, and is -- is a true American, a --\nno matter what religion, whatever it is, do things like that to -- to a -- you know, not\ndemonstrate, but to -- to -- to just announce that they are here, that we are here, we are --\nand we are Americans, although we are from there, and from where, whatever it is. But\nwhy allow them to -- to demonstrate, like they demonstrated already, twice in Chicago, in\nSkokie, I know. I mean -- and there were fights, and there were disturbances. Why -- why\ninvite something like that? That\u2019s what surprises me, that we are too lenient here, and too\n-- too much allowing. It shouldn\u2019t be like that, there should be a strict -- I -- I don\u2019t want\nto put ideas in anybody\u2019s head, but there should be c-certain raw -- laws to make sure that\nthings like that are not going to happen.",
        "Q: That there should be laws to prevent the ma-marches?",
        "A: Definitely, definitely. Al -- the -- any -- any ethnic group, and any group could march,\nfine, but not to be idealistic about something aga -- which is going to -- to be against our -\n- our American society. Why should they be allowed to -- to be like that, for them to\nspeak against somebody? If they are not Americans, let them get the hell out of there,\nthat\u2019s all. Forgive me for saying [indecipherable]",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay. It -- it must be frightening to you --",
        "A: It was frightening to me --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] your experiences.",
        "A: -- but I -- I almost wish, after I heard what was going on, I almost wish that they --\nthat they were there to demonstrate, because they had several different groups, large\ngroups. You know, Jews are not supposed to actually demonstrate or do anything public\non the Sabbath, and that was on Saturday. And they organized a group -- a Jewish group\nresistance, I don\u2019t know in what ways. I don\u2019t think th-they had arms, or anything, but --\nbut it was a -- a -- a contra -- a acting group, and different other groups, you know, that\nthey -- but there were lots of blacks because the Ku Kluck-ux Klan is against the blacks,\nand -- and this and that. So there were several large groups that were -- would overcome,\nno matter how -- and they said they were going to have 300 people only, and four only\nshowed up, right? Flor -- four of the Ku Klux Klan showed up, and then they dispersed.\nSo I don\u2019t know. But -- so if -- 1f they would have a -- a awful come down to reality, you\nknow, or because they would realize that there\u2019s no place for anything like that to\nhappen, there\u2019s no place for them to de -- demonstrate, and they -- you know. But I don\u2019t\nknow. Listen, as long as -- as people exist, there is always somebody that will come up\nwith something somewhere.",
        "Q: Can you tell me you -- in that 1988 visit to Poland --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- you went to Auschwitz.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Can you tell me about that? And you were looking for some photographs?",
        "A: Yes, yes. You see, I did speak about it. Yes. I found -- not photograph. Th-The reason\nI was looking for photographs, okay, when they were taking us to -- in Auschwitz, where\nthey were taking us to -- to the shower, I mentioned to you that I only had photographs\nand things with me. They took those away from us. Not that they personally came to me\nand took it away, but I had to leave it. So I had -- I was hoping that they would have the\nphotographs in Auschwitz. And they have set up a whole place, you know, like a whole\noffice in one of the barracks where, you know, where they were keeping the photographs,\nbecause they had a tremendous amount of photographs, because everybody was taking\nphotographs to the -- to -- to the -- to the camp with them. That -- that was the only thing\nthat was important for us. So, they found a awful lot of photographs, millions of them,\nmost probably, from people that were brought into Auschwitz. And so they kept it, they\nput them all in one barrack, or two barracks, and then they -- they segregated the\nphotographs, and placed them if they could into all cities, if 1t was evidence that it was\nfrom this, or another city. And that\u2019s where I went. I found my name, Blass, in several\nother cities. I found -- but I did not find any photographs that I could un -- I -- read,\nunless they were photographs, but you see, I was a very young gi -- I was still a teenager\nwhen the war broke out. So I couldn\u2019t know that much, and remember. I remembered\nonly that hit me -- that hit close to home, and so on. And people that I remember were\nonly sort of relatives, and maybe some friends from school, and so on. So, I did not know\nvery much, but when I saw a name, I could tell. I went to the cemetery -- cemetery in\nWarsaw, also, at the trip when I was -- that was when I was in Poland, and I made sure th\n-- and I -- I looked, and I found many names, Weintraub, and I found names Blass, but I\ndo not -- I -- I do not remember of any relative. Course, Weintraub was not my family, it\nwas my husband\u2019s family, so he most probably would have been able to distinguish\nbetter, but I was not able.",
        "Q: So did you not find the photographs you were looking for?",
        "A: No, no. I was very disappointed. The photographs that I brought in there, I would have\nfound, maybe, if they still were, but maybe I wasn\u2019t looking in the -- in the right place,\nbecause like I told you, each barrack had upstairs, and downstairs. The first barracks,\nactually, they were made out of brick, and concrete. Later on, the other barracks were\nmade out of wood. But those, for some reason, I don\u2019t know what they were planning to\ndo with it, or those were little brick houses. So, evidently, they planned to have the\nphotographs in there, because they put them right away. But maybe they didn\u2019t -- you\nknow, when you have photographs from people that were from different areas, and put in\none camp, and how -- you cannot tell which city, whatever it is. So maybe they were not\nput on -- put away in perspective that I could find them. So, I didn\u2019t find anything.",
        "Q: What was that like emotionally, for you to go back to Auschwitz?",
        "A: Emotionally, everything was terrible, terrible. This was not the same emotion as -- as I\nfelt being in -- in this small village where I used to spend my vacation time. This was an\nentirely different emotion. That was a good feeling, everything was good, like -- like\ntouching things that -- that I touched before, or somebody else, my parents, and my\nfriends, and whatever touched. This was a bad feeling, of -- of what they did, and it just --\neverything I looked at was -- was taken by force, and whatever, so it was a very horrible\nfeeling.",
        "Q: Was there some healing there, or some use for 1t? Was it a useful thing, or do you\nwish you hadn\u2019t done it?",
        "A: No, healing -- there\u2019Il be never healing, in my opinion. I never will be healed of it. I\njust get accustomed to it, that\u2019s all. I ust get a -- to the point where I can talk about it,\nwhere if you got me here at -- 10 or 15 years ago, I wouldn\u2019t be able to sit like that and\ntalk to you, but now I -- I want really -- and you can notice it most probably -- I want to\nget as much as I can out, you know, to talk about it. But I -- I couldn\u2019t do it before, so as\nbe -- as far as being used to it, e -- I-I\u2019m never used to it. I\u2019m just accepting that it was\nthat way, not accepting that you don -- y -- I don\u2019t know if you understand what I mil --\nthat this was my past, and this 1s how it was. Not that\u2019s the way it was supposed to be, or\nwhatever it 1s. So, I am just bearing no special feelings, because I can -- cannot do\nanything. I cannot change it.",
        "Q: Can you tell me about your tattoo? Did you get that at Auschwitz?",
        "A: Mm-hm, yeah. A14028. My mother was AO -- I mean 29. I remember when I we-went\nto do the tattoo. It was on a -- a late summer afternoon. All this transported came at the\nsame time. We were ta -- being tattooed, of course, women separate, and we didn\u2019t even\nknow what it was. But then w-we saw that girl was doing something, I told mother, I\nsaid, \u201cLet me go first.\u201d And at that time we didn\u2019t have any understanding of what was to\ncome, yet. I mean, we didn\u2019t expect anything -- anything like that, at all. And I was the\nfirst one to have that 28, mother had 29. And --",

        "A: I -- har -- I cannot escape it. Not -- I look at it, and I don\u2019t even -- I don\u2019t look at it\nwith the way you would look at it. You see, I look at it, I\u2019m used to it, it\u2019s part of my\nbody, that\u2019s all. And I look at it -- now, I have made -- when I was in -- in Florida, I had a\nfriend who was a painter, a artist, and the Holocaust monument in Florida is -- 1s\nremarkable, by a very known artist. And it does not -- it -- it shows, for example, a hand\nof a person like this, a arm, and he 1s pointing his fingers to the skies like -- like -- not\npraying, but reaching for the sky. And here 1s his number, and this is tr -- a tremendous\nstatue, and arm, an-and this is also very big, you know, as tall as this room. And so when\nI was there, this artist that I know -- knew -- he was a painter, he did for me this -- a\nportrait of the arm, exactly as it was there, and he ro -- and instead of having another\nnumber, which evidently the artist put either a person\u2019s number that he knew, or maybe\nhe was a Holocaust survivor himself, and he put his name, so he put my number on it,\nand then he wrote down on the -- over the portrait, Guta Blass Weintraub, survivor, and\nthen it was also my mother\u2019s name, and the number -- her number on the arm. So I give it\nto one of my sons, but it could be duplicated, you know, taken a photo of it to d -- to have\nsomebody else have it.

        "Q: But you -- you put a lock of your mother\u2019s hair in that locket, and you carry it around\nwith you?",
        "A: Yes. I still have a whole bunch put away, because this 1s destroyed almost, cause I\ndon\u2019t even take it off. I use it in the shower, and whatever it -- I Just be -- don\u2019t take off\nthis. And here, my -- the hair is already a little clamped up, but you know, I would never\nthrow it away, because in Jewish religion, you\u2019re not supposed to throw away anything\nthat was on a body -- n-not a foreign thing, but something that belonged to the body, it\nwas growing on the body. You are not supposed to throw it away, you bury it. Like, for\nexample they do in -- in a hospital when they have -- make autopsies, and everything like\nthat, so they -- they put everything in -- in one bag, what\u2019s left over, and they bury it,\ncause at least they have proper burial. So, I -- I couldn\u2019t destroy it and throw it away.",
        "Q: Are there smells, or music, or anything that -- that make you think of your experience\nduring the Holocaust?",
        "A: Definitely. You know, there was one song that they were singing, they were\noccupying Jewish musicians, you know they had a -- a tremendous amount of talent in\nconcentration camp. People -- singers, and musicians, and you name it. And at that time, I\nalready -- are you familiar with -- with the song, \u201cBeer Barrel Polka?\u201d Yes, da dan dan,\nda dan dan da da ha a -- [ -- | am not a singer. But anyhow, it was very famous at that\ntime, and evidently either it came from the States, and they adopted it over there, or vice-\na versa. It was \u201cBeer Ba-Barrel Polka,\u201d and it was a very known -- you know, song,\nmusic. And it was happy music, you know, jolly, just like having to do -- beer, you know,\nlike -- like it was bursting with happiness. Well, this song, they were -- so they had a\nJewish band, they supplied them with to -- instruments, and they had no difficulty\nsupplying wa -- with instruments, because when somebody was playing a instrument, that\nwas one of the most important things that they had, so they took it to concentration camp\nwith them. So they had plenty of instruments, so they were supplying the -- the orchestra\nwith instruments, they had violins and -- and everything, you know. And they made them\nplay this song when they were taking the -- the people to -- to the ovens, and wherever\nthey were going, whatever they were doing, whatever atrocities were -- were happening\nat the time, they always played that song. And that made me sick, ter -- it still does, you\nknow. When I came here later -- a few years later, there was a show on television, I don\u2019t\nremember exactly who it was that used to -- th-they were advertising that whoever have -\n- has a favorite song, or savorite -- favorite story, not song, to write it, and to -- that was a\ncontest for -- for some reason. And I wrote -- I still have it, actually, but I would have to\ndig, I don\u2019t know, hundred days to dig it out, everything. Is -- I wrote a -- a letter to this\ncompany that was soliciting for stories, you know, and to d -- it was like something to tell\nthem what -- what was the most important thing that influenced the life, or whatever it 1s,\nI don\u2019t know, with -- with a connection of a product that they were selling. Anyhow, I\nwrote a story about the song, and I -- and I told what 1t was connected with and\neverything, so they accepted it, but they didn\u2019t want to print it. They did not want to print\nit that I was the winner of a -- of a story like that, because it would be a -- too negative\nfor other ethnic groups, n-namely Germans, or whatever it is, and after all, there is a great\npopulation of German people here in America. And they did not do it.",
        "Q: Do you still -- do you have dreams about the Holocaust?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. I have terrible dreams, and I wake up pe-perspired, and -- and anxious,\nand -- and hurt, and for a while I am so disoriented that I don\u2019t know where I am, until I\nfinally slowly but surely realize. Yes, that\u2019s unfortunate, but I do that.",
        "Q: What are the dreams of?",
        "A: What? Oh, s -- yeah. I have seen things 1n this small town where I was. They were\npunishing people for doing certain things, for this and that, like for example, I thought\nthat\u2019s a sil -- sa -- simple way -- comparison. Like they will pan -- punish you because\nyou are using too much water, or watering the lawn. But in -- in Germany they had all\nkind of punishments, too. Non-Jewish people, and Jewish people. As it happened, some\nnon-Jewish people did something, and it was five or six people, and they hung them on\nthe market, the same market ba -- that I was telling you, where -- where they, during the\nevacuation that they put us on. And we -- and the Jewish people were ordered to come,\nand -- and -- and watch it. They were forced to watch it. So here 1s a -- you know, a --\nthey built a special -- what -- what do you call it, scaffold? Okay, where they -- and they\nhung the people, and we had to wait until they turned blue, you know, from the pressure\nof the blood, or whatever it is. And we watched it, it was the most horrible thing you\never, ever saw. Young people -- there was older people, and s -- a couple young people,\nright in front of us. And they pulled the thing, and that\u2019s what it was. So, of course, I have\nseen later on, in different forms, not exactly hanging. I saw shooting, and this and that.\nWhen they took us to this camp in Vearshmeek, you know, and when they took us from\nthe marketplace into the camp, they put men separately and women separately, and then\nthey were searching us, because they knew that we had valuables, money, because we did\nnot come -- of course, ourselves, we didn\u2019t have much, but people that came st -- still\nstraight from their home had things, so they -- and they told people -- us ahead, if they\nfind any money, if they find any jewelry, we\u2019ll be shot. And sure enough, they searched\nus, and they found somebody had some money, which didn\u2019t mean anything, you know,\npaper money. And they found some jewelry, maybe a -- a wedding ring, or this or that,\nand they shot the people in front of me. We were -- we were standing there, a woman\nhere, and a woman here, and they shot them right here.",
        "Q: And these are the things that you dream about? These are the things that you dream\nabout?",
        "A: Yes. About shooting, about killing, about -- terrible. Yeah, of course, it\u2019s -- I -- I\ndream about things that I never even -- that I have never even seen, that -- that after I\nrealized what I am dreaming about, what it\u2019s -- it\u2019s supposed to tell me, that it is\nassociated with the Holocaust. So I -- you know, I\u2019m aware of it.",
        "Q: Do you have friends, or keep in touch with fellow Holocaust survivors?",
        "A: Yes, I do. Not many, not here, but I had those, you know, out of the seven -- seven or\ns -- eight families over there they were survivors. But then I have friends 1n other cities\nand countries.

Knowing Charleston, and going places. Life was completely\neasier. Yeah, a small town life is con -- really very different from a big town here.

        "Answer: Okay, mm-hm, my name is Guta Blass Weintraub. I was born in Poland, in the\ncity of Lodz, the second largest city of Poland, and I lived there all the time, until the\nbeginning of the war. My family consisted of four people all together, myself, my\nbrother, my mother, my father. We were a middle class family, maybe slightly upper\nmiddle. And life was good. That -- that\u2019s all I remember at that time, is little by little it\nstarted getting worse. To -- to -- to kind of jump from one to another, okay.",
        "A: Uh-huh. My parents name is Noah Blass, my father. Then my mother was Bluma\nBlass. Her maiden name was Goldvasser, and what -- what else?",
        "A: Oh, my brother\u2019s. My brother\u2019s name was Moshe Ben Blass. It\u2019s Hebrew names, and\nthey were translated int-into Monyek Blass.",
        "A: He was a year and a half younger than I am, and he died unfortunately, in a camp near\nAuschwitz, a camp for men, Brunow. He was there with my father, and after the war I\nfound out that they both died there. That\u2019s about all I heard about them.",
        "A: Comparing to religious -- being religious here, and being religious in Europe was that\nthe -- medium. I mean, just observant Jew, when they came to the States, seemed to be as\nreligious as the Orthodox ones, practically, because we took our religion very seriously,\nwhether we observed to the point where it was fanatic. So, of course, we observed it, but\nnot to the point a Hassidim did. So when we came here, I felt myself being quite\nreligious. And we belonged to a synagogue here, and -- I lived in Charleston, and -- by\nthe way. I moved right after I came to the States, I moved to Charleston, South Carolina,\nand we made our life over there. And of course we -- the first thing where we did, we\nbelonged to a synagogue, and it was the Orthodox synagogue of -- of Charleston.",
        "A: Oh well, I -- we were observant, quite observant. We did not do anything that wasn\u2019t\nsupposed to, but the -- the difference may be -- the visible difference was that my father\nwore just regular clothes that everybody is wearing, where the Hassidim, the Orthodox --\nultra Orthodox were wearing their, you know, religious habits, and wha -- whatever. So\nthat was the only -- you -- you could distinguish a extremely religious Jew from just a\nreligious Jew. And of course there were Jewish people who were not observant at all, but\nthey -- everybody knew, and they consider themself being Jewish, but they were not\nobservant as we were.",
        "A: Well, like I said, my life was wonderful when I was growing up. We had a very close\nrelationship, very much so with my mother, and my father. I admired my father a great\ndeal. He -- he was el -- actually living, during World War Two in Germany. He spoke --\nspoke eng -- I mean, G-German very well. And I learned to speak German from him, and\n-- and -- well, my brother was too small to -- to learn German, but -- and then when the\nwar broke out, of course, I was frightened because I -- everything that was happening was\nso scary and unfamiliar to me that I -- I really didn\u2019t know how to look at it. So I remem -\n- remember my father always telling me, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the German are -- are not going\nto hurt anybody. They are intelligent, educated people, and they will not harm anybod-\nbody.\u201d The intelligence and education might apply to them, but the fact of the way they\nbehaved like animals, like you know, like -- like -- that remind me actually when -- when\nthere was a hunt -- you know, rabbit hunt, or deer hunt, or whatever it is in the English\nway, where they let all the dogs run after them, that just remind me of the situation in --\nin Germany.",
        "A: Yeah, it is a small town.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Okay, I like to describe the town. This was a small town with quite a large Jewish\npopulation. When the war broke out, they were supposed to -- or they were, actually,\nmaking a ghetto in -- in Lodz. And of course my -- my father, that was his decision, and\nwe ga -- went along with it, decided that we would move to the small town, maybe the\nGermans will not get there as fast as they get first to the large cities, which was really the\nfact. And also the reason we went to Vearshmeek was because my mother was born in\nVearshmeek, and she still had rel-relatives over there, sisters and -- yeah, sisters mainly,\nand so on. So we moved to Vearshmeek, and in the beginning it sim -- seemed to be\nokay, but the fact was that -- that our life changed because of not having proper living\nconditions and quarters and so on. So it was difficult, and of course my father\u2019s\nlivelihood ceased to exist, because he couldn\u2019t do what he did at home. And at home my\nfather had a factory of military uniforms. In other words, it was Boy Scouts, tha -- I mean\nthat led to it, Boy Scout, prepartor -- preparatory military, and then he also branched out\nto have sports goods like skiing outfits, and so on. So we were doing well, and I don\u2019t\nthink he had accumulated a fortune anywhere, or anything, unless I don\u2019t know. But we\nhad to leave everything, and just move there. My father organized for a wagon drawn by\ntwo horses, and we took what we could, and the -- just went, and of course we were very\nlucky, because somehow we were not disturb along the -- the way to -- you know, cause\nit could have been easily that the Germans would stop us and -- and suspect us of doing\nsomething wrong and so on. So we were not stopped, and we went straight to\nVearshmeek.",
        "A: In Vearshmeek?",
        "A: Well, we just occu -- well, first of all, the places in Vearshmeek -- it\u2019s a small town\ncomparing to -- to the large city, where you have -- we didn\u2019t have skyscraper-scrapers,\nbut we had buildings three, four, five story tall, and -- and in -- in Vearshmeek, the\nmajority of the buildings were wooden buildings, short, you know, one story, or whatever\nit is. So, no water in -- in the house, no bathrooms, and so on, so of course, it was quite a\ndifference. But it would have been all been good if 1 -- if 1t had not end the way it ended.\nAnd also, it was difficult to make ends meet. When -- during that time in Vearshmeek, I\nwas 14 years old or so, I -- with a friend of mine, we decided to make -- organize a\nkindergarten, which we did in -- in my apartment. My apartment consisted of a kitchen,\nand a larger room where the beds were, and table, whatever, just -- but we managed\nsomewhat, and we had a kindergarten, and people were very happy to -- to bring the\nchildren, because they were able to do other things, although their businesses and so on\ndid not -- did not -- almost didn\u2019t exist. But still, they were glad to have the children\naway, so I was earning some money. It was not a great deal, but 1t was enough to -- to\nbuy food, which was the most important thing at that time. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Sanitation, well, like I said, there were no bathrooms, there were no -- there\u2019s no\nwater, but with all this, you get used to it. When the water was brought in, we used our s -\n- the sanitation was basically almost like before, but the fact was that it was a little harder\nto obtain it, you know, to -- to work at 1t, cause water had to be brought in, and -- and\nthey had outies on -- in the backyard and whatever it is. So that\u2019s the way -- that\u2019s the\nonly way. If we were left alone in peace, we would have actually adapted to it, but every\nday they had different regulations, and finally they formed a ghetto, where at this -- to\nthis point, there was no ghetto in the city, and then they made a ghetto. Luck -- lucky\nenough where we lived. And this area was going to be part of the ghetto, so we didn\u2019t\nhave to move. But many other people had to move, and what happened then, they made\nthem move with us. In other words, we had the kitchen, and th -- the bedroom, which was\na little bit larger than -- than normally, so we had to share this with another family, 1t was\na family of a mother and daughter, and a husband, and a grandmother, and they all were\ntogether with us. And things begin to -- begin to be quite difficult.",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "A: I started a w -- [had half a year of high school. I started -- I finished the -- you know,\npublic school, and then I went to a pu -- to a private school. And -- but I always wanted to\nlearn, and I always -- and my parents especially, were very particular, as far as our\neducation is concerned. So I know -- I had a teacher, a -- a group, in group studies where\nI was taking French. I tried to improve on German, I was taking Latin. I wa -- anything,\nanything just cause I was so hungry for knowledge. And we also, like I said, we took\nHebrew, because my -- my father wanted my brother to -- to learn Hebrew, so we were --\na man was coming for a half an hour, whatever it 1s, and was teaching us Hebrew, and --\nmy -- my brother and myself. So -- actually -- and then I was teaching myself a lot of\nthings, cause I was always curious, and so -- so that -- that was my education.",
        "A: In this town, we were until 19 -- ninet -- beginning of 19 four -- four -- well, maybe a\nlittle -- in 1942, beginning of 1942. And at that time, they evidently wanted to -- to get\neverybody out, sent the majority of people to -- to concentration camp, and they had two\nfactories over there in Vearshmeek. One was a woodwork factory, which unbelievably\nbelonged to my first cousin. A big plant, you know, I don\u2019t know how many acres of\nland, with wood, and -- and so on. And they have a -- a tremendous hall where they had\nmachinery to cut and polish, and whatever it is. And that woodwork factory was taken\nover by the Germans to -- and transferred to produce articles and you know, for the war.\nLike, for example, they manufactured ammunition boxes, stretchers, and stuff like that.\nSo they took it over completely. Of course, my cousin and his family were shot during\nthat time. And of course, I don\u2019t know if they had any heirs to -- to claim it or whatever it\nis, but that was the situation. And of course then, like at the end of -- I may wrong as far\nas timing 1s concerned, but 1t might have been the end of \u201943, or maybe early beginning\nof \u201944, where they dissolved the camp where we were. We were working there, and I-\nliving there, and whatever it is. They arranged a area where we were living, like for\nexample men in one tremendous room, you know, in bunk beds, and women in the other\none. So it was like a barrack, mostly. And -- and we also received one meal a day of\ncooked -- cooked food, and then the rest of it we had to organize ourselves, so some\npeople who were from the city had brought in money, and they, since they knew the non-\nJewish people on the outside, they were elbo -- able to communicate with them, and get --\nget them to bring money for -- bring food for money, so for them it was easier. For\nmyself and my family it was harder, but we survived.",
        "A: Well, we -- we got there the very end of 1939, you know. That -- that would have been\nbecause they said they were going to close the ghetto in Lodz in 1940. So we just took off\nbefore the closing of the ghetto, because we knew -- or we had an idea that once we are\nclosed in the ghetto, we wouldn\u2019t be able to get out. So that\u2019s what happened.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: It was -- 1-in those days, it was not -- there was no possibility from my point of view,\nand for what I remember, for any Jewish person to be political We just did what we\nsupposed to do, what we were oud -- allowed to do, and th-there was -- and if there -- we\nwere political, it would have been in the area of -- of Judaism, and speaking of Palestine\nat that time, and -- and so on. But other than that, we had no -- not much to say as far as\nthe politics of the country were concerned.",
        "A: Fine.",
        "A: Lam? I --",
        "A: -- that\u2019s all I remember.",
        "A: You ask me about it in a year, most probably won\u2019t.",
        "A: Vearshmeek.",
        "A: Yeah? Myoufka. Oh, that was -- okay, first of all I want to make it clear. In -- before\nthey expelled us, before those, you know, how it -- I --",
        "A: Yeah, how do you say they -- evacuation, okay. Now, before the ev-evacuation from\nVearshmeek, we had -- Vearshmeek was a -- it was like a twin city. It -- one part was\nVearshmeek, and the other part was called Starachowice. Starachowice were -- was when\n-- where they had a sealed factory. I don\u2019t know what they did before the war in it, but\nevidently things for economy, for a -- you know, whatever it is, from -- for Poland. But\nwhen the Germans came in, they transferred that factory it -- into doing I don\u2019t know,\nmaybe bullets, maybe this, maybe that, I have no idea. So this is one place, okay. You\nspeaking of Myoufka, it was just a place high up on a -- on a big hill in the city of\nStarachowice, where they arrange for some reason, which is amazing because I -- I really\ndon\u2019t know how they could have done it so fast, unless this area was used for something\nelse -- they had little cabins -- cabins there and la -- in areas, and they put all of us,\nduring the evacuation of Vearshmeek, they put part of us there, and then a part of us in\nanother, similar place where they had barracks built. They evidently had an idea that this\nis what they were going to do, because they had to work from the beginning to be able to\n-- to have all this done.",
        "A: Oh, well that was about the same time when they evacuated us -- us from our -- the\nplace in Polish was named Tartuck. In German, it was called Zagaverker. It all means a f\n-- a wood -- wood factory, okay? When they expelled us from over there, they put us all -\n- there was a market, like every small city in Europe, and even the larger cities had\nmarketplaces, and they -- you know, chased us all through the marketplace, put us in\nrows and so on, and a -- did something the same what they did later on in concentration\ncamp, like making a selection. This one here, this one there, wi -- which meant -- later on\nwe found out, the younger people were left to work in the places that were still available,\nand they were producing goods for the German -- for the Germans, and the older ones\nwere moved straight on the trains, and they moved them to Auschwitz and other\nconcentration camps. Okay, well I was among them, and of course, we were lucky\nsomewhat. When they took me and my brother, and -- on one side, they put my parents\non the other side, I knew what was happening. I mean, you just -- 1t was a instinct that\ntold me what was happening. So, when they were running among -- there were hundreds\nand thousands of people, actually, because there was a great number of people that they\nsend from other cities to our -- to -- to Vearshmeek, because they did it very\nsystematically. Not just come to every city, and try to dig out to -- whatever number of\nJews was there. But they concentrated all the Jews from surrounding areas, and villages,\nand little towns, into one which was little largest -- larger. And then from over there they\nmade the selection and shipped the number of people to -- to a concentration camp, the\nremaining number they situated in different areas for work. And prior to it, you know,\nduring that selection, I was lucky because somehow -- I-I was very brave when I -- when\nI was young, I didn\u2019t feel like anybody could destroy me. You know, when you -- you are\nyoung, you just -- so I grabbed my parents from the lo -- line nearby, and pulled them in\nfront of me, and lucky enough nobody repla -- placed them back in the same place, and\nwe survived for awhile in this camp for -- I think we were there for almost two years.",
        "A: Shrot, yes.",
        "A: Yes, well you see, when we -- when they -- that was after the -- after they evacuated\nus, after the time we lived already on -- on a ta -- on the Tartuck, where the -- you know,\nwhere we work, after that they decided to evacuate us, and put us in concentration camps.\nSo they one day, without any warning, without anything, they -- they arrived wi -- with\nbuses, trucks that were covered with -- with canopy or whatever it is, and they just took\nus. They didn\u2019t even allow us to take anything that we wanted, which is a normal reaction\nof anyone that wants to take their things with them. W -- and packed us on the wagons,\nand we had no idea where we were going. So -- back -- what they did, they could not take\nus right away to the -- to the wagon -- to the trains to be send away, so they temporarily,\nfor two, three days, put -- put us in this little area where they had the barracks built, and\nleft us over there. And wh -- we waited for the train. When we got there, they had a big\narea which was like a yard, you know, and then the barracks were on the side. And when\nwe got there, the area that was supposed to be the yard had two great, long ditches dug on\n-- like between, you know, six or so yards between each other. And we couldn\u2019t\nunderstand what it was, but quickly we -- we find out -- found out what it was, cause they\ntold us right away the man should stand on one side of one ditch, the women on the other\nside of that ditch. And then this man that I was speaking about shouted who was -- he\nwas actually a -- from Ukraine, and -- and they -- in the beginning of the war the\nGermans solicited the -- the Ukraines and give them -- you know, to -- to belong -- to do\nthe dirty work, you know, and have sort of identifying clothes like a -- to make -- make\nus understand that they belong to the German army. Well these people did all the dirty\nwork, so they were, at that time, going to be the ones that were going to execute what the\nGermans told them to do. So, when we were standing on both sides, the German here,\nthis Shrot, started speaking in German, and said, \u201cYou have one minute to -- to be -- to\nsay your prayers, and you going to be shot.\u201d Just plainly, like that. Naturally, you can just\nimagine what happens to -- to a person when you hear something like that. We were all\nlike paralyzed. I mean, I -- I couldn\u2019t even move. The only thing was that my brain was\nworking. And when I looked at my mother, I -- and I saw her -- her -- her face was white\nlike a sheet of paper, and her heart was -- you c -- you could see it was, you know,\nbeating so hard I could almost hear it. And I guess prompted me to do something that\nmaybe normally I wouldn\u2019t do. I was so frightened for her and -- and they were the only\nones that I had. So I -- when he finished talking, I simply, without even thinking any\nmore, I jumped out, and he was standing us -- oh, in front of me, in front of the --\nbetween the two graves, and I jumped, and I jumped on his back, and grabbed him by his\nneck, and I-I always had long fingernails, and I -- you know, pressed as hard as I could.\nI\u2019m sure that I have wounded him in some areas. And I realized that if I -- I -- I didn\u2019t\nknow what else to do, I had no gun or anything. And the only thing I -- I -- at that\nmoment, my instinct told me just to cling on his back li -- on his back like that, that at --\nat a point like this, he will not be able to do anything to me. Which proved to be actually\ncorrect, because the Germans sta -- or the Ukraines started screaming, \u201cShoot her, shoot\nher.\u201d But of course, if they shot me, they would have sh-shot him, too, so tho -- they\ndidn\u2019t do it. In the meantime, as I was lying there -- as I was al -- still clinging to him,\nfinally we both fell down, and they -- they came and they pulled him away from me. As\nthey pulled him away, I realized that, as far as my life was concerned is -- it was finished.\nBut it took all the situation, and all the development, took so much time, that it was\ngetting dark outsir -- outside already. And then, when they pulled him away, they decided\nto shoot me. So they came to him, they told him shoot the beast, you know. In German is,\nsheeza de bestia, means shoot the be -- beast. And he said I -- and I heard it, m-my\nEnglish was good, and I could understand every word he was saying, and he said, \u201cNo, I\nwill not shoot her yet. She must,\u201d -- the word was edwastonsin, must perform, or dance,\nor -- what he meant by it is I -- he wanted me to -- to beg for our life and you know, go\ncrazy and kiss his feet, or whatever he planned. So he said, \u201cShe must dance a little\nbefore I shoot her.\u201d Finally -- and as I fell, I -- I decided I was not going to move no\nmatter what happens, that I\u2019m not going to budge. So they checked me, checked my\npulse, checked this, and it was -- stupid idiot couldn\u2019t even find a pulse, so they decided\nthat I was dead. And what happened --",
        "A: Not yet, not yet. But then, one person, who became my sister-in-law later --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: But then one person, who became my sister-in-law later, a lady, she started crying,\nyou know, because people didn\u2019t know how to react. They didn\u2019t know what was good to\nsay, and what was bad to say. So she started crying, \u201cPlease help her, she must have just\nfainted.\u201d And you know, when I heard her say that -- I still remember it to this -- you\nknow, you remember every reaction, every -- what-whatever I felt. And she -- and I said\nto m-m -- was thinking to myself, \u201cMy God, please don\u2019t say anything, I don\u2019t want them\nto know that I am alive.\u201d And then when they finally pulled me away, they marched all\nthe people into the empty barracks that they had, you know, left, you know, unoccupied.\nAnd -- and there were two barracks, and they filled the two barracks, you know, they had\nbunkbeds over there. The amount of people from our camp was about 300, so it wasn\u2019t\nsuch a great number. And they put us in the barracks. I was still lying down on the\nground, and suddenly the -- 1t was dark already, and we heard American planes -- or were\n-- they were Russian planes, actually. They were cruising around and -- and dropping\nbombs. So we -- we knew about it, and we were quite aware of it. So they didn\u2019t do\nanything, and they had searchlights that they stopped using, because they were afraid that\nthey were going to bomb -- bomb us. And later, when the bombing stopped, they turned\non the searchlight, and they were going round and round, which would put lights on me,\ntoo, on the area where I was lying down. Anyhow, at that time, I realized, and I got used\nto the dark, and I saw the barracks, I had no idea that the people were marched into the\nbarracks at that time. But I was thinking, and I se -- and they were on stilts. So I had no\nother place where I could crawl to hide, and I just thought that if I do that, maybe that\nwill help, and I did that. And as I crawled under the barrack, I heard people walk, and I\nheard voices, even. And I recognized Polish, and Jewish, and I -- I -- I realized that these\nwere the people that I came with. Because at first I thought maybe they were other Jews\nfrom some other places, and -- and so on. And so anyhow, I still was sitting under the\nbarrack, and -- and I felt every time I was breathing, I felt I -- I was picking the whole\nbarrack on my back, you know. And nothing was happening after, you know, until\nmorning. At dusk in -- I realized -- and I was evidently not far from the little stairs, from\nthe you know, barrack. And I saw people walking down, and I saw they were having, you\nknow, all shoes, and you know, clogs, and this and that, which did not indicate that they\nwere Ss -- people that came from other places, that they were inmates from the -- from a\ncamp. And as I saw this, I decided I will step out, and -- I couldn\u2019t sit there underneath\nthe ba -- the barrack forever. So I stepped out, and as I came out from underneath the\nbarrack, here were stairs, and where I came out of the barrack, there was my father, my\nmother, my brother, all in tears, and terrified. Because, what happened -- evidently they\nwere communicating at night, and realizing that I -- my body was not in the same place\nwhere they shot me. Did I mention about the shooting before? No, I did not, you see,\nthat\u2019s what happens when you don\u2019t -- don\u2019t have a -- a schedule. Anyhow, after they put\nthe people in the barracks, you know, after they marched them there, the guy came over\nand shot me. And my head was like this. Now you most probably can still see a scar. I\ncan see it.",
        "A: I can see it. It was right here. But you know, so many years, and whatever. So when --\nhe shot me, and since my face was only halfway exposed, and the other half was -- was,\nyou know, flush to the ground, he -- when he shot me, the bullet grazed my forehead, and\nI came from one point, out through the other. So I wasn\u2019t hurt greatly, or anything and --\nand it didn\u2019t even hurt for some reason, I don\u2019t know why. Maybe I was too excited. And",
        "A: Shrot.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, he was standing over me, that\u2019s how close, and -- and he missed it. Because it\ncould have been obvious that when he\u2019s going to shoot me, he will shoot me right -- you\nknow, I -- right in my head all -- my temple, and be finished with it, but he did not.\nMaybe he was scared for his own life because they we -- started bombing.",
        "A: Wh-Who?",
        "A: Y -- no, they -- there were the other -- no, the other ones, the other Ukrainians, that\nthey were packing everybody in the barracks. Now, there might have been a couple other\nones with him. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m sure there were, because since I wasn\u2019t killed yet, you\nknow, they thought maybe I\u2019Il jump up again. So -- and then they all left. But when the\nbombings stopped, they evidently, like I said, communicated among them, and they\nrealized that my body was missing. So, what they assumed that the Jewish people took\nme, and hid me. And the Jewish people when they found out -- they also found out that I\nwasn\u2019t there, because they came and asked them where I am, and I was still under the\nbarrack. So they said they didn\u2019t know. So they didn\u2019t -- so the Jews thought that the\nGermans took me, that, you know, I was dead and the Germans took me, and wanted to\ncover up -- because basically what we later found out, that they did not have a order to\nshoot all the people. And this is what they wanted to do. Without the order they would\nhave shot all of us, have -- has -- ha -- it wasn\u2019t for the incident and the situation that I\nsomewhat created not -- not knowing they would have shot all of us. But since the time\nlapsed, and it got dark, and the bombing started, they were worrying about their own\nlives, and therefore, all this stopped. And they didn\u2019t want to leave us on the grounds,\nbecause with a mass of people like that, you never know what they may do. So they were\nafraid of a riot, that they wouldn\u2019t be able to control us. So they put the people in the\nbarracks. And then -- of course, in the morning when I got out from the -- under the\nbarrack, I was shot. My face -- my face was somewhat bloody, but I scraped off the mo --\nmost of it, because I was curious what it was, and since I had one free hand to be able to\nmove, so I -- I touched it, and I realized that I wasn\u2019t hurt badly, and I -- and I am still\nalive. So when I c-came out, my parents were all in tears, and shock, and then when they\nrealize -- they all realize that I am alive, their first instinct was to -- to get rid of me\nsomewhat. I mean, not that they wanted to kill me or anything like that, but to hide me.\nAnd they decided to hide me under a mattress. It was not a mattress, but it was straw -- to\nhide me under the straw that -- you know. And the barrack was a long building, on both\nside were bunkbeds. And here in the middle was like an alley, you know, all the way\ndown. So they marched me, and they -- they put me under the straw. And -- all it was a\nfew minutes later, or it seemed like a few minutes later, this Shrot came, and he was\nentering the barrack from wa -- from one end, and walking with a gun in his hand, and\nscreaming, \u201cWo ist da bestia?\u201d Where 1s the beast. If you don\u2019t produce her right --\nimmediately, I\u2019m going to shoot everybody else. So I heard it, and I just knew it was bad,\nand I didn\u2019t want anything to happen to anybody else, and my parents and my brother. So\nI stepped out from it, and I knew that was the end of it, and I just simply decided that I\nam not going to be scared, that I am going to be proud, and I stepped out, and I said in\nGerman, \u201cHere I am.\u201d And then he grabbed me. Didn\u2019t shoot me. Evidently he had -- he\nhad orders from the German that was in charge of all the barracks, of all the Jews in\nVearshmeek. So he definitely had the orders not to shoot me. And so he grabbed me by\nmy hand, pulled me out and the -- the area -- the camp was wired all around with, I think,\nelectric wires, if I\u2019m not mistaken. And they -- he pulled me out and took me beyond the\nwires, you know, and pushed me in -- into a cab -- small cabin where they ke -- had wood\nfor fire and coal and so on. Was just a barely -- a place that I barely could -- could fit,\nbecause it was loaded with wood and lumber. And here I was, and then when he closed\nthe -- the -- locked the -- the cabin, he started shooting in the air, bang, bang, bang, you\nknow. And the people 1n con -- in the camp had said okay, this is the end of me because\nhe shot me. Well, that did not happen. A few minutes later, they send over the -- the\ncommander of the whole area, and he came in in his big, shiny boots, and guns, and\neverything, and he started speaking to me because he couldn\u2019t understand what happened\nto me. He saw a -- a wound right here, and he cou -- he says, \u201c\u201cWh-What happened to\nyou?\u201d So I says I -- and I tried to kind of minimize the whole thing and make it into\nsomething else, that -- not that I jumped him, that I wanted to play -- pray for my safety,\nand -- and he should leave me. As -- so I kind of did not say anything, I said I don\u2019t\nknow. Then he went to the back of my head, because he wanted to see if the bullet came\nout through there. I had a wound over there, but the -- the wound was from the butt of the\nrifle, you know, where they hit me before he shot me. So he couldn\u2019t understand, and he\nsays, \u201cWell, how did the bullet come?\u201d And he spoke to me German. \u201cHow did the bullet\ncome here, and then -- and -- and you are still here?\u2019 I -- I still told him that I didn\u2019t\nknow. But anyhow, at that point, when he finished talking to me, questioning me and so\non, he took me out, and of all the things, he took me near the barracks where they had a\nfirst aid station, you know, you know, kind of a improvised -- just anything. And he took\nme over there and had the people clean out -- clean up the wound, and put iodine,\nwhatever they did, and -- and bandage, and that\u2019s all. And then they put me in the\nbarracks, okay? That was one phase. And then while I wa -- I was in the barracks, we --\nwe were waiting, actually, for the -- for the trains to come. Th-The train -- the tra --\nrailroad tracks were outside the camp, and we were waiting for the trains to come.\nWhatever -- what actually happened, since the bombing, some of the tracks were\ndestroyed, and they could not come, so they had to do it the next day. So they came,\neverybody was gathering around, we ha -- and they thought it was a miracle, you know,\nhow Jewish people always think of a miracle. I mean, most probably other people, of\nother religion and so on will -- will kind of associate something like that with a miracle.\nSo he -- everybody was coming to me. I remember distinctly, now that -- a -- a man -- I\nmean, to me, he looked like a older man, he must have been in his early thir -- 30\u2019s, came\nto me, and by the way he was asking me questions, what happened and so on, I realized\nthat he most probably is a writer. And ch -- not changing the story, but -- but getting\nfinished with this, after the war I found this man, he lived in Israel. I found a book -- no-\nnot I, but my brother-in-law found it, cause he was working in a -- in -- in a library. He\nfound a book written by a guy named Moshe Porrot. And he was the one that wrote about\nthis incident and everything. Of course, he elaborated on it, and -- and stretched it, and\nwrote every detail of it. And after the war, when -- when I already had children and\neverything, my oldest son decided that this book, since 1t was written after the war, that it\nwas supposed to be registered at the Library of Congress, and so on. And we looked for\nit. We found the names, we found all kind of things, but we did not find the book.\nAnyhow, but it\u2019s still there, somewhere, with my name and whatever it is on it. So --",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: [indecipherable] back and forth.",
        "A: Maybe you will make sense of It.",
        "A: How?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t say anything about keeping her clothing, we -- in Auschwitz we were given --\nall -- whatever we wore, we had to -- they stripped us, yeah. I would like to say that with\n-- you know, with the beginning of when they took us to Auschwitz, because there is a\nawtul lot to it. But nobody had any -- their own clothing in Auschwitz, they took\neverything away.",
        "A: No, my mother died not in Auschwitz. She died in Ravensbrtck. So later, she survived\nsome time in Auschwitz, and then when they transferred us to Auschwitz, she got sick\nand when we were 1n viet -- in -- in Ravensbriick, she died over there after a few weeks.\nShe had a stroke, and she died over there. It was cold, it was February, of 19 -- 1945, I\nthink. And she -- she died, but she survived until -- until just about -- I would say about\ntwo months or so before they saved us. The Swedes came and took a number of Jewish\npeople and others -- a -- other people from the camp out, and to safety.",
        "A: Ravensbrick.",
        "A: Ravensbritck is the name in English, I think.",
        "A: When we got there, we got there j -- janu -- no, it was the end of \u201944 -- \u201944. And then,\nactually, it was already \u00b045, January \u00b045, cause my birthday was then, and they put us --\nfirst of all, we ha -- we were put on a march, and this march was very famous, they called\nit the Death March. Not only because ou -- of our group, but they were marching people\nfrom different camps. I -- I don\u2019t know exactly where they were marching them, but since\nit was February already -- January, February, I mean, the march actually occur --\noccurred in January, okay? So they were marching all these people, and it was snowing,\nand freezing, and -- and winters in Poland are very bad, as bad almost as in -- in some\nareas in Russia. So people were starving, and dying, and they were also dying of bullets,\nand through -- by the time we arrived anyone -- anyone to our destination, there was\nhardly anybody left. So we were -- I don\u2019t -- my mother and I were walking from\nAuschwitz on the middle of a big road, everybody -- and through villages or little towns,\nGerman towns, but everybody disappeared, and they were hidden in their houses, and we\ncould even see them trying to peek out through the windows, because they evidently had\nstrict orders not to be around. So -- and nobody was able to help us. Some people tried to\nescape, and -- but the ones who escape were anyhow killed later. So that\u2019s what\nhappened.",
        "A: Okay, we -- we went to -- we finally arrived in Ravensbruck, which was also a\nconcentration camp, a big one. At that time, they didn\u2019t have all of it -- all the ba --\nbarracks occupied. It was a tremendous concentration camp. Evidently they send those\npeople to -- to a crematoria in [indecipherable] so on, but they got rid of them, whatever\nway it was. So when we got there, 1t wasn\u2019t -- it wasn\u2019t all occupied, and we were put in\nsome barracks, and that was -- that was already end of -- end of January. Yeah, exactly,\nyes, that was the end -- end of January. Am I saying anything different?",
        "A: Well, I knew it was January when we were transferred, and we were on a platform\ntrain, you know, all of us, I don\u2019t know how many people they put on a platform, and it\nwas dangerous too, because we could have just fallen off while the train was moving.",
        "A: She died in Ravensbruck.",
        "A: No, no she didn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t have anything. Maybe you are talking about a spoon, and\na comb, and this and that, those things, okay. These things everybody had, because once\nwe were put in a concentration camp, they let us keep a spoon, and a -- and -- and -- and a\ncomb, and a little piece of soap. These things we had. And the clothing that we had were\nawkward clothing that were given to us by the Germans after they took our clothes away.",
        "A: Oh well, that was later, when she passed away. Well, I -- I would like to tell the -- the\nwhole story, because that way it is -- doesn\u2019t even have a connection.",
        "A: I cut it o -- I cut it away.",
        "A: I know, okay, but so why do you need it here?",
        "A: Uh-huh, oh, okay.",
        "A: Oh, I see, she wanted, okay.",
        "A: When I came to the -- I -- when they -- when she died, she w -- she had a stroke while\nwe were standing outside on a roll call. And it was freezing, and she had evidently a\nstroke, and she died. So they made me, and a friend of mine carry her to a barrack where\nthey called it like a -- they -- hospital thing. It was not. They called it revere, which\nevidently in German it means hospital. So they asked me to take her over there. We took\nher over there, and put her on a -- on a bunkbed, and she actually was still alive, and --\nbut they would not let me attend to her. I don\u2019t know what I could have done, but they\nchased me out. So that evening, we were given -- once a day we were ga -- given food,\nyou know, soup made out of old, unpeeled potatoes, and whatever stuff 1t was. So when I\nreceived that, I took it to -- to this revere, to make sh -- make sure that maybe she would\ne-eat something. When I got into the place, there were some women that were supposed\nto be nurses, or whatever it is. And when s -- they saw me -- and they were Jewish,\nactually -- so one came to me, \u201cOh, you came to see your mother, your mother died.\u201d It\nwas a terrible shock to me, I cannot even describe it. So I ran -- no, I fainted, actually. At\nthat point when they told me this, I fainted, and the little container with soup and\neverything spilled. Then when I came to, I went to her, and -- and all I could do 1s close\nher eyes, and -- and then they told me I must leave. So you know, I wanted to have\nsomething from her. I have the hair here. And --",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. So -- what -- the only thing that I took was a pair of shoes that she was wearing.\nHow I saved them I\u2019Il never know, but I had the whole pair of shoes. They took pictures\nof the shoes over there, don\u2019t they have evidence?",
        "A: You didn\u2019t see the pictures, but anyhow, they had -- took a picture of the spoon, the\ncomb, the soap, and a scarf, and the shoes. Okay, I had two shoes, both of them. And I --\nlater on, when they released -- they saved us, the Swedes came and saved us, I was able\nto take it out, although I wasn\u2019t supposed to because they were afraid of diseases. And\nyou know, we were under quarantine for a month or five weeks, or so. So I ha-had the\nshoes in a box. I donated one shoe when I went to Israel, and one I still have here. And I\nwanted to donate it to a museum here, but I didn\u2019t want them to throw it on a pile with\nanything else, but they did not want to, or couldn\u2019t accommodate me when I wanted them\nto -- to place it all individual as a -- as a group, the comb, and the scarf, and the spoon,\nand the shoes to -- and to put a name on it. It meant a awful lot to me, and 1t meant almost\nas much as having a -- a -- a burial place for my mother, a place where -- where there 1s\nevidence that she existed. Where -- to this day, actually, I am s -- very sentimental about\nthe idea of having it recorded anywhere. Like for example, unfortunately it\u2019s a sad story.\nI lost my son -- my oldest son was sick and he died like about 12 years ago, and when I\nput a -- his stone -- when they erected his stone, that tombstone, I also made sure that\nthere\u2019ll be evidence of -- of his past, so I wrote down that he was son of survivors, and\ngrandson and -- and uncle of Holocaust victims. And I put my parents name at the end to\n-- to at least have evidence, and have my parent\u2019s name, my brother\u2019s name anywhere on\n-- you know, for people -- people will not know anyhow, but the fact that it is there\nmakes me feel better. I\u2019m going to do the same thing evide -- I already have written my\nepitaph, this -- it most probably sounds awful, but this is -- and I wanted also my parents\nname on it, and evidence that they were Holocaust victims, and so on. So --",
        "A: I wrote it already, yes. I wrote it, but -- and I give it to my son-in-law, because my\nchildren didn\u2019t want to hear of it. It was too disturbing taw -- to them. But I am no -- I --\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to be that way written, and I also even demanded of my son-in-law\nthat should they not have enough room on the stone, to -- to add -- get an additional\nstone, and put --",
        "A: I have it written here.",
        "A: Yeah, but I's -- right there, but it\u2019s scribbled.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Yeah. Ill show. I can tell you actually what I wrote. I wrote my name, you know,\nwhen time comes, and the date of birth. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019m going to die, so they\u2019 ll\nhave to put it themselves, and -- and I -- I wrote a -- a Holocaust survivor, daughter,\ngranddaughter, and sister of Holocaust victims, and -- and I wrote down, at this resting\nplace together -- I mean, I -- I worded it better. To -- to -- for [indecipherable] get it.",
        "A: I scribbled, but I want to, you know, w-w-wait a second. It is morbid, I know it, but\nthis is life. If I -- I don\u2019t know when I\u2019m going to die, and I am not looking forward to it,\nbut when I do, I want to make sure that it\u2019s written only the way I want it. Okay. I says,\nHolocaust survivor, devoted wife and mother, and date and whatever. Daughter, sister\nand granddaughter of Holocaust vics -- victims. And I got the names of my parents, Noah\nand Bluma, and Moshe Bear Blass. Israel and Luba Blass, which are my grandparents,\nand sharing this resting place -- what did I say here? For everlasting love and eternal pl --\npeace. And on -- well I still did not get it. Actually, what I said here, in honor -- honored\nand loving memory, or remembrance. Well, I -- I have to finish it.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Have I what?",
        "A: Well, it -- it evidently is so, because they say your past is -- is dominating, or shaping\nyour presents. So, evidently I would have been somebody else. Maybe not emotionally,\nor so on, cause I don\u2019t think that has changed much, but as -- as a person, I would have\nbeen somebody else. I always wanted to become a physician, a doctor and so on, but so --\nbut 1-it did have a influence I -- I would say.",
        "A: Well, I -- the way did -- yeah -- in a way I\u2019m glad the way it made me, in a way,\nbecause -- but then, you cannot, everybody\u2019s satisfied with -- with what they are, not\nthinking what they would be, and -- and if they would be happy, or whatever it is, I don\u2019t\nknow that. But it -- I have no complaints about who I am. Of course, I would have liked\nto be smarter, I would la -- I would have liked to -- to write a -- a -- write my own story\nproperly, and I would like many other things, but I evidently am not -- I\u2019m not made for\nthat.",
        "A: Well, but you see, I -- I do not have any -- I do not have my -- myself the other way, I\ncannot compare. So, whatever I am now, this evidently I was -- I was -- I am -- I consider\nmyself a good person. I consider myself very emotional and -- and caring, and I -- I love\nmy children, and that means more than -- than you can tell about many people here in this\ncountry, unfortunately. So I don\u2019t think I would be -- want to be another person. Of\ncourse, if I did not have this horrible memory, maybe it would be a little bit different. But\nit mase -- makes me more humble, and -- and understanding of other people\u2019s problems,\nand -- and for one thing, in all my life, and -- and during the time that I was raising my\nchildren, I have never discriminated against anybody\u2019s religion. As a matter of fact, I -- I\nam full of a -- a special respect for people of different religion. And I am also interested\nabout knowing about different religion and so on, and always -- as a matter of fact, they\njust had on television something about religion, and -- and I read, and I write, and I --\nabout it. I mean, not write anything that would be of -- for anybody to read, but for\nmyself.",
        "A: What are you looking for?",
        "A: Well, yes. I -- I am tolerant, because on many occasions there are things that happens\nto a person during her lifetime, and so on, and somehow, comparing to what was\nhappening to me, I dismiss the presents that it isn\u2019t so bad, and always make it look, or\nmake myself feel better about it, and -- than I normally would feel comparing to -- to the\npast, like you know -- so --",
        "A: Well, you cannot help it. You cannot help it, because how do you think of anything, or\nsay anything tha -- we do everything by comparison in our life. And how do we know we\ndid good? We know that we did better than the other person, then we did good, okay. But\nthen another person will come and do better than us, so how do you go -- y-you cannot\nestablish unless you compare with everything like that.",
        "A: Oh, as far as religion is concerned?",
        "A: Well, I am still a Jew, and I always will be. I have no intention of changing my\nreligion. I may not be able to be as observant as I should be, and I realize that, but those\nthings somehow don\u2019t -- don\u2019t mean that much to me. I don\u2019t know how much you know\nabout Jewish religion, do you?",
        "A: Some. Well, for example, observant Jew will -- will have a dietary -- observe dietary\nlaws -- not that he will eat anything else. Now, we don\u2019t eat pork, we don\u2019t eat certain --\nlike fish without scales, and so on, whatever it is. And we don\u2019t eat milk when we eat\nmeat. Our animals, cattle or -- or -- or chicken, has to be slaughtered in a very merciful\nway. In other words, to a point where it\u2019s almost not -- that they don\u2019t feel, you know, the\n-- the act of killing, in other words. And if a animal is slaughtered not -- we don\u2019t use\nguns to slaughter the animal. It has to be completely painless, and totally sudden. Other\nthan that, the -- the meat is considered un -- unclean to eat, because the animal suffered,\nand so on. Well, this is as much I understand about it, okay? So -- but I don\u2019t eat meat\nanyhow, so it doesn\u2019t make any difference.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It is such a pity that I cannot speak about everything from the beginning of my -- be --\njust before the war started [indecipherable] the time would be so important. Then also,\nfrom that point on, until the end, it would have made the most fascinating writing all\ntogether, and -- and I am upset about it, because I have it written in -- 1n parts like this\nsituation with this Shrot. So, unfortunately, maybe someday somebody\u2019s going to make\nsu -- sense of all the writings, and the tapes that I will have, and put together something.",
        "A: Oh, you want me to, that way? Okay. Well, okay, and now I have to speak of my\nmother\u2019s death at -- at that time, and from then on. Now, with my --",
        "A: Yes, I --",
        "A: -- I know, but I'll have to pick up from that point.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: So, when my mother died, a week later, they have send informati -- or told us that we\nare eligible to be saved, taken out of the camp. They didn\u2019t say by whom, and how, they\nonly said that we were going to be rescued, and allowed to be free, all we have to do 1s\ncome to the office, whatever -- wherever the office was, or wherever it was. That -- and\nto give our name, and all the information, and when the time comes, to -- we\u2019ll be\nshipped out. Well, I -- I didn\u2019t believe it, I really didn\u2019t because they did it on so many\noccasions that way, where they were promising the person that you going to -- you -- you\ncoming on, like for example in the camp where I was in Vearshmeek, at one time they\ncame and they told everybody, is there anybody that\u2019s got relatives in Israel? Well,\nnaturally some people did. So they found one la -- they -- the one lady that somehow was\nnot afraid to say it, and they told her, \u201cPack up all your things, whatever you have, and\nwe will -- we are going to send you to Israel.\u201d Well, it was not true, because what they\ndid, when she came out of the camp, all her things -- and she was a lady that lived in this\ntown, so she had many things with her that she was able to -- to take, and they shot her,\nand that was all. So of course that -- that memory stayed with me, and I didn\u2019t believe\nanything they -- they were doing. So when I heard this, I said oh yes, sure. But then I was\nthinking, I says, I lost my parents, lost my brother, I\u2019m by myself, where am I going to\ngo? And I -- I really didn\u2019t want to, I had no desire to live, because I was hungry all the\ntime. I was miserable, I had no place to -- to be comfortable for minute, or anything. So it\nwas very, very distressful and painful for me. So I really didn\u2019t care to live any more. So\nI says, well, that\u2019s a god -- a good way out, I am just going to go, and let them do\nwhatever they want to with me. And I signed up. And I had two friends from before the\nwar yet, that we happened to be together as school girls, and I made them do the same,\nbecause they -- they relied on what I wanted to do. So they came too, and sure enough\ntwo days later, they -- three -- three or four large buses, they looked like -- like streetcars,\nyou know, they removed all the junk, or whatever it is, for people to be able to be there,\nand they put us on there. They came with -- with some provision, food and stuff like that,\nand they took us in -- they took us to Sweden. We had to go by --",
        "A: To -- to g -- get on the transport to -- they should not kill me, that I -- I\u2019m -- they am --\nthey going to -- m -- a -- how do you say it, I don\u2019t know. That I was going to survive the\ncamp, and they were going to take me out to another country, or to it -- that I am going to\nbe free. And that was very hard to understand, we just didn\u2019t believe it. So, what they did",
        "A: Oh yeah, you see, I was liberated when I was in Sweden already. So the Swedish\ntrucks came, and they had food -- canned food, and stuff, whatever they could. And they\ngave us food, and -- and we were driving -- riding through -- by land, Denmark, and then\nto Sweden. From Denmark we had to go by -- by boat, I think. Isn\u2019t it bal -- Baltic Sea?\nAnyhow, yes, so then they took us to -- we were in Copenhagen for awhile, on the trains,\nbecause they transferred us on trains, after the buses, and we stayed there, and do -- we\nactually slept there, and they gave us food, because they were afraid of getting diseases.\nSo -- and then from the trains, we were taking on a ship. And the ship took us to a port in\nSweden. It was -- forgot the name of it, it was Checkenhaven, that\u2019s how you pronounced\nit in Swedish, it was a port in Sweden where we arrive. From there they took us to a\nspecial places, because they expected us, and they paid -- paid for us actually, with\ncoffee, penicillin, and aspirin. Those -- the Germans needed it, so they release I don\u2019t\nknow how many people, three, 400 people of different religion, Polish, an-and -- and\nJewish, and whatever it 1s, it did not make any difference at that time, but only the ones\nthat signed up for it. So they -- those were the people that they -- that they we-were\nsaved, and we were under quarantine together, and I was there with my belongings, with\nmy mother\u2019s things, and they didn\u2019t take it away. And we were there for a month, and\nthey dis -- they distributed us, or send us to different places, where they were going to\naccept us to work. Like, I was taken to a hotel in Oopsalla. It\u2019s a most historic c -- c --\ncity in s -- 1 -- in Sweden, and also the -- the oldest college -- university cities in Europe.\nSo I was there, and I worked there, and then later on I found out about my -- not relatives,\nbut I found out about my friend whom I knew before the war -- not before the war, but\nactually during the war, before the concentration camp. And he found me, and he wrote a\nletter, and this is how I came -- and he was in Germany at that time, so from Sweden they\nallowed me to go to Germany, they pol -- paid my transportation, and from -- no,\nbasically it wasn\u2019t that way. They send me to Poland because they could not send me to a\nforeign country, because they had -- they were sending me to my native country, so they\nsend me to Poland. And in Poland, m-my friend, he was -- he became my husband later\non -- knew where I was, and he send somebody to take me to Germany, and this 1s how\nwe got together, and we got married.",
        "A: Would you like to have something to drink?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I-Is this going to be on it?",
        "A: Going to have to erase a awful lot when --",
        "A: -- what [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, first we went from Copenhagen to Sweden.",
        "A: Not yet, not yet. The war ended May 10\", and we were -- we left February.",
        "A: Well, first of all, we were transported by buses, and a very young Swedish man, as a\nmatter of fact, my age at that time, although some were Jewish that volunteered. You\nknow how it is, you know, just like the people that volunteer now to go to Greece, and so\non, to go to Turkey. So they volunteered, and they were driving. There was one attendant,\nand one driver, or maybe both of them and they were changing, you know, places. And\nthey took us to Copenhagen, okay? From over there, we went by train -- no, by sea to\nSweden. And from -- from Sweden -- no, we -- I lived in Sweden for about eight, nine\nmonths, and then when all this has developed that you could hear from different people,\nand about different people, it can correspond and so on, and that was the time when my\nhusband wrote a letter to the es -- ac-actually, 1t wasn\u2019t my husband that wrote the letter,\nit was my brother-in-law that wrote a letter looking for his sister-in-law, and I was n-not\neven close to being a sister-in-law or anything, but they evidently give priority to people\nthat were related, you know, and looking for them. So the letter came to me from him,\nand once we established our places, and were able to correspond, then we -- my husband\narranged what I told you before, that I had to come to Poland, from Poland I went to\nBerlin, because that\u2019s where he was. He had to wait because he found his father\nsomewhere, and he had to wait for his father to come to Berlin. So, we all came to Berlin,\nfrom Berlin we went to a camp, a -- oh my God, what was it? Buch -- no, I forgot already\nthe name of the camp. Anyhow -- Bergen-Belsen, okay, 1t was camp of Bergen-Belsen.\nAnd of course, the concentration camp was completely flattened, burned and everything.\nThere was no sign of concentration camp. After the war, you know, and th-there was so\nmuch typhus and everything. So it was burned down, and I am not sure if that was the\nonly reason that they burned it down, they just wanted to burn the evidence. And -- but\nnearby, like a couple miles away from the camp, was a camp where the Germans were --\nI don\u2019t know exactly what it was there bef-before the war, but it did not look like it was\nespecially built for them or anything, there were brick duplexes built, and th-the Germans\noccupied it, the ones that overseed the concentration camp and so on. So they occupied\nthe camp. Well, after the war, they put -- the Germans left, naturally, and they put all the\npeople from concentration camps, most of them were sick and so on, and he -- they put\nthem into all their apartments and the houses, whatever. And they immediately\nestablished -- they were doctors that came there from the States, and -- and from Canada,\nand they establish, you know, just like a little -- tiny, little complex -- living complex like\n-- it wasn\u2019t big enough to be a village, but it was like a camp, and they assisted the Jews,\nand there were all kind of newcomers that would come from concentration camps all\nover. They had no place to go, and they found out that this was the point of gathering on\nthis -- you know. So they would come over there, and that\u2019s where we lived. We lived\nthere for several months, and -- and that\u2019s where we got married, too. And when -- after\nthat, we had to go to Stuttgart. In Stuttgart, evidently, we were able to organize transport\nto [indecipherable] the United States. By then we already -- my husband established\nwhere his brother was living, and he was living in -- in Chicago. I discovered purely by\naccident, through a man that was in the army from Canada -- he lived -- cause when he\nwas telling me that his family was from Vearshmeek, and so on. So I got all excited, and\nI told him -- and I told him about my family, that my -- my grandmother lived in -- in\nToronto. So, through him I found out my relatives, and then I found the aunt, and -- and -\n- and -- in Charleston. And -- and that\u2019s how I came to Charleston. You know, it\u2019s so\nconfusing to remember about all these places, when you went, and when you came.\nAnyhow, this is -- through him, purely by accident, I found out -- I had no information,\nbut I found all this from him, and I was able to get in touch with my relatives in Canada, I\nvisited them later, and then whatever.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. Yes, th -- not before the war. That was a funny incident, too. When we\nlived already where I -- where I told you the place, before they took us to this camp in\nVearshmeek, and at that time they were actually concentrating all the people from\ndifferent towns, no -- small villages and towns, in ve -- in Vearshmeek. And my father\nborrowed a sewing machine, that was before I -- I had kindergarten. And he decided to --\nto sew things. He didn\u2019t know how to sew, but he -- he knew how to cut, and prepare the\nmaterial, and I knew how to sew. So we did many things for people, like most of them --\npeople were coming, and they wanted like a one piece suit, and you know, pockets, and\nthis, and my husband-to-be came to our place, and he wanted my father to make a suit\nwith different hidden pockets here, and here, and here, and whatever it is. So my father\nwas doing it for him, and I was the one that was sewing it. And that was the time I met --\nmet him. He was sitting in our room with -- as big as this here, here, and a couch, and\nbed, and whatever it is. And -- and I remember when he came, he had money, he saved\nmoney. He was -- they were very rich, and we went through a -- a time where my father\nleft everything, and the money was not available, because either it was in a bank, or\nwhatever it was. So whatever he brought with them back to Vearshmeek was not that\nmuch to -- but Leon had all this, as a matter of fact, he had it hidden in a shoe -- in a heel\nof a shoe. And so -- anyhow -- so the reason I am saying it, because he came with a\nmaybe five or 10 pound bag of apples, and he was sitting on the couch, and eating one\napple after the other, which struck me funny. And we were not able to buy that, and\nmaybe bought three, four apples for everybody. One -- and so this is how I remember him\nthe first time. And then, when we were in -- you are tired already, huh? And then when\nwe were moved to the camp, he was moved to Myoufka at that time, okay? And I already\nlived in this camp, and -- but they couldn\u2019t establish themself to -- to the point where they\nwere useful to do anything, they didn\u2019t do anything, they were just in a camp, living\nthere. So he -- and there was a doctor there that was from my husband\u2019s hometown, so\nthey were friends. So they, somehow, somewhat made arrangement, my husband had\ndiamonds, and money saved, and whatever. So evidently he bribed somebody, and it\u2019s\nawtul word to use, isn\u2019t it, but it happened. So that they were able to transfer him. So they\ntrans -- transferred him, let\u2019s say this is the camp where I was, nearby was a camp which\nwas producing electricity, and they needed people, so my husband and this doctor were\ntransferred here, okay? So we were nearby, and then I was able to see him, and not once,\ntwice, or whatever it is. Then they combined all -- the both camps into one, cause they\nneeded people where we were. So my husband came, and the doctor, and he had a -- a --\nhe was working, they -- a -- occupied him to be the main person to see to people that got\nwounded during the work, and so on. So that\u2019s how I met my husband, and very casual\nand so on. But somehow, we knew each other, evidently he thought more of it than I did,\nbecause he took, you know, all the pain to find me after the war, you know. And when he\nfound me, and when I -- and when they wrote, I was glad in a way, cause it was the only\nperson that was looking for me. So I -- I came to Poland, and I came to Germany, and\nthen we went to Bergen-Belsen, and we lived there until we were able to go to -- to\nHamburg and wait for the ship to come to the -- to America.",

The war ended in \u201945, in -- in May, and --\nand I meanwhile was in Sweden and came back, and whatever it -- yeah, that\u2019s when it\nwas.",
        "A: Well, I found out -- first of all, I was looking, and I couldn\u2019t find them. And they were\nvery efficient because we were writing to different Jewish organizations who were\noccupying themself, and making a point of finding people, and they did not find. But\nthen, later on, I found from the people who were in the same camp and whatever it is, or\nwhatever, bits and pieces of information that he was sick, and that was in Brunow, a\ncamp near Auschwitz. It was a camp for -- for men, and that one person was sure that my\nbrother died, because he saw him in a very bad state, and then my father most probably ti\n-- dead, too. And if he did not, then the -- the -- at time when they went on this march\ncamp, which was the same time that we went, he might have not survived the camp,\neither, because I was never able to find him. That was all evidence and information I got.",
        "A: More about after they ended, because I got pictures, and -- from people that -- that had\nbits of pieces of -- from either -- I don\u2019t know how they had it, don\u2019t ask me how, but\nthey -- they somehow obtained some little pictures here and there. Because we -- we were\nnot able to bring pictures or anything, cause you know, when -- when IJ arrived in\nAuschwitz, and they were taking us to -- they said to showers, and this and that, when\nthey stripped our clothes, we -- we thought that they were taking us to crematorium. But\nof course, it did not happen, it happened different. So when they took us there, I had with\nme some pictures, and money -- little money, which mean -- meant nothing. And they --\nthat was the only pictures I had, and the Germans would not let us take anything when\nthey -- when we went 1n the showers, and we -- we thought we were going to be gassed.\nAnd so they told us only to take the soap, and whatever.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",

And so they told us only to take the soap, and whatever it 1s\nin. But we came out the other way of the -- of the room, and we didn\u2019t have anything. So\nthey -- we were given some clothes, and some didn\u2019t fit, and of course in -- in a way we\nwere able to trade it with the people that got too large clothes, to get it smaller, and\nwhatever it is. And the clothes consisted only of -- of overdress, and clogs, and that\u2019s all.\nWe didn\u2019t have any undergarments or any, and that\u2019s -- that\u2019s all we were given. So we\njust really didn\u2019t have anything.",
        "A: Yes, I would like to speak about that, because it made -- first of all, a -- I was looking\nevery -- everywhere if I was not going to be oppressed, and -- and brutalized, and -- and\nhurt, and whatever, just -- I didn\u2019t know what to expect. And I was amazed, I was amazed\nthat actually there was kindness that I could notice in people\u2019s eyes, and behavior,\nwhatever it is. Of course, I did not need anything, because I was already going to be taken\ncare, and helped by my relatives that waited for me. Ellis Island -- I think at that time\nEllis Island was still in operation, 50 - 55 years ago, don\u2019t you think so? So -- so I didn\u2019t\nneed any specific help or anything, but -- and when I came to Charleston, I didn\u2019t need\nthat either, because my aunt helped us find a little apartment, and we lived very, very\nlimited. I mean, basically poorly on -- comparing to how I lived in Europe before the war,\nbut everything was good because of the fact that we were no oppressed, and -- and\ndiscriminated against, and so on. And I was amazed, I couldn\u2019t believe it. Then, I mean, I\n-- f-for example, I went to a doctor, you know, like in the process of -- of living in\nCharleston, I -- I had to find a doctor for different -- you know, you get -- all of a sudden\nyou get illnesses when you didn\u2019t even feel anything before. And I found a doctor who\nwas not Jewish, and I didn\u2019t even think anything about it. And he was so kind that -- that\nwhen I -- when I think about him to this day, I -- I have to cry, because that\u2019s how kind\nhe was to me. So, really, all these things like that, putting together, contributed to -- to --\nin a way to my recovery, and believing in human goodness, and so on. So I was very,\nvery happy to see that, and very amazed. I mean, I -- I -- things did not cease to amaze\nme, as it -- as it came along. Like, for example, why -- I don\u2019t know whether I should\nmention that, but I was not aware in those days of the situation between blacks and\nwhites. Because all I knew is from movies, and I -- I could not find anything basically\nbad and discriminating, you know, that whites did to blacks. But then, for example, on --\nin Charleston you -- it was obvious that blacks were supposed to sit to the back of the\nbus, and they were announcing, actually, for -- you know, people to vacate to the -- the\nfront area, and whatever it is. So, it -- it upsets me -- it upset me a lot, but there was\nnothing I could do. Then another thing that I noticed, for example, black people in -- in\nCharleston were very kind. I -- I\u2019m not talking about young people -- very young people,\nbecause they were either very young people, or kids, so you don\u2019t expect of them to\nbehave differently. But people sort of a little bit older, you know, where I walked -- when\nI walked the streets, or something, I noticed that they were taking off their hat, and they\nwere greeting me. And I couldn\u2019t understand why -- why -- why. I came to my aunt once,\nand I asked her, \u201cWhy do people greet me here all the time?\u201d I says, \u201cI don\u2019t know\nthem.\u201d So she said it was a -- a custom for them to do that. So, I -- I thought it was\nremarkable, and felt very sorry about it when I, later on, understood what was going on.\nThat\u2019s all.",
        "A: [have a very good background of Latin, and in German also. And I was able to\ntranslate things, but only the reading -- when I was reading it. When people were\nspeaking to me, it all sounded like, you know, jumble bumble, whatever it is. And I had\ndifficulties, but I made my point to learn how to speak. I -- my first book was, \u201cThe Good\nEarth.\u201d Can you imagine to try to un -- the reason I picked, \u201cThe Good Earth,\u201d because I\nread it in Polish, and therefore I -- if I didn\u2019t understand it all, I would j -- kind of make\nbelieve that I do, and whatever it is. And that was the first book I read.",
        "A: Yes, well my husband, when we came -- and I told you that my aunt and my uncle\nwere the ones that sponsored us, and they helped us a little bit. And my -- my uncle had a\n-- a Supermarket, but the supermarket was not what -- what you call a supermarket now, it\nwas a grocery store, a large grocery store, and people were picking their own stuff, and\nthen coming to the register, so it was like a supermarket. So, since my husband learned --\nmy husband was actually a businessman before the war, and he was like about nine years\nolder than I am, so he was already a young man, able to work and -- and sustain himself.\nAnd -- and in -- in Charleston, he evidently, since he did not have anything else that he\ncould understand well, he w-was working in the business of grocery. And a year and a\nhalf later, he was able to buy a grocery store, a supermarket from a person -- of course,\nwe didn\u2019t have any money to buy it, but he was paying for 1t monthly as -- as 1t went, and\nthen we had a supermarket that we -- we moved to another part of town, and -- so he was\ndoing this, and then I was helping him. And then later on, he went in the business of\nwrecking. Wrecking was very prominent in a way that everybody was -- was wrecking.\nThey had houses from before the Civil War, and whatever it is. And they had, in -- in\nthose days they were building houses with old English brick, and those are the original\nbricks that were sent by ship from England, they were larger. And -- and the wrecking\nwas -- was very lucrative, because they were saving -- after wrecking it, they were\ncleaning the bricks, and they were reselling them, and they were a big -- it was important,\nit was a novelty, it was -- it was history. So they saved the brick, and people were able to\nmake lots of money. So then he was working -- of course, he was only supervising them,\nand how he knew about it, \u2019ll never know. He was supervising, and e-employing people,\nand paying them. He wasn\u2019t doing the original wrecking by himself. And this is how --\nand he did well. We did well, and we were thrifty. Oh yes, there\u2019s something else I would\nlike to speak about. When my children were born and of school age, I -- what\u2019s that?",
        "A: Yeah? It sounded like voices, scared me. Anyhow, when the children beco -- became\nof school age, since I was very well taken care of as a child and schooled properly -- i-in\nother words I went to a kin-kindergarten, a private, Jewish owned kindergarten, it\u2019s not\nthat a -- a Jewish was -- they did not have any other kin-kindergarten. So I had to go to a -\n- a Jewish kindergarten. It\u2019s not -- I would -- the reason I\u2019m trying to mention it to you, it\nwas not because it was Jewish or not Jewish. But then I was in school, and then -- and\nschools in Poland were divided, Jewish people, and non-Jewish. So, we went to school\nSunday, and the non-Jewish children went to their school on Saturday, so that was the\ndifferent. And also, when I finished sixth grade, and of course I could have gone to the\nseventh grade, but since fortunately I was a good student, and I -- I also studied with --\nwith help, so I was advanced, and I was able to go to high school. And the high school\nused to call in -- in European, we used to call you gimnasium. Which translates evidently\ngymnasium here, but -- but that\u2019s not what it was. Gimnasium was the higher education,\nlike high school. And so I went to a private high school, and of course I wasn\u2019t there long\nenough, cause the war started, and the Germans occupied our schools, and we were not\nable to be there any more, because my school was only girls school. So we were not able\nto be there, because young soldiers and everything. And there were horrible things that\nwere going on, they were raping, and everything. So we were -- we -- they closed the\nschool. So that was it, but s-schooling for my parents meant awful lot, education and so\non. And yeah, e -- speaking of education, my z -- my brother went to a school that was\nbasically Hebrew, but of course, Polish was learned, and just like if he went to a day\nschool where, you know. And so we were really very carefully taken care of, as far as\neducation is concerned. So naturally, when I became a mother, and my children started\ngoing to school, I felt like I -- I -- I was thinking the same way, and -- although schools\nwere different, and better, and -- in Charleston, schools were segregated, you know, so\nyou -- it\u2019s not that 1t was better or worse, but -- but they had good schools, so -- but I\ndidn\u2019t care about it. My sons went to a military school, like children\u2019s military, the -- you\nknow, the grade school. And they were wearing uniforms, and everything, just like -- like\nregular military, but children. And my daughter went to a -- a s-school, and it was\nfamous, it still is famous. It\u2019s called Ashleigh Hall, where it -- it was just for girls, and\nthere were a -- it was a boarding school too, if somebody needed it. So my -- my children\nwere very good ta-taking care of, and all of them, I\u2019m very proud of them.",
        "A: I had -- I had four sons.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Norman. Norman Joseph was my oldest son. Maurice Howard is my second son, he\nlives in Charleston now. Then I have Richard Ivan, and Stanley Paul, and well, my oldest\ndaughter is Blanche Dorothy, and my youngest daughter is Sherry Lisa Weintraub. They\nall -- actually, most of them lived here, except for my son now that 1s practicing dentistry\nin Charleston.",
        "A: Well, it actually took a long time, because people did not talk. And I had a -- actually,\nno intention to tell them, because it was too sad, and young children, I didn\u2019t want to\noccupy their minds with this. And -- and -- on the other hand yet too, I thought that it was\nbad that I was a priva -- prisoner, and that maybe I did something bad, and I did not want\nto -- to tell the children, cause they wouldn\u2019t understand, so I did not. And therefore, I did\nnot. But then, later on, I remember on a couple occasions, when I used to come to pick up\nmy daughter from school, her -- the principal came to me and -- and asked me if I could\nteach the children French. And I told her, I -- I don\u2019t speak French, I speak just a little bit,\nI have learned a little bit, but that is not enough to teach anybody. And I told her I could\nmaybe as -- instruct them in German, but they did not have German. But anyhow, the\npoint is that they -- that they couldn\u2019t make me out what I am, and who I am, and they did\nnot -- could not make a connection at that time, what was the Holocaust, and what the\nHolocaust did to us. You see, people were completely ig-ignorant. They knew the -- the\nwar was bad, but they -- I -- they did not know how -- how it reduced us to become\nprisoners, and not -- nobodies, comparing to what we were before, and so on. So that\u2019s\nthe way it was.",
        "A: Later on, when people started reading about it, and talking about it, and -- and writing\nabout it. They -- people would come to me, they ask me to -- to do a interview on\ntelevision, and I did several of them. Then they ask me to write some things. They didn\u2019t\n-- they ask me to do different things, and speak to -- to schools, and -- and educate young\nschoolchildren, and tell them ideas. And -- and I was able to do that, and I wanted to do\nit, not only that I was able. And I did my best, and I was pretty busy all the time, and I\nworked, too. I had my own business that I -- I was a clothes designer, and I opened up my\nown shop in a shopping center, and I had to support my children later on, when my\nhusband died, and he died in -- in \u201973, which 1s a long time ago. So I still was busy, I had\narticles in the newspaper, and they would interview me, and have me tell them stories,\nand this is how everything came to light. And later on -- in the small cities, actually\npeople were talking freely about it, better. Where in the big cities, like New York,\nChicago, pe -- people did not crawl out from the woodwork until much later. I don\u2019t\nknow why. Maybe because there were more people in the larger cities, where in our -- in\nCharleston, we had maybe five or six family of survivors. So that\u2019s the way it 1s, and now\nmy grandchildren know a lot about it, too. One of my granddaughters wrote a story about\nme, and they had a little combination of stories in a -- in a book, where in high school,\nthey had to each come out with a story, and -- and it was published in a book. And it was\npublished only if it was good, and they were giving -- given a grade for it. So my\ndaughter -- my granddaughter did that, and I was very proud of it, proud of the fact that\nshe was interested to know, and so on. And they still do, nowadays too, I have very\nyoung grandchildren still, that are interested in, and they make me come to their school,\nand -- and s -- talk to them. Of course, you have to have a very special approach for\nchildren once you are a mother yourself, then you are able to apply it in a way where they\nwill understand it, and it will not be so -- so drastic, and shocking to them. So that\u2019s the\nway I did it.",
        "A: Well, it was not because of military in a way, but -- but because it was a -- a private\nschool. That was the only private school in -- in Charleston. And of the fact that -- that 1-\nit was a good school, and the only -- they were disciplined in a way, but not that they\nneeded discipline, cause my children were -- were very well behave -- behaved, but they\ndid have some military little things that they were doing. Like, for example, they had a\nroll call in the morning before they entered classes, they stayed on attention when things\nwere happening, and they were dressed military. So it was -- it was like a boost to their\npersonality, cause they felt like they were somebodies. And -- and this is what I felt that\nshould be instilled upon them, because I, during the war, lost all this. You know, the\nimportance, and the -- the assurance, and -- and whatever. So -- and then it was a private\nschool that -- that I was in favor of, and therefore I did it.",
        "A: Oh, I am still patriotic. I still feel that way. I -- I felt to -- I\u2019m still getting choked up --\nI felt that way, and I feel that way all the time when it comes to -- to different things, like,\nfor example, if you see on television different things that we are doing, or this, like for\nexample, they send people now to -- to Turkey to a -- assist them in saving the people\nfrom the ra -- from the earthquake. I feel choked up, and I feel like crying, and I am very\nproud of it. And then, one day I was, for example, in a s-store, where the clerk was a\nyoung Jewish boy, a Russian. Well, I didn\u2019t know if he was Jewish, or not Jewish, or\nwhatever it is. And I said something, not connecting, or referring to -- to his English, and\n-- because it was obviously with a Russian accent, and I can detect it immediately. So it\nwas not the reason for that, but I said something, and he said to me, \u201cThis is America.\u201d\nYou know, like proudly, see, because they just escaped from the -- from Russia. There is\nlots of people here from Russia. And when I found out, I says, \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d\nHe says, \u201cWell, I\u2019m happy to be here.\u201d And he told me he\u2019s going to college already, and\nso on. And then, in the process of -- of t-talking, he told me he was Jewish, because we\nwere talking. I says, \u201cWell, how -- how are you able to be -- go to college already? Your\nEnglish is,\u201d -- and I didn\u2019t want to insult him, \u201cis good, but is it good enough for\ncollege?\u201d He says, \u201cYes. Besides,\u201d he says, \u201cI am Jewish, and Jewish people are smart.\u201d\nBecause -- you know, because whatever, I don\u2019t know, I was proud of what he said. It\u2019s\nnot that I necessarily feel that way. I\u2019m proud of myself, and I\u2019m proud of being Jewish,\nand proud of whatever it is you have to. So -- but this is the -- and it struck me. I says,\n\u201cMy God, isn\u2019t that wonderful?\u201d And -- and -- and I always feel that way about the\nUnited States, feel about it to the point where I -- where I can sit and cry because of the\nway I\u2019m being treated here, and because of wh -- of the way I was able to grow up he --\nhere, and -- and establish my life, and -- and feel good about it, it\u2019s very important.",
        "A: I am very upset with it, I\u2019m very upset with it. I -- as -- personally did not feel it, and\nif it was some -- somebody anti-Semitic that was in contact with me, or a -- they did not\nshow any evidence tha -- how he felt. But of cou -- of course I am very upset when they\nstill do it. But to be honest, unfortunately, not that it makes me feel better, we are not the\nonly group that -- that they are anti -- you know. There are a -- I see the same thing they\nfeel about Chinese people, about, still, African people, or still Indian people. Whatever it\nis, they -- they feel that way. So not that it -- I feel better being in a crowd, but I realize\nthat I\u2019m not the only one that is that way.

        "A: \u00b069. I -- I -- evidently some people that knew me from Vearshmeek, because\nincredibly enough, most of the people, all the 300 of -- other people that -- that were\nsaved by me -- I mean, I -- that was not my idea that -- that I developed, and realized that,\nbut the people were telling me that I saved them, because most of them live in New York,\nand -- and in Israel. When I came to Israel once for a visit, there was a gr-group of people\nthat was present when all this happened, and they invited me with a purpose. I didn\u2019t\nknow that, I just thought I was going to visit them, that -- you know, just to -- to\nremember them, because I was not a -- born in Vearshmeek, I was just a newcomer, but\nthey knew me enough from hearing about me, or little, you know, in touch with -- with\nme here, and there for a reason. So when I came to visit them, they surprised me to a\npoint where I really was sitting and crying for half an hour. Because they had the little get\ntogether, invited everybody who knew me, and when I came in, they s-screamed, \u201cOur\nhero 1s here.\u201d And then they made me believe that I was the one that was instrumental in\nsaving them. And then, when I started thinking about it, it really was so, because -- not\nthat I planned it that way, because I didn\u2019t plan it that way.

So he didn\u2019t want anybody, and besides it, the\nGermans themself were angry when the people f -- the Ukraine people did things without\ntheir specific instruction.

And\nwhen they found somebody that was guilty of crimes against the Jewish people, they --\nthey made a trial, okay? The Germans thems -- themselves wanted to.

And, of course, we came -- the\nGerman government actually paid for the trip, because I would have never spent money\nke -- I didn\u2019t have it. And I would have not done it to see that the -- the Germans that --\nthat did such horrible atrocities -- I was scared. The first time we finally arrived in\nHamburg, and we were stepping down, I -- I felt like I was absolutely going to have a\nheart attack to -- to -- to put my feet on the German soil, to feel -- you know, that they did\nall this and so on. It was a terrible experience, I -- I didn\u2019t want to, but I -- I had to. And I\nthink my husband was with me at that time, too, because I didn\u2019t want to go by myself.\nSo it -- it was aw-awful experience.",
        "A: He was there, yes, he was there. And he remembered, because I told him that he shot\nme, which he did, and he intended to shoot everybody else, which he did. And then he\ntold -- told that I jumped him, which was true, and I didn\u2019t object to it any more, because\nit was true. He was there, but they -- the -- he was coming --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: -- this was true, he was there, but they -- the -- he was coming to the trial every day\nwith a suitcase, and documents and everything, like a big businessman. He was not in\njail. He was coming on his own, and they didn\u2019t do anything to him, because he was\njailed in Russia, right after the war, I think. Either he remained in Russia where they --\nwhen -- when they were in Russia, you know, trying to -- to beat the Russians, or he\nactually escaped Germany, and -- and Poland, because of the fact that he was doing all\nthese awful things, and -- and he went to Russia, or maybe there were -- he did some\nthings for the -- to the -- against the Russian people, and that\u2019s why they got him in --\njailed in Russia. So, because of the fact that he was in -- in jail for two years, or\nsomething like that, they didn\u2019t want -- they didn\u2019t do anything to him. In other words,\nthe fact that he killed so many people just didn\u2019t meke -- make any difference.",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "A: It was terrible, it was disgusting, cause he was dressed beautiful, he was acting like he\nwas a important person. He had his special booth where he was sitting down nec -- nec --\non both sides of him here was a translator, whatever it was, Polish, or -- or whoever was,\nfrom another country. And he sat like a very important person over there. And that\nreminds me, I don\u2019t know if you were aware, that was the trial of Demjanjuk. Have you\nheard of him, that they took to -- to Israel --",
        "A: -- and tried him, because he was the -- the guy that was in a concentration camp, and\nkilling Jews. You her -- you heard of that.",
        "A: I was -- I happened to be at the same time in Israel, and I took my -- my special --\nspecial trip to go to Jerusalem to be -- to attend the trial, and I did. And the way -- he was\n-- he learned a little bit of Hebrew, he came -- when he came out to his special area where\nhe was supposed to sit, you know, to his special booth, he came, and he said shalom to\neverybody in Hebrew, and he -- and he also was saying [indecipherable] all kind of\npapers, and documents. And he was answering questions; there were a number of Israel\nHolocaust survivors that were witnesses, and were with him, and -- and talked -- spoke\nagainst him. Didn\u2019t bother him at all. They s -- [phone ringing] Is that my phone?",
        "A: -- not to -- to the ones that -- that knew them, because I didn\u2019t want to brag, but just\nbecause you don\u2019t know it, am -- I\u2019m saying it.",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "A: Okay, okay. Well he was not -- he was not given any sentence any more, because that\nhe already, you -- you know, was doing time. And that\u2019s all, I don\u2019t know what happened\nto him later. I -- I had no control over it, and all the people that spoke against him, he --\nwe just didn\u2019t have any control. The fact that they did the trial, and went through the -- to\nthe problems of getting people from -- because there were people from Canada, there\nwere people from Australia, there were people from all over, because after the war, all the\nsurvivors kind of scattered everywhere. They had n -- knew somebody, that\u2019s where they\nwent. Maybe I would have gone to Israel, maybe I would have gone anywhere else, but\nwhy -- why go anywhere else when I had relatives here? My aunt -- my mother\u2019s sister\nlived in Charleston, and all my -- her brothers and sisters lived in -- the rest of them in\nToronto. So that was the reason, and my husband\u2019s brother lives in Chicago, so -- but it\nwas no choice.",
        "A: The other one, you know, he was -- first of all, he became prominent after the war, he\nwa -- became prominent, he was a mayor of -- of a city. I don\u2019t know -- I don\u2019t remember\nwhich one. And he became prominent, you know, and evidently his past was either\nhidden, or unknown, or whatever it is, and so I don\u2019t know what they did to him. I think\nthey jailed him for some time, because he -- he had obviously killed many, many more\npeople, and there were many witnesses. So that\u2019s why they -- they didn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t\nexecute him, they didn\u2019t kill him like they did Eichmann and the other ones.",
        "A: Yes, Becker. B-e-c-k-e-r. Yeah. Of course, I remember, I\u20191l remember it til the day I\ndie. I just hope I don\u2019t lose my mind before then, I\u2019m so scared of Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\nyou know, for some reason, I really do -- you notice that I ha -- I was forgetting certain\nwords or names.",
        "A: Yeah, mm.",

        "A: William Shrot was the other one.",
        "A: Yeah. And it\u2019s spelled S-h-r-o-t-h or t, only t, Shrot. So an -- it was wil -- Wilhelm,\nthe way he pronounced it.",
        "A: How do you know that?",
        "A: I did? Oh, that was a -- I was already in -- oh, that was a be -- right after the war, okay,\nyes. When I came to Poland, because I -- a few years ago I was in Poland, too.",
        "A: Really, I -- you don\u2019t have any mention of it here. The Poland was when I came from\nSweden to Poland. Okay, th-this -- yo -- which one you want me to tell you?",
        "A: Oh yes, maybe you\u2019re right. That -- that wa -- ya -- then I did mention it, because that\n-- that was after my son died. And I went -- in \u201988, okay, I went in \u201988 to Poland, to\ndifferent cities, and I was in Sweden also, I made a sentimental journey to Sweden, and --\nand yeah, whatever else.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: To -- the first time? From right after the war?",
        "A: In \u201988. I was with friends, and I was already well rooted, and well established, and\nfeeling -- feeling American, that -- and I came, and I have seen what I have seen. I -- I did\nnot feel sentimental about the Polish people, because they were denouncing us, and they\nwere destroying us, and they were stealing and taking from us all the time. There was a\nnumber of Poles that were assisting Jewish people and helping them, there\u2019s no doubt\nabout it. But the greater majority was actually waiting to take it away. G -- I'll tell youa\nlittle s -- something that will indicate how it was. After the war, people were -- late --\nlater after the war, many people would travel to Poland to seek their roots, and find out --\nwell, there are some people from Israel that went there, and they went to a -- a -- a city\nwhere their parents used to live, grandparents and so on. And of course, they didn\u2019t find\nanybody over there, because they were all gone, and there was a little cemetery where\nthey could maybe identify with, or a remnant of a synagogue or so on. But they were\ntalking with people living in -- in very nice houses, they belong to Jews. Not that it -- the\nJews were privileged and had those houses, but jewis -- Jewish people were working\nhard, and they were a -- a -- improving their lives, and their existence, and everything,\nand they were very particular about it, so they had better houses, and better places to live\nin, they lived better. So they were asking this particular family or person that lived in this\nhouse, oh, you have a nice house. So they were telling them yes, the Jews had it, now we\ngot it. So the person they wanted was interviewed, and I was asking him how and what\nand whatever it is, and they were telling them -- which was very, very degrading for -- for\nme to listen, how they were talking about the Jewish people that were killed, murdered,\nor whatever it 1s, and left the house for them, they felt lucky that they had everything, all\ntheir belongings, and everything. Now, for example, they -- there was also a incident\nwhere they were interviewing children in schools. You want a pillow for your back?",
        "A: That would be nice interview, hi -- I don\u2019t really -- I -- I don\u2019t even care any more.\nAnyhow, so when they ask children, five year old children, six year old children, do you\nknow what a Jew is? No. You know how they look. So one kid says, \u201cOh yes, I know,\nthey have big ears, and big noses, and they got big teeth, and they are scary.\u201d This is how\nchildren were able to describe Jewish people, and it\u2019s not li-like that. Of course, in\nEurope, Jewish children, I -- I mean Jewish people were branded having big noses Here,\nyou got everybody, Arabs, the -- the Greeks, the -- there -- whatever it is, everybody\u2019s got\nbig noses, and it was not especially a trait of Jewish people. So, that\u2019s how they described\nthe Jewish people over there. And it was upsetting.",
        "A: Y -- y -- to my summer home? Yes. It was not my own, it was where we rented. Yes,\nwe went there. There was one lady in Lodz that took me -- her husband was driving, and -\n- course I was able to pi -- pay them, and I brought things for them, because how I found\nout about the person is also a whole, big story. But purely by accident, I was writing by\nthe name to the person, and the -- the letter was received by these people of the same\nname, and whatever it is. And they were not Jewish. I was writing to a Jewish friend that\nwas supposed to live in -- in Lodz, and they received it, and as I started writing to them, I\nfelt obligated to -- so I was writing, I was always putting money in the -- in the letter,\nbecause th -- she sounded kind, and nice, and whatever it is, and I knew that they were in\n-- lived poorly. So then when I came to Lodz, I got in touch with -- with her, and of\ncourse I stayed in a hotel, I didn\u2019t need anything from them, but they did offer to take me\nwhere I wanted to go by car. And since it was like about I would say two hours away\nfrom L\u00e9dz, they took me over there. And of course, I was -- 1t was on a [indecipherable].\nSo, I cannot even describe how I felt. I -- I felt like -- like -- like I could touch everything,\nand -- and it would be the same, and every -- course, the area -- this was where we used\nto come for vacation, and father used to come. That -- they took me to the train station,\nand I remember coming and waiting for Daddy to come from L6dz, because Daddy used\nto come for the weekend, you know, like Friday, and then leaving Monday morning, and\nyou know, everything was just -- just like I could touch it. So I lingered quite a little\nwhile over there, and she doesn\u2019t know -- she didn\u2019t know what I was looking at. And I\nwas looking, and I was touching, and I was doing things and -- that\u2019s all you can do, there\nis NO way you can possibly recover anything that you have lost, that\u2019s all. So it was a very\n-- a very touching and emotional moment. And of course, it did not look the same\nbecause they have rebuilt the areas, it\u2019s -- so I did not find the house where I was living,\nbut the train station looked somewhat similar to what -- what I remember. And then when\nwe want -- went to the area, they had it redone, rebuilt, and streets, and everything, I --\nbasically I didn\u2019t recognize it. But it was a incredible time. And then, of course, the way -\n- in Poland, you wouldn\u2019t believe it. Like, for example, I w --",
        "A: I -- I looked at streets, you know, the main streets where there was lots of business,\nwhere they had lots of stores, and I know fortunately, or unfortunate, or some wartby\nwhatever it 1s, those buildings and -- and houses, and -- and businesses belonged to\nJewish people. So they had signs, for example, dressmaking, or this, hanging on the\nentrance of the -- of the air -- you know, the -- the areas in Europe had, like for example,\nthis was a big courtyard, and the houses were bi -- th -- were around, and there was a gate\nhere, where you entered, cause that\u2019s how most of the houses were, with a -- a -- cl --\nenclosed in courtyard for everybody. So, like on -- at the entrance of the -- of the\ncourtyard, they had different signs saying who 1s doing business of any kind, like for\nexample shoemaker, this and that, whatever. And then, in the front of the street, they had\nstores, and the stores were saying, like here, whatever the store was selling, whatever it\nis. So they still had the same size and everything there, all -- and of course now,\nrestaurants, they still had the Jewish restaurants with the same sign. Like, for example, a\nJewish delicacy is, like for example, have you ever heard of gefilte fish?",
        "A: Did you really?",
        "A: Huh. Well, okay. I-It w -- Jewish people eat it -- not -- they can eat it any time they\nwant to, but it was a custom that for Saturday -- Friday and Saturday, you made it,\nbecause we did not have refrigerations and so on, and it was -- we were able to keep it in\na cold place for a couple days to eat, because we were not allowed to -- to cook, or do\nanything. So we ate that, and we still do, so it\u2019s a very popular dish for Jews. So anyhow,\nwhat made me laugh is I saw a restaurant, and it says, of course in Polish, \u201cWe serve\nJewish gefilte fish.\u201d Now, that was in Polish, but I\u2019m translating it. And I said, \u201cMy God,\nthey didn\u2019t even know how to make it.\u201d You know, if they were not specifically\ninstructed to do it. And they had businesses, and Jewish people go there. And they -- they\n-- | went there too, cause I -- I had no way -- no other way to -- to go to eat. I wasn\u2019t very\nfond of -- of them, and bec -- I was hurt. I still had the feeling of -- of the way they\ntreated us, still had the taste of it. So I could not warm up in such a short time toward\nthem. Of course, now, it\u2019s a different generation, and it\u2019s different, so I feel differently\nabout it. I feel different, I -- differently about the Germans, okay? Because first of all, the\nGerman society is mixed, also, of different groups, of ethnic groups, in different\ncountries, and different thing. If Hitler we -- were to be alive, and if he saw his -- his\ncities in Germany, he most probably would commit suicide becau -- because he wa --\nwanted -- he was striving to destroy everybody that did not belong in Germany, and he\nwanted a clean Germany, only of typical, ethnic Germans, and no mixtures whatsoever.\nAnd like I said, I said oh my God, here I came to -- to Frankfurt, to the airport, and they\nhad groups of Indians from India, okay? Groups of people from different, other countries,\nfrom the Middle East, from here, from that, and then in the streets you saw Chinese\npeople, Chinese restaurants and everything, and I looked, and I said, \u201cMy God, it feels\nlike I\u2019m in the States.\u201d And then I said t -- the same thing that I told you about Hitler, I\nsaid, \u201cIf Hitler saw this, he would drop dead immediately,\u201d you know. So -- so I don\u2019t\nfeel -- I cannot say -- I -- I -- I feel something, but I would not say that I feel about every\nGerman the same way, because it\u2019s a different generation. And the time when I went to\nGermany -- Germany, if I saw somebody that was my age then, I would know that he was\nsomebody in the German army, somebody that oppressed the Jewish people, and -- and\nwhatever it is, so I would feel very badly. But now it\u2019s entirely a different -- different ge-\ngeneration, but of course, you still have the anti-Jewish, you know, anti-Semitic groups\nand so on. Like for example, the group here that was supposed to -- you know -- you\nknow, go around -- what do you call it? They -- an-anti-Nazi -- anti-Jews -- Jewish group\nthat was supposed to be here last -- last week.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, whatever ot -- I thought they were just strictly anti -- Nazis. On a -- they\nare a -- a combination of Ku Klux Klan, and whatever, okay. And, you know what\nsurprises me? That they came, and they asked for a permit, and the government gave\nthem a permit. Now how could it be? Knowing that these are that kind of people, and\nwho -- why doesn\u2019t somebody that belongs here, really, and is -- is a true American, a --\nno matter what religion, whatever it is, do things like that to -- to a -- you know, not\ndemonstrate, but to -- to -- to just announce that they are here, that we are here, we are --\nand we are Americans, although we are from there, and from where, whatever it is. But\nwhy allow them to -- to demonstrate, like they demonstrated already, twice in Chicago, in\nSkokie, I know. I mean -- and there were fights, and there were disturbances. Why -- why\ninvite something like that? That\u2019s what surprises me, that we are too lenient here, and too\n-- too much allowing. It shouldn\u2019t be like that, there should be a strict -- I -- I don\u2019t want\nto put ideas in anybody\u2019s head, but there should be c-certain raw -- laws to make sure that\nthings like that are not going to happen.",
        "A: Definitely, definitely. Al -- the -- any -- any ethnic group, and any group could march,\nfine, but not to be idealistic about something aga -- which is going to -- to be against our -\n- our American society. Why should they be allowed to -- to be like that, for them to\nspeak against somebody? If they are not Americans, let them get the hell out of there,\nthat\u2019s all. Forgive me for saying [indecipherable]",
        "A: It was frightening to me --",
        "A: -- but I -- I almost wish, after I heard what was going on, I almost wish that they --\nthat they were there to demonstrate, because they had several different groups, large\ngroups. You know, Jews are not supposed to actually demonstrate or do anything public\non the Sabbath, and that was on Saturday. And they organized a group -- a Jewish group\nresistance, I don\u2019t know in what ways. I don\u2019t think th-they had arms, or anything, but --\nbut it was a -- a -- a contra -- a acting group, and different other groups, you know, that\nthey -- but there were lots of blacks because the Ku Kluck-ux Klan is against the blacks,\nand -- and this and that. So there were several large groups that were -- would overcome,\nno matter how -- and they said they were going to have 300 people only, and four only\nshowed up, right? Flor -- four of the Ku Klux Klan showed up, and then they dispersed.\nSo I don\u2019t know. But -- so if -- 1f they would have a -- a awful come down to reality, you\nknow, or because they would realize that there\u2019s no place for anything like that to\nhappen, there\u2019s no place for them to de -- demonstrate, and they -- you know. But I don\u2019t\nknow. Listen, as long as -- as people exist, there is always somebody that will come up\nwith something somewhere.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes. You see, I did speak about it. Yes. I found -- not photograph. Th-The reason\nI was looking for photographs, okay, when they were taking us to -- in Auschwitz, where\nthey were taking us to -- to the shower, I mentioned to you that I only had photographs\nand things with me. They took those away from us. Not that they personally came to me\nand took it away, but I had to leave it. So I had -- I was hoping that they would have the\nphotographs in Auschwitz. And they have set up a whole place, you know, like a whole\noffice in one of the barracks where, you know, where they were keeping the photographs,\nbecause they had a tremendous amount of photographs, because everybody was taking\nphotographs to the -- to -- to the -- to the camp with them. That -- that was the only thing\nthat was important for us. So, they found a awful lot of photographs, millions of them,\nmost probably, from people that were brought into Auschwitz. And so they kept it, they\nput them all in one barrack, or two barracks, and then they -- they segregated the\nphotographs, and placed them if they could into all cities, if 1t was evidence that it was\nfrom this, or another city. And that\u2019s where I went. I found my name, Blass, in several\nother cities. I found -- but I did not find any photographs that I could un -- I -- read,\nunless they were photographs, but you see, I was a very young gi -- I was still a teenager\nwhen the war broke out. So I couldn\u2019t know that much, and remember. I remembered\nonly that hit me -- that hit close to home, and so on. And people that I remember were\nonly sort of relatives, and maybe some friends from school, and so on. So, I did not know\nvery much, but when I saw a name, I could tell. I went to the cemetery -- cemetery in\nWarsaw, also, at the trip when I was -- that was when I was in Poland, and I made sure th\n-- and I -- I looked, and I found many names, Weintraub, and I found names Blass, but I\ndo not -- I -- I do not remember of any relative. Course, Weintraub was not my family, it\nwas my husband\u2019s family, so he most probably would have been able to distinguish\nbetter, but I was not able.",
        "A: No, no. I was very disappointed. The photographs that I brought in there, I would have\nfound, maybe, if they still were, but maybe I wasn\u2019t looking in the -- in the right place,\nbecause like I told you, each barrack had upstairs, and downstairs. The first barracks,\nactually, they were made out of brick, and concrete. Later on, the other barracks were\nmade out of wood. But those, for some reason, I don\u2019t know what they were planning to\ndo with it, or those were little brick houses. So, evidently, they planned to have the\nphotographs in there, because they put them right away. But maybe they didn\u2019t -- you\nknow, when you have photographs from people that were from different areas, and put in\none camp, and how -- you cannot tell which city, whatever it is. So maybe they were not\nput on -- put away in perspective that I could find them. So, I didn\u2019t find anything.",
        "A: Emotionally, everything was terrible, terrible. This was not the same emotion as -- as I\nfelt being in -- in this small village where I used to spend my vacation time. This was an\nentirely different emotion. That was a good feeling, everything was good, like -- like\ntouching things that -- that I touched before, or somebody else, my parents, and my\nfriends, and whatever touched. This was a bad feeling, of -- of what they did, and it just --\neverything I looked at was -- was taken by force, and whatever, so it was a very horrible\nfeeling.",
        "A: No, healing -- there\u2019Il be never healing, in my opinion. I never will be healed of it. I\njust get accustomed to it, that\u2019s all. I ust get a -- to the point where I can talk about it,\nwhere if you got me here at -- 10 or 15 years ago, I wouldn\u2019t be able to sit like that and\ntalk to you, but now I -- I want really -- and you can notice it most probably -- I want to\nget as much as I can out, you know, to talk about it.

        "A: That -- that -- that is not -- this 1s not from -- from the concentration camp. I had a lock\nof hair that I took with me, and -- when I took the shoes and everything. Then when I\ncame to -- to this country, I was able to put the hair in a locket. I was not --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I -- I would be rich, I would be able to -- to buy a piece of bread for it, if I had gold in\nthere. No, we had nothing.",
        "A: Yes. I still have a whole bunch put away, because this 1s destroyed almost, cause I\ndon\u2019t even take it off. I use it in the shower, and whatever it -- I Just be -- don\u2019t take off\nthis. And here, my -- the hair is already a little clamped up, but you know, I would never\nthrow it away, because in Jewish religion, you\u2019re not supposed to throw away anything\nthat was on a body -- n-not a foreign thing, but something that belonged to the body, it\nwas growing on the body. You are not supposed to throw it away, you bury it. Like, for\nexample they do in -- in a hospital when they have -- make autopsies, and everything like\nthat, so they -- they put everything in -- in one bag, what\u2019s left over, and they bury it,\ncause at least they have proper burial. So, I -- I couldn\u2019t destroy it and throw it away.",
        "A: Definitely. You know, there was one song that they were singing, they were\noccupying Jewish musicians, you know they had a -- a tremendous amount of talent in\nconcentration camp. People -- singers, and musicians, and you name it. And at that time, I\nalready -- are you familiar with -- with the song, \u201cBeer Barrel Polka?\u201d Yes, da dan dan,\nda dan dan da da ha a -- [ -- | am not a singer. But anyhow, it was very famous at that\ntime, and evidently either it came from the States, and they adopted it over there, or vice-\na versa. It was \u201cBeer Ba-Barrel Polka,\u201d and it was a very known -- you know, song,\nmusic. And it was happy music, you know, jolly, just like having to do -- beer, you know,\nlike -- like it was bursting with happiness. Well, this song, they were -- so they had a\nJewish band, they supplied them with to -- instruments, and they had no difficulty\nsupplying wa -- with instruments, because when somebody was playing a instrument, that\nwas one of the most important things that they had, so they took it to concentration camp\nwith them. So they had plenty of instruments, so they were supplying the -- the orchestra\nwith instruments, they had violins and -- and everything, you know. And they made them\nplay this song when they were taking the -- the people to -- to the ovens, and wherever\nthey were going, whatever they were doing, whatever atrocities were -- were happening\nat the time, they always played that song. And that made me sick, ter -- it still does, you\nknow. When I came here later -- a few years later, there was a show on television, I don\u2019t\nremember exactly who it was that used to -- th-they were advertising that whoever have -\n- has a favorite song, or savorite -- favorite story, not song, to write it, and to -- that was a\ncontest for -- for some reason. And I wrote -- I still have it, actually, but I would have to\ndig, I don\u2019t know, hundred days to dig it out, everything. Is -- I wrote a -- a letter to this\ncompany that was soliciting for stories, you know, and to d -- it was like something to tell\nthem what -- what was the most important thing that influenced the life, or whatever it 1s,\nI don\u2019t know, with -- with a connection of a product that they were selling. Anyhow, I\nwrote a story about the song, and I -- and I told what 1t was connected with and\neverything, so they accepted it, but they didn\u2019t want to print it. They did not want to print\nit that I was the winner of a -- of a story like that, because it would be a -- too negative\nfor other ethnic groups, n-namely Germans, or whatever it is, and after all, there is a great\npopulation of German people here in America. And they did not do it.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. I have terrible dreams, and I wake up pe-perspired, and -- and anxious,\nand -- and hurt, and for a while I am so disoriented that I don\u2019t know where I am, until I\nfinally slowly but surely realize. Yes, that\u2019s unfortunate, but I do that.",
        "A: What? Oh, s -- yeah. I have seen things 1n this small town where I was. They were\npunishing people for doing certain things, for this and that, like for example, I thought\nthat\u2019s a sil -- sa -- simple way -- comparison. Like they will pan -- punish you because\nyou are using too much water, or watering the lawn. But in -- in Germany they had all\nkind of punishments, too. Non-Jewish people, and Jewish people. As it happened, some\nnon-Jewish people did something, and it was five or six people, and they hung them on\nthe market, the same market ba -- that I was telling you, where -- where they, during the\nevacuation that they put us on. And we -- and the Jewish people were ordered to come,\nand -- and -- and watch it. They were forced to watch it. So here 1s a -- you know, a --\nthey built a special -- what -- what do you call it, scaffold? Okay, where they -- and they\nhung the people, and we had to wait until they turned blue, you know, from the pressure\nof the blood, or whatever it is. And we watched it, it was the most horrible thing you\never, ever saw. Young people -- there was older people, and s -- a couple young people,\nright in front of us. And they pulled the thing, and that\u2019s what it was. So, of course, I have\nseen later on, in different forms, not exactly hanging. I saw shooting, and this and that.\nWhen they took us to this camp in Vearshmeek, you know, and when they took us from\nthe marketplace into the camp, they put men separately and women separately, and then\nthey were searching us, because they knew that we had valuables, money, because we did\nnot come -- of course, ourselves, we didn\u2019t have much, but people that came st -- still\nstraight from their home had things, so they -- and they told people -- us ahead, if they\nfind any money, if they find any jewelry, we\u2019ll be shot. And sure enough, they searched\nus, and they found somebody had some money, which didn\u2019t mean anything, you know,\npaper money. And they found some jewelry, maybe a -- a wedding ring, or this or that,\nand they shot the people in front of me. We were -- we were standing there, a woman\nhere, and a woman here, and they shot them right here.",
        "A: Yes. About shooting, about killing, about -- terrible. Yeah, of course, it\u2019s -- I -- I\ndream about things that I never even -- that I have never even seen, that -- that after I\nrealized what I am dreaming about, what it\u2019s -- it\u2019s supposed to tell me, that it is\nassociated with the Holocaust. So I -- you know, I\u2019m aware of it.",
        "A: Yes, I do. Not many, not here, but I had those, you know, out of the seven -- seven or\ns -- eight families over there they were survivors. But then I have friends 1n other cities\nand countries. Like I told you, friends in Israel, of course, little by little, they are dying\nbecause they were not young, I was one of the youngest ones, so they are all either my\nage, or a little older. So they are not able to survive. How much longer can you survive?\nAnd in New York and Chicago, and -- yeah, I had all over, wherever I came, I w -- used\nto visit my family in Chicago, and I used to meet survivors, and -- and I\u2019m\ncorresponding, and I had fr -- friend survivors in -- in Toronto, Canada, and so on, yeah.\nBut the only ones that I was able to get in touch with constantly, or -- were the ones in\nCharleston, but since I live here, it\u2019s -- I am not seeking them for some reason, because I\ndon\u2019t know them, and just to -- to seek them out for -- for the purpose of talking about it,\nit\u2019s no sense.",
        "A: To Auschwitz --",
        "A: To Rockfeld, yes.",
        "A: Why I came, because of my children, because of all -- most of my children lived here,\nand that\u2019s why -- actually, all my remaining children lived here, except for my -- all the\nson that s-stayed behind in Charleston, he didn\u2019t want to move. A-And the rest lived here.\nAnd the one that lives in Charleston, he was not well, he had diabetes. So he was not able\n-- it\u2019s not like -- anyhow, the children that -- that live here, wanted me to come. My\noldest daughter insisted I come here, my other children. That\u2019s why I came. And I\u2019m still\nsorry, because it was like being uprooted. That\u2019s --",
        "A: Yes. I just came back from Charleston. I told you, remember, I wa -- we were\nsupposed to have the meeting in June, and I went away. You remember, you originally\nmade a date with me in June, and you were not able to keep it, and I told you I was going\nto be out of town.",
        "A: Everything. Everything. There is nothing that I didn\u2019t have in Charleston that I have\nhere, and -- but I had more in Charleston than I have here, so -- I know -- I -- I miss my\nfriends, I miss everything. Knowing Charleston, and going places. Life was completely\neasier. Yeah, a small town life is con -- really very different from a big town here. Over\nthere, wherever I wanted to go, I had no problem with parking, I didn\u2019t have to work\nstreets -- walk streets to find a parking place, and then go back, and -- and so on.\nEverything was accessible, and ka -- it was entirely different life. It was somewhat still to\n-- to the way it used to be for me in -- in Europe, except that, like I said, we didn\u2019t have\ncars, and that was probably in whole city of -- of Lodz, there -- there were maybe 25 cars,\nand not always I would see them on the street that I was walking. And so 1 --",
        "A: From my work, I retired in -- in \u201962.",
        "A: No, no wait a second, no, it wasn\u2019t \u201962. Sic -- I retired the year I came h -- yeah, which",
        "A: No, no, no, I came here 12 years ago, okay, what year was it? 80 -- \u00b085. Okay, in \u201985, I\nretired \u201985. I -- I just closed up my store, that was my retirement, and that\u2019s all -- and\ndecided that I didn\u2019t want to work any more.",
        "A: Design. I was designing clothes. We -- I was making, of course, and my staff, we were\nmaking -- like, for example, clothes for a whole party, let\u2019s say a wedding party,\nbridesmaid\u2019s dresses, and some wedding gowns, to a certain extent. And other things, and\nwhatever.",
        "A: 25 years over there. 20 -- 25 years I worked in there. Of course, I wasn\u2019t -- I wasn\u2019t\ndoing a tremendous business, because when you work with your hands, you cannot\naccomplish very much, you know? But, I also -- de -- could not -- I could work full time,\nbecause I had children, and I had to attend to them, and make sure that they were all right\nbefore I was able to sit there. So, like -- I made a living, you know, like th -- ends -- end\nto end, and -- and whatever. But 1-it was satisfying because it was something I liked to\ndo, and -- and I did it, and -- and also the fact that people were grateful, because whatever\nI did for them, they were gratef -- grateful, and -- and praised me and so on. And that was\na boost. So --",
        "A: Gusta Blass designing, alterations and so on. Was -- I have pictures of it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Please don\u2019t forget sending me the tape, okay? I would like that, cause I -- I want this\nto be some evidence for my children, and information, because I know that sooner or\nlater, they will decide to put the story together and -- and -- and do something.",
        "A: It\u2019s important for me, and it\u2019s important for them, too. An-And I know that, but how\ncan they do it if all -- they will not have information and so on.
