You know,\nthey used to come in and they used to be like...people...Polish people, you know, farmers\nused to come up and bring in all kind of food. Selling...potatoes, like.

And they used to come, like I said before, they used to come to the city to buy,\nyou know, food...more delicate things, you know. And than that was it. And the rest they\nwould...they used to come in by horse and wagon, of course, because it was 12 kilometers to\ncome to that city. And all around the things. But it wasn't too many Jewish people. You\ncould count them on the fingers.",
        "Q: Do you remember the day that the war started in Vengrov?",
        "A: I don't remember the date of the day. What I remember, it was...when they came in to\nVengrov, it was just before Rosh Hashanah. I think, if I'm not mistaken, it was like a week\nbefore Rosh Hashanah they came in. And it took them not too long to start taking out the\nJews. Yom Kippur they...they...how to say? They took us around...they took us around, all\naround. And we were all in shul,\u201d this I remember distinctly. We were all in shul, my whole\nfamily. And of course the other people were there. And one of my brother came in and\nannounced...it was in a different room ...and he announced that people we already in it. That\nmeans we were closed around, we couldn't go out. That was it. They came in and they taken\nus and we gonna get killed. And that what it is. That was Yom Kippur, about two o'clock.\nWait a minute. About two o'clock, yeah. Just when we took a rest, you know, from, from\npraying. And of course, people got very nervous. And they didn't know what to do. Should\nwe stay yet in the shul or should we start going into the places to hide or...they didn't know\nwhat... what we, can we do? Because we were already in their hands. We couldn't go\nnowhere. The whole city was like you take a, a wire and you put it around that they can't\nescape. Anyway, we wait...we finish there until the last prayer. And we went home. We went\n\u00b0 synagogue, house of prayer and gathering (Hebrew)\nhome by rushing home. A lot of people got hurt, because they didn't let us go. They didn't\n..don't go here, and don't go there. And you weren't allowed to have lights. Was no lights.\nWe didn't know where to go. And we went into the houses. Of course, the dinner was...no\ndinner, you could imagine. But we were sitting and praying and talking between the family,\nyou know. And we were talking, how can we get all together to be in one place and to\nkeep...keep together. But I took my mother. My father wasn't alive already. My father was\ndead already. Because of them. They killed him. It happened that one day...",
        "Q: How did they kill him?",
        "A: Can I say it in between?",
        "Q: You can say it right now.",
        "A: He went about a week before Rosh Hashanah...he went to shul. He had a habit early in the\nmorning to go there for prayer. And it was not easy. It was far away from us. From where we\nwere living. It was early in the morning...in those times, then when they came in right\naway...that you weren't allowed to be in the evening in the street. And you weren't allowed to\nbe the early in the morning in the street. They had certain hours. You probably know about\nit. And they caught him coming back already. It must have been about 7, 7:30. Because it\nwas after the morning prayer. And they beat him up. But they wanted to cut his beard. He\nhad a beautiful beard like you see in the, in the picture. And he didn't let himself. So that's\nwhen they told me...I was the only one that was with them, because the rest of the people\nwere in Vengrov. There in the thing. That was in Vengrov. So he didn't let cut him the beard.\nSo they threw him down on the floor and they beat him up terribly.",
        "Q: You were there?",
        "A: I, I wasn't there.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: But my brothers went...they told my brothers that your father has been beaten up. Mendel\n(ph) and Moishe (ph) and the rest of the brothers, they were alive yet. Because they only\ncame in a couple weeks before. And my older brother went and he took him home. And he\ngot sick since then. He was very sick for a long time. And then he died.",
        "A: All right. So we were talking about, on Yom Kippur, how you were talking with the family\nand trying to figure out what to do.",
        "A: What to do. Where to go, where to hide. So everybody went in a different place to hide. Of\ncourse, my father wasn't alive already. We buried him. And only my mother. So I had to\nwatch after my mother. She was an elderly woman and she didn't...she couldn't take care on\nherself. And she couldn't walk too good. So I took her with me where I was hiding. In the\nsame building where we were living. We went on the roof. On the attic...not on the roof. On\nthe attic there, there was a place. They called it the boidem\u00ae or whatever you.... And there\nwas a lot of boxes and clothing ...what people throw out, you know, to give away.\nSo I, I, took her to one box and I covered her up with the certain clothes. And I went in\nanother place like...not far from her. Not to be together...one for us to be alive. And we\nsurvived, a couple days there on the roof. We took with us the...whatever was to eat in the\nhouse. What we had from before, prepared. And we had there...while we were sitting on the\nattic there. Finally, they, they stopped going for the Jews to take them there...to take them in\none place. So we went out...and I was remaining 1n the, in the apartment where I used to live.\nIt was on the top of our apartment. On the attic. But my mother said that...\"I want to go to\nSchlomo (ph)\"...that was the oldest son. The oldest brother. He's in the picture. \"I want to go\nup to him.\" And it was very far to go to him. It was to the...about 10 blocks to go over or\nmaybe more. Just approximately. But she went. She went and they killed her there on the\nplace. They caught her there, in the alley. It was alleys to go into the buildings. So they\ncaught her and they killed her there. We didn't know the funeral. We didn't know nothing.\nWe didn't know it. We only know that they took her to the cemetery. But where in the\ncemetery, what, we didn't know. There's no cemetery anyway there, anymore. And that was\nthe living after this.",
        "Q: So were you alone?",
        "A: I was only alone, left over, yeah.",
        "Q: And what did you do next? Where did you go?",
        "A: They were still there and they start...then it came the time that they took out the people to\nkill. To go to Treblinka.",
        "Q: All at one time or were there regular...",
        "A: It was regular living but it was no living, you know. During the war, it was no living. It was,\nit was torture. We went from one place to the other. Also...while I'm talking I'm reminding\nmyself...when the bombs start to come in, we went into a neighborhood not far from that\nfarm where we used to live before the war. We knew some people. And they took us in. And\nwe were there...sorry... They took us in for a couple days. They put us in the basement\n\u00b0 attic (Yiddish)\nbecause the soldiers were only more in the cities, in the bigger cities. Not so much on the\nfarm and those neighborhoods. We were there a couple days.",
        "Q: Who's \"we'\"?",
        "A: Some other people, Jews. They were living there in that, on that farm. And it was maybe\nabout five or six families, that's all. Not too many. So when we came back...when we came\nback to the city, to Vengrov, they start taking people to work...the Germans...for working.\nDigging...telling us to make the...put in water pipes or other pipes, you know. So everybody\nstarted running again. Not everybody was able to do this work. And we heard of it...you\nknow, rumors were going around that whoever they took and they couldn't work, they threw\nthem in and...like he said...they killed them. So I...in between, I got married.",
        "Q: Somebody you had known for a while?",
        "A: I didn't know him too much. I mean not too long. Maybe I knew him about six, seven\nmonths. He was from a different city. He was from Siedlce. I don't know if you have an idea.\nI got married.",
        "Q: This was a strange time to get married.",
        "A: Well, it was no wedding. We just...we got married. As a matter of fact, my oldest brother\ngave us Khupe and Kdu'shn.\u2019 You know what Khupe and Kdu'shn means? He gave ...the\nceremony. Just the ceremony. And we kept on being there but they...we couldn't stay in our\ncity too long, because they start taking out people to work. They send them in all kind of\nplaces to work. And he used to do a little business, back and forth. From Vengrov, with my...\nyou know, to Siedlce. Being that my brothers were in this business...leather business...we\nstarted...you know, you should make a little living, you know. So he started to buy leather.\nNot make...not finished leather. Finished leather ...but just the leather. And transferred to\nSiedlce. And that's the way he sell them there. As a matter of fact, a brother of mine took him\nin, in that business. So when it got so bad...and his family was there. And they had a big\nhouse. So he wanted me to come there. Because they already had taken out the people.\nThere was not too, not too much people in that city... Siedlce. There was 30, 40 miles from\nVengrov. So they said it gonna be, he...they...he had heard it whenever they took out the\npeople to kill them or to burn them or to take them to the gas chambers, they said he's never\ngonna come again. And people ran away to woods, to all kinds of places. So I went to\n\u2019 wedding canopy and prayer; wedlock (Hebrew/Yiddish)\nSiedlce. But it was not true. Because when he killed...then he went to different people and he\nfind out... I mean the Germans...he came back to the same people. The ones that they came\nback, they were hiding. Came back to their city. And he start taking out again. So he came\nback to his...to Siedlce. And I was staying there with him. Then they came to Vengrov. And\nthey took out from Vengrov again. So I escaped 1n the woods. I was in the woods a couple\ndays. Every shot was a Jew falling. Right near me. They didn't...I don't know how that they\nseen me...they didn't see me, I don't know. Because the shots, you heard them so near from\nyou that you could know that it wasn't too far. You know what I mean? Well, anyway, that's\nhow we went through until they came back and they start taking out again the Jews. From\nVengrov.",
        "Q: So you went to the woods. Did you come back to Vengrov?",
        "A: From the woods, I came back to the...yeah.",
        "Q: You were with your husband?",
        "A: No. I wasn't that time with my husband. When they start taking out again, they took me to\nTreblinka. From Vengrov. I went to Treblinka.",
        "Q: Just so that I understand this. The Germans came in, in several different round-ups...",
        "A: Yeah. And twice they came into the same cities.",
        "Q: And in between, some people like yourself had gotten out to the woods.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But some of you went back...",
        "A: Some...when we came back...when they said it's quieter now and we could come back, we\ncame back. So meanwhile, we were all hiding. He went to the same city when nobody was\nthere. You know what I mean? Then when...",
        "Q: What happened the day they came in to take you...to transport you to Treblinka? What was\nhappening?",
        "A: When we went away...when I was in Siedlce, they...they used to...the same thing like in\nVengrov. They used to take coming in the morning and take out some people to work for\nthem. Also digging and, you know, those tunnels and all kind of things. For water or for\nwhatever, the pipes to put in. They took people to work. And they took me also to work. And\nI remained there. I remained there and then when they start again to take out from Siedlce\nthey took me from there. Me and his family kenem\u2019. I don't know where his family was, but\nI was constantly with him.",
        "Q: Your husband?",
        "A: Yeah. The people got prepared...when they went into the train they got prepared with all\nkind of etches with.... With all kind of things. They knew what people are doing, that they\nopen up doors and they screaming \"Escape,\" because the doors are open. I heard...my\nhusband was yelling to me \"Norma, leave. Scream. Go out. The doors are open.\" So I went\nout. In between I went out, I lost him. I lost...1 knew where to go from Siedlce because from\nthe farm where we used to live was not too far to go there. To the, to the train. So I knew, I\nknew, where I am and what place I, what section I am. So I went back to the wood. Near a\nfarm, which it was never Jews there. Just...I knew people...like I said, my mother was a\ndressmaker. And we had work to do for them. I was doing with my mother, the work. And I\nremember that one of the Polish people...we were very, very friendly. They were very good\nto us. I said \"I'm going to her. Maybe she'll hide me.\" But they were afraid for themself. So\nwhile I was going with her, I knew that I'm getting lost. I'm not...I'm not in the same place, it\nwas the place but it was not that way to go to her, maybe. It was the other way. So I turn in\nthe other side of the way. While I'm walking, I meet a Polish woman. And I said to her, in\nPolish, \"Hello\"...whatever in Polish 1s...\"Dzien Dobry.\" And I ask her \"Maybe you know\"...I\nask her from where she is. And she says...she mentioned the place, the name where\nthat...where I'm looking for that woman. She didn't have a husband, her husband died. She\nhad two daughters with her. So I asked her in Polish \"Maybe you know Pani\"...\"Pani\"\nmeans \"Mrs.\"...where Pani Biernotska (ph) lives.\" She looks at me and looks at me and she\nsays \"Of course I know. That's my mother.\" I wasn't too happy. Because she had boys...only\nboys. Four boys. And they belonged to the AK.\u2019 And I was going to find out that it's her\nmother, I wasn't so happy about it. I figured I'm afraid already, but I went. She took me\novernight. She put me in a hiding place...in a shed there. And the next day she came in and\nshe said to me...she cried for me. I could see her tears.\n\"I'm sorry that I have to tell you to leave.\" I says \"What, Mrs., we, we knew each other so\nmany years, you were a friend of ours. Why do you telling me to leave?\" She says \"Look.\nFirst of all, you know what's going on. If they find you, I'll be killed and my children will be\nkilled.\" So I said to her \"Why should they find me by you? You're near to the field. They\n* know (Yiddish)\n* Armia Krajowa (Home Army): One of the underground military organizations in occupied\nPoland; it existed from the fall of 1939 until January 1945.\ngoing around more, you know, inside the farms. Inside the people.\" She says \"My daughters\nhave boyfriends. German boyfriends. And they constantly by me. And they going around\nwith dogs.\" And that's what they did. They were going around with dogs to find Jewish\npeople. I went...I went away.",
        "Q: You're completely alone now?",
        "A: I'm alone.",
        "Q: You didn't...did you see your husband get shot or...",
        "A: No. He jumped and I jumped when we...we got right away separated. Because he was in...he\nwas in a different place. Not in a different place. He was like in the train by the end and I\nmaybe was in the middle. All I heard is \"Norma, leave. Jump. Run. Jump.\" But I imagine...\nbecause if he would be alive he would find me or he would let himself know where I am. He\nknew, where I coming and he knew where I am going. But I never found him. And that\nremained. I never found him.",

        "A: I know that people are going to Treblinka.",
        "Q: How did you know that?",
        "A: Because they started taking out Vengrov, when I was in Vengrov and then they went to\nSiedlce, and then they came\nback to Vengrov and they went back to Siedlce, I told you\nbefore, they kept going back and back.",
        "Q: But how did you know Treblinka was the final destination?",
        "A: All the people from Vengrov, they went to Treblinka, which I\nknow. Then when I went to Siedlce they said they going to\nTreblinka too.",

        "Q: The reason I'm asking you is because since the people who went to Treblinka never left\nTreblinka, how did you get information about...",
        "A: There were some people left over. They were hiding. And they came back. I told you, they\ncame back to the city. Because they said also the same. People said, \"Oh, sizh shein\ngevorin.\u201d\u201d\u201d They took out the people is not coming back, but they still came back for the rest\nof them. They knew that people were hiding and they coming back to the house. They knew.\nThey were smart.\nTt happened already. (Yiddish)",
        "Q: So how long were you on the train and when did you jump?",
        "A: Like I said, we went in the train maybe towards the evening. Like four o'clock...something\nlike. It was no mind that time to keep minds of watches, of times or when you going or when\nyou coming. You didn't know what's doing with you. You went. But the only thing that I\nremember distinctly that it must have been about two o'clock midnight when we start\njumping because it took them time to work by the doors, to open them up. They had all kind\nof instruments to open up the doors. People in the train.",

And he knew...in\nthat place I went to, they had a farm. It wasn't really a farm...considered part of a farm. I\nknew that my brother is very familiar with that man. They had...he had a restaurant. He had a\nbig restaurant and he was a very rich man. And he killed a lot of pigs, you know, meat. He\nhad ...he was allowed to have liquor. But I knew also from that first woman from the farm I\nmet...what I told you...she told me that she knows from good sources that one of my brother\nis alive. And I...she told me the name so I knew that he's familiar with that man from the\nrestaurant. Maybe he knows something, and maybe I could find that brother of mine. That\nwas Christmastime. I don't remember it was a week before Christmas or a day before\nChristmas. This I don't know. But I know that I went there. Barefooted. In the snow in\nJanuary.",
        "Q: Is this 1942 or...",
        "A: '43.",
        "Q: '43. Okay.",
        "A: I went there. I came in...that was the city where we used to live. The farm where we used to\nlive but out of the farm, like on the field. I went there, I came in and there was a lot of\nGermans 1n the store. Not in the restaurant where they serve, but in the store. You know, to\norder something or buy something. And I also recognized somebody. One of my sisters...I\ndon't know if this is interested to you. One of my sister...a friend...1s there and I recognized\nhis wife. But when I came in to her, I didn't come in straight right to her. I couldn't go in\nbecause I had to go in through that store. From the restaurant...to the restaurant store. So I\ncouldn't because the Germans were sitting. It must have been about six o'clock. Dark...it was\ndark already.\nBut when I came in, there was a corridor with a big...you know, big doors to close that place.\nSo I went...1t was just like this. You see? The door...this is the door, and I'm here. It's closed\nhere. And I'm standing closed behind that door. Because I'm afraid to go into the store\nbecause the Germans are there. And I recognize that man, and I knew...she knew that he\ngave up Jewish people for a pound of sugar. That was a neighbor of ours. A best friend of\nmy sister's. While I was standing, standing here...I'll never forget that, that picture. While I'm\nstanding here, the owner's wife was passing by to the room where they served the people,\nyou know what I mean? And I...I don't know what to do. I'm shivering and I want, I want her\nto know that I'm here. So I said in Polish, \"Pani Pocinska (ph).\" And she recognized my\nvoice. After so many years we weren't there. Maybe for 10, 15 years, she recognized my\nvoice. She says, \"Norma?\" I says, \"Yes.\" She says, \"Shhh.\" So she went in and closed all the\nlights. The lights were supposed to be on, I think, only to eight or seven o'clock. I think until\nseven o'clock. To seven o'clock, I think the light was supposed to be only. She closed the\nlight in the store and she closed the light where the people were sitting and eating, where I\ntold you before, the, in the room. And she came back to me, she took me and she put me\nunder the bed. She was very good to us.",
        "Q: Didn't anybody wonder why the lights went off?",
        "A: I'm telling you, it wasn't allowed to have lights a certain time. A certain time. I think it was\nseven...seven or eight. No, it must be at...when it got dark, you, you weren't allowed to have\nlights.",
        "Q: So the Germans couldn't see in.",
        "A: That's right. When it got dark on the streets, the...there was no lights on the street. I mean, the\ntime 1s when it gets dark so there weren't allowed to be lights. Not only in the restaurant, but\neven in the house you had to cover up the lights. Anyway, she took me in and pushed me in\nunder the bed...under her daughter's bed. She had that one daughter. And then when they\nwent away, she took me into the kitchen, where she gave me to eat. And I said to her,\n\"Where's your husband?\" And she says, \"My husband's not here.\" She knew that I wanna\nstay. I says, \"So where is he?\" She says he's...he produced his own, let's say...how to say it?\nThe Polish...the Polish food. Sausages, kielbasa...you know what kielbasa is? All kind of, of\nthis Polish meat preserves.\nShe, he did...he had a special place like where they don't cook it but they...they roast it or\nsomething, you know. They smoke it. They smoke it. They had a place where they smoking\nit. He had a separate place in the yard where he had a room and they smoked it. So she told\nme he's there with the workers. So she says, \"Why do you need him?\" I says, \"I would like\nto talk to Pan Pocinski (ph)\". Mr. Pocinski (ph). And she says, \"He'll be coming in late.\" I\nsays, When is he gonna finish?\" She says, \"Oh, about twelve, one o'clock.\" And I wanted\nto know from her. I figured if she'll tell me that anybody's living yet in Vengrov, maybe they\nwere hidden somewhere and now it's quiet, they came back. So I wanted to know if he know\nabout it...something. If he knows about it, maybe I'll go to Vengrov. Back. Coming\nfrom...jumping from Treblinka. Anyway, I waited and I asked her, \"Maybe you know\nsomething. I heard that a brother of mine, my brother, Fishel (ph)... he's in the picture...is\nalive.\" \"Maybe you know where he is.\" \"Oh, no, we don't know.\" She right away told me\nthis. \"We don't know; we never saw him.\" I said, \"Maybe Pan Pocinski (ph) know.\" Mr.\nPocinski (ph). She says, \"I doubt\" ...1n Polish...\"I doubt that he knows.\" She did...she...I don't\nknow. I think she was afraid of him, that maybe he wouldn't want me to know. You know\nwhat I mean? So anyway, that remained. I was there between seven and eight 'til about one\no'clock at night. By one o'clock he came in. Meanwhile, I ate and I kept on saying if\nnobody's alive for me...1f Mendel (ph) and Moishe (ph) and Schlomo (ph)... everybody went\nto Treblinka, they're not alive...what do I have to live? I have no money, I have no clothes on\nme. What do I have to live? Winter, cold, barefooted. I'm going to Vengrov. \"Oh,\" she says,\n\"they're going to kill you on the way.\" That's what she told me. \"They going to kill you on\nthe way, because they\"...they was...I read about place that they kept on hiding and looking\nfor Jews there. And on the way, you know, it was like woods. She says, \"You wouldn't go\nthere. They gonna kill you right away.\" And I kept on saying to her, \"So what am I\nsupposed to do?\" Make her notice that maybe she'll keep me. And meanwhile he came in,\none o'clock in the morning he came in. And the same thing, drink with him and this and that.\nSo I says, \"Look, I'm not in the mood. I ate. Your wife gave me to eat.\" And she put me in all\nkind of things in the pockets in the coat. But I had food to eat.\nShe thought maybe I will go. And he stopped me again. I said, \"Do you know where Fishel\n(ph) is?\" Fil (ph). He says, \"No, I don't know Fil (ph). I didn't see him since the war started.\"\nBut I heard a lot of rumors that he was...he was, in between the time that you could do some\nbusiness, he was afraid for the Polish money. That they gonna discontinue the Polish money,\nso he wanted the change for American dollars. So my brother used to change him. Come and\ntake the money, change them in the city for gold. Gold, gold pieces. American money.\nAmerican gold. So I had the idea that he does this with him and he knew, but he didn't want\nto admit to me. And I was afraid to tell him that. You saw him and he...you probably know\nabout him, maybe you heard about him. Everything went like, not noticing for sure, you\nknow what I mean? Finally, he gave in. But that, that picture, you should have seen it.\nFinally, he gave in. He says to me this way...he holds my hand and he says to me, \"You\nreally want to see him.\" You know, in Polish it has a little more meaning, more...more\npicture, you know what I mean? \"You really want to see him.\" And I said to him in Polish...1\nanswered him, \"Pan Pocinski (ph), do you think that that's the only one left, and I don't want\nto see him?\" He let my hand go. And he said, he said something to her which I don't\nremember even...it's like a wink, with the eyes. And he took me by the hand and he takes me\nin that room where it was the dining room. Where the people used to eat. And on the way\ngoing to him, I had to go through that place, the corridor where I was hidden behind the\ndoor. The door from the first coming in. And he said to me on the way, \"Don't tell me that\nyou want to be with him.\" So and...that tell me that maybe he has a small place somewhere\nhe is hiding him and he can't make the place bigger for somebody else, or something. But I\nknew in me that he wouldn't let me go. He took me in and my brother was laying on the\nfloor. A little pillow and a little stool with a little blanket to cover himself up. He was\nsleeping. He said...he woke him up. He woke him up and he noticed that he's worse.\nSo I remember distinctly what he said to him. \"What's the matter, they by you?\" In Polish.\nThat means that the Germans came into him in the middle of the night. You know what I\nmean? He was doing things where he wasn't allowed to do and my brother knew it. He was\nkilling too much pigs. He was, he had rationing...he had tickets, so much he's allowed to kill.\nBut he was doing more. And my brother knew about it and everybody knew that he's killing\ntoo much in the place. Anyway, so he woke him up and my brother said to him he probably\nknew that maybe it was before I came also the same story...somebody...he came in and woke\nhim up and he threw him. He made in the corner of the room...he took out four boards and he\nmade a tunnel. He was outside constantly. Like during the daytime, and he slept outside.\nYou know, in the room. But God forbid if they came in, if he knew that they here and maybe\nthey'll come in, he shoveled him 1n, in that tunnel. You know, he made that tunnel there and\nhe covered our back with the boards, he didn't make the boards separate, he made like a door\nfrom the boards. And on the, on the door was a machine, a Singer's machine, a sewing\nmachine to demonstrate that nothing is there, you know what I mean? So he pushed him in\nthere. So that's why he asked him, \"What's the matter, they here?\" My brother asked him,\n\"What's the matter, they here?\" He says, \"No, your sister is here.\" He was, you know, sleepy\nand he didn't know...he couldn't believe, because the train who went to Treblinka with those\npeople from Siedlce the second time wasn't too far. They went in...they went through our,\nour farm. So he knew that it was another train going into Treblinka. So he was very scared.\nHe didn't know what happened. A sister surviving yet, from that train? Well, anyway, I was\nthere the rest of the couple of hours was still dark, the nighttime. And then he came in about\nnine o'clock in the morning and he said to me, \"So what do you intend to do, Norma? Your\nbrother is gonna stay here. I would not throw him out. What's gonna be with you?\"\nAnd I'm speechless. What can I tell him? I says, \"Look, Pan Pocinski (ph), whatever you\ndecide is good with me.\" That means whatever he wants to do with me, let him do. I'm in his\nhands now. I can't go to Vengrov and I can't stay here, so what am I gonna do? He wants to\nkill me, let him kill me. He says, \"Look, I'll take in more shovels, we make the tunnel bigger\nand you stay with your brother as long as I'm alive.\" And that was that. But being...I told you\nin the beginning, my brother was a sick man. He got sick because he was...right in the\nbeginning he was in the woods and he got sick on the kidneys. So he says, \"You gonna stay\ntogether with him as long as I live and as long as I can do something for you.\" Because he\nwas very friendly with our family and that's it. So they went...we stay in there for about four\nmonths together with my brother. If anything happens, we went into that bunker. Took off\nthe machine and then we went in and put back the machine on.",
        "Q: What did you do in the daytime?",
        "A: In the daytime, we were out. We were in the, in the room.",
        "Q: You're working or...",
        "A: Well, what kind of work? We were sitting and looking out. The windows was closed with\nthick curtains that the outside shouldn't, we saw outside, but the outside couldn't see us, you\nknow. So we were sitting and watching, we were reading, my brother was praying. We had\npraying book. I remember like now that it was before Passover, because that everything\nhappens in the winter time. She said to my brother, \"I know that it's the meaning, you have to\neat matzo. You're not allowed to eat bread.\" You know what I mean. So she, they had a\noven, so she had...she made the oven and she gave him flour. And I made the dough and we\nbaked matzos. We baked a couple, a couple pound, about five pound flour. The meaning\nfrom the matzo, for Passover. And then my brother got worse and worse. And I don't know if\nI should tell you that she wanted...they wanted to save us. They wanted so much to save us.\nWhen he got very, very sick already, she went away to Sokolow...that's nearer than\nSiedIce...to a city which she had a doctor. Very, you know ...probably everybody who has a\ndoctor is very close to the doctor. And she said a lie to him, to the doctor, that my\nbrother...\"My father is such a sick man that I can't even bring him to you.\"\nBut I...she took a bottle of his phena (ph) medication, prescription, and she said, \"I want that\nprescription again. They don't want to give me no medications from that prescription because\nit's already overdue.\" The time, you know, when the prescription ...like six months later, or\nwhatever later. And the doctor was supposed...that's what she told us. The doctor said, \"You\ndon't have a, a father. Your father's not sick. You having a Jew there.\" And while he said\nthere that you have a Jew, she escaped from him. And she came back home and she told us\nthis. She told me, not him. And a couple weeks later, he died. And I buried him. I don't know\nif he's still there, but I buried him with my bare hands. He made the cave. He made the cave,\nand I buried him, my brother, there. That was a orchard behind the, the building. Behind the\nhouse was a orchard. So I don't know this, but she told me this story that they asked him, \"In\ncase something happens, where do you want to be buried?\" So he told them, \"Bury me\nunder that and that tree, a pear tree.\" So that was the pear tree where he was buried. I used to\ngo there.",
        "Q: So now you're all alone...",
        "A: Now I'm all alone and I have nobody in Vengrov. Meanwhile, in between that time, they\ntook out my two brothers. Two brothers were remained with...they had those business that I\ntold you. They kept him such a long time. They had to teach him the business. They taught\nhim the business and they took out everything, all the letters, all the valuable things and the\nmachines, and they took them to Treblinka. The reason why I'm telling you this, that then I\nheard when that man was working there by the glasses, what I mention before, my husband\nsaid it's not true. What he have to... what was pushing him to say that he said that he wants\nthose two people to help him because it's too much work for him? He was sorting the glasses\nthat the people took off, like my husband told you, that everything went 1n place, pants and\nunderwear, that's separate. And this separate, and glasses separate, whatever gold separate.\nEverything went separates places.",
        "Q: This is a man separating clothes in Treblinka?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah. So anyway, that's what I heard. He told me, that man who died, Reizman (ph), that he\nwent over to somebody, the highest rank, and he told them that Moishe (ph) and Mendel (ph)\nis here, and I would like maybe you could give him help, because it's too much for me to do.\nAnd it's a lot of people came in there and a lot of people wearing glasses, so maybe they\ncould help me. So they put him the same day in the fire. So that's what I know, I know while\nI was running around from one place to the other that Mendel (ph) and Moishe (ph) is not\nalive. And I have nobody. And that was the, the thing. But I also then find out...in, in that\ntown I live through the...I was there 'til the last minute we got liberated.",
        "Q: At this restaurant?",
        "A: At this restaurant, I was there. I was there 'til I got liberated. But when I got liberated, I went\nto Vengrov.",
        "Q: So you were, so you were at this home, this restaurant, for how long, do you think? Totally?",
        "A: About a year. Maybe more. Like I told you before, it was no time, not time, time we had\nplenty. We didn't have a lot to do with ourselves. But was nothing in the mind to remember\nwhat day it 1s and what time it is or what month it is. Who was thinking about it? We were\nwant that the day should go faster, maybe we'll live through this, this trouble.",
        "Q: Now when were you liberated, and by whom?",
        "A: I was liberated by Russians. When I went away to Siedlce and when everything finished and\nthe war finished, I went back to Vengrov.",
        "Q: No, but, but when you were liberated by Russians, did you actually see Russians or you just\nknew the Russians came in?",
        "A: No, no. I was in the woods, like I said, again...",
        "Q: Oh, you weren't in this house with the restaurant?",
        "A: I went away from there to Vengrov near...there was near woods there. So I was there. But\nstill the Russians, Germans were there.",
        "Q: Oh, I thought you stayed in the house until liberation. I'm sorry, I'm very confused. It's my\nfault.",
        "A: I was staying in that house 'til the liberation, 'til the Germans left. It was still Germans, and\nwe were still afraid of them. The Germans were there and the Russians start to come in.\nBut I went in, in the woods, and from the woods I went in somebody what I knew to also\nwhere they live in a farm there, their own farm. And he went out, there was shooting around\nright away. The Russians were shooting to the Germans and the Germans were shooting to\nthe Russians the airplanes were running. So one fellow came in, a young man came in and\nhe kept on yelling, \"The Russians are coming. The Russians are coming.\" So I jumped out\nfrom the (undecipherable), where the Russians are. That the Russians...we liberated, the\nRussians are coming. They took it over. Meanwhile, I was shot.",
        "Q: By...",
        "A: By the Russians.",
        "Q: Unintentionally.",
        "A: Unintentionally. Of course. Because I was running where the Russians.",
        "Q: Why did you ever leave the house?",
        "A: They were afraid. And I was...I can't say that I, I felt that, that maybe they gonna be killed or\nsomething, but I couldn't have in me that because of me they should be killed. They wanted\nthe good for me and for my brother. Why should they be killed because of me? They killed\nthem anyway. They killed them anyway...her and him. One day they came in, they came in\nto eat breakfast at the restaurant and they served them and when they went to the buffet to\npay, they ask how much they want. And they told him how much he want...the bill is. They\ntook out the gun, they killed them both. The daughter was in the church, so she remained\nalive. She's still alive, probably.",
        "Q: So here in the woods, you got shot by a mistaken bullet...",
        "A: Yeah. No, I got shot when...by the liberation.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: By the...when the...we went out, like I said. We went out to look at the Russians and the\nGermans are fighting in the air. They shooting. So we went out to look, we wanted that the\nRussians should come 1n because we knew that that's the way it's gonna finish and maybe\nwe'll be liberated. So while we were running around outside, I got shot here. I don't know if\nit's still there, because it's a long time. It wasn't a big wound. It healed itself. And that...I\nnever found my husband. Then I went back to Vengrov. I was back and forth. And he came\nfrom his city.",
        "Q: Did you feel that you were finally free? Was this...I'm sorry. We have to change the tape.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTAPE #3",
        "Q: You went back to Vengrov after you were liberated...",
        "A: After I was liberated, I was hiding by, hiding by, before we were liberated and I went away\nto that good friend of ours, we were a month in a shack where they keeping...how do they\nsay hay in English? Hay? Do you know what hay means? What they feeding the horses and\nthe cows. They take out...the grass dries out and they, they put it back in the shack. They\nhave it for the winter for the cows and the horses. So we went into...one place the farmer\ndidn't know that we were there, we hiding there. But then he find us and he kept us for a little\nwhile. We paid him. When my brother died, he had gold pieces, which he was supposed to\ngive to him, you know, like I said. Changing the money. So of course I had it with me. So we\nwent in...I met...as a matter of fact, not that I met. That same woman, she was a good and\nvery friendly to us...with the two daughters...the first one. She told me that there was some\nboys in this-and this-city going around the...you know, people used to go around at night and\nbeg for bread or potato or something. So they probably used to come to her, too. She knew\nthem. They weren't too far from her living. So she told me that if you want, I could tell those\nboys...there's one woman with them in Siedlce with a husband...so maybe you could connect\nwith them and not being alone. So I was a couple of months with them, before the liberation.\nSo that's what I know her, she was, she was so good. They were afraid for themself and I\ndon't blame them.",
        "Q: After liberation, you first went back to Vengrov?",
        "A: After I was liberated, the next day I went to Vengrov.",
        "Q: What did you find there?",
        "A: Coming in, coming into the city, I met a man. I didn't recognize him. I know him, because he\nwas a customer by my brother's. He was...he get orders for the shoes but he had to make the\nbottoms. So my brother made the tops and he made the bottoms. So he recognized me. One\nof the brothers that he say they burned him. Mendel (ph). He said to me, \"You know that\nMendel's (ph) daughter 1s alive?\" He had two sons and one daughter. I don't know how he\nknows. I never asked him how he knows. You had to be careful with everything, you\nunderstand this. But I asked him, \"Where? Where is she?\" So he told us that he heard...he\ndidn't want to say that he knows for sure...he heard that she's with this-and-this people which\nthey used to live in the same section where my brother lived. So my brother gave away the\nrest what he possessed, with some money probably, I'm sure of it. Because they wouldn't\nkeep that money, that he should save that daughter. The sons were killed in Treblinka, two\nsons. So they kept her and she's alive. The reason why she is alive is, when I got connected\nwith my sister, I told her that my brother Mendel's (ph) daughter is alive and she...",
        "Q: Your sister in America?",
        "A: In America, sure. I didn't have another sister. And here in this country they had clubs, or\nwhatever they call it, where they used to go out...what do you call it? I forgot how to call it.\nThey had people where they, they used to take out people...Polish...take out children from\nPolish people. You probably heard about it, right? Did you? No, you were too young to hear\nabout it. They used to have, you know, agencies where they used to go out to Europe to take\nout Jewish children from Polish people, where they survived there. So my sister find out,\nwhile she knew that her brother's, that my brother's child is alive, the daughter, she knew\nabout it. And they had somebody who, he was a little bit macher.'' You know, to go to\nEurope to take out the children from Polish people. So he got in touch with them. My sister\nthen got in touch with them, through him and they took her away from her. They went there\nprobably with an airplane. Otherwise, they didn't go, they didn't have any other\ncommunications to go to Europe, from America to Europe. They came with an airplane and\nthey...she didn't want to give it to her, give away to her. She had one daughter, too, that\nwoman. The Polish woman. So she said...she didn't have even an idea what a dollar is ...how\nmuch a dollar is. So she said she wants thousand dollar. Thousand dollar, she wants thousand\ndollars so they gave her thousand dollars. She said thousand dollars, they gave her thousand\ndollars. The, the girl, the daughter, took care on that...on my niece. I showed her to you, my\nniece. So while they took...and they took her first probably, they knew how to go on with\nthis.\nThey took her first on the plane and they ran away. So she was acquainted with a lot of\nGermans. She used to live with a lot of Germans, you know. She was one of those nice girls.\nSo she connected a soldier, a German, and they took her...they ran away to stop the plane but\nthey didn't.\n(William Schneidermann interjects.)\nThey were still Germans. They are living, they were living, what are you talking? They were\nstill living while when they took her away.",
        "Q: Ok, so what did you do next? You're in the town...did the town look the same to you...",
        "A: What I did next, I didn't have money because I paid out all my money to that farmer where\nthey kept me, you know. And he also told me that some family...I never knew that this... they\ncarried the same name. Second name. But I never knew that they really family, you know.\nBut they had the same name. So when he told me that my brother's daughter is alive and\nshe's this-and-this people, he also told me, \"You have some cousins, they survived. They\n'' someone who arranges things, has connections (Yiddish)\nhere.\" And they were in the leather business. Just the leather business they were handling. So\nI figured, cousins. They say that I'm a cousin. So I'll try to go in there. So I went in there and\nwe were cousins. But I was like a maid to them. I had to wash, I had to cook, I had to clean\nto have food. And that was the rest of my life, until...",
        "Q: Until what?",
        "A: I met... met him.",
        "Q: You met who? He's not in the...we're not seeing him.",
        "A: He's not in the room. I met my husband.",
        "Q: How did you meet?",
        "A: I met my boyfriend. From their city, they used to come to Vengrov. You know, they did a\nlittle business. And he got acquainted with that family. There was a...practically the whole\nfamily survived. Two girls, and brothers? What was it? The ketzalach.'* Three brothers and\ntwo girls. I know there were two girls. Three brothers and two girls were in the family. And\nthey weren't, like he said to you before from the big workers they didn't know, they were rich\npeople, you know. They used to have a maid.

I think, if I'm not mistaken, it was like a week\nbefore Rosh Hashanah they came in. And it took them not too long to start taking out the\nJews. Yom Kippur they...they...how to say? They took us around...they took us around, all\naround. And we were all in shul,\u201d this I remember distinctly. We were all in shul, my whole\nfamily. And of course the other people were there.

From where we\nwere living. It was early in the morning...in those times, then when they came in right\naway...that you weren't allowed to be in the evening in the street. And you weren't allowed to\nbe the early in the morning in the street. They had certain hours. You probably know about\nit. And they caught him coming back already. It must have been about 7, 7:30. Because it\nwas after the morning prayer. And they beat him up. But they wanted to cut his beard. He\nhad a beautiful beard like you see in the, in the picture. And he didn't let himself. So that's\nwhen they told me...I was the only one that was with them, because the rest of the people\nwere in Vengrov. There in the thing. That was in Vengrov.

        "A: All right. So we were talking about, on Yom Kippur, how you were talking with the family\nand trying to figure out what to do.",
        "A: What to do. Where to go, where to hide. So everybody went in a different place to hide. Of\ncourse, my father wasn't alive already. We buried him. And only my mother. So I had to\nwatch after my mother. She was an elderly woman and she didn't...she couldn't take care on\nherself. And she couldn't walk too good. So I took her with me where I was hiding. In the\nsame building where we were living. We went on the roof. On the attic...not on the roof. On\nthe attic there, there was a place. They called it the boidem\u00ae or whatever you.... And there\nwas a lot of boxes and clothing ...what people throw out, you know, to give away.\nSo I, I, took her to one box and I covered her up with the certain clothes. And I went in\nanother place like...not far from her. Not to be together...one for us to be alive. And we\nsurvived, a couple days there on the roof. We took with us the...whatever was to eat in the\nhouse. What we had from before, prepared. And we had there...while we were sitting on the\nattic there. Finally, they, they stopped going for the Jews to take them there...to take them in\none place. So we went out...and I was remaining 1n the, in the apartment where I used to live.\nIt was on the top of our apartment. On the attic. But my mother said that...\"I want to go to\nSchlomo (ph)\"...that was the oldest son. The oldest brother. He's in the picture. \"I want to go\nup to him.\" And it was very far to go to him. It was to the...about 10 blocks to go over or\nmaybe more. Just approximately. But she went. She went and they killed her there on the\nplace. They caught her there, in the alley. It was alleys to go into the buildings. So they\ncaught her and they killed her there. We didn't know the funeral. We didn't know nothing.\nWe didn't know it. We only know that they took her to the cemetery. But where in the\ncemetery, what, we didn't know. There's no cemetery anyway there, anymore. And that was\nthe living after this.",

        "A: It was regular living but it was no living, you know. During the war, it was no living. It was,\nit was torture. We went from one place to the other. Also...while I'm talking I'm reminding\nmyself...when the bombs start to come in, we went into a neighborhood not far from that\nfarm where we used to live before the war. We knew some people. And they took us in. And\nwe were there...sorry... They took us in for a couple days. They put us in the basement\n\u00b0 attic (Yiddish)\nbecause the soldiers were only more in the cities, in the bigger cities. Not so much on the\nfarm and those neighborhoods. We were there a couple days.",
        "A: Some other people, Jews. They were living there in that, on that farm. And it was maybe\nabout five or six families, that's all. Not too many. So when we came back...when we came\nback to the city, to Vengrov, they start taking people to work...the Germans...for working.\nDigging...telling us to make the...put in water pipes or other pipes, you know. So everybody\nstarted running again. Not everybody was able to do this work. And we heard of it...you\nknow, rumors were going around that whoever they took and they couldn't work, they threw\nthem in and...like he said...they killed them. So I...in between, I got married.",
        "A: I didn't know him too much. I mean not too long. Maybe I knew him about six, seven\nmonths. He was from a different city. He was from Siedlce. I don't know if you have an idea.\nI got married.",
        "A: Well, it was no wedding. We just...we got married. As a matter of fact, my oldest brother\ngave us Khupe and Kdu'shn.\u2019 You know what Khupe and Kdu'shn means? He gave ...the\nceremony. Just the ceremony. And we kept on being there but they...we couldn't stay in our\ncity too long, because they start taking out people to work. They send them in all kind of\nplaces to work. And he used to do a little business, back and forth. From Vengrov, with my...\nyou know, to Siedlce. Being that my brothers were in this business...leather business...we\nstarted...you know, you should make a little living, you know. So he started to buy leather.\nNot make...not finished leather. Finished leather ...but just the leather. And transferred to\nSiedlce. And that's the way he sell them there. As a matter of fact, a brother of mine took him\nin, in that business. So when it got so bad...and his family was there. And they had a big\nhouse. So he wanted me to come there. Because they already had taken out the people.\nThere was not too, not too much people in that city... Siedlce. There was 30, 40 miles from\nVengrov. So they said it gonna be, he...they...he had heard it whenever they took out the\npeople to kill them or to burn them or to take them to the gas chambers, they said he's never\ngonna come again. And people ran away to woods, to all kinds of places. So I went to\n\u2019 wedding canopy and prayer; wedlock (Hebrew/Yiddish)\nSiedlce. But it was not true. Because when he killed...then he went to different people and he\nfind out... I mean the Germans...he came back to the same people. The ones that they came\nback, they were hiding. Came back to their city. And he start taking out again. So he came\nback to his...to Siedlce. And I was staying there with him. Then they came to Vengrov. And\nthey took out from Vengrov again. So I escaped 1n the woods. I was in the woods a couple\ndays. Every shot was a Jew falling. Right near me. They didn't...I don't know how that they\nseen me...they didn't see me, I don't know. Because the shots, you heard them so near from\nyou that you could know that it wasn't too far. You know what I mean? Well, anyway, that's\nhow we went through until they came back and they start taking out again the Jews. From\nVengrov.",
        "A: From the woods, I came back to the...yeah.",
        "A: No. I wasn't that time with my husband. When they start taking out again, they took me to\nTreblinka. From Vengrov. I went to Treblinka.",
        "A: Yeah. And twice they came into the same cities.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Some...when we came back...when they said it's quieter now and we could come back, we\ncame back. So meanwhile, we were all hiding. He went to the same city when nobody was\nthere. You know what I mean? Then when...",
        "A: When we went away...when I was in Siedlce, they...they used to...the same thing like in\nVengrov. They used to take coming in the morning and take out some people to work for\nthem. Also digging and, you know, those tunnels and all kind of things. For water or for\nwhatever, the pipes to put in. They took people to work. And they took me also to work. And\nI remained there. I remained there and then when they start again to take out from Siedlce\nthey took me from there. Me and his family kenem\u2019. I don't know where his family was, but\nI was constantly with him.",
        "A: Yeah. The people got prepared...when they went into the train they got prepared with all\nkind of etches with.... With all kind of things. They knew what people are doing, that they\nopen up doors and they screaming \"Escape,\" because the doors are open. I heard...my\nhusband was yelling to me \"Norma, leave. Scream. Go out. The doors are open.\" So I went\nout. In between I went out, I lost him. I lost...1 knew where to go from Siedlce because from\nthe farm where we used to live was not too far to go there. To the, to the train. So I knew, I\nknew, where I am and what place I, what section I am. So I went back to the wood. Near a\nfarm, which it was never Jews there. Just...I knew people...like I said, my mother was a\ndressmaker. And we had work to do for them. I was doing with my mother, the work. And I\nremember that one of the Polish people...we were very, very friendly. They were very good\nto us. I said \"I'm going to her. Maybe she'll hide me.\" But they were afraid for themself. So\nwhile I was going with her, I knew that I'm getting lost. I'm not...I'm not in the same place, it\nwas the place but it was not that way to go to her, maybe. It was the other way. So I turn in\nthe other side of the way. While I'm walking, I meet a Polish woman. And I said to her, in\nPolish, \"Hello\"...whatever in Polish 1s...\"Dzien Dobry.\" And I ask her \"Maybe you know\"...I\nask her from where she is. And she says...she mentioned the place, the name where\nthat...where I'm looking for that woman. She didn't have a husband, her husband died. She\nhad two daughters with her. So I asked her in Polish \"Maybe you know Pani\"...\"Pani\"\nmeans \"Mrs.\"...where Pani Biernotska (ph) lives.\" She looks at me and looks at me and she\nsays \"Of course I know. That's my mother.\" I wasn't too happy. Because she had boys...only\nboys. Four boys. And they belonged to the AK.\u2019 And I was going to find out that it's her\nmother, I wasn't so happy about it. I figured I'm afraid already, but I went. She took me\novernight. She put me in a hiding place...in a shed there. And the next day she came in and\nshe said to me...she cried for me. I could see her tears.\n\"I'm sorry that I have to tell you to leave.\" I says \"What, Mrs., we, we knew each other so\nmany years, you were a friend of ours. Why do you telling me to leave?\" She says \"Look.\nFirst of all, you know what's going on. If they find you, I'll be killed and my children will be\nkilled.\" So I said to her \"Why should they find me by you? You're near to the field. They\n* know (Yiddish)\n* Armia Krajowa (Home Army): One of the underground military organizations in occupied\nPoland; it existed from the fall of 1939 until January 1945.\ngoing around more, you know, inside the farms. Inside the people.\" She says \"My daughters\nhave boyfriends. German boyfriends. And they constantly by me. And they going around\nwith dogs.\" And that's what they did. They were going around with dogs to find Jewish\npeople. I went...I went away.",
        "A: I'm alone.",
        "A: No. He jumped and I jumped when we...we got right away separated. Because he was in...he\nwas in a different place. Not in a different place. He was like in the train by the end and I\nmaybe was in the middle. All I heard is \"Norma, leave. Jump. Run. Jump.\" But I imagine...\nbecause if he would be alive he would find me or he would let himself know where I am. He\nknew, where I coming and he knew where I am going. But I never found him. And that\nremained. I never found him.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTAPE #2",
        "A: I know that people are going to Treblinka.",
        "A: Because they started taking out Vengrov, when I was in Vengrov and then they went to\nSiedlce, and then they came\nback to Vengrov and they went back to Siedlce, I told you\nbefore, they kept going back and back.",
        "A: All the people from Vengrov, they went to Treblinka, which I\nknow. Then when I went to Siedlce they said they going to\nTreblinka too.",
        "A: People, people, people Jewish people find out where they\ngoing.",
        "A: Well you in contact with Jewish people...where you going,\nwhere this going...we going to Treblinka, we only know about\nTreblinka that time. I don't know if Auschwitz was later...",
        "A: There were some people left over. They were hiding. And they came back. I told you, they\ncame back to the city. Because they said also the same. People said, \"Oh, sizh shein\ngevorin.\u201d\u201d\u201d They took out the people is not coming back, but they still came back for the rest\nof them. They knew that people were hiding and they coming back to the house. They knew.\nThey were smart.\nTt happened already. (Yiddish)",
        "A: Like I said, we went in the train maybe towards the evening. Like four o'clock...something\nlike. It was no mind that time to keep minds of watches, of times or when you going or when\nyou coming. You didn't know what's doing with you. You went. But the only thing that I\nremember distinctly that it must have been about two o'clock midnight when we start\njumping because it took them time to work by the doors, to open them up. They had all kind\nof instruments to open up the doors. People in the train.",
        "A: Sure. They had...not in...I don't know if they were...they probably did not have guards in the\ntrain. But they had guards outside. They had like...they, maybe they stood on the steps on the\ntrain outside, you know. Because they kept on killing whoever jumped. Whoever they\ncaught jumping, they killed them right away, running out from the train.",
        "A: Probably, because otherwise I wouldn't be alive.",
        "A: What do I do? So I...I go to another farm. And I have another woman...a Polish woman...and\nI go to her. And I, I thought that one of my brothers was not a well man. And he knew...in\nthat place I went to, they had a farm. It wasn't really a farm...considered part of a farm. I\nknew that my brother is very familiar with that man. They had...he had a restaurant. He had a\nbig restaurant and he was a very rich man. And he killed a lot of pigs, you know, meat. He\nhad ...he was allowed to have liquor. But I knew also from that first woman from the farm I\nmet...what I told you...she told me that she knows from good sources that one of my brother\nis alive. And I...she told me the name so I knew that he's familiar with that man from the\nrestaurant. Maybe he knows something, and maybe I could find that brother of mine. That\nwas Christmastime. I don't remember it was a week before Christmas or a day before\nChristmas. This I don't know. But I know that I went there. Barefooted. In the snow in\nJanuary.",
        "A: '43.",
        "A: I went there. I came in...that was the city where we used to live. The farm where we used to\nlive but out of the farm, like on the field. I went there, I came in and there was a lot of\nGermans 1n the store. Not in the restaurant where they serve, but in the store. You know, to\norder something or buy something. And I also recognized somebody. One of my sisters...I\ndon't know if this is interested to you. One of my sister...a friend...1s there and I recognized\nhis wife. But when I came in to her, I didn't come in straight right to her. I couldn't go in\nbecause I had to go in through that store. From the restaurant...to the restaurant store. So I\ncouldn't because the Germans were sitting. It must have been about six o'clock. Dark...it was\ndark already.\nBut when I came in, there was a corridor with a big...you know, big doors to close that place.\nSo I went...1t was just like this. You see? The door...this is the door, and I'm here. It's closed\nhere. And I'm standing closed behind that door. Because I'm afraid to go into the store\nbecause the Germans are there. And I recognize that man, and I knew...she knew that he\ngave up Jewish people for a pound of sugar. That was a neighbor of ours. A best friend of\nmy sister's. While I was standing, standing here...I'll never forget that, that picture. While I'm\nstanding here, the owner's wife was passing by to the room where they served the people,\nyou know what I mean? And I...I don't know what to do. I'm shivering and I want, I want her\nto know that I'm here. So I said in Polish, \"Pani Pocinska (ph).\" And she recognized my\nvoice. After so many years we weren't there. Maybe for 10, 15 years, she recognized my\nvoice. She says, \"Norma?\" I says, \"Yes.\" She says, \"Shhh.\" So she went in and closed all the\nlights. The lights were supposed to be on, I think, only to eight or seven o'clock. I think until\nseven o'clock. To seven o'clock, I think the light was supposed to be only. She closed the\nlight in the store and she closed the light where the people were sitting and eating, where I\ntold you before, the, in the room. And she came back to me, she took me and she put me\nunder the bed. She was very good to us.",
        "A: I'm telling you, it wasn't allowed to have lights a certain time. A certain time. I think it was\nseven...seven or eight. No, it must be at...when it got dark, you, you weren't allowed to have\nlights.",
        "A: That's right. When it got dark on the streets, the...there was no lights on the street. I mean, the\ntime 1s when it gets dark so there weren't allowed to be lights. Not only in the restaurant, but\neven in the house you had to cover up the lights. Anyway, she took me in and pushed me in\nunder the bed...under her daughter's bed. She had that one daughter. And then when they\nwent away, she took me into the kitchen, where she gave me to eat. And I said to her,\n\"Where's your husband?\" And she says, \"My husband's not here.\" She knew that I wanna\nstay. I says, \"So where is he?\" She says he's...he produced his own, let's say...how to say it?\nThe Polish...the Polish food. Sausages, kielbasa...you know what kielbasa is? All kind of, of\nthis Polish meat preserves.\nShe, he did...he had a special place like where they don't cook it but they...they roast it or\nsomething, you know. They smoke it. They smoke it. They had a place where they smoking\nit. He had a separate place in the yard where he had a room and they smoked it. So she told\nme he's there with the workers. So she says, \"Why do you need him?\" I says, \"I would like\nto talk to Pan Pocinski (ph)\". Mr. Pocinski (ph). And she says, \"He'll be coming in late.\" I\nsays, When is he gonna finish?\" She says, \"Oh, about twelve, one o'clock.\" And I wanted\nto know from her. I figured if she'll tell me that anybody's living yet in Vengrov, maybe they\nwere hidden somewhere and now it's quiet, they came back. So I wanted to know if he know\nabout it...something. If he knows about it, maybe I'll go to Vengrov. Back. Coming\nfrom...jumping from Treblinka. Anyway, I waited and I asked her, \"Maybe you know\nsomething. I heard that a brother of mine, my brother, Fishel (ph)... he's in the picture...is\nalive.\" \"Maybe you know where he is.\" \"Oh, no, we don't know.\" She right away told me\nthis. \"We don't know; we never saw him.\" I said, \"Maybe Pan Pocinski (ph) know.\" Mr.\nPocinski (ph). She says, \"I doubt\" ...1n Polish...\"I doubt that he knows.\" She did...she...I don't\nknow. I think she was afraid of him, that maybe he wouldn't want me to know. You know\nwhat I mean? So anyway, that remained. I was there between seven and eight 'til about one\no'clock at night. By one o'clock he came in. Meanwhile, I ate and I kept on saying if\nnobody's alive for me...1f Mendel (ph) and Moishe (ph) and Schlomo (ph)... everybody went\nto Treblinka, they're not alive...what do I have to live? I have no money, I have no clothes on\nme. What do I have to live? Winter, cold, barefooted. I'm going to Vengrov. \"Oh,\" she says,\n\"they're going to kill you on the way.\" That's what she told me. \"They going to kill you on\nthe way, because they\"...they was...I read about place that they kept on hiding and looking\nfor Jews there. And on the way, you know, it was like woods. She says, \"You wouldn't go\nthere. They gonna kill you right away.\" And I kept on saying to her, \"So what am I\nsupposed to do?\" Make her notice that maybe she'll keep me. And meanwhile he came in,\none o'clock in the morning he came in. And the same thing, drink with him and this and that.\nSo I says, \"Look, I'm not in the mood. I ate. Your wife gave me to eat.\" And she put me in all\nkind of things in the pockets in the coat. But I had food to eat.\nShe thought maybe I will go. And he stopped me again. I said, \"Do you know where Fishel\n(ph) is?\" Fil (ph). He says, \"No, I don't know Fil (ph). I didn't see him since the war started.\"\nBut I heard a lot of rumors that he was...he was, in between the time that you could do some\nbusiness, he was afraid for the Polish money. That they gonna discontinue the Polish money,\nso he wanted the change for American dollars. So my brother used to change him. Come and\ntake the money, change them in the city for gold. Gold, gold pieces. American money.\nAmerican gold. So I had the idea that he does this with him and he knew, but he didn't want\nto admit to me. And I was afraid to tell him that. You saw him and he...you probably know\nabout him, maybe you heard about him. Everything went like, not noticing for sure, you\nknow what I mean? Finally, he gave in. But that, that picture, you should have seen it.\nFinally, he gave in. He says to me this way...he holds my hand and he says to me, \"You\nreally want to see him.\" You know, in Polish it has a little more meaning, more...more\npicture, you know what I mean? \"You really want to see him.\" And I said to him in Polish...1\nanswered him, \"Pan Pocinski (ph), do you think that that's the only one left, and I don't want\nto see him?\" He let my hand go. And he said, he said something to her which I don't\nremember even...it's like a wink, with the eyes. And he took me by the hand and he takes me\nin that room where it was the dining room. Where the people used to eat. And on the way\ngoing to him, I had to go through that place, the corridor where I was hidden behind the\ndoor. The door from the first coming in. And he said to me on the way, \"Don't tell me that\nyou want to be with him.\" So and...that tell me that maybe he has a small place somewhere\nhe is hiding him and he can't make the place bigger for somebody else, or something. But I\nknew in me that he wouldn't let me go. He took me in and my brother was laying on the\nfloor. A little pillow and a little stool with a little blanket to cover himself up. He was\nsleeping. He said...he woke him up. He woke him up and he noticed that he's worse.\nSo I remember distinctly what he said to him. \"What's the matter, they by you?\" In Polish.\nThat means that the Germans came into him in the middle of the night. You know what I\nmean? He was doing things where he wasn't allowed to do and my brother knew it. He was\nkilling too much pigs. He was, he had rationing...he had tickets, so much he's allowed to kill.\nBut he was doing more. And my brother knew about it and everybody knew that he's killing\ntoo much in the place. Anyway, so he woke him up and my brother said to him he probably\nknew that maybe it was before I came also the same story...somebody...he came in and woke\nhim up and he threw him. He made in the corner of the room...he took out four boards and he\nmade a tunnel. He was outside constantly. Like during the daytime, and he slept outside.\nYou know, in the room. But God forbid if they came in, if he knew that they here and maybe\nthey'll come in, he shoveled him 1n, in that tunnel. You know, he made that tunnel there and\nhe covered our back with the boards, he didn't make the boards separate, he made like a door\nfrom the boards. And on the, on the door was a machine, a Singer's machine, a sewing\nmachine to demonstrate that nothing is there, you know what I mean? So he pushed him in\nthere. So that's why he asked him, \"What's the matter, they here?\" My brother asked him,\n\"What's the matter, they here?\" He says, \"No, your sister is here.\" He was, you know, sleepy\nand he didn't know...he couldn't believe, because the train who went to Treblinka with those\npeople from Siedlce the second time wasn't too far. They went in...they went through our,\nour farm. So he knew that it was another train going into Treblinka. So he was very scared.\nHe didn't know what happened. A sister surviving yet, from that train? Well, anyway, I was\nthere the rest of the couple of hours was still dark, the nighttime. And then he came in about\nnine o'clock in the morning and he said to me, \"So what do you intend to do, Norma? Your\nbrother is gonna stay here. I would not throw him out. What's gonna be with you?\"\nAnd I'm speechless. What can I tell him? I says, \"Look, Pan Pocinski (ph), whatever you\ndecide is good with me.\" That means whatever he wants to do with me, let him do. I'm in his\nhands now. I can't go to Vengrov and I can't stay here, so what am I gonna do? He wants to\nkill me, let him kill me. He says, \"Look, I'll take in more shovels, we make the tunnel bigger\nand you stay with your brother as long as I'm alive.\" And that was that. But being...I told you\nin the beginning, my brother was a sick man. He got sick because he was...right in the\nbeginning he was in the woods and he got sick on the kidneys. So he says, \"You gonna stay\ntogether with him as long as I live and as long as I can do something for you.\" Because he\nwas very friendly with our family and that's it. So they went...we stay in there for about four\nmonths together with my brother. If anything happens, we went into that bunker. Took off\nthe machine and then we went in and put back the machine on.",
        "A: In the daytime, we were out. We were in the, in the room.",
        "A: Well, what kind of work? We were sitting and looking out. The windows was closed with\nthick curtains that the outside shouldn't, we saw outside, but the outside couldn't see us, you\nknow. So we were sitting and watching, we were reading, my brother was praying. We had\npraying book. I remember like now that it was before Passover, because that everything\nhappens in the winter time. She said to my brother, \"I know that it's the meaning, you have to\neat matzo. You're not allowed to eat bread.\" You know what I mean. So she, they had a\noven, so she had...she made the oven and she gave him flour. And I made the dough and we\nbaked matzos. We baked a couple, a couple pound, about five pound flour. The meaning\nfrom the matzo, for Passover. And then my brother got worse and worse. And I don't know if\nI should tell you that she wanted...they wanted to save us. They wanted so much to save us.\nWhen he got very, very sick already, she went away to Sokolow...that's nearer than\nSiedIce...to a city which she had a doctor. Very, you know ...probably everybody who has a\ndoctor is very close to the doctor. And she said a lie to him, to the doctor, that my\nbrother...\"My father is such a sick man that I can't even bring him to you.\"\nBut I...she took a bottle of his phena (ph) medication, prescription, and she said, \"I want that\nprescription again. They don't want to give me no medications from that prescription because\nit's already overdue.\" The time, you know, when the prescription ...like six months later, or\nwhatever later. And the doctor was supposed...that's what she told us. The doctor said, \"You\ndon't have a, a father. Your father's not sick. You having a Jew there.\" And while he said\nthere that you have a Jew, she escaped from him. And she came back home and she told us\nthis. She told me, not him. And a couple weeks later, he died. And I buried him. I don't know\nif he's still there, but I buried him with my bare hands. He made the cave. He made the cave,\nand I buried him, my brother, there. That was a orchard behind the, the building. Behind the\nhouse was a orchard. So I don't know this, but she told me this story that they asked him, \"In\ncase something happens, where do you want to be buried?\" So he told them, \"Bury me\nunder that and that tree, a pear tree.\" So that was the pear tree where he was buried. I used to\ngo there.",
        "A: Now I'm all alone and I have nobody in Vengrov. Meanwhile, in between that time, they\ntook out my two brothers. Two brothers were remained with...they had those business that I\ntold you. They kept him such a long time. They had to teach him the business. They taught\nhim the business and they took out everything, all the letters, all the valuable things and the\nmachines, and they took them to Treblinka. The reason why I'm telling you this, that then I\nheard when that man was working there by the glasses, what I mention before, my husband\nsaid it's not true. What he have to... what was pushing him to say that he said that he wants\nthose two people to help him because it's too much work for him? He was sorting the glasses\nthat the people took off, like my husband told you, that everything went 1n place, pants and\nunderwear, that's separate. And this separate, and glasses separate, whatever gold separate.\nEverything went separates places.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. So anyway, that's what I heard. He told me, that man who died, Reizman (ph), that he\nwent over to somebody, the highest rank, and he told them that Moishe (ph) and Mendel (ph)\nis here, and I would like maybe you could give him help, because it's too much for me to do.\nAnd it's a lot of people came in there and a lot of people wearing glasses, so maybe they\ncould help me. So they put him the same day in the fire. So that's what I know, I know while\nI was running around from one place to the other that Mendel (ph) and Moishe (ph) is not\nalive. And I have nobody. And that was the, the thing. But I also then find out...in, in that\ntown I live through the...I was there 'til the last minute we got liberated.",
        "A: At this restaurant, I was there. I was there 'til I got liberated. But when I got liberated, I went\nto Vengrov.",
        "A: About a year. Maybe more. Like I told you before, it was no time, not time, time we had\nplenty. We didn't have a lot to do with ourselves. But was nothing in the mind to remember\nwhat day it 1s and what time it is or what month it is. Who was thinking about it? We were\nwant that the day should go faster, maybe we'll live through this, this trouble.",
        "A: I was liberated by Russians. When I went away to Siedlce and when everything finished and\nthe war finished, I went back to Vengrov.",
        "A: No, no. I was in the woods, like I said, again...",
        "A: I went away from there to Vengrov near...there was near woods there. So I was there. But\nstill the Russians, Germans were there.",
        "A: I was staying in that house 'til the liberation, 'til the Germans left. It was still Germans, and\nwe were still afraid of them. The Germans were there and the Russians start to come in.\nBut I went in, in the woods, and from the woods I went in somebody what I knew to also\nwhere they live in a farm there, their own farm. And he went out, there was shooting around\nright away. The Russians were shooting to the Germans and the Germans were shooting to\nthe Russians the airplanes were running. So one fellow came in, a young man came in and\nhe kept on yelling, \"The Russians are coming. The Russians are coming.\" So I jumped out\nfrom the (undecipherable), where the Russians are. That the Russians...we liberated, the\nRussians are coming. They took it over. Meanwhile, I was shot.",
        "A: By the Russians.",
        "A: Unintentionally. Of course. Because I was running where the Russians.",
        "A: They were afraid. And I was...I can't say that I, I felt that, that maybe they gonna be killed or\nsomething, but I couldn't have in me that because of me they should be killed. They wanted\nthe good for me and for my brother. Why should they be killed because of me? They killed\nthem anyway. They killed them anyway...her and him. One day they came in, they came in\nto eat breakfast at the restaurant and they served them and when they went to the buffet to\npay, they ask how much they want. And they told him how much he want...the bill is. They\ntook out the gun, they killed them both. The daughter was in the church, so she remained\nalive. She's still alive, probably.",

        "A: By the...when the...we went out, like I said. We went out to look at the Russians and the\nGermans are fighting in the air. They shooting. So we went out to look, we wanted that the\nRussians should come 1n because we knew that that's the way it's gonna finish and maybe\nwe'll be liberated. So while we were running around outside, I got shot here. I don't know if\nit's still there, because it's a long time. It wasn't a big wound. It healed itself. And that...I\nnever found my husband.

        "A: After I was liberated, I was hiding by, hiding by, before we were liberated and I went away\nto that good friend of ours, we were a month in a shack where they keeping...how do they\nsay hay in English? Hay? Do you know what hay means? What they feeding the horses and\nthe cows. They take out...the grass dries out and they, they put it back in the shack. They\nhave it for the winter for the cows and the horses. So we went into...one place the farmer\ndidn't know that we were there, we hiding there. But then he find us and he kept us for a little\nwhile. We paid him. When my brother died, he had gold pieces, which he was supposed to\ngive to him, you know, like I said. Changing the money. So of course I had it with me. So we\nwent in...I met...as a matter of fact, not that I met. That same woman, she was a good and\nvery friendly to us...with the two daughters...the first one. She told me that there was some\nboys in this-and this-city going around the...you know, people used to go around at night and\nbeg for bread or potato or something. So they probably used to come to her, too. She knew\nthem. They weren't too far from her living. So she told me that if you want, I could tell those\nboys...there's one woman with them in Siedlce with a husband...so maybe you could connect\nwith them and not being alone. So I was a couple of months with them, before the liberation.\nSo that's what I know her, she was, she was so good. They were afraid for themself and I\ndon't blame them.",
        "A: After I was liberated, the next day I went to Vengrov.",
        "A: Coming in, coming into the city, I met a man. I didn't recognize him. I know him, because he\nwas a customer by my brother's.

You had to be careful with everything, you\nunderstand this. But I asked him, \"Where? Where is she?\" So he told us that he heard...he\ndidn't want to say that he knows for sure...he heard that she's with this-and-this people which\nthey used to live in the same section where my brother lived. So my brother gave away the\nrest what he possessed, with some money probably, I'm sure of it. Because they wouldn't\nkeep that money, that he should save that daughter. The sons were killed in Treblinka, two\nsons. So they kept her and she's alive. The reason why she is alive is, when I got connected\nwith my sister, I told her that my brother Mendel's (ph) daughter is alive and she...",
        "A: In America, sure. I didn't have another sister. And here in this country they had clubs, or\nwhatever they call it, where they used to go out...what do you call it? I forgot how to call it.\nThey had people where they, they used to take out people...Polish...take out children from\nPolish people. You probably heard about it, right? Did you? No, you were too young to hear\nabout it. They used to have, you know, agencies where they used to go out to Europe to take\nout Jewish children from Polish people, where they survived there. So my sister find out,\nwhile she knew that her brother's, that my brother's child is alive, the daughter, she knew\nabout it. And they had somebody who, he was a little bit macher.'' You know, to go to\nEurope to take out the children from Polish people. So he got in touch with them. My sister\nthen got in touch with them, through him and they took her away from her. They went there\nprobably with an airplane. Otherwise, they didn't go, they didn't have any other\ncommunications to go to Europe, from America to Europe. They came with an airplane and\nthey...she didn't want to give it to her, give away to her. She had one daughter, too, that\nwoman. The Polish woman. So she said...she didn't have even an idea what a dollar is ...how\nmuch a dollar is. So she said she wants thousand dollar. Thousand dollar, she wants thousand\ndollars so they gave her thousand dollars. She said thousand dollars, they gave her thousand\ndollars. The, the girl, the daughter, took care on that...on my niece. I showed her to you, my\nniece. So while they took...and they took her first probably, they knew how to go on with\nthis.\nThey took her first on the plane and they ran away. So she was acquainted with a lot of\nGermans. She used to live with a lot of Germans, you know.

They\n'' someone who arranges things, has connections (Yiddish)\nhere.\" And they were in the leather business. Just the leather business they were handling. So\nI figured, cousins. They say that I'm a cousin. So I'll try to go in there. So I went in there and\nwe were cousins. But I was like a maid to them. I had to wash, I had to cook, I had to clean\nto have food.
