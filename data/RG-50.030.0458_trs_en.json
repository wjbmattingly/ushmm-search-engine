        "Question: This is United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ginetta Sagan,\nconducted by Joan Ringleheim, on September 23\", in Atherton, California, in the home of\nGinetta Sagan, and this is tape number one, side A. Good morning, Ginetta.",
        "Answer: Good morning, Joan, and thank you for coming and doing this.",
        "Q: Thank you, thank you for having us here -- thank you for having me, I\u2019m not an us.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Can you first just tell us when and where you were born? Let\u2019s stop -- we -- I just heard the --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Right, Ginetta, te -- can you give us your official date of birth, and where you were born?\nYes, I was born in -- near Milan, in a little place called San Columbano Olumbro, little f-fatsioni\nof Milan, now it\u2019s a little village, on June first, 1923.",
        "Q: And can you tell us something about the life that you led before you got into the Resistance?\nYo -- I know that it was a rather complicated and interesting time for you.",
        "A: It was complicated, and at some level, it was also a good life. And one of our circle of frien --\nthe circle of friend, the most important thing was the circle of friends we had, all anti-Fascist,\nand all active in assisting people who had been persecuted by the Fascist party. Yes, Jewish, but\nthe Fascist party was also persecuting people who were anti-Fascist. It just happened that many\nof the anti-Fascist were also intellectual, and intellectual are more likely to be critical. Until\n1938, it wasn\u2019t too difficult. Then, when the Nazi law were adopted by Mussolini, in Italy, there\nwas a great deal of criticism about Mussolini doing that. And yet, the discussion I vaguely\nremember, in our circle of friends, particularly when we went to the mountains, climbed everythi\n-- if it was a day, that it was not very clear, they talked, they talked, they talked about political\nissues, social issues, anti-Fascist persecution. The general atmosphere was that even some\nintellectual had signed some paper approving of Mussolini adopting the Nazi racial law, and that\nwas 1938, so I was pretty young, and to be very honest with you, there were times when I were --\nyes, I was interested, but I wanted to climb, I wanted to hike, I wanted to sing, I wanted to have a\ngood time. I was touched by it. At the same time, I also wanted to have a good time, going to\nlook for ackenberry, for example, in August, and have ackenberry pies, and for -- in the refuge,\nand -- or rather, I have never forgotten that the criticism of the Nazi law was not only done by\neducated people, but there were also a farmer who taught 1-11 pladoni, Mussolini didn\u2019t have\nmuch hair, so they called him il pladoni, he is crazy. He is doing -- you know, why is he doing\nthis, why is he going after the Jews, wh-why is he doing that? And then, in the discussions, and\nas I said, I heard not only within my family, but also in my -- the circle of friends, who were\npersonal friends, all interested in mountain climbing, all interested in going to refugi for hikes.\nNear the lake of Como, there were mountains called Laigreenai, and there were refuges where\nwe went, and we had to carry our food in the back. Ex -- there were some supplies left there,\nbrought by donkey, like polenta, rice, potatoes. But -- and the farmer would have milk, a --\netcetera. And then we would hike, and then the discussions. Yes, there was discussion of movies,\nthere was discussion of theater, there was discussion of opera. There were discussion of work in\nthe factories. There -- but also, there were always political discussions, and invariably, we found\n-- at least I experienced the fact that people had joined the Fascist party because they had to\nwork. Tha -- they were very few who would disagree, and -- and there were big discussions.\n\u201cHey, you stupido, cretino, that you believe in these idiotesa, that is -- we don\u2019t like the\nGerman.\u201d Well, I didn\u2019t like when they said, \u201cI don\u2019t like the German,\u201d generally. I made -- and\nmy parents taught me, and my friend taught me, then -- there has to be a distinction between the\npro-Nazi and the German. And, there was a discussions, very early, about the fact that some\nGerman people, yes, they were Communist, and Socialist, but they were also member of the\nupper class. And some bishops, who, when Hitler began the persecution of the Jewish -- the anti-\nFascist -- anti -- there were Communists, Socialists, and Jews. And it just happened that many\nintellectual were also Jewish. At that time -- I was very young, but I remember the heated\ndiscussions about Hitler, as announced in the press, that he has opened a concentration camp, to\nput those people in. It was very difficult for young people to understand what it meant. The --\nsome of the friends that I had, who were older, mature, and who -- and my parents, they were\naware of the Fascist party having a special tribunal, 1-1 -- where the Fascist didn\u2019t have courts of\nlaw for those anti-Fascist, anti-Nazi -- f -- in Italy, was anti-Fascist, but you understand, then,\nthey were against both. And instead of a court of law, with judges, which of course many of the f\n-- the Fascist had nominated those people, but nevertheless, the special tribunal could\ncondemned anyone, that when that person -- and there were women, too, became quote, suspect,\nthe special tribunal had the special Italian Secret Police, called Ovra, O-v-r-a, to investigate the\nsuspect. And I remember one particular day, when they were discussing this, we couldn\u2019t go up\nclimbing, we couldn\u2019t go hiking, it was raining, and -- and they were discussing all this -- I\nmean, it sounds s-strange thing, that this suspect could be man or the woman, and then the Ovra\ncould pull in, for interrogation, the baker, the priest, the butcher, friends, associates of the work,\nwhether they were engineer, or doctor, or [indecipherable] and, I remember that they were\ntalking about some people were killed, executed. Some people were sent to what was known --\noh, some people to San Vittory prison, something, somebody sent to remote area in Italy, where\nthese people who were intellectual, writer, artist, doctor or lawyer, could not see the family,\nexcept maybe once a year, twice a year, I can\u2019t remember correctly. But they were deprived of\nthe mail, very rarely they could have the mail. They could only receive visits from the family\nvery rarely. In other word, they were denied everything, and whether they were imprisoned in\nSan Vittory, or sent to these remote area, there was the attempt to isolate them from society,\ndeprive them of their professional life, their French -- their family, their friends. And the special\ntribunal had the power to do that, in Italy. But the German, apparently, were doing the same, and\nagain I didn\u2019t understand very clearly, except in Dachau was a place, after 1933, where priest,\nSocialists, Communists, intellectual, could be sent, and the judicial system -- and they talk about\nthe judicial system being damaged. The SS, and the Gestapo took over the function. That meant\nthat it became very arbitrary, also. And I also remember that both in Italy, and I mention, in\nGermany, if some big Fascist liked a woman, sometime they had the man investigated, so -- you\nknow, in other word, an arbitrary, unjust, terribly painful process for the fellow. Now, that\npicture of the special tribunal, those memory of San Vittory, the exiled, 1t remained with me\nforever, for as long as I remember. But at the same time, we -- there was a great deal of joy.\nThere was country, the -- the hikes in the mountains, seldom we went to the sea. Occasionally we\nwent to a place called Paylee, and I learned how to watch the farm -- the fisherman to bring in\nthe fresh fish, and -- and have a meal with them, they made the mayonnaise with the garlic, and\nthe parsley, and I wasn\u2019t cooking at that time, but I watched them there, enjoyed the French\neating, but mountains were the [indecipherable]. Short weekend was [indecipherable]. And, in\naddition to climbing, and we met -- we knew the Pastore, who had this wonderful bitar and then\nthe cow, and they made the fresh cheese, and there was be -- song, in spite of the difficulty. Now,\nthe people --",
        "Q: It was what? I didn\u2019t --",
        "A: Difficulties, in spite of the difficulties --",
        "Q: There was?",
        "A: -- there was joy.",
        "Q: Joy.",
        "A: And the mountain club, the Italian mountain club, was a social equalizer. There were\nintellectual, very wealthy people. Papa Bolla was the president of the Italian mountain club, the\nwhole family, Leala, Rico. He was a businessman. The Sturani -- nobility, Count and Countess\nSturani, and then the worker from the factories. There were engineer, there were geometry\nimpligati clerks. And, of course, we met th-the wifes, and the children participate. In fact, in one\nparticular refuge Pialeral, we built it. And we had to maintain it, and you had to walk, after you\narrived with funicular above Como, you had to walk for four hours carrying your knapsack, and\nas I said, in summer they had donkey that they brought durable goods. But otherwise, y -- and\nthen you just roam around, and in winter it was skiing, but not the skiing of today, where you go\nup and down, up and down, can\u2019t stand that. Th -- the skiing was for sightseeing, for enjoy --\nnow, non-vacation was different. Then, we went to -- went to Nash, we went to Cherbania, and\nthere was one funicular at that time, and we went up to anolder tel colostum becko, and that\nagain was a reunion place. Summer was hiking all over, climbing. And I began climbing with my\nparents and guides. They were very strict about guides. You don\u2019t go up in the mountains\nunprepared, because the mountains, like the sea is very harsh, can be very difficult, so you have\nto be prepared. And then we refuge.",
        "Q: What does that -- what does that mean, refuge?",
        "A: Refuge -- refuge? Well, huts where you bring your supply. You melt the snow with Sterno, to\nmake [inaudible], and you bring dry fruits, and a pinyotta. Pinyotta are dry cracker, but very hard\non your teeth, you better have good teeth, or else you are 1n trouble. And, of course, the first day\nor so, you have fresh fruit also, but -- and, for the first day or two, you have slice of rosto\npolarose, but then you drive everything, and whatever. It was fun, it was climbing, it was hiki --\n1-1 -- picotsa, if there was a snow, you use the ice pick, as -- la picotsa, I think. You had the\nscarponi, and so you go to refuge -- let\u2019s take an example, from Shamoni, this was not -- this was\nShamoni, you go to -- by train to Ajohntierre. Ajohntierre you start hiking, I remember cutting it,\nsta -- to your refuge, le refuge de Ajohntierre, and you spend the night there, and the -- often the\nrefuge can offer polenta, or zupa -- soup, or polenta, occasionally risotto, but really polenta is\nmore [indecipherable]. Also, they made, f-fontina [indecipherable], fontina toma. So polenta was\nfontina toma, all fresh, goat cheese, or fresh whatever there was. And you spent the night. And\nit\u2019s wonderful because there is a camaraderie, I think is the word. Easy. Young people talk, talk\nabout theaters and movie, talk about the love, talk about this, talk about that. The serious people\ntalk about -- yes, some politics, or is -- Italian are very yeah, yeah, yeah, talk politics great deal.\nBut, also talk about traveling, talk about culture, talking about booksa, talking about history,\ntalking about the meaning of some opera, for example. And I remember in -- in Ajohntierre,\nwe're talking about a performance in Paris of Don Carlos, and how Verdi had a -- really used\nopera to express the essence of repression, a religious repression. The burning, the -- and then\nthere were discussion over -- on religion, for example, because at that time, Voltaire was a\nprohibited author by the church. So needless to say, we talk about Voltaire, and -- and also, the\npress was controlled. I must confess that at that time, I was far more interested in boys and girls,\nI was far more interested in the mountains, far more interested in having fun, and I had a good\nfriend at that time, that I knew when I was seven, and he was 11, and he -- I heard all this, and I\npaid some attentions, but I must confess that my attention at that time, when I was so young, was\nin the mountains, in the fu -- wildflower. I was crazy about wildflower, I -- I -- we went, as\nfamily and friends, to do le narche zarta, which meant we went to the refuge, and then we picked,\nvery carefully, a bouquet of -- it\u2019s daffodil-like, but white with a little red, little eye, and very\nperfume, not cheesy. And you are taught conservation from day one. And again, in the\nmountains you talk about planning. Let\u2019s go for a narche zarta in Como next spring. We take the\npicnic, we go. Some people work for Las meerbiscoza for factories. What we discovered -- and\nwhile we were talking about fun in mountain, there was a great deal of politics all the time. Now,\nthe best, active people, at the political level, were Socialist, and Communist. Anti-Fascist, many\nof them. And being Communist, but after having been in the prison of Mussolini with the\nCommunists, they changed. They followed the lead of two people, that I didn\u2019t know, and I be --\nwho started a movement called jostitsia en liberta, the Rosselli brother. And they were talking\nabout the Rosselli brother as having taught them how common -- hard line Communism of the\nStalinist-Leninist type was as dangerous as Nazi Fascist, and therefore they wanted, yes,\nSocialism, yes, a just society, due process of law. That was taught by lawyer, like Enrico Enpigi\nall the time, Contamessa -- Rainso Contamessa. Due process of law, fair trial, and then -- and no\nmilitary judges, like the special tribunal. So there was this combination of hat -- la -- Ajohntierre\nwas one. And then we went home sometime for two weeks, from refuge to refuge, refuge to\nrefuge, and guides, always guides. But you have the leisure of enjoying something very much,\nwith a diversified company, from student, and young children, to factory worker, engineer,\nlawyer, professor, doctors, a-academic, some very serious were very angry about the\nacademician who had signed the Nazi manifesto for 1938 duration of Mussolini. And all in good\nhumor, even those who were accused of being -- you are a damn fa -- you are an Fascist stonase,\nc\u2019est une cretino, c\u2019est qui -- the next day we climbed together, we ate together, we -- you know,\nit was not vindictive, it was not nasty -- yes, there were bursts of recrimination, but it didn\u2019t\nbecome so sickening that hate, a -- hate --",
        "Q: Wh-Why do you think that was so?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, to these days. Perhaps that question should be given to psychiatrists, or other. I\nbelieve then the Italian culture, with so many occupation, for centuries, by so many countries --\nyou know, remember in Sicily, the Swedes were there. In fact, there was a beautiful poem called,\n\u201cCurradino dis vetsia.\u201d And I have never forgotten a small part of that poem. The poem referred\nto a mother, 1n switzer -- in -- in swede -- in sw -- in Sweden. You see, in springtime, a swallow\nreturn, and the mother ask the swallow what coming -- was coming from ita -- from the south,\n\u201cDimi iveesto il filio meo,\u201d Tell me, have you seen my son, who was sent to fight in Sicily? And\nthe swallow answered, \u201cSi, no veesto, erabuendo, erabianco, sotolarko diontempio era\nsaipporto.\u201d Yes, I saw him. He was blonde, he was white, under the arch of a temple he was\nburied. And I remember the discussions around that poem, and I\u2019ve always remembered that\npoem because it emphasized the commonality of human being, but here it was from Sweden\ninvading Sicily, and then of course, we had the Berber invading, and the French, and the\nAustrian invasions. And each invader brought destructions, pain, suffering, but also the need for\nsome people to get together and help each other. And I have a feeling that that common bondage\nof seeing so much suffering, and [indecipherable] destruction the pope\u2019s rector, in Italy one must\n-- I mean, there were powers, and corrupt, and -- so ou -- in one sense you were devout Catholic,\nwent to church, you practice. You had also many skeptics, and the selling of the images, and all\nthose things, were discussed, I mean, they talked about everything. The mountains was a\nteaching place, because of the situation that here you are up in a refuge, and you\u2019re having your\ntime, but I don\u2019t [indecipherable] leisure to talk and think. Not that I understood very well\neverything, far from it. But it\u2019s amazing how later things seems to connect. And I remember\nwhen they were talking about the special tribunal, the prisoner in San Vittory, the persecution of\nthe family. The injustice of having a judicial system with three military judges who had the\npower to bring in everybody to 1 -- to interrogate, intimidate, frighten friends, family, butcher,\nmaid, you name it. And I thought, how can they do that? And yet, there was the other side of\nhelper all the time.",
        "Q: Helper?",
        "A: Helpers, all the time in San Vittory, which was a prison for criminal, and for political\nprisoners. And the political prisoner, I think Grandshe may have also been there, they had a great\ndeal of help from the suaray. First of all, the sister were there, the doctors. And the suaray play, a\n-- were nurses at the time. And inside -- and these were people hired by the Fascist party, but we\nalways found people -- the bakers, God bless the bakers -- we always found people who could\nhelp. I have the feeling, listening from the discussion, from my parents, from Enrico\n[indecipherable], all those people, that in Italy, it was easier to help than it was possible to do in\naust -- in Germany. In -- 1-in Nazi Germany, they in fact, destroyed all of the antique -- Nazi --\nmuch more easily than they could in Italy, and I think it may have to do something -- but again,\nI\u2019m not a historian, I\u2019m a re -- an ordinary woman. My feeling, listening to the other, was that the\nGerman were cultured, music, but also disciplinarian. And they treated children with 11\nmaganello, with a stick, as they grew up. And therefore, that could have had an influence in the\nrigidity of behavior of that particular -- of -- of the German, that although there was resistance by\nsome in the church, by intellectual, like Bunoffer, but, in the resistance had networks, mostly of\nCommunists, and Socialists. They were wiped out. They didn\u2019t have the support than their\ncounterpart in Italy had from the general population. And we split, within the church.",
        "Q: Could -- could you just give -- give me a sense of your education beyond the more --\nsomewhat more formal education, because I think it\u2019s very interesting that you had such a wide\nand cultured education at a very young age, and it seems to me it must have influenced you as\nwell.",
        "A: Well, first I had to work very hard, and studying. It\u2019s okay to have fun, but you study. And I\nhad a -- oh, for two years, when we lived in this place, which was called Santangelo de Jarno, I\nhad -- and I lived with a family -- my family, but als -- came very often, but I also had this\nwonderful family who was Istytotwiss. And yes, I went to school in the elementary year, and I\nhad marvelous teacher. Her name was Bentivania Lucia, and then she married a man whose\nname was Negrini. And I think they were anti-Fascist, but in school, the subject, history, writing,\nreading, she was very good, and just marvelous. She would inspire her student to do the best.\nStill, when we had to do the essay, we had to praise Mussolini, and -- and she did that with a\nwooden face. So we had to write our essay, how wonderful Mussolini was, and then in, I believe\nwas \u201835, but you should check, when he went to Ethiopia, there was a horror in my -- all our\ncircle about Mussolini invading Abyssinia, was called at that time, dropping poison. And the\nDuca da Oustar, a family wi -- a -- being there too, I mean, there was a tremendous dispute.\nMussolini, of course, wanted an empair -- em-em-em-empire. The king went along with it, that\nidiot -- excuse the expression. If I understood correctly, the queen -- the wife was absolutely\nopposed to Mussolini, to his enterprise. She was born in Montenegro, Elena, and was a -- from\nwhat I\u2019ve heard --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: Tape one, side B. I\u2019m sorry Ginetta.",
        "A: That\u2019s okay. Now, in [indecipherable] circle of friends, the rutsini -- the rutsini\n[indecipherable] rutsini were the parents of Mary Mullisanno. Mary Mullisanno was married to\nEnrico Mullisanno. Enrico Mullisanno\u2019s brother was Pigi Mullisanno, who was married to a\nwonderful woman called Marcella. Now, the rutsini were from monarchy, the Mullisanno were\nanti-Fascist, anti-king, 1s an idiot. But also they were praising his wife for her intelligence, for\ntraining her children to be useful in society, and not just idiots. In other word, they felt very\nstrongly that -- the Mullisanno -- that the king was not worth anything. I mean, yeah -- yeah, he\nwas -- he went along with Mussolini, and critical, went along with signing the law, went along\ngoing to Abyssinia, went along with everything, and eventually went along with Mussolini\nbecoming allies of the German, and al -- went along when Mussolini invaded France in 1940,\nand throughout that, while the rutsini always defended the king, and bi -- praising the queen, of\ncourse, and the children, etcetera. The Mullisanno said, the king goes along with Mussolini, so\nhe\u2019s equally responsible, and -- and ya -- that -- that kind of -- so, it was a fairment of ideas.\nThe essay we did in school had to reflect acceptance of Mussolini party line. And it was obvious\nthat the teacher was very skeptical, but she had to do it. [indecipherable]. Then when I went\nhome, I had to redo the whole damn thing -- excuse the expression. You know, Is -- what did\nyou do today? And I said, well that\u2019s what we did, that Mussolini went to Abyssinia to re-\nvindicate the destiny of Italy, I mean all that rhetoric, pretending the Fasci romani as if he had\nbecome -- a-and naming the king eventually, when the war was over, and [indecipherable] it was\nsuch a -- such a awful thing, that I was -- I learned that all this parade was -- was a charade, and\nalthough you couldn\u2019t speak in public, among friend, that was discussed all the time.",
        "Q: But your parents then -- then asked you to rewrite your essay?",
        "A: Yup. So, you can see -- then, meanwhile I also had to learn in French, I had to -- but -- and\nthere were wonderful travels. Paris was a place, and -- and I\u2019m glad I learned French. History\nwas very important, literature was very important, and victory go -- Montaigne, Monsieur\nMontaigne, wi -- Pascal. I am glad I did, as well as Italian literature, as well as Italian poetry, like\nDant\u00e9, an old Italian. I-I am glad I did. I didn\u2019t understand as fully as my parents thought that I\nshould. Who can understand Dostoyevsky when you are so young? You know, the\n[indecipherable]. But, I read them, and they always said, \u201cOne day, when you are 40, you will\nhave to reread them all over again.\u201d But meanwhile, I di -- I had to do it, and history was\nimportant, literature was important, and the Greek, as well as the Roman. The lives -- Plutark\u2019s\nlives of the Greek, and the Roman. And that was becan -- but that was also discussed among the\npeople with who -- if we are stuck in the refuge one day, or discuss Cicero, [indecipherable] that\nwas part of growing up, somehow, and -- and looking back, it was a good education. Looking at\nwhat my children got in the school in Atherton, California, and before, they don\u2019t have\neducation. They don\u2019t have history, except some minor history. American history, which is very\nimportant, they should study more. I\u2019m -- we -- in other word, I could only understand how\nfortunate I was, how rich our -- and I\u2019m talking about ours, not just my -- they gives you, in spite\nof Fascism, in spite of a dictatorship, in spite of the war, they give you a -- a -- a little richer\nbackground to understand lives, to understand other country, to understand other culture, to\nunderstand politics. And -- and I guess from that respect, I felt I was a fortunate woman -- now, I\nmean, in the last 15 - 20 years, I understood what a fortunate person I -- I have been, too. So, the\nlife in -- in Italy was a happy one, until really the war started -- the -- \u201938 was the beginning of\ndifficulties.",
        "Q: Can you describe that -- that change in some way\u201d?",
        "A: Well, the first thing was that you have to be very careful never to say anything, and it\u2019s kind\nof hiding, without hiding. And you know, you have to be careful only with your friend, don\u2019t say\nanything to anybody else, don\u2019t discuss politics, don\u2019t discuss the racial law, don\u2019t discuss\nanything about the fact that the Jewish people now are discriminated against, they cannot go to\nthe library, they cannot go to -- t-to -- in certain profession they are removed from the profession.\nPeople could not practice medicine or law, and -- and the Jewish children could not go to the\nlibrary, or to the regular school. Can you imagine if you are going to a regular school in this\ncountry, and you are told sometime very nicely, sometime by people who felt pain in saying that,\nand sometime not so nicely, but you cannot come back? And then children taunt -- tau -- te --\nyou know, mock other children, who are Jewish, but not as many as I learned was happening in\nFrance, or other country, and that I learned it from other people. Because in Italy, there was this\nmockery, but not mean, mean, mean, except by the Fascist, and there were not so bi -- so many\nwhich are vehement about the issue. So Italy had a -- had had an integration of the Jewish people\nwith Italian, lots of intermarriage. Nobody thought about that until Mussolini did that in 1938.",
        "Q: But Mussolini was in power in 1922.",
        "A: \u00b022.",
        "Q: So \u201938 changed something quite radically.",
        "A: Oh, absolutely.",
        "Q: And was that the racial laws that made the change?",
        "A: The racial law, yes, I think so. I think when Mussolini adopted the racial law, 1t was a turmoil\nwithin the society, and also the special tribunal, the political pers-persecution. In the jail, in San\nVittory, and in the confini -- confini are those people -- those places where people were sent, and\nI remember my parents, my friends saying, imagine if you\u2019re a doctor, a lawyer, a philosopher, a\nsociolo -- an intellectual. Also well as a worker who is organizing for the Communist party, or\nthe Socialist party. They didn\u2019t persecute the [indecipherable] party, not very much. But those\npeople are deprived of all contact, family, friends, reading. I mean, those people read newspaper,\nrepublication, often they w -- spoke other language, like English, and French, and others.\nImagine being deprived of everything? And be isolated, and you haven\u2019t done anything wrong,\nyou\u2019re innocent. And then when the special tribunal even sentenced people to death. And there\nwere women, also, who had been condemned to that. Now, some women, I understood -- and\nagain, one should do research on that -- I understood that some women were sent south, a-and\nthey -- sometime they were hired by well-to-do family, as maid. But they were separated from\ntheir family, their children, their husband, who say, if you didn\u2019t -- if you stayed at home and you\ntook care of me and the children, you did not have to worry about that. And some were kind.\nThere are some cases where I heard that the woman who gave them the job, was very\nsympathetic, very supportive, very helpful, particularly when during the visit, the ha -- she saw\nthe husband treating the wife, because -- if you stayed at home, you wouldn\u2019t have had this, and\nyou have th -- you caused me so much grief. I have to cook, you caused your children so much\npain, and blah, blah, blah, and she became very supportive of this exiled woman. Now, I don\u2019t\nknow about the [indecipherable] cases, you know, one should look into -- into that, but it struck\nme once again human being are capable of great love, human being are capable of great caring,\nconcern, and there are some who\u2019re not. And my feeling at the time, when I learned from my\nparents, from my friends, from the people I was surrounded with, was that it makes a difference\nif you\u2019re persecuted, and there are people who cares about you. And that began with a basket of\nroasted chicken, and thing that -- fruits -- and other -- than my parents, and other, brought to San\nVittory at the prison, and -- and also to people who are very poor, because there was a great deal\nof poverty at that time, and Mussolini was encouraging women to have a lot of children -- a lot\nof children to provide sons to go to war, essentially, cause he was always in t -- trying that, and --\nand things were bad, but then, when Mussolini met Hitler someplace, I think it was the Brenner\nPass, and must have been close to the beginning of the war, maybe a couple of years earlier, I\ndon\u2019t know. Again, the propaganda was all in the hand of the Fascist [indecipherable] and the\nradio, there was no television. Osana about the alliance between Mussolini, and -- and at that\ntime, the open hostility and contempt for the Jews, the propaganda began, to the point when\nJewish people began really to es -- try to escape, to get abroad, to -- but what struck me was,\nwhen we went [indecipherable] within smuggles, and friends, and the biter, the Pastore, you\nknow, the enormous compassion, and the enormous anger at wik Fascistoni -- there was -- were\nFascistoni means big Fascist. Because before, many people had accepted -- they were against the\nalliance with Germany from day one, because of the memory of World War One, because when\nGerman and Austrian soldier were captured as prisoner, farmer family treated them well.\nApparently, when the Italian prisoner of the German came back, they had horrible story to tell. I\nwas too young, but I have heard from -- from -- one we thing that happened at that time, that has\nremained with me very vividly, about wars, the occupation, that I mention so many French,\nAustrian, Berber, Swedish, that si -- that the memory of the occupation by the Austrian was very\nvivid when I was a child, because after all, Milan was occupied by them. The Aousta family,\nPiedmont -- regained Piedmont, the Aousta family, in 1849. Then, in 1859, is when finally\nLombardy was freed. You know, if -- andre dios 1s nothing in human history, but my parents\ntook me to see a little chapel in Lombardy not very far from Milan, in the countryside, and there\nare many of such chapel throughout Lombardy and Piedmont. And these little chapel, plain,\nthere is usually an image of some saint or something [indecipherable]. Then there is a grate, and\ninside the grate, there are bones. And the bones are the bones then the farmer founds, either in\nPiedmont, or Lombardy, people who died in the war in 1848, in 1858 - \u00b059. And the farmer\nfound so many, then they erected this little chapel as a memorial to the people who died, but that\nmemorial is a reminder that war is a horrible thing, and -- and people sometime bring matsolini\ndi furey. If you pick up some poppy, and bachelor button, and -- you know, and it\u2019s a ca -- and\nthen there 1s a -- a charo, there is a -- a candle, you know, those -- and then they put, and -- and\nthis is done spontaneously, nobody is in charge. But my parents reminded me then, this was a\nway to remember those horror, and hopefully it doesn\u2019t happen again, but they also talk about\nHitler, and Mussolini, but they also talk about Stalin. They felt that Stalin, and Hitler, but like\nthis, Mussolini was considered a buffoon, less ideological, although he did put nula osta to the\ndeportation. And it was not until after the war, when I met Angela Dinati, then we talk about the\nrole of Italian Army of occupation in Greece, in Yugoslavia, and [indecipherable]. Now, already\nwere -- throughout the world, there were letter coming from soldier Italian, in Albania, in\nYugoslavia, and they crying the horror of the Nazi death camp, through letters, which, although\nthere was censorship, nevertheless, it was brought out, and everybody talked about it. It was like\none of those telegram -- verbal telegram tree, then everybody -- no. Admittedly, the retay may\nhave been difficult. An interesting thing happened. Italy had censorship, but many Italian censor\nmade a point of passing some of the material to the anti-Fascist groups, and probably also to the\nchurch, I don\u2019t know. I only know the anti-Fascist leadership, Communist, or Socialist, parti\n[indecipherable], were recipient of those letters from Italian soldier who decried the horror of\nItalian being associated with the German in this horrib -- horrendous enterprise. It\u2019s against all\nthe Italian history, culture, ence religious figure [indecipherable]. And that\u2019s where the split in\nthe religious community took place. And the ambiguity, and the lack of clarity, with the\nexception of some priests, who actually gave their lives. Norman Zofti, I think was his name.\nOne priest in Milan, I know that he was shot in a -- in a place in Milan, that\u2019s a-another --\nanother period, but it was during the occupation. But again, there was this divisions, and of\ncourse there were many skeptics, although they were Catholic, and there were many Catholic\nwho did everything to help the Jewish people. But they couldn\u2019t give back the jobs, the jobs were\ntaken away. You know, the professor of the university were removed, and doctor were -- yes,\nthey practiced, but 1-in official universe medical school, etcetera, 1t was the Catholic doctor who\ntook over, and some of them were wonderful, and some of them found even way to send patients\nto this Jewish doctor, so then they could make some money. But above all, it was a time to begin\nlooking for safe places. I\u2019m going to take a break, because I have to go to the bathroom, but I\nalso want to show you that little red book, because two years ago, three years ago, when I went\nback to the -- to Milan, and I went to the archive with the cardinal -- we [indecipherable] then I\nask Julianna, would she please take me to see some of the conven -- the churches, and the farm\nin -- where we used to hide people, and also the confessional, where -- the place where we could\nexchange message with sympathetic priest.",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s take -- let\u2019s take a break. We\u2019re back from our break, we all -- we took a walk in\nthe beautiful garden. Ginetta, I wanted to ask you, when the racial laws were promulgated in\n1938, did you actually -- you were what, 15 years old?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: 13 - 14- 15 years old. So did you feel the real difference that happened when Mussolini is\nmoving towards an alliance with Hitler, and when the racial laws came in, did you feel that, did\nyou understand what was happening, that there was a real difference from you had experienced\nbefore under -- under Mussolini?",
        "A: Not fully. Not fully, and there was that sense of uneasiness. There was s -- you know, you\nplay with other children, and some -- very few, but -- would make some comments about Jews. I\nwould say there was a quiet sense of fear, a little bit, uneasiness, uncertitude. Your world had\nchanged. It seems that you had to be careful about everything. That carefree wonderful feeling,\nyes, there will be uneasiness, for a [indecipherable] something changed, and I cannot describe it\nvery well, except there was a sense of uneasiness, and probably looking back, hidden fears. You\nare not fully -- not fully understand why, but it\u2019s there. And then, a-as I said, we read the\nnewspaper, we listened to the radio, and of course, we didn\u2019t believe in it, but the propaganda\nwas there, day after day after day. And I do remember that we listened to the BBC hiding in the\ncellar, because it was against the law. The other thing that my parents always did, and friends\nalways did, every time they went to Switzerland skiing, like from bart to lunch, going to Zermot,\netcetera, they always tried to bring back a -- a pass from other countries, and I tell you, you do\ndevelop a love for the free press when you -- you pass it around from one to the other, and then --\noh, you only have t -- one day, then you have to give it to the other. It was just that, 1f you are\nafirmati, you were so famished for news, which were not the propaganda lying of the Fascist.\nAnd I -- I ha -- you know, I -- I believed then one of the reason I treasured article 19 of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, was freedom of expression, which I still believe is one\nof civilization highest achievement. Now [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Shall we take a break? Yes, someone has entered the house, and we\u2019re going to take a break.\nOkay, we\u2019re now back from our second little break, and I -- a friend of Ginetta\u2019s brought in a\nAmnesty International award that has a -- some of the barbed wire from the escape experiences,\nand we\u2019 ll talk about that later. Ginetta, I wanted to ask you, di -- when you were in school, did\nyou n -- did you notice the Jewish kids who were not able to be in school any more? Any of your\nfriends?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Yes, and that was a time when, actually, we moved to a place, at first, called San Columbano\nOlumbro, and went to another school for two years, new teacher, new s -- kids. That -- the\nprincipal of that school was a friend of my mother, and apparently she is the one who suggested\nthat we move from this place called -- I think was called Grafeenyella. At first I had completed\nfive grades, but secondly, she helped my parents to choose a place where probably we would\nhave been more comfortable. And so we went for two years, a new school, new everything, and\nthen two years later, we moved again to another place called Santangelo lo dejarno, but my\nparents at the time lived separately from me. They left me with a wonderful istydutris, a beautiful\nhouse --",
        "Q: What is -- can you explain what an is --",
        "A: Istydutris means a woman who is in charge of my education, teach -- continuing to teach me\nliterature, French. And her name was Angeletta Souvinagi, an anti-Fascist. Her brother worked\nin Milan someplace, a -- but she loved music, and -- and of course, every weekend I would see\nmy parents, but meanwhile I was being, quote, educated. I didn\u2019t understand fully until later, that\nit was a one way for me to be protected somehow. It was such a difficult period, it\u2019s hard to\ndescribe. So, but I did get a wonderful education, number one, wonderful place to live, and with\nmy parents cooperation, Angeletta Souvinagi developed -- they bought -- they built a chicken\ncoops, one for white chicken, Leghorn, and one for red chicken called Rhode Island, and there\nthe rooster. And they also built a -- oh, oh -- I -- remo -- remodel a place, I really don\u2019t know, but\nI had to learn how to feed chicken, and the feedera to mix the various ingredient, and then\nexperiment with the white -- with the feeding white chicken, with the red with a different\nformula, and see which one did better, which one had more eggs. And it seems kind of teaching\nme how to study. And then, they also had an incubator, when -- I remember the eggs were\nfurnished from some other place, I can\u2019t remember where, very expensive. And then I could\nobserve once in awhile, how the embryo developed. And then eventually, when the chicks were\nborn, again there was an incubator -- the room was divided in two section, two incubator, and\nagain the chicks were fed a different formula than we had to make up. I remember there were dry\npowder milk for example. Fish, dry fish, something like that. I don\u2019t remember the ritay. All\nwhat I remember was it was a joyous experience. I could not play with other children. I went to\nschool, and I came back. But, we could go to the mountains all the time. And so the chicken\nraising was w -- as well as studying French and literature, history, and singing. And -- I\nremember --",
        "Q: And singing?",
        "A: -- and remember bei -- no, not si -- studying singing, but listen to opera, and -- and -- and\nthere were record, there was no cassette, or -- like today, but I do remember that song about San\nVittory, which I learned, and of course [indecipherable] this friend was also anti-Fascist, but it\nwas the physical environment was beautiful, there were fruit tree in summer, vegetable,\nchickens, and learning. But there were no other children.",
        "Q: Th-The tape is almost finished, let\u2019s change the tape.",
        "A: -- except for the mountains, except for the mountain, that remained. Going to the mountains,\ngoing to the refuge, that remained.",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s stop the tape for a moment.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ginetta Sagan, conducted by Joan\nRingleheim on September 23\", in Atherton, California, and this is tape number two, side A.\nGinetta, when we just completed the other tape, you were talking about having to be protected.\nCan you explain why you needed to be protected, and why you have to move, and stay away\nfrom the other children?",
        "A: Because my mother was Jewish. My father was Catholic, but my mother was Jewish, and it\nwas not something that I fully understood. So I had lots of trouble to -- why do we have to\nmove? Why do we have to go f -- 1t was not hiding, because I went to the mountains as usually, I\nwent to the Lake of Como, I went to Valdentelvee, I went -- but there was no playing with other\nchildren, that\u2019s -- was difficult.",
        "Q: Were -- were you tau -- educated in either religion? In either Catholicism or Judaism?",
        "A: I had to study. I had to study the cath -- the Jewish religion, the Catholic church, and I ha -- I\nwent to church, and I went, you know, to -- with my friends, sometime -- not very religious. The\nthing that my parents taught me was that God is a -- an entity that every person has to decide for\nthemself. The most important thing then, the religion, the Judeo-Christian religion has left us, are\nthe principle of caring, loving, and one of the thing that ins -- they insisted I would read, beside\nthe Bible, also with some friends, we went to the Catholic church when there was a series of les\nparabala. They were telling the stories of -- from the Jewish tradition, and the Catholic tradition\nof when, for example, Joseph was sold in Egypt, when -- a-and all the stories. When the -- Jesus\nChrist was on a horse, and gave a -- a coat to somebody who was very poor, and the reason I\nremember that was because there was also a difficult depression in Italy. So I gave my coat, next\nday, to one of the s -- girls that I knew her father was out of job. And I remember my mother\nmaking my lunches three times more and telling me how careful I had to be, and tactful, because\nthe father of so and so does not have a job. Now, I don\u2019t know if it was because of the\ndepression, or because they were Jewish, I have no idea, except that she made all these\nwonderful roasted chicken legs, and -- and reminding me how I had to be very delicate, and say,\n\u201cOh,\u201d you know, \u201chere, I can\u2019t eat all this. How would you like some?\u201d Knowing that she didn\u2019t\nhave some de -- I remember the coat, because I -- I went home, and I said, \u201cI gave away my\ncoat,\u201d because of the parabala of giving, and so she started laughing, and they got me another\ncoat.",
        "Q: S-So she wasn\u2019t angry, she --",
        "A: Oh no. No, no, no. No, no, not at all. It -- on the contrary, you know, no, acha -- they -- they\nsmiled, and they laughed, and -- and that was it. But I do remember being in the mountains\nsometime, when I took walk -- when wa -- if I was in Shamoni, and I decided t-to -- to go and\npick up some ackenberry myself, I was always staying with people, but sometime you feel like\ngoing by yourself along the stream, and the boat, and pick up a berry. And the owner of the\npensionne would make the pastry, and -- at that time I didn\u2019t cook. And thinking about -- you\nknow, it\u2019s really marvelous what we have around us, all this beauty. And then thinking about the\n-- Moses escaping from Egypt, the oil that lasted in -- in -- seven days, or [indecipherable]. And\ntrying to reconcile the Jewish with the Catholic. And then, I had trouble understanding how the\nCatholic could hate the Jews. And so many pogrom -- that we knew, about the pogrom, and\nother, and -- and being puzzled, and not un-understanding how can they do this? You know, they\n-- and then saying, \u201cWell, whichever God is up there, I like the beauty, the flowers, the\nmountains, the sea. But I don\u2019t like what\u2019s -- what some people are doing. And, so my parents\nwould explain that it\u2019s one thing the philosophy of a religion, and you take the best of it. Then\nwe spoke about the Muslim, and how there were many wonderful thing, charity, caring, that\npeople empower -- transformed part of that religion, in order to secure their own power, and they\ndid that by terrorizing people. And then they gave me the example of the first time -- some\npeople rebelled immediately against the tax collector, who, on the name of the -- the power of\nthe God, given to the temple -- power, was collecting the taxes, and the people were starving. So\nfinally, one day they drew him out of town, apparently. And that was one example of how\nreligious power was used for temperon power, and how that power was used to oppress people.\nAnd that, many religion had done, throughout the centuries. So, we also went to Greece, and I\nremember how they compared the Egyptian god. Serious, forbidding, autocratic. And how the\ngod of Greece were funny. And so I had to learn somehow, about religion, in a very different\nway than most people learned religion, but I love to go to -- to the [indecipherable] sometime, for\nthe sola mass, we -- we did. And with my nurse, my wet nurse, you know, it was so comforting.\nNow, in the synagogue when I visit, I couldn\u2019t understand why men and women were in one\nplace, and the other, and I -- why not together? But again, that was -- was not something that I\nbecame deeply involved in practicing. I loved the ceremonial, and I remember on a Friday night,\nwhen my mother put on a white blouse, and then with the candle, and she did something like\nthat. But I didn\u2019t understand it. What they tried to teach me were the wonderful, biblical story of\nthe Bible, and what the Catholic church had taken, but pointing out, when the Catholic church\nfor example, was going to forbi -- forbade study of other religions, and so they gave me Voltaire\nto start to read and study. So I studied Voltaire, and the rebelliousness of Voltaire, and then --\nand the bola from the city church, exercised control, or publication through special stamps. I\ncan\u2019t remember the name of it, but Voltaire -- index, that\u2019s what it was. Voltaire was one of the\nauthor at the index. So, my parents made a point, and I had to study, read Voltaire, I loved it. So\n-- and --",
        "Q: So, there was some ritual in your house, in terms of religion, with your mother doing the Sh-\nShabbas?",
        "A: Occasionally.",

        "A: Very occasionally.",

        "A: No. The -- may I skip to another?",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: Occasion during the resistance where we were hiding in Milan, and it was Friday, and candela\nwere very precious. But somebody provided two candle, because the other people hiding were\nJewish, and so for Friday. So, I think sometime how lucky people are, if on Friday night, they\ncan have the ceremonial. Just as I think about other religions being free to have the ceremonial,\nfreely, without coercion, without persecution. But that [indecipherable] motzikoni di candela,\ntwo small pieces. I mean, it\u2019s unbelievable how those things remain with you, and -- and think, if\npeople were free to do that, they should be so happy, not to be persecuted, not to be -- or looked\nupon as strange, or -- and I owe that to my parents, to teach me early, early, the power of\noppression, then some people gain, through a control of part of religion, and so many have done\nthat, so many religion have done that. So I ended up by trying to work for every person to be free\nto practice their religion, or political belief, or ethnic pride, or what have you. But I also feel that\nwe are so fortunate to have so many beautiful thing in earth around us, whether the mountains,\nthe flower, the sea. And -- and people. We should bless how fortunate we are, even if we --\nsometime we have some difficulty. Okay.",
        "A: S-So you sound li -- as if you had a very co -- close, intimate kind of relationship with your\nparents, with a lot of discussion, and a lot of communication, is that correct?",

        "A: W -- they wouldn\u2019t talk about what they were doing. Was very -- I don\u2019t like the word\nsecretive, but in a sense they didn\u2019t want to expose other people. And I -- we could only perceive\nthen something was going on, and we could only guess. I remember -- and I spoke about this, on\none evening, when I was sent -- I was fed early, and I -- and then, go to your room to study, or\ndo, you know, things. And I remember a heated discussion when my parents had with somebody,\nthat I don\u2019t know who, and they kept on saying, \u201cYou must leave Germany now,\u201d or -- and the\nperson saying, with an accent, \u201cBut I was born there. My father had meadows,\u201d or something, I\ncan\u2019t remember the detail. And my parents, both of them, said, \u201cWe can help you now.

You\u2019ve got -- we can\nhelp you now, we may not be able to help you later.\u201d",
        "Q: And what did you think when you were hearing this?",
        "A: I was puzzled. I didn\u2019t understand. I couldn\u2019t understand why people have to leave their\ncountry. And this one was not from Italy, this was somebody else now. When I spoke to Guido\nBustelli about all this, then he -- we spent the whole day going through, and we don\u2019t have the\ntime to do that, but -- although I knew many things, but Guido Bustelli clarified for me so many\naspect of the pre-war period, and he is the one who told me that -- Bustelli -- that in August,\n1939, the chief of the Intelligence Services of Switzerland, and I re -- I believe his name was\nMayzon, but I can\u2019t swear to it. Mayzon because I associate it with brick. Mayzon -- maison in\nFrench, because my parents taught me to make association of words with things. Apparently,\nthey were all called together by the chief of the Swiss Intelligence Service, and said,\n\u201cGentlemen, based on the information we received f-from excellent sources, reliable sources,\nHitler will attack Poland in a couple of weeks, and that was about the middle of August. And of\ncourse, he did. And also, Bustelli told me that the Swiss Intelligence knew that they would use a\nJewish prisoner in a mock attack on the German, and claim that it was instigated by the Jewish\npeople. Now, I -- I haven\u2019t read that part of history, somebody else will have to do that, but we\nspend the day, and then at the end of the days, when I said bus -- by then he has become very\nfriendly, and [indecipherable] before the very official Swiss officer. By then he had taken me to\nhis study, and he showed me a lot of photograph of people who had been -- I mean, you -- they\nhad been arrested, and -- another story. Two, particularly, John and Eddie, and he -- he did\nsomething wonderful. I said -- at that time, there was this head of the network of smuggler,\ncalled Lydia, I don\u2019t know her real name. [indecipherable] familiar, and he started laughing. So,\nhe took my hand, we went through -- and [indecipherable] study at this point. So Lena, his wife,\nJenna, and Lillaburra_ were still drinking white wine, and eating parmesan cheese, and -- and we\n-- a-and Guido smiled at them, and took me to the end of the courit -- [indecipherable] was a\ntelephone, he dialed a number, and he said, \u201cLydia, Torpelino is alive.\u201d",
        "Q: So she didn\u2019t know you were alive, and you didn\u2019t know.",
        "A: [indecipherable]. Such an emotional moment. Then there were -- stupid\n[indecipherable|creedi mocha tua morte. She thought -- you know, many people -- since I\ndisappeared, I was in a convalescent home. They thought that either I had died, some thought\nthat I was in a mental hospital.

        "A: I didn\u2019t decide. We were. There was no such a thing as a day when a conscious decision was\nmade to join the Resistance. It was an anti-Fascist movement, and as such, dedicated to helping\nthe victim of Fascism. One particular group of people, who deserves a great deal of recognition\nis a small convent, with nun. My parents were very close to them. These nun had the small\nconvent in a place called, I believe, Grafinala, which was a tiny village near Milan. These nun\nwere truly dedicated to helping people in needs. Women who had been thrown out of their home,\nbecause they\u2019re pregnant with illegitimate children, and quietly, with the head of the -- what 1s --\nCosinda -- Cosinda, the mayor of this little village, Grafinala, who 1s also the head of the Fascist\nparty. He sits there, wert, in the city hall of this little village, together with my family, friends.\nWas an incredible unit, organized to assist the victim of Fascism, although he was the head of the\nFascist party for this little communit -- this little village. And it\u2019s always assisted people who are\nhiding, who are sent by my parents, or by other people, to hide in the farms. They may have been\nJewish, they may have been anti-Fascist, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just that all of us young people seems\nto have been recr -- not recruited, you were just par -- natural part of the assistant project. And\nthen, in 19 -- I believe it is \u201942, but I\u2019m not certain, the head, th -- the Sindaco, the -- the mayor,\nwhose sister was the employee of the city hall, who was giving coupon for clothes, for food,\ndecided that I should work there as a temporary employee in order to, yes, give the coupon to\npeople of the village, who paid, I believe was one lira, but I\u2019m not -- you know, it\u2019s such a long\ntime ago. And every 10 coupons, I would put away one that I would give to the nun. And those\nwere to help her -- people who were either anti-Fascist, or Jewish, hiding. Because in Milan, they\nhad already established some controls of the coupon given in certain area of the city block, a city\nblock. And the Ovra -- the secret police, was watching in case there were more coupon for food\nthan the people. Don\u2019t ask me how it was done, I don\u2019t have a clue. All what I know that it was\ndone, and this little village, and possibly other, I don\u2019t know, these little group of nun, with help\n-- with the help of the s -- mayor -- you call 1t mayor, it\u2019s Sindaco, who 1s a Fascist, the head of\nthe fasc -- he was helping, and his sister, being a city hall employee, was a -- crucial. And they\nwere so outraged about what Mussolini was doing to the Jewish people, or anti-Fascist. The\nquestion arose, apparently -- I only heard, that there was a discussion, he wanted to resign, and\neverybody said don\u2019t you do it, because you are far more helpful where you are, in helping us.\nAnd so he stayed, and on the -- the Fascist would give away sometime, la bifana -- la bifana\nfashista, which was January sixth, or something like this, after Christmas, and he would give\nspecial toys and things to children in the name of the Fascist, but he was wa -- our greatest\nhelper, and his sister, and the nun, and the Mother Superior was a gem. I didn\u2019t mind working\ntwo weeks to make lace for the church, and such a warm, caring environment, trying to help.\nThey -- they were never judging people, are you Jewish or not Jewish, are you Fascist, or anti-\nFascist? Are you Catholic, or not Catholic? It was just -- what I felt was this is the display of true\nChristianity, if there is such a thing, you know? I\u2019m certain that the best of the Judeo-Christian\ntradition in caring, I saw it at that time.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So what then happened? You s -- you started doing this, but then you obviously\nmoved to more dangerous and complex acts, no?",
        "A: Yes. The group in Milan, Enrico Mullisanno, Rainso Contamessa, Pigi Mullisanno, Peggy,\nand other, decided that apparently I was bright. I didn\u2019t know how to type, but they felt that I\ncould be very helpful working with them, for them, as a secretary, at the headquarter of the\nItalian Air Force in Milan. I think was Piazza Italibalbo number four.",
        "Q: C-Could I interrupt? How --",
        "A: Yes?",
        "Q: -- how old were you at this time, about?",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t know, 15 - 16, something like that, I can\u2019t -- young. But because many clerk were\naway in the war, it was a terrible war. All young people were drafted. I must make a point here,\nthan many young people who are Fascistoni, big Fascist, and pro-Nazi, who screamed moliama\nla guerra, moliama la guerra, we want war, we want war, they didn\u2019t go to the African front.\nThey didn\u2019t go to the Russian front. They didn\u2019t go to the Albanian front, they didn\u2019t go to\nYugoslavia, and all those places which were dangerous. They found a nice, warm hiding places\nin the office, the bureaucracy of the military, of the navy, or everything else. And that was, I\nbelieve, a shock for the Italian, that all these Fascistoni then proclaimed moliama la guerra,\nmoliama la guerra, but then, they -- they were called inboscarti. They found a comfortable niche\nin the city where there was no danger of them being killed. They send all those poor young men\nto died, especially on the Russian front, as well as the African front, as well as Yugoslavia, and\nAlbania. And there is a wonderful song about Albania, about the alpini, those are the mountain\ntroops, who truly wonderful, and not politicized to the same degree as other. And they began\nwriting home letters describing what was happening on the Russian front, describing what was\nhappening in Albania, describing what was happening in Yugoslavia, Croatia, and all those\nplaces, and saying, \u201cI am Italian, I love my country, but I am ashamed of what some people are\ndoing, collaborating with the Nazi.\u201d And they were letting their family know, and of course not\neverything came true, and the censorship was very strict, but we have to remember that among\nthe censorship there were also people who were Italian, and Italian being Italian, and member of\nthe -- letter go through, so that we seems to be aware at that time -- not that I understood it, far\nfrom it. But anyway, I was asked to go and work as a secretary for Enrico Mullisanno, the\nlawyer, Pigi Mullisanno, a lawyer, Rainso Contamessa, a lawyer, who were all officers of the Air\nForce dur -- in Piazza Italibalbo at the headquarter. All of them were anti-Fascist, all of them\nwere part em -- of the anti-Fascist movement called jewsteetsa liberta. All of them intent on\nworking with the factory, with industry. Industry had to produce for the German, but one person\nwho was at -- it -- at the headquarter was Guido Chezura. Guido Chezura was a high ranking offi\n-- officer of the Pirelli, but he was a captain of something, I can\u2019t remember his exact grade, but\nhe was with Pirelli. Pirelli was supplying rubber tire, and others. Well, stay out of any anti-\nFascist movement, you are far more valuable if you don\u2019t say anything, if you just help. An\nincredible woman, who every time she typed anything, there was an extra copy for the\ncommittee -- but there was no committee of national liberation at the time. I don\u2019t know, but it\nwent to the anti-Fascist movement. Her name was Peggy. And I always look at her, because she\nwas so beautiful, and beautifully dressed, and I felt like a shrimp next to her. But she was a\nwonderful friend, and on top of all, she was a very effective underground worker. I was simply a\ncourier, but I learned at the time that bringing messages, such as the one preparatory to a March\n1944 strike, simultaneously taking place in Milan, Torino, Genoa. I went back and forth, went to\nthe factories, and I discovered in all these women working in this factory, most of them were\nCommunists and Socialists, very hard line, very committed, very well organized. And I have to\nsay this, the Communist, and the Socialist were very, very well organized against anti-Fascism.\nThe leadership had been imprisoned --",
        "Q: You mea -- you mean against Fascism, not against anti-Fascism?",
        "A: Against Fascist.",
        "Q: Fascism, right, yes, right, right.",
        "A: Fascist and Nazi. And they had been part of the anti-Fascist movement. Some -- I mean the\nleadership -- some of them had been imprisoned during the Mussolini period, even before the\nwar, in ile -- remote ila lipari, [indecipherable] and other prison. But they were organized. They\nhad been trained to work in the underground. We\u2019re not. We learning -- we are learning, but they\nwere pro, because for years they had had leadership. Now, the Rosetti brother formed jewsteetsa\nliberta, that was the result of the fact that they left Communism, because they felt there 1s really\nno difference between hard line Marxist Leninism, and Nazi Fascists, and formed jewsteetsa\nliberta. Then they were thrown -- they escape to France, and this I heard, I have no first-hand\nexperience with all that, but I was told then the Ovra, the Italian Fascist secret police, in\ncooperation with the French secret police, political, assassinated both of them. And\n[indecipherable] what I found at that period during the war, and especially 1942 - \u201943, until the\n[indecipherable] was that everybody knew about them. And in the factory, the women, and the\nleadership be-began questioning whether their true commitment, total commitment to Marxist\nLeninism was the best way for the post-war government of Italy. I didn\u2019t understand it. I had --\nyou know, I tried, but I began to see that the anti-Fascism that I grew up with, and also the\nreference to the Communist after World War One, were bad too, but it was so remote. This was\nreal. This I had to go from Piazza Italibalbo, every morning I went to work, every morning I was\ngiven messages to bring to this place, to that place, to this place, to that place. And don\u2019t ask\nmany question. I was a stuffetta. But also, I remember being sent to places where there was the\nhappa leadership of industry, la falca. I believe 1t was montanapalioni, I think. And they were\nproviding money. Whether they were working under the Fascist, and producing for the Nazi, but\nthey were providing funds to assist the victim of persecution, and -- which I delivered but I don\u2019t\nknow -- there -- somebody else did the job. I was a simple stuffetta.",
        "Q: And what -- what is a stuffetta?",
        "A: Stuffetta means a person who\u2019s a courier. You don\u2019t know anything about anything else\nexcept what you are doing. A-And the reason was because they were taking extreme precaution,\nbecause the Ovra was still very active. Then, on July, 1943, Mussolini fell. And already they had\nsense in this group -- and remember, this was highly educated upper contact with the military,\nwith the foreign office, with the society, with the churches, with -- and -- and I remember that\nMussolini was overthrown, and I was told not to go home. I stay with Peggy one day, and we\nmade eggplants, I always remember fried eggplants. And -- and people who I -- the same people,\nI believe, not all -- not the anti-Fascists, of course, but many people had say, \u201cMussolini,\nmoliama la guerra, moliama la guerra, moliama la guerra.\u201d This time they were throwing\nmattresses out of the house on the Fascists. And I became acquainted with how easily political\nparty can manipulate masses, bringing them by truck to demonstrations. How ya -- how do you\nsay, whip them up for this, or against this. And I became very skeptical of the political processes,\nand le -- and began looking at the political process with a very keen eye, so to speak. The other\nlesson that I was learning at this time was the clandestine press, because we had wonderful\npeople who did work for the press, which was all controlled by the Fascists, who did control for\nthe radio, which was all controlled by the Fascists. But we were also listening to the BBC. I\ndidn\u2019t understand English, but somebody helped to understand it. And in the process, we were\ntaught how to understand propaganda. If we had to write anti-Fascist leaflet, we had to\nunderstand why we were anti-Fascist, and anti-Nazi. The -- how propaganda 1s used, how it can\nbe used, how it can be manipulated. And I must say that little by little, I learned that not\neverything is black and white, and -- however, I came away from that with a sense that the truth\nis very important. Eventually the truth emerge. And the other passion that I developed at that\ntime was for freedom of expression. That we may not be absolutely right, but there 1 -- in a free\nexpression, then there is always the mean to rectify. And people should treasure that, and be very\ncareful, because dictatorship will always manipulate, distort, lie, deceive. And unless we keep\nconstant vigilance, we are likely to lose those rights. And those rights could be privilege given by\nany government, political party, religious groups. Somehow I felt, and I was sitting at this table,\nand they were expert there, I was not. And I look at the world, where I felt we have opportunity\nto do something by informing people. And then somebody reminded me that many of the Italian\nwere analphabet. They didn\u2019t know how to read and write. And therefore, education was the\nprimary need, so then other people beca -- besides elementary education, they could also read,\nand then understand what they were reading. And -- we stopping?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: So, that\u2019s --",
        "Q: So --",
        "A: Then I -- we continued, it was a -- just a tremendous hi -- traffic with many, many, many\nwomen, children, old men, because the young one weren -- and we often brought the messages in\nshopping bag. There wasn\u2019t much to shop, but whatever we could find, wi -- then the bicycle\ncame [indecipherable |",
        "Q: The chain?",
        "A: Bicycle, you know, the tubes, or the seat where you sit, in between, to put the messages,\nbecause bicycle was a very common thing. Trams were working when there was no bombing,\nbut if there was a bombing, there was no trams, so that you walk, or you go by bus, you\u2019d go.\nAnd what was extraordinary was a network which didn\u2019t have much structure -- it had a\nstructure, the thing was that the structure was very loose, and chow Gino, chow Pierro. You\ndidn\u2019t have a clue who chow -- who Pierro, or Gino, or whoever was, except for the leadership.\nAnd then there was the Communist party, the Socialist party, the partito retsioni. The democrat --\nChristian democrat, thesort. They all -- s-some of the top people were together. At the\n[indecipherable] place where we were working, obviously they had contact with, and very\ncareful about the possible spy within the headquarter, in Piazza Italibalbo. Ba -- by the time I\nwas there, everybody was so discouraged. I mean, the employee, the career people, were so\ndiscouraged. And when, then, the ally came to Sicily, my group, right there, opened a bottle of\nchampagne. And they were very sensitive about the career people who were there to do a job,\ntheir family was in Sicily, or in the south. And what struck me was the sense of compassion,\nthen, everybody had about people who had to serve, to get the paycheck, divided with -- you\nknow, from the family, etcetera. There wasn\u2019t hatred. And I do remember -- this is later, in\nSeptember, when one of them said, \u201cSigniorina, who\u2019s going to pay my salary now?\u201d I would\nlike a break.",
        "Q: Sure. Gonna take a break now.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know --",
        "Q: We\u2019re back from our break. Ginetta, can you describe some of what was being written in the\nunderground press?",
        "A: Yes, one of the goal of the underground press was to bring to the attention of the Italian under\nthe occupation of the Nazi Fascists, what was going on. Arrest, execution, deportation, often\nwith the name of people, and also the public edict of the Nazi, and the Fascist, telling citizen that\nunless they cooperated, then the penal -- spelling out the penalty, also the reward. For any allied\nPOW, there was a certain amount of salt, if I recall correctly, some money. Also promise of\nrelease of a family member who was in Germany, in exchange for turning in allied POW, or\nItalian who were anti-Fascist and awaiting the draft. So our goal was really to -- to do that. And\nevery party, every political party had their own newspaper. One of the newspaper then, I enjoyed\nvery much helping with in the distribution was noey darnet. We only had four members, but\nwonderful people. And I also think that that was a maturing step for all of us. Noey darnet.\nThinking about the havoc wrought in the people -- Italian people\u2019s lives, men, women, and\nchildren, by Fascism, and how are we going to rebuild a des -- destroyed society. Mussolini\nintent was essentially to have women keep their place, produce many children. Women were not\nallowed to reach higher echelon of education. But they were -- women were praised and given\nincentive to produce more and more children. At one point also, the women were asked to give\ntheir wedding band, gold, in order to pay for the war material, and the queen did her duty, and\nput her ring. Later on we learned that many of the Fascists simply put a lot of the gold 1n their\npocket. I don\u2019t know if it was true or not, but it -- it\u2019s irrelevant. The other thing we had to do\nwas to give copper, our copper pots, to be used for cannon. And boy thi -- that turned women off,\nnot to have your cooking pot, nice, heavy, often from grandparents, and from the farm, etcetera,\nto have to turn them in to make cannon. The other group of women, who were politically\nsensitive, and better organized, were limondinae. Those were wonderful young women who, for\nthe period when the rice needed to be weeded, would leave their home, and go into farm, big\nfarm. And this big farm would have huge places with mattresses which are not mattresses, they\nwere simply sack cloth filled with straw. And the women would go, I don\u2019t remember how long,\nbut they could go for the period of mondini to weed the rice, which meant being in the water\nwith leeches on their feet. And these women became quickly organized by the Communist party\nto fight Fascism, and their horrible conditions. They had their own newspapers too, but I do --\nthe one I knew was jewsteetsa liberta, no dominae, partito retsioni. The student paper, and -- and\nit was an -- a clandestine effort, needless to say. Paper was very scarce, and we were grateful to\nall the newspaper people who were employed in the regular [indecipherable] sera, yeah, for\nclandestinely making available to us, some precious, precious paper. Are you worried about the\ntape?",
        "Q: I\u2019m checking.",
        "A: So, it was a -- a dangerous thing to do, because if a member of the gopper -- gopeesti, those\nwho [indecipherable] an assassination against a target of the SS, the Gestapo, and other, if they\nwere caught, they were shot. That -- the Nazi Fascist put a premium on arresting, catching, and\ntorturing for interrogation, people who were involved in distributing the clandestine press, how\ndid they organize, where was it printed, who 1s doing it, etcetera. And gathering the information\nfor the clandestine press, which was done by a network of people, men, women and children, the\nrailway, the bill of [indecipherable], you know that kind, and also the insignia on the German,\nand trying to more or less to see if there had been changes, an increase. Anyone caught in that\nkind of work automatically was a suspect for interrogation and torture.",
        "Q: So anyone who was -- who had information, who -- and who was distributing information,\nand learning about what was going on, was in danger, yeah.",
        "A: Absolutely. And that\u2019s when I began treasuring the freedom of the press.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And also caught listening to the BBC, it meant deportation, or interrogation. In other word,\nthe -- they put a great deal of emphasis on catching people who were providing information,\neducation, exposing the horror, than they were doing -- although they were very stupid in many\nway, because on one occasion --",
        "Q: Let\u2019s bl -- let -- hold that story, I -- because the tape is going to stop. One second.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ginetta Sagan,\nconducted by Joan Ringleheim, with -- on Friday, September 24\", in Atherton, California. This\nis tape number three, side one. Ginetta, on the last tape, you started talking about an incident\nwhere they were very stupid.",
        "A: They were very stupid. Well, in general, you know, they were -- they were very -- they were\nexpert in the art of interrogation, at -- at one level, because, instead of being selective, every\nsuspect was tortured. They missed opportunity for getting information, because people died, or\npeople simply decided no way, I\u2019m going to die anyway. And one of the thing that must be said\nabout the stupidity is, and for the first time, the SS and the Gestapo brought torture, not as an\nisolated incident, as the Ovra had used, or the police had used [indecipherable] any time, any\nplace, anywhere, that is a systematic system of interrogation. And it -- torturing people to obtain\ninformation which could be useful, became routine, and that was stupid, because they really\ntortured many people who didn\u2019t know anything. And then they were hanging people publicly, in\nthe gallows, shooting them. The other stupidity that they did, horrendous stupidity was -- not in\nMilan, but abatsaboto, they caught -- there were something like 50 -- appro -- 50 - 54 partisan,\nincluding a pregnant woman, and they made that group travel from village to village, and then\nthey executed them all. In Liguria, near Genoa spitsa, there is another place where they took\nsomething like 40 or 50 young men, and publicly th-they executed them all. And now, when I\u2019m\nusing the word stupidity, is because far from frightening -- yes, people were frightened, people\nare terrorized, but also people said, what? Even many Fascists said, I don\u2019t want to be associated\nwith this. This is not Italy. And true, with the Nazi, there were the Italian Fascist, SS, the libreen,\nrigatinari, the mouti, the dechamamas, who as volunteer, joined the SS unit, and they were the\none who knew Italian, they were the one who knew the addresses to take these people, etcetera. I\nuse the word stupidity because it really increased our ranks. People who had said, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t\nhelp you, I\u2019m too frightened, not for me, but for my family -- what can I do to help?\u201d And I\nsuspect that in any underground movement, but I -- I only know Italy, when there is this kind of\nnaked brutality, people will emerge, who will take far higher risk to help the victim than they had\nbeen willing to risk before. And the reason I felt strongly about the underground press, although\nI\u2019m not a journalist, but of course the Ritsini was a journalist family, pro-monarchy, I suspect\npossibly pro-Fascist in the early period, but certainly against this kind of brutality, and they were\na great help in understanding that some conservative, from monarchy, etcetera, maybe\nproconserva -- they don\u2019t accept such brutality, and -- and had to -- had to the paper -- now, our\nworkers -- thousand of people was to paste notices, and -- and oo -- at that time, we had to make\n-- to mix flour with water, and pinello, and go -- and that was very dangerous. And then\ndistribute the clandestine press every place we could, in the fabrica factory, office, buildings,\nschool. Now the university, the student had their own newspaper, but we have to remember then,\nmost of the professor had been forced to flee, to hide, and so we, as a student hiding, had some\ntime became captive audience to professor who cou-couldn\u2019t teach, and if we were hiding\nsomeplace for few days, let me tell you, we did have good professor. I mean, discussions were\nmarvelous, and unforgettable. You may forget something that you do in the regular school, you\ndon\u2019t forget something that you learn under the circumstances, debates, pro and con, and\nsometime deliberately, they chose one or the other to take the opposite point of view for arguing\na case, for arguing a point, for arguing an essay, for arguing a book. And between that, and\nassessing the press, evaluate it, analyzing it, and then come up with a synthesis that reflected the\ntruth in very short space. I believe it helps to consolidate your thinking in a way that nothing else\nsince has ever helped me to consolidate ideas, and --",
        "Q: Do you have a recollection of any particular debate, or -- during this time? Was there any --",
        "A: Yeah, oh yes. The debate, at one point, centered around the role of people who had been part\nof the great concit of the Fascists, and then in July, turned against Mussolini, which caused, of\ncourse, the fall of Mussolini. The role of the king, accepting to be emperor, accepting Fascism all\nthose year, in spite of the terrible cost to Italy, to the Italian people, and what should be the post-\nwar or -- of those people who had been Fascist, which of course, I believe that as soon as the\nNazi came to power, tried to erase them, and executed some, like Galliazo Channo, and -- and\nother, or the king, for post war. There were pro and con, and then debate about, so -- th-th-those\nwere political discussion, and I have not been used to, and listen to people who had been\nprofessors and -- and student. It was interesting. It was a learning lesson in politics, for when -- I\nmade up my mind that I would have never -- nothing to do with politics after world war -- I\nwould have to do something with protecting human right, and freedom of expression. And then\nthe other discussion was about the slogan of the Communist, from the Ural to the Atlantic. Is that\nwhat we want for Europe? And the answer, a couple said absolutely, because they provide social\nand economic right. Other felt like hell we want from the Ural to Atlantic, to have Stalinism, and\nLeninism, in Europe. Well, but the French wants that. Well, the Italian don\u2019t. Some did, but even\nthe Italian who had been Communist, like Leo Baliani, and other, in the prison of Mussolini,\nchanged, and decided it was not good for the Italian. And in fact, no -- Ricardo Lombardi, Leo\nBaliani, Federucho Parray, they all agreed that the principle of socio-economic right is important,\nbut so are civil and political right, and the two shall be linked. And so the discussions was often\nheated. Then there was a discussion about why should we accept funds from the American --\nfrom the allies, in the conduct of the underground in Italy, to assist prisoner, family, as well as\nassist the partisan. The air drops, also money from banks, and from -- funds from the army left\nover, etcetera. We should have nothing to do with funding from the allies, or somebody said that\nwe -- the Russian are sending tons of money for the -- for the Communist, for the propaganda,\nfor everything. So the discussion were often heated on that subject. And our feeling was that we\nhave to win this war first. And then the political system that Italy will have, will have to be\ndecided by the Italian. The most important thing we should ha -- must have, is a constitution.\nAnd so then there were the professor who -- who knew laws, and knew the -- then we read the\nDeclaration of Independence, and the Bill of Rights, and oh, this 1s what we should have, and --\nbut the most thing -- everything agreed on no more dictatorship, and then brought into the\nquestion, what about the Marxist Leninist, that\u2019s a dictatorship. Oh yes, but that is a dictatorship\nof the proletariat. Does he allow freedom of expression? No. Yes, but he provides social and\neconomic right. Work for everybody, houses for everybody, food for everybody, and my\nquestion was, at what price? So, here we are -- sometime the bombs were also falling, and having\nthis discussion. But essentially I came away with a sense that open debate is crucial. But\npersonally, I will never tolerate any dictatorship, no matter what the justification 1s -- is given by\na government, period. And I didn\u2019t care if it was right wing, or left wing, or whatever. Any\ngovernment, then want to impose a dictatorship on their people, in as far as I was concerned at\nthat time, does not deserve to be respected, or supported. But to do that, you need the help of\neverybody to understand, to begin with, the danger, then this government represents. And they\nwill always find excuses, I mean, Mussolini was giving us all the excuses, Hitler was giving us\nall the excuses. Hitler wa -- Stalin was giving us all the excuses. And what was the result?\nSuffering for everybody.",
        "Q: Can you explain to me how, or what it was then, that made you say, I will never get involved\nin politics, but I will get involved in issues of human rights? What -- what was for you at that\nmoment, if you can go back there, wha -- what was it?",
        "A: Well I realized that here were people that I loved, intelligent, dedicated, who truly believed\nthat in the future, when the war was over, to obey the order of Stalin, for the good of the Italian,\nwas essentialed to reveal our society in amoda, which would be different than Fascism. I was\nunable to accept that. The other was that there were some member of the Communist party began\nworrying about this kind of thing, and discussed this openly, and felt that the Roselli brother for\njust a salivita, and understood the danger that Marxist, Lenin, and Stalinism presented for\nsociety, we still wanted to change the socio-economic situation. That was freedom, and not\nfreedom of expression suppressed in order to achieve the other. In fact, we felt at that time that\nFascism was far more modern that Leninism -- Stalinist Leninism, and look what it has done. We\ndidn\u2019t know about many other things than Stalin had done, and we knew what the Nazi had done.\nAnd analyzed, discussed, studied, compared, and all -- all the others were going to become part\nof political parties. All of them became political leaders. And it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s just that I felt there\nhas to be voices outside of the political system, that you can say, I disagree with that. And I\nremember -- I can\u2019t remember who said this, and then later on I heard it after the war many\ntimes. I think it was Voltaire. I disagree with you, but I\u2019m ready to die for your right to disagree\nwith me. I\u2019m not certain it was Voltaire, but that\u2019s what I thought at that time. That\u2019s what we\nthought at that time. I disagree with you, but I\u2019m ready to die for your right to disagree. And we\nfelt that post-war Italy had to be respectful of ideas. That there has to be a government which\nrespect the right of citizen, and not imprison them, not torture them, not have mock trial, not\nhave the special tribunal. Special tribunal was the tribunal than [indecipherable] Mussolini --\nOvra installed during the Fascist period where there were three milary -- military judges, no legal\ndefense, no -- entrapment was the -- the word for any suspect. So, those are the idea that really\nconsumed us, while we were all so activist in helping, in hiding, in pasting notices, or change\nslogan of the -- we knew then people were deported in railway tracks. We were told that they\nwere sent to Germany to work. And somebody wrote [indecipherable] Tedeschi, W. Tedeschi,\nand we will paint Abastoy Tedeschi, I mean, stupid things like this. It -- it -- 1t was just perhaps\nchildish, but we felt it was important, and boy if you were caught, you are shot. You know, th-\nthat kind of -- that distribution of mater -- leaflet press, and also learning to communicate to\nothers, if there was a -- a danger. The reason I made a copy of carla was because it\u2019s a classic\nexample of somebody who undertake a very important project on that ha -- on that history, that\nalso how somebody let him know then somebody was searching him, and instead of explaining,\nif you read it, you get it. And -- and [indecipherable] translated into English, so that you can -- is\nan example of hundreds -- hundreds, and ordinary people doing kind of strange things all the\ntime.",
        "Q: N-Not -- I don\u2019t want to push this too much, but your interest in human rights, going back to\nthat period of time, is it that you were trying to establish what you thought were the necessary\nconditions for a society, whereas politics sometimes undermined those necessary conditions?\nThat you were -- that there was something about human life that you wanted to protect, whatever\nthe political system was. So you weren\u2019t interested in power, and accumulation of power. I du --\nI\u2019m trying to figure out what it is that was pulling you away from pul -- politics, into another\nworld. I don\u2019t know whether --",
        "A: We have to say we, because I was not the only one.",
        "Q: W -- wes -- yes, right, right.",
        "A: And I have emphasized the word we, we, we, because these were a group of people working\ntogether but who disagreed about the political system --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- to succeed Mussolini in post-war Italy.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And then we also learned that sometime funds coming in from the allies, and distributed to\nthe church, was distributed to every group, but we also learned that the Communists were also\nkeeping money for the post-war re-organization of the Communist party. And at the time when\nyou have such horror going on, and you need every penny to help everybody, I felt, my God, I\nam no different than the Fascist. They are already beginning to accumulate money for power, for\ntheir control after. And the slogan, from the Ural to Atlantic really made us uneasy. Not just me,\nbut Enrico Mullisanno, Pigi Mullisanno, Rainso Contamessa. They were Communists who were\nqueasy about it, but they still felt that they owed obedience. So my response was -- and this was\nmy response, obideerai -- craderai obideerai combaterai. To believe -- to believe craderai.\nObideera, obey, combaterai, fight. And I said, what is the difference when with the slogan of\nStalin, and the slogan of Mussolini, and the slogan of the church, the Catholic church. Craderai,\nobideerai, combaterai. And I said, we want a force [indecipherable] of Italy, which hopefully will\nreflect the freedom that every person is entitled to. The respect, the dignity. If you want to be a\nCommunist, you should be a Communist, but if I want to be something else -- I respect your\nright, but you have to respect mine. You don\u2019t imprison me if you are in power because I happen\nto have different view, political or religious, because we remember also the Inquisition. And\nItalian history is replete with it. One discussion we had in the underground about torture was\nthen the -- actually the Empress of Austria, not herself, but on the advice of counsel, Austria had\nabolished the use of torture to extract information, and I believe it was the end of the previous\ncentury, and yet, 1t was reinstated when the Nazi came, eliminating the judicial system, taking\nover the judicial system, and -- and using torture. So, the discussion also centered about what the\n-- the Austrian had done at the -- the end of the previous century -- not that Maria Theresa was\nnecessarily enthusiastic, but she accepted the advice of her counsel to eliminate tr -- torture, and\nthen, as Hitler comes to power, the court lose juridical prerogative, due to the court, and the\njudicial system, for political reason. And then they bring it to Italy. And while cases of torture\nhad always occurred, but this was systematic torture, and it was horrendous. I mean, people --\nthe scream were heard in -- whether it was in Milan, in Biapaolocelli, in Torino, La\nCamradeebeeasti, Aroust, every place. It became an epidemic. But we thought about the\npossibility of that under a dictatorial regime. And we felt a dictatorship can use this method, as\nthe Nazi, the Fascists are doing, any place, any time. So in a post-war Italy, what we want is\nguarantee, and that will never happen again. And we\u2019re thinking about Italy.",
        "Q: Where were you living at this time? Were you still living with your parents?",
        "A: Oh, I -- I beg your pardon?",
        "Q: Were you living with your parents?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t see -- I couldn\u2019t see them. So I -- the underground had a assistance program, and\nI was actually handling three apartments, in Viama Kerajoya, \u201941. The concierge, Mrs. Columbo,\nwas our friend. Her brother-in-law was executed, was one of the partisan who, in the railway,\nwho was helping to give us the correct bill of lading, instead of the bill of lading when the\nGermans said on the train coming in, whate -- instea -- they would put clothes in, but e -- as, in\nfact they were armament. And that was very important to the allies, to know what kind of\nmaterial the German were bringing in for the war effort. And there was an army of young people,\nstudent and others. Now, the brother of mis -- in-law of Mrs. Columbo was caught and executed.\nNow, there were three apartment derain prepared by the underground. Don\u2019t ask me, except that\nmy little apartment was quickly -- an arch -- furnitch -- an architect came and fixed the cupboard,\nand it was very well arranged. Then there was a third floor apartment, that I was handling for a\ncourier who came back and forth. And then there was one on the fifth floor that I never saw,\nexcept that when somebody came, was a special password, it was the fifth floor. And only later,\nafter the war, we realized then that was probably the OSS people. And they kept everything\ncompartmen -- compartmentalized. Then, in addition to these three apartment, we were in the --\nanother apartment in [indecipherable] few block further down, and a network of places where\npeople could spend a night. And it was all integrated with the work done by the Committee of\nNational Liberation, and by the churches, by political party, by groups. And each group was very\nindependent of the other, so that -- for example, since I\u2019m looking at Lydia, one little church in\nDrunago, the priest was wonderful, and he hid people in the belfry. But, it was a network of\npeople. Of course, once in awhile we were caught, once in awhile it was broken, and we lost\npeople. There were deportation, and -- or a book this thick has name of Italian who were\ndeported, and many of them didn\u2019t come back. And some were Jewish, and the other were\nCatholic. And they came from all walk of life, and if you look at -- I -- I think I -- I may have\ngiven it to Stan for those -- but if you look at the ages, you can see, it was truly a popular\nmovement, had all ages, classes, education, or lack of education. Along the river Po, the -- the\nriver, there are boats, and -- there are boats, and the network of people who knew the woods, in\nPavia, in Biyaivino, in Mortara, Novara, it was unbelievable. But again, the churches were very\nimportant, and the confessional were very important. And the people went to the confession, who\nhad never gone to confession before. And they were certainly not confessing sin. It was a mean\nof communication, improvised very often, but what struck me was how people can sum up the\ncourage to do things when they haven\u2019t thought about doing, or they would ever to, or -- or\nregret, and of course, many of them were deported. I remember one woman, a -- a peasant who\nhid in her farm some people, and -- and when her husband was taken -- the reason I went to see\nher, with another member -- another student, was to bring some money, and to wins -- you know,\nsee what she needs, and -- and I always remember, they had been married many years. And she\nsaid, \u201cHe was such a good man.\u201d He was such a good man. I still see her face. Those things, I\ndon\u2019t know. And I got tired in doing my work sometime, I -- I think about those wonderful,\nordinary people. They will never be famous. I can\u2019t even remember her name, but to me, they\nembodied -- people who in my judgement are an ornament to the human spirit. I\u2019m sorry about\nthis, I -- I don\u2019t know. I never saw her again, afterwards. But 1-it -- I like the idea that the\nunderground was so caring about organizing assistance, and -- and thing. Let me clean my nose.",
        "Q: Okay. We\u2019 ll take a break.",
        "A: Unfortunately --",
        "Q: We\u2019re back now.",
        "A: Unfortunately, there were some people among these mass of wonderful, dedicated,\ncourageous people, some people were spies. They were informant, and I am not so sure that it\nwas only ideology. In one of our discussion, 1n trying to understand the infiltrator, in order to\nprevent infiltration in our group, one of the discussion with a doctor, centered on what type of\npersonality we had to be careful about. Not necessarily -- if they -- they are two anti-Naz1, anti-\nFascist, too much, they -- they reminded us of Macbeth, the ladies doth protest too much. And in\n-- some of these senior people were trying to explain to us the factors -- in the human factors,\npsychologically, especially a doctor -- I believe his name is Gross\u00e9, I have to check it, he was\nworking at the Hospitality Niguarda, and he treated a victim of torture, but they were trying to\nexplain to us, in our work, we had to be very careful of some people who would offer, it could\nhave been a trap, they may have -- may have been suspect, and -- but also there are people who\nare so needy of protection, whichever power is in power. And has nothing to do with Fascism, it\ncan be any.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side, B",
        "Q: This is tape number three, side B, wi -- and we interrupted. You were ending with people who\nwa -- needed to be protected no matter what the power was. Yeah?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And they -- who will offer their services. Some are psychopaths, no question. People who --\nwho used torture, for example. Many of the high ranking people didn\u2019t touch themselve the\nprisoner, they had these thugs in the interrogation places who did the dirty work. And la -- later\non in my own experience, many -- th-the officer was content to serve these people. But they\nneeded them, they used them, and but o -- whether our senior were teaching us to be very\ncareful, and try to explain to us why we should be very careful of such people, because in\nworking in the underground, you have people who come and offer, and then you always pretend\nthat you don\u2019t know anything about it, you don\u2019t know whats they are talking about, you know,\nbecause it could be a trap. And I thought there ta -- a-and they always came suggested by\nsomebody that you knew. So, you always pretended you don\u2019t know anything about it, and then\nyou say, \u201cOh maybe we see each other some other time, but you know, I can\u2019t help you, I cannot\ndo anything,\u201d etcetera, etcet -- then you check with the other people.

        "A: Chess game, you know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: To go and [indecipherable] and this. The churches, by and large, were reliable, I would say,\nup to 90 percent. But even so, 10 percent of people who were not reliable, but also if the SS, the\nGestapo, and the Black Brigade went to their church regularly. And there were Catholic the\nNazi, who went to church regularly, who attended the service, who became friend with the priest.\nAnd according to the priest, you know, it was just s-serving a Christian. Now, what I also learned\nwas there was some educated German Christian, who were helpful to us. Very, very helpful. And\nthe way we communicated was in Latin. Heh, heh, heh, don\u2019t speak German. But in Latin we\ncould communicate. And needless to say, we checked and counterchecked. But some German\nregular army people were very helpful.",
        "Q: Were there a lot of people, young kids your age, teenager, 16 - 17 years old -- I mean, how --\nhow many people -- I -- I know you don\u2019t know how many people were in the entire group, but\nin the immediate group that you were working in?",
        "A: Probably approximately 100.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But, we knew th -- each family. We n -- cousin, rela -- friends, and like let\u2019s say, these 20, for\nexample, they had a wonderful property in Piedmont. They could hide people, they were also\nupper class. And they could shelter people, but also, they were respected people. Enrico\nMullisanno, the family Mullisanno, highly respected. Now, the Ritsini were from monarchy\netcetera, but highly respected. So their son -- they have a son Enrico, and they knew people. Now\nthe Mullisanno daughter were two years old, and four years old. But their cousin in social circle,\npeople that you have known for a long time -- and you knew very much who was a Fascist, more\nor less. That the pro SS and Gestapo, there were very few upper class, or well-educated people.\nMany of the upper class Italian joined the resi -- supported the Resistance, because of the allies,\nbecause of the British. Not necessarily for the American [indecipherable]. Max Salvadore was an\nital -- an American -- Italian American, he work with the British Intelligence Services. He had\nloads of contact in Italy. And some other prominent exile, anti-Fascist Italian, had contact with\nItalian intellectual and aristocracy, or banking. Banking was another area, and industry was\nanother air -- marini, [indecipherable] one of them was. Either way, they had contact then they\nkept, regardless of the war, like in -- Switzerland was the place where they could meet. And\nthat\u2019s where Bustelli, and Lydia, and others came, so -- were so important to that. In Switzerland,\nnobody mentioned, then Switzerland allowed many Jewish people, not always, some were sent\nback, and were killed. But in the Teechino area, where Bustelli was, they had the resi -- this.\nSeptember, 1943, when the disaster occurred, the Armistice, the Swiss allowed the Italian Army\npeople to take refuge in camps in Switzerland. And those camps were -- many people were\nexpert in military affair, as well as Intelligence, as well as Morse code, and things like that. So,\neventually, some Intelligent people, with the help of Italian, likes Max Salvadore for example,\nand later on Max Gorbol, they recruited people from these camps. And Aurora Wilomin who\ndied, was executed, she used to go and get the people who had been selected, to bring back to\nItaly, to help in the undergrounds. That\u2019s one important ti -- who did the communication?\nHousewife, farmer, student, children. They killed a young boy in Piazzo Larret, I believe he was\n14 years old, was a messenger -- was a stuffetta. You know, it\u2019s -- and the camps, the military\ncamps were very important in Switzerland, also the object of penetration by the Nazi. In fact, the\nNazi Fascist sent spies to 1 -- to get information about who was selected to come to Italy. And\nonce again, Lydia, Bustelli, and -- and all -- and the network of people, were very important in\nthe communication. And a communication from one post to the other was done by either women,\nor boys, or girl. In bicycle, on a horse, cart, or whatever. So it was -- [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Is -- is that wa -- because they were less suspect?",
        "A: Well, the Nazi and Fascist were suspa -- suspecting everybody. After all, remember that while\nwe do it -- the peaceful work in assistance, there was also the underground then blew up the\nrailway, blew up the partisan -- the Italian partisan, the band then -- then formed after September,\nthey attack German and Nazi Fascist post in order to get arms, because they didn\u2019t have much.\nSo they would organize, and some of the people who joined the partisan had been professional\nmilitary people, particularly the Alpini in Baldosta, the Alpini, who were very good at climbing,\nwho were very good at exercise, and -- and the German and the Nazi Fascist were determined to\n-- to get rid of them. But communication could not done by telephone, or t -- or e-mail, you\nknow. Everything was done by voice, at most one page. But it was very, very, very serious. And\nthat was rare, terribly rare. And code. We had one pad code, and I got it that once it was used, it\ngoes in the wastepaper basket, because that was the most secure way of communicating. I need a\nbreak.",
        "Q: Okay, we\u2019re going to take a break. We are now back from our break. Ginetta, when I asked\nyou where -- where you were living, you were talking about living apart from your parents after\n1943, but I gather in 1941, you were -- when you -- when you went -- started working with the\nResistance, you were living with your parents. Can you describe --",
        "A: Yes, I -- I was living w-with my parents in Milan, and I was able to see also my nurse, my\nwet nurse, in the countryside. And we stayed in the countryside, because the mil -- Milan was\nbombed night after night by the ally, especially August 1943, lots of bombing took place, and so\nwe rented a place in the country, and I could see also my wet nurse, th -- at a farm, like many\nthousand of Milanese, because many of the building were destroyed by the bombing.\nTransportations was destroyed. The building blocked streets, bi -- the ma -- the -- when they\nwere bombed, all the material, the -- the rubbles. Or whether [phone ringing]. Oh dear.",
        "Q: Okay, we\u2019re back from our telephone break.",
        "A: Okay, now, at that time, July, August, af-after the Mussolini fell, it was chaotic in Milan, and\nin addition to the kills -- political kills, there were the bombing by the allied, especially in\nAugust, 1943, and waves after waves of bomber came, and we stayed in the countryside. And we\ncould see at night the city of Milan, red -- th-the sky was red, and hear all these airplane, and you\nknow, you understand that in order to end this war, they had to bomb, because once again,\nalthough Mussolini was gone, Badoglio took over the government, Badoglio with the king, and\nhe said, la guerra continma, and it was not an -- so people had to get out of the cities or industrial\ncenters, even nearby, like sise to San Giovanni or other, and find places in the country, it was\nhorrible. The transportation was not working, the train were packed, whatever, it all -- it was\nterrible. But we lived outside, and then we came back, around the beginning of September, to\nMilan, and it was at that time that -- and my parents told me that if anything should happen, and\nthere should be a ashugamano, a ashugamano, this is to dry your hands, a -- a cloth, on the\nwindow, I should not go home, but should go and see Enrico Mullisanno if possible, or -- so, on\nSeptember, my mother gave me some money to buy some sweater from Louisa Spanoli, which is\nstill existing, and it was going back to school, to prepare for going back to school possibly, but\neverything was in chaos. And I went, and I had this money, and the store was closed, so I had\nthis cash on me. And then when I arrived home, I saw the ashugamano on the window, and there\nwas a black car. And we call them the black maria, which were car used by the police to pick up\nJewish people, or anti-Fascist. And we had, in a family living nearby, and the father simply had\nvanished. And in August, in spite of the bombing, my father had asked me to drive his car, a\nsmall car, to drive the children of this family, to Valdentelvi, and stay with our friend Hua\nPastore, and bring the children to Switzerland with the help of Tonio, who was a smuggler, and\nthe Pastore, who were dear, dear friend, an elderly couple who [indecipherable] known for many,\nmany, many years. And try to do what I could. He gave me some money, and you know -- then,\nin September, I realized I couldn\u2019t go home, so it was getting late, and there was a curfew, so I --\nthere was a bombed out building, and I remember a -- something dangling, chair, or something\ndangling with the floor from the ceiling, and it was a bombed out place, and I -- it was getting\nlate, I felt like crying, so I stayed in that place instead of trying to go all the way to Viatalaggio,\nwhere the Mullisanno lived, because I realized it would have been too far away to go, and I may\nnot make it, and the city was literally in chaos. The Fascists were beginning to look all over the\nplace for young people. The military people were trying to shed their uniform, be on civilian\nclothes, and trying to find a place to escape, and there were thousand of people in Milan in that\nsituation, when the armistice was announced. Nevertheless, the police were still hunting people.\nAnd -- and that was the last time, I -- I was never able to see my parents again after that, but then\nEnrico, and Mary, and all the other really embraced me, and -- and also, there were some funds,\nin cash then were available, but the underground, the Resistance took care of paying the rent,\nproviding minimum for food, clothes. Clothes were very difficult, everything was coupons, for\nfood, coupon for this, coupon for that, and with the armistice, the king, Badoglio, and the\ngovernment fled to the south, leaving the people, the navy, the army, the air force in shamble.\nThe headquarter of the air force, where I had been working with Enrico, all these officers, they\ntried to take as much documentation as they could, so we were helping to put away stuff, and\nprevent looting. But people came in and too -- and looted everything they could. It was a horror,\nand few people can imagine what it means for a government allied with a country, like the Italian\ngovernment allied with the Germans, and then have an armistice with the ally, who are the\nenemy, the American, and the British, and the other, and flee, leaving the people, the armed\nforces of all, asbandati, alone. And the German had already suspected the armistice would come,\nand therefore quietly had already beg -- not quietly, everybody knew it. They began sending via\nthe Brenner Pass, SS, Gestapo Panzer. And they are prepared the plan to take a -- intensify the\ncleaning -- ethnic cleaning of the Jewish people. Simultaneously to arrest all the people who\nwere suspect of being anti-Fascist, and anti-Nazi. And then, of course, to capture all people who\nhad been in the navy, air force, army, or armed force, everybody, to be deported for labor --\nallegedly, for labor, to Germany. So again, they used their tru -- th-the railway, not to help\npeople to come back into the city, or send them ba -- to transport [indecipherable] people than\nthey took, allegedly for labor, and the immediate work of the Resistance was to organize\nassistance. And that organization was -- POW was let out of the camps. When I met Leo Valiani,\nand spoke to him, as well as I spoke to Ricardo Lombardi and others, \u201cHow many people did the\nItalian ordinary people help to escape?\u201d And he said, \u201cPrissipoco diachemila.\u201d App-\nApproximately 10,000 people, which did not surprise me. But people immediately helping\neverybody. The -- the Italian military of all, air force, navy, mari, everybody, army. Jewish\npeople, and a lot of POW, who were let out of the camps, the camps were open, the prisoner of\nwar were open, and so these young people, these prisoner, young and middle aged, disbanded all\nover they could go, seeking -- hiding in the farm, and every place, because the German began\nimmediately trying to recapture them, and force the Italian military -- of military age, who had\nbeen in the services, immediately recruited them for deportation to Germany, allegedly for --\nthey were rebuilding things. So, it was chaos.",
        "Q: In this chaos, were you in danger because your parents were picked up? Were they looking\nfor you, or didn\u2019t they know you existed?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think they knew I existed at that time. But, it -- the Mullisanno, the Ritsini,\nContamessa, and everybody else, who had alre -- was already organized with groups in the\nunderground, already, but immediately they said, \u201cNever go near your place, never go near your\nnurse, never go near your close friend.\u201d No sisamide, we don\u2019t know. And above all, there was\nthe work of organizing assistance, and that\u2019s what we focused on, immediate assistance, because\nstreets were blocked by the German tank, few days, and they were looking for young people, for\nyoung men, ital -- and for Jewish people, and our job was to work with hundreds of other ch --\nyoung children, women, men, to be the mobile telephone, human telephone from block to block,\nand the German are blocking the Immocatcho, they [indecipherable], the German are blocking\nsuch and such a street. The German are blocking such and such a street, etcetera. And to help\npeople escape off -- unfortunately many were caught, because there was no way we could find\ncivilian clothes for everybody, so we did the best we could. As far as POW, was e -- very\ndifficult, because the shoes never fit, the clothes were too sm-small for those tall -- especially\nAustralian, or -- but they w -- there were woods around the city, around Milan, Pavia, Biyaivano,\nthere were woods, so many of the people were trying to escape, escaped to woods, and then there\nwere farms, and then there were convents. Some convents, for example, were pilgrim at -- used\nto go through and find shelter to go to Rome, or whatever. [indecipherable] became places where\npeople could find some shelter, temporary, of course, and then the Swiss border. The Swiss\nborder was our salvation in many way. And that\u2019s when the smuggler, who had made a living\nwith smuggling, with contrabando for centuries, they knew where every passage was. And they,\nwith very few exception, all of -- with few exception, they became our greatest helper. Men,\nwomen, children, 1t was an im -- unimaginable display of the solidarity of the human spirit.\nNeedless to say, unfortunately, they were all saying filtrator, o-or infiltrated themself with the\nmilitary in the Swiss camp, which were made available to the Italian Army, Navy, Air Force, and\n-- and specialists. But by and large, it was a message of how ordinary people did a s --\nextraordinary thing, in extraordinary, difficult times.",
        "Q: Ca-Can you describe taking people through the border? What was that like?",
        "A: Well, it was not easy, because you had to have -- first of all, you would be -- I mean, we\u2019re\nseveral places where we were living, working, hiding, and only the central group knew how to\nreach us, and the stuffetta, like I can mention one, Nino Benedetti, for example, he was only 15\nor 16, he was extraordinary, Jako Padentichay, Meno Scapolla, or me -- and many f -- children of\nFrance, in cri -- 12 - 13 - 14- 15, and women. And [indecipherable] people, old people, young pe\n-- it was a -- they would be sent to communicate with this church, with this convent, with this\nfarm, with this office, and say there are two paci, tre paci, une paco. Paco was the word for a\nperson, so, chi serrano tre paci, kari verrano en Viama Kerajoya. Well, three packages, which\nwere [indecipherable] Kerajoya, they didn\u2019t tell us how tall they were, how fat or thin, or young,\nor old. And so the most important thing was trying to have food, which was very, very scarce.\nAnd here I have to tell a story, because it\u2019s really -- we can laugh. The Fascist had a habit of\npreaching that we had to sacrifice for the welfare of the country, and we have to stick to your\nration, etcetera, but we all knew then some -- not all, some were very honest, some believed in\nFascism, and there were some who were very corrupt people. And when you have a dictatorship,\nyou will always have corrupt people. And we knew then very often, they arrested people who\nhad nagotsi a store of fromage, fr -- cheese and salami, and prosciutti, but who were rationed,\neverything was rationed, or brought in from the countryside, and there were often rice subtracted\nto the forced giving than the Fascists had implemented at that time. You must give this, you\nmake -- you work, and you produce five sacks of rice, well, one has to go to the government, and\nthey came, and th -- to the farm, and looked, and -- and checked, and counterchecked, and if a\nfarmer had not pr -- given everything, and they found something, it was the prison. And\ndeportation even at -- ot [indecipherable]. Well, what we did, we found that one of these Fascists\nhad a kashaday, a cellar full of food. Salami, cheese, so one -- Guido was his name, he and others\norg -- first of all, they requisitioned a truck from the Fascists, pretending to be Fascists. Then\nthey went to this place, and they loaded everything they could find, and believe me, there was\nsalami and cheese, prosciutto, and you name it, it was incredible. Butter, scarce as one can be.\nFarina for polenta, rice. Anyway, they made it available to us to use for the people who were\nhiding, and I must confess, and I was very happy. I know then you don\u2019t steal, but in these\nparticular circumstances, I was very happy. And this is some of the food that we actually use,\nand we stored it with the help of Mrs. Columbo in the cellar, where we could share it with other -\n- and I have to confess that I gorged myself too.",
        "Q: And how did people get to you?",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: I mean, h -- how was the network?",
        "A: It was a -- it was a network of people, I wouldn\u2019t know the name of the people who brought --\nlet\u2019s say -- let\u2019s take Viama Kerajoya, although I can -- there were many other places, I\u2019m using\nthis as an example. Quickly, we were given three apartments in this building, and plus another\napartment in Viama Kerajoya, in another building. And when we got the notice duo paci, tre\npaci, etcetera, the only apartment we could not use ourself, but was used by the underground,\nwas the fifth floor. And we stay away from that. Well, we would get from the potinaya, from the\nconcierge, this little note that there would be duo paci, tre paci, quattro paci, and we would have\nsomebody staying all the time. And these were like -- for example, this girl, I don\u2019t remember\nher name, except then she was lame. I can\u2019t remember her name now. She died of TB later, after\nthe war. But there was a whole group of children, of friends, women, old men, and everybody\ntook turn, but then it was us who were familiar with the border, who had to take the person to the\nnext step. And for me, it was Aljanio, or 1t was Como, and not just for me, but for all the friends\nin the group of the mountains. These would be mountain loving people that young -- young girl,\nlike all that group then, is gone now.",

        "Q: This is United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ginetta Sagan, conducted\nby Joan Ringleheim, on September 24\"\", 1999, in Atherton, California. This is tape number four,\nside A. Ginetta, you wanted to speak about a sort of double person.",
        "A: Well, one of the difficulty we had in the underground was that we always had to be careful\nabout infiltrator into our group of assistance to the prisoner. And we have to remember that we\nassisted family and prisoner. There were people who were working, helping the war effort, for\nthe allies, for the Committee of National Liberation in Milan, and elsewhere. Torino, Valdosta,\nval -- everyplace. And one of the difficulty we had was when a person was taken, the\ninterrogation in depth, which meant torture, led to picking up other people. And I would never\nblame anyone for speaking under torture, because it\u2019s unbelievable the horror than they can\nperpetrate on human being. One of the places in Milan where the prisoner were taken was San\nVittory, and there was a special section which was controlled by the SS, and the moti. The SS\nhad control of the prisoner brought there. Usually their major interest was 1n information, people\nwho are work -- working to gather information useful to the allies in the war effort. One of the\nkey people in that accession of the SS, was named Hugo Osteria. Hugo Osteria had been a\npoliceman -- political policeman for the Ovra, the secret police of Mussolini, or the Fascists,\nthroughout that period. And when, after September eight, the -- he began working for the SS, and\nthe Gestapo in San Vittory, in the section specialized in -- in interrogation. Besides Hugo\nOsteria, there was a -- a man, whose name was Franz, and he had huge dogs that he didn\u2019t mind\nunleashing on the prisoner. And another, Sawecki, something like that, s -- li -- Sawecki -- s -- I\ncan\u2019t remember the spelling, Sawecki. He was an SS captain. Hugo Osteria was the interpreter\nfor the SS, for the Gestapo in that particular area. So, he approached the committee of National\nLiberation, and said, \u201cI want to help you.\u201d So he would give us the name of the people detained\nin the particular area if he could, and also to let us know what was happening. Needless to say,\nwe had other sources, mostly the suarai, the nun, the doctor, being careful, but was one. The\nbaker was another one who was very helpful. And -- but Hugo Osteria became important. So,\nwhat he did was sometime he let people be tortured, deported to Germany. Among them was\nJainjo Bamphi, the brother of Senator Arialdo Bamphi, a-and the husband of Mrs. Bamphi,\nwhom I met, and she described that it was Hugo Osteria who arrested Jainjo Bamphi in their\nhome. So Julianna -- Julia Bamphi told me he played the double game, because he helps them,\nand he help usually important people, of the Committee of National Liberation, like Ferucho\nParai, then later on, at the end of the war, would testify on his behalf. But many other people,\nlike Jako Perdenti, Cheenira Scapolla, and Jainjo Bamphi were not only tortured, but then\ndeported to Mauthausen, where they died. And this was typical of this man, and other working\nfor the Nazi and the Fascist. Then they would give the Committee of National Liberation, and the\nchurch, information about certain prisoner, or arrange for money to be paid to somebody by\nsome family desperate to get help for their prisoner. But essentially, you never knew. Certainly\nshe never trusted them, and eventually the allies decided that this man was so unreliable that he\nhad to be shipped in the southern part of Italy. And Bustelli told me how he -- he was a S-Swiss\nIntelligent Services, how he, personally felt for a long time than this man was a prototype of\npolitsiato, political politsiato, never to be trusted, that he would give some help when it was\npossibly beneficial for him in the future, in the political settlement after the war. But helped to\narrest people, did a lot of damage, used informer, and unfortunately, because of the double game,\nmanaged to gain the trust of some people in the underground, which led to disastrous results.\nYeah.",
        "Q: I\u2019m taking a break. We\u2019re back from our break.",
        "A: But you can understand why I just don\u2019t want to [inaudible]. Excuse me. I wanted Hugo\nOsteria to be known as a skunk. But we have also cristori, police chief, who were asked to keep\ntheir job. It was very important than they stayed where they were. They had access to curfew\npaper, so that people could say, I\u2019m a doctor, I\u2019m a nurse, I need to travel after the curfew is\nimplemented, and were very helpful. One of the first thing when the Committee of National\nLiberation did was to have false identity card made for various people, Jewish, Catholic, the\npeople working in the underground, and -- so, there was this man, whose name was Joe\nBacigalupi. I don\u2019t know where he came from, except that he was wonderful. Joe Bacigalupi\nwork with the Committee of National Liberation, and he was a genius. What he did, according to\nmy friend in the Resistance movement, and I was the beneficiary of his work for our people,\nwhat he did was to say to the cristori, \u201cLook, this was is going to be won by the allies, not by the\nFascists. If you help us, we will help you, and many other people.\u201d Now, I don\u2019t know why they\n-- he needed help, I have no idea, I don\u2019t know. What they asked him to do was to -- the\nunderground asked him to ask the cristori for a list of the best forgerer, who had been either in\nprison in Milan, or were in prison because of forgery. So Joe Bacigalupi became the number one\nspecialist in doing forged document. And was an enormous help, because we helped, working as\ncleaning people, cleaning floor, latrine, and other, for the Fascist, and for the German. And\nbecause you are a cleaner, doing meaning job, they don\u2019t consider you a person who has hear,\nand -- you know, all what they knew was that we were cleaner, perfect beggar, peasant, and --\nand they would talk quite freely around people, because they didn\u2019t think that we wa -- but\namong all, was to steal. To steal some blank -- blank paper which were the koolfer -- call curfew\nfor the lushapasari. And that was very important, because --",
        "Q: What 1 -- what is luss --",
        "A: Lushapasari means those papers, official paper that allowed people to travel after curfew was\nimplemented. But then it happen -- Joe Bacigalupi, and the team of forgerer, when they had this,\nthen it was their job to duplicate, raticate, etcetera, and make it available, and there was some for\nthe doctor, some for the people of assistance, and many -- false, of course, but the German\ncaught on of that. So every once in awhile, every two or three months, and they would change\nthe papers. So here we go, the cleaning lady, the cleaning ti -- di -- or boys, or whatever, and --\nand we had to take some more, or sometime we worked as cleaning lady from some Fascist and\nonners, and get some more, but Joe Bacigalupi, and with the cooperation of the cristori, the\npoliceman, whoever, he managed to get the list of all the forgerer. He was best forgerer in -- in\nMilan, and for other paper. We were told at that time, that the allied in Switzerland had botched a\njob of duplicating false paper, which caused immediately the arrest of the two people who were\ncarrying this false paper into Italy from Switzerland, so Joe Bacigalupi said, \u201cDamn it, how\nstupid. Those allies my have much money and all that, but they don\u2019t know how to do things.\u201d\nAnd he was right. Eventually he was arrested. Eventually, with the help of the inside guard, a\nkey was left unattended, so that he could walk out at lunchtime when everybody was busy eating.\nSo this is some of my recollection. And then of course, his paper were very important for people\nto bring to Switzerland, and all people were sent from Switzerland. But then, in Switzerland too,\nwe had a problem. On one point, an infiltrator, I believe his name was Cherasa, but I\u2019m not\ncertain. I believe so. He managed to go into one of these camps for Italian military, where he\nlearned about plans by the allies, and -- to get people out, and he managed to get out and report\nto the -- San Vittory, to Hugo, and to the other group, what this Italian prisoner in the Swiss\ncamp were planning, how they were selecting specialists, be the kind of job then that Aurora did\nin bringing back into Italy these people to help in the underground, cause the ally needed help\nwith specialists in demolition, for railway, for bridges, and so some Italian were very happy to\nget out of the camp, and help the allies to -- to do these kind of jobs. So you needed people to be\nvery careful in the camps because of infiltrator, like this Cherasa, who they managed to get out,\nand go to report to Hugo, and to these people. And you needed specialists in demolition, se --\nothers. But the reason I think about Aurora was that here was a young woman in her 20, who\ngave her life to help.",

        "A: -- while the churches were sheltering the people to be passed. So Lydia was organizing the\ndinners. And at first the Austrian were very easy. Then, the German realized that -- what was\nhappening, and instead of sending all the -- Austria, and they began sending SS. And true, they\nwere SS who may have been f -- wounded on other fronts, but they were SS. And then they\nbegan to patrol with the dogs. And then it became more and more difficult, but we had the help\nof Bustelli and all the Swiss. Bustelli realized that his office had been infiltrated, it was\nsomebody, ba -- so he began talking to the -- not only to Lydia, but all to the smuggler in the\ndialect of the Teecheeno, which is incomprehensible to many people. And the day Leonard and I\nvisited him, he -- he wrote a poem which I have in dialect, in my file. But he ro -- the whole area,\nthe churches, the smuggler, the farmer, the pe -- everybody was --",
        "Q: It was hilar --",
        "A: -- helping, and on the other side, there were the Swiss. So I am aware then the Swiss kept\nmoney from the Jewish people, but I want to thank the Swiss people, who helped so much, not\nonly with the border crossing, but also in the camps. I mean, there were some good people, and\nthey deserve recognition for their courage. Now the dogs became a problem, and I want to\nmention what Lydia said, pass the words that we had to carry precious little ground meat. Inside\nthere was a pill for the dogs, and above all, not to show fear. Lie down, pretend to sleep, leave\nthe meat available right next to you, and as soon as the dog gulps that down, then the dog goes to\nsleep. Again, these are thing that we had no idea, but she and the network working with her, and\nthe network with erking in Milan, all together, taught us. We were really greens on this matter.\nBut the farmer, and the Pastore deser -- an-and then there was the guardida finansa, who were the\nItalian treasuries. Some of them remained faithful to Fascist, but few of them. The others all\nhelped. So that when passages had to be done, organized by a, the network of the smart lerrer,\nand both Lydia from the Italian point, and Bustelli from the Swiss point, but there were a\nthousand of people working in the whole network. Then, it was very important in the guardida\nfinansa, the Italian one, would turn their back so that we could do it. One of our job was to patch\nthe holes. Now, the arrangement for passing between Bustelli, and Lydia, and their network,\nbecause obviously, was big network, was done by arrangement with special bell put on the collar\nof the goats. And the signal of the bell suggested the place of passing. It was an organization, but\nthe -- of course, we have to remember, the smuggler have been there for thousand of years. After\nthe war, they became restaurant owner, bar owner, and we had the joy of meeting, my husband\nand I, and my son, actually, as well, and dot -- and granddaughter, we went to meet one of them\nin the Easala comatchina, on the Lake of Como, where there is a marvelous restaurant, and is run\nby s -- former smuggler, and their children, and their sa -- children now of course in their 40 and\n50. So it\u2019s really an homage to ordinary people once again, but this woman deserve special\nrecognition for --",
        "Q: You mean Lydia.",
        "A: Lydia. She -- I believe she never went beyond the third grade, but her capacity for organizing\nwas incredible. Also her courage, and there are stories that we don\u2019t have time to go into it, but\none brief one was that on one occasion, a man than she taught was with us, sent by the\nCommittee of National Liberation in Milan. Turned out that he -- she helped him to go to the\nmilitary camp. From there he learned a great deal, then he -- and then he came back and started\nher home, and she realized that he was a Nazi. At this point, two partisan came at her home, with\nguns. And this man, of course, also could do something. And Lydia said to the two partisan,\n\u201cPlease, please, I have two small daughter. If you kill him, then the whole village will be burned.\nEverything will be burned, and we will lose everything. So please go away, go away.\u201d And they\ndid. So this Nazi man took Lydia to Milan, probably to the SS, she doesn\u2019t know where they\ntook her. They sat her in a room where they gave her a big meal, and she thought this was her\nlast supper. Then somebody came, took her by train back to Ronaggo, to the train station, gave\nher a note. Inside there was two gold coins, one for each of her daughter, and a little note. \u201cYou\nsaved my life, I am now saved yours. But there will be no next time.\u201d So Lydia was so terrified\nby this experience, that she went to the home in the Swiss side of a friend and very active\nmember of the underground, and she went to sleep. And when she woke up -- these man had the\npenchant for putting mask with colored lights all over around the room. So when she woke up,\nshe saw all these mask with all these lights, and she screamed, \u201cAyuto, ayuto, ayuto.\u201d And -- and\nall of a sudden, a -- several young men in trunk, because it was hot, arrived, beautiful young men\nwho were waiting to pass through the Italian-Swiss border, to come to Italy to work. And she\nsaid to me, \u201cWell, when I saw all those beautiful young men, I thought, if this is hell,\u2019 because\nshe thought she was in hell, ayuto, \u201cif this is hell, I will stay.\u201d",
        "Q: And what is -- what is ayuto?",
        "A: Ayuto means help, help.",
        "Q: Aha.",
        "A: So Shirley Dondr\u00e9a came with me, and we went with -- you know, with Lydia, we saw this\nbeautiful villa. The owner was working with the underground, but he was also a major\nentrepreneur, traffic dinart, the Swiss knew it. But when he died, he left everything to Lydia, and\n-- because she helped, saved his life many times. But anyway, this Shirley and I -- I think Shirley\ntook a -- pictures of this room with all the mask, with the colored light, and so we had a jolly\ngood laugh at that time, and realized that the war was really over, we could talk about it.",
        "Q: Did you see Lydia much during the -- during the war?",
        "A: Oh -- oh no.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No, far from it. We knew about the famous Lydia, but -- she did other things that are\nincredible, such as she dressed like a bride, with a man dressed like a groom. From Milan they\nretrieved very precious material which was on a truck. And dressed like a bride and a groom,\nthey crossed the borders, raising her sk-skirt flirtatiously with the German border, and then as\nsoon as they arrived, then she has a -- a str -- tremendous number of people who came out of the\nwoods to help unload the truck, because it cor -- contained precious material than the Swiss\ncould not get. And so Bustelli commissioned her to organize from Milan, this truck, loaded with\nthis precious material, dressed like a bride, cross the border with a groom, and then as soon as\nthey were on the other side, say this band of bandits -- I mean no, they were -- came out, and\napparently, from what I learned from others, she had a stick and ran and said, \u201cFaster, faster,\nfaster, get it out.\u201d Because they were afraid then the German would realize the trick, and go after\nthem.

        "A: About who?",
        "Q: Your arrest. When they picked you up.",
        "A: Oh. Because our friend -- well, first of all, I was sent in Valdosta. Now this is important. I\nhave written about it. One of the underground activity was to organize people, sometime to go\nand evaluate the disaster made by certain destroy policy, by the Nazi in the valley, where we had\nso many partisan. And in Valdosta, in particularly Valtoonage, there was a very important group\nled by Usmiani, called the U16, Usmiani. And Buerkio. Buerkio was the professor at the\nUniversity of Pavia. And he had access to my apartment, in fact, he personally often came on\nemergency, for instruction, also for training, for other people involved, into valdo -- Valdosta,\nand other, where the eevrie adeeoli veti company. The people at the high level, chief executive\nofficer, and others, all these people had homes in -- in Cherveenia for skiing, in the valleys. That\nwas normal. But was also a center, in Valtoonage, for transmitting to the allies, informations via\nthese whom -- I didn\u2019t know who it was. However, I was told that after the Rustellimenti, there\nwas this page, then -- there is one page that you can copy, there was a frantic telephone call -- not\ntelephono, some me -- some message, radio, whatever, I don\u2019t know exactly, to the Committee of\nNational Liberation saying why the Germans -- the Nazi are negotiating in oursta with the\nchurch, and the representative of the partisan bands, or the truvalai, bartonunch, valdayass,\ndressonai. They are actually already starting towns to go, and people dressed in camouflage,\nincluding some very cruel troops, already starting to catch the partisan on their back -- clean up\nthe valley. So here they were negotiating in oursta. The church in good faith. Tito, or ever, who\nis the commander of the Valtoonage did not go personally, as he was asked to do, but send\nsomebody, because he sensed -- he smelled somebody. So there was this frantic call, or\ncommunication from Valdosta to Milan, to the Committee of National Liberation. The\ninformation had come from -- I was told, from somebody who went to a beauty parlor from our\nside, who heard either a Fascist or a Nazi woman, or mistress, or somebody saying, \u201cOh yeah,\nthey are negotiating with the church, but they are going to clean up. The German are already\nstarted.\u201d Something like that. So, immediately, there was this one page, frantic communication to\nValdosta, it was too late. We lost a lot of people, it was horrible. Many people were killed, and\nthere was a traitor who was working right next to Tito. And when the time came for this person\nto go and give the meecha, the fire to the bridge, so then the tank couldn\u2019t go, he killed the other\nperson with it. So -- and he had been with -- with us for three months and nobody realized that he\nwas a double. But this I confirmed with Monsieur Tiba, when I saw him. And I spoke to Tito a\nfew years ago about all this. So, after this disaster, we lost a lot of people, including young\npeople that we had send up, because they didn\u2019t want to go to Switzerland, they wanted to\nparticipate in the active Resistance movement, so we send them up to the banns. And among\nthem a young man, Hoos Franco from either Maltarra, or Pavia, very close by, but actually, we\nwere involved, our group was involved. Soon after all this disaster occurred, I was told by a\nfriend, member of our group, the Benedetti, who was a mountain climber, and his son was\nworking with us, he wife was working with us, that it was very important to go up to Valtoonage,\nand assess the damage, but more importantly, it was very important to go to the house of\npierovono, one of the guide, one of the Alpinist, and only since last dega -- August, I knew -- I\nlearned that he was part of this special group, like Lashincross, I didn\u2019t know before. As far as\nwe knew, we were all in the underground, working. And these gentlemen, these architect, would\ncome and pick me up at -- sometime early in the morning. He had all the permit, and he had a\nhouse, he owned a home in Chervinia. His name was architect Molino. Never met him in my life,\nbut I was supposed to be his mistress. And, \u201cBut he\u2019s a gentleman, Ginetta, you don\u2019t have to\nworry, but we need somebody to go up with him, he own a house, and he has a perfect reason to\nsee if damage was done, to fix it for the winter, and he has his mistress with him.\u201d And the\nmistress was me. And so jus -- lo and behold, here, in November come this gentleman, and kiss\nmy hand, and I go with him, he had all the passes, everything. And we arrived, traveling to a\nplace called Shationne. Shationne is right at the entrance of the Valtoonage. And we stopped. He\nwas going to place his car someplace in Shantionne, and we had to carry the knapsack. I ask my\nri -- I ask him if I could take a little suitcase, he said, \u201cYeah, if you feel like carrying that plus\nyour knapsack, go ahead,\u201d but, you know, I didn\u2019t bring, I put everything in the knapsack. But\nwe had to bring up some medicine, and we arrive in Shantionne, we go to this little bric and brac\nlittle store. This wonderful woman, Delphina was her name, and we chatted amiably, and then\nthis architect said to me, \u201cGo ahead, because I will catch up with you.\u201d Remember, I was in my\nteen, and he was probably 60, but he was much stronger. So it was obvious that he -- well, I\ndidn\u2019t think much, but 1t was obvious that he wanted to talk to her. Only in retrospect I figured\nall that out, but I didn\u2019t at the time. And we went, and we arrived in Valtoomage, and -- at the\nhouse of this family, and it was a -- all of the women were in black, they were -- well, they broke\ndown crying, because of the horror. And one of them described to me how Franco died. They\nkilled several people. In fact, about 10 years ago, I took a picture of the monument to those\npeople, and we went, and then I realized that we -- we wanted to stay in val -- I wanted to stay in\nValtoomage, and he, no, no, we have to go ahead. We went to Chervinia, and at the passage, at\nthe block passage, there was Italian young Fascist. Very energetic, very ideologically committed\npeople, but he had passes, and they were passes from the Gestapo, the SS, or some authority, and\nimmediately everybody was, oh, please let me help you, blah, blah, blah, and all kind, and -- and\nI thought, oh my God, you know, I -- I trust Benedetti, no -- no -- but at the same time, you are\nstartled. I never met this person, but he was kind. We arrived at his house, I was so tired. He\nhelped me to take off my shoes, made a fire, and gave me something to drink, and -- and then I\nlied down and I slept for awhile, and then he woke me up, and he said, \u201cWe have to go.\u201d And we\nwent to the home -- house owned by Pierovona in the same village. And we ha -- w-we had to\nretrieve some material, which we did, and I had to put them in my chest. Then, next day -- then I\nwent back to bed -- next day, I s -- had to say to the Fascist that were mocking me for being with\nsuch an old man, etcetera, etcetera, that the altitude was not good for me, I had to go back, and\nsay, \u201cOh yeah, this old man is no good, but we are good, come with us,\u201d blah, blah, blah all that\nsuns -- kind of stuff. But they were very helpful. And I was going to walk down, but then they\ndrove me down. And at the val -- at the end, th -- at Shationne, there was a little hotel where I\nwas supposed to stay. When the hotel keeper saw me arrive with this Fascist, he was as cold as\none can be, he said he -- yes, he had a room, but no food, nothing. So, well, I went to -- to the\nbedroom, and about one or two in the morning, there were shots fired in my room, the glass fu --\nso I went under the bed. Until the day before, the -- somebody from the Fascist or the Nazi used\nthis place. So the partisan thought then they were still there, but I was there, so I went under the\nthing. And about oh, few minutes later, some partisan came in with the red ankle chafe, and the\nmachine gun is -- \u201cWhere is she, where 1s she? Oh my God, what we have done?\u201d They knew,\nthey learned that I was there. So, the face of hotel keeper changed completely. He b -- the\npartisan actually, they said, libber, please give her some -- anything. So he brought out cheese\nand wine and bread, and -- and apologized. And then he put some coal in a scarbaletto. Is a\ngadget with a long handle, and inside put the coals, so that his wife warmed up the bed for me. I\nmean, it was such a change. And we -- next morning, I came down and he gave me -- I realized\nhe put something in my knapsack which was very good, cheese and a piece of meat. I arrived\nhome, and the apartment up above was where those two friends, and it was clear that something\nhad happened, the food was left. And so I quickly got out, as well as bring the material to\nViabeeli, and I was told then they were caught. So I began working with Dom Bickuli. And this\nPierro, that I still don\u2019t know, who was an elegant man, working with the cardinal, etcetera. And\nthe idea came, then I had to go and try to find hostages for exchange. That\u2019s little field that I\nhave, 1s one example. And the son of Corvul sent me, because he knew then I had -- we were\ndoing this. And I went north, all the way to another place, to another valley, up to Borneo.\nBorneo Livino. From Banktband with a password at each place, and -- and in Livino, I was told\nthan [indecipherable] for exchange with our friends in Milan. Well, that was February, beginning\nof February. I took the bus, because I couldn\u2019t walk any more, my feet were so swollen. And I\narrived in a place called Tiranno. And in Tiranno, the bus was surrounded, and -- and so that\u2019s\nhow I was arrested. And from Tiranno few days later, that was the brigatanari, to Sondrio. And\nto Sondrio, a very important story, because I saw someone died, and all sorts of thing. And then I\nwas really -- I brought Milan to the mouti, and I was told by a man whose name was Crome that\nI didn\u2019t speak, but they had the means to make me speak. I didn\u2019t doubt it, but I -- but then they\nreleased me because somebody said then, oh no, no, I was not involved. Two hours -- I was still\nblack and blue. Two hours later, one of the people from Sondrio, who had accompanied me to\nthe bi -- mouti in Milan, arrived. And he said, \u201cYou are not working, so you have to come to\nSondrio to work for us.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, I have an appointment with my doctor, because I\nhave some problem with my lungs.\u201d And, \u201cWell, you go and see your doctor and then you come\nback with us.\u201d So I went to the doctor, who was one of us, and the doctor meanwhile, had\narranged for my friend, Enrico Mullisanno to arrive, and they said, \u201cIf you have the courage to\ndo it, we would like you to -- to do it, to go back.\u201d Well, once they arrived back, it was clear that\nit was a ruse, too. And it was -- it\u2019s a long story, but the women of the Black Brigade were as bad\nas the men, and all of us remaining -- one was Bruno Bianci, whom I saw, and his wife was\nkilled, the order came from Mussolini headquarter, from -- that all the people who may have\nbeen involved in Intelligence gathering -- and evidently they sus -- suspected that I was --\nactually turnous, probably they were right, but I -- I didn\u2019t know -- they should be executed. And\nwhat they did was to make a sign that you were there voluntarily. They received a tremendous\namount of brand new money from someplace, and they made a sign than they had given us all\nthis money, when it was in fact they kept it, you know. And they wanted to interrogate me once\nagain, which was, you know, it was the end of the war. But there was something really cruel\nabout -- not all of them, at the point they were ready to be bad, but not all of them. Still holding\non to this -- what they were talk about? The special weapon that the German would use, and\nwould win the war after all, except after April thir -- 23. And they were talking about them, and\nI was on the floor. They didn\u2019t want to leave witnesses to what they had done. It was very\nimportant that I give the name of all our people, it was -- so, they were trying once again. When\nthe telephone rung, and somebody said than the German wanted to talk to me again. Well,\neverything was falling apart, but still they couldn\u2019t get it. And they were very angry that they\ndidn\u2019t dare to say no to the German, they still had an inferiority complex vis a vis of the German,\nI think. That\u2019s my personal impression. And -- and two people dressed in German uniform came\nin, and made jokes about these Italian sissy, that they fall down on the floor, and f -- you -- you\nknow. So the Italian dragged me up, but the German hold -- held me, and they took me out to the\ncar. And from there they took me to the hospital where the nun received me and helped me. But I\nonly learned later there were a number of people involved, not only for me, but for others, and\nGerman deserter was -- were asked to help. To intercept the communication in case the\nbrigatanari, the mouti, would check to see whether it was true, that you still -- no, they didn\u2019t\ntrust anybody. And so these people were risking their lives to -- to help us, to -- to survive. And\nit was from Bustelli, and -- and Lydia that they were part of the organizing with the help, with\nthe guardiri publicani. The guardiri publicani were Italian who were called to serve. If they\ndidn\u2019t, their father, their mother, would be beaten up, so they served, but they were our allies. So\nthere was a number of people involved in rescuing last minute people in the interrogation cells,\nbecause they knew that we would all be executed. And so, for a couple of days, in the hospital,\noh everything, you know, little broth, wonderful care. And -- but for two days, I was hidden, and\nthen one of the people from the underground in that area -- that\u2019s another story, it\u2019s too\ncomplicated, but apparently I saved his life, and, \u201cTorpelino, Torpelino,\u201d and then he came, and -\n- so then they brought me upstair and I was in a bed. I was ca -- I had been cleaned up, and I was\nbeing treated, and I had wonderful care. And then, I have to say, the Italian government did\nsomething that every government today should do for the people who are caught in such\ncircumstances. They took care of all the care, and I was in Sondolo, it is a place, used to be for\nTB only, but we were rec -- put there. And then, from there f -- until September, and then to\nanother place called San Martino di Castrotsa, in the mountains, for winter, and -- and then in\nBaratsai, f -- at the sea for a few months of treatment, and then I went to Scotland, and Paris, and\n-- and --",
        "Q: Ginetta, see -- you were captured in February?",
        "A: February, 1945, beginning of February.",
        "Q: February, 1945.",
        "A: And helped to get out in Apri -- on April 23\", 1945.",
        "Q: So when they were torturing you, was this consistent, every day, was it -- w-was it --",
        "A: No, not every day, but they would do -- not only to me -- and remember, I was just one of\nother people Bianchi. [indecipherable] time they took turn, first him, then me. They had a hand\ngenerator for electricity. And I get upset when some people say, well we have to stop armament,\nbecause that only will stop torture. That\u2019s ridiculous. Torture can be applied in any small unity,\nby any means, by anybody. And -- and I think by doing the -- the other, you divert the attention\nfrom the reality, that any lethal piddling group, can find a way and means to torture people,\nincluding in the prisons. And -- but these were sophisticated matord, and many people didn\u2019t\nmake it. Tiberio Pansini died under torture. And -- but also some people who were there, who\ntried to help. And you know, you could see in their eyes that -- and then of course, they did, they\nhelp you to escape. And also put out the matchbox, you know.",
        "Q: Yes, could you tell that st-story, when you got the matchbox?",
        "A: Well, because one of the point of the SS, the Gestapo, and [indecipherable] other police,\neverywhere, the point is to make the prisoner believe, that no one knows where he or she 1s,\nnobody care, the -- you are 1n their hands, period. And there is a consistent effort to make the\nprisoner believe that you are in their hands, nobody knows where you are, nobody cares. And\none night, one of the guard shouting really bad words for a woman, you know, kicked the door\nopen, and send this panino, that Italian bread, which is empty inside, you know, if you go to\nMilan, you\u2019ll see it. And I pick it up, and it was dark, but I -- we left the door open, but -- so I\nsaw what it was, and -- and then I started eat, I was so hungry. I was also afraid that there may be\nsome poison inside. But there was a matchbox, a tiny cherino. They are called cherini, I\u2019ve never\nseen one so small in the country. They are cherini, and I lit it, and there was this little piece of\npaper, coracho. So I knew. No matter how many time they told me that nobody knows where I\nwas, and I was. But I think it was important because I -- psychologically you feel like giving up.\nThe other thing than they repeat to you day after day, that if you tell what happened to you to\nanybody, we will find you to the end of the earth, you will pay. And it seems to be a deliberate\nconditioning for the prisoner, because they did it on both places, in the tirano and the other. And\na, nobody knows you are here. You are in our hand, we can do what we want, and b, if you tell\nanybody, you -- we\u2019ll find you to the end of the earth, you know, tha -- so, and -- working with\nprisoner later on in Chile, and re -- same thing. Former prisoner, former victim of torture would\ntell me time after time the same thing. And if it was in Greece or Chile, or Brazil, or Italy at that\ntime, or Prague, or the soviet -- the same. So it -- it\u2019s -- there is an institution which is not\nnecessarily taught, but developed by each one, by -- in each country. And I think most important\nthing is to educate the public everywhere, then there was a meaning to the universal declaration\nof human rights, to make sure that see will never happen again to the Jewish people, to the anti-\nFascist, to the anti-Stalin, to everybody else. And so I am glad I survived all these years.",
        "Q: So are we.",
        "A: Yeah. I\u2019ve had the friendship of so many wonderful -- I discovered after the war that I was\nworking with all the top people of the Committee of National Liberation, who, in their turn, were\nso helpful to our work for Amnesty International development. So that\u2019s really another story,\nthan it\u2019s incredible how, because of the friendship of that period, you learn something, but above\nall, they helped to develop organization to help other people.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It was complicated, and at some level, it was also a good life. And one of our circle of frien --\nthe circle of friend, the most important thing was the circle of friends we had, all anti-Fascist,\nand all active in assisting people who had been persecuted by the Fascist party. Yes, Jewish, but\nthe Fascist party was also persecuting people who were anti-Fascist. It just happened that many\nof the anti-Fascist were also intellectual, and intellectual are more likely to be critical. Until\n1938, it wasn\u2019t too difficult. Then, when the Nazi law were adopted by Mussolini, in Italy, there\nwas a great deal of criticism about Mussolini doing that. And yet, the discussion I vaguely\nremember, in our circle of friends, particularly when we went to the mountains, climbed everythi\n-- if it was a day, that it was not very clear, they talked, they talked, they talked about political\nissues, social issues, anti-Fascist persecution. The general atmosphere was that even some\nintellectual had signed some paper approving of Mussolini adopting the Nazi racial law, and that\nwas 1938, so I was pretty young, and to be very honest with you, there were times when I were --\nyes, I was interested, but I wanted to climb, I wanted to hike, I wanted to sing, I wanted to have a\ngood time. I was touched by it. At the same time, I also wanted to have a good time, going to\nlook for ackenberry, for example, in August, and have ackenberry pies, and for -- in the refuge,\nand -- or rather, I have never forgotten that the criticism of the Nazi law was not only done by\neducated people, but there were also a farmer who taught 1-11 pladoni, Mussolini didn\u2019t have\nmuch hair, so they called him il pladoni, he is crazy. He is doing -- you know, why is he doing\nthis, why is he going after the Jews, wh-why is he doing that? And then, in the discussions, and\nas I said, I heard not only within my family, but also in my -- the circle of friends, who were\npersonal friends, all interested in mountain climbing, all interested in going to refugi for hikes.\nNear the lake of Como, there were mountains called Laigreenai, and there were refuges where\nwe went, and we had to carry our food in the back. Ex -- there were some supplies left there,\nbrought by donkey, like polenta, rice, potatoes. But -- and the farmer would have milk, a --\netcetera. And then we would hike, and then the discussions. Yes, there was discussion of movies,\nthere was discussion of theater, there was discussion of opera. There were discussion of work in\nthe factories. There -- but also, there were always political discussions, and invariably, we found\n-- at least I experienced the fact that people had joined the Fascist party because they had to\nwork. Tha -- they were very few who would disagree, and -- and there were big discussions.\n\u201cHey, you stupido, cretino, that you believe in these idiotesa, that is -- we don\u2019t like the\nGerman.\u201d Well, I didn\u2019t like when they said, \u201cI don\u2019t like the German,\u201d generally. I made -- and\nmy parents taught me, and my friend taught me, then -- there has to be a distinction between the\npro-Nazi and the German. And, there was a discussions, very early, about the fact that some\nGerman people, yes, they were Communist, and Socialist, but they were also member of the\nupper class. And some bishops, who, when Hitler began the persecution of the Jewish -- the anti-\nFascist -- anti -- there were Communists, Socialists, and Jews. And it just happened that many\nintellectual were also Jewish. At that time -- I was very young, but I remember the heated\ndiscussions about Hitler, as announced in the press, that he has opened a concentration camp, to\nput those people in. It was very difficult for young people to understand what it meant. The --\nsome of the friends that I had, who were older, mature, and who -- and my parents, they were\naware of the Fascist party having a special tribunal, 1-1 -- where the Fascist didn\u2019t have courts of\nlaw for those anti-Fascist, anti-Nazi -- f -- in Italy, was anti-Fascist, but you understand, then,\nthey were against both. And instead of a court of law, with judges, which of course many of the f\n-- the Fascist had nominated those people, but nevertheless, the special tribunal could\ncondemned anyone, that when that person -- and there were women, too, became quote, suspect,\nthe special tribunal had the special Italian Secret Police, called Ovra, O-v-r-a, to investigate the\nsuspect. And I remember one particular day, when they were discussing this, we couldn\u2019t go up\nclimbing, we couldn\u2019t go hiking, it was raining, and -- and they were discussing all this -- I\nmean, it sounds s-strange thing, that this suspect could be man or the woman, and then the Ovra\ncould pull in, for interrogation, the baker, the priest, the butcher, friends, associates of the work,\nwhether they were engineer, or doctor, or [indecipherable] and, I remember that they were\ntalking about some people were killed, executed. Some people were sent to what was known --\noh, some people to San Vittory prison, something, somebody sent to remote area in Italy, where\nthese people who were intellectual, writer, artist, doctor or lawyer, could not see the family,\nexcept maybe once a year, twice a year, I can\u2019t remember correctly. But they were deprived of\nthe mail, very rarely they could have the mail. They could only receive visits from the family\nvery rarely. In other word, they were denied everything, and whether they were imprisoned in\nSan Vittory, or sent to these remote area, there was the attempt to isolate them from society,\ndeprive them of their professional life, their French -- their family, their friends. And the special\ntribunal had the power to do that, in Italy. But the German, apparently, were doing the same, and\nagain I didn\u2019t understand very clearly, except in Dachau was a place, after 1933, where priest,\nSocialists, Communists, intellectual, could be sent, and the judicial system -- and they talk about\nthe judicial system being damaged. The SS, and the Gestapo took over the function. That meant\nthat it became very arbitrary, also. And I also remember that both in Italy, and I mention, in\nGermany, if some big Fascist liked a woman, sometime they had the man investigated, so -- you\nknow, in other word, an arbitrary, unjust, terribly painful process for the fellow. Now, that\npicture of the special tribunal, those memory of San Vittory, the exiled, 1t remained with me\nforever, for as long as I remember. But at the same time, we -- there was a great deal of joy.\nThere was country, the -- the hikes in the mountains, seldom we went to the sea. Occasionally we\nwent to a place called Paylee, and I learned how to watch the farm -- the fisherman to bring in\nthe fresh fish, and -- and have a meal with them, they made the mayonnaise with the garlic, and\nthe parsley, and I wasn\u2019t cooking at that time, but I watched them there, enjoyed the French\neating, but mountains were the [indecipherable].

But otherwise, y -- and\nthen you just roam around, and in winter it was skiing, but not the skiing of today, where you go\nup and down, up and down, can\u2019t stand that. Th -- the skiing was for sightseeing, for enjoy --\nnow, non-vacation was different. Then, we went to -- went to Nash, we went to Cherbania, and\nthere was one funicular at that time, and we went up to anolder tel colostum becko, and that\nagain was a reunion place. Summer was hiking all over, climbing. And I began climbing with my\nparents and guides. They were very strict about guides. You don\u2019t go up in the mountains\nunprepared, because the mountains, like the sea is very harsh, can be very difficult, so you have\nto be prepared. And then we refuge.",
        "A: Refuge -- refuge? Well, huts where you bring your supply. You melt the snow with Sterno, to\nmake [inaudible], and you bring dry fruits, and a pinyotta. Pinyotta are dry cracker, but very hard\non your teeth, you better have good teeth, or else you are 1n trouble. And, of course, the first day\nor so, you have fresh fruit also, but -- and, for the first day or two, you have slice of rosto\npolarose, but then you drive everything, and whatever. It was fun, it was climbing, it was hiki --\n1-1 -- picotsa, if there was a snow, you use the ice pick, as -- la picotsa, I think. You had the\nscarponi, and so you go to refuge -- let\u2019s take an example, from Shamoni, this was not -- this was\nShamoni, you go to -- by train to Ajohntierre. Ajohntierre you start hiking, I remember cutting it,\nsta -- to your refuge, le refuge de Ajohntierre, and you spend the night there, and the -- often the\nrefuge can offer polenta, or zupa -- soup, or polenta, occasionally risotto, but really polenta is\nmore [indecipherable]. Also, they made, f-fontina [indecipherable], fontina toma. So polenta was\nfontina toma, all fresh, goat cheese, or fresh whatever there was. And you spent the night. And\nit\u2019s wonderful because there is a camaraderie, I think is the word. Easy. Young people talk, talk\nabout theaters and movie, talk about the love, talk about this, talk about that. The serious people\ntalk about -- yes, some politics, or is -- Italian are very yeah, yeah, yeah, talk politics great deal.\nBut, also talk about traveling, talk about culture, talking about booksa, talking about history,\ntalking about the meaning of some opera, for example. And I remember in -- in Ajohntierre,\nwe're talking about a performance in Paris of Don Carlos, and how Verdi had a -- really used\nopera to express the essence of repression, a religious repression. The burning, the -- and then\nthere were discussion over -- on religion, for example, because at that time, Voltaire was a\nprohibited author by the church. So needless to say, we talk about Voltaire, and -- and also, the\npress was controlled. I must confess that at that time, I was far more interested in boys and girls,\nI was far more interested in the mountains, far more interested in having fun, and I had a good\nfriend at that time, that I knew when I was seven, and he was 11, and he -- I heard all this, and I\npaid some attentions, but I must confess that my attention at that time, when I was so young, was\nin the mountains, in the fu -- wildflower. I was crazy about wildflower, I -- I -- we went, as\nfamily and friends, to do le narche zarta, which meant we went to the refuge, and then we picked,\nvery carefully, a bouquet of -- it\u2019s daffodil-like, but white with a little red, little eye, and very\nperfume, not cheesy. And you are taught conservation from day one. And again, in the\nmountains you talk about planning. Let\u2019s go for a narche zarta in Como next spring. We take the\npicnic, we go. Some people work for Las meerbiscoza for factories. What we discovered -- and\nwhile we were talking about fun in mountain, there was a great deal of politics all the time. Now,\nthe best, active people, at the political level, were Socialist, and Communist. Anti-Fascist, many\nof them. And being Communist, but after having been in the prison of Mussolini with the\nCommunists, they changed. They followed the lead of two people, that I didn\u2019t know, and I be --\nwho started a movement called jostitsia en liberta, the Rosselli brother. And they were talking\nabout the Rosselli brother as having taught them how common -- hard line Communism of the\nStalinist-Leninist type was as dangerous as Nazi Fascist, and therefore they wanted, yes,\nSocialism, yes, a just society, due process of law. That was taught by lawyer, like Enrico Enpigi\nall the time, Contamessa -- Rainso Contamessa. Due process of law, fair trial, and then -- and no\nmilitary judges, like the special tribunal. So there was this combination of hat -- la -- Ajohntierre\nwas one. And then we went home sometime for two weeks, from refuge to refuge, refuge to\nrefuge, and guides, always guides. But you have the leisure of enjoying something very much,\nwith a diversified company, from student, and young children, to factory worker, engineer,\nlawyer, professor, doctors, a-academic, some very serious were very angry about the\nacademician who had signed the Nazi manifesto for 1938 duration of Mussolini. And all in good\nhumor, even those who were accused of being -- you are a damn fa -- you are an Fascist stonase,\nc\u2019est une cretino, c\u2019est qui -- the next day we climbed together, we ate together, we -- you know,\nit was not vindictive, it was not nasty -- yes, there were bursts of recrimination, but it didn\u2019t\nbecome so sickening that hate, a -- hate --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, to these days. Perhaps that question should be given to psychiatrists, or other. I\nbelieve then the Italian culture, with so many occupation, for centuries, by so many countries --\nyou know, remember in Sicily, the Swedes were there. In fact, there was a beautiful poem called,\n\u201cCurradino dis vetsia.\u201d And I have never forgotten a small part of that poem. The poem referred\nto a mother, 1n switzer -- in -- in swede -- in sw -- in Sweden. You see, in springtime, a swallow\nreturn, and the mother ask the swallow what coming -- was coming from ita -- from the south,\n\u201cDimi iveesto il filio meo,\u201d Tell me, have you seen my son, who was sent to fight in Sicily? And\nthe swallow answered, \u201cSi, no veesto, erabuendo, erabianco, sotolarko diontempio era\nsaipporto.\u201d Yes, I saw him. He was blonde, he was white, under the arch of a temple he was\nburied. And I remember the discussions around that poem, and I\u2019ve always remembered that\npoem because it emphasized the commonality of human being, but here it was from Sweden\ninvading Sicily, and then of course, we had the Berber invading, and the French, and the\nAustrian invasions. And each invader brought destructions, pain, suffering, but also the need for\nsome people to get together and help each other. And I have a feeling that that common bondage\nof seeing so much suffering, and [indecipherable] destruction the pope\u2019s rector, in Italy one must\n-- I mean, there were powers, and corrupt, and -- so ou -- in one sense you were devout Catholic,\nwent to church, you practice. You had also many skeptics, and the selling of the images, and all\nthose things, were discussed, I mean, they talked about everything. The mountains was a\nteaching place, because of the situation that here you are up in a refuge, and you\u2019re having your\ntime, but I don\u2019t [indecipherable] leisure to talk and think. Not that I understood very well\neverything, far from it. But it\u2019s amazing how later things seems to connect. And I remember\nwhen they were talking about the special tribunal, the prisoner in San Vittory, the persecution of\nthe family. The injustice of having a judicial system with three military judges who had the\npower to bring in everybody to 1 -- to interrogate, intimidate, frighten friends, family, butcher,\nmaid, you name it. And I thought, how can they do that? And yet, there was the other side of\nhelper all the time.",
        "A: Helpers, all the time in San Vittory, which was a prison for criminal, and for political\nprisoners. And the political prisoner, I think Grandshe may have also been there, they had a great\ndeal of help from the suaray. First of all, the sister were there, the doctors. And the suaray play, a\n-- were nurses at the time. And inside -- and these were people hired by the Fascist party, but we\nalways found people -- the bakers, God bless the bakers -- we always found people who could\nhelp. I have the feeling, listening from the discussion, from my parents, from Enrico\n[indecipherable], all those people, that in Italy, it was easier to help than it was possible to do in\naust -- in Germany. In -- 1-in Nazi Germany, they in fact, destroyed all of the antique -- Nazi --\nmuch more easily than they could in Italy, and I think it may have to do something -- but again,\nI\u2019m not a historian, I\u2019m a re -- an ordinary woman. My feeling, listening to the other, was that the\nGerman were cultured, music, but also disciplinarian. And they treated children with 11\nmaganello, with a stick, as they grew up. And therefore, that could have had an influence in the\nrigidity of behavior of that particular -- of -- of the German, that although there was resistance by\nsome in the church, by intellectual, like Bunoffer, but, in the resistance had networks, mostly of\nCommunists, and Socialists. They were wiped out. They didn\u2019t have the support than their\ncounterpart in Italy had from the general population. And we split, within the church.",
        "A: Well, first I had to work very hard, and studying. It\u2019s okay to have fun, but you study. And I\nhad a -- oh, for two years, when we lived in this place, which was called Santangelo de Jarno, I\nhad -- and I lived with a family -- my family, but als -- came very often, but I also had this\nwonderful family who was Istytotwiss. And yes, I went to school in the elementary year, and I\nhad marvelous teacher. Her name was Bentivania Lucia, and then she married a man whose\nname was Negrini. And I think they were anti-Fascist, but in school, the subject, history, writing,\nreading, she was very good, and just marvelous. She would inspire her student to do the best.\nStill, when we had to do the essay, we had to praise Mussolini, and -- and she did that with a\nwooden face. So we had to write our essay, how wonderful Mussolini was, and then in, I believe\nwas \u201835, but you should check, when he went to Ethiopia, there was a horror in my -- all our\ncircle about Mussolini invading Abyssinia, was called at that time, dropping poison. And the\nDuca da Oustar, a family wi -- a -- being there too, I mean, there was a tremendous dispute.\nMussolini, of course, wanted an empair -- em-em-em-empire. The king went along with it, that\nidiot -- excuse the expression. If I understood correctly, the queen -- the wife was absolutely\nopposed to Mussolini, to his enterprise. She was born in Montenegro, Elena, and was a -- from\nwhat I\u2019ve heard --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: That\u2019s okay. Now, in [indecipherable] circle of friends, the rutsini -- the rutsini\n[indecipherable] rutsini were the parents of Mary Mullisanno. Mary Mullisanno was married to\nEnrico Mullisanno. Enrico Mullisanno\u2019s brother was Pigi Mullisanno, who was married to a\nwonderful woman called Marcella. Now, the rutsini were from monarchy, the Mullisanno were\nanti-Fascist, anti-king, 1s an idiot. But also they were praising his wife for her intelligence, for\ntraining her children to be useful in society, and not just idiots. In other word, they felt very\nstrongly that -- the Mullisanno -- that the king was not worth anything. I mean, yeah -- yeah, he\nwas -- he went along with Mussolini, and critical, went along with signing the law, went along\ngoing to Abyssinia, went along with everything, and eventually went along with Mussolini\nbecoming allies of the German, and al -- went along when Mussolini invaded France in 1940,\nand throughout that, while the rutsini always defended the king, and bi -- praising the queen, of\ncourse, and the children, etcetera. The Mullisanno said, the king goes along with Mussolini, so\nhe\u2019s equally responsible, and -- and ya -- that -- that kind of -- so, it was a fairment of ideas.\nThe essay we did in school had to reflect acceptance of Mussolini party line. And it was obvious\nthat the teacher was very skeptical, but she had to do it. [indecipherable]. Then when I went\nhome, I had to redo the whole damn thing -- excuse the expression. You know, Is -- what did\nyou do today? And I said, well that\u2019s what we did, that Mussolini went to Abyssinia to re-\nvindicate the destiny of Italy, I mean all that rhetoric, pretending the Fasci romani as if he had\nbecome -- a-and naming the king eventually, when the war was over, and [indecipherable] it was\nsuch a -- such a awful thing, that I was -- I learned that all this parade was -- was a charade, and\nalthough you couldn\u2019t speak in public, among friend, that was discussed all the time.",
        "A: Yup. So, you can see -- then, meanwhile I also had to learn in French, I had to -- but -- and\nthere were wonderful travels. Paris was a place, and -- and I\u2019m glad I learned French. History\nwas very important, literature was very important, and victory go -- Montaigne, Monsieur\nMontaigne, wi -- Pascal. I am glad I did, as well as Italian literature, as well as Italian poetry, like\nDant\u00e9, an old Italian. I-I am glad I did. I didn\u2019t understand as fully as my parents thought that I\nshould. Who can understand Dostoyevsky when you are so young? You know, the\n[indecipherable]. But, I read them, and they always said, \u201cOne day, when you are 40, you will\nhave to reread them all over again.\u201d But meanwhile, I di -- I had to do it, and history was\nimportant, literature was important, and the Greek, as well as the Roman. The lives -- Plutark\u2019s\nlives of the Greek, and the Roman. And that was becan -- but that was also discussed among the\npeople with who -- if we are stuck in the refuge one day, or discuss Cicero, [indecipherable] that\nwas part of growing up, somehow, and -- and looking back, it was a good education. Looking at\nwhat my children got in the school in Atherton, California, and before, they don\u2019t have\neducation. They don\u2019t have history, except some minor history. American history, which is very\nimportant, they should study more. I\u2019m -- we -- in other word, I could only understand how\nfortunate I was, how rich our -- and I\u2019m talking about ours, not just my -- they gives you, in spite\nof Fascism, in spite of a dictatorship, in spite of the war, they give you a -- a -- a little richer\nbackground to understand lives, to understand other country, to understand other culture, to\nunderstand politics. And -- and I guess from that respect, I felt I was a fortunate woman -- now, I\nmean, in the last 15 - 20 years, I understood what a fortunate person I -- I have been, too. So, the\nlife in -- in Italy was a happy one, until really the war started -- the -- \u201938 was the beginning of\ndifficulties.",
        "A: Well, the first thing was that you have to be very careful never to say anything, and it\u2019s kind\nof hiding, without hiding. And you know, you have to be careful only with your friend, don\u2019t say\nanything to anybody else, don\u2019t discuss politics, don\u2019t discuss the racial law, don\u2019t discuss\nanything about the fact that the Jewish people now are discriminated against, they cannot go to\nthe library, they cannot go to -- t-to -- in certain profession they are removed from the profession.\nPeople could not practice medicine or law, and -- and the Jewish children could not go to the\nlibrary, or to the regular school. Can you imagine if you are going to a regular school in this\ncountry, and you are told sometime very nicely, sometime by people who felt pain in saying that,\nand sometime not so nicely, but you cannot come back? And then children taunt -- tau -- te --\nyou know, mock other children, who are Jewish, but not as many as I learned was happening in\nFrance, or other country, and that I learned it from other people. Because in Italy, there was this\nmockery, but not mean, mean, mean, except by the Fascist, and there were not so bi -- so many\nwhich are vehement about the issue. So Italy had a -- had had an integration of the Jewish people\nwith Italian, lots of intermarriage. Nobody thought about that until Mussolini did that in 1938.",
        "A: \u00b022.",
        "A: Oh, absolutely.",
        "A: The racial law, yes, I think so. I think when Mussolini adopted the racial law, 1t was a turmoil\nwithin the society, and also the special tribunal, the political pers-persecution. In the jail, in San\nVittory, and in the confini -- confini are those people -- those places where people were sent, and\nI remember my parents, my friends saying, imagine if you\u2019re a doctor, a lawyer, a philosopher, a\nsociolo -- an intellectual. Also well as a worker who is organizing for the Communist party, or\nthe Socialist party. They didn\u2019t persecute the [indecipherable] party, not very much. But those\npeople are deprived of all contact, family, friends, reading. I mean, those people read newspaper,\nrepublication, often they w -- spoke other language, like English, and French, and others.\nImagine being deprived of everything? And be isolated, and you haven\u2019t done anything wrong,\nyou\u2019re innocent. And then when the special tribunal even sentenced people to death. And there\nwere women, also, who had been condemned to that. Now, some women, I understood -- and\nagain, one should do research on that -- I understood that some women were sent south, a-and\nthey -- sometime they were hired by well-to-do family, as maid. But they were separated from\ntheir family, their children, their husband, who say, if you didn\u2019t -- if you stayed at home and you\ntook care of me and the children, you did not have to worry about that. And some were kind.\nThere are some cases where I heard that the woman who gave them the job, was very\nsympathetic, very supportive, very helpful, particularly when during the visit, the ha -- she saw\nthe husband treating the wife, because -- if you stayed at home, you wouldn\u2019t have had this, and\nyou have th -- you caused me so much grief. I have to cook, you caused your children so much\npain, and blah, blah, blah, and she became very supportive of this exiled woman. Now, I don\u2019t\nknow about the [indecipherable] cases, you know, one should look into -- into that, but it struck\nme once again human being are capable of great love, human being are capable of great caring,\nconcern, and there are some who\u2019re not. And my feeling at the time, when I learned from my\nparents, from my friends, from the people I was surrounded with, was that it makes a difference\nif you\u2019re persecuted, and there are people who cares about you. And that began with a basket of\nroasted chicken, and thing that -- fruits -- and other -- than my parents, and other, brought to San\nVittory at the prison, and -- and also to people who are very poor, because there was a great deal\nof poverty at that time, and Mussolini was encouraging women to have a lot of children -- a lot\nof children to provide sons to go to war, essentially, cause he was always in t -- trying that, and --\nand things were bad, but then, when Mussolini met Hitler someplace, I think it was the Brenner\nPass, and must have been close to the beginning of the war, maybe a couple of years earlier, I\ndon\u2019t know. Again, the propaganda was all in the hand of the Fascist [indecipherable] and the\nradio, there was no television. Osana about the alliance between Mussolini, and -- and at that\ntime, the open hostility and contempt for the Jews, the propaganda began, to the point when\nJewish people began really to es -- try to escape, to get abroad, to -- but what struck me was,\nwhen we went [indecipherable] within smuggles, and friends, and the biter, the Pastore, you\nknow, the enormous compassion, and the enormous anger at wik Fascistoni -- there was -- were\nFascistoni means big Fascist. Because before, many people had accepted -- they were against the\nalliance with Germany from day one, because of the memory of World War One, because when\nGerman and Austrian soldier were captured as prisoner, farmer family treated them well.\nApparently, when the Italian prisoner of the German came back, they had horrible story to tell. I\nwas too young, but I have heard from -- from -- one we thing that happened at that time, that has\nremained with me very vividly, about wars, the occupation, that I mention so many French,\nAustrian, Berber, Swedish, that si -- that the memory of the occupation by the Austrian was very\nvivid when I was a child, because after all, Milan was occupied by them. The Aousta family,\nPiedmont -- regained Piedmont, the Aousta family, in 1849. Then, in 1859, is when finally\nLombardy was freed. You know, if -- andre dios 1s nothing in human history, but my parents\ntook me to see a little chapel in Lombardy not very far from Milan, in the countryside, and there\nare many of such chapel throughout Lombardy and Piedmont. And these little chapel, plain,\nthere is usually an image of some saint or something [indecipherable]. Then there is a grate, and\ninside the grate, there are bones. And the bones are the bones then the farmer founds, either in\nPiedmont, or Lombardy, people who died in the war in 1848, in 1858 - \u00b059. And the farmer\nfound so many, then they erected this little chapel as a memorial to the people who died, but that\nmemorial is a reminder that war is a horrible thing, and -- and people sometime bring matsolini\ndi furey. If you pick up some poppy, and bachelor button, and -- you know, and it\u2019s a ca -- and\nthen there 1s a -- a charo, there is a -- a candle, you know, those -- and then they put, and -- and\nthis is done spontaneously, nobody is in charge. But my parents reminded me then, this was a\nway to remember those horror, and hopefully it doesn\u2019t happen again, but they also talk about\nHitler, and Mussolini, but they also talk about Stalin. They felt that Stalin, and Hitler, but like\nthis, Mussolini was considered a buffoon, less ideological, although he did put nula osta to the\ndeportation. And it was not until after the war, when I met Angela Dinati, then we talk about the\nrole of Italian Army of occupation in Greece, in Yugoslavia, and [indecipherable]. Now, already\nwere -- throughout the world, there were letter coming from soldier Italian, in Albania, in\nYugoslavia, and they crying the horror of the Nazi death camp, through letters, which, although\nthere was censorship, nevertheless, it was brought out, and everybody talked about it. It was like\none of those telegram -- verbal telegram tree, then everybody -- no. Admittedly, the retay may\nhave been difficult. An interesting thing happened. Italy had censorship, but many Italian censor\nmade a point of passing some of the material to the anti-Fascist groups, and probably also to the\nchurch, I don\u2019t know. I only know the anti-Fascist leadership, Communist, or Socialist, parti\n[indecipherable], were recipient of those letters from Italian soldier who decried the horror of\nItalian being associated with the German in this horrib -- horrendous enterprise. It\u2019s against all\nthe Italian history, culture, ence religious figure [indecipherable]. And that\u2019s where the split in\nthe religious community took place. And the ambiguity, and the lack of clarity, with the\nexception of some priests, who actually gave their lives. Norman Zofti, I think was his name.\nOne priest in Milan, I know that he was shot in a -- in a place in Milan, that\u2019s a-another --\nanother period, but it was during the occupation. But again, there was this divisions, and of\ncourse there were many skeptics, although they were Catholic, and there were many Catholic\nwho did everything to help the Jewish people. But they couldn\u2019t give back the jobs, the jobs were\ntaken away. You know, the professor of the university were removed, and doctor were -- yes,\nthey practiced, but 1-in official universe medical school, etcetera, 1t was the Catholic doctor who\ntook over, and some of them were wonderful, and some of them found even way to send patients\nto this Jewish doctor, so then they could make some money. But above all, it was a time to begin\nlooking for safe places. I\u2019m going to take a break, because I have to go to the bathroom, but I\nalso want to show you that little red book, because two years ago, three years ago, when I went\nback to the -- to Milan, and I went to the archive with the cardinal -- we [indecipherable] then I\nask Julianna, would she please take me to see some of the conven -- the churches, and the farm\nin -- where we used to hide people, and also the confessional, where -- the place where we could\nexchange message with sympathetic priest.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Not fully. Not fully, and there was that sense of uneasiness. There was s -- you know, you\nplay with other children, and some -- very few, but -- would make some comments about Jews. I\nwould say there was a quiet sense of fear, a little bit, uneasiness, uncertitude. Your world had\nchanged. It seems that you had to be careful about everything. That carefree wonderful feeling,\nyes, there will be uneasiness, for a [indecipherable] something changed, and I cannot describe it\nvery well, except there was a sense of uneasiness, and probably looking back, hidden fears. You\nare not fully -- not fully understand why, but it\u2019s there. And then, a-as I said, we read the\nnewspaper, we listened to the radio, and of course, we didn\u2019t believe in it, but the propaganda\nwas there, day after day after day. And I do remember that we listened to the BBC hiding in the\ncellar, because it was against the law. The other thing that my parents always did, and friends\nalways did, every time they went to Switzerland skiing, like from bart to lunch, going to Zermot,\netcetera, they always tried to bring back a -- a pass from other countries, and I tell you, you do\ndevelop a love for the free press when you -- you pass it around from one to the other, and then --\noh, you only have t -- one day, then you have to give it to the other. It was just that, 1f you are\nafirmati, you were so famished for news, which were not the propaganda lying of the Fascist.\nAnd I -- I ha -- you know, I -- I believed then one of the reason I treasured article 19 of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, was freedom of expression, which I still believe is one\nof civilization highest achievement. Now [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, and that was a time when, actually, we moved to a place, at first, called San Columbano\nOlumbro, and went to another school for two years, new teacher, new s -- kids. That -- the\nprincipal of that school was a friend of my mother, and apparently she is the one who suggested\nthat we move from this place called -- I think was called Grafeenyella. At first I had completed\nfive grades, but secondly, she helped my parents to choose a place where probably we would\nhave been more comfortable. And so we went for two years, a new school, new everything, and\nthen two years later, we moved again to another place called Santangelo lo dejarno, but my\nparents at the time lived separately from me. They left me with a wonderful istydutris, a beautiful\nhouse --",
        "A: Istydutris means a woman who is in charge of my education, teach -- continuing to teach me\nliterature, French. And her name was Angeletta Souvinagi, an anti-Fascist. Her brother worked\nin Milan someplace, a -- but she loved music, and -- and of course, every weekend I would see\nmy parents, but meanwhile I was being, quote, educated. I didn\u2019t understand fully until later, that\nit was a one way for me to be protected somehow. It was such a difficult period, it\u2019s hard to\ndescribe. So, but I did get a wonderful education, number one, wonderful place to live, and with\nmy parents cooperation, Angeletta Souvinagi developed -- they bought -- they built a chicken\ncoops, one for white chicken, Leghorn, and one for red chicken called Rhode Island, and there\nthe rooster. And they also built a -- oh, oh -- I -- remo -- remodel a place, I really don\u2019t know, but\nI had to learn how to feed chicken, and the feedera to mix the various ingredient, and then\nexperiment with the white -- with the feeding white chicken, with the red with a different\nformula, and see which one did better, which one had more eggs. And it seems kind of teaching\nme how to study. And then, they also had an incubator, when -- I remember the eggs were\nfurnished from some other place, I can\u2019t remember where, very expensive. And then I could\nobserve once in awhile, how the embryo developed. And then eventually, when the chicks were\nborn, again there was an incubator -- the room was divided in two section, two incubator, and\nagain the chicks were fed a different formula than we had to make up. I remember there were dry\npowder milk for example. Fish, dry fish, something like that. I don\u2019t remember the ritay. All\nwhat I remember was it was a joyous experience. I could not play with other children. I went to\nschool, and I came back. But, we could go to the mountains all the time. And so the chicken\nraising was w -- as well as studying French and literature, history, and singing. And -- I\nremember --",
        "A: -- and remember bei -- no, not si -- studying singing, but listen to opera, and -- and -- and\nthere were record, there was no cassette, or -- like today, but I do remember that song about San\nVittory, which I learned, and of course [indecipherable] this friend was also anti-Fascist, but it\nwas the physical environment was beautiful, there were fruit tree in summer, vegetable,\nchickens, and learning. But there were no other children.",

        "A: I had to study. I had to study the cath -- the Jewish religion, the Catholic church, and I ha -- I\nwent to church, and I went, you know, to -- with my friends, sometime -- not very religious. The\nthing that my parents taught me was that God is a -- an entity that every person has to decide for\nthemself. The most important thing then, the religion, the Judeo-Christian religion has left us, are\nthe principle of caring, loving, and one of the thing that ins -- they insisted I would read, beside\nthe Bible, also with some friends, we went to the Catholic church when there was a series of les\nparabala. They were telling the stories of -- from the Jewish tradition, and the Catholic tradition\nof when, for example, Joseph was sold in Egypt, when -- a-and all the stories. When the -- Jesus\nChrist was on a horse, and gave a -- a coat to somebody who was very poor, and the reason I\nremember that was because there was also a difficult depression in Italy. So I gave my coat, next\nday, to one of the s -- girls that I knew her father was out of job. And I remember my mother\nmaking my lunches three times more and telling me how careful I had to be, and tactful, because\nthe father of so and so does not have a job. Now, I don\u2019t know if it was because of the\ndepression, or because they were Jewish, I have no idea, except that she made all these\nwonderful roasted chicken legs, and -- and reminding me how I had to be very delicate, and say,\n\u201cOh,\u201d you know, \u201chere, I can\u2019t eat all this. How would you like some?\u201d Knowing that she didn\u2019t\nhave some de -- I remember the coat, because I -- I went home, and I said, \u201cI gave away my\ncoat,\u201d because of the parabala of giving, and so she started laughing, and they got me another\ncoat.",
        "A: Oh no. No, no, no. No, no, not at all. It -- on the contrary, you know, no, acha -- they -- they\nsmiled, and they laughed, and -- and that was it. But I do remember being in the mountains\nsometime, when I took walk -- when wa -- if I was in Shamoni, and I decided t-to -- to go and\npick up some ackenberry myself, I was always staying with people, but sometime you feel like\ngoing by yourself along the stream, and the boat, and pick up a berry. And the owner of the\npensionne would make the pastry, and -- at that time I didn\u2019t cook. And thinking about -- you\nknow, it\u2019s really marvelous what we have around us, all this beauty. And then thinking about the\n-- Moses escaping from Egypt, the oil that lasted in -- in -- seven days, or [indecipherable]. And\ntrying to reconcile the Jewish with the Catholic. And then, I had trouble understanding how the\nCatholic could hate the Jews. And so many pogrom -- that we knew, about the pogrom, and\nother, and -- and being puzzled, and not un-understanding how can they do this? You know, they\n-- and then saying, \u201cWell, whichever God is up there, I like the beauty, the flowers, the\nmountains, the sea. But I don\u2019t like what\u2019s -- what some people are doing. And, so my parents\nwould explain that it\u2019s one thing the philosophy of a religion, and you take the best of it. Then\nwe spoke about the Muslim, and how there were many wonderful thing, charity, caring, that\npeople empower -- transformed part of that religion, in order to secure their own power, and they\ndid that by terrorizing people. And then they gave me the example of the first time -- some\npeople rebelled immediately against the tax collector, who, on the name of the -- the power of\nthe God, given to the temple -- power, was collecting the taxes, and the people were starving. So\nfinally, one day they drew him out of town, apparently. And that was one example of how\nreligious power was used for temperon power, and how that power was used to oppress people.\nAnd that, many religion had done, throughout the centuries. So, we also went to Greece, and I\nremember how they compared the Egyptian god. Serious, forbidding, autocratic. And how the\ngod of Greece were funny. And so I had to learn somehow, about religion, in a very different\nway than most people learned religion, but I love to go to -- to the [indecipherable] sometime, for\nthe sola mass, we -- we did. And with my nurse, my wet nurse, you know, it was so comforting.\nNow, in the synagogue when I visit, I couldn\u2019t understand why men and women were in one\nplace, and the other, and I -- why not together? But again, that was -- was not something that I\nbecame deeply involved in practicing. I loved the ceremonial, and I remember on a Friday night,\nwhen my mother put on a white blouse, and then with the candle, and she did something like\nthat. But I didn\u2019t understand it. What they tried to teach me were the wonderful, biblical story of\nthe Bible, and what the Catholic church had taken, but pointing out, when the Catholic church\nfor example, was going to forbi -- forbade study of other religions, and so they gave me Voltaire\nto start to read and study. So I studied Voltaire, and the rebelliousness of Voltaire, and then --\nand the bola from the city church, exercised control, or publication through special stamps. I\ncan\u2019t remember the name of it, but Voltaire -- index, that\u2019s what it was. Voltaire was one of the\nauthor at the index. So, my parents made a point, and I had to study, read Voltaire, I loved it. So\n-- and --",

        "A: Occasion during the resistance where we were hiding in Milan, and it was Friday, and candela\nwere very precious. But somebody provided two candle, because the other people hiding were\nJewish, and so for Friday. So, I think sometime how lucky people are, if on Friday night, they\ncan have the ceremonial. Just as I think about other religions being free to have the ceremonial,\nfreely, without coercion, without persecution. But that [indecipherable] motzikoni di candela,\ntwo small pieces. I mean, it\u2019s unbelievable how those things remain with you, and -- and think, if\npeople were free to do that, they should be so happy, not to be persecuted, not to be -- or looked\nupon as strange, or -- and I owe that to my parents, to teach me early, early, the power of\noppression, then some people gain, through a control of part of religion, and so many have done\nthat, so many religion have done that. So I ended up by trying to work for every person to be free\nto practice their religion, or political belief, or ethnic pride, or what have you.

And I -- we could only perceive\nthen something was going on, and we could only guess. I remember -- and I spoke about this, on\none evening, when I was sent -- I was fed early, and I -- and then, go to your room to study, or\ndo, you know, things. And I remember a heated discussion when my parents had with somebody,\nthat I don\u2019t know who, and they kept on saying, \u201cYou must leave Germany now,\u201d or -- and the\nperson saying, with an accent, \u201cBut I was born there.

        "A: I was puzzled. I didn\u2019t understand. I couldn\u2019t understand why people have to leave their\ncountry. And this one was not from Italy, this was somebody else now. When I spoke to Guido\nBustelli about all this, then he -- we spent the whole day going through, and we don\u2019t have the\ntime to do that, but -- although I knew many things, but Guido Bustelli clarified for me so many\naspect of the pre-war period, and he is the one who told me that -- Bustelli -- that in August,\n1939, the chief of the Intelligence Services of Switzerland, and I re -- I believe his name was\nMayzon, but I can\u2019t swear to it. Mayzon because I associate it with brick. Mayzon -- maison in\nFrench, because my parents taught me to make association of words with things. Apparently,\nthey were all called together by the chief of the Swiss Intelligence Service, and said,\n\u201cGentlemen, based on the information we received f-from excellent sources, reliable sources,\nHitler will attack Poland in a couple of weeks, and that was about the middle of August. And of\ncourse, he did. And also, Bustelli told me that the Swiss Intelligence knew that they would use a\nJewish prisoner in a mock attack on the German, and claim that it was instigated by the Jewish\npeople. Now, I -- I haven\u2019t read that part of history, somebody else will have to do that, but we\nspend the day, and then at the end of the days, when I said bus -- by then he has become very\nfriendly, and [indecipherable] before the very official Swiss officer.

        "A: [indecipherable]. Such an emotional moment. Then there were -- stupid\n[indecipherable|creedi mocha tua morte. She thought -- you know, many people -- since I\ndisappeared, I was in a convalescent home. They thought that either I had died, some thought\nthat I was in a mental hospital. I just disappeared, and so what she did was every year to say a\nmass with -- for the dead one of her family, for Torpelino. So, someplace there 1s a picture of\nCosmillas, who say, Lena said you were tired, and we should go home, and I said, \u201cNo, I\u2019ve got\nto get to [indecipherable].\u201d So Lena described this get together, and of course since then, we get\ntogether all the time, and we talk all the time, and -- and she has this place in Alba, and she said,\n\u2018No, you has to come next spring you come to Alba.\u201d I see her -- them, all the time of course.",

        "A: Maybe [indecipherable]",
        "A: I didn\u2019t decide. We were. There was no such a thing as a day when a conscious decision was\nmade to join the Resistance. It was an anti-Fascist movement, and as such, dedicated to helping\nthe victim of Fascism. One particular group of people, who deserves a great deal of recognition\nis a small convent, with nun. My parents were very close to them. These nun had the small\nconvent in a place called, I believe, Grafinala, which was a tiny village near Milan. These nun\nwere truly dedicated to helping people in needs. Women who had been thrown out of their home,\nbecause they\u2019re pregnant with illegitimate children, and quietly, with the head of the -- what 1s --\nCosinda -- Cosinda, the mayor of this little village, Grafinala, who 1s also the head of the Fascist\nparty. He sits there, wert, in the city hall of this little village, together with my family, friends.\nWas an incredible unit, organized to assist the victim of Fascism, although he was the head of the\nFascist party for this little communit -- this little village. And it\u2019s always assisted people who are\nhiding, who are sent by my parents, or by other people, to hide in the farms. They may have been\nJewish, they may have been anti-Fascist, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just that all of us young people seems\nto have been recr -- not recruited, you were just par -- natural part of the assistant project. And\nthen, in 19 -- I believe it is \u201942, but I\u2019m not certain, the head, th -- the Sindaco, the -- the mayor,\nwhose sister was the employee of the city hall, who was giving coupon for clothes, for food,\ndecided that I should work there as a temporary employee in order to, yes, give the coupon to\npeople of the village, who paid, I believe was one lira, but I\u2019m not -- you know, it\u2019s such a long\ntime ago. And every 10 coupons, I would put away one that I would give to the nun. And those\nwere to help her -- people who were either anti-Fascist, or Jewish, hiding. Because in Milan, they\nhad already established some controls of the coupon given in certain area of the city block, a city\nblock. And the Ovra -- the secret police, was watching in case there were more coupon for food\nthan the people. Don\u2019t ask me how it was done, I don\u2019t have a clue. All what I know that it was\ndone, and this little village, and possibly other, I don\u2019t know, these little group of nun, with help\n-- with the help of the s -- mayor -- you call 1t mayor, it\u2019s Sindaco, who 1s a Fascist, the head of\nthe fasc -- he was helping, and his sister, being a city hall employee, was a -- crucial. And they\nwere so outraged about what Mussolini was doing to the Jewish people, or anti-Fascist. The\nquestion arose, apparently -- I only heard, that there was a discussion, he wanted to resign, and\neverybody said don\u2019t you do it, because you are far more helpful where you are, in helping us.\nAnd so he stayed, and on the -- the Fascist would give away sometime, la bifana -- la bifana\nfashista, which was January sixth, or something like this, after Christmas, and he would give\nspecial toys and things to children in the name of the Fascist, but he was wa -- our greatest\nhelper, and his sister, and the nun, and the Mother Superior was a gem. I didn\u2019t mind working\ntwo weeks to make lace for the church, and such a warm, caring environment, trying to help.\nThey -- they were never judging people, are you Jewish or not Jewish, are you Fascist, or anti-\nFascist? Are you Catholic, or not Catholic? It was just -- what I felt was this is the display of true\nChristianity, if there is such a thing, you know? I\u2019m certain that the best of the Judeo-Christian\ntradition in caring, I saw it at that time.",
        "A: Yes. The group in Milan, Enrico Mullisanno, Rainso Contamessa, Pigi Mullisanno, Peggy,\nand other, decided that apparently I was bright. I didn\u2019t know how to type, but they felt that I\ncould be very helpful working with them, for them, as a secretary, at the headquarter of the\nItalian Air Force in Milan. I think was Piazza Italibalbo number four.",
        "A: Yes?",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t know, 15 - 16, something like that, I can\u2019t -- young. But because many clerk were\naway in the war, it was a terrible war. All young people were drafted. I must make a point here,\nthan many young people who are Fascistoni, big Fascist, and pro-Nazi, who screamed moliama\nla guerra, moliama la guerra, we want war, we want war, they didn\u2019t go to the African front.\nThey didn\u2019t go to the Russian front. They didn\u2019t go to the Albanian front, they didn\u2019t go to\nYugoslavia, and all those places which were dangerous. They found a nice, warm hiding places\nin the office, the bureaucracy of the military, of the navy, or everything else. And that was, I\nbelieve, a shock for the Italian, that all these Fascistoni then proclaimed moliama la guerra,\nmoliama la guerra, but then, they -- they were called inboscarti. They found a comfortable niche\nin the city where there was no danger of them being killed. They send all those poor young men\nto died, especially on the Russian front, as well as the African front, as well as Yugoslavia, and\nAlbania. And there is a wonderful song about Albania, about the alpini, those are the mountain\ntroops, who truly wonderful, and not politicized to the same degree as other. And they began\nwriting home letters describing what was happening on the Russian front, describing what was\nhappening in Albania, describing what was happening in Yugoslavia, Croatia, and all those\nplaces, and saying, \u201cI am Italian, I love my country, but I am ashamed of what some people are\ndoing, collaborating with the Nazi.\u201d And they were letting their family know, and of course not\neverything came true, and the censorship was very strict, but we have to remember that among\nthe censorship there were also people who were Italian, and Italian being Italian, and member of\nthe -- letter go through, so that we seems to be aware at that time -- not that I understood it, far\nfrom it. But anyway, I was asked to go and work as a secretary for Enrico Mullisanno, the\nlawyer, Pigi Mullisanno, a lawyer, Rainso Contamessa, a lawyer, who were all officers of the Air\nForce dur -- in Piazza Italibalbo at the headquarter. All of them were anti-Fascist, all of them\nwere part em -- of the anti-Fascist movement called jewsteetsa liberta. All of them intent on\nworking with the factory, with industry. Industry had to produce for the German, but one person\nwho was at -- it -- at the headquarter was Guido Chezura. Guido Chezura was a high ranking offi\n-- officer of the Pirelli, but he was a captain of something, I can\u2019t remember his exact grade, but\nhe was with Pirelli. Pirelli was supplying rubber tire, and others. Well, stay out of any anti-\nFascist movement, you are far more valuable if you don\u2019t say anything, if you just help. An\nincredible woman, who every time she typed anything, there was an extra copy for the\ncommittee -- but there was no committee of national liberation at the time. I don\u2019t know, but it\nwent to the anti-Fascist movement. Her name was Peggy. And I always look at her, because she\nwas so beautiful, and beautifully dressed, and I felt like a shrimp next to her. But she was a\nwonderful friend, and on top of all, she was a very effective underground worker. I was simply a\ncourier, but I learned at the time that bringing messages, such as the one preparatory to a March\n1944 strike, simultaneously taking place in Milan, Torino, Genoa. I went back and forth, went to\nthe factories, and I discovered in all these women working in this factory, most of them were\nCommunists and Socialists, very hard line, very committed, very well organized. And I have to\nsay this, the Communist, and the Socialist were very, very well organized against anti-Fascism.\nThe leadership had been imprisoned --",
        "A: Against Fascist.",
        "A: Fascist and Nazi. And they had been part of the anti-Fascist movement. Some -- I mean the\nleadership -- some of them had been imprisoned during the Mussolini period, even before the\nwar, in ile -- remote ila lipari, [indecipherable] and other prison. But they were organized. They\nhad been trained to work in the underground. We\u2019re not. We learning -- we are learning, but they\nwere pro, because for years they had had leadership. Now, the Rosetti brother formed jewsteetsa\nliberta, that was the result of the fact that they left Communism, because they felt there 1s really\nno difference between hard line Marxist Leninism, and Nazi Fascists, and formed jewsteetsa\nliberta. Then they were thrown -- they escape to France, and this I heard, I have no first-hand\nexperience with all that, but I was told then the Ovra, the Italian Fascist secret police, in\ncooperation with the French secret police, political, assassinated both of them. And\n[indecipherable] what I found at that period during the war, and especially 1942 - \u201943, until the\n[indecipherable] was that everybody knew about them. And in the factory, the women, and the\nleadership be-began questioning whether their true commitment, total commitment to Marxist\nLeninism was the best way for the post-war government of Italy. I didn\u2019t understand it. I had --\nyou know, I tried, but I began to see that the anti-Fascism that I grew up with, and also the\nreference to the Communist after World War One, were bad too, but it was so remote. This was\nreal. This I had to go from Piazza Italibalbo, every morning I went to work, every morning I was\ngiven messages to bring to this place, to that place, to this place, to that place. And don\u2019t ask\nmany question. I was a stuffetta. But also, I remember being sent to places where there was the\nhappa leadership of industry, la falca. I believe 1t was montanapalioni, I think. And they were\nproviding money. Whether they were working under the Fascist, and producing for the Nazi, but\nthey were providing funds to assist the victim of persecution, and -- which I delivered but I don\u2019t\nknow -- there -- somebody else did the job. I was a simple stuffetta.",
        "A: Stuffetta means a person who\u2019s a courier. You don\u2019t know anything about anything else\nexcept what you are doing. A-And the reason was because they were taking extreme precaution,\nbecause the Ovra was still very active. Then, on July, 1943, Mussolini fell. And already they had\nsense in this group -- and remember, this was highly educated upper contact with the military,\nwith the foreign office, with the society, with the churches, with -- and -- and I remember that\nMussolini was overthrown, and I was told not to go home. I stay with Peggy one day, and we\nmade eggplants, I always remember fried eggplants. And -- and people who I -- the same people,\nI believe, not all -- not the anti-Fascists, of course, but many people had say, \u201cMussolini,\nmoliama la guerra, moliama la guerra, moliama la guerra.\u201d This time they were throwing\nmattresses out of the house on the Fascists. And I became acquainted with how easily political\nparty can manipulate masses, bringing them by truck to demonstrations. How ya -- how do you\nsay, whip them up for this, or against this. And I became very skeptical of the political processes,\nand le -- and began looking at the political process with a very keen eye, so to speak. The other\nlesson that I was learning at this time was the clandestine press, because we had wonderful\npeople who did work for the press, which was all controlled by the Fascists, who did control for\nthe radio, which was all controlled by the Fascists. But we were also listening to the BBC. I\ndidn\u2019t understand English, but somebody helped to understand it. And in the process, we were\ntaught how to understand propaganda. If we had to write anti-Fascist leaflet, we had to\nunderstand why we were anti-Fascist, and anti-Nazi. The -- how propaganda 1s used, how it can\nbe used, how it can be manipulated. And I must say that little by little, I learned that not\neverything is black and white, and -- however, I came away from that with a sense that the truth\nis very important. Eventually the truth emerge. And the other passion that I developed at that\ntime was for freedom of expression. That we may not be absolutely right, but there 1 -- in a free\nexpression, then there is always the mean to rectify. And people should treasure that, and be very\ncareful, because dictatorship will always manipulate, distort, lie, deceive. And unless we keep\nconstant vigilance, we are likely to lose those rights. And those rights could be privilege given by\nany government, political party, religious groups. Somehow I felt, and I was sitting at this table,\nand they were expert there, I was not. And I look at the world, where I felt we have opportunity\nto do something by informing people. And then somebody reminded me that many of the Italian\nwere analphabet. They didn\u2019t know how to read and write. And therefore, education was the\nprimary need, so then other people beca -- besides elementary education, they could also read,\nand then understand what they were reading. And -- we stopping?",
        "A: So, that\u2019s --",
        "A: Then I -- we continued, it was a -- just a tremendous hi -- traffic with many, many, many\nwomen, children, old men, because the young one weren -- and we often brought the messages in\nshopping bag.

        "A: Bicycle, you know, the tubes, or the seat where you sit, in between, to put the messages,\nbecause bicycle was a very common thing. Trams were working when there was no bombing,\nbut if there was a bombing, there was no trams, so that you walk, or you go by bus, you\u2019d go.\nAnd what was extraordinary was a network which didn\u2019t have much structure -- it had a\nstructure, the thing was that the structure was very loose, and chow Gino, chow Pierro. You\ndidn\u2019t have a clue who chow -- who Pierro, or Gino, or whoever was, except for the leadership.\nAnd then there was the Communist party, the Socialist party, the partito retsioni.

At the\n[indecipherable] place where we were working, obviously they had contact with, and very\ncareful about the possible spy within the headquarter, in Piazza Italibalbo. Ba -- by the time I\nwas there, everybody was so discouraged. I mean, the employee, the career people, were so\ndiscouraged. And when, then, the ally came to Sicily, my group, right there, opened a bottle of\nchampagne. And they were very sensitive about the career people who were there to do a job,\ntheir family was in Sicily, or in the south. And what struck me was the sense of compassion,\nthen, everybody had about people who had to serve, to get the paycheck, divided with -- you\nknow, from the family, etcetera. There wasn\u2019t hatred. And I do remember -- this is later, in\nSeptember, when one of them said, \u201cSigniorina, who\u2019s going to pay my salary now?\u201d I would\nlike a break.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know --",
        "A: Yes, one of the goal of the underground press was to bring to the attention of the Italian under\nthe occupation of the Nazi Fascists, what was going on. Arrest, execution, deportation, often\nwith the name of people, and also the public edict of the Nazi, and the Fascist, telling citizen that\nunless they cooperated, then the penal -- spelling out the penalty, also the reward. For any allied\nPOW, there was a certain amount of salt, if I recall correctly, some money. Also promise of\nrelease of a family member who was in Germany, in exchange for turning in allied POW, or\nItalian who were anti-Fascist and awaiting the draft. So our goal was really to -- to do that. And\nevery party, every political party had their own newspaper. One of the newspaper then, I enjoyed\nvery much helping with in the distribution was noey darnet. We only had four members, but\nwonderful people. And I also think that that was a maturing step for all of us. Noey darnet.\nThinking about the havoc wrought in the people -- Italian people\u2019s lives, men, women, and\nchildren, by Fascism, and how are we going to rebuild a des -- destroyed society. Mussolini\nintent was essentially to have women keep their place, produce many children. Women were not\nallowed to reach higher echelon of education. But they were -- women were praised and given\nincentive to produce more and more children. At one point also, the women were asked to give\ntheir wedding band, gold, in order to pay for the war material, and the queen did her duty, and\nput her ring. Later on we learned that many of the Fascists simply put a lot of the gold 1n their\npocket. I don\u2019t know if it was true or not, but it -- it\u2019s irrelevant. The other thing we had to do\nwas to give copper, our copper pots, to be used for cannon. And boy thi -- that turned women off,\nnot to have your cooking pot, nice, heavy, often from grandparents, and from the farm, etcetera,\nto have to turn them in to make cannon. The other group of women, who were politically\nsensitive, and better organized, were limondinae. Those were wonderful young women who, for\nthe period when the rice needed to be weeded, would leave their home, and go into farm, big\nfarm. And this big farm would have huge places with mattresses which are not mattresses, they\nwere simply sack cloth filled with straw. And the women would go, I don\u2019t remember how long,\nbut they could go for the period of mondini to weed the rice, which meant being in the water\nwith leeches on their feet. And these women became quickly organized by the Communist party\nto fight Fascism, and their horrible conditions. They had their own newspapers too, but I do --\nthe one I knew was jewsteetsa liberta, no dominae, partito retsioni. The student paper, and -- and\nit was an -- a clandestine effort, needless to say. Paper was very scarce, and we were grateful to\nall the newspaper people who were employed in the regular [indecipherable] sera, yeah, for\nclandestinely making available to us, some precious, precious paper. Are you worried about the\ntape?",
        "A: So, it was a -- a dangerous thing to do, because if a member of the gopper -- gopeesti, those\nwho [indecipherable] an assassination against a target of the SS, the Gestapo, and other, if they\nwere caught, they were shot. That -- the Nazi Fascist put a premium on arresting, catching, and\ntorturing for interrogation, people who were involved in distributing the clandestine press, how\ndid they organize, where was it printed, who 1s doing it, etcetera. And gathering the information\nfor the clandestine press, which was done by a network of people, men, women and children, the\nrailway, the bill of [indecipherable], you know that kind, and also the insignia on the German,\nand trying to more or less to see if there had been changes, an increase. Anyone caught in that\nkind of work automatically was a suspect for interrogation and torture.",
        "A: Absolutely. And that\u2019s when I began treasuring the freedom of the press.",
        "A: And also caught listening to the BBC, it meant deportation, or interrogation. In other word,\nthe -- they put a great deal of emphasis on catching people who were providing information,\neducation, exposing the horror, than they were doing -- although they were very stupid in many\nway, because on one occasion --\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: They were very stupid. Well, in general, you know, they were -- they were very -- they were\nexpert in the art of interrogation, at -- at one level, because, instead of being selective, every\nsuspect was tortured. They missed opportunity for getting information, because people died, or\npeople simply decided no way, I\u2019m going to die anyway. And one of the thing that must be said\nabout the stupidity is, and for the first time, the SS and the Gestapo brought torture, not as an\nisolated incident, as the Ovra had used, or the police had used [indecipherable] any time, any\nplace, anywhere, that is a systematic system of interrogation. And it -- torturing people to obtain\ninformation which could be useful, became routine, and that was stupid, because they really\ntortured many people who didn\u2019t know anything. And then they were hanging people publicly, in\nthe gallows, shooting them. The other stupidity that they did, horrendous stupidity was -- not in\nMilan, but abatsaboto, they caught -- there were something like 50 -- appro -- 50 - 54 partisan,\nincluding a pregnant woman, and they made that group travel from village to village, and then\nthey executed them all. In Liguria, near Genoa spitsa, there is another place where they took\nsomething like 40 or 50 young men, and publicly th-they executed them all. And now, when I\u2019m\nusing the word stupidity, is because far from frightening -- yes, people were frightened, people\nare terrorized, but also people said, what? Even many Fascists said, I don\u2019t want to be associated\nwith this. This is not Italy. And true, with the Nazi, there were the Italian Fascist, SS, the libreen,\nrigatinari, the mouti, the dechamamas, who as volunteer, joined the SS unit, and they were the\none who knew Italian, they were the one who knew the addresses to take these people, etcetera. I\nuse the word stupidity because it really increased our ranks. People who had said, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t\nhelp you, I\u2019m too frightened, not for me, but for my family -- what can I do to help?\u201d And I\nsuspect that in any underground movement, but I -- I only know Italy, when there is this kind of\nnaked brutality, people will emerge, who will take far higher risk to help the victim than they had\nbeen willing to risk before. And the reason I felt strongly about the underground press, although\nI\u2019m not a journalist, but of course the Ritsini was a journalist family, pro-monarchy, I suspect\npossibly pro-Fascist in the early period, but certainly against this kind of brutality, and they were\na great help in understanding that some conservative, from monarchy, etcetera, maybe\nproconserva -- they don\u2019t accept such brutality, and -- and had to -- had to the paper -- now, our\nworkers -- thousand of people was to paste notices, and -- and oo -- at that time, we had to make\n-- to mix flour with water, and pinello, and go -- and that was very dangerous. And then\ndistribute the clandestine press every place we could, in the fabrica factory, office, buildings,\nschool. Now the university, the student had their own newspaper, but we have to remember then,\nmost of the professor had been forced to flee, to hide, and so we, as a student hiding, had some\ntime became captive audience to professor who cou-couldn\u2019t teach, and if we were hiding\nsomeplace for few days, let me tell you, we did have good professor. I mean, discussions were\nmarvelous, and unforgettable. You may forget something that you do in the regular school, you\ndon\u2019t forget something that you learn under the circumstances, debates, pro and con, and\nsometime deliberately, they chose one or the other to take the opposite point of view for arguing\na case, for arguing a point, for arguing an essay, for arguing a book. And between that, and\nassessing the press, evaluate it, analyzing it, and then come up with a synthesis that reflected the\ntruth in very short space. I believe it helps to consolidate your thinking in a way that nothing else\nsince has ever helped me to consolidate ideas, and --",
        "A: Yeah, oh yes. The debate, at one point, centered around the role of people who had been part\nof the great concit of the Fascists, and then in July, turned against Mussolini, which caused, of\ncourse, the fall of Mussolini. The role of the king, accepting to be emperor, accepting Fascism all\nthose year, in spite of the terrible cost to Italy, to the Italian people, and what should be the post-\nwar or -- of those people who had been Fascist, which of course, I believe that as soon as the\nNazi came to power, tried to erase them, and executed some, like Galliazo Channo, and -- and\nother, or the king, for post war. There were pro and con, and then debate about, so -- th-th-those\nwere political discussion, and I have not been used to, and listen to people who had been\nprofessors and -- and student. It was interesting. It was a learning lesson in politics, for when -- I\nmade up my mind that I would have never -- nothing to do with politics after world war -- I\nwould have to do something with protecting human right, and freedom of expression. And then\nthe other discussion was about the slogan of the Communist, from the Ural to the Atlantic. Is that\nwhat we want for Europe? And the answer, a couple said absolutely, because they provide social\nand economic right. Other felt like hell we want from the Ural to Atlantic, to have Stalinism, and\nLeninism, in Europe. Well, but the French wants that. Well, the Italian don\u2019t. Some did, but even\nthe Italian who had been Communist, like Leo Baliani, and other, in the prison of Mussolini,\nchanged, and decided it was not good for the Italian. And in fact, no -- Ricardo Lombardi, Leo\nBaliani, Federucho Parray, they all agreed that the principle of socio-economic right is important,\nbut so are civil and political right, and the two shall be linked. And so the discussions was often\nheated. Then there was a discussion about why should we accept funds from the American --\nfrom the allies, in the conduct of the underground in Italy, to assist prisoner, family, as well as\nassist the partisan. The air drops, also money from banks, and from -- funds from the army left\nover, etcetera. We should have nothing to do with funding from the allies, or somebody said that\nwe -- the Russian are sending tons of money for the -- for the Communist, for the propaganda,\nfor everything. So the discussion were often heated on that subject. And our feeling was that we\nhave to win this war first. And then the political system that Italy will have, will have to be\ndecided by the Italian. The most important thing we should ha -- must have, is a constitution.\nAnd so then there were the professor who -- who knew laws, and knew the -- then we read the\nDeclaration of Independence, and the Bill of Rights, and oh, this 1s what we should have, and --\nbut the most thing -- everything agreed on no more dictatorship, and then brought into the\nquestion, what about the Marxist Leninist, that\u2019s a dictatorship. Oh yes, but that is a dictatorship\nof the proletariat. Does he allow freedom of expression? No. Yes, but he provides social and\neconomic right. Work for everybody, houses for everybody, food for everybody, and my\nquestion was, at what price? So, here we are -- sometime the bombs were also falling, and having\nthis discussion. But essentially I came away with a sense that open debate is crucial. But\npersonally, I will never tolerate any dictatorship, no matter what the justification 1s -- is given by\na government, period. And I didn\u2019t care if it was right wing, or left wing, or whatever. Any\ngovernment, then want to impose a dictatorship on their people, in as far as I was concerned at\nthat time, does not deserve to be respected, or supported. But to do that, you need the help of\neverybody to understand, to begin with, the danger, then this government represents. And they\nwill always find excuses, I mean, Mussolini was giving us all the excuses, Hitler was giving us\nall the excuses. Hitler wa -- Stalin was giving us all the excuses. And what was the result?\nSuffering for everybody.",
        "A: Well I realized that here were people that I loved, intelligent, dedicated, who truly believed\nthat in the future, when the war was over, to obey the order of Stalin, for the good of the Italian,\nwas essentialed to reveal our society in amoda, which would be different than Fascism. I was\nunable to accept that. The other was that there were some member of the Communist party began\nworrying about this kind of thing, and discussed this openly, and felt that the Roselli brother for\njust a salivita, and understood the danger that Marxist, Lenin, and Stalinism presented for\nsociety, we still wanted to change the socio-economic situation. That was freedom, and not\nfreedom of expression suppressed in order to achieve the other. In fact, we felt at that time that\nFascism was far more modern that Leninism -- Stalinist Leninism, and look what it has done. We\ndidn\u2019t know about many other things than Stalin had done, and we knew what the Nazi had done.\nAnd analyzed, discussed, studied, compared, and all -- all the others were going to become part\nof political parties. All of them became political leaders. And it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s just that I felt there\nhas to be voices outside of the political system, that you can say, I disagree with that. And I\nremember -- I can\u2019t remember who said this, and then later on I heard it after the war many\ntimes. I think it was Voltaire. I disagree with you, but I\u2019m ready to die for your right to disagree\nwith me. I\u2019m not certain it was Voltaire, but that\u2019s what I thought at that time. That\u2019s what we\nthought at that time. I disagree with you, but I\u2019m ready to die for your right to disagree. And we\nfelt that post-war Italy had to be respectful of ideas. That there has to be a government which\nrespect the right of citizen, and not imprison them, not torture them, not have mock trial, not\nhave the special tribunal. Special tribunal was the tribunal than [indecipherable] Mussolini --\nOvra installed during the Fascist period where there were three milary -- military judges, no legal\ndefense, no -- entrapment was the -- the word for any suspect. So, those are the idea that really\nconsumed us, while we were all so activist in helping, in hiding, in pasting notices, or change\nslogan of the -- we knew then people were deported in railway tracks. We were told that they\nwere sent to Germany to work. And somebody wrote [indecipherable] Tedeschi, W. Tedeschi,\nand we will paint Abastoy Tedeschi, I mean, stupid things like this. It -- it -- 1t was just perhaps\nchildish, but we felt it was important, and boy if you were caught, you are shot. You know, th-\nthat kind of -- that distribution of mater -- leaflet press, and also learning to communicate to\nothers, if there was a -- a danger. The reason I made a copy of carla was because it\u2019s a classic\nexample of somebody who undertake a very important project on that ha -- on that history, that\nalso how somebody let him know then somebody was searching him, and instead of explaining,\nif you read it, you get it. And -- and [indecipherable] translated into English, so that you can -- is\nan example of hundreds -- hundreds, and ordinary people doing kind of strange things all the\ntime.",
        "A: We have to say we, because I was not the only one.",
        "A: And I have emphasized the word we, we, we, because these were a group of people working\ntogether but who disagreed about the political system --",
        "A: -- to succeed Mussolini in post-war Italy.",
        "A: And then we also learned that sometime funds coming in from the allies, and distributed to\nthe church, was distributed to every group, but we also learned that the Communists were also\nkeeping money for the post-war re-organization of the Communist party. And at the time when\nyou have such horror going on, and you need every penny to help everybody, I felt, my God, I\nam no different than the Fascist. They are already beginning to accumulate money for power, for\ntheir control after. And the slogan, from the Ural to Atlantic really made us uneasy. Not just me,\nbut Enrico Mullisanno, Pigi Mullisanno, Rainso Contamessa. They were Communists who were\nqueasy about it, but they still felt that they owed obedience. So my response was -- and this was\nmy response, obideerai -- craderai obideerai combaterai. To believe -- to believe craderai.\nObideera, obey, combaterai, fight. And I said, what is the difference when with the slogan of\nStalin, and the slogan of Mussolini, and the slogan of the church, the Catholic church. Craderai,\nobideerai, combaterai. And I said, we want a force [indecipherable] of Italy, which hopefully will\nreflect the freedom that every person is entitled to. The respect, the dignity. If you want to be a\nCommunist, you should be a Communist, but if I want to be something else -- I respect your\nright, but you have to respect mine. You don\u2019t imprison me if you are in power because I happen\nto have different view, political or religious, because we remember also the Inquisition. And\nItalian history is replete with it. One discussion we had in the underground about torture was\nthen the -- actually the Empress of Austria, not herself, but on the advice of counsel, Austria had\nabolished the use of torture to extract information, and I believe it was the end of the previous\ncentury, and yet, 1t was reinstated when the Nazi came, eliminating the judicial system, taking\nover the judicial system, and -- and using torture. So, the discussion also centered about what the\n-- the Austrian had done at the -- the end of the previous century -- not that Maria Theresa was\nnecessarily enthusiastic, but she accepted the advice of her counsel to eliminate tr -- torture, and\nthen, as Hitler comes to power, the court lose juridical prerogative, due to the court, and the\njudicial system, for political reason. And then they bring it to Italy. And while cases of torture\nhad always occurred, but this was systematic torture, and it was horrendous. I mean, people --\nthe scream were heard in -- whether it was in Milan, in Biapaolocelli, in Torino, La\nCamradeebeeasti, Aroust, every place. It became an epidemic. But we thought about the\npossibility of that under a dictatorial regime. And we felt a dictatorship can use this method, as\nthe Nazi, the Fascists are doing, any place, any time. So in a post-war Italy, what we want is\nguarantee, and that will never happen again. And we\u2019re thinking about Italy.",
        "A: Oh, I -- I beg your pardon?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t see -- I couldn\u2019t see them. So I -- the underground had a assistance program, and\nI was actually handling three apartments, in Viama Kerajoya, \u201941. The concierge, Mrs. Columbo,\nwas our friend. Her brother-in-law was executed, was one of the partisan who, in the railway,\nwho was helping to give us the correct bill of lading, instead of the bill of lading when the\nGermans said on the train coming in, whate -- instea -- they would put clothes in, but e -- as, in\nfact they were armament. And that was very important to the allies, to know what kind of\nmaterial the German were bringing in for the war effort. And there was an army of young people,\nstudent and others. Now, the brother of mis -- in-law of Mrs. Columbo was caught and executed.\nNow, there were three apartment derain prepared by the underground. Don\u2019t ask me, except that\nmy little apartment was quickly -- an arch -- furnitch -- an architect came and fixed the cupboard,\nand it was very well arranged. Then there was a third floor apartment, that I was handling for a\ncourier who came back and forth. And then there was one on the fifth floor that I never saw,\nexcept that when somebody came, was a special password, it was the fifth floor. And only later,\nafter the war, we realized then that was probably the OSS people. And they kept everything\ncompartmen -- compartmentalized. Then, in addition to these three apartment, we were in the --\nanother apartment in [indecipherable] few block further down, and a network of places where\npeople could spend a night. And it was all integrated with the work done by the Committee of\nNational Liberation, and by the churches, by political party, by groups. And each group was very\nindependent of the other, so that -- for example, since I\u2019m looking at Lydia, one little church in\nDrunago, the priest was wonderful, and he hid people in the belfry. But, it was a network of\npeople. Of course, once in awhile we were caught, once in awhile it was broken, and we lost\npeople. There were deportation, and -- or a book this thick has name of Italian who were\ndeported, and many of them didn\u2019t come back. And some were Jewish, and the other were\nCatholic. And they came from all walk of life, and if you look at -- I -- I think I -- I may have\ngiven it to Stan for those -- but if you look at the ages, you can see, it was truly a popular\nmovement, had all ages, classes, education, or lack of education. Along the river Po, the -- the\nriver, there are boats, and -- there are boats, and the network of people who knew the woods, in\nPavia, in Biyaivino, in Mortara, Novara, it was unbelievable. But again, the churches were very\nimportant, and the confessional were very important. And the people went to the confession, who\nhad never gone to confession before. And they were certainly not confessing sin. It was a mean\nof communication, improvised very often, but what struck me was how people can sum up the\ncourage to do things when they haven\u2019t thought about doing, or they would ever to, or -- or\nregret, and of course, many of them were deported. I remember one woman, a -- a peasant who\nhid in her farm some people, and -- and when her husband was taken -- the reason I went to see\nher, with another member -- another student, was to bring some money, and to wins -- you know,\nsee what she needs, and -- and I always remember, they had been married many years. And she\nsaid, \u201cHe was such a good man.\u201d He was such a good man. I still see her face. Those things, I\ndon\u2019t know. And I got tired in doing my work sometime, I -- I think about those wonderful,\nordinary people. They will never be famous. I can\u2019t even remember her name, but to me, they\nembodied -- people who in my judgement are an ornament to the human spirit. I\u2019m sorry about\nthis, I -- I don\u2019t know. I never saw her again, afterwards. But 1-it -- I like the idea that the\nunderground was so caring about organizing assistance, and -- and thing. Let me clean my nose.",
        "A: Unfortunately --",
        "A: Unfortunately, there were some people among these mass of wonderful, dedicated,\ncourageous people, some people were spies. They were informant, and I am not so sure that it\nwas only ideology. In one of our discussion, 1n trying to understand the infiltrator, in order to\nprevent infiltration in our group, one of the discussion with a doctor, centered on what type of\npersonality we had to be careful about. Not necessarily -- if they -- they are two anti-Naz1, anti-\nFascist, too much, they -- they reminded us of Macbeth, the ladies doth protest too much. And in\n-- some of these senior people were trying to explain to us the factors -- in the human factors,\npsychologically, especially a doctor -- I believe his name is Gross\u00e9, I have to check it, he was\nworking at the Hospitality Niguarda, and he treated a victim of torture, but they were trying to\nexplain to us, in our work, we had to be very careful of some people who would offer, it could\nhave been a trap, they may have -- may have been suspect, and -- but also there are people who\nare so needy of protection, whichever power is in power. And has nothing to do with Fascism, it\ncan be any.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side, B",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And they -- who will offer their services. Some are psychopaths, no question. People who --\nwho used torture, for example. Many of the high ranking people didn\u2019t touch themselve the\nprisoner, they had these thugs in the interrogation places who did the dirty work. And la -- later\non in my own experience, many -- th-the officer was content to serve these people. But they\nneeded them, they used them, and but o -- whether our senior were teaching us to be very\ncareful, and try to explain to us why we should be very careful of such people, because in\nworking in the underground, you have people who come and offer, and then you always pretend\nthat you don\u2019t know anything about it, you don\u2019t know whats they are talking about, you know,\nbecause it could be a trap. And I thought there ta -- a-and they always came suggested by\nsomebody that you knew. So, you always pretended you don\u2019t know anything about it, and then\nyou say, \u201cOh maybe we see each other some other time, but you know, I can\u2019t help you, I cannot\ndo anything,\u201d etcetera, etcet -- then you check with the other people. So it becomes kind of\nskucky, we call it. I don\u2019t know how you would [indecipherable]",
        "A: Chess game, you know.",
        "A: To go and [indecipherable] and this. The churches, by and large, were reliable, I would say,\nup to 90 percent. But even so, 10 percent of people who were not reliable, but also if the SS, the\nGestapo, and the Black Brigade went to their church regularly. And there were Catholic the\nNazi, who went to church regularly, who attended the service, who became friend with the priest.\nAnd according to the priest, you know, it was just s-serving a Christian. Now, what I also learned\nwas there was some educated German Christian, who were helpful to us. Very, very helpful. And\nthe way we communicated was in Latin. Heh, heh, heh, don\u2019t speak German. But in Latin we\ncould communicate. And needless to say, we checked and counterchecked. But some German\nregular army people were very helpful.",
        "A: Probably approximately 100.",
        "A: But, we knew th -- each family. We n -- cousin, rela -- friends, and like let\u2019s say, these 20, for\nexample, they had a wonderful property in Piedmont. They could hide people, they were also\nupper class. And they could shelter people, but also, they were respected people. Enrico\nMullisanno, the family Mullisanno, highly respected. Now, the Ritsini were from monarchy\netcetera, but highly respected. So their son -- they have a son Enrico, and they knew people. Now\nthe Mullisanno daughter were two years old, and four years old. But their cousin in social circle,\npeople that you have known for a long time -- and you knew very much who was a Fascist, more\nor less. That the pro SS and Gestapo, there were very few upper class, or well-educated people.\nMany of the upper class Italian joined the resi -- supported the Resistance, because of the allies,\nbecause of the British. Not necessarily for the American [indecipherable]. Max Salvadore was an\nital -- an American -- Italian American, he work with the British Intelligence Services. He had\nloads of contact in Italy. And some other prominent exile, anti-Fascist Italian, had contact with\nItalian intellectual and aristocracy, or banking. Banking was another area, and industry was\nanother air -- marini, [indecipherable] one of them was. Either way, they had contact then they\nkept, regardless of the war, like in -- Switzerland was the place where they could meet. And\nthat\u2019s where Bustelli, and Lydia, and others came, so -- were so important to that. In Switzerland,\nnobody mentioned, then Switzerland allowed many Jewish people, not always, some were sent\nback, and were killed. But in the Teechino area, where Bustelli was, they had the resi -- this.\nSeptember, 1943, when the disaster occurred, the Armistice, the Swiss allowed the Italian Army\npeople to take refuge in camps in Switzerland. And those camps were -- many people were\nexpert in military affair, as well as Intelligence, as well as Morse code, and things like that. So,\neventually, some Intelligent people, with the help of Italian, likes Max Salvadore for example,\nand later on Max Gorbol, they recruited people from these camps. And Aurora Wilomin who\ndied, was executed, she used to go and get the people who had been selected, to bring back to\nItaly, to help in the undergrounds. That\u2019s one important ti -- who did the communication?\nHousewife, farmer, student, children. They killed a young boy in Piazzo Larret, I believe he was\n14 years old, was a messenger -- was a stuffetta. You know, it\u2019s -- and the camps, the military\ncamps were very important in Switzerland, also the object of penetration by the Nazi. In fact, the\nNazi Fascist sent spies to 1 -- to get information about who was selected to come to Italy. And\nonce again, Lydia, Bustelli, and -- and all -- and the network of people, were very important in\nthe communication. And a communication from one post to the other was done by either women,\nor boys, or girl. In bicycle, on a horse, cart, or whatever. So it was -- [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, the Nazi and Fascist were suspa -- suspecting everybody. After all, remember that while\nwe do it -- the peaceful work in assistance, there was also the underground then blew up the\nrailway, blew up the partisan -- the Italian partisan, the band then -- then formed after September,\nthey attack German and Nazi Fascist post in order to get arms, because they didn\u2019t have much.\nSo they would organize, and some of the people who joined the partisan had been professional\nmilitary people, particularly the Alpini in Baldosta, the Alpini, who were very good at climbing,\nwho were very good at exercise, and -- and the German and the Nazi Fascist were determined to\n-- to get rid of them. But communication could not done by telephone, or t -- or e-mail, you\nknow. Everything was done by voice, at most one page. But it was very, very, very serious. And\nthat was rare, terribly rare. And code. We had one pad code, and I got it that once it was used, it\ngoes in the wastepaper basket, because that was the most secure way of communicating. I need a\nbreak.",
        "A: Yes, I -- I was living w-with my parents in Milan, and I was able to see also my nurse, my\nwet nurse, in the countryside. And we stayed in the countryside, because the mil -- Milan was\nbombed night after night by the ally, especially August 1943, lots of bombing took place, and so\nwe rented a place in the country, and I could see also my wet nurse, th -- at a farm, like many\nthousand of Milanese, because many of the building were destroyed by the bombing.\nTransportations was destroyed. The building blocked streets, bi -- the ma -- the -- when they\nwere bombed, all the material, the -- the rubbles. Or whether [phone ringing]. Oh dear.",
        "A: Okay, now, at that time, July, August, af-after the Mussolini fell, it was chaotic in Milan, and\nin addition to the kills -- political kills, there were the bombing by the allied, especially in\nAugust, 1943, and waves after waves of bomber came, and we stayed in the countryside. And we\ncould see at night the city of Milan, red -- th-the sky was red, and hear all these airplane, and you\nknow, you understand that in order to end this war, they had to bomb, because once again,\nalthough Mussolini was gone, Badoglio took over the government, Badoglio with the king, and\nhe said, la guerra continma, and it was not an -- so people had to get out of the cities or industrial\ncenters, even nearby, like sise to San Giovanni or other, and find places in the country, it was\nhorrible. The transportation was not working, the train were packed, whatever, it all -- it was\nterrible. But we lived outside, and then we came back, around the beginning of September, to\nMilan, and it was at that time that -- and my parents told me that if anything should happen, and\nthere should be a ashugamano, a ashugamano, this is to dry your hands, a -- a cloth, on the\nwindow, I should not go home, but should go and see Enrico Mullisanno if possible, or -- so, on\nSeptember, my mother gave me some money to buy some sweater from Louisa Spanoli, which is\nstill existing, and it was going back to school, to prepare for going back to school possibly, but\neverything was in chaos. And I went, and I had this money, and the store was closed, so I had\nthis cash on me. And then when I arrived home, I saw the ashugamano on the window, and there\nwas a black car. And we call them the black maria, which were car used by the police to pick up\nJewish people, or anti-Fascist. And we had, in a family living nearby, and the father simply had\nvanished. And in August, in spite of the bombing, my father had asked me to drive his car, a\nsmall car, to drive the children of this family, to Valdentelvi, and stay with our friend Hua\nPastore, and bring the children to Switzerland with the help of Tonio, who was a smuggler, and\nthe Pastore, who were dear, dear friend, an elderly couple who [indecipherable] known for many,\nmany, many years. And try to do what I could. He gave me some money, and you know -- then,\nin September, I realized I couldn\u2019t go home, so it was getting late, and there was a curfew, so I --\nthere was a bombed out building, and I remember a -- something dangling, chair, or something\ndangling with the floor from the ceiling, and it was a bombed out place, and I -- it was getting\nlate, I felt like crying, so I stayed in that place instead of trying to go all the way to Viatalaggio,\nwhere the Mullisanno lived, because I realized it would have been too far away to go, and I may\nnot make it, and the city was literally in chaos. The Fascists were beginning to look all over the\nplace for young people. The military people were trying to shed their uniform, be on civilian\nclothes, and trying to find a place to escape, and there were thousand of people in Milan in that\nsituation, when the armistice was announced. Nevertheless, the police were still hunting people.\nAnd -- and that was the last time, I -- I was never able to see my parents again after that, but then\nEnrico, and Mary, and all the other really embraced me, and -- and also, there were some funds,\nin cash then were available, but the underground, the Resistance took care of paying the rent,\nproviding minimum for food, clothes. Clothes were very difficult, everything was coupons, for\nfood, coupon for this, coupon for that, and with the armistice, the king, Badoglio, and the\ngovernment fled to the south, leaving the people, the navy, the army, the air force in shamble.\nThe headquarter of the air force, where I had been working with Enrico, all these officers, they\ntried to take as much documentation as they could, so we were helping to put away stuff, and\nprevent looting. But people came in and too -- and looted everything they could. It was a horror,\nand few people can imagine what it means for a government allied with a country, like the Italian\ngovernment allied with the Germans, and then have an armistice with the ally, who are the\nenemy, the American, and the British, and the other, and flee, leaving the people, the armed\nforces of all, asbandati, alone. And the German had already suspected the armistice would come,\nand therefore quietly had already beg -- not quietly, everybody knew it. They began sending via\nthe Brenner Pass, SS, Gestapo Panzer. And they are prepared the plan to take a -- intensify the\ncleaning -- ethnic cleaning of the Jewish people. Simultaneously to arrest all the people who\nwere suspect of being anti-Fascist, and anti-Nazi. And then, of course, to capture all people who\nhad been in the navy, air force, army, or armed force, everybody, to be deported for labor --\nallegedly, for labor, to Germany. So again, they used their tru -- th-the railway, not to help\npeople to come back into the city, or send them ba -- to transport [indecipherable] people than\nthey took, allegedly for labor, and the immediate work of the Resistance was to organize\nassistance. And that organization was -- POW was let out of the camps. When I met Leo Valiani,\nand spoke to him, as well as I spoke to Ricardo Lombardi and others, \u201cHow many people did the\nItalian ordinary people help to escape?\u201d And he said, \u201cPrissipoco diachemila.\u201d App-\nApproximately 10,000 people, which did not surprise me. But people immediately helping\neverybody. The -- the Italian military of all, air force, navy, mari, everybody, army. Jewish\npeople, and a lot of POW, who were let out of the camps, the camps were open, the prisoner of\nwar were open, and so these young people, these prisoner, young and middle aged, disbanded all\nover they could go, seeking -- hiding in the farm, and every place, because the German began\nimmediately trying to recapture them, and force the Italian military -- of military age, who had\nbeen in the services, immediately recruited them for deportation to Germany, allegedly for --\nthey were rebuilding things. So, it was chaos.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think they knew I existed at that time. But, it -- the Mullisanno, the Ritsini,\nContamessa, and everybody else, who had alre -- was already organized with groups in the\nunderground, already, but immediately they said, \u201cNever go near your place, never go near your\nnurse, never go near your close friend.\u201d No sisamide, we don\u2019t know. And above all, there was\nthe work of organizing assistance, and that\u2019s what we focused on, immediate assistance, because\nstreets were blocked by the German tank, few days, and they were looking for young people, for\nyoung men, ital -- and for Jewish people, and our job was to work with hundreds of other ch --\nyoung children, women, men, to be the mobile telephone, human telephone from block to block,\nand the German are blocking the Immocatcho, they [indecipherable], the German are blocking\nsuch and such a street. The German are blocking such and such a street, etcetera. And to help\npeople escape off -- unfortunately many were caught, because there was no way we could find\ncivilian clothes for everybody, so we did the best we could. As far as POW, was e -- very\ndifficult, because the shoes never fit, the clothes were too sm-small for those tall -- especially\nAustralian, or -- but they w -- there were woods around the city, around Milan, Pavia, Biyaivano,\nthere were woods, so many of the people were trying to escape, escaped to woods, and then there\nwere farms, and then there were convents. Some convents, for example, were pilgrim at -- used\nto go through and find shelter to go to Rome, or whatever. [indecipherable] became places where\npeople could find some shelter, temporary, of course, and then the Swiss border. The Swiss\nborder was our salvation in many way. And that\u2019s when the smuggler, who had made a living\nwith smuggling, with contrabando for centuries, they knew where every passage was. And they,\nwith very few exception, all of -- with few exception, they became our greatest helper. Men,\nwomen, children, 1t was an im -- unimaginable display of the solidarity of the human spirit.\nNeedless to say, unfortunately, they were all saying filtrator, o-or infiltrated themself with the\nmilitary in the Swiss camp, which were made available to the Italian Army, Navy, Air Force, and\n-- and specialists. But by and large, it was a message of how ordinary people did a s --\nextraordinary thing, in extraordinary, difficult times.",
        "A: Well, it was not easy, because you had to have -- first of all, you would be -- I mean, we\u2019re\nseveral places where we were living, working, hiding, and only the central group knew how to\nreach us, and the stuffetta, like I can mention one, Nino Benedetti, for example, he was only 15\nor 16, he was extraordinary, Jako Padentichay, Meno Scapolla, or me -- and many f -- children of\nFrance, in cri -- 12 - 13 - 14- 15, and women. And [indecipherable] people, old people, young pe\n-- it was a -- they would be sent to communicate with this church, with this convent, with this\nfarm, with this office, and say there are two paci, tre paci, une paco. Paco was the word for a\nperson, so, chi serrano tre paci, kari verrano en Viama Kerajoya. Well, three packages, which\nwere [indecipherable] Kerajoya, they didn\u2019t tell us how tall they were, how fat or thin, or young,\nor old. And so the most important thing was trying to have food, which was very, very scarce.\nAnd here I have to tell a story, because it\u2019s really -- we can laugh. The Fascist had a habit of\npreaching that we had to sacrifice for the welfare of the country, and we have to stick to your\nration, etcetera, but we all knew then some -- not all, some were very honest, some believed in\nFascism, and there were some who were very corrupt people. And when you have a dictatorship,\nyou will always have corrupt people. And we knew then very often, they arrested people who\nhad nagotsi a store of fromage, fr -- cheese and salami, and prosciutti, but who were rationed,\neverything was rationed, or brought in from the countryside, and there were often rice subtracted\nto the forced giving than the Fascists had implemented at that time. You must give this, you\nmake -- you work, and you produce five sacks of rice, well, one has to go to the government, and\nthey came, and th -- to the farm, and looked, and -- and checked, and counterchecked, and if a\nfarmer had not pr -- given everything, and they found something, it was the prison. And\ndeportation even at -- ot [indecipherable]. Well, what we did, we found that one of these Fascists\nhad a kashaday, a cellar full of food. Salami, cheese, so one -- Guido was his name, he and others\norg -- first of all, they requisitioned a truck from the Fascists, pretending to be Fascists. Then\nthey went to this place, and they loaded everything they could find, and believe me, there was\nsalami and cheese, prosciutto, and you name it, it was incredible. Butter, scarce as one can be.\nFarina for polenta, rice. Anyway, they made it available to us to use for the people who were\nhiding, and I must confess, and I was very happy. I know then you don\u2019t steal, but in these\nparticular circumstances, I was very happy. And this is some of the food that we actually use,\nand we stored it with the help of Mrs. Columbo in the cellar, where we could share it with other -\n- and I have to confess that I gorged myself too.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: It was a -- it was a network of people, I wouldn\u2019t know the name of the people who brought --\nlet\u2019s say -- let\u2019s take Viama Kerajoya, although I can -- there were many other places, I\u2019m using\nthis as an example. Quickly, we were given three apartments in this building, and plus another\napartment in Viama Kerajoya, in another building. And when we got the notice duo paci, tre\npaci, etcetera, the only apartment we could not use ourself, but was used by the underground,\nwas the fifth floor. And we stay away from that. Well, we would get from the potinaya, from the\nconcierge, this little note that there would be duo paci, tre paci, quattro paci, and we would have\nsomebody staying all the time. And these were like -- for example, this girl, I don\u2019t remember\nher name, except then she was lame. I can\u2019t remember her name now. She died of TB later, after\nthe war. But there was a whole group of children, of friends, women, old men, and everybody\ntook turn, but then it was us who were familiar with the border, who had to take the person to the\nnext step. And for me, it was Aljanio, or 1t was Como, and not just for me, but for all the friends\nin the group of the mountains. These would be mountain loving people that young -- young girl,\nlike all that group then, is gone now.",
        "A: All right.",
        "A: I\u2019m getting too tired, you know.",
        "A: I have to eat something now.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m [indecipherable]\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "A: Well, one of the difficulty we had in the underground was that we always had to be careful\nabout infiltrator into our group of assistance to the prisoner. And we have to remember that we\nassisted family and prisoner. There were people who were working, helping the war effort, for\nthe allies, for the Committee of National Liberation in Milan, and elsewhere. Torino, Valdosta,\nval -- everyplace. And one of the difficulty we had was when a person was taken, the\ninterrogation in depth, which meant torture, led to picking up other people. And I would never\nblame anyone for speaking under torture, because it\u2019s unbelievable the horror than they can\nperpetrate on human being. One of the places in Milan where the prisoner were taken was San\nVittory, and there was a special section which was controlled by the SS, and the moti. The SS\nhad control of the prisoner brought there. Usually their major interest was 1n information, people\nwho are work -- working to gather information useful to the allies in the war effort. One of the\nkey people in that accession of the SS, was named Hugo Osteria. Hugo Osteria had been a\npoliceman -- political policeman for the Ovra, the secret police of Mussolini, or the Fascists,\nthroughout that period. And when, after September eight, the -- he began working for the SS, and\nthe Gestapo in San Vittory, in the section specialized in -- in interrogation. Besides Hugo\nOsteria, there was a -- a man, whose name was Franz, and he had huge dogs that he didn\u2019t mind\nunleashing on the prisoner. And another, Sawecki, something like that, s -- li -- Sawecki -- s -- I\ncan\u2019t remember the spelling, Sawecki. He was an SS captain. Hugo Osteria was the interpreter\nfor the SS, for the Gestapo in that particular area. So, he approached the committee of National\nLiberation, and said, \u201cI want to help you.\u201d So he would give us the name of the people detained\nin the particular area if he could, and also to let us know what was happening. Needless to say,\nwe had other sources, mostly the suarai, the nun, the doctor, being careful, but was one. The\nbaker was another one who was very helpful. And -- but Hugo Osteria became important. So,\nwhat he did was sometime he let people be tortured, deported to Germany. Among them was\nJainjo Bamphi, the brother of Senator Arialdo Bamphi, a-and the husband of Mrs. Bamphi,\nwhom I met, and she described that it was Hugo Osteria who arrested Jainjo Bamphi in their\nhome. So Julianna -- Julia Bamphi told me he played the double game, because he helps them,\nand he help usually important people, of the Committee of National Liberation, like Ferucho\nParai, then later on, at the end of the war, would testify on his behalf. But many other people,\nlike Jako Perdenti, Cheenira Scapolla, and Jainjo Bamphi were not only tortured, but then\ndeported to Mauthausen, where they died. And this was typical of this man, and other working\nfor the Nazi and the Fascist. Then they would give the Committee of National Liberation, and the\nchurch, information about certain prisoner, or arrange for money to be paid to somebody by\nsome family desperate to get help for their prisoner. But essentially, you never knew. Certainly\nshe never trusted them, and eventually the allies decided that this man was so unreliable that he\nhad to be shipped in the southern part of Italy. And Bustelli told me how he -- he was a S-Swiss\nIntelligent Services, how he, personally felt for a long time than this man was a prototype of\npolitsiato, political politsiato, never to be trusted, that he would give some help when it was\npossibly beneficial for him in the future, in the political settlement after the war. But helped to\narrest people, did a lot of damage, used informer, and unfortunately, because of the double game,\nmanaged to gain the trust of some people in the underground, which led to disastrous results.\nYeah.",
        "A: But you can understand why I just don\u2019t want to [inaudible]. Excuse me. I wanted Hugo\nOsteria to be known as a skunk. But we have also cristori, police chief, who were asked to keep\ntheir job. It was very important than they stayed where they were. They had access to curfew\npaper, so that people could say, I\u2019m a doctor, I\u2019m a nurse, I need to travel after the curfew is\nimplemented, and were very helpful. One of the first thing when the Committee of National\nLiberation did was to have false identity card made for various people, Jewish, Catholic, the\npeople working in the underground, and -- so, there was this man, whose name was Joe\nBacigalupi. I don\u2019t know where he came from, except that he was wonderful. Joe Bacigalupi\nwork with the Committee of National Liberation, and he was a genius. What he did, according to\nmy friend in the Resistance movement, and I was the beneficiary of his work for our people,\nwhat he did was to say to the cristori, \u201cLook, this was is going to be won by the allies, not by the\nFascists. If you help us, we will help you, and many other people.\u201d Now, I don\u2019t know why they\n-- he needed help, I have no idea, I don\u2019t know. What they asked him to do was to -- the\nunderground asked him to ask the cristori for a list of the best forgerer, who had been either in\nprison in Milan, or were in prison because of forgery. So Joe Bacigalupi became the number one\nspecialist in doing forged document. And was an enormous help, because we helped, working as\ncleaning people, cleaning floor, latrine, and other, for the Fascist, and for the German. And\nbecause you are a cleaner, doing meaning job, they don\u2019t consider you a person who has hear,\nand -- you know, all what they knew was that we were cleaner, perfect beggar, peasant, and --\nand they would talk quite freely around people, because they didn\u2019t think that we wa -- but\namong all, was to steal. To steal some blank -- blank paper which were the koolfer -- call curfew\nfor the lushapasari. And that was very important, because --",
        "A: Lushapasari means those papers, official paper that allowed people to travel after curfew was\nimplemented. But then it happen -- Joe Bacigalupi, and the team of forgerer, when they had this,\nthen it was their job to duplicate, raticate, etcetera, and make it available, and there was some for\nthe doctor, some for the people of assistance, and many -- false, of course, but the German\ncaught on of that. So every once in awhile, every two or three months, and they would change\nthe papers. So here we go, the cleaning lady, the cleaning ti -- di -- or boys, or whatever, and --\nand we had to take some more, or sometime we worked as cleaning lady from some Fascist and\nonners, and get some more, but Joe Bacigalupi, and with the cooperation of the cristori, the\npoliceman, whoever, he managed to get the list of all the forgerer. He was best forgerer in -- in\nMilan, and for other paper. We were told at that time, that the allied in Switzerland had botched a\njob of duplicating false paper, which caused immediately the arrest of the two people who were\ncarrying this false paper into Italy from Switzerland, so Joe Bacigalupi said, \u201cDamn it, how\nstupid. Those allies my have much money and all that, but they don\u2019t know how to do things.\u201d\nAnd he was right. Eventually he was arrested. Eventually, with the help of the inside guard, a\nkey was left unattended, so that he could walk out at lunchtime when everybody was busy eating.\nSo this is some of my recollection. And then of course, his paper were very important for people\nto bring to Switzerland, and all people were sent from Switzerland. But then, in Switzerland too,\nwe had a problem. On one point, an infiltrator, I believe his name was Cherasa, but I\u2019m not\ncertain. I believe so. He managed to go into one of these camps for Italian military, where he\nlearned about plans by the allies, and -- to get people out, and he managed to get out and report\nto the -- San Vittory, to Hugo, and to the other group, what this Italian prisoner in the Swiss\ncamp were planning, how they were selecting specialists, be the kind of job then that Aurora did\nin bringing back into Italy these people to help in the underground, cause the ally needed help\nwith specialists in demolition, for railway, for bridges, and so some Italian were very happy to\nget out of the camp, and help the allies to -- to do these kind of jobs. So you needed people to be\nvery careful in the camps because of infiltrator, like this Cherasa, who they managed to get out,\nand go to report to Hugo, and to these people. And you needed specialists in demolition, se --\nothers. But the reason I think about Aurora was that here was a young woman in her 20, who\ngave her life to help.",

Again, these are thing that we had no idea, but she and the network working with her, and\nthe network with erking in Milan, all together, taught us. We were really greens on this matter.\nBut the farmer, and the Pastore deser -- an-and then there was the guardida finansa, who were the\nItalian treasuries. Some of them remained faithful to Fascist, but few of them. The others all\nhelped. So that when passages had to be done, organized by a, the network of the smart lerrer,\nand both Lydia from the Italian point, and Bustelli from the Swiss point, but there were a\nthousand of people working in the whole network. Then, it was very important in the guardida\nfinansa, the Italian one, would turn their back so that we could do it. One of our job was to patch\nthe holes. Now, the arrangement for passing between Bustelli, and Lydia, and their network,\nbecause obviously, was big network, was done by arrangement with special bell put on the collar\nof the goats. And the signal of the bell suggested the place of passing. It was an organization, but\nthe -- of course, we have to remember, the smuggler have been there for thousand of years. After\nthe war, they became restaurant owner, bar owner, and we had the joy of meeting, my husband\nand I, and my son, actually, as well, and dot -- and granddaughter, we went to meet one of them\nin the Easala comatchina, on the Lake of Como, where there is a marvelous restaurant, and is run\nby s -- former smuggler, and their children, and their sa -- children now of course in their 40 and\n50. So it\u2019s really an homage to ordinary people once again, but this woman deserve special\nrecognition for --",
        "A: Lydia. She -- I believe she never went beyond the third grade, but her capacity for organizing\nwas incredible. Also her courage, and there are stories that we don\u2019t have time to go into it, but\none brief one was that on one occasion, a man than she taught was with us, sent by the\nCommittee of National Liberation in Milan. Turned out that he -- she helped him to go to the\nmilitary camp. From there he learned a great deal, then he -- and then he came back and started\nher home, and she realized that he was a Nazi. At this point, two partisan came at her home, with\nguns. And this man, of course, also could do something. And Lydia said to the two partisan,\n\u201cPlease, please, I have two small daughter. If you kill him, then the whole village will be burned.\nEverything will be burned, and we will lose everything. So please go away, go away.\u201d And they\ndid. So this Nazi man took Lydia to Milan, probably to the SS, she doesn\u2019t know where they\ntook her. They sat her in a room where they gave her a big meal, and she thought this was her\nlast supper. Then somebody came, took her by train back to Ronaggo, to the train station, gave\nher a note. Inside there was two gold coins, one for each of her daughter, and a little note. \u201cYou\nsaved my life, I am now saved yours. But there will be no next time.\u201d So Lydia was so terrified\nby this experience, that she went to the home in the Swiss side of a friend and very active\nmember of the underground, and she went to sleep. And when she woke up -- these man had the\npenchant for putting mask with colored lights all over around the room. So when she woke up,\nshe saw all these mask with all these lights, and she screamed, \u201cAyuto, ayuto, ayuto.\u201d And -- and\nall of a sudden, a -- several young men in trunk, because it was hot, arrived, beautiful young men\nwho were waiting to pass through the Italian-Swiss border, to come to Italy to work. And she\nsaid to me, \u201cWell, when I saw all those beautiful young men, I thought, if this is hell,\u2019 because\nshe thought she was in hell, ayuto, \u201cif this is hell, I will stay.\u201d",
        "A: Ayuto means help, help.",
        "A: So Shirley Dondr\u00e9a came with me, and we went with -- you know, with Lydia, we saw this\nbeautiful villa. The owner was working with the underground, but he was also a major\nentrepreneur, traffic dinart, the Swiss knew it. But when he died, he left everything to Lydia, and\n-- because she helped, saved his life many times. But anyway, this Shirley and I -- I think Shirley\ntook a -- pictures of this room with all the mask, with the colored light, and so we had a jolly\ngood laugh at that time, and realized that the war was really over, we could talk about it.",
        "A: Oh -- oh no.",
        "A: No, far from it. We knew about the famous Lydia, but -- she did other things that are\nincredible, such as she dressed like a bride, with a man dressed like a groom. From Milan they\nretrieved very precious material which was on a truck. And dressed like a bride and a groom,\nthey crossed the borders, raising her sk-skirt flirtatiously with the German border, and then as\nsoon as they arrived, then she has a -- a str -- tremendous number of people who came out of the\nwoods to help unload the truck, because it cor -- contained precious material than the Swiss\ncould not get. And so Bustelli commissioned her to organize from Milan, this truck, loaded with\nthis precious material, dressed like a bride, cross the border with a groom, and then as soon as\nthey were on the other side, say this band of bandits -- I mean no, they were -- came out, and\napparently, from what I learned from others, she had a stick and ran and said, \u201cFaster, faster,\nfaster, get it out.\u201d Because they were afraid then the German would realize the trick, and go after\nthem. But this is Lydia for you. You saw her picture. No, then she thought that I was dead, or --",
        "A: So she said the mass, and so when I went to see Guido Bustelli with Leonard, and he\u2019s\n[indecipherable] died, and said, \u201cLydia is here.\u201d Well, it was a very emotional reunion. And let\nme show you a picture of Lydia in [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh yeah, these are the -- when we became honorary citizen, [indecipherable] I\u2019m looking for\nme there. You can look at [indecipherable]",
        "A: This is [indecipherable] lady, we had of the Institute Historical the -- Resistance.",
        "A: In Baldosta.",
        "A: This is the mayor, this is his assistant, who works there all the time, and she speaks English.\nOkay, here is Lydia.",
        "A: This is Titiana.",
        "A: Oh this was -- this 1s Titiana. This was two years ago.",
        "A: When we became honorary citizen.",
        "A: Well, look at the --",
        "A: Oh, of Brusonne.",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "A: This is Lydia. That was the day we were made -- I have a short film about that day.",
        "A: This is Leonard and Ginetta.",
        "A: This is the priest, here\u2019s Titiana. This is Roberto Nico, the historian.",
        "A: And this is the mayor, with Titiana. This is all the Valdosta. Was a very emotional day.",
        "A: And Leonard. See, he had regained quite a bit after surgery.",
        "A: I\u2019m so grateful to life than gave us that extra time. There 1s some member of the media. Let\u2019s\nsee. This is Steve. I don\u2019t have to go to the doctor, he comes [indecipherable]. Okay, this are the\ntwo great partisan leader. This was the father of Titiana.",
        "A: Tiba. Monsieur Tiba.",
        "A: Tiba. I gave you a copy of the picture with Tiba. And this 1s Lydia.",
        "A: That was a luncheon after the ceremony. The two great smuggler, y -- cause he alt with the\nValdosta, and she was the Valdentelvi.",
        "A: Yeah. We laughed with his wife be -- whom I saw recently, that\u2019s when we took the pictures.\nIt\u2019s a good picture.",
        "A: What an intelligent woman.",
        "A: Leonard.",
        "A: He\u2019s my husband.",
        "A: We are singing all the partisan song.",
        "A: Is a good picture of Leonard.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Anyway.",
        "A: Well, what a life.",
        "A: About who?",
        "A: Oh. Because our friend -- well, first of all, I was sent in Valdosta. Now this is important. I\nhave written about it. One of the underground activity was to organize people, sometime to go\nand evaluate the disaster made by certain destroy policy, by the Nazi in the valley, where we had\nso many partisan. And in Valdosta, in particularly Valtoonage, there was a very important group\nled by Usmiani, called the U16, Usmiani. And Buerkio. Buerkio was the professor at the\nUniversity of Pavia. And he had access to my apartment, in fact, he personally often came on\nemergency, for instruction, also for training, for other people involved, into valdo -- Valdosta,\nand other, where the eevrie adeeoli veti company. The people at the high level, chief executive\nofficer, and others, all these people had homes in -- in Cherveenia for skiing, in the valleys. That\nwas normal. But was also a center, in Valtoonage, for transmitting to the allies, informations via\nthese whom -- I didn\u2019t know who it was. However, I was told that after the Rustellimenti, there\nwas this page, then -- there is one page that you can copy, there was a frantic telephone call -- not\ntelephono, some me -- some message, radio, whatever, I don\u2019t know exactly, to the Committee of\nNational Liberation saying why the Germans -- the Nazi are negotiating in oursta with the\nchurch, and the representative of the partisan bands, or the truvalai, bartonunch, valdayass,\ndressonai. They are actually already starting towns to go, and people dressed in camouflage,\nincluding some very cruel troops, already starting to catch the partisan on their back -- clean up\nthe valley. So here they were negotiating in oursta. The church in good faith. Tito, or ever, who\nis the commander of the Valtoonage did not go personally, as he was asked to do, but send\nsomebody, because he sensed -- he smelled somebody. So there was this frantic call, or\ncommunication from Valdosta to Milan, to the Committee of National Liberation. The\ninformation had come from -- I was told, from somebody who went to a beauty parlor from our\nside, who heard either a Fascist or a Nazi woman, or mistress, or somebody saying, \u201cOh yeah,\nthey are negotiating with the church, but they are going to clean up. The German are already\nstarted.\u201d Something like that. So, immediately, there was this one page, frantic communication to\nValdosta, it was too late. We lost a lot of people, it was horrible. Many people were killed, and\nthere was a traitor who was working right next to Tito. And when the time came for this person\nto go and give the meecha, the fire to the bridge, so then the tank couldn\u2019t go, he killed the other\nperson with it. So -- and he had been with -- with us for three months and nobody realized that he\nwas a double. But this I confirmed with Monsieur Tiba, when I saw him. And I spoke to Tito a\nfew years ago about all this. So, after this disaster, we lost a lot of people, including young\npeople that we had send up, because they didn\u2019t want to go to Switzerland, they wanted to\nparticipate in the active Resistance movement, so we send them up to the banns. And among\nthem a young man, Hoos Franco from either Maltarra, or Pavia, very close by, but actually, we\nwere involved, our group was involved. Soon after all this disaster occurred, I was told by a\nfriend, member of our group, the Benedetti, who was a mountain climber, and his son was\nworking with us, he wife was working with us, that it was very important to go up to Valtoonage,\nand assess the damage, but more importantly, it was very important to go to the house of\npierovono, one of the guide, one of the Alpinist, and only since last dega -- August, I knew -- I\nlearned that he was part of this special group, like Lashincross, I didn\u2019t know before. As far as\nwe knew, we were all in the underground, working. And these gentlemen, these architect, would\ncome and pick me up at -- sometime early in the morning. He had all the permit, and he had a\nhouse, he owned a home in Chervinia. His name was architect Molino. Never met him in my life,\nbut I was supposed to be his mistress. And, \u201cBut he\u2019s a gentleman, Ginetta, you don\u2019t have to\nworry, but we need somebody to go up with him, he own a house, and he has a perfect reason to\nsee if damage was done, to fix it for the winter, and he has his mistress with him.\u201d And the\nmistress was me. And so jus -- lo and behold, here, in November come this gentleman, and kiss\nmy hand, and I go with him, he had all the passes, everything. And we arrived, traveling to a\nplace called Shationne. Shationne is right at the entrance of the Valtoonage. And we stopped. He\nwas going to place his car someplace in Shantionne, and we had to carry the knapsack. I ask my\nri -- I ask him if I could take a little suitcase, he said, \u201cYeah, if you feel like carrying that plus\nyour knapsack, go ahead,\u201d but, you know, I didn\u2019t bring, I put everything in the knapsack. But\nwe had to bring up some medicine, and we arrive in Shantionne, we go to this little bric and brac\nlittle store. This wonderful woman, Delphina was her name, and we chatted amiably, and then\nthis architect said to me, \u201cGo ahead, because I will catch up with you.\u201d Remember, I was in my\nteen, and he was probably 60, but he was much stronger. So it was obvious that he -- well, I\ndidn\u2019t think much, but 1t was obvious that he wanted to talk to her. Only in retrospect I figured\nall that out, but I didn\u2019t at the time. And we went, and we arrived in Valtoomage, and -- at the\nhouse of this family, and it was a -- all of the women were in black, they were -- well, they broke\ndown crying, because of the horror. And one of them described to me how Franco died. They\nkilled several people. In fact, about 10 years ago, I took a picture of the monument to those\npeople, and we went, and then I realized that we -- we wanted to stay in val -- I wanted to stay in\nValtoomage, and he, no, no, we have to go ahead. We went to Chervinia, and at the passage, at\nthe block passage, there was Italian young Fascist. Very energetic, very ideologically committed\npeople, but he had passes, and they were passes from the Gestapo, the SS, or some authority, and\nimmediately everybody was, oh, please let me help you, blah, blah, blah, and all kind, and -- and\nI thought, oh my God, you know, I -- I trust Benedetti, no -- no -- but at the same time, you are\nstartled. I never met this person, but he was kind. We arrived at his house, I was so tired. He\nhelped me to take off my shoes, made a fire, and gave me something to drink, and -- and then I\nlied down and I slept for awhile, and then he woke me up, and he said, \u201cWe have to go.\u201d And we\nwent to the home -- house owned by Pierovona in the same village. And we ha -- w-we had to\nretrieve some material, which we did, and I had to put them in my chest. Then, next day -- then I\nwent back to bed -- next day, I s -- had to say to the Fascist that were mocking me for being with\nsuch an old man, etcetera, etcetera, that the altitude was not good for me, I had to go back, and\nsay, \u201cOh yeah, this old man is no good, but we are good, come with us,\u201d blah, blah, blah all that\nsuns -- kind of stuff. But they were very helpful. And I was going to walk down, but then they\ndrove me down. And at the val -- at the end, th -- at Shationne, there was a little hotel where I\nwas supposed to stay. When the hotel keeper saw me arrive with this Fascist, he was as cold as\none can be, he said he -- yes, he had a room, but no food, nothing. So, well, I went to -- to the\nbedroom, and about one or two in the morning, there were shots fired in my room, the glass fu --\nso I went under the bed. Until the day before, the -- somebody from the Fascist or the Nazi used\nthis place. So the partisan thought then they were still there, but I was there, so I went under the\nthing. And about oh, few minutes later, some partisan came in with the red ankle chafe, and the\nmachine gun is -- \u201cWhere is she, where 1s she? Oh my God, what we have done?\u201d They knew,\nthey learned that I was there. So, the face of hotel keeper changed completely. He b -- the\npartisan actually, they said, libber, please give her some -- anything. So he brought out cheese\nand wine and bread, and -- and apologized. And then he put some coal in a scarbaletto. Is a\ngadget with a long handle, and inside put the coals, so that his wife warmed up the bed for me. I\nmean, it was such a change. And we -- next morning, I came down and he gave me -- I realized\nhe put something in my knapsack which was very good, cheese and a piece of meat. I arrived\nhome, and the apartment up above was where those two friends, and it was clear that something\nhad happened, the food was left. And so I quickly got out, as well as bring the material to\nViabeeli, and I was told then they were caught. So I began working with Dom Bickuli. And this\nPierro, that I still don\u2019t know, who was an elegant man, working with the cardinal, etcetera. And\nthe idea came, then I had to go and try to find hostages for exchange. That\u2019s little field that I\nhave, 1s one example. And the son of Corvul sent me, because he knew then I had -- we were\ndoing this. And I went north, all the way to another place, to another valley, up to Borneo.\nBorneo Livino. From Banktband with a password at each place, and -- and in Livino, I was told\nthan [indecipherable] for exchange with our friends in Milan. Well, that was February, beginning\nof February. I took the bus, because I couldn\u2019t walk any more, my feet were so swollen. And I\narrived in a place called Tiranno. And in Tiranno, the bus was surrounded, and -- and so that\u2019s\nhow I was arrested. And from Tiranno few days later, that was the brigatanari, to Sondrio. And\nto Sondrio, a very important story, because I saw someone died, and all sorts of thing. And then I\nwas really -- I brought Milan to the mouti, and I was told by a man whose name was Crome that\nI didn\u2019t speak, but they had the means to make me speak. I didn\u2019t doubt it, but I -- but then they\nreleased me because somebody said then, oh no, no, I was not involved. Two hours -- I was still\nblack and blue. Two hours later, one of the people from Sondrio, who had accompanied me to\nthe bi -- mouti in Milan, arrived. And he said, \u201cYou are not working, so you have to come to\nSondrio to work for us.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, I have an appointment with my doctor, because I\nhave some problem with my lungs.\u201d And, \u201cWell, you go and see your doctor and then you come\nback with us.\u201d So I went to the doctor, who was one of us, and the doctor meanwhile, had\narranged for my friend, Enrico Mullisanno to arrive, and they said, \u201cIf you have the courage to\ndo it, we would like you to -- to do it, to go back.\u201d Well, once they arrived back, it was clear that\nit was a ruse, too. And it was -- it\u2019s a long story, but the women of the Black Brigade were as bad\nas the men, and all of us remaining -- one was Bruno Bianci, whom I saw, and his wife was\nkilled, the order came from Mussolini headquarter, from -- that all the people who may have\nbeen involved in Intelligence gathering -- and evidently they sus -- suspected that I was --\nactually turnous, probably they were right, but I -- I didn\u2019t know -- they should be executed. And\nwhat they did was to make a sign that you were there voluntarily. They received a tremendous\namount of brand new money from someplace, and they made a sign than they had given us all\nthis money, when it was in fact they kept it, you know. And they wanted to interrogate me once\nagain, which was, you know, it was the end of the war. But there was something really cruel\nabout -- not all of them, at the point they were ready to be bad, but not all of them. Still holding\non to this -- what they were talk about? The special weapon that the German would use, and\nwould win the war after all, except after April thir -- 23. And they were talking about them, and\nI was on the floor. They didn\u2019t want to leave witnesses to what they had done. It was very\nimportant that I give the name of all our people, it was -- so, they were trying once again. When\nthe telephone rung, and somebody said than the German wanted to talk to me again. Well,\neverything was falling apart, but still they couldn\u2019t get it. And they were very angry that they\ndidn\u2019t dare to say no to the German, they still had an inferiority complex vis a vis of the German,\nI think. That\u2019s my personal impression. And -- and two people dressed in German uniform came\nin, and made jokes about these Italian sissy, that they fall down on the floor, and f -- you -- you\nknow. So the Italian dragged me up, but the German hold -- held me, and they took me out to the\ncar. And from there they took me to the hospital where the nun received me and helped me. But I\nonly learned later there were a number of people involved, not only for me, but for others, and\nGerman deserter was -- were asked to help. To intercept the communication in case the\nbrigatanari, the mouti, would check to see whether it was true, that you still -- no, they didn\u2019t\ntrust anybody. And so these people were risking their lives to -- to help us, to -- to survive. And\nit was from Bustelli, and -- and Lydia that they were part of the organizing with the help, with\nthe guardiri publicani. The guardiri publicani were Italian who were called to serve. If they\ndidn\u2019t, their father, their mother, would be beaten up, so they served, but they were our allies. So\nthere was a number of people involved in rescuing last minute people in the interrogation cells,\nbecause they knew that we would all be executed. And so, for a couple of days, in the hospital,\noh everything, you know, little broth, wonderful care. And -- but for two days, I was hidden, and\nthen one of the people from the underground in that area -- that\u2019s another story, it\u2019s too\ncomplicated, but apparently I saved his life, and, \u201cTorpelino, Torpelino,\u201d and then he came, and -\n- so then they brought me upstair and I was in a bed. I was ca -- I had been cleaned up, and I was\nbeing treated, and I had wonderful care. And then, I have to say, the Italian government did\nsomething that every government today should do for the people who are caught in such\ncircumstances. They took care of all the care, and I was in Sondolo, it is a place, used to be for\nTB only, but we were rec -- put there. And then, from there f -- until September, and then to\nanother place called San Martino di Castrotsa, in the mountains, for winter, and -- and then in\nBaratsai, f -- at the sea for a few months of treatment, and then I went to Scotland, and Paris, and\n-- and --",
        "A: February, 1945, beginning of February.",
        "A: And helped to get out in Apri -- on April 23\", 1945.",
        "A: No, not every day, but they would do -- not only to me -- and remember, I was just one of\nother people Bianchi. [indecipherable] time they took turn, first him, then me. They had a hand\ngenerator for electricity. And I get upset when some people say, well we have to stop armament,\nbecause that only will stop torture. That\u2019s ridiculous. Torture can be applied in any small unity,\nby any means, by anybody. And -- and I think by doing the -- the other, you divert the attention\nfrom the reality, that any lethal piddling group, can find a way and means to torture people,\nincluding in the prisons. And -- but these were sophisticated matord, and many people didn\u2019t\nmake it. Tiberio Pansini died under torture. And -- but also some people who were there, who\ntried to help. And you know, you could see in their eyes that -- and then of course, they did, they\nhelp you to escape. And also put out the matchbox, you know.",
        "A: Well, because one of the point of the SS, the Gestapo, and [indecipherable] other police,\neverywhere, the point is to make the prisoner believe, that no one knows where he or she 1s,\nnobody care, the -- you are 1n their hands, period. And there is a consistent effort to make the\nprisoner believe that you are in their hands, nobody knows where you are, nobody cares. And\none night, one of the guard shouting really bad words for a woman, you know, kicked the door\nopen, and send this panino, that Italian bread, which is empty inside, you know, if you go to\nMilan, you\u2019ll see it. And I pick it up, and it was dark, but I -- we left the door open, but -- so I\nsaw what it was, and -- and then I started eat, I was so hungry. I was also afraid that there may be\nsome poison inside. But there was a matchbox, a tiny cherino. They are called cherini, I\u2019ve never\nseen one so small in the country. They are cherini, and I lit it, and there was this little piece of\npaper, coracho. So I knew. No matter how many time they told me that nobody knows where I\nwas, and I was. But I think it was important because I -- psychologically you feel like giving up.\nThe other thing than they repeat to you day after day, that if you tell what happened to you to\nanybody, we will find you to the end of the earth, you will pay. And it seems to be a deliberate\nconditioning for the prisoner, because they did it on both places, in the tirano and the other. And\na, nobody knows you are here. You are in our hand, we can do what we want, and b, if you tell\nanybody, you -- we\u2019ll find you to the end of the earth, you know, tha -- so, and -- working with\nprisoner later on in Chile, and re -- same thing. Former prisoner, former victim of torture would\ntell me time after time the same thing. And if it was in Greece or Chile, or Brazil, or Italy at that\ntime, or Prague, or the soviet -- the same. So it -- it\u2019s -- there is an institution which is not\nnecessarily taught, but developed by each one, by -- in each country. And I think most important\nthing is to educate the public everywhere, then there was a meaning to the universal declaration\nof human rights, to make sure that see will never happen again to the Jewish people, to the anti-\nFascist, to the anti-Stalin, to everybody else. And so I am glad I survived all these years.",
        "A: Yeah. I\u2019ve had the friendship of so many wonderful -- I discovered after the war that I was\nworking with all the top people of the Committee of National Liberation, who, in their turn, were\nso helpful to our work for Amnesty International development. So that\u2019s really another story,\nthan it\u2019s incredible how, because of the friendship of that period, you learn something, but above\nall, they helped to develop organization to help other people.",
