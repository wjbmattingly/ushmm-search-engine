        "A: Yes, I -- I had a -- a large extended family in Latvia actually, because my\ngrandfather had 15 brothers and sisters, and of course, 1-in those times, half of them\ndied early. But --",
        "Q: This is your grandfather on your father\u2019s side?",
        "A: On my father -- oh, yeah, my grandfather on my father\u2019s side. But I-I have\nknown three of his sisters and one brother, I have known personally.",
        "Q: Tell me where you lived in Riga. Were you in the center of the town, or on the\noutskirts?\nFebruary 27, 2000",
        "A: My father came over from Barovka, they rented an apartment in Sardonikova\nStreet. Sardonikova Street was in the -- the so-called Moscow [indecipherable].\nAnd no -- how is it to say maybe less than a mile from the center of the city,\nbecause Riga was then a small town, only 300,000 people. And yeah, this was most\n-- a lot of Jews li -- used to live there and later it became a ghetto over there, so you\nshould know the area, about. It was --",
        "Q: How would you describe the neighborhood, was it a middle class neighborhood?",
        "A: I would mostly describe it as a working class neighborhood. Across the street\nthey had -- it was not a church. In Russian language it was called bougadena,\nwhere they used to house poor people, you know. And I would say working class\nlike shop owners or factory workers or small business people. Like my father was,\nyeah.",
        "Q: How did your parents meet each other?",
        "A: Well, my parents met each other -- you -- the villages where they used to live are\nvery close to each other, about six kilometers, I think, or maybe less from each\nother. So one village was called Skundaliena and the other was called Barovka.\nAnd they probably knew each other much earlier than -- before they got married.",
        "Q: And did your mother work?",
        "A: I -- I want to ask -- no, just ask me a person [tape break] Okay.\nFebruary 27, 2000",
        "Q: And so can you tell us a little bit about your mother\u2019s family and background.",
        "A: Okay. My mother was born actually in Daugavpils in a hospital, but 1t was si --\nsix kilometers from the village called Skundaliena as I mentioned. And my\ngrandmother, he -- her name was -- maiden name, Kuperschmidt, right? And my\ngrandfather\u2019s name is Hayman. So where they got married, they had a small farm,\nlet\u2019s say maybe 18 acres, s -- a -- a country store and a few cars, maybe seven cars\nand th-th-they possess some land. It -- 1t\u2019s unusual, I think for the Jews to possess\nland, right, in Latvia. So they considered themselves more or less well -- well off,\nright? And so my mother actually, since her childhood, she worked in the farm and\nworked in the store and worked in the office, keep the book -- bookkeeping with her\nsister and older brother. Her older brother went to Daugavpils and then became a --\na -- a businessman. And she and her older sister and their mother, they -- they ran\nthe st -- the business. And my -- on my father\u2019s side, my father was a blacksmith\nand so they were poorer, much poorer. And my -- you see, my mother was a foo --\nof the so called -- maybe they considered themself intelligentsia or something. So\nshe married late, because she was very choosy, I think. So -- but she realized that\nmy father was a good man and had a -- a head on his shoulders, so I guess it\u2019s how -\n- what happened.",
        "Q: How religious were your parents?\nFebruary 27, 2000",
        "A: This is a peculiar situation because my mother was never a religious woman, and\nmy father was very religious. I remember that on holidays my grandfather used to\nsend a -- a kishen. We\u2019re talking in Yiddish, but it\u2019s a pillow in English, with a --\nwith a chicken, you know, ga -- slaughtered chicken. I do -- even remember the\nblood in the kishen and the -- a-and the feathers, you know. And my -- my father\ntried to have a Jewish house, kosher, all of this, but my mother always resisted and\nsometimes my father was take -- would take a -- a knife my mother used to cut\nbutter and then use it for meat, and throw it out the window. And this what the\nsituation was. You know, so there was a -- you know, I would say, a contrarian\ninterest. Of how you call it?",
        "Q: A little disagreement, contention?",
        "A: Yeah, yes, yes. [indecipherable] that again?",
        "Q: What language did your parents speak to each other and to you?",
        "A: To each other they spoke Yiddish, but to me they always spoke Russian, and we\nlived in a -- in Latvia. Is -- but -- but in -- in those areas, they came from Latgalia\nwhere people mostly spoke Russian language more than Latvian, because it was\nclose to Polish border too. So they spoke Polish, my mother spoke German and my\nfather, of course, spoke Hebrew and Latvian and that. And my father served in\nLatvian army too, when he was a young man.\nFebruary 27, 2000",
        "Q: Did your parents feel that they were Latvian first, or Jewish first? What do you\nthink?",
        "A: No, it\u2019s hard for me to tell because I was very young, but I can imagine that\nwhen you live in a bu -- how it 1s, I -- of course they\u2019re Jews. F-Fir -- first and\nforemost they\u2019re Jewish people, but you\u2019re loyal to your country where you live.\nIt\u2019s -- it\u2019s why he served in the army, and dealt with the -- in business and\neverything, it\u2019s -- it -- and he stayed, even -- he\u2019s -- his brother actually left for\nPalestine in 1934 to become a chalut, but we stayed in -- now I want to turn off\nand I want to say something, but I don\u2019t know what to say. Turn off, please. [tape\nbreak] What -- where did we stop?",
        "Q: Well, you were talking about this organization.",
        "A: Yes, you see, in Latvia there was an organization called [indecipherable] and\nthis organization actually an-anybody could belong to -- to this organization, but --\nand my mother and my aunt, and probably my grandmother, I\u2019m not sure, belonged\nto this organization, [indecipherable] just was a pure Latvian organization. I would\ncall it guards, and because you were a property per-person, you should have\nbelonged to this, especially in rural areas, that\u2019s what I want to say.",
        "Q: An-And did they belong?\nFebruary 27, 2000",
        "A: Yeah, they did belong to this organization. Of course, during the Soviet times it\nwas forbidden and we\u2019d not -- you wouldn\u2019t mention that you belonged to this\norganization, but if a -- as a matter of survival you would like to belong to this\norganization, my mother did.",
        "Q: Did it require her to do anything?",
        "A: No, it didn\u2019t require, probably only paid dues, and you know, probably only that.",
        "Q: What are your very first memories?",
        "A: I would say my fir -- very first memories, th-the coming of Soviet army in 1940.\nMaybe before I have some memories, but in 1940 I -- I remember standing by\nschool number 56 [indecipherable] Soviet times it was number 56, and I saw\nSoviet tanks coming off Moscowyella, it\u2019s a street called Moscowyella in Latvia.\nAnd I remember the small tanks, yeah. And where they parked, they were parked --\nthere was a -- a street called Zilnaw iela where the great synagogue used to stand,\nthat they burned it. There was a cor -- small corner between Lacspiesa iela and\nZilnaw iela and all the -- right there there was a corner where the Soviet tanks\nstood. And this I remember vividly.",
        "Q: Did you -- of course, you were born in 1936, so you were so very young, but\nbefore that time of the Soviet tanks, do you have any recollection of your parents\nFebruary 27, 2000\ntalking about difficult times, hard times, a man named Hitler? Anything that brings\nback that memory?",
        "A: I can tell you something about [indecipherable] I\u2019Il tell you, my father was a\nsmall businessman and about maybe seven, 10 people used to work for him in the\nshop, tailor shop, and he made the suits for -- for a company. So after the Soviets\ncame, of course he had to relinquish his business and what is interesting, that the\nSoviet government, they hired him to work for them in the army, to make uniforms,\nI think, and th -- and he was making good money, they paid very well.",
        "Q: He was working as a civilian in the army\u201d?",
        "A: Yes, as a civilian, he was working in the Soviet army as a civilian, yes. And the -\n- the former, his employees -- you know, in -- in capitalist countries the employee\nnot -- not always is satisfied with his salary or something. So they would -- before\nthe Soviets came in, they knew they would come in, they said oh, when they come\nin, you -- you will not feel so good. After they came in, my father was hired by the\nSoviets and the workers made so little that they would meet my father and say, I --\nhow good it was when we worked for you, in comparison what we make now when\nwe work for the Soviets.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s get back to your memory of when you were four years old, and you saw\nthese -- the tanks coming in.\nFebruary 27, 2000",
        "A: Yes. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Yeah, what -- can you describe -- what -- what your thoughts were?",
        "A: I-I -- I couldn\u2019t have any thoughts for desse -- was too young to, I was not even -\n- 1940 I was under four years old, still. But I remember it very well, and --",
        "Q: Do you remember being frightened?",
        "A: No, I was never frightened, I couldn\u2019t understand that actually, frightened or not,\nth-this is a -- not the -- the sense that I had.",
        "Q: What kind of school were you going to at four years old?",
        "A: At four years old I didn\u2019t go to no school.",
        "Q: Oh, you were just standing on the corner.",
        "A: Oh yeah, I standing with my mother. I was standing on the corner and watching\nthis passing by, that\u2019s it. It\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a natural thing because you know, something\nnew.",
        "Q: Did she say anything to you, that you remember?",
        "A: No, I can\u2019t remember that she -- she -- she told me, no.",
        "Q: And then when is your next memory?",
        "A: My next memory is when the war started. In 1941, it was June. And I think -- I\nremember my father carrying me -- before that I would say when we left our\nFebruary 27, 2000\napartment, we -- we possess some goods, especially with -- my father had some\nstuffs. I remember sacks of goods sitting on the floor, we lefted everything.",
        "Q: Now wha -- wha -- you\u2019re talking about leaving your apartment, why were you\nle -- why were you leaving?",
        "A: Why we were leaving? We had to run. We had to run for our lives and I think\nmy father took me on his arms. He only put on -- he had the leather, I remember, a\nblack leather overcoat and my mother took a few things. She -- my father had the\ngolden watch, and this overcoat and then he carried me to -- to the railroad. Not to\nthe station, on the Lacspiesa iela there was an overpass. And that\u2019s to the train. And\nI think this was the last train. And I remember -- Ill tell you the truth, I remember\nshooting, and I think shooting and shooting and shooting a lot. And I wouldn\u2019t say I\ncan say for sure that they were bombing us at this particular time, but I am sure that\nthe train was the last one to leave Riga. I can\u2019t say the date, but this was the last\ntrain. And I was -- sat in the train, it was a mixed train of civilians and military. And\nwe took off so slowly, 1t was so slow -- there was a place called Mezure Park, it\u2019s -\n- Mezure Park it\u2019s -- it\u2019s like a forest park. It\u2019s pine trees, you know? And it took\nus so many hours to get to Mezure Park, it was maybe five kilometers from us.\nAnd you know what happened? Turned out the military suspected that the m-\nmachinist there, locomotive machinist, that\u2019s called? He was probably a traitor is\nFebruary 27, 2000\nwhat we understood. So, I-I -- I saw it. They pulled him out of the locomotive, put\nhim against the train and shot him dead. And since -- after that, the train began\nmoving, and quickly -- pretty fast. And then suddenly, German airplanes came over\nus and began bombing. They began bombing, we left the train, began running into\nthe forest. And I personally, I remember I fell into a pit, a very deep pit with water.\nI lost my parents, I didn't know where they are. And I woke up -- I-I woke up on the\n-- on the table, operating table, right in the forest. And the doctors, they patch me\nup. I -- I was wounded in my right leg. Even now I have a big scar. And yes, it\u2019s\nhow it happened. We boarded our train back and it turned out that the last three\ncars, railroad cars, they were blown apart, and my mama to -- mama told me that\nabout 40 people died in the train. So, I think 1t was the last train, and from then we\nmoved pretty good to-towards Estonia and we moved pretty fast I would say til we\nreached [indecipherable], then we came to Yeloslavil. Yeloslav Skyoblis, it\u2019s a\nregion, Yeloslav Sky -- yeah.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s move back a little bit. In between 1940 and 1941, betwine -- b-between the\ntime that the tanks came in and the time you had to leave in that year, do you have\nany memories of that time, of --",
        "A: Between 19 --",
        "Q: In Riga.\nFebruary 27, 2000",
        "A: -- 1940 and 19 --",
        "Q: 1941. Do you have any memories of that time of things that were happening in\nthe town? Did you parents say anything?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t know. I-I -- I don\u2019t have memories, it\u2019s --",
        "Q: I know you were very young. I know you were very young.",
        "A: I have memories like, I would say, when I went to my grandfather, yes and you\nknow how in a small, tiny village, there were probably fleas, and my mother didn\u2019t\nwant to keep him overnight over there. And then we went back to her village and I\nwas running and suddenly a dog bit me on my left foot. And then I remember there\nwas a circus passing by and the small pony was ki -- pulling a -- a wagon, and\nbehind the wagon an elephant was tied up. This I -- I remember this, yeah. This\nkind of things.",
        "Q: Yeah. So during that year, between \u201940 and *41, between -- it had to go --",
        "A: [indecipherable]",
        "Q: -- 1-1t -- yeah, a-and you don\u2019t have any --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- other memories that were upsetting or frightening?",
        "A: No, no, no, we lived pretty good. We -- we had the -- my mother w -- and my\nfather, they lived really good life, I would say. My mother liked theater. Sh-She\nFebruary 27, 2000\nliked reading and going out. And I would say movies. She could tell you every\nname of a personage in the movie. She liked arts.",
        "Q: So until the Germans came 1n, life wa --",
        "A: Pretty good.",
        "Q: Pretty good.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. How would you describe yourself. Again, you were very young. Were you\nvery close to your parents, were you very dependent on them?",
        "A: Wh-When you -- when you so small it\u2019s -- especially in Jewish families, you\nknow how it is when kids are very close to their parents and so it was -- what I can\nsay, they very close.",
        "Q: When it was time for you to leave -- you were saying how your father, you\npacked up things and you were -- you have memories of st -- of bags on the floor.\nWhat did your parents say to you? Why -- what did they tell a young child why you\nwere leaving?",
        "A: No, I-I -- I don\u2019t remember this, I-I -- I can\u2019t say nothing because I -- I don\u2019t\nremember wh -- if they said anything to me or not. The only thing I know my\nmother told me, that my father didn\u2019t want to leave. She said he told her, maybe we\nwill overcome this situation, you know. But my mother loved me so much, and she\nFebruary 27, 2000\nnever believed that -- that we\u2019re going to be safe with the Germans. And so she\ninsisted of leaving, yeah, this wa -- I -- I know for sure.",
        "Q: So it was her --",
        "A: Yeah, her. My father was a m -- my father maybe a -- he was a smart person, I\nknow that, but in this case, maybe he was a little naive about -- like many -- so\nmany people.",
        "Q: Did other members of your extended family leave with you?",
        "A: You see, as I told before, my mother\u2019s sister and -- and her brother, they lived in\nSkundaliena in next big town called Daugavpils, and my -- my ... I'll call it -- my\nmother\u2019s uncle had seven kids -- seven children. Their name was Kuperschmidt\nand then the -- they remained in Riga with all -- with all seven kids and ob-\nobviously they were killed. And my grandfather remained in his town Barovka and\nhe was shot. My mother\u2019s sister, her name was Dwara. In Russian they used to call\nher Vera. She was kept alive with her son, as my mother told me, for awhile,\nbecause she was a translator for the Germans, translated from German into Latvian\nand Russian, I know this. And my ol -- uncle, with his wife -- yeah, ma -- my -- my\naunt, she was married in 1935 or \u201936 and her to a person named Opanansky, who\nwas Sa -- later in Soviet army, and he was killed in action. And she -- she had the\nsmall child, two years old, so was -- she was killed in -- with the small child, two\nFebruary 27, 2000\nyear old male. And my u-uncle, he was shot in the -- in the fortress of Daugavpils\nwith his wife and the three year old too -- male child. And then I had the -- my\ngrandmother\u2019s sister, on my mother\u2019s side, sh-she -- she didn\u2019t have her own kids,\nbut she -- she married to a person who had his own four. But two of them escaped.\nOne of them actually, a woman, I don\u2019t remember her name, she was a communist.\nAnd in 1937 the -- she was caught by Latvian police and probably worked over\ngood in the prison. And then they probably released her and she went to Russia.\nBut you know what happened in Russia in 1937. So they -- they grabbed her and\nsent her to Magadan. She got married in Magadan, f-far eastern Pacific Ocean,\nshe got married. And I saw her in 1957, she had a son. And sh-she spent 20 years in\nMagadan, from \u201937 to *57, it was precisely when I came from the army and I saw\nher. It was strange that she never blamed the communists for her misfortunes, which\nwas very strange. And my grandmother\u2019s si-sister, as I mentioned, they were\nbusiness people, dealt in lumber and had properties and houses in Daugavpils, so\neverything gone. I even remember my f -- my uncle\u2019s building had three stories in --\non Riga Street in Daugavpils. It stands now.",
        "Q: Speaking of the communist party, when -- before you left Riga, and did that\nword mean anything to you as a very young child, the communist party?\nFebruary 27, 2000",
        "A: No, if you ask me about the communist party, 1t never meant to me nothing\nbecause I -- a -- a -- nothing at all. The only th -- I began understanding wa -- the co\n-- what 1s it probably when I was nine, and I began s-seeing the pictures of Mr.\nStalin, because before that I -- I -- I haven\u2019t seen these, I never read nothing. There\nwas no time for reading.",
        "Q: Before you left Riga, had you heard of a man named Hitler?",
        "A: No. I never heard th -- I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: So it was just the three of you who left, your mother, your father and you, and\ngetting on the train.",
        "A: As -- as far as I can -- as far as I can remember o -- for my family only. No, I\nwould be wrong. I forgot my -- my father\u2019s sister. She -- she was with us, too. Four\npeople.",
        "Q: And you were together in one car?",
        "A: Yeah, we were together in one car, we went to this [indecipherable] an -- a\nvillage called Pol\u2019kino. What is interesting, then we met over there a family, they\nwere our neighbors. They lived next building from the yard across this. Their last\nname was Pantz. We met them in this town -- not town, it\u2019s a village, Pol\u2019kino.\nBecause I was wounded my mother had to carry me once a week or whatever to a\ndoctor about eight kilometers away for bandages. It\u2019s an interesting story there. My\nFebruary 27, 2000\nfather and some of his friends, they -- they tried to catch some fish in the river. And\nyou know what? After all their efforts, they caught only one fish. One fish, I\nremember this, one fish. And why I remember that very good, because now my --\nmy daughters-in-law father, he came from Byelorussia -- but actually, it\u2019s not like\nthat. My son went to -- with his wife to Byelorussia with all his fishing equipment\nand I telled -- I tell him, you know what my son, you will not catch one fish over\nthere, they ate it, everything. So --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",

        "A: Mm-hm. The -- th -- good enough, my son returned from Byelorussia and he\ntold me, I did catch one fish.",
        "Q: Just to get back to that beginning train ride, did your -- did you have enough\nfood, what was the conditions like in the car?",
        "A: We lived in the village Pol\u2019kino for a short time, maybe f --",
        "Q: No, no, no, I was talking about that train. Do you remember when you got on the\ntrain out of Riga?\nFebruary 27, 2000",
        "A: Ah, out of Riga.",
        "Q: Did your mother -- did you have enough food?",
        "A: Yeah, but this was -- oh, okay, on the train from Riga after we got bumped, we\nleft these three railroad cars behind and I-I don\u2019t remember precisely, but it took us\nvery short time to reach Yaroslavl.",
        "Q: What -- were ther -- was this a train car with seats?",
        "A: No, this was -- as I mentioned before, this was a train, a mixed train with\ncivilians and military. So --",
        "Q: But did you have seats to sit on, did you have benches?",
        "A: Wa -- yes. It was -- those cars were called, I remember, Pullman. You probably\nhave them in United States, it\u2019s what kind of here. It\u2019s regular passenger c-cars.",
        "Q: And how did you sleep?",
        "A: We slept on benches. They have just benches, that\u2019s it, nothing we -- no pillows,\nor mattresses or something like that, no.",
        "Q: Did you take -- you were very, very young, did you take anything special with\nyou, a special toy, something you wanted to play with?",
        "A: No, I-I think we didn\u2019t have any time for taking more valuable things than toys. I\ndon\u2019t think we took anything with us besides just a few things, as a -- as I\nmentioned before.\nFebruary 27, 2000",
        "Q: B-Before you left, did -- did the word ghetto ever -- was that ever mentioned?\nDid it ever mean anything to you?",
        "A: No, I wouldn\u2019t say that the word ghetto ever meant to me anything, I -- I don\u2019t\nremember.",
        "Q: So you left before the ghetto was established in Riga?",
        "A: Obviously I left before the ghetto was established because as far I know from --\nnow I know from literature that the Germans entered Riga about July first,\nprobably. And then we left with the last train, what can it be, 28\" of June? So there\nwas no time to waste and we had to run for our lives. That\u2019s how it was.",
        "Q: So yo-you -- you\u2019re saying you left the end of June?",
        "A: Yeah, twen -- yeah, I left 27\" to 28\". This was the last train, I -- I thought I -- as\nfar as I have in my mind.",
        "Q: Why do you think your mother knew enough to leave? Well, how do you think\nshe knew? I know this is looking back, obviously, as an adult.",
        "A: Yes, well I -- I -- later -- I-I can think that my mother 1s a -- was a woman -- she\ndied already -- she was a woman of perception. I think she was a very bright\nwoman. And besides, my mother mentioned to me that of course she s -- learned\neverything, she read newspapers and listened to the radio. We -- we knew what\u2019s\ngoing on in -- in Germany and Poland, it\u2019s obvious. And besides, w-we had the\nFebruary 27, 2000\nrelative, I think, my mother mentioned him. Very removed, but he was a\n[indecipherable] I think, in Lithuania, I think, a [indecipherable] you know, the\nchief -- yeah. And he predicted that -- of course, I don\u2019t know how they predict, but\nthey know what they talking about. So we knew very well.",
        "Q: Did your -- now you\u2019re in Yaroslavl, what -- h-how -- did your wound heal all\nright?",
        "A: Yes. Yes, in this Pol\u2019kino, it took me ow -- actually, I'll tell you, maybe. You\nknow, with this primitive medicine, they patched up my wound so badly that even\nnow it\u2019s -- you know. So it took me about eight months for me to heal it.",
        "Q: How did your mother find you when you were thrown out of the train?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember -- I don\u2019t rememb -- I was on the ma -- on the table operated. I\nwoke up, I see the doctors, my mother saw them -- me too. So wa -- wa-wa -- we\nwere all running and the bombs were falling all over the place. And I saw the\nairplanes, they were very low. Actually, 1t was covers -- fa -- co -- forested area and\nonly you could see th -- I would say from above, you could see the railroad tracks.\nSo -- so they can say.",
        "Q: Were there other children from other families on that train?\nFebruary 27, 2000",
        "A: Yes. I think I had a distant cousin who was me -- his name was Yosef Zaks. This\n-- it -- maybe I forgot a little bit, but my father\u2019s first cousin, Riva Zaks, she was\nwith her ch -- with her child, Joseph Zaks. Yeah, Yosef Zaks, in -- in Yiddish.",
        "Q: Do you remember talking to him on the train at all?",
        "A: No. No, on the train, I -- no, I don\u2019t remember. I only m -- I -- met him only in\n1945. She -- she was -- I would say -- this is personal, but I would say my mother\nloved me more than she loved her son, because my mother never gave me away to\nthis -- how you say, we call it in Russian language the dom. It\u2019s called, like for\norphans. Orphanage. And -- and my father\u2019s first cousin, she gave him away into\norphanage. So my mother always mentioned that. Yeah.",
        "Q: How long did you stay in Yaroslavl?",
        "A: We stayed o-only for, I think a month. I want to say something about -- this is\nnot Yaroslavl, this is Pol\u2019kino, the village. One day I was walking alone, and I saw\na peasant woman. And there wa -- high in the sky was an airplane, I guess it was a\nGerman airplane. And this woman took off a kerchief off your head and began\nwaving to the German airplane. Yo -- I -- I think it was a sp -- how you say, a spy\nplane, yeah, and she -- I remember it. She -- she waved to the German airplane.",
        "Q: Did you tell your parents?\nFebruary 27, 2000",
        "A: No, no, I -- I didn\u2019t tell this, but I -- I kept it inside there. You ga -- I didn\u2019t know\nwhat I -- what it is, but looking back I know what it 1s.",
        "Q: Did you have enough food at that time?",
        "A: In Pol\u2019kino, yes, we -- we had what to eat -- we had what to eat, but if you want\nto know how it went further, our journey from Pol\u2019kino to cur -- to central Asia,\nDalino, it\u2019s called Vallo Furginah, we\u2019 re --",
        "Q: Well, before we get there, I just want to talk about --",
        "A: [indecipherable] Pol\u2019kino [indecipherable]",
        "Q: -- you -- you had enough food. Where did you live?",
        "A: We had a -- I remember th-there was a two story -- a two story house, I think.\nYeah, even I remember the color, it was gray. Yeah, you know, there wasn\u2019t hung --\na hunger right away of the first days of war. It started later.",
        "Q: What does a five year old know about war at that time? What -- what -- do you\nremember questioning your parents? You were five years old, you had to leave your\nhome, you\u2019re in this new s -- town --",
        "A: [indecipherable] I was not five yet, September would be five. But I don\u2019t think,\nwhen we talking about a five year old having any judgment to judge what the war\nis, or peace, it\u2019s only the minute he feels it, in my opinion, he feels it, what a war 1s,\nyou know, or what hunger is. But I don\u2019t think it -- after awhile, if you, under\nFebruary 27, 2000\npeaceful conditions you have bad impressions, maybe if you personally affected,\nyou know, physically, then you probably will remember, but otherwise I -- I don\u2019t\nthink so. It\u2019s philosophical point, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Did you stay very close to your parents in Pol\u2019kino? Did --",
        "A: Yes, of course, 1t was my parents. We slept in one bed, obviously, you know.\nSince 1941 til 1944, I slept in one bed with my mother. That\u2019s it.",
        "Q: And then you stayed there and then when did yo -- how -- for how long?",
        "A: We stayed in Pol\u2019kino for about a month, I think. And this was already I would\nsay end of July, or beginning of au -- August, and then we took off from there\nbecause th-the Germans were moving and actually it\u2019s much to the north of\nMoscow, but they were moving qui-quick, I don\u2019t -- I w -- I have to look up in a --\nif the Germans reached Yaroslavl, I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: And then you got back on another train?",
        "A: Yes. We got back on a train, but this was not a -- already not a Pullman, this\nwas a cattle train. And we were sleeping on shelves, there were no pillows or\nmattresses or something like that and it took us about a month. Actually, we were\nchanging trains. In the beginning my -- my mother told me we had the train loaded\nup with coal and we were sitting on the top of this sc -- railroad car with -- full with\ncoal for awhile, until we got another one that was empty, a cattle train and we --\nFebruary 27, 2000\nfrom there we went all the way down to -- to central Asia, as I said. That town was\ncalled Utchkulgan. A damned place, I would say. Damned.",
        "Q: What was it like?",
        "A: Okay. My father was still not in the army. They -- he probably got sick or\nsomething, they didn\u2019t ask him til 1943. I remember 1943 they\u2019d -- they -- they\nwere all in -- lined up and when the [indecipherable] came, and they lined up and\nsent him off.",
        "Q: Bu-But now you're still -- the three of you are still together.",
        "A: Yes, and my father\u2019s sister.",
        "Q: Oh, the four of you.",
        "A: And my father and me and my mother, and we lived in a barrack. No, at the\nbeginning I would say not, it\u2019s -- was not a barrack. I remember January 1942, we\nlived in a big wooden house. And -- and the hunger began to set in. You know why\nI remember this very well? Because there was an 80 year old person, and he\nprobably had money. And he had the girlfriend who was about 30 years old, so --\nand we lived together in one room, about maybe, I would say 30 people. I\nremember another thing. He had money, so he bought some carrots. They dug a -- a\n-- a pit and buried the carrots into the pit and covered it so -- some food, right? So\nthis -- what I want to say, this old man lived with this younger woman -- well she\nFebruary 27, 2000\nlived with him for -- of course for food. And suddenly this house burned down. It --\nI remember snow in central Asia, snow. January there, snow. And then -- it was \u201942,\nyeah, we moved to a barrack. My mother worked at the factory that used to make\nropes, and she would leave me alone, obviously, in the barrack. Yeah, I was bitten\nby a scorpion at night once, in my left leg, and my father once reached into his\npockets at night and got bitten in the -- in his hand. I would say with food the\nsituation was so bad, if I tell you that I didn\u2019t see any milk for four years, you\nwouldn\u2019t believe me. And bread, they used to make it from a little cornmeal, how\nyou say, the dark, dark bread, mixed with -- we call in Russian language mich. It\u2019s\na -- parts of sunflower seeds, but they\u2019re not sunflower seeds, it\u2019s the -- the waste of\nsunsower -- flower seeds, because you could see the --",
        "Q: The hull.",
        "A: The hull -- hulk. No, hull --",
        "Q: Hull.",
        "A: Hull?",
        "Q: Hull.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: The outer part of the seed.\nFebruary 27, 2000",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, the -- the hull mixed together, it was kind of bread that he was\nyellow inside. In 1941 I\u2019Il tell you -- we were going to sit here for a long time --",
        "Q: Good.",
        "A: In 1941 I caught malaria. Yes. An-And lucky for me -- and then I had a little bit\npneumonia too, maybe in light form. I thought I\u2019m going to die, I said my mama,\nI\u2019m dead. I remember she began crying and all this, but survived.",
        "Q: Wh-Where were you living then?",
        "A: Then, in Utchkulgan. No, th -- no, this was not Utchkulgan, this was Andejan.\nThis was Andejan. And luckily for me, my grandmother\u2019s brother lived there with\nhis daughter-in-law in there -- and -- hi-his daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law\u2019s\ndaughter. This I have to tell you, his name was Moskevich. Velville Moskevich,\nVelville. In Russian language they call him Vladimir, but he was Velville. Actually\nwe would say wolf in Yiddish. His son was a famous flyer, everybody knows him,\nYakov Moskevich, a general and commander in chief of Soviet Air Force. Two\ntimes hero Soviet Union. As we know, he was arrested in 1941 and with other\ngenerals, and shot. So -- but in Uzbekistan where I lived in, they probably didn't\nknow about the situation with him yet, so they supplied food to -- to his father. So\nit\u2019s how we survived, because they didn\u2019t know of the situation. But later on they\narrested his daughter-in-law and sent her to -- to far away places, this I know. So I\nFebruary 27, 2000\nsurvived 1941. So I mentioned you about the burning down of the house. So, after\nthat we moved to a barrack. I would say maybe seven families lived there, in the\nbarrack. My mother worked at the f -- rope factory, suppli -- they supplied us with\nbread, as I mentioned.",
        "Q: We\u2019re -- we\u2019re in Utchkulgan now?",
        "A: Utchkul -- yes, Utchkulgan. Tiny piece of bread, of this mixture. Tiny piece. It\nwas absolutely piece -- if you -- if you press it in your hand, I-I think water would\ncome out. There was a kindergarten, yeah, I attended kindergarten as I remember,\nbut the food was, you know, a little pea soup. Whole day, that\u2019s it. Believe me. So\nmy -- my mother had to survive somehow. She began dealing -- how you say selling\nand buying fruits, vegetables, you know and selling and buying and sometimes she\nwould go into the desert and collect tortoises, yes. She had a big, how you say, not a\nhammer, but an axe. And she would discard the par -- carapaces and only take meat\nout and the eggs, and bring it in a sack. One time she was really caught in -- ina\nstorm. It was a terrible storm, I remember and -- but she brought the sack with --\nwith the turtles, anyway. She got sick, but -- but my father\u2019s sister, she probably\ndidn\u2019t have a strong constitution my mother had. So sh-she began actually starving\nto death. One day she had diarrhea, they took her to a hospital. And they took her\nhospital -- after she became a little better they fed her sauerkraut soup. And you\nFebruary 27, 2000\nknow what it is, sauerkraut soup? You eat it, in a few hours you\u2019re dead. That\u2019s\nwhat happened to her. I remember it was raining, ter-terrible rain and my father was\ncoming from the hospital and he was crying. Yeah, it\u2019s what happened.",
        "Q: Were -- were -- was your family able to bury her?",
        "A: I-I don\u2019t remember actually, I will tell you. I don\u2019t remember how they did it\nbecause they didn\u2019t take me with -- with them. So --",
        "Q: What was your father doing? Was he working?",
        "A: Yeah, my father was working. In the beginning, I don\u2019t know what he did. In the\nbeginning we -- we\u2019re together with the Bukara Jews, you know, Bukara Jews,\nthey used to have collective farms over there, they used to go to synagogue over\nthere in b -- with the Bukara Jews, but later I don\u2019t -- I can\u2019t say that I remember.\nGo -- in 1943 he was drafted to -- into the army and he never came back. And\n[indecipherable] when I lived in barrack, the situation was so bad about -- I think it\nwas about like Ethiopia in modern times. I -- I was then seven years old, a-and a\nyoung guy maybe 10 years old lying on the floor on a mattress, and you -- he was\nsquirming like, because he was dying. And I was with him together in this room. I\nremember getting so scared I crawled along the wall and bolted the door and ran\nand ran til I -- I don\u2019t know for how long I ran. I stopped and I -- in a few hours I\ncame back and I remember some me-medical personnel, of course not in a car,\nFebruary 27, 2000\nmedic -- some medical personnel gave him an injection, I think and he died over\nthere. He was swollen like three times his regular size, I -- I\u2019d -- I think so, yeah.",
        "Q: So while you were there, you said you went to kindergarten?",
        "A: Why did I -- why --",
        "Q: When you were there, you went to kindergarten?",
        "A: Yes, I don\u2019t remember what year I went to kindergarten, but probably it was \u201942.\nFor awhile -- I didn\u2019t even go for a long time there, because you know, there was no\n-- there was no food over there, no --",
        "Q: Were you parents very comforting to you?",

        "A: I-I don\u2019t remember actually, Pll tell you. F -- my -- of course my mother, what\ncan she do? She comfort you and the -- if there\u2019s no food you -- what can you do?\nYou want a piece of bread, but how to get it? So when we had these turtles 1t was\nalready a holiday, right? But this was already when my father was in the army. I\nremember it when she began going into the desert to get these turtles.",
        "Q: How long -- how long did you stay in Utchkulgan?\nFebruary 27, 2000",
        "A: In Utchkulgan we stayed til 1944, when my mother got news from Ural\nmountains -- beyond Ural mountains, it was the cor -- valley -- it\u2019s not a valley,\nactually. Beyond the Ural mountains there was a town called Tavda. So in 1944 --\nyou know, I had nothing to wear, because we lived in as -- | -- I -- actually, I was\nsick for three years with malaria, right? I got some quinine, right? I remember\nsitting on the -- in 120 degrees Fahrenheit sitting on -- on the -- on the stone and\nshaking. You know what malaria is? After three years of malaria? So, my mother\ngot the news that my father\u2019s first cousin, he was a -- a soldier in Tavda, there was\na -- a prison for -- maybe for all kind of people, political and the criminal elements.\nAnd they called her to come over there. So I had nothing to wear so my mother\nknitted something for my feet, and it was December already. You know, I had to\nwear this. We stopped over in [indecipherable] town, right? Now it\u2019s probably\ncalled Orenburg, if I can remember. I look out the window -- you know, we took a\ntrain, right? We come to Orenburg. We stayed only there, my mother had to look --\nsomebody told her maybe my father is alive, because she got the news that he was\nreleased from the army because of sickness, but she couldn\u2019t find him. We stayed\nover -- the wind was sweeping -- this is an open plain, no forest over there and the\nwind was sweeping so horribly that my mother couldn't take it any more, so we --\nwe boarded a train to Swedlofska and from there to Tavda. I'll tell you, we had the\nFebruary 27, 2000\nvery [indecipherable] small luggage. There was no -- no luggage, actually, and she\nplaced it on the -- on the floor and somebody wanted to steal. So my mother was\npretty alert, she gave him a -- a kick in the behind so he fell in -- on the railroad\ntracks, I remember that. When we boarded the train -- of course there are no toilets.\nThere are toilets, but you know what, no heat. So the human excrements and all this\nurine, was frozen and piled up I would say maybe three feet high. Yeah, and that\u2019s\nhow we traveled to Tavda. This was not Tavda, it was called a town, Saragolka.\nYou see, I remember all the names. Yeah, it was Saragolka.",
        "Q: Wh-What was it like when your father was called up into the army? Do you\nremember that?",
        "A: No. I -- I -- I wouldn\u2019t say that I remember. I only, when I -- as I mentioned, I\nsaw him lining up on the -- on the sk -- square of this town, and [indecipherable]",
        "Q: D-D you remember missing him and asking where he was?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember missing or asking where he was. I-I -- I don\u2019t -- I can\u2019t say\nthat. I -- I-I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: So when he left it was just the two of you, you and your mother?",
        "A: Yes. After he left, my aunt died, just me and my mom, and that\u2019s it. Two of us.",
        "Q: Did you mix with other children at that time, when you were in Utchkulgan?\nFebruary 27, 2000",
        "A: No, I wouldn\u2019t say that I mixed with any other children, I was by myself. By\nmyself all day. You know -- you know the two --",
        "Q: What -- what did you think about? What did you do to occupy your mind?",
        "A: What did I do to occupy my mind? I was looking for food, and you know what?\nI remember this case -- you see, I am shaven now, right? I am 63 years old now and\nI am shaven. It\u2019s how I was shaven when I was seven or eight years old. So what\ndid I do? You know p-peaches -- actually not, apricots. And the Usbecks, of course\nthey had their orchard in somewhere else -- there was a market, surrounded by a\nhigh wall, as they do it in Asia, was a clay wall. So one time I stole a -- you know, I\nstole a melon from one Usbeck, and he ran after me with a n -- with a knife. But he\n-- of course he couldn\u2019t catch me. And the -- in the corner I remember there was a\nbank, and the bank had a nest of wasps. Yeah, the wasps, of course, the melons are\nnot like in this country, they are a little bit be -- sweeter and better. The wasps has\nvery sm -- good smell, right? So they attacked me and bit me se -- I di -- I\nremember seven times in my head. So my head had big bumps. Then I -- in order to\nsurvive I collect -- I of -- of course I dropped this melon, what could I do? And in\norder to survive I would pick up the seeds from apricots. But a -- I remember being\nashamed doing this, so I wouldn\u2019t do it bending, with my hands, but I would pick\nthem up with my feet. With my toes. With my toes, yeah. And collected them ca --\nFebruary 27, 2000\nthen coming home and taking a -- a stone and breaking, and they were nutritious. So\n-- so | ate like the s -- the seeds.",
        "Q: Why did you not have any hair on your head?",
        "A: You see, during the war we had the la -- lice. In order to get rid of them we had\nto shave our heads.",
        "Q: Wh-Who did that for you?",
        "A: I -- I actually don\u2019t remember who -- who shaved my head, you know.",
        "Q: Was that hard for you, as a small child?",
        "A: No, I had no feeling there about having hair or not having hair, probably the\nsame I don\u2019t have now. I don\u2019t remember having any feelings about styles.",
        "Q: Did that hold true for your mother too, did she have to have her hair taken off?",
        "A: Oh no, my mother never shaved her head, no. She didn\u2019t do it.",

        "A: Yes, we came to Saragulka, was December 1944, and my father\u2019s first cousin,\nhis name was Ulman, Schmul Ulman -- Schmel Ulman, Schmel, Schmel, yeah.\nAnd my grandfather\u2019s sister, my -- my f-father\u2019s side, she was there too with her\ndaughter. And it turned out that Siberia was much better than central Asia in -- as\nFebruary 27, 2000\nfood is concerned, because my mother began working, not chopping wood, but\nsawing wood, you know, big logs of -- she worked all day.",
        "Q: How had your mother\u2019s health been up to that point?",
        "A: You know, it\u2019s very interesting, my mother\u2019s health was very good. She was a\nvery strong woman despite later starting to complain about high blood pressure or\nsomething, but I remember she had her -- her -- when she was younger, she had her,\nyou know, w-women\u2019s characteristics a little, about -- complaining or something,\nbut actually her health was pretty good, considering the horrible times.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nFebruary 27, 2000\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",

I\njust wanted to ask you, when you were in Uzbekistan, were -- did your mother\nknow what was happening in Europe, and if so, did she talk to you about it? Did\nyou as a child, have any idea of what was happening with the war, and the Jews\nalso?",
        "A: I-I -- I would say I-I can\u2019t recollect if she was talking with me about the war, and\nthese other things. The -- mostly we were talking about food, I think. To me was, at\nleast the -- but what was happening, of course she knew what was going on, but she\nnever talked with me about the situation, I would say. And I never attended school\nyet, I was in a -- I don\u2019t think I had any strength to attend any school. I was young\ntil then from -- I began going to school, I was only eight years old.",

        "A: You see, the -- I -- I didn\u2019t know what Jew and not Jew 1s. Later on I real -- I\nunderstood what a Jew is or not a Jew, but at a young age I probably didn\u2019t\nFebruary 27, 2000\nunderstand what it is, what -- to be Jewish or not Jewish.

        "A: No, what to say? It was hard in the beginning, you know. A stepfather is an\ninvalid, he gets unpatient. You know how much patient you can get in certain\ninstances. And he worked. He worked, not always, and my mother didn't have an\nofficial job, but she tried to -- later on she began -- began working in trades. I mean,\na saleswoman. She wa -- became a saleswoman, yeah. And th-then 1946 my\nstepsister was born and we sa -- lived in very small apartment. No, I would say, we\nbegan eating better than before and slowly, slowly, life improved. I remember when\nI was a kid attending this school, first time I saw, during the -- the -- how you call it,\nelections? This was a Soviet style election. In school they would organize -- I don\u2019t\nknow, it was specially for new republics, like Baltic Republic, where it was als --\nalso [indecipherable] I\u2019m not sure, but over there I -- they would bring artist and\nsingers and all kinds of stuff and all day they would play music and -- and praise\nStalin and all the party and we used to watch it, enjoy it actually, I would say. You\nknow, everything is good for a peasant.",
        "Q: Were you part of any Russian youth group?",
        "A: No, I would say I was never even not a peer -- Pioneer. They used to force you\nto become a Pioneer and wear this -- how you call that, tie. This is like a tie and in\npublic maybe I would put it on, but then I would take it off and put it in my pocket,\nbecause I never wanted to be a part of it. I don\u2019t know, it was mainly in -- inside me\nFebruary 27, 2000\nthat I didn't want to be a member of any organization, even from childhood. Not a\nPioneer, later on a [indecipherable], later on a party member. I know many Jews\nwere party members, I -- I have friends that live in the United States, a lot of who\nwere party members, but I, never. I felt I don\u2019t belong there.",

        "Q: What would happen?",
        "A: If you were -- what would happen? Will go to faraway places, is what would\nhappen. So, you know, I-I [indecipherable] but in a quarrel, let\u2019s say my mother\nwould quarrel with him. And she would give a hint that he was a Zionist, he was\nscared, you know. Obviously my mother was joking, but you see, Zionist is a good\ncause. It\u2019s why we have our country there, and he was a Zionist and didn't want\nanybody -- he belonged to a sports club and he was, himself from Rezekne, and his\n-- two of his sisters, they went to Palestine in 1933, but his mother and two br -- an\nolder brother, they all were killed in Rezekne. So -- and he always dreamed about\ncoming to Israel, so they managed to come to Israel in 1966.\nFebruary 27, 2000",

        "Q: Did you do anything religiously in the late 40\u2019s - 50\u2019s?",
        "A: No, I never did, despite that my father was a Chabadnik. My father, personally\nwas a Chabadnik before war. You know Chabadnik, in Israel they have this. But\nI personally, no, I was not religious. I -- what to say about religion? I believe that I\nam a Jew by blood. I don\u2019t have to be very religious to confirm it.\nFebruary 27, 2000",
        "Q: So then you went on to high school. Any experiences there?",
        "A: Yes, I went to high school -- a-actually, you see, he was not my father, right? So\nhe always insisted that I go to work. I was 13. Go to work, go to work, but I want --\nI wanted to study. I wanted to study and I went -- actually I went to school\nevenings, high school. I went to work, I was a lathe -- lathe operator, worked a little\nhere, a little there, you know, what do you want, you were 13 or 14 or 15 years old,\nyou know. And that was tough actually, in many ways, obviously. So one time I\nworked at the big factory, they used to build floating cranes over there. They -- and\nyou know how in Soviet Union 1s, they you -- they s-send you to collective farm to\nwork summertime. So Iam 17 years old, they send me to a collective farm. There\nwas about five people, or seven people, maybe. One Jew, engineer, me, 17 years\nold, and ab-about five schlubs. Big, huge. Out of the army already. You know what\n-- what they did to this engineer? They actually treated him like piece of dirt. All\nthe time, kike, kike, kike to him, and he couldn\u2019t do nothing. He was a -- a weak\nperson. It what my opinion is he looked weak and he behaved weak. I didn\u2019t say\nnoth -- a word, but one day we\u2019re sitting by a table, the engineer was not there,\nthese five guys and me. And you know what he says -- one of the guys tells me?\nHey, hey you, kike, give me the -- pass me the leffel. Leffel, he need a sh -- a\nspoon. Pass me the spoon. I don\u2019t know what hit me. I -- I jumped up, ran toward\nFebruary 27, 2000\nthe guy and hit him with my left, right in the jaw, right in the bloody jaw. He fell on\n-- on the floor, right? He fell on the floor and then he got up and tried to jump on\nme, but the others, they -- how we say, they s-stop him. So they separated us, but\nwe lived on the -- how you call it -- sarai in Russian language, how you call -- with\nthis hays -- haystack? How you call it, barn. Yeah, we lived on the u-upper part of a\nbarn, 1n the huge barn. So I was afraid to go to sleep. We slept on the straw, you\nknow, there was nothing, just maybe you -- you take from home a blanket, maybe. I\nwas afraid to go to sleep. We had to climb a -- a ladder. But the -- I had to go to\nsleep, so I collected a lot of stones, maybe five, six big stones. I climbed the ladder,\nstepped 1-1n the opening, and I say, now approach me one by one. And nobody\napproached me. It was some kind of psychological thing. Nobody approached me, I\nthrow away the stones and went to -- into my corner. And nobody touched me.\nThat\u2019s how we tre -- it was instinctive, you know what I mean? But it\u2019s how a Jew\nshould behave with everybody.",
        "Q: Do you think you behaved that way again because of what you had experienced\nbefore that?",
        "A: I actually behaved like this again, and it happened I\u2019Il tell you when, in 1960 --\n61. I -- I was a seaman on a fishing boat. It was not the fishing boat, it was a\ntransport boat actually, the -- named Riga. And we would cross the Atlantic by\nFebruary 27, 2000\nCanadian shores -- how to recall it precisely not to make a mistake -- by Canadian\nshores w -- you know what I did, I loaded up barrels with herring from other ships.\nAnd you worked like this 12 hours a day. It was a int -- 1t was [indecipherable] of\nsix hours and six hours. And there was one from Latgalia. A guy -- I -- Ihave a\npicture some of this, but I didn't bring it. He was from Latgalia, a lat -- a Latgo,\nand he called me kike. In those -- then, I didn't hit him, but I took a -- this worn out\nglove, with salty gloves herring and I -- three times I hit him in the face, crisscross\nlike this. And this was the end of it. One guy approached me and says later on and\nsays he could kill you -- you. And I said, well, he didn\u2019t. And what is interesting,\nnext year I was going from Riga to Moscow and th-they stopped at the station,\nright, in Latvia over there. And I walking along the train and I -- I see this guy. He\nruns towards me as if I am this best friend. It wa -- you probably have to give them\na good shot that they remember you, right?",
        "Q: So when you were -- you said you went to school at night and worked during the\nday -- and th-this when you -- we\u2019re going back in -- years when you were in high\nschool. An-And then what happened?",
        "A: No, I worked 1n th -- during the d-day and went to high school. I graduate from\nhigh school and then I was drafted to -- in -- tha -- I want to mention -- yeah, you\u2019re\n-- [am okay, I am okay. I want to mention one thing. Maybe it has to do something\nFebruary 27, 2000\nwith anti-Semitism. I -- when I graduate from seventh grade I wanted to go to junior\ncollege. I always dreamed about becoming a geologist. So, I have a -- I had a friend\nat the [indecipherable]. He was already a student in -- in Siberia geological\nfaculty. And so I was talking with him what he is doing and -- and I ask him, wh-\nwhere do you think should I go for these courses? He says, come to us to Swedlosce\nover there. But I didn't want to go cold, I remember this, cold. So I say, I'll go to\nUkraine, be -- for exam. Well, it was 1952. I went -- okay, I send my papers, they\nhad invited me for it. I passed the exams very good. I think I should have became a\nstudent of -- in Kiev, capital of Ukraine, but I got a letter that I was not taken, so I\nthink 1 -- there was a reason for n -- me not being taken. An-And this ta-tartar told\nme, you will never be a student in Ukraine, he told me himself, my fr-friend. He\nsays --",
        "Q: This is because you were Jewish?",
        "A: Yes. He says, come to Urals. That\u2019s what happened. I think it\u2019s better that I\ndidn\u2019t go and become a geologist. I -- I feel that otherwise I would be staying in\nRussia til now.",
        "Q: So what did you do instead?\nFebruary 27, 2000",
        "A: When I came home I go this information that I -- so I went to high school,\nbecause this was junior high school. So in 1955 I was drafted in the army. So they\ntook me --",
        "Q: This is the -- the Russian army\u201d?",
        "A: Yes. I was in the Russian army, it was September 1955, I think. And --",
        "Q: What\u2019s it like to put on a Russian uniform?",
        "A: First I want to say that I didn\u2019t go to college. I don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t feel like -- to\ngo -- going to college. And I -- I went to the army, I would say, not thinking about\nanything. So, of course wa -- how they transport you, they transport you cattle cars.\nLater there was no -- any accommodations.",
        "Q: Did that bring back any memories to you?",
        "A: Probably. And especially what was interesting, one time -- okay, wh-wha -- what\nhappened, we were traveling and suddenly we stopped. We heard shots. Shots,\nshots, we stopped, everybody began running toward the sounds. They opened wide\nthe cattle car, the doors, and they see a soldier 1s lying -- he was then not a soldier,\nin civilian clothes, were not soldiers yet. And I see he was dead. What happened, a -\n- a drunk sergeant, he was drunk, he gathered all these boys together, drove to --\ninto a corner and began shooting, and he hit only this guy, fortunately. So what -- I\nhad my first experience with the army. Then we came to a town called Perlomiesk.\nFebruary 27, 2000\nYou have a lot of tr-translation to do here. I don\u2019t know. And we came to a town\ncalled Perlomiesk and a big division over there called [indecipherable] division.\nDo -- don\u2019t write this. This [indecipherable] division it\u2019s called because they don\u2019t\nhave a full, how you call, personnel. It\u2019s only maybe half or a quarter or whatever,\nduring peaceful times, I think. So I went to this Molodog Bietz, it\u2019s called the\nyoung soldiers\u2019 training. We lived in barracks, 200 people. The food was, you\nknow, we used to call it kairza. It\u2019s like they gave us boots, only they\u2019re not from\nleather, they\u2019re made from some kind of plastic. So we called the food they gave us,\nthis kairza, like plastic it was kasha, like porridge. And a little bit of sugar and a\nlittle bit of meat. Yeah, everybody was hungry, you know, hungry, I will tell you.\nSo we spent like this maybe ha -- training half a year, you run, you -- maneuvers,\nyou shoot, you know, and all this stuff. You go to -- a -- a bathroom is about in the\nmiddle of the -- we call it -- we call it town over there [indecipherable] bathroom.\nA big barrack with -- for about 200 people, opened ho-holes over there, and around\ntoo, everybody urinates around the barrack. The barracks were so cold, it was about\nfour degrees Centigrade. And -- and thievery? I had hundred rubles and my glasses,\nI had begun wearing glasses. And so I put it under my pillow, gone. Forget it. You\nknow, if you\u2019d -- even -- we call partienki, it\u2019s not like socks, but a piece of cloth\nyou wind around your feet, right? And even this would be stolen, if they were new,\nFebruary 27, 2000\nat least, you know. I-I\u2019ll tell you, two years I was in the army, I remember going to -\n- taking a bath only four times. In the beginning we went three times and then I\ndidn\u2019t go to -- didn\u2019t have a bath for a half a year. I -- we were wearing underwear,\ns-summer underwear. For winter they would give us like formbika, it\u2019s like cotton,\nright? And there was so -- supposed to be white, but it was not white, it was earthy\ncolor, you know, black. An-And the [indecipherable] were all -- the shirt -- the\ngreen shirt, you -- you would take a -- a knife and clean with a knife the dirt off the\n-- you know, to come off. This what kind of an army. I used to play pretty good\nsoccer, and -- but I didn\u2019t want to play soccer, you know, no matter how hard they\ntried to convince me. Swimming, I swam very good and I wanted to get away from\nthere, not to stay there.",
        "Q: Were there a lot of other Jewish -- very many other Jewish soldiers, and did you\nstay together?",
        "A: With me, was only one Jew, Dick -- Dick Teryoff. And this Dick Teryoff was\ntreated pretty badly. You know when you her -- see small people, short and weak?\nThey have a field day with them. But I wouldn\u2019t say that anybody touched me,\nbecause I came, 18 year old, I weighed six -- 73 kilograms and then in about a year\nya -- I became 82 and pretty athletic. One day my lieutenant saw me naked, took a\nlook at me he was oh -- he was a very short guy -- and he look at me and se -- says,\nFebruary 27, 2000\noh how beautiful you developed. You know, I was athletic, I only needed meat a\nlittle bit on my bones, you know? But when you are short like Dick Teryoff and --\nyou were treated like a piece of dirt. And besides we had a lot of -- from Asia, Cos-\nCossacks, Uzbeks, Chuwash from Volgar region. And I\u2019Il tell the u -- the\nUkrainians were the worst. Especially I remember sergeant Ukrainian. He didn't\ndare to tell me a bad -- bad word, but I -- I felt he had something inside. He wanted\nto say something, but he didn\u2019t dare to. But those [indecipherable] people, they\nwere called churek, chumek, and all kind of, you know, words that they wouldn\u2019t\nlike it, to hear. One guy turned out to be a German over there, and with a strange\nname. His name was Ingalls. Is it strange or not? Friend of Karl Marx. And I think\nhe was pretty anti-Semitic. A German guy from Volgar region.",
        "Q: Did he -- did he attempt anything with you?",
        "A: No, no, he didn't attempt to play with me, no. He was a big, strong guy, but he\ndidn\u2019t [indecipherable]",
        "Q: How long were you in the army?",
        "A: I was almost two years. What happened, in 1956, as -- as -- as you know, or\nmaybe know, Czechoslovakia, through Russia -- or Russia through\nCzechoslovakia began selling weapons. And all the weapons went to Egypt\nthrough port of Nikolaev. So they sent us to Nikolaev to load the ships. And you\nFebruary 27, 2000\nwould do 12 hour shift with very little food. I would say they would bring at night,\nif you worked at night, they would bring you a -- two slices of bread with a cup of\ntea and a piece of sugar. It\u2019s all what you would get. And I worked over there all\nsummer, July -- it was in June, July, August, I think three months. It was this funny\nin-incident in my -- I wouldn\u2019t say incident with me. I was on guard and there was a\nraider on ze -- on the truck, Zeil. And one -- I was on guard there, and one day, I\ndon\u2019t know what hit me, I took my rifle and had -- had the sh -- stick, it\u2019s called like\na -- it\u2019s like a knife, how it\u2019s called in English, I don\u2019t know, a knife on the front of\nthe rifle. And I hit with this -- with this knife, a tire.",
        "Q: A bayonet, you mean?",
        "A: Bayonet, right. And I hit the -- I hit the tire of the raider. Then it, I think\nsomething going to happen to me. I became scared. And they didn't notice. And\nnext few days I was not there on the guard, but when I came back I noticed that\neverything went over the -- overseas. And I was lucky enough to escape this kind --\nthey would prescribe me probably treason or something, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Were you involved with anything going on in Hungary at the time?",
        "A: Pll tell you. Okay, so -- so we left Nikolaev in end of summer, I think. We came\nto our base -- and they send -- this was October, I think, 1956, they send us to\ncollective farm, to work on a collective farm, and we slept in a church, a former\nFebruary 27, 2000\nchurch. They -- they didn't have any electricity there. They only had electricity for a\nfew hours. The -- the gi -- girls would come over, you know, with soldiers and you\nwouldn\u2019t even see their faces. They used to show movies over there and use their\ndiesel, you know, so there was some light maybe inside there, in the church. But\notherwise, hm. So, one night, it was maybe three o\u2019clock in the morning, they say\nalarm, alarm. We got up -- it was about 150 kilometers from our base -- we didn\u2019t\nask nothing, nobody asks, you have an orderly row. And we came to our base, and -\n- and they tell us something happened in Hungary. It was November, October \u201956,\nsomewhere. And they said -- so they took half of our battalion. They di -- it took\nonly about a day or two, they gave out uniforms special for battle, battle gear, and\nfortunately they only took half of our battalion and they sent it to Hungary, and I\nwas lucky, stayed home. And later I -- I met one guy and he was wounded in the\ncheek. A -- a bullet went through his -- both cheeks and never touched his teeth.",
        "Q: Were you proud to be in the Russian army?",
        "A: In those times, you know, I wouldn't say I was very proud to be in Russian army,\nbut I actually had no feelings, 1s what I want to say, I had no feelings. I lived there,\nand you have to do what they tell you. And I -- I -- I wouldn\u2019t -- I didn't think about\nit. There is no -- they wanted me to be an officer, one time they approached me and\nFebruary 27, 2000\nsaid we\u2019ll send you to acadamia -- academy in somewhere -- Odessa. But I never\nwanted to be nobody there. I didn\u2019t want to be nobody there.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: It\u2019s probably -- you know what? I'll tell you the truth, I think subconsciously it\nprobably had to do with happened to my father\u2019s cousin. I knew that no -- no matter\nwho you are there, this -- the higher you climb, the faster you fall. I had the feeling\nlike this. So this what -- I -- you know, maybe -- I remember my father-in-law, he --\nmaybe he was proud of having a guy like Kaganovich in the ku -- in the\ngovernment, but I didn\u2019t have such a feeling because I know who Kaganovich was.\nIf you can\u2019t speak Yiddish, or your own language, you don\u2019t have your culture,\nwhat kind of -- you know --",
        "Q: Did you feel very Jewish when you were in the army\u201d?",
        "A: I felt it, yeah, I felt good that I am Jew. I am not religiously, but -- but -- but my\nblood. You know, wa -- I remember when I was younger, when Stalin died and we\nhad this situation, my mother was very afraid.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nFebruary 27, 2000\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection\ninterview with M-M-Michael Lin. This is tape number three, side A. And you were\ntalking about Stalin.",
        "A: Yeah, I was talking about I remember in 1953 when Stalin died, and my mother\nwas scared because of the situation, you know, with the -- I heard all -- all the time\nabout the doctors and the ti -- timosh -- what her was named, this Ukrainian last\nname? Timoshuku or whatever, I don\u2019t remember her name. And one day yo --\nactually I -- I would say they were talking about [indecipherable] being prepared\nfor transportation as to somewhere, faraway places. So that\u2019s why my mother was\nreally afraid. One day Stalin died suddenly. It was March nine, I think or -- or\nearlier. I was skating alone in a park, Catholic park in Riga and I heard this. I had --\nfor me, it didn't bother me at all. I -- I don\u2019t even believe that somebody cried with\nsincerely. Maybe somebody did. For me this was absolutely non-event that he died.\nI was skating, then I come home and my mother say -- say -- says to me, what\u2019s\ngoing to happen to us? And I remember precisely what I told her. I say, somebody -\n- they will find another one. It was -- was my words, precisely. This was -- was my\nrecollection about the situation with her, was in *52 - \u201953.",

        "A: When I left the army, I didn't go -- want to go to work right away, so I went to\ntechnical school. I went to te -- actually, I went to Leningrad Geological Institute,\nbut I forgot, Ill tell you, mathematics, and I -- I couldn\u2019t pass properly. I -- I\npassed, but it was not good enough. It was a very prestigious institute -- college, I\nwould say. So I went to a technical school, after a year and a half I graduated, I\nwent to work. I worked at a power station. I worked at a power station and then I\nwent to a diesel plant, where I met my wife, and my wife was from Moscow region.\nShe was a -- she even used to work at the power plant in krem -- in the Kremlin.\nYes, she was an ice -- insulation mechanic.",
        "Q: And her name?",
        "A: Rya Lin. Rya Bramawa, her maiden name. But she -- she never saw nothing,\nand her father died in action. And they lived in a village beyond Moscow\n[indecipherable] Vladimir, and she doesn\u2019t know nothing about nothing. Nothing\nat all.",
        "Q: So you met your wife, and then did --",
        "A: Here we go, I met my wife and I don\u2019t know if maybe I married young a little\nbit. Was 23 years old, she was 22, we didn't have an apartment and we didn\u2019t have\nnothing. And I had -- first we lived with ma -- my mo-mother and my stepfather\ndidn\u2019t want us, so I\u2019m -- I -- I -- I make him to want us. And then I tried to collect\nFebruary 27, 2000\nsome money to buy an apartment during the Khrushchev time. You know they\nallowed to buy? So I went to -- became a seaman to make a little money, because\nyou don\u2019t spend it. And my wife worked, and we bou-bought our own apartment, a\nsmall one in Riga. And we had the son over there in \u201964. But my parents, they\nalways wanted to emigrate to Israel, and they started very early apply, and I applied\ntoo. Oh, it was interesting.",
        "Q: When did you first start thinking about emigrating to Israel?",
        "A: Oh, I think I began thinking about 1963, but I didn\u2019t apply yet. I let my parents\napply. They began probably \u201964 to apply, or maybe even earlier. You see, I -- I was\na seaman in a -- on a Si -- on a fishing boat, right? On a -- then I wanted to be in a --\non a boat that, how you call a -- how you say it? A boat -- goods? To -- to --",
        "Q: A freighter?",
        "A: Yes, I want to be on a freighter. And you know tha -- I applied to be on a\nfreighter and they never took me. You know, there is a reason why they didn\u2019t take\nme. They didn\u2019t want -- they understood maybe I run away or something. I\nwouldn\u2019t do this. I was a very placeable person. I wouldn\u2019t run away and leave my\nparents and my wife and my -- this was impossible. But nevertheless, you know the\nsituation. So then in 1960 I went to college, nights. I took -- I took shipbuilding\ncourses. Yeah, I worked daytime and I took sh -- courses in shipbuilding in Russia\nFebruary 27, 2000\nfive years, nights. But everything til -- diploma, I didn\u2019t want to take my diploma.\nPll tell you the truth, I was afraid that they impose a penalty when I leave Soviet\nUnion, and I felt that wouldn\u2019t be proper that I take this diploma. It was mo -- my\nfeeling. But my parents, they left -- we managed to leave in 1966 September, with\nmy sister, she was then 17 years old. I went to Moscow with them, and you know,\nthey had this embassy and police, a lot of police was standing behind. I was very\nnaive probably, or what, I don\u2019t even know why. The policeman approached me and\nbegan talking so loud. I -- he began talking so loud that I -- I -- I even asked him,\nwhy are you talking so loud? I didn't realize that he had the microphone probably\nover there hidden. So -- but then when I -- we entered the embassy, we went to\nsome of the persons over there and I see a map hanging, of Israel, and it was \u201966.\nWe -- we couldn\u2019t talk loud over there, so in whispers I -- I took a pencil and on the\nmap I made the West Bank like this, I surrounded the West Bank, I say, it has to\nbelong to us. And you know, fortunately the next year it happened. And then they\nleft in 1966 for Israel and I was applying, applying of -- five times. They were\napplying many times too.

So I came\nto Israel, I didn\u2019t go to any [indecipherable] like many other people, I didn\u2019t take\nany loans or something like this. In two days, because my profession was very\ngood, I went to work for Kablan. It\u2019s a private entrepreneur. So -- and he put me to\nwork Haifa Kimikali.

And they didn\u2019t pay too much. But I\nthink -- I got an apartment, nice apartment in Kiryat Shmuel, and I thought I am in\nparadise. [indecipherable] I considered, my wife doesn\u2019t work, my kid is okay. I\nma -- make money that I can pay rent. The rent was cheap then. I can eat whatever I\nwant and still put aside something in the bank. So what do you expect? Even I\nworked a lot, but I was strong guy, I worked.

I wanted something bigger, some -- it\u2019s what my feeling was. It was not\nmaybe financial, no. But something bigger, like. So one day, we -- we had the\nrelatives in America, my grandfather\u2019s sister. She -- she was here since 1920. I\nnever knew about her, but she -- she -- I asked her to send me a letter.

I\ntook my oath of religions, and after that they released me and after six or seven\nweeks and I went back to America.

And\nFebruary 27, 2000\nher hu-husband is a dentist and she is an owner of some -- what -- my feelings are\nvery confused about the situ -- Germany. First of all, of course, they helped to\nbuild Israel, it\u2019s for -- we know it, money-wise, ah -- they must. Maybe new\ngeneration, they better. Was it only brainwashing, o-o-or else during the Hitler\u2019s\ntime? I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know, this a -- or, weren\u2019t there anti-Semites before Hitler?\nAs we Say, a dirty pond breeds mosquitoes, no? So it was a dirty pond, Germany,\nthat bred these mosquitoes. What I say, a lot of people don\u2019t like Jews. You have to\nread history of our people. And no matter how hard you try to escape, some people\ntry to escape to be Jew, it will not help them any way. It\u2019s showed through history\nthat even in fifth generation, you will be one day hit hard. I am proud to be Jew,\nthat\u2019s it. And I always said I am Jew, that\u2019s it. What can I say? Who escapes our n-\nnationality? I call it nationality, not just a religion but -- because anybody ha -- can\nhave a religion, but nationality, it\u2019s one. You have certain features, you have certain\nblood, maybe. But religion, it can have any religion. Karl Marx was a -- a\nChristian, right, considered. What kind of feature he had? Everybody -- if you walk\nthrough Moscow, everybody would call him kike, take a look at him. No matter\nhow hard he tried to escape Judaism, or Jewish people.",
        "Q: Have you become more religious in any way since your experiences?\nFebruary 27, 2000",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t become religious, but I am proud of our achievements. I am proud\nthat we have Bible. I am proud that people -- that everybody, e-especially in the\nwestern world has a part of our culture. Everybody, and they can\u2019t escape it.\nSometimes I even have a feeling that everybody wants to be a Jew, but in their own\nway. And this is impossible. So I -- Iam proud of our achievement. Maybe I would\nlike to have m -- cultural achievements like the Greeks, maybe in architecture or in\nsome other things. Maybe I would be in disagreement with the Bible, but actually\nthey were different times. You had to take from the pagan world, you had to take a\ncertain people and make them who they became. And there was no other way,\nbecause you couldn't pray to a -- to a statue, right? This was ma -- now, of course\nwe a little bit we are out of -- separate from religion, it was -- in some ways it g-\ngave us the opportunity to achieve our greatness, actually Jewish people are great.",
        "Q: How did you impart that feeling to your children, about the greatness of the\nJewish people?",
        "A: I-I -- I tried to knock in their head all the time. My older is not -- you know.\nMaybe he has in his heart, but he -- but my younger is very proud, and he work for\nJewish causes and he went to Israel, served voluntarily in the army, worked in\nkibbutz. And this is a different k -- person. But my older is more materialistic, you\nFebruary 27, 2000\nsee. I don\u2019t know how to express this. [indecipherable] materialistic too. A lot of\nthem, unfortunately.",
        "Q: Are you more comfortable around people who experienced World War two\nfirsthand than those of us who did not?",
        "A: No, it depends on situation. You know, I don\u2019t have many friends I would say,\nbut I don\u2019t talk -- people in America they don\u2019t understand, many of them. They\ndon\u2019t understand what it is. They have it too fat here. They\u2019re only complaining.\nComplaining and complaining. They took one dollar away from them, they already\nthink that they are hungry. You see, depends on situation. Comfortability depends\n-- of course I am happy to see my old friends, we have organization with survivors\nof -- Holocaust survivors from Latvia, so I am a member, pay my dues. But -- but I\nknow a few of them, one or -- one, two. That\u2019s it, because they\u2019re all from different\nplaces and older people than I am, even. Some of them younger, but --",
        "Q: Did you go to the large 1983 American gathering of Holocaust survivors?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t go to Holocaust survivors. You see, those Jewish organizations are\nso fragmented, and it seems to me I don\u2019t like many things about this, reparations\nand this, all what\u2019s going on. Pay the personalities from -- maybe if you have your\nname in the s -- in the bank, your personal name, you should get paid, yeah. But in\ngeneral, my opinion is, 1t should go to the state of Israel, everything. I-I have the\nFebruary 27, 2000\nfeeling all the monies, it -- where we\u2019re building our country, that\u2019s where it should\ngO.",
        "Q: How would you describe yourself today? Israeli, American --",
        "A: First of all, mostly I describe myself as a Jew. My first love goes to Israel. I -- I\n-- I\u2019I] tell you, even when the -- the weather is over there no rain, I feel bad when\nthey have no rain, you know? And this is first, these are my -- my head is -- it\u2019s --\nyou know, it\u2019s separation of head and heart. My head is materialistic, my heart is --\nprobably a lot of people like this, it\u2019s my -- I\u2019m not the first. My heart is with m --\nIsrael and the Jewish people. I know we have a lot of faults, obviously, like\nanybody else. I don\u2019t say that we are better than anybody else, but we are peculiar\npeople, we\u2019re special. And that\u2019s what it is.",
        "Q: You were here in the 70\u2019s in the United States and of course there was the big\nCivil Rights movement that started in the 60\u2019s here. Do you feel that you, who lived\nthrough times when your rights were taken away, and your parents and everybody\nelse, that you have a more -- a bigger sensitivity to people whose rights have not\nbeen addressed.",
        "A: When -- you\u2019re talking about the black ama -- African Americans? You -- you\nsee, like I said you\u2019re a person, no matter what color. If you\u2019re a good person,\nyou\u2019re a good person, if you\u2019re a bad person, you\u2019re a bad person. And I didn\u2019t live\nFebruary 27, 2000\nthrough Civil Rights movement during the 60\u2019s over here, I was in the 70\u2019s. But I\nheard about the Black Panthers, and I -- but it\u2019s a radical organization. I -- I don\u2019t\nthink by bullets and wa -- and bombs, you will achieve too much in this country,\nbecause this country, despite its democracy, we have a very strict police over here\nand -- and intelligence. I don\u2019t think -- and -- and lately I began feeling that -- you\nsee, I am a middle class person with a blue collar back-background, right? We start\nin polit-politics now. And I feel that a lot of blacks don\u2019t like Jews, unjustly. I-I\nhave my philosophy about that. Jewish people tried to help everybody, they out of\ntheir skins to help everybody but always it turns out against them. It\u2019s what happens\nwith us. No matter what you do good for them, one day they will say you didn\u2019t do\nnothing for us and you going to be a Jew anyway. So we have to mind our own\nbusiness. We have to be strong, we have to know how to defend ourselves and I\nthink we have to keep our culture alive. I -- I don\u2019t say about, let\u2019s say inter-\nmarriages, or some other things like this. [Il frank -- I\u2019Il tell you, new blood helps.\nBecause I know in our religion we even allow cousins to marry, first cousins and\nthis is not good. It creates monsters during generations. It\u2019s why short people or\nweak people or something like this.\nFebruary 27, 2000",
        "Q: Are there any smells or sights or sounds that come back to you now as an adult\nthat you remind you of your difficult times during the war? Anything that triggers\nyour thoughts about the war time?",
        "A: Yes, I'll tell you. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to dislike people of -- Latvian people of -\n- in general. But I have the feeling that they -- they wronged us. They wronged us\nand during Ulmenist time it was pretty good. You know, we had culture, we had the\n-- you could do anything you want. But probably -- the fascists are fascists, they\nalways felt the -- with the help of Nazis they tried to achieve Ju-Judenfrei country,\nyou know, so -- but this is not the first time, and I hope it\u2019s the last, but \u2019'm a\npessimist about this.",
        "Q: You think this could happen again?",
        "A: As long as Israel is strong, I don\u2019t think so, but it\u2019s gonna -- goes into realm of\npolitics. So I think we\u2019re becoming weak in Israel. Too m -- you see, you can\u2019t\neven compare Israel of today and Israel even 30 years ago. No, I don\u2019t even know\nwhat to say. What to say, we just giving away -- our tiny country away. O-Of\ncourse we have to separate from the Arabs, we have to separate somehow. But t --\nempty land, we have to keep it. We have to keep it. When I look, let\u2019s say at Golan\nHeights, it\u2019s not only defense of the country, we\u2019re always emphasizing defense\nand defense and defense. It\u2019s not that. Take a look. Who divided up Africa, Middle\nFebruary 27, 2000\nEast? The Colonial powers. They divided up, they set up borders and they set up\ntheir rules, their international borders. Who gave them the right to separate\n[indecipherable] Jordan from Israel -- from -- or to separate Golan Heights from\nIsrael? Who gave them the rights? It\u2019s what I me -- question. Don\u2019t forget, Golan\nHeights was a tribe of Manasseh once. And you have to look at the historical\nprospectus. You know, during Roman times, your first je -- war, Golan Heights\nbelonged to -- to Jewish state. Was it under Agrippa, or what his name was,\n[indecipherable] the second? I don\u2019t remember the name of the king with the\n[indecipherable] but it was under Jewish rule. I remember this vividly. So if\nFrench or English they decided to, for their own purpose to put new borders, why --\nI don\u2019t go along with it.",
        "Q: What do you think the role of education should be about the Holocaust to the\nnext generation? Something like the Holocaust museum, for example? Do you think\nlessons can be learned from the Holocaust, or is it too large, too much to be\ngrasped?",
        "A: You see, we have many deniers of Holocaust, right? I -- I don\u2019t know, when\npeople come and -- and look at the exponents, right? Exponents or exponents? I\nthink it depends on the person what his feelings are, or he doesn\u2019t want nothing\nhappen to u -- anybody else. Or some people cu -- come with a vicious heart. It -- it\nFebruary 27, 2000\ncan happen too. They look and look and say, ah good. This what happened to them,\nfine. You can\u2019t -- you can\u2019t get into a heart of a person. Sometimes they\u2019re frank,\nyou know, I -- I worked with bl-blue collar workers and I know how they smell,\neven in America. So there\u2019s nothing new that the anti-Semitism exists. I don\u2019t\nknow what is the percentage, but everybody whispers, right? And especially for me,\nI don\u2019t look like Jewish, sometimes they think that I am a German. So they are\nfrank with me. And --",
        "Q: And how do you answer them?",
        "A: It\u2019s a big surprise to them. You see, I don\u2019t use my fists any more because it\nwould be a prison term. So I know how to behave, but you know, whatever was said\nabout Jews over the centuries, it\u2019s alive today, in -- in their hearts, in their minds.\nThey don\u2019t -- they will never change.",
        "Q: Do you feel another Holocaust could happen?",
        "A: Maybe not, maybe not like a Holocaust, but you see, t-take Austria. You see\ncoming to power people like this Hey -- Haider. See, that\u2019s very simple. Good that\nHaider is a small politician in a small country, right? Suppose somebody comes in\nUnited States. It can\u2019t happen? Ah, anything can happen.",
        "Q: Do you feel safe here in the United States?\nFebruary 27, 2000",
        "A: Yes, I feel safe now because we have a good economic climate. Ec-Economy 1s\ngood and everything is prosperous. You always feel safe when there\u2019s something\nlike this. In Germany we didn\u2019t have this situation with the inflation and\nunemployment and all that, Hitler would never come to power, you know that.\nNow there -- if the situation comes back, huh? I remember the situation here when -\n- about the loans to the farmers in Iowa. Right, they began blaming their bankers,\nthe Jewish bankers, right? No? So see, you can\u2019t change. How you say, a -- a\nleopard can\u2019t change its spots, right? So what can you say?",
        "Q: Do you speak openly about your wartime experiences to others?",
        "A: I-I would say I don\u2019t talk about it.",
        "Q: Why not?",
        "A: Well, what to talk about it? You know, the locals, they wouldn\u2019t understand\nwhat it means, you know? How you talk to them? They -- you -- why would I talk,\nit will be complaining like, I feel. You can\u2019t teach nobody nothing. I know how they\nsmell right away, ar-are you at least neutral toward Jews, or you friend of Jews, or\nyou against us. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s in your heart, it\u2019s not that you can change by words. I\ndon\u2019t think so. You don\u2019t change people.",
        "Q: Is -- is there anything you wanted to add, or leave a message to your\ngrandchildren for the future? Anything you wanted to say?\nFebruary 27, 2000",
        "A: No, [ll leave it open. Pll -- Il not say nothing. I just want them to be smart\npeople. Our people, our nation, I fight for. That\u2019s it. Hey, Pll tell you the truth, I\nhave people, my -- my first cousin is [indecipherable]. You know who\n[indecipherable] is. 10 kids. Useless for the country. They deny even existence of\nIsrael. This is my flesh and blood, my first cousin, she. Tamara. Tamara, what\u2019s\nher last name? She was born Lin. So what is [indecipherable] good for? Our\npeople, right? Hm? So, there are Jews, and then there are Jews, too. They\u2019re not\nconsidered [indecipherable] Jews, but -- no way. That\u2019s all that I want to say.",

        "A: My father\u2019s name was Abba Lin and my mother\u2019s name Kia Lin, born\nHayman.",
        "A: My father, he was born in the small village called Babovka, and in the\nbeginning he -- he studied in Yeshiva. But then he decided to drop it and became a\ntailor and when he came to Riga he established a small business. Yeah, a small\nbusiness.",
        "A: [have a half si -- a half sister. She was born in -- after the war, in 1946.",
        "A: Yes, I -- I had a -- a large extended family in Latvia actually, because my\ngrandfather had 15 brothers and sisters, and of course, 1-in those times, half of them\ndied early. But --",
        "A: On my father -- oh, yeah, my grandfather on my father\u2019s side. But I-I have\nknown three of his sisters and one brother, I have known personally.",
        "A: My father came over from Barovka, they rented an apartment in Sardonikova\nStreet. Sardonikova Street was in the -- the so-called Moscow [indecipherable].\nAnd no -- how is it to say maybe less than a mile from the center of the city,\nbecause Riga was then a small town, only 300,000 people. And yeah, this was most\n-- a lot of Jews li -- used to live there and later it became a ghetto over there, so you\nshould know the area, about. It was --",
        "A: I would mostly describe it as a working class neighborhood. Across the street\nthey had -- it was not a church. In Russian language it was called bougadena,\nwhere they used to house poor people, you know. And I would say working class\nlike shop owners or factory workers or small business people. Like my father was,\nyeah.",
        "A: Well, my parents met each other -- you -- the villages where they used to live are\nvery close to each other, about six kilometers, I think, or maybe less from each\nother. So one village was called Skundaliena and the other was called Barovka.\nAnd they probably knew each other much earlier than -- before they got married.",
        "A: I -- I want to ask -- no, just ask me a person [tape break] Okay.\nFebruary 27, 2000",
        "A: Okay. My mother was born actually in Daugavpils in a hospital, but 1t was si --\nsix kilometers from the village called Skundaliena as I mentioned. And my\ngrandmother, he -- her name was -- maiden name, Kuperschmidt, right? And my\ngrandfather\u2019s name is Hayman. So where they got married, they had a small farm,\nlet\u2019s say maybe 18 acres, s -- a -- a country store and a few cars, maybe seven cars\nand th-th-they possess some land. It -- 1t\u2019s unusual, I think for the Jews to possess\nland, right, in Latvia. So they considered themselves more or less well -- well off,\nright? And so my mother actually, since her childhood, she worked in the farm and\nworked in the store and worked in the office, keep the book -- bookkeeping with her\nsister and older brother. Her older brother went to Daugavpils and then became a --\na -- a businessman. And she and her older sister and their mother, they -- they ran\nthe st -- the business. And my -- on my father\u2019s side, my father was a blacksmith\nand so they were poorer, much poorer. And my -- you see, my mother was a foo --\nof the so called -- maybe they considered themself intelligentsia or something. So\nshe married late, because she was very choosy, I think. So -- but she realized that\nmy father was a good man and had a -- a head on his shoulders, so I guess it\u2019s how -\n- what happened.\nFebruary 27, 2000",
        "A: This is a peculiar situation because my mother was never a religious woman, and\nmy father was very religious. I remember that on holidays my grandfather used to\nsend a -- a kishen. We\u2019re talking in Yiddish, but it\u2019s a pillow in English, with a --\nwith a chicken, you know, ga -- slaughtered chicken. I do -- even remember the\nblood in the kishen and the -- a-and the feathers, you know. And my -- my father\ntried to have a Jewish house, kosher, all of this, but my mother always resisted and\nsometimes my father was take -- would take a -- a knife my mother used to cut\nbutter and then use it for meat, and throw it out the window. And this what the\nsituation was. You know, so there was a -- you know, I would say, a contrarian\ninterest. Of how you call it?",
        "A: Yeah, yes, yes. [indecipherable] that again?",
        "A: To each other they spoke Yiddish, but to me they always spoke Russian, and we\nlived in a -- in Latvia. Is -- but -- but in -- in those areas, they came from Latgalia\nwhere people mostly spoke Russian language more than Latvian, because it was\nclose to Polish border too. So they spoke Polish, my mother spoke German and my\nfather, of course, spoke Hebrew and Latvian and that. And my father served in\nLatvian army too, when he was a young man.\nFebruary 27, 2000",
        "A: No, it\u2019s hard for me to tell because I was very young, but I can imagine that\nwhen you live in a bu -- how it 1s, I -- of course they\u2019re Jews. F-Fir -- first and\nforemost they\u2019re Jewish people, but you\u2019re loyal to your country where you live.\nIt\u2019s -- it\u2019s why he served in the army, and dealt with the -- in business and\neverything, it\u2019s -- it -- and he stayed, even -- he\u2019s -- his brother actually left for\nPalestine in 1934 to become a chalut, but we stayed in -- now I want to turn off\nand I want to say something, but I don\u2019t know what to say. Turn off, please. [tape\nbreak] What -- where did we stop?",
        "A: Yes, you see, in Latvia there was an organization called [indecipherable] and\nthis organization actually an-anybody could belong to -- to this organization, but --\nand my mother and my aunt, and probably my grandmother, I\u2019m not sure, belonged\nto this organization, [indecipherable] just was a pure Latvian organization. I would\ncall it guards, and because you were a property per-person, you should have\nbelonged to this, especially in rural areas, that\u2019s what I want to say.\nFebruary 27, 2000",
        "A: Yeah, they did belong to this organization. Of course, during the Soviet times it\nwas forbidden and we\u2019d not -- you wouldn\u2019t mention that you belonged to this\norganization, but if a -- as a matter of survival you would like to belong to this\norganization, my mother did.",
        "A: No, it didn\u2019t require, probably only paid dues, and you know, probably only that.",
        "A: I would say my fir -- very first memories, th-the coming of Soviet army in 1940.\nMaybe before I have some memories, but in 1940 I -- I remember standing by\nschool number 56 [indecipherable] Soviet times it was number 56, and I saw\nSoviet tanks coming off Moscowyella, it\u2019s a street called Moscowyella in Latvia.\nAnd I remember the small tanks, yeah. And where they parked, they were parked --\nthere was a -- a street called Zilnaw iela where the great synagogue used to stand,\nthat they burned it. There was a cor -- small corner between Lacspiesa iela and\nZilnaw iela and all the -- right there there was a corner where the Soviet tanks\nstood.

        "A: I can tell you something about [indecipherable] I\u2019Il tell you, my father was a\nsmall businessman and about maybe seven, 10 people used to work for him in the\nshop, tailor shop, and he made the suits for -- for a company. So after the Soviets\ncame, of course he had to relinquish his business and what is interesting, that the\nSoviet government, they hired him to work for them in the army, to make uniforms,\nI think, and th -- and he was making good money, they paid very well.",
        "A: Yes, as a civilian, he was working in the Soviet army as a civilian, yes. And the -\n- the former, his employees -- you know, in -- in capitalist countries the employee\nnot -- not always is satisfied with his salary or something. So they would -- before\nthe Soviets came in, they knew they would come in, they said oh, when they come\nin, you -- you will not feel so good. After they came in, my father was hired by the\nSoviets and the workers made so little that they would meet my father and say, I --\nhow good it was when we worked for you, in comparison what we make now when\nwe work for the Soviets.\nFebruary 27, 2000",

        "A: No, I can\u2019t remember that she -- she -- she told me, no.",
        "A: My next memory is when the war started. In 1941, it was June. And I think -- I\nremember my father carrying me -- before that I would say when we left our\nFebruary 27, 2000\napartment, we -- we possess some goods, especially with -- my father had some\nstuffs. I remember sacks of goods sitting on the floor, we lefted everything.",
        "A: Why we were leaving? We had to run. We had to run for our lives and I think\nmy father took me on his arms. He only put on -- he had the leather, I remember, a\nblack leather overcoat and my mother took a few things. She -- my father had the\ngolden watch, and this overcoat and then he carried me to -- to the railroad. Not to\nthe station, on the Lacspiesa iela there was an overpass. And that\u2019s to the train. And\nI think this was the last train. And I remember -- Ill tell you the truth, I remember\nshooting, and I think shooting and shooting and shooting a lot. And I wouldn\u2019t say I\ncan say for sure that they were bombing us at this particular time, but I am sure that\nthe train was the last one to leave Riga. I can\u2019t say the date, but this was the last\ntrain. And I was -- sat in the train, it was a mixed train of civilians and military. And\nwe took off so slowly, 1t was so slow -- there was a place called Mezure Park, it\u2019s -\n- Mezure Park it\u2019s -- it\u2019s like a forest park. It\u2019s pine trees, you know? And it took\nus so many hours to get to Mezure Park, it was maybe five kilometers from us.\nAnd you know what happened? Turned out the military suspected that the m-\nmachinist there, locomotive machinist, that\u2019s called? He was probably a traitor is\nFebruary 27, 2000\nwhat we understood. So, I-I -- I saw it. They pulled him out of the locomotive, put\nhim against the train and shot him dead. And since -- after that, the train began\nmoving, and quickly -- pretty fast. And then suddenly, German airplanes came over\nus and began bombing. They began bombing, we left the train, began running into\nthe forest. And I personally, I remember I fell into a pit, a very deep pit with water.\nI lost my parents, I didn't know where they are. And I woke up -- I-I woke up on the\n-- on the table, operating table, right in the forest. And the doctors, they patch me\nup. I -- I was wounded in my right leg. Even now I have a big scar. And yes, it\u2019s\nhow it happened. We boarded our train back and it turned out that the last three\ncars, railroad cars, they were blown apart, and my mama to -- mama told me that\nabout 40 people died in the train. So, I think 1t was the last train, and from then we\nmoved pretty good to-towards Estonia and we moved pretty fast I would say til we\nreached [indecipherable], then we came to Yeloslavil. Yeloslav Skyoblis, it\u2019s a\nregion, Yeloslav Sky -- yeah.",

And then we went back to her village and I\nwas running and suddenly a dog bit me on my left foot.

I'll call it -- my\nmother\u2019s uncle had seven kids -- seven children. Their name was Kuperschmidt\nand then the -- they remained in Riga with all -- with all seven kids and ob-\nobviously they were killed. And my grandfather remained in his town Barovka and\nhe was shot. My mother\u2019s sister, her name was Dwara. In Russian they used to call\nher Vera. She was kept alive with her son, as my mother told me, for awhile,\nbecause she was a translator for the Germans, translated from German into Latvian\nand Russian, I know this. And my ol -- uncle, with his wife -- yeah, ma -- my -- my\naunt, she was married in 1935 or \u201936 and her to a person named Opanansky, who\nwas Sa -- later in Soviet army, and he was killed in action. And she -- she had the\nsmall child, two years old, so was -- she was killed in -- with the small child, two\nFebruary 27, 2000\nyear old male. And my u-uncle, he was shot in the -- in the fortress of Daugavpils\nwith his wife and the three year old too -- male child. And then I had the -- my\ngrandmother\u2019s sister, on my mother\u2019s side, sh-she -- she didn\u2019t have her own kids,\nbut she -- she married to a person who had his own four. But two of them escaped.\nOne of them actually, a woman, I don\u2019t remember her name, she was a communist.\nAnd in 1937 the -- she was caught by Latvian police and probably worked over\ngood in the prison. And then they probably released her and she went to Russia.\nBut you know what happened in Russia in 1937. So they -- they grabbed her and\nsent her to Magadan. She got married in Magadan, f-far eastern Pacific Ocean,\nshe got married. And I saw her in 1957, she had a son. And sh-she spent 20 years in\nMagadan, from \u201937 to *57, it was precisely when I came from the army and I saw\nher. It was strange that she never blamed the communists for her misfortunes, which\nwas very strange. And my grandmother\u2019s si-sister, as I mentioned, they were\nbusiness people, dealt in lumber and had properties and houses in Daugavpils, so\neverything gone.

They lived next building from the yard across this. Their last\nname was Pantz. We met them in this town -- not town, it\u2019s a village, Pol\u2019kino.\nBecause I was wounded my mother had to carry me once a week or whatever to a\ndoctor about eight kilometers away for bandages. It\u2019s an interesting story there. My\nFebruary 27, 2000\nfather and some of his friends, they -- they tried to catch some fish in the river. And\nyou know what? After all their efforts, they caught only one fish. One fish, I\nremember this, one fish. And why I remember that very good, because now my --\nmy daughters-in-law father, he came from Byelorussia -- but actually, it\u2019s not like\nthat.

I remember January 1942, we\nlived in a big wooden house. And -- and the hunger began to set in. You know why\nI remember this very well? Because there was an 80 year old person, and he\nprobably had money. And he had the girlfriend who was about 30 years old, so --\nand we lived together in one room, about maybe, I would say 30 people. I\nremember another thing. He had money, so he bought some carrots. They dug a -- a\n-- a pit and buried the carrots into the pit and covered it so -- some food, right? So\nthis -- what I want to say, this old man lived with this younger woman -- well she\nFebruary 27, 2000\nlived with him for -- of course for food. And suddenly this house burned down. It --\nI remember snow in central Asia, snow. January there, snow. And then -- it was \u201942,\nyeah, we moved to a barrack. My mother worked at the factory that used to make\nropes, and she would leave me alone, obviously, in the barrack. Yeah, I was bitten\nby a scorpion at night once, in my left leg, and my father once reached into his\npockets at night and got bitten in the -- in his hand. I would say with food the\nsituation was so bad, if I tell you that I didn\u2019t see any milk for four years, you\nwouldn\u2019t believe me. And bread, they used to make it from a little cornmeal, how\nyou say, the dark, dark bread, mixed with -- we call in Russian language mich.

        "A: In 1941 I caught malaria. Yes. An-And lucky for me -- and then I had a little bit\npneumonia too, maybe in light form. I thought I\u2019m going to die, I said my mama,\nI\u2019m dead. I remember she began crying and all this, but survived.",
        "A: Then, in Utchkulgan. No, th -- no, this was not Utchkulgan, this was Andejan.\nThis was Andejan. And luckily for me, my grandmother\u2019s brother lived there with\nhis daughter-in-law in there -- and -- hi-his daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law\u2019s\ndaughter. This I have to tell you, his name was Moskevich. Velville Moskevich,\nVelville. In Russian language they call him Vladimir, but he was Velville. Actually\nwe would say wolf in Yiddish. His son was a famous flyer, everybody knows him,\nYakov Moskevich, a general and commander in chief of Soviet Air Force. Two\ntimes hero Soviet Union. As we know, he was arrested in 1941 and with other\ngenerals, and shot. So -- but in Uzbekistan where I lived in, they probably didn't\nknow about the situation with him yet, so they supplied food to -- to his father. So\nit\u2019s how we survived, because they didn\u2019t know of the situation. But later on they\narrested his daughter-in-law and sent her to -- to far away places, this I know. So I\nFebruary 27, 2000\nsurvived 1941. So I mentioned you about the burning down of the house. So, after\nthat we moved to a barrack. I would say maybe seven families lived there, in the\nbarrack.

So\nmy -- my mother had to survive somehow. She began dealing -- how you say selling\nand buying fruits, vegetables, you know and selling and buying and sometimes she\nwould go into the desert and collect tortoises, yes. She had a big, how you say, not a\nhammer, but an axe. And she would discard the par -- carapaces and only take meat\nout and the eggs, and bring it in a sack. One time she was really caught in -- ina\nstorm. It was a terrible storm, I remember and -- but she brought the sack with --\nwith the turtles, anyway. She got sick, but -- but my father\u2019s sister, she probably\ndidn\u2019t have a strong constitution my mother had. So sh-she began actually starving\nto death. One day she had diarrhea, they took her to a hospital. And they took her\nhospital -- after she became a little better they fed her sauerkraut soup. And you\nFebruary 27, 2000\nknow what it is, sauerkraut soup? You eat it, in a few hours you\u2019re dead. That\u2019s\nwhat happened to her.

And I was with him together in this room. I\nremember getting so scared I crawled along the wall and bolted the door and ran\nand ran til I -- I don\u2019t know for how long I ran. I stopped and I -- in a few hours I\ncame back and I remember some me-medical personnel, of course not in a car,\nFebruary 27, 2000\nmedic -- some medical personnel gave him an injection, I think and he died over\nthere.

        "A: In Utchkulgan we stayed til 1944, when my mother got news from Ural\nmountains -- beyond Ural mountains, it was the cor -- valley -- it\u2019s not a valley,\nactually. Beyond the Ural mountains there was a town called Tavda. So in 1944 --\nyou know, I had nothing to wear, because we lived in as -- | -- I -- actually, I was\nsick for three years with malaria, right? I got some quinine, right? I remember\nsitting on the -- in 120 degrees Fahrenheit sitting on -- on the -- on the stone and\nshaking. You know what malaria is? After three years of malaria? So, my mother\ngot the news that my father\u2019s first cousin, he was a -- a soldier in Tavda, there was\na -- a prison for -- maybe for all kind of people, political and the criminal elements.\nAnd they called her to come over there. So I had nothing to wear so my mother\nknitted something for my feet, and it was December already. You know, I had to\nwear this. We stopped over in [indecipherable] town, right? Now it\u2019s probably\ncalled Orenburg, if I can remember. I look out the window -- you know, we took a\ntrain, right? We come to Orenburg. We stayed only there, my mother had to look --\nsomebody told her maybe my father is alive, because she got the news that he was\nreleased from the army because of sickness, but she couldn\u2019t find him. We stayed\nover -- the wind was sweeping -- this is an open plain, no forest over there and the\nwind was sweeping so horribly that my mother couldn't take it any more, so we --\nwe boarded a train to Swedlofska and from there to Tavda. I'll tell you, we had the\nFebruary 27, 2000\nvery [indecipherable] small luggage. There was no -- no luggage, actually, and she\nplaced it on the -- on the floor and somebody wanted to steal. So my mother was\npretty alert, she gave him a -- a kick in the behind so he fell in -- on the railroad\ntracks, I remember that. When we boarded the train -- of course there are no toilets.\nThere are toilets, but you know what, no heat. So the human excrements and all this\nurine, was frozen and piled up I would say maybe three feet high. Yeah, and that\u2019s\nhow we traveled to Tavda.

And the Usbecks, of course\nthey had their orchard in somewhere else -- there was a market, surrounded by a\nhigh wall, as they do it in Asia, was a clay wall.

They\u2019re very long, wooden\nhouses, and the entrance is from both sides, both sides of the houses. So I was\nsitting on the one side, the end of the house and looking through the window I see\nthe soldiers going bear hunting. And I -- I bolted out through the door, it was about\n40 degrees Centigrade, minus, and I jumped on the sleighs, and my hands and knees\ngot stuck to the sleigh, so they had to pull me off the -- the steel. I was crying, of\ncourse, but they know what to do, they put in a -- in a big pot they put some cold\nwater and they dip your hands into -- in this cold stuff. Yeah, but it\u2019s very painful.\nSo, it was a much better place than in the Uzbekistan, plus they had some dried\nnettle.

So we stayed\ntil May 1945, we stayed in Saragulka. And -- and then we t -- went to Riga, but I\ndon\u2019t even remember what trains we took, was it the passenger trains or any other.

And yeah, we did a few things that I recall. Yeah, I remember\n-- this I will tell you. One time, what they did, they -- they made for me like boots,\nhigh boots, called buky. And one day, it was probably January, there was only one\ntractor and one lorry. Lorry is in English a truck. And it was disabled. Zilfife the\nlorry was. So the tractor was pulling the lorry and we kids were running after this --\nthe lorry. And we got into -- deep into the forest, everybody of the kids they jumped\ninto the top, I would call it, of the truck, and I tried to do it too.

She grabbed me, put me\non her shoulders and brought me home to the village. So -- yeah, for three months I\n-- | had this swollen leg, but fortunately nothing broke.

And she would give a hint that he was a Zionist, he was\nscared, you know. Obviously my mother was joking, but you see, Zionist is a good\ncause. It\u2019s why we have our country there, and he was a Zionist and didn't want\nanybody -- he belonged to a sports club and he was, himself from Rezekne, and his\n-- two of his sisters, they went to Palestine in 1933, but his mother and two br -- an\nolder brother, they all were killed in Rezekne.

        "A: Yes, I went to high school -- a-actually, you see, he was not my father, right? So\nhe always insisted that I go to work. I was 13. Go to work, go to work, but I want --\nI wanted to study. I wanted to study and I went -- actually I went to school\nevenings, high school. I went to work, I was a lathe -- lathe operator, worked a little\nhere, a little there, you know, what do you want, you were 13 or 14 or 15 years old,\nyou know. And that was tough actually, in many ways, obviously. So one time I\nworked at the big factory, they used to build floating cranes over there. They -- and\nyou know how in Soviet Union 1s, they you -- they s-send you to collective farm to\nwork summertime. So Iam 17 years old, they send me to a collective farm. There\nwas about five people, or seven people, maybe. One Jew, engineer, me, 17 years\nold, and ab-about five schlubs. Big, huge. Out of the army already. You know what\n-- what they did to this engineer? They actually treated him like piece of dirt. All\nthe time, kike, kike, kike to him, and he couldn\u2019t do nothing. He was a -- a weak\nperson. It what my opinion is he looked weak and he behaved weak. I didn\u2019t say\nnoth -- a word, but one day we\u2019re sitting by a table, the engineer was not there,\nthese five guys and me. And you know what he says -- one of the guys tells me?\nHey, hey you, kike, give me the -- pass me the leffel. Leffel, he need a sh -- a\nspoon. Pass me the spoon. I don\u2019t know what hit me. I -- I jumped up, ran toward\nFebruary 27, 2000\nthe guy and hit him with my left, right in the jaw, right in the bloody jaw. He fell on\n-- on the floor, right? He fell on the floor and then he got up and tried to jump on\nme, but the others, they -- how we say, they s-stop him. So they separated us, but\nwe lived on the -- how you call it -- sarai in Russian language, how you call -- with\nthis hays -- haystack? How you call it, barn. Yeah, we lived on the u-upper part of a\nbarn, 1n the huge barn. So I was afraid to go to sleep. We slept on the straw, you\nknow, there was nothing, just maybe you -- you take from home a blanket, maybe. I\nwas afraid to go to sleep. We had to climb a -- a ladder. But the -- I had to go to\nsleep, so I collected a lot of stones, maybe five, six big stones. I climbed the ladder,\nstepped 1-1n the opening, and I say, now approach me one by one. And nobody\napproached me. It was some kind of psychological thing. Nobody approached me, I\nthrow away the stones and went to -- into my corner. And nobody touched me.\nThat\u2019s how we tre -- it was instinctive, you know what I mean? But it\u2019s how a Jew\nshould behave with everybody.",
        "A: I actually behaved like this again, and it happened I\u2019Il tell you when, in 1960 --\n61. I -- I was a seaman on a fishing boat.

And we would cross the Atlantic by\nFebruary 27, 2000\nCanadian shores -- how to recall it precisely not to make a mistake -- by Canadian\nshores w -- you know what I did, I loaded up barrels with herring from other ships.\nAnd you worked like this 12 hours a day.

He was from Latgalia, a lat -- a Latgo,\nand he called me kike. In those -- then, I didn't hit him, but I took a -- this worn out\nglove, with salty gloves herring and I -- three times I hit him in the face, crisscross\nlike this. And this was the end of it. One guy approached me and says later on and\nsays he could kill you -- you. And I said, well, he didn\u2019t. And what is interesting,\nnext year I was going from Riga to Moscow and th-they stopped at the station,\nright, in Latvia over there. And I walking along the train and I -- I see this guy. He\nruns towards me as if I am this best friend. It wa -- you probably have to give them\na good shot that they remember you, right?",

So, I have a -- I had a friend\nat the [indecipherable]. He was already a student in -- in Siberia geological\nfaculty. And so I was talking with him what he is doing and -- and I ask him, wh-\nwhere do you think should I go for these courses? He says, come to us to Swedlosce\nover there. But I didn't want to go cold, I remember this, cold. So I say, I'll go to\nUkraine, be -- for exam. Well, it was 1952. I went -- okay, I send my papers, they\nhad invited me for it. I passed the exams very good. I think I should have became a\nstudent of -- in Kiev, capital of Ukraine, but I got a letter that I was not taken, so I\nthink 1 -- there was a reason for n -- me not being taken.

        "A: Yes. He says, come to Urals. That\u2019s what happened. I think it\u2019s better that I\ndidn\u2019t go and become a geologist. I -- I feel that otherwise I would be staying in\nRussia til now.",

        "A: First I want to say that I didn\u2019t go to college. I don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t feel like -- to\ngo -- going to college. And I -- I went to the army, I would say, not thinking about\nanything. So, of course wa -- how they transport you, they transport you cattle cars.\nLater there was no -- any accommodations.",
        "A: Probably. And especially what was interesting, one time -- okay, wh-wha -- what\nhappened, we were traveling and suddenly we stopped. We heard shots. Shots,\nshots, we stopped, everybody began running toward the sounds. They opened wide\nthe cattle car, the doors, and they see a soldier 1s lying -- he was then not a soldier,\nin civilian clothes, were not soldiers yet. And I see he was dead. What happened, a -\n- a drunk sergeant, he was drunk, he gathered all these boys together, drove to --\ninto a corner and began shooting, and he hit only this guy, fortunately. So what -- I\nhad my first experience with the army. Then we came to a town called Perlomiesk.\nFebruary 27, 2000\nYou have a lot of tr-translation to do here. I don\u2019t know. And we came to a town\ncalled Perlomiesk and a big division over there called [indecipherable] division.\nDo -- don\u2019t write this. This [indecipherable] division it\u2019s called because they don\u2019t\nhave a full, how you call, personnel. It\u2019s only maybe half or a quarter or whatever,\nduring peaceful times, I think. So I went to this Molodog Bietz, it\u2019s called the\nyoung soldiers\u2019 training. We lived in barracks, 200 people. The food was, you\nknow, we used to call it kairza. It\u2019s like they gave us boots, only they\u2019re not from\nleather, they\u2019re made from some kind of plastic. So we called the food they gave us,\nthis kairza, like plastic it was kasha, like porridge. And a little bit of sugar and a\nlittle bit of meat. Yeah, everybody was hungry, you know, hungry, I will tell you.\nSo we spent like this maybe ha -- training half a year, you run, you -- maneuvers,\nyou shoot, you know, and all this stuff. You go to -- a -- a bathroom is about in the\nmiddle of the -- we call it -- we call it town over there [indecipherable] bathroom.\nA big barrack with -- for about 200 people, opened ho-holes over there, and around\ntoo, everybody urinates around the barrack. The barracks were so cold, it was about\nfour degrees Centigrade. And -- and thievery? I had hundred rubles and my glasses,\nI had begun wearing glasses. And so I put it under my pillow, gone. Forget it. You\nknow, if you\u2019d -- even -- we call partienki, it\u2019s not like socks, but a piece of cloth\nyou wind around your feet, right? And even this would be stolen, if they were new,\nFebruary 27, 2000\nat least, you know. I-I\u2019ll tell you, two years I was in the army, I remember going to -\n- taking a bath only four times. In the beginning we went three times and then I\ndidn\u2019t go to -- didn\u2019t have a bath for a half a year. I -- we were wearing underwear,\ns-summer underwear. For winter they would give us like formbika, it\u2019s like cotton,\nright? And there was so -- supposed to be white, but it was not white, it was earthy\ncolor, you know, black. An-And the [indecipherable] were all -- the shirt -- the\ngreen shirt, you -- you would take a -- a knife and clean with a knife the dirt off the\n-- you know, to come off. This what kind of an army. I used to play pretty good\nsoccer, and -- but I didn\u2019t want to play soccer, you know, no matter how hard they\ntried to convince me.

        "A: With me, was only one Jew, Dick -- Dick Teryoff. And this Dick Teryoff was\ntreated pretty badly. You know when you her -- see small people, short and weak?\nThey have a field day with them. But I wouldn\u2019t say that anybody touched me,\nbecause I came, 18 year old, I weighed six -- 73 kilograms and then in about a year\nya -- I became 82 and pretty athletic. One day my lieutenant saw me naked, took a\nlook at me he was oh -- he was a very short guy -- and he look at me and se -- says,\nFebruary 27, 2000\noh how beautiful you developed.

And besides we had a lot of -- from Asia, Cos-\nCossacks, Uzbeks, Chuwash from Volgar region. And I\u2019Il tell the u -- the\nUkrainians were the worst. Especially I remember sergeant Ukrainian.

But those [indecipherable] people, they\nwere called churek, chumek, and all kind of, you know, words that they wouldn\u2019t\nlike it, to hear.

He came and then came one my\nJewish friends, Cherfus Laib. Yeah, this Cherfus Laib worked with me and we\nattended college together. He was a manager at the diesel plant.

So I came\nto Israel, I didn\u2019t go to any [indecipherable] like many other people, I didn\u2019t take\nany loans or something like this. In two days, because my profession was very\ngood, I went to work for Kablan. It\u2019s a private entrepreneur. So -- and he put me to\nwork Haifa Kimikali. Haifa Kimikali it was a plant that was built in Haifa, a\nchemical plant, and it was just -- they\u2019re beginning to build with a French firm\ntogether. So I worked there for awhile. I worked there for awhile, but then I decided\n-- but there were no benefits. I didn\u2019t even know. I didn\u2019t even know how much I\nget, and I worked 24 hours a day many times. And they didn\u2019t pay too much. But I\nthink -- I got an apartment, nice apartment in Kiryat Shmuel, and I thought I am in\nparadise. [indecipherable] I considered, my wife doesn\u2019t work, my kid is okay. I\nma -- make money that I can pay rent. The rent was cheap then. I can eat whatever I\nwant and still put aside something in the bank. So what do you expect? Even I\nworked a lot, but I was strong guy, I worked. But then I -- I just -- I had a bad\nexperience with my -- Kablan, you know [indecipherable] business, he want to\nFebruary 27, 2000\nsqueeze out a few. So I -- they took me Vulcan. It wa -- they used to build military,\nth-the, you know, duds. You know what a dud is, like bomb that -- no, it doesn\u2019t\nexist now, so I can say. So it was like a cast iron fact-factory, they used to cast iron,\nyeah.

I was a -- you know, I came 32 years old, nobody\ntouches me? I work, but I felt somewhat -- something small, felt like I\u2019m confined,\nyou know? I wanted something bigger, some -- it\u2019s what my feeling was. It was not\nmaybe financial, no. But something bigger, like. So one day, we -- we had the\nrelatives in America, my grandfather\u2019s sister. She -- she was here since 1920. I\nnever knew about her, but she -- she -- I asked her to send me a letter. So she send\nme a letter, I came on a tourist visa and -- by myself. A few days we\n[indecipherable] here, a owner of a factory, textile plant. So, he hired me.

They actually didn\u2019t need me.\nWell, okay, I went through the same motions as a young fella, Mechana David. I\ntook my oath of religions, and after that they released me and after six or seven\nweeks and I went back to America.

        "A: A bracelet made from gold and pearls, right? My mother always mentioned it. So\none day, it was 1952, I think, I coming home -- I was about 15, I coming home and\nI see a woman sitting by our door. A very skinny woman. I remember her, she was\nso skinny. She asked me, here Chaya lives? Chaya, my mo -- my mother. I say yes,\nbut my mother wasn\u2019t home, so I didn\u2019t let her in. After a few hours my mother\ncame from work and -- her name was Antya and she was of Polish origin. Turned\nout she was from my mother\u2019s village, Skundaliena. And we didn\u2019t have a big\nplace, so she slept on the floor. Mattress was on floor After she left, my mother\nshowed me a bracelet, this bracelet. She says, you know what Antya bought? This\nbracelet. My grand -- my mother, she -- my grandmother\u2019s bracelet, she brought it\nfrom Skundaliena. She said, my sister, before she was shot with her son, she\nhanded over to my -- this Antya, and this Antya kept it til sh-she brought it to my\nmother, this bracelet. Ill tell, this Antya was so poor, hungry and she brought this\nFebruary 27, 2000\nbracelet to my mother. What happened to this bracelet? In 1966 when my mother\nwas allowed to travel to Israel --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: Yes, so when my mother was allowed to travel to Israel she took the bracelet\nwith her, and in Keev -- Tamozhnya it\u2019s called, the checkpoint, they na -- didn\u2019t\nallow her to take it with her. So -- but they were kind enough to write out a receipt.\nSo two years later I was traveling to Crimean peninsula with my wife, so we spent a\nmonth vacationing. On the way back I went to Keev, and the -- and the checkpoint\nthe -- I had this receipt because my mother sent it from Israel. So I had this receipt\nand they gave the bracelet back to me. And I knew that I would do -- be going to\nIsrael, I didn\u2019t want to lose it, so what I did, I made two wedding rings for me and\nmy wife. So it\u2019s how it is, it\u2019s what to ba -- story. But I wanted to emphasize how\ngoyim, some goyim are good, good people. Oh, the other friend of my mother\nKuiznitz Orway, who used to live right on the Moscow Street, close to Rumbula\nforest where the Vulcan, there used to be a factory, a rubber factory, he used to\nFebruary 27, 2000\nwork, this g-guy in there, and they were witnessing the slaughter of Jews in\nRumbula f -- th-the her -- they probably didn\u2019t see in person, but they heard the\nshots for sure, and they told my mother. And they were g -- very good people.\nMaybe they didn\u2019t hide Jews because -- but as Russian people, they were from --\nfrom her village, from Skundaliena, they were very good people.

I -- I didn\u2019t go no\ncemeteries, no nothing. I -- I felt I don\u2019t want to see it any more, you know? Maybe\nit\u2019s wrong, but it\u2019s how I feel.",
        "A: Yes. Because one time when my -- it was 1965, we went -- we had -- had a\nJewish cemetery in Riga, in Yugla area, where my grandmother was buried. And\nthen my -- my mother\u2019s aunt died in 1965 and they buried her in Jewish cemetery.\nAnd when I was in the Jewish cemetery there was nothing to remind me of my\ngrandmother, there was ground. My -- my mother stomped the ground in the place\nFebruary 27, 2000\nwhere my grandmother was buried and said, here is the place where she was buried,\nas far as she could -- could remember.

First of all, of course, they helped to\nbuild Israel, it\u2019s for -- we know it, money-wise, ah -- they must. Maybe new\ngeneration, they better.

I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know, this a -- or, weren\u2019t there anti-Semites before Hitler?\nAs we Say, a dirty pond breeds mosquitoes, no? So it was a dirty pond, Germany,\nthat bred these mosquitoes. What I say, a lot of people don\u2019t like Jews. You have to\nread history of our people. And no matter how hard you try to escape, some people\ntry to escape to be Jew, it will not help them any way. It\u2019s showed through history\nthat even in fifth generation, you will be one day hit hard. I am proud to be Jew,\nthat\u2019s it. And I always said I am Jew, that\u2019s it. What can I say? Who escapes our n-\nnationality? I call it nationality, not just a religion but -- because anybody ha -- can\nhave a religion, but nationality, it\u2019s one. You have certain features, you have certain\nblood, maybe. But religion, it can have any religion. Karl Marx was a -- a\nChristian, right, considered. What kind of feature he had? Everybody -- if you walk\nthrough Moscow, everybody would call him kike, take a look at him. No matter\nhow hard he tried to escape Judaism, or Jewish people.\nFebruary 27, 2000",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t become religious, but I am proud of our achievements. I am proud\nthat we have Bible. I am proud that people -- that everybody, e-especially in the\nwestern world has a part of our culture. Everybody, and they can\u2019t escape it.\nSometimes I even have a feeling that everybody wants to be a Jew, but in their own\nway. And this is impossible. So I -- Iam proud of our achievement. Maybe I would\nlike to have m -- cultural achievements like the Greeks, maybe in architecture or in\nsome other things. Maybe I would be in disagreement with the Bible, but actually\nthey were different times. You had to take from the pagan world, you had to take a\ncertain people and make them who they became. And there was no other way,\nbecause you couldn't pray to a -- to a statue, right?

You know, during Roman times, your first je -- war, Golan Heights\nbelonged to -- to Jewish state. Was it under Agrippa, or what his name was,\n[indecipherable] the second? I don\u2019t remember the name of the king with the\n[indecipherable] but it was under Jewish rule. I remember this vividly. So if\nFrench or English they decided to, for their own purpose to put new borders, why --\nI don\u2019t go along with it.",
        "A: You see, we have many deniers of Holocaust, right? I -- I don\u2019t know, when\npeople come and -- and look at the exponents, right? Exponents or exponents? I\nthink it depends on the person what his feelings are, or he doesn\u2019t want nothing\nhappen to u -- anybody else. Or some people cu -- come with a vicious heart. It -- it\nFebruary 27, 2000\ncan happen too. They look and look and say, ah good. This what happened to them,\nfine. You can\u2019t -- you can\u2019t get into a heart of a person. Sometimes they\u2019re frank,\nyou know, I -- I worked with bl-blue collar workers and I know how they smell,\neven in America. So there\u2019s nothing new that the anti-Semitism exists. I don\u2019t\nknow what is the percentage, but everybody whispers, right? And especially for me,\nI don\u2019t look like Jewish, sometimes they think that I am a German. So they are\nfrank with me. And --",
        "A: It\u2019s a big surprise to them. You see, I don\u2019t use my fists any more because it\nwould be a prison term. So I know how to behave, but you know, whatever was said\nabout Jews over the centuries, it\u2019s alive today, in -- in their hearts, in their minds.\nThey don\u2019t -- they will never change.",
        "A: Maybe not, maybe not like a Holocaust, but you see, t-take Austria. You see\ncoming to power people like this Hey -- Haider. See, that\u2019s very simple. Good that\nHaider is a small politician in a small country, right? Suppose somebody comes in\nUnited States. It can\u2019t happen? Ah, anything can happen.\nFebruary 27, 2000",
        "A: Yes, I feel safe now because we have a good economic climate. Ec-Economy 1s\ngood and everything is prosperous. You always feel safe when there\u2019s something\nlike this. In Germany we didn\u2019t have this situation with the inflation and\nunemployment and all that, Hitler would never come to power, you know that.\nNow there -- if the situation comes back, huh? I remember the situation here when -\n- about the loans to the farmers in Iowa. Right, they began blaming their bankers,\nthe Jewish bankers, right? No? So see, you can\u2019t change. How you say, a -- a\nleopard can\u2019t change its spots, right? So what can you say?",
        "A: I-I would say I don\u2019t talk about it.",
        "A: Well, what to talk about it? You know, the locals, they wouldn\u2019t understand\nwhat it means, you know? How you talk to them? They -- you -- why would I talk,\nit will be complaining like, I feel. You can\u2019t teach nobody nothing. I know how they\nsmell right away, ar-are you at least neutral toward Jews, or you friend of Jews, or\nyou against us. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s in your heart, it\u2019s not that you can change by words. I\ndon\u2019t think so. You don\u2019t change people.",
        "A: No, [ll leave it open. Pll -- Il not say nothing. I just want them to be smart\npeople. Our people, our nation, I fight for. That\u2019s it. Hey, Pll tell you the truth, I\nhave people, my -- my first cousin is [indecipherable]. You know who\n[indecipherable] is. 10 kids. Useless for the country. They deny even existence of\nIsrael. This is my flesh and blood, my first cousin, she. Tamara. Tamara, what\u2019s\nher last name? She was born Lin. So what is [indecipherable] good for? Our\npeople, right? Hm? So, there are Jews, and then there are Jews, too. They\u2019re not\nconsidered [indecipherable] Jews, but -- no way. That\u2019s all that I want to say.",
