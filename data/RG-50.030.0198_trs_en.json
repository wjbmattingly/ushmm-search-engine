        "Q: Would you tell us your name and where and when you were born?",
        "A: My name is Amalie Petranker. Now it's Salsitz. I was born October 21st, 1922 in Munich,\nGermany, but I was just born there. Why? It was an accident. My mother was visiting\nthere, but I was raised, brought up and till '42 I lived in Stanistlawow (ph) which is now\n. It's very much to the southeast of Poland as Landberg (ph). Stanistlawow\nwas considered a big city. It...a large city with inhabitants a hundred thousand. From\nthere forty thousand Jews, forty thousand Ukrainians, and twenty thousand Poles. Before\nthe outbreak of the war, Polish government wanted to Polanize it, so they brought Poles\nfrom , from the German border and they settled them in Stanistlawow in order to\nincrease the Polish population. And Stanistlawow, Stanistlawow was a modern city. It\nbecame big after the Ist World War, has beautiful parks, boulevards. Had many high\nschools and each minority its own high school, like the Jews had their Jewish\ngymnasium. The Ukrainians had Ukrainian gymnasium, and the Germans had a German\ngymnasium. And naturally we had state gymnasiums and there very few Jews were\naccepted. It was numerous classes, so means a certain number, only seven percentage of\nthe students. Majority of Jews in Poland, uh in Stanistlawow were progressive. We had a\nsmall nucleus of Hasidic (ph) Jews but they lived in this one section which later became\nghetto. Uh...",
        "Q: Tell us about your family.",
        "A: My family. My parents were very progressive. My father was a , a Zionist, who\nbelieved very much in education. He was very well rounded. He had the Jewish education\nand he was a graduate of Agriculture School. For him, education was very\nimportant. My mother also was a graduate of the uh art (ph) school. This was a German\nschool. Ten years. They have something like this now in Haifa, in Israel. My mother went\nthere. All the subjects were taught in German because most of my mother's family was in\nGermany, so they wanted her to know. My fath...my father was a modern Jew, and his\nknowledge, especially in Judaic studies taught him well because he was in lumber\nbusiness and the Jews didn't like to go with any every case to the court, so they selected\nlike judges, , and my father was selected to be a because he knew the\nJewish law and because he was so educated. For him, or Hebrew scholars was\njust the same. He also had a hobby. He was a painter. And wha...this saved him when he\nwas in the army because when he was in the Austrian army, Jews were just plain soldiers,\nand actually they used to be even orderlies (ph) to officers. They have to clean their\nboots. But because of his ability to draw he worked in an office and he printed and drew\nthe announcement proclamations that they needed. My father's family was quite well to\ndo before the Ist World War, but after the war, when they were burned out, they had\nlumber business. Uh they had uh uh brick factory, and they had an inn, but they lost a lot\nof money, so what remained is only education and this made a very deep impression on\nmy late father. So having three daughters he said I will try to prepare for them dowry, but\nI'm not sure if they will be able to take advantage, so my duty is to give them very good\neducation, so at least they will have something to stand, which will sustain them, that he\nwould have foreseen what future would be. My mother was a very easy-going, very sweet\nwoman. She was very young. She was twenty-two only when I was born, and twenty-one\nwhen my oldest sister, so she was like one of us. And maybe it's good she was easy-\ngoing, because my late father was like a Prussian officer. He didn't have any sons, so he\nactually treated us like we'll be in the army, like soldiers. He was fair but very\ndemanding, so she in a way protected us. Sometimes when he was strict, she did. He\ndemanded, but now I'm very grateful. At that time it was very hard on us, like for\nexample, we attended private schools. He wanted us to be protected from being called\nkikes and Jews, so from the kindergarten...we went to a Hebrew kindergarten where all,\nwe spoke only Hebrew...we went to Hebrew school from the first grade to the sixth where\nall the subjects were taught in Hebrew except History in Polish, then we went...so of\ncourse Jewish gymnasium because the language, prevalent language was Polish,\nbut we continued with our Judaic studies, and we were three sisters. My older one was\nPepi (ph). I was the middle one and my younger one was Teela (ph) and we were just a\nyear apart, so like first, second, third grade. Second, third and fourth. So we were called\ninschool _, ; , (laughter) because we were so...just a year apart, you\nknow, and we looked alike. As a matter of fact, I looked...my younger sister looked very\nmuch like I. My older...little bit...she was platinum blonde with blue eyes and\nunfortunately I was the middle and the shortest and the smallest. And I was unhappy\nbecause in Europe was accepted to hand-down, so naturally the oldest gave to the middle\nand the middle to the youngest. In my case, I got stuff from my youngest one, so it wasn't\nso pleasant for me, so I had to prove myself and there I tried to excel in studies, like not\nonly what we had a lot of work in school. It was very demanding because it was very\nexpensive and unless we performed our parents took us out from the school, would take\nus out and we would have to learn vocation, but our ambition really was to be...to finish\nand to cont...to go to medical school, so I remember when it came Sabbath, this was the\nonly day off. Instead we should be off and go with our friends for a walk, so winter time,\nevery Friday night, my father after dinner sat down with us and we had to study with him\n, the of the Sages (ph) and also the , the Savior from the Weak\n(ph), and every Saturday, summer time, . At that time we resented it very\nmuch and I resented it very much and being the middle one, I had to show I am the best,\nso...because I was the smallest one...so uh then we were rewarded. Whoever knew got\nmoney, spending money to go to the movies. And God forbid if we didn't know what\nhappened someplace to my older sister, so she was the pride of the spending money, for\nallowance, which was really a tragedy for her at that time. And you see also not only that\nwe had to read books for school for literature. My father assigned to us books and every\nSaturday we had to finish by Saturday and discussed. So education was very stressed. My\nmother was very active like in PTA. We had lunchtime...like every Tuesday she used to\nserve lunch in gymnasium for us. I was very proud. She was a very pretty woman, on the\nheavy side with her beautiful smile, very pretty face. Now my father was in lumber\nbusiness but I think two, three years before the start of of the war, it was nationalized and\nour part by the government and it was called . Being my father was quite known\nand prominent in lumber business, the director from Warsaw came and told him, you\ncannot be director of because you are Jewish, but you will be the vice director,\nand he nominated as the director, and I mentioned because later on\nI'll tell you...he was helpful in my survival. As a rule, we were sheltered. We didn't have a\nlot to do with the Christian population. Actually each minority kept to itself. We didn't\nhave too much problem. Only our problem arose during the holidays or on Sundays,\nbecause other schools were closed. Our school was next to a church, so this was a day\nfree for them to throw stones on us. As children I resented it to be singled out. I was hurt.\nBut this was something we couldn't do. It...even when...it became so bad before the\noutbreak of the war, that the police advised our custodian...we had an iron gate around\nour school...to keep it closed, so they shouldn't be able to enter our school yard and to\nthrow stone and to beat us up. In our town, there were some incidents of anti-Semites,\nespecially when there were students came from universities at Christmas time and Easter\nand they wanted and they liked to beat up the Jews, but we had Jews who were actually\nvery strong physically, the butchers, the uh drivers and later they learned to be prepared\nand they used to take a two-by-four and fight back. They didn't take it. Now uh we had\ngood relationship with the Ukrainians because they also were minorities. So before the\nwar, they co....they cooperated with the Jews in commerce and in business, like my late\nfather needed for example a loan. He went, he got a loan from Ukrainian bank, but not\nfrom the Bellish (ph) uh, Polish bank, from the state bank. I had many friends. We were\nthree daughters. My house always was full with friends, because even if...to each one of\nus came one friend. My closest friend was Junior (ph) Lawber (ph) and happens that she\nwas named like my mother, Frederika (ph) Junior, and I was named like her mother,\nbecause my parents called me Malia (ph) and her mother. We were very close friends and\nthis was through the whole war. And also I was very close to my younger sister. We\nloved each other so much that when my parents wanted for my sister and to make sure\nthat she would listen, they came to me and they used to joke, what will happen when\nMalia will get married. With whom will you be, although it was only one-year difference\nbetween us, but my older didn't want to bother with us. She went with other friends. And\nwe had beautiful parks. We participated. We used to go to summer camps. Wintertime,\nthe winter vacation. We went skiing. We had pretty normal, happy life. It's true it was not\nthe life of all the Jews in my town. There was a select group, middle and above which\ncould afford it. There were poor Jews. There were Jews who after the mandatory six\ngrades went to learn vocation, to be a seamstress or to be a salesgirl. I would say there are\nsome very poor who just didn't have even money for Sabbath. We had some magnets (ph)\nlike , very very rich who donated planes to the government. Majority\nbarely eked out a living, but was a group like my parents, middle and above, who were\nquite comfortable. This was un...until the war broke out. In '31, in September, broke out\nthe German war, uh the World War, but we had...",
        "Q: You mean '31...",
        "A: '39. At that time I was not even seventeen years old. First, '39, after a few weeks, we read\na proclamation that the Russian army...I think after a week or two...that the Russian army\nwill come for order and safety of the city 'till the situation will be cleared and that we\nshould cooperate. So far...when the war broke out we had bombs, bombing and a few\nJews were killed. Some buildings were destroyed. But this was at the beginning, in '39,\nSeptember. The Russians came to our town. They occupied it. It was not for time being\nlike we were told, and we had never dealt with the Communists, with the Russians. We\ndidn't know what to expect. So we wanted to get some feeling, some understanding. So\nwe stopped the soldiers to ask them, to question about the life in Russian. When we\nquestioned them, they told us everything in superlative, so Jews were very skeptical so\nwe, So some just asked and tell me...how about ; . Do you have a lot of\n? And they said no, . So we knew it's all uh propaganda and not\ntrue. Our life changed drastically. Special the middle-class and the rich or the so-called\nbourgeois...like my parents were given a special paragraph, paragraph 11 - means we\nwere any moment destined to be shipped to Siberia, and in a way I wish it would\nhappened. Maybe my parents would survive. And also, I was at that time, I graduated\nfrom first . I was supposed to go to the second and graduate. So they entered\nit, and the ten-year system they call it, the class, and the standard of learning\nand living changed. Like my foreign language was English. This 1s why I have such an\naccent even now, because I learned in the gymnasium, but for them learning languages...I\nmean unless you're in special school, was a bourgeois, so this we had only reading for\ncomprehension where in the third year of my learning English I already had Shakespeare.\nLowered the standard. But the subjects math and physics was a very high standard. But\nthe problem is immediately they developed , with political departments, and\neach student was called in and specially from the middle class and I was warned, unless\nyou report on your friends, then you'll be expelled or you'll be fined. Always threatened.\nAnd then we saw our schoolmates suddenly taken in by . They had special cars\nwhich they took away. This installed fear in us. My father, who was a government high\nofficial, was in business, suddenly became a laborer. And I was accepted to institute they\ncall it. They didn't want to take me to the medical school, but they were short in teachers,\nso they expec...uh accepted me to Institute they call it,\n. Means math and physics. After four months, I was called in.\nI was told because you cannot get a stipendum (ph) because each student got a stipendum\nthat he could sustain himself and could study. You cannot because you're bourgeois but if\nyou pay us six hundred rubles a month, you can continue. At that time my father earned\nonly two hundred rubles, so naturally it was out for me. Also we lived in fear that any\ntime they will ship us to Siberia. One thing saved us. Where our house, it was actually\nour condominium, this was assigned each section was assigned to different branch of\ngovernment. Our section was assigned to rail authorities (ph). Means they could take over\nany apartment for their workers, officials that they have chosen. Our apartment were\nassigned to a Russian engineer. When he came to take it over, my sis...my younger sister\nwas present, and when he saw my sister...she was very beautiful and I1...little on the\nheavy side. He said he cannot throw my sister out. He put his name on the door, and my\nsister saved that apartment at the time. But it was very important, because we didn't have\nany other address and he lived on this one, so means they couldn't ship us anymore. We\nwere not registered. See my older sister, she got married in '31, with a Pales...Palestinian\nfrom my town who came for vacation and met her. He was eleven years her senior. He\nfell in love with her. They were in a resort and he wanted to marry her. The war broke\nout, so he gave a choice for my sister and he said, let's get engaged. After the war I will\ncome back. I will marry you. Or if you want, I can marry you and you'll go with me back\nto Palestine. My sister had chosen to get married. My parents didn't approve. She was\nonly eighteen years old, but she persuaded them being my grandmother and my mother's\nbrother and the whole family who were Germans, lived at that time in Palestine, so she\nexplained she has family there and she's not going just with her husband and they\npermitted. I'll never forget the day when she left. First of all, we were never separated,\nand like I explained we were just a year apart and my younger sister, like she would have\na premonition. She fainted and blood came out of her nose, like she would have known\nthis was the last time that she sees her. (crying) So my sister left for Palestine and my\nfamily was my parents, my younger sister and I. When the Russo (ph) German war broke\nout in '41 in June, where I worked they gave some Jews pink (ph) , Means\npermit to evacuate with the Russians. I came home with this, and I presented it to my\nparents and my late father said, I didn't know that I raised a Communist. You are not\nleaving the house. You're staying here but if you leave, you cannot come back to us. And\nmy mother said, I went through with the Germans during the 1st World War. They are\ncivilized people. I don't believe the atrocities that we hear. This must be Russian\npropaganda. We are staying put in the place. So, I was supposed to leave with my\nboyfriend, Alec (ph) Lamsdorf (ph), whose father was the chief engineer of the railroad\nauthority. Being he was Jewish, he couldn't become so-called . This was the\nhighest official, but he has a special car for himself on the line from my town to the\nborder, so we could have escaped. He proposed, he would take his sister Tricia (ph), who\nby the way survived, and I would take my sister Teela, and we four will escape if our\nparents don't want. But my father forbade me. So when the Ru...Russo-German war\nbroke out, first we had for a month the Hungarians. The Hungarian army entered my\ntown, Stanistlawow or . The Hungarians were very were good to us and\nagain, the same story. They were supposed to requisition apartments. Being our\napartment was like on the 5th Avenue, ours was supposed to requisition, be requisitioned,\nand came a Hungarian graf (ph), Count , with his adjutant. This time I saved\nthe situation. He liked me, so he decided he's not going to take it. He stayed in the hotel,\nbut he put his name on our apartment and he started courting me. I was eighteen only.\nFlowers, and food was scarce so he ate in our house so we would be able to have meal\ntogether. Was even one situation unheard of. Uh they had a spy, a Hungarian young man,\nextremely handsome, whom they used to draft in England. They had spy uh housekeeper\nfor one very important uh lord or something, and he spied for the Germans. So the count\nsaid that he has to invite him too. He'll come to our house, but we should be very careful\nnot to disclose that we are Jews. And he told us about his uh deeds, what he had done and\nhow he worked in Hungary. The Count told my father that he knows that our fate is\nsealed and it's very set. They are going to kill us. He told my father I cannot save you all,\nbut he would like to save me, so he proposed that I should embrace Christianity and he\nwill marry me and he will smuggle me to Hungary. My father expressed his gratitude and\nhe said as a family he would like to stay together. He appreciates it and in a way he\ndeclined it. I couldn't understand it. Not that I loved him but he...f was impressed. __ ten\nyears old and I remember also the graf used to come with us where the Jews were\nassigned for slave labor with the army. Among them was Baron Moore (ph) who was his\nfriend before the war. Now he tried to protect him and to help him as much as possible.\nSo even the Baron Moore talked to my father. Listen, now he's infatuated with your\ndaughter, but you are wise not to let her go. He 1s the first-born. His mother would not\ntolerate it, anditmay bea ___ unto your daughter. You're very smart, but my father\ndidn't explain to me, so I surprised, asked him why he didn't permit me. He stated the\nreason that even I understood is right at that time. Meantime, this was...they were shipped\nto Russia, to fight in Russia, and the Germans entered. At that time, they shipped\nRussian, uh Hungarian Jews to our town, and when the Germans entered, they kept the\nJews on . It was a big mill house uh and they were kept there. When the Germans\ncame, immediately they ordered us to wear the bands with the star, after age I think\ntwelve, and they ordered all the Jews to register. Specially the first to register, they\nordered the teachers...the professional people. So the Jewish , which took care of\nthe Jewish life before the war, told them to register, so the Poles should be able to\nget jobs. They never returned from the meeting where they were called to a meeting. This\nwas the first. Then we all had to register, according to the streets, and we specially from\n5th Avenue, from the nice neighborhood, were assigned as cleaning girls to the Gestapo\nbuilding to scrip, to scrub the floors and the toilets with our hands. We had to wear scrub\nbrushes, pails, and we were assigned. One day when I was assigned there...it was just\nafter a week my sister was assigned, my best friend Junior was assigned to work, and\nwe...when once we came there we haduh ___ lady who was German, ethnic German,\nmeans born in Poland, and she was the supervisor. One day, a Gestapo man came and he\npointed to me and to another girl to step out of the line. The supervisor was once a\nneighbor of mine, because when we were young, we lived in the German suburbs...was\nbeautiful, out of town and only two Jewish families lived there. Family Sweik (ph) who\nowned a farm, and me, and we. She knew us by sight because this was at least I would\nsay to '35 so means I was uh twelve, thirteen years old. When he called me out, to step\nout and this girl...this girl was a refugee from Berlin, Vita Sh , a beautiful girl. She\nwas sure that he wants to kill us, to shoot us so she said that we are good workers, decent\nworkers. We should be left alone. So he slapped her on the face. He didn't know that she's\naunt of the two brothers, Mueller (ph) who are, were very sadistic and very big off...high\nofficers in the Gestapo. He thought that she's Polish only. So she advised me not...and he,\nso he told us to report to the private quarters where they just moved in to clean the\napartments there. She advited...advised us not to report to work. She would protect us in\norder he should forget, because she still didn't trust him what he will do to us. So a few\ndays later, when we reported back, we had to clean the buildings and he spotted me\nthrough the window, and he called me in and this Vita Sh . He called me. He started\nquestioning me very nasty and he said he wants me to work, to be responsible for this\napartment. I'll never forget the picture of my sister with a group waiting outside and\ncrying because she thought this is the end. At that time I was responsible for cleaning this\nparticu...his apartment and Vita Sh was responsible for cleaning another\napartment. Meanwhile responsible because then they sent from the Jewish community, uh\nfrom the , other Jewish girls to clean and Jewish women who are wives of the\nprofessionals whose husbands were taken away, they're responsible for furnishing the\napartment. And my sister still remained in the main building to clean. You know, the\nJews from Hungary were sitting there in the coal (ph) yard. They brought them from the\nmill, from , to the courtyard of the Gestapo, and they were crying. They were\nhungry. They were tired. They were beaten, with children. They were there. My sister\nwent to work, and they made a sandwich that my parents gave her when she went to work\nand for me, she dropped through the window for them to eat. A Gestapo officer noticed\nit, and he brought her down to there. Since then I have never seen her. She started to cry,\nand there was Ukrainian police, and she told him that her sister is working in the\napartment for Gestapo and and was his name, and he should\nnotify me, who can talk that I can do something for her. This is a mistake. Then they take\nher out. I tried. So there were Gestapo who took me out of the line, he was in charge and\nwhen I came crying he told me I should go and the one who was in charge, maybe\nhe will listen to me, and I forgot in the apartment we were told not to wear the armbands.\nWhen he saw me, and I told him, explained the reason of my coming, he said so she's\nJewish. So you're Jewish. And he yelled at me...how did you dare to come without a\nband. I'll shoot you too. Actually the penalty was to be shot if somebody didn't with band.\nHe let me go...I don't know. The Gestapo, how cruel he was. He kept telling me and his\nfiance who came to live with him who was from and she took a liking to me, that\nthey took only my sister for labor because it was harvest time and they were short in field\nhands. After fall, they will release her. So, I came home and I had to bring the news to\nmy mother. Naturally it was a terrible shock and my mother tried to comfort me because I\nwas very close to my sister, and I tried to comfort my mother. My mother was only forty\nyears old and from red hair she had, she became white within a day. And we still\nbelieved...we clung to the hope that my sister will come back after the wa...the harvest.\nMeantime we saw shooting on the street, random shooting. They took the Jews and to\nwork on the street. They used to catch them, you know, and then to dig ditches or to work\nat bridges and then sometimes they used to throw them into the river and Russians\nerected many monuments so they took the Jews to destroy the monuments, and many of\nthem were shot. They didn't come back. This was going on till around, till September,\nand I still work at that time by this Gestapo. Then we were told that we will have to leave\nour apartment and to move to a section which was designated as ghetto. This was the\npoorest section of the Jews. Being...again we lived like on the 5th Avenue, my parents\nsecured immediately an apartment in the future ghetto, and the always optimist Jew that\nwe hoped war will end before we'll have to move. We transferred our furniture there. We\nstill kept only a mattress, the essential thing in ghetto and on...while we lived on\n35, with hope that we'll maybe not have to move. Then suddenly, on , October\nthe 12th, we were in our apartment which almost was bare and it was a large apartment.\nOnly the mattresses and some utensils. We heard terrible commotion and noise. I went\nout on the balcony and I saw a lot of Gestapo and Ukrainian police. We knew something\nis brewing, something bad is going...will happen, but neither what really\nhappened. We thought that maybe now they will gather the Jewish men like have done\nwith the Hungarian men that they brought to us, to break us economically so means only\nthe men are in danger. So my mother decided to hide my father in one of the attics. Each\ncondominium, condominium had it's own part of the attic and it's own part in the cellar,\nso we have hidden my father on the attic. My mother got the key. And after an hour, my\nmother's cousin who lived...also owned a condominium in this complex came and said\nlook, it's very unsafe to stay in an apartment. Let's all go to the cellar and let's hide there,\nand this was a house like a facade (ph)...many buildings. She thought it's safe there. I\nreally never disobeyed my mother because we were raised to uh obey our parents. I\nrefused to go with her down to the cellar with the family and other Jewish neighbors.\nOnly one neighbor, Mrs. Pollack (ph), who was an old lady, seventy-five, something...she\nhad, she had also hidden her husband. She decided to stay with me. My reasoning was\nthey will come in. They will see empty rooms. They will not enter the last room. This 1s\nhow my reasoning went, and I refused to go. I stayed with her in the, in our apartment.\nWe heard...we heard cries. We heard noise, but we didn't know from where it's coming.\nBy noon, my neighbor's son knocked at the door, Rister (ph), and he said your\nmother would like you very much to come. Please don't be stubborn. Again, the same\nstory. I don't know why I was so stubborn. I can't explain to today. I refused to come\ndown. I didn't. Towards evening it come down...some...Mrs. Pollack and I decided to\nventure in the hall and to find out what's going on. Our Christian neighbors said, you are\nhere. They took everybody from the cellar. They loaded them on the trucks and they took\nthem to the Jewish cemetery. It was a terrible shock. I didn't know how to act. But I still\ndidn't suspect that this was for killing. This was the first time. So I thought maybe this is\nthe gathering place, so now I have somehow to get my father out and to join my mother.\nFinally I managed with the neighbor's help, to get him out. Before we managed to go, my\nneighbor, Mrs. Reifter (ph), with her husband and children, came . Straight\nhair pulled down and from her we found out what happened...that they took them to the\ncemetery. My mother was crying on the truck when she saw the direction, and she said\nthey're taking us to the cemetery to be shot. Why didn't I listen to Malia. My parents\ncalled me Malia. At the cemetery...first of all they told them to sit down in rows and they\nsent Jewish girls, young girls, to pick up all the jewelry. And there was a board and they\nshot...even if people were killed or not, they fell to the ditch. They collected thirty\nthousand Jews on this day. My mother was with her cousin and they took my mother's\ncousin. So the cousin said to my mother, I can't witness this. So my mother said you are\nright. Let's move closer. We'll be spared to witness the shooting. Let's be shot. She didn't\nknow that when it became dark, the Gestapo announced whoever is alive can go\nback to his home. But my mother was not there anymore to come home. So this how my\nsister and my mother were gone. (crying) My father and I remained home. And now they\nshot fifteen thousand Jews on this day. This was . This was my birthday.\nOn the Jewish calendar, . Naturally I will never now celebrate on my birthday\non the Jew calendar and so immediately from my family, my father and I was left. Now\nwe had to go to the ghetto. For two people we couldn't have an apartment. They assigned\nten people per room. My mother had a step-sister. Her name was Clara Hoot (ph).\nActually I would say she was poor. They were not so close, but the goodness and the best\nwas coming out and there were bad times. She lived where the ghetto was supposed to be,\nso she approached my father and said, you're only two people. Why should you be\nassigned to strangers? We are five people. We have only a room and a kitchen. We'll take\nyou in. And she was to me like a mother. (crying) Till today, you know, I felt so guilty\nthat we didn't treat them like really aunt should be treated. How good she was, and we\nstayed with her. Her husband maked tops of the shoes and this was very good because the\nGermans liked boots so there was a German cobbler who used to bring the materials he\nshould make it. For this he got food, so he was also sustaining us, helping us with food\nwhere others were starving. The life in ghetto was just terrible. Many of my schoolmates,\nrich people, wealthy people...I will never forget the face, for example, from one other\n, only child, so spoiled...his father was the head of the Juden (ph), uh Jewish _,,\nnot Juden...and laying on the streets swollen. The next day from hunger water came out,\nand this the picture. You saw, you knew the people starving to death, and you couldn't\neven share and give them. So my father learned that if he 1s assigned as a slave laborer\nout of ghetto, at least he will have the chance to barter clothes for food, whatever...bread\nwas really very hard to get. So with his connections, he was able to get a job on the\nrailroad as as slave worker, and then he tried for me to get a job too, because my father\nsaid, being we two are left, let's not ever separate. Let's always be together. Meantime my\nuncle died in ghetto. My Uncle Dabbie Toot (ph), he died a natural death. His son, Jacob,\nwas taking . It's forced labor . His daughter was taken away\nfrom the street. She was very beautiful. They collected hundred of beautiful...hundred\nbeautiful Jewish girls. They disappeared. We don't know where. So only my Aunt Clara,\nher daughter Pepi (ph) who's named like my sister Pepi (ph), and the oldest son who also\ngot the job to make tops for the German cobbler Gross (ph)... remember his name...he\nremained. And one day my father said to me, you know what. We have to escape from\nghetto. My father had so-called iron (ph) luck (ph). Spoke Polish well. So he decided that\nwe'll try to get to the Iron side and maybe some of his friends will help us or to or will\nharbor us, will help us. We didn't think farther, just first to go out. So he dressed himself\nwith few suits. He divided the money that we have. He gave me some few thousand\nand we were supposed to go out from ghetto and try our luck. And he said let me\ngo first. If I succeed, then you go. I waited. After five minutes he came back, beaten up\nby the Ukrainian police. Luckily he had the money, because if not he would be shot, but\nthey took away his suits and the money and they pushed him back to the ghetto. So our\nescape was foiled. Meantime they will have killings in the ghetto. You know, they\nassigned the Jews, classified the Jews, just to find excuse for each killing which they call\nan aktion. First were the children. Then were all the old people. Then were people who\nwere sick, people who couldn't work, so was A, B, C classification. One day we got\nclassification of A - means we don't have to be afraid because we are working, right? One\nday we saw through the window aktion. Aktion was...there was no secret. Openly, in the\nghetto they digged ditches and they shot on the spot, so everybody had seen it. It's not\nlike concentration camp, we didn't have. We didn't have a labor camp. They just had done\nit first on the Jewish cemetery, but then when there's no room anymore, they had done it\nin the ghetto, and the ghetto was life, in between the killings, going on semi-normal. We\ntried. We hoped this is the end, especially when Roosevelt entered the war. We thought\nwe will be saved. Everybody just tried to live another day with the hope that they would\nsurvive, and one day...this was before my father obtained for me also uh a labor card that\nI can work on the railroad...again we heard rumors that there's to be another killing. My\ncousin Pepi worked in a factory where the mill was on making slippers for the\narmy. Those usually workers were excused from aktion, from killing. My poor Aunt\nClara tells me, come with me...we'll be there safe because my father was out. At that time\nit was safe to be out of ghetto when killing was going on. My other cousin, my cousin\nwas out by the German who lived in , where he made, you know, the boots,\nso she said to me, come with me. We'll be safe in the factory because they didn't touch\nbefore the factories. Again my premonition. I said Aunt Clara, I don't want to go. You\nhave an old house. You have an old hut (ph). Let's hide under where the firewood is kept\nand let's crawl under this. We'll cover it with the firewood and they will not find us. My\nAunt Clara said said you're a child. Listen to me. It's safer there. I refused. I didn't want to\ngo. Again, why? She was so good to me. She was like mother. Why I didn't listen to\nher...I remained. I crawled there. I have hid myself. She went to the factory. On this day\nthey took everybody from the factory. There was no more room for the ditches. This was\nthe first time they shipped them to to be gassed. So only my father, my cousin\nand I were left in the ghetto. So my father obtained for me a permit to work, a working\ncard to work outside, and he told me if should ever come the time that we'll be separated\nand we are not in the same transport to be sent to be gassed, let's jump from the death\ntrain, cattle cars. What more can happen to us? Let's run for our life, and within three\nweeks to get in touch with the other part which we means left in the ghetto if we are not\nin the transport, and get united again. It was in October '42. I had high temperature. I\ncouldn't go to work. My father closed me in the apartment with the lock outside. He went\nto work. Even...I had high temperature. I was delirious. I heard noises. I knew another\nkilling 1s going on, so I crawled again in the same space where I have hidden myself\nbefore, hoped that my father is safe because he is out of ghetto, yes? And nothing will\nhappen and usually when it was dark they let in the workers from outside, the slave\nworkers in to the ghetto. It's dark. Meantime they came to look in the apartment with the\ndog, and the Germans said, is here, rouse (ph), and they leaved uh left the\napartment. So I was so happy. I said at least my father is safe. When it's dark he will\nreturn to the ghetto and we will be united. It's night. My father is not there. So I decided,\nsick or not sick, I have to go next day to work...you see, because we used to march, and\nthey guarded us with the Ukrainian police to work actually like prisoners, and I'll find out\nwhat happened. Before even I came to work, my Christian acquaintance was standing\nbehind the gate of the ghetto and she said, don't look for your father. They took all the\nJews from outside to be shipped to be gassed. So I somehow, knowing my father I knew\nhe will do everything not to let himself be shipped to the gas. And meantime what I didn't\nmention, once when there was such killing and we knew we all had Cate...Category A\nmeans we're exempt from shooting, we stayed in apartment. At that time my Aunt Clara\nwas still alive. Her daughter Pepi was alive, my father and I. And the brother\nopened our apartment. We presented our cards and they said, rouse. They always ignored\nit. We were fools. We thought that they will respect it. He recognized me from the days\nwhen I was assigned to the private apartment because he had that sadistic pleasure when I\nwent to work to knock at the window, and I was very afraid of him because he known,\nwas known as a sadist, and this give him a pleasure. So I guess in ghetto when he came to\ntake us out for shooting, he pushed me inside. He recognized me through the apartment\n(ph). So I had the presence of my uh mind that I'm...and I said no. He is my father. I\ncannot let him go. So they didn't believe me because my father was very young looking\nso they were two brothers - Willie and Hans (ph), so one tried to test me so with his uh\nwhat...rubber what they had...uh not gun...oh how you call tt... ( )...he hit my father\nvery hard and I saw tears from my father's eyes, so I started to cry bitterly. This\nconvinced them that this is my father. So they permitted him to go with me, and then I\nsaid on my aunt, this is my mother. I will never know why they let me go, but they let go.\n. When it was day of trial in Vienna, I was called as a witness, and I have\nproblem. I didn't know what to do. To go to testify because I witnessed many killings, or\nbecause he recognized me, not to go. And I have chosen not to go but I'll send somebody\nelse, and unfortunately she didn't know the facts. And the facts were after they let us go,\nthrough my window I saw where was the , the gathering place already where\nthey took for killing, and I saw Willie shot my neighbor, Mrs. Leichter (ph) who\ncame from the cemetery who told me what happened at the cemetery, in the back. She\nwas just walking. So it was willful killing. It was not that she was caught in the aktion.\nThis kind of guy he was. So maybe I was destined to live, and this what happened. So\ncoming back to this, when I lost my father, I was left alone. The German shoemaker kept\nmy cousin and he kept him in his apartment...he should work for him. While I was\nworking as a slave labor on the railroad, every Jew or Jewess was not _\u2014 because we\nhad the and we had to work with our bare hands to wash the toilets and scrub the\nfloors. There was employed a carpenter, a by the name Abraham...uh Edmond\nAbraham Ovitch (ph). He was from , half hour away from town Stanistlawow\nwhere there was a big concentration of and they were considered by Hitler, by the\nGermans, as foreigners because they were Turkish descendants from Crimea (ph). Mostly\nthey were farmers or army men. And he worked there. He offered me...when my father\nwas still alive...to take me and to help me and to harbor me. He lived with his mother,\nsister-in-law and a baby and he said he will help me and he told me that he helped ten\nother, other Jewish girls. I will tell you what happened, or maybe I should tell you right\nnow. I was the only one who who didn't blend into the Slavic population because I don't\nhave the high Slavic cheekbones and my eyes were considered very Semitic. The other\ngirls were all typical so-called Aryan looks, blonde, blue eyes and from the eleven, I am\nthe only one who survived. Because I knew that I don't look Slavic, I could pass\nsomehow as a German girl so I was advised to work in the lion's den so I worked for\nGerman companies. I will explain later what I have done, and they were so sure that they\nwould not be recognized so they worked in Polish companies and normally they were\nbeautiful. They were approached by Poles to date, and when they refused...maybe they\nsaid it jokingly...you must be a Jewish...and the sudden fear in their eyes gave them out\nand the Poles denounced them. I was the only one. So one day he propo...offered me this\nwhile still my father was alive. But he told me that he cannot harbor my father. When my\nfather was gone, I waited three weeks. I didn't hear from him, so I thought he didn't\nsucceed to jump from the running train and poor one (ph), he was killed. So one day he\ncame and he told me according to my information, they will...they last two thousand Jews\nwho were left at ghetto from one time hundred thousand Jews, we were forty thousand\nJews and they used to bring in Jews from small towns and villages. What, at one time we\nwere a hundred. Only two thousand remained. So he told me that from here's information\nthat now they will finish us all off, and he would advise me not to go back to go back\nwith the column of slave workers, back to the ghetto...only after work, he will arrange\nthat I will be able to stay in the office on the railroad and the next day after work will\ndispose of my and to go to with him to .",
        "Q: We have to stop here. We need to change the tape.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: OK. We're rolling.",
        "A: So Edmund Abraham Ovitch, he told me to stay, that I shouldn't go back, and I slept on\nthe railroad station in the office of the Chief . After the War, I found out how he\narranged it, and this proved to me how sincere and honest he is, that he really wants to\nsave my life and after work I dropped my arm band with my star carelessly on the tracks\nbecause if they would find it they would search for the one who threw it away, and I\nboarded the train to , half hour ride. But I didn't want to sit next to Mundig\nbecause I felt if I'm caught, why should he loose his life. So I sat by myself and there\nwere workers, maybe about thirty, coming back from work. They all knew me because if\nI should present it because like all white and one . | was there with the arm\nband so they saw me everyday so they knew me, and like in every train the police came\nand the German police came. On every train was a Gestapo police, checked the\npassengers. When I...before they were supposed to approach me I must have been in\nterrible fear. I can't explain why the workers gave me a sign with their eyes not to fear,\nthat they will not give me away. Where they were so eager to denounce others, I was\ndestined to live. And the police came. I didn't have any papers. I was afraid, but the\nGerman police sat next to me and discussed the weather, how beautiful it is, and he left.\nSo safely I arrived to Mundig's house. His mother was very upset. I don't blame her,\nbecause I endangered her and the whole family. On top of it without any reward. I didn't\nhave even money to pay for it. She resented and she made it clear to me, so the son\npromised her that whenever he can find for me a safe haven, I will leave. As a matter of\nface, even she refused me the meals. Again I don't blame because it was very hard to get\nfood, so the son, to make sure that I am eating, demanded that I should eat with him the\ndinner together. But I would like to go back to a few scenes in the ghetto that I omitted. I\nthink it's very important. You see, the Germans, when their wives came to visit them\nfrom Germany, their pleasure was to show the ghetto like we'll be animals in the zoo and\nthey used to take them and parade them through the main streets. So one day parading\nthem and looking at them, at us Jews like animals, one Jew...I forgot his last\nname...Joseph...by the way, he's alive...he's now in the United States...when they were\ngaping at us, he spate on the Germans and run away. Immediately the Gestapo came to\nthe Juden___ and they gave, and at that time the president of Juden____\u2014 was Goldstein,\nand he gave an order to line up uh the Jewish orderlings (ph), means the Jewish police,\nand every ten was singled out to step out and he was hanged, but he needed the rope to\nhang them, so he said first that the Juden , the president should decide which ones\nwill step out. He said I cannot do it, Mr. Goldstein said. I'm not God. I will not do it. He\nshould bring rope. He didn't want to bring rope, so they sent somebody else and they\nhanged the head of the Juden , Mr. Goldstein with every ten police...uh Jewish\npolice. One of them married my schoolmate, Eddie Fraley (ph), and he, when they\nhanged him, the rope broke down and he escaped. They let him escape because they\nthought that they will get him another time. But they didn't and actually he escaped from\nghetto. He looked very much like a gentile. He escaped to Warsaw and in Warsaw he was\none of the chief officers from the underground . He survived with my schoolmate.\nThey live now in Florida. The second incident was....",
        "Q: How many were killed altogether?",
        "A: Hundred (ph), and they were hanging. This wasn't over for the whole week, for everyone\nin ghetto to see it. The poor because it was a friend or a relative, and the stench...1f we do\nsomething, you know, to show us they punish. Not enough that they were shooting us.\nThey were hanging...after a a week, they removed them, and you know, they couldn't find\nthe commandant, uh a Jew to be a commandant of the police. They wanted a hi...a Polish\nofficer. They wanted that he should have been a pol...an army officer, so they brought a\nKariate from , whose family was in . In ghetto they gave him a Jewish\nname, uh a Mr. , and after that he left by train back to his family. He joined his\nfamily. This also I found out after I escaped from ghetto from, uh from Mundig I called\nhim, this Abraham Mundig, Abraham Ovitch. He told me about it. Now when we were in\nghetto, and I was left alone and it was cold...I didn't have any firewood. Some of our\nfurniture was in uh in a shack, so I took a chair and I wanted with a hammer to break into\nfirewood but I wasn't handy so I just had to break it. I cut myself next to my ankle and I\nwas bleeding. Later sets uh set in puss (ph) but I couldn't do anything because no doctors,\nno medication and this how I walked. Again, why I didn't die on gangrene and when it\nwas cured, it's again a question. So coming back to Mundig, being I was persona non\ngratia, parents didn't want...my...uh his mother didn't want me, I couldn't stay there. So I I\ntold Mundig...that uh I cannot stay there, so he found me a place to hide by a Ukrainian\npeasant. Ukrainian peasant had beautiful daughter. A lot of Ukrainian militiamen used to\ncome to visit her, and every time I had to run in the attic and to hide between the hay, and\nI said this is not the life for me. I don't want to be hidden there. But while, while I was in\na month later, Edmund Abraham Ovitch told me have to tell you some very sad.\nAnd brace yourself. Your father jumped from the cattle car by prying off the boards from\nthe floor of the cattle car, although they were pressed like sardines, and he lifted the\nboard and he asked who would like to jump with him, because more than that cannot be\nto let themselves down from the running train and run for their life. Only one girl...she\nwas from ...1 don't know her name...my age...wanted to go with my father. I\nguess the rest didn't want to separate. Sometimes there were families together. They\nwanted to die together. My father let themselves down. He got only bruised knees. The\ngirl was not harmed at all. He walked to our village, which was half-hour walking\ndistance where I was in and he entered a Ukrainian peasant's house. There was\nonly a woman. Her husband was still in the Russian army. She...1t was harvest time. She\nneeded field hands. Without questioning my father, she took in my father and the girl, the\ngirl posing as a daughter of my father. He tried to get in touch with me. He couldn't. He\ndidn't get any response. He couldn't live with the thought that his sheltered daughter 1s\nalone in the ghetto. He decided to board the train which is certain death penalty for any\nJew who boarded the train, to go back to ghetto to look for me. On the train was an\narchitect, a Ukrainian who used to buy lumber from my father, who was wined and dined\nin our house. Without any reward he went to the Gestapo...each train I told you was a\nand a Gestapo...and said I know this man. This is Dabbie Petranka. He's a Jew.\nThey took him off the train. They brought him to the mill on where they gathered\nthe Jews already to be shipped to the death camp. My father probably tried to get in touch\nwith me, but I was not there. So I'm alive, but my father was killed. (crying) So this 1s my\nstory. So when I didn't want to stay by the farm, by Ukrainian farmer, Mundig said to me,\nI'll get you a false labor certificate. You should have some document. His friend, a big\nanti-Semite that off-hand I don't remember his name...in my book that I am writing which\nwill be published in November...I, at that time I still remembered. I don't remember now.\nI know only that he was a student, second gymnasium which was known for the biggest\nanti-Semites. He was the director of , scrap iron (ph) and it was very important\nduring the War because they needed it, so he gave me a certificate that I'm employed in\nhis company under assumed name. Now I had to choose my name. My actually name was\nAmalia Petrankia but I'm not Jewish and not German, but everything was very important\nto be able to blend into the population. First impression's very important. My \"r\" is a\nFrench and German, but not a Slavic, and this was very dangerous, so I picked the name\nFelicita (ph) which means in Latin black, felicita and I picked the name of\nMewycheski who was my beloved uh writer. You see we didn't have heros baseball,\nbasketball, ballerinas...we had writers, and she was from Vilna (ph) so he put...he made a\ncertificate that I am Mewycheski, Felicita. I was careful to keep my birthdate, because\nwhen you are under stress, this is the first thing that you forget...dates...and I gave my\nreal...only my birthplace was Vilna, and now I became Felicita Mewycheski. With this,\nMundig took me to where I thought being it's a big city, metropolitan city, I will\nbe able to get lost there. He took me to his cousin's, first cousin's apartment which was\njust a studio apartment. Turn out his cousin was the king of the black market, the king of\nthe underworld. And they had only two beds. This was a terrible experience at that time\nfor me, a sheltered child. He slept with his mattress...uh mistress on one. I was supposed\nto sleep with Edmund on the other, and there were terrible, provocative remarks from\nhim. Mundig understood it's not for me, so he found me a place in a hostel...this\nwas...you see wives of Polish officers unable to be able to sustain themselves...they\nrented one room where they put beds, and this is where Poles who traveled slept because\nthe hotels were only for Germans. How little did I know that this is the day when they're\nclosing the ghetto in and they were searching in every hotel and hostel for Jews\nwho may have escaped from the ghetto. And after the curfew...the curfew was ten\no'clock...two Ukrainian police are coming to this woman's house and they with\nflashlight...you know...putting into our eyes, questioning everyone. They started with the\ntwo Polish girls but he didn't have any doubt that they are Christians. They let them go.\nThere's a woman with a child and I was there. One Ukrainian was busy with this woman\nand the child. I overheard...she had baptismal papers but from '37. She was a wife of a\nChristian judge, but she was converted, so they considered her Jewish because it was '37\nand they took her away with the little girl who was born already a Christian. The one\nUkrainian asked me questions. He said you are Jewish. Prove to me you are not. I, a\nproduct of Hebrew kindergarten, Hebrew schools, Jewish gymnasium...on top of it we\nhad a maid, a Jewish orphan...so I was never exposed to and all this. I didn't\nknow anything. I failed. So he told me to get dressed and he's bringing me to the Gestapo.\nOn the way he tried to persuade me that, to admit that I am Jewish and he will let me go.\nHow could I trust him? I thought he wants to have an easy job and to come, she admit it\nand, you know if somebody escaped from ghetto was even worse punishment...they used\nto let the dogs to tear them to pieces or they used to bill uh beat up to pulp. It was a\nterrible death, so when finally I reached the building, the steps of the Gestapo building, I\ndidn't have what to loose. So I said OK. And then I became very arrogant. You know,\nJude (ph)... was what, eighteen years old...I said go ahead...you spilled a lot of Jewish\nblood you have on your hands. There's a saying in Polish...go ahead...go...tell them I'm\nJewish. Kill me. He looked at me and start calling me with strong epithets, insulting me,\nand he said to me, go. I thought he was joking. He said go, but I don't want to see you\nanymore in because if I recognize you, I'll shoot you myself. How did I have the\nguts? I don't know. To go after curfew so another one will get me. I said how can I go?\nHe said, OK...what do you want now...and yelling...I said you should bring me back to\nthe hostel. He said no, I'll bring you back to the railroad station and disappear. At that\nti...at the railroad station was a lot of police. A lot of police, looking for for Jews and for\nblack marketeers so imagine - it was so dangerous for me. How I survived the night...it's\nanother miracle. In the morning I went to the woman where my belongings were there\nand at this hostel and I said you see, I'm not Jewish. They let me go. She said I don't care\nif you are or not. Take your things and get out. So . Where do I go? So I\ndecided to go to Krakow. This is one corner of Poland to another corner of Poland and in\nKrakow, this who was my father's boss, lived with his wife and a\ndaughter. They was very good friends of my parents...even they were invited to the\nwedding of my older sister, and I thought so I don't know if they will extend their help or\nhand and help me but somehow I felt they will not give me away. And being he was an\naristocratic family, I knew they would be in the telephone book. I will find them. In order\nto go to Krakow...we didn't have straight connections...I had to go to a city . L was\nlittle...how little I knew... was very important for Jews who try to escape to\nHungary, so there was a lot of police. I arrived. A lot of police. Past curfew. I couldn't\nsleep on the station. What do I do? There was a girl who had a newspaper stand. I\napproached her. I started conversation. She liked me, and I said look, what should I do? I\ndon't want to live on this station...like it's inconvenience, not that it was dangerous for\nme. And what should I do? She said you know what. Soon I'll finish my work. I live next\nto the station. I will take you for the night. I was so grateful. She didn't suspect. I slept\nthere. In the morning, I'm on the station. A young man, very well dressed _is\nfollowing me. Well, I didn't like, everybody, you know, took off their hat to him. He was\ntoo young to be so prominent, so at uh I got idea I will go to the ladies room. No\nman would dare to follow me there. I'm in the ladies room...I see his shoes in the main\nhall where each compartment is. I knew I'm finished. So I come out on the aggressive\nside, and I said how did you dare to follow me. Imagine what guts I had. How did you\ndare to...what kind of upbringing do you have? This put him in the defense and he was\nshocked. He didn't expect. He thought he'll find me timid with fear. So he questioned me\nand I told him...I said I will tell you my name and I'll introduce myself if you, you'll\nintroduce yourself to me first. Who are you? I said I have an aunt who is very sick in\nKrakow. I want to go to her to help her. He obtained for me the ticket railroad\nticket. Was a long line and he sitted me in his compartment like he would feel guilty that\nmaybe I suspect that he's police and he wanted to cover up for me. I took the train. We\nhad to pass through Tarnow (ph). Tarnow again police, and they light the flashlight into\nyou eye, and the fear in my eyes and the Gestapo man said to me, why is your voice\nshivering so much. And he saw the fear in my eyes. What could I say? I'm able if I don't\nunderstand German because you see mostly only Germ...Jews understood German.\nMostly Poles from the knew French but not so well German. Through\ninterpreter I said I wonder if you two will travel forty-eight hours, if you wouldn't be\ntired, if your voice would not shiver. He took it. He left so the Polish woman who sit next\nto me, she said, you know what. He took you for a Jew, she's telling me. And this was\none. Again another episode. I arrived in Krakow. At that time on the railroad station, I\nsaw a lot of Polish police and a Gestapo with the dog. But they were not searching for\nJews anymore. They are looking for Poles without valid, valid Polish working papers.\nMeans papers that they won't, don't work for the war, German war industry. The Polish\npolice recognized me immediately and they approached me, and they said you are\nJewish. What you are doing here? So naturally I was on the defense. I said how do you\ndare to insult me? Why do you do it to me? He said OK. If you are not Jewish...he started\nto again to question me from their New Testament. I failed. So they marked me and they\nsaid hah. He will finish you off, pointing to the Gestapo. I was resigned. I said my\nIsrael. I felt so alive, and I said OK. So I tried. But if not, I will join you and my parents\nand my sister. Enough is enough. You know, I felt like this. I felt light*hearted. I accepted\nit, and my feet were like glued to the ground. The Gestapo man checked all other papers,\nthen my turn came and the Polish police told him that I'm a Jewish, a Jewess. I had a bag\nin my hand. He requested...he took....told the police to hand him over the bag. He looked\nin the bag. I don't know what he looked for. He looked me up and down and he said to\nme why I came to Krakow. I told the same story. I'm a poor girl. My aunt is very sick.\nShe lives in Krakow. She sent for me. Through interpreter naturally. Where does she\nlive? I have never...I never was in Krakow, but like here, every time almost has\nBroadway. I said the street , which 1s after very famous Polish writer. You\nknow, he said . Means go. I didn't believe my ears. And I couldn't. You know,\nwhen a person is so resigned...I was ready to get uh you know, a shot...to be shot from the\nback. I said OK. He wants me to move, andhe_ ___ sent off the dog in the back who will\ntear me to pieces. I just couldn't do it. So the police, police said fall to his feet. Kiss his\nfeet. He let you go. I, we don't know why, in Polish. And like a robot I start moving till I\nleft the railroad station. I didn't believe that I will leave it alive. Why he let me go I don't\nknow. When I left the station, now where should I go now? It was Christmas Eve. So\ninquired about some...again a boarding house, a hostel who will take me. And I was told\none _ has aroom where he rents beds. He gave me the address. I came there and the\nsaid you see all beds are taken unless somebody offers to take you in, which with a\nsardonic smile, vulgar smile. And there was a woman, little older than I. I noticed the hair\nwas re...painted red, not her natural, with dark eyes. And she offered to take me into her\nbed. Immediately she recognized me that I'm Jewish and I recognize her. It turned out she\nwas a seamstress from Lublin (ph) who escaped and now she tried her luck as a gentile.\nWhat the night was terrible. You know what was going on on other beds? I had\nwonderful school of life (ph). She gave me a sign not to talk. Only when we were in the\npark we spoke. I told her who I am and she told me...she shared with me the bread that\nshe bought on the black market and I told her I am...the only chance I have...let me look\nup . We went to the telephone book. I found his address. I came over\nthere. His wife, Kashimira (ph), opened the door. When she saw me, she couldn't believe\nher eyes. She thought it's a ghost, and she closed the door. Then she opened it again and\nshe pulled me in, and I said I am Amalia Petranka, David's daughter. She started to cry.\nShe embraced me and she said look, I didn't recognize you. Let's see if my husband will\nrecognize you. If he doesn't, so maybe we can harbor you for a while till we'll find\nsomething for you. Her husband came. He didn't recognize me. She told him who I am.\nSo he said, I hate Jews, but for the daughter of David Petranka, I'll do every thing. Let's\nsee what we can do for her. Now this was the high life of Krakow. Every night bridge,\ndifferent companies, and being she was Armenian...again the Germans considered her a\nforeigner and she lived in a beautiful German neighborhood, so she had two little girls\nand she had a maid. She said to me you'll sleep with the girls and you'll...I'll tell the maids\nthat you are the new governess for the children, and I stayed for three weeks. And they\nfound for me in the newspaper a job as a housemaid to a , to Germans who\nhad children. And she gave me advice, to work for Germans because this is safer and they\nwill not recognize me. I got the job. The Germans liked me because they got a maid, you\nknow, from...a peasant girl who didn't understand German. I was very helpful. They\ntreated me quite good. They thought that I am Polish. And I developed here\n. It was abscessed with puss. So the Germans said it's not proper. We'll\nbring you to the hospital. I am a Jew, no papers. How could they enter a hospital, and I\ndidn't have uh the social card from uh from here like Medicare or some...I didn't have\nanything. But he was a big shot. He arranged. They accepted me. How little I knew.\nBefore the operation, a priest comes for confession. I didn't know how and what. So he\nstarted talking. So he said I see you're from the same town that I am. You're from\nLandberg (ph) and I am special accent in Polish. So he said how about...and now he\nwanted I should confess. I said, Father, how about if you'll sing for me a song, a very\nfamous song just from Landberg. This changed the mood, and he did. But I was afraid\nafter I will wake up or during when they give me anesthesia, I may spill who I am\nbecause usually what you do. I spotted a nurse who looked to me Jewish and I said look,\nplease, watch over me. Protect me. Why, she said. Because I'm Jewish and you're Jewish.\nNot I'm not Jewish. I said I don't care. Help me. And I showed her my leg, which was\nalready with gangrene and I developed lice last day in ghetto and I couldn't get rid of it. I\nsaid help me. And she did help. So she wouldn't do it if she wouldn't be Jewish\nmasquerading. And also, imagine how you can control your mind. Before even I woke\nup, they looked for my nightgown and I was able to point where it is hanging. Meantime,\nEdmund came to visit me. There, next bed to me was laying a Polish peasant girl by the\n. She liked me. She worked for a German casino. Means they were\nemployees, bookkeepers, everything for oil, from the oil company sent from\nGermany. Because they were by themselves, they had a casino, like a club where they\nlived, dined and then they went to the office. I said Kashimira, can you get me a job\nthere. I thought if it's a German place, the Polish police doesn't have any access. Where\nthey used to comb the houses in Polish sections searching for Jews and I will have some\nsecurity and a roof over my head. And one day a girl by the name Katia (ph)...I forgot her\nlast name...came to visit Kashia, so this . Kashia said, you know what. You're like\neach other. I notice you are educated. She's educated. You're alike. She's Ukrainian.\nKashia started talking to me. She recognized immediately that I am Jewish and I\nrecognized that she's Jewish, so she started, tried to stay away. So this chambermaid\nKashia said to me, I thought you liked each other. How come you dislike each other? I\ncouldn't tell her. We came to the casino. She obtained for me the job and I started as a\nchambermaid. I had to clean eight rooms, to kindle their fire and for this I have...she took\nme into their room and this, how I could stay and was safer. One day this Katia Ukrainian\ncomes to me and she says look...at that time she had a job as the chief manager of the\nkitchen, which was wonderful because she got food. She...and because of it she got a\nroom for herself. She said come to me. I want to discuss with you something. I said OK\nKatia, what is it. I came to her. She said look, you are Jewish. I am Jewish, and there is\nanother Jewish girl, Soshia (ph) who doesn't sleep in the casino. She sleeps outside but its\nvery dangerous for us. Because you are the last one, you are the one who has to leave.\nAnd she told me she was a medical student in Lamburg (ph). She comes from the\nand her husband's friends who who was a communist and was presently in Russia, gave\nher the paper as Ukrainian, a Ukrainian, and this is how she's surviving. So I said Katia,\nyou're right. By right I should leave, but I don't have a scrape of paper. Let me get some\ndocuments and I promise you that I will leave, but again when you have to do with nice\npeople, when Soshia who was the daughter of a lawyer from Lamburg, a little bit older\nthan I...she said I'm staying anyhow outside the theat...uh casino. I will go first. And then\nmy boss came to me and he says, he said you know, how comes you don't have an ID.\nHow come Anna cannot feed you because not having an ID you don't have any ration\ncards? So I had to apply. I wrote a letter to Mundig and I said I need baptismal papers\nbecause this is how you applied for ID. Dear Mundig, bless his sole...he went to a\nUkrainian priest, Catholic priest. So I got my baptismal paper. I'm Roman Catholic, but\nthe baptismal paper, the stamp was for Ukrainian church, Orthodox church. When I gave\nthe application to the police, they came looking for me. Who am I? What a contradiction.\nAnd they call it in the German and they summoned me to the police. Now I was\nthinking what can I do. Not to report to police means I have to run. Where do I run again\nwithout papers. To report, they will catch me and I'm gone. So then he said...I looked\nvery young, younger for my age than I was. I was always very petite. I had two braids\nand I prayed to God, the woman who'll investigate me should me an old maid or old man.\nSomehow they had some compassion for children, for young people. And I came there\nand she saw me...she said you know what, your priest got drunk. Look what the nonsense\nhe wrote. Write for another baptismal paper. But not I'm at fault, only this. I have done it,\nso Mundig sent me another with the stamp Roman Catholic and this I got legitimate ID\nfrom the police which meant a lot. No money could buy it, because this, you know, the\nfirst thing when they caught a Jew, they checked with the police, then they check with the\nparish, so I was...because of it I was able to get a labor card and I was able to rep...get a\ncard, you know, from uh , you know, to get health, health care. And I worked\nthere. While I worked there, meantime came the Jewess from Lublin who helped me. She\nlearned I'm there, and she cried...she doesn't have a piece of paper and they're\nsearching...she worked, she worked for a seamstress who gladly kept her for food for her\nlabor. But she didn't have any paper. Nothing can get . I give her my piece of\npaper. Not the ID still didn't have. Only Felecita Mewychesk1. Luckily this wasn't the\ntime of computers because immediately we both would be caught, but I didn't think about\nit. | knew I have to save her. When you're young, you don't think. And in casino, 1n this\nwas one . His mother was Jewish descendent. His grandfather was Jewish.\n. He recognized me immediately, and one day he told me I'll have to report to\nhis room. I said I don't have to report because Poles were forbidden to socialize with\nGermans. He insisted with a threatening voice. I knew I don't have a choice. I came up.\nHe presented me with a pic...a picture, a photo of a Jew and he said to me, this is\nmy grandfather. I thought he wants to provoke me. I thought he is from the Gestapo\nbecause each unit has also each office. I said what do you want for my life? If you know\nI'm Jewish, why didn't you report me to the Gestapo. He says cut it out. I want to help\nyou. I want to save you. First of all, you cannot work here. You don't blend in. You're not\na chambermaid with the coarse white features and everything. You must get out. I said\nhow can I get out. I need a roof. It was hard to get a room, and even...and I need a job.\nAnd no job will pay me for be able to pay rent and to sustain myself. He said don't worry.\nI will see what I can do for you. He knew an architect, a very big engineer from the\nrailroad authority, , ., Whose brother was the Commandant of\nBerlin while Hitler was shot there. The Chief Commandant. He spoke to him. He said,\nyou know many construction firms. I would like you to find a job for my fri...my Polish\nwho uh Polish acquaintance who is working in this place where I am now, and he\nobtained for me a job in a construction firm, but while I was in casino, they decided, you\nknow, the director of the casino was a a a brother of the secretary of Hans Frank and the\ncastle in Krakow. And he used to get his meals from the casino. I was the one\nselected to bring the meals, but to enter it I was checked and double checked and\neverything. I didn't have the papers. I couldn't get out of it. I didn't know what to do.\nLuckily, with this scrap of paper...before I had my ID, they let me through and I used to\nbring the meals to the castle. Imagine. With all the police guarding and everything, so he\nfound for me a job and , aconstruction firm which was located in\nand employed slave workers from __, Jews. And I...when I worked there, I\nsaid my goodness. I'm open now. I...maybe I can help the Jews by supplying them bread,\nmaybe potato. So I asked my boss, Wilhelm Langerd (ph) if he will permit me to go with\nhim on the , means where they were working there, not in the office, and just to\nsee how it's going on. He thought that I'm going for the gold, because he used to get gold\nfrom the Jews who were able to buy out their way not to work so hard only in the office.\nAnd one day he was in good mood and he took me to the office. I came there. The\nsecretary was Doctor Leibermann (ph). He was a ref...a German Jew who was\n. He introduced me. This is our secretary, Felecita Mewycheski and Dr.\nLeibermann looking at me said, you know what. Our secretary looks complete like my\nsister-in-law. So I couldn't go there any more, and the door door was closed for me.\nWhile I was working there they brought Czech and Slavic Jews in the cattle cars,\nto Auschwitz. I...the office was on a hill. Down were the cattle cars. How I as a Jewess\ncould take the screams and the cries for water. I was in the office. At that time was also in\nthe office a Polish mining engineer. He was a terrible anti-Semite and I took a pail filled\nup with water and went down to hand the water to the uh...they had the little windows\nwhich were . They were guarded by Ukrainian police with the bayonets. The\npolice approached me and said what, do you want to be killed to and threw the water.\nWith a broken heart I went up to the office and the mining engineer, with this smirk on\nhis face tells me...Miss Felecita, what will you be after the war? Then I knew he\nrecognized. I played dumb and I told him how do I know who I'll be. How do I know\nwhom I'll marry after the war, but I have to go ahead of time, after the war, when the war\nended, on the bus stop where I used to board my bus...here was standing\n, the engineer. I knew it. He comes over to me. He said, Miss Felecita. I\nrecognize you. At that time you gave yourself away, but I didn't have the heart to give\nyou away. I hated Jews, but I didn't have the heart to give you away. Another incident.\nWell, when I was working for this Wilhelm Langerd, I was masquerading as Miss\nFelecita Mewycheski. Ins was. a very elegant family, a widow and a sister by the\nname mewycheski, to whose house used to come my boss, the Nazi, the German, Mr.\nWilhelm Langerd, and she, hearing that this Mewycheski must be family, insisted on\nmeeting me. When finally I couldn't avoid it, I went there. Sure enough that she will\nrecognize and it's my aunt. I came over there. She pulled me all my face on all sides and\nthere she looked at me and she asked me who I am and I had a story that I prepared who\nmy father and so what, and she said you know you are not from the main line. You must\nbe from the branch of Mewycheskis in Lamberg and insisted that I should move in,\nbecause she felt responsible for a young girl to live on her own. Miracle again. Another\nmiracle. Well works till there by Mr. Langerd, the company paid five per\ncapita for every Jew for slave work to the Gestapo. In was Gestapo Miller (ph), a\nknown sadist. Tall, slim. With a stick in his hand he used to walk, and at at will, at\nrandom he used to kill, shoot at the Jews who were in ghetto, in . | heard of him.\nOne day whom do I see in the frame of the por...of the door - it was him. Then I had to\nthink fast. Did he come for me? No. He's too big to come for me. He could have sent\nsomebody else, but I couldn't take off my eyes from the two German Shepherds. They\nwere terrible. They were known that used to just to tear up Jews to pieces, so my eyes\nwere glued. He approached the desk, and he said, you don't have to fear. My dogs will\nsmell a Jew a mile away. So means you are not a Jew. What luck. And then he stated the\nreason why he came here. Another. I was never a secretary. I took humanities. I was\nsupposed to study medicine. I didn't know any secretarial work. When this that\ncommanded me to this guy, he told him. After a month my boss told me, you know what.\nI admire you. How come you grasp so fast, like a Jewess. Another incident. One day he\ntells me, how come that you have such Semitic eyes. What answer do I give him? To\ndeny? I will blush. I'll give myself away. Said, was probably nonchalantly, probably my\ngrandmother was a Jew. No one would admit because till third generation they were\nconsidered Jews. He thought that it was such a joke. He burst out laughing. This was only\nincident in one place. Why I bring them out...we are accused that you went by ship\nto Florida. It's not true. But there were many incidents and you had to be lucky not to be\ncaught, or killed because I was caught many times. Not to be killed. One more would\nhave, I would have been killed. Another one. When the Russians were moving close, the\nfront, they didn't have enough...the German soldiers. Many who built for war in say like\nthe bridges, railroad, toward the Russian front were excused for active service in German\narmy. Towards the end they needed everybody. So they also were drafted the workers,\nthe German who worked for company as carpenters and other jobs. So my boss\nsent me , which was a part of Gestapo, to excuse them for army service. I\ntold to my boss, how can I do it? Iam a Pole. They are not permitted to go there. Why do\nyou send me? He said, I give you order. You have to do it. Having no choice, I went. The\nGestapo at the desk greeted me with a heil Hitler. I was careful. I answered, .\nPoles were not supposed to say heil Hitler. I explained to him the reason of my coming. I\nproduced the papers. He took care of it, positively, and when I was supposed to leave,\nagain I said . And he said heil Hitler and he called me back. And he said, why\ndon't you say heil Hitler. Aren't you good enough to say heil Hitler? I said, I I said in\nGerman, I am not supposed to. What do you mean you're not supposed to? I said Iam a\nPole. He got so angry. He took the telephone and called up my boss. How did you dare to\nsend a Pole on such a sensitive mission. Another incident. There's another one. Railroad\nauthority had a big ball, and they wanted...the one of the chief ones whose wife was in\nGermany, asked my boss if I will be his company...companion. I tried to get out of it,\nbecause it was very dangerous and I was not supposed to socialize with Germans, and if I\nwould be caught, it's terrible. As a Pole and on top of as a Jewess. So I said to my boss I\nwill only go if you will tell him the truth, that Iam not ethnic German but I am a Pole,\nand if he wants to take the risks, because as well as for the Germans, if they are caught\nthey were sent to the Russian front. Then I will agree to go. I don't know why he did\nagree. I came to the ball. I didn't have what to wear. I had a black woolen dress with a\nvelvet rose here and I told him I can go only if you'll be a gentleman...when I feel very\nuncomfortable that you will take me home immediately. He agreed. There were\ncheckpoints. They checked but such a big shot, they didn't and say anything. I didn't\nknow that Frank, General Frank was inviting the also to this affair. You know,\nthe big shot, the . When he came, they all rise up and they introduced their\npartners. And this uh engineer, ... he was a very high official by the name I think\nBrown, introduced me as a par , you know, from this Baltic, from Lithuanian and\nso because knows what Lithuania. Frank looked at me and he said,\n. You know, and even if you don't get complimented directly to a\nperson, only . Means he picked the rose, and he said . Stupid me, my\nage, I said why only rose. Why not , means this...I . I guess he\ngot very impressed. He made a toast. I wish all the German girls will be like the\n. And I realized I went too far. I blushed, but this was accepted. Modesty.\nAnd I turned to my escort and I said I must leave. I'm not comfortable. Those are the\nincidents. There are many others. Towards...I then, when they evacuated I didn't want to\ngo with the firm to , | was assigned to , a tough organization. They used to\nbuild the ditches. Another incident. And every Pole had to give a week work for nothing.\nOne day my boss tells me there will come a watchmaker. He will give you two\nwatches. One for me. One for you. And you will excuse him for digging the ditches. The\nday comes. The man comes in. Who is the man? Anti-Semite Pole from , whom\nthe government transferred to Stanistlawow to Polanize it, who had a jewelry store street\nacross the street from me. When I saw it I bent down double, make believe that I have\ncramps and I run out. I waited till he's out. Then I come in and my boss said to me,\nnow because of you I lost my watch, because he didn't he didn't want to accept himself.\nThis was so so many incidents. There was____ recognize how I got away I really can not\ntell you. This is when I was in . Then I got a job and now I think I'll need to\nend because I don't think we have enough time. There was another construction firm\nwhich didn't evacuate. This is the construction firm of and Krause (ph). There I\nbecame a personal secretary to the boss, , who was Yugoslavian and the son-in-\nlaw of one of the owners of and Krause, . How little I knew that the\nfirm was assigned to build the barricades in Krakow to slow down the Russian approach\nand also to destroy historical buildings from Krackow and all the bunkers around the\nGerman buildings because this was after the Warsaw uprise from the Poles and they\nexpected it in Krakow. When the wasn't and ha...they had to evacuate back to\nVienna, he wanted to take me along. I said no, my place is my motherland, Poland, and I\nstay on. So he said...and then in that case I make you...I put you in charge of the office.\nThis was in middle of December and till we were combatively uh pushed away the\nRussian army will come back in March. Meantime here's the key from the safe and here\nare the checks for the employees and you pay...pay them out, and you should expect call,\na phone call for from some important papers. Didn't specify, didn't tell and I didn't know.\nAround...I think the thirteenth or tenth of January, when the German army was\ncompletely in retreat, I get a phone call from the Commandant from\nKrakow...means the high uh Commandant of the military uh military in Krakow, and he\nsaid is this the firm and Krause. I said yavol (ph). . Means dynamite\nthe . | put two and two together, and I understood it. And then I was thinking.\nWhat should I do? Had I been a German, I would have said my company evacuated and\nyou have to do it. I said what will happen to me if I fail to tell him...by this I would save\nthe Krakow from really being destroyed but I didn't survive now the war to loose my life.\nBut then I thought no...he didn't ask me for my name. He just said the company, and the\ncompany was still left...the daughter-in-law of the owner of the building who was the\nhostess of the company, the custodian and two chambermaids. I would never admit\nreceiving the phone call, and I called up the Polish underground which I joined while I\nwas a chambermaid under request of Kashimira uh and my link was ;\nAnd I gave them the message, happy knowing this is the end of the war. Two days later,\nsome Polish officers knocked at the gate of the building and this is while the German\narmy was in retreat, while they were bombings and even uh bombs uh uh hit one of the\nrooms...and I told the custodian and the Polish woman, I said let's not open the gates\nbecause it will be a chaos. This is a building where German companies were there. Many\nPoles will be free to plunder and our lives will be in danger till we explain who we are.\nAnd they listened. And then again I see another group of officers, knocked at the door\nand looking out the window I recognized one of the officers is definitely a Jew, so I\nthought from this quarter cannot come any danger to me, and I told the custodian to let\nthem in. They came in and among them was my husband...my present husband, but he\nwas in civil clothes and a leather coat...somehow he just likes me the most and started\nquestioning me angrily and harshly. I decided I'm not going to reveal him\nnow, with the armies in retreat. I have witnesses here, the custodian, the chambermaids.\nMaybe they will come back and I will be shot, so I refused to answer his questions and I\ntold him if you have any doubt who I am, please...here's my ID I took out and if not take\nme to your superior. My husband said I am the superior and you answer to me. I said no,\nI'm not taking any chances. I don't have to deal now with such anti-Semites now when the\nwar is toward the end, and I approach the officer who looked Jewish. I said do you mind\nto step in with me to the other room. I want to talk to you. Coming in to the other room,\nhe asked me who are you. I said I am the same thing who who you are. What do you\nmean? You are Jewish and I'm Jewish. He said how do you know it. In Polish it's a\nsaying...look at your face. From where are you? I said from Stanistlawow. From where\nare you? From Krakow. So he tells me....and from Krackow. I told him I had a\nschoolmate in Jewish gymnasium by the name of . By any chance do you\nknow this family? He paled. It was his first cousin. Jubilant, he comes back to the room,\napproaches my husband and says to leave her alone. Not only that she is not German,\nbecause they thought I'm German...not only she's not Polish, she's Jewish. So my husband\nwas sure that knowing him as a womanizer that probably I promised something all done\nand now he tries to protect me. So he moved closer to me, my husband, and he told me,\ndo you know any other language. I said yes. What other language do you know? I said uh\nEnglish, German, Russian, and I still didn't say Hebrew. Any other language? So he start\nasking me in English, what little English he know. What nation are you? I said I'm\nJewish. Prove it to me. How can I prove? So he said do you know Hebrew? I said yes.\nSpeak to me. I got so mad. I said, ; . So he couldn't believe.\nHe said how come this young girl can speak so well the Hebrew. Was probably the\nGermans who taught her Hebrew...she should spy on the Jews and get them out. Imagine.\nSo then he asked me when do we say . When he asked me about 1\nunderstood he's Jewish too. Excited with tears in my eyes, I said to him, you too? So\nnaturally then he knew. He switched back to Polish and from then he stated the purpose\nof his coming...that he came, they found out this is the company that build the barricades\nand built the columns and he wants the plans because he knows I was the secretary and I\nmust have it...the office in the building. I should give him to save the city because must\nbe a key how to detonate and how to neutralize it. I said why didn't you say it from the\nfirst place.",
        "Q: Now we have to change tapes.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "A: So, then I told my husband, be my guest. You know, then I was really very light and very\nhappy and I invited him to go across the uh stairs, stairway because this is where the\noffice was. I opened the safe and I handed him the papers and he asked me who I am,\nwhat's my name. I told him who I am and then I asked him...first I told him Felecita\nMewycheski. He said no. Tell me the real name. My real name is Amalia Petranka and he\nsaid...told...gave me his real name and then he said, isn't this ironic that you, a Jewish\ngirl, were able...was instrumental in saving the city from destruction. I gave him the plans\nand since then we started dating and later...[ mean now we are married but I would like to\nadd a few more things, very important...how people in face of death and misery, still how\nthey were good and honest. My fia...Alec, who was my fiance, he applied for medical\nschool in Poland but they didn't want to accept him on and when the war broke\nout, when the Russians came, he got a job as a bookkeeper in the railroad uh on the\nrail...in the railroad authorities. And each one who applied for a job had to submit his\nbaptismal papers and a Russian ID. When the Russians left, somehow he kept one ID\nfrom a Ukrainian girl. She was just a few years older than I. In ghetto he came to me and\nhe said run for your life. Here are the papers, legitimate papers because first they check,\nyou know, usually the parish and you're covered and I know she moved uh evacuated to\nRussia. You're on the safe side. She's little older but age you can never tell, and take it\nand go out of ghetto. I said Alec, how can you do? This is worth so many thousands of\ndollars. Your mother is starving to death. Your father who was such a prominent uh Jew\nbefore the war, start...died of starvation. Your sister is starving, so why don't you sell the\npapers. I don't have many thousand dollars to pay you. I need some money for escape to\nhave it, so sell and make some money. He insisted I should take them and save myself.\nHe refused to escape from ghetto although he was really...his looks were like hundred\nAryans, not one but he didn't want to because his mother was on death bed and he didn't\nwant to leave her, and I found out that he committed suicide when his mother died. His\nsister Trica (ph) who was eight years his junior, was taken in by the family who was from\na small town...I think , I'm not sure, of ... Still, you know, a small\ntown...some Jews could pay their way and some Ukrainians or peasants harbored them\nfor money. So they took her and this is how she survived the war. Right now she lives in\nLong Island. You know, we had very . When the Germans came they proclaimed\nthat we are all are Communists, and we are...they are free to kill us. So within a year, they\nkilled us all. Actually the only survivors from our, from our town maybe are three\nhundred to four hundred, only who masqueraded as gentiles and like I who were not\ncaught and again I'm telling you it was very hard, because Poland was not a melting pot\nthat you could blend in easily. One reason or another there always were pitfalls. Some\nsurvived who were drafted to Russian army and they survived in Russia, because like I\nmentioned before, we didn't have any concentration camps. We didn't have any labor\ncamps. Only that came towards the end, when there was no room any more. And you\nknow what? During the war, many times I contemplated suicide. And I made and I\nresolved if Hitler wins, I cannot go on a life of flight, and I'll commit suicide. If he\nlooses, then I will not be an orphan left alone because I still had a sister, a\ngrandmother...my gran...my mother's brothers in Palestine and I will be united with them.\nAnd also there was a will, a strong will of destiny. My goal was to survive, not to let the\nGermans to rewrite the history. Although I was very young and I didn't have any sense of\nhistory at that time, but because they claimed that we all Jews were\nCommunists, and I knew how the world hated the Communists, so later if there will not\nbe eye witnesses...I didn't know that there are more Jews will survive...they will be able\nto claim that they only killed us because we were Communists. And this gave me the\nstrength to live. Another thing I have to mention...again goodness. This Katia that I\nmentioned, who was a medical student from Lamberg who posed as a Ukrainian, she left\nme to the job in the kitchen and she got a job as a housekeeper by a German physician, a\ndoctor, which was much easier, better food. When I worked in the casinos as a\nchambermaid, I was entitled to have week vacation. Where could I go? So, Katia\nsuggested to me that she will harbor me in their apartment. I will not be permi...natural\nable to leave, to make believe that I went home for vacation and then I will come back.\nShe endangered herself. She had to share her food with me. Goodness. Actually I must\ntell you that I the goodness of people. Jews whom I encountered, and non-Jews.\nBut whatever I could do, I have done the same thing. For example...",
        "Q: You need to come back to the end of the war. Tell about what you and your husband did\nright after the war...",
        "A: But one more...good. But one more episode in goodness I have to also explain. Maybe\nthis part is on my side. When I graduated, (cough) we used to get tabloid (ph), picture of\nall the students. The picture was done by a photographer by the name Barchowski (ph),\nwho had the studio next to our building. One day I'm walking with Kashia on\nin Krakow to the garden. I see from har...far the Jew from Stanistlawow, Barchowsk1. I\nwasn't sure if he would recognize me or not. I ran towards him, embraced him and said\nmy name is Felecita Mewycheski. What's your name? He told me, and I introduced him\nto Kashia uh and he invited us to his studio. He started to date Kashia. I persuaded her,\nbecause he needed somebody to be...he slept in the studio by the Polish photographer. He\nmade us pictures. One day...he survived with his sister and his child...this sister put, could\npass for an Aryan, but the child not at all. Was five-year-old girl. One day when I was\nstill working in the casino, the sister came running, crying. And you know, there was a\nguard at the door. Not everybody...you...could enter the club. They asked for me. I came.\nShe said I'm Julia, Barchowski's sister. He was caught. And I cannot stay where I stay\nand I cannot sustain myself. What could I do? So I went to the boss and I asked him if he\ncan give a job to Julia, also as a chambermaid. Was dangerous, crowding again...two\nJewess and you don't know how she will behave. And about her daughter. I went to\nKashia . She was really a nice girl. I said Kashia, your mother has seven\nchildren. Would she take on Julia's niece, Barchowski's daughter and Julia will pay you\nwith her salary. After a month, her mother accepted the good little girl. The Polish police\nrecognized that she is Jewish and the mother writes a letter to Kashia...what did you do to\nme? You sent me a Jewish child. So Julia was in danger. I was in danger and the mother.\nLuckily the police took pity on the little girl and she...he said to the mother, I'm not sure\nshe is, but I'll let her stay in your place. The father survived. Barchowski survived in\nAuschwitz. He came back to Israel. We met him after the war. The sister survived. I had\nlittle trouble with the sister, because she like to drink a little bit, and it was very\ndangerous. I really...the last two months maybe also persuaded me to leave, and\nthe little girl survived, who's now married, lives in Israel, has family. So we really tried to\nhelp each other. Now after I met my husband, he was very busy at that time uh because\nthey're managing to take care of many Germans who were...and naturally he supplied me\nwith food, with everything. But what only...what he supplied not only me...he gave me\nclothes because this was the time in May when the Jews, slave laborers came out from\nthe concentration camp. Tattered stripe...what they had there, the or what.\nHe gave me clothes that he took from the Germans, that he conf...confiscated from the\nGerman apartment. I should give it out. Then there were many orphans that Jews started\ncollecting them, you know, who survived, looked, some knew where they have hidden\ntheir children, and one Jewess, although she converted, , she took care of\nthe children. But she didn't have food to feed them, not to dress them. And it came to my\nhusband's attention and he was able to supply them. What we didn't know...at that time\nmy husband was a high official in the Polish government in Krakow...so this\n, brought the children to Israel and she put his name, under the\nname that he was known at that time. It's a problem. So then he got a\ndeath sentence because he also searched for the , the ones that wanted to poison\nhim, that were so anti-Semitic. So I arr...1 was able to arrange for him a transfer to\nanother city. But meantime I wanted to study medicine. I didn't have any papers, so I\nhave to take exam that dismiss me from the whole subjects and he had connections and I\nwas accepted in Krakow but he was transferred to Breslau, so I dropped it. I went with\nhim to Breslau and I saw that this is under a satellite of Russia. I didn't survive the war to\nbe cut off again from my family. Even my husband with high position, I felt I'm a queen\nfor one night. This is not for me. So I told my husband I don't want to stay. We survived.\nWe have to go to Palestine, and my husband wanted to fight, at that time to join the\nJewish , to be able to fight for Israel. He couldn't obtain a legal permission to\nleave. He was told the only way he can leave or he'll be sent to Siberia or he should shoot\nhimself. The confidential (ph), the high position he had, he knows too many secrets. So I\narranged for him...it's a long story...an escape and he escaped and then I escaped with his\nbrother. I wanted with him, but his brother who survived with him decided that I have to\nstay with him, he should be able to liquidate the business which was not my place with\nthe brother, only with my husband, but he was young. This was an older brother sixteen\nyears, so he listened. I stayed. They kept us as hostages waiting for my husband to return\nto look for me. Luckily one Jew who know not my husband and me, learned about it, so\nhe guaranteed for me because they just kept me. I was in jail, but there was no sentence\nfor me. They just wanted him come to...for me and to catch him...",
        "Q: Who was keeping you in jail?",
        "A: The Pole...the police uh the uh , SO he obtained my release because I claimed\nI'm not my husband's wife because we were...got married on the real name, Amalia\nPetranka and Salsitz and he was known as and I as Amalia\nMewycheski (ph) so I claimed I was his mistress and this was the price I had to pay, so he\nobtained a release so my husband escaped. He succeeded and we arranged to meet in\nMunich. We met there and in Munich we wanted to go to Palestine. It was not a legal\nimmigration so my husband had his senior brother, twenty years older than my husband\nwho was...actually who was in Munich...this was before my husband was born...so we\napplied also for a visa to the United States and we felt whatever comes first legally we'll\ndo and so the papers to United States came first and we came here first, but in '49...and\nand meantime in United States I applied for job as a Hebrew teacher, and in '49 they had\nthe first chartered plane to Jerusalem, to the Hebrew University for the Hebrew teachers\nfor lectures, so we both went and this is where for the first time I was reunited with my\nsister, my grandmother, my uncles and my husband met his brother and met my family.\nUh first we didn't know. We wanted to stay in Israel. We felt we are young. This is where\nwe belonged. But my uncles advised me there were very hard times . Being that\nwe are young we should go back to United States, build our life in United States and try\nto help the family as much as we can. And this what we tried to do. About thirty times\nalready maybe we were in Israel. And after ten years, was born to us, to our eleventh\nanniversary, our daughter whom we named after my husband's mother and after my sister\nTeela (ph), Esther Teela. She became a lawyer and now she has herself three sons. She\nnamed each one after one of ours who were killed. And she and her husband, who is a\ndoctor, are very active in Jewish organizations and they try to keep Judaism...she sends\nher son, older son who 1s now seven, to school to keep up Judaism.",

        "A: My name is Amalie Petranker. Now it's Salsitz. I was born October 21st, 1922 in Munich,\nGermany, but I was just born there. Why? It was an accident. My mother was visiting\nthere, but I was raised, brought up and till '42 I lived in Stanistlawow (ph) which is now\n. It's very much to the southeast of Poland as Landberg (ph). Stanistlawow\nwas considered a big city. It...a large city with inhabitants a hundred thousand. From\nthere forty thousand Jews, forty thousand Ukrainians, and twenty thousand Poles. Before\nthe outbreak of the war, Polish government wanted to Polanize it, so they brought Poles\nfrom , from the German border and they settled them in Stanistlawow in order to\nincrease the Polish population. And Stanistlawow, Stanistlawow was a modern city. It\nbecame big after the Ist World War, has beautiful parks, boulevards. Had many high\nschools and each minority its own high school, like the Jews had their Jewish\ngymnasium. The Ukrainians had Ukrainian gymnasium, and the Germans had a German\ngymnasium. And naturally we had state gymnasiums and there very few Jews were\naccepted. It was numerous classes, so means a certain number, only seven percentage of\nthe students. Majority of Jews in Poland, uh in Stanistlawow were progressive. We had a\nsmall nucleus of Hasidic (ph) Jews but they lived in this one section which later became\nghetto. Uh...",
        "A: My family. My parents were very progressive. My father was a , a Zionist, who\nbelieved very much in education. He was very well rounded. He had the Jewish education\nand he was a graduate of Agriculture School. For him, education was very\nimportant. My mother also was a graduate of the uh art (ph) school. This was a German\nschool. Ten years. They have something like this now in Haifa, in Israel. My mother went\nthere. All the subjects were taught in German because most of my mother's family was in\nGermany, so they wanted her to know. My fath...my father was a modern Jew, and his\nknowledge, especially in Judaic studies taught him well because he was in lumber\nbusiness and the Jews didn't like to go with any every case to the court, so they selected\nlike judges, , and my father was selected to be a because he knew the\nJewish law and because he was so educated. For him, or Hebrew scholars was\njust the same. He also had a hobby. He was a painter. And wha...this saved him when he\nwas in the army because when he was in the Austrian army, Jews were just plain soldiers,\nand actually they used to be even orderlies (ph) to officers. They have to clean their\nboots. But because of his ability to draw he worked in an office and he printed and drew\nthe announcement proclamations that they needed. My father's family was quite well to\ndo before the Ist World War, but after the war, when they were burned out, they had\nlumber business. Uh they had uh uh brick factory, and they had an inn, but they lost a lot\nof money, so what remained is only education and this made a very deep impression on\nmy late father. So having three daughters he said I will try to prepare for them dowry, but\nI'm not sure if they will be able to take advantage, so my duty is to give them very good\neducation, so at least they will have something to stand, which will sustain them, that he\nwould have foreseen what future would be. My mother was a very easy-going, very sweet\nwoman. She was very young. She was twenty-two only when I was born, and twenty-one\nwhen my oldest sister, so she was like one of us. And maybe it's good she was easy-\ngoing, because my late father was like a Prussian officer. He didn't have any sons, so he\nactually treated us like we'll be in the army, like soldiers. He was fair but very\ndemanding, so she in a way protected us. Sometimes when he was strict, she did. He\ndemanded, but now I'm very grateful. At that time it was very hard on us, like for\nexample, we attended private schools. He wanted us to be protected from being called\nkikes and Jews, so from the kindergarten...we went to a Hebrew kindergarten where all,\nwe spoke only Hebrew...we went to Hebrew school from the first grade to the sixth where\nall the subjects were taught in Hebrew except History in Polish, then we went...so of\ncourse Jewish gymnasium because the language, prevalent language was Polish,\nbut we continued with our Judaic studies, and we were three sisters. My older one was\nPepi (ph). I was the middle one and my younger one was Teela (ph) and we were just a\nyear apart, so like first, second, third grade. Second, third and fourth. So we were called\ninschool _, ; , (laughter) because we were so...just a year apart, you\nknow, and we looked alike. As a matter of fact, I looked...my younger sister looked very\nmuch like I. My older...little bit...she was platinum blonde with blue eyes and\nunfortunately I was the middle and the shortest and the smallest. And I was unhappy\nbecause in Europe was accepted to hand-down, so naturally the oldest gave to the middle\nand the middle to the youngest. In my case, I got stuff from my youngest one, so it wasn't\nso pleasant for me, so I had to prove myself and there I tried to excel in studies, like not\nonly what we had a lot of work in school. It was very demanding because it was very\nexpensive and unless we performed our parents took us out from the school, would take\nus out and we would have to learn vocation, but our ambition really was to be...to finish\nand to cont...to go to medical school, so I remember when it came Sabbath, this was the\nonly day off. Instead we should be off and go with our friends for a walk, so winter time,\nevery Friday night, my father after dinner sat down with us and we had to study with him\n, the of the Sages (ph) and also the , the Savior from the Weak\n(ph), and every Saturday, summer time, . At that time we resented it very\nmuch and I resented it very much and being the middle one, I had to show I am the best,\nso...because I was the smallest one...so uh then we were rewarded. Whoever knew got\nmoney, spending money to go to the movies. And God forbid if we didn't know what\nhappened someplace to my older sister, so she was the pride of the spending money, for\nallowance, which was really a tragedy for her at that time. And you see also not only that\nwe had to read books for school for literature. My father assigned to us books and every\nSaturday we had to finish by Saturday and discussed. So education was very stressed. My\nmother was very active like in PTA. We had lunchtime...like every Tuesday she used to\nserve lunch in gymnasium for us. I was very proud. She was a very pretty woman, on the\nheavy side with her beautiful smile, very pretty face. Now my father was in lumber\nbusiness but I think two, three years before the start of of the war, it was nationalized and\nour part by the government and it was called . Being my father was quite known\nand prominent in lumber business, the director from Warsaw came and told him, you\ncannot be director of because you are Jewish, but you will be the vice director,\nand he nominated as the director, and I mentioned because later on\nI'll tell you...he was helpful in my survival. As a rule, we were sheltered. We didn't have a\nlot to do with the Christian population. Actually each minority kept to itself. We didn't\nhave too much problem. Only our problem arose during the holidays or on Sundays,\nbecause other schools were closed. Our school was next to a church, so this was a day\nfree for them to throw stones on us. As children I resented it to be singled out. I was hurt.\nBut this was something we couldn't do. It...even when...it became so bad before the\noutbreak of the war, that the police advised our custodian...we had an iron gate around\nour school...to keep it closed, so they shouldn't be able to enter our school yard and to\nthrow stone and to beat us up. In our town, there were some incidents of anti-Semites,\nespecially when there were students came from universities at Christmas time and Easter\nand they wanted and they liked to beat up the Jews, but we had Jews who were actually\nvery strong physically, the butchers, the uh drivers and later they learned to be prepared\nand they used to take a two-by-four and fight back. They didn't take it. Now uh we had\ngood relationship with the Ukrainians because they also were minorities. So before the\nwar, they co....they cooperated with the Jews in commerce and in business, like my late\nfather needed for example a loan. He went, he got a loan from Ukrainian bank, but not\nfrom the Bellish (ph) uh, Polish bank, from the state bank. I had many friends. We were\nthree daughters. My house always was full with friends, because even if...to each one of\nus came one friend. My closest friend was Junior (ph) Lawber (ph) and happens that she\nwas named like my mother, Frederika (ph) Junior, and I was named like her mother,\nbecause my parents called me Malia (ph) and her mother. We were very close friends and\nthis was through the whole war. And also I was very close to my younger sister. We\nloved each other so much that when my parents wanted for my sister and to make sure\nthat she would listen, they came to me and they used to joke, what will happen when\nMalia will get married. With whom will you be, although it was only one-year difference\nbetween us, but my older didn't want to bother with us. She went with other friends. And\nwe had beautiful parks. We participated. We used to go to summer camps. Wintertime,\nthe winter vacation. We went skiing. We had pretty normal, happy life. It's true it was not\nthe life of all the Jews in my town. There was a select group, middle and above which\ncould afford it. There were poor Jews. There were Jews who after the mandatory six\ngrades went to learn vocation, to be a seamstress or to be a salesgirl. I would say there are\nsome very poor who just didn't have even money for Sabbath. We had some magnets (ph)\nlike , very very rich who donated planes to the government. Majority\nbarely eked out a living, but was a group like my parents, middle and above, who were\nquite comfortable. This was un...until the war broke out. In '31, in September, broke out\nthe German war, uh the World War, but we had...",
        "A: '39. At that time I was not even seventeen years old. First, '39, after a few weeks, we read\na proclamation that the Russian army...I think after a week or two...that the Russian army\nwill come for order and safety of the city 'till the situation will be cleared and that we\nshould cooperate. So far...when the war broke out we had bombs, bombing and a few\nJews were killed. Some buildings were destroyed. But this was at the beginning, in '39,\nSeptember. The Russians came to our town. They occupied it. It was not for time being\nlike we were told, and we had never dealt with the Communists, with the Russians. We\ndidn't know what to expect. So we wanted to get some feeling, some understanding. So\nwe stopped the soldiers to ask them, to question about the life in Russian. When we\nquestioned them, they told us everything in superlative, so Jews were very skeptical so\nwe, So some just asked and tell me...how about ; . Do you have a lot of\n? And they said no, . So we knew it's all uh propaganda and not\ntrue. Our life changed drastically. Special the middle-class and the rich or the so-called\nbourgeois...like my parents were given a special paragraph, paragraph 11 - means we\nwere any moment destined to be shipped to Siberia, and in a way I wish it would\nhappened. Maybe my parents would survive. And also, I was at that time, I graduated\nfrom first . I was supposed to go to the second and graduate. So they entered\nit, and the ten-year system they call it, the class, and the standard of learning\nand living changed. Like my foreign language was English. This 1s why I have such an\naccent even now, because I learned in the gymnasium, but for them learning languages...I\nmean unless you're in special school, was a bourgeois, so this we had only reading for\ncomprehension where in the third year of my learning English I already had Shakespeare.\nLowered the standard. But the subjects math and physics was a very high standard. But\nthe problem is immediately they developed , with political departments, and\neach student was called in and specially from the middle class and I was warned, unless\nyou report on your friends, then you'll be expelled or you'll be fined. Always threatened.\nAnd then we saw our schoolmates suddenly taken in by . They had special cars\nwhich they took away. This installed fear in us. My father, who was a government high\nofficial, was in business, suddenly became a laborer. And I was accepted to institute they\ncall it. They didn't want to take me to the medical school, but they were short in teachers,\nso they expec...uh accepted me to Institute they call it,\n. Means math and physics. After four months, I was called in.\nI was told because you cannot get a stipendum (ph) because each student got a stipendum\nthat he could sustain himself and could study. You cannot because you're bourgeois but if\nyou pay us six hundred rubles a month, you can continue. At that time my father earned\nonly two hundred rubles, so naturally it was out for me. Also we lived in fear that any\ntime they will ship us to Siberia. One thing saved us. Where our house, it was actually\nour condominium, this was assigned each section was assigned to different branch of\ngovernment. Our section was assigned to rail authorities (ph). Means they could take over\nany apartment for their workers, officials that they have chosen. Our apartment were\nassigned to a Russian engineer. When he came to take it over, my sis...my younger sister\nwas present, and when he saw my sister...she was very beautiful and I1...little on the\nheavy side. He said he cannot throw my sister out. He put his name on the door, and my\nsister saved that apartment at the time. But it was very important, because we didn't have\nany other address and he lived on this one, so means they couldn't ship us anymore. We\nwere not registered. See my older sister, she got married in '31, with a Pales...Palestinian\nfrom my town who came for vacation and met her. He was eleven years her senior. He\nfell in love with her. They were in a resort and he wanted to marry her. The war broke\nout, so he gave a choice for my sister and he said, let's get engaged. After the war I will\ncome back. I will marry you. Or if you want, I can marry you and you'll go with me back\nto Palestine. My sister had chosen to get married. My parents didn't approve. She was\nonly eighteen years old, but she persuaded them being my grandmother and my mother's\nbrother and the whole family who were Germans, lived at that time in Palestine, so she\nexplained she has family there and she's not going just with her husband and they\npermitted. I'll never forget the day when she left. First of all, we were never separated,\nand like I explained we were just a year apart and my younger sister, like she would have\na premonition. She fainted and blood came out of her nose, like she would have known\nthis was the last time that she sees her. (crying) So my sister left for Palestine and my\nfamily was my parents, my younger sister and I. When the Russo (ph) German war broke\nout in '41 in June, where I worked they gave some Jews pink (ph) , Means\npermit to evacuate with the Russians. I came home with this, and I presented it to my\nparents and my late father said, I didn't know that I raised a Communist. You are not\nleaving the house. You're staying here but if you leave, you cannot come back to us. And\nmy mother said, I went through with the Germans during the 1st World War. They are\ncivilized people. I don't believe the atrocities that we hear. This must be Russian\npropaganda. We are staying put in the place. So, I was supposed to leave with my\nboyfriend, Alec (ph) Lamsdorf (ph), whose father was the chief engineer of the railroad\nauthority. Being he was Jewish, he couldn't become so-called . This was the\nhighest official, but he has a special car for himself on the line from my town to the\nborder, so we could have escaped. He proposed, he would take his sister Tricia (ph), who\nby the way survived, and I would take my sister Teela, and we four will escape if our\nparents don't want. But my father forbade me. So when the Ru...Russo-German war\nbroke out, first we had for a month the Hungarians. The Hungarian army entered my\ntown, Stanistlawow or . The Hungarians were very were good to us and\nagain, the same story. They were supposed to requisition apartments. Being our\napartment was like on the 5th Avenue, ours was supposed to requisition, be requisitioned,\nand came a Hungarian graf (ph), Count , with his adjutant. This time I saved\nthe situation. He liked me, so he decided he's not going to take it. He stayed in the hotel,\nbut he put his name on our apartment and he started courting me. I was eighteen only.\nFlowers, and food was scarce so he ate in our house so we would be able to have meal\ntogether. Was even one situation unheard of. Uh they had a spy, a Hungarian young man,\nextremely handsome, whom they used to draft in England. They had spy uh housekeeper\nfor one very important uh lord or something, and he spied for the Germans. So the count\nsaid that he has to invite him too. He'll come to our house, but we should be very careful\nnot to disclose that we are Jews. And he told us about his uh deeds, what he had done and\nhow he worked in Hungary. The Count told my father that he knows that our fate is\nsealed and it's very set. They are going to kill us. He told my father I cannot save you all,\nbut he would like to save me, so he proposed that I should embrace Christianity and he\nwill marry me and he will smuggle me to Hungary. My father expressed his gratitude and\nhe said as a family he would like to stay together. He appreciates it and in a way he\ndeclined it. I couldn't understand it. Not that I loved him but he...f was impressed. __ ten\nyears old and I remember also the graf used to come with us where the Jews were\nassigned for slave labor with the army. Among them was Baron Moore (ph) who was his\nfriend before the war. Now he tried to protect him and to help him as much as possible.\nSo even the Baron Moore talked to my father. Listen, now he's infatuated with your\ndaughter, but you are wise not to let her go. He 1s the first-born. His mother would not\ntolerate it, anditmay bea ___ unto your daughter. You're very smart, but my father\ndidn't explain to me, so I surprised, asked him why he didn't permit me. He stated the\nreason that even I understood is right at that time. Meantime, this was...they were shipped\nto Russia, to fight in Russia, and the Germans entered. At that time, they shipped\nRussian, uh Hungarian Jews to our town, and when the Germans entered, they kept the\nJews on . It was a big mill house uh and they were kept there. When the Germans\ncame, immediately they ordered us to wear the bands with the star, after age I think\ntwelve, and they ordered all the Jews to register. Specially the first to register, they\nordered the teachers...the professional people. So the Jewish , which took care of\nthe Jewish life before the war, told them to register, so the Poles should be able to\nget jobs. They never returned from the meeting where they were called to a meeting. This\nwas the first. Then we all had to register, according to the streets, and we specially from\n5th Avenue, from the nice neighborhood, were assigned as cleaning girls to the Gestapo\nbuilding to scrip, to scrub the floors and the toilets with our hands. We had to wear scrub\nbrushes, pails, and we were assigned. One day when I was assigned there...it was just\nafter a week my sister was assigned, my best friend Junior was assigned to work, and\nwe...when once we came there we haduh ___ lady who was German, ethnic German,\nmeans born in Poland, and she was the supervisor. One day, a Gestapo man came and he\npointed to me and to another girl to step out of the line. The supervisor was once a\nneighbor of mine, because when we were young, we lived in the German suburbs...was\nbeautiful, out of town and only two Jewish families lived there. Family Sweik (ph) who\nowned a farm, and me, and we. She knew us by sight because this was at least I would\nsay to '35 so means I was uh twelve, thirteen years old. When he called me out, to step\nout and this girl...this girl was a refugee from Berlin, Vita Sh , a beautiful girl. She\nwas sure that he wants to kill us, to shoot us so she said that we are good workers, decent\nworkers. We should be left alone. So he slapped her on the face. He didn't know that she's\naunt of the two brothers, Mueller (ph) who are, were very sadistic and very big off...high\nofficers in the Gestapo. He thought that she's Polish only. So she advised me not...and he,\nso he told us to report to the private quarters where they just moved in to clean the\napartments there. She advited...advised us not to report to work. She would protect us in\norder he should forget, because she still didn't trust him what he will do to us. So a few\ndays later, when we reported back, we had to clean the buildings and he spotted me\nthrough the window, and he called me in and this Vita Sh . He called me. He started\nquestioning me very nasty and he said he wants me to work, to be responsible for this\napartment. I'll never forget the picture of my sister with a group waiting outside and\ncrying because she thought this is the end. At that time I was responsible for cleaning this\nparticu...his apartment and Vita Sh was responsible for cleaning another\napartment. Meanwhile responsible because then they sent from the Jewish community, uh\nfrom the , other Jewish girls to clean and Jewish women who are wives of the\nprofessionals whose husbands were taken away, they're responsible for furnishing the\napartment. And my sister still remained in the main building to clean. You know, the\nJews from Hungary were sitting there in the coal (ph) yard. They brought them from the\nmill, from , to the courtyard of the Gestapo, and they were crying. They were\nhungry. They were tired. They were beaten, with children. They were there. My sister\nwent to work, and they made a sandwich that my parents gave her when she went to work\nand for me, she dropped through the window for them to eat. A Gestapo officer noticed\nit, and he brought her down to there. Since then I have never seen her. She started to cry,\nand there was Ukrainian police, and she told him that her sister is working in the\napartment for Gestapo and and was his name, and he should\nnotify me, who can talk that I can do something for her. This is a mistake. Then they take\nher out. I tried. So there were Gestapo who took me out of the line, he was in charge and\nwhen I came crying he told me I should go and the one who was in charge, maybe\nhe will listen to me, and I forgot in the apartment we were told not to wear the armbands.\nWhen he saw me, and I told him, explained the reason of my coming, he said so she's\nJewish. So you're Jewish. And he yelled at me...how did you dare to come without a\nband. I'll shoot you too. Actually the penalty was to be shot if somebody didn't with band.\nHe let me go...I don't know. The Gestapo, how cruel he was. He kept telling me and his\nfiance who came to live with him who was from and she took a liking to me, that\nthey took only my sister for labor because it was harvest time and they were short in field\nhands. After fall, they will release her. So, I came home and I had to bring the news to\nmy mother. Naturally it was a terrible shock and my mother tried to comfort me because I\nwas very close to my sister, and I tried to comfort my mother. My mother was only forty\nyears old and from red hair she had, she became white within a day. And we still\nbelieved...we clung to the hope that my sister will come back after the wa...the harvest.\nMeantime we saw shooting on the street, random shooting. They took the Jews and to\nwork on the street. They used to catch them, you know, and then to dig ditches or to work\nat bridges and then sometimes they used to throw them into the river and Russians\nerected many monuments so they took the Jews to destroy the monuments, and many of\nthem were shot. They didn't come back. This was going on till around, till September,\nand I still work at that time by this Gestapo. Then we were told that we will have to leave\nour apartment and to move to a section which was designated as ghetto. This was the\npoorest section of the Jews. Being...again we lived like on the 5th Avenue, my parents\nsecured immediately an apartment in the future ghetto, and the always optimist Jew that\nwe hoped war will end before we'll have to move. We transferred our furniture there. We\nstill kept only a mattress, the essential thing in ghetto and on...while we lived on\n35, with hope that we'll maybe not have to move. Then suddenly, on , October\nthe 12th, we were in our apartment which almost was bare and it was a large apartment.\nOnly the mattresses and some utensils. We heard terrible commotion and noise. I went\nout on the balcony and I saw a lot of Gestapo and Ukrainian police. We knew something\nis brewing, something bad is going...will happen, but neither what really\nhappened. We thought that maybe now they will gather the Jewish men like have done\nwith the Hungarian men that they brought to us, to break us economically so means only\nthe men are in danger. So my mother decided to hide my father in one of the attics. Each\ncondominium, condominium had it's own part of the attic and it's own part in the cellar,\nso we have hidden my father on the attic. My mother got the key. And after an hour, my\nmother's cousin who lived...also owned a condominium in this complex came and said\nlook, it's very unsafe to stay in an apartment. Let's all go to the cellar and let's hide there,\nand this was a house like a facade (ph)...many buildings. She thought it's safe there. I\nreally never disobeyed my mother because we were raised to uh obey our parents. I\nrefused to go with her down to the cellar with the family and other Jewish neighbors.\nOnly one neighbor, Mrs. Pollack (ph), who was an old lady, seventy-five, something...she\nhad, she had also hidden her husband. She decided to stay with me. My reasoning was\nthey will come in. They will see empty rooms. They will not enter the last room. This 1s\nhow my reasoning went, and I refused to go. I stayed with her in the, in our apartment.\nWe heard...we heard cries. We heard noise, but we didn't know from where it's coming.\nBy noon, my neighbor's son knocked at the door, Rister (ph), and he said your\nmother would like you very much to come. Please don't be stubborn. Again, the same\nstory. I don't know why I was so stubborn. I can't explain to today. I refused to come\ndown. I didn't. Towards evening it come down...some...Mrs. Pollack and I decided to\nventure in the hall and to find out what's going on. Our Christian neighbors said, you are\nhere. They took everybody from the cellar. They loaded them on the trucks and they took\nthem to the Jewish cemetery. It was a terrible shock. I didn't know how to act. But I still\ndidn't suspect that this was for killing. This was the first time. So I thought maybe this is\nthe gathering place, so now I have somehow to get my father out and to join my mother.\nFinally I managed with the neighbor's help, to get him out. Before we managed to go, my\nneighbor, Mrs. Reifter (ph), with her husband and children, came . Straight\nhair pulled down and from her we found out what happened...that they took them to the\ncemetery. My mother was crying on the truck when she saw the direction, and she said\nthey're taking us to the cemetery to be shot. Why didn't I listen to Malia. My parents\ncalled me Malia. At the cemetery...first of all they told them to sit down in rows and they\nsent Jewish girls, young girls, to pick up all the jewelry. And there was a board and they\nshot...even if people were killed or not, they fell to the ditch. They collected thirty\nthousand Jews on this day. My mother was with her cousin and they took my mother's\ncousin. So the cousin said to my mother, I can't witness this. So my mother said you are\nright. Let's move closer. We'll be spared to witness the shooting. Let's be shot. She didn't\nknow that when it became dark, the Gestapo announced whoever is alive can go\nback to his home. But my mother was not there anymore to come home. So this how my\nsister and my mother were gone. (crying) My father and I remained home. And now they\nshot fifteen thousand Jews on this day. This was . This was my birthday.\nOn the Jewish calendar, . Naturally I will never now celebrate on my birthday\non the Jew calendar and so immediately from my family, my father and I was left. Now\nwe had to go to the ghetto. For two people we couldn't have an apartment. They assigned\nten people per room. My mother had a step-sister. Her name was Clara Hoot (ph).\nActually I would say she was poor. They were not so close, but the goodness and the best\nwas coming out and there were bad times. She lived where the ghetto was supposed to be,\nso she approached my father and said, you're only two people. Why should you be\nassigned to strangers? We are five people. We have only a room and a kitchen. We'll take\nyou in. And she was to me like a mother. (crying) Till today, you know, I felt so guilty\nthat we didn't treat them like really aunt should be treated. How good she was, and we\nstayed with her. Her husband maked tops of the shoes and this was very good because the\nGermans liked boots so there was a German cobbler who used to bring the materials he\nshould make it. For this he got food, so he was also sustaining us, helping us with food\nwhere others were starving. The life in ghetto was just terrible. Many of my schoolmates,\nrich people, wealthy people...I will never forget the face, for example, from one other\n, only child, so spoiled...his father was the head of the Juden (ph), uh Jewish _,,\nnot Juden...and laying on the streets swollen. The next day from hunger water came out,\nand this the picture. You saw, you knew the people starving to death, and you couldn't\neven share and give them. So my father learned that if he 1s assigned as a slave laborer\nout of ghetto, at least he will have the chance to barter clothes for food, whatever...bread\nwas really very hard to get. So with his connections, he was able to get a job on the\nrailroad as as slave worker, and then he tried for me to get a job too, because my father\nsaid, being we two are left, let's not ever separate. Let's always be together. Meantime my\nuncle died in ghetto. My Uncle Dabbie Toot (ph), he died a natural death. His son, Jacob,\nwas taking . It's forced labor . His daughter was taken away\nfrom the street. She was very beautiful. They collected hundred of beautiful...hundred\nbeautiful Jewish girls. They disappeared. We don't know where. So only my Aunt Clara,\nher daughter Pepi (ph) who's named like my sister Pepi (ph), and the oldest son who also\ngot the job to make tops for the German cobbler Gross (ph)... remember his name...he\nremained. And one day my father said to me, you know what. We have to escape from\nghetto. My father had so-called iron (ph) luck (ph). Spoke Polish well. So he decided that\nwe'll try to get to the Iron side and maybe some of his friends will help us or to or will\nharbor us, will help us. We didn't think farther, just first to go out. So he dressed himself\nwith few suits. He divided the money that we have. He gave me some few thousand\nand we were supposed to go out from ghetto and try our luck. And he said let me\ngo first. If I succeed, then you go. I waited. After five minutes he came back, beaten up\nby the Ukrainian police. Luckily he had the money, because if not he would be shot, but\nthey took away his suits and the money and they pushed him back to the ghetto. So our\nescape was foiled. Meantime they will have killings in the ghetto. You know, they\nassigned the Jews, classified the Jews, just to find excuse for each killing which they call\nan aktion. First were the children. Then were all the old people. Then were people who\nwere sick, people who couldn't work, so was A, B, C classification. One day we got\nclassification of A - means we don't have to be afraid because we are working, right? One\nday we saw through the window aktion. Aktion was...there was no secret. Openly, in the\nghetto they digged ditches and they shot on the spot, so everybody had seen it. It's not\nlike concentration camp, we didn't have. We didn't have a labor camp. They just had done\nit first on the Jewish cemetery, but then when there's no room anymore, they had done it\nin the ghetto, and the ghetto was life, in between the killings, going on semi-normal. We\ntried. We hoped this is the end, especially when Roosevelt entered the war. We thought\nwe will be saved. Everybody just tried to live another day with the hope that they would\nsurvive, and one day...this was before my father obtained for me also uh a labor card that\nI can work on the railroad...again we heard rumors that there's to be another killing. My\ncousin Pepi worked in a factory where the mill was on making slippers for the\narmy. Those usually workers were excused from aktion, from killing. My poor Aunt\nClara tells me, come with me...we'll be there safe because my father was out. At that time\nit was safe to be out of ghetto when killing was going on. My other cousin, my cousin\nwas out by the German who lived in , where he made, you know, the boots,\nso she said to me, come with me. We'll be safe in the factory because they didn't touch\nbefore the factories. Again my premonition. I said Aunt Clara, I don't want to go. You\nhave an old house. You have an old hut (ph). Let's hide under where the firewood is kept\nand let's crawl under this. We'll cover it with the firewood and they will not find us. My\nAunt Clara said said you're a child. Listen to me. It's safer there. I refused. I didn't want to\ngo. Again, why? She was so good to me. She was like mother. Why I didn't listen to\nher...I remained. I crawled there. I have hid myself. She went to the factory. On this day\nthey took everybody from the factory. There was no more room for the ditches. This was\nthe first time they shipped them to to be gassed. So only my father, my cousin\nand I were left in the ghetto. So my father obtained for me a permit to work, a working\ncard to work outside, and he told me if should ever come the time that we'll be separated\nand we are not in the same transport to be sent to be gassed, let's jump from the death\ntrain, cattle cars. What more can happen to us? Let's run for our life, and within three\nweeks to get in touch with the other part which we means left in the ghetto if we are not\nin the transport, and get united again. It was in October '42. I had high temperature. I\ncouldn't go to work. My father closed me in the apartment with the lock outside. He went\nto work. Even...I had high temperature. I was delirious. I heard noises. I knew another\nkilling 1s going on, so I crawled again in the same space where I have hidden myself\nbefore, hoped that my father is safe because he is out of ghetto, yes? And nothing will\nhappen and usually when it was dark they let in the workers from outside, the slave\nworkers in to the ghetto. It's dark. Meantime they came to look in the apartment with the\ndog, and the Germans said, is here, rouse (ph), and they leaved uh left the\napartment. So I was so happy. I said at least my father is safe. When it's dark he will\nreturn to the ghetto and we will be united. It's night. My father is not there. So I decided,\nsick or not sick, I have to go next day to work...you see, because we used to march, and\nthey guarded us with the Ukrainian police to work actually like prisoners, and I'll find out\nwhat happened. Before even I came to work, my Christian acquaintance was standing\nbehind the gate of the ghetto and she said, don't look for your father. They took all the\nJews from outside to be shipped to be gassed. So I somehow, knowing my father I knew\nhe will do everything not to let himself be shipped to the gas. And meantime what I didn't\nmention, once when there was such killing and we knew we all had Cate...Category A\nmeans we're exempt from shooting, we stayed in apartment. At that time my Aunt Clara\nwas still alive. Her daughter Pepi was alive, my father and I. And the brother\nopened our apartment. We presented our cards and they said, rouse. They always ignored\nit. We were fools. We thought that they will respect it. He recognized me from the days\nwhen I was assigned to the private apartment because he had that sadistic pleasure when I\nwent to work to knock at the window, and I was very afraid of him because he known,\nwas known as a sadist, and this give him a pleasure. So I guess in ghetto when he came to\ntake us out for shooting, he pushed me inside. He recognized me through the apartment\n(ph). So I had the presence of my uh mind that I'm...and I said no. He is my father. I\ncannot let him go. So they didn't believe me because my father was very young looking\nso they were two brothers - Willie and Hans (ph), so one tried to test me so with his uh\nwhat...rubber what they had...uh not gun...oh how you call tt... ( )...he hit my father\nvery hard and I saw tears from my father's eyes, so I started to cry bitterly. This\nconvinced them that this is my father. So they permitted him to go with me, and then I\nsaid on my aunt, this is my mother. I will never know why they let me go, but they let go.\n. When it was day of trial in Vienna, I was called as a witness, and I have\nproblem. I didn't know what to do. To go to testify because I witnessed many killings, or\nbecause he recognized me, not to go. And I have chosen not to go but I'll send somebody\nelse, and unfortunately she didn't know the facts. And the facts were after they let us go,\nthrough my window I saw where was the , the gathering place already where\nthey took for killing, and I saw Willie shot my neighbor, Mrs. Leichter (ph) who\ncame from the cemetery who told me what happened at the cemetery, in the back. She\nwas just walking. So it was willful killing. It was not that she was caught in the aktion.\nThis kind of guy he was. So maybe I was destined to live, and this what happened. So\ncoming back to this, when I lost my father, I was left alone. The German shoemaker kept\nmy cousin and he kept him in his apartment...he should work for him. While I was\nworking as a slave labor on the railroad, every Jew or Jewess was not _\u2014 because we\nhad the and we had to work with our bare hands to wash the toilets and scrub the\nfloors. There was employed a carpenter, a by the name Abraham...uh Edmond\nAbraham Ovitch (ph). He was from , half hour away from town Stanistlawow\nwhere there was a big concentration of and they were considered by Hitler, by the\nGermans, as foreigners because they were Turkish descendants from Crimea (ph). Mostly\nthey were farmers or army men. And he worked there. He offered me...when my father\nwas still alive...to take me and to help me and to harbor me. He lived with his mother,\nsister-in-law and a baby and he said he will help me and he told me that he helped ten\nother, other Jewish girls. I will tell you what happened, or maybe I should tell you right\nnow. I was the only one who who didn't blend into the Slavic population because I don't\nhave the high Slavic cheekbones and my eyes were considered very Semitic. The other\ngirls were all typical so-called Aryan looks, blonde, blue eyes and from the eleven, I am\nthe only one who survived. Because I knew that I don't look Slavic, I could pass\nsomehow as a German girl so I was advised to work in the lion's den so I worked for\nGerman companies. I will explain later what I have done, and they were so sure that they\nwould not be recognized so they worked in Polish companies and normally they were\nbeautiful. They were approached by Poles to date, and when they refused...maybe they\nsaid it jokingly...you must be a Jewish...and the sudden fear in their eyes gave them out\nand the Poles denounced them. I was the only one. So one day he propo...offered me this\nwhile still my father was alive. But he told me that he cannot harbor my father. When my\nfather was gone, I waited three weeks. I didn't hear from him, so I thought he didn't\nsucceed to jump from the running train and poor one (ph), he was killed. So one day he\ncame and he told me according to my information, they will...they last two thousand Jews\nwho were left at ghetto from one time hundred thousand Jews, we were forty thousand\nJews and they used to bring in Jews from small towns and villages. What, at one time we\nwere a hundred. Only two thousand remained. So he told me that from here's information\nthat now they will finish us all off, and he would advise me not to go back to go back\nwith the column of slave workers, back to the ghetto...only after work, he will arrange\nthat I will be able to stay in the office on the railroad and the next day after work will\ndispose of my and to go to with him to .\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: So Edmund Abraham Ovitch, he told me to stay, that I shouldn't go back, and I slept on\nthe railroad station in the office of the Chief . After the War, I found out how he\narranged it, and this proved to me how sincere and honest he is, that he really wants to\nsave my life and after work I dropped my arm band with my star carelessly on the tracks\nbecause if they would find it they would search for the one who threw it away, and I\nboarded the train to , half hour ride. But I didn't want to sit next to Mundig\nbecause I felt if I'm caught, why should he loose his life. So I sat by myself and there\nwere workers, maybe about thirty, coming back from work. They all knew me because if\nI should present it because like all white and one . | was there with the arm\nband so they saw me everyday so they knew me, and like in every train the police came\nand the German police came. On every train was a Gestapo police, checked the\npassengers. When I...before they were supposed to approach me I must have been in\nterrible fear. I can't explain why the workers gave me a sign with their eyes not to fear,\nthat they will not give me away. Where they were so eager to denounce others, I was\ndestined to live. And the police came. I didn't have any papers. I was afraid, but the\nGerman police sat next to me and discussed the weather, how beautiful it is, and he left.\nSo safely I arrived to Mundig's house. His mother was very upset. I don't blame her,\nbecause I endangered her and the whole family. On top of it without any reward. I didn't\nhave even money to pay for it. She resented and she made it clear to me, so the son\npromised her that whenever he can find for me a safe haven, I will leave. As a matter of\nface, even she refused me the meals. Again I don't blame because it was very hard to get\nfood, so the son, to make sure that I am eating, demanded that I should eat with him the\ndinner together. But I would like to go back to a few scenes in the ghetto that I omitted. I\nthink it's very important. You see, the Germans, when their wives came to visit them\nfrom Germany, their pleasure was to show the ghetto like we'll be animals in the zoo and\nthey used to take them and parade them through the main streets. So one day parading\nthem and looking at them, at us Jews like animals, one Jew...I forgot his last\nname...Joseph...by the way, he's alive...he's now in the United States...when they were\ngaping at us, he spate on the Germans and run away. Immediately the Gestapo came to\nthe Juden___ and they gave, and at that time the president of Juden____\u2014 was Goldstein,\nand he gave an order to line up uh the Jewish orderlings (ph), means the Jewish police,\nand every ten was singled out to step out and he was hanged, but he needed the rope to\nhang them, so he said first that the Juden , the president should decide which ones\nwill step out. He said I cannot do it, Mr. Goldstein said. I'm not God. I will not do it. He\nshould bring rope. He didn't want to bring rope, so they sent somebody else and they\nhanged the head of the Juden , Mr. Goldstein with every ten police...uh Jewish\npolice. One of them married my schoolmate, Eddie Fraley (ph), and he, when they\nhanged him, the rope broke down and he escaped. They let him escape because they\nthought that they will get him another time. But they didn't and actually he escaped from\nghetto. He looked very much like a gentile. He escaped to Warsaw and in Warsaw he was\none of the chief officers from the underground . He survived with my schoolmate.\nThey live now in Florida. The second incident was....",
        "A: Hundred (ph), and they were hanging. This wasn't over for the whole week, for everyone\nin ghetto to see it. The poor because it was a friend or a relative, and the stench...1f we do\nsomething, you know, to show us they punish. Not enough that they were shooting us.\nThey were hanging...after a a week, they removed them, and you know, they couldn't find\nthe commandant, uh a Jew to be a commandant of the police. They wanted a hi...a Polish\nofficer. They wanted that he should have been a pol...an army officer, so they brought a\nKariate from , whose family was in . In ghetto they gave him a Jewish\nname, uh a Mr. , and after that he left by train back to his family. He joined his\nfamily. This also I found out after I escaped from ghetto from, uh from Mundig I called\nhim, this Abraham Mundig, Abraham Ovitch. He told me about it. Now when we were in\nghetto, and I was left alone and it was cold...I didn't have any firewood. Some of our\nfurniture was in uh in a shack, so I took a chair and I wanted with a hammer to break into\nfirewood but I wasn't handy so I just had to break it. I cut myself next to my ankle and I\nwas bleeding. Later sets uh set in puss (ph) but I couldn't do anything because no doctors,\nno medication and this how I walked. Again, why I didn't die on gangrene and when it\nwas cured, it's again a question. So coming back to Mundig, being I was persona non\ngratia, parents didn't want...my...uh his mother didn't want me, I couldn't stay there. So I I\ntold Mundig...that uh I cannot stay there, so he found me a place to hide by a Ukrainian\npeasant. Ukrainian peasant had beautiful daughter. A lot of Ukrainian militiamen used to\ncome to visit her, and every time I had to run in the attic and to hide between the hay, and\nI said this is not the life for me. I don't want to be hidden there. But while, while I was in\na month later, Edmund Abraham Ovitch told me have to tell you some very sad.\nAnd brace yourself. Your father jumped from the cattle car by prying off the boards from\nthe floor of the cattle car, although they were pressed like sardines, and he lifted the\nboard and he asked who would like to jump with him, because more than that cannot be\nto let themselves down from the running train and run for their life. Only one girl...she\nwas from ...1 don't know her name...my age...wanted to go with my father. I\nguess the rest didn't want to separate. Sometimes there were families together. They\nwanted to die together. My father let themselves down. He got only bruised knees. The\ngirl was not harmed at all. He walked to our village, which was half-hour walking\ndistance where I was in and he entered a Ukrainian peasant's house. There was\nonly a woman. Her husband was still in the Russian army. She...1t was harvest time. She\nneeded field hands. Without questioning my father, she took in my father and the girl, the\ngirl posing as a daughter of my father. He tried to get in touch with me. He couldn't. He\ndidn't get any response. He couldn't live with the thought that his sheltered daughter 1s\nalone in the ghetto. He decided to board the train which is certain death penalty for any\nJew who boarded the train, to go back to ghetto to look for me. On the train was an\narchitect, a Ukrainian who used to buy lumber from my father, who was wined and dined\nin our house. Without any reward he went to the Gestapo...each train I told you was a\nand a Gestapo...and said I know this man. This is Dabbie Petranka. He's a Jew.\nThey took him off the train. They brought him to the mill on where they gathered\nthe Jews already to be shipped to the death camp. My father probably tried to get in touch\nwith me, but I was not there. So I'm alive, but my father was killed. (crying) So this 1s my\nstory. So when I didn't want to stay by the farm, by Ukrainian farmer, Mundig said to me,\nI'll get you a false labor certificate. You should have some document. His friend, a big\nanti-Semite that off-hand I don't remember his name...in my book that I am writing which\nwill be published in November...I, at that time I still remembered. I don't remember now.\nI know only that he was a student, second gymnasium which was known for the biggest\nanti-Semites. He was the director of , scrap iron (ph) and it was very important\nduring the War because they needed it, so he gave me a certificate that I'm employed in\nhis company under assumed name. Now I had to choose my name. My actually name was\nAmalia Petrankia but I'm not Jewish and not German, but everything was very important\nto be able to blend into the population. First impression's very important. My \"r\" is a\nFrench and German, but not a Slavic, and this was very dangerous, so I picked the name\nFelicita (ph) which means in Latin black, felicita and I picked the name of\nMewycheski who was my beloved uh writer. You see we didn't have heros baseball,\nbasketball, ballerinas...we had writers, and she was from Vilna (ph) so he put...he made a\ncertificate that I am Mewycheski, Felicita. I was careful to keep my birthdate, because\nwhen you are under stress, this is the first thing that you forget...dates...and I gave my\nreal...only my birthplace was Vilna, and now I became Felicita Mewycheski. With this,\nMundig took me to where I thought being it's a big city, metropolitan city, I will\nbe able to get lost there. He took me to his cousin's, first cousin's apartment which was\njust a studio apartment. Turn out his cousin was the king of the black market, the king of\nthe underworld. And they had only two beds. This was a terrible experience at that time\nfor me, a sheltered child. He slept with his mattress...uh mistress on one. I was supposed\nto sleep with Edmund on the other, and there were terrible, provocative remarks from\nhim. Mundig understood it's not for me, so he found me a place in a hostel...this\nwas...you see wives of Polish officers unable to be able to sustain themselves...they\nrented one room where they put beds, and this is where Poles who traveled slept because\nthe hotels were only for Germans. How little did I know that this is the day when they're\nclosing the ghetto in and they were searching in every hotel and hostel for Jews\nwho may have escaped from the ghetto. And after the curfew...the curfew was ten\no'clock...two Ukrainian police are coming to this woman's house and they with\nflashlight...you know...putting into our eyes, questioning everyone. They started with the\ntwo Polish girls but he didn't have any doubt that they are Christians. They let them go.\nThere's a woman with a child and I was there. One Ukrainian was busy with this woman\nand the child. I overheard...she had baptismal papers but from '37. She was a wife of a\nChristian judge, but she was converted, so they considered her Jewish because it was '37\nand they took her away with the little girl who was born already a Christian. The one\nUkrainian asked me questions. He said you are Jewish. Prove to me you are not. I, a\nproduct of Hebrew kindergarten, Hebrew schools, Jewish gymnasium...on top of it we\nhad a maid, a Jewish orphan...so I was never exposed to and all this. I didn't\nknow anything. I failed. So he told me to get dressed and he's bringing me to the Gestapo.\nOn the way he tried to persuade me that, to admit that I am Jewish and he will let me go.\nHow could I trust him? I thought he wants to have an easy job and to come, she admit it\nand, you know if somebody escaped from ghetto was even worse punishment...they used\nto let the dogs to tear them to pieces or they used to bill uh beat up to pulp. It was a\nterrible death, so when finally I reached the building, the steps of the Gestapo building, I\ndidn't have what to loose. So I said OK. And then I became very arrogant. You know,\nJude (ph)... was what, eighteen years old...I said go ahead...you spilled a lot of Jewish\nblood you have on your hands. There's a saying in Polish...go ahead...go...tell them I'm\nJewish. Kill me. He looked at me and start calling me with strong epithets, insulting me,\nand he said to me, go. I thought he was joking. He said go, but I don't want to see you\nanymore in because if I recognize you, I'll shoot you myself. How did I have the\nguts? I don't know. To go after curfew so another one will get me. I said how can I go?\nHe said, OK...what do you want now...and yelling...I said you should bring me back to\nthe hostel. He said no, I'll bring you back to the railroad station and disappear. At that\nti...at the railroad station was a lot of police. A lot of police, looking for for Jews and for\nblack marketeers so imagine - it was so dangerous for me. How I survived the night...it's\nanother miracle. In the morning I went to the woman where my belongings were there\nand at this hostel and I said you see, I'm not Jewish. They let me go. She said I don't care\nif you are or not. Take your things and get out. So . Where do I go? So I\ndecided to go to Krakow. This is one corner of Poland to another corner of Poland and in\nKrakow, this who was my father's boss, lived with his wife and a\ndaughter. They was very good friends of my parents...even they were invited to the\nwedding of my older sister, and I thought so I don't know if they will extend their help or\nhand and help me but somehow I felt they will not give me away. And being he was an\naristocratic family, I knew they would be in the telephone book. I will find them. In order\nto go to Krakow...we didn't have straight connections...I had to go to a city . L was\nlittle...how little I knew... was very important for Jews who try to escape to\nHungary, so there was a lot of police. I arrived. A lot of police. Past curfew. I couldn't\nsleep on the station. What do I do? There was a girl who had a newspaper stand. I\napproached her. I started conversation. She liked me, and I said look, what should I do? I\ndon't want to live on this station...like it's inconvenience, not that it was dangerous for\nme. And what should I do? She said you know what. Soon I'll finish my work. I live next\nto the station. I will take you for the night. I was so grateful. She didn't suspect. I slept\nthere. In the morning, I'm on the station. A young man, very well dressed _is\nfollowing me. Well, I didn't like, everybody, you know, took off their hat to him. He was\ntoo young to be so prominent, so at uh I got idea I will go to the ladies room. No\nman would dare to follow me there. I'm in the ladies room...I see his shoes in the main\nhall where each compartment is. I knew I'm finished. So I come out on the aggressive\nside, and I said how did you dare to follow me. Imagine what guts I had. How did you\ndare to...what kind of upbringing do you have? This put him in the defense and he was\nshocked. He didn't expect. He thought he'll find me timid with fear. So he questioned me\nand I told him...I said I will tell you my name and I'll introduce myself if you, you'll\nintroduce yourself to me first. Who are you? I said I have an aunt who is very sick in\nKrakow. I want to go to her to help her. He obtained for me the ticket railroad\nticket. Was a long line and he sitted me in his compartment like he would feel guilty that\nmaybe I suspect that he's police and he wanted to cover up for me. I took the train. We\nhad to pass through Tarnow (ph). Tarnow again police, and they light the flashlight into\nyou eye, and the fear in my eyes and the Gestapo man said to me, why is your voice\nshivering so much. And he saw the fear in my eyes. What could I say? I'm able if I don't\nunderstand German because you see mostly only Germ...Jews understood German.\nMostly Poles from the knew French but not so well German. Through\ninterpreter I said I wonder if you two will travel forty-eight hours, if you wouldn't be\ntired, if your voice would not shiver. He took it. He left so the Polish woman who sit next\nto me, she said, you know what. He took you for a Jew, she's telling me. And this was\none. Again another episode. I arrived in Krakow. At that time on the railroad station, I\nsaw a lot of Polish police and a Gestapo with the dog. But they were not searching for\nJews anymore. They are looking for Poles without valid, valid Polish working papers.\nMeans papers that they won't, don't work for the war, German war industry. The Polish\npolice recognized me immediately and they approached me, and they said you are\nJewish. What you are doing here? So naturally I was on the defense. I said how do you\ndare to insult me? Why do you do it to me? He said OK. If you are not Jewish...he started\nto again to question me from their New Testament. I failed. So they marked me and they\nsaid hah. He will finish you off, pointing to the Gestapo. I was resigned. I said my\nIsrael. I felt so alive, and I said OK. So I tried. But if not, I will join you and my parents\nand my sister. Enough is enough. You know, I felt like this. I felt light*hearted. I accepted\nit, and my feet were like glued to the ground. The Gestapo man checked all other papers,\nthen my turn came and the Polish police told him that I'm a Jewish, a Jewess. I had a bag\nin my hand. He requested...he took....told the police to hand him over the bag. He looked\nin the bag. I don't know what he looked for. He looked me up and down and he said to\nme why I came to Krakow. I told the same story. I'm a poor girl. My aunt is very sick.\nShe lives in Krakow. She sent for me. Through interpreter naturally. Where does she\nlive? I have never...I never was in Krakow, but like here, every time almost has\nBroadway. I said the street , which 1s after very famous Polish writer. You\nknow, he said . Means go. I didn't believe my ears. And I couldn't. You know,\nwhen a person is so resigned...I was ready to get uh you know, a shot...to be shot from the\nback. I said OK. He wants me to move, andhe_ ___ sent off the dog in the back who will\ntear me to pieces. I just couldn't do it. So the police, police said fall to his feet. Kiss his\nfeet. He let you go. I, we don't know why, in Polish. And like a robot I start moving till I\nleft the railroad station. I didn't believe that I will leave it alive. Why he let me go I don't\nknow. When I left the station, now where should I go now? It was Christmas Eve. So\ninquired about some...again a boarding house, a hostel who will take me. And I was told\none _ has aroom where he rents beds. He gave me the address. I came there and the\nsaid you see all beds are taken unless somebody offers to take you in, which with a\nsardonic smile, vulgar smile. And there was a woman, little older than I. I noticed the hair\nwas re...painted red, not her natural, with dark eyes. And she offered to take me into her\nbed. Immediately she recognized me that I'm Jewish and I recognize her. It turned out she\nwas a seamstress from Lublin (ph) who escaped and now she tried her luck as a gentile.\nWhat the night was terrible. You know what was going on on other beds? I had\nwonderful school of life (ph). She gave me a sign not to talk. Only when we were in the\npark we spoke. I told her who I am and she told me...she shared with me the bread that\nshe bought on the black market and I told her I am...the only chance I have...let me look\nup . We went to the telephone book. I found his address. I came over\nthere. His wife, Kashimira (ph), opened the door. When she saw me, she couldn't believe\nher eyes. She thought it's a ghost, and she closed the door. Then she opened it again and\nshe pulled me in, and I said I am Amalia Petranka, David's daughter. She started to cry.\nShe embraced me and she said look, I didn't recognize you. Let's see if my husband will\nrecognize you. If he doesn't, so maybe we can harbor you for a while till we'll find\nsomething for you. Her husband came. He didn't recognize me. She told him who I am.\nSo he said, I hate Jews, but for the daughter of David Petranka, I'll do every thing. Let's\nsee what we can do for her. Now this was the high life of Krakow. Every night bridge,\ndifferent companies, and being she was Armenian...again the Germans considered her a\nforeigner and she lived in a beautiful German neighborhood, so she had two little girls\nand she had a maid. She said to me you'll sleep with the girls and you'll...I'll tell the maids\nthat you are the new governess for the children, and I stayed for three weeks. And they\nfound for me in the newspaper a job as a housemaid to a , to Germans who\nhad children. And she gave me advice, to work for Germans because this is safer and they\nwill not recognize me. I got the job. The Germans liked me because they got a maid, you\nknow, from...a peasant girl who didn't understand German. I was very helpful. They\ntreated me quite good. They thought that I am Polish. And I developed here\n. It was abscessed with puss. So the Germans said it's not proper. We'll\nbring you to the hospital. I am a Jew, no papers. How could they enter a hospital, and I\ndidn't have uh the social card from uh from here like Medicare or some...I didn't have\nanything. But he was a big shot. He arranged. They accepted me. How little I knew.\nBefore the operation, a priest comes for confession. I didn't know how and what. So he\nstarted talking. So he said I see you're from the same town that I am. You're from\nLandberg (ph) and I am special accent in Polish. So he said how about...and now he\nwanted I should confess. I said, Father, how about if you'll sing for me a song, a very\nfamous song just from Landberg. This changed the mood, and he did. But I was afraid\nafter I will wake up or during when they give me anesthesia, I may spill who I am\nbecause usually what you do. I spotted a nurse who looked to me Jewish and I said look,\nplease, watch over me. Protect me. Why, she said. Because I'm Jewish and you're Jewish.\nNot I'm not Jewish. I said I don't care. Help me. And I showed her my leg, which was\nalready with gangrene and I developed lice last day in ghetto and I couldn't get rid of it. I\nsaid help me. And she did help. So she wouldn't do it if she wouldn't be Jewish\nmasquerading. And also, imagine how you can control your mind. Before even I woke\nup, they looked for my nightgown and I was able to point where it is hanging. Meantime,\nEdmund came to visit me. There, next bed to me was laying a Polish peasant girl by the\n. She liked me. She worked for a German casino. Means they were\nemployees, bookkeepers, everything for oil, from the oil company sent from\nGermany. Because they were by themselves, they had a casino, like a club where they\nlived, dined and then they went to the office. I said Kashimira, can you get me a job\nthere. I thought if it's a German place, the Polish police doesn't have any access. Where\nthey used to comb the houses in Polish sections searching for Jews and I will have some\nsecurity and a roof over my head. And one day a girl by the name Katia (ph)...I forgot her\nlast name...came to visit Kashia, so this . Kashia said, you know what. You're like\neach other. I notice you are educated. She's educated. You're alike. She's Ukrainian.\nKashia started talking to me. She recognized immediately that I am Jewish and I\nrecognized that she's Jewish, so she started, tried to stay away. So this chambermaid\nKashia said to me, I thought you liked each other. How come you dislike each other? I\ncouldn't tell her. We came to the casino. She obtained for me the job and I started as a\nchambermaid. I had to clean eight rooms, to kindle their fire and for this I have...she took\nme into their room and this, how I could stay and was safer. One day this Katia Ukrainian\ncomes to me and she says look...at that time she had a job as the chief manager of the\nkitchen, which was wonderful because she got food. She...and because of it she got a\nroom for herself. She said come to me. I want to discuss with you something. I said OK\nKatia, what is it. I came to her. She said look, you are Jewish. I am Jewish, and there is\nanother Jewish girl, Soshia (ph) who doesn't sleep in the casino. She sleeps outside but its\nvery dangerous for us. Because you are the last one, you are the one who has to leave.\nAnd she told me she was a medical student in Lamburg (ph). She comes from the\nand her husband's friends who who was a communist and was presently in Russia, gave\nher the paper as Ukrainian, a Ukrainian, and this is how she's surviving. So I said Katia,\nyou're right. By right I should leave, but I don't have a scrape of paper. Let me get some\ndocuments and I promise you that I will leave, but again when you have to do with nice\npeople, when Soshia who was the daughter of a lawyer from Lamburg, a little bit older\nthan I...she said I'm staying anyhow outside the theat...uh casino. I will go first. And then\nmy boss came to me and he says, he said you know, how comes you don't have an ID.\nHow come Anna cannot feed you because not having an ID you don't have any ration\ncards? So I had to apply. I wrote a letter to Mundig and I said I need baptismal papers\nbecause this is how you applied for ID. Dear Mundig, bless his sole...he went to a\nUkrainian priest, Catholic priest. So I got my baptismal paper. I'm Roman Catholic, but\nthe baptismal paper, the stamp was for Ukrainian church, Orthodox church. When I gave\nthe application to the police, they came looking for me. Who am I? What a contradiction.\nAnd they call it in the German and they summoned me to the police. Now I was\nthinking what can I do. Not to report to police means I have to run. Where do I run again\nwithout papers. To report, they will catch me and I'm gone. So then he said...I looked\nvery young, younger for my age than I was. I was always very petite. I had two braids\nand I prayed to God, the woman who'll investigate me should me an old maid or old man.\nSomehow they had some compassion for children, for young people. And I came there\nand she saw me...she said you know what, your priest got drunk. Look what the nonsense\nhe wrote. Write for another baptismal paper. But not I'm at fault, only this. I have done it,\nso Mundig sent me another with the stamp Roman Catholic and this I got legitimate ID\nfrom the police which meant a lot. No money could buy it, because this, you know, the\nfirst thing when they caught a Jew, they checked with the police, then they check with the\nparish, so I was...because of it I was able to get a labor card and I was able to rep...get a\ncard, you know, from uh , you know, to get health, health care. And I worked\nthere. While I worked there, meantime came the Jewess from Lublin who helped me. She\nlearned I'm there, and she cried...she doesn't have a piece of paper and they're\nsearching...she worked, she worked for a seamstress who gladly kept her for food for her\nlabor. But she didn't have any paper. Nothing can get . I give her my piece of\npaper. Not the ID still didn't have. Only Felecita Mewychesk1. Luckily this wasn't the\ntime of computers because immediately we both would be caught, but I didn't think about\nit. | knew I have to save her. When you're young, you don't think. And in casino, 1n this\nwas one . His mother was Jewish descendent. His grandfather was Jewish.\n. He recognized me immediately, and one day he told me I'll have to report to\nhis room. I said I don't have to report because Poles were forbidden to socialize with\nGermans. He insisted with a threatening voice. I knew I don't have a choice. I came up.\nHe presented me with a pic...a picture, a photo of a Jew and he said to me, this is\nmy grandfather. I thought he wants to provoke me. I thought he is from the Gestapo\nbecause each unit has also each office. I said what do you want for my life? If you know\nI'm Jewish, why didn't you report me to the Gestapo. He says cut it out. I want to help\nyou. I want to save you. First of all, you cannot work here. You don't blend in. You're not\na chambermaid with the coarse white features and everything. You must get out. I said\nhow can I get out. I need a roof. It was hard to get a room, and even...and I need a job.\nAnd no job will pay me for be able to pay rent and to sustain myself. He said don't worry.\nI will see what I can do for you. He knew an architect, a very big engineer from the\nrailroad authority, , ., Whose brother was the Commandant of\nBerlin while Hitler was shot there. The Chief Commandant. He spoke to him. He said,\nyou know many construction firms. I would like you to find a job for my fri...my Polish\nwho uh Polish acquaintance who is working in this place where I am now, and he\nobtained for me a job in a construction firm, but while I was in casino, they decided, you\nknow, the director of the casino was a a a brother of the secretary of Hans Frank and the\ncastle in Krakow. And he used to get his meals from the casino. I was the one\nselected to bring the meals, but to enter it I was checked and double checked and\neverything. I didn't have the papers. I couldn't get out of it. I didn't know what to do.\nLuckily, with this scrap of paper...before I had my ID, they let me through and I used to\nbring the meals to the castle. Imagine. With all the police guarding and everything, so he\nfound for me a job and , aconstruction firm which was located in\nand employed slave workers from __, Jews. And I...when I worked there, I\nsaid my goodness. I'm open now. I...maybe I can help the Jews by supplying them bread,\nmaybe potato. So I asked my boss, Wilhelm Langerd (ph) if he will permit me to go with\nhim on the , means where they were working there, not in the office, and just to\nsee how it's going on. He thought that I'm going for the gold, because he used to get gold\nfrom the Jews who were able to buy out their way not to work so hard only in the office.\nAnd one day he was in good mood and he took me to the office. I came there. The\nsecretary was Doctor Leibermann (ph). He was a ref...a German Jew who was\n. He introduced me. This is our secretary, Felecita Mewycheski and Dr.\nLeibermann looking at me said, you know what. Our secretary looks complete like my\nsister-in-law. So I couldn't go there any more, and the door door was closed for me.\nWhile I was working there they brought Czech and Slavic Jews in the cattle cars,\nto Auschwitz. I...the office was on a hill. Down were the cattle cars. How I as a Jewess\ncould take the screams and the cries for water. I was in the office. At that time was also in\nthe office a Polish mining engineer. He was a terrible anti-Semite and I took a pail filled\nup with water and went down to hand the water to the uh...they had the little windows\nwhich were . They were guarded by Ukrainian police with the bayonets. The\npolice approached me and said what, do you want to be killed to and threw the water.\nWith a broken heart I went up to the office and the mining engineer, with this smirk on\nhis face tells me...Miss Felecita, what will you be after the war? Then I knew he\nrecognized. I played dumb and I told him how do I know who I'll be. How do I know\nwhom I'll marry after the war, but I have to go ahead of time, after the war, when the war\nended, on the bus stop where I used to board my bus...here was standing\n, the engineer. I knew it. He comes over to me. He said, Miss Felecita. I\nrecognize you. At that time you gave yourself away, but I didn't have the heart to give\nyou away. I hated Jews, but I didn't have the heart to give you away. Another incident.\nWell, when I was working for this Wilhelm Langerd, I was masquerading as Miss\nFelecita Mewycheski. Ins was. a very elegant family, a widow and a sister by the\nname mewycheski, to whose house used to come my boss, the Nazi, the German, Mr.\nWilhelm Langerd, and she, hearing that this Mewycheski must be family, insisted on\nmeeting me. When finally I couldn't avoid it, I went there. Sure enough that she will\nrecognize and it's my aunt. I came over there. She pulled me all my face on all sides and\nthere she looked at me and she asked me who I am and I had a story that I prepared who\nmy father and so what, and she said you know you are not from the main line. You must\nbe from the branch of Mewycheskis in Lamberg and insisted that I should move in,\nbecause she felt responsible for a young girl to live on her own. Miracle again. Another\nmiracle. Well works till there by Mr. Langerd, the company paid five per\ncapita for every Jew for slave work to the Gestapo. In was Gestapo Miller (ph), a\nknown sadist. Tall, slim. With a stick in his hand he used to walk, and at at will, at\nrandom he used to kill, shoot at the Jews who were in ghetto, in . | heard of him.\nOne day whom do I see in the frame of the por...of the door - it was him. Then I had to\nthink fast. Did he come for me? No. He's too big to come for me. He could have sent\nsomebody else, but I couldn't take off my eyes from the two German Shepherds. They\nwere terrible. They were known that used to just to tear up Jews to pieces, so my eyes\nwere glued. He approached the desk, and he said, you don't have to fear. My dogs will\nsmell a Jew a mile away. So means you are not a Jew. What luck. And then he stated the\nreason why he came here. Another. I was never a secretary. I took humanities. I was\nsupposed to study medicine. I didn't know any secretarial work. When this that\ncommanded me to this guy, he told him. After a month my boss told me, you know what.\nI admire you. How come you grasp so fast, like a Jewess. Another incident. One day he\ntells me, how come that you have such Semitic eyes. What answer do I give him? To\ndeny? I will blush. I'll give myself away. Said, was probably nonchalantly, probably my\ngrandmother was a Jew. No one would admit because till third generation they were\nconsidered Jews. He thought that it was such a joke. He burst out laughing. This was only\nincident in one place. Why I bring them out...we are accused that you went by ship\nto Florida. It's not true. But there were many incidents and you had to be lucky not to be\ncaught, or killed because I was caught many times. Not to be killed. One more would\nhave, I would have been killed. Another one. When the Russians were moving close, the\nfront, they didn't have enough...the German soldiers. Many who built for war in say like\nthe bridges, railroad, toward the Russian front were excused for active service in German\narmy. Towards the end they needed everybody. So they also were drafted the workers,\nthe German who worked for company as carpenters and other jobs. So my boss\nsent me , which was a part of Gestapo, to excuse them for army service. I\ntold to my boss, how can I do it? Iam a Pole. They are not permitted to go there. Why do\nyou send me? He said, I give you order. You have to do it. Having no choice, I went. The\nGestapo at the desk greeted me with a heil Hitler. I was careful. I answered, .\nPoles were not supposed to say heil Hitler. I explained to him the reason of my coming. I\nproduced the papers. He took care of it, positively, and when I was supposed to leave,\nagain I said . And he said heil Hitler and he called me back. And he said, why\ndon't you say heil Hitler. Aren't you good enough to say heil Hitler? I said, I I said in\nGerman, I am not supposed to. What do you mean you're not supposed to? I said Iam a\nPole. He got so angry. He took the telephone and called up my boss. How did you dare to\nsend a Pole on such a sensitive mission. Another incident. There's another one. Railroad\nauthority had a big ball, and they wanted...the one of the chief ones whose wife was in\nGermany, asked my boss if I will be his company...companion. I tried to get out of it,\nbecause it was very dangerous and I was not supposed to socialize with Germans, and if I\nwould be caught, it's terrible. As a Pole and on top of as a Jewess. So I said to my boss I\nwill only go if you will tell him the truth, that Iam not ethnic German but I am a Pole,\nand if he wants to take the risks, because as well as for the Germans, if they are caught\nthey were sent to the Russian front. Then I will agree to go. I don't know why he did\nagree. I came to the ball. I didn't have what to wear. I had a black woolen dress with a\nvelvet rose here and I told him I can go only if you'll be a gentleman...when I feel very\nuncomfortable that you will take me home immediately. He agreed. There were\ncheckpoints. They checked but such a big shot, they didn't and say anything. I didn't\nknow that Frank, General Frank was inviting the also to this affair. You know,\nthe big shot, the . When he came, they all rise up and they introduced their\npartners. And this uh engineer, ... he was a very high official by the name I think\nBrown, introduced me as a par , you know, from this Baltic, from Lithuanian and\nso because knows what Lithuania. Frank looked at me and he said,\n. You know, and even if you don't get complimented directly to a\nperson, only . Means he picked the rose, and he said . Stupid me, my\nage, I said why only rose. Why not , means this...I . I guess he\ngot very impressed. He made a toast. I wish all the German girls will be like the\n. And I realized I went too far. I blushed, but this was accepted. Modesty.\nAnd I turned to my escort and I said I must leave. I'm not comfortable. Those are the\nincidents. There are many others. Towards...I then, when they evacuated I didn't want to\ngo with the firm to , | was assigned to , a tough organization. They used to\nbuild the ditches. Another incident. And every Pole had to give a week work for nothing.\nOne day my boss tells me there will come a watchmaker. He will give you two\nwatches. One for me. One for you. And you will excuse him for digging the ditches. The\nday comes. The man comes in. Who is the man? Anti-Semite Pole from , whom\nthe government transferred to Stanistlawow to Polanize it, who had a jewelry store street\nacross the street from me. When I saw it I bent down double, make believe that I have\ncramps and I run out. I waited till he's out. Then I come in and my boss said to me,\nnow because of you I lost my watch, because he didn't he didn't want to accept himself.\nThis was so so many incidents. There was____ recognize how I got away I really can not\ntell you. This is when I was in . Then I got a job and now I think I'll need to\nend because I don't think we have enough time. There was another construction firm\nwhich didn't evacuate. This is the construction firm of and Krause (ph). There I\nbecame a personal secretary to the boss, , who was Yugoslavian and the son-in-\nlaw of one of the owners of and Krause, . How little I knew that the\nfirm was assigned to build the barricades in Krakow to slow down the Russian approach\nand also to destroy historical buildings from Krackow and all the bunkers around the\nGerman buildings because this was after the Warsaw uprise from the Poles and they\nexpected it in Krakow. When the wasn't and ha...they had to evacuate back to\nVienna, he wanted to take me along. I said no, my place is my motherland, Poland, and I\nstay on. So he said...and then in that case I make you...I put you in charge of the office.\nThis was in middle of December and till we were combatively uh pushed away the\nRussian army will come back in March. Meantime here's the key from the safe and here\nare the checks for the employees and you pay...pay them out, and you should expect call,\na phone call for from some important papers. Didn't specify, didn't tell and I didn't know.\nAround...I think the thirteenth or tenth of January, when the German army was\ncompletely in retreat, I get a phone call from the Commandant from\nKrakow...means the high uh Commandant of the military uh military in Krakow, and he\nsaid is this the firm and Krause. I said yavol (ph). . Means dynamite\nthe . | put two and two together, and I understood it. And then I was thinking.\nWhat should I do? Had I been a German, I would have said my company evacuated and\nyou have to do it. I said what will happen to me if I fail to tell him...by this I would save\nthe Krakow from really being destroyed but I didn't survive now the war to loose my life.\nBut then I thought no...he didn't ask me for my name. He just said the company, and the\ncompany was still left...the daughter-in-law of the owner of the building who was the\nhostess of the company, the custodian and two chambermaids. I would never admit\nreceiving the phone call, and I called up the Polish underground which I joined while I\nwas a chambermaid under request of Kashimira uh and my link was ;\nAnd I gave them the message, happy knowing this is the end of the war. Two days later,\nsome Polish officers knocked at the gate of the building and this is while the German\narmy was in retreat, while they were bombings and even uh bombs uh uh hit one of the\nrooms...and I told the custodian and the Polish woman, I said let's not open the gates\nbecause it will be a chaos. This is a building where German companies were there. Many\nPoles will be free to plunder and our lives will be in danger till we explain who we are.\nAnd they listened. And then again I see another group of officers, knocked at the door\nand looking out the window I recognized one of the officers is definitely a Jew, so I\nthought from this quarter cannot come any danger to me, and I told the custodian to let\nthem in. They came in and among them was my husband...my present husband, but he\nwas in civil clothes and a leather coat...somehow he just likes me the most and started\nquestioning me angrily and harshly. I decided I'm not going to reveal him\nnow, with the armies in retreat. I have witnesses here, the custodian, the chambermaids.\nMaybe they will come back and I will be shot, so I refused to answer his questions and I\ntold him if you have any doubt who I am, please...here's my ID I took out and if not take\nme to your superior. My husband said I am the superior and you answer to me. I said no,\nI'm not taking any chances. I don't have to deal now with such anti-Semites now when the\nwar is toward the end, and I approach the officer who looked Jewish. I said do you mind\nto step in with me to the other room. I want to talk to you. Coming in to the other room,\nhe asked me who are you. I said I am the same thing who who you are. What do you\nmean? You are Jewish and I'm Jewish. He said how do you know it. In Polish it's a\nsaying...look at your face. From where are you? I said from Stanistlawow. From where\nare you? From Krakow. So he tells me....and from Krackow. I told him I had a\nschoolmate in Jewish gymnasium by the name of . By any chance do you\nknow this family? He paled. It was his first cousin. Jubilant, he comes back to the room,\napproaches my husband and says to leave her alone. Not only that she is not German,\nbecause they thought I'm German...not only she's not Polish, she's Jewish. So my husband\nwas sure that knowing him as a womanizer that probably I promised something all done\nand now he tries to protect me. So he moved closer to me, my husband, and he told me,\ndo you know any other language. I said yes. What other language do you know? I said uh\nEnglish, German, Russian, and I still didn't say Hebrew. Any other language? So he start\nasking me in English, what little English he know. What nation are you? I said I'm\nJewish. Prove it to me. How can I prove? So he said do you know Hebrew? I said yes.\nSpeak to me. I got so mad. I said, ; . So he couldn't believe.\nHe said how come this young girl can speak so well the Hebrew. Was probably the\nGermans who taught her Hebrew...she should spy on the Jews and get them out. Imagine.\nSo then he asked me when do we say . When he asked me about 1\nunderstood he's Jewish too. Excited with tears in my eyes, I said to him, you too? So\nnaturally then he knew. He switched back to Polish and from then he stated the purpose\nof his coming...that he came, they found out this is the company that build the barricades\nand built the columns and he wants the plans because he knows I was the secretary and I\nmust have it...the office in the building. I should give him to save the city because must\nbe a key how to detonate and how to neutralize it. I said why didn't you say it from the\nfirst place.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "A: So, then I told my husband, be my guest. You know, then I was really very light and very\nhappy and I invited him to go across the uh stairs, stairway because this is where the\noffice was. I opened the safe and I handed him the papers and he asked me who I am,\nwhat's my name. I told him who I am and then I asked him...first I told him Felecita\nMewycheski. He said no. Tell me the real name. My real name is Amalia Petranka and he\nsaid...told...gave me his real name and then he said, isn't this ironic that you, a Jewish\ngirl, were able...was instrumental in saving the city from destruction. I gave him the plans\nand since then we started dating and later...[ mean now we are married but I would like to\nadd a few more things, very important...how people in face of death and misery, still how\nthey were good and honest. My fia...Alec, who was my fiance, he applied for medical\nschool in Poland but they didn't want to accept him on and when the war broke\nout, when the Russians came, he got a job as a bookkeeper in the railroad uh on the\nrail...in the railroad authorities. And each one who applied for a job had to submit his\nbaptismal papers and a Russian ID. When the Russians left, somehow he kept one ID\nfrom a Ukrainian girl. She was just a few years older than I. In ghetto he came to me and\nhe said run for your life. Here are the papers, legitimate papers because first they check,\nyou know, usually the parish and you're covered and I know she moved uh evacuated to\nRussia. You're on the safe side. She's little older but age you can never tell, and take it\nand go out of ghetto. I said Alec, how can you do? This is worth so many thousands of\ndollars. Your mother is starving to death. Your father who was such a prominent uh Jew\nbefore the war, start...died of starvation. Your sister is starving, so why don't you sell the\npapers. I don't have many thousand dollars to pay you. I need some money for escape to\nhave it, so sell and make some money. He insisted I should take them and save myself.\nHe refused to escape from ghetto although he was really...his looks were like hundred\nAryans, not one but he didn't want to because his mother was on death bed and he didn't\nwant to leave her, and I found out that he committed suicide when his mother died. His\nsister Trica (ph) who was eight years his junior, was taken in by the family who was from\na small town...I think , I'm not sure, of ... Still, you know, a small\ntown...some Jews could pay their way and some Ukrainians or peasants harbored them\nfor money. So they took her and this is how she survived the war. Right now she lives in\nLong Island. You know, we had very . When the Germans came they proclaimed\nthat we are all are Communists, and we are...they are free to kill us. So within a year, they\nkilled us all. Actually the only survivors from our, from our town maybe are three\nhundred to four hundred, only who masqueraded as gentiles and like I who were not\ncaught and again I'm telling you it was very hard, because Poland was not a melting pot\nthat you could blend in easily. One reason or another there always were pitfalls. Some\nsurvived who were drafted to Russian army and they survived in Russia, because like I\nmentioned before, we didn't have any concentration camps. We didn't have any labor\ncamps. Only that came towards the end, when there was no room any more. And you\nknow what? During the war, many times I contemplated suicide. And I made and I\nresolved if Hitler wins, I cannot go on a life of flight, and I'll commit suicide. If he\nlooses, then I will not be an orphan left alone because I still had a sister, a\ngrandmother...my gran...my mother's brothers in Palestine and I will be united with them.\nAnd also there was a will, a strong will of destiny. My goal was to survive, not to let the\nGermans to rewrite the history. Although I was very young and I didn't have any sense of\nhistory at that time, but because they claimed that we all Jews were\nCommunists, and I knew how the world hated the Communists, so later if there will not\nbe eye witnesses...I didn't know that there are more Jews will survive...they will be able\nto claim that they only killed us because we were Communists. And this gave me the\nstrength to live. Another thing I have to mention...again goodness. This Katia that I\nmentioned, who was a medical student from Lamberg who posed as a Ukrainian, she left\nme to the job in the kitchen and she got a job as a housekeeper by a German physician, a\ndoctor, which was much easier, better food. When I worked in the casinos as a\nchambermaid, I was entitled to have week vacation. Where could I go? So, Katia\nsuggested to me that she will harbor me in their apartment. I will not be permi...natural\nable to leave, to make believe that I went home for vacation and then I will come back.\nShe endangered herself. She had to share her food with me. Goodness. Actually I must\ntell you that I the goodness of people. Jews whom I encountered, and non-Jews.\nBut whatever I could do, I have done the same thing. For example...",
        "A: But one more...good. But one more episode in goodness I have to also explain. Maybe\nthis part is on my side. When I graduated, (cough) we used to get tabloid (ph), picture of\nall the students. The picture was done by a photographer by the name Barchowski (ph),\nwho had the studio next to our building. One day I'm walking with Kashia on\nin Krakow to the garden. I see from har...far the Jew from Stanistlawow, Barchowsk1. I\nwasn't sure if he would recognize me or not. I ran towards him, embraced him and said\nmy name is Felecita Mewycheski. What's your name? He told me, and I introduced him\nto Kashia uh and he invited us to his studio. He started to date Kashia. I persuaded her,\nbecause he needed somebody to be...he slept in the studio by the Polish photographer. He\nmade us pictures. One day...he survived with his sister and his child...this sister put, could\npass for an Aryan, but the child not at all. Was five-year-old girl. One day when I was\nstill working in the casino, the sister came running, crying. And you know, there was a\nguard at the door. Not everybody...you...could enter the club. They asked for me. I came.\nShe said I'm Julia, Barchowski's sister. He was caught. And I cannot stay where I stay\nand I cannot sustain myself. What could I do? So I went to the boss and I asked him if he\ncan give a job to Julia, also as a chambermaid. Was dangerous, crowding again...two\nJewess and you don't know how she will behave. And about her daughter. I went to\nKashia . She was really a nice girl. I said Kashia, your mother has seven\nchildren. Would she take on Julia's niece, Barchowski's daughter and Julia will pay you\nwith her salary. After a month, her mother accepted the good little girl. The Polish police\nrecognized that she is Jewish and the mother writes a letter to Kashia...what did you do to\nme? You sent me a Jewish child. So Julia was in danger. I was in danger and the mother.\nLuckily the police took pity on the little girl and she...he said to the mother, I'm not sure\nshe is, but I'll let her stay in your place. The father survived. Barchowski survived in\nAuschwitz. He came back to Israel. We met him after the war. The sister survived. I had\nlittle trouble with the sister, because she like to drink a little bit, and it was very\ndangerous. I really...the last two months maybe also persuaded me to leave, and\nthe little girl survived, who's now married, lives in Israel, has family. So we really tried to\nhelp each other. Now after I met my husband, he was very busy at that time uh because\nthey're managing to take care of many Germans who were...and naturally he supplied me\nwith food, with everything. But what only...what he supplied not only me...he gave me\nclothes because this was the time in May when the Jews, slave laborers came out from\nthe concentration camp. Tattered stripe...what they had there, the or what.\nHe gave me clothes that he took from the Germans, that he conf...confiscated from the\nGerman apartment. I should give it out. Then there were many orphans that Jews started\ncollecting them, you know, who survived, looked, some knew where they have hidden\ntheir children, and one Jewess, although she converted, , she took care of\nthe children. But she didn't have food to feed them, not to dress them. And it came to my\nhusband's attention and he was able to supply them. What we didn't know...at that time\nmy husband was a high official in the Polish government in Krakow...so this\n, brought the children to Israel and she put his name, under the\nname that he was known at that time. It's a problem. So then he got a\ndeath sentence because he also searched for the , the ones that wanted to poison\nhim, that were so anti-Semitic. So I arr...1 was able to arrange for him a transfer to\nanother city. But meantime I wanted to study medicine. I didn't have any papers, so I\nhave to take exam that dismiss me from the whole subjects and he had connections and I\nwas accepted in Krakow but he was transferred to Breslau, so I dropped it. I went with\nhim to Breslau and I saw that this is under a satellite of Russia. I didn't survive the war to\nbe cut off again from my family. Even my husband with high position, I felt I'm a queen\nfor one night. This is not for me. So I told my husband I don't want to stay. We survived.\nWe have to go to Palestine, and my husband wanted to fight, at that time to join the\nJewish , to be able to fight for Israel. He couldn't obtain a legal permission to\nleave. He was told the only way he can leave or he'll be sent to Siberia or he should shoot\nhimself. The confidential (ph), the high position he had, he knows too many secrets. So I\narranged for him...it's a long story...an escape and he escaped and then I escaped with his\nbrother. I wanted with him, but his brother who survived with him decided that I have to\nstay with him, he should be able to liquidate the business which was not my place with\nthe brother, only with my husband, but he was young. This was an older brother sixteen\nyears, so he listened. I stayed. They kept us as hostages waiting for my husband to return\nto look for me. Luckily one Jew who know not my husband and me, learned about it, so\nhe guaranteed for me because they just kept me. I was in jail, but there was no sentence\nfor me. They just wanted him come to...for me and to catch him...",
        "A: The Pole...the police uh the uh , SO he obtained my release because I claimed\nI'm not my husband's wife because we were...got married on the real name, Amalia\nPetranka and Salsitz and he was known as and I as Amalia\nMewycheski (ph) so I claimed I was his mistress and this was the price I had to pay, so he\nobtained a release so my husband escaped. He succeeded and we arranged to meet in\nMunich. We met there and in Munich we wanted to go to Palestine. It was not a legal\nimmigration so my husband had his senior brother, twenty years older than my husband\nwho was...actually who was in Munich...this was before my husband was born...so we\napplied also for a visa to the United States and we felt whatever comes first legally we'll\ndo and so the papers to United States came first and we came here first, but in '49...and\nand meantime in United States I applied for job as a Hebrew teacher, and in '49 they had\nthe first chartered plane to Jerusalem, to the Hebrew University for the Hebrew teachers\nfor lectures, so we both went and this is where for the first time I was reunited with my\nsister, my grandmother, my uncles and my husband met his brother and met my family.\nUh first we didn't know. We wanted to stay in Israel. We felt we are young. This is where\nwe belonged. But my uncles advised me there were very hard times . Being that\nwe are young we should go back to United States, build our life in United States and try\nto help the family as much as we can. And this what we tried to do. About thirty times\nalready maybe we were in Israel. And after ten years, was born to us, to our eleventh\nanniversary, our daughter whom we named after my husband's mother and after my sister\nTeela (ph), Esther Teela. She became a lawyer and now she has herself three sons. She\nnamed each one after one of ours who were killed. And she and her husband, who is a\ndoctor, are very active in Jewish organizations and they try to keep Judaism...she sends\nher son, older son who 1s now seven, to school to keep up Judaism.",
