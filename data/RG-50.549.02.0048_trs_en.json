        "Q: Yeah, Ill be going back and forth a lot --",
        "A: Okay.",

        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: I just want you to --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: -- to talk a little bit. So maybe you could tell me about -- tell me about your neighbors.",
        "A: The neighbors? On the west side of our building is a married couple, childless as far as\nI know. He\u2019s a principal in a high school, and she\u2019s a -- and his wife is a libra-librarian.\nAnd we don\u2019t even know we have that neighbor. That\u2019s how na -- na -- quiet and nice\nthey are. On the other side, it is not as nice as we would like to. Is -- Did you already -- Is\nit already okay?",
        "Q: I think it\u2019s fine.",

        "Q: You don\u2019t have to tell me any gossip, okay, let me -- United States Holocaust\nMemorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection, this is an interview with Mr. Kurt\nThomas, conducted by Arwin Donohue, on June 22\" --",
        "A: 234,",
        "Q: -- is it the 23, I\u2019m sorry. June 23\", 1999, and this is a follow up interview to an\ninterview conducted with Mr. Thomas, by the United States Holocaust Memorial\nMuseum, on videotape. This 1s tape number one, side A. Okay, I\u2019m interested in starting\nwith you, this -- this date is a very significant date for you, can you tell me what this date\nis?",
        "A: Yes, it is 57 years ago, when my parents and sister were murdered in the gas chamber\nof camp Sobibor. In the early -- In the early hours of the day, as I know, being there later,\nthe whole procedure, how they -- how -- how it was handled.",
        "Q: Do you have a special way, every time that this day rolls around every year, of -- of\nrecognizing that? Do you memorialize them in a particular way\u201d",
        "A: No, not as -- not any specific way, although I -- I awake in the morning, on the 23\", or\nrather on the 224, already, when I saw them the last time, and think of them. I know I\nthink of them and of the events, daily, without wanting to even, it just come into my\nmind, and I am trying to analyze and study what actually happened, and why it happened.",
        "Q: You\u2019re still trying to -- You\u2019re still questioning on that level, is that what you\u2019re\nsaying?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t question any more, | think that I have my answers. I think I have my\nanswers. I feel that the German nation was misled, and that there is not only -- there are\ntwo entities who are guilty of mass murder. We know of the executioners, it was Hitler\u2019s\npolitical cronies, who went along with him, to eliminate the Jewish people wherever he\ncould get them. But anti-Semitism was -- or racism, whatever you want to call it, goes\nback centuries, many centuries, and the original sin was committed by Christians, by the\nchurch, which actually propagated, I would say the -- the persecutions of Jews, by\naccusing the Jewish people of whatever was convenient for them. For instance, up to\ntoday, the idea that the Jews killed Christ, prevails within a large segment of people who\ndo not know history. It is known, for instance, that the crucifixion was an act of erga --\nRomans. It was their law by which they -- by which they sentenced people to death. The\nJews stoned. And I want to tell you a very interesting story. I met, a year ago, a lady of\nthe name Anna Rubenstein, who wrote a couple books, I believe three books. She a foo --\nsurvivor of Auschwitz, and after the war, because of her English lang -- English\nknowledge, she got a job in a little town someplace in Germany, to help displaced\npersons, from all over Europe, of different nationalities. And she became responsible for -\n- I believe, if I remember well, for 8,000 people, and got a very responsible, big job there.\nOne day she got -- she was asked by a German doctor, whether she would come with him\nto inspect a ward of sick people in the hospital, which was also in that same s -- 1n that\nsame area where she worked. And when they entered a ward, a woman attacked her\nverbally and physically in Polish, and told her, \u201cYou are Jewish, you should not be alive.\nYou killed Christ.\u201d With this one sentence, this Polish woman told the whole story. The\ncurse on the Jewish people, which is a historical injustice, carrying on through centuries,\nwhich culminated this time in the Holocaust, but there were many events prior to that.\nYou can look at the Inquisition, the Crusades, at individual abuses of fuhrer, masters in\nEurope, in Russia, all over. Wherever Christianity was the main religion. And never was\nanything done on the side of the church, to dispel these wrong rumors, even up to today.\nWhatever that Pope has done up to now, is by far not enough. I think the church owes us\nan apology. They should -- stop it, please -- they should admit, confess, and atone for\nwhat they have done. I think this is what they owe us, and it would also elevate the moral\nstanding of the church, which up to today is only hiding and el -- and not coming out s --\ndirectly of what happened. There\u2019s another interesting thing which came into my mind.\nProtestantism was founded in Germany at least, by Martin Luther. Martin Luther\noriginally protested against the abuses of the church, by being bought off for money, and\nultimately was the founder of the Protestant movement in Germany. Although he was\nsensitive to what the abuses of the church, he took with him the anti-Semitism of the\nchurch, by putting his feces on the church, I believe, in Brittenburg, where he asked for\nthe banishment of the Jews unless they became Christians, and of their -- of killing them,\nwhich is very interesting, and that only sh -- tells me how great and how deep the belief\nof the Jewish guilt was implanted in not only the population, but also among the\nintellectuals of the church itself.",
        "Q: Let me ask you something. You\u2019ve been living in a Christian country in the United\nStates, for the last 50 years.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you feel that there\u2019s a danger of something like what happened during World War\nTwo, in Europe --",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: -- to the Jews again? Do you feel that anti-Semitism 1s --",
        "A: I -- I do not believe that anything like that would be possible again, and I want to\nemphasize today, in my own mind, a tremendous change in government -- in government\nforming of -- of laws. Originally, if a government persecuted people, oppressed people,\nkilled people, nobody interfered. At best -- There was an article in the paper, thanks to\nthe courage of our President Clinton, and to NATO, that a change in this attitude finally\ncame about, when we declared war on Milosevitch, who was oppressing his own people,\nand abusing the other minorities within Yugoslavia. This is a historical event of\ntremendous impact for the future. And I think we should call this the Clinton Doctrine. I\nam -- I am highly impressed and very satisfied and happy that this happened, not because\n-- not because of myself, but in general terms, for the sake of mankind.",
        "Q: You think this is the -- the first time that something like this has happened on a\ngovernmental level?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think, I know this is the first time, and never anything -- never anything like\nthat happened. Even, you have a case here with Pinochet. There is still a dispute whether\nhe is guilty or not guilty for killing people during the time when he was in power. Now\nthey figured out that he is guilty now only from a certain date in England, when they\nreversed their thinking.",
        "Q: Do you think that -- that Clinton\u2019s and NATO\u2019s actions in -- in Yugoslavia are -- do\nyou think there\u2019s a chance that they had anything to do with -- with Holocaust memory?\nLike if you\u2019re thinking back on what happened during the Holocaust and what -- what\nAmerica and the world did not do, there -- there -- perhaps there was pressure on the\ngovernments to actually take action now, in a way that they didn\u2019t then.",
        "A: Well, I believe that a few sensitive people might have been influenced by the tremen -\n- by the terrific injustice which happened during the second World War, toward the\nJewish people, and those who resisted the Nazi doctrines. But generally speaking, if -- if\nNATO, under the leadership of Clintons, wouldn\u2019t have done what they have done, the\nthing could have been again forgotten. As a matter of fact, from what I have been\nlistening, to stories about the -- memorials about the Holocaust and so forth, nobody ever\ntouched the church, which is guilty just as much as the Germans themselves, for what has\nhappened.",
        "Q: Talking about -- about faith, and -- and religion and -- and -- and the influence of\nreligion on prejudice, can you -- can you tell me the role that that\u2019s played in your life,\nand in -- in your own sense about --",
        "A: Oh, I -- I can tell you as far as the religion is concerned, I personally believe that\nreligions were necessary to raise the standards, the moral standards of the population.\nWhatever abuses happened later on, by trying to exert power over their own people, and\noppress others, this is a different story. Personally, I was raised in a home -- in a Jewish\nhome, by birth, but we were not religious. We kept a kosher house, because of my\nfather\u2019s father, who was a widower. When he passed away, 1n his early 80\u2019s, my sister\nand myself said, \u201cMom, let\u2019s stop that kosher deal, we want to eat everything.\u201d And that\nwas the end of the kosher household. Personally, I believe that Moses himself was one of\nthe greatest, if not the greatest statesman, by inventing the 10 commandments and giving\nthem to the people as a guide for morality, for life. And I also am convinced that Jesus,\nanother Jew, was another very great man, great statesman, who spread the teachings of\nJudaism in his own way, as a Reformer of Judaism rather than sticking to the old ways of\nthe Jewish religion.",
        "Q: So do you see them more as politicians in a sense, than spiritual figures?",
        "A: Oh, they were spiritual figures, but with a political result. And the spirituality is\nterrific, if you can believe in it, and important is that you should then do what they tell\nyou to do, what they wrote down that God said, but not whatever pleases anybody to his\nown advantage.",
        "Q: You were just mentioning a moment ago, off tape, about yo-you -- before the war, as\nyou said, you were an atheist. What did your experience in the camp, how did that\ninfluence your feelings about religion in any way?",
        "A: Ah the experience in camp only confirmed my conviction that there is no God, that it\nis people who make their life, for other people, either nice, or miserable. And anything\nelse is just an individual need. Some people need to believe that they will go to heaven\nafter they die. I believe that I will go -- after I die, will be either co -- cremated, and that\nwill be the end of -- because I don\u2019t believe in -- either in heaven, nor in a purgatory.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back. I wanted to -- t-to bring us back to the beginning of your life. You --\nYou mentioned -- Why don\u2019t you just tell me what your -- your name was at birth --",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: And tell me something about your original name.",
        "A: My original name was Ticho, T-1-c-h-o, which is an old family name, which goes back\ninto the 13\" century, in Boskovice. There were, according to the chronicle which I read,\nlong before the war, but which I cannot locate now, and I tried to ask people to find it,\nthere were originally, in 1492, that was the year when Columbus discovered America,\nthree Jewish families living in Boskovice, under the castle. Their name was Horvald,\nStefanski, and Ticho. The-There are very interesting things. One of the people who\nsurvived the war, was Mr. Ignatz Horvald, who was married to a Gentile woman, and he\nwas, at that time, when the war broke out, he must have been in the late 60\u2019s or early 70\u2019s\nand somehow the Germans didn\u2019t even intern him, at the end of the war, what they did to\nevery other member of a mixed marriage. He survived, and he lived in the same section,\nwhich is mentioned in the chronic, under the castle. Now, at my time, there were my\nfamily Ticho, then there was a company of the name Brothers Ticho, which was owned\nby two brothers of a family of 13 children, two daughters and 11 sons. They were not\nrelated to us, we did not acknowledge any relationship between us. Then there was a third\nTicho, Max Ticho senior. To distinguish it from my father, Max Ticho junior, who was\nthe son of George Ticho, who also did not acknowledge any relationship to the other two\nTicho families. During the occupation of Czechoslovakia, there came to Boskovice,\nanother man of the name Ticho, a tailor who lived in Vienna, but originated in\nBoskovice, and then came to Boskovice, my father\u2019s cousin, from a little town called\nSwitofka, and these were all the Tichos, as far as I remember. But I met in Vienna,\nanother Ticho, his name was Franz Ticho, a tailor, who came f -- or his parents came\nfrom Marish-Ostra -- Morifska-Ostrava, to Vienna. That 1s all I can tell you about th-the\nTicho roots in Boskovice.",
        "Q: Wa-Was your father born in Boskovice?",
        "A: My father was born in Boskovice, yes.",
        "Q: Your grandparents?",
        "A: Also, Joseph Ticho.",
        "Q: So you -- you would be pretty certain then, that you are ru -- descended from the\nTichos who were --",
        "A: I -- lam convinced of that, that my roots go back into that Ticho family, which was\nmentioned in that little chronic.",
        "Q: Have you been back to Boskovice?",
        "A: Once, yes, after the Communists left -- were expelled f-from the government in\nCzechoslovakia, I went back. I was there. I went to the cemetery, I went to -- to see the\ncity, I was with my high school chums, we had the dinner together -- rather, a lunch\ntogether. It was a nice meeting.",
        "Q: High school chums meaning non-Jews, or -- or survivors?",
        "A: They were non-Jews, yeah, there was -- there were no Jews left. As a matter of fact,\nsome 443 people, if I am exactly to the -- to the exact number, were deported on March\nthe 14\" and 15\", 1942. Of those, seven came back alive. The Hanak family, with Mr.\nHorace Hanak, his wife Greta, and their daughter Vera, they survived in Theresienstadt,\nbecause he was maintaining the water works, or work -- or works -- worked on the\nmaintenance of the waterworks in -- in Theresienstadt, and the Germans needed the water\nfor themselves, is where three people. The fourth was a Mrs. Clara Stickelmacher, who\nhad some kind of a job, and survived, was four. Eric Brill, who lived today in Frankfurt,\nwho survived Dachau. Mitzi Brown, a sister of Mrs. Hanak, who survived Auschwitz and\nother camps. She is still alive in Bernau today in the capital of Moravia, and myself. And\nI would like to ask you to incorporate my original family name, so that it would be -- it\nwould be part of my name, like Kurt Ticho Thomas. Thank you.",
        "Q: What was it like to -- we\u2019re jumping around chronologically a little bit --",
        "A: Oh, that\u2019s alright.",
        "Q: -- but we\u2019ll go back and catch things, but while we\u2019re on the subject, what was it like\nto return to Boskovice and meet all of these people who you had been friends with before\nthe war, but who\u2019d suf -- had not -- you know, you -- your pe -- your family had been\nwiped out, what di -- what was that like?",
        "A: Well, to that point, I want to -- I want to bring out a very pleasant yet painful\nexperience. I came to Boskovice with the -- with the Czech Legion, which I joined in\nSaragura, 1n Romania in 1944, in the fall of 1944, and I was home with my unit on May\nthe 12\", 1945. The transport stopped on what they called the Walhoff hill, where the city\nstarted. And as we stopped with our trucks, I jumped off the truck, and out came from the\nfirst house, a woman. And she looked at me, and recognized me and said, \u201cWhere do you\ncome from?\u201d And I says, \u201cI fell down from heaven.\u201d And she crossed herselves and run\nback into the house. When we were f -- in Boskovice for a day or two, the commander of\nmy unit, a Slovak mayor -- major -- major, not mayor, major, came to me and says,\n\u201cSargent Ticho, I know that this is your native town. If you want to stay here, you can be\nhere as long as you want to, just join us, our point is Prague.\u201d I says, \u201cMayor -- Major, I\nappreciate your offer, but I can\u2019t stay here, because when I look around, in the windows\nwhere I knew all those people, they are gone. And I rather go with the unit to Prague.\u201d",
        "Q: I think we need to back up. You -- Just to remind you of where the last interview\nended, you had just talked about, in your video interview, after you had escaped from\nSobibor, you found your way back to Piaski, you found your way back to the home of the\nfarmer --",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "Q: -- who had been so kind to you.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And they hid you again, and -- and you described that you were hiding in -- in a pigsty\nor a --",
        "A: Yeah, I -- I was on the attic of a pigsty.",
        "Q: Tell me about that year, or however -- how many months was it that you spent there?",
        "A: Well, I escaped from Sobibor on October the 14\", which was a Thursday, 1942. And I\nslept in the forest called Sobibor. Soba in Polish means an owl, and bor is a forest.\nSobibor means actually the forest of the owls. I slept in the forest and the next morning --\nno, the same evening yet, Chaim Engel approached me to go with them. When I say with\nthem, with his girlfriend Selma, her name was Weinberg, from Holland. I figured where\nthey are two, the third one with be superfluous, and I thanked them for the offer and I\nwent my own way. W -- I -- I was sorry that my f -- girlfriend, also from -- from Holland,\nand it was Minnie Katz, did not come out, and I would like to tell you the story what\nhappened before. A couple days before the uprising, I asked Minnie to get herself boots.\nAnd she says, \u201cIt\u2019s still warm, what do I need boots for?\u201d So I says, \u201cIt might get cold\nany time now, please get yourself boots.\u201d And she went into the -- into the warehouse\nwhere the boots were located and got a pair of boots. I didn\u2019t want to tell her about the\nuprising to upset her, because I figured, at the time, she will come back into camp one\nand we will get away together, but unfortunately she didn\u2019t make it. So, that night --",
        "Q: Can I ask you a couple of questions about that before we go on?",
        "A: Go ahead.",
        "Q: You -- You met -- Did you meet Minnie in camp?",
        "A: In camp, yes. Minnie came from Westerbork, from Holland, being discovered in\nhiding, and that\u2019s how we met. She was a very well educated lady. She spoke Dutch,\nEnglish, French and German.",
        "Q: And you were able to carry on a -- a courtship with her in the camp?",
        "A: No, after work, we had a f -- a couple hours, so we -- we -- we spent time together.\nBut courtship, you cannot talk of any courtship, 1t was just th-the be-best we -- we -- we\nsat together, we talked to each other. When -- We rem-remembered things, and at one\ntime, Minnie said to me, \u201cDo you think that we will come alive out of here?\u201d I says,\n\u201cMinnie, my brain tells me no. My heart tells me yes.\u201d She was of a very nice\nbackground. She told me that her parents sent their money from Holland to England,\ninstead of going themselves. And I believe that none of their relatives survived.",
        "Q: You lived in -- in camp one, in Sobibor, is that right?",
        "A: Yeah, you see, the camp was divided into four parts. Originally three, later on four.\nCamp one was where the ramp was where the victims were brought in on -- by railroad or\nthrough the gate by truck or walking, whatever. And also, it was the living quarters of the\nGermans. Camp two was the sortier section, where you sorted clothing, and whatever. In\ncamp one there were also all the trademens shops, like tailors, shoemakers, carpenters,\ngoldsmith. People who worked on mechanical things, what-whatever. And in ca -- camp\nthree, was actually the gas ca -- gas chamber and the cremation -- cremation, not\nchamber, 1-it -- it was, as far as I na -- heard, done on roasts, on steel roast, where they\nburnt the people. And then later o --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: Go ahead.",
        "A: It was in 1943, probably in the early summer, when the Germans established another\nworking s -- working spot, or whatever you want to call it, where mostly women were\nemployed in cleaning ammunitions of the enemies -- of the, in our case, of the Russians.\nThat was camp four.",
        "Q: Okay. I want to ask you something about that, because you mentioned the -- the\nwomen cleaning ammunition --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- in connection with the uprising --",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: -- and -- and the plans for the uprising. And I\u2019m interested in hearing more about how\nyou knew about the plans for the uprising. Y-You --",
        "A: Well, one day, a fellow of the name Feldhandler, I forgot his first name now --",
        "Q: Leon.",
        "A: -- came -- came to me -- do you -- what did you say?",
        "Q: Leon.",
        "A: Leon Feldhandler came to me and asked me whether I would be willing to cooperate\nin an uprising which is being organized. I says, \u201cLeon, I am risking my life every day by\ncheating on the Germans in s -- in stealing medications and covering up for sick people. I\nwill do anything what is necessary, but I would not like to go into any meetings.\u201d Now,\nfor the uprising, they also wanted the women to bring hand grenades, but they didn\u2019t\nbring them the first day and they were afraid to bring them the second day, and so the\ndefinite date for the uprising was set for October the 14\", because a day or two later,\nSharfuhrer Wagner, the most brutal, and I would say the -- the -- the most intelligent one\n-- not by education, but by s -- by nature, by character, was coming back and we didn\u2019t\nwant him to be there. We wanted -- wan -- wim -- we wanted to do it before he came\nback. So that wa -- that was the day, Thursday, October the 14\", at four o\u2019clock. It started\nbefore four o\u2019clock already.",
        "Q: Let me ask you this. I had been reading in -- in the book by Yithzak Arad, are you\nfamiliar with the -- the book on Sobibor --",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Belzec, Treblinka. Well, he mentions in this book that the -- that the uprising was\npostponed, that it was originally planned for October 13\", and it was postponed for the\n14\",",
        "A: No, it -- it originally planned for the 12\". 12\" and 13\", and the 14\" and we did it.",
        "Q: So I\u2019m -- I\u2019m interested in hearing more of the details of how -- how you knew what\nyou knew. Did -- Did Feldhel-handler keep you abreast of what was going on --",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: -- even though you weren\u2019t in the meetings?",
        "A: No, I did not get any information from any more, but the news leaked through and I\nknew that we are preparing to get hold of the -- what they called wuffencummer, which is\nthe chamber of weapons, which was a wooden building in -- 1n the what they called four\nlager, in the -- that part of part of camp number one, before you got into the -- that part\nwhere we slept and where the artisans had their shops. And once we get hold of the\nweapons, we will walk out like a armed unit, and that would have been the end.",
        "Q: So it was your impression that the prisoners in general, knew about the uprising and\nthat most people were aware of --",
        "A: I -- I would say that it leaked through. How many knew, I have no idea. For instance,\nMinnie Katz did not know, because otherwise she would have probably done something,\nand I didn\u2019t tell her. I feel guilty about it, but I can\u2019t change that any more. And there\nmust have been -- there must have been some people of non-Polish, or non-Russian\nethnicity, who probably did not know what was going on, because the -- the uprising was\nentirely in the hands of one Russian officer, and a group of Polish -- other Polish Jews,\nand they didn\u2019t trust anybody else. They treated me as an exception.",
        "Q: Why do you think that was?",
        "A: Because I proved through my behavior that I\u2019m not a traitor, that I was helping\nanybody who needed help and I could do anything for him. By which I mean -- I believe\nit was in March -- end of March or beginning of April, 1942, when Dr. Subeese, Dr.\nNink, and Dr. Breslev. Breslev was Polish, Nink and Subeese were Dutch physicians.\nBreslev was a specialist for dentistry, but he was still an MD. In Europe you had to\nbecome an MD and then specialize in dentistry. And th-these men came to me and told\nme they heard a rumor that the Germans will allow the Jews to be sick for three days.\nAnd they said, \u201cProviding that would happen, we would like you to take on the job.\u201d I\nsays, \u201cOkay.\u201d It didn\u2019t take long, and during the appelle, Chaffearal Fransel, I guess, who\nI testified in Hagen, two times and once in Frankfurt, I believe -- Frankfurt or col --\nCologne? I don\u2019t know now, which one of the two cities -- told us that they are looking\nfor somebody who will take care of the sick. And I raised my hand and he said, \u201cWhat\nkind of a qualification do you have, or how -- how can you do that?\u201d So I lied to him and\nI told him that I was a sanitary non-com officer, in the Czechoslovakian army, and I got\nthe job. Now since I knew that Jewish people can be sick now for three days, as soon as\nsomebody was not able to go to work -- prior to the point of course, if you couldn\u2019t be\nable to -- if you were not able to go to work, they took you what they called in the -- into\nthe Lazarette, and they shot you. Pardon me. So I wrote down, for instance, Arwin\nDonohue got sick on June the 22\". So you -- w-we --were legally sick, allowed to be\nsick, 22 - 23 - 24. On the 25\" and you still were sick, I threw that old card away and\nwrote a new one. And that\u2019s h-how --",
        "Q: How did you throw it away, did you have to burn it, or did you --",
        "A: I didn\u2019t -- That -- That was my own -- my own invention, my own set up, nobody told\nme. But it was good that I had it, because at each appelle, at noon time and in the\nevening, they counted us. And they knew, as an example, that they say are 480 inmates.\nNow, they counted and they\u2019ve howd -- only 472. So the -- then they said, \u201cKurt, how\nmany sick?\u2019 I said, \u201cEight.\u201d In most cases, they accepted my number, but sometimes they\nwent to the barracks and all the sick one had to come out, to double check, and that\nFransel did it that way, and Wagner, he never let them come out, but I had to come with\nhim to the door of the barracks and call the name, and the sick one had to answer, to\nmake sure that there is no cheating. Now, through my function, actually, I\u2019d had to save\nmy life. There was a fellow of the name Leon Friedman, he cames from washa --\nWarsaw. A ve-very nice young fellow, maybe 19 - 20 years old. He developed -- but I\ntold you this story already.",
        "Q: Yeah, this is on the -- this is on the other tape.",
        "A: So why should -- why should I repeat it?",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. I didn\u2019t want to interrupt you. But, let me see. You did tell that story, you\n-- you, and we\u2019re just kind of filling in on a few things that -- that I was interested in\nhearing more details about. And one was, so you -- you mentioned about the -- the\nwomen with --",
        "A: Who were supposed to be [indecipherable]",
        "Q: -- who were supposed to be --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Was that something that had just filtered out in the same way?",
        "A: I doubt it. That I doubt.",
        "Q: How did you learn about that?",
        "A: I found out about that when they postponed for the first time, the uprising -- the date\nof the uprising, why it was postponed. But I don\u2019t remember who told me, that I don\u2019t\nknow.",
        "Q: Okay, okay. I had read something -- the reason that I\u2019m asking about that is I had read\nsomething that said that the date was postponed because there were a group -- an\nunexpected group of SS officers, from Osova, who came into the camp, and that was the\nreason why it was postponed. Do you think that could have anything to do with it?",
        "A: [ha -- I -- [remember something about that, but I don\u2019t remember any more. I\ncouldn\u2019t give you any detail, I would only made up as -- make up a story, I don\u2019t want to\ndo that.",
        "Q: That\u2019s fine, that\u2019s fine. Okay, you talked about your escape. I had one more question\nabout Minnie. How did the SS and the camp personnel respond to romances,\nrelationships, inside the camp?",
        "A: They were not, at the time -- First of all, 1t was not during working hours. After\nappelle, after we came back from work and we are counted once more. I don\u2019t know\nwhether we were counted after work, in the evening or not, I don\u2019t remember now. But\nanyhow, we got our coffee, and 10 people got a loaf of bread and maybe some\nmarmalade, whatever, out of beets. That was the end. There was no German with us any\nmore, in -- on camp number one. And by nine o\u2019clock we had to be in our barracks to go\nto sleep, and that -- that was the end. But say from seven til nine, although I was busy\nwith working on people who had cuts, or bruises, whatever, you know, with bandages,\nand -- and so forth, dispensing aspirin, whatever. That was the time when we could\nassociate among ourselves.",
        "Q: So you -- you had a little bit of --",
        "A: A little bit of --",
        "Q: -- freedom and leeway in that.",
        "A: -- yeah, yeah, in that. As a matter of fact, I would say today, in retrospect, that 1t was\nthe German\u2019s negligence that it -- that the u -- that the uprising happened at all. Th-They\nwere So -- so content with that -- wi-with the run of the mill, that that was not -- not\nenough, I would say, diligence on their part, for which I am very happy, although they\nwere still brutal in killing. But 1-in other words, I would say they -- they missed\nsomething, th-they -- otherwise, 1t couldn\u2019t have happened. I mean, it was very cleverly\nput together, how to -- how we got rid of the first of the -- all 11 of the SS men, you\nknow. But somehow, there was something missing on the diligence, on the -- to find out\nwhat\u2019s going on among the Germans.",
        "Q: Another question related to the uprising. You mentioned when Leon Feldhandler came\nto you --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- and asked you --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- if you would be involved.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And you said that you -- you were involved in being a medic and that that was enough\nof -- of a risk and you didn\u2019t want to t-take that chance. How did he respond, did he\naccept that? Was he understanding?",
        "A: He accept it without any -- without any remark. When we -- we parted, we were ver --\non a very friendly basis, respecting each other.",
        "Q: Okay. I had asked you early on -- you described in the first interview how -- how you\nescaped and how it happened that you and -- and Otto --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Came to return to -- to the farmer\u2019s home. Can you tell me -- First of all, you\nmentioned that you and Otto parted ways. Did you -- Do you remember that moment of\nmaking the decision to -- to go on your own way, and f -- and to separate from him?",
        "A: No, no, that is a misunderstanding. When we arrived, on Monday the 18\", on the -- on\nthe outskirts of that little village, Selishkey, we set down in a ditch, because it was still\ndaytime, and the -- the dusk was coming in. And I told him under the w -- on the way,\nunder those -- during those four days, the whole set up with the farmer, his family life,\nand what I did there, and gave him a complete information. As a matter of fact, I gave\nhim even some money on the way that if he would have chance to buy something, that he\nwould have some money. I then, when it got dark, I simply decided, \u201cYou wait here, and\nI\u2019m going to find Pocharlie\u2019s house.\u201d And as I walked maybe 20 - 30 steps, there is the\nbarn of his estate. So I passed the barn, and there was the dog, Caesar on a chain, and he\nlicked my hands when I came to him, he recognized me. And then I walked down to the\nhouse. Excuse me, I have to powder my nose.",
        "Q: About --",
        "A: Oh yeah, I stopped --",
        "Q: You mentioned you were -- you went and, Caesar, the dog [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes, I went into the yard, and opened the little gate of -- which was surrounding their\nthatched roof house, and looked into the kitchen through the kitchen door, where they\nwere eating dinner, and on a -- with a petrol lamp. And a little while later -- it was pitch\ndark, it was a cloudy day -- cloudy -- cloudy night -- a little while later, the homeworker -\n- his name was Joseph, opened the door and went down the two or three steps to the gate\nand left, didn\u2019t see me. And it dodn -- didn\u2019t take long, and the farmer came out on the\nusual routine, to check the barn, whatever, and let the dog loose. And as soon as he\nopened the door, I whispered, \u201cKoss padashu.\u201d That means in Polish, farmer, but it\u2019s --\nit\u2019s a title at the same time. And he recognized me immediately, and he says. \u201cWhere do\nyou come from?\u201d And I says, \u201cI escaped from a camp and I came to save my life with\nyou.\u201d And he says, \u201cMarno.\u201d That means in vain. And then he says, \u201cCome with me.\u201d\nAnd --",
        "Q: W-Why do you think he said that, in vain?",
        "A: Because he probably wasn\u2019t ready to -- to keep me. And then, as we walked toward\nthe -- this stable, the horse stable and the cow stable, he said to me, \u201cI owe you some\nmoney.\u201d From that you can see what an honest person he was. I sold him a suit in which\nhe took a picture with his wife. I have that pic -- I have that picture, and I says, \u201cI don\u2019t\nneed any money, I have some money.\u201d And then he says, \u201cBut allete samiastish.\u201d That\nmeans, but you are alone, with an emphasis on the but. And I said, \u201cYes.\u201d Because I\nfigured out right away if I would have tell -- told him that we are two, that my chances\nwould be even smaller. Today I know that I was thinking of Otto, but he was thinking of\nEmmie, my friend from Piaski, who once in awhile came out onto his farm in summer,\nand sunned herself on the lawn someplace, and then in the evening we went back together\ninto the ghetto. And he wanted probably to know whether Emmie is with me. That --\nThat\u2019s where the misunderstanding, and it came into my mind only much later. Anyhow,\nwe came to that stable. He says to me, \u201cYou wait here,\u201d and went out and locked it from\nthe outside -- the door from the outside. I couldn\u2019t get out. After awhile he came back.\nBrought me a bottle of hot -- hot tea, or hot coffee, if you may -- want to call it coffee, it\nwas chicory with milk. And the bread, which they baked every Monday, for the whole\nweek, but they break fo -- they bake one loaf of sweet bread, and then I told you, I\nbelieve, in this story, too, which was a mixture of poppy seed and sugar beets and white\nmea -- white flour, while the rest of the bread was rye -- wy -- was rye bread, dark rye\nbread. So that he gave me, and he spread on the f -- on the floor, in the straw there, a little\nhome-woven carpet and said, \u201cI come to see you in the morning,\u201d and locked the door\nfrom the outside, and that was it. I had no way to get back to Otto. Early in the morning,\nhe took me -- he opened the door from the stable and took me across the ya -- across the\nyard in the barn and says, \u201cCrawl up there someplace and hide.\u201d Which I did. In the\nafternoon, when I was really rested, I came down, and later on, Mrs. Pocharlie came with\nanother bottle of hot tea and two big slices of rye bread with lard. And that was the first\nfood I had on that day. And she told me that at night, partisans came and wanted their\nbicycle. So I put one and one together and figured that I told Otto that Toidya, their\ndaughter, Theodora, commutes on a bicycle from Selishky to Piaski, where he -- where\nshe worked. And he must have been -- come into touch with them. That is my theory, but\nI believe it makes sense. When I came back after the war, I tried to find Otto, whether he\ncame back into his native town of Chabeetch, in Moravia, but nobody knew of him, so he\nmust have perished during the war.",
        "Q: Do you think about him?",
        "A: Yeah, I think about him once in awhile, but I didn\u2019t know him too much. He came into\nthe camp, maybe only with the last transport from Bialystok, which must have been two\nor three weeks before the uprising. There came a few Czech people, he was one of them,\na fellow of the name Shtasni was another one, and otherwise, I -- I don\u2019t remember any\nmore. But hi -- While he were -- While we were already in the forest, he just came to me,\nand he says, \u201cIll go with you.\u201d And that\u2019s how it happened.",
        "Q: Tell me more about the time that you spent in hiding. How long were you in hiding in\nthat pigsty?",
        "A: I was in hiding from Friday -- no, from Monday, October the 19\", until the very end\nof July. And I know it was the very end of July, because my late sister\u2019s birthday was the\n20 - 24\"\". I knew the date once in awhile, because my farmer threw up to me, a paper\nwhich he bought in Piaski, whenever he went to Piaski. And that gave me the date, and I\nknew when a Sunday was, because there was quiet on the -- on the yard. Th-The pe --\nThe f -- The farmers did not work on that day. So I knew on the 24\" -- the 24\" of July, I\nbelieve was a Saturday. I would like to check this out that Iam right. And on that day, on\nthat day, a tank went through the yard, which was the way into the fields, and also to the\nmain road to Piaski. And I remember being in the straw there, I hear a noise coming\ncloser and closer until everything was shaking. And I went through to the straw roof and\nlooked through my little peephole, and there I saw a tank going through and leaving. That\nwas the 24\" of July, I believe, on m-my sister\u2019s birthday. I would like to check whether it\nwas really a Saturday. And then, a few days later -- then there was shooting, and\nwhatever, which I dis -- already mentioned in my report originally -- in the interview.\nThe --",
        "Q: Actually, we don\u2019t have anything in your interview on this -- on this time, so --",
        "A: No?",
        "Q: Yeah, you -- you [indecipherable] into details.",
        "A: Then I will -- Then I will tell you what happened.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: A few days before that tank already came, I could hear far away, artillery shooting,\nartillery cannon. Then later on, I could also hear machine guns. And then that -- one day\nthat tank went through and a day later, I believe, I see a commotion in the yard from my\nvanta -- vantage point on the attic of the pig sty, from which I could see almost the whole\nlength of the yard, not what was beyond me on the side where the barn was, where the\nbarn started, but down there, yes. And there I see that my farmer, in a hurry, is putting the\nhorses 1-into the wagon and she was bringing out stuff of the ho -- from the house, to load\nit on the -- on the cart. And then suddenly I could hear bzzzz, like a whistle, and then an\nexplosion, and that was a sharpnel. And the farmeress stood there with a mug in her hand,\nand when she heard that noise, she crossed herself and got really pale and was beside\nherself. And her husband -- and they were a nice couple, he came to her and he says,\n\u201cThose,\u201d -- I could hear it, \u201cThose which you can hear, they are not dangerous. Those\nwhich you don\u2019t hear, they can kill you.\u201d By wi -- By which he mine -- m-meant that\nthose which he hears, they are flying far away. And then they disappeared. Now, from\nToidya I have later found out that they spent two days in the forest, hiding. And after they\ncame back one morning, I can hear a noise, a commotion on the yard. No, before that,\npardon me, I-I am -- I am going too far ahead. Then a group of Germans -- soldiers came\ninto the yard and disappeared within three or four hours. As a matter of fact, there were\nU-Ukrainians among them, mostly Ukrainians. And one of them opened the door to the\nshack, from which you then could get up onto the roof of the -- of the pigsty, and was\nlooking around there what\u2019s going on, and I's -- I -- how do we say, crawled on my\nstomach to the edge. Luckily, he didn\u2019t hear me, and when I saw him, it was a Ukrainian\nsoldier, one of those who actually guarded us in the camp. I slowly, but without any --\ncausing any noise, retreated and -- back, so that he wouldn\u2019t see me.",
        "Q: You mean one of the actual s-soldiers? One of the same people?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: And I can tell you, I heard my -- my heart poin -- pounding 1n ma -- in my -- I\nremember that like today, that 1t was the lucky day, because that was the crucial time.\nShortly after that, the Russians came. And he then left -- And then they left. Suddenly\nthat -- the -- got a command and they left. They were retreating. Then one morning, I\nlook out, and I can see a lot of commotion again in the yard, and there were carriages\nthere, with one horse between two like wooden shafts, with little carts. And there were --\nthe soldiers were mostly women, big busted, short women. They were Russian women\nsoldiers, who now were in the yard. And I think that they disappeared either the same\nday, or the next morning. And then my farmer came to me and says to me, \u201cDon\u2019t come\ndown yet. Wa -- Let\u2019s wait a couple days or so.\u201d Which, I was a -- wh-which I agreed\nupon. And then when he told me, then I came down and left -- or when I -- when I came\ndown, we star -- we stood at -- it was around noon time, we stood at the barn. And he\nsays to me, \u201cYou know,\u201d he knew that I wanted to fight the Germans, \u201cthere\u2019s a Czech\nlegion someplace. It is in pon -- Pordales Pordalsk. There you could join them.\u201d",
        "Q: Stop here and flip the tape, change.\nEnd of Tape One Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number two, side A, of an interview with Kurt Thomas.",
        "A: Kurt Ticho Thomas.",
        "Q: Kurt Ticho Thomas.",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "Q: I\u2019m trying to --",
        "A: I think I stopped telling that I came down and we stood together at the barn. And Mr.\nPocharlie told me that there is a Czech legion, with headquarters in Communist Poldalsk,\nwhich 1s, I think the Ukraine. And I thanked him for saving my life, and I was sorry that\nhis wife wasn\u2019t there. And I told him, \u201cYou raised yourself a son.\u201d And I hugged him,\nand I left. He had -- Oh yeah, pardon me, he also told me, \u201cDon\u2019t go through the village,\u201d\nwhich is characteristic of the situation as he knew it. And he said, \u201cBecause, if they\nwould know that I saved a Jew, they would not -- they would now kill me.\u201d And by that\nhe meant his -- his villagers, which is another proof how deep the anti-Semitism was\nimbedded in the Polish population, generally. Although my -- my lifesaver was an\nexception. And I think these exceptions should be remembered someplace, so that the\nstigma of generalization would be punctured.",
        "Q: Was your lifesaver ever honored in any way?",
        "A: Yes. Mr. and Mrs. Pocharlie were named as -- were -- were honored as Righteous\nGentiles during a ceremony in -- I believe in Warsaw, on my -- on my re-request.",
        "Q: Are they 1-in yadva -- by Yad Vashem?",
        "A: By Yad Vashem, yes, by Yad Vashem. As a matter of fact, I have seen the tree with\ntheir -- with -- with the little what 1s it, the little metal plate where their names are listed,\nand they are -- their name 1s also listed among the maybe 15 or 1800 Polish Righteous\nGentiles who saved Jews. And by the way, I want to mention that there are more Jews\nsaved by Poles than by any other nationality, at least in Yad Vashem, at the time I was\nthere. There was not one, as far as I remember, mentioned from the Czechoslovakia.\nThere might be some, but I haven\u2019t seen them.",
        "Q: So do you think that it\u2019s -- So often we\u2019ll hear about the anti-Semitism of Polish\npeople. You -- Do you think that that\u2019s exaggerated?",
        "A: No, it is not exaggerated. It is actually and unfortunately a truth, a sad truth. But there\nwere a few who were -- very few, who had character, who had compassion and courage.\nThis is what ven -- was needed. You know, the Mrs. Pocharlie always addressed me\nMister. These people treated me unbelievably respectfully. I did my best to work for\nthem, but I think in that respect, they are an ec -- an exception to any other savior.",
        "Q: How do you -- Di -- Have you tried to explain that to yourself? How it 1s that they\ncame to be the way that they --",
        "A: They\u2019re -- They\u2019re -- They were just plain very, very nice [indecipherable] noble\npeople. You know that he -- After I had to leave their farm because the Germans gave\norders at the end of October, that no Jew can work out of the ghetto any more, and I --\nwhen I came -- before I came back, she told me I should hide behind the farm, and when\neverything will quiet down, f -- I should b -- I come back out again and that we will kill a\npig and eat pork and cabbage during the winter, then in spring the Mister will be able to\nwork with us a-again. But, in spite of that, I went back to the ghetto, and while I was\ngoing back to the ghetto, there was a Polish peasant with a bicycle and he was\nintoxicated, he was drunk, and couldn\u2019t use the bike, so he used it more as a support and\nhe s -- yelled to me, he says, \u201cJakog dat yadesh,\u201d Jewboy, where are you going? And I\nsays, \u201cI am going to the ghetto.\u201d He says, \u201cDon\u2019t go into the ghetto, they\u2019 Il kill you.\u201d\nThat was his warning to me. While I was a few days in the ghetto, somebody told me that\nI should come to the fence, to the barbed wire fence. And when I got there, I see my\nfarmer with his horses alongside, and as ha -- as soon as he spotted me, he lifted a s --\nburlap sack and threw it with a heave over the fence, and took his whip and he whipped\nthe horses to get away. He gave me in that sack, I found a lard and potatoes. And if\nanybody would have seen him on the German side, I wouldn\u2019t be here, and he wouldn\u2019t --\nand he wouldn\u2019t have lived to the end of his days and died of a normal life.

        "Q: Tell me about your contact with him after the war and -- and what became of -- of\nthem, and of your contact with their daughter.",
        "A: A-After the war, I didn\u2019t have any contact at all. I left Czechoslovakia at the end of\nJanuary of 1948, or -- or -- or middle of \u201948, yeah, for England and sailed on the Queen\nMary from Portsmouth, and arrived in the Uni-nited States on February the fourth, 1948.\nOn the boat I wrote a card, or a letter, to the Pocharlies, and forgot all about it, until\nToidya, with who I am still in touch, told me that she would like to find that piece of\nmail, but she never can find it. And then I started to correspond with -- with them in\nPolish and in Czech, and they answered in Polish and then later on, the Pocharlies gave\nup their farm and moved to Lublin to the daughter, and there they died. And then the son-\nin-law started to study English and from then on, we started to correspond in English.",
        "Q: Did the son-in-law study English so that he could communicate with you?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Was that his motivation?",
        "A: That\u2019s what -- That\u2019s what I understand that he did it, because of that. Maybe he had\nother -- Maybe he had other reasons, too, but to me he learned English, because he\nwanted to help his wife to stay in touch with me and make it easier.",
        "Q: You mentioned that at first you were communic -- you were writing to them in Czech\nand they were writing to you in Polish?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: How did you communicate to each other verbally?",
        "A: Polish, because I learned a little Polish while I was in Poland, and it\u2019s a Slavic\nlanguage, and I had a -- I think I have some talent for languages, so I caught on. As a\nmatter of fact, while I worked on th -- first on the farm and then later on for him, at noon\ntime, we took those things which we smuggled out of the ghetto of Piaski, to sell them in\nthe village. So we went from house to house and we started to talk to the people and\nthat\u2019s how we learned a little more Polish.",
        "Q: Going back to the issue of la -- or staying with the issue of language for a little while,\nyou mentioned in your first interview that your -- your father was a German n -- speaker.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And that you spoke -- you learned German in the home and you learned other\nlanguages as well, and it sounded as if Boskovice was -- had a lot of German speaking\namong the Jewish community there.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What -- Did you speak German in the home?",
        "A: Yeah, we spa -- spoke German in the home and I will give you the historical reasons\nfor this. Mora -- Czechoslovakia was originally part of the Austrian-Hungarian\nmonarchy. And the Jewish people were very grateful to the -- to Franz Joseph, I believe,\nwho came out in 1848, with some rights for the Jews. And one of the -- one of the strings\nattached were that the Jews have to go to Jewish school -- to German schools, to help\nGermanize the non-German speaking regions. Now, Boskovice was about 8,000 people,\nof which there were probably 350 - 400 Jews. There were more deported, because many\ncame from other towns at the time of the deportation, to Boskovice. So we spoke at home\n-- my father had only Jewish -- German schooling. My mother had German and\nHungarian schooling, because she came from Slovakia, which was under the jurisdiction\nof the Hungarians. And I considered myself a pure Czechoslovakian because my mother\nwas Slovak and my father was Czech. I am the only Czechoslovakian who escaped and\nsurvived Sobibor. I don\u2019t know how we came to this. Yeah, the -- the historical reason\nwhy we -- we spoke German, but in 1918, when Czechoslovakia was formed and I was\nfour years old, there was still a German school. But in 1920, the German school was\nclosed, and by the way, it was not attended only by Jewish children, z -- but also by some\nGentile children, whose parents wanted them to learn German.",
        "Q: Did anyone in the Jewish -- Did you speak any Yiddish in your family?",
        "A: No, no. We didn\u2019t talk any Yiddish at all, we spoke only German, and I went to Czech\nschools and then later on, we spoke Czech at home. But originally, my mother language\nwas German.",
        "Q: Was the Jewish community in Boskovice generally pretty assimilated? Did they not\nspeak Yiddish or Hebrew?",
        "A: Nobody spoke Yiddish in the community, with the exception I know, that our cantor,\nMr. Gross, he spoke with his wife, Yiddish. And I really don\u2019t remember whether the\nrabbi spoke with his wife Hungarian. He came from Slovakia and he had Hungarian\nschooling. Or, whether he talked with her j -- Yiddish, I don\u2019t remember that. But the\nBoskovice Jewish population spoke only German, and had only German schools.",
        "Q: And did your father idealize Germany in any way, or was he germ -- did he -- you\nmentioned that he spoke German, did he also feel --",

We had in our home, pictures of Victor Adler, who I think was the head of the\nSocial Democratic party in -- in Vienna, and another one, Shoemayer was his name. I\nremember the names and these pictures were in our house and my father was a devoted\nGerman S-Social Democrat.",
        "Q: Was he very shocked by the developments in Germany after the rise of Nazism?",
        "A: Well, he was not only shocked, disappointed and -- but what could he do, I mean,\nthere were many more people who considered themselves Germans, or were 1n the sense\nof Hitler\u2019s, real Germans, and still did not go along with national Socialism.",
        "Q: Did you -- Did you --",
        "A: But they did not -- nobody ever thought that it will come to a organized extermination\nof the Jewish people. Nobody ever thought of that. As even I, I found out only when I got\nto Sobibor, after a day or two, what\u2019s happening.",
        "Q: That must have been an incredible shock.",
        "A: It was, it was. As a matter of fact, for about two or three days, I didn\u2019t want to talk\nGerman. And I don\u2019t know -- I think I mentioned it in my a -- interview in Washington,\nD.C., after I was taken out from the ranks of those who arrived that day, around 3,000 we\nwere, fr -- between the ghetto from Piaski and Izbitsa, they asked for textile experts and I\nraised my hand and I was taken out. And in the afternoon, I was already sorting the\nclothing of those who came with me.",
        "Q: Yeah, you did talk about that.",
        "A: But before I even start working, while we were getting soup, I see there a girl who was\nwith my in Piaski and worked with me in Selishky, on that -- on the estate of that Polish\nnobleman who fled to England. His name was Bertha Collek. The same name as the long-\nstanding -- long and well-known mayor of Jerusalem. That was Teddy Collek, and her\nname was Bertha Collek. And her father happened to be the mayor in a little village not\nfar from Bernau, in Dumborshitz. And she came to me and I says, \u201cBertha, what\u2019s going\non here?\u201d And she says, \u201cKurt, be happy that you are here. The other people will have it\nmuch worse than we here.\u201d And with that she left with tears in her eyes.",
        "Q: How did you find -- I mean, realizing what was going on, that you were in a death\ncamp and that -- that you were just being kept alive for economic reasons, how did you\nfind the -- what gave you the will to -- to survive at that point?",
        "A: Well, you remember when, under Eisenhower\u2019s government, when Kruschev was in\nRussia at that time, the political boss, we had a spy in the air in a -- in a drone plane like.\nI forgot his name now. That man was -- landed -- I think he was shot down and landed\nalive. He had with him cyanide pills, I believe, to finish his life, but he didn\u2019t. And\nKruschev at that -- that time said, \u201cShtoji ott, horchesi ott.\u201d Whatever is alive, wants to be\nalive. And that was with me and with all those others in the camp, too. We hoped that it\nwill not u -- be us. Gary Powers, I think was the name of that f -- of that pilot. You\nremember the -- the thing, no?",
        "Q: No. Tell me about -- we were just talking about your father and your -- and his\npolitical orientation.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And I -- I had -- 1t reminded me of a question that I had. You mentioned that at one\npoint, he was arrested early on in the war.",
        "A: Oh yes, he was arrested and they wanted him to inform about the Gentile population.",
        "Q: Do you know what made them think that he knew anything about that?",
        "A: Well, he had -- he was close with -- with a few Gentile people, and I believe that one\nof the Germans, local Germans, told the SS that my father might be the one who would\nbe able to give them some information. The man I think who I have in mind was\nEstelberger. And that is a very, very characteristic story. Before 1918, there were actually\ntwo political entities in Boskovice. One was the Jewish community and the other one was\nthe non-Jewish community. We had our own mayor, and our own police department. And\nthe policeman was this Mr. Estelberger, who was brought in from Austria to become the\nJewish policeman in Boskovice. That guy became a good Nazi, and I believe that he gave\nthe Gestapo the information about my father. He didn\u2019t survive the war. I -- I think that\nhe committed suicide. He had a daughter who had a son, his name was Alphonse Becka,\nB-e-c-k-a, with a little hook on the c. Becka means a barrel. Mr. Estelberger forced his\ndaughter\u2019s husband, his son-in-law, to become Germans, by which the grandson,\nAlphonse, became -- became liable to serve in the German army, and he lost his life,\nshortly after the war, in Russia. He paid for being a good German, Mr. -- Mr. Estelberger.",

And he did it and he brought\nit back to him in his -- in his store, whatever. I didn\u2019t know anything about it. When I\ncame back after the war, I went into this Mr. Kosheneck\u2019s store. And I said hello and we\ntalked a little bit. And then I says -- And then he offered me whether I would need leather\nfor soles. I says, \u201cThanks, Mr. Kosheneck, I don\u2019t need any.\u201d And then he says, \u201cI also\ncould give you hen -- honey.\u201d Because he was a beekeeper, that was his hobby.

He\u2019s,\n\u201cNow, put your hand into the opening, and to the left.\u201d And there was another opening --\nano-nother drawer, another handle, I pull this out, and there were a few jewels which my\nfather left with him. That\u2019s how decent the man was. There were other people where I\ntook stuff of ours, and either got back half, or nothing. But that was the unfriendly Mr.\nKosheneck, you know? He had character and he was decent.",

        "A: Karl Bruell, B-r-u-e-l-l. If I didn\u2019t mention this, then this is a big omission that is very\ninteresting. One morning, when I went from camp one, into camp two, to pick up some\ndrugs -- I was allowed to get cotton, iodine and salves. As I go -- walk through the lawn\nthere, whatever tha -- it was, there I see a little pile of clothing. And as I got closer and to\nit, I see on top two pictures. One was the wedding picture of Ilsa Bruell and Ziegfried\nLerfber, my friends. And the other picture was of Ilsa Bruell and her two younger sisters,\nRuth and Lydia. And then there was that little -- pardon me -- that little pile of clothing.\nSo I knew that they came at night, and they were shot right away, of course, and had to\nundress and they left it there. Now, when I came back to Boskovice, the father of the\nthree girls, Karl Bruell, survived because his second marriage as to a Gentile woman.\nAnd I slept in his house and he asked me when he can expect his children.

        "A: When I left the farm, after hugging my -- my gospardash Pocharlie, I went past the\nbarn and into the field, and there I was approached by a Russian soldier, with a automatic\ncarbine and he asked me who I am and I tried to tell him in Czech and he finally let me\ngo. And I went through the fields 1n a big circle, and came to Piaski, where I have seen\nthe city half destroyed. Horses on the street blown up, dead of course. And then I joined a\nhuge crowd of people which were walking, and I walked with them, I don\u2019t know where I\nwent. I know only that from the time I left Selishky, and arriving ultimately in Saragura\nin Romania, it took about six weeks. When I first found Communist Poldalsk, in the\nUkraine, and there the railroad station was destroyed, the city didn\u2019t exist, actually, and\nsomebody told me that -- I don\u2019t know who, that they moved, the Czech unit moved to\nSaragura in Romania. Now I had to go to Romania. At one time I got caught by Russian -\n- by Russian soldiers and put together with German prisoners of war, into a train. At\nanother time they kept me with Germans prisoners of wars in a barn. I remembered one\nnight I slept in a little farm 1-in -- in the stable with the cows. But I cannot tell you how I\ngot either to Communist Poldalsk, nor to Saragura. As soon as I was in Saragura, I\nsomehow changed my whole mentality. I must have been absolutely depressed. And\nwhen they took my clothing -- I had a pair of pants and boots -- shoes, and wouldn\u2019t give\nit back to me, I started to raise hell, because they were ma-making money on the clothing.\nAnd I forced them and [h -- I had a fight with them, and I -- the first day, I got it back.",

And there were warehouses, or sections in a warehouse, where there were boots\nfor men and children\u2019s shoes, and men\u2019s pants and men\u2019s coats, whatever. And my new\nwinter coat was in another building, where they -- where we -- the sorters, were f -- were\ninstructed to deposit it there f-for their own benefit, because they then took it to\nGermany, so -- with so many other things. So, I had a pair of britches, beautiful black\nboots, which the Russians took away from me and gave me another pair of bad boots.\nAnd then they took those away from me, another Russian, and gave me regular shoes,\nwith laces. So I cut off the front and put the money which I had had, into the lining of the\nshoe, because I figured these shoes, nobody will take and I will keep the money.

But here, I was under -- among\nstrangers, I didn't know the language, nothing. Yet, I made it. And this is what I\u2019m\nwriting him, this Mr. Ribol, the director of the museum, because he wants to know all the\ndetails from my youth on, and what happened during the war and where I was and -- and\nI tell him that, it\u2019s an absolute blank, I don\u2019t know, couldn\u2019t answer that.",

        "A: I hope, I hope. But I tell you what happened, why I say I hope. A few years ago, I\nwrote an answer to a historical book written by a fellow of the name Professor Bronsky,\nabout the Jews of Boskovice, and there were quite a few misstatements and anti-Semitic\nhints, and I wrote a letter, happened to be 14 pages again, and I succeeded through my\nGentile friends in Boskovice -- the local paper wouldn\u2019t print it, because I told them what\nI know about the Gentile people in Boskovice, how they behaved, almost like gen --\nGermans. A -- My professor of Latin\u2019s son joined the German army, and then he got --\nthen he disappeared -- it was one of them, but I had quite a few cases, where I told him\nwhat he didn\u2019t know, or what he didn\u2019t want to publicize, and the paper wouldn\u2019t\npublicize this. So then my friends arranged for having it in the museum, to visitors of the\nmuseum, and I sent them one issue, covered in plastic. Now, I found out later on again,\nthrough this Stanick, that the thing disappeared. Allegedly for historical reasons, they are\nstudying it. And in the letter to Ribol, I\u2019m writing now, also, \u201cI hope that it came back,\nand tell me why they took it away in the first place.\u201d I never got an answer from him yet.",

The tailors were home tailors, they took the stuff\nhome to sew it and bring it back to us, and I got him merchandise, I got him business\nfrom Vienna, and from Stuttgart in Germany, because I knew perfect German, how to\nwrite and I wrote to the Chambers of Commerce, and these people didn\u2019t have labor, but\nthey had some materials, so we are fini -- we were finishing it for them, and the tailors\nfrom the little villages around, which did the work for us, they were very grateful to me,\nand were bringing me illegally food, like butter, eggs, chicken, whatever.

These three people went into the -- on Ellis Island, into\nthe political section. I went into the Merchant Marine section, for an additional\nexamination.

And he ordered sandwich,\nand then I asked him how much I should tip, and how much I should tip in the check\nroom, and all that. And he brought me to the Pennsylvania gr-gr-grandel -- the\nPennsylvania railroad station, the Grand Central Station. And there I took a Pennsylvania\ntrain to Pittsburgh, where I arrived around one o\u2019clock at night. And in the meantime I\ncalled -- pardon me -- I called from Ellis Island yet, and he actually put the call through\nand I sat down and before I could sit down, it rang already. I was amazed, because I got\nthe call immediately. In Czechoslovakia, when I was calling somebody 20 miles away, it\ntook a half an hour before I could be connected. So that was the first pleasant surprise, h-\nhow communications work.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s back up a bit. Can you remember where you are if I interrupt you?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. I wanted to ask you a little bit more about your trip. How long did it take to get\no -- to get across the ocean on the boat?",
        "A: The ocean? Two ye -- Two days longer, 48 longer -- I believe five days, instead of\nthree, or six instead of four. I don\u2019t -- that I don\u2019t know any more. That was the old\nQueen Mary.",
        "Q: Do you remember what your thoughts were on that trip, what your expectations were\nof this country?",
        "A: I was -- I was -- I was happy that I was -- that I was going to America. I slept together\nwith another fellow, down in the lowest quarters, on a berth above him. And he was born\nin this country, but fortly before the war, his mother came back to Slovakia, his father\nwas still here. And then he came back again as an American citizen, but he didn\u2019t speak a\nword English. So I says, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d He told me in Slovak, of course. He\nsays, \u201cConnecticut,\u201d and the city, he forgo -- I forgot now the city. He pronounced it, the\n-- the -- the phonetic way, as it is written, you know, that was so funny, today. At that\ntime, I didn\u2019t know better, either. I forgot the name of the city.",
        "Q: What languages did you speak at the time?",
        "A: Czech and German, and a little Polish. And a little -- I learned a little Jewish in the\ncamp, too, from the Polish Jews, you know.",
        "Q: No English at all?",
        "A: No. Oh, I -- very little, I mean, I tried to learn English, but this was all forgotten.",
        "Q: But you were excited to be coming to America?",
        "A: Oh yeah. So then, when I arrived, they were waiting for me, my aunt, my uncle and\nmy cousin, they had the DeSoto car, and they took me home in the -- into their house, and\nit was a nice little house, in the campus of the Carnegie -- the Carnegie Technical\nInstitute. And I was going to med -- I was going to English elementary school with little\nkids, for about six or eight weeks. And then I went to high school, Taylor Alderdise High\nSchool in Pittsburgh, and then during the summer, I took summer course, again in the al -\n- Taylor Alderdise High School, and because my uncle didn\u2019t want me to go to work until\nI get a little bit settled, and he was so good to me, like a father.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Leo Steiner. That\u2019s -- There\u2019s his picture. That\u2019s the man. And then he -- I got a job\nthrough my cousin\u2019s wife\u2019s father, who had a store with pants, and through the salesman\nof the company for who he was buying, I got the job as a cutter, in Beaver Falls,\nPennsylvania. I had to get up at five in the morning, to be, by 6:30 or so, in the railroad\nstation, Pennsylvania, Lake Erie railroad, to get to Beaver Falls before eight o\u2019clock, to\nget into the plant. And then, in the evening I rushed home, and twice a week I went to the\nUniversity of Pittsburgh, to get English history and English. And there were two veterans,\nGIs who copied my work.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: \u2019'm not kidding you. And when I came back home from school, I was so tired that I\nbarely ate my dinner, and lied down, and the next morning, again to the railroad station.\nAt the end of the year, before Christmas, they gave me a box of candy and told me I\nshouldn\u2019t come any more, because they are closing up the plant, which I was so happy\nthat I didn\u2019t have to go back to that work any more. Then I had other jobs, 1n a -- ina\ngrocery store, in a umbrella shop and again in a pants factory. I mean, that one I was\npacking rather than cutting. No, I was working in the cutting room, too. And also in -- in\nthe -- in the room where we put orders together. And from there I went on the road with\nready to wear, through the help of a Miss Bertha Strouth -- Strouse was her name. Sh -- H\n-- She was a buyer in a -- one of the department stores in Pittsburgh, and through friends\nwho I made in Pittsburgh, their name was Albert and Laura Davis, they wanted to help\nme out of my menial jobs, and through them I got acquainted with her. She acquainted\nme with a salesman who didn\u2019t want to travel in Ohio. He wanted to travel only in and\naround Pittsburgh. So I took his line on, and that\u2019s how I met my wife, because she\nowned with her brother a little ready to wear store, ladies ready to wear.",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: Her name was Tina Zacks, Z-a-c-k-s.",
        "Q: And -- And when was this that you met her?",
        "A: I met her in 1953. In 1952 I started to travel, in 1953 I met her, in 1954 we got married\nand I moved to Columbus, and then my ankle -- uncle and my aunt moved also to\nColumbus. That was his sister, they were brother and sister. She was a widow, and he\nwas a bachelor.",
        "Q: They must have -- So, did they come for -- because you were here?",
        "A: Yes, yes. They came here because I was here.",
        "Q: Tell me more about your relationship with them in the early days. Were they -- Did\nyou talk to them about what your experiences had been during the war?",
        "A: Well, we were always a very closely knit family, my mother and her four siblings.\nOne brother came here already before the first World War, but I never saw him because\nhe died before I arrived. And then Uncle Leo, who took over. His sister, with two\nchildren from Vienna, when Hitler came in there. And -- And then I had the two cousins\nhere, and another cousin who lived close to Pittsburgh, and they tried to make my life\nvery nice. I have a very nice relationship, they were very kind to me. And I finally\nAmericanized, you know, and became, I hope, a good citizen.",
        "Q: Did you talk to them about what did happen to you during the war?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah. As a matter of fact, when I wrote my first letter to the United States,\nwhen the mails started to function in \u201949 -- 1946, I wrote to Uncle Leo and Aunt Ilinor,\nmy life in the camp, and he used this during one of the meetings of some organization in\nthe Shandley Hotel at that time, I remember -- I was told later on, when I came here, of\nwhat was going on.",
        "Q: Did they encourage you to -- to talk?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think that they did have to, because I n -- I needed to. Today I don\u2019t. Today I --",
        "Q: That\u2019s interes -- Oh, sorry.",
        "A: Today I am not hundred percent, but I would say maybe 90 percent of what I used to\nbe, before all this happened.",
        "Q: It\u2019s interesting to hear you say that you had the need to talk immediately after, and not\nso much now, because I\u2019ve heard other people say, \u201cBack then I wasn\u2019t ready to talk\nabout it yet, and people didn\u2019t want to listen.\u201d",
        "A: Oh some of them didn\u2019t want to listen and some people told me I should already stop,\nyou know. They me -- They meant it well. Th-That was my imbalance. There was a\nmental imbalance, definitely. I said yesterday, I -- accidentally, to my sister-in-law, the\nwife of my wife\u2019s brother. My wife\u2019s brother was her husband, he passed away. I says,\n\u201cFlorence, you know, when I got into your family, I wasn\u2019t right.\u201d She says, \u201cI know that,\nKurt. We know -- We knew that.\u201d But they -- they accepted me too, and treated me just\nlike I would be theirs.",
        "Q: In what way -- when you say --",
        "A: In any way. Any way. | had to -- the same right and the same obligations, like\nanybody else.",
        "Q: But in what way, when you say I was not right, what do you mean?",
        "A: I -- I was not my old Kurt. I was very much influenced with my past.",
        "Q: You were thinking a lot about what had happened?",
        "A: Not that I was thinking, but I ch -- 1-1-it influenced my thinking. I was -- As I told you\nbefore, when I finally hit the SS man in the jaw, after that point, even in my\nunconscience, I was afraid.",
        "Q: Tell that story on tape, because I -- I think you didn\u2019t tell that on tape, about your --\nyour dream.",
        "A: No, that was when -- in -- in this country already, I was dreaming -- I had a nightmare,\nalways the same nightmare, that Sharfihrer Wagner is -- was chasing me, and I always\nescaped someplace in the straw. Jumped someplace and lie in the straw, and he couldn\u2019t\nfind me any more. Until one night, I\u2019m dreaming again the same thing. Suddenly I\nstopped running, and made a fist and hit him in his jaw. And from then on, I never had\nthe nightmare any more, and I improved definitely, in my mental attitude, toward the\npublic -- toward the non-Jewish public, because at the time when I came, I suspected in\nthe first place anybody again, who is non-Jewish, might be -- want to harm -- wanted to\nharm me, or whatever, you know. Thi-This is something, but it\u2019s not easy to understand,\nand it is not easy for me to explain.",
        "Q: How long did it take for you -- How long were you having those dreams before you\nturned around and socked him?",
        "A: That I -- That I don\u2019t remember, but it was quite awhile. It could have been a couple\nof years, I don\u2019t know. But I do not know, I really can\u2019t -- this is just a guess.",
        "Q: And then -- And then --",
        "A: As a-- As a matter of fact, I was so intimidated also, that I didn\u2019t talk English in the\npublic, when I was in a bus with somebody, I wouldn\u2019t open my mouth. It took me two\nyears, before I started to talk English in a bus, or in a restaurant, you know? I was --\nBecause I felt that I\u2019m foreigner, I have an accent -- today it doesn\u2019t bother me, I know I\nhave an accent, but I don\u2019t give a hoot.",
        "Q: What language did you speak with your family?",
        "A: We spoke English, only English. When I arrived, and we got to bed at night, and the\nnext morning, when I came into the kitchen, and my aunt was giving me breakfast and\nshe started to talk to me German. I said, \u201cAuntie, please, don\u2019t talk to me German, only\nEnglish, whether I understand or not. I don\u2019t want to talk German, I want to learn\nEnglish.\u201d And we never spoke German.",
        "Q: That\u2019s very impressive. What were your -- What were your ideas and expectations\nabout America? What was your idea of what America was?",
        "A: You know, the expectation of America were very much different what the reality was.\nI thought that everybody is rich, and that nobody works. And I found out that the majority\nof the people are not rich, the great majority, and even the rich one work. I also thought --\n[ -- I -- I was not aware of the fact of the national coherence of ethnic groups. I thought\nthat they are separated, but as far as the nation concerns, America, if he\u2019s Polish or\nItalian, you say something against the country, and I\u2019m sure that they would -- they\nwould not like it. Th-That was another very pleasant experience for me. And the equality,\nthat everybody is protected by the law, and has the same obligation, like anybody else.\nAnd the idea of a Lincoln, to build a nation by -- by mixing, by respect and cooperation\nand understanding for everybody, this all I didn\u2019t -- I have no -- I had no idea who\nLincoln was. It was en -- It was entirely -- I was tra -- a transplanted tree, from one\norchard, into another orchard, in another climate.",
        "Q: But then you started to study about American history.",
        "A: Yeah, I was interested, I want -- wanted to know what was going on and what --\nwhat\u2019s going on now, and so forth.",
        "Q: You mentioned that in -- in the early days you -- you felt suspicious, and -- and\ninsecure about non-Jews, and not -- not sure whether you were safe.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know -- I didn\u2019t know how to take it. I didn\u2019t know how to take it, because\nnobody made any remarks. As a matter of fact, I got -- I arrived here in 1948. When I got\nmarried in 1954, we took a honeymoon to Canada, and there, for the first time, I heard an\nanti-Jewish remark. In Canada, not here.",
        "Q: What was the remark?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know any more what it was. We were in a store and somebody made some\nnasty remark about Jews. In Canada. I don\u2019t know any more which city it was, but I re --\nthat I remember dis-distinctly.",
        "Q: And by then had your feelings changed, about --",
        "A: Oh yeah, no, I was -- I was already Americanized. I was already a American citizen.\nNo, I was not citizen yet. Yeah, I was citizen, yeah, because otherwise I couldn\u2019t have\ngone to -- to Canada.",
        "Q: Tell me about becoming a citizen, when did that happen?",
        "A: That happened, I believe, in 1953. The huge gathering by a judge, and a clerk of the\ncourt, in a big building in Pittsburgh, downtown. I don\u2019t know whether it was the\ncourthouse, or whatever. And there were for -- I was prepared, I was studying for it, and\nthen they gave us a few questions, and if you answered, you became a citizen, and if you\ndidn\u2019t answer, you get a citizen too.",
        "Q: Was it a very important occasion for you?",
        "A: Definitely, but I want to tell you, once I got into this country, I got a little green card,\nfor identification. Not once, until I became a citizen, was anybody ever asking me about\nmy identity. No policemen, nobody. It was just a entirely different life. In my old\ncountry, if you went to visit somebody for more than 48 hours, you had to report it to the\npolice. That\u2019s what they call a police state. When my late grandmother came to visit with\nus, she had to go to the police and tell them, \u201cI came from Warscarvas, Ill be staying\nwith my brother -- with my son-in-law and my daughter, Mr. and Mrs. Ticho,\u201d such an\naddress. And the day before she was leaving, she had to tell him she is leaving, where she\nis going again. And that was a democratic state at the time, already. All Czechoslovakia\nwas a democratic state. The only one in central Europe.",
        "Q: Did you have friends or acquaintances that you got to know who were non-Jewish at\nthe time, or were you mainly moving in -- in the circle of your family?",
        "A: Where, here?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I did not have any non-Jewish acquaintances, with the exception that when I traveled,\nI had to, of course, approach any buyer, whether he was Chinese or Protestant, or Jewish,\nwhatever. But these were nice business friendships. As a matter of fact, I am still in touch\nwith the former buyer of the May Company, Betty Flaherty, and one happened to be a\nJewish fellow, Buddy Fagersner, who was also in a Cleveland store. But I was very\nfriendly with -- with my buyers and they had great confidence in me. And when my wife\ndied, I remember one of the ladies made some preserve, then gave it to me, you know, I\nshouldn\u2019t -- I should have some home cooking, whatever.",
        "Q: How did you meet your wife?",
        "A: I was selling these dresses, trying to sell the dresses, when I came into the store called\nTaft\u2019s, in Columbus, Ohio. And she wasn\u2019t there at the time, her sister-in-law was there,\nand she asked me, \u201cHow does your wife like it when you are travel from col -- from\nPittsburgh to Ohio, and you are at home only over a weekend?\u201d I says, \u201cI\u2019m single.\u201d So\nthen they introduced me to the single girl in the family, and that\u2019s how it happened.",
        "Q: Was she Jewish?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Was that important to you, to -- to marry a Jewish woman? Was your Jewish identity\nvery important to you at that point?",
        "A: Oh, 1-1-it -- it was, yes. It -- It -- It -- It was, although it didn\u2019t matter to me whether\nshe was ir-irrelig-religious, or religious, but somehow there was a cultural background, a\ncultural need.",
        "Q: And you were living in --",
        "A: I don -- I -- I didn\u2019t know any Gentile women anyways. So, I mean, I don\u2019t know\nwhether -- if I would have | -- fell in love with a Gentile woman, maybe I would marry\nher too, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Did you talk to your wife about what had -- what your experiences had been during\nthe war, and what had become of your family?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, the whole family wanted to know, they were very interested in what --\nwhat\u2019s going on, and they were very -- they are very active in Jewish causes, you know?",
        "Q: Did you feel that they were capable of -- of really understanding what you had been\nthrough?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh definitely, definitely. For instance, my nephew -- my wife\u2019s nephew --\nformer wife\u2019s nephew, is today president of the Jewish congregation in Columbus. He\u2019s\nvery active in Jewish activities, and also a very ardent Republican, who is very friendly\nwith -- for instance, President Bush. And his mother 1s a outstanding -- absolutely\noutstanding -- I would call her a genius. Not only in Jewish causes, but sh-she\u2019s an\ninventor, and she very g -- very generous, help people. Not only Jews, non-Jews -- non-\nJewish organizations. I remember sh-she helped a woman to become an opera singer, for\nyears supporting her, a non-Jewish woman. And when she was finally an opera singer\nand gave a performance in Cincinnati, we went down there to see her.",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: I would have to ask Florence, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: You mentioned coming to the United States, and having some awareness of -- of some\nof the ideals of this country, and you came in the early 50\u2019s. It wasn\u2019t long after that, that\n-- that there were a lot of civil rights issues going on. Was that something you were\nparticularly aware of?",
        "A: I want to tell you, for instance, there was this Korean War. I didn\u2019t understand it too\nmuch. I was a cutter and I was tired, and I read the paper, but I didn\u2019t -- I was not in -- not\ninto the global politics yet at all. That came at -- That\u2019s why I say, I changed. I developed\nagain into what I used to be. It was a long process. On -- Only it -- it -- and only it came\nalong because of the environment in which I lived, and it was protect -- it was protective\nand understanding.",
        "Q: Do you feel like you\u2019re back to a hundred percent now?",
        "A: No. I would say it\u2019s about maybe 90.",
        "Q: You m -- also mentioned -- and this is something that I saw written down somewhere,\nbut you didn\u2019t tell the -- tell the story in your interview, something about your\ninvolvement with the trial of one of the SS members --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- in Sobibor, Frenzel.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Can you tell me about your involvement in that trial?",
        "A: I tell you how it happened originally. A fellow with who I worked in the camp,\ntogether in a little -- a little building, his name was Friedberg, Alfred Friedberg from\nFrankfurt, Germany. He was a -- His hobby was painting. And we worked together in this\nlittle place, on little items, sorting them out and deliver them to the Germans. And I found\n[indecipherable] money. And one day one of the Ukrainians, which have close by kept\nthe horses, came into our place, and picked up a fountain pen and a pencil, whatever, and\nI had the money there prepared, and he picked up the money too, German marks. And the\nnext day he came and brought us a liter of vodka and a kilo of Polish kielbasa. And that\nwent on all the time I -- we worked in this -- in this little place. Every second day we got\na kilo and a liter. The liter we gave away, we didn\u2019t drank it. Gave it to some other goy --\nboys. But the salami kept us alive, until that stopped, the job there stopped. There was no-\nnothing met to sort, and I went back into the sorting department and then I became sick.\nGot the flu or the typhoid fever, I don\u2019t know what it was. But that I mentioned in the --\nin my --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- memories there. And then I became the sanitator, the man who was taking care of\nthe sick people. And what did you ask me originally?",
        "Q: I was asking about your involvement with the trials, the post-war trials of Fre-Frenzel.",
        "A: Oh. Oh yes. This Friedberg got the job to make the labels for the SS when they were\ngoing back to Germany, the address labels on their lugga-luggage. And he had any name\nbut of the commander of the camp and of Sharfthrer fr -- Wagner. Wagner was too\nshrewd to give it to anybody. And at one time he told me, \u201cYou know, Frenzel lives in\nthe -- close to Berlin, and he gave me the n -- city\u2019s name, which contained the word\nlerver, lion in German, and I think berg or borg. I don\u2019t know how it happened, after the\nwar I wrote a letter to some German office, mentioning that we had Sharfthrer Frenzel,\nwho was very brutal, and he lived in this city, which has the word lerver and berg or\nborg. And I didn\u2019t pay any attention to the whole thing, I didn\u2019t hear anything. When I\nwas in Frankfurt, I believe, at the trial, 1t was the last trial, there was a public persa --\npersecutor, his name was Pfeiffer, very nice young man, and he called me aside and he\nsays to me, \u201cYou know, because of your tip, we went to -- we went, looked at the map,\nfound the town next to Berlin, found Mr. Frenzel working as a carpenter, which he was\noriginally, on a stage in a theater. And that\u2019s how we got him.\u201d And then I testified\nagainst him, I was called as a witness. The first time in 1966, and then later again, and\nthen he was sentenced to life and then he got out on some kind of a legal point, I don\u2019t\nknow what, and I had to go to testify again, and then he got again arrested, and ended in\njail. He 1s not alive any more, I don\u2019t think so. He was a year or two older than I.",

And so do you want\nto start by telling me -- you had a couple of things that you remembered, that you wanted\nto add. I'll hold --",
        "A: The first thing what I want to mention 1s that when I was translating the letter to the\ndirector of the museum in Boskovice, that the word which I was missing, which actually\nis the deed, when the church was selling what it\u2019s called indagencies, to those who\nsinned, and were buying off their -- their sinning. That\u2019s number one, number two, when\nI was translating that same letter, I omitted, I believe one sentence, which I definitely\nwant to repeat, namely, when I say that Christianity 1s a noble religion, which will be\nhere for eternity. And now, if you allow me, I would like to start to read two letters from\nTheodora Toidya Cobaletska, that\u2019s her -- that\u2019s her married name, the daughter of the\nfarmer, which she wrote me on my inquiries in the 90\u2019s, what happened during my stay\nthere, which I could not know, because I couldn\u2019t get out, and after I left. All right then.\nHere is the first letter from Toidya, dating into September 19, 1993. \u201cDear Kurt, in\nreference to your letters of March 15 and August third, 1993, I am conveying to you\ninformation regarding my parents and my family. My mother Anna Pocharlie, nee Lipa,\nwas born April 15, n -- 1890, in Wallagarja Nitzca, near Pableshk Piaski lubareska, while\nmy father, Stanislav Pocharlie, son of Michael and Maryanna, was born on April 21, n --\n1890, in Sialishky, near Piaski lubareska. Together they will work as farmers on their\nfarm in Sialishky. Through their own daily work, they managed to acquire a larger farm,\nand until Hitler\u2019s German invasion of Poland, in September 1900 and 39, they were\nleading farmers in the village. After that, my father worked simultaneously in the Casa\nShef-Shef-Shefsheek Savings Bank in Piaski. The invaders ran a wasteful, exploi-\nexploitative regime and the for -- the for -- their forced deliveries of goods ruined the\nPolish countryside. The invaders ran a wasteful and exploit-ploitative regime and the\nforced deli-deliveries of goods ruined the Polish countryside. Not fulfilling the quotas\nwas cruelly punished by the German administration, with arrests, and with sending\npeople to concentration camps. The period of the German occupation was a brutal time, a\ntime of violence and terror. There was a lack of food, and the basic food articles were\ndistributed by means of ration cards. I remember that Mama used to prepare a syrup from\nsugar beets, and we sweetened our black coffee with it. There were times when there\nwasn\u2019t even flour for bread, which Mama baked herself. Our basic diet was milk and\npotatoes. Thanks to the resourcefulness of my father, there was never any real hunger. I\nremember the day when you came to us at night. My father warned Mother not to give\nyou any food that was too fatty or excessively rich during the first few days of your stay\nwith us. After the camp food, it might have caused serious health consequences for your\nstomach and your whole digestive system. At that time it was not easy to get medicines\nand curing you would have been made significantly more difficult under the conditions of\nyour concealment. I want to mention that my parents were afraid f -- of the neighbors,\nwho were numerous around our farmyard. A woman by the name of Fran-Franechka,\nwho was very nosy, was specially dangerous. She loved to look after -- around\neverywhere, in the outbuildings, and tell the whole village what was going on around\nthere. For that reason also, we had to maintain the greatest possible vigilance of all costs.\nAfter that, there was a young girl in our house, by the make of Kriska, who was with us\nas a helper in the housekeeping. Her mother asked my father whether she could work for\nhim so that she could be registered in our community. Wer -- This registration saved her\nfrom being carried off to forced labor with the Germans. I remember also a conversation\nof my father with his brother, who likewise lived in Sialishky, who told father that a\nneighbor had told him that there was someone hiding in our outbuildings, because one\nnight you could hear coughing. This information from his brother made my father very\nuneasy and he told you about this occurrence, indicating that he would have to change\nyour place of hiding. Father,\u201d -- pardon me, he didn\u2019t tell me about that, but he said that I\nshould not cough, but he didn\u2019t tell me why. I -- I had no -- I had no idea about the\nreason. \u201cFather and Mother were considering how to do this in order to create safe\nconditions for your further stay in hiding. With that goal in mind, both of them went to\nMama\u2019s brother, who was living in the village of Wallagardianitska, about six kilometers\nfrom Sialishky, in order to discuss with him the matter of transporting you to that locality\nand of concealing you at his farm, but that event turned out differently. It happened that\nmy mother\u2019s brother was being sought by the Germans and had to hide himself as well.\nIn that situation, Dad and Mama decided that you would remain further at the place in\nSialishky, whatever the consequences. In regard to Kriska, you -- who had seen you in\nthe barn, Dad explained to her, if I remember correctly, that you were one of the\npartisans, who was hiding there. It goes without saying that it was impossible to let her\nknow who you were, and in the interest of the safety of all of us. Apparently, she must\nhave believed Dad\u2019s explanation, because, as it turned out, the matter never came to\npublic attention. Further -- Fortunately, as you know, we endured those hard times and\nlived to see the liberation. For us, the day of liberation, which came in our area in the\nsecond half of July, 1944,\u201d -- it was rather at the very end of July -- \u201cwas a special day. It\nwas possible for you to leave your hiding place, and you were able to return to a normal\nlife. We were overcome with great joy. That which had seemed an impossible thing, had\nbecome a reality. Our faith and confidence, in the help of God, and also our prayers had\nbeen answered. After your departure from Sialishky, at the end of July, 1944, we\ncontinued to be uneasy about whether you had made it in s -- in safe and sound to your\nhome in Czechoslovakia. Your letter, sent from the ship Queen Elizabeth,\u201d-- but it should\nbe Queen Mary -- \u201csaying that you were alive and on your way to United States was an\nenormous comfort to us, and finally permitted our hearts to be at ease. We were able to\nthink about you -- your new life, with a feeling of relief, and to wish that it would be a\nhappy one. Our country was free from under Hitler\u2019s occupation and we thought that the\npeaceful life would now en-ensue. In the meantime, from the very beginning, there were\nstarting to be arrests, death sentences and deportations to prison camps deep in the Soviet\nUnion, from which many Poles never again returned to their country. They a -- They\narrested members of the National Army, and those who did not accept the new political\norder. A difficult period for the Polish society had begun. Many innocent people died\nduring the consolidation of the people\u2019s government. The truth about these times of\nviolence and repression has just recently begun to come to light, little by little. In\nSeptember \u00b044, my father was arrested on the charge of possession of weapons and of\nconcealing partisans. In our home, a rigorous inspection was carried out by functionaries\nof the Bureau of Security. Mama and I were terrified and beside ourselves at the thought\nof what would become to us in the future. At a certain time, Mama and I left our home\nand possessions. Our neighbors took care of the entire farm during our absence. Such a\nsituation could not continue, however, and our return to Sialishky was necessary, without\nregard to the consequences. That was a very difficult time for us. The Bureau of Security,\nafter many interrogations, was not able to prove the charges they had brought against my\nfather, that his possessions of arm, and concerning partisans. Father did not return home\nuntil December fi -- \u00b044. However, there was not any further peace. Difficult times began\nto wealthy farmers, so-called kulaks, by the people\u2019s government. My father was likewise\naccounted as one of these kulaks. Extremely high tax charges and mandatory deliveries of\nagricultural produ-produce, and livestock, were imposed by the office of the community,\naimed at liquidating the so-called kulak farms. If the farmers did not comply with the\ncommunity prohibitions, they were e -- threatened with serious penal consequences. With\nhard labor, my parents endured even this hostile rate of taxation, of the people\u2019s\ngovernment, or wealthy farmers. They worked on their farm until advanced old age. My\nparents did not want to leave Sialishky, here they had their family, neighbors, their home\nand their free life. On the other hand, being with us in Lublin, they were condemned, as it\nwere, to idleness, to a lack of -- to a lack of neighbors with whom they had lived together,\nor a -- great part of their lives, and to lack of all of that which surrounded them in the\nvillage. Simply put, they never 1m-imagined a life in town for themselves, and I am not\nsurprised, because the link with their environment, which accompanied them almost\nthroughout their lives, was so strong that it could not be broken. My father, right after\nMom\u2019s death, when we wanted to bring them to Lublin, put off his arrival for month, two\nmonths, and not until December, did he decide to come to our home in Lublin. While he\nwas with us, he was extremely homesick for Sialishky, and it might be that the\nhomesickness and idleness hastened his death. Mom died June 28\", \u201971, in Sialishky, and\nFather on April 1972, in Lublin. They are both buried in the cemetery in Piaski. I want to\nmention that I have been married since December 31, 1945, and from the start, I lived in\nPiaski, and worked there initially, in the cooperative agricultural market, afterwards in\nthe cooperative savings bank, and later, after bringing up the children, in the post office.\nThere was always frequent contact with my parents, especially during the times of\nintensified field labor. All my family [indecipherable] these jobs. Our children spent July\nand August vacations in Sialishky, and to the extent they could, helped their grandparents\nwith the harvest. Myself and my husband, who likewise are work in Piaski, took a leave\nof absence at the time, and spent it working on my parents farm. In 1966, we obtained an\napartment in Lublin, in Kalanovsheesna Street, and a new phase of our life began for us.\nMy son Andre finished at that time, the [indecipherable] technical school. My daughter\nAlsberta finished liberal arts gymnas-gymnasium, college preparatory high school, and\nthe younger daughter, Eva, went into the second class of basic school. I, after coming to\nLublin, have been working continuously at the post office in Piaski, which allowed me to\nbe continuous -- in continuous contact with my parents, to whose house I used to ride\nafter work on my bicycle, about three to six kilometers from Piaski to Sialishky. At that\ntime, my parents were already over 76 years old, and had less and less edj -- energy to\nwork. They sold part of their land because they were no longer in any condition to\nmanage it, and earlier -- and -- and earlier, a part of the land had been sold to pay taxes\nimposed yearly by the people\u2019s government of the community. They were on what\nremained of their farm right up to Mom\u2019s death. My father, after the final liquidation on\nthe farm, came to our house in Lublin in December \u201971. All my family hold them in fond\nmemory. They were people of high moral le-level, upon whom it was all -- always\npossible to depend. Their most particular character trait was kindness and fondness for\nthe family, and that was felt in every step in their contact with us. For that reason also,\nour children were always very eager to be with them, and received each announcement of\na trip to Sialishky with joy. For us and our children, my parents home was always an\noasis of peace and joy, where everyone always felt happy and secure. That resulted in\ntheir positive influence on our hearts and minds, and arose from their deep faith in the\nvalues of the Christian teaching, on which they were followers. Kindness, tolerance, and\nmutual respect. My parents and all of us were eager to see you after years, once again in\nSialishky, but that has turned out to be impossible. I think that this will come true to a\ncertain degree with your meeting with your son -- with our son Andre and his family al-\nalthough in America, where they have been living permanently since September 1988.\nMay he represent those who have already departed from this world, my dear parents and\nus all, living in this country. We have the hope that this meeting will take place. Lublin,\nDecember 19, 1993, Theadora Kobaleska.\u201d And now she\u2019s got a beautiful letter --",

        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: -- read those yet. Let me ask you something about that. Did you -- Did you -- Did you\never go back and visit?",
        "A: No, no, I never went back. I was afraid of the Polish Communist government, I -- I\nnever went back. But we are continuously corresponding and I am helping them out.",
        "Q: Did you know Toidya while you were there?",
        "A: Yes, I s-saw Toidya a few times. She was a girl about 18 years old that time, and I\ndon\u2019t know whether I mentioned it in my story, at Easter, 1943, she came out of the\nhouse while I was watching the yard, with a little basket on her arm, and with her came a\nyoung man. He stood in front of the house, on the side in front of the house and she went\ntoward my hiding place. And when she got in, she reached me the little basket. And there\nwere Easter cookies, and colored vodka to drink. There -- There -- They regarded me as a\nmember of their family. It was really a beautiful relationship, and I told him he raised\nhimself a son, and I am treating her like a sister.",
        "Q: What -- How did you start to correspond with her? Was that something that you had\nbeen doing over the years?",
        "A: Well, originally I wrote to her parents, but then when they passed away, and we\ncontinued some corresponding in Czech and Polish on either side, her husband Yanoush,\nstarted to study English, and from then on we started to correspond English on both ends,\nand you could have seen the improvement in his English as time went on.

And then he told me\nthey don\u2019t want any help, they want to do it on their own, and a very, very proud, fine,\nnoble people.",
        "Q: This is the second letter that -- will you say something --",
        "A: Lam now continuing with the follow up letter after receiving the first one, I wrote her\nand this is the answer, dated Lublin, December the 17, 1993. \u201cDear Kurt. In reference to\nyour letter of November seventh and to the information which I sent you in a letter on\nSeptember 19, I would like to finish describing those events that I still remember from\nthat letter. I began working at S-Spudsyairna rawneecho handlovay in Piaski in\nSeptember, \u201941, and my work there prevented me from being taken to a forced labor\ncamp in Germany. In the fall, and especially during the winter, I frequently spent the\nnights in Piaski, and during the spring and summer, I often came home to -- by bike. I\nwas in Piaski the day you arrived at my parent\u2019s home, on October 18, 1943. The next\nday my mother came to me and told me about your arrival and that same day I came to\nSialishky and we were tell -- talking. I believe roo -- you remember that moment.\u201d I don\u2019t\nremember that she was talking to me, that Toidya was ta-talking to me. \u201cI stopped\nworking at the Sporgiana and came home to live with my parents with my father -- when\nmy father took me from Piaski. This happened when the Germans and Soviet armies were\napproaching our village. During this time, attacks from wa-war planes, were intensifying,\nwhich were bombing German regiments and fleeing Germans and has set Piaski aflame.\nAt that time, retreating German er -- regiments and civilians, referred as to the\nVolksdeutsch, had penetrated into the village, took horses and anything else they could,\nand fled west. I and several other people from the village, took our horses from the\nstables and we ran off in the meadows to prevent the Germans army from requisi --\nrequisitioning our horses. We spent the night in the fields, in the bushes, where we safely\nwaited until the morning. The German army horse corp, and along with them civilians,\narrived in our yard that same night. Many farmers ran off into their meadows, whereas\nmy parents and our neighbor, Adam Smoleara remained in the building. In the morning\nmy mother came and told us not to return home yet. We returned to the village only in the\nafternoon, once the Germans left. As we later discovered, rebels from the Polish\nunderground army ambushed them outside of Piaski. Most likely they were Germans and\nUkrainians. A portion of them who survived, returned to Sialishky and ordered us to\nleave our buildings because the Soviet army was going to occupy them. My parents\nquickly loaded the wagon with foods and clothes, and at that time, informed the military\npersonnel that the messengers from the village went to the commander in Piaski to verify\nwhether this order was reliable. They were surprised by this information and shortly\nafterwards, left the village. Our village is located between two main roads, which when\nleaving Piaski, one leads to Holm and the other one to Zamosc. The Polish and Soviet\narmies were advancing on the road to Holm from Piaski, where the German\u2019s army was\nretreating likewise it on the road from Piaski to Zamosc toward Lublin. Both sides were\nexchanging machine gun fire from both Jal and the highest point -- from both Jal and the\nhighest point in Sialishky. The villages, Drizishky, Drazitchae, Jelltov and Piaski, and the\nsurrounding area were aflame, but our village was preserved. During this shoot out, we\nwere sitting in a man -- manhole across from our residence, that was dug up by my father\nand our neighbor Alexander Pasternak. In your hi -- In our hiding pl -- In your hiding\nplace, there was another exit through the attic into Pasternak\u2019s shed, that led to the\nmeadow. My father explained to me that in case of any danger, you could have run away\nby opening the door of -- to the unlocked shed. After the German army retreated beyond\nLublin, I decided to turn to work in Piaski. That was at the end of July 44. The day you\nleft our house, I was at work. In my father\u2019s opinion, the main roads [indecipherable]\nPiaski Lublin was the safest and directed toward the road, because that was where the\nPolish and Soviet regiments were located. On the side road, Sialishky Pershki, there were\nmany deserters dressed as civilians, of whom my father was suspicious, so he decided to\nlead you to the road beyond the yard, that led to the main road.\u201d That is not so in my\nmemory, but it doesn\u2019t really matter. \u201cYou asked in your letter 1f anyone heard you\ncoughing. That was our neighbor, Adam Smalleara, who walked by your hiding place to\nhis farm buildings every day. He told his neighbor Constanti Pocharlie about the\ncoughing in your -- in our buildings. He was my father\u2019s brother and frequently came to\nour home. The next thing you asked is where my mother and I were when we left our\nhome in Sialishky after my father was arrested, and who took care of our farm. My father\nstayed with the si -- her sister, who lived in Volla Garjanitska village, and I stayed with\nmy cousin in Lublin. In our absence, my father\u2019s brother, Constanti Pocharlie and his\nwife Elixa, who resided in Sialishky, and lived near us, took care of our farm. They\ninformed us through acquaintances that it was possible to return to Sialishky. Was Kriska\nin Sialishky? She did not live there. She was from Walla Posi -- Biasetska village, a\nmunicipality of Piaski. Some information about my family. My husband Yanoush worked\nin Piaski, where [indecipherable] during the German occupation and several years after\nthe liberation in -- until 1949, and subsequently in Lublin, December 31\u201c, 1981. From\nJanuary first, \u00b082, after 40 years of working, the -- h-h-he retired. Our son Andre was\nborn January 10, \u201947 in Piaski and graduated from a technical school in Lub-Lublin, and\nas you know, lives in the United States. He has two daughters, Monica is 17 and Biara 1s\n16. Our daughter\u2019s Edjberta, her married surname being Warchieska, was born January\nfirst, \u00b048, in Piaski and received a degree in Lublin, and subsequently in Warsaw. She\nwas 21 all -- She has a 20 year old daughter, who il -- Ivana and lives in Warsha --\nWarsaw. Our daughter Eva have -- her married surname being Remish, was born\nDecember second, \u201958, in Piaski, and received her degree in Lublin and has a 12 year old\nson, Pavel and lives in Lublin. We move fi -- from Piaski to Lublin, with our entire\nfamily in \u201966, where we are still living today. If you would like any more information,\nplease write, and I will gladly send it.\u201d That\u2019s the end of the second letter.",
        "Q: It must have been interesting to learn about what was going on from their perspective\nduring that time that you were there.",
        "A: I -- [remember when I got married, in \u201954, I think not too long later, I got a request\nfrom them, the only time they asked for anything. They told me that the oldest son,\nAndre, who now lives in San Diego and the second born daughter, will have\nConfirmations. And they need for the girl, a little white dress. So my wife Tina had made\nup a dress with the -- with the repair seamstress in the store, and we send it to them. It\nhad a stiff crinoline, and they thought that the crinoline is being worn outside instead of\nsupporting the dress, and I got the picture, the confirmation picture with that crinoline on\nthe outside. I never told Toidya about this mistake, but it was really funny, and a\nbeautiful picture. I have the photograph someplace.",
        "Q: What --",
        "A: I have also the photograph of Stanislav Pocharlie and his wife Anna, in the suit which\nI sold him, f -- and which he mentioned to me that I owe him -- that he owes me some\nmoney for it. I have that picture, too, and the suit is as crinkled as it was when I s -- when\nI smuggled it out of the ghetto into the village to him. But these were beautiful people,\nand they were so kind to each other. A beautiful married life and a beautiful family life,\nthe daughter, she was -- she was a queen, yet she was a wonderful daughter, you know,\nToidya. I have -- I have very warm memories, full of gratefulness.",
        "Q: What was it like for you to learn about some of the trials of the Poles in the area, and\njust to think of it from their perspective?",
        "A: That\u2019s what I just wanted to let those know who will study the situation, that the\nPolish people, who were anti-Semitic, unfortunately, but that was again the fault of the\nchurch, later on suffered so much by their own Communist system, undeservedly. In\nother words, they were always between two big millstones. On the west was Germany,\nand on the east was Russia. And Poland was actually divided, I believe three times during\nthe history. The last time it was unified in 1918, when the southern and -- and western\npart belonged to Austria-Hungary. The northern part belonged to the Germans and the\neastern part was Russian. They -- They had very -- a li -- very few periods of their own\nnationhood, I think under the yagalons, which was a -- which was a -- they are kings, the\nyagalons, they were very, very well known, historically. But the Polish nation as such, I -\n- I can see a very smart people, lacking some education and also infrastructure.\nCommunications, roads, electricity, that was missing. But the people itself, are just as\ngood as any of the civilized nations, or more civilized nations. I w -- I wouldn\u2019t -- I\nwouldn\u2019t say that they are not civilized, but less me -- technically mes -- less developed.",
        "Q: Do you want to say anything else about them before we move onto a different subject?\n[indecipherable] question --",
        "A: No, I really -- I -- I -- about the Russians?",
        "Q: No, about -- about the -- your -- the family?",
        "A: About the -- no, no, I -- I -- I think I said everything I felt and feel about them, bef -- if\nI should remember later, I might be sorry, but right now I do not know what to say.",
        "Q: When we stopped yesterday, we were talking about your experience with going to the\npost-war trials.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And that you had testified a few times against Frenzel.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And you said something about how he had -- he had -- about what his sentence was. I\nwanted to get more of a sense of your experience with going to those trials, and what did\nyou testify, and meeting other people who had survived Sobibor while you were there,\nand wh -- and what that was like.",
        "A: The trial, generally speaking, were organized in such a way, that one witness per\nweek. I did not see a witness who was before me, or the one who came after me, because\nthe court worked only on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, I believe, and Thursday the\n-- the court wa --\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",

Anyhow, at one time, he denied that I am the person who was\nin the camp, and the presiding judge, I believe his name was Schneider, stood up angrily\nand he says, \u201cMr. Thomas, how did they call you in camp?\u201d And I says, \u201cKurt.\u201d And then\nhe said to Frenzel, \u201cNow, don\u2019t you remember a Kurt in the camp?\u201d He says, \u201cYes, I\nremember a Kurt, but this 1s not the Kurt which was there.\u201d He deny -- He was lying\nthrough as much as he could, but ultimately he was sentenced to life, because there was\nno death penalty in Germany, which he later on, for some legal reason, renewed the -- the\ntrial, after being jailed for quite a few years, and the last trial confirmed again his guilt.",
        "Q: What -- What did you testify, and what was it like to te -- to be faced with this person\nand to testify against him?",
        "A: Well, I felt a certain satisfaction, that he could see that some of us survived and that he\ncouldn\u2019t get away with what he -- what he actually was doing. He was really exploiting\nus very badly.

One always was resting, while the other\ntwo were active, and in my case, it was another judge, who was very kind to me, with\nwho I correspond once in awhile, and then there was the wife of the principal of a high\nschool, their name was Wagner. Very, very kind, nice people, who tried to make us feel a\nlittle bit at home while we -- while we during the trials in Germany.",
        "Q: What year were those trials taking place?",
        "A: The first one was 1n 1966, and then I couldn\u2019t tell which following years when it was.\nBut the last one, I was a re -- I was real surprised, because it was quite a few years when\nthey started a retrial, after he claimed that he was sentenced innocently. And that was\nquite a few years later, it must have been in the 70\u2019s, already. And also Germany looked\nentirely different at that time, than during the first time of the trial. Even the hotels were\nso much better, and -- and the food and the -- it was an -- it was already a Germany\nrestored, almost completely, economically.",
        "Q: What was it like for you to be in Germany, and how did you find the Germans?",
        "A: Those Germans which I encountered, were very, very nice, very kind, decent people.\nAnd I believe that the German people are a -- are very -- very, ve-very good nation, like\nanybody else, but they were misled by a -- by a government, by getting promises, and\nalso because they suffered of the -- of the defeat during the first World War, which was\ninterpreted to them as a -- as a reason to avenge it. But nobody wa -- was telling them that\nthey actually started the war themselves, I mean it -- the war started in -- in -- after\nFerdinand Testi was killed in -- in Bosnia by Gavria Princip, a Bosnian nationalist, who\nkilled the successor to the throne of the Hapsburgs.

        "Q: Did you feel any anger at all towards the Germans when you were ther -- there?",
        "A: When I was in Germany? No, not personal. It was rather a historical feeling, but I had\nnothing against the German population any more. They -- They were defeated, they\nchanged their political system, and -- and they were admitting their guilt, and paid\nrestitutions, so what else can you -- can you ask? I think they were, in -- in the aftermath,\nthey were the most decent ones of all -- of all the nations who were involved in the war\nand took advantage of the superiority of the German army, o-of the -- of the -- the\nGerman government.",
        "Q: Did you ever feel angry at anyone?",
        "A: No, I was -- certainly had no friendly feelings toward Frenzel. As a matter of fact, I\njust remembered, I was waiting one morning on a stone bench in the courthouse. I came\nearlier than necessary. And next to me sat another German citizen, he was -- at that time,\nat least, I would say 20 years older than I. And I told him -- he asked me what I am doing\nthere, and I told him that I am there, being summoned as a witness, and mentioned\nFrenzel, and then I mentioned another -- another SS man, whose name was Gomersky.\nAnd he told me that he knew the Gomersky\u2019s boys, pre-war, that they were very, very\npoor people, they had nothing, they didn\u2019t have even a bicycle. And when Hitler came\ninto power, or rather, before he came into power, the n -- the National Socialist Party\nsupported the family, for the promise that they will be voting National Socialist. That\u2019s\nwhat he told me. And Gomersky, I have seen, he was already sentenced, I think. He died\nin prison.",
        "Q: You mentioned earlier that right after the war, you\u2019d sent some information to the\nWest German government about Frenzel, and about his hometown, and where it was --",
        "A: Yeah, 1-1t wasn\u2019t the government, it was some kind of a court.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But it was a -- it was a government institution, but not directly the government, and I -\n- | mentioned that Frenzel came from a city, as I said this before, which consists of two\nnouns, lerver, lion, and borg or berg.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah, you mentioned that and what I was wondering is whether -- did you feel -\n- did you trust the German government to actually persecute it\u2019s criminals at that point?",
        "A: Well, I-I really -- I knew that the Germans are persecuting those Nazis. It never came\ninto my mind that they will not pick up the information which I gave them or -- or -- or\nsimply pigeonhole it someplace. But it never came into mind either, that they will take a\nmap and find the city and -- and -- and find then Frenzel in this theater, working as a\ncarpenter. It was just a lucky coincidence that Friedma -- Friedland -- no, Friedberg, told\nme where he -- where his hometown was. If I would have asked Friedberg at the time,\n\u201cGive me all the names and addresses of all the people,\u201d he would have given it to me,\nbut who thought of that we will come out one day and be able to use it?",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you about the -- So, during that time, you didn\u2019t actually meet with\nany of the other Sobibor survivors? The time that you were testifying?",
        "A: No. I didn\u2019t see any of the survivors, although I think that at one time, I was going\nback to the United States with Samuel Lehrer and his wife, Gail. No, no, no, they were\nstill there, and they asked me because I will be home in [indecipherable] sooner than I, to\ncall their children that they are alright. I think we -- we -- we saw each other there for --\nfor a short while, in Germany.",
        "Q: Have you had any other kinds of -- of gatherings, of that -- that group, or any\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: Yeah, we had some gatherings. One time we were together in New York, when the\nmovie about the uprising of Sobibor was premiered, and we, the survivors, saw it first. At\nthat time, the United States witnesses came to see the movie, and even one fellow who\nwas in South America, Shlomish Misener, he -- he too came. The movie was financed --\nThe making of the movie was financed by the Chrysler corporation, and it is often shown\non PBS, the uprising in Sobibor.",
        "Q: That\u2019s the one called, \u201cEscape from Sobibor?\u201d",
        "A: Yeah, \u201cEscape from Sobibor.\u201d",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: At that time I had a dispute. I, on one side, against all the other former internees,\nbecause I didn\u2019t like what Hollywood made out of the story, by adding things which\nnever happened, and not telling about those things which were just as important, and\ndidn\u2019t show them in the movie. And they were angry with me that I was mentioning that.\nAnd I said that history -- as these documents should be a historical document, should\nreally tell the truth, and not be biased by some filmmaker, who made up a story.",
        "Q: Have you had a -- There\u2019s been so much material on the Holocaust coming out ho -- in\nHollywood and popular culture --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- lately. Have you had a problem with that?",
        "A: Well, some of the literature, I will have to mention my former colleague Blatt. He\nissued a little booklet, and it is in such a low standard, and so uninformative, actually,\nthat it\u2019s ridiculous that somebody even printed it. There is another book which I read, by\nJules Scurvis. He\u2019s a -- a Holland citizen, from -- from Holland. And he spend one hour\nin Sobibor. When his transport arrived, they pulled out from the transport, 80\ntypographers, and he was one of them too, but he was not -- he was not taken. So he\nasked an SS man whether he could join them, and the SS man kicked him in his butt into\nthe group. Now there were 81. They were used during the war for typographical -- for --\nwhat do you call it, when you print books? Printing purposes, and also, I understand, for\nfalsifying British currency, counterfeit. It\u2019s interesting that of the 81, he was only one\nwho survived, and then wrote a book about Sobibor, and it was interesting. He put into it\n-- | have it here, all the names of the some 34,000 Dutch people who came from\nWesterbork to Sobibor by transport, by date, and alphabetically. And that book was\nreprinted many times, because people were interested, not only about knowing about\nSobibor, but about those who perished there. That book is there, I can see it from here.\nIt\u2019s in -- It\u2019s in -- in Dutch, in Hollandish, and I got later on a translation in German. It\nwas translated into German.",
        "Q: Did you say something in your first interview that Jules Scurvis had told you\nsomething about the fate of your family, or am I misunderstanding?",
        "A: No, Jules Scurvis could not tell me, I told Scurvis about the fate of my family, and he\nput it in the book.",
        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "A: There is also my -- a picture of mine in that book.",
        "Q: What about other times that you\u2019ve gotten together with survivors from Sobibor, has\nthat happened? Have you maintained contact?",
        "A: Yeah, it happened, because I used to go once in awhile when I was in New York, on\nbusiness, I used to go to wine land, where quite a few of the former survivors of Sobibor\nwere in the chicken business, and egg business, you know? So I met with them there.",
        "Q: What was that like?",
        "A: It was a friendly get together, you know. We -- We were happy that we are around and\nthat we outsmarted the Germans. I also forgot to say yesterday, after the war, when I\ncame to the United States and I married my wife, I worked for awhile in their store. Her\nbrother and his wife were together with a partner in a business where they manufactured\nslippers. Originally -- The original trade name was Angel Treads. And then they came out\nwith another line called Deerfoams. And when the -- Prior to that yet, I was working in\nanother branch of their business, called House of Foam, which was selling foam rubber.\nWe represented Firestone in Akron, and I was active there, traveling a little bit, and\nselling the stuff wherever I could. And we made pillows. And then when they came out\nwith the line of Deerfoams, the company\u2019s name is R.G. Barry Corporation, with\nheadquarters here in Columbus. I got a line of these Deerfoams and started to travel, to\nintroduce that line of slippers, washable slippers in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan,\nIndiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, I forgot now where else. Min-Minnesota, and\nintroduced these slippers and got them into big stores, and as the distribution rose, and I\ncould not handle that many states any more, I was giving up territory, and ultimately, I\nlanded with four or five cities in Ohio, like Columbus, Cleveland, Dayton, Youngstown.\nThat\u2019s about it. And then I retired in -- and that\u2019s how I make an -- a living, and a nice\nliving.",
        "Q: Di -- Was your work an important part of your life, was it particularly --",
        "A: Well, I devoted all my energies to my work, and -- and to my wife. These were the\ntwo main objectives, and I was successful building up this business, and the company\nwas very nice to me, too.",
        "Q: Did you have any children?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t have any children from my -- with my first wife, neither -- nor no-none\nwith my second wife, of course, we were too old already.",
        "Q: And you mentioned that your first wife passed away?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: When was that and -- and how did that happen?",
        "A: She had circulatory problems and later on also developed Alzheimer\u2019s, and he passed\n-- she passed away in \u00b082.",
        "Q: And -- And your -- you remarried when?",
        "A: \u00b084.",
        "Q: In \u00b084?",
        "A: In \u201984, yes.",
        "Q: Will you state your wife\u2019s name?",
        "A: Gloria, Gloria. She\u2019s American born also, just like my first wife was.",
        "Q: We pause for a second. It\u2019s -- Well, it\u2019s interesting that you -- that you pulled out the -\n- the book that Thomas Blatt wrote --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- because I had a quote from the interview that we did with him.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And -- And I wondered what your response would be to this. And he says, \u201cThe fact 1s\nthat the survivors from the death camps act completely differently than survivors from\nconcentration camps. Concentration camp survivors have societies -- have societies.\nMau-Mauthausen prisoners, Auschwitz organizations, and Buchenwald. You never hear\nof S-Sobibor or Treblinka organizations, or Helmno. First of all, that\u2019s you on the left,\nbut people ask me, do you get together? No, we don\u2019t get together, we don\u2019t get together\nbecause our memories are too terrible, really, to talk about, so we don\u2019t have contact with\neach other.\u201d It sounds like what you\u2019re saying is different.",
        "A: It is not only different, this is -- he personally, had with him -- Shlomish Misener,\nstaying for six weeks, when they were trying to put together a book. So, th-that is already\nin contradiction that we ne -- didn\u2019t get together, we did get together. I was together this\nlast winter with Esther Robb and her husband, which was not in the camp, and with\nSamuel Lehrer and his wife in Florida, and it was I who initiated that meeting. And we\nalready set for next year, that we will make it so that we could be longer together than a\nfew hours.",
        "Q: And -- And he emphasized --",
        "A: I went, for instance, to Chaim Engel\u2019s son\u2019s Bar Mitzvah in Connecticut. And I try to\nbe in touch. But then, when I had that controversy, that dispute about the movie, with\nwhich I cannot come out publicly, because I didn\u2019t want to put wind into the sails of\nthose who denied the Holocaust. I felt originally, and I -- now I -- it watered down,\ndefinitely, that me -- that feeling, that the only thing I have in common with them 1s, the\nphysical living together in the camp, but that intellectually, we are far apart. That was my\nfeeling at the time, and I was very angry and frustrated, because they were at me like I\nwould been a traitor, when I mentioned that the movie is not really a hundred percent\ncorrect. In -- In the basis, 1t was correct that there was a camp and there was killing going\non, murdering, and that we s -- that we had organized an uprising and some of us\nsurvived. That is true, but certain details were not -- were not true.",
        "Q: Did they not agree with you that certain details --",
        "A: That\u2019s exactly, they disagreed with me, because he didn\u2019t want -- they didn\u2019t want me\nto even mention that there\u2019s anything wrong, which shouldn\u2019t have been there in the first\nplace, and that they omitted other things which they should have put in. And I think the --\nthe -- that -- that 1s my -- my -- that I put one and one together. The main reason why this\nhappened to us, Esther Robb went to Yugoslavia twice when the movie was made, as a\nconsultant. First she went as a -- as a volunteer, and then when they saw that she could\ngive some information, they made her a consultant. And she had in her power to do it\nright, because she has a good memory, she\u2019s a smart girl. And -- But she let them do\nwhatever they wanted to do, and -- and on that she -- in that sense, she 1s guilty in my\nown mind. But I forgave her already, because it doesn\u2019t make any difference.",
        "Q: Okay, there was some -- something else -- on the -- the whole idea that survivors of\nextermination camps, as opposed to concentration camps, have a very different kind of\nexperience, do you think there\u2019s anything to that?",
        "A: I don\u2019t believe that, what he said, because it was the trauma of the beatings, of the\nservitude which we have to manifest and -- and the horrible conditions, and to know that\nmany people got killed. What is the difference? I -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t believe that I\nsuffered more than somebody who survived Mauthausen and Dachau. I personally don\u2019t\nagree with that, and I don\u2019t know how he came to that conclusion, as if he would be a\nbetter, more elite caste of the survivors.",
        "Q: You mentioned something yesterday about how, immediately following the war, you\nhad more of a need to speak about it than you do now.",
        "A: Yeah, yes. I don\u2019t have any need now at all. But at that time, it -- I think that there was\n-- there was something mentally, because wherever I had an opportunity, I started to rattle\ndown my experiences.",
        "Q: Did you ever meet -- Did you ever do any public speaking?",
        "A: No. [had one little speech at the university here, and it was a fiasco, because first of\nall, there were only very few listeners. More than half of the listeners were friends of\nmine, instead of students from the university.",
        "Q: When was that?",
        "A: Oh, maybe four or five years ago.",
        "Q: Hold on. Did you say that you had gone to visit in -- in Boskovice, one time, after\ncoming --",
        "A: Yeah, it was a --",
        "Q: When was that?",
        "A: That was, I -- in the 90\u2019s, in the early 90\u2019s, after the Communist system s-stopped to\nexist. Later, a year later, I think, I went to Czechoslovakia and was in bo -- was in\nBoskovice for about three days, but I stayed in the hotel in Bernau, and we commuted by\ntaxi, because the -- the accommodations in Bernau were -- were easy and also I had\nfriends in Bernau, survivors.",
        "Q: Will you tell me something about that trip, and what it was like for you to visit again?",
        "A: Really, it was nothing dramatic. The most dramatic thing was when I wanted to visit\nthe graves of my late grandparents, my father\u2019s mother and father, Josef and Rosaria\nTicho. They had two very nice tombstones, and before I went to America, I erected a\nplate -- a marble plate, which was affixed on the two tombstones, in which I remembered\nmy parents and my sister, that they perished on June the 234, 1942, in Sobibor. The\nstones were -- were -- f-f-fell down and -- no, at that time they were still there. No, at that\ntime they were already gone. It was -- The stones were f -- laying flat on the ground and\nthe tablet was torn off, and I could not -- I did not know that I need a key to get into the\ncemetery and I didn\u2019t even know wh-who the key -- who the -- would have the key. I\ncrawled over the fence, into the cemetery, and that was the most dramatic thing on -- on\nthe whole trip. As a matter of fact, we went first to -- where did we go first? First to\nHungary, and stayed in Budapest, and my friend Rudolf Hurlinger, with his wife Inga,\nwho live in California -- she unfortunately died a few months ago -- went on a trip with a\ngroup. And as it happened, they also went to Hungary, to Budapest, and also to Vienna,\nand also to Czechoslovakia. And we, my wife and myself, we were on our own. So we\nhappened to meet in Budapest, in the hotel, and when I was leaving with Gloria, the --\ntheir room, I took the elevator, and in the elevator I see a man, and I look at him, and I\nsays, \u201cSir, aren\u2019t you a senator of the United States?\u201d And he shook my hand, and he\nsays, \u201cI am Sam Nunn, and this is my son.\u201d He introduced me in the elevator, and that\nwas the day when Yeltsin stopped that tank in Moscow, during the revolution there. And\nI says to him, \u201cYou know, Senator, we were lucky in -- in Russia.\u201d He says, \u201cI just came\nfrom there, and we were really lucky.\u201d And in the meantime the elevator stopped on the\nfirst floor, and there were people waiting for him already, downstairs. That was in\nBudapest, and then we met again in -- in Vienna, and then we met again in Bernau.",
        "Q: With Senator Nunn?",
        "A: No, w-we --",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: -- my friend, Rudy and Inga. And we wanted to go to -- to see the Spielberg, which is\nthe same name as the producer of the movies, Spielberg, the same spelling, which was\noriginally a torture camma built in the mid ages. And they tortured their people for\nreligious and political reasons, but it wasn\u2019t accessible, so we decided instead, and took a\ncab and went to the Matzocra, which are limestone caverns, built by -- partly by the water\nseeping through from the outside, and there\u2019s also a river on which you go on the little\nboat called Punqua, which was very interesting, that we spent together there with Rudy\nand Inga. Where else did we -- Oh, yeah, then in Vienna, I knew my best friend\u2019s brother",
        "Q: We s -- sorry, why don\u2019t we switch the tape now, it\u2019s about --\nEnd of Tape Four, Side B\nBeginning Tape Five, Side A",
        "A: -- which was a younger brother of my -- of his brother, who was a very close friend of\nmine, and we arranged a meeting and we met at the opera house. Inga, Rudy, myself,\nGloria and Emmanuel Ohare came too, and we had dinner together and -- and then we\nwent to see the opera. I forgot now what we saw. And then in Prague, we met again with\nRudy and Inga. And we stayed downtown in a hotel, and they stayed on the outskirts in a\nhotel, with -- with was originally built during the Communist system for Communist\u2019s\nfunctionaries only. It was a luxurious place, I went there, with every amenity you can\nimagine, with terraces in front of the rooms. And they stayed there for two or three nights\nand we stayed, as I said in the -- in downtown. And there I met one of my school chums,\nfrom high school, Rudolf Bubla, who helped us in Prague. He was a very nice fellow,\nwho became a professional officer of the Czechoslovak army, and then I found out later\non, when I met him after the war, in Prague, how terrible all these officer were treated.\nHe worked in a coal mine for years, because he was a officer of the Czech army during\nthe occupation of the Germans.",
        "Q: During the war?",
        "A: During the war, yes, yes.",
        "Q: He was not Jewish [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, he was not Jewish. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t --",
        "Q: He wouldn\u2019t [inaudible].",
        "A: Cramp -- Cramp in my foot. Yeah.",
        "Q: What about return visits to Sobibor?",
        "A: I never made it, and maybe I should have gone, but what would I have seen there? I\nhave ha -- I have pictures. There is nothing there but a elevated mass of -- of soil, and a\nmonument in memory of those who got killed there. And I c -- I couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t do\nanything for them anyways, so I -- no -- so I -- I never went. There was a big -- There\nwas a big gathering, and I think that Mr. Blatt was there, too. I was the only one missing,\nat the 50\" years anniversary of the uprising, I believe. That would have been \u201943 -- in \u201993,\nthere was. And I have, someplace, even pictures. You can remind Mr. Blatt that he was\nthere too.",
        "Q: One more question then. Did you make a conscious decision not to have children?\nWas that something that -- that meant anything to you?",
        "A: I tell you, we considered -- we were talking about adopting and I could not, at the time\nat least, accommodate my mind, that I could love a child which is not of my blood. So we\ndropped the idea.",
        "Q: Is there anything you want to add or say?",
        "A: No, I want to thank you for being patient, and coming here, and I hope that we\nfulfilled our historical duty, to put on the tape, whatever I could remember.",

Do you think that could have anything to do with it?",

        "A: No, not as -- not any specific way, although I -- I awake in the morning, on the 23\", or\nrather on the 224, already, when I saw them the last time, and think of them. I know I\nthink of them and of the events, daily, without wanting to even, it just come into my\nmind, and I am trying to analyze and study what actually happened, and why it happened.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t question any more, | think that I have my answers. I think I have my\nanswers. I feel that the German nation was misled, and that there is not only -- there are\ntwo entities who are guilty of mass murder. We know of the executioners, it was Hitler\u2019s\npolitical cronies, who went along with him, to eliminate the Jewish people wherever he\ncould get them. But anti-Semitism was -- or racism, whatever you want to call it, goes\nback centuries, many centuries, and the original sin was committed by Christians, by the\nchurch, which actually propagated, I would say the -- the persecutions of Jews, by\naccusing the Jewish people of whatever was convenient for them. For instance, up to\ntoday, the idea that the Jews killed Christ, prevails within a large segment of people who\ndo not know history. It is known, for instance, that the crucifixion was an act of erga --\nRomans. It was their law by which they -- by which they sentenced people to death. The\nJews stoned. And I want to tell you a very interesting story. I met, a year ago, a lady of\nthe name Anna Rubenstein, who wrote a couple books, I believe three books. She a foo --\nsurvivor of Auschwitz, and after the war, because of her English lang -- English\nknowledge, she got a job in a little town someplace in Germany, to help displaced\npersons, from all over Europe, of different nationalities. And she became responsible for -\n- I believe, if I remember well, for 8,000 people, and got a very responsible, big job there.\nOne day she got -- she was asked by a German doctor, whether she would come with him\nto inspect a ward of sick people in the hospital, which was also in that same s -- 1n that\nsame area where she worked. And when they entered a ward, a woman attacked her\nverbally and physically in Polish, and told her, \u201cYou are Jewish, you should not be alive.\nYou killed Christ.\u201d With this one sentence, this Polish woman told the whole story. The\ncurse on the Jewish people, which is a historical injustice, carrying on through centuries,\nwhich culminated this time in the Holocaust, but there were many events prior to that.\nYou can look at the Inquisition, the Crusades, at individual abuses of fuhrer, masters in\nEurope, in Russia, all over. Wherever Christianity was the main religion. And never was\nanything done on the side of the church, to dispel these wrong rumors, even up to today.\nWhatever that Pope has done up to now, is by far not enough. I think the church owes us\nan apology. They should -- stop it, please -- they should admit, confess, and atone for\nwhat they have done. I think this is what they owe us, and it would also elevate the moral\nstanding of the church, which up to today is only hiding and el -- and not coming out s --\ndirectly of what happened. There\u2019s another interesting thing which came into my mind.\nProtestantism was founded in Germany at least, by Martin Luther. Martin Luther\noriginally protested against the abuses of the church, by being bought off for money, and\nultimately was the founder of the Protestant movement in Germany. Although he was\nsensitive to what the abuses of the church, he took with him the anti-Semitism of the\nchurch, by putting his feces on the church, I believe, in Brittenburg, where he asked for\nthe banishment of the Jews unless they became Christians, and of their -- of killing them,\nwhich is very interesting, and that only sh -- tells me how great and how deep the belief\nof the Jewish guilt was implanted in not only the population, but also among the\nintellectuals of the church itself.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: I -- I do not believe that anything like that would be possible again, and I want to\nemphasize today, in my own mind, a tremendous change in government -- in government\nforming of -- of laws. Originally, if a government persecuted people, oppressed people,\nkilled people, nobody interfered. At best -- There was an article in the paper, thanks to\nthe courage of our President Clinton, and to NATO, that a change in this attitude finally\ncame about, when we declared war on Milosevitch, who was oppressing his own people,\nand abusing the other minorities within Yugoslavia. This is a historical event of\ntremendous impact for the future. And I think we should call this the Clinton Doctrine. I\nam -- I am highly impressed and very satisfied and happy that this happened, not because\n-- not because of myself, but in general terms, for the sake of mankind.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think, I know this is the first time, and never anything -- never anything like\nthat happened. Even, you have a case here with Pinochet. There is still a dispute whether\nhe is guilty or not guilty for killing people during the time when he was in power. Now\nthey figured out that he is guilty now only from a certain date in England, when they\nreversed their thinking.\nAmerica and the world did not do, there -- there -- perhaps there was pressure on the\ngovernments to actually take action now, in a way that they didn\u2019t then.",
        "A: Well, I believe that a few sensitive people might have been influenced by the tremen -\n- by the terrific injustice which happened during the second World War, toward the\nJewish people, and those who resisted the Nazi doctrines. But generally speaking, if -- if\nNATO, under the leadership of Clintons, wouldn\u2019t have done what they have done, the\nthing could have been again forgotten. As a matter of fact, from what I have been\nlistening, to stories about the -- memorials about the Holocaust and so forth, nobody ever\ntouched the church, which is guilty just as much as the Germans themselves, for what has\nhappened.",
        "A: Oh, I -- I can tell you as far as the religion is concerned, I personally believe that\nreligions were necessary to raise the standards, the moral standards of the population.\nWhatever abuses happened later on, by trying to exert power over their own people, and\noppress others, this is a different story. Personally, I was raised in a home -- in a Jewish\nhome, by birth, but we were not religious. We kept a kosher house, because of my\nfather\u2019s father, who was a widower. When he passed away, 1n his early 80\u2019s, my sister\nand myself said, \u201cMom, let\u2019s stop that kosher deal, we want to eat everything.\u201d And that\nwas the end of the kosher household. Personally, I believe that Moses himself was one of\nthe greatest, if not the greatest statesman, by inventing the 10 commandments and giving\nthem to the people as a guide for morality, for life. And I also am convinced that Jesus,\nanother Jew, was another very great man, great statesman, who spread the teachings of\nJudaism in his own way, as a Reformer of Judaism rather than sticking to the old ways of\nthe Jewish religion.",
        "A: Oh, they were spiritual figures, but with a political result. And the spirituality is\nterrific, if you can believe in it, and important is that you should then do what they tell\nyou to do, what they wrote down that God said, but not whatever pleases anybody to his\nown advantage.",
        "A: Ah the experience in camp only confirmed my conviction that there is no God, that it\nis people who make their life, for other people, either nice, or miserable. And anything\nelse is just an individual need. Some people need to believe that they will go to heaven\nafter they die. I believe that I will go -- after I die, will be either co -- cremated, and that\nwill be the end of -- because I don\u2019t believe in -- either in heaven, nor in a purgatory.",

        "A: My original name was Ticho, T-1-c-h-o, which is an old family name, which goes back\ninto the 13\" century, in Boskovice. There were, according to the chronicle which I read,\nlong before the war, but which I cannot locate now, and I tried to ask people to find it,\nthere were originally, in 1492, that was the year when Columbus discovered America,\nthree Jewish families living in Boskovice, under the castle. Their name was Horvald,\nStefanski, and Ticho. The-There are very interesting things. One of the people who\nsurvived the war, was Mr. Ignatz Horvald, who was married to a Gentile woman, and he\nwas, at that time, when the war broke out, he must have been in the late 60\u2019s or early 70\u2019s\nand somehow the Germans didn\u2019t even intern him, at the end of the war, what they did to\nevery other member of a mixed marriage. He survived, and he lived in the same section,\nwhich is mentioned in the chronic, under the castle. Now, at my time, there were my\nfamily Ticho, then there was a company of the name Brothers Ticho, which was owned\nby two brothers of a family of 13 children, two daughters and 11 sons. They were not\nrelated to us, we did not acknowledge any relationship between us. Then there was a third\nTicho, Max Ticho senior. To distinguish it from my father, Max Ticho junior, who was\nthe son of George Ticho, who also did not acknowledge any relationship to the other two\nTicho families. During the occupation of Czechoslovakia, there came to Boskovice,\nanother man of the name Ticho, a tailor who lived in Vienna, but originated in\nBoskovice, and then came to Boskovice, my father\u2019s cousin, from a little town called\nSwitofka, and these were all the Tichos, as far as I remember.

        "A: They were non-Jews, yeah, there was -- there were no Jews left. As a matter of fact,\nsome 443 people, if I am exactly to the -- to the exact number, were deported on March\nthe 14\" and 15\", 1942. Of those, seven came back alive. The Hanak family, with Mr.\nHorace Hanak, his wife Greta, and their daughter Vera, they survived in Theresienstadt,\nbecause he was maintaining the water works, or work -- or works -- worked on the\nmaintenance of the waterworks in -- in Theresienstadt, and the Germans needed the water\nfor themselves, is where three people. The fourth was a Mrs. Clara Stickelmacher, who\nhad some kind of a job, and survived, was four. Eric Brill, who lived today in Frankfurt,\nwho survived Dachau. Mitzi Brown, a sister of Mrs. Hanak, who survived Auschwitz and\nother camps. She is still alive in Bernau today in the capital of Moravia, and myself.

The transport stopped on what they called the Walhoff hill, where the city\nstarted. And as we stopped with our trucks, I jumped off the truck, and out came from the\nfirst house, a woman.

And there\nmust have been -- there must have been some people of non-Polish, or non-Russian\nethnicity, who probably did not know what was going on, because the -- the uprising was\nentirely in the hands of one Russian officer, and a group of Polish -- other Polish Jews,\nand they didn\u2019t trust anybody else. They treated me as an exception.",
        "A: Because I proved through my behavior that I\u2019m not a traitor, that I was helping\nanybody who needed help and I could do anything for him. By which I mean -- I believe\nit was in March -- end of March or beginning of April, 1942, when Dr. Subeese, Dr.\nNink, and Dr. Breslev. Breslev was Polish, Nink and Subeese were Dutch physicians.\nBreslev was a specialist for dentistry, but he was still an MD. In Europe you had to\nbecome an MD and then specialize in dentistry. And th-these men came to me and told\nme they heard a rumor that the Germans will allow the Jews to be sick for three days.\nAnd they said, \u201cProviding that would happen, we would like you to take on the job.\u201d I\nsays, \u201cOkay.\u201d It didn\u2019t take long, and during the appelle, Chaffearal Fransel, I guess, who\nI testified in Hagen, two times and once in Frankfurt, I believe -- Frankfurt or col --\nCologne? I don\u2019t know now, which one of the two cities -- told us that they are looking\nfor somebody who will take care of the sick. And I raised my hand and he said, \u201cWhat\nkind of a qualification do you have, or how -- how can you do that?\u201d So I lied to him and\nI told him that I was a sanitary non-com officer, in the Czechoslovakian army, and I got\nthe job. Now since I knew that Jewish people can be sick now for three days, as soon as\nsomebody was not able to go to work -- prior to the point of course, if you couldn\u2019t be\nable to -- if you were not able to go to work, they took you what they called in the -- into\nthe Lazarette, and they shot you. Pardon me. So I wrote down, for instance, Arwin\nDonohue got sick on June the 22\". So you -- w-we --were legally sick, allowed to be\nsick, 22 - 23 - 24.

So the -- then they said, \u201cKurt, how\nmany sick?\u2019 I said, \u201cEight.\u201d In most cases, they accepted my number, but sometimes they\nwent to the barracks and all the sick one had to come out, to double check, and that\nFransel did it that way, and Wagner, he never let them come out, but I had to come with\nhim to the door of the barracks and call the name, and the sick one had to answer, to\nmake sure that there is no cheating. Now, through my function, actually, I\u2019d had to save\nmy life. There was a fellow of the name Leon Friedman, he cames from washa --\nWarsaw. A ve-very nice young fellow, maybe 19 - 20 years old.

        "A: Yes, I went into the yard, and opened the little gate of -- which was surrounding their\nthatched roof house, and looked into the kitchen through the kitchen door, where they\nwere eating dinner, and on a -- with a petrol lamp. And a little while later -- it was pitch\ndark, it was a cloudy day -- cloudy -- cloudy night -- a little while later, the homeworker -\n- his name was Joseph, opened the door and went down the two or three steps to the gate\nand left, didn\u2019t see me. And it dodn -- didn\u2019t take long, and the farmer came out on the\nusual routine, to check the barn, whatever, and let the dog loose. And as soon as he\nopened the door, I whispered, \u201cKoss padashu.\u201d That means in Polish, farmer, but it\u2019s --\nit\u2019s a title at the same time. And he recognized me immediately, and he says. \u201cWhere do\nyou come from?\u201d And I says, \u201cI escaped from a camp and I came to save my life with\nyou.\u201d And he says, \u201cMarno.\u201d That means in vain. And then he says, \u201cCome with me.\u201d\nAnd --",
        "A: Because he probably wasn\u2019t ready to -- to keep me. And then, as we walked toward\nthe -- this stable, the horse stable and the cow stable, he said to me, \u201cI owe you some\nmoney.\u201d From that you can see what an honest person he was. I sold him a suit in which\nhe took a picture with his wife. I have that pic -- I have that picture, and I says, \u201cI don\u2019t\nneed any money, I have some money.\u201d And then he says, \u201cBut allete samiastish.\u201d That\nmeans, but you are alone, with an emphasis on the but. And I said, \u201cYes.\u201d Because I\nfigured out right away if I would have tell -- told him that we are two, that my chances\nwould be even smaller. Today I know that I was thinking of Otto, but he was thinking of\nEmmie, my friend from Piaski, who once in awhile came out onto his farm in summer,\nand sunned herself on the lawn someplace, and then in the evening we went back together\ninto the ghetto. And he wanted probably to know whether Emmie is with me. That --\nThat\u2019s where the misunderstanding, and it came into my mind only much later. Anyhow,\nwe came to that stable. He says to me, \u201cYou wait here,\u201d and went out and locked it from\nthe outside -- the door from the outside. I couldn\u2019t get out. After awhile he came back.\nBrought me a bottle of hot -- hot tea, or hot coffee, if you may -- want to call it coffee, it\nwas chicory with milk. And the bread, which they baked every Monday, for the whole\nweek, but they break fo -- they bake one loaf of sweet bread, and then I told you, I\nbelieve, in this story, too, which was a mixture of poppy seed and sugar beets and white\nmea -- white flour, while the rest of the bread was rye -- wy -- was rye bread, dark rye\nbread. So that he gave me, and he spread on the f -- on the floor, in the straw there, a little\nhome-woven carpet and said, \u201cI come to see you in the morning,\u201d and locked the door\nfrom the outside, and that was it. I had no way to get back to Otto. Early in the morning,\nhe took me -- he opened the door from the stable and took me across the ya -- across the\nyard in the barn and says, \u201cCrawl up there someplace and hide.\u201d Which I did. In the\nafternoon, when I was really rested, I came down, and later on, Mrs. Pocharlie came with\nanother bottle of hot tea and two big slices of rye bread with lard. And that was the first\nfood I had on that day. And she told me that at night, partisans came and wanted their\nbicycle. So I put one and one together and figured that I told Otto that Toidya, their\ndaughter, Theodora, commutes on a bicycle from Selishky to Piaski, where he -- where\nshe worked. And he must have been -- come into touch with them. That is my theory, but\nI believe it makes sense. When I came back after the war, I tried to find Otto, whether he\ncame back into his native town of Chabeetch, in Moravia, but nobody knew of him, so he\nmust have perished during the war.",
        "A: Yeah, I think about him once in awhile, but I didn\u2019t know him too much. He came into\nthe camp, maybe only with the last transport from Bialystok, which must have been two\nor three weeks before the uprising. There came a few Czech people, he was one of them,\na fellow of the name Shtasni was another one, and otherwise, I -- I don\u2019t remember any\nmore. But hi -- While he were -- While we were already in the forest, he just came to me,\nand he says, \u201cIll go with you.\u201d And that\u2019s how it happened.",
        "A: I was in hiding from Friday -- no, from Monday, October the 19\", until the very end\nof July. And I know it was the very end of July, because my late sister\u2019s birthday was the\n20 - 24\"\". I knew the date once in awhile, because my farmer threw up to me, a paper\nwhich he bought in Piaski, whenever he went to Piaski. And that gave me the date, and I\nknew when a Sunday was, because there was quiet on the -- on the yard. Th-The pe --\nThe f -- The farmers did not work on that day. So I knew on the 24\" -- the 24\" of July, I\nbelieve was a Saturday. I would like to check this out that Iam right. And on that day, on\nthat day, a tank went through the yard, which was the way into the fields, and also to the\nmain road to Piaski. And I remember being in the straw there, I hear a noise coming\ncloser and closer until everything was shaking. And I went through to the straw roof and\nlooked through my little peephole, and there I saw a tank going through and leaving. That\nwas the 24\" of July, I believe, on m-my sister\u2019s birthday. I would like to check whether it\nwas really a Saturday. And then, a few days later -- then there was shooting, and\nwhatever, which I dis -- already mentioned in my report originally -- in the interview.\nThe --",
        "A: No?",
        "A: Then I will -- Then I will tell you what happened.",
        "A: A few days before that tank already came, I could hear far away, artillery shooting,\nartillery cannon. Then later on, I could also hear machine guns. And then that -- one day\nthat tank went through and a day later, I believe, I see a commotion in the yard from my\nvanta -- vantage point on the attic of the pig sty, from which I could see almost the whole\nlength of the yard, not what was beyond me on the side where the barn was, where the\nbarn started, but down there, yes. And there I see that my farmer, in a hurry, is putting the\nhorses 1-into the wagon and she was bringing out stuff of the ho -- from the house, to load\nit on the -- on the cart. And then suddenly I could hear bzzzz, like a whistle, and then an\nexplosion, and that was a sharpnel. And the farmeress stood there with a mug in her hand,\nand when she heard that noise, she crossed herself and got really pale and was beside\nherself. And her husband -- and they were a nice couple, he came to her and he says,\n\u201cThose,\u201d -- I could hear it, \u201cThose which you can hear, they are not dangerous. Those\nwhich you don\u2019t hear, they can kill you.\u201d By wi -- By which he mine -- m-meant that\nthose which he hears, they are flying far away. And then they disappeared. Now, from\nToidya I have later found out that they spent two days in the forest, hiding. And after they\ncame back one morning, I can hear a noise, a commotion on the yard. No, before that,\npardon me, I-I am -- I am going too far ahead. Then a group of Germans -- soldiers came\ninto the yard and disappeared within three or four hours. As a matter of fact, there were\nU-Ukrainians among them, mostly Ukrainians. And one of them opened the door to the\nshack, from which you then could get up onto the roof of the -- of the pigsty, and was\nlooking around there what\u2019s going on, and I's -- I -- how do we say, crawled on my\nstomach to the edge. Luckily, he didn\u2019t hear me, and when I saw him, it was a Ukrainian\nsoldier, one of those who actually guarded us in the camp. I slowly, but without any --\ncausing any noise, retreated and -- back, so that he wouldn\u2019t see me.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "A: And I can tell you, I heard my -- my heart poin -- pounding 1n ma -- in my -- I\nremember that like today, that 1t was the lucky day, because that was the crucial time.\nShortly after that, the Russians came. And he then left -- And then they left. Suddenly\nthat -- the -- got a command and they left. They were retreating. Then one morning, I\nlook out, and I can see a lot of commotion again in the yard, and there were carriages\nthere, with one horse between two like wooden shafts, with little carts. And there were --\nthe soldiers were mostly women, big busted, short women. They were Russian women\nsoldiers, who now were in the yard. And I think that they disappeared either the same\nday, or the next morning. And then my farmer came to me and says to me, \u201cDon\u2019t come\ndown yet. Wa -- Let\u2019s wait a couple days or so.\u201d Which, I was a -- wh-which I agreed\nupon. And then when he told me, then I came down and left -- or when I -- when I came\ndown, we star -- we stood at -- it was around noon time, we stood at the barn. And he\nsays to me, \u201cYou know,\u201d he knew that I wanted to fight the Germans, \u201cthere\u2019s a Czech\nlegion someplace. It is in pon -- Pordales Pordalsk. There you could join them.\u201d",
        "A: Kurt Ticho Thomas.",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "A: I think I stopped telling that I came down and we stood together at the barn. And Mr.\nPocharlie told me that there is a Czech legion, with headquarters in Communist Poldalsk,\nwhich 1s, I think the Ukraine. And I thanked him for saving my life, and I was sorry that\nhis wife wasn\u2019t there. And I told him, \u201cYou raised yourself a son.\u201d And I hugged him,\nand I left. He had -- Oh yeah, pardon me, he also told me, \u201cDon\u2019t go through the village,\u201d\nwhich is characteristic of the situation as he knew it. And he said, \u201cBecause, if they\nwould know that I saved a Jew, they would not -- they would now kill me.\u201d And by that\nhe meant his -- his villagers, which is another proof how deep the anti-Semitism was\nimbedded in the Polish population, generally. Although my -- my lifesaver was an\nexception. And I think these exceptions should be remembered someplace, so that the\nstigma of generalization would be punctured.",
        "A: Yes. Mr. and Mrs. Pocharlie were named as -- were -- were honored as Righteous\nGentiles during a ceremony in -- I believe in Warsaw, on my -- on my re-request.",
        "A: By Yad Vashem, yes, by Yad Vashem. As a matter of fact, I have seen the tree with\ntheir -- with -- with the little what 1s it, the little metal plate where their names are listed,\nand they are -- their name 1s also listed among the maybe 15 or 1800 Polish Righteous\nGentiles who saved Jews. And by the way, I want to mention that there are more Jews\nsaved by Poles than by any other nationality, at least in Yad Vashem, at the time I was\nthere. There was not one, as far as I remember, mentioned from the Czechoslovakia.\nThere might be some, but I haven\u2019t seen them.",
        "A: No, it is not exaggerated. It is actually and unfortunately a truth, a sad truth. But there\nwere a few who were -- very few, who had character, who had compassion and courage.\nThis is what ven -- was needed. You know, the Mrs. Pocharlie always addressed me\nMister. These people treated me unbelievably respectfully. I did my best to work for\nthem, but I think in that respect, they are an ec -- an exception to any other savior.",
        "A: They\u2019re -- They\u2019re -- They were just plain very, very nice [indecipherable] noble\npeople. You know that he -- After I had to leave their farm because the Germans gave\norders at the end of October, that no Jew can work out of the ghetto any more, and I --\nwhen I came -- before I came back, she told me I should hide behind the farm, and when\neverything will quiet down, f -- I should b -- I come back out again and that we will kill a\npig and eat pork and cabbage during the winter, then in spring the Mister will be able to\nwork with us a-again. But, in spite of that, I went back to the ghetto, and while I was\ngoing back to the ghetto, there was a Polish peasant with a bicycle and he was\nintoxicated, he was drunk, and couldn\u2019t use the bike, so he used it more as a support and\nhe s -- yelled to me, he says, \u201cJakog dat yadesh,\u201d Jewboy, where are you going? And I\nsays, \u201cI am going to the ghetto.\u201d He says, \u201cDon\u2019t go into the ghetto, they\u2019 Il kill you.\u201d\nThat was his warning to me. While I was a few days in the ghetto, somebody told me that\nI should come to the fence, to the barbed wire fence. And when I got there, I see my\nfarmer with his horses alongside, and as ha -- as soon as he spotted me, he lifted a s --\nburlap sack and threw it with a heave over the fence, and took his whip and he whipped\nthe horses to get away. He gave me in that sack, I found a lard and potatoes. And if\nanybody would have seen him on the German side, I wouldn\u2019t be here, and he wouldn\u2019t --\nand he wouldn\u2019t have lived to the end of his days and died of a normal life. That\u2019s how\ncor -- courageous and loyal he was to me.",
        "A: A-After the war, I didn\u2019t have any contact at all. I left Czechoslovakia at the end of\nJanuary of 1948, or -- or -- or middle of \u201948, yeah, for England and sailed on the Queen\nMary from Portsmouth, and arrived in the Uni-nited States on February the fourth, 1948.\nOn the boat I wrote a card, or a letter, to the Pocharlies, and forgot all about it, until\nToidya, with who I am still in touch, told me that she would like to find that piece of\nmail, but she never can find it. And then I started to correspond with -- with them in\nPolish and in Czech, and they answered in Polish and then later on, the Pocharlies gave\nup their farm and moved to Lublin to the daughter, and there they died. And then the son-\nin-law started to study English and from then on, we started to correspond in English.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s what -- That\u2019s what I understand that he did it, because of that. Maybe he had\nother -- Maybe he had other reasons, too, but to me he learned English, because he\nwanted to help his wife to stay in touch with me and make it easier.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Polish, because I learned a little Polish while I was in Poland, and it\u2019s a Slavic\nlanguage, and I had a -- I think I have some talent for languages, so I caught on. As a\nmatter of fact, while I worked on th -- first on the farm and then later on for him, at noon\ntime, we took those things which we smuggled out of the ghetto of Piaski, to sell them in\nthe village. So we went from house to house and we started to talk to the people and\nthat\u2019s how we learned a little more Polish.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, we spa -- spoke German in the home and I will give you the historical reasons\nfor this. Mora -- Czechoslovakia was originally part of the Austrian-Hungarian\nmonarchy. And the Jewish people were very grateful to the -- to Franz Joseph, I believe,\nwho came out in 1848, with some rights for the Jews. And one of the -- one of the strings\nattached were that the Jews have to go to Jewish school -- to German schools, to help\nGermanize the non-German speaking regions. Now, Boskovice was about 8,000 people,\nof which there were probably 350 - 400 Jews. There were more deported, because many\ncame from other towns at the time of the deportation, to Boskovice. So we spoke at home\n-- my father had only Jewish -- German schooling. My mother had German and\nHungarian schooling, because she came from Slovakia, which was under the jurisdiction\nof the Hungarians. And I considered myself a pure Czechoslovakian because my mother\nwas Slovak and my father was Czech. I am the only Czechoslovakian who escaped and\nsurvived Sobibor. I don\u2019t know how we came to this. Yeah, the -- the historical reason\nwhy we -- we spoke German, but in 1918, when Czechoslovakia was formed and I was\nfour years old, there was still a German school. But in 1920, the German school was\nclosed, and by the way, it was not attended only by Jewish children, z -- but also by some\nGentile children, whose parents wanted them to learn German.",
        "A: No, no. We didn\u2019t talk any Yiddish at all, we spoke only German, and I went to Czech\nschools and then later on, we spoke Czech at home. But originally, my mother language\nwas German.",
        "A: Nobody spoke Yiddish in the community, with the exception I know, that our cantor,\nMr. Gross, he spoke with his wife, Yiddish. And I really don\u2019t remember whether the\nrabbi spoke with his wife Hungarian. He came from Slovakia and he had Hungarian\nschooling. Or, whether he talked with her j -- Yiddish, I don\u2019t remember that. But the\nBoskovice Jewish population spoke only German, and had only German schools.",
        "A: He was politically an organized member of the Austrian German Social Democratic\nparty. We had in our home, pictures of Victor Adler, who I think was the head of the\nSocial Democratic party in -- in Vienna, and another one, Shoemayer was his name. I\nremember the names and these pictures were in our house and my father was a devoted\nGerman S-Social Democrat.",
        "A: Well, he was not only shocked, disappointed and -- but what could he do, I mean,\nthere were many more people who considered themselves Germans, or were 1n the sense\nof Hitler\u2019s, real Germans, and still did not go along with national Socialism.",
        "A: But they did not -- nobody ever thought that it will come to a organized extermination\nof the Jewish people. Nobody ever thought of that. As even I, I found out only when I got\nto Sobibor, after a day or two, what\u2019s happening.",
        "A: It was, it was. As a matter of fact, for about two or three days, I didn\u2019t want to talk\nGerman. And I don\u2019t know -- I think I mentioned it in my a -- interview in Washington,\nD.C., after I was taken out from the ranks of those who arrived that day, around 3,000 we\nwere, fr -- between the ghetto from Piaski and Izbitsa, they asked for textile experts and I\nraised my hand and I was taken out. And in the afternoon, I was already sorting the\nclothing of those who came with me.",
        "A: But before I even start working, while we were getting soup, I see there a girl who was\nwith my in Piaski and worked with me in Selishky, on that -- on the estate of that Polish\nnobleman who fled to England. His name was Bertha Collek. The same name as the long-\nstanding -- long and well-known mayor of Jerusalem. That was Teddy Collek, and her\nname was Bertha Collek. And her father happened to be the mayor in a little village not\nfar from Bernau, in Dumborshitz. And she came to me and I says, \u201cBertha, what\u2019s going\non here?\u201d And she says, \u201cKurt, be happy that you are here. The other people will have it\nmuch worse than we here.\u201d And with that she left with tears in her eyes.",
        "A: Well, you remember when, under Eisenhower\u2019s government, when Kruschev was in\nRussia at that time, the political boss, we had a spy in the air in a -- in a drone plane like.\nI forgot his name now. That man was -- landed -- I think he was shot down and landed\nalive. He had with him cyanide pills, I believe, to finish his life, but he didn\u2019t. And\nKruschev at that -- that time said, \u201cShtoji ott, horchesi ott.\u201d Whatever is alive, wants to be\nalive. And that was with me and with all those others in the camp, too. We hoped that it\nwill not u -- be us. Gary Powers, I think was the name of that f -- of that pilot. You\nremember the -- the thing, no?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh yes, he was arrested and they wanted him to inform about the Gentile population.",
        "A: Well, he had -- he was close with -- with a few Gentile people, and I believe that one\nof the Germans, local Germans, told the SS that my father might be the one who would\nbe able to give them some information. The man I think who I have in mind was\nEstelberger. And that is a very, very characteristic story. Before 1918, there were actually\ntwo political entities in Boskovice. One was the Jewish community and the other one was\nthe non-Jewish community. We had our own mayor, and our own police department. And\nthe policeman was this Mr. Estelberger, who was brought in from Austria to become the\nJewish policeman in Boskovice. That guy became a good Nazi, and I believe that he gave\nthe Gestapo the information about my father. He didn\u2019t survive the war. I -- I think that\nhe committed suicide. He had a daughter who had a son, his name was Alphonse Becka,\nB-e-c-k-a, with a little hook on the c. Becka means a barrel. Mr. Estelberger forced his\ndaughter\u2019s husband, his son-in-law, to become Germans, by which the grandson,\nAlphonse, became -- became liable to serve in the German army, and he lost his life,\nshortly after the war, in Russia. He paid for being a good German, Mr. -- Mr. Estelberger.",
        "A: My father --",
        "A: -- We -- He had Ge-Gentile friends, customers. For instance, one 0-0 -- was the man\nwho distributed cigarettes for the city and the vicinity and that does -- that was a position\nwhich you could get only when you were an invalid, a veteran after the first World War.\nAnd that was a Mr. Kosheneck. And -- And Julius Kosheneck had a reputation of being\nthe most unfriendly person you can find, but he was very friendly with my dad. And 0 --\none day, I remember, during the war, he brought a piece of pork to my mother and ask\nher to prepare it for him with spices and pepper, you know. And he did it and he brought\nit back to him in his -- in his store, whatever. I didn\u2019t know anything about it. When I\ncame back after the war, I went into this Mr. Kosheneck\u2019s store. And I said hello and we\ntalked a little bit. And then I says -- And then he offered me whether I would need leather\nfor soles. I says, \u201cThanks, Mr. Kosheneck, I don\u2019t need any.\u201d And then he says, \u201cI also\ncould give you hen -- honey.\u201d Because he was a beekeeper, that was his hobby. I says,\n\u201cThanks again,\u201d and I want to say goodbye, he says, \u201cJust a minute.\u201d And he says, \u201cPull\nout the drawer from that desk.\u201d I pulled out the drawer, there was nothing in it. He\u2019s,\n\u201cNow, put your hand into the opening, and to the left.\u201d And there was another opening --\nano-nother drawer, another handle, I pull this out, and there were a few jewels which my\nfather left with him. That\u2019s how decent the man was. There were other people where I\ntook stuff of ours, and either got back half, or nothing. But that was the unfriendly Mr.\nKosheneck, you know? He had character and he was decent.",

One morning, when I went from camp one, into camp two, to pick up some\ndrugs -- I was allowed to get cotton, iodine and salves. As I go -- walk through the lawn\nthere, whatever tha -- it was, there I see a little pile of clothing. And as I got closer and to\nit, I see on top two pictures. One was the wedding picture of Ilsa Bruell and Ziegfried\nLerfber, my friends. And the other picture was of Ilsa Bruell and her two younger sisters,\nRuth and Lydia. And then there was that little -- pardon me -- that little pile of clothing.\nSo I knew that they came at night, and they were shot right away, of course, and had to\nundress and they left it there. Now, when I came back to Boskovice, the father of the\nthree girls, Karl Bruell, survived because his second marriage as to a Gentile woman.\nAnd I slept in his house and he asked me when he can expect his children. And I told\nhim, \u201cYou have to be patient.\u201d I couldn\u2019t tell him what I know -- what I knew. He died in\n\"47, I think. Yeah, \u201946 or \u00b047.",
        "A: Oh [inaudible]. Well, we had a very nice family life. My mother was the most loving\nmother I could imagine. They were tolerant people, liberal people, understanding people.\nI had a very nice relationship with my sister. It was a -- We were a very nice family. And\nwe were five years apart.

So, I had a pair of britches, beautiful black\nboots, which the Russians took away from me and gave me another pair of bad boots.\nAnd then they took those away from me, another Russian, and gave me regular shoes,\nwith laces. So I cut off the front and put the money which I had had, into the lining of the\nshoe, because I figured these shoes, nobody will take and I will keep the money. But\nthat\u2019s what I wanted to tell you about the fact that I\u2019ds -- could not recall my being lost\nfor those -- about five, or s -- maybe six weeks.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Or -- Or -- Or Saragura --",
        "A: Once I got to Saragura, I was again -- I wasn\u2019t myself, but I could again think right, at\nleast, you know.",
        "A: I -- I -- [have no idea. That was a -- That was definitely -- There was definitely\nsomething what happened to my mind, because o-on the farm with Pocharlie, I had at\nleast the haven there, a certain degree of security. But here, I was under -- among\nstrangers, I didn't know the language, nothing. Yet, I made it. And this is what I\u2019m\nwriting him, this Mr. Ribol, the director of the museum, because he wants to know all the\ndetails from my youth on, and what happened during the war and where I was and -- and\nI tell him that, it\u2019s an absolute blank, I don\u2019t know, couldn\u2019t answer that.",
        "A: I hope, I hope. But I tell you what happened, why I say I hope. A few years ago, I\nwrote an answer to a historical book written by a fellow of the name Professor Bronsky,\nabout the Jews of Boskovice, and there were quite a few misstatements and anti-Semitic\nhints, and I wrote a letter, happened to be 14 pages again, and I succeeded through my\nGentile friends in Boskovice -- the local paper wouldn\u2019t print it, because I told them what\nI know about the Gentile people in Boskovice, how they behaved, almost like gen --\nGermans. A -- My professor of Latin\u2019s son joined the German army, and then he got --\nthen he disappeared -- it was one of them, but I had quite a few cases, where I told him\nwhat he didn\u2019t know, or what he didn\u2019t want to publicize, and the paper wouldn\u2019t\npublicize this. So then my friends arranged for having it in the museum, to visitors of the\nmuseum, and I sent them one issue, covered in plastic. Now, I found out later on again,\nthrough this Stanick, that the thing disappeared. Allegedly for historical reasons, they are\nstudying it. And in the letter to Ribol, I\u2019m writing now, also, \u201cI hope that it came back,\nand tell me why they took it away in the first place.\u201d I never got an answer from him yet.",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Oh yeah, I remember that. No, that was not in Piaski yet, it was in Boskovice. When I\nhad a job with this Mr. Stanick, the son, and that -- the father of Joseph Stanick, which\nyou are mentioning in the letter there. The tailors were home tailors, they took the stuff\nhome to sew it and bring it back to us, and I got him merchandise, I got him business\nfrom Vienna, and from Stuttgart in Germany, because I knew perfect German, how to\nwrite and I wrote to the Chambers of Commerce, and these people didn\u2019t have labor, but\nthey had some materials, so we are fini -- we were finishing it for them, and the tailors\nfrom the little villages around, which did the work for us, they were very grateful to me,\nand were bringing me illegally food, like butter, eggs, chicken, whatever. And I sent them\nto my mother, to the house directly, and she paid them for it, and then gave other people\nwho needed it. And my father at that time said that I would rather eat dry bread and drink\nplain water in freedom, than have plenty of here to eat. That\u2019s what it was.",
        "A: Oh yeah, I think I mentioned that too. It didn\u2019t come into my mind the deep meaning\nof it, until I was in the concentration camp, or in Piaski, in the ghetto, you know, how\nmuch ahead he was of thinking, and how already thought that I know everything. I was\nabout 28 years old at that time. Yeah, I remember that. But I forgot all about it, you\nbrought it back now into my mind. And -- And that I did -- I said, I think I said it there.",
        "A: What it meant to me, that freedom is priceless, period. And for freedom you have to\nfight, and you have to be watchful it shouldn\u2019t be taking away from you.",
        "A: And this is why I love so much this country.",
        "A: I -- When I arrived in New York, at the pier, my uncle was waiting for me. He was an\nemployee of the Shanley Hotel in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a very -- the finest hotel in\ntown, he was a maitre\u2019d\u2019. And he came to New York to pick me up, but the crossing was\n48 hours late, th-the first time ever for the Queen Mary, because of very bad weather.\nAnd he couldn\u2019t wait any longer, because the FBI took me to Ellis Island, because of that\ndumb doctor in Prague. When he examined me before the government would give me a\nvisa, they had to confe -- somebody had to confirm to them that I am well. So he asked\nme, \u201cWere you ever seriously sick?\u201d And I says, \u201cYes, at the age of 15, I had pleurisy,\u201d\nwith an [indecipherable]. And he wrote --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: And he asked me then, after he examined me, whether one can hear anything by\nlistening. I says, \u201cDoctor, you just took my x-rays and listened to me, you should know\nwhether there\u2019s anything or not.\u201d And he wrote a thing down that I had pleurisy at the age\nof 15, and when I arrived in the pier -- at the pier in New York, the FBI took three people\nfrom the boat -- four people. Two, I believe, either Russians or Ukrainians, one woman\nwho was Jewish, but allegedly was coming into the country on a proxy marriage, which\nsomething was not right, and I. These three people went into the -- on Ellis Island, into\nthe political section. I went into the Merchant Marine section, for an additional\nexamination. And two days later, one man came to me, I was playing chess with a\nGerman sailor, and he told me that I can get dressed and get out, and the German sailor\ntranslated it to me in English. And when I came then to the -- to the window, leaving Ellis\nIsland, there was a fellow waiting for me. His name was Kaufman from the -- from a\nJewish organization, from the -- I forgot now the name, and he took me -- w-we went on\nthe ferry from Ellis Island to long -- to -- to Manhattan. And there we went to a restaurant\nand I had a sandwich with cheese and ham, and some milk. And he ordered sandwich,\nand then I asked him how much I should tip, and how much I should tip in the check\nroom, and all that. And he brought me to the Pennsylvania gr-gr-grandel -- the\nPennsylvania railroad station, the Grand Central Station. And there I took a Pennsylvania\ntrain to Pittsburgh, where I arrived around one o\u2019clock at night. And in the meantime I\ncalled -- pardon me -- I called from Ellis Island yet, and he actually put the call through\nand I sat down and before I could sit down, it rang already. I was amazed, because I got\nthe call immediately. In Czechoslovakia, when I was calling somebody 20 miles away, it\ntook a half an hour before I could be connected. So that was the first pleasant surprise, h-\nhow communications work.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: The ocean? Two ye -- Two days longer, 48 longer -- I believe five days, instead of\nthree, or six instead of four. I don\u2019t -- that I don\u2019t know any more. That was the old\nQueen Mary.",
        "A: I was -- I was -- I was happy that I was -- that I was going to America. I slept together\nwith another fellow, down in the lowest quarters, on a berth above him. And he was born\nin this country, but fortly before the war, his mother came back to Slovakia, his father\nwas still here. And then he came back again as an American citizen, but he didn\u2019t speak a\nword English. So I says, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d He told me in Slovak, of course. He\nsays, \u201cConnecticut,\u201d and the city, he forgo -- I forgot now the city. He pronounced it, the\n-- the -- the phonetic way, as it is written, you know, that was so funny, today. At that\ntime, I didn\u2019t know better, either. I forgot the name of the city.",
        "A: Czech and German, and a little Polish. And a little -- I learned a little Jewish in the\ncamp, too, from the Polish Jews, you know.",
        "A: No. Oh, I -- very little, I mean, I tried to learn English, but this was all forgotten.",
        "A: Oh yeah. So then, when I arrived, they were waiting for me, my aunt, my uncle and\nmy cousin, they had the DeSoto car, and they took me home in the -- into their house, and\nit was a nice little house, in the campus of the Carnegie -- the Carnegie Technical\nInstitute. And I was going to med -- I was going to English elementary school with little\nkids, for about six or eight weeks. And then I went to high school, Taylor Alderdise High\nSchool in Pittsburgh, and then during the summer, I took summer course, again in the al -\n- Taylor Alderdise High School, and because my uncle didn\u2019t want me to go to work until\nI get a little bit settled, and he was so good to me, like a father.",
        "A: Leo Steiner. That\u2019s -- There\u2019s his picture. That\u2019s the man. And then he -- I got a job\nthrough my cousin\u2019s wife\u2019s father, who had a store with pants, and through the salesman\nof the company for who he was buying, I got the job as a cutter, in Beaver Falls,\nPennsylvania. I had to get up at five in the morning, to be, by 6:30 or so, in the railroad\nstation, Pennsylvania, Lake Erie railroad, to get to Beaver Falls before eight o\u2019clock, to\nget into the plant. And then, in the evening I rushed home, and twice a week I went to the\nUniversity of Pittsburgh, to get English history and English. And there were two veterans,\nGIs who copied my work.",
        "A: \u2019'm not kidding you. And when I came back home from school, I was so tired that I\nbarely ate my dinner, and lied down, and the next morning, again to the railroad station.\nAt the end of the year, before Christmas, they gave me a box of candy and told me I\nshouldn\u2019t come any more, because they are closing up the plant, which I was so happy\nthat I didn\u2019t have to go back to that work any more. Then I had other jobs, 1n a -- ina\ngrocery store, in a umbrella shop and again in a pants factory. I mean, that one I was\npacking rather than cutting. No, I was working in the cutting room, too. And also in -- in\nthe -- in the room where we put orders together. And from there I went on the road with\nready to wear, through the help of a Miss Bertha Strouth -- Strouse was her name. Sh -- H\n-- She was a buyer in a -- one of the department stores in Pittsburgh, and through friends\nwho I made in Pittsburgh, their name was Albert and Laura Davis, they wanted to help\nme out of my menial jobs, and through them I got acquainted with her. She acquainted\nme with a salesman who didn\u2019t want to travel in Ohio. He wanted to travel only in and\naround Pittsburgh. So I took his line on, and that\u2019s how I met my wife, because she\nowned with her brother a little ready to wear store, ladies ready to wear.",
        "A: Her name was Tina Zacks, Z-a-c-k-s.",
        "A: I met her in 1953. In 1952 I started to travel, in 1953 I met her, in 1954 we got married\nand I moved to Columbus, and then my ankle -- uncle and my aunt moved also to\nColumbus. That was his sister, they were brother and sister. She was a widow, and he\nwas a bachelor.",
        "A: Yes, yes. They came here because I was here.",
        "A: Well, we were always a very closely knit family, my mother and her four siblings.\nOne brother came here already before the first World War, but I never saw him because\nhe died before I arrived. And then Uncle Leo, who took over. His sister, with two\nchildren from Vienna, when Hitler came in there. And -- And then I had the two cousins\nhere, and another cousin who lived close to Pittsburgh, and they tried to make my life\nvery nice. I have a very nice relationship, they were very kind to me. And I finally\nAmericanized, you know, and became, I hope, a good citizen.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah. As a matter of fact, when I wrote my first letter to the United States,\nwhen the mails started to function in \u201949 -- 1946, I wrote to Uncle Leo and Aunt Ilinor,\nmy life in the camp, and he used this during one of the meetings of some organization in\nthe Shandley Hotel at that time, I remember -- I was told later on, when I came here, of\nwhat was going on.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think that they did have to, because I n -- I needed to. Today I don\u2019t. Today I --",
        "A: Today I am not hundred percent, but I would say maybe 90 percent of what I used to\nbe, before all this happened.",
        "A: Oh some of them didn\u2019t want to listen and some people told me I should already stop,\nyou know. They me -- They meant it well. Th-That was my imbalance. There was a\nmental imbalance, definitely. I said yesterday, I -- accidentally, to my sister-in-law, the\nwife of my wife\u2019s brother. My wife\u2019s brother was her husband, he passed away. I says,\n\u201cFlorence, you know, when I got into your family, I wasn\u2019t right.\u201d She says, \u201cI know that,\nKurt. We know -- We knew that.\u201d But they -- they accepted me too, and treated me just\nlike I would be theirs.",
        "A: In any way. Any way. | had to -- the same right and the same obligations, like\nanybody else.",
        "A: I -- I was not my old Kurt. I was very much influenced with my past.",
        "A: Not that I was thinking, but I ch -- 1-1-it influenced my thinking. I was -- As I told you\nbefore, when I finally hit the SS man in the jaw, after that point, even in my\nunconscience, I was afraid.",
        "A: No, that was when -- in -- in this country already, I was dreaming -- I had a nightmare,\nalways the same nightmare, that Sharfihrer Wagner is -- was chasing me, and I always\nescaped someplace in the straw. Jumped someplace and lie in the straw, and he couldn\u2019t\nfind me any more. Until one night, I\u2019m dreaming again the same thing. Suddenly I\nstopped running, and made a fist and hit him in his jaw. And from then on, I never had\nthe nightmare any more, and I improved definitely, in my mental attitude, toward the\npublic -- toward the non-Jewish public, because at the time when I came, I suspected in\nthe first place anybody again, who is non-Jewish, might be -- want to harm -- wanted to\nharm me, or whatever, you know. Thi-This is something, but it\u2019s not easy to understand,\nand it is not easy for me to explain.",
        "A: That I -- That I don\u2019t remember, but it was quite awhile. It could have been a couple\nof years, I don\u2019t know. But I do not know, I really can\u2019t -- this is just a guess.",
        "A: As a-- As a matter of fact, I was so intimidated also, that I didn\u2019t talk English in the\npublic, when I was in a bus with somebody, I wouldn\u2019t open my mouth. It took me two\nyears, before I started to talk English in a bus, or in a restaurant, you know? I was --\nBecause I felt that I\u2019m foreigner, I have an accent -- today it doesn\u2019t bother me, I know I\nhave an accent, but I don\u2019t give a hoot.",
        "A: We spoke English, only English. When I arrived, and we got to bed at night, and the\nnext morning, when I came into the kitchen, and my aunt was giving me breakfast and\nshe started to talk to me German. I said, \u201cAuntie, please, don\u2019t talk to me German, only\nEnglish, whether I understand or not. I don\u2019t want to talk German, I want to learn\nEnglish.\u201d And we never spoke German.",
        "A: You know, the expectation of America were very much different what the reality was.\nI thought that everybody is rich, and that nobody works. And I found out that the majority\nof the people are not rich, the great majority, and even the rich one work. I also thought --\n[ -- I -- I was not aware of the fact of the national coherence of ethnic groups. I thought\nthat they are separated, but as far as the nation concerns, America, if he\u2019s Polish or\nItalian, you say something against the country, and I\u2019m sure that they would -- they\nwould not like it. Th-That was another very pleasant experience for me. And the equality,\nthat everybody is protected by the law, and has the same obligation, like anybody else.\nAnd the idea of a Lincoln, to build a nation by -- by mixing, by respect and cooperation\nand understanding for everybody, this all I didn\u2019t -- I have no -- I had no idea who\nLincoln was. It was en -- It was entirely -- I was tra -- a transplanted tree, from one\norchard, into another orchard, in another climate.",
        "A: Yeah, I was interested, I want -- wanted to know what was going on and what --\nwhat\u2019s going on now, and so forth.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know -- I didn\u2019t know how to take it. I didn\u2019t know how to take it, because\nnobody made any remarks. As a matter of fact, I got -- I arrived here in 1948. When I got\nmarried in 1954, we took a honeymoon to Canada, and there, for the first time, I heard an\nanti-Jewish remark. In Canada, not here.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know any more what it was. We were in a store and somebody made some\nnasty remark about Jews. In Canada. I don\u2019t know any more which city it was, but I re --\nthat I remember dis-distinctly.",
        "A: Oh yeah, no, I was -- I was already Americanized. I was already a American citizen.\nNo, I was not citizen yet. Yeah, I was citizen, yeah, because otherwise I couldn\u2019t have\ngone to -- to Canada.",
        "A: That happened, I believe, in 1953. The huge gathering by a judge, and a clerk of the\ncourt, in a big building in Pittsburgh, downtown. I don\u2019t know whether it was the\ncourthouse, or whatever. And there were for -- I was prepared, I was studying for it, and\nthen they gave us a few questions, and if you answered, you became a citizen, and if you\ndidn\u2019t answer, you get a citizen too.",
        "A: Definitely, but I want to tell you, once I got into this country, I got a little green card,\nfor identification. Not once, until I became a citizen, was anybody ever asking me about\nmy identity. No policemen, nobody. It was just a entirely different life. In my old\ncountry, if you went to visit somebody for more than 48 hours, you had to report it to the\npolice. That\u2019s what they call a police state. When my late grandmother came to visit with\nus, she had to go to the police and tell them, \u201cI came from Warscarvas, Ill be staying\nwith my brother -- with my son-in-law and my daughter, Mr. and Mrs. Ticho,\u201d such an\naddress. And the day before she was leaving, she had to tell him she is leaving, where she\nis going again. And that was a democratic state at the time, already. All Czechoslovakia\nwas a democratic state. The only one in central Europe.",
        "A: Where, here?",
        "A: I did not have any non-Jewish acquaintances, with the exception that when I traveled,\nI had to, of course, approach any buyer, whether he was Chinese or Protestant, or Jewish,\nwhatever. But these were nice business friendships. As a matter of fact, I am still in touch\nwith the former buyer of the May Company, Betty Flaherty, and one happened to be a\nJewish fellow, Buddy Fagersner, who was also in a Cleveland store. But I was very\nfriendly with -- with my buyers and they had great confidence in me. And when my wife\ndied, I remember one of the ladies made some preserve, then gave it to me, you know, I\nshouldn\u2019t -- I should have some home cooking, whatever.",
        "A: I was selling these dresses, trying to sell the dresses, when I came into the store called\nTaft\u2019s, in Columbus, Ohio. And she wasn\u2019t there at the time, her sister-in-law was there,\nand she asked me, \u201cHow does your wife like it when you are travel from col -- from\nPittsburgh to Ohio, and you are at home only over a weekend?\u201d I says, \u201cI\u2019m single.\u201d So\nthen they introduced me to the single girl in the family, and that\u2019s how it happened.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, 1-1-it -- it was, yes. It -- It -- It -- It was, although it didn\u2019t matter to me whether\nshe was ir-irrelig-religious, or religious, but somehow there was a cultural background, a\ncultural need.",
        "A: I don -- I -- I didn\u2019t know any Gentile women anyways. So, I mean, I don\u2019t know\nwhether -- if I would have | -- fell in love with a Gentile woman, maybe I would marry\nher too, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, the whole family wanted to know, they were very interested in what --\nwhat\u2019s going on, and they were very -- they are very active in Jewish causes, you know?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh definitely, definitely. For instance, my nephew -- my wife\u2019s nephew --\nformer wife\u2019s nephew, is today president of the Jewish congregation in Columbus. He\u2019s\nvery active in Jewish activities, and also a very ardent Republican, who is very friendly\nwith -- for instance, President Bush. And his mother 1s a outstanding -- absolutely\noutstanding -- I would call her a genius. Not only in Jewish causes, but sh-she\u2019s an\ninventor, and she very g -- very generous, help people. Not only Jews, non-Jews -- non-\nJewish organizations. I remember sh-she helped a woman to become an opera singer, for\nyears supporting her, a non-Jewish woman. And when she was finally an opera singer\nand gave a performance in Cincinnati, we went down there to see her.",

I was a cutter and I was tired, and I read the paper, but I didn\u2019t -- I was not in -- not\ninto the global politics yet at all. That came at -- That\u2019s why I say, I changed. I developed\nagain into what I used to be. It was a long process. On -- Only it -- it -- and only it came\nalong because of the environment in which I lived, and it was protect -- it was protective\nand understanding.",
        "A: No. I would say it\u2019s about maybe 90.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I tell you how it happened originally. A fellow with who I worked in the camp,\ntogether in a little -- a little building, his name was Friedberg, Alfred Friedberg from\nFrankfurt, Germany. He was a -- His hobby was painting. And we worked together in this\nlittle place, on little items, sorting them out and deliver them to the Germans. And I found\n[indecipherable] money. And one day one of the Ukrainians, which have close by kept\nthe horses, came into our place, and picked up a fountain pen and a pencil, whatever, and\nI had the money there prepared, and he picked up the money too, German marks. And the\nnext day he came and brought us a liter of vodka and a kilo of Polish kielbasa. And that\nwent on all the time I -- we worked in this -- in this little place. Every second day we got\na kilo and a liter. The liter we gave away, we didn\u2019t drank it. Gave it to some other goy --\nboys. But the salami kept us alive, until that stopped, the job there stopped. There was no-\nnothing met to sort, and I went back into the sorting department and then I became sick.\nGot the flu or the typhoid fever, I don\u2019t know what it was. But that I mentioned in the --\nin my --",
        "A: -- memories there. And then I became the sanitator, the man who was taking care of\nthe sick people. And what did you ask me originally?",
        "A: Oh. Oh yes. This Friedberg got the job to make the labels for the SS when they were\ngoing back to Germany, the address labels on their lugga-luggage. And he had any name\nbut of the commander of the camp and of Sharfthrer fr -- Wagner. Wagner was too\nshrewd to give it to anybody. And at one time he told me, \u201cYou know, Frenzel lives in\nthe -- close to Berlin, and he gave me the n -- city\u2019s name, which contained the word\nlerver, lion in German, and I think berg or borg. I don\u2019t know how it happened, after the\nwar I wrote a letter to some German office, mentioning that we had Sharfthrer Frenzel,\nwho was very brutal, and he lived in this city, which has the word lerver and berg or\nborg. And I didn\u2019t pay any attention to the whole thing, I didn\u2019t hear anything. When I\nwas in Frankfurt, I believe, at the trial, 1t was the last trial, there was a public persa --\npersecutor, his name was Pfeiffer, very nice young man, and he called me aside and he\nsays to me, \u201cYou know, because of your tip, we went to -- we went, looked at the map,\nfound the town next to Berlin, found Mr. Frenzel working as a carpenter, which he was\noriginally, on a stage in a theater. And that\u2019s how we got him.\u201d And then I testified\nagainst him, I was called as a witness. The first time in 1966, and then later again, and\nthen he was sentenced to life and then he got out on some kind of a legal point, I don\u2019t\nknow what, and I had to go to testify again, and then he got again arrested, and ended in\njail. He 1s not alive any more, I don\u2019t think so. He was a year or two older than I.",
        "A: The first thing what I want to mention 1s that when I was translating the letter to the\ndirector of the museum in Boskovice, that the word which I was missing, which actually\nis the deed, when the church was selling what it\u2019s called indagencies, to those who\nsinned, and were buying off their -- their sinning. That\u2019s number one, number two, when\nI was translating that same letter, I omitted, I believe one sentence, which I definitely\nwant to repeat, namely, when I say that Christianity 1s a noble religion, which will be\nhere for eternity. And now, if you allow me, I would like to start to read two letters from\nTheodora Toidya Cobaletska, that\u2019s her -- that\u2019s her married name, the daughter of the\nfarmer, which she wrote me on my inquiries in the 90\u2019s, what happened during my stay\nthere, which I could not know, because I couldn\u2019t get out, and after I left. All right then.\nHere is the first letter from Toidya, dating into September 19, 1993. \u201cDear Kurt, in\nreference to your letters of March 15 and August third, 1993, I am conveying to you\ninformation regarding my parents and my family. My mother Anna Pocharlie, nee Lipa,\nwas born April 15, n -- 1890, in Wallagarja Nitzca, near Pableshk Piaski lubareska, while\nmy father, Stanislav Pocharlie, son of Michael and Maryanna, was born on April 21, n --\n1890, in Sialishky, near Piaski lubareska. Together they will work as farmers on their\nfarm in Sialishky. Through their own daily work, they managed to acquire a larger farm,\nand until Hitler\u2019s German invasion of Poland, in September 1900 and 39, they were\nleading farmers in the village. After that, my father worked simultaneously in the Casa\nShef-Shef-Shefsheek Savings Bank in Piaski. The invaders ran a wasteful, exploi-\nexploitative regime and the for -- the for -- their forced deliveries of goods ruined the\nPolish countryside. The invaders ran a wasteful and exploit-ploitative regime and the\nforced deli-deliveries of goods ruined the Polish countryside. Not fulfilling the quotas\nwas cruelly punished by the German administration, with arrests, and with sending\npeople to concentration camps. The period of the German occupation was a brutal time, a\ntime of violence and terror. There was a lack of food, and the basic food articles were\ndistributed by means of ration cards. I remember that Mama used to prepare a syrup from\nsugar beets, and we sweetened our black coffee with it. There were times when there\nwasn\u2019t even flour for bread, which Mama baked herself. Our basic diet was milk and\npotatoes. Thanks to the resourcefulness of my father, there was never any real hunger. I\nremember the day when you came to us at night. My father warned Mother not to give\nyou any food that was too fatty or excessively rich during the first few days of your stay\nwith us. After the camp food, it might have caused serious health consequences for your\nstomach and your whole digestive system. At that time it was not easy to get medicines\nand curing you would have been made significantly more difficult under the conditions of\nyour concealment. I want to mention that my parents were afraid f -- of the neighbors,\nwho were numerous around our farmyard. A woman by the name of Fran-Franechka,\nwho was very nosy, was specially dangerous. She loved to look after -- around\neverywhere, in the outbuildings, and tell the whole village what was going on around\nthere. For that reason also, we had to maintain the greatest possible vigilance of all costs.\nAfter that, there was a young girl in our house, by the make of Kriska, who was with us\nas a helper in the housekeeping. Her mother asked my father whether she could work for\nhim so that she could be registered in our community. Wer -- This registration saved her\nfrom being carried off to forced labor with the Germans. I remember also a conversation\nof my father with his brother, who likewise lived in Sialishky, who told father that a\nneighbor had told him that there was someone hiding in our outbuildings, because one\nnight you could hear coughing. This information from his brother made my father very\nuneasy and he told you about this occurrence, indicating that he would have to change\nyour place of hiding. Father,\u201d -- pardon me, he didn\u2019t tell me about that, but he said that I\nshould not cough, but he didn\u2019t tell me why. I -- I had no -- I had no idea about the\nreason. \u201cFather and Mother were considering how to do this in order to create safe\nconditions for your further stay in hiding. With that goal in mind, both of them went to\nMama\u2019s brother, who was living in the village of Wallagardianitska, about six kilometers\nfrom Sialishky, in order to discuss with him the matter of transporting you to that locality\nand of concealing you at his farm, but that event turned out differently. It happened that\nmy mother\u2019s brother was being sought by the Germans and had to hide himself as well.\nIn that situation, Dad and Mama decided that you would remain further at the place in\nSialishky, whatever the consequences. In regard to Kriska, you -- who had seen you in\nthe barn, Dad explained to her, if I remember correctly, that you were one of the\npartisans, who was hiding there. It goes without saying that it was impossible to let her\nknow who you were, and in the interest of the safety of all of us. Apparently, she must\nhave believed Dad\u2019s explanation, because, as it turned out, the matter never came to\npublic attention. Further -- Fortunately, as you know, we endured those hard times and\nlived to see the liberation. For us, the day of liberation, which came in our area in the\nsecond half of July, 1944,\u201d -- it was rather at the very end of July -- \u201cwas a special day. It\nwas possible for you to leave your hiding place, and you were able to return to a normal\nlife. We were overcome with great joy. That which had seemed an impossible thing, had\nbecome a reality. Our faith and confidence, in the help of God, and also our prayers had\nbeen answered. After your departure from Sialishky, at the end of July, 1944, we\ncontinued to be uneasy about whether you had made it in s -- in safe and sound to your\nhome in Czechoslovakia. Your letter, sent from the ship Queen Elizabeth,\u201d-- but it should\nbe Queen Mary -- \u201csaying that you were alive and on your way to United States was an\nenormous comfort to us, and finally permitted our hearts to be at ease. We were able to\nthink about you -- your new life, with a feeling of relief, and to wish that it would be a\nhappy one. Our country was free from under Hitler\u2019s occupation and we thought that the\npeaceful life would now en-ensue. In the meantime, from the very beginning, there were\nstarting to be arrests, death sentences and deportations to prison camps deep in the Soviet\nUnion, from which many Poles never again returned to their country. They a -- They\narrested members of the National Army, and those who did not accept the new political\norder. A difficult period for the Polish society had begun. Many innocent people died\nduring the consolidation of the people\u2019s government. The truth about these times of\nviolence and repression has just recently begun to come to light, little by little. In\nSeptember \u00b044, my father was arrested on the charge of possession of weapons and of\nconcealing partisans. In our home, a rigorous inspection was carried out by functionaries\nof the Bureau of Security. Mama and I were terrified and beside ourselves at the thought\nof what would become to us in the future. At a certain time, Mama and I left our home\nand possessions. Our neighbors took care of the entire farm during our absence. Such a\nsituation could not continue, however, and our return to Sialishky was necessary, without\nregard to the consequences. That was a very difficult time for us. The Bureau of Security,\nafter many interrogations, was not able to prove the charges they had brought against my\nfather, that his possessions of arm, and concerning partisans. Father did not return home\nuntil December fi -- \u00b044. However, there was not any further peace. Difficult times began\nto wealthy farmers, so-called kulaks, by the people\u2019s government. My father was likewise\naccounted as one of these kulaks. Extremely high tax charges and mandatory deliveries of\nagricultural produ-produce, and livestock, were imposed by the office of the community,\naimed at liquidating the so-called kulak farms. If the farmers did not comply with the\ncommunity prohibitions, they were e -- threatened with serious penal consequences. With\nhard labor, my parents endured even this hostile rate of taxation, of the people\u2019s\ngovernment, or wealthy farmers. They worked on their farm until advanced old age. My\nparents did not want to leave Sialishky, here they had their family, neighbors, their home\nand their free life. On the other hand, being with us in Lublin, they were condemned, as it\nwere, to idleness, to a lack of -- to a lack of neighbors with whom they had lived together,\nor a -- great part of their lives, and to lack of all of that which surrounded them in the\nvillage. Simply put, they never 1m-imagined a life in town for themselves, and I am not\nsurprised, because the link with their environment, which accompanied them almost\nthroughout their lives, was so strong that it could not be broken. My father, right after\nMom\u2019s death, when we wanted to bring them to Lublin, put off his arrival for month, two\nmonths, and not until December, did he decide to come to our home in Lublin. While he\nwas with us, he was extremely homesick for Sialishky, and it might be that the\nhomesickness and idleness hastened his death. Mom died June 28\", \u201971, in Sialishky, and\nFather on April 1972, in Lublin. They are both buried in the cemetery in Piaski. I want to\nmention that I have been married since December 31, 1945, and from the start, I lived in\nPiaski, and worked there initially, in the cooperative agricultural market, afterwards in\nthe cooperative savings bank, and later, after bringing up the children, in the post office.\nThere was always frequent contact with my parents, especially during the times of\nintensified field labor. All my family [indecipherable] these jobs. Our children spent July\nand August vacations in Sialishky, and to the extent they could, helped their grandparents\nwith the harvest. Myself and my husband, who likewise are work in Piaski, took a leave\nof absence at the time, and spent it working on my parents farm. In 1966, we obtained an\napartment in Lublin, in Kalanovsheesna Street, and a new phase of our life began for us.\nMy son Andre finished at that time, the [indecipherable] technical school. My daughter\nAlsberta finished liberal arts gymnas-gymnasium, college preparatory high school, and\nthe younger daughter, Eva, went into the second class of basic school. I, after coming to\nLublin, have been working continuously at the post office in Piaski, which allowed me to\nbe continuous -- in continuous contact with my parents, to whose house I used to ride\nafter work on my bicycle, about three to six kilometers from Piaski to Sialishky. At that\ntime, my parents were already over 76 years old, and had less and less edj -- energy to\nwork. They sold part of their land because they were no longer in any condition to\nmanage it, and earlier -- and -- and earlier, a part of the land had been sold to pay taxes\nimposed yearly by the people\u2019s government of the community. They were on what\nremained of their farm right up to Mom\u2019s death. My father, after the final liquidation on\nthe farm, came to our house in Lublin in December \u201971. All my family hold them in fond\nmemory. They were people of high moral le-level, upon whom it was all -- always\npossible to depend. Their most particular character trait was kindness and fondness for\nthe family, and that was felt in every step in their contact with us. For that reason also,\nour children were always very eager to be with them, and received each announcement of\na trip to Sialishky with joy. For us and our children, my parents home was always an\noasis of peace and joy, where everyone always felt happy and secure. That resulted in\ntheir positive influence on our hearts and minds, and arose from their deep faith in the\nvalues of the Christian teaching, on which they were followers. Kindness, tolerance, and\nmutual respect. My parents and all of us were eager to see you after years, once again in\nSialishky, but that has turned out to be impossible. I think that this will come true to a\ncertain degree with your meeting with your son -- with our son Andre and his family al-\nalthough in America, where they have been living permanently since September 1988.\nMay he represent those who have already departed from this world, my dear parents and\nus all, living in this country. We have the hope that this meeting will take place. Lublin,\nDecember 19, 1993, Theadora Kobaleska.\u201d And now she\u2019s got a beautiful letter --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: No, no, I never went back. I was afraid of the Polish Communist government, I -- I\nnever went back. But we are continuously corresponding and I am helping them out.",
        "A: Yes, I s-saw Toidya a few times. She was a girl about 18 years old that time, and I\ndon\u2019t know whether I mentioned it in my story, at Easter, 1943, she came out of the\nhouse while I was watching the yard, with a little basket on her arm, and with her came a\nyoung man. He stood in front of the house, on the side in front of the house and she went\ntoward my hiding place. And when she got in, she reached me the little basket. And there\nwere Easter cookies, and colored vodka to drink. There -- There -- They regarded me as a\nmember of their family. It was really a beautiful relationship, and I told him he raised\nhimself a son, and I am treating her like a sister.",
        "A: Well, originally I wrote to her parents, but then when they passed away, and we\ncontinued some corresponding in Czech and Polish on either side, her husband Yanoush,\nstarted to study English, and from then on we started to correspond English on both ends,\nand you could have seen the improvement in his English as time went on. It was really\ninteresting. And he\u2019s a very find ma -- very fine man too. By the way, their oldest son\nAndre came a f -- quite a few years ago with his wife and two daughters to the -- to the\nUnited States. They\u2019ve -- They left Poland. And they live in San Diego, California. And I\ntried to send them some money and the first time they finally took it. And then he told me\nthey don\u2019t want any help, they want to do it on their own, and a very, very proud, fine,\nnoble people.",
        "A: Lam now continuing with the follow up letter after receiving the first one, I wrote her\nand this is the answer, dated Lublin, December the 17, 1993. \u201cDear Kurt. In reference to\nyour letter of November seventh and to the information which I sent you in a letter on\nSeptember 19, I would like to finish describing those events that I still remember from\nthat letter. I began working at S-Spudsyairna rawneecho handlovay in Piaski in\nSeptember, \u201941, and my work there prevented me from being taken to a forced labor\ncamp in Germany. In the fall, and especially during the winter, I frequently spent the\nnights in Piaski, and during the spring and summer, I often came home to -- by bike. I\nwas in Piaski the day you arrived at my parent\u2019s home, on October 18, 1943. The next\nday my mother came to me and told me about your arrival and that same day I came to\nSialishky and we were tell -- talking. I believe roo -- you remember that moment.\u201d I don\u2019t\nremember that she was talking to me, that Toidya was ta-talking to me. \u201cI stopped\nworking at the Sporgiana and came home to live with my parents with my father -- when\nmy father took me from Piaski. This happened when the Germans and Soviet armies were\napproaching our village. During this time, attacks from wa-war planes, were intensifying,\nwhich were bombing German regiments and fleeing Germans and has set Piaski aflame.\nAt that time, retreating German er -- regiments and civilians, referred as to the\nVolksdeutsch, had penetrated into the village, took horses and anything else they could,\nand fled west. I and several other people from the village, took our horses from the\nstables and we ran off in the meadows to prevent the Germans army from requisi --\nrequisitioning our horses. We spent the night in the fields, in the bushes, where we safely\nwaited until the morning. The German army horse corp, and along with them civilians,\narrived in our yard that same night. Many farmers ran off into their meadows, whereas\nmy parents and our neighbor, Adam Smoleara remained in the building. In the morning\nmy mother came and told us not to return home yet. We returned to the village only in the\nafternoon, once the Germans left. As we later discovered, rebels from the Polish\nunderground army ambushed them outside of Piaski. Most likely they were Germans and\nUkrainians. A portion of them who survived, returned to Sialishky and ordered us to\nleave our buildings because the Soviet army was going to occupy them. My parents\nquickly loaded the wagon with foods and clothes, and at that time, informed the military\npersonnel that the messengers from the village went to the commander in Piaski to verify\nwhether this order was reliable. They were surprised by this information and shortly\nafterwards, left the village. Our village is located between two main roads, which when\nleaving Piaski, one leads to Holm and the other one to Zamosc. The Polish and Soviet\narmies were advancing on the road to Holm from Piaski, where the German\u2019s army was\nretreating likewise it on the road from Piaski to Zamosc toward Lublin. Both sides were\nexchanging machine gun fire from both Jal and the highest point -- from both Jal and the\nhighest point in Sialishky. The villages, Drizishky, Drazitchae, Jelltov and Piaski, and the\nsurrounding area were aflame, but our village was preserved. During this shoot out, we\nwere sitting in a man -- manhole across from our residence, that was dug up by my father\nand our neighbor Alexander Pasternak. In your hi -- In our hiding pl -- In your hiding\nplace, there was another exit through the attic into Pasternak\u2019s shed, that led to the\nmeadow. My father explained to me that in case of any danger, you could have run away\nby opening the door of -- to the unlocked shed. After the German army retreated beyond\nLublin, I decided to turn to work in Piaski. That was at the end of July 44. The day you\nleft our house, I was at work. In my father\u2019s opinion, the main roads [indecipherable]\nPiaski Lublin was the safest and directed toward the road, because that was where the\nPolish and Soviet regiments were located. On the side road, Sialishky Pershki, there were\nmany deserters dressed as civilians, of whom my father was suspicious, so he decided to\nlead you to the road beyond the yard, that led to the main road.\u201d That is not so in my\nmemory, but it doesn\u2019t really matter. \u201cYou asked in your letter 1f anyone heard you\ncoughing. That was our neighbor, Adam Smalleara, who walked by your hiding place to\nhis farm buildings every day. He told his neighbor Constanti Pocharlie about the\ncoughing in your -- in our buildings. He was my father\u2019s brother and frequently came to\nour home. The next thing you asked is where my mother and I were when we left our\nhome in Sialishky after my father was arrested, and who took care of our farm. My father\nstayed with the si -- her sister, who lived in Volla Garjanitska village, and I stayed with\nmy cousin in Lublin. In our absence, my father\u2019s brother, Constanti Pocharlie and his\nwife Elixa, who resided in Sialishky, and lived near us, took care of our farm. They\ninformed us through acquaintances that it was possible to return to Sialishky. Was Kriska\nin Sialishky? She did not live there. She was from Walla Posi -- Biasetska village, a\nmunicipality of Piaski. Some information about my family. My husband Yanoush worked\nin Piaski, where [indecipherable] during the German occupation and several years after\nthe liberation in -- until 1949, and subsequently in Lublin, December 31\u201c, 1981. From\nJanuary first, \u00b082, after 40 years of working, the -- h-h-he retired. Our son Andre was\nborn January 10, \u201947 in Piaski and graduated from a technical school in Lub-Lublin, and\nas you know, lives in the United States. He has two daughters, Monica is 17 and Biara 1s\n16. Our daughter\u2019s Edjberta, her married surname being Warchieska, was born January\nfirst, \u00b048, in Piaski and received a degree in Lublin, and subsequently in Warsaw. She\nwas 21 all -- She has a 20 year old daughter, who il -- Ivana and lives in Warsha --\nWarsaw. Our daughter Eva have -- her married surname being Remish, was born\nDecember second, \u201958, in Piaski, and received her degree in Lublin and has a 12 year old\nson, Pavel and lives in Lublin. We move fi -- from Piaski to Lublin, with our entire\nfamily in \u201966, where we are still living today. If you would like any more information,\nplease write, and I will gladly send it.\u201d That\u2019s the end of the second letter.",
        "A: I -- [remember when I got married, in \u201954, I think not too long later, I got a request\nfrom them, the only time they asked for anything. They told me that the oldest son,\nAndre, who now lives in San Diego and the second born daughter, will have\nConfirmations. And they need for the girl, a little white dress. So my wife Tina had made\nup a dress with the -- with the repair seamstress in the store, and we send it to them. It\nhad a stiff crinoline, and they thought that the crinoline is being worn outside instead of\nsupporting the dress, and I got the picture, the confirmation picture with that crinoline on\nthe outside. I never told Toidya about this mistake, but it was really funny, and a\nbeautiful picture. I have the photograph someplace.",
        "A: I have also the photograph of Stanislav Pocharlie and his wife Anna, in the suit which\nI sold him, f -- and which he mentioned to me that I owe him -- that he owes me some\nmoney for it. I have that picture, too, and the suit is as crinkled as it was when I s -- when\nI smuggled it out of the ghetto into the village to him. But these were beautiful people,\nand they were so kind to each other. A beautiful married life and a beautiful family life,\nthe daughter, she was -- she was a queen, yet she was a wonderful daughter, you know,\nToidya. I have -- I have very warm memories, full of gratefulness.",
        "A: That\u2019s what I just wanted to let those know who will study the situation, that the\nPolish people, who were anti-Semitic, unfortunately, but that was again the fault of the\nchurch, later on suffered so much by their own Communist system, undeservedly. In\nother words, they were always between two big millstones. On the west was Germany,\nand on the east was Russia. And Poland was actually divided, I believe three times during\nthe history. The last time it was unified in 1918, when the southern and -- and western\npart belonged to Austria-Hungary. The northern part belonged to the Germans and the\neastern part was Russian. They -- They had very -- a li -- very few periods of their own\nnationhood, I think under the yagalons, which was a -- which was a -- they are kings, the\nyagalons, they were very, very well known, historically. But the Polish nation as such, I -\n- I can see a very smart people, lacking some education and also infrastructure.\nCommunications, roads, electricity, that was missing. But the people itself, are just as\ngood as any of the civilized nations, or more civilized nations. I w -- I wouldn\u2019t -- I\nwouldn\u2019t say that they are not civilized, but less me -- technically mes -- less developed.",
        "A: No, I really -- I -- I -- about the Russians?",
        "A: About the -- no, no, I -- I -- I think I said everything I felt and feel about them, bef -- if\nI should remember later, I might be sorry, but right now I do not know what to say.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: The trial, generally speaking, were organized in such a way, that one witness per\nweek. I did not see a witness who was before me, or the one who came after me, because\nthe court worked only on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, I believe, and Thursday the\n-- the court wa --\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",
        "A: -- ee -- during the trial against the accused, Karl Auguste Frenzel Rosen,\nUndersharfuhrer, or Sharfthrer of the SS. First in Hagen, where I was two or three times,\nand then in another time, I was either in Frankfurt or in Kur-Kurnamrine -- no, I was in\nFrankfurt, Frankfurt mine. Anyhow, at one time, he denied that I am the person who was\nin the camp, and the presiding judge, I believe his name was Schneider, stood up angrily\nand he says, \u201cMr. Thomas, how did they call you in camp?\u201d And I says, \u201cKurt.\u201d And then\nhe said to Frenzel, \u201cNow, don\u2019t you remember a Kurt in the camp?\u201d He says, \u201cYes, I\nremember a Kurt, but this 1s not the Kurt which was there.\u201d He deny -- He was lying\nthrough as much as he could, but ultimately he was sentenced to life, because there was\nno death penalty in Germany, which he later on, for some legal reason, renewed the -- the\ntrial, after being jailed for quite a few years, and the last trial confirmed again his guilt.",
        "A: Well, I felt a certain satisfaction, that he could see that some of us survived and that he\ncouldn\u2019t get away with what he -- what he actually was doing. He was really exploiting\nus very badly. I am -- Otherwise, I -- I do not remember now anything during the trial,\nbut I would say this, \u201cThere were actually three German families, which took care as\nmuch as they could om -- om -- of us witnesses. One always was resting, while the other\ntwo were active, and in my case, it was another judge, who was very kind to me, with\nwho I correspond once in awhile, and then there was the wife of the principal of a high\nschool, their name was Wagner. Very, very kind, nice people, who tried to make us feel a\nlittle bit at home while we -- while we during the trials in Germany.",
        "A: The first one was 1n 1966, and then I couldn\u2019t tell which following years when it was.\nBut the last one, I was a re -- I was real surprised, because it was quite a few years when\nthey started a retrial, after he claimed that he was sentenced innocently. And that was\nquite a few years later, it must have been in the 70\u2019s, already. And also Germany looked\nentirely different at that time, than during the first time of the trial. Even the hotels were\nso much better, and -- and the food and the -- it was an -- it was already a Germany\nrestored, almost completely, economically.",
        "A: Those Germans which I encountered, were very, very nice, very kind, decent people.\nAnd I believe that the German people are a -- are very -- very, ve-very good nation, like\nanybody else, but they were misled by a -- by a government, by getting promises, and\nalso because they suffered of the -- of the defeat during the first World War, which was\ninterpreted to them as a -- as a reason to avenge it. But nobody wa -- was telling them that\nthey actually started the war themselves, I mean it -- the war started in -- in -- after\nFerdinand Testi was killed in -- in Bosnia by Gavria Princip, a Bosnian nationalist, who\nkilled the successor to the throne of the Hapsburgs. And they gave the Serbians an\nultimatum which they couldn\u2019t accept, and that\u2019s why the -- how the war started. And\nwhen Austria declared war on os -- on Serbia, the Russians declared war on Austria, and\nthe French declared war on the Russians, and -- and Austria, and the English way north,\nand the first World War started.",
        "A: When I was in Germany? No, not personal. It was rather a historical feeling, but I had\nnothing against the German population any more. They -- They were defeated, they\nchanged their political system, and -- and they were admitting their guilt, and paid\nrestitutions, so what else can you -- can you ask? I think they were, in -- in the aftermath,\nthey were the most decent ones of all -- of all the nations who were involved in the war\nand took advantage of the superiority of the German army, o-of the -- of the -- the\nGerman government.",
        "A: No, I was -- certainly had no friendly feelings toward Frenzel. As a matter of fact, I\njust remembered, I was waiting one morning on a stone bench in the courthouse. I came\nearlier than necessary. And next to me sat another German citizen, he was -- at that time,\nat least, I would say 20 years older than I. And I told him -- he asked me what I am doing\nthere, and I told him that I am there, being summoned as a witness, and mentioned\nFrenzel, and then I mentioned another -- another SS man, whose name was Gomersky.\nAnd he told me that he knew the Gomersky\u2019s boys, pre-war, that they were very, very\npoor people, they had nothing, they didn\u2019t have even a bicycle. And when Hitler came\ninto power, or rather, before he came into power, the n -- the National Socialist Party\nsupported the family, for the promise that they will be voting National Socialist. That\u2019s\nwhat he told me. And Gomersky, I have seen, he was already sentenced, I think. He died\nin prison.",
        "A: Yeah, 1-1t wasn\u2019t the government, it was some kind of a court.",
        "A: But it was a -- it was a government institution, but not directly the government, and I -\n- | mentioned that Frenzel came from a city, as I said this before, which consists of two\nnouns, lerver, lion, and borg or berg.",
        "A: Well, I-I really -- I knew that the Germans are persecuting those Nazis. It never came\ninto my mind that they will not pick up the information which I gave them or -- or -- or\nsimply pigeonhole it someplace. But it never came into mind either, that they will take a\nmap and find the city and -- and -- and find then Frenzel in this theater, working as a\ncarpenter. It was just a lucky coincidence that Friedma -- Friedland -- no, Friedberg, told\nme where he -- where his hometown was. If I would have asked Friedberg at the time,\n\u201cGive me all the names and addresses of all the people,\u201d he would have given it to me,\nbut who thought of that we will come out one day and be able to use it?",
        "A: No. I didn\u2019t see any of the survivors, although I think that at one time, I was going\nback to the United States with Samuel Lehrer and his wife, Gail. No, no, no, they were\nstill there, and they asked me because I will be home in [indecipherable] sooner than I, to\ncall their children that they are alright. I think we -- we -- we saw each other there for --\nfor a short while, in Germany.",
        "A: Yeah, we had some gatherings. One time we were together in New York, when the\nmovie about the uprising of Sobibor was premiered, and we, the survivors, saw it first. At\nthat time, the United States witnesses came to see the movie, and even one fellow who\nwas in South America, Shlomish Misener, he -- he too came. The movie was financed --\nThe making of the movie was financed by the Chrysler corporation, and it is often shown\non PBS, the uprising in Sobibor.",
        "A: Yeah, \u201cEscape from Sobibor.\u201d",
        "A: At that time I had a dispute. I, on one side, against all the other former internees,\nbecause I didn\u2019t like what Hollywood made out of the story, by adding things which\nnever happened, and not telling about those things which were just as important, and\ndidn\u2019t show them in the movie. And they were angry with me that I was mentioning that.\nAnd I said that history -- as these documents should be a historical document, should\nreally tell the truth, and not be biased by some filmmaker, who made up a story.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, some of the literature, I will have to mention my former colleague Blatt. He\nissued a little booklet, and it is in such a low standard, and so uninformative, actually,\nthat it\u2019s ridiculous that somebody even printed it. There is another book which I read, by\nJules Scurvis. He\u2019s a -- a Holland citizen, from -- from Holland. And he spend one hour\nin Sobibor. When his transport arrived, they pulled out from the transport, 80\ntypographers, and he was one of them too, but he was not -- he was not taken. So he\nasked an SS man whether he could join them, and the SS man kicked him in his butt into\nthe group. Now there were 81. They were used during the war for typographical -- for --\nwhat do you call it, when you print books? Printing purposes, and also, I understand, for\nfalsifying British currency, counterfeit. It\u2019s interesting that of the 81, he was only one\nwho survived, and then wrote a book about Sobibor, and it was interesting. He put into it\n-- | have it here, all the names of the some 34,000 Dutch people who came from\nWesterbork to Sobibor by transport, by date, and alphabetically. And that book was\nreprinted many times, because people were interested, not only about knowing about\nSobibor, but about those who perished there. That book is there, I can see it from here.\nIt\u2019s in -- It\u2019s in -- in Dutch, in Hollandish, and I got later on a translation in German. It\nwas translated into German.",
        "A: No, Jules Scurvis could not tell me, I told Scurvis about the fate of my family, and he\nput it in the book.",
        "A: There is also my -- a picture of mine in that book.",
        "A: Yeah, it happened, because I used to go once in awhile when I was in New York, on\nbusiness, I used to go to wine land, where quite a few of the former survivors of Sobibor\nwere in the chicken business, and egg business, you know? So I met with them there.",
        "A: It was a friendly get together, you know. We -- We were happy that we are around and\nthat we outsmarted the Germans. I also forgot to say yesterday, after the war, when I\ncame to the United States and I married my wife, I worked for awhile in their store. Her\nbrother and his wife were together with a partner in a business where they manufactured\nslippers. Originally -- The original trade name was Angel Treads. And then they came out\nwith another line called Deerfoams. And when the -- Prior to that yet, I was working in\nanother branch of their business, called House of Foam, which was selling foam rubber.\nWe represented Firestone in Akron, and I was active there, traveling a little bit, and\nselling the stuff wherever I could. And we made pillows. And then when they came out\nwith the line of Deerfoams, the company\u2019s name is R.G. Barry Corporation, with\nheadquarters here in Columbus. I got a line of these Deerfoams and started to travel, to\nintroduce that line of slippers, washable slippers in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan,\nIndiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, I forgot now where else. Min-Minnesota, and\nintroduced these slippers and got them into big stores, and as the distribution rose, and I\ncould not handle that many states any more, I was giving up territory, and ultimately, I\nlanded with four or five cities in Ohio, like Columbus, Cleveland, Dayton, Youngstown.\nThat\u2019s about it. And then I retired in -- and that\u2019s how I make an -- a living, and a nice\nliving.",
        "A: Well, I devoted all my energies to my work, and -- and to my wife. These were the\ntwo main objectives, and I was successful building up this business, and the company\nwas very nice to me, too.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t have any children from my -- with my first wife, neither -- nor no-none\nwith my second wife, of course, we were too old already.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: She had circulatory problems and later on also developed Alzheimer\u2019s, and he passed\n-- she passed away in \u00b082.",
        "A: \u00b084.",
        "A: In \u201984, yes.",
        "A: Gloria, Gloria. She\u2019s American born also, just like my first wife was.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It is not only different, this is -- he personally, had with him -- Shlomish Misener,\nstaying for six weeks, when they were trying to put together a book. So, th-that is already\nin contradiction that we ne -- didn\u2019t get together, we did get together. I was together this\nlast winter with Esther Robb and her husband, which was not in the camp, and with\nSamuel Lehrer and his wife in Florida, and it was I who initiated that meeting. And we\nalready set for next year, that we will make it so that we could be longer together than a\nfew hours.",
        "A: I went, for instance, to Chaim Engel\u2019s son\u2019s Bar Mitzvah in Connecticut. And I try to\nbe in touch. But then, when I had that controversy, that dispute about the movie, with\nwhich I cannot come out publicly, because I didn\u2019t want to put wind into the sails of\nthose who denied the Holocaust. I felt originally, and I -- now I -- it watered down,\ndefinitely, that me -- that feeling, that the only thing I have in common with them 1s, the\nphysical living together in the camp, but that intellectually, we are far apart. That was my\nfeeling at the time, and I was very angry and frustrated, because they were at me like I\nwould been a traitor, when I mentioned that the movie is not really a hundred percent\ncorrect. In -- In the basis, 1t was correct that there was a camp and there was killing going\non, murdering, and that we s -- that we had organized an uprising and some of us\nsurvived. That is true, but certain details were not -- were not true.",
        "A: That\u2019s exactly, they disagreed with me, because he didn\u2019t want -- they didn\u2019t want me\nto even mention that there\u2019s anything wrong, which shouldn\u2019t have been there in the first\nplace, and that they omitted other things which they should have put in. And I think the --\nthe -- that -- that 1s my -- my -- that I put one and one together. The main reason why this\nhappened to us, Esther Robb went to Yugoslavia twice when the movie was made, as a\nconsultant. First she went as a -- as a volunteer, and then when they saw that she could\ngive some information, they made her a consultant. And she had in her power to do it\nright, because she has a good memory, she\u2019s a smart girl. And -- But she let them do\nwhatever they wanted to do, and -- and on that she -- in that sense, she 1s guilty in my\nown mind. But I forgave her already, because it doesn\u2019t make any difference.",
        "A: I don\u2019t believe that, what he said, because it was the trauma of the beatings, of the\nservitude which we have to manifest and -- and the horrible conditions, and to know that\nmany people got killed. What is the difference? I -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t believe that I\nsuffered more than somebody who survived Mauthausen and Dachau. I personally don\u2019t\nagree with that, and I don\u2019t know how he came to that conclusion, as if he would be a\nbetter, more elite caste of the survivors.",
        "A: Yeah, yes. I don\u2019t have any need now at all. But at that time, it -- I think that there was\n-- there was something mentally, because wherever I had an opportunity, I started to rattle\ndown my experiences.",
        "A: No. [had one little speech at the university here, and it was a fiasco, because first of\nall, there were only very few listeners. More than half of the listeners were friends of\nmine, instead of students from the university.",
        "A: Oh, maybe four or five years ago.",
        "A: Yeah, it was a --",
        "A: That was, I -- in the 90\u2019s, in the early 90\u2019s, after the Communist system s-stopped to\nexist. Later, a year later, I think, I went to Czechoslovakia and was in bo -- was in\nBoskovice for about three days, but I stayed in the hotel in Bernau, and we commuted by\ntaxi, because the -- the accommodations in Bernau were -- were easy and also I had\nfriends in Bernau, survivors.",
        "A: Really, it was nothing dramatic. The most dramatic thing was when I wanted to visit\nthe graves of my late grandparents, my father\u2019s mother and father, Josef and Rosaria\nTicho. They had two very nice tombstones, and before I went to America, I erected a\nplate -- a marble plate, which was affixed on the two tombstones, in which I remembered\nmy parents and my sister, that they perished on June the 234, 1942, in Sobibor. The\nstones were -- were -- f-f-fell down and -- no, at that time they were still there. No, at that\ntime they were already gone. It was -- The stones were f -- laying flat on the ground and\nthe tablet was torn off, and I could not -- I did not know that I need a key to get into the\ncemetery and I didn\u2019t even know wh-who the key -- who the -- would have the key. I\ncrawled over the fence, into the cemetery, and that was the most dramatic thing on -- on\nthe whole trip. As a matter of fact, we went first to -- where did we go first? First to\nHungary, and stayed in Budapest, and my friend Rudolf Hurlinger, with his wife Inga,\nwho live in California -- she unfortunately died a few months ago -- went on a trip with a\ngroup. And as it happened, they also went to Hungary, to Budapest, and also to Vienna,\nand also to Czechoslovakia. And we, my wife and myself, we were on our own. So we\nhappened to meet in Budapest, in the hotel, and when I was leaving with Gloria, the --\ntheir room, I took the elevator, and in the elevator I see a man, and I look at him, and I\nsays, \u201cSir, aren\u2019t you a senator of the United States?\u201d And he shook my hand, and he\nsays, \u201cI am Sam Nunn, and this is my son.\u201d He introduced me in the elevator, and that\nwas the day when Yeltsin stopped that tank in Moscow, during the revolution there. And\nI says to him, \u201cYou know, Senator, we were lucky in -- in Russia.\u201d He says, \u201cI just came\nfrom there, and we were really lucky.\u201d And in the meantime the elevator stopped on the\nfirst floor, and there were people waiting for him already, downstairs. That was in\nBudapest, and then we met again in -- in Vienna, and then we met again in Bernau.",
        "A: No, w-we --",
        "A: -- my friend, Rudy and Inga. And we wanted to go to -- to see the Spielberg, which is\nthe same name as the producer of the movies, Spielberg, the same spelling, which was\noriginally a torture camma built in the mid ages. And they tortured their people for\nreligious and political reasons, but it wasn\u2019t accessible, so we decided instead, and took a\ncab and went to the Matzocra, which are limestone caverns, built by -- partly by the water\nseeping through from the outside, and there\u2019s also a river on which you go on the little\nboat called Punqua, which was very interesting, that we spent together there with Rudy\nand Inga. Where else did we -- Oh, yeah, then in Vienna, I knew my best friend\u2019s brother\nBeginning Tape Five, Side A",
        "A: -- which was a younger brother of my -- of his brother, who was a very close friend of\nmine, and we arranged a meeting and we met at the opera house. Inga, Rudy, myself,\nGloria and Emmanuel Ohare came too, and we had dinner together and -- and then we\nwent to see the opera. I forgot now what we saw. And then in Prague, we met again with\nRudy and Inga. And we stayed downtown in a hotel, and they stayed on the outskirts in a\nhotel, with -- with was originally built during the Communist system for Communist\u2019s\nfunctionaries only. It was a luxurious place, I went there, with every amenity you can\nimagine, with terraces in front of the rooms. And they stayed there for two or three nights\nand we stayed, as I said in the -- in downtown. And there I met one of my school chums,\nfrom high school, Rudolf Bubla, who helped us in Prague. He was a very nice fellow,\nwho became a professional officer of the Czechoslovak army, and then I found out later\non, when I met him after the war, in Prague, how terrible all these officer were treated.\nHe worked in a coal mine for years, because he was a officer of the Czech army during\nthe occupation of the Germans.",
        "A: During the war, yes, yes.",
        "A: No, he was not Jewish. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t --",
        "A: Cramp -- Cramp in my foot. Yeah.",
        "A: I never made it, and maybe I should have gone, but what would I have seen there? I\nhave ha -- I have pictures. There is nothing there but a elevated mass of -- of soil, and a\nmonument in memory of those who got killed there. And I c -- I couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t do\nanything for them anyways, so I -- no -- so I -- I never went. There was a big -- There\nwas a big gathering, and I think that Mr. Blatt was there, too. I was the only one missing,\nat the 50\" years anniversary of the uprising, I believe. That would have been \u201943 -- in \u201993,\nthere was. And I have, someplace, even pictures. You can remind Mr. Blatt that he was\nthere too.",
        "A: I tell you, we considered -- we were talking about adopting and I could not, at the time\nat least, accommodate my mind, that I could love a child which is not of my blood. So we\ndropped the idea.",
        "A: No, I want to thank you for being patient, and coming here, and I hope that we\nfulfilled our historical duty, to put on the tape, whatever I could remember.",
