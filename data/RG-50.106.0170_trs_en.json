        "A: -- there is no -- no feeling of -- no, it was more the feeling of the stupidity of the\nentire situation, you know, because of the -- as I tried to mention, if I had anything to\nsay, we were -- we were -- we would have left Belgium even before the invasion, you\nknow, like many did. And it is an accident of, and a tragedy of the Jewish people in\nhistory that one -- two brothers came to Belgium, the other went to -- to -- to -- to\nU.S., and -- and the other ones were -- went to Israel. Then it\u2019s more of that kind of\nthings, because in this political action, there was never any sign of anti-Semitism, any\nsign of you are Jewish, or not. This never, never, never happen.

No, 1-it is a bit like here, when they decide no draft any more, volunteer. And\ncertainly when later on [indecipherable] the campaign against sending Belgium to --\nin the Congo, was the same thing. I say, you can send anything you want, except the\ndraftees, you see. And of course, now there is no more draft, then this was a -- a good\nidea to advance at tha -- on that time. And the army was a lot of fun again\n[indecipherable] because it was a comedy, you know. When I finished th-the\ninstructions, you know.

No,\nit\u2019s a -- no, it\u2019s the -- you know, in the -- when I was retired, came this thing with the\nBelgium, you know, amnesty here and say you can get the [indecipherable] you can\nthink this because then union from the job. And -- and then came this bulletin from the\nDiaspora, you know, you see. This is a bulletin which is written by a group of\nprogressive Jews in -- in Belgium, were -- who are trying to -- to have the Belgium\nstate recognized, their capability during the war, which has not done, contrary let\u2019s say\nto -- to France. And who introduced through politicians, some legislation on that, but\nuntil now, even under social democrat government they don\u2019t move. They have\nceremonies, etcetera in Malines, or in other places where there is Jewish past history,\nbut they don\u2019t recognize the culpability of the state, saying that most of the arrest,\n108May 7, 2007\netcetera were done by Belgium policemen and gendarmes. You know, they -- the\nGerman were not to be seen too much, but for the Jewish case was this guy named\n[indecipherable] and many collaborators, you know? The German was using them\nuntil a certain point, you know, when, in \u201943 they were losing the war, and then they --\nthey had to -- to compli -- dominate every sector of the population and against the\nresistance, which was so and so, so and so because after the war, practically everybody\nwas a resister. And -- and things like that. Then -- then that was the -- the case, and it\u2019s\nonly now that they came with this, they ca -- like they came to me with these veteran\nquestion. I never ask anything, you know, they say you -- you are Korean veteran, you\nare a-allowed to get this 500 euro, 700 dollar for this, and [indecipherable] for that.\nAnd then they came with the restituti -- [indecipherable] then this group, who was\n[indecipherable] try also to fight anti-Semitism in Belgium, which you know 1s rising\nlike many place in Europe. Not through violent acts, but through, you know, speeches\nby the extremist right and things like that. And also they are attacking the -- the -- the\nBelgium government to av -- agree that all the funds from the restitution be divided\nbetween the survivors or the son of the survivors, and -- and given to the creation of a\nJewish foundation of things like that. And I became interest because I -- I think,\nlearning what happened here with the claims, with Eisennstadt and with\nEggenberger, th-that it\u2019s not acceptable. That the priorities should not be there\nhundred and hundred of thousand of salaries that they get. Ah, but we were -- we -- the\n109May 7, 2007\n-- th-the survivor, and I s -- I ready to say I don\u2019t need it, but there are some people\nwho need it, okay? And -- and -- and then this 1s quite important. Then bu -- they also -\n- other news about this Belgian archive. Then I wrote to the guy, he was a -- he was\nJewish, [indecipherable] and -- who send me all those photo and reports and things\nlike that, which I think is -- 1s quite important because there were so many, and answer\nindirectly your question, I was not brief on when they came, what was their history.\nYou know, anyone 1s that, and what\u2019s -- what happened exactly with my brother, my\nfather-in-law, with my mother\u2019s resistance to all that, I -- wha -- wha -- what 1s the\ntruth was not the truth, you know, in this thing. Then it was very important. And this\nled me to -- to ask about this interview. You see, this is the chronology of the thing.\nAnd Arnheim said yes, it\u2019s very important that there 1s a second step, that all\ndocumentation is in fact, used, 1n a way that you have nothing extraordinary to tell, a-\nand I -- I know that. It\u2019s just one experience, okay, and it\u2019s not the same experience\nthat the -- th-the -- my father was really hidden in the house, couldn't go out , okay?\nThere were some children also in the same situation. And children were denounced by\npeople and send into camp. O-Or my friends sent in a convent or a monastery. Then\nthe situation is very, very, very different.

Then the older man began to -- to scream at me in Arabic,\nand I said, but I don\u2019t speak Arabic.

        "A: Ah, yes, and you know, it\u2019s the general knowledge of the danger of\nauthoritarianism and dictatorship and the rise of it and the fact that in Europe, twice\nthe United States had to come to rescue them, that they did it. It\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a --\n1-1t\u2019s a -- a continent who has been so much involved in internal struggles, going back\nto Napoleon and etcetera, and the same mistake to try to 1 -- to rule in the su -- these\nlarge territories of the Soviet Unions.

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: By that.",
        "A: Yeah, yes and no, it\u2019s more on the political level again, because I was in charge of a\nprogram called -- the first program called Islam against the Islamists, to make the\ndifference between the two, you see, and -- and -- and again, there\u2019s nothing religious,\nit is a group of power monsters, who will do anything to access to the control of a\nstate, uh-huh, and the -- in the Koran, everybody knows that 1-1-it\u2019s -- it\u2019s like the\nCatholicism, a-and -- and the other form, built on the -- o-on an evolution, which --\nwhich show only that with the raise of Islam, we see that they are as primitive like the\nCatholics were hundreds of years ago, of the Jewish, etcetera. Then this is more on that\nkind of level, and the fact that this has to be -- has to be stopped because there are new\nfactors, okay, meaning -- especially in western Europe, with the immigration from our\ncountry. We have the problem here, we have another, the Latin American immigration,\netcetera, who 1s different, of course, from the Jewish immigration, or the Belg -- the\nBelgium.

        "Q: Was that painful for you to renounce it?",
        "A: Ma -- no. That was not -- not all. Because I made such a difference between a\nheritage and a situation. And -- and -- and I never asked to go in the Belgian army to\ndefend so-called the king, okay? The king, for me, was a -- a collaborator, the first\none, during the war, of course, huh? Meaning that I put this all in -- in perspective.\nAnd I didn\u2019t come, mind you, American before, I was here seven years. You have to\nwait five years, a -- two more years, and as w-we talk about the legendary Irving\nBrown, he say, you know, one thing done, forget your heritage, okay? And -- and I --\nhe was more French than American anyway, live in Europe all his life. I recognize\nfrom one of the best [indecipherable] in France, etcetera, then it doesn\u2019t mean an --\nreally, when you have this international outlook. This is when somebody say, oh you --\nyour daughter work in Germany. I say, ah, I know -- w-w -- there\u2019s no meaning. She\ncould have work in Italy or something else. What is important with -- with all that, a-\n116\nMay 7, 2007\nand th-the race of Islamic, you know, 1-infiltration in ji -- 1-1-in the labor movement, in\npolitical life and in the society, 1-1s ta -- to remember that Europe is still divided\nbetween many [indecipherable] and the case of Bosnia, Serogovia, the fall of\nYugoslavia. I say everybody can be tomorrow a murderer if you -- 1f you don\u2019t pay\natten -- e-everybody can be manipulated in their thinking, in one way or the other, very\neasily. Where people can be convinced, you know, that Clinton was a great president,\nor you know, it may be, maybe not, but anyway, he\u2019s not one of the greatest in this\ncountry anyway. A-And -- and the same can be said from -- from the president, who is\nnow here. It 1s a -- a -- a -- a State of the development of country, of nation, and of the\npolitical life. What we can control, and what we cannot control. What a free society\nmeans. And now came all those great [indecipherable] thinker even today, in\n[indecipherable] etcetera. He said, election is not a proof of democracy. But we knew\nthis many, many years, that you know, the fact impose, practically, an election, doesn\u2019t\nmean anything in many countries of the world. Either it\u2019s still tribal and you talk about\nfeeling of nationality there -- th-th-th-th-their responsibility is vis-a-vis their tribe. It\u2019s\nnot the [indecipherable] their country.

        "Q: Why not?",
        "A: I think, you know -- I remember in Berlin, sitting in -- in -- in a restaurant, you\nknow. There were some very old couple. I think th-th-they look at me, you know, and\nthey may -- and I\u2019m -- and they must have been, you know, concentration camp\nguards, who else, you know, and thing li -- you don\u2019t know.

And the fact that we didn\u2019t do that was a great mistake, because we didn\u2019t do\nit in Germany, but -- or in Japan, certainly not. Then -- no, I feel co -- uncomfortable\nthere.

We had the gymnasium, and the ping pong, etcetera. But they --\nthere were some lecture, you know, on -- on Jewish life, etcetera. There were artistic\ngroup, etcetera. And we knew that we choose Maccabee, not to be in the Zionist\ngroup, or not to be in the traditional Orthodox Jews, which didn\u2019t exist anyway in\nBrussels, they were all in Antwerp, you see.

        "Q: Do you feel a special connection to --",

And of course we will -- defended -- there\u2019s no --\nno -- when I visit the afri -- the -- the Arab countries, my boss, Irving Brown at that\ntime, when we were in Tunis [indecipherable] the Palestinian came a-and want to\ntalk to Irving.

Can talk about anything you want. At that time they didn't even\nwant -- they were not talking about a Palestinian states or nothing. They want just to\nbe anti-Israeli and a colonial state, or an imperial state. I had many contact, but again,\nthrough the years he became very dangerous, you know, in terms that we were close\nfrom the -- the exile group, even from inside and outside the Tunisian of the\n[indecipherable] Algeria. And people were -- my friend were assassinated. It is\nanother story, I can tell you where we had, for instance, the liberation movement\nagainst the French in Algeria. I visited the border [indecipherable] kind from\nTunisia, Morocco, all that. But the people we are dealing with were eliminated by\n120\nMay 7, 2007\ntheir own people after they took independence, you know, their friends had been torn\nout from this -- from stairways and things, oh, terrible. Some were assassinated in\nParis, which I knew and I was very con -- of course, concern about it. But again, when\nyou talk to a -- a guy like Irving Brown, he accepted that [indecipherable] and never\ntalk about that. His best friend die [indecipherable] never talk about that. And we\nwere involved in all kind of operation, etcetera, and -- and as a joke with my wife and\nchildren, when I was awarded, you know, commander honor of this award, national\naward, you know, th -- of this officer, of that, and the other, and chevalier -- knights of\nthat.

But there was a\nGerman officer, I have to find out -- he had the yellow uniform, maybe from a tank is\nstill something, and people were obliged to feed him, you know, when he co -- he\ncame in the house, I could not [indecipherable], then I went in the dining room, and I\ndon\u2019t know what his reaction was, did he know, or did he say the hell with it, you\nknow, ah, we -- we don\u2019t do that any more, or didn\u2019t want to do it, he was not an SS, I\nhave no idea. And they departed. Okay? Then, I remember very well the incident with\nthe German tanks, three or four, passing in the -- you know, we can see the -- in the\nvillage. I remember also that the -- the ally bomb some of the roads. And as you know,\nthe German escape with everything they wi -- they had, and with horses and things like\nthat. And I remember the people in the family went to pick up some horse meat, you\nMay 7, 2007\nknow, from the horses who were, you know, dying of that and whatever. And at one\nmoment, must be in the beginning of September or end of August, we saw three\nAmerican Jeep, you know, passing by. They say hello, but they went. And then on --\nafter the liberation of Brussels, some of the -- the workers of my father, who were still\nin -- 1-1n touch with him, because as you know, what happened with this factory and\nmany Jewish similar factory, in order for the German not to -- to take over -- you\nknow, my father sold the -- the business to -- to them, you know, okay?

We were to [indecipherable] and\nthe people who were in a camp in Switzerland came back, and they went -- the ones\nwho were in the ca -- escaped to Switzerland. They were -- they were in Kerbene,\nFrance for all the [indecipherable] came back. We had a lot of memories, and I\nremember the discussion then was the situation in Israel, and you know, the -- the --\nthe independence [indecipherable] Israel and this I remember all that. Some were\nMay 7, 2007\nmember of the [indecipherable] who wanted the greater Israel, and the\n[indecipherable] and so on and so forth. I remember that we were, of course,\nconcerned [indecipherable] the Egyptians were 15 miles from Tel Aviv. Of course,\nthere it doesn\u2019t count, everything is so close.

And he\nbecame a famous radiolog, one of the top, you know, doctors in radiology, okay?\nWrite a thousand of book. If you look on the web, you will see his books all over, all\nover the place.

Because m-my uncle was\nin the UN observer, never observe anything. We were always in the beach in Tel Aviv,\nyou know? And when the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- some other people in the UN says,\nyou know, you have to go and observe the Jewish are doing things like that, they went\nin another direction. You know, when the -- when the -- th-the [indecipherable] you\nhave to say what they did. Nothing. And you know, we landed in -- not in Tel Aviv,\nthere was no airport, but in Haifa, you know, in the little place of that, and it was fun,\nexcept that I took the events seriously, beginning to -- to understand and there -- what\nwas going on.

        "A: I came back to Brussels and --",
        "A: Went to high school, and explained the kind of high school, it was a\n[indecipherable] then the -- the socialist party who -- in Belgium high school, you\nknow, where they train people at that time for the different movement in the sort of --\nthe co-ops movement, cooperative movement. Of course, does not exist any more, it\u2019s\n-- that thing -- for the health service, because until today the health service is run by\npolitical party in Belgium, and [indecipherable] then you are to go in a socialist\nhealth plan or Catholic health plan. And there a story with that too. My wife was a\nvery conservative [indecipherable] and didn\u2019t want -- not practi -- religious for\n[indecipherable] but still today says something against the -- the socialist movement.\nAnyway, the fa -- my son Eric was born in the socialist hospital. And then she say, n-\nMay 7, 2007\nnever again, [indecipherable]. Then [indecipherable] my daughter, Sarah, she went\nto the red -- Red Cross hospital.

With, a-at that time a boarding\nschool, but I didn\u2019t go to -- because it was in Brussels, | didn\u2019t go to the boarding\nschool, and this was an institution delivering a diploma in social work, okay? Again,\nsee, in Belgium you are th -- e-even in 1907, a public school, and a Catholic school\nMay 7, 2007\nsystem, okay? And the third one 1s the state\u2019s system, okay? And for instance, my wife\nwent to the state social training school, okay? And at that time, th-th-th-th-the -- the\nsocial worker\u2019s profession was not -- was not recognized as a -- as a university, you\nknow, school. It\u2019s only later, now, that it -- 1t deliver Master, before 1t was only\nBachelor.

They say, you don\u2019t need it, go immediately into you know,\nthe -- the socialist movement, okay? And we will take you as the leader of the socialist\nyouth. When we say socialist, I have to explain this again to some of our American\nfriend. socialist, in the United State has a communist meaning. Of course, this was not\nthe case, this is social democrats. Like, for the election of the last few days in France,\nwhen they call a socialist, he 1s not more socialist than I am, but it -- it -- it is to be\nunderstood on the basis -- then I-I -- I went to work for them, but before that, when I\nwas 19 years old --",

And it is an accident of, and a tragedy of the Jewish people in\nhistory that one -- two brothers came to Belgium, the other went to -- to -- to -- to\nU.S., and -- and the other ones were -- went to Israel. Then it\u2019s more of that kind of\nthings, because in this political action, there was never any sign of anti-Semitism, any\nsign of you are Jewish, or not. This never, never, never happen.

No, 1-it is a bit like here, when they decide no draft any more, volunteer. And\ncertainly when later on [indecipherable] the campaign against sending Belgium to --\nin the Congo, was the same thing. I say, you can send anything you want, except the\ndraftees, you see. And of course, now there is no more draft, then this was a -- a good\nidea to advance at tha -- on that time. And the army was a lot of fun again\n[indecipherable] because it was a comedy, you know. When I finished th-the\ninstructions, you know.

No,\nit\u2019s a -- no, it\u2019s the -- you know, in the -- when I was retired, came this thing with the\nBelgium, you know, amnesty here and say you can get the [indecipherable] you can\nthink this because then union from the job. And -- and then came this bulletin from the\nDiaspora, you know, you see. This is a bulletin which is written by a group of\nprogressive Jews in -- in Belgium, were -- who are trying to -- to have the Belgium\nstate recognized, their capability during the war, which has not done, contrary let\u2019s say\nto -- to France. And who introduced through politicians, some legislation on that, but\nuntil now, even under social democrat government they don\u2019t move. They have\nceremonies, etcetera in Malines, or in other places where there is Jewish past history,\nbut they don\u2019t recognize the culpability of the state, saying that most of the arrest,\n108May 7, 2007\netcetera were done by Belgium policemen and gendarmes. You know, they -- the\nGerman were not to be seen too much, but for the Jewish case was this guy named\n[indecipherable] and many collaborators, you know? The German was using them\nuntil a certain point, you know, when, in \u201943 they were losing the war, and then they --\nthey had to -- to compli -- dominate every sector of the population and against the\nresistance, which was so and so, so and so because after the war, practically everybody\nwas a resister. And -- and things like that. Then -- then that was the -- the case, and it\u2019s\nonly now that they came with this, they ca -- like they came to me with these veteran\nquestion. I never ask anything, you know, they say you -- you are Korean veteran, you\nare a-allowed to get this 500 euro, 700 dollar for this, and [indecipherable] for that.\nAnd then they came with the restituti -- [indecipherable] then this group, who was\n[indecipherable] try also to fight anti-Semitism in Belgium, which you know 1s rising\nlike many place in Europe. Not through violent acts, but through, you know, speeches\nby the extremist right and things like that. And also they are attacking the -- the -- the\nBelgium government to av -- agree that all the funds from the restitution be divided\nbetween the survivors or the son of the survivors, and -- and given to the creation of a\nJewish foundation of things like that. And I became interest because I -- I think,\nlearning what happened here with the claims, with Eisennstadt and with\nEggenberger, th-that it\u2019s not acceptable. That the priorities should not be there\nhundred and hundred of thousand of salaries that they get. Ah, but we were -- we -- the\n109May 7, 2007\n-- th-the survivor, and I s -- I ready to say I don\u2019t need it, but there are some people\nwho need it, okay? And -- and -- and then this 1s quite important. Then bu -- they also -\n- other news about this Belgian archive. Then I wrote to the guy, he was a -- he was\nJewish, [indecipherable] and -- who send me all those photo and reports and things\nlike that, which I think is -- 1s quite important because there were so many, and answer\nindirectly your question, I was not brief on when they came, what was their history.\nYou know, anyone 1s that, and what\u2019s -- what happened exactly with my brother, my\nfather-in-law, with my mother\u2019s resistance to all that, I -- wha -- wha -- what 1s the\ntruth was not the truth, you know, in this thing. Then it was very important. And this\nled me to -- to ask about this interview. You see, this is the chronology of the thing.\nAnd Arnheim said yes, it\u2019s very important that there 1s a second step, that all\ndocumentation is in fact, used, 1n a way that you have nothing extraordinary to tell, a-\nand I -- I know that. It\u2019s just one experience, okay, and it\u2019s not the same experience\nthat the -- th-the -- my father was really hidden in the house, couldn't go out , okay?\nThere were some children also in the same situation.

And the na -- the big, you know, diploma, I wanted to put this in my little\n[indecipherable] no, no. It\u2019s only -- it\u2019s a true story, of course, like everything I told\nyou, of course. I brought it from the basement and I put it back, two of them. One is\ntoo big in the -- in my guestroom, and the other one is too big, I -- I left in that. And\nthen people are asking me, but why did you get? I say, look, this is to organize a ch --\nregime change, the other was to oppose one. And -- and things like that.
