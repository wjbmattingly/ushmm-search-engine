        "Question: Can you tell us your name and where you were born and when?",
        "Answer: Yes. I was born in 1920, the 30th of April in Poland. Then we lived\nthere for a while.\nQ. What was your name at birth?\nA. Ava Mueller. And I remember that one of the German Gestapo people when I came to\nconcentration camp asked me, you could not be Jewish because my name is Mueller, and I said\nmaybe I'm not, but it didn't help me too much. It shows you -- and even Jewish language is so\nvery similar to the German, so many names, so many words are the same.\nQ. What is your name now?\nA. My name now is Ava Dorfman. That is my husband of 39 years, and I lost him in 1988,\non July 3rd, suddenly, very suddenly.\nQ. You were born in ?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Did you stay there for very long?\nA. I suppose we stayed until a certain age. I think I went to public school, already to\nParochial at that time. There was a church with a parochial school near our house. I attended\nthere. Then my mother --.\nQ. Excuse me. Was that unusual for a Jewish person to attend that school?\nA. There were only two or three Jewish people in the area where I lived, so, we were really\nvery removed from the Jewish section of . Then, my mother had family in Vienna,\nso a portion of my life I spend there, and I lived on Liechtenstein Strauss in Vienna. Then, my\nfather's family lived in , and my mother felt that I and my sister Ruzia who was 2 1/2\nyears older than I, that we should somehow be closer to the family, to know our grandparents.\nShe did not have too much family in Poland or in Vienna of her close, and then we moved back\nto , where my grandparents own a building, four story, and my grandfather\nhad a restaurant, and they lived in the lower level, and then on the second floor, my mother,\nRuzia and I, you see when I was six months old I lost my father, so I actually never knew him.\nThere was just a study where there was a drawing, and that drawing was my father. There were\npictures that my mother always showed. He was 27 years of age and developed a severe case of\nkidney problems. He just got his degree in civil engineering. My mother was only 25, and they\nlooked forward but he didn't survive. So, between the draw and the cemetery that my\ngrandmother took us always, that was what I know of father. I didn't envy anyone that they may\nhave had more material things, but I envy everyone who was able to sit on the father's lap or get\na kiss from a father. That somehow I missed always.\nQ. What do you remember about your mother?\nA. My mother was very pretty, very educated. She spoke five languages. We were just --\nwhen we grow up we were like sisters, but when she was sometimes saying, I'm only 28 years of\nage, I said \"Well, you're so old.\" But we all do that, and she worked in the brewery, which was\nvery big offices, as an interpreter and also as a executive secretary to a director named Rightman.\nHe was Jewish, and then I understand from another friend, who is a gynecologist that the other\ndirector's son, Shal, was his name, is someplace in the United States, and then I was befriended,\nmaybe she was my best friend was Shisko. They were Czechoslovakian decent, and she and I\nwent together in school, and as I will tell you later on, she played a major role in my life. And\nmy mother worked there, and so it was a necessary that we were with the grandparents together\nand then above us was another aunt. She had four children. Marguerita was so pretty. They all\nperished. Then there was another aunt who was childless, and then she was\njust like a mother. She was battling a cancer in her larynx and that was the time really that she\nwanted to see that we would be married so she could see the weddings. I think that's what\nprompted one time whatever I will tell you about. What I would like to say that it is so hard\nsometimes to comprehend when people speak of six million, and also the fact that one million\nand a half were innocent children, does not say that we all were not just innocent, justly paid just\nbecause we were Jewish. The fact that everyone of the six million was a person with loved ones,\nwith friends, with dreams for the future, and then they had to face death by whatever means\nthose murderers had for them. They had a great many of them. Then, since you spoke with me\nand I really tried to search my mind. I must have really, like excavating the back memories from\nmy brain, and reach so many gruesome stories, that I tried very hard to suppress. I know that lots\nof Holocaust survivors share those gruesome stories with their children. I don't know what effect\nthat had on them, but before I got married in the United States, I decided if I ever have a family, I\nwould like to establish as a nearly normal life as it can be. I didn't want my children to be sorry\nfor their mother. I didn't want them to have the feeling that they are different from the other\nchildren, so I really was very evasive about it. The only thing at night, I had very bad dreams, as\nmy husband was telling me. I sometimes screamed or just said don't let them take me. So I\nshared lots of things with my husband, and not until the children were in high school and there\nwere many documentaries shown on T.V. and the newspapers and they always asked, \"Mom do\nyou know anything about it? Have you been there?\" And then little by little I would just tell\nthem, not very much. I have been asked by so many organizations to speak about my past. I\nrefused it. The only time I spoke was the Lutheran Church, and that was only because that the\nminister there felt that everybody who is not Lutheran is going to go to hell and of course, I just\nthought I'd tell them what hell really was. That's the only place I spoke. But, I feel right now\nthat even my children encourage me that I should give testimony. Just like my son called me\nyesterday and he said, \"Good luck Mom. I think you owe to the younger generation, because it\nshould never be forgotten what happened.\" I personally being so attuned to the anti-semitism\nwhich is going right now on, not only in Germany, France or England, but in the United States.\nI'm scared for the future generation because just like I hope that the Holocaust in Washington\nMuseum or any other Museums or Memorials which were erected in memory of the six million\nwill be able to educate the people what hatred and bigotry can do, and what they have done even\nto homosexuals and lesbians. They tortured them, and it was just because they had other sex\npreferences. We should let the people live for what they are, and therefore I feel that I consented\nto it. But I have to tell you that the last two weeks, I weighed all together 99 pounds, and I'm\npretty sure I'm down to maybe 80. I can hardly eat or sleep. It's hard for me to sleep. There\ncomes something that one son knows about and the other son still doesn't. When I was in Vienna\nI met many people, but one in particular was a medical student. He was like five and half or six\nyears older than I. He visited us when we went back to Poland. Then, as I mentioned, my aunt\nwho was childless, she was very eager to have a wedding, especially at that time, the rumors\nwhat was going on in Germany, because I think had in 1932 that Hitler started the revolution\nalready in Germany, and at one point I heard my family speaking, oh he's just a maniac. They\ndon't let him succeed. They will stop him. But how wrong they were. So, at one point, my aunt\nentertained that maybe we will get married. His family was not very well to do and neither was\nmine. He found a position in . was near\nwhich was a port, and in September of '39 the German invaded or bombed . This\nis the time that my marriage was of seven months only. That's why I do not have any\nrecollection. We hardly knew each other as a married couple.\nQ. How long did you know him before getting married?\nA. I think around four years.\nQ. What was his name?\nA. Edmond Spritzer (ph). When the German started to bomb , and they\nfinally marched in from , they start to round up the Jewish young men, able bodied,\nand that would happen with Mungio, and since then, I never saw him. I never had a trace of it\nneither. I have met any of his family members of his family. My cousin, who lives now in\nEngland, her son is by the way a member of the Parliament from Wales. They did not stay with\nJudaism, and he was born as a Episcopalian, but I don't blame them. There were many times that\nI didn't know what to do. If I were to have a family, I would not want them to be exposed to\nwhat I went through. She and her mother were visiting , and my mother by the\nway was visiting me, and the panic was so great because it was on the Baltic, . It\nwas a resort also. Everybody tried to get inland, and also reach their homes. What vividly\nstayed in my mind after searching my memory that I pushed my mother in through a window\nbecause the train was so jammed that she can go and also in some way was able\nto place her mother and then she and I stayed a while there. We didn't have any possessions\nthere, but when it start to be very bad, she was married around three years to\nDoctor and they were located where he practiced, and she and I decided that\nmaybe we ought to go to her home. That progressed so quickly. They started to bomb the trains,\nand we were just having the hardest time to go to Warsaw which was by plane maybe an hour\nand a half. It took us four days to go to Warsaw. When we came there, her husband\n, said, look they are already progressing here. They are vandalizing, even the\nPolish people vandalizing Jewish homes. I think it would be wise if you and Ava start to make\nyour way to . That's where her parents lived and my mother and Ruzia, and her father\nwas a very prominent oral surgeon, Doctor Katzner. It took us twelve days, ten or twelve days.\nEverytime the train was bombed, we had to jump, no matter how high the train was into the\nembarkment. We were bleeding all over. Our clothes were torn. We didn't have food. But\nwhen we stopped, there happened to be a little town. The people came out and said, what 1s\ngoing on. Tell us where they are, and brought some food out to us. When we find, as you know\nat that time the Germans invaded Poland there was the agreement between the foreign minister\nof Germany and who was the foreign minister from Stalin's, from\nRussia, from the Bog River east of the Bog River the Russians will invade that portion of Poland.\nThat of course was this camp \u2014\u2014\u2014.:~XSO when we made our way to , she was\nfinancially better situated so they lived in a completely different area, and I lived on the front\narea. As a matter of fact, when we were in Warsaw, they took only possession, a\nand it was lucky. That was the only thing we could cover ourselves at night, because we didn't\nhave anything else. I did not make a contact with her until after the war. I did not know what\nhappened to her. If you are interested I will tell you about it, but when I reach , my\nmother quickly put me into the basement because I don't remember if there were passports, or\nwere they some types of documents that they had to be identified by because the Russians went\nfrom one apartment or house to another to take a survey as to how many people are there. So,\nMother was afraid that they will arrest me because I was the newcomer and they were already\nthere. So, through the contacts of my sister's husband, who was . She was\nalready married, he was a mathematician and he was working, help the Russians, and he was\nable to get some papers. I don't know what they said. I know that I was able to come out. That\ntime, the Russians confiscated lots of factories and took us to work, but I didn't feel good. I felt\nthat I was lightheaded. I was sick to my stomach and did not know maybe malnutrition or\nwhatever and Poland and that time was already socialized medicine. I went to see a doctor and\nfound out that I was two or three months pregnant. I don't even remember. To this day, I don't\nknow how the pregnancy was not interrupted from jumping so many times. Sometimes we had\nto jump every fifteen minutes because the train was so terribly bombed, and I just was pregnant.\nMy grandparents were still alive at that time. My grandfather in particular was religious. My\nmother was very much for aborting the child, but my grandfather felt no. So, I still was working,\nnot too much food to begin with, and my sister was working, but she was still living with her\nhusband, more near which was more of a Jewish section. She played beautifully\npiano, and her desire was one time to become maybe a pianist. I don't remember if she already\nhad her son, Gaynish, but I know when the German came he was around a year and half out, so I\nwill have to calculated it back. Everything is just like a bad dream. However, we were working,\nand I think I worked until my eight months, very hard because they did not let us stop. I don't\nrecall what we were doing, but I do recall that there was like a quota. If you didn't make so\nmany pieces in one hour, they will push you to a very bad job, sometimes cleaning the worst\ntoilets that you can imagine. So I was very, very pressed, and not feeling well. I was rushed out\nto a hospital to deliver, and she was a beautiful -- her name was Lydia. She was like 2 1/2\nmonths old and everybody thought she looked like an angle, but somehow, due to the milk, there\nwas not a formula or anything. Nothing was sterilized, she developed dysentery, like a very bad\ncase of diarrhea, and the doctor hospitalized her. I went every day to the hospital after work, and\nthey showed me through a window because they felt it was a communicable disease. But one\nday I came and they didn't show her and they say she's dead. That was I think she was only three\nmonths or three and a half months old. That took lots and lots of maneuvering really to get the\nbody out so we can bury her near my father, so she wouldn't be alone. That was the end of that.\nBut the Russian was not very easy to live under either. They just unannounced would knock on\nthe door, came and took whatever they liked. My mother had some nice china and they wanted it\nso it was not even would you give me. I remember being just so attached to the drawing that that\nwas my father and never knew him, but from the pictures sometimes he stood at the foot of my\nbed and I could visualize him and I was a fan of his that he had a very nice\nand of other literary writers and philosophers like Hiner Shuller, a\nman, and I thought one day I will have it in my home. Well, it stayed there until the Germans\ncame, but then they raped also some people-- the Russians. They also came and tortured you\nthat tomorrow they come and they emptied out, but mostly they were like and when\nthey find our watches they just have like five watches on one hand and the other, they never had\nthose things. Or they took a nightgown from the women and just wear it as a dress. They were\nvery primitive. My mother felt that they interfere a lot in the war of and when we\nheard that eventually maybe the Germans come, my mother said, \"It couldn't be worse.\" But\nonce again, she was wrong. At least we were alive. Now, I spoke to a friend of mine who was\nvery young when he left Poland. He's an orthopedist in our town, and I spoke to Andy Solenski,\nand I said, for some reason as a matter of fact the night before I came here, I said Andy for some\nreason I feel that the Germans attacked Russia and forced themselves into our territory that there\nwas in 1939 -- excuse me in 1941 that it was in June, because I remember that was my sister's\nbirthday, and my mother baked a cake and asked and the little boy who was\nalready alive, to come and stay with me. That same night we heard shots and commotion and we\nrun to the window and we saw the Russian soldiers running with mattresses under their arm and\nwe knew something is brewing, and that's how the Russians went out, because the Germans\ncame in. Then, the other set of problems started. We were in our apartment still and I failed to\nsay that my grandparents had a very hard time when the Russians were there. When they got\ndrunk they came to the restaurant and sometimes with the bottles of liquor stayed and everything\nthey would just push everything on the floor and just destroy it. They took it very hard that they\ncould not operate and support the whole family. My grandmother took very ill and within one\nweek of each other, they passed away. My uncle who was my father's brother, , his\ndaughter is my cousin who lives in Paris, Nira, and is married to a non-Jewish, but non-believer\nreally, a Parisian artist. She has a son Stephen and his wife Marie-Noell and they visited\nMitchell and I here last year, and he continued to operate the restaurant and we still lived in that\nhouse the whole family together. But then they established a Ghetto and they start to line up the\npeople and we had to leave everything behind, and my that I somehow thought I\nwas going to have that from my father, and we moved and I don't remember the street. There\nwas a big building with lots of stories, three or four stories. We moved to an apartment where\none and a half rooms, two families lived. My mother and I. Ruzia was still there, and another\nfamily with three children. It was very hard. But when the Russians left, , who\nwere very religious. The father had a beard. The mother had a . I don't know what\nitis in English. A wig? I see. They had a daughter who also by coincidence her name was\nRose. Now, today, I think it is multiple sclerosis. She was unable to walk. She was bedridden,\nand the father of Zigmund encouraged Zigmund that still going back to the Russian occupation,\nencouraged the boys, there was Zigmund and two brothers. One of them now a year ago\nestablished contact with me , who by the way told me he saw my sister's\nhusband Zigmund after the war in Russia. He encouraged him to make his way to Israel, but he\nknew he left my sister and a little child, and he told him he's going to try to reach .\nEvidently he never did, because cannot put traces or find him, and never reached us.\nWhatever, we were not there to begin with. Then his father encouraged us to come and live in\ntheir house because they had a little house, like four rooms. And it was once again, very hard to\nget milk or bread or anything and he was going courageously out trying to get something for his\ngrandson. One time when he left he never came back, so when asked me what\nhappened to my father, the only estimate I could say that they caught him or shoot him. I don't\nknow. Then the mother did not know what to do with her daughter Rose, and I think she lost her\nmind. She was just going around the streets and screaming, and they must have shot her because\nshe never came back, and here I was with Mom, myself, and then Ruzia was at that time, and\nZigmund was already in the Russian Army and when the Russians were moving away when the\nGermans came, they followed the Russian army and that's why he felt then it would be better to\nhave the German people come. We had both of the atrocities, and before we moved in with this\nother family, when I said that we lived in that building that had few stories, it's hard to believe\nhow many people jumped to their death from third or fourth floor. I remember one prominent\ndoctor who did it with his wife together because they didn't want to face what can happen to\nthem.\nQ. Was this when the Germans came?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Did you see them?\nA. Yes. So, that's why when you asked me to do that, after 50 years, which 1s a half century,\nto really delve into my memory things that I try so hard to suppress, it was very hard for me.\nThen, we didn't have any money, and we didn't have any means to support ourselves and there\nwas already the Germans. I was wearing an arm band with the Star of David and J, Judea. I took\noff my arm band. I was very blonde, long hair, they say blue eyes. I always thought I have\ngreen eyes, and I went to the other side to the brewery, and tried to bring beer, bottles of beer. It\nwas very small, but I still feel that my wrists were very very affected by it. I had surgery here\nand carpal tunnel, and I just went back and forth and sold the beer to the people who had money.\nMama was able to get a bushel of flour and make something to eat for us. Then the Germans\ntook over the factories the same that the Russians had, and we start to work there again. But\nRuzia was designed to clean the streets, so she came a few times. She was so delicate, so very\npretty, and she said as long as the child is here, and we took care as best we can. Mother didn't\nwork anymore, and the brewery was taken over by the Germans. One day she just didn't come.\nOne day just like the next day maybe came a Polish man. He was a conductor of a trolley, and\nhe knocked on the door and he asked for Ava and I said I am Ava, and he said that my sister is\ngoing to be taken to Auschwitz and she's so hungry. She would like to have a piece of bread. I\nasked him where they are going to march the whole group of people, and he told me. I took my\narmband off and went on the other side and stayed there while they were walking. The men\nlooked like skeletons and they even picked up anything that was on the street. Sometimes I\nwonder if it was even something from animals, everything. I saw Ruzia and I just run out and I\ndon't know, there was a Ukrainian or some German Gestapo took my arm and they said\nand I said no, I'm Polish. I throwed the bread to her and she said please take\ncare of Gaynosh. I never saw her again. Then usually the German people used the young Jewish\nboy as the hatcher man. They were always the ones to select somebody or to take them\nsomewhere and I know then from before or from school or something that we did together and at\nthat time when it started to be so bad and one time I worked at the factory and there were\ndifferent rooms and then I heard screaming like agony screaming, and I opened the door and\nthere was a girl -- I don't know if she was 16 or 17, and she was profusely bleeding like you\nwould think somebody had menstrual bleeding. She said, they raped me with the foot of the\nstool. Then I heard other screaming and then a Polish superintendent of that factory came over\nand grabbed me by the hand and he pulled me down to the basement and that's how I got\nacquainted with the basement. Then, at that time, I know I have to do something with Mom and\nGaynosh. I asked -- see in the Ghetto there was like a you have to go through a gate where there\nwere Germans and Ukrainians and the Jewish who were sort of going back and forth, the young\nmen. At that time, I asked then if there was any possibility that I can get Gaynosh out of the\nGhetto. They said how, and I said we just put something in his mouth and see and I spoke with\nthat Sishko, that from brewery, the director, and I was such a close friend with her, went together\nwith her to school. I told her that I would like to Gaynosh to her aunt who was without children.\nMaybe she will raise him. She said let me talk. Then when I came for the beer and she said try\nit. I told her what day that would be and so with the armband -- you know there is like a wagon\nthat you sit higher up and when you take the seat there is like a compartment and the baby was\naround here and maybe in three months over a year I remember and just prior to the gate I\nstuffed a little hanky in his mouth and then they stopped us and they said and I\nsaid I have to testify because I saw some Jewish people doing something wrong and they take me\nto headquarter. When we reach the other side, they couldn't go near the brewery, but they left\nme off and I held a shawl over my head and the baby and somebody from the back stopped me\nand I said \"yeah,\" and he said where are you going and I said home with my baby. Who are you,\nI say Iam Polish. What is your religion? I said catholic. That's what I don't know so many\nthings I was able to get away. I don't know how. I placed the baby at that time with them with\nthe understanding that after the war somehow somewhere I will get the baby. Can I retreat?\nWhen I was in the house of , | had the baby and my mother and oh, by the way one\ntime they come in the Germans and that one that was bedridden and just took her\nout like a piece of garbage, and she was gone, which was a blessing. Really, I could not lift her\nevery day there was only me and Mom. There was no real life for her, but in this\nhouse I didn't know it, but the neighbors who lived there for so many years, they know each\nother. One time a Jewish family came and said, you know there is a door in the floor going to\nthe cellar. It was flush with the floor, but there were steps going down where evidently they\npickled something for the winter, whatever. It was like storage room. Could we hide? Well,\nthey said if they catch us, we're all going to be dead. Well, it got so bad that they started to\nround up people and take them out to the concentration camp, I had 15 people in that cellar\nincluding my mom and Gaynosh. That was before. There was a bed and I seen him sitting there.\nThey came, not only that they came, 15 people, but there three children in the age of five to\nmaybe nine and I was so afraid that they may cry or say something loud. So, I was upstairs and\nfour or five Gestapo men say , everybody , and I said in German,\nthere is nobody here, just me and my child. He said you go here you go there and they stuck the\ntop on the thing and for me to tell them downstairs to sit quiet, I said, but there is no one here,\nbut there is no one here. There was silence and then when the Gestapo grabbed Gaynosh and I\nsaid please don't do nothing to him and the other one said, let him sit we come some other time.\nThen he said are you sure you're Jewish. I said maybe not, but it didn't help me too much, but\nthen he threw an apple, I thought he was going to kill the child, that was a good gesture, and\nsome candies and they left. I asked once again, what a miracle. Then when I took out Gaynosh,\nI placed my mother with a neighbor that we used to live way back where my grandfather's house\nwas. We didn't have much, but mama had such small little diamond earrings that evidently my\nfather gave her when they were married. Don't forget that Ruzia was 2 and a half years older so\nthey had some time together. I think her two rings and she wanted me to take it so I can survive.\nThey say no, I want you to have that. Maybe at one time they will ask you to do that so they can\nbuy food. So we made like a pouch in her dress that she had. We couldn't take too much with\nus. There were only two dresses that each one of us had and we sewed it underneath and that\nwas what I left her. My heart was somehow easier because I took care of that. Then, that didn't\ngive me too much time to really do something for myself. We were just taken in big cattle\nwagons in the concentration camps. So, I found myself there towards the end of '41, 42, and\nwhat one saw in that concentration camp, it's really better to repress that. One time, of course\nthey had I think it was recreation for them. Every time at night which were just bunk beds, no\npillows, no sheets, no nothing, you just lie there, and roll calls. When it was snowing or raining\nor thundering that you put your feet like that and sit with your head down and then they would\nwith the rifles would point out you go to your right, you go to your left, you go to your right.\nYou never know which one side is better. Then one of them was to be just get away in some\nmeans. Sometimes they called it twice a night and then you had to get up at 5:00 to go to work.\nThen they would give you soup which you could find nothing in it. One time they put us there to\n-- let me say, when you came there, they shaved everyone.\nQ. This is ?\nA. Yanosko, Limberg. They shaved us and then you hear this screaming because they asked\neverybody to open their mouths and they have like gold crowns, they just knocked it out, which\nwas terribly painful. They just undress us. Men, women, children. It was almost unhuman.\nThen they pushed us to different barracks and when evening or at night when they built a fire and\nthere like a which was like a heap and then they put a big fire and while we were\nsitting there, you could see the fire. It was not a recreational fire, it was quite a large area and the\nflames were going up and with their rifles they were pointing to people giving them instructions\nto dress, to undress, whatever there was, one gown you were wearing and to throw himself on the\nburning. There was a mother and a daughter sitting near me. I don't think the daughter maybe\nwas 14 or 15 years of age. He pointed out only to the mother and when the mother was still\nundressing, the daughter quickly got up and undressed and followed her, and many others\nperished the same way. Sometimes they would take us out and they would have those vicious\ndogs and when they found out that somebody was a rabbi, I remember one was a priest even who\ntried to hide the Jewish children, and pushed the dogs and you could see how the flesh was\ncoming off these people. Sometimes they hang the people and the Jewish boys who were in\ncontrol. I don't know if they could say no, sometimes I feel, and they were hanging there for us\nto see and then the Gestapo would say, you are the next. Just torturing, torturing us. One time in\nthe roll call order were young people and the older people were sitting and the Ukrainian took --\nher name was Bosha, took her out and we thought maybe he was going to save her, but when she\ncame back she said he raped me and then he came and shot her. I had all her blood, you could\neverything from her brain. He shot her right here in the head. How can you have a very normal\nlife when you think of that. One time I was selected to well asked to go and sort the clothing of\nthe people who they still round up from different places. That was the only time that I had done\nthat. That was the time that I found my mother's dress. I found the pouch. Of course there was\nnothing in it and I asked everybody if they came across Sabina Mueller and I looked at\neverybody who marched out to work. So, I don't know if they found her where she was hiding or\nif she was there and I never saw her because when I talked to my cousin in Paris, she was like 15\nyears younger than I, Mira said before I went to Auschwitz I was in Limberg and never saw her.\nIt was a big camp. At that time there was a Gestapo man who we know that he is sadist. He was\nchoking people, especially young girls. One time he selected me to work in his house to clean\nhis house. His house was like a stone away from the door that rifles and Gestapo and everyone\nwas watching when the people are going out, but the women were not going out anymore. So,\none time, around that time, we were selected to help the men dig trenches, and they said, this is\nnot deep enough. The men were like skeletons, no food nothing. Then once again, right, left,\nright left. Then they put the men facing the trenches and then the music played, famous\nand the . That's how they buried the people or tortured them and\nthe squadron shot the people, sometimes not enough to kill them and then they order to bury\nthem. And you can hear the voices, help me help me and they were just buried alive. That time,\nI made up my mind if they shoot me that's okay. I spoke to the young man that you used to go\nwith women and men out to the factory to work. His name was Jacob. I said, you're coming to\nthat house where I work for that Gestapo. He never talked to me, he just said pointing that's not\nclean enough, but he never did anything to me. He never gave me food neither. But, this Jacob\nused to come and bring some cans of milk, which we didn't have it. I said do you think you can\ndream up a pair of pants. I would like to escape. I have a nephew. I have to take care of him. I\npromised my sister. He said gosh I don't know how I can do it. I said you bring that in a basket.\nEverybody is taller than you Ava. I said I will round it up, don't worry. If they shoot me, they\nshoot me. I have nothing to lose. And one day he did it. He said 5:00 you have to drop into that\nrow of people and just walk. Of course I did not look very much like a man, and maybe my walk\nwas funny, but we were almost to get into the trolley when they start, \"halt, halt\" and they\nrecognize. I jumped into the trolley and the conductor refused to stop. He saw that I was\nescaping and he went. Later on I have learned that he was shot because he come minus one, that\nJacob. He was shot. It was also hard for me to live with that he somehow did it for me and he\nwas not able to survive. That time they went to that factory where I sometimes went to the\nbasement where the women work before, remember I befriended myself with that\nsuperintendent. I went in that basement all alone. I heard the voices. I bet they were rats. I was\nso scared, but my head was shaved. I couldn't go out, and I stayed there until they left that\nbuilding, which was around 4:00 and I knew there was a telephone in some room. I quickly\nwanted to call Sishka and I said I escaped. She said My God, am I going to take you. You're\ngoing to have to wait. I don't want to tell my mother. Maybe Stashu, her brother, will somehow\npick you up and bring some clothing. Then I heard steps, and my heart stopped and that was the\nsuperintendent. He said what are you doing? I said I escaped, can you help me and he said my\nwife is not going to do that. Let me talk to her. He talked to her and she said here is soup. Eat\nthe soup and go. Where would I go? Go back to the cellar. Let me just use your phone and I\ncan tell her where Iam. She did that, gave me a scarf so I can cover my head and then sometime\nit was very, very dark that they came and I jumped into there. They couldn't take me to their\nhome. They placed me in a shack and they brought me some food. I think I stayed there for\nalmost three and a half weeks, until my hair grew to something like you have, so I can go out.\nSometime very late at night they would let me take a shower and that was a blessing.\nEnd of Tape 1\nTape 2\nQ. Before we go on, I want to go back a little bit.\nA. All right.\nQ. When you saw those people committing suicide, jumping out of -- did you ever think to\nyourself that you wanted to commit suicide?\nA. Not then. Not then. Suicide no. I just didn't care. When my mother and Gaynosh were\ntaken there was a time when I didn't care. Only when I found mother's clothing and I knew that\nshe was no longer alive, then I had that great desire to fulfill my promise to my sister. Because\nwhen they took her to Auschwitz and I threw that bread if she caught it or not I will never know,\nand shear miracle that that Ukrainian or German let go of my arm and didn't pull me together\nthrough that marching group, I felt, I have to fulfill my promise to her. Suicide no, I'm just not\ngeared to it.\nQ. Were you afraid of being raped?\nA. Yes, that I was. And by a very great miracle, even later on when I was in Vienna, where\nI will tell you from the point when I enlisted remind me to tell you about a very close call to rape\nand I will touch on that. I'm trying to do it sequence as possible. Have you have any other\nquestions?\nQ. Yes. When you were escaping --\nA. From the concentration camp?\nQ. From the concentration camp, but I want to ask you both about the escaping about taking\nyour mother out, about taking Gaynosh out. It seems very brave to think about going outside and\ntaking the chance?\nA. It was not so brave. There was really guts and the will to do that. I was bringing really\nincome to the family by going everyday out to the brewery, taking my armband. Good, I was\nblonde and blue eyes as they say, but nevertheless it was going out, facing -- it was like two\ndifferent cities. Ghetto was all Jewish the other side was not. That was taking a chance.\nWalking through the streets and seeing them marching and looking at you and pretend that you\nare just hah-hah and you just smiling good day. That was brave. But then when they took my\nmother out, I didn't do it by myself because there I have the help once again of the Jewish boys\nwho also took mother out to Gestapo headquarters and then she was going out to our area where\nwe lived. That was brave because where my father lived, we were known there. Where my\ngrandfather lived, we were known there. She was there I don't know how long, but 1t must have\nbeen at least to that year that I found it unless they kept the clothing that long, but that was in the\nbeginning of 1943.\nQ. How did you go out everyday, through the gate?\nA. No, through the other street that was just a hole and I was just making my way out\nbecause there was no wire in the Ghetto. There were just streets. If you knew the area you could\njust try to get out, and that's how I went almost every day.\nQ. Were you afraid?\nA. Yes, yes. Because I wanted to go back. As said, my cousin from England,\nmy mother always said Ava is so brave. That was under good circumstances. Until today, I am\nthe do gooder, always for other people. I do it today, too. I think that's my nature, but then my\nmother was a widow. We didn't have money, and she was working, and she was very active in\nan orphanage house. Her name was on the orphanage house, so every time when she was saying\nto us, to both of us, if you feel that you are deprived, just look at the children who are much\nworse off, and then you see how lucky you are. Then, I said, well, how lucky we are. But then I\ndid the same thing with my children when they didn't eat, I would just say, see you don't finish,\npeople in Europe would give anything for crumbs, and Mitchell was always joking and he said,\nmother, pack the crumbs and send them. But both of them grew up to be very charitable. I\nremember we were in New York and walking through the streets there was a man without feet\nand a beggar and Mitchell said can I have my advance 25 cent allowance. I'll pay you back, and\nthen he went and gave to the man. You live by example. You live by example, and therefore I\nfeel that the children, whether it be German or Polish or Lithuanian, they don't grow up with\nprejudices. They're taught. They're taught, therefore, I feel that really the United States\nHolocaust in Washington or any other museums are memorials that were erected in the memory\nof this six million will somehow educate the people and let them know what hatred and bigotry\ncan do. Not only to a group of Jewish people, but it could be an individual what they have done\nto the homosexuals or lesbians or to any other group. One day they may turn because they are\ncatholics, but I think I always think that Hitler couldn't do those atrocities by himself. He got the\nmasses to follow him. That is the tragedy. How blindly people follow. One, it be crazy or\nirrational and do what is absolutely against any principle to being a human being. This is what is\nhard to understand for me. Do you have any other questions. Maybe I didn't make myself clear.\nQ. I'm interest to hear a little bit again about your escape from camp on the\ntrolley. I don't quite understand how you got away.\nA. Well, when you asked me before did I care or was I scared or did I have any reason or\nwould I like to live. That was the time that I felt that I would like to fulfill my promise to my\nsister Ruzia. I had a desire to escape, and in that time, no, I wasn't scared. If they would have\nshot me in my own heart I know I placed Gaynosh and I placed my mother. I didn't know what\ntheir fate was going to be at the end, but at that time I felt good. When I was working for that\nGestapo who was that sadist cleaning his house, and then I had to go to the barracks. I didn't\nstay, but I came there almost at 4:00 to his house. 4:00 in the morning, without any food, and\nwhen I spoke to that Jacob and I told him just drop me off some pants. I cannot go in a dress or\nskirt because there was just that outfit. When he brought that, he said you will have to fall in at\n5:00 and march with the men, but you are so short they're going to spot you. I said don't worry,\nif they shoot me, they shoot me. Don't worry. Just give me a chance. There was a big gate, and\nthere were dogs and people with rifles to shoot when they didn't like somebody. Maybe\nsomebody looked very fragile and they didn't let them go. They just pulled them out and shot\nthem right there. This we saw too. Then everybody tried to stand up straight so they still with\ntheir last breath of their strength could go out. I marched in and tried being short to get closer\nand closer to the first, second row and then just outside the gate was the trolley that took them to\nthe factory. Then, when I started to walk faster and faster, someone of them spotted me, and\nthey started to \"halt, halt, stop, stop, stop.\" Nobody stopped. They were marching and I quickly\nrun into the trolley and said to the conductor. I'm escaping and I'm not even Jewish, I'm Polish\nand I'm trying to escape because they took me by mistake, because I didn't know what the Polish\nperson was thinking of the whole story neither. So, I said they shaved my head and I have to go\nand find my family. When they came almost very close to the trolley all the men were there and\nhe took off and they were shooting and he said, I don't stop, I go. He said in Polish\n, we go. But unfortunately later on I know that they shot that Jewish younger\nman, that Jacob because first of all they know that a woman was in his group, and also that he\ncame minus one. So, I lived for a while with that guilt too, and when you start to think about it,\nwhich I don't want to think about it, you have a very guilty feeling. Even now that we were in\nthe beginning, well, it still didn't come to the marriage, so I'll tell you that later. If you have any\nquestions going back, I'll continue.\nQ. Go ahead continue on when you were hiding.\nA. All right. I was there in that shacks, two shacks, like I have one now in my own house.\nThey brought some food when it was very dark, because they still don't know -- there was a\ncluster of homes of the directors, the higher ups lived on that area. Higher ups like the directors\nof the brewery and things like that. They didn't know what is going to happen. But when I came\nthere, my feeling was I'm going to see Gaynosh, and I said where is . Oh, they\ndidn't want to stay here because they were afraid of the Germans and they went to\nCzechoslovakia, and they took Gaynosh with him. Gaynosh is Gershin named after my father\nlike my son Gary is always named after my father. Then she told me that after the war I can find\nher, which I will tell you what I did after the war. I stayed there I think to my best recollection of\nthree and a half weeks, to gain a little hair and then one day came and said you\nknow what, I spoke to Wanda she's in and she and Peter are working in the\nunderground. They are helping lots of Jewish people and also bombing the bridges so the\nGermans cannot go from one side to another. They said that you should make your way to\nbecause lots of people registered as Polish to go to Germany or Austria. Of course, I\nwanted to go to Vienna because I knew so many people. In that time, I just once again, took a\nchance and went to by train. Somebody could recognize me. That's that famous\nblouse that you have the picture that gave me, and one skirt and that 1s all that I\nhad. I registered. I had to wear an armband that said P \"Polish.\" They asked me if I would go to\nBerlin first, and I said no, can I go to Vienna, Austria, preferably Vienna. Of course you could\nspeak like a Polish. You could not speak like a Jew. The Germans said do you speak German\nand I said yes. I went to work in Vienna. is -- have you ever been in Vienna\nJoan? You know where the , Just on that street, which you come out and you\ncross the , which 1s just like Fifth Avenue in New York. Then you have that\n. This is where . There was a Nazi. What was his first\nname? Adolph, Adolph Shiltz. Maybe he still exists, and the Gestapo and the SS, Storm Fuhrer\ncould not bear to have shirts with machine made button holes. They had to be hand made.\nThat's what we did. We found by midway there was five of us who registered in different areas.\nBut somehow we find ourselves working for that Mr. Shiltz. My name is --- I'm still in\n. I lived longer -- excuse me, I retract, I was in living\nwith my girlfriend Wanda and Peter and they asked me if I would like to work with them\nunderground. I said I cannot take the chances. I wanted to see Ruzia's son and I would rather go\non and work. So, my hair grew like that and I had nice hair. You have a picture of that, and\nthat's how I register. I always had a nice smile. My mother said, the only nice pretty things that\nI have was my teeth and my eyes and they did not even want to put a filling in my teeth. There\nwas a Polish girl in Vienna. They just pulled the teeth, which I lost three on that side, two on\nthat side. It was a little better treatment. They didn't kill you, but it was not easy to live and to\nbe somebody else.\nQ. What was your name?\nA. Ava Stephanie Rutkofska. And Peter gave me those papers, but my birthday was the\nsame. When I left, I have a picture with Peter and myself. I will make a copy and send you that\nbecause he really helped me out. I don't know where he is now. I start to write but nothing.\nThen, I came to that Mr. Shiltz and also they washed the laundry there for those Gestapo. So,\nthere were baskets that we had to cross the and go to that Weinberger and I\nwas so ashamed to just carry that dirty laundry there. There was a Yugoslavian. He was always\nin civilian clothes. I really don't know what he was, but he was influential, and knowing that I\nwas Ava, he always called me Avasha, and he always said how pretty Iam. He said, it seems\nlike I see that you are ashamed. Let me take one side of the basket and carry it with you. He\nwas very instrumental later. This is what it was. So, we had like iron \u2014\u2014_\u2014saa very mediocre\npillow one thin blanket and one was scared of the other. All girls, are you going to church, are\nyou going to say novena. Are you going to the evening services, and yes, of course. And one\nwas watching the other how we are crossing ourselves only to find out that all of us were Jewish.\nIt wasn't easy. We all had a shelf were we had our underwear and the blouse, the one blouse I\nwashed every day and ironed. And working for that Adolph Schiltz, he always tried -- he\nsomehow took to me, his wife too and those two children and the little one. He said\ncome in here and I said yes. Do you know what the word is. You never heard of\nthat. Then there were other Jewish expressions and I said how would I know that. Well, aren't\nyou Close to the Jewish people. I said, well they could be my neighbors but they did not know\nthe language. Then that man that I worked for that sadist one day he came in 1944. He came in\nShiltz, Heil Hitler and of course he was such a Nazi and I don't know how I possibly put my head\nso deep down that he doesn't see me. Maybe he would not even recognize me. I had hair and\nlooked different, but I thought my heart stopped. He was talking about us, Shiltz, with him,\nbecause they were looking at our side. I couldn't say anything to the girls because I didn't know\nthey were Jewish. So, they say, is something wrong. I said no I just see that 1S\nhere. I wonder what he wants. Maybe he 1s looking for Polish girls because Mr. Shiltz talks to\nhim. IfI get nervous I talk. As you know, I told you that, and finally he was going like toward\nus, but there was a little T.V. and that was the time that the Germans had lots of trouble in\nRussia. As a matter of fact, one of the Jewish girls, the only one I don't know her name, she was\nfrom Lodz of course in the Irish papers she was Marisha, but what I understand her brother was a\nfamous Jewish historian. I don't know her name and she was singing or reciting the\nyou know, backwards. March, march forward and then backwards. Maybe\nshe expressed herself that way before really it was peace, and they took her and she vanished the\nlast days of the war. However, they looked on the T.V. and I did not know there was a little T.V.\non the shelf and that's where he stopped so they didn't reach us. It's another miracle.\nQ. You mean they had a surveillance camera of some kind?\nA. Just a T.V., but he didn't want us to know that the Germans were having problems in\nRussia and they're trying to withdraw. Remember the time that they were having problems. You\nknow, we have like rations, it's what they're known here as stamps, but we could by some food\nfor it. One time I went to restaurant which was a cafe house and I had my P, my armband, and I\nalways was aware of it that people may recognize me because I used to live in Vienna. There\nwas a woman, I can see her like today, a black hat a black turtle neck. She was just like you bury\npeople. All in black. And she was looking at me and looking. I couldn't swallow. I had a cup\nof soup, and I couldn't hardly swallow. She just have noticed my uneasiness and finally she\ncame over and she said, hello. She said, are you hiding. I said no, I'm working here, a Polish\ngirl. Where are you working? I say ina German place. She said, you can tell me, are you\nJewish? I said no, and she said you can be honest with me. I would like to help you. I watched\nyou. I must have been in the restaurant before. You always have the same outfit. Can I buy\nsomething for you, and I said, that's the end. She must be from the German Gestapo. I said, I\ndon't accept anything from people. She said, what's your first name? I said Ava. Ava, ah,\n, | said Ava, I'm Polish, and she said, confide in me because I will confide in you. I\nam Jewish. My husband was not. That's why we don't live together, not to bring harm to him,\nbut I have a son I wish you could meet him. His name is Eric. I said I cannot date anybody\nbecause that's against the rules. Well, where are you working. I said not ar away from here and\nshe just extracted from me and I said , and she said I give you the address. I\ndon't have a telephone. You can call me. I said I don't have a telephone where we live. One\ntime, at work, a German there always were Germans, SS or Gestapo coming came a very\nhandsome tall young fellow, once again Heil Hitler and they start to look once again our way. I\nsaid, uh-huh, that's the woman who denounced me and Shiltz said, \"Come in here.\nwants to meet me.\" I said I don't know anybody. So, he said, I am Eric.\nYou know that smile on his face, oh his teeth and I said I don't know you do I? He said, I think\nyou would know me if we talked together. He didn't want to speak in front of Shiltz. That\nmakes me a little easier and I said how do you want to talk to me? Mr. Shiltz said use my office.\nI thought they're wired and they're just going to just -- so he pried again and he said my mother\nsaw you and she really almost fell in love with you. She made me come and meet you. I said,\nfor what reason. Because I can help you. You see, I'm half Jewish, but I cannot tell them\nbecause I am with the and I said well I'm Polish so that doesn't go together, and I\nhave a Polish boyfriend, and he said, well, he cannot help you, but I can. I said, well, maybe\nsometime in the future. He come once again, and I was in the hands of Mr. Shiltz who said you\nought to go out with him. He never tried to do anything to me. He just said can my mother --\nnot he, can my mother buy you -- you will make her so happy. I said no I don't need anything.\nSo, one day he came and he told Mr. Shiltz. He didn't ask me, but he asked Mr. Shiltz if he\ncould take me overnight to -- he named her name, I remember only her name was Elli and she\nwas in the . I don't remember the street. She owned a shoe store and a most\nbeautiful apartment and a very known husband of a , and she was a Nazi. He\nasked Shiltz that he would like to take me for a date there to a party. Then I found out that she\ntook over the Jewish families, the store, the shoe store and all his apartment with beautiful\nthings, with paintings that maybe you see in Louvre, and a big bust of Adolph Hitler. Then came\nsome other young soldiers that they came from Poland, SS men to the party, and Eric was there\ntoo. This young man who was maybe half drunk he was telling the group something that would\namuse them. I just came from near Limberg where we tied each child to a branch of the tree and\nput it aflame. And he said, why don't you laugh. I don't know. I don't find it funny. They are\nhuman beings. But they were Jewish. I said, oh, not to get myself into trouble, and Eric looked\nat me and he said, well I have some plans to take to show her a little bit around\nbecause she can not really go as a Polish girl. He must have seen something on my face, and I\ndon't know if Ellie knew something or not, but she always felt that I'm her . She\ntook to me. One time she came to Shiltz, Heil Hitler, she wants to take me to the Gestapo.\nRemember marching up those big headquarters, all those steps up with all those swastikas and I\nwent there and she said could you say Heil Hitler and I said Ellie don't ask me to do that. I'm\nPolish. And she said, \"I'll protect you.\" And she introduced me my . But she\ndidn't use Rutkofska. My , So I didn't have to add that. Then when it was very\nbad and the Germans were really retreating and there was lots of being in the basement, shooting,\nand the Russians came in from the other side, she had to go to to run away, and\nshe said the only thing, stay in my apartment but be sure that you take care of the\nbust of Adolph Hitler. Well, that was the first thing that went through the window. Then I took\nall the people that I know, Polish, Jewish and asked them to come to the shoe store and take as\nmany shoes as they can, and that was my revenge. At least to her. I never saw Eric or anyone.\nBut you spoke about the rape, but when the Russians came into that part, which later on they\nretreat on the other side of the Danube, I was living with a family, a German family who were\nEllie's friends. He was a piano player, blind, very nice family, and his wife was Maria. They\ntook me, so when the officer of the Russians came, they caught me in that building and asked to\nbring it down. This person laying down on the table and he said, \"I'm going to have intercourse\nwith you.\" And somebody went quickly upstairs to I think his name was Paul, that blind man I\nlived with. I don't remember the last name, and he came blind with a stick and he said, let my\nsister go. That's how close I was to it. Just because he was blind, I think, that that's what really\ntook that person back.\nQ. This was a Russian soldier?\nA. A Russian officer. Then I understand that many people in that building worried, and then\nwe heard that the American soldiers came on that side and I came down walked on the street and\nthere was an American soldier and I didn't speak English an I said American and he said yes.\nName? And he said Orbanik. I said are you Polish? He said, yes, no speak it. Never even tried\nto find him, but then I don't know with that United Jewish restitution who came with the\npackages and everything like for the Jewish people or was it that what was that?\nJoint Distribution, that's what it was. So, I came. I didn't have any food, nothing too much, and I\nsaid, I'm Jewish and I would like to register and they said, but you don't look Jewish. I said, are\nwe going to do in reverse now. Hitler thought I do, and you say I don't. He said, well,\neverybody would like to be Jewish to be a package. I said, that is unbelievable. Then there was\nnear the river and there was not far away from the , | was walking along and\nthat person that they showed you, the picture she was much older than I. I\nremember only she was coming to a mutual relative, and she was walking with a man and didn't\npay attention. I only heard her saying Oh, that girl looks like Sabina's daughter. My mother's\nname was Sabine. We turned around and she said, oh, maybe that is. So, I said, who are you.\nShe said are you Ava or Ruzia? I said, that's my sister Ruzia, I'm Ava. She said I'm\nand I had to recall when I met her she had always that beautiful hair growing all\nround. She was the first one to tell me where my mother was hiding. She came across in another\nhiding place with my mom, but then she was very good financially off so she was able to go to a\nsafer place and she never saw my mother again. So, she said, I hope you're getting food and I\ntold her what happened. So, she said, , 1t must be like some name, let me go with\nyou to the joint distribution and let me be a witness and I have that paper if you want to say Anna\nand I forgot his first name. They married eventually. He was in film industry and\nthey made a statement that I didn't know how to write -- read Jewish. They asked me to read that\nI am Jewish and I got a package with eggs and milk, and I broke out because I didn't have\nanything for so many years and to this day I cannot have eggs because I break out. I just can\nhave egg beater when they came out. That's how it was that history. So after I didn't have to\nwork anymore in Shiltz office, I start to enlist with to somehow finish my education\nin the business administration and I met a Valerie. Her father was a veterinarian and we made\nvery good friends, and that was still before they recognized me that I'm Jewish, because that\nhappened in 1944, almost the war was over. No, no, no, that happened in 1946, after the war\nwas already over. She invited me to her home to introduce me to her parents. They were very\nnice to me. They asked me to live with them. Then, in one Sunday dinner came Victor who was\na dentist and he started to just ask me out. Polish, that's what they talked. They were very happy\nthat we're going. They liked me, but they said that they were . You know, when\nyou lived in Prussia which was one time occupied by Germans. So, they had to go into Army, to\nthe military of Germany, but you were no the SS were you? He said no. I fought not to go, but I\nhad to serve. His father said, yes, we had to. I just bought it somehow. One time we went to the\nbeach and on his arm was SS and I said to his parents that they like him very much, but I cannot\ngo. That would be sacrilegious against my whole family. He cried, he said I didn't want to this\nway and that way, and her mother gave me a platinum chain, which I still have because I liked it.\nThen there was a Jewish doctor who is now in Chicago, Dr. Heller and his wife Ruthie and I told\nthem that, and he said Ava, denounce them. I bet the whole practice is overthrown Jews. He\nwas a Viennese. I start not to see him, but after when I start to inquire, my mother had a cousin\nthat I know that he sent her sometimes five or ten dollars because my father and my mother\nhelped him when he was a young man to come into a big city from a small little . lam\nstill in touch with his daughter Sadelle, in New York. She's married to a banker. He tried to\nwork with the restitution during this period. The papers started to be processed for me to come\nhere. At that time I denounced Victor, that he's an SS and his practice should be taken away, and\nI liked him, but I felt I had to do it. I did it. He tried to find me, because he knew me as a\nRutkofska. I saw him one time when I was with my husband, the only time in Vienna he was\nworking and he turned around and I turned around but that's all what it was it. Never called,\nnothing. It was hard to live being somebody else. It's not easy and especially when I was not\nrecognized. I had to go on for the longest time to pretend, otherwise I was no one. But then, I\ndecided to go to Czechoslovakia. I had to find Gaynosh. That was the whole purpose. So, I\nmake myself wait to go to Czechoslovakia but I was . I didn't belong\nanywhere.\nQ. What year was this?\nA. That was after the war '45, must be '46 before I even knew that was\ngoing to stop me. I went because there was a purpose, and they arrest me. One time, once again,\nthat Yugoslavian, or was he Czechoslovakian, he took me from one barrack to the other and he\nspotted me just like he helped me with that basket and he said . He must have\nhad pull, I still don't know what he did, and he said to them in the their language, which I didn't\nspeak, that he knows me. Somehow they free me. I Never was able to find Sishka or Gaynosh\nbecause he said I want you to leave right now because they may arrest you and I cannot get you\nout. So, there was absolutely no way. Then I started to get in contact with the Red Cross. All\nthe means that you can possibly think. When my husband, before he died went with me to Israel,\nI even went to made all the necessary information perhaps maybe they took the\nchildren to Israel, but to no avail, nothing. So, the nicest thing, Joan, what happened to me was I\nthought I would not turn to Judaism. That was my first thought. I thought if I ever have a\nfamily, I would not like them to go through what I went through just because you were Jewish.\nThere was no other reason. As a matter fact, I went to Parochial schools. And I have in my\nfamily people who are today practicing Christianity, but then I knew a friend from Poland, and\nshe was married to a doctor at the same hospital where my future husband now was working,\nwhich was the University Hospital in New York City, where my husband\nwas at that time, the last year resident already in the specialty of Radiology. They invite me to\nplay tennis with them. I never possessed my own racket because my mother couldn't afford. My\ncousin was very well to do and she was tall 6 feet and from her clothing sometimes they\nmade some dress for me, but we were always very close even though that she is closer to my\nsister's age, because I always told her the tricks when we came to visit her, as children. Her\nmother had governesses for her because nobody should blow on them and I always went\n. Iwas like Mitchell right now. Then, the family was not well to do but a very fine\nfamily of Milton Dorfman, and when I worked on Wall Street in the bank, at that time I\ninterpreted German and Polish. I knew a little bit Russian, and the other girls were Polish and I\nat one time when Magda said why don't you come and her husband was . Her\nson is one of the very known and he's in music that music that you and I possibly\ndon't understand. However, he is also a radiologist in Sausolito California, and his father was the\ngovernor of Maine and he was a very good friend of Milt, and we played tennis and I said, oh\nhe's so slow. He's not going to play good tennis. Well, he played tennis. I was jumping, but he\nplayed tennis. Then, what attracted me was that so many other people wanted to take me out to\nWaldorf Austoria or something and I was wondering what they would like to have in return for\nit, but Milt said we can have a hamburger or a hot dog and he always went like that because he\nwas wearing a jacket from Maury, from his older brother. I just thought that's nice. Then I met\nhim in 1948, very vaguely. That's what I wanted to tell you. Out of 35,000 people I was\nselected to be on a caravan of hope to bring my story and also there were two Israeli officers. I\nthink I sent you a clipping, Joan, of it. At that time I spoke of it worse than I speak now. I had\ndeveloped laryngitis and in our caravan of hope, we stopped in Utica, which is really near where\nI live since 1954 when I came with my husband at that time. The people were very nice. They\ntried to . I never knew what that 1s, but they were very friendly and I spot that.\nThat was in 1948, memories it was very hard to remember everything, and I even forgot that I\nwas in Springfield. When I sent you the clippings I said I was looking for some papers, and by\ncoincident I had the clippings from Springfield Massachusetts. Joan, if I wouldn't see my picture\nin that article, I cannot recall that I was in Springfield Massachusetts. No way. I remember I\nwas in Syracuse University because over there they once again, pretty girl with blue eyes and I\nalways thought I had green eyes, said now Ava Gardner will speak to us. Of course I don't know\nwho is Ava Gardner. I didn't see any movies, and I waited and they started to laugh. It's me. So,\nright now, before I came here. I tried to contact the Utica Observer Dispatch, which is a\nnewspaper, and they told me that if it's '48 or '49 it would be on microfilm in the public library,\nwhich I got the clipping that I showed you. Then I called the library and the University of\nSyracuse, and they send me a clipping which I showed you. They were one of the soldiers of the\nofficers was the nephew of the President to the Israeli state of , and the other\none lost both legs because I think that was the time that Israel gained independence in 1948 or\n'49. So, at that time I went on the caravan of Hope and the other place that stayed out in my\nmind. I had always that same blouse that you have the picture. I did not acquire anything else,\nand we went to Atlanta. I don't remember Atlanta but I remember the hotel that we stayed.\nThere was also a big philanthropist from Rochester , who when we got married,\nput carpet in our house because he remember me from the Caravan of Hope. He still lives in\nRochester. He's a great contributor to Israel. At that time I asked the elevator girl because that\nwas the only category I could afford to have maybe what she wears. If after work she can take\nme and I can get another blouse because I still have to go further. She said I can't go with you. I\nsaid is it because I'm Jewish. I said why. She said, because I cannot ride in the same bus that\nyou are. I said why not? She said, because I'm black. At that time I think, I'd like to go back,\nbecause there couldn't be anything worse at the time to go from one oppression and find that I\ncame to a country that is free and have that. Who's next I said to myself. That made a very big\nimpression on me and that's how I know I was in Atlanta. But nothing of that sort happened in\nSpringfield Massachusetts.\nQ. What was the Caravan of Hope?\nA. Caravan of Hope was primary to bring to the attention what happened with the Jewish\npeople and speaking about my , my experiences and for the Israeli soldiers or\nofficers to raise money for the UGA because a portion would be to save the children who came\nfrom Holocaust or other displaced families, and to raise money on all the stops. Then after I\ncame from Caravan of Hope, my husband at that time was just courting me, asked me if we can\nsee each other again. He's a very fine person, never never speaking about himself. That's when I\nmet his doctor McKenzie and he was just in the last year of radiology, a resident, a doctor came\nin and he asked Doctor McKenzie to look over the pictures, the x-rays and he said whatever\nDoctor Dorfman will say, that is the diagnosis, which I highly thought of. He asked me to go to\na dinner to his family. I told him, he asked me if eventually we can marry, and I said if your\nfamily wouldn't like me, I wouldn't marry you, because I really need a family. I meant it. So, we\nwent there. It was a nice apartment. The father worked at 70 years of age because he was a self\ntaught person to design dresses. They called him back at that age because he was so good, and\nhe always said to Mama, you wear this dress funny when I come home. It was a wonderful\nfamily, but when I came there once again, long hair I heard her brother, Uncle Abe saying, nice\ngirl, too bad she isn't Jewish. That followed me all the time. So, I opened the door, and I said,\nbut she 1s. He was just so happy about it. Then in 1949, Christmas day, a Professor\n, who still lives in New York City, who was the Chief of Radiology, lent us the\ncar and we went to Atlantic City, which was so called. Then he took a position in Des Moines\nIowa and that's where my both boys were born in a Methodist Hospital, and we had the\ncircumcision right there in the hospital because the family was so far away that nobody came for\nit. Then, my husband really wanted to be closer to the family and at that time -- I enjoyed Des\nMoines. There was a beautiful synagogue, a Reform, and there was evening sermons were very\nnice and educational. They spoke about everything and about the Holocaust, but then he was\noffered a position in New York City, which he didn't want to be in a big city not to raise the\nchildren there. Then there was a position in Rome, New York. We didn't know that Rome was\nhorrible at that time. I couldn't believe that I lived there. Then my cousin came from Paris she\nsaid this is a slow death. Why are you living here. We don't even have a movie. We have to\ntravel 20 miles to a movie. But a close knit family, and if you are part of the society or the\ncommunity then you grow closer. My husband was chosen among 14 other radiologist one of\nthem Jerry Segal, who 1s in Utica right now, and is glad that he didn't take it, because there 1s\nvery anti-semitic, a restricted golf club, and my husband never delved into what is going on, so\nwhen they proposed to him, he said fine I like to play golf but then when he found out that we\nwould be the only ones, he felt very bad. Later we learned that three voices were against only\nbecause he was Jewish and the vice president of the , Charlie Getty, who is a\nvery good friend of ours, said I will have to resign. Because if we can't have a fine person like\nMilt, we should be lucky that he wants to join. This is how I joined the Club,\nwhich I was the only one but at that time Rabbi, who is now living in Maryland, Rabbi Weimer\nsaid maybe there will be opening. But they until today they think Milt is Jewish and I'm not.\nAnd Joan, I don't want to talk about it. I feel that I'm still having problems with it because one\ntime I was asked what I am and then when I was Jewish that was no good. When I was non-\nJewish that was no good, so when they asked me I just said I believe that I do things other human\nbeings and that is the greatest religion what you can do, serve the fellow man. So, lots of people\nthink that I married Milt that he's Jewish, I'm not Jewish and I don't try one way or the other way\nto correct it. It's immaterial to me. Both my children were bar mitzvah, went to the Hebrew\nschool, and Gary right now I have two sons. One is Gary, one is Mitchell. They are also two\nyears apart. Both born in May. Gary is a professor of Radiology where he is lecturing at the\nMedical School at Brown and 1s chief of the department and that's also recently president of the\nCardiovascular Society for the whole United States and spoke recently in Sweden. But above\neverything, very good son. Mitchell is in New York. He's with the New York State Mental\nHealth and he is a psychologist. He got his masters and hopes one day to get his doctorate\ndegree. However, once again tragedy struck and we have been married 39 years and children\nstart to make preparation for our 40th wedding anniversary and on the fourth of July 1988, Gary\nand his family we pick them up at the Syracuse Airport with their little daughter who was 2 1/2\nor three years old and we went to our house. We had a wonderful Saturday, that same day. I had\nsome people for dessert in the evening, and my husband said, well it's late but we don't have to\nget up next morning, Sunday, so early. He never woke up. I found him sitting in his chair gone.\nEnd of Tape 2\nTape 3\nQ. Ava you were talking about the loss of your husband and how important he was to you.\nA. Well, he was not only a husband, he was a true friend and I didn't speak about my\nexperiences but only with Milt. He was a very kind and understanding person. I know that the\npatients former patients of his are still saying when Doctor Dorfman was here they must have\nthrown away the mold, how the saying goes. There isn't a kinder person that you can feel like at\nhome especially when you have radiology. You go into that big machine you need somebody.\nAt night evidently I had very bad dreams and sometimes I'd say don't let them take me. I had to\nexplain to him what I meant. But one time I think when Gary was around 17 or 18, he was just\nto graduate from high school, my husband was taken to the hospital with a heart attack. That\nwas the only one. He was on very minimal medications and everything was wonderful. As a\nmatter of fact, that fourth of July when the children came to visit us, Gary could not come very\noften because he is so busy. It was only because ten days later we were supposed to go to Alaska\nwhere I was taking a group of Senior citizens, and he and Doctor Brown who is on the picture\nwith with me and his wife were supposed to go together. Gary persuaded me that I\nshould take the trip in that short time because I didn't sit shiva. There was only one night and\nthey were laughing and making jokes, the man that supposed to get you out of --- I just couldn't\nstand it. I just said no. Mitchell had to go back to work and Gary stayed with me and then went\non the bus with me to Syracuse until he placed me on that plane. Of course I don't remember\nanything about Alaska. I cried and cried and Doctor Brown tried to give me some sedative and\nI'm anti-mediation so I just suffer without being calmed down. Every time they said you have to\neat something and I didn't. That's the time I lost 17 pounds which I never regained. It was a\nshock, just a shock because we were together and on Sunday just to find him just --- I took his\nhead and I said, we call each other babe, not Milt or Ava was not known and everybody called\nhim -- my cousin writes letters \"how 1s baby?\" So, I said babe you can take and I stopped\nbecause he was cold, and the friend of ours who is the publisher of the paper he still says he\nremembers when I said \"He's so cold, he's so cold.\" I was in shock. They didn't know if I'm\ngoing to get out, but they used to have a friendly poker game every Friday in the Sentinel which\nis our newspaper. When Milt died, they never resumed it. George Waters and Shirley said,\nGeorge doesn't face anyone without Milt. He was very recognized professionally. He was\npresident of the whole Society, not only locally but for the New York State. He was a very good\n, was a wonderful husband and friend, and a wonderful father. When you read the\nclippings, which maybe I left you, he did volunteer radiology for the DDSO, which deals with\nthe mental retardation and they provided a portrait of my husband. He looks exactly like the\nwrite up that Gary put for his obituary in the medical journal. It was a whole dedication with lots\nof friends invited and the mayor of our city, Carl Ilemberg said that he doesn't know in his\nhistory of serving everywhere he comes from Rochester that two people in the same family\nwould be honored because there was the dedication and the whole radiology department and the\nDDSO is Doctor Milton Dorfman. And of course, as you know, I think I mentioned one time to\nyou Joan initially when we spoke like a year ago, that when I saw the mistreating in the\nconcentration camp of the elderly in particular no mercy, and I was so close to my grandfather\nand grandmother, I said to God, whoever he was at that time, that when I survived the\nconcentration camp I will do something for the elderly and for the children, and I left you the\nwrite up. You'll see that I single handedly I was able to try to get and through\nsingly handed just raise 45,000 as a third of the whole payment for the land for the building, and\nthen Governor Rockefeller was then the governor and they asked me to speak about the aged. I\ndon't know if you ever heard of Monsignor Faye. He said for every President, Kennedy, Johnson\nand then Nixon as a member on the Committee on the Aging in Washington to the President. I\nknow Monsignor when he was Father Faye and when they called me for the Catholic charities in\nUtica that Rockefeller was going to speak, could I come and speak on the aged because I was\nsort of a pioneer in that area. I said not with Monsignor Faye. He's too knowledgeable and so I\ncame and he met me in the White House. I was delegate to the White House conference on\naging and I met him there. As a matter of fact, when we had the 25th anniversary of the Senior\nCitizen's Council and the movement in the room I called the University where he is\nthe President of the third world, and I said I would like to speak with Monsignor Faye, and he\nsaid who shall I say is calling, and I said he would not know me, but I would like to speak with\nme. So, he came to the telephone and he never said Monsignor, he said Father Faye and I said\nMonsignor you would not remember me he said \"Hello Ava.\" He said it there was 400 people\nwhich 1s a big beautiful place and he said how can we forget Ava. Then, just by the\nSenate and the Congress they proclaimed the whole day Ava Dorfman. I told Sheri Bolet who is\nthe Congressman you have to give me at 8:00 in the evening the day is almost over. I hope -- the\none thing I will say that God helped me to fulfill my promise, because I started just calling a\nmeeting of the retirees from the manufacturing from cable and I'll call and and\nit grew to 3,200 where I was 17 years the president and that was the time when my children were\n5 and 7. I drug them everywhere and every senior citizen was their grandma and grandpa. Asa\nmatter of fact, when I came one time to New York and Mitchell was already after college before\nhe got his masters, I said, Marie will be coming, Mother don't let her call me Mitchey. Surely\nenough she did. But I didn't give up lots of times that they could have spent with the children,\nbut I didn't play cards. I didn't go anywhere in the evening. I stayed at home. When they were\nin school and before they come to school we almost met because I tried to divide my time. At\nthe beginning my husband was the chief of the Radiology at Rome Hospital and then opened his\nown practice, so he was very busy. As a matter of fact, my husband was very understanding and\nany honors that were bestowed on me I always felt that he had to have a better part in it because\nnot many husbands would see that on Saturday and Sunday I cleaned the house and ironed\nbecause I didn't have the time to do it. There were others, United Way, Polio, Mother's March\nand for the children I established a speech therapy where the children from parochial schools and\npublic schools and the deaf school were coming and raised the money to pay the speech\ntherapist. But it comes back to you. One time my car was stolen and I had to call the Triple A\nand Mr. came and said Mrs. Dorfman we'll have to take that car to the shop and\nrecharge the battery. I said how will I get there. Oh, I'll get a ride. I'll come there. It was more\nthan the Triple A pays and I aid how much I owe you. He says nothing. He shows me a picture,\nlike a newspaper picture of a girl and he said you paid a lot. I said, how did I. Jackie was in\nyour speech therapy and she was stuttering and having a clef palate and you sent her to Kim\nJanet in Hunter New York. You have done wonders because she is now graduating from college.\nSo, there is you don't ask for rewards but whatever you do good to people it comes back and I\nfeel if my children, and I see them living by that example, and when I sometimes used to say to\nGary how come you're getting so late for dinner. Well, mother it would make you feel good. I\nwent to the ward where they are really forgotten elderly people and I just thought I'd see what\nthey are doing. I was happy. I was happy. My husband was also very active. He was the first\nchairman, president of the . He tried to be active, and most of all was very kind\nto the human race, and that is very important. His parents, when they printed the invitation for\nour wedding, they said the wedding of our children, the wedding of our children and my father --\nwhich I called him papa, was very nice when the neighbors asked him how is your daughter-in-\nlaw and he said I don't have daughter-in-law, I have a daughter. So, but now that Milt is gone,\nI'm taking a candle and going to the Temple when I get the announcement that there is the\nand I feel that they were close to me. There is still one sister, Blanche. Her\nhusband was a doctor in New York City and he died of cancer. I do come together. She came to\nthe funeral. And another son, another brother died so it's really Blanche only who 1s alive. I\ndon't know what to tell you else.\nQ. I have just a couple of questions from before. You mentioned that there was a particular\nroll call at the Yunaski camp with this little child?\nA. Yes. You see in the summer time when they called us out again sitting on that hot\nsummer day, they put buckets of water just for us to see but not to give us. We were so dry we\ncouldn't get anything. But they brought more people in from different areas and among them\nwas a child who was just crawling and the child doesn't know anything so she or he crawled to\nthat bucket and put his hands in and that SS or Gestapo, they're all the same, had a whip with\nleather fringes, and he kicked the child -- no kicked the bucket and the water just was out and I\nsaid, now that you've had your fun, can have the child have some water. He once again thought\nthat that was very brave and Jews wouldn't do that. Am I not Jewish and I said no, I'm not.\nHowever, they put the other bucket and the child crawled again and he kicked the child in such a\nway that we couldn't even look around because we couldn't turn our heads. Then he came and\nstruck me over my face and I had a big scar here. Now, I had the surgery I never know but\neverything happened on that side. It was not the strap but what he did. That is what I would\nalways remember. There were many other incidents too numerous to mention. I mean the\nhanging of the people or putting dogs, vicious dogs and seeing the flesh taking of the people. I\ndon't know. It was 20th century and the German people were supposed to be so civilized.\nWhere is the civilization taking us.\nQ. One last story. When you were waiting to come to this country, you were waiting for a\nship called the Lillymarlane?\nA. From . At that time there was a strike an they could not move the boat at\nthat time from Brenehauffer and other friend who came together at that time, Anna Novak, her\nhusband was an attorney and he passed away and she married a Doctor Heller, not the same\nHeller, and he's with the Northwestern Medical School. So is her son in the same place, and\nHenry her husband then said -- no they came and told us we have to clean the toilets because\nthat's where our buildings, our bunk beds because I remember that Anna and Henry were there, I\nwas here. They came and once again Germans clean the toilets and Henry went. He was an\nattorney. He went and cleaned for Anna too. I said I wouldn't do that, and the German looked at\nme and said yes you would and I said No I won't. Henry pleaded with me in Polish, you are so\nclose to a new life, don't be stubborn, go clean. I wouldn't. I just wouldn't. So, they took me to\nan office where there was other military person just with a shirt not with that straps and I told\nhim that I had to succumb to anything they wanted. After the war I don't feel like I want to do\nthat. He said, he looked at me, he sat there and looked at me and he said but don't you want to\ngo to America and start a new life. I said yes, but that doesn't mean that 1 have to clean the\ntoilets. He said I'm from Austria. They were not very much better, but I told him that I lived\nthere and he said, well, why don't you don that for me. I said I wouldn't do that for you. I\nwouldn't do it for me. He said, well it seems like you are determined. I will tell them that I have\na different job for you. I don't know what I did and Henry said she won once again. Well, won\nor not won, it was degrading to me after the war that they had to do once again that dirty job.\nBut, as they said when I came here it was not so easy neither because the cousin of my mother\nhad an aunt from his wife's side. We never knew and he was on vacation when I came. He came\nin July and he was with the children Sadell and Julius and he asked me to be with that aunt.\nVery uneducated and she had a daughter Molly and Molly came in and asked me how the dress\nlooks on her. I was always and I said not so good. They didn't know that in the\nUnited States you always say oh nice lovely and she felt that that was very offensive to her. At\none point she said, hatred did not do that to the Jews in the United States so it\nmust have been that God wanted it this way. Well, that was the end. I just took my things and\nfound out that the Doctor Heller from Vienna and Rudy were in the United States, and then they\nasked me come and live with them. From there when I started to work at Wall Street with the\nPolish bank I lived with a Jewish family. That's what I want to tell you about, Ann Remler,\nZigmund's sister. I lived on Ocean Avenue and I wore, -- I don't remember her husband's name\nbut she was Sophie and they were very nice. They had two boys and friends came and played.\nAt that time I made a promise to my sister's father --in-law. He had a daughter who studied\nmedicine in Vienna and I only know that she married an American medical student. I know that\nshe was Anna Silver, but I didn't know who she married. So when I was -- that was before I\nmarried my husband, but we were seeing each other. I went to the New York Times and spoke\nto a then reporter who was very known, Charlie Grutzner, told him that I'm looking for Anna\nSabol who married an American, at that time student and they're married and they live right here.\nThey are in psychiatry maybe. So, in Bellview Hospital some other doctor said, Anna I think\nthey are searching for you. She said maybe they're somebody crazy from Bellview and they\nfound out my name, but they came to the restitution office and we met. They were both\npsychiatrists and their two sons came to that people that I lived there. That's why I remember\nthere was a Time Magazine and they had an article just around the corner because they lived just\naround the corner. She asked me that she's very sorry that she would like to help me, to give me\nanything they wanted and I said no. You could have saved your family and maybe us, but you\nasked Zigmund only to come and leave Ruzia and her little boy alone and your family said Shiva\nand tore his garment and he wants you to know that. Then she called my sister-in-law Blanche\nhow she can get me. They tried very hard then I married and I said I don't want anything from\nthem. But one time I was maybe, a year ago, that's how I find I said to Mitchell\nin New York City, you know I wonder if she 1s still alive because she had a practice and this is\nthe time that we found in the telephone book . I said it doesn't say Doctor, so he\nsaid well why don't you call and ask, so he called and he spoke and they said yes, which Remler\nand he said Doctor Remler and he said who you are and he said I'll let you speak to my mother\nand that proved to me he was the brother of Doctor Remler, of her husband and I understand that\nhe was killed in an accident with his younger son and Anna since then has passed away, but they\nhave a son who is in William and Mary, a Professor and one is a surgeon in California\nsomewhere but I called that William and Mary and he told me that do you know that brother of\nZigmund Hiney is in Los Vegas. So, see what happens after 50 years.\nQ. You recently told, and we'll do this shortly, your son Gary about your first marriage.\nA. Gary visited me by himself without the family. I don't know how the conversation went,\nbut I didn't see too much of his daughter and I thought that Vicki herself could come sometime\nbut she's typical New England, very reserved and she doesn't feel comfortable to come without\nhim, and I said just to hold her in my arms and that's what brought out and I told him. I as a\nmother sense that it made adverse impression on him. Why didn't you tell us. I said that was a\ndecision between Daddy and I and I was only married seven months. I don't even know if I was\nmarried. It didn't make any impression. I didn't even have time to adjust myself. The child also,\nthree months, I just didn't and I thought you should know. I always thought I was the first born.\nI said you are of a lasting marriage of 39 years Gary and I spent so much time with you in\nsickness and in happiness and he said are you going to tell Mitchell. I said, with time, with time,\nwhen it's going to be the proper time. And I think I will do when I visit Mitchell at the end of\nthis month as I'm going to the Survivors of the Holocaust they are having gathering in New York\nCity. It's not going to be easy, and this is why maybe a whole year that you are trying to make\ncontact, I didn't want to say something that it's not accurate, and it will take me a long time to\nreturn to be half normal. I cannot ever be normal life. In the beginning we didn't have too much,\nbut then we're comfortable, and I still would not spend on me to buy a suit unless I'm pressed to\nit, but I would donate $5,000 to a cause if it would be for a good reason. It's hard when you eat\ndinner and remember my sister saying that she's hungry. You don't forget that. You can keep on\nthe bottom somewhere in your memory but it stays with you. Any my mother now that I'm\ndefinitely over 42 and I realize that 42 is very young, it's a young life and Ruzia never fulfilled\nher dreams neither and my uncles and aunts. I lost 58 with the immediate family not counting\nfarther relatives. lost her father even he obtained papers and went to practice in\nWarsaw as a Doctor Wosinski. It didn't help them. Her brother Karl, a medical student,\nhandsome as can be, shot on the street. Where do you draw the line. My other aunt who was\nmarried to Doctor . He was a lawyer. And his daughter who was so pretty, all\nvanished. all those people. They're just remnants of my memory but not\npeople. I don't think that I to the very last day of my life will ever overcome through it the\nHolocaust. But, as my son called me yesterday, \"Mother, do it. Tell the one that doesn't know\neverything. Do it. Tell them everything. Do it for us, the younger generation that they cannot\nforget it. That is should not happen again.\" Wouldn't it? I don't know. I am still scared. When\nI read and I do get and the Jewish publication and see what's going on on the\ncampuses, what's going on in Germany. As a matter of fact the orthopedist that I tried to find out\na day that the Germany invade Poland told me that he was to a meeting in Norway and an\northopedist doctor in Norway why you Americans so scared of Russians. Why aren't you scared\nof Germans. I was taken then to an underground you would not believe how much ammunition\nis there and how they greet each other. I said Andy, how heil Hitler so lots of things are going\non and people for sure are not more sympathetic than the Jewish people.\nQ. Well, Ava, thank you. I know how hard this was for you.\nA. I had to do it. Thank you for asking me, because I never will come on my own will.\nEnd of Tape 3\nTape 4\nQ. Ava, we have a few pictures, if you could please identify?\nA. This is my mother. Her first name was Sabina Muller. She was very beautiful and I lost\nher when she was 42 years of age, but that was before the war taken and given to me by an aunt\nfrom Warsaw. I didn't have any pictures. This is a picture that I believe it was taken while I was\nregistering as a Polish girl to work in Vienna because that blouse was given to me by a friend of\nmine, Wanda and that's the blouse that sustained me through the whole time during my working\ndays in Vienna. That is a picture that I think was taken while I was still working for that\nin Vienna because it's the same blouse. I hope that after the war I hope I\nacquire other blouse. I'm not sure even. This picture would be really the first one, because after\nthe war I was so eager to finish my education and there was the Academia and\nthey took the picture. Still the same famous blouse and I would say that that would be the first\none. If they came relatively in shorter time, it must be at that time taken. I came to Vienna in\n'43. The war was over in '45, so it had to be at that time.\nQ. This is the name that you took?\nA. That Rutkofska. Yes. I think does it say Stephanie there or maybe not?\nQ. Ava.\nA. Ava Rutkofsak. Well, maybe I dropped the Stephanie but in my papers I have Stephanie\nwhoever she was.\nQ. Thank you very much.\nA. You're very welcome. I'm glad it's over.\nConclusion of Interview\n"

        "Answer: Yes. I was born in 1920, the 30th of April in Poland. Then we lived\nthere for a while.\nQ. What was your name at birth?\nA. Ava Mueller. And I remember that one of the German Gestapo people when I came to\nconcentration camp asked me, you could not be Jewish because my name is Mueller, and I said\nmaybe I'm not, but it didn't help me too much. It shows you -- and even Jewish language is so\nvery similar to the German, so many names, so many words are the same.\nQ. What is your name now?\nA. My name now is Ava Dorfman. That is my husband of 39 years, and I lost him in 1988,\non July 3rd, suddenly, very suddenly.\nQ. You were born in ?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Did you stay there for very long?\nA. I suppose we stayed until a certain age. I think I went to public school, already to\nParochial at that time. There was a church with a parochial school near our house. I attended\nthere. Then my mother --.\nQ. Excuse me. Was that unusual for a Jewish person to attend that school?\nA. There were only two or three Jewish people in the area where I lived, so, we were really\nvery removed from the Jewish section of . Then, my mother had family in Vienna,\nso a portion of my life I spend there, and I lived on Liechtenstein Strauss in Vienna. Then, my\nfather's family lived in , and my mother felt that I and my sister Ruzia who was 2 1/2\nyears older than I, that we should somehow be closer to the family, to know our grandparents.\nShe did not have too much family in Poland or in Vienna of her close, and then we moved back\nto , where my grandparents own a building, four story, and my grandfather\nhad a restaurant, and they lived in the lower level, and then on the second floor, my mother,\nRuzia and I, you see when I was six months old I lost my father, so I actually never knew him.\nThere was just a study where there was a drawing, and that drawing was my father. There were\npictures that my mother always showed. He was 27 years of age and developed a severe case of\nkidney problems. He just got his degree in civil engineering. My mother was only 25, and they\nlooked forward but he didn't survive. So, between the draw and the cemetery that my\ngrandmother took us always, that was what I know of father. I didn't envy anyone that they may\nhave had more material things, but I envy everyone who was able to sit on the father's lap or get\na kiss from a father. That somehow I missed always.\nQ. What do you remember about your mother?\nA. My mother was very pretty, very educated. She spoke five languages. We were just --\nwhen we grow up we were like sisters, but when she was sometimes saying, I'm only 28 years of\nage, I said \"Well, you're so old.\" But we all do that, and she worked in the brewery, which was\nvery big offices, as an interpreter and also as a executive secretary to a director named Rightman.\nHe was Jewish, and then I understand from another friend, who is a gynecologist that the other\ndirector's son, Shal, was his name, is someplace in the United States, and then I was befriended,\nmaybe she was my best friend was Shisko. They were Czechoslovakian decent, and she and I\nwent together in school, and as I will tell you later on, she played a major role in my life. And\nmy mother worked there, and so it was a necessary that we were with the grandparents together\nand then above us was another aunt. She had four children. Marguerita was so pretty. They all\nperished. Then there was another aunt who was childless, and then she was\njust like a mother. She was battling a cancer in her larynx and that was the time really that she\nwanted to see that we would be married so she could see the weddings. I think that's what\nprompted one time whatever I will tell you about. What I would like to say that it is so hard\nsometimes to comprehend when people speak of six million, and also the fact that one million\nand a half were innocent children, does not say that we all were not just innocent, justly paid just\nbecause we were Jewish. The fact that everyone of the six million was a person with loved ones,\nwith friends, with dreams for the future, and then they had to face death by whatever means\nthose murderers had for them. They had a great many of them. Then, since you spoke with me\nand I really tried to search my mind. I must have really, like excavating the back memories from\nmy brain, and reach so many gruesome stories, that I tried very hard to suppress. I know that lots\nof Holocaust survivors share those gruesome stories with their children. I don't know what effect\nthat had on them, but before I got married in the United States, I decided if I ever have a family, I\nwould like to establish as a nearly normal life as it can be. I didn't want my children to be sorry\nfor their mother. I didn't want them to have the feeling that they are different from the other\nchildren, so I really was very evasive about it. The only thing at night, I had very bad dreams, as\nmy husband was telling me. I sometimes screamed or just said don't let them take me. So I\nshared lots of things with my husband, and not until the children were in high school and there\nwere many documentaries shown on T.V. and the newspapers and they always asked, \"Mom do\nyou know anything about it? Have you been there?\" And then little by little I would just tell\nthem, not very much. I have been asked by so many organizations to speak about my past. I\nrefused it. The only time I spoke was the Lutheran Church, and that was only because that the\nminister there felt that everybody who is not Lutheran is going to go to hell and of course, I just\nthought I'd tell them what hell really was. That's the only place I spoke. But, I feel right now\nthat even my children encourage me that I should give testimony. Just like my son called me\nyesterday and he said, \"Good luck Mom. I think you owe to the younger generation, because it\nshould never be forgotten what happened.\" I personally being so attuned to the anti-semitism\nwhich is going right now on, not only in Germany, France or England, but in the United States.\nI'm scared for the future generation because just like I hope that the Holocaust in Washington\nMuseum or any other Museums or Memorials which were erected in memory of the six million\nwill be able to educate the people what hatred and bigotry can do, and what they have done even\nto homosexuals and lesbians. They tortured them, and it was just because they had other sex\npreferences. We should let the people live for what they are, and therefore I feel that I consented\nto it. But I have to tell you that the last two weeks, I weighed all together 99 pounds, and I'm\npretty sure I'm down to maybe 80. I can hardly eat or sleep. It's hard for me to sleep. There\ncomes something that one son knows about and the other son still doesn't. When I was in Vienna\nI met many people, but one in particular was a medical student. He was like five and half or six\nyears older than I. He visited us when we went back to Poland. Then, as I mentioned, my aunt\nwho was childless, she was very eager to have a wedding, especially at that time, the rumors\nwhat was going on in Germany, because I think had in 1932 that Hitler started the revolution\nalready in Germany, and at one point I heard my family speaking, oh he's just a maniac. They\ndon't let him succeed. They will stop him. But how wrong they were. So, at one point, my aunt\nentertained that maybe we will get married. His family was not very well to do and neither was\nmine. He found a position in . was near\nwhich was a port, and in September of '39 the German invaded or bombed . This\nis the time that my marriage was of seven months only. That's why I do not have any\nrecollection. We hardly knew each other as a married couple.\nQ. How long did you know him before getting married?\nA. I think around four years.\nQ. What was his name?\nA. Edmond Spritzer (ph). When the German started to bomb , and they\nfinally marched in from , they start to round up the Jewish young men, able bodied,\nand that would happen with Mungio, and since then, I never saw him. I never had a trace of it\nneither. I have met any of his family members of his family. My cousin, who lives now in\nEngland, her son is by the way a member of the Parliament from Wales. They did not stay with\nJudaism, and he was born as a Episcopalian, but I don't blame them. There were many times that\nI didn't know what to do. If I were to have a family, I would not want them to be exposed to\nwhat I went through. She and her mother were visiting , and my mother by the\nway was visiting me, and the panic was so great because it was on the Baltic, . It\nwas a resort also. Everybody tried to get inland, and also reach their homes. What vividly\nstayed in my mind after searching my memory that I pushed my mother in through a window\nbecause the train was so jammed that she can go and also in some way was able\nto place her mother and then she and I stayed a while there. We didn't have any possessions\nthere, but when it start to be very bad, she was married around three years to\nDoctor and they were located where he practiced, and she and I decided that\nmaybe we ought to go to her home. That progressed so quickly. They started to bomb the trains,\nand we were just having the hardest time to go to Warsaw which was by plane maybe an hour\nand a half. It took us four days to go to Warsaw. When we came there, her husband\n, said, look they are already progressing here. They are vandalizing, even the\nPolish people vandalizing Jewish homes. I think it would be wise if you and Ava start to make\nyour way to . That's where her parents lived and my mother and Ruzia, and her father\nwas a very prominent oral surgeon, Doctor Katzner. It took us twelve days, ten or twelve days.\nEverytime the train was bombed, we had to jump, no matter how high the train was into the\nembarkment. We were bleeding all over. Our clothes were torn. We didn't have food. But\nwhen we stopped, there happened to be a little town. The people came out and said, what 1s\ngoing on. Tell us where they are, and brought some food out to us. When we find, as you know\nat that time the Germans invaded Poland there was the agreement between the foreign minister\nof Germany and who was the foreign minister from Stalin's, from\nRussia, from the Bog River east of the Bog River the Russians will invade that portion of Poland.\nThat of course was this camp \u2014\u2014\u2014.:~XSO when we made our way to , she was\nfinancially better situated so they lived in a completely different area, and I lived on the front\narea. As a matter of fact, when we were in Warsaw, they took only possession, a\nand it was lucky. That was the only thing we could cover ourselves at night, because we didn't\nhave anything else. I did not make a contact with her until after the war. I did not know what\nhappened to her. If you are interested I will tell you about it, but when I reach , my\nmother quickly put me into the basement because I don't remember if there were passports, or\nwere they some types of documents that they had to be identified by because the Russians went\nfrom one apartment or house to another to take a survey as to how many people are there. So,\nMother was afraid that they will arrest me because I was the newcomer and they were already\nthere. So, through the contacts of my sister's husband, who was . She was\nalready married, he was a mathematician and he was working, help the Russians, and he was\nable to get some papers. I don't know what they said. I know that I was able to come out. That\ntime, the Russians confiscated lots of factories and took us to work, but I didn't feel good. I felt\nthat I was lightheaded. I was sick to my stomach and did not know maybe malnutrition or\nwhatever and Poland and that time was already socialized medicine. I went to see a doctor and\nfound out that I was two or three months pregnant. I don't even remember. To this day, I don't\nknow how the pregnancy was not interrupted from jumping so many times. Sometimes we had\nto jump every fifteen minutes because the train was so terribly bombed, and I just was pregnant.\nMy grandparents were still alive at that time. My grandfather in particular was religious. My\nmother was very much for aborting the child, but my grandfather felt no. So, I still was working,\nnot too much food to begin with, and my sister was working, but she was still living with her\nhusband, more near which was more of a Jewish section. She played beautifully\npiano, and her desire was one time to become maybe a pianist. I don't remember if she already\nhad her son, Gaynish, but I know when the German came he was around a year and half out, so I\nwill have to calculated it back. Everything is just like a bad dream. However, we were working,\nand I think I worked until my eight months, very hard because they did not let us stop. I don't\nrecall what we were doing, but I do recall that there was like a quota. If you didn't make so\nmany pieces in one hour, they will push you to a very bad job, sometimes cleaning the worst\ntoilets that you can imagine. So I was very, very pressed, and not feeling well. I was rushed out\nto a hospital to deliver, and she was a beautiful -- her name was Lydia. She was like 2 1/2\nmonths old and everybody thought she looked like an angle, but somehow, due to the milk, there\nwas not a formula or anything. Nothing was sterilized, she developed dysentery, like a very bad\ncase of diarrhea, and the doctor hospitalized her. I went every day to the hospital after work, and\nthey showed me through a window because they felt it was a communicable disease. But one\nday I came and they didn't show her and they say she's dead. That was I think she was only three\nmonths or three and a half months old. That took lots and lots of maneuvering really to get the\nbody out so we can bury her near my father, so she wouldn't be alone. That was the end of that.\nBut the Russian was not very easy to live under either. They just unannounced would knock on\nthe door, came and took whatever they liked. My mother had some nice china and they wanted it\nso it was not even would you give me. I remember being just so attached to the drawing that that\nwas my father and never knew him, but from the pictures sometimes he stood at the foot of my\nbed and I could visualize him and I was a fan of his that he had a very nice\nand of other literary writers and philosophers like Hiner Shuller, a\nman, and I thought one day I will have it in my home. Well, it stayed there until the Germans\ncame, but then they raped also some people-- the Russians. They also came and tortured you\nthat tomorrow they come and they emptied out, but mostly they were like and when\nthey find our watches they just have like five watches on one hand and the other, they never had\nthose things. Or they took a nightgown from the women and just wear it as a dress. They were\nvery primitive. My mother felt that they interfere a lot in the war of and when we\nheard that eventually maybe the Germans come, my mother said, \"It couldn't be worse.\" But\nonce again, she was wrong. At least we were alive. Now, I spoke to a friend of mine who was\nvery young when he left Poland. He's an orthopedist in our town, and I spoke to Andy Solenski,\nand I said, for some reason as a matter of fact the night before I came here, I said Andy for some\nreason I feel that the Germans attacked Russia and forced themselves into our territory that there\nwas in 1939 -- excuse me in 1941 that it was in June, because I remember that was my sister's\nbirthday, and my mother baked a cake and asked and the little boy who was\nalready alive, to come and stay with me. That same night we heard shots and commotion and we\nrun to the window and we saw the Russian soldiers running with mattresses under their arm and\nwe knew something is brewing, and that's how the Russians went out, because the Germans\ncame in. Then, the other set of problems started. We were in our apartment still and I failed to\nsay that my grandparents had a very hard time when the Russians were there. When they got\ndrunk they came to the restaurant and sometimes with the bottles of liquor stayed and everything\nthey would just push everything on the floor and just destroy it. They took it very hard that they\ncould not operate and support the whole family. My grandmother took very ill and within one\nweek of each other, they passed away. My uncle who was my father's brother, , his\ndaughter is my cousin who lives in Paris, Nira, and is married to a non-Jewish, but non-believer\nreally, a Parisian artist. She has a son Stephen and his wife Marie-Noell and they visited\nMitchell and I here last year, and he continued to operate the restaurant and we still lived in that\nhouse the whole family together. But then they established a Ghetto and they start to line up the\npeople and we had to leave everything behind, and my that I somehow thought I\nwas going to have that from my father, and we moved and I don't remember the street. There\nwas a big building with lots of stories, three or four stories. We moved to an apartment where\none and a half rooms, two families lived. My mother and I. Ruzia was still there, and another\nfamily with three children. It was very hard. But when the Russians left, , who\nwere very religious. The father had a beard. The mother had a . I don't know what\nitis in English. A wig? I see. They had a daughter who also by coincidence her name was\nRose. Now, today, I think it is multiple sclerosis. She was unable to walk. She was bedridden,\nand the father of Zigmund encouraged Zigmund that still going back to the Russian occupation,\nencouraged the boys, there was Zigmund and two brothers. One of them now a year ago\nestablished contact with me , who by the way told me he saw my sister's\nhusband Zigmund after the war in Russia. He encouraged him to make his way to Israel, but he\nknew he left my sister and a little child, and he told him he's going to try to reach .\nEvidently he never did, because cannot put traces or find him, and never reached us.\nWhatever, we were not there to begin with. Then his father encouraged us to come and live in\ntheir house because they had a little house, like four rooms. And it was once again, very hard to\nget milk or bread or anything and he was going courageously out trying to get something for his\ngrandson. One time when he left he never came back, so when asked me what\nhappened to my father, the only estimate I could say that they caught him or shoot him. I don't\nknow. Then the mother did not know what to do with her daughter Rose, and I think she lost her\nmind. She was just going around the streets and screaming, and they must have shot her because\nshe never came back, and here I was with Mom, myself, and then Ruzia was at that time, and\nZigmund was already in the Russian Army and when the Russians were moving away when the\nGermans came, they followed the Russian army and that's why he felt then it would be better to\nhave the German people come. We had both of the atrocities, and before we moved in with this\nother family, when I said that we lived in that building that had few stories, it's hard to believe\nhow many people jumped to their death from third or fourth floor. I remember one prominent\ndoctor who did it with his wife together because they didn't want to face what can happen to\nthem.\nQ. Was this when the Germans came?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Did you see them?\nA. Yes. So, that's why when you asked me to do that, after 50 years, which 1s a half century,\nto really delve into my memory things that I try so hard to suppress, it was very hard for me.\nThen, we didn't have any money, and we didn't have any means to support ourselves and there\nwas already the Germans. I was wearing an arm band with the Star of David and J, Judea. I took\noff my arm band. I was very blonde, long hair, they say blue eyes. I always thought I have\ngreen eyes, and I went to the other side to the brewery, and tried to bring beer, bottles of beer. It\nwas very small, but I still feel that my wrists were very very affected by it. I had surgery here\nand carpal tunnel, and I just went back and forth and sold the beer to the people who had money.\nMama was able to get a bushel of flour and make something to eat for us. Then the Germans\ntook over the factories the same that the Russians had, and we start to work there again. But\nRuzia was designed to clean the streets, so she came a few times. She was so delicate, so very\npretty, and she said as long as the child is here, and we took care as best we can. Mother didn't\nwork anymore, and the brewery was taken over by the Germans. One day she just didn't come.\nOne day just like the next day maybe came a Polish man. He was a conductor of a trolley, and\nhe knocked on the door and he asked for Ava and I said I am Ava, and he said that my sister is\ngoing to be taken to Auschwitz and she's so hungry. She would like to have a piece of bread. I\nasked him where they are going to march the whole group of people, and he told me. I took my\narmband off and went on the other side and stayed there while they were walking. The men\nlooked like skeletons and they even picked up anything that was on the street. Sometimes I\nwonder if it was even something from animals, everything. I saw Ruzia and I just run out and I\ndon't know, there was a Ukrainian or some German Gestapo took my arm and they said\nand I said no, I'm Polish. I throwed the bread to her and she said please take\ncare of Gaynosh. I never saw her again. Then usually the German people used the young Jewish\nboy as the hatcher man. They were always the ones to select somebody or to take them\nsomewhere and I know then from before or from school or something that we did together and at\nthat time when it started to be so bad and one time I worked at the factory and there were\ndifferent rooms and then I heard screaming like agony screaming, and I opened the door and\nthere was a girl -- I don't know if she was 16 or 17, and she was profusely bleeding like you\nwould think somebody had menstrual bleeding. She said, they raped me with the foot of the\nstool. Then I heard other screaming and then a Polish superintendent of that factory came over\nand grabbed me by the hand and he pulled me down to the basement and that's how I got\nacquainted with the basement. Then, at that time, I know I have to do something with Mom and\nGaynosh. I asked -- see in the Ghetto there was like a you have to go through a gate where there\nwere Germans and Ukrainians and the Jewish who were sort of going back and forth, the young\nmen. At that time, I asked then if there was any possibility that I can get Gaynosh out of the\nGhetto. They said how, and I said we just put something in his mouth and see and I spoke with\nthat Sishko, that from brewery, the director, and I was such a close friend with her, went together\nwith her to school. I told her that I would like to Gaynosh to her aunt who was without children.\nMaybe she will raise him. She said let me talk. Then when I came for the beer and she said try\nit. I told her what day that would be and so with the armband -- you know there is like a wagon\nthat you sit higher up and when you take the seat there is like a compartment and the baby was\naround here and maybe in three months over a year I remember and just prior to the gate I\nstuffed a little hanky in his mouth and then they stopped us and they said and I\nsaid I have to testify because I saw some Jewish people doing something wrong and they take me\nto headquarter. When we reach the other side, they couldn't go near the brewery, but they left\nme off and I held a shawl over my head and the baby and somebody from the back stopped me\nand I said \"yeah,\" and he said where are you going and I said home with my baby. Who are you,\nI say Iam Polish. What is your religion? I said catholic. That's what I don't know so many\nthings I was able to get away. I don't know how. I placed the baby at that time with them with\nthe understanding that after the war somehow somewhere I will get the baby. Can I retreat?\nWhen I was in the house of , | had the baby and my mother and oh, by the way one\ntime they come in the Germans and that one that was bedridden and just took her\nout like a piece of garbage, and she was gone, which was a blessing. Really, I could not lift her\nevery day there was only me and Mom. There was no real life for her, but in this\nhouse I didn't know it, but the neighbors who lived there for so many years, they know each\nother. One time a Jewish family came and said, you know there is a door in the floor going to\nthe cellar. It was flush with the floor, but there were steps going down where evidently they\npickled something for the winter, whatever. It was like storage room. Could we hide? Well,\nthey said if they catch us, we're all going to be dead. Well, it got so bad that they started to\nround up people and take them out to the concentration camp, I had 15 people in that cellar\nincluding my mom and Gaynosh. That was before. There was a bed and I seen him sitting there.\nThey came, not only that they came, 15 people, but there three children in the age of five to\nmaybe nine and I was so afraid that they may cry or say something loud. So, I was upstairs and\nfour or five Gestapo men say , everybody , and I said in German,\nthere is nobody here, just me and my child. He said you go here you go there and they stuck the\ntop on the thing and for me to tell them downstairs to sit quiet, I said, but there is no one here,\nbut there is no one here. There was silence and then when the Gestapo grabbed Gaynosh and I\nsaid please don't do nothing to him and the other one said, let him sit we come some other time.\nThen he said are you sure you're Jewish. I said maybe not, but it didn't help me too much, but\nthen he threw an apple, I thought he was going to kill the child, that was a good gesture, and\nsome candies and they left. I asked once again, what a miracle. Then when I took out Gaynosh,\nI placed my mother with a neighbor that we used to live way back where my grandfather's house\nwas. We didn't have much, but mama had such small little diamond earrings that evidently my\nfather gave her when they were married. Don't forget that Ruzia was 2 and a half years older so\nthey had some time together. I think her two rings and she wanted me to take it so I can survive.\nThey say no, I want you to have that. Maybe at one time they will ask you to do that so they can\nbuy food. So we made like a pouch in her dress that she had. We couldn't take too much with\nus. There were only two dresses that each one of us had and we sewed it underneath and that\nwas what I left her. My heart was somehow easier because I took care of that. Then, that didn't\ngive me too much time to really do something for myself. We were just taken in big cattle\nwagons in the concentration camps. So, I found myself there towards the end of '41, 42, and\nwhat one saw in that concentration camp, it's really better to repress that. One time, of course\nthey had I think it was recreation for them. Every time at night which were just bunk beds, no\npillows, no sheets, no nothing, you just lie there, and roll calls. When it was snowing or raining\nor thundering that you put your feet like that and sit with your head down and then they would\nwith the rifles would point out you go to your right, you go to your left, you go to your right.\nYou never know which one side is better. Then one of them was to be just get away in some\nmeans. Sometimes they called it twice a night and then you had to get up at 5:00 to go to work.\nThen they would give you soup which you could find nothing in it. One time they put us there to\n-- let me say, when you came there, they shaved everyone.\nQ. This is ?\nA. Yanosko, Limberg. They shaved us and then you hear this screaming because they asked\neverybody to open their mouths and they have like gold crowns, they just knocked it out, which\nwas terribly painful. They just undress us. Men, women, children. It was almost unhuman.\nThen they pushed us to different barracks and when evening or at night when they built a fire and\nthere like a which was like a heap and then they put a big fire and while we were\nsitting there, you could see the fire. It was not a recreational fire, it was quite a large area and the\nflames were going up and with their rifles they were pointing to people giving them instructions\nto dress, to undress, whatever there was, one gown you were wearing and to throw himself on the\nburning. There was a mother and a daughter sitting near me. I don't think the daughter maybe\nwas 14 or 15 years of age. He pointed out only to the mother and when the mother was still\nundressing, the daughter quickly got up and undressed and followed her, and many others\nperished the same way. Sometimes they would take us out and they would have those vicious\ndogs and when they found out that somebody was a rabbi, I remember one was a priest even who\ntried to hide the Jewish children, and pushed the dogs and you could see how the flesh was\ncoming off these people. Sometimes they hang the people and the Jewish boys who were in\ncontrol. I don't know if they could say no, sometimes I feel, and they were hanging there for us\nto see and then the Gestapo would say, you are the next. Just torturing, torturing us. One time in\nthe roll call order were young people and the older people were sitting and the Ukrainian took --\nher name was Bosha, took her out and we thought maybe he was going to save her, but when she\ncame back she said he raped me and then he came and shot her. I had all her blood, you could\neverything from her brain. He shot her right here in the head. How can you have a very normal\nlife when you think of that. One time I was selected to well asked to go and sort the clothing of\nthe people who they still round up from different places. That was the only time that I had done\nthat. That was the time that I found my mother's dress. I found the pouch. Of course there was\nnothing in it and I asked everybody if they came across Sabina Mueller and I looked at\neverybody who marched out to work. So, I don't know if they found her where she was hiding or\nif she was there and I never saw her because when I talked to my cousin in Paris, she was like 15\nyears younger than I, Mira said before I went to Auschwitz I was in Limberg and never saw her.\nIt was a big camp. At that time there was a Gestapo man who we know that he is sadist. He was\nchoking people, especially young girls. One time he selected me to work in his house to clean\nhis house. His house was like a stone away from the door that rifles and Gestapo and everyone\nwas watching when the people are going out, but the women were not going out anymore. So,\none time, around that time, we were selected to help the men dig trenches, and they said, this is\nnot deep enough. The men were like skeletons, no food nothing. Then once again, right, left,\nright left. Then they put the men facing the trenches and then the music played, famous\nand the . That's how they buried the people or tortured them and\nthe squadron shot the people, sometimes not enough to kill them and then they order to bury\nthem. And you can hear the voices, help me help me and they were just buried alive. That time,\nI made up my mind if they shoot me that's okay. I spoke to the young man that you used to go\nwith women and men out to the factory to work. His name was Jacob. I said, you're coming to\nthat house where I work for that Gestapo. He never talked to me, he just said pointing that's not\nclean enough, but he never did anything to me. He never gave me food neither. But, this Jacob\nused to come and bring some cans of milk, which we didn't have it. I said do you think you can\ndream up a pair of pants. I would like to escape. I have a nephew. I have to take care of him. I\npromised my sister. He said gosh I don't know how I can do it. I said you bring that in a basket.\nEverybody is taller than you Ava. I said I will round it up, don't worry. If they shoot me, they\nshoot me. I have nothing to lose. And one day he did it. He said 5:00 you have to drop into that\nrow of people and just walk. Of course I did not look very much like a man, and maybe my walk\nwas funny, but we were almost to get into the trolley when they start, \"halt, halt\" and they\nrecognize. I jumped into the trolley and the conductor refused to stop. He saw that I was\nescaping and he went. Later on I have learned that he was shot because he come minus one, that\nJacob. He was shot. It was also hard for me to live with that he somehow did it for me and he\nwas not able to survive. That time they went to that factory where I sometimes went to the\nbasement where the women work before, remember I befriended myself with that\nsuperintendent. I went in that basement all alone. I heard the voices. I bet they were rats. I was\nso scared, but my head was shaved. I couldn't go out, and I stayed there until they left that\nbuilding, which was around 4:00 and I knew there was a telephone in some room. I quickly\nwanted to call Sishka and I said I escaped. She said My God, am I going to take you. You're\ngoing to have to wait. I don't want to tell my mother. Maybe Stashu, her brother, will somehow\npick you up and bring some clothing. Then I heard steps, and my heart stopped and that was the\nsuperintendent. He said what are you doing? I said I escaped, can you help me and he said my\nwife is not going to do that. Let me talk to her. He talked to her and she said here is soup. Eat\nthe soup and go. Where would I go? Go back to the cellar. Let me just use your phone and I\ncan tell her where Iam. She did that, gave me a scarf so I can cover my head and then sometime\nit was very, very dark that they came and I jumped into there. They couldn't take me to their\nhome. They placed me in a shack and they brought me some food. I think I stayed there for\nalmost three and a half weeks, until my hair grew to something like you have, so I can go out.\nSometime very late at night they would let me take a shower and that was a blessing.\nEnd of Tape 1\nTape 2\nQ. Before we go on, I want to go back a little bit.\nA. All right.\nQ. When you saw those people committing suicide, jumping out of -- did you ever think to\nyourself that you wanted to commit suicide?\nA. Not then. Not then. Suicide no. I just didn't care. When my mother and Gaynosh were\ntaken there was a time when I didn't care. Only when I found mother's clothing and I knew that\nshe was no longer alive, then I had that great desire to fulfill my promise to my sister. Because\nwhen they took her to Auschwitz and I threw that bread if she caught it or not I will never know,\nand shear miracle that that Ukrainian or German let go of my arm and didn't pull me together\nthrough that marching group, I felt, I have to fulfill my promise to her. Suicide no, I'm just not\ngeared to it.\nQ. Were you afraid of being raped?\nA. Yes, that I was. And by a very great miracle, even later on when I was in Vienna, where\nI will tell you from the point when I enlisted remind me to tell you about a very close call to rape\nand I will touch on that. I'm trying to do it sequence as possible. Have you have any other\nquestions?\nQ. Yes. When you were escaping --\nA. From the concentration camp?\nQ. From the concentration camp, but I want to ask you both about the escaping about taking\nyour mother out, about taking Gaynosh out. It seems very brave to think about going outside and\ntaking the chance?\nA. It was not so brave. There was really guts and the will to do that. I was bringing really\nincome to the family by going everyday out to the brewery, taking my armband. Good, I was\nblonde and blue eyes as they say, but nevertheless it was going out, facing -- it was like two\ndifferent cities. Ghetto was all Jewish the other side was not. That was taking a chance.\nWalking through the streets and seeing them marching and looking at you and pretend that you\nare just hah-hah and you just smiling good day. That was brave. But then when they took my\nmother out, I didn't do it by myself because there I have the help once again of the Jewish boys\nwho also took mother out to Gestapo headquarters and then she was going out to our area where\nwe lived. That was brave because where my father lived, we were known there. Where my\ngrandfather lived, we were known there. She was there I don't know how long, but 1t must have\nbeen at least to that year that I found it unless they kept the clothing that long, but that was in the\nbeginning of 1943.\nQ. How did you go out everyday, through the gate?\nA. No, through the other street that was just a hole and I was just making my way out\nbecause there was no wire in the Ghetto. There were just streets. If you knew the area you could\njust try to get out, and that's how I went almost every day.\nQ. Were you afraid?\nA. Yes, yes. Because I wanted to go back. As said, my cousin from England,\nmy mother always said Ava is so brave. That was under good circumstances. Until today, I am\nthe do gooder, always for other people. I do it today, too. I think that's my nature, but then my\nmother was a widow. We didn't have money, and she was working, and she was very active in\nan orphanage house. Her name was on the orphanage house, so every time when she was saying\nto us, to both of us, if you feel that you are deprived, just look at the children who are much\nworse off, and then you see how lucky you are. Then, I said, well, how lucky we are. But then I\ndid the same thing with my children when they didn't eat, I would just say, see you don't finish,\npeople in Europe would give anything for crumbs, and Mitchell was always joking and he said,\nmother, pack the crumbs and send them. But both of them grew up to be very charitable. I\nremember we were in New York and walking through the streets there was a man without feet\nand a beggar and Mitchell said can I have my advance 25 cent allowance. I'll pay you back, and\nthen he went and gave to the man. You live by example. You live by example, and therefore I\nfeel that the children, whether it be German or Polish or Lithuanian, they don't grow up with\nprejudices. They're taught. They're taught, therefore, I feel that really the United States\nHolocaust in Washington or any other museums are memorials that were erected in the memory\nof this six million will somehow educate the people and let them know what hatred and bigotry\ncan do. Not only to a group of Jewish people, but it could be an individual what they have done\nto the homosexuals or lesbians or to any other group. One day they may turn because they are\ncatholics, but I think I always think that Hitler couldn't do those atrocities by himself. He got the\nmasses to follow him. That is the tragedy. How blindly people follow. One, it be crazy or\nirrational and do what is absolutely against any principle to being a human being. This is what is\nhard to understand for me. Do you have any other questions. Maybe I didn't make myself clear.\nQ. I'm interest to hear a little bit again about your escape from camp on the\ntrolley. I don't quite understand how you got away.\nA. Well, when you asked me before did I care or was I scared or did I have any reason or\nwould I like to live. That was the time that I felt that I would like to fulfill my promise to my\nsister Ruzia. I had a desire to escape, and in that time, no, I wasn't scared. If they would have\nshot me in my own heart I know I placed Gaynosh and I placed my mother. I didn't know what\ntheir fate was going to be at the end, but at that time I felt good. When I was working for that\nGestapo who was that sadist cleaning his house, and then I had to go to the barracks. I didn't\nstay, but I came there almost at 4:00 to his house. 4:00 in the morning, without any food, and\nwhen I spoke to that Jacob and I told him just drop me off some pants. I cannot go in a dress or\nskirt because there was just that outfit. When he brought that, he said you will have to fall in at\n5:00 and march with the men, but you are so short they're going to spot you. I said don't worry,\nif they shoot me, they shoot me. Don't worry. Just give me a chance. There was a big gate, and\nthere were dogs and people with rifles to shoot when they didn't like somebody. Maybe\nsomebody looked very fragile and they didn't let them go. They just pulled them out and shot\nthem right there. This we saw too. Then everybody tried to stand up straight so they still with\ntheir last breath of their strength could go out. I marched in and tried being short to get closer\nand closer to the first, second row and then just outside the gate was the trolley that took them to\nthe factory. Then, when I started to walk faster and faster, someone of them spotted me, and\nthey started to \"halt, halt, stop, stop, stop.\" Nobody stopped. They were marching and I quickly\nrun into the trolley and said to the conductor. I'm escaping and I'm not even Jewish, I'm Polish\nand I'm trying to escape because they took me by mistake, because I didn't know what the Polish\nperson was thinking of the whole story neither. So, I said they shaved my head and I have to go\nand find my family. When they came almost very close to the trolley all the men were there and\nhe took off and they were shooting and he said, I don't stop, I go. He said in Polish\n, we go. But unfortunately later on I know that they shot that Jewish younger\nman, that Jacob because first of all they know that a woman was in his group, and also that he\ncame minus one. So, I lived for a while with that guilt too, and when you start to think about it,\nwhich I don't want to think about it, you have a very guilty feeling. Even now that we were in\nthe beginning, well, it still didn't come to the marriage, so I'll tell you that later. If you have any\nquestions going back, I'll continue.\nQ. Go ahead continue on when you were hiding.\nA. All right. I was there in that shacks, two shacks, like I have one now in my own house.\nThey brought some food when it was very dark, because they still don't know -- there was a\ncluster of homes of the directors, the higher ups lived on that area. Higher ups like the directors\nof the brewery and things like that. They didn't know what is going to happen. But when I came\nthere, my feeling was I'm going to see Gaynosh, and I said where is . Oh, they\ndidn't want to stay here because they were afraid of the Germans and they went to\nCzechoslovakia, and they took Gaynosh with him. Gaynosh is Gershin named after my father\nlike my son Gary is always named after my father. Then she told me that after the war I can find\nher, which I will tell you what I did after the war. I stayed there I think to my best recollection of\nthree and a half weeks, to gain a little hair and then one day came and said you\nknow what, I spoke to Wanda she's in and she and Peter are working in the\nunderground. They are helping lots of Jewish people and also bombing the bridges so the\nGermans cannot go from one side to another. They said that you should make your way to\nbecause lots of people registered as Polish to go to Germany or Austria. Of course, I\nwanted to go to Vienna because I knew so many people. In that time, I just once again, took a\nchance and went to by train. Somebody could recognize me. That's that famous\nblouse that you have the picture that gave me, and one skirt and that 1s all that I\nhad. I registered. I had to wear an armband that said P \"Polish.\" They asked me if I would go to\nBerlin first, and I said no, can I go to Vienna, Austria, preferably Vienna. Of course you could\nspeak like a Polish. You could not speak like a Jew. The Germans said do you speak German\nand I said yes. I went to work in Vienna. is -- have you ever been in Vienna\nJoan? You know where the , Just on that street, which you come out and you\ncross the , which 1s just like Fifth Avenue in New York. Then you have that\n. This is where . There was a Nazi. What was his first\nname? Adolph, Adolph Shiltz. Maybe he still exists, and the Gestapo and the SS, Storm Fuhrer\ncould not bear to have shirts with machine made button holes. They had to be hand made.\nThat's what we did. We found by midway there was five of us who registered in different areas.\nBut somehow we find ourselves working for that Mr. Shiltz. My name is --- I'm still in\n. I lived longer -- excuse me, I retract, I was in living\nwith my girlfriend Wanda and Peter and they asked me if I would like to work with them\nunderground. I said I cannot take the chances. I wanted to see Ruzia's son and I would rather go\non and work. So, my hair grew like that and I had nice hair. You have a picture of that, and\nthat's how I register. I always had a nice smile. My mother said, the only nice pretty things that\nI have was my teeth and my eyes and they did not even want to put a filling in my teeth. There\nwas a Polish girl in Vienna. They just pulled the teeth, which I lost three on that side, two on\nthat side. It was a little better treatment. They didn't kill you, but it was not easy to live and to\nbe somebody else.\nQ. What was your name?\nA. Ava Stephanie Rutkofska. And Peter gave me those papers, but my birthday was the\nsame. When I left, I have a picture with Peter and myself. I will make a copy and send you that\nbecause he really helped me out. I don't know where he is now. I start to write but nothing.\nThen, I came to that Mr. Shiltz and also they washed the laundry there for those Gestapo. So,\nthere were baskets that we had to cross the and go to that Weinberger and I\nwas so ashamed to just carry that dirty laundry there. There was a Yugoslavian. He was always\nin civilian clothes. I really don't know what he was, but he was influential, and knowing that I\nwas Ava, he always called me Avasha, and he always said how pretty Iam. He said, it seems\nlike I see that you are ashamed. Let me take one side of the basket and carry it with you. He\nwas very instrumental later. This is what it was. So, we had like iron \u2014\u2014_\u2014saa very mediocre\npillow one thin blanket and one was scared of the other. All girls, are you going to church, are\nyou going to say novena. Are you going to the evening services, and yes, of course. And one\nwas watching the other how we are crossing ourselves only to find out that all of us were Jewish.\nIt wasn't easy. We all had a shelf were we had our underwear and the blouse, the one blouse I\nwashed every day and ironed. And working for that Adolph Schiltz, he always tried -- he\nsomehow took to me, his wife too and those two children and the little one. He said\ncome in here and I said yes. Do you know what the word is. You never heard of\nthat. Then there were other Jewish expressions and I said how would I know that. Well, aren't\nyou Close to the Jewish people. I said, well they could be my neighbors but they did not know\nthe language. Then that man that I worked for that sadist one day he came in 1944. He came in\nShiltz, Heil Hitler and of course he was such a Nazi and I don't know how I possibly put my head\nso deep down that he doesn't see me. Maybe he would not even recognize me. I had hair and\nlooked different, but I thought my heart stopped. He was talking about us, Shiltz, with him,\nbecause they were looking at our side. I couldn't say anything to the girls because I didn't know\nthey were Jewish. So, they say, is something wrong. I said no I just see that 1S\nhere. I wonder what he wants. Maybe he 1s looking for Polish girls because Mr. Shiltz talks to\nhim. IfI get nervous I talk. As you know, I told you that, and finally he was going like toward\nus, but there was a little T.V. and that was the time that the Germans had lots of trouble in\nRussia. As a matter of fact, one of the Jewish girls, the only one I don't know her name, she was\nfrom Lodz of course in the Irish papers she was Marisha, but what I understand her brother was a\nfamous Jewish historian. I don't know her name and she was singing or reciting the\nyou know, backwards. March, march forward and then backwards. Maybe\nshe expressed herself that way before really it was peace, and they took her and she vanished the\nlast days of the war. However, they looked on the T.V. and I did not know there was a little T.V.\non the shelf and that's where he stopped so they didn't reach us. It's another miracle.\nQ. You mean they had a surveillance camera of some kind?\nA. Just a T.V., but he didn't want us to know that the Germans were having problems in\nRussia and they're trying to withdraw. Remember the time that they were having problems. You\nknow, we have like rations, it's what they're known here as stamps, but we could by some food\nfor it. One time I went to restaurant which was a cafe house and I had my P, my armband, and I\nalways was aware of it that people may recognize me because I used to live in Vienna. There\nwas a woman, I can see her like today, a black hat a black turtle neck. She was just like you bury\npeople. All in black. And she was looking at me and looking. I couldn't swallow. I had a cup\nof soup, and I couldn't hardly swallow. She just have noticed my uneasiness and finally she\ncame over and she said, hello. She said, are you hiding. I said no, I'm working here, a Polish\ngirl. Where are you working? I say ina German place. She said, you can tell me, are you\nJewish? I said no, and she said you can be honest with me. I would like to help you. I watched\nyou. I must have been in the restaurant before. You always have the same outfit. Can I buy\nsomething for you, and I said, that's the end. She must be from the German Gestapo. I said, I\ndon't accept anything from people. She said, what's your first name? I said Ava. Ava, ah,\n, | said Ava, I'm Polish, and she said, confide in me because I will confide in you. I\nam Jewish. My husband was not. That's why we don't live together, not to bring harm to him,\nbut I have a son I wish you could meet him. His name is Eric. I said I cannot date anybody\nbecause that's against the rules. Well, where are you working. I said not ar away from here and\nshe just extracted from me and I said , and she said I give you the address. I\ndon't have a telephone. You can call me. I said I don't have a telephone where we live. One\ntime, at work, a German there always were Germans, SS or Gestapo coming came a very\nhandsome tall young fellow, once again Heil Hitler and they start to look once again our way. I\nsaid, uh-huh, that's the woman who denounced me and Shiltz said, \"Come in here.\nwants to meet me.\" I said I don't know anybody. So, he said, I am Eric.\nYou know that smile on his face, oh his teeth and I said I don't know you do I? He said, I think\nyou would know me if we talked together. He didn't want to speak in front of Shiltz. That\nmakes me a little easier and I said how do you want to talk to me? Mr. Shiltz said use my office.\nI thought they're wired and they're just going to just -- so he pried again and he said my mother\nsaw you and she really almost fell in love with you. She made me come and meet you. I said,\nfor what reason. Because I can help you. You see, I'm half Jewish, but I cannot tell them\nbecause I am with the and I said well I'm Polish so that doesn't go together, and I\nhave a Polish boyfriend, and he said, well, he cannot help you, but I can. I said, well, maybe\nsometime in the future. He come once again, and I was in the hands of Mr. Shiltz who said you\nought to go out with him. He never tried to do anything to me. He just said can my mother --\nnot he, can my mother buy you -- you will make her so happy. I said no I don't need anything.\nSo, one day he came and he told Mr. Shiltz. He didn't ask me, but he asked Mr. Shiltz if he\ncould take me overnight to -- he named her name, I remember only her name was Elli and she\nwas in the . I don't remember the street. She owned a shoe store and a most\nbeautiful apartment and a very known husband of a , and she was a Nazi. He\nasked Shiltz that he would like to take me for a date there to a party. Then I found out that she\ntook over the Jewish families, the store, the shoe store and all his apartment with beautiful\nthings, with paintings that maybe you see in Louvre, and a big bust of Adolph Hitler. Then came\nsome other young soldiers that they came from Poland, SS men to the party, and Eric was there\ntoo. This young man who was maybe half drunk he was telling the group something that would\namuse them. I just came from near Limberg where we tied each child to a branch of the tree and\nput it aflame. And he said, why don't you laugh. I don't know. I don't find it funny. They are\nhuman beings. But they were Jewish. I said, oh, not to get myself into trouble, and Eric looked\nat me and he said, well I have some plans to take to show her a little bit around\nbecause she can not really go as a Polish girl. He must have seen something on my face, and I\ndon't know if Ellie knew something or not, but she always felt that I'm her . She\ntook to me. One time she came to Shiltz, Heil Hitler, she wants to take me to the Gestapo.\nRemember marching up those big headquarters, all those steps up with all those swastikas and I\nwent there and she said could you say Heil Hitler and I said Ellie don't ask me to do that. I'm\nPolish. And she said, \"I'll protect you.\" And she introduced me my . But she\ndidn't use Rutkofska. My , So I didn't have to add that. Then when it was very\nbad and the Germans were really retreating and there was lots of being in the basement, shooting,\nand the Russians came in from the other side, she had to go to to run away, and\nshe said the only thing, stay in my apartment but be sure that you take care of the\nbust of Adolph Hitler. Well, that was the first thing that went through the window. Then I took\nall the people that I know, Polish, Jewish and asked them to come to the shoe store and take as\nmany shoes as they can, and that was my revenge. At least to her. I never saw Eric or anyone.\nBut you spoke about the rape, but when the Russians came into that part, which later on they\nretreat on the other side of the Danube, I was living with a family, a German family who were\nEllie's friends. He was a piano player, blind, very nice family, and his wife was Maria. They\ntook me, so when the officer of the Russians came, they caught me in that building and asked to\nbring it down. This person laying down on the table and he said, \"I'm going to have intercourse\nwith you.\" And somebody went quickly upstairs to I think his name was Paul, that blind man I\nlived with. I don't remember the last name, and he came blind with a stick and he said, let my\nsister go. That's how close I was to it. Just because he was blind, I think, that that's what really\ntook that person back.\nQ. This was a Russian soldier?\nA. A Russian officer. Then I understand that many people in that building worried, and then\nwe heard that the American soldiers came on that side and I came down walked on the street and\nthere was an American soldier and I didn't speak English an I said American and he said yes.\nName? And he said Orbanik. I said are you Polish? He said, yes, no speak it. Never even tried\nto find him, but then I don't know with that United Jewish restitution who came with the\npackages and everything like for the Jewish people or was it that what was that?\nJoint Distribution, that's what it was. So, I came. I didn't have any food, nothing too much, and I\nsaid, I'm Jewish and I would like to register and they said, but you don't look Jewish. I said, are\nwe going to do in reverse now. Hitler thought I do, and you say I don't. He said, well,\neverybody would like to be Jewish to be a package. I said, that is unbelievable. Then there was\nnear the river and there was not far away from the , | was walking along and\nthat person that they showed you, the picture she was much older than I. I\nremember only she was coming to a mutual relative, and she was walking with a man and didn't\npay attention. I only heard her saying Oh, that girl looks like Sabina's daughter. My mother's\nname was Sabine. We turned around and she said, oh, maybe that is. So, I said, who are you.\nShe said are you Ava or Ruzia? I said, that's my sister Ruzia, I'm Ava. She said I'm\nand I had to recall when I met her she had always that beautiful hair growing all\nround. She was the first one to tell me where my mother was hiding. She came across in another\nhiding place with my mom, but then she was very good financially off so she was able to go to a\nsafer place and she never saw my mother again. So, she said, I hope you're getting food and I\ntold her what happened. So, she said, , 1t must be like some name, let me go with\nyou to the joint distribution and let me be a witness and I have that paper if you want to say Anna\nand I forgot his first name. They married eventually. He was in film industry and\nthey made a statement that I didn't know how to write -- read Jewish. They asked me to read that\nI am Jewish and I got a package with eggs and milk, and I broke out because I didn't have\nanything for so many years and to this day I cannot have eggs because I break out. I just can\nhave egg beater when they came out. That's how it was that history. So after I didn't have to\nwork anymore in Shiltz office, I start to enlist with to somehow finish my education\nin the business administration and I met a Valerie. Her father was a veterinarian and we made\nvery good friends, and that was still before they recognized me that I'm Jewish, because that\nhappened in 1944, almost the war was over. No, no, no, that happened in 1946, after the war\nwas already over. She invited me to her home to introduce me to her parents. They were very\nnice to me. They asked me to live with them. Then, in one Sunday dinner came Victor who was\na dentist and he started to just ask me out. Polish, that's what they talked. They were very happy\nthat we're going. They liked me, but they said that they were . You know, when\nyou lived in Prussia which was one time occupied by Germans. So, they had to go into Army, to\nthe military of Germany, but you were no the SS were you? He said no. I fought not to go, but I\nhad to serve. His father said, yes, we had to. I just bought it somehow. One time we went to the\nbeach and on his arm was SS and I said to his parents that they like him very much, but I cannot\ngo. That would be sacrilegious against my whole family. He cried, he said I didn't want to this\nway and that way, and her mother gave me a platinum chain, which I still have because I liked it.\nThen there was a Jewish doctor who is now in Chicago, Dr. Heller and his wife Ruthie and I told\nthem that, and he said Ava, denounce them. I bet the whole practice is overthrown Jews. He\nwas a Viennese. I start not to see him, but after when I start to inquire, my mother had a cousin\nthat I know that he sent her sometimes five or ten dollars because my father and my mother\nhelped him when he was a young man to come into a big city from a small little . lam\nstill in touch with his daughter Sadelle, in New York. She's married to a banker. He tried to\nwork with the restitution during this period. The papers started to be processed for me to come\nhere. At that time I denounced Victor, that he's an SS and his practice should be taken away, and\nI liked him, but I felt I had to do it. I did it. He tried to find me, because he knew me as a\nRutkofska. I saw him one time when I was with my husband, the only time in Vienna he was\nworking and he turned around and I turned around but that's all what it was it. Never called,\nnothing. It was hard to live being somebody else. It's not easy and especially when I was not\nrecognized. I had to go on for the longest time to pretend, otherwise I was no one. But then, I\ndecided to go to Czechoslovakia. I had to find Gaynosh. That was the whole purpose. So, I\nmake myself wait to go to Czechoslovakia but I was . I didn't belong\nanywhere.\nQ. What year was this?\nA. That was after the war '45, must be '46 before I even knew that was\ngoing to stop me. I went because there was a purpose, and they arrest me. One time, once again,\nthat Yugoslavian, or was he Czechoslovakian, he took me from one barrack to the other and he\nspotted me just like he helped me with that basket and he said . He must have\nhad pull, I still don't know what he did, and he said to them in the their language, which I didn't\nspeak, that he knows me. Somehow they free me. I Never was able to find Sishka or Gaynosh\nbecause he said I want you to leave right now because they may arrest you and I cannot get you\nout. So, there was absolutely no way. Then I started to get in contact with the Red Cross. All\nthe means that you can possibly think. When my husband, before he died went with me to Israel,\nI even went to made all the necessary information perhaps maybe they took the\nchildren to Israel, but to no avail, nothing. So, the nicest thing, Joan, what happened to me was I\nthought I would not turn to Judaism. That was my first thought. I thought if I ever have a\nfamily, I would not like them to go through what I went through just because you were Jewish.\nThere was no other reason. As a matter fact, I went to Parochial schools. And I have in my\nfamily people who are today practicing Christianity, but then I knew a friend from Poland, and\nshe was married to a doctor at the same hospital where my future husband now was working,\nwhich was the University Hospital in New York City, where my husband\nwas at that time, the last year resident already in the specialty of Radiology. They invite me to\nplay tennis with them. I never possessed my own racket because my mother couldn't afford. My\ncousin was very well to do and she was tall 6 feet and from her clothing sometimes they\nmade some dress for me, but we were always very close even though that she is closer to my\nsister's age, because I always told her the tricks when we came to visit her, as children. Her\nmother had governesses for her because nobody should blow on them and I always went\n. Iwas like Mitchell right now. Then, the family was not well to do but a very fine\nfamily of Milton Dorfman, and when I worked on Wall Street in the bank, at that time I\ninterpreted German and Polish. I knew a little bit Russian, and the other girls were Polish and I\nat one time when Magda said why don't you come and her husband was . Her\nson is one of the very known and he's in music that music that you and I possibly\ndon't understand. However, he is also a radiologist in Sausolito California, and his father was the\ngovernor of Maine and he was a very good friend of Milt, and we played tennis and I said, oh\nhe's so slow. He's not going to play good tennis. Well, he played tennis. I was jumping, but he\nplayed tennis. Then, what attracted me was that so many other people wanted to take me out to\nWaldorf Austoria or something and I was wondering what they would like to have in return for\nit, but Milt said we can have a hamburger or a hot dog and he always went like that because he\nwas wearing a jacket from Maury, from his older brother. I just thought that's nice. Then I met\nhim in 1948, very vaguely. That's what I wanted to tell you. Out of 35,000 people I was\nselected to be on a caravan of hope to bring my story and also there were two Israeli officers. I\nthink I sent you a clipping, Joan, of it. At that time I spoke of it worse than I speak now. I had\ndeveloped laryngitis and in our caravan of hope, we stopped in Utica, which is really near where\nI live since 1954 when I came with my husband at that time. The people were very nice. They\ntried to . I never knew what that 1s, but they were very friendly and I spot that.\nThat was in 1948, memories it was very hard to remember everything, and I even forgot that I\nwas in Springfield. When I sent you the clippings I said I was looking for some papers, and by\ncoincident I had the clippings from Springfield Massachusetts. Joan, if I wouldn't see my picture\nin that article, I cannot recall that I was in Springfield Massachusetts. No way. I remember I\nwas in Syracuse University because over there they once again, pretty girl with blue eyes and I\nalways thought I had green eyes, said now Ava Gardner will speak to us. Of course I don't know\nwho is Ava Gardner. I didn't see any movies, and I waited and they started to laugh. It's me. So,\nright now, before I came here. I tried to contact the Utica Observer Dispatch, which is a\nnewspaper, and they told me that if it's '48 or '49 it would be on microfilm in the public library,\nwhich I got the clipping that I showed you. Then I called the library and the University of\nSyracuse, and they send me a clipping which I showed you. They were one of the soldiers of the\nofficers was the nephew of the President to the Israeli state of , and the other\none lost both legs because I think that was the time that Israel gained independence in 1948 or\n'49. So, at that time I went on the caravan of Hope and the other place that stayed out in my\nmind. I had always that same blouse that you have the picture. I did not acquire anything else,\nand we went to Atlanta. I don't remember Atlanta but I remember the hotel that we stayed.\nThere was also a big philanthropist from Rochester , who when we got married,\nput carpet in our house because he remember me from the Caravan of Hope. He still lives in\nRochester. He's a great contributor to Israel. At that time I asked the elevator girl because that\nwas the only category I could afford to have maybe what she wears. If after work she can take\nme and I can get another blouse because I still have to go further. She said I can't go with you. I\nsaid is it because I'm Jewish. I said why. She said, because I cannot ride in the same bus that\nyou are. I said why not? She said, because I'm black. At that time I think, I'd like to go back,\nbecause there couldn't be anything worse at the time to go from one oppression and find that I\ncame to a country that is free and have that. Who's next I said to myself. That made a very big\nimpression on me and that's how I know I was in Atlanta. But nothing of that sort happened in\nSpringfield Massachusetts.\nQ. What was the Caravan of Hope?\nA. Caravan of Hope was primary to bring to the attention what happened with the Jewish\npeople and speaking about my , my experiences and for the Israeli soldiers or\nofficers to raise money for the UGA because a portion would be to save the children who came\nfrom Holocaust or other displaced families, and to raise money on all the stops. Then after I\ncame from Caravan of Hope, my husband at that time was just courting me, asked me if we can\nsee each other again. He's a very fine person, never never speaking about himself. That's when I\nmet his doctor McKenzie and he was just in the last year of radiology, a resident, a doctor came\nin and he asked Doctor McKenzie to look over the pictures, the x-rays and he said whatever\nDoctor Dorfman will say, that is the diagnosis, which I highly thought of. He asked me to go to\na dinner to his family. I told him, he asked me if eventually we can marry, and I said if your\nfamily wouldn't like me, I wouldn't marry you, because I really need a family. I meant it. So, we\nwent there. It was a nice apartment. The father worked at 70 years of age because he was a self\ntaught person to design dresses. They called him back at that age because he was so good, and\nhe always said to Mama, you wear this dress funny when I come home. It was a wonderful\nfamily, but when I came there once again, long hair I heard her brother, Uncle Abe saying, nice\ngirl, too bad she isn't Jewish. That followed me all the time. So, I opened the door, and I said,\nbut she 1s. He was just so happy about it. Then in 1949, Christmas day, a Professor\n, who still lives in New York City, who was the Chief of Radiology, lent us the\ncar and we went to Atlantic City, which was so called. Then he took a position in Des Moines\nIowa and that's where my both boys were born in a Methodist Hospital, and we had the\ncircumcision right there in the hospital because the family was so far away that nobody came for\nit. Then, my husband really wanted to be closer to the family and at that time -- I enjoyed Des\nMoines. There was a beautiful synagogue, a Reform, and there was evening sermons were very\nnice and educational. They spoke about everything and about the Holocaust, but then he was\noffered a position in New York City, which he didn't want to be in a big city not to raise the\nchildren there. Then there was a position in Rome, New York. We didn't know that Rome was\nhorrible at that time. I couldn't believe that I lived there. Then my cousin came from Paris she\nsaid this is a slow death. Why are you living here. We don't even have a movie. We have to\ntravel 20 miles to a movie. But a close knit family, and if you are part of the society or the\ncommunity then you grow closer. My husband was chosen among 14 other radiologist one of\nthem Jerry Segal, who 1s in Utica right now, and is glad that he didn't take it, because there 1s\nvery anti-semitic, a restricted golf club, and my husband never delved into what is going on, so\nwhen they proposed to him, he said fine I like to play golf but then when he found out that we\nwould be the only ones, he felt very bad. Later we learned that three voices were against only\nbecause he was Jewish and the vice president of the , Charlie Getty, who is a\nvery good friend of ours, said I will have to resign. Because if we can't have a fine person like\nMilt, we should be lucky that he wants to join. This is how I joined the Club,\nwhich I was the only one but at that time Rabbi, who is now living in Maryland, Rabbi Weimer\nsaid maybe there will be opening. But they until today they think Milt is Jewish and I'm not.\nAnd Joan, I don't want to talk about it. I feel that I'm still having problems with it because one\ntime I was asked what I am and then when I was Jewish that was no good. When I was non-\nJewish that was no good, so when they asked me I just said I believe that I do things other human\nbeings and that is the greatest religion what you can do, serve the fellow man. So, lots of people\nthink that I married Milt that he's Jewish, I'm not Jewish and I don't try one way or the other way\nto correct it. It's immaterial to me. Both my children were bar mitzvah, went to the Hebrew\nschool, and Gary right now I have two sons. One is Gary, one is Mitchell. They are also two\nyears apart. Both born in May. Gary is a professor of Radiology where he is lecturing at the\nMedical School at Brown and 1s chief of the department and that's also recently president of the\nCardiovascular Society for the whole United States and spoke recently in Sweden. But above\neverything, very good son. Mitchell is in New York. He's with the New York State Mental\nHealth and he is a psychologist. He got his masters and hopes one day to get his doctorate\ndegree. However, once again tragedy struck and we have been married 39 years and children\nstart to make preparation for our 40th wedding anniversary and on the fourth of July 1988, Gary\nand his family we pick them up at the Syracuse Airport with their little daughter who was 2 1/2\nor three years old and we went to our house. We had a wonderful Saturday, that same day. I had\nsome people for dessert in the evening, and my husband said, well it's late but we don't have to\nget up next morning, Sunday, so early. He never woke up. I found him sitting in his chair gone.\nEnd of Tape 2\nTape 3\nQ. Ava you were talking about the loss of your husband and how important he was to you.\nA. Well, he was not only a husband, he was a true friend and I didn't speak about my\nexperiences but only with Milt. He was a very kind and understanding person. I know that the\npatients former patients of his are still saying when Doctor Dorfman was here they must have\nthrown away the mold, how the saying goes. There isn't a kinder person that you can feel like at\nhome especially when you have radiology. You go into that big machine you need somebody.\nAt night evidently I had very bad dreams and sometimes I'd say don't let them take me. I had to\nexplain to him what I meant. But one time I think when Gary was around 17 or 18, he was just\nto graduate from high school, my husband was taken to the hospital with a heart attack. That\nwas the only one. He was on very minimal medications and everything was wonderful. As a\nmatter of fact, that fourth of July when the children came to visit us, Gary could not come very\noften because he is so busy. It was only because ten days later we were supposed to go to Alaska\nwhere I was taking a group of Senior citizens, and he and Doctor Brown who is on the picture\nwith with me and his wife were supposed to go together. Gary persuaded me that I\nshould take the trip in that short time because I didn't sit shiva. There was only one night and\nthey were laughing and making jokes, the man that supposed to get you out of --- I just couldn't\nstand it. I just said no. Mitchell had to go back to work and Gary stayed with me and then went\non the bus with me to Syracuse until he placed me on that plane. Of course I don't remember\nanything about Alaska. I cried and cried and Doctor Brown tried to give me some sedative and\nI'm anti-mediation so I just suffer without being calmed down. Every time they said you have to\neat something and I didn't. That's the time I lost 17 pounds which I never regained. It was a\nshock, just a shock because we were together and on Sunday just to find him just --- I took his\nhead and I said, we call each other babe, not Milt or Ava was not known and everybody called\nhim -- my cousin writes letters \"how 1s baby?\" So, I said babe you can take and I stopped\nbecause he was cold, and the friend of ours who is the publisher of the paper he still says he\nremembers when I said \"He's so cold, he's so cold.\" I was in shock. They didn't know if I'm\ngoing to get out, but they used to have a friendly poker game every Friday in the Sentinel which\nis our newspaper. When Milt died, they never resumed it. George Waters and Shirley said,\nGeorge doesn't face anyone without Milt. He was very recognized professionally. He was\npresident of the whole Society, not only locally but for the New York State. He was a very good\n, was a wonderful husband and friend, and a wonderful father. When you read the\nclippings, which maybe I left you, he did volunteer radiology for the DDSO, which deals with\nthe mental retardation and they provided a portrait of my husband. He looks exactly like the\nwrite up that Gary put for his obituary in the medical journal. It was a whole dedication with lots\nof friends invited and the mayor of our city, Carl Ilemberg said that he doesn't know in his\nhistory of serving everywhere he comes from Rochester that two people in the same family\nwould be honored because there was the dedication and the whole radiology department and the\nDDSO is Doctor Milton Dorfman. And of course, as you know, I think I mentioned one time to\nyou Joan initially when we spoke like a year ago, that when I saw the mistreating in the\nconcentration camp of the elderly in particular no mercy, and I was so close to my grandfather\nand grandmother, I said to God, whoever he was at that time, that when I survived the\nconcentration camp I will do something for the elderly and for the children, and I left you the\nwrite up. You'll see that I single handedly I was able to try to get and through\nsingly handed just raise 45,000 as a third of the whole payment for the land for the building, and\nthen Governor Rockefeller was then the governor and they asked me to speak about the aged. I\ndon't know if you ever heard of Monsignor Faye. He said for every President, Kennedy, Johnson\nand then Nixon as a member on the Committee on the Aging in Washington to the President. I\nknow Monsignor when he was Father Faye and when they called me for the Catholic charities in\nUtica that Rockefeller was going to speak, could I come and speak on the aged because I was\nsort of a pioneer in that area. I said not with Monsignor Faye. He's too knowledgeable and so I\ncame and he met me in the White House. I was delegate to the White House conference on\naging and I met him there. As a matter of fact, when we had the 25th anniversary of the Senior\nCitizen's Council and the movement in the room I called the University where he is\nthe President of the third world, and I said I would like to speak with Monsignor Faye, and he\nsaid who shall I say is calling, and I said he would not know me, but I would like to speak with\nme. So, he came to the telephone and he never said Monsignor, he said Father Faye and I said\nMonsignor you would not remember me he said \"Hello Ava.\" He said it there was 400 people\nwhich 1s a big beautiful place and he said how can we forget Ava. Then, just by the\nSenate and the Congress they proclaimed the whole day Ava Dorfman. I told Sheri Bolet who is\nthe Congressman you have to give me at 8:00 in the evening the day is almost over. I hope -- the\none thing I will say that God helped me to fulfill my promise, because I started just calling a\nmeeting of the retirees from the manufacturing from cable and I'll call and and\nit grew to 3,200 where I was 17 years the president and that was the time when my children were\n5 and 7. I drug them everywhere and every senior citizen was their grandma and grandpa. Asa\nmatter of fact, when I came one time to New York and Mitchell was already after college before\nhe got his masters, I said, Marie will be coming, Mother don't let her call me Mitchey. Surely\nenough she did. But I didn't give up lots of times that they could have spent with the children,\nbut I didn't play cards. I didn't go anywhere in the evening. I stayed at home. When they were\nin school and before they come to school we almost met because I tried to divide my time. At\nthe beginning my husband was the chief of the Radiology at Rome Hospital and then opened his\nown practice, so he was very busy. As a matter of fact, my husband was very understanding and\nany honors that were bestowed on me I always felt that he had to have a better part in it because\nnot many husbands would see that on Saturday and Sunday I cleaned the house and ironed\nbecause I didn't have the time to do it. There were others, United Way, Polio, Mother's March\nand for the children I established a speech therapy where the children from parochial schools and\npublic schools and the deaf school were coming and raised the money to pay the speech\ntherapist. But it comes back to you. One time my car was stolen and I had to call the Triple A\nand Mr. came and said Mrs. Dorfman we'll have to take that car to the shop and\nrecharge the battery. I said how will I get there. Oh, I'll get a ride. I'll come there. It was more\nthan the Triple A pays and I aid how much I owe you. He says nothing. He shows me a picture,\nlike a newspaper picture of a girl and he said you paid a lot. I said, how did I. Jackie was in\nyour speech therapy and she was stuttering and having a clef palate and you sent her to Kim\nJanet in Hunter New York. You have done wonders because she is now graduating from college.\nSo, there is you don't ask for rewards but whatever you do good to people it comes back and I\nfeel if my children, and I see them living by that example, and when I sometimes used to say to\nGary how come you're getting so late for dinner. Well, mother it would make you feel good. I\nwent to the ward where they are really forgotten elderly people and I just thought I'd see what\nthey are doing. I was happy. I was happy. My husband was also very active. He was the first\nchairman, president of the . He tried to be active, and most of all was very kind\nto the human race, and that is very important. His parents, when they printed the invitation for\nour wedding, they said the wedding of our children, the wedding of our children and my father --\nwhich I called him papa, was very nice when the neighbors asked him how is your daughter-in-\nlaw and he said I don't have daughter-in-law, I have a daughter. So, but now that Milt is gone,\nI'm taking a candle and going to the Temple when I get the announcement that there is the\nand I feel that they were close to me. There is still one sister, Blanche. Her\nhusband was a doctor in New York City and he died of cancer. I do come together. She came to\nthe funeral. And another son, another brother died so it's really Blanche only who 1s alive. I\ndon't know what to tell you else.\nQ. I have just a couple of questions from before. You mentioned that there was a particular\nroll call at the Yunaski camp with this little child?\nA. Yes. You see in the summer time when they called us out again sitting on that hot\nsummer day, they put buckets of water just for us to see but not to give us. We were so dry we\ncouldn't get anything. But they brought more people in from different areas and among them\nwas a child who was just crawling and the child doesn't know anything so she or he crawled to\nthat bucket and put his hands in and that SS or Gestapo, they're all the same, had a whip with\nleather fringes, and he kicked the child -- no kicked the bucket and the water just was out and I\nsaid, now that you've had your fun, can have the child have some water. He once again thought\nthat that was very brave and Jews wouldn't do that. Am I not Jewish and I said no, I'm not.\nHowever, they put the other bucket and the child crawled again and he kicked the child in such a\nway that we couldn't even look around because we couldn't turn our heads. Then he came and\nstruck me over my face and I had a big scar here. Now, I had the surgery I never know but\neverything happened on that side. It was not the strap but what he did. That is what I would\nalways remember. There were many other incidents too numerous to mention. I mean the\nhanging of the people or putting dogs, vicious dogs and seeing the flesh taking of the people. I\ndon't know. It was 20th century and the German people were supposed to be so civilized.\nWhere is the civilization taking us.\nQ. One last story. When you were waiting to come to this country, you were waiting for a\nship called the Lillymarlane?\nA. From . At that time there was a strike an they could not move the boat at\nthat time from Brenehauffer and other friend who came together at that time, Anna Novak, her\nhusband was an attorney and he passed away and she married a Doctor Heller, not the same\nHeller, and he's with the Northwestern Medical School. So is her son in the same place, and\nHenry her husband then said -- no they came and told us we have to clean the toilets because\nthat's where our buildings, our bunk beds because I remember that Anna and Henry were there, I\nwas here. They came and once again Germans clean the toilets and Henry went. He was an\nattorney. He went and cleaned for Anna too. I said I wouldn't do that, and the German looked at\nme and said yes you would and I said No I won't. Henry pleaded with me in Polish, you are so\nclose to a new life, don't be stubborn, go clean. I wouldn't. I just wouldn't. So, they took me to\nan office where there was other military person just with a shirt not with that straps and I told\nhim that I had to succumb to anything they wanted. After the war I don't feel like I want to do\nthat. He said, he looked at me, he sat there and looked at me and he said but don't you want to\ngo to America and start a new life. I said yes, but that doesn't mean that 1 have to clean the\ntoilets. He said I'm from Austria. They were not very much better, but I told him that I lived\nthere and he said, well, why don't you don that for me. I said I wouldn't do that for you. I\nwouldn't do it for me. He said, well it seems like you are determined. I will tell them that I have\na different job for you. I don't know what I did and Henry said she won once again. Well, won\nor not won, it was degrading to me after the war that they had to do once again that dirty job.\nBut, as they said when I came here it was not so easy neither because the cousin of my mother\nhad an aunt from his wife's side. We never knew and he was on vacation when I came. He came\nin July and he was with the children Sadell and Julius and he asked me to be with that aunt.\nVery uneducated and she had a daughter Molly and Molly came in and asked me how the dress\nlooks on her. I was always and I said not so good. They didn't know that in the\nUnited States you always say oh nice lovely and she felt that that was very offensive to her. At\none point she said, hatred did not do that to the Jews in the United States so it\nmust have been that God wanted it this way. Well, that was the end. I just took my things and\nfound out that the Doctor Heller from Vienna and Rudy were in the United States, and then they\nasked me come and live with them. From there when I started to work at Wall Street with the\nPolish bank I lived with a Jewish family. That's what I want to tell you about, Ann Remler,\nZigmund's sister. I lived on Ocean Avenue and I wore, -- I don't remember her husband's name\nbut she was Sophie and they were very nice. They had two boys and friends came and played.\nAt that time I made a promise to my sister's father --in-law. He had a daughter who studied\nmedicine in Vienna and I only know that she married an American medical student. I know that\nshe was Anna Silver, but I didn't know who she married. So when I was -- that was before I\nmarried my husband, but we were seeing each other. I went to the New York Times and spoke\nto a then reporter who was very known, Charlie Grutzner, told him that I'm looking for Anna\nSabol who married an American, at that time student and they're married and they live right here.\nThey are in psychiatry maybe. So, in Bellview Hospital some other doctor said, Anna I think\nthey are searching for you. She said maybe they're somebody crazy from Bellview and they\nfound out my name, but they came to the restitution office and we met. They were both\npsychiatrists and their two sons came to that people that I lived there. That's why I remember\nthere was a Time Magazine and they had an article just around the corner because they lived just\naround the corner. She asked me that she's very sorry that she would like to help me, to give me\nanything they wanted and I said no. You could have saved your family and maybe us, but you\nasked Zigmund only to come and leave Ruzia and her little boy alone and your family said Shiva\nand tore his garment and he wants you to know that. Then she called my sister-in-law Blanche\nhow she can get me. They tried very hard then I married and I said I don't want anything from\nthem. But one time I was maybe, a year ago, that's how I find I said to Mitchell\nin New York City, you know I wonder if she 1s still alive because she had a practice and this is\nthe time that we found in the telephone book . I said it doesn't say Doctor, so he\nsaid well why don't you call and ask, so he called and he spoke and they said yes, which Remler\nand he said Doctor Remler and he said who you are and he said I'll let you speak to my mother\nand that proved to me he was the brother of Doctor Remler, of her husband and I understand that\nhe was killed in an accident with his younger son and Anna since then has passed away, but they\nhave a son who is in William and Mary, a Professor and one is a surgeon in California\nsomewhere but I called that William and Mary and he told me that do you know that brother of\nZigmund Hiney is in Los Vegas. So, see what happens after 50 years.\nQ. You recently told, and we'll do this shortly, your son Gary about your first marriage.\nA. Gary visited me by himself without the family. I don't know how the conversation went,\nbut I didn't see too much of his daughter and I thought that Vicki herself could come sometime\nbut she's typical New England, very reserved and she doesn't feel comfortable to come without\nhim, and I said just to hold her in my arms and that's what brought out and I told him. I as a\nmother sense that it made adverse impression on him. Why didn't you tell us. I said that was a\ndecision between Daddy and I and I was only married seven months. I don't even know if I was\nmarried. It didn't make any impression. I didn't even have time to adjust myself. The child also,\nthree months, I just didn't and I thought you should know. I always thought I was the first born.\nI said you are of a lasting marriage of 39 years Gary and I spent so much time with you in\nsickness and in happiness and he said are you going to tell Mitchell. I said, with time, with time,\nwhen it's going to be the proper time. And I think I will do when I visit Mitchell at the end of\nthis month as I'm going to the Survivors of the Holocaust they are having gathering in New York\nCity. It's not going to be easy, and this is why maybe a whole year that you are trying to make\ncontact, I didn't want to say something that it's not accurate, and it will take me a long time to\nreturn to be half normal. I cannot ever be normal life. In the beginning we didn't have too much,\nbut then we're comfortable, and I still would not spend on me to buy a suit unless I'm pressed to\nit, but I would donate $5,000 to a cause if it would be for a good reason. It's hard when you eat\ndinner and remember my sister saying that she's hungry. You don't forget that. You can keep on\nthe bottom somewhere in your memory but it stays with you. Any my mother now that I'm\ndefinitely over 42 and I realize that 42 is very young, it's a young life and Ruzia never fulfilled\nher dreams neither and my uncles and aunts. I lost 58 with the immediate family not counting\nfarther relatives. lost her father even he obtained papers and went to practice in\nWarsaw as a Doctor Wosinski. It didn't help them. Her brother Karl, a medical student,\nhandsome as can be, shot on the street. Where do you draw the line. My other aunt who was\nmarried to Doctor . He was a lawyer. And his daughter who was so pretty, all\nvanished. all those people. They're just remnants of my memory but not\npeople. I don't think that I to the very last day of my life will ever overcome through it the\nHolocaust. But, as my son called me yesterday, \"Mother, do it. Tell the one that doesn't know\neverything. Do it. Tell them everything. Do it for us, the younger generation that they cannot\nforget it. That is should not happen again.\" Wouldn't it? I don't know. I am still scared. When\nI read and I do get and the Jewish publication and see what's going on on the\ncampuses, what's going on in Germany. As a matter of fact the orthopedist that I tried to find out\na day that the Germany invade Poland told me that he was to a meeting in Norway and an\northopedist doctor in Norway why you Americans so scared of Russians. Why aren't you scared\nof Germans. I was taken then to an underground you would not believe how much ammunition\nis there and how they greet each other. I said Andy, how heil Hitler so lots of things are going\non and people for sure are not more sympathetic than the Jewish people.\nQ. Well, Ava, thank you. I know how hard this was for you.\nA. I had to do it. Thank you for asking me, because I never will come on my own will.\nEnd of Tape 3\nTape 4\nQ. Ava, we have a few pictures, if you could please identify?\nA. This is my mother. Her first name was Sabina Muller. She was very beautiful and I lost\nher when she was 42 years of age, but that was before the war taken and given to me by an aunt\nfrom Warsaw. I didn't have any pictures. This is a picture that I believe it was taken while I was\nregistering as a Polish girl to work in Vienna because that blouse was given to me by a friend of\nmine, Wanda and that's the blouse that sustained me through the whole time during my working\ndays in Vienna. That is a picture that I think was taken while I was still working for that\nin Vienna because it's the same blouse. I hope that after the war I hope I\nacquire other blouse. I'm not sure even. This picture would be really the first one, because after\nthe war I was so eager to finish my education and there was the Academia and\nthey took the picture. Still the same famous blouse and I would say that that would be the first\none. If they came relatively in shorter time, it must be at that time taken. I came to Vienna in\n'43. The war was over in '45, so it had to be at that time.\nQ. This is the name that you took?\nA. That Rutkofska. Yes. I think does it say Stephanie there or maybe not?\nQ. Ava.\nA. Ava Rutkofsak. Well, maybe I dropped the Stephanie but in my papers I have Stephanie\nwhoever she was.\nQ. Thank you very much.\nA. You're very welcome. I'm glad it's over.\nConclusion of Interview\n"
