        "Question: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.\nThis is an interview with Gerda Haas, conducted by Katie Davis, on September 25th,\nvideotaped interview, conducted with Gerda Haas on June 12th, 1995. The United States\nHolocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making\nthis interview possible. This is tape number one, side A. Just -- if we could begin by just\nhaving you say your full name, including your maiden name.",
        "Answer: My what?",
        "Q: Your full name, including your maiden name.",
        "A: Oh yes. Okay, I do -- I do begin. I\u2019m Gerda Haas, born Gerda Schild, in Anspach,\nGermany and I\u2019m now sitting in Minneapolis in my very comfortable home, with the sun\ncoming in on all sides and you, Katie Davis are interviewing me on this September the\n23rd, I believe, is it?",
        "Q: 25th.",
        "A: 25th?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Right. And I understand that the purpose of the interview is to -- to talk mainly, but\nnot exclusively about life after liberation and I really like to do that. When I first received\nthe letter from the United States Holocaust Museum about your visit to me, I -- I really,\nseriously began thinking about my life after liberation. And it seemed a good time, too.\nThis is -- in the Jewish calendar, this is what we call the Assera siamata shuva, the 10\ndays between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, where we are supposed to think about\nour lives and what we have done and have we done it correctly, have we any regrets?\nWould you like to do it any differently? And it seemed a very appropriate time to -- to --\nto go through my 75 -- 75 and a half years on this earth and thank you for giving me that\nopportunity.",
        "Q: [inaudible] One thing we wanted to ask you, was to have you state the full name of\nyour parents and including the maiden name of your mother. Both your father and your\nmother.",
        "A: Sure. Pll be happy to do that. My maiden name was Schild, that\u2019s spelled S-c-h-1-I-d.\nMy father\u2019s name was Siegfried Schild, good German name and he came from a very\nsmall town on the Mian river, by the name of Hessdorf. And he was a butcher and in\nthose days, families had to marry off their sons and daughters for a purpose, so since he\nwas a butcher, a -- my grandparents looked for an opportunity for him to marry into a\nbutcher shop. It was as simple as that. That\u2019s the way it was 1n the olden days. And there\nwas this Paula Yoksburger in Anspach, who was one of five daughters and her parents,\nmy grandparents, Sophie and Gabriel Yoksburger were very hard up to marry off their\nfive daughters without money. You see, in those days you needed to have money to\nmarry off a daughter. And finally, they knew of this young man in Hessdorf who was\nlooking for a -- what they called a shiduch, a -- a match between himself and someone\nwho was somewheres in the butcher business. And it worked out fine, even though my\nmother was two years older and I\u2019m sure there was no great love, but it was a marriage in\nthose days that was called very appropriate and very good and it -- 1t was fine.",
        "Q: What did your maternal grandparents do? Wa-Was the -- your maternal grandfather a\nbutcher?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Yes, he had a butcher shop in Anspach, no sons and he needed to have a son-in-law\nthat would step into his butcher shop. And, as a matter of fact, he died very soon after his\ndaughter\u2019s sa -- his -- his daughter Paula was married to this young butcher boy from\nHessdorf and it -- it worked out just wonderfully. He died and the son-in-law stepped into\nthe butcher shop in Anspach and there was my mother and father and soon after -- a year\nafter the marriage there was one daughter, my sister Freidel and two and a half years after\nthat, I arrived, Gerda. And the only regret my father had up to his dying day, that he\ndidn\u2019t have a son. In Anspach, it would have been necessary to hand the butcher shop\nover to a son. But as it turned out, that reason fell completely away and I guess he got\nover not having a son. He -- he -- he was okay with his two daughters.",
        "Q: Do you know anything more about your family in Anspach, how long they had been\nthere and had been butchers?",
        "A: Yes, I did a little research on my family at one time. The Schild family -- the ones that\nlived in Hessdorf, my father\u2019s side of the family, apparently came out of Spain in the\n17th or 18th century with that wave of emigration that -- that -- that was triggered by the\ne-emancipation in Spain. And apparently that\u2019s where my family comes from, because\nmy Jewish na -- my Hebrew name is Sprinza, which 1s Esperanza for -- for a young girl.\nAnd apparently I had a grandmother or a great-grandmother or some female ancestor --\nancestress I would say, a female ancestor, who -- who was a Spaniard. And apparently\nthat\u2019s what happened on my father\u2019s side. On my mother\u2019s side, the story is that we came\n-- that they came from a very small town called Yoksburg and as you probably know, in -\n- in the 18th century, the -- the Jews finally got last names. Up to then it was Moshe the\nbutcher or Jakob -- Yakob the shoemaker, they didn\u2019t have names. And apparently, when\nthey -- when the time came, when the decree was passed down that the Jews had to have\nnames, many of them took the name of their town -- of the town they lived in. So that\u2019s\nwhy you have so many Berlinner and Hamburger and -- and of small tow -- Frankfurter\nor Kissinger. These are all people that came from particular towns and that\u2019s how my\ngrandparents were named Yoksburger, because they had lived in a small town called\nYoksburg, which is very close to Anspach. You must understand that, in opposition to\nAmerica, where the Jews are all clustered and -- and congregated in large cities, this was\nnot the case in Europe. In Europe, Poland, Germany and all the many countries of\nEurope, the Jewish communities -- the strong Jewish communities were in the small\ntowns, because there the people left them in peace. There was always anti-Semitism, but\nin small towns, very frequently they were able to buy themselves the protection of the --\nof the lord. They were called Markgraffen or whoever owned these little towns and by\nbeing servile to these feudal lords and being useful to them, they were able to get the\nprotection and they settled in those small towns and they remained very Orthodox, many\nof them. There was nothing else, it was Orthodoxy or nothing.",
        "Q: Would you describe the community in Anspach as -- as --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- a strong community by the time that you are aware of it as -- as [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes. Yes, I would. We had the -- we had a rabbi who was a -- a leader in -- 1n -- in the\n-- in the ge -- in the European German commu -- Jewish community. His name was Eli\nMunck. He wrote several seminal books on -- on the pr -- the prayers, the world of prayer\nfor instance and the call of the Torah. He was just a very great light in -- in Jewish\nintelligencia. And I -- Id like to say this, which many people forget. Th-Th-Th-The\nGerman rabbis were able to become so great and to devote themselves to writing because\nthey were not hired by the community. Here, a rabbi is beholden to his board of directors\nand to his president and to the wives, in order to keep his job and he has very little time to\n-- to -- to be independent, to think stuff on his own. But in Europe -- in Germany\nparticularly, religion was a state -- spa -- state sponsored affair. Each one of us had to pay\na religion tax and the Jewish religion tax went to pay the rabbis and upkeep the\nsynagogues and the other -- the Christian religion tax went their way. So the rabbis were\nvery free and we were very fortunate to have just two fantastic rabbis in a row. When I\nwas very young, our rabbi was Pinhusk Horn, which was also a name that stands forever\nin -- in -- in Jewish history of Germany. And then we had this wonderful Eli Munck, who\ndevoted himself to writing and to bringing up the youngsters, because he knew that the\nfuture of Judaism was in the youngsters. I -- I\u2019d like to say one other thing that only\noccurred to me very recently. Th-The rabbis in Germany did not urge the Jews to leave\nand I remember my parents holding that somewhat against Rabbi Munck. Why didn\u2019t he\nsay, \u201cGo find yourself another place to go to.\u201d He never did. And it only occurred to me\nvery recently that this was for the obvious reason that the rabbis were state employed,\nyou see? Do you understand what I\u2019m saying? They couldn\u2019t say that or they -- or Hitler\nwould have knocked them off in a minute. The rabbis were completely dominated by the\nstate. And -- and the outgrowth of that thought is thank God for the separation of state\nand church in this country. So you -- you live a long time before these things really dawn\non you. You know, we adored this rabbi and we believed everything he said and we did\neverything he said. But he didn\u2019t tell us to leave, you see? Think about that. Is -- it\u2019s\nreally -- it\u2019s a revelation when that thought came to me. He himself left with his family,\nafter awhile and saved himself and his many children, but he didn\u2019t tell us to leave.",
        "Q: How did that revelation change how you thought about him or -- or shift how you\nprocessed the whole experience? Because certainly --",
        "A: That\u2019s --",
        "Q: -- his story, Rabbi Munck\u2019s story is something that you mentioned several times in the\nprevious interview --",
        "A: [ know.",
        "Q: -- and there was something kind of nagging, I would say.",
        "A: Yeah, first of all, I want to spell his name, so people know who I\u2019m talking about. It\nwas Eli Munck, M-u-n-c-k. Dr. Eli Munck and he is very famous rabbi. He left and went\nto Paris afterwards and founded a -- a fine, deeply religious Jewish community in Paris,\nRu cardet. And I\u2019m still very friendly with many of his children. Now, how did it affect\nme? I adored the man, you see? In -- in -- in Germany, the rabbi was somewhere between\nyour father and God, equi-distance. And I particularly liked the Munck family. I was like\na child in their house myself. And it didn\u2019t change my feelings toward him. Also, one of\nthe reasons it didn\u2019t change my feelings toward him was when I was liberated -- and now\nI\u2019m jumping ahead several years -- when I was liberated to Switzerland and ended up in\nMontrou -- Seulemontre at Laisavont, I found out very soon that Eli Munck and his\nwhole family had fled from Paris and had established themselves in Geneva. And once I\nknew that, I got in touch with him and he with me. And he was the first person I saw\nagain, of my for-former life. You can\u2019t argue with feelings, you see? I loved the man and\nhere I saw him again, after all I had gone through and I credited him in a way with my res\n-- religiosity. He gave me that strong belief in God and he guided me through my\nyounger years. My parents were busy and making a living and were very simple people,\nno education. And he -- he gave me a lot. I -- I didn\u2019t change my feelings toward him, I\nhave to say. It should have, but 1-it didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Can you describe that meeting?",
        "A: Yes. I -- I -- I have several pictures of him. We were very friendly here, in this count -\n- after Switzerland, after I got to his -- this country, he went back -- he and his family\nwent back to Paris and then he retired and I can\u2019t tell you now the year, but 1t must have\nbeen -- oh yes, I can tell you the year. In the 70\u2019s -- in the 19 six -- late 60\u2019s or early 70\u2019s,\nhe and his wife retired and came over here for the same reason we came to Minneapolis.\nThey had children in -- living in New York and they came over to retire in New York.\nWe were still living in Maine at the time and my -- my great admiration and love for him\nand his wife, went so far as to make a new friendship between them and my husband and\nmyself. And we visited them several times in New York and he came up to Maine and\nstayed with us for awhile. And I have several letters by him and pictures of him. He was\na smallish man, very trim, very neat. Little beard and dark, alert eyes and he had a little\nFrench sing-song accent in his voice, because he was actually born in Paris, but I don\u2019t\nremember how come. And his wife was a jolly, roundish, lovely woman, always smiling,\nalways happy a-and I -- I just like them both.",
        "Q: Can you remember back to -- you said that he was the first person from your former\nlife that you saw in Switzerland, but remember back to that meeting and what you talked\nabout -- what you talked about at that meeting and whether or not perhaps you prayed\ntogether?",
        "A: No -- well, he was -- I -- I have to tell you a very funny story. When we came to\nSwitzerland -- and I like to talk about that at some more length later on, but just now, in\nconnection with my great friendship with Eli Munck, when I was liberated to\nSwitzerland, we -- that whole transport, were again put into a lager -- into a concentration\nlager, it was nothing like what I just came out of, it was the grand hotel in mont -- in -- in\nSeulemontre, in Laisavont. I might have a picture of it, it was a gorgeous hotel that was\nemptied out for us, so that we -- these 12 hun -- it wasn\u2019t the whole group, it was maybe\n300 people, could be put up in great comfort with this gorgeous view of Lake Geneva\nbelow us and Montplant on the other sides and -- and all the mountains around us, so\ndon\u2019t think it was a -- a concentration camp, but it was a concentrating lager so that we\ncould be controlled. We couldn\u2019t roam around. We had to check in and check out, we had\nguards on the doors. We had to always be in -- tell them where we went. And so, I\nwanted to visit my beloved Rabbi Munck in Geneva. And somehow -- I don\u2019t know how,\nI got myself a ticket to -- to go there on the -- on the train. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s very -- it\u2019s a very\nshort distance, as you know. It\u2019s just a -- a little bit around on the lake of Geneva. And I\nasked for permission to -- to go and the permission was denied. And you know what I\ndid? I left secretly, on my own, to see my beloved rabbi. And you know what happened?\nTwo Swiss policemen caught me on the train station in Montrou as I was just about to\nstep onto that train and took me back and put me into what was like a -- a little solitary\nconfinement. Again, in great luxury, but it was a locked door and a locked window and I\nhad my food passed in and out. This because I needed so badly to see the rabbi and his\nfamily. Can you believe it?",
        "Q: You disobeyed?",
        "A: I disobeyed. I thought -- I thought this was more important than -- I c -- I couldn\u2019t\neven understand why they didn\u2019t grant me the -- so then, to follow up on the story, I --\nthe rabbi heard about it, because I had told them to meet me at the train, so I had to\nsomehow tell them that I was now imprisoned at the Grand Hotel in -- in Laisavont, so\nthey came to see me. And I don\u2019t believe that they let me out. I think we talked through\nthe window. I -- I don\u2019t have a recollection of actually seeing them, but we saw each\nother and -- and it was just wonderful. So then afterwards, when things loosened up a\nlittle -- this was very soon after I got there and in a way I really don\u2019t blame them. We\nweren\u2019t allowed to roam Switzerland at will, so here was my -- my petition was denied,\nbut then after awhile -- this was in February, or say March, then in April, at Paisa --\nPassover time, they allowed me to join the Munck family for Paisa. The things that I\nremember now, after all these years. And the funny thing 1s, tho-those Munck children,\nwho were then -- well, the oldest daughter is six years younger than I am, so I was 20 -- I\nwas 23 when I got out of -- was I? I think I was 20 f -- 23 or four when I got out of\nTheresienstadt. So she was six years younger and she remembers this very well. I\u2019m still\nin great contact with them. She is now |-lady -- the Lady Acobowitz. She 1s now the --\nthe wife of the Chief Rabbi of -- the former Chief Rabbi of England -- of Great Britain.\nAnd we often exchange little remembrances like this.",
        "Q: Since we\u2019re talking about this, Il just continue on with a few more questions about\nthis. Can you tell us about going for Passover? I\u2019m assuming that would be the first time\nyou really celebrated in your faith --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- after the experience of the camp?",
        "A: It was, yes.",
        "Q: Tell us about that.",
        "A: I remember that there was one little piece of chicken for the whole family and frau --\nDr. Munck cut it into very, very small pieces and everybody had just a little bit to eat, but\nit was the very first time that I ate chicken again. How strange that I should remember\nthat instead of -- instead of some very spiritual emotions. I-It was just an emotional event.\nIt was just a very emotional event. I was, of course, very friendly with the -- with the\nchildren that were born in Anspach, but since then they had had three more and so I was\ninvolved with those babies and -- and talking -- the one thing I remember, we didn\u2019t talk\nabout the Holocaust at all. They didn\u2019t talk about their flight to Switzerland and I didn\u2019t\ntalk about my time in Theresienstadt and I didn\u2019t talk about losing my mother and sister.\nOf course, at that point, I was still hoping to find them. So, it was just great to be able to\ntravel and to -- to walk the streets and not be picked up by either Ger-Germans or Swiss,\nthat was so funny. And it was great.",
        "Q: Th-There is one question I have about war time, a-and it is -- it is related to this. And\nit\u2019s, when you were in Theresienstadt, if -- if you could talk a little bit about your\nrelationship with God at that point.",
        "A: With God?",
        "Q: During the time that you were in the camp, were you praying, talking to God? What\nwere your thoughts about your faith and your experience [indecipherable]",
        "A: Good question, good question and it\u2019s a question that is to date unresolved, but Ill --\nPll try to go back. I ca -- I come from a very basic Orthodox family. No great learning,\nbut just simple, basic belief that God wrote the Torah and whatever is in the Torah,\nbecause God wrote it, you obey it. You don\u2019t ask why, you don\u2019t argue, you don\u2019t go into\ndiscussions, you just do it. This actually helped me, because I so basically and -- and\norganically believed all this. You see, you say your night prayers every night, you get rid\nof all the bad things that happened during the day and you only focus on -- on -- on\nasking for the good things, for the health of your parents and your grandparents and your\nsister and your teachers and your rabbi. And this helped me a great deal because\nunquestioningly, I believed that right through the Holocaust. I remember having the first\nqualms about it, when I actually learned that my mother and sister had been killed so\ncruelly. My mother, this religious person who gave me all that wonderful belief, how\ncould she have been killed? And my sister, who believed just as I did? And I -- I\nremember changing places, actually, with God. I -- my belief was always I had to account\nfor the things I did wrong and all of a sudden it occurred to me, what about the things\nGod did wrong? Doesn\u2019t He have a responsibility to me too, that He killed my mother\nand my sister and my aunts and uncles and cousins. All my friends, everybody I had with\nthe all -- sole exception of my father. And you know, you are -- you were so ingrained\nwith that fear of coming up to heaven when you die and you have to give an account of\nyourself and it occurred to me very suddenly, God will have to give an account to me,\ntoo. And from then on, my faith reverted itself. I remember that very clearly, because it\nwas a great struggle. My father remained completely religious. I asked him once what he\nthought of his wife and daughter being slaughtered like -- li -- like -- like the 6,000,000\nwere and everybody knows now -- we didn\u2019t know at the time and we didn\u2019t want to\nknow. But once we knew how they died, I asked him once, \u201cDoesn\u2019t that impair your\nfaith a little bit?\u201d He said, \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s the way God wanted it. God did it. God gave them life\nand God took it away.\u201d I guess it\u2019s one way of looking at it. We never ask why we are\nborn, so we really have no reason to ask why he takes life away from us. But anyway,\nwhat was your question? How it impair -- so now my -- I\u2019m still Orthodox. I still observe\nall the things that I learned in my youth. Number one, because I never wanted to\ndisappoint my father. Number two, because I married a very religious man and number\nthree, it -- 1t gives meaning to my life, you know? You observe the holidays, it\u2019s great,\nthe family gathers around the Yuntive table and -- and you go to synagogue. But that\nbasicness that I have mentioned before, that -- that organic feeling, that\u2019s gone. Now I\nobserve the religion for -- for other reasons. Because I -- I have to do something. I have\nto believe in something. And also, one of the great reasons that I -- I still -- that I haven\u2019t\nchanged my ways at all is that actually God was very good to me. Look at my life. I have\na great husband, I have four very, very nice children. I have four very nice in-law\nchildren. I have 11 grandkids. Not one of them is retarded or has crooked teeth or -- or\ncross-eyed or club feet. They\u2019re all great people. So how can I not be grateful? How can I\n-- how can I be so arrogant as to say, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe any more.\u201d I di -- I didn\u2019t\ndeserve it. I didn\u2019t deserve this 50 years of sunshine in my life. So I live with the --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nGerda Haas and this is tape number one, side B. Can you tell us about -- can you tell us\nabout how you observed your faith when you were still in the camp?",
        "A: Yes, I -- I\u2019d like very much to talk about that. Let me just go back a little bit. After I\nleft my parents home, at the age of just barely 18, just after my 18th birthday, in 1941 and\n-- in 1940 -- and went to Berlin to train as a nurse, I did -- I -- I joined the Jewish hospital\nin Berlin, asking immediately to be put onto the kosher side. At that point there was still a\nsmall table of kosher people and actually, I was able to eat kosher throughout those years\nthat I was in -- in the Jewish hospital in Berlin. I don\u2019t think I observed the Sabbath quite\nthe way I -- I should have, but I surely didn\u2019t go out and -- and gallivant around. I may\nhave worked, but I didn\u2019t do anything else. And then when I got to Theresienstadt -- and\nthis 1s all still radiating from my childhood, you see, unquestioningly what ga -- God\ndoes, is the right thing. And then I got to Theresienstadt and then of course the food\nbecame a big problem. And I remember to this day, the struggle I had with myself when I\nfinally decided that I\u2019m going to eat that soup that had those little pieces of -- of sinister\nlooking meat floating around in them. I -- I refused them for a long time, but finally I\nthought maybe I -- I should, in order to keep my strength up. And I remember quite well\nwhat a struggle that was. And after I had decided to do that, I -- I continued to -- to eat\nthat -- that horrible stuff. Whether it did me any good or not, I don\u2019t know. But when I\ngot to Switzerland, I again asked to be put into the kosher contingency. I-I-It didn\u2019t work\nout quite that va - mu -- that way, but I'll tell you about that later. And in Theresienstadt,\nI did continue my -- my nightly prayers. That became a habit, it made me feel good. I\ncould fall asleep easily and I felt it was just very necessary to pray for my people. I knew\nthey weren\u2019t sitting on beds of roses. And I didn\u2019t know where my father was and how he\nwas faring and of course I always prayed that I would see everybody again. And I -- I\nthink that answers your question.",
        "Q: And you talked about a period when you began to shift and you -- as you said, traded\nthr -- places with God and -- and thought about how God needed to be accountable.\nWhen -- about when was that? You said it was when you realized your mother really had\nbeen killed very cruelly. Just approximately the time?",
        "A: Well, I would say -- I would say that was in the 1950\u2019s, when I definitely became\naware that they were not coming back. Up to then, you know how it 1s, 1f you don\u2019t see\nthem die, they are not dead. Oh yes, 6,000,000 were killed, but not my mother and not\nmy sister. And that feeling that the next telephone call is theirs. Or the next person you\nmeet in a party 1s my sister and she had amnesia and she doesn\u2019t know who she 1s and I\nrecognize her and I bring back all the memories. These are the dreams and the hopes and\nthe prayers that you have for a long time, until it finally sinks in that they really are dead.\nAnd I -- I kind of remember too, when -- when that finally happened. When it finally\nsank in. I guess it was when my father remarried. I guess then I finally gave up. But for a\n-- for a long time you -- you just -- you just don\u2019t want to believe that. I -- I\u2019d like to say\nsomething about death as such. Th-The -- my mother, of course, as I have said in my\nprevious interview, was killed in Riga and most probably in -- in the woods in front of\nthe firing squads. And it was a long, long, long, many years before I could say that\nwithout breaking down. And I\u2019m not even sure I can do it now. And my sister -- it\u2019s not\nvery clear to me whether she was killed in -- in Auschwitz or also in front of a firing\nsquad, but again, after I knew all that, I was still hoping maybe they died already in the --\nin the trains, so that they wouldn\u2019t have to -- to do that horrible end. But I wanted to say\nsomething about my father\u2019s death. My father died in 1986, only 12 years ago, at the age\nof 92. And I, at that time was about 65 years old, is that correct? Or 63? Anyway, I was a\n-- certainly a very middle aged woman. And until then, I had not seen a relative of mine\ndie of a natural death. And you know, it was almost a jubilation that I was able to see\nsomeone die naturally. That I -- I -- that I could sit Shiva, that I could all the things that\none does for the dead. And I -- I -- I remember almost a feeling of joy. Of -- of -- of -- of\nfulfillment. It was very strange.",
        "Q: Were you and your father ever able to formally mark your mother\u2019s death in any way?",
        "A: Well, we needed to keep a day for -- for Yahrtzeit, for the observation of the dead and\nat the time, the rabbis said that we could pick any day we wanted to. There was a choice\nof picking their birthdays or the day they were evacuated, or -- or Yom Kippur, which is\ncoming up next week. A lot of people simply keep Yom Kippur. I decided, since my\nhusband\u2019s mother died and we kne -- she died a natural death in Frankfurt and we of\ncourse knew the death date, I decided to s -- to pick that very day and I observe my\nmother\u2019s and my sister\u2019s Yahrtzeit at that particular date and my husband observes not\nonly his mother\u2019s death, who-who he knows and who 1s buried in Frankfurt, but also his\ntwo sisters, with their five children -- six chil -- six children -- that were killed an\nunknown date. And so, at that particular day at my mother-in-law\u2019s day of Yahrtzeit, we\nlight one, two, three, four, five -- we light ten Yahrtzeit lits for the people that we -- for\nthe immediate people that we lost. And that\u2019s how we resolved that particular problem.\nBut did you ask me whether my father and I ever talked about my mother and my sister?\nYou didn\u2019t ask me that, but I --",
        "Q: But I'd like to.",
        "A: Please do. No. And that is a great source of anguish to me. For a long time, I -- I felt\nresentment that my father had left us, actually. I remember the day in August, the first of\nAugu -- no, the last days of -- the first of July in 1939, when he left on a transport to -- to\nEngla-England. And of course we hoped to follow very soon, but then the war came and\nwe were separated, permanently, in my mother\u2019s and sister\u2019s case, not in mine. And I -- I\nremember feeling great resentment against that, which was illogical and uncalled for. But\nagain, feelings are feelings and you ha -- you have to deal with them. And I particularly\nfelt very guilty -- or -- about my mother\u2019s and sister\u2019s death. For some strange reason, I\nthought that I could have saved them, or I could have done -- done something for them,\nor I should have gone with them and be there, too. And my father, apparently never had\nthese feelings. At least, he never voiced them in his long, long life. And to the very end --\nI stayed with him a month before he died, knowing that he would be dying and I hung on\nevery word of his that he still said and I was so hoping that he would say a word of -- of -\n- of explanation or resent -- or regret or sorrow or apology or something. But he didn\u2019t\nand I live with that.",
        "Q: Did you ask about it?",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t have that kind of a relationship. We weren\u2019t brought up to question our\nparents. But I had such a guilt feeling that I actually had to go to a psychiatrist to get rid\nof it. But he apparently had not. And I also resented a little bit -- again, for totally\nillogical, because the man was 45 years old when he was alone, I resented a little bit ha --\nthat he married again. But that was, of course, stupid. But there 1s it.",
        "Q: Di-Did you ever become close with his second wife?",
        "A: No, unfortunately, I didn\u2019t and I\u2019m -- I\u2019m very sorry about that now. Because she too\nlost a husband and two sons in Theresienstadt. And she looked to me for a replacement\nand I just seem -- didn\u2019t seem to understand that. And just the last few years, I -- I really\nfeel that -- that I missed the boat there. That I really could have done a lot better. But, you\nknow, there is a [indecipherable] we had a -- a friend who was from Vienna and he -- he\ndidn\u2019t distinguish himself in any way, he was just a simple fellow, but he will be\nremembered in my family for something he said. And he always said to us, in his heavy\nViennese accent, \u201cYou get too old too soon and too smart, too late.\u201d And how true that 1s.\nI -- I got too smart much too late after my stepmother was long dead, I realized that I -- I\nreally could have done a lot better. Well, that\u2019s one of the things God can call me to task\nfor. And He probably will and He should.",
        "Q: I want to have you think back to right in th-the week or two before you leave\nTheresienstadt and what is your physical state at that point? How are you doing\nphysically and mentally?",
        "A: Well, I was in very good shape. Number one, I was young. And number two, I had\nworked myself up into a nurse\u2019s position 1n -- into a supervisory nurse\u2019s position in the\nchildren home. And that meant I got S ration -- r-ration -- special ration. I had no longer\nto go with my little food pot to -- to the window where they dished out a little ladle of\nsoup and the next one pushed right after me and I had to leave. The soup was now\nbrought to the children\u2019s home and we had enough of that. Also, at that point -- I\u2019m sure I\nspoke of that in my earlier recollections, I -- I had a young man who -- who liked me very\nmuch. It didn\u2019t amount to anything because you know, we had curfew, we couldn\u2019t get\ntogether, but he -- he just adored me. He was the brother of one of the women whose\nbaby was in the nursing home. So he came and he -- he worked in the co -- into -- in the\nconcentration camp\u2019s bakery. And he, from time to time, brought me and my f -- and the\nwoman I lived with, Eva, my girlfriend Eva, bread. And of course that was a lifesaver. It\nreally, really was. And also -- you see, the Swiss people -- the -- I\u2019m sorry, the Czech\npeople that were in Theresienstadt were allowed to get packages and from time to time,\nthe Czech women that we -- we lived with in that basement of ours, below the children\u2019s\nhome, would grudgingly share their apples or their little bits of f-food that they had, with\nus. There was a great divide between the Czech prisoners and us, but once in awhile they\ns -- they had pity on us. So I was in pretty good condition and I was picked because I was\nin good condition. We all -- y-you know the story how I was saved. It was 1200 Jews,\neach one of them had to appear before the Commandant Ram and we were picked for our\nlooks, you see. If we were dehydrated and emaciated, out. So I was number seven -- s -- I\nwas number 1174 and Eva was 1173 and we looked good, so we left. And on the train to\nTheresienstadt, we got all those delicacies that we didn\u2019t even know what they were.\nWho had [indecipherable] -- who had ever seen a banana before? Who knew what a\nsardine looked like? So we gorged ourselves before we even got to Switzerland and in\nSwitzerland -- I do need to say something about the feeling that is still so vivid with me,\nof freedom. Wh-What actually is freedom? Freedom at that point was air that smelled\ngood. Air that you could take in and breathe. And people who were smiling. People on\nthe -- on the station that looked up and smiled at you. People who didn\u2019t wear stars and\nhad nice clothes and stockings on. And mainly, freedom was people in uniform that\ndidn\u2019t hit you. People in uniform that spoke courteously to you. And freedom was\nbeautiful landscape and -- and -- and -- and looking out the window and not being\nshouted at or shot at. And -- and freedom was just a -- a great relief. And also freedom\nwas not to have -- Ill say it in -- not in the negative, but in the positive, freedom was to\nhave lights at night, to have a ci -- a -- a city lit up, you see? I had lived 12 years and six\nof tho -- 12 years in Nazi regime and six of those in war and every night you were taken\nto prison if you had a little light shining through. And here was this Switzerland with all\nthe lights blazing. I couldn\u2019t get over it the first night. Why aren\u2019t they tel -- why aren\u2019t\nthey blacking out their -- it was -- don\u2019t you forget, it was still war. I got to Switzerland\nin February -- 12th, I believe. And the war didn\u2019t end and they had all their lights on.\nThat\u2019s freedom.",
        "Q: At what point did you realize you were free or truly feel free? Was there one moment?",
        "A: That\u2019s a good question. That\u2019s a good question. I think perhaps 1t was when they told\nus to rip off the star and put lipstick on. I don\u2019t recall that particular -- I think it was when\nI looked out the window and saw the people smiling and that was all -- what I have said\nthere in such verbiosity was all just one little moment in my life. We got into\nSwitzerland, th-the SS came thr -- it wasn\u2019t the SS any more, it was the -- the Red Cross\npeople came through, told us to rip off the star and put up -- put on lipstick and we\nopened up the windows. And then the Swiss p -- the Swiss gendarmes in their uniforms\ncame through. I think that was the moment. And they called us nice, with names and\nsmiled and -- and asked what we wanted and we looked -- I remember that, looking out\nthe window, so we would le -- Eva and I -- Eva and I were inseparable at that point and\nPll have something to say about that in a moment. But I remember we let down the\nwindow and looked out and we smelled that air and -- of course, I\u2019m repeating myself,\nbut that was -- I think that was the moment. I -- I wanted to just say something about Eva\nand I being so inseparable and it ties in with the questions about religion that you asked\nbefore. Eva was not religious and she opted -- wh-when we got to Sengale and we had a\nlist of -- of so -- so-called concentration hotels that we could request and she wanted to\ngo to Les Auvants, there were others who off -- other ki -- hotels or places that offered\nkosher food, which I would have chosen. But she wanted so much to go to Les Auvants\nand I did not want to lose her, that I went to Les Auvants with her. And I remember that I\n-- that I didn\u2019t eat the meat then any more, because I was so close to my old rabbi again.\nBut anyway, I didn\u2019t stay in Les Auvants very long and -- and then I went to an old friend\nof mine from -- from the city of Kissingin, that I found in Lucerne. And there again, you\nsee, Kissinger 1s named because he came from that city of Kissingin, where I had a close\nfriend. And when this friend of mine from -- formerly from Kissingin whose name was --\nwas Truda Lustig at the time, but who had married a Swiss guy by the name of Erelinger.\nWhen she heard that I was in that Les Auvants transport, she immediately requested that I\ncome to her home and there I was completely rehabilitated to Kashrut and Shomair\nShabbat and the whole bit. Oh, what a story.",
        "Q: I -- I want to go back, actually, to the train. And I believe in your -- in your previous\ninterview, you mentioned that an SS officer walked through and he said something --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- behave and say nice things --",
        "A: And think -- think of us with nice thoughts. Think of us kindly. What a farce. Oh, you\nremembered that from my interview? I remember it, too. Remember that we treated you\nnicely. What a farce. But we were so taken up with our own emotions, oh, the heck with\nhim.",
        "Q: Were you frightened at all when he said something like that? Did you feel that perhaps\nthe arm of the SS, if you didn\u2019t say the right thing, could follow you?",
        "A: You know, you -- you know, you are asking a very good question and I need to come\nback to that later. Because we were frightened, we thought the SS were reaching -- we --\nwe had been living in fear for 12 years. In fear for our possessions and our lives and our\npeople. Fear doesn\u2019t go away the minute you open a window and smell freedom. So, yes,\nI would say we did. But I -- I -- let\u2019s be sure that I say something about that fear that had\nrepercussions to this very day. I'll -- Pll -- I'll say it later, you had some other questions,\ndidn\u2019t you? Perhaps I\u2019d better say it now, because 1-it does fit into the fear business.\nWhen we got to Les Auvants, after he had told us to remember him kindly, I forgot that.\nConsciously I forgot it, but very obviously, sub-consciously I didn\u2019t, because when we\ngot to Les Auvants, one of the first things I needed to do, was to write down things from\nthe past 12 years. I don\u2019t know what the other people did, but I si-simply had this -- this -\n- this need to get rid of all this. You see, here -- here I came out of Theresienstadt into\nthis luxury hotel with all the food I wanted, with that view in front of me and I needed a\ntransition. And so I asked for a typewriter and -- and some paper, which I got and I\nstayed in my room for several days and just catharsis. And -- and then I met -- how I met\nDr. Clay, I do not remember. I think I met him through Eli Munck. I met -- I met a man\nby the name of Dr. Clay, who was an official with the Swedish embassy -- embassy, I\nbelieve. He -- he was high up. And when he heard that I had written things down, he\nwanted it. And I let him have a copy of everything I wrote, with the condition that he not\nuse my name. I still have his letter -- I can show it to you, where he answers me that he\nwill of course honor my request. He would like to publish what I wrote, but he will not\nname me, Gerda Schild, by name. Now, in the 19 -- late 1980\u2019s or even 90\u2019s, I read a\nbook -- I forgot the name of the author, we can look it up, by the title \u201cStella\u201d, a famous\nbook where a -- a Berlin -- a survivor of the Holocaust who stayed in Berlin, one of the\nhidden Jews, writes about Berlin. And I read this book with such intensity, because I was\nthere. He talks about street corners where I lived and places where I was. And I come\nacross a section in the book that was my voice. I -- I could -- I could tell, 1t was -- I said\nthat. It was the story of when the nurses came to -- were taken to the Kasalen to help\nthese people a-at the Fabric transport. And here I am reading, and I said to my husband,\n\u201cThis is my story.\u201d And I go quick and I see -- I see where he got this from, he -- it\u2019s a\nvery well documented book. I forgot his name, I can look it up. And he -- he documents\nmy story, anonymous nurse from Berlin and I -- I look and see where he got it from and\nby God, he got it out of the publication of Dr. Clay from Geneva. I wrote to him and I\ndocumented -- I wrote him a copy of that letter where Dr. Clay said he will publish it, but\nwithout a name and I was really hoping to hear from, but he never answered. He never\nanswered and that was, of course, at least six or seven years ago. But, you see, that\u2019s how\nthe ripple of fear goes to -- to 1990. Here I realized -- and this document of Dr. Clay, I\nsee by his notes -- by his footnotes, is in the librar -- in th -- in the library -- in the\nnational library of Paris, the French National Library of Paris. Isn\u2019t that some story? I had\ngoosebumps when I read that. But the interesting thing is that I kept the Clay letter, that I\nknow that is my story without my name.",
        "Q: Other experiences of fear, for instance, when you were stopped at the train station\nfrom visiting Rabbi Munck --",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: What was your reaction to the people in uniform stopping you and they took you?",
        "A: I know it. I don\u2019t know -- I don't remember. I think it was mostly -- well, I -- I don\u2019t\nrecall that, actually. I -- I do not recall. Some feelings have fallen through the cracks,\nbecause there were other things that were important. The important thing was to see\nMunck. How I felt, I don\u2019t recall. I must have felt embarrassment. I -- I -- I\u2019m sorry, I just\ndon\u2019t recall it. I only remember being taken back by two -- between two Swiss uniformed\npolicemen. It was terrible. And being put into that cell -- that Grand Hotel prison. It was\nterrible. I don\u2019t remember what I felt.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nGerda Haas. This is tape number two, side A. Okay. Did anyone ever debrief you about\nyour experience?",
        "A: What do you mean?",
        "Q: You ce -- well, you certainly wrote down things that had happened, but when you got\nto Switzerland, did the Red Cross people interview you or ask you what had happened to\nyou?",
        "A: No, never. I don\u2019t think we would have told them much, either. We didn\u2019t feel -- w-we\nwere very afraid. We were -- freedom had to grow on us very slowly. And that\u2019s why I --\nthat\u2019s what I like so much on this country. Freedom 1s their birthright. They don\u2019t even\nquestion it. I like that and that\u2019s why things lik -- like that can\u2019t happen here. And I -- I --\nI always could see it when I was speaking to classes. They ask such -- such unbelievable\nquestions like after I told them my whole story, how we\u2019re driven out of our home and\neverything, \u201cWhy did you have to leave? It was your house.\u201d God bless them, they have\nfreedom written all over them. You see? But we had to grow into that feeling of that very\nslowly.",
        "Q: Do you remember any other occurrences during those first weeks and months where\nyou censored yourself? Where you found that you didn\u2019t talk about what had happened?\nOr that you felt afraid, I guess is what I\u2019m asking.",
        "A: I think so. I think we were afraid. D-During the first few months, I think my thoughts\nta -- all clustered around the people that were still missing. I s -- checked every list I\ncould get ahold of to see 1f my mother and sister would -- would be there. And I needed\nto find my father, I had no address for him. He had left for England, but then he was\nfurther evacuated to the United States. And we had written to each other while I was still\nin Munich and Berlin, but not any more in Theresienstadt. And so I -- I wrote to the Red\nCross to s -- to see where -- what his address was, but before the Red Cross answered, he\nalready had found my name on the list of those 1200 that had gone to Switzerland. And\nagain, through the Red Cross, he sent me a telegram with his address and then he sent\nmoney and food and it was just wonderful. But to you quest -- specifically to your\nquestion, I think -- I -- I would say with certainty now, that our thoughts were forward\nand not backward. I\u2019d gotten rid of it all, \u2019'd written it down. D-Don\u2019t forget, I was like\n22 or 23 or 24 years old. I -- I wanted to live. I wanted to have nice clothes and I wanted\nto have a boyfriend and I wanted to go out and -- and I -- I was looking forward. I guess\nit\u2019s human nature. I wanted to know where my people were and then I wanted to go on\nliving. And I did. I did.",
        "Q: How soon -- how soon after your liberation did you hear from your father?",
        "A: Oh, I would say within -- within a month, I would say. Because those lists were\nimmediately publicized. Don\u2019t you know it was one of the conditions that Himmler set?\nHe said h-he wanted money and he wanted good publicity in American papers and by\ngosh, he got it. I don\u2019t know if it was good publicity, but he got publicity. The list was\npublished and my father told me later -- he\u2019d by then had a little butcher shop again in --\nin New York, that\u2019s all he knew. He -- all he knew was -- he had no education, so again\nhe opened a little butcher shop and he said one of his customers came in with the New\nYork Times list and he said, \u201cSiegfried, ist dusnich stanna tauter? Gerda Schild?\u201d And he\nlooked at it and said, \u201cYes, that\u2019s my daughter.\u201d And then he immediately -- somebody\nhelped him to ask the Red Cross where to send the letter to and I heard from him\nimmediately then.",
        "Q: What did that first telegraph say?",
        "A: Ah, it was great. And I remember it. I still have it. It said, \u201cWhere -- where 1s mother\nand -- and sister? Where -- how come you are alive?\u201d You know, \u201cWhere are the others?\u201d\nHe gave me quite a gui -- a guilt feeling then, too. I -- I never was on really intimate\nterms with him because I -- it was like a monolith sitting between us, unspoken. But it\nwas always there. And, in addition to it, I always labored throughout my childhood,\nunder the impression or certainty, I don\u2019t know, that he liked my sister more than me. So,\nyou know -- but that\u2019s why I spent the months with him before his death, to see if he\ncouldn\u2019t say a word of love to me, but he never did. He never did, it was not in him. He\nnever, never did. It was too bad, but I\u2019m over it. So, what was your question?",
        "Q: What did you write back?",
        "A: Oh, I cabled him, but it was a prepaid cable, you see, one of those things. At that\npoint, incidentally, I was as good as engaged to an old boyfriend from home, you see,\nthat again was one of those like arranged marriages and he was here, also, so in the first --\nin the first cable that he sent me and he said that he was okay and that this boyfriend of\nmine, whose name was Lothar, good German name again -- it shows you how integrated\nwe were in Germany, we all had German names. Nobody was called a Hebrew or an\nIsraeli name, this was unheard of. So anyway, this Lothar also wanted to know that I was\nsafe and I was ha -- very happy and so I cabled back, with love to both these men, my\nfather and -- and this young man, Lothar. And I cabled back that I didn\u2019t know where my\nmother and sister was. And I have that telegram too, because my father saved everything\nand gave it to me afterwards.",
        "Q: Now, when had this match been made? At what point?",
        "A: Oh, it was -- it was really not such a terrible match. It was, you know -- you know, the\nyoung ladies -- young girls in -- in Germany weren\u2019t allowed to -- to have boyfriends or\nanything. But this boy, he liked me very much. He lived in Nuremberg and he came to\nAnspach all the time to -- to -- so to say, visit his relatives, but he really came to visit me.\nAnd we had, you know, one of those very innocent, very naive romances. Even so -- oh, I\nwas very young then, I was maybe 15 or 16 and he wasn\u2019t much older. And the only way\nthat I was allowed to at all go out with him was that my parents said to themselves,\n\u201cWell, he\u2019ll marry her eventually.\u201d Oh, that was the whole shooting match. He liked me\nenough to really wanted to marry me and he came -- must I tell you all this? On the day\nof my engagement to my husband, he came to the door with roses and a little package.\nVery obviously he was going to ask me that day to marry him. So he was more serious\nthan I. But at that point I had already given my hand and heart to Rudy Haas.",
        "Q: Was he somebody you thought about then, when you were in Theresienstadt?",
        "A: Yes, I did -- I did.",
        "Q: Lothar.",
        "A: Lothar, yes, I thought of him a great deal. Why? It gave me like a -- like a -- a little\nstring to hang on to. It wasn\u2019t like a lifeline or anything like that, but you know, you\ncouldn\u2019t think about the camp all the time and death and dying and Auschwitz and the\ngas chambers. So you thought of other things. You thought of pleasant things in your\nformer life. You see, in Theresienstadt, everything was the former life, but in\nSwitzerland, zoom to outer space, to future.",
        "Q: So you had found your father and tell us again what you had -- or h-how you had\nlooked for your mother. What were the opportunities available for how you could look\nfor your mother and your sister?",
        "A: Well, in Theresienstadt, I looked for them at all the incoming transports, because at\nthat point, I -- I really hoped that somehow they would show up, too, as I had. I -- I had\nno reason to be in Theresienstadt, 1t was God\u2019s gift to me that I was there. As you know,\nit was only for old people and war veterans and very distinguished, prominent Jews and\nMishlinger. So wa -- was -- how did I get there? So, I thought, as long as I got there,\nmaybe my sister and my mother would get there, too. So I screened -- I was living in the\nbar -- in the barracks that overlooked the -- the railroad -- the mouth of the railroad and I\nwas always looking for them. And then when I got to Switzerland, the only way was to\ncall the Red Cross and ask for them, yeah.",
        "Q: Did you find yourself, 1f you met someone who\u2019d been to Riga, let\u2019s say, asking them,\nor were there other ways you could look, or --",
        "A: Not in Theresienstadt. Nobody from Riga came to Theresienstadt. But I had a distant\ncousin who was in Riga and who was saved also and I met her in -- in New York again.\nShe was actually the only person I ever met from Riga. And, of course nobody saw my\nmother, because they were killed the minute they got there.",
        "Q: Well, how did you eventually determine that?",
        "A: Simply by transport. I looked it up in the -- in the Yad Vashem books. I knew the date\nof her transport, it was -- 1t was se -- it was nov -- how could I forget this? I think it was\nNovember, 1940. No, 1941. Yes, it wa -- no, it was September 1941. Anyway, I knew the\ndate and I don\u2019t know how I could forget it at this point and I looked that transport up,\nfrom Munich to Riga and the fate of the transport is written in very plain language. They\nwere immediately shot upon arrival, the whole transport.",
        "Q: When did you finally do that?",
        "A: When I found that out?",
        "Q: Looked -- looked -- looked it up?",
        "A: Oh, that was when we first visited Yad Vashem. It wasn\u2019t so long ago, maybe in the --\nin the 70\u2019s. Yeah, I would say in the 70\u2019s. But I didn\u2019t know that when I met this girl. But\nI know now why she never met my mother and she would have -- she would have seen\nher. She -- we were relatives.",
        "Q: So 1-in terms of your mother and your sister, there were sort of incremental periods of\nacceptance? In other words, of their death.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: You said that when your father remarried, you really began to think, well my mother\nis dead?",
        "A: Is dead, mm-hm.",
        "Q: But in fact, you never knew exactly what happened until the 70\u2019s?",
        "A: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s correct. That\u2019s very correct and -- and the mind plays tricks on\nyou, too. The mind thinks, oh, it can\u2019t be. You -- you -- you see, that\u2019s the advantage of\nthe Jewish ob -- ritual of -- of mourning. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a finite kind of thing.\nYou grieve, you get it over with and you go on with your life. If you don\u2019t have that, they\nare not dead. You don\u2019t have a grave, you don\u2019t have a date, you never sat Shiva.\nAnyway --",
        "Q: What ki -- tell us a little bit more about the contact you were having with your father,\naf-after the initial letters where he asks ab-about your mother and sister, when does --\ndoes he begin to propose the idea that you would go to the United States?",
        "A: Oh yes, that -- well, there was never a question about that, that was -- that was the aim\nof both of us. And it took awhile. I went to the home of my -- of my friend in Lucerne,\nwhere I stayed another six months. It took a whole year before I could -- more than a year\nbefore I could emigrate to the United States. The war didn\u2019t end and the -- the -- the -- the\nAmerican quota system was still from 1914. It was only after the war that they changed it\nand the war board finally acknowledged that -- that we could come over. The Swiss\nneeded to get rid of us. The Swiss were not hospitable, you see. The Swiss took us with\nthe under -- I studied this after -- when I wrote my first book, I studied very closely jus-\njust what happened. And the condition that they made with -- with -- with Himmler and\nMuzi and the -- and the Vad har salah, which I have talked about in my previous\nvideotaping, was that the -- the refugees did not stay in Switzerland. Absolutely not. And\nas soon as we could, we left. And then they handed us a bill for our stay at the hotel,\nwhich was -- is really something. But my father gladly paid it, I\u2019m sure. But no, he did\neverything he could also, to get me over. And we saw each other again in -- just -- just\nduring the Passover holidays of 1946. I arrived by ship and he, being a very religious\nman, did not come to pick me up. He stayed in that place where he -- he went to Boston, I\narrived in Boston. And he had been settled in New York. And he had asked someone -- I\nguess from the -- from the Joint or something to pick me up. He did not consecrate the\nholiday to drive to pick me up. I -- I didn\u2019t question that at the time. I -- I really didn\u2019t. I\nwas so glad to be there and I consecrated the holiday by going in -- with that person who\npicked me up, I don\u2019t remember who she was. And my father had asked someone to take\nhim and me in and we stayed there for the holidays. And th-the -- the predominant\nremembrance of seeing my father again, he came down the stairs and I was at the bottom\nof the stairs, coming in the front door and the -- the -- the -- the main impression that\nstayed with me was that he looked just the way I remembered him. Young and vibrant\nand black hair and nicely dressed. After I had gone through so much, I expected him to --\nto had also gone through so much and be an old, white-haired, little old -- the Jewish\nman. But he wasn\u2019t. He was a young, vibrant man and we took it from there.",
        "Q: And certainly many people that you had been living with and seeing for the past 12\nyears --",
        "A: Had changed.",
        "Q: -- they had been through so much and",
        "A: -- had changed, yes, had changed very much. I guess I hadn\u2019t changed really, either,\nbecause I wasn\u2019t really in a killing camp. I was real-really not that badly off after I heard\nhow everybody else had suffered. I wanted to say something about living with my friend\nin Lucerne and that goes to the point I have made before, that the Holocaust governs my\nwhole life. So in Lucerne, in 1945, when I was rescued and my friend took me in, I took\ncare of her two little kids so that she could go to work. I was like an au pair, you know?\nAnd that was a very happy time, it was a vibrant, Jewish, religious family. And Rosh\nHashanah came and always the -- the husband brought home stray people from the\nsynagogue to have holidays with -- with the family. And, you know, I helped in the\nkitchen, I was st -- you know, I was busy with the whole affairs and I didn\u2019t pay too\nmuch attention whom he brought home. He brought home some American soldiers that\nyear, 1945, to celebrate the Rosh Hashanah holiday with him. Now I am going to 1985,\nAO years later and I\u2019m -- I\u2019m teaching elder hostel at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine\nand I -- I am teaching the Holocaust, upon the request of elder hostel. And I have my -- I\ntal -- taught that for 10 years. It was a very successful course and I -- I have very good\nmemories of telling people what the Holocaust was all about. Not just what I\u2019d gone\nthrough, but the -- the historical background, I -- I started with anti-Semitism in Germany\nand --and how Hitler at all got to power and -- and somehow, within that two week\ncourse, naturally, I legitimized myself and said that I was there, too, and how I had been\nsaved and went to Switzerland and how I had stayed with this Erelinger family. And in\none of my courses, one white haired man gets up and he says to me, \u201cYou state you were\nvery religious at the time and you went to America and you married a physician, didn\u2019t\nyou?\u201d And I was completely taken aback and I said, \u201c\u201cWho are you?\u201d And he was one of\nthe soldiers that Erelinger brought home. And I had corresponded with him, I had a little\nbit of a romance with this handsome soldier, he took me out and you know. And I had\nrome -- I had co-corresponded with him and I had told him, \u201cSorry, I got to stop this\nnow, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m getting married next week to this young doctor.\u201d So he recognized me\nfrom what I told him.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: His name was Segal -- Larry Segal. And I corresponded -- he -- he went home and\nfound some of the letters I wrote. The Holocaust just stretched out it\u2019s tentacles\nthroughout my life. There was never any getting away from it.",
        "Q: Would you have liked to have gotten away from it?",
        "A: No. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- 1t shaped my personality. I taught the Holocaust, I wrote papers, I\nwrote two books, I -- I gave lectures and I was able to found the Holocaust Human Rights\nCenter of Maine, which I\u2019m very gratified for. And I -- I was a member of the state Board\nof Education because -- in Maine, because of my experiences. What does education mean\nto you, that you didn\u2019t have it, you see? And it -- it -- 1t governed my life. It -- 1t governed\nmy children\u2019s lives too, but we can talk about that later.",
        "Q: As you are waiting to leave and go to the United States, what are your thoughts about\nleaving Europe, especially when at this point you still do not really know about your\nmother and your sister? Do you have misgivings about actually, physically leaving or did\nyou think that you could still trace them from the United States?",
        "A: No, I had no qualms about leaving at all. I remember the train that took us from\nBaushawitz, which is from Theresienstadt, to Saint Gallen, went through Nuremberg and\nby -- by implication, 1t grazed Anspach and there was always this -- this happy moment\nin former years, when we were on the train, we could see the roof of our house, going\nthrough Anspach. And I remember that I didn\u2019t even want to look. Out -- out -- out, I\nwanted to go. Nothing kept me there, nothing at all. Yeah, that was something. I do want\nto say 1s something about leaving Berlin, actually. I -- no, I -- I can\u2019t recall now what I\nwanted to say. Ask me something.",
        "Q: Okay. Think back to the -- several days before you are preparing to leave.",
        "A: To leave Theresienstadt?",
        "Q: No. I\u2019m talking now about leaving Switzerland and preparing to go to the United\nStates.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Ho -- What -- was it difficult to get all these papers in order? Were you doing it or was\nyour father? The visa, the --",
        "A: Yes, I know what you\u2019re asking me. Oh no, that went like in a trance, everybody\nhelped. The Erelinger family, my father. Lothar sent part of the affidavit and -- and the\nSwiss helped, of course, coaxing me along. It was nothing compared to the difficulties\nthat are -- are branded in my brains that we had to go through trying to get out of\nGermany, you see? And that is something I can\u2019t forget either and my mother\u2019s letters,\nwhich I still have, are filled with that. She says, \u201cEvery day I look for the mail and I\nthink, there must be an affidavit for me now.\u201d And then she had to wait hours and hours\nat the Jewish communities in Munich to -- to get a number and she never got one and to\nget [indecipherable] finally she had the number, then she had to wait hours and hours at\nthe Hapak to get a -- a ship\u2019s passage and just terrible. Just terrible. But finally, she -- she\ngave up. She didn\u2019t give up, she was taken away. No, compared to that, getting out of\nSwitzerland was a breeze. And of course there were no airplanes at the time, so I went in\na -- in a boat. That was a very happy boat ride.",
        "Q: T-Tell us about the boat --",
        "A: Oh yes --",
        "Q: -- what it looked like, who was on it --",
        "A: -- I -- Ire -- it was the SS Mulholland and of course I was ready to fall in love with\nevery person I saw, especially Americans. And by then I was already very -- very much\nmy old self again. And I remember that one of the ship\u2019s officers showed me, for the first\ntime, a Life Magazine, with that glossy picture of some pretty woman on the -- on the\nfront, I don\u2019t recall who it was and I remember he\u2019s saying to me, \u201cYou could be on that\ncover yourself.\u201d So, apparently, at that time, I was already quite nice looking again. And\nof course, I was glowing with anticipation of going to America after we had struggled so\nterribly. America, it was like -- like -- like a rainbow in the sky. It\u2019s something that you\njust -- you see, but you can\u2019t touch, so I was actually going there and I remember asking\nhim lots and lots of questions. And then he showed me that magazine and tried to tell me\na little about America. It was nice.",
        "Q: What did you tell him about yourself?",
        "A: Oh, nothing. Nothing, nothing. I didn\u2019t talk about the -- the concentration camp for a\nlong time. I remember when my father took me to New York then and people came to\nvisit -- I remember so clearly, one old lady said to me, \u201cSo tell us already, a little bit\nabout the concentration camp.\u201d And I was simply horrified. I looked at my father and I\nsaid, \u201cPapa,\u201d ca -- you know, like get me out of this. So he tried to change the subject.\nOh, there was no way I could have opened my mouth about it at all. Not for a long, long\ntime. I had nightmares about it constantly, but I never could talk about it. And except for\nthat strange Jewish old lady, nobody really wanted to know. Nobody wanted to know. I\nremember when I spoke for the very first time at a group --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B.",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nGerda Haas. This is tape number two, side B.",
        "A: Iremember, when I finally got myself to speak about my experiences -- oh, it -- it\ncouldn\u2019t even have been my own, maybe it was just generalization about the Holocaust, I\n-- | remember -- and that was very much later, that was, I would say, in the 1960\u2019s or\neven -- yeah, in the 1960\u2019s, that was in Maine and I spoke to a B\u2019nai Brith group of\nwomen in somebody\u2019s home. And here -- and was very difficult for me to get up and\nspeak for the first time. And next to me or in front of me sat one of the women -- I knew\nall the women, they were from town and one of them pulled out her knitting and started\nto knit. And me being so nervous, I said to her, \u201cAre you going to knit through my whole\ntalk? Am I going to, you know, hear that clappering of the needles all through the talk?\u201d\nNumber one, it showed me that she really didn\u2019t care what I was going to say. And\nnumber two, it -- it -- it -- 1t did make me even more nervous. And I remember her\nanswering, \u201cIf it\u2019s interesting, I\u2019m going to stop.\u201d So you see the -- the people didn\u2019t\nreally care. This was a Jewish woman, a young Jewish woman. And I started to talk and I\nnoticed that she stopped and she didn\u2019t knit any more. And f-from then on it became a\nlittle bit easier for me to talk. And it be-became more the thing to do to ask me to talk.\nThen, after the B\u2019nai Brith, then every other local organization wanted me to talk, then\nthe churches came in, the schools. And it became easier and easier. But there was a\ndefinite bar. There was a definite high hurdle that I had to overcome and that the listeners\nhad to overcome. And once that hurdle was passed, then things were okay.",
        "Q: After you left Theresienstadt and perhaps you\u2019re still 1n Switzerland or you\u2019re in the\nUnited States, did you see any photographs of -- these very famous photographs that\nwere coming out, of when the United States and the British troops liberated the camps,\nthe -- did you see these at all and what were your reactions?",
        "A: I -- one of the most unforgettable moments in my life is when I saw the photographs\nfor the first time and it was in a moviehouse. You recall, in years gone by, the first thing\nthey always showed was the -- the -- the -- the newsreel. And I did see one of those\nAuschwitz photographs for the first time. And maybe that was the moment when I\nbelieved that my mother and sister were dead. And 1-it was horrible. And also for the first\ntime, I heard the phrase like -- like animals to the slaughter, from the rabbi in Lewiston,\nMaine at -- at one of his Rosh Hashanah sermons. And I was terribly shocked. That was\nlong before I was able to talk and long before people wanted to listen. But, you know, it\nstarted creeping along and there was no way of holding it back. It was like water lapping\nthe shore and then -- then the whole flood finally came.",
        "Q: When was that that you saw the newsreel? Where were you?",
        "A: Oh, that must have been -- that must have been -- I was married and had one child, so\nth -- I would say that it was 1948 - \u201c49 - \u201850 maybe, at least -- at last. \u00b048 - \u201849, I would\nsay.",
        "Q: So you saw the newsreel not right when it came out, then?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t even want to. I was very busy putting my life together. Having a -- a -- a\nfianc\u00e9 and -- and a husband and the baby and the house and being able to keep all those\nthings. Nobody was taking them away from me. It was quite something. My nightmares\nwere terrible, but my days were heaven. The nightmares, interestingly enough, never -- I\nnever dream about my mother or my sister. I think about them a lot, but I n -- I never\ndream about them. The nightmares are always that the Nazis are coming to take my\nchildren and the life I have now. Very strange. But they\u2019re letting off a little bit now. I\nstill have them. Now, I have nightmares about the grandchildren. My last nightmare was\nthe Nazis were coming and my little granddaughter said, \u201cOh, I want to run upstairs and\nget my party dress.\u201d Yeah... But that was at least a year ago, so I haven\u2019t had one for\nawhile. I always wake up in a cold sweat with a -- with fibrillations afterwards. One of\nthe more satisfying moments of my life was when I was able to give a deposition against\nAlois Brunner. I saw a little notice in one of the Jewish papers that people who knew the\nSS man Brunner should come forward and -- and give a deposition to -- at -- in Boston. I\nwas still living in Maine at the time. And I called that number and I said, \u201cI remember\nBrunner only too well and I\u2019m quite ready to give a deposition.\u201d Nothing became of it.\nThe Syrians didn\u2019t release him, even so he -- he -- he was quite guilty.",
        "Q: Where had you known him?",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "Q: Where had you known him?",
        "A: Yes, he -- he was -- he was one of the key figures in -- in Berlin when we were taken\nfrom the hospital to the -- to the Jewish community and were told that from now on, we\nwere the agents of our own destruction. We jolly well could pick up our own Jews, the\nSS didn\u2019t have to do that dirty work any more. And that we could -- that we could do\nduty in the -- on the trains ourselves, so the SS wouldn\u2019t have to do all that hard work of\nherding the people into the -- into the -- into the -- into the freight trains. That was\nBrunner. And then he stayed for awhile in Berlin and I remember it very well. I wrote it\nall down and you have that on record. But I don\u2019t know if I told then that I -- I had been\nable to give a def -- deposition, that was much later. I was very glad to do that, it was a\nlong, long deposition. The interesting thing is that the German counsel who -- who took\nthe deposition heard some of the things for the first time. So I was very happy about that.",
        "Q: Was it -- did you have to overcome your own fear to go do that?",
        "A: No, that was much later. That was much, much later. I wasn\u2019t very comfortable, but it\nseemed necessary to do that.",
        "Q: I want to go back chronologically to you being on the ship.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And you befriended this officer and he\u2019s told you some about America. Do you -- can\nyou tell us about your first glimpses of New York?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, I can. I can. My father had met me in Boston and after the holiday was\nover, we traveled by train to New York and then he took a taxi from the train station to --\nto his home up in Washington Heights and of course I kept looking out of the taxi\nwindow the whole time. It seemed difficult to see the tops of the buildings. I had never\nseen a skyscraper before and I was completely aghast at those. But what even impressed\nme more were the black people. At that time they were still called Negroes and what I\ncouldn\u2019t get over was the colors they wore. Green and purple and -- and red and blue.\nLoud, loud colors. I hadn\u2019t seen colors for a long, long time. Everything was drab for 12\nyears. Black and gray and -- and green, the Nazi uniforms and -- and that was about it.\nNobody wore colors. And here I saw these black people -- first of all, the black color\nalready, was striking. I hadn\u2019t seen a black person before. And then their hair was dark\nand I had only seen blonde. And then they had these -- these -- these rainbow colors on\nthem, dresses and shoes and fingernails. Everything was blazing. I was very taken aback\nby that. And then we got into the house -- my father took me in and of course the\napartments were so different, too. And the people were different, it was -- it was difficult\nat first, it was very difficult.",
        "Q: Wh-What was -- what was difficult?",
        "A: Well, I was still halfway -- half-halfway 1-1n my former life and now I had all this --\nthis to cope with, thi -- 1t -- I think it was difficult and I was still waiting -- I still felt\nguilty and I was still waiting for my family. And it was a turmoil. It was a -- it -- it was --\nis a tumultuous time. Feelings were impinging on me that I -- and impressions that I -- I\ncouldn\u2019t -- that I couldn\u2019t digest right away so quickly and -- and -- and pigeonhole.",
        "Q: What did your father -- tell us about your meeting. I sort of skipped that, but what did\nyour father say to you when he first saw you?",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall. I don\u2019t recall. I don\u2019t remember that. I think we didn\u2019t talk about the\npast at all. He was, of course, settled by then and he was very proud of himself to have\npulled up a little butcher store out of -- out of nothing in -- in New York, America and he\nwas making a living and h-he was extreme -- he showed me his door, and -- and I\nremember he gave a -- a religious object to his synagogue in gratitude that I was saved.\nAnd the rabbi welcomed me from the -- from the podium in one of -- in his speech when\nI first came to synagogue. That was unheard of, I was terribly embarrassed. And I -- I\ndon\u2019t recall much about that... The name of the man who wrote the book, \u201cStella\u201d is\nPeter Wyden, Peter W-y-d-e-n. Simon and Schuster, 1992. And my documentation is in\nSumlongin, Dr. Hans Clay manuscript, CDJCXX70, Santre de document mon taisson\njuivre contemporare Pari. Anonymous parishta Annabelina Crankensfesta. And they were\npicked up by Gerhard Shernbrenner and were included in his -- in his book, \u201cVere haben\nesska sayen.\u201d And that\u2019s where this Wyden picked it up. If that\u2019s important or not, I don\u2019t\nknow. But still in -- okay.",
        "Q: Well Gerda, we were speaking about you first getting to the United States.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Can you describe the apartment that your father took you to, that he lived in?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And also the neighborhood, please.",
        "A: Yes, yes, I surely can. He took me to 719 179th Street. The building is now razed,\nbecause it made room for -- actually for -- for the bus terminal, that big bus terminal on\n179th Street. And it was a very strange -- 1-in Washington Heights, that\u2019s in New York,\nbut in the Washington Heights section. And it was a very strange building for me. I had\nonly known buildings where you walk in and you\u2019re in the living room and dining room\nand the kitchen and out the door into the garden and upstairs were the bedrooms. Well,\nthis was an apartment building where a whole city lived. You walked in and you had to\ntake the elevator up to the sixth floor and then you were confronted by long, dark, usually\nsmelly corridors and from the corridor, on each side, doors entered. And little did I know\nthat every single door was a whole apartment in itself. I\u2019d never seen a construction at --\nlike that. In fact I -- I tried to explain it to one of my friends 1n letters and they couldn\u2019t\npicture it at all, either. So anyway, we went through a door, number 6B, I think. And\nthere, al-all of a sudden, it opened up into a re-regular apartment. But you just couldn\u2019t\ntell that from that dark corridor. So here we were and of course the Mezuzah was on the\ndoor and everything was right away. Then when I came in, all the people hugged me and\n[indecipherable] me. There was -- my father was living with an old cousin, whose\nhusband had just died and his brother. His brother and he, I think she had one bedroom\nand the cousin and her husband had shared the second bedroom and fortunately the\nhusband just died so that I could have the other bed. Otherwise, I don\u2019t where I would\nhave slept. But how God arranges things for me is just miraculous, really. So I re -- I\nremember -- of course that -- the ca -- the husband of that cousin absolutely meant\nnothing to me. I never met the guy, he was ages old, deaf and blind and ready to die. I\nhad never even heard his name. But he died when I was still in Switzerland and my father\n-- who by that time corresponded with me regularly -- didn\u2019t tell me about his death and\nonly told me on the train from Boston to New York that the cousin had died. And he said\nhe didn\u2019t want to tell me that because I had been surrounded by so much death and dying\nthat he didn\u2019t want to upset me any more. I think that gives you an idea of -- of how they\nregarded us. We were like -- like fragile, ethereal things that you mustn\u2019t upset and -- and\ndon\u2019t tell them anything bad, they\u2019ve gone through bad enough. And that was very weird.\n[ -- | -- I still -- still remember that, he was afraid to tell me that this anonymous cousin of\nmine had died. Anyway, I had a good time sleeping in his bed.",
        "Q: Was there some sort of celebration when you came in [indecipherable]",
        "A: Not right away. On that Shabbat -- you see, that was a very -- very religious\ncommunity. Perhaps I better say a little bit about the community, so you understand what\nit was like. In a way, it was almost like coming back to Germany. First of all, nobody\nspoke English, they were all -- also, they\u2019d all tried very hard to learn the language and\nthey eventually did and they all aspired to be citizens and of course they all were. But\namong themselves, they lived still way back in their little German villages. The gossip\nwas tremendous. Everything was word of mouth. They all went to synagogue, of course,\nin their best clothes and at synagogue, if -- if you didn\u2019t say \u201cGood Shabbas\u201d\u2019 to\nsomebody, he was insulted with you for the whole week. And it was such a narrow\nminded, such a petty little community, that I, who had gone through so much, just -- I -- I\nwas aghast. And everybody watched everybody else, that they did everything right and\nwhether they had a new hat on for Rosh Hashanah. And one person said she\u2019s not going\nto synagogue because she couldn\u2019t afford to buy a new hat. So I say, \u201cGo in the old hat.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you can\u2019t do that, the people will talk about you.\u201d It was such a narrow minded,\nsuch a pi-pitiful community. They had -- you see, they had all emigrated before Hitler\nreally did his job and so they knew nothing of the hardship we would go through. And so\nthey transferred all their pettiness and all their parochialism and all their pedestrianism to\nthis beautiful city and they just lived within that gorgeous city, still in their old, little\nhometown of -- of maybe 2,000 people. Was weird. I had a hard time fitting in. And\neverybody gossiped about everybody else and was not for me. I was glad my husband\ntook me out of there.",
        "Q: What do you think in your experience made you less tolerant of that kind of --",
        "A: Oh, who cares whether you had a new hat? And who cares if you wore a nice diamond\npin or not? But if they couldn\u2019t catch up -- and -- and my -- my stepmother was -- fell\nright into that. Although she too had lost people, she too was in Theresienstadt, she\nworked in the glimmer factory, her hands off and -- and she had gone through just as\nmuch as I did. But as soon as she married my father, she -- she joined that -- that\nstampede of -- of -- of the Washington Heights Jewish women. You had to have exactly\nthe right kind of jewelry and a new dress and a fur coat and -- and she was one of the\nworst, honestly. I just could -- I think that\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t get used to -- to her. My\nmother had been so plain, the only thing she ever possessed was her -- her engagement\nring, which I fortunately still have. But my -- my stepmother just wasn\u2019t like that at all.\nThe first time I met her, she -- she -- that -- that was then again, much later, after I was\nmarried, she came to visit me in Lewiston with my father, in a fur coat and a fancy outfit,\nand I ju -- I just couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t get used to that. So, anyway, Washington Heights\nwas a community of it\u2019s own. My father only had Jewish customers. Only the Jewish\nreligious people from the surrounding s -- s -- few streets came to see him. And once in\nawhile a -- an inspector would show up to inspect the cleanliness and -- and the exits and\nentrances and the fire escape. And my father always was afraid of them, because they\nspoke English and they were the strangers, they were them, you see? So that ghetto\nmentality was still there.",
        "Q: And even for him, who -- who -- who hadn\u2019t experienced the length of --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- of the -- of the Holocaust through the ghetto?",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Appears very --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- powerful.",
        "A: Yeah. He never really -- he never really became Americanized. He\u2019s -- he still\nremained it -- remained just the way he was. And I think that was the -- a source of\nfriction between us too, because I wanted to be American. I sa -- I didn\u2019t want to be any\nmore like I was in Anspach. I wanted to be an American woman. I remember when I\nfinally went to college, and then became a librarian and took a job, his comment was,\n\u201cWhy do you need to work? Your husband will support you.\u201d See, that was the mentality.\nHe never understood it.",
        "Q: Can you talk a little bit about more -- your idea of what it was to be an American\nwoman? Eve -- Especially in those -- those first few months in -- you were feeling\nfrustrated by what you thought was the pettiness of the community, what were the things\nthat you want people and yourself to be focusing on, to be concerned about?",
        "A: Well, I -- I didn\u2019t like the -- the Washington Heights mentality and -- and environment\nat all. I -- I -- just wasn\u2019t comfortable. I knew I was being talked about and criticized\nand -- and -- and I just couldn\u2019t relate to these bosoms -- fat woman in their finery and\ndoing really not very much. They just transplanted themselves. So when I came to Maine,\nmy husband -- my husband also felt that way about New York and he wanted to be in a\nsmall town where he could make an impact and really -- and really be an American\nphysician. Then when we moved to Maine, actually I ha -- I had a new struggle then.\nThen I was expected to be an American -- a young American wife and I didn\u2019t know\nhow. And then I -- I didn\u2019t know how to play Bridge, that was the furthest from my mind,\nso I was already ostracized because I couldn\u2019t ever be invited to Bridge games. What\nwere they going to do with me? I couldn\u2019t play. So, you know, that was already a\nhandicap. And my English of course, wasn\u2019t so great at the time. I remember -- I don\u2019t\nknow if this will sit well on tape or not, but I have a memory of trying to play Bridge and\ntrying to fit in and finally -- and then you had to always say what you put down, what\ncard, the King or the Queen. And finally one of the other three American ladies said to\nme, \u201cGerda, please stop referring to that card as the ass. Call it the Ace.\u201d So that\u2019s how --\nthat\u2019s how ha -- ha -- I struggled. And I quit after awhile. I just couldn\u2019t learn that stupid\ngame. Also, it wasn\u2019t important to me. And then soon I was pregnant and I had a child\nand th-that of course, was crucial. And I felt very much that I was saved because I should\ndo something ex -- ec -- other than playing Bridge and learning to say the cards correctly.\nAnd so I -- I devoted myself to my kids. So much so that actually I -- I -- I became\ndepressed after awhile. I -- I did nothing but worry about this firstborn of mine, because\nhe was actually the first thing that I could call mine and I -- I knew, excepting my\nnightmares, I knew that he couldn\u2019t be taken away from me. Nobody could come in and -\n- and take him, he was mine. And so I -- I -- I was between the reality and the nightmares,\nI -- I became very depressed and actually I did see a psychiatrist, upon the urging of my\nhusband. And then one of the woman also -- that was also a -- a big factor in my\ndepression -- one of the women, actually the local rabbi\u2019s wife, who was about the age of\nmy mother then and I being without a mother or mother-in-law or anybody and being that\npoor, displaced person there, she befriended me and she acted as my -- as my dominant\nguardian. And somehow, without my really understanding it, I -- I just couldn\u2019t get along\nwith her. I just feared her and I -- I -- I never knew how to -- how to talk with her and --\nand she -- she was very possessive of me and I was terribly -- actually afraid of her. And\nafter that went on for maybe a couple of years or so, I -- my husband, who -- who n --\nwho noticed that I wasn\u2019t reacting right --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nGerda Haas. This is tape number three, side A.",
        "A: -- put me down sometime -- someday and -- and talk to me and try to find out why I\nwas having such a hard time. And he pointed out to me -- as so often an outsider can tell\nyou much better what\u2019s wrong with you -- he pointed out to me that she was moving into\nmy mother\u2019s place and I, having that guilt complex a ma -- about my mother, I just\ncouldn\u2019t relate to her. Ij -- I just couldn\u2019t deal with it. I was so afraid of her, although I\ndidn\u2019t know why and she of course, didn\u2019t know why either. And that\u2019s when he sent me\nto a psychiatrist. And then, after a few sessions, when he pointed out to me that it was --\nall this was perfectly normal and how I could deal with it, then I was okay.",
        "Q: What was it that your husband saw that gave him concern? I mean [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, I was always afraid of this person who called me up and demanded that I call\nher back and I had to tell her everything that was going on in my life. For instance, she\nwas So possessive of me that when I told her that I was three months pregnant with my\nfirst child, and I told her as the first person because, you know, naturally I felt some kind\nof -- of a debt to her for being so nice to me and teaching me English and teaching me\nhow to cook. What did I know about cooking? And teach -- and taking me to her friends\nand everything. So I felt a certain debt to her, so she was the first one I told that I was\npregnant. Very joyously and I thought, \u201cOh now she\u2019Il be just so sweet to me.\u201d And she\nsaid, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me this sooner?\u201d And you know, again, I sh-shrank back and\nthis old fear of her came back to me. And you know, I was just always not just right with\nher. They invited us all the time and I always feared to go and my husband noticed that\nsomething was wrong with me -- with me and that relationship with her. So finally we\nstraightened it -- he straightened it out.",
        "Q: Tell us about your reaction when he suggested you see a psychiatrist.",
        "A: That was okay. I wanted to get over it myself. I didn\u2019t know what was ailing me. She\nwas a somewhat dem-demanding and domineering -- a childless woman and she kind of\nsucked onto me and -- and wanted me to be completely hers and I didn\u2019t want to. I didn\u2019t\nwant to be dominated again.",
        "Q: When you did go see the psychiatrist, what did you end up talking about?",
        "A: Oh, you know, that\u2019s 50 years ago. Let me see if I can reconstruct that. First of all, at\nthat point, 1t was not so accepted to go to the psychiatrist, so we -- we went to a\npsychiatrist in the next town, Portland and I think my husband drove me down each time.\nI think so. And he a-asked about the -- the past and the Holocaust, something about the\nHolocaust and my life. And he also noticed that I had a guilt complex. And then he told\nme that I was perfectly normal and that people who go through very great traumatic\nexperiences and come out alive, whereas other people die, as for instance in the plane\ncrash or any natural disaster, do end up with a guilt complex and he thought that was\nquite normal. And once I knew that, I could deal with it. I didn\u2019t go many times. He was\nvery good and very kind and -- and I could deal with it. Interesting enough, though, I -- I\ngot over it and I adjusted okay, but three of my four children ended up going to a\npsychiatrist or a psychologist in -- in their formative years. Apparently I did pass that on\nto them. And I think they talked a lot about me and -- and my past and my relationship to\nthem. They\u2019re all very close to me now, but there was a time when they just -- they just --\ndidn\u2019t know just how to act. I know for instance that -- w-we never talked about the\nHolocaust and we never talked German, but once the children knew that I had been in a\nconcentration camp and -- and I\u2019I1 tell you in a minute how they found that out, then I\nbegan to realize that they were reading under their covers at night with flashlights, books\nabout the Holocaust, but they didn\u2019t dare to ask me, so they visualized that I went\nthrough the worst of what they were reading and I think that was the cause of their -- of\ntheir m-maladjustment. And how did they find out? Because after I went to college, at\nage 49 and then to grad school and became a librarian -- that was in \u201874, early -- maybe\neven before then -- then I became a book reviewer for the Library Journal and for some\nof the Jewish magazines. And once they realized that I could deal with Holocaust books\non an authentic and authoritative basis, they deluged me with Holocaust material. And\nthen my kids, of course, caught on and asked and -- and then we were okay. Was the --\ncan you talk a little bit about your decision not to talk -- not to tell your children about it?\nWas it a conscious decision or perhaps a decision where you [indecipherable]",
        "A: I don\u2019t believe that 1t was a conscious decision. I never much talked to my husband\nabout it, either. H-He -- in the beginning, he went with me and heard me lecture, so he\nknew all about it, but I -- it didn\u2019t seem something I wanted to talk with him about. I\nwonder why? It was okay to talk to the psychiatrist about it and it was okay to -- to talk to\na -- to a faceless audience. But it was not okay to talk to my father or my husband or my\nkids about it. Or even my closer girlfriends. I -- I did find some -- some of my colleagues\nfrom Berlin Hospital here again. One of the friends I was especially close to, I found her\nagain and then my head nurse, I found quite by chance in a little for -- Godforsaken town\nin Maine and that seemed okay. All we ever talk about was the Holocaust and Berlin and\nwhat happened and other friends and od -- it just -- 1t just didn\u2019t seem to come out with\nmy family. I don\u2019t know why not.",
        "Q: What about when your friend Eva would visit or you\u2019d visit her?",
        "A: Oh, that --",
        "Q: And then the children might have been younger, would you have been talk -- did you\ntalk to Eva about it in their -- in their presence?",
        "A: There was nothing to talk about. We had gone through the same thing, we were like\nsisters. Fortunately sh-she had -- she -- she has by now forgotten everything. She\u2019s\nmaybe getting a little bit senile, but what -- 1f we ever say anything, she doesn\u2019t\nremember it. She doesn\u2019t remember any of the things that are so vivid in my mind. Like\nwhen we washed our hair under that pump that we had to pump. We had to help each\nother, cause one had to pump and the other one had to wash her hair. I never forgot it.\nShe doesn\u2019t remember a thing about it. So, it -- I -- I have no explanation why I didn\u2019t\ntalk to my family. There was so much else to talk about. I had to learn English, I had to\nlearn to be a wife. I had to be a mother. There was so much to do. I had books to read. I\nhadn\u2019t read a book in 12 years. Jews weren\u2019t supposed to read. I hadn\u2019t listened to music,\nall of this I had to do now. So, my husband was a big, big help to me. He was just an\nangel. And I had to get to know him. I married him while being practically engaged to the\nother guy and I didn\u2019t even know him. We only knew each other for three months, but we\ntruly fell in love and I knew that was the man I wanted to spend my life with. We were\njust really so made for each other. Our background was the same a-and w-we just entered\na very happy marriage and we still have a very happy, functional marriage. And it just\ndidn\u2019t seem necessary to talk about the past. I somehow assumed he knew it all. You\nknow how you -- when you\u2019re -- when you\u2019re very close to someone? He knows. You\nknow? And he probably does know. I\u2019ve -- we never talk about it. It\u2019s not important, a-at\nleast in that context. I don\u2019t know if that makes any sense or not.",
        "Q: D-Do you have any thoughts about how your history got communicated to your\nchildren if, as you say, you didn\u2019t talk about a lot, but somehow it affected them, is what\nyou had said.",
        "A: It did, yes.",
        "Q: And wh -- ho-how do you think that\u2019s so? How can something that\u2019s not spoken still\naffect someone so profoundly?",
        "A: I have to think a minute -- a minute, how to answer you that, because I had never\nreally thought about it. Well, I was -- I was a walking survivor. It was probably written\nall over me. I had such different values from other people. You know, I couldn\u2019t throw\nout any food. I -- I would go to people\u2019s homes to eat and whatever was on the table and\ndidn\u2019t get eaten, was thrown in the waste. I couldn\u2019t do that. A-And -- and this business\nwith having new clothes all the time. Who cares? I had a dress, that was great. And\nmaybe some of those things, surely it must have transmitted its-itself to the kids.",
        "Q: Can you tell us the story about your son and his ideas about having children?",
        "A: Yes, I will, but first I want to say this, my -- my children, in a way, by osmosis almost,\nsurmised what was going on and yet, they didn\u2019t really understand. I -- I\u2019m sure I spoke\nabout this when I was interviewed the first time, but 1t seems important enough now\nmaybe just to touch on it once more without going into too much detail. When I was --\nwhen I was asked to be a member of the state Board of Education in Maine, I accepted,\nof course, greedily and then I -- a phone call came -- or rather a notice came that my\nconfirmation hearing was on -- on a certain date in September and I looked at my\ncalendar, it was the second day of Rosh Hashanah and I didn\u2019t travel then. So, I talked to\nmy husband and he said, \u201cWell, you have to call up and tell them you can\u2019t come and\nprobably they\u2019ll pick someone else.\u201d So I called up and it was the Senator Katz who was\non the phone, who was the chairman and of course, obviously he was also Jewish and he\nwas such a nice guy, I became very close friends with him later. And I said to him, \u201cI\u2019m\nsorry, I don\u2019t travel on the second day of Rosh Hashanah. I can\u2019t come.\u201d And he was\nquiet for a minute and then he said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m Jewish too, I never even knew there\nwas a second day of Rosh Hashanah.\u201d And so we talked about that for awhile and then he\nsaid, \u201cWell, then we\u2019ll postpone the hearing for a week -- for a --\u201d I don\u2019t know how\nlong. And I was just flabbergasted that this senator from Maine ju -- postponed a hearing\nfor me, who was persecuted for being Jewish. And I talked about that werbar in front of\nthe kids. And my daughter Heddy, the one who\u2019s living here now, said -- still ringing in\nmy ears and she said to me -- she was then about, oh, maybe 14 or 15. She said, \u201cWhy --\nwhy do you think that\u2019s so -- so -- so noteworthy? Naturally, if you can\u2019t come because\nof religious reasons, they have to postpone the date for you.\u201d You know, and I -- then I\nwas even more flabbergasted, that my own kid didn\u2019t understand what -- what it means to\n-- not to live in a democracy. I -- I -- I don\u2019t know if you understand the bigness of that\nthing. It was such a revelation to me, such an epiphany. And -- and then -- then I\nprobably explained to her at that point that not everybody grows up in a democracy and\nhas democracy in their bloods -- in their bloodstreams, with their mother\u2019s milk. Well, in\nthat case, it wasn\u2019t the case but -- but obviously she was American enough not to\nunderstand that this -- a senate does not have to postpone a hearing for a Jewish woman.\nSo then I wrote my book. And the book just came out of me, because I thought, \u201cIf my\nown kids don\u2019t know it, other kids don\u2019t know it either.\u201d And I -- I wrote my book then. I\n-- it was the first one, it\u2019s in the preface. The whole preface, that\u2019s why I wrote the book,\nfor my kids and for other kids, who grow up blithely and -- a-and then, of course, as I\nwas writing and researching and talking about it and speaking, then the kids know\neverything. The kids also didn\u2019t want to know all that much. The grandchildren want to\nknow more then the kids now. But the grandchildren already don\u2019t understand it any\nmore. They don\u2019t understand it any -- \u201cWhat did Hitler look like? Did he come and kill\nyour mother hi-himself?\u201d You know, things like that. \u201cWhat are you going to say to him\nwhen you meet him in heaven?\u201d There, at least I had an answer. I\u2019m not going to meet\nhim in heaven. I ain\u2019t going there, where he is. So, anyway. Yes, now I want to tell you\nabout my oldest son. Somehow I -- I always felt -- or at least I rationalized -- for lack of\nany other rationalization, that I was saved so that I could have children and -- and\nsomehow continue the -- the -- the re -- the depleted Jewish people. So, I quickly had my\nfour kids and -- and I\u2019m sure that feeling translated itself in -- imbued itself into my kids.\nThey too should have kids and grandkids and the Jewish race should -- should keep going\nin spite of Hitler. Hitler did not win. He did not eradicate us all. We, the survivors are\nstarting again. And after my son was married for many years and didn\u2019t have children, he\nconfessed to me once that this is a -- a very big problem for him because he fee -- he feels\nhe has let me down, that he has not continue -- that I was saved and he -- he is not\ncontinuing this. And of course, I was flabbergasted to hear that and I assured him that he\nhas not let -- now, mind you, he\u2019s a psychologist himself, he doesn\u2019t have to go to a\npsychologist, he is one. So he and I talked at length and he understood then that -- that he\ndid not let me down and I never felt let down by him. On the contrary, I -- I\u2019m just\nextremely proud of all my kids and especially of him. And then, shortly after that he -- he\nadopted a little girl and she\u2019s now five and she\u2019s -- 10 months ago he adopted a little boy\nand now he feels whole. He has two children, that name will continue, the children have\nboth come here to our synagogue to be -- to go to the Mikvah to become Jewish and of\ncourse the boy had his circumcision here and I ha -- my son, honestly, he\u2019s a different\nperson since then. His head is up high and his chest is out and -- and he and I are -- are\nvery close again. So --",
        "Q: Can you tell us the names of your four children?",
        "A: Oh yes, of course I can, my whole pride and joy. With the children, I felt I had paid\nmy dues, at least to God and to the Jewish community. And then the other dues I paid, I\nwant to tell you after I tell you the children\u2019s name. So I\u2019m looking at this picture here,\nwhich was taken at the brit of my oldest son\u2019s little boy. And it\u2019s in front of the Kineset\nIsel synagogue, with the name clearly visible. So there\u2019s my husband and I and in the\ncenter iv my -- 1s my son Leonard. Now mind you, all my kids are named after the\nparents we lost. So Leonard -- which is a burden, actually. The kids say it is a burden.\nLeonard is named after my husband\u2019s father, Leonard. And next to him is my daughter\nHeddy, who is named after my husband\u2019s mother, Hedwick. And on his other side is my\nson David, who is named after a distant grandfather and here is my daughter Pauli, who\nis named after my mother, Paula. And then, these are their -- their mates and then in front\nyou have the next generation and of course their names are picked out of a hat and in fact,\nit is very interesting. You know, Hitler had -- one of the many laws that he made against\nthe Jews was that the Jews had to have what he thought was degrading names like Sarah\nand Jacob and Moses and Daniel. Those were names that only Jews should have. And the\ninteresting fact is that all my grandchildren have Jewish and Hebrew names, not because\nHitler decreed it, because those names are beautiful and they like them. The only one that\ndoesn\u2019t have a Jewish name, actually, is the two adopted kids. But it\u2019s no problem. So\nthere\u2019s Rachel and there is Tally and Ari. And not on the picture are Sarah and Jonathan\nand Benjamin and Raphael. And the two kids of my old -- of my youngest son\u2019s, which\nweren\u2019t born then -- oh yes they were -- is Jacob and Evan. Isn\u2019t that a great -- nice\npicture of my family and -- and I\u2019m very proud of them. So I have fulfilled my duty there\nand then -- and then I want to just mention a little bit that I have also fulfilled my duty to\n-- to this country, because after all, I owe it quite a debt. Quite a debt. And in that way\nI\u2019m very glad that I moved to small town, but that was very se -- very secondary, only\nafter I lived there for many years in -- in Lewiston, Maine, population maybe 60 -- maybe\n50,000. Only after I lived there for a long time, did I realize that the population, the\ngeneral American population knows very little about Judaism and almost nothing about\nthe Holocaust. And so I -- I really found a fulfilling role for myself. By that time I was a -\n- a librarian at Bates College in Lewiston and when we first moved there, in 1947, Bates\nCollege had only one Jewish professor and did not acknowledge the needs of the Jewish\nstudents. Holidays, no time off. Kosher food never was heard of. Jewish subjects were\nnever taught and so the Jewish population and also th-the non-Jewish population knew\nnothing. And I was able to change that. I -- I got myself some grants from the -- of course\nthen the times were different, too. This was in the 1970\u2019s, 1980\u2019s, I got myself some\nsizable grants from the Maine Human -- Council of the Humanities and with the blessing\nand -- and the encouragement of the Bates College president, I -- I conducted several\nJewish oriented conferences. And they really went over big. This was for the whole state\nof Maine, we had a tremendous budgets, we -- the first conference I did was a month\nlong. Just informational conference on Judaism and we moved from city to city, with\npeople and -- and videos and we talked and we an -- mostly we answered questions and\nmany people in the hinterlands of Maine confessed that they had never seen a Jew before.\nSo I -- I really felt proud about that. And then the next thing we did -- I was able to get a\nJewish library -- a Rabbinic library for Bates College. The -- the -- the husband of the --\nof the woman that had oppressed me so, the rabbi of -- of Lewiston died and -- and by\nthen of course I was on -- on even terms with her and I was able to -- to coax her into\ndonating his whole Rabbinic library in toto to Bates College. And it\u2019s known now as the\nRabbi David Berund Rabbinic Library of Bates College. And I\u2019m proud to say that I did\nit. And I catalogued it -- took me several years. And it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s a nice -- nice\nlegacy. And then we did s -- then again I got f-funding for several Jewish events --\nJewish music. And that was all within that library, I got money for that and I was able to\ndo a David Berund event annually. And once I did a music -- Jewish music and the other\ntime we did Jewish films and next time we did Yiddish. And I got good speakers and we\nalways had standing room only. It was fabulous, it was like they needed to hear about\nJudaism. Not only the Jews, but the non-Jews as well. The students, the professors, the\ntownspeople, the out of townspeople. Was fabulous. And out of that -- when I realized\nthe need, out of that, I -- then we did Holocaust conferences, especially with teachers.\nAnd again I felt this - this void. This -- this -- this -- this magnetic need that I had and\nthen we finally got together and we had a little bit of money left from the last conference\n-- oh, I don\u2019t know, maybe a thousand dollars and of course we were obliged to return it\nto the -- to the main Humanities Council, but we asked and got permission to keep it as\nseed money to found the Holocaust Human Rights Center of Maine. And we were just\nsailing through that. It was like they just waited for us. The Maine State Library\nsponsored us, we had our meetings there, they did all our cataloguing, all our mailing, all\nour newsletter, our videota -- I did a complete video and oral history tape of all the\nsurvivors in my -- Maine is such a small state, all we had was 25 survivors and maybe\nless than a dozen t -- much less than a dozen liberators. And we -- we -- we interviewed\nthem all. We also interviewed non-Jewish people. Our criterion for survivor simply was\nanyone whose life has been dramatically changed because of Hitler. And that included a\nlot of non-Jewish, too. We had a lay -- a layer of -- a s -- of a small town in Poland who\nwouldn\u2019t go along with him and had to leave, with his whole family. And we had a\nformer Nazi woman who then completely turned around and married a Jewish soldier and\ncame over to Maine and became completely de-Nazified and -- and talked about -- and\nshe wrote a book called, \u201cPoison in my Roots.\u201d She talked about h-h-how she couldn\u2019t\nhelp being a Nazi, there was nothing else. If she wasn\u2019t a Nazi, she was going to be shot,\nas simple as that. And she explained that to us. So I -- I really am feeling so -- so pleased.\nWe got funding from people we -- we didn\u2019t even approach. People came to us with --\nwith thousands of dollars. It was just fabulous. Today we are a functioning, vibrant, rich,\nbusy center.",
        "Q: Do you go back there from time to time?",
        "A: I\u2019m in very close contact with them. Just a cu -- just a day or so ago, I had on my e-\nmail on my computer, a message from -- from our secretary, whom I still picked -- she\nwas hand picked by me when I was still the -- the president and she stayed with us all\nthese years. This was like 15 years ago. And she said one of the synagogues in a small\ntown in Maine was desecrated on Yom Kip -- on Rosh Hashanah and she wanted me to --\nto say something that they can put into their newsletter and of course I wrote -- I\u2019m still\nvery much a part of it.",
        "Q: I want to ask you about -- actually I think I will turn this tape. [inaudible]\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nGerda Haas. This is tape number three, side B.",
        "A: I -- [just want to continue on some of the things we did in Maine. After we founded\nthe Holocaust center, we had an annual reception for survivors and liberators at the\nBlaine House, the State House in Augusta, Maine, with the governor presiding and\nsomebody giving a speech and the Mrs. governor passing around the famous cookies and\nthings like that. And it was always something I -- I personally felt somewhat responsible\nfor, so I always walked around and greeted everybody and made sure they felt welcomed\nand made su -- and I -- I knew most of them, anyway. And they knew me, too and -- and\none year, I saw a man standing aside and I didn\u2019t know him and I couldn\u2019t place him, he\ndidn\u2019t look old enough to be a survivor. He looked at least 10 years younger than I. And\nhe certainly didn\u2019t look like a liberator. The liberators by then, all had a certain look.\nThey were a little bit on the heavy side, gray hair -- you know, salt of the earth kind of\npeople. And he didn\u2019t look like that, he looked quite elegant and quite aloof and I\nthought, \u201cWho is he?\u201d So I said, \u201cWell, no -- no time is lost in finding out.\u201d And I\nmarched right up to him, after all, I acted a little bit like the -- like the hostess in that\u2019s --\nin that context and I said, \u201cI\u2019m Gerda Haas. Welcome to our reception. May I ask who\nyou are? Are you one of our survivors or one of our liberators?\u201d And he -- he clicked his\nheels you know and gave me a salute. He was in civilian clothes, of course, just with a\nmilitary insignia on his lapel. And he said, \u201cI am Colonel Retired Manfred Kelman, US\nRegiment --\u201d and I think he named it, which I have forgotten by then. And I was taken\naback and I said, \u201cSo you are one of our liberators?\u201d He said, \u201cNo. I am a survivor. I was\nin Theresienstadt.\u201d And I was completely baffled. He didn\u2019t look old enough and he\ndidn\u2019t look Jewish and he didn\u2019t look like a survivor. Neither did he act like one. So he\nand I huddled a little bit, because I couldn\u2019t spend too much time, but we made a date and\nwe met later for coffee. And the fellow tells me he was a Mishling. He was brought up by\na Jewish father and an -- and an Aryan SS mother. And he was 14 years old when the\nNazis finally yanked him out of his house. Up to now his mother could keep him and\nkept her eye on him and he was a little bit protected. Also, as he told me later, he had a\nmiserable childhood. He was neither Jewish nor Aryan. So anyway, by the age of 14, he\nwas sent to Theresienstadt and there he was again miserable, because he wasn\u2019t a Jew and\nhe had to wear the star all of a sudden and he had no friends. There was nobody 14 years\nold in Theresienstadt. And so finally at the -- at the end of the war, his mother sent an --\nan -- a still functioning army car to pick him up out of Theresienstadt. But by gosh, the\nguy was in Theresienstadt just like me, a prisoner of the Nazis, with his star on his left\nhand side. And of course we became close friends. I just couldn\u2019t get over it. And as soon\nas he -- that finished it for him. As soon as he could, he took -- his father died in\nconcentration camp and he took his mother out and came to America. And of course he\nwas a youngster, so he got his education, enrolled into the army, rose to the level of\nColonel, went back to fight the Nazis and retired to Maine because it was a nice state to\nretire in. How do you like that story? That\u2019s -- I should -- I should write that as a novel --\nas a short story. I\u2019ve told it many times and it\u2019s just flabbergasting. So that\u2019s again the\nenvelope of -- of -- of the Holocaust, of my life. And he was the nicest, nicest fellow.",
        "Q: Can you talk a little bit about what it was like to be -- what I hear you say 1s somewhat\ncaught between two worlds, when you get to the United States.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: Washington Heights, very narrow --",
        "A: Very.",
        "Q: -- that\u2019s how you described it. You weren\u2019t interested in that world as much. But then\nyou get to Maine and again you don\u2019t quite fit.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "Q: How did you find a place to be? How did you make a place to be for -- for -- for\nyourself?",
        "A: Well, I -- I think -- I think I was a little bit on the outside, actually. I -- I think I have\nto say I was a little bit on the outside, by choice and by the rejection of my peers. And --\nand I think I made my own little world. I mean, to begin with that I went back to college\nat the age of 49. The people thought I was nuts. Here I was, married to a successful\nphysician, why should I go to college like a little girl? And sure enough, I was the age of\nmy professors. And that was kind of funny at times. But I went to college and then when\nI was done, I went to work. And in -- in 1971 that was not so common in a small town for\na -- for the wife of a professional to do. So again, out of choice, I didn\u2019t have time for\nthem and they rejected me because I went a different path. So, I had some close friends,\nbut looking back, they were all Europeans. No, I won\u2019t say that, I have a couple that were\nAmericans. But, pre-predominantly, my friends in -- in Maine were Europeans. And then\nI got so embroiled in the -- in all the activities that I have just described to you and then I\ngot completely snowed under with the Holocaust center. And they -- they didn\u2019t take part\nin that at all. They did come through when I did Jewish music and Jewish this and Jewish\nthat. That, they supported me in, but with the Holocaust they didn\u2019t support me all that\nmuch. And so I was on my own and I -- I was happy. I -- I was satisfied. I was different.\nThat\u2019s very funny, I -- I am thinking of -- I -- I had a girlfriend who was also European\nand we chatted a little bit and our children were in the next room playing. They were\nsmall, maybe eight. And I hear one of them say, \u201cMy mother doesn\u2019t have an accent,\nyour mother does.\u201d And I hear my daughter reply, \u201cNo, my mother doesn\u2019t have an\naccent, your mother has an accent.\u201d So I was different and yet I wasn\u2019t, you know? So, to\nanswer your question, you know, it hurt at times when I wasn\u2019t invited or -- or I knew\nthey were talking about me, or -- but you see, also I was very happily married. I -- I really\n-- you know, what did I need? I had my kids, I had my husband, I still had my father at\nthe time. And also, I did not get along with him as well as I should have. And I had my\nstepmother. I had them and they were -- and they were a responsibility as they became\nolder, you see? So I -- I -- I was okay. I have no qualms. And then I became interested in\nother things and I wanted to build a nice life and -- and I -- I think I Americanized\nmyself. I had a career, I was a book reviewer. I was always doing something.",
        "Q: This is a somewhat related question which is, if you could talk a bit about something\nthat you mentioned in your first interview, which is that you were made t-to be -- you\nwere made to feel subhuman and stupid about yourself.",
        "A: Yes. In -- in school.",
        "Q: What -- what became of that self-concept? How did you change it?",
        "A: Well, I --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] change?",
        "A: Well I -- I think for a long time it stayed with me. See, I was 10 years old when I was\ndeclared a subhuman, an outsider. A Jew. I was supposed to be -- I was supposed to be\nugly, with a big nose and s -- big ears and stupid and the pu -- the real sturmer picture,\nyou know, of -- of kids that were Jewish. And I was supposed to be on the outside of -- of\nthe Aryan world, which was blonde and straight and beautiful and dancing about. And I -\n- | think when you te-tell that to a kid of 10 for 12 years, I think it will leave an impact.\nAnd I think partly that\u2019s why I had a hard time for a long time. I had to prove to myself\nthat I -- that I was intelligent, that I could do something, that I was beautiful and that I\nwas a good mother and a good wife. I think it took awhile. I -- I really do. I really do.\nAnd I think that\u2019s where all the nightmares came from, also. Subconsciously I was still\nthe fugitive, the haunted one. And I couldn\u2019t shake it, for the longest time. And my\nhusband helped me a great deal in that, too. He was very understanding about that. Yes,\nbut it took awhile. In school we were not allowed to -- to answer, because we were not\nallowed to know. You know, don\u2019t rock the boat of their -- of their perception of a Jewish\nstudent. We were sitting in the back and we were not allowed to answer. And we to -- we\ngot passing grades, but nothing special. And -- and then, of course, I -- I picked a -- a\nhands on profession, I became a nurse. But that was also because of necessity. No college\nwould take us. Completely out of the question, because all the colleges were states\ncolleges.",
        "Q: Did you ever think about nursing here?",
        "A: Fleetingly. I was married to a doctor and I would have to be in the same hospital and I\ndidn\u2019t want that. And there was so much else to do. I -- I didn\u2019t want to be a nurse, I\nwanted to -- I wanted to be a student and I -- I was.",
        "Q: You said several times that your husband Rudolf has been very helpful. Can you t-tell\nus how? For instance, how was he helpful in -- in helping you feel that you weren\u2019t s-\nstupid, that -- that\u2019s the last example you just gave, but you\u2019ve mentioned that several\ntimes.",
        "A: Yes, well number one, he wu -- he understood me better than I understood myself. He\nwas completely able to pinpoint my problems with -- with the wife of the rabbi and he\nwas able to lift that from me. And he understood my obsession with my children very\nwell. He was very tolerant about that. And -- and he never probed, he never questioned,\nhe never -- he was never angry, which I -- I don\u2019t think I could have taken. And h-he was\njust -- I never quite thought about how he helped me, but as I\u2019m thinking -- and he was\nthe one that urged me to go to college. And when I was done with college, and I\ngraduated fabulously, coo -- summa cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa, all the honors you can\nhave. So I said -- it was very funny too, for a graduation present, he gave me a new\nelectric stove. Stay here, cook for me. But when he realized that I wasn\u2019t very happy\ndoing that, he urged me to go to grad school. He said, \u201cLook into librarianship, that looks\nlike a challenging profession.\u201d And he was always the one who -- who advised me right.\nI na -- just -- he still understands me very well. He still -- he still understands everything I\ndo and -- and he -- he himself 1s still very religious, but I -- my religion has shifted from\npoint A to point B and he understands that. He -- he -- he knows completely where --\nwhere I\u2019m coming fr -- to use that worn phrase -- where I\u2019m coming from and where I\u2019m\ngoing to. That\u2019s not what I want to say. H-He really -- he really understands my -- my --\nmy background. He himself is of course a refugee also, but he didn\u2019t go through\nconcentration camps. And -- and so he -- he doesn\u2019t consider himself a survivor, although\nI say he is. Does that answer your question?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Good. Let\u2019s see if I have anything else on my thing here. It was funny when I meet all\nthese people again. Did I -- did I emphasize once more why we are the last of the\nsurvivors?",
        "Q: Not on tape and I think you should.",
        "A: Yeah, Id like to -- to really press hard on that point.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I-It\u2019s so little known that one of the tenets of Nazi ideology was of course that we\nshouldn\u2019t live. We -- we should all be killed. And that -- that is one of the laws of the --\nof the Nazi party, the Jews have to be killed. But then practicality took over and they\nfigured as long as we can squeeze a little labor out of them, let\u2019s work around that basic\nlaw and make a second law. And this law -- and I have it here, in -- in Xerox copy, th-the\nWannsee Conference Law of 1942 states that when the people come to concentration\ncamp, anyone under 18 is to be killed on arrival and anyone over 45 1s to be killed on\narrival. And so they were. So that narrow gap, between 18 and 45 was allowed to sort of\nkill themselves. Die of natural causes, namely starvation and -- and h-hard labor and\nbeatings and infections and finally then of course also, the gas chamber. So this should\nnot be forgotten. So after we, who are now in our 70\u2019s, are gone, there are very few true\nsurvivors left, because of that ominous law of killing people under 18. When I tell that to\nstudents, that -- they really sit up and -- and take notice. It was really beastly. It was\nreally beastly.",
        "Q: You spoke many times in your first interview of this sort of ingrained instinct to\nbehave --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- you grew up with. To obey.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You talked a lot about that. Can you speak some about -- about yourself and your\ninstinct to obey now? Is it something that you worked on to change or how has it changed\nover the years?",
        "A: You're hitting all the right spots and some of them are sore. Yes, that was an ingrained\ninstinct, not only because of the Nazis, but you know, we grew up obeying. We grew up\nobeying our parents and our grandparents and our teachers and our rabbis. And our -- our\nelders. That\u2019s how we were brought up. That was the Jewish way and of course the\nGerman way also. And then Hitler came upon the scene and suddenly we had to obey for\nvery different reasons and -- and really k -- knuckle down and obey, or we were killed.\nThere was no question about it. They came with their sticks and their dogs. And to this\nday I -- I\u2019m so uncomfortable around dogs and I think it\u2019s because of that. They always\nhad their dogs with them. And we had to give up all our animals, you see, so that there\u2019d\nbe no interaction with dogs or cats or anything, because they always had their dogs on\ntheir side. So here they came, a-an -- and we didn\u2019t even question obedience. We didn\u2019t\neven question it and I\u2019m ashamed to say it today. When they made us the -- the -- the --\nthe instigators of our own death, we obeyed. Why didn\u2019t we just lay down and die instead\nof -- instead of obeying them and ha -- aiding them? We were going to be killed anyway.\nYou know that -- I don\u2019t think that occurred to us. We obeyed and that was all there was\nto it. That\u2019s the way -- you didn\u2019t know you could disobey. I -- we didn\u2019t know there was\ncivil disobedience. That\u2019s an American institution. We didn\u2019t know that. So we obeyed.\nNow, to come to this -- to the present, how did I deal with it over here? I have to really\nthink. Yeah, we were shocked at the time when the 60\u2019s came and -- and the ki -- and our\nown kids were sitting s-sit-outs or sit-ins? Sit ins. I was shocked. That didn\u2019t occur to us.\nAnd we didn\u2019t al-allow our kids to disobey very much either. It really was ingrained. I\nguess 1n a way it still is. I guess in a way it has never quite left. I remember -- I remember\nvery well that I was married for 19 years and I finally one day stood up to my husband.\nAnd it\u2019s a strong memory. I thought, \u201cMy God, I\u2019m married 19 years and this is the first\ntime I\u2019m speaking back to him.\u201d I-It -- you just didn\u2019t. But, of course the circumstances\nwere different. Nobody yells at me now or orders me to do things. I do it because I want\nto. So I think some of that is still with me. I -- I think it is. And the obedience to God, that\nreally never quite left me either. That is the best I can explain it. But, of course I\u2019m very\nmuch my own person now. I hope. I am. I don\u2019t know if that answers your question, but\nit\u2019s about all I can do. But you know, there is a certain freedom in obedience also. I\u2019m\nfree to -- to do as I wish, e1-either to go along with what\u2019s expected of me, or not to. And\nthat\u2019s very nice too, so if I go along, it\u2019s because I want to.",
        "Q: Do you bi -- what do you think the Holocaust and the -- the -- the knowledge that we\nhave, how do you think that affected, in Germany especially, or maybe around the world,\nthis behavior of blind obedience? Do you think it possibly had an impact, that -- that the\nknowledge that we have of the Holocaust and what blind obedience led to, do you think\nthat has changed that, culturally?",
        "A: It\u2019s very hard to say. The wer -- I never thought the world would be in such dire\nstraights as it is now. I really thought they had learned a little something, but they\nhaven\u2019t. I -- I don\u2019t think things have changed. I -- I -- I don\u2019t think the world as such has\ngotten any better. But I -- I think -- I think this country at least is more aware of not\nblindly ob-obeying. Of not blindly walking along and doing their own thing and I -- I\u2019m\nvery thrilled about that. But I think they\u2019re going overboard now. Th-This freedom to\ninvestigate everybody, that\u2019s too much. That\u2019s almost again like Hitler, this perse -- this -\n- this persecution of a person or -- of a person, that -- I -- I just can\u2019t see that. That can\nonly lead to more trouble. But -- but th-the liberty to criticize anybody, right up to your\npresident, that is a thrilling aspect. That reporters can -- can have a say of what they\nthink, that\u2019s unheard -- that was unheard of in Germany. Every newspaper had to print\nwhat Hitler told them to, you see? And that\u2019s why it -- it became so widespread. So I\nthink the world has learned some things. That people have to be honest and have to say\nwhat they think and have to stand up and march for their rights. But 1-1n other wer -- in\nother parts of the world, not too much has changed and things are still pretty bad.",
        "Q: Which part of the world were you thinking of?",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m thinking now of -- of where people are really oppressed. Of Third World\ncountries where people ca -- one of the truths of -- of -- of political life is that you can\u2019t\nrebel unless you have already reached a certain level. And Hitler made sure that the\nGermans never reached that level. He kept them down. But Third -- Third World\ncountries can\u2019t rebel. They haven\u2019t got enough food in their stomachs and not enough\nvoice in their lungs. But here, where everything is so great and wonderful and people can\ndo as they wish and have the -- the personal strength to do it, they can rebel. But while\nthey were slaves, they couldn\u2019t do anything about it either.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So there\u2019s a -- a natural gra-gradient up the ladder where for a long time they can\u2019t do\nanything about it and then as you get a little better, a little higher up, then you can object\nand can make yourself heard. And you should. But each country and each person has to\nfind th-that uphill grade by themselves.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nGerda Haas. This is tape number four, side A. Have you traveled to Germany?",
        "A: Yes, I went back at least twice to my town, Anspach, that beautiful, baroque town\nwith the beautiful cobblestones and the [indecipherable] and the castle and the churches\nand everything. See how pretty it is, with stained glass windows and these gorgeous roofs\nall covered with that tile. And I -- I -- I -- I used to like my hometown, I w -- I was a v --\na very happy girl there, before Hitler and I used to love it. I remember so many little\nthings. M-My grandmother once took me to the -- to the Hoffgarden, which is like a\narboretum, at night when I was very little, because there was a Queen of the Night that\nwas opening up at night and she wanted me to see that and I never forgot it. It had such\nan aroma to it and at -- it -- I could see the petals opening, I was just a young girl and it\nwas dark and there were these white petals opening up and throwing their -- their\nperfume at me. I never forgot it. So there were many reasons why I liked my hometown a\nlot. But I went back and I -- I -- I was most unhappy there. I felt so -- I felt as if I had an\nitchy skirt -- shirt on me. As if I wanted to scratch myself all the time and get out of there.\nAnd Anspach was notoriously anti-Semitic and it was very interesting. I -- I had -- I\nwanted to see the synagogue, which is a -- a beautiful, historical building. It was built by\nthe same architect that built the castle for the margraff there. At that point the Jews were\nin -- in good standing with the margraff and they asked for a synagogue and he -- that\nwas in 1745 -- 300 -- 500 -- 400 years ago and he gave them his own architect and helped\nthem build this beautiful synagogue, here it is. See, this is the castle and the synagogue\nhas the same high windows, that I\u2019Il show you in a minute, if I can find it. So, I was very\nanxious to go back and I had to ask for the key to the synagogue at the -- at the city hall,\nbecause now it\u2019s closed. There are no Jews living there, so it\u2019s just a memorial. And I\nwent to the city hall and I asked for the -- for the key and they told me that -- I asked in --\nin German, you know, I didn\u2019t want them to know who I am. And -- and I asked and they\nsaid I had to wait a few minutes, the fellow th-that -- who I had corresponded with that I\nwas coming, Mr. Lung, will be here in a minute, he\u2019s out celebrating his birthday. And I\nhad noticed that on the letters that he had written to me, telling me I had to come and get\nthe key myself, he never used his first name, he always said his title, whatever it was,\nRaths -- something Lung and there was no first name. And so I waited a few minutes and\nhe came back from his birthday party and I could figure out from the date that where we\nare now and hi -- this was his 50th birthday party, that he was born right smack in the\nHitler regime. And when he came in, you know, the whole office exploded, \u201cOh, g-\nglerkil -- glerklishan kiportstak, Adolf.\u201d So you see, the whole city was so anti -- so pro-\nHitler that they named their little kids Adolf. And that\u2019s why he never used his -- his\nname, he was ashamed of -- he could change it actually, he\u2019s sitting right there in city\nhall. It\u2019s not hard for him to change. But you know, you\u2019re -- you\u2019re fine tuned. You pick\nup things that other people would -- that then I would never have picked up. He didn\u2019t\nuse his name and he was born just -- just 1933 and his parents named him Adolf in -- in --\nin adoration of their fuehrer, you see? So -- so everything contributed to my being very\nuncomfortable there. And he gave me the key and I went through the synagogue and of\ncourse as soon as I had opened up that very beautiful synagogue, other people came,\npushing in and of course he didn\u2019t allow that, so he cut my visit short and you know,\neverything was just against me and I da -- I wa -- I wasn\u2019t happy there.",
        "Q: Did you go look at your house?",
        "A: Yes. I looked at my house, which again, I was so happy there and I thought, \u201cOh, I\njust want to see it once more.\u201d But it turned out to be a terrible experience. Number one, I\nwalked up those few steps of 200 Strasserfunfe and I look at the little plaque that\u2019s there\nand it was still the man who drove us out, who got the house from us from prac -- next to\nnothing. So, by implication, all my furniture and all my belongings and all my stuff must\nhave still been in my house. Cause he surely didn\u2019t throw it out or do anything with it, we\nhad left everything. And he moved in. He moved into a ready set table and made up beds.\nSo, I already had that feeling, oh, what am I doing here? And then to make things even\nworse, he had one of those big German Shepherd dogs that I -- that I feared so much,\nboth physically and mentally. So, of course, I didn\u2019t -- I asked if I could walk through\nand at least see -- see the garden and everything, but -- he said yes, but how could I with\nthat dog sitting there, you know\u201d? So that was a very bad experience and I turned right\naround and walked out.",
        "Q: Did he know who you were?",
        "A: No, but I think he guessed it. Who else would come and look at an 0 -- a house that\nhad no historical significance? I may have said I lived here once, or something. But I\ndidn\u2019t kno -- but I had my daughter with me, who -- the one who 1s living in France now\nand we started out from Strasbourg to -- wh-where she had relatives and we were visiting\nand it took us very little time to come by car from Strasbourg, just across the Rhine into\nAnspach, it was maybe -- maybe a two hour car ride and she came with me. And I was\nextremely taken by her reaction. She -- she couldn\u2019t believe that my hometown was --\nwas there. You see, in her mind, it was some -- someplace on the moon, you know. And\nthat the people who bought my house were -- were there. In her mind they were monsters\nthat were living in Dante\u2019s Inferno, you know\u201d? And they were here, right there, she saw\nthem. She could touch the doorpost and -- and see their names and everything. A-And\nshe was flabbergasted that two hours from her, there was actually where it all took place.\nI -- I never even thought of -- she was so moved by that experience, she was just beside\nherself. And we took her to the synagogue and -- where my parents used to stand and as -\n- which is a beautiful, beautiful synagogue, I\u2019m so sorry we lost that to the Germans. I\nmade a little bit of an effort to have it transposed t-to Israel, as some synagogues have\nbeen, but I didn\u2019t get any res -- \u201cNo, that\u2019s ours now, that\u2019s a museum, there\u2019s nothing to\ndo with you any more.\u201d And then I asked for a -- some records, \u201cWell, we don\u2019t have\nthem. We sent them all to Israel.\u201d\u201d You know. They were anti-Semites and they still are\nanti-Semites. And they always will be. And my other da -- we took my other daughter,\nHedwick, the one that\u2019s named after my father\u2019s -- my husband\u2019s mother to the cemetery\nin Frankfort where my husband\u2019s parents are buried. And she had the shock of her life,\ntoo, because she saw her name on the grave-gravestone there. She still goes by her\nmaiden name, Heddy Haas and there was Hedwick Haas, buried under a stone with her\nname and she was also -- she finally realized she\u2019s named after a person that\u2019s lying\nthere, you see? So, really the children open up your eyes all over again.",
        "Q: Did you go to Theresienstadt?",
        "A: No. I -- I don\u2019t want to. I -- I just don\u2019t want to. And I don\u2019t want to go to Auschwitz.\nAnd I have a hard time going to -- to Holocaust museums. I have a hard time. At your\nmuseum -- at the US Holocaust Museum, I -- I -- I wa -- I was almost sick with anxiety\nbecause -- because it was the real thing, once you were in there, you couldn\u2019t get out.\nYou had to go through the whole rooms and upstairs and downstairs and this room and\nthat room. There was no way out, just like then. And you had to go through it until you\nwere finally out of there. I -- I was sweating. I -- so I\u2019m not comfortable with those things\nat all. But I can\u2019t -- I can\u2019t shake it, either. I can\u2019t shake it.",
        "Q: I want to ask you one thing, that your mother was able to send a few things, stuff them\ninto people\u2019s bags --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- and then -- could you tell us what she was able to send and -- and how your father\neventually got them?",
        "A: Yes, I -- I can. You see, when we finally, finally realized that we really should leave --\nalso our rabbi never urged us to and people began to leave from Anspach, they were\npacking their belongings, their furniture and the whole business into large lifts and were\nsending them over here. And my mother was able to give little packages to a few of the\npeople to take along. \u201cTake it,\u201d she said, \u201ctake it. Maybe we\u2019ll show up there too,\nsomeday. And if not, you keep it.\u201d So these were friends, you know, it was no great\ndanger that they would walk off with it. And if they did, you know, who cared, nobody\nknew. But they -- nobody did. So when I came over here -- and also when my father\ncame over here, all of a sudden people brought him things that -- that were his and he\ndidn\u2019t know that. He didn\u2019t know he -- I have such beautiful tablecloths that my mother\nand my aunt hand did and you know, th-these were important things for them. And then a\nfew pieces of silver, like this here, just a tiny little ashtray. One octagonal and the other\necliptical or what do you call that shape? Very finely chaste and -- and molded and\nlovingly polished by me, every so -- every so often, because I -- I Just love those things.\nThey were my mothers and she thought enough of them to stick them into somebody\u2019s\nbag and I got them again. And her own -- her own engagement ring, she gave to my\nfather to take along and he kept it on him until he was able to give it to me and I have\nalready given it to one of my daughters and little things like that. Very few things. This\nShabbas lamp, for instance, that is an old lamp that the people used before -- actually\nbefore wax candles and before electricity to light their Sabbath lights on. It had oil in it\nand wicks and before Shabbat you would light all the -- all the eight arms of it and it\nwould ga -- go for at least 10 or 12 hours and that way you had light. And I happen to\nhave the one that was in my house in Anspach.",
        "Q: Could you share with us -- you have mentioned before, in your first interview, the\nletters that were exchanged between your father and your mother.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And can you tell us about how you came to receive the letters and then I want to ask\nyou to read, perhaps, the last two letters that you wrote to your father.",
        "A: Okay. Okay, these -- my father was already in -- in America and mother was stuck in\nMunich. You see, we had to leave Anspach and had to move in with some relatives in a\nbig city. My sister was already then in Frankfort, at the Jewish hospital as a nurse and I\nwas in Berlin as a Jewish nurse. So we were all separated and in order to save postage,\nwhich was -- was a big deal in those days, we would write to my mother, to Munich and\nthen she would include our letters into hers. But, as you can see here, there\u2019s a note from\nFreidel and possibly a note from me somewheres too, but not right here. So here she\nwrites, on N-November the ninth, on a Sunday, in 1941 -- yeah, I was wrong, was the\nSeptember date, I -- I blacked out there for awhile. September was her birthday and she\nwrote to him at that time -- and I think it\u2019s in here, too, that she got as a birthday present\nwhat everybody else got too, September 19th of 1941 and that was the star. And whether\nmy father caught on or not, I don\u2019t know, but she couldn\u2019t outright say that. But I -- I\nunderstood it when I reread her letter. So I got my dates wrong. On November the ninth,\nshe was beginning to be de-deported and she says, \u201cMy dear Siegfried, it is difficult to\nme to wr -- for me to write to you today, because I have to give you sad news. I have\ngotten my notification for transport, for the transport that leaves here on Tuesday. I\u2019m so\nsorry for you and for the children. I know you will be upset, but I beg you, dear Siegfried,\ndon\u2019t grieve and don\u2019t be pessimistic. I am calm and I\u2019m not excited. The children feared\ndeporta-deportation already for a long time and have been worried about me all this time.\nTomorrow I must call them and talk to them. I only hope that they will be spared. I beg\nyou, dear Siegfried, don\u2019t be upset and don\u2019t be sad and most of all, do not blame\nyourself. If anyone deserves to be blamed, it is I, because it was I who urged you to leave\nwithout us. We human beings are a thing of naught. I see it clearer now than ever before.\nAll our planning, our hopes and toil comes to nothing when God decides differently. I\nthink now, if only I had done this or that, but it\u2019s no use. It\u2019s all destined by God. Here I\nam, making a farewell speech, but as yet I hope that I can write to you where I\u2019m going. I\nhaven\u2019t heard anything from mother in Redensberg or from Berta in Aidid. I hope they\nwill be spared. I will write to you a second letter today before I must go. Lovingly,\nPaula.\u201d Yeah, that was the ninth of November, 1941. And she wrote that same day,\nanother letter. \u201cMy dear Siegfried, to continue, I have a letter to send you from the\nchildren also; it\u2019s a week old. I had hoped so much that Freidel would be able to come for\na few days before I would be deported, but really, I didn\u2019t believe that I would actually be\ncalled up. And now it\u2019s a reality, as I told you in the first letter. I am in the first\nevacuation from Munich. I don\u2019t imagine it as all too black and I\u2019m not upset and of\ncourse Ill write to you from there as soon as possible, but don\u2019t be concerned if it takes\nlong. And I repeat, dear Siegfried, don\u2019t worry about me and don\u2019t reproach yourself.\nFate 1s stronger than we are. If it\u2019s God will that we will be reunited, He can arrange that\nfrom there, just as it is His will that I could not get to you from here. I\u2019ve packed already,\nhave taken all my warm clothes along. Frau Kaufman, the old lady who lives with me is\nalso in the transport and many of my old friends. Together our lot will be easier to pare --\nbear. Now my dear Siegfried, I have just talked with the children. Freidel wants to come\nwith me and Gerda too. I don\u2019t know if they can get travel permission and at any rate,\nthey should stay and keep in contact with you. Farewell.\u201d On the 11th she was deported\nto Ausch -- to Riga. She was 45 years old. On the ninth she was called and on the 11th\nshe was deported. And the ways of God are indeed strange. My first son was born on the\nninth and my second son on the 11th of November.",
        "Q: And when did you receive those letters [indecipherable]",
        "A: My father gave those to me when I came over here in \u201846.",
        "Q: So it was right away in \u201846?",
        "A: Yeah. He might not have given them to me, but of course I knew about them. I tell\nyou, he gave them to me when I was writing the book, 1n \u00b083, but I -- I was aware of\nthem anyway. I knew he had them, they were all still in their original envelopes and of\ncourse the envelope had to say, Sarah Paula Sarah Schil-Schild and -- and it also had to\nsay who took the letter to the Post Office and then it was opened up by the Gestapo. It\u2019s\nweird -- weird. Yeah.",
        "Q: We were speaking about your books and the -- the writing that you\u2019 ve done has also\nsparked letters from various people and you\u2019ve mentioned this letter from a young girl\nand I wonder if you could tell a little bit about that letter --",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- and then perhaps read it.",
        "A: We'll wind up, yes. I have a stack of letters here that you can see is quite an\nimpressive collection of -- of -- of letters that I received from my first book. And you\nknow, I got only one criticism in that whole time on the first book and it was from a\nPolish man -- a Pole, not a Jew, who objected to my stating in the book that the Poles\nwere the most anti-Semitic nation in -- in Europe and he pointed out to me in that letter,\nwhich of course I saved, that the Poles had done a lot for the Jews back in the olden days,\nwhich 1s correct. The kings of Pole -- Poland took the Jews in and let them prosper there\nand indeed they prospered in Poland. The Jewish community of Poland was outstanding.\nBut during Hitler time, I remain with my -- with my statement that Poland was the most\nviolently anti-Semitic country in Europe. But all the other letters, except for that one,\nwere -- were with me -- were with me. Some were eye openers, that they didn\u2019t know\nwhat was going on. Some said, \u201cYeah, I was there too and you described it just right.\u201d\nOthers thanked me for opening up and others complimented me for being able to do it.\nAnd that was, of course, in \u201883, after my first book came out. Now I wrote a second book\nand that came out in \u201893 and I wrote that for a younger audience and you know, the\ninteresting thing 1s, I did not get the response that I got the first time. I don\u2019t know why.\nIt may have to do with the editor\u2019s broadcasting it less, publish it -- publicizing it less.\nBut I give the book to Bat Mitzvah and Bas Mitzvah -- and Bar Mitzvah kids and kids\nthat I think would understand. They are 12 and 13 years old and they should know. And I\ngave it recently to one of my little -- little 13 year -- 12 year old friends who had a -- a --\na Bat Mitzvah. She lives actually right across the street from me and she writes me, \u201cDear\nDr. and Mrs. Rudolf Haas, thank you very much for celebrating this special occasion with\nme. Your gift was wonderful. I finished the book with a completely different attitude\ntoward the Holocaust. I was often afraid to read Holocaust books, because I feared they\nwould give me nightmares. Reading the stories of all these people made me realize how\nmany good people there were. I also need to remember that the Holocaust was a reality\nand it wasn\u2019t a nightmare. Thank you for everything you have done for me. Sincerely,\nSophie Rappaport.\u201d And that was now -- that\u2019s a young girl, that -- the third generation\nafter me. It still lives and they still want to know.",

        "Answer: My what?",
        "A: Oh yes. Okay, I do -- I do begin. I\u2019m Gerda Haas, born Gerda Schild, in Anspach,\nGermany and I\u2019m now sitting in Minneapolis in my very comfortable home, with the sun\ncoming in on all sides and you, Katie Davis are interviewing me on this September the\n23rd, I believe, is it?",
        "A: 25th?",
        "A: Right. And I understand that the purpose of the interview is to -- to talk mainly, but\nnot exclusively about life after liberation and I really like to do that. When I first received\nthe letter from the United States Holocaust Museum about your visit to me, I -- I really,\nseriously began thinking about my life after liberation. And it seemed a good time, too.\nThis is -- in the Jewish calendar, this is what we call the Assera siamata shuva, the 10\ndays between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, where we are supposed to think about\nour lives and what we have done and have we done it correctly, have we any regrets?\nWould you like to do it any differently? And it seemed a very appropriate time to -- to --\nto go through my 75 -- 75 and a half years on this earth and thank you for giving me that\nopportunity.",
        "A: Sure. Pll be happy to do that. My maiden name was Schild, that\u2019s spelled S-c-h-1-I-d.\nMy father\u2019s name was Siegfried Schild, good German name and he came from a very\nsmall town on the Mian river, by the name of Hessdorf. And he was a butcher and in\nthose days, families had to marry off their sons and daughters for a purpose, so since he\nwas a butcher, a -- my grandparents looked for an opportunity for him to marry into a\nbutcher shop. It was as simple as that. That\u2019s the way it was 1n the olden days. And there\nwas this Paula Yoksburger in Anspach, who was one of five daughters and her parents,\nmy grandparents, Sophie and Gabriel Yoksburger were very hard up to marry off their\nfive daughters without money. You see, in those days you needed to have money to\nmarry off a daughter. And finally, they knew of this young man in Hessdorf who was\nlooking for a -- what they called a shiduch, a -- a match between himself and someone\nwho was somewheres in the butcher business. And it worked out fine, even though my\nmother was two years older and I\u2019m sure there was no great love, but it was a marriage in\nthose days that was called very appropriate and very good and it -- 1t was fine.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, he had a butcher shop in Anspach, no sons and he needed to have a son-in-law\nthat would step into his butcher shop. And, as a matter of fact, he died very soon after his\ndaughter\u2019s sa -- his -- his daughter Paula was married to this young butcher boy from\nHessdorf and it -- it worked out just wonderfully. He died and the son-in-law stepped into\nthe butcher shop in Anspach and there was my mother and father and soon after -- a year\nafter the marriage there was one daughter, my sister Freidel and two and a half years after\nthat, I arrived, Gerda. And the only regret my father had up to his dying day, that he\ndidn\u2019t have a son. In Anspach, it would have been necessary to hand the butcher shop\nover to a son. But as it turned out, that reason fell completely away and I guess he got\nover not having a son. He -- he -- he was okay with his two daughters.",
        "A: Yes, I did a little research on my family at one time. The Schild family -- the ones that\nlived in Hessdorf, my father\u2019s side of the family, apparently came out of Spain in the\n17th or 18th century with that wave of emigration that -- that -- that was triggered by the\ne-emancipation in Spain. And apparently that\u2019s where my family comes from, because\nmy Jewish na -- my Hebrew name is Sprinza, which 1s Esperanza for -- for a young girl.\nAnd apparently I had a grandmother or a great-grandmother or some female ancestor --\nancestress I would say, a female ancestor, who -- who was a Spaniard. And apparently\nthat\u2019s what happened on my father\u2019s side. On my mother\u2019s side, the story is that we came\n-- that they came from a very small town called Yoksburg and as you probably know, in -\n- in the 18th century, the -- the Jews finally got last names. Up to then it was Moshe the\nbutcher or Jakob -- Yakob the shoemaker, they didn\u2019t have names. And apparently, when\nthey -- when the time came, when the decree was passed down that the Jews had to have\nnames, many of them took the name of their town -- of the town they lived in. So that\u2019s\nwhy you have so many Berlinner and Hamburger and -- and of small tow -- Frankfurter\nor Kissinger. These are all people that came from particular towns and that\u2019s how my\ngrandparents were named Yoksburger, because they had lived in a small town called\nYoksburg, which is very close to Anspach. You must understand that, in opposition to\nAmerica, where the Jews are all clustered and -- and congregated in large cities, this was\nnot the case in Europe. In Europe, Poland, Germany and all the many countries of\nEurope, the Jewish communities -- the strong Jewish communities were in the small\ntowns, because there the people left them in peace. There was always anti-Semitism, but\nin small towns, very frequently they were able to buy themselves the protection of the --\nof the lord. They were called Markgraffen or whoever owned these little towns and by\nbeing servile to these feudal lords and being useful to them, they were able to get the\nprotection and they settled in those small towns and they remained very Orthodox, many\nof them. There was nothing else, it was Orthodoxy or nothing.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yes. Yes, I would. We had the -- we had a rabbi who was a -- a leader in -- 1n -- in the\n-- in the ge -- in the European German commu -- Jewish community. His name was Eli\nMunck. He wrote several seminal books on -- on the pr -- the prayers, the world of prayer\nfor instance and the call of the Torah. He was just a very great light in -- in Jewish\nintelligencia. And I -- Id like to say this, which many people forget. Th-Th-Th-The\nGerman rabbis were able to become so great and to devote themselves to writing because\nthey were not hired by the community. Here, a rabbi is beholden to his board of directors\nand to his president and to the wives, in order to keep his job and he has very little time to\n-- to -- to be independent, to think stuff on his own. But in Europe -- in Germany\nparticularly, religion was a state -- spa -- state sponsored affair. Each one of us had to pay\na religion tax and the Jewish religion tax went to pay the rabbis and upkeep the\nsynagogues and the other -- the Christian religion tax went their way. So the rabbis were\nvery free and we were very fortunate to have just two fantastic rabbis in a row. When I\nwas very young, our rabbi was Pinhusk Horn, which was also a name that stands forever\nin -- in -- in Jewish history of Germany. And then we had this wonderful Eli Munck, who\ndevoted himself to writing and to bringing up the youngsters, because he knew that the\nfuture of Judaism was in the youngsters. I -- I\u2019d like to say one other thing that only\noccurred to me very recently. Th-The rabbis in Germany did not urge the Jews to leave\nand I remember my parents holding that somewhat against Rabbi Munck. Why didn\u2019t he\nsay, \u201cGo find yourself another place to go to.\u201d He never did. And it only occurred to me\nvery recently that this was for the obvious reason that the rabbis were state employed,\nyou see? Do you understand what I\u2019m saying? They couldn\u2019t say that or they -- or Hitler\nwould have knocked them off in a minute. The rabbis were completely dominated by the\nstate. And -- and the outgrowth of that thought is thank God for the separation of state\nand church in this country. So you -- you live a long time before these things really dawn\non you. You know, we adored this rabbi and we believed everything he said and we did\neverything he said. But he didn\u2019t tell us to leave, you see? Think about that. Is -- it\u2019s\nreally -- it\u2019s a revelation when that thought came to me. He himself left with his family,\nafter awhile and saved himself and his many children, but he didn\u2019t tell us to leave.",
        "A: That\u2019s --",
        "A: [ know.",
        "A: Yeah, first of all, I want to spell his name, so people know who I\u2019m talking about. It\nwas Eli Munck, M-u-n-c-k. Dr. Eli Munck and he is very famous rabbi. He left and went\nto Paris afterwards and founded a -- a fine, deeply religious Jewish community in Paris,\nRu cardet. And I\u2019m still very friendly with many of his children. Now, how did it affect\nme? I adored the man, you see? In -- in -- in Germany, the rabbi was somewhere between\nyour father and God, equi-distance. And I particularly liked the Munck family. I was like\na child in their house myself. And it didn\u2019t change my feelings toward him. Also, one of\nthe reasons it didn\u2019t change my feelings toward him was when I was liberated -- and now\nI\u2019m jumping ahead several years -- when I was liberated to Switzerland and ended up in\nMontrou -- Seulemontre at Laisavont, I found out very soon that Eli Munck and his\nwhole family had fled from Paris and had established themselves in Geneva. And once I\nknew that, I got in touch with him and he with me. And he was the first person I saw\nagain, of my for-former life. You can\u2019t argue with feelings, you see? I loved the man and\nhere I saw him again, after all I had gone through and I credited him in a way with my res\n-- religiosity. He gave me that strong belief in God and he guided me through my\nyounger years. My parents were busy and making a living and were very simple people,\nno education. And he -- he gave me a lot. I -- I didn\u2019t change my feelings toward him, I\nhave to say. It should have, but 1-it didn\u2019t.",
        "A: Yes. I -- I -- I have several pictures of him. We were very friendly here, in this count -\n- after Switzerland, after I got to his -- this country, he went back -- he and his family\nwent back to Paris and then he retired and I can\u2019t tell you now the year, but 1t must have\nbeen -- oh yes, I can tell you the year. In the 70\u2019s -- in the 19 six -- late 60\u2019s or early 70\u2019s,\nhe and his wife retired and came over here for the same reason we came to Minneapolis.\nThey had children in -- living in New York and they came over to retire in New York.\nWe were still living in Maine at the time and my -- my great admiration and love for him\nand his wife, went so far as to make a new friendship between them and my husband and\nmyself. And we visited them several times in New York and he came up to Maine and\nstayed with us for awhile. And I have several letters by him and pictures of him. He was\na smallish man, very trim, very neat. Little beard and dark, alert eyes and he had a little\nFrench sing-song accent in his voice, because he was actually born in Paris, but I don\u2019t\nremember how come. And his wife was a jolly, roundish, lovely woman, always smiling,\nalways happy a-and I -- I just like them both.",
        "A: No -- well, he was -- I -- I have to tell you a very funny story. When we came to\nSwitzerland -- and I like to talk about that at some more length later on, but just now, in\nconnection with my great friendship with Eli Munck, when I was liberated to\nSwitzerland, we -- that whole transport, were again put into a lager -- into a concentration\nlager, it was nothing like what I just came out of, it was the grand hotel in mont -- in -- in\nSeulemontre, in Laisavont. I might have a picture of it, it was a gorgeous hotel that was\nemptied out for us, so that we -- these 12 hun -- it wasn\u2019t the whole group, it was maybe\n300 people, could be put up in great comfort with this gorgeous view of Lake Geneva\nbelow us and Montplant on the other sides and -- and all the mountains around us, so\ndon\u2019t think it was a -- a concentration camp, but it was a concentrating lager so that we\ncould be controlled. We couldn\u2019t roam around. We had to check in and check out, we had\nguards on the doors. We had to always be in -- tell them where we went. And so, I\nwanted to visit my beloved Rabbi Munck in Geneva. And somehow -- I don\u2019t know how,\nI got myself a ticket to -- to go there on the -- on the train. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s very -- it\u2019s a very\nshort distance, as you know. It\u2019s just a -- a little bit around on the lake of Geneva. And I\nasked for permission to -- to go and the permission was denied. And you know what I\ndid? I left secretly, on my own, to see my beloved rabbi. And you know what happened?\nTwo Swiss policemen caught me on the train station in Montrou as I was just about to\nstep onto that train and took me back and put me into what was like a -- a little solitary\nconfinement. Again, in great luxury, but it was a locked door and a locked window and I\nhad my food passed in and out. This because I needed so badly to see the rabbi and his\nfamily. Can you believe it?",
        "A: I disobeyed. I thought -- I thought this was more important than -- I c -- I couldn\u2019t\neven understand why they didn\u2019t grant me the -- so then, to follow up on the story, I --\nthe rabbi heard about it, because I had told them to meet me at the train, so I had to\nsomehow tell them that I was now imprisoned at the Grand Hotel in -- in Laisavont, so\nthey came to see me. And I don\u2019t believe that they let me out. I think we talked through\nthe window. I -- I don\u2019t have a recollection of actually seeing them, but we saw each\nother and -- and it was just wonderful. So then afterwards, when things loosened up a\nlittle -- this was very soon after I got there and in a way I really don\u2019t blame them. We\nweren\u2019t allowed to roam Switzerland at will, so here was my -- my petition was denied,\nbut then after awhile -- this was in February, or say March, then in April, at Paisa --\nPassover time, they allowed me to join the Munck family for Paisa. The things that I\nremember now, after all these years. And the funny thing 1s, tho-those Munck children,\nwho were then -- well, the oldest daughter is six years younger than I am, so I was 20 -- I\nwas 23 when I got out of -- was I? I think I was 20 f -- 23 or four when I got out of\nTheresienstadt. So she was six years younger and she remembers this very well. I\u2019m still\nin great contact with them. She is now |-lady -- the Lady Acobowitz. She 1s now the --\nthe wife of the Chief Rabbi of -- the former Chief Rabbi of England -- of Great Britain.\nAnd we often exchange little remembrances like this.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It was, yes.",
        "A: I remember that there was one little piece of chicken for the whole family and frau --\nDr. Munck cut it into very, very small pieces and everybody had just a little bit to eat, but\nit was the very first time that I ate chicken again. How strange that I should remember\nthat instead of -- instead of some very spiritual emotions. I-It was just an emotional event.\nIt was just a very emotional event. I was, of course, very friendly with the -- with the\nchildren that were born in Anspach, but since then they had had three more and so I was\ninvolved with those babies and -- and talking -- the one thing I remember, we didn\u2019t talk\nabout the Holocaust at all. They didn\u2019t talk about their flight to Switzerland and I didn\u2019t\ntalk about my time in Theresienstadt and I didn\u2019t talk about losing my mother and sister.\nOf course, at that point, I was still hoping to find them. So, it was just great to be able to\ntravel and to -- to walk the streets and not be picked up by either Ger-Germans or Swiss,\nthat was so funny. And it was great.",
        "A: With God?",
        "A: Good question, good question and it\u2019s a question that is to date unresolved, but Ill --\nPll try to go back. I ca -- I come from a very basic Orthodox family. No great learning,\nbut just simple, basic belief that God wrote the Torah and whatever is in the Torah,\nbecause God wrote it, you obey it. You don\u2019t ask why, you don\u2019t argue, you don\u2019t go into\ndiscussions, you just do it. This actually helped me, because I so basically and -- and\norganically believed all this. You see, you say your night prayers every night, you get rid\nof all the bad things that happened during the day and you only focus on -- on -- on\nasking for the good things, for the health of your parents and your grandparents and your\nsister and your teachers and your rabbi. And this helped me a great deal because\nunquestioningly, I believed that right through the Holocaust. I remember having the first\nqualms about it, when I actually learned that my mother and sister had been killed so\ncruelly. My mother, this religious person who gave me all that wonderful belief, how\ncould she have been killed? And my sister, who believed just as I did? And I -- I\nremember changing places, actually, with God. I -- my belief was always I had to account\nfor the things I did wrong and all of a sudden it occurred to me, what about the things\nGod did wrong? Doesn\u2019t He have a responsibility to me too, that He killed my mother\nand my sister and my aunts and uncles and cousins. All my friends, everybody I had with\nthe all -- sole exception of my father. And you know, you are -- you were so ingrained\nwith that fear of coming up to heaven when you die and you have to give an account of\nyourself and it occurred to me very suddenly, God will have to give an account to me,\ntoo. And from then on, my faith reverted itself. I remember that very clearly, because it\nwas a great struggle. My father remained completely religious. I asked him once what he\nthought of his wife and daughter being slaughtered like -- li -- like -- like the 6,000,000\nwere and everybody knows now -- we didn\u2019t know at the time and we didn\u2019t want to\nknow. But once we knew how they died, I asked him once, \u201cDoesn\u2019t that impair your\nfaith a little bit?\u201d He said, \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s the way God wanted it. God did it. God gave them life\nand God took it away.\u201d I guess it\u2019s one way of looking at it. We never ask why we are\nborn, so we really have no reason to ask why he takes life away from us. But anyway,\nwhat was your question? How it impair -- so now my -- I\u2019m still Orthodox. I still observe\nall the things that I learned in my youth. Number one, because I never wanted to\ndisappoint my father. Number two, because I married a very religious man and number\nthree, it -- 1t gives meaning to my life, you know? You observe the holidays, it\u2019s great,\nthe family gathers around the Yuntive table and -- and you go to synagogue. But that\nbasicness that I have mentioned before, that -- that organic feeling, that\u2019s gone. Now I\nobserve the religion for -- for other reasons. Because I -- I have to do something. I have\nto believe in something. And also, one of the great reasons that I -- I still -- that I haven\u2019t\nchanged my ways at all is that actually God was very good to me. Look at my life. I have\na great husband, I have four very, very nice children. I have four very nice in-law\nchildren. I have 11 grandkids. Not one of them is retarded or has crooked teeth or -- or\ncross-eyed or club feet. They\u2019re all great people. So how can I not be grateful? How can I\n-- how can I be so arrogant as to say, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe any more.\u201d I di -- I didn\u2019t\ndeserve it. I didn\u2019t deserve this 50 years of sunshine in my life. So I live with the --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: Yes, I -- I\u2019d like very much to talk about that. Let me just go back a little bit. After I\nleft my parents home, at the age of just barely 18, just after my 18th birthday, in 1941 and\n-- in 1940 -- and went to Berlin to train as a nurse, I did -- I -- I joined the Jewish hospital\nin Berlin, asking immediately to be put onto the kosher side. At that point there was still a\nsmall table of kosher people and actually, I was able to eat kosher throughout those years\nthat I was in -- in the Jewish hospital in Berlin. I don\u2019t think I observed the Sabbath quite\nthe way I -- I should have, but I surely didn\u2019t go out and -- and gallivant around. I may\nhave worked, but I didn\u2019t do anything else. And then when I got to Theresienstadt -- and\nthis 1s all still radiating from my childhood, you see, unquestioningly what ga -- God\ndoes, is the right thing. And then I got to Theresienstadt and then of course the food\nbecame a big problem. And I remember to this day, the struggle I had with myself when I\nfinally decided that I\u2019m going to eat that soup that had those little pieces of -- of sinister\nlooking meat floating around in them. I -- I refused them for a long time, but finally I\nthought maybe I -- I should, in order to keep my strength up. And I remember quite well\nwhat a struggle that was. And after I had decided to do that, I -- I continued to -- to eat\nthat -- that horrible stuff. Whether it did me any good or not, I don\u2019t know. But when I\ngot to Switzerland, I again asked to be put into the kosher contingency. I-I-It didn\u2019t work\nout quite that va - mu -- that way, but I'll tell you about that later. And in Theresienstadt,\nI did continue my -- my nightly prayers. That became a habit, it made me feel good. I\ncould fall asleep easily and I felt it was just very necessary to pray for my people. I knew\nthey weren\u2019t sitting on beds of roses. And I didn\u2019t know where my father was and how he\nwas faring and of course I always prayed that I would see everybody again. And I -- I\nthink that answers your question.",
        "A: Well, I would say -- I would say that was in the 1950\u2019s, when I definitely became\naware that they were not coming back. Up to then, you know how it 1s, 1f you don\u2019t see\nthem die, they are not dead. Oh yes, 6,000,000 were killed, but not my mother and not\nmy sister. And that feeling that the next telephone call is theirs. Or the next person you\nmeet in a party 1s my sister and she had amnesia and she doesn\u2019t know who she 1s and I\nrecognize her and I bring back all the memories. These are the dreams and the hopes and\nthe prayers that you have for a long time, until it finally sinks in that they really are dead.\nAnd I -- I kind of remember too, when -- when that finally happened. When it finally\nsank in. I guess it was when my father remarried. I guess then I finally gave up. But for a\n-- for a long time you -- you just -- you just don\u2019t want to believe that. I -- I\u2019d like to say\nsomething about death as such. Th-The -- my mother, of course, as I have said in my\nprevious interview, was killed in Riga and most probably in -- in the woods in front of\nthe firing squads. And it was a long, long, long, many years before I could say that\nwithout breaking down. And I\u2019m not even sure I can do it now. And my sister -- it\u2019s not\nvery clear to me whether she was killed in -- in Auschwitz or also in front of a firing\nsquad, but again, after I knew all that, I was still hoping maybe they died already in the --\nin the trains, so that they wouldn\u2019t have to -- to do that horrible end. But I wanted to say\nsomething about my father\u2019s death. My father died in 1986, only 12 years ago, at the age\nof 92. And I, at that time was about 65 years old, is that correct? Or 63? Anyway, I was a\n-- certainly a very middle aged woman. And until then, I had not seen a relative of mine\ndie of a natural death. And you know, it was almost a jubilation that I was able to see\nsomeone die naturally. That I -- I -- that I could sit Shiva, that I could all the things that\none does for the dead. And I -- I -- I remember almost a feeling of joy. Of -- of -- of -- of\nfulfillment. It was very strange.",
        "A: Well, we needed to keep a day for -- for Yahrtzeit, for the observation of the dead and\nat the time, the rabbis said that we could pick any day we wanted to. There was a choice\nof picking their birthdays or the day they were evacuated, or -- or Yom Kippur, which is\ncoming up next week. A lot of people simply keep Yom Kippur. I decided, since my\nhusband\u2019s mother died and we kne -- she died a natural death in Frankfurt and we of\ncourse knew the death date, I decided to s -- to pick that very day and I observe my\nmother\u2019s and my sister\u2019s Yahrtzeit at that particular date and my husband observes not\nonly his mother\u2019s death, who-who he knows and who 1s buried in Frankfurt, but also his\ntwo sisters, with their five children -- six chil -- six children -- that were killed an\nunknown date. And so, at that particular day at my mother-in-law\u2019s day of Yahrtzeit, we\nlight one, two, three, four, five -- we light ten Yahrtzeit lits for the people that we -- for\nthe immediate people that we lost. And that\u2019s how we resolved that particular problem.\nBut did you ask me whether my father and I ever talked about my mother and my sister?\nYou didn\u2019t ask me that, but I --",
        "A: Please do. No. And that is a great source of anguish to me. For a long time, I -- I felt\nresentment that my father had left us, actually. I remember the day in August, the first of\nAugu -- no, the last days of -- the first of July in 1939, when he left on a transport to -- to\nEngla-England. And of course we hoped to follow very soon, but then the war came and\nwe were separated, permanently, in my mother\u2019s and sister\u2019s case, not in mine. And I -- I\nremember feeling great resentment against that, which was illogical and uncalled for. But\nagain, feelings are feelings and you ha -- you have to deal with them. And I particularly\nfelt very guilty -- or -- about my mother\u2019s and sister\u2019s death. For some strange reason, I\nthought that I could have saved them, or I could have done -- done something for them,\nor I should have gone with them and be there, too. And my father, apparently never had\nthese feelings. At least, he never voiced them in his long, long life. And to the very end --\nI stayed with him a month before he died, knowing that he would be dying and I hung on\nevery word of his that he still said and I was so hoping that he would say a word of -- of -\n- of explanation or resent -- or regret or sorrow or apology or something. But he didn\u2019t\nand I live with that.",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t have that kind of a relationship. We weren\u2019t brought up to question our\nparents. But I had such a guilt feeling that I actually had to go to a psychiatrist to get rid\nof it. But he apparently had not. And I also resented a little bit -- again, for totally\nillogical, because the man was 45 years old when he was alone, I resented a little bit ha --\nthat he married again. But that was, of course, stupid. But there 1s it.",
        "A: No, unfortunately, I didn\u2019t and I\u2019m -- I\u2019m very sorry about that now. Because she too\nlost a husband and two sons in Theresienstadt. And she looked to me for a replacement\nand I just seem -- didn\u2019t seem to understand that. And just the last few years, I -- I really\nfeel that -- that I missed the boat there. That I really could have done a lot better. But, you\nknow, there is a [indecipherable] we had a -- a friend who was from Vienna and he -- he\ndidn\u2019t distinguish himself in any way, he was just a simple fellow, but he will be\nremembered in my family for something he said. And he always said to us, in his heavy\nViennese accent, \u201cYou get too old too soon and too smart, too late.\u201d And how true that 1s.\nI -- I got too smart much too late after my stepmother was long dead, I realized that I -- I\nreally could have done a lot better. Well, that\u2019s one of the things God can call me to task\nfor. And He probably will and He should.",
        "A: Well, I was in very good shape. Number one, I was young. And number two, I had\nworked myself up into a nurse\u2019s position 1n -- into a supervisory nurse\u2019s position in the\nchildren home. And that meant I got S ration -- r-ration -- special ration. I had no longer\nto go with my little food pot to -- to the window where they dished out a little ladle of\nsoup and the next one pushed right after me and I had to leave. The soup was now\nbrought to the children\u2019s home and we had enough of that. Also, at that point -- I\u2019m sure I\nspoke of that in my earlier recollections, I -- I had a young man who -- who liked me very\nmuch. It didn\u2019t amount to anything because you know, we had curfew, we couldn\u2019t get\ntogether, but he -- he just adored me. He was the brother of one of the women whose\nbaby was in the nursing home. So he came and he -- he worked in the co -- into -- in the\nconcentration camp\u2019s bakery. And he, from time to time, brought me and my f -- and the\nwoman I lived with, Eva, my girlfriend Eva, bread. And of course that was a lifesaver. It\nreally, really was. And also -- you see, the Swiss people -- the -- I\u2019m sorry, the Czech\npeople that were in Theresienstadt were allowed to get packages and from time to time,\nthe Czech women that we -- we lived with in that basement of ours, below the children\u2019s\nhome, would grudgingly share their apples or their little bits of f-food that they had, with\nus. There was a great divide between the Czech prisoners and us, but once in awhile they\ns -- they had pity on us. So I was in pretty good condition and I was picked because I was\nin good condition. We all -- y-you know the story how I was saved. It was 1200 Jews,\neach one of them had to appear before the Commandant Ram and we were picked for our\nlooks, you see. If we were dehydrated and emaciated, out. So I was number seven -- s -- I\nwas number 1174 and Eva was 1173 and we looked good, so we left. And on the train to\nTheresienstadt, we got all those delicacies that we didn\u2019t even know what they were.\nWho had [indecipherable] -- who had ever seen a banana before? Who knew what a\nsardine looked like? So we gorged ourselves before we even got to Switzerland and in\nSwitzerland -- I do need to say something about the feeling that is still so vivid with me,\nof freedom. Wh-What actually is freedom? Freedom at that point was air that smelled\ngood. Air that you could take in and breathe. And people who were smiling. People on\nthe -- on the station that looked up and smiled at you. People who didn\u2019t wear stars and\nhad nice clothes and stockings on. And mainly, freedom was people in uniform that\ndidn\u2019t hit you. People in uniform that spoke courteously to you. And freedom was\nbeautiful landscape and -- and -- and -- and looking out the window and not being\nshouted at or shot at. And -- and freedom was just a -- a great relief. And also freedom\nwas not to have -- Ill say it in -- not in the negative, but in the positive, freedom was to\nhave lights at night, to have a ci -- a -- a city lit up, you see? I had lived 12 years and six\nof tho -- 12 years in Nazi regime and six of those in war and every night you were taken\nto prison if you had a little light shining through. And here was this Switzerland with all\nthe lights blazing. I couldn\u2019t get over it the first night. Why aren\u2019t they tel -- why aren\u2019t\nthey blacking out their -- it was -- don\u2019t you forget, it was still war. I got to Switzerland\nin February -- 12th, I believe. And the war didn\u2019t end and they had all their lights on.\nThat\u2019s freedom.",
        "A: That\u2019s a good question. That\u2019s a good question. I think perhaps 1t was when they told\nus to rip off the star and put lipstick on. I don\u2019t recall that particular -- I think it was when\nI looked out the window and saw the people smiling and that was all -- what I have said\nthere in such verbiosity was all just one little moment in my life. We got into\nSwitzerland, th-the SS came thr -- it wasn\u2019t the SS any more, it was the -- the Red Cross\npeople came through, told us to rip off the star and put up -- put on lipstick and we\nopened up the windows. And then the Swiss p -- the Swiss gendarmes in their uniforms\ncame through. I think that was the moment. And they called us nice, with names and\nsmiled and -- and asked what we wanted and we looked -- I remember that, looking out\nthe window, so we would le -- Eva and I -- Eva and I were inseparable at that point and\nPll have something to say about that in a moment. But I remember we let down the\nwindow and looked out and we smelled that air and -- of course, I\u2019m repeating myself,\nbut that was -- I think that was the moment. I -- I wanted to just say something about Eva\nand I being so inseparable and it ties in with the questions about religion that you asked\nbefore. Eva was not religious and she opted -- wh-when we got to Sengale and we had a\nlist of -- of so -- so-called concentration hotels that we could request and she wanted to\ngo to Les Auvants, there were others who off -- other ki -- hotels or places that offered\nkosher food, which I would have chosen. But she wanted so much to go to Les Auvants\nand I did not want to lose her, that I went to Les Auvants with her. And I remember that I\n-- that I didn\u2019t eat the meat then any more, because I was so close to my old rabbi again.\nBut anyway, I didn\u2019t stay in Les Auvants very long and -- and then I went to an old friend\nof mine from -- from the city of Kissingin, that I found in Lucerne. And there again, you\nsee, Kissinger 1s named because he came from that city of Kissingin, where I had a close\nfriend. And when this friend of mine from -- formerly from Kissingin whose name was --\nwas Truda Lustig at the time, but who had married a Swiss guy by the name of Erelinger.\nWhen she heard that I was in that Les Auvants transport, she immediately requested that I\ncome to her home and there I was completely rehabilitated to Kashrut and Shomair\nShabbat and the whole bit. Oh, what a story.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And think -- think of us with nice thoughts. Think of us kindly. What a farce. Oh, you\nremembered that from my interview? I remember it, too. Remember that we treated you\nnicely. What a farce. But we were so taken up with our own emotions, oh, the heck with\nhim.",
        "A: You know, you -- you know, you are asking a very good question and I need to come\nback to that later. Because we were frightened, we thought the SS were reaching -- we --\nwe had been living in fear for 12 years. In fear for our possessions and our lives and our\npeople. Fear doesn\u2019t go away the minute you open a window and smell freedom. So, yes,\nI would say we did. But I -- I -- let\u2019s be sure that I say something about that fear that had\nrepercussions to this very day. I'll -- Pll -- I'll say it later, you had some other questions,\ndidn\u2019t you? Perhaps I\u2019d better say it now, because 1-it does fit into the fear business.\nWhen we got to Les Auvants, after he had told us to remember him kindly, I forgot that.\nConsciously I forgot it, but very obviously, sub-consciously I didn\u2019t, because when we\ngot to Les Auvants, one of the first things I needed to do, was to write down things from\nthe past 12 years. I don\u2019t know what the other people did, but I si-simply had this -- this -\n- this need to get rid of all this. You see, here -- here I came out of Theresienstadt into\nthis luxury hotel with all the food I wanted, with that view in front of me and I needed a\ntransition. And so I asked for a typewriter and -- and some paper, which I got and I\nstayed in my room for several days and just catharsis. And -- and then I met -- how I met\nDr. Clay, I do not remember. I think I met him through Eli Munck. I met -- I met a man\nby the name of Dr. Clay, who was an official with the Swedish embassy -- embassy, I\nbelieve. He -- he was high up. And when he heard that I had written things down, he\nwanted it. And I let him have a copy of everything I wrote, with the condition that he not\nuse my name. I still have his letter -- I can show it to you, where he answers me that he\nwill of course honor my request. He would like to publish what I wrote, but he will not\nname me, Gerda Schild, by name. Now, in the 19 -- late 1980\u2019s or even 90\u2019s, I read a\nbook -- I forgot the name of the author, we can look it up, by the title \u201cStella\u201d, a famous\nbook where a -- a Berlin -- a survivor of the Holocaust who stayed in Berlin, one of the\nhidden Jews, writes about Berlin. And I read this book with such intensity, because I was\nthere. He talks about street corners where I lived and places where I was. And I come\nacross a section in the book that was my voice. I -- I could -- I could tell, 1t was -- I said\nthat. It was the story of when the nurses came to -- were taken to the Kasalen to help\nthese people a-at the Fabric transport. And here I am reading, and I said to my husband,\n\u201cThis is my story.\u201d And I go quick and I see -- I see where he got this from, he -- it\u2019s a\nvery well documented book. I forgot his name, I can look it up. And he -- he documents\nmy story, anonymous nurse from Berlin and I -- I look and see where he got it from and\nby God, he got it out of the publication of Dr. Clay from Geneva. I wrote to him and I\ndocumented -- I wrote him a copy of that letter where Dr. Clay said he will publish it, but\nwithout a name and I was really hoping to hear from, but he never answered. He never\nanswered and that was, of course, at least six or seven years ago. But, you see, that\u2019s how\nthe ripple of fear goes to -- to 1990. Here I realized -- and this document of Dr. Clay, I\nsee by his notes -- by his footnotes, is in the librar -- in th -- in the library -- in the\nnational library of Paris, the French National Library of Paris. Isn\u2019t that some story? I had\ngoosebumps when I read that. But the interesting thing is that I kept the Clay letter, that I\nknow that is my story without my name.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: I know it. I don\u2019t know -- I don't remember. I think it was mostly -- well, I -- I don\u2019t\nrecall that, actually. I -- I do not recall. Some feelings have fallen through the cracks,\nbecause there were other things that were important. The important thing was to see\nMunck. How I felt, I don\u2019t recall. I must have felt embarrassment. I -- I -- I\u2019m sorry, I just\ndon\u2019t recall it. I only remember being taken back by two -- between two Swiss uniformed\npolicemen. It was terrible. And being put into that cell -- that Grand Hotel prison. It was\nterrible. I don\u2019t remember what I felt.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: What do you mean?",
        "A: No, never. I don\u2019t think we would have told them much, either. We didn\u2019t feel -- w-we\nwere very afraid. We were -- freedom had to grow on us very slowly. And that\u2019s why I --\nthat\u2019s what I like so much on this country. Freedom 1s their birthright. They don\u2019t even\nquestion it. I like that and that\u2019s why things lik -- like that can\u2019t happen here. And I -- I --\nI always could see it when I was speaking to classes. They ask such -- such unbelievable\nquestions like after I told them my whole story, how we\u2019re driven out of our home and\neverything, \u201cWhy did you have to leave? It was your house.\u201d God bless them, they have\nfreedom written all over them. You see? But we had to grow into that feeling of that very\nslowly.",
        "A: I think so. I think we were afraid. D-During the first few months, I think my thoughts\nta -- all clustered around the people that were still missing. I s -- checked every list I\ncould get ahold of to see 1f my mother and sister would -- would be there. And I needed\nto find my father, I had no address for him. He had left for England, but then he was\nfurther evacuated to the United States. And we had written to each other while I was still\nin Munich and Berlin, but not any more in Theresienstadt. And so I -- I wrote to the Red\nCross to s -- to see where -- what his address was, but before the Red Cross answered, he\nalready had found my name on the list of those 1200 that had gone to Switzerland. And\nagain, through the Red Cross, he sent me a telegram with his address and then he sent\nmoney and food and it was just wonderful. But to you quest -- specifically to your\nquestion, I think -- I -- I would say with certainty now, that our thoughts were forward\nand not backward. I\u2019d gotten rid of it all, \u2019'd written it down. D-Don\u2019t forget, I was like\n22 or 23 or 24 years old. I -- I wanted to live. I wanted to have nice clothes and I wanted\nto have a boyfriend and I wanted to go out and -- and I -- I was looking forward. I guess\nit\u2019s human nature. I wanted to know where my people were and then I wanted to go on\nliving. And I did. I did.",
        "A: Oh, I would say within -- within a month, I would say. Because those lists were\nimmediately publicized. Don\u2019t you know it was one of the conditions that Himmler set?\nHe said h-he wanted money and he wanted good publicity in American papers and by\ngosh, he got it. I don\u2019t know if it was good publicity, but he got publicity. The list was\npublished and my father told me later -- he\u2019d by then had a little butcher shop again in --\nin New York, that\u2019s all he knew. He -- all he knew was -- he had no education, so again\nhe opened a little butcher shop and he said one of his customers came in with the New\nYork Times list and he said, \u201cSiegfried, ist dusnich stanna tauter? Gerda Schild?\u201d And he\nlooked at it and said, \u201cYes, that\u2019s my daughter.\u201d And then he immediately -- somebody\nhelped him to ask the Red Cross where to send the letter to and I heard from him\nimmediately then.",
        "A: Ah, it was great. And I remember it. I still have it. It said, \u201cWhere -- where 1s mother\nand -- and sister? Where -- how come you are alive?\u201d You know, \u201cWhere are the others?\u201d\nHe gave me quite a gui -- a guilt feeling then, too. I -- I never was on really intimate\nterms with him because I -- it was like a monolith sitting between us, unspoken. But it\nwas always there. And, in addition to it, I always labored throughout my childhood,\nunder the impression or certainty, I don\u2019t know, that he liked my sister more than me. So,\nyou know -- but that\u2019s why I spent the months with him before his death, to see if he\ncouldn\u2019t say a word of love to me, but he never did. He never did, it was not in him. He\nnever, never did. It was too bad, but I\u2019m over it. So, what was your question?",
        "A: Oh, I cabled him, but it was a prepaid cable, you see, one of those things. At that\npoint, incidentally, I was as good as engaged to an old boyfriend from home, you see,\nthat again was one of those like arranged marriages and he was here, also, so in the first --\nin the first cable that he sent me and he said that he was okay and that this boyfriend of\nmine, whose name was Lothar, good German name again -- it shows you how integrated\nwe were in Germany, we all had German names. Nobody was called a Hebrew or an\nIsraeli name, this was unheard of. So anyway, this Lothar also wanted to know that I was\nsafe and I was ha -- very happy and so I cabled back, with love to both these men, my\nfather and -- and this young man, Lothar. And I cabled back that I didn\u2019t know where my\nmother and sister was. And I have that telegram too, because my father saved everything\nand gave it to me afterwards.",
        "A: Oh, it was -- it was really not such a terrible match. It was, you know -- you know, the\nyoung ladies -- young girls in -- in Germany weren\u2019t allowed to -- to have boyfriends or\nanything. But this boy, he liked me very much. He lived in Nuremberg and he came to\nAnspach all the time to -- to -- so to say, visit his relatives, but he really came to visit me.\nAnd we had, you know, one of those very innocent, very naive romances. Even so -- oh, I\nwas very young then, I was maybe 15 or 16 and he wasn\u2019t much older. And the only way\nthat I was allowed to at all go out with him was that my parents said to themselves,\n\u201cWell, he\u2019ll marry her eventually.\u201d Oh, that was the whole shooting match. He liked me\nenough to really wanted to marry me and he came -- must I tell you all this? On the day\nof my engagement to my husband, he came to the door with roses and a little package.\nVery obviously he was going to ask me that day to marry him. So he was more serious\nthan I. But at that point I had already given my hand and heart to Rudy Haas.",
        "A: Yes, I did -- I did.",
        "A: Lothar, yes, I thought of him a great deal. Why? It gave me like a -- like a -- a little\nstring to hang on to. It wasn\u2019t like a lifeline or anything like that, but you know, you\ncouldn\u2019t think about the camp all the time and death and dying and Auschwitz and the\ngas chambers. So you thought of other things. You thought of pleasant things in your\nformer life. You see, in Theresienstadt, everything was the former life, but in\nSwitzerland, zoom to outer space, to future.",
        "A: Well, in Theresienstadt, I looked for them at all the incoming transports, because at\nthat point, I -- I really hoped that somehow they would show up, too, as I had. I -- I had\nno reason to be in Theresienstadt, 1t was God\u2019s gift to me that I was there. As you know,\nit was only for old people and war veterans and very distinguished, prominent Jews and\nMishlinger. So wa -- was -- how did I get there? So, I thought, as long as I got there,\nmaybe my sister and my mother would get there, too. So I screened -- I was living in the\nbar -- in the barracks that overlooked the -- the railroad -- the mouth of the railroad and I\nwas always looking for them. And then when I got to Switzerland, the only way was to\ncall the Red Cross and ask for them, yeah.",
        "A: Not in Theresienstadt. Nobody from Riga came to Theresienstadt. But I had a distant\ncousin who was in Riga and who was saved also and I met her in -- in New York again.\nShe was actually the only person I ever met from Riga. And, of course nobody saw my\nmother, because they were killed the minute they got there.",
        "A: Simply by transport. I looked it up in the -- in the Yad Vashem books. I knew the date\nof her transport, it was -- 1t was se -- it was nov -- how could I forget this? I think it was\nNovember, 1940. No, 1941. Yes, it wa -- no, it was September 1941. Anyway, I knew the\ndate and I don\u2019t know how I could forget it at this point and I looked that transport up,\nfrom Munich to Riga and the fate of the transport is written in very plain language. They\nwere immediately shot upon arrival, the whole transport.",

        "A: Oh, that was when we first visited Yad Vashem. It wasn\u2019t so long ago, maybe in the --\nin the 70\u2019s. Yeah, I would say in the 70\u2019s. But I didn\u2019t know that when I met this girl. But\nI know now why she never met my mother and she would have -- she would have seen\nher. She -- we were relatives.",

You -- you -- you see, that\u2019s the advantage of\nthe Jewish ob -- ritual of -- of mourning.

        "A: Oh yes, that -- well, there was never a question about that, that was -- that was the aim\nof both of us. And it took awhile. I went to the home of my -- of my friend in Lucerne,\nwhere I stayed another six months. It took a whole year before I could -- more than a year\nbefore I could emigrate to the United States. The war didn\u2019t end and the -- the -- the -- the\nAmerican quota system was still from 1914. It was only after the war that they changed it\nand the war board finally acknowledged that -- that we could come over. The Swiss\nneeded to get rid of us. The Swiss were not hospitable, you see. The Swiss took us with\nthe under -- I studied this after -- when I wrote my first book, I studied very closely jus-\njust what happened. And the condition that they made with -- with -- with Himmler and\nMuzi and the -- and the Vad har salah, which I have talked about in my previous\nvideotaping, was that the -- the refugees did not stay in Switzerland. Absolutely not. And\nas soon as we could, we left. And then they handed us a bill for our stay at the hotel,\nwhich was -- is really something. But my father gladly paid it, I\u2019m sure. But no, he did\neverything he could also, to get me over. And we saw each other again in -- just -- just\nduring the Passover holidays of 1946. I arrived by ship and he, being a very religious\nman, did not come to pick me up. He stayed in that place where he -- he went to Boston, I\narrived in Boston. And he had been settled in New York. And he had asked someone -- I\nguess from the -- from the Joint or something to pick me up. He did not consecrate the\nholiday to drive to pick me up. I -- I didn\u2019t question that at the time. I -- I really didn\u2019t. I\nwas so glad to be there and I consecrated the holiday by going in -- with that person who\npicked me up, I don\u2019t remember who she was. And my father had asked someone to take\nhim and me in and we stayed there for the holidays. And th-the -- the predominant\nremembrance of seeing my father again, he came down the stairs and I was at the bottom\nof the stairs, coming in the front door and the -- the -- the -- the main impression that\nstayed with me was that he looked just the way I remembered him. Young and vibrant\nand black hair and nicely dressed. After I had gone through so much, I expected him to --\nto had also gone through so much and be an old, white-haired, little old -- the Jewish\nman. But he wasn\u2019t. He was a young, vibrant man and we took it from there.",

        "A: -- had changed, yes, had changed very much. I guess I hadn\u2019t changed really, either,\nbecause I wasn\u2019t really in a killing camp. I was real-really not that badly off after I heard\nhow everybody else had suffered. I wanted to say something about living with my friend\nin Lucerne and that goes to the point I have made before, that the Holocaust governs my\nwhole life. So in Lucerne, in 1945, when I was rescued and my friend took me in, I took\ncare of her two little kids so that she could go to work. I was like an au pair, you know?\nAnd that was a very happy time, it was a vibrant, Jewish, religious family. And Rosh\nHashanah came and always the -- the husband brought home stray people from the\nsynagogue to have holidays with -- with the family. And, you know, I helped in the\nkitchen, I was st -- you know, I was busy with the whole affairs and I didn\u2019t pay too\nmuch attention whom he brought home. He brought home some American soldiers that\nyear, 1945, to celebrate the Rosh Hashanah holiday with him. Now I am going to 1985,\nAO years later and I\u2019m -- I\u2019m teaching elder hostel at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine\nand I -- I am teaching the Holocaust, upon the request of elder hostel. And I have my -- I\ntal -- taught that for 10 years. It was a very successful course and I -- I have very good\nmemories of telling people what the Holocaust was all about. Not just what I\u2019d gone\nthrough, but the -- the historical background, I -- I started with anti-Semitism in Germany\nand --and how Hitler at all got to power and -- and somehow, within that two week\ncourse, naturally, I legitimized myself and said that I was there, too, and how I had been\nsaved and went to Switzerland and how I had stayed with this Erelinger family. And in\none of my courses, one white haired man gets up and he says to me, \u201cYou state you were\nvery religious at the time and you went to America and you married a physician, didn\u2019t\nyou?\u201d And I was completely taken aback and I said, \u201c\u201cWho are you?\u201d And he was one of\nthe soldiers that Erelinger brought home. And I had corresponded with him, I had a little\nbit of a romance with this handsome soldier, he took me out and you know. And I had\nrome -- I had co-corresponded with him and I had told him, \u201cSorry, I got to stop this\nnow, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m getting married next week to this young doctor.\u201d So he recognized me\nfrom what I told him.",
        "A: His name was Segal -- Larry Segal. And I corresponded -- he -- he went home and\nfound some of the letters I wrote. The Holocaust just stretched out it\u2019s tentacles\nthroughout my life. There was never any getting away from it.",
        "A: No. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- 1t shaped my personality. I taught the Holocaust, I wrote papers, I\nwrote two books, I -- I gave lectures and I was able to found the Holocaust Human Rights\nCenter of Maine, which I\u2019m very gratified for. And I -- I was a member of the state Board\nof Education because -- in Maine, because of my experiences. What does education mean\nto you, that you didn\u2019t have it, you see? And it -- it -- 1t governed my life. It -- 1t governed\nmy children\u2019s lives too, but we can talk about that later.",
        "A: No, I had no qualms about leaving at all. I remember the train that took us from\nBaushawitz, which is from Theresienstadt, to Saint Gallen, went through Nuremberg and\nby -- by implication, 1t grazed Anspach and there was always this -- this happy moment\nin former years, when we were on the train, we could see the roof of our house, going\nthrough Anspach. And I remember that I didn\u2019t even want to look. Out -- out -- out, I\nwanted to go. Nothing kept me there, nothing at all. Yeah, that was something. I do want\nto say 1s something about leaving Berlin, actually. I -- no, I -- I can\u2019t recall now what I\nwanted to say. Ask me something.",
        "A: To leave Theresienstadt?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, I know what you\u2019re asking me. Oh no, that went like in a trance, everybody\nhelped. The Erelinger family, my father. Lothar sent part of the affidavit and -- and the\nSwiss helped, of course, coaxing me along. It was nothing compared to the difficulties\nthat are -- are branded in my brains that we had to go through trying to get out of\nGermany, you see? And that is something I can\u2019t forget either and my mother\u2019s letters,\nwhich I still have, are filled with that. She says, \u201cEvery day I look for the mail and I\nthink, there must be an affidavit for me now.\u201d And then she had to wait hours and hours\nat the Jewish communities in Munich to -- to get a number and she never got one and to\nget [indecipherable] finally she had the number, then she had to wait hours and hours at\nthe Hapak to get a -- a ship\u2019s passage and just terrible. Just terrible. But finally, she -- she\ngave up. She didn\u2019t give up, she was taken away. No, compared to that, getting out of\nSwitzerland was a breeze. And of course there were no airplanes at the time, so I went in\na -- in a boat. That was a very happy boat ride.",
        "A: Oh yes --",
        "A: -- I -- Ire -- it was the SS Mulholland and of course I was ready to fall in love with\nevery person I saw, especially Americans. And by then I was already very -- very much\nmy old self again. And I remember that one of the ship\u2019s officers showed me, for the first\ntime, a Life Magazine, with that glossy picture of some pretty woman on the -- on the\nfront, I don\u2019t recall who it was and I remember he\u2019s saying to me, \u201cYou could be on that\ncover yourself.\u201d So, apparently, at that time, I was already quite nice looking again. And\nof course, I was glowing with anticipation of going to America after we had struggled so\nterribly. America, it was like -- like -- like a rainbow in the sky. It\u2019s something that you\njust -- you see, but you can\u2019t touch, so I was actually going there and I remember asking\nhim lots and lots of questions. And then he showed me that magazine and tried to tell me\na little about America. It was nice.",
        "A: Oh, nothing. Nothing, nothing. I didn\u2019t talk about the -- the concentration camp for a\nlong time. I remember when my father took me to New York then and people came to\nvisit -- I remember so clearly, one old lady said to me, \u201cSo tell us already, a little bit\nabout the concentration camp.\u201d And I was simply horrified. I looked at my father and I\nsaid, \u201cPapa,\u201d ca -- you know, like get me out of this. So he tried to change the subject.\nOh, there was no way I could have opened my mouth about it at all. Not for a long, long\ntime. I had nightmares about it constantly, but I never could talk about it. And except for\nthat strange Jewish old lady, nobody really wanted to know. Nobody wanted to know. I\nremember when I spoke for the very first time at a group --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B.",
        "A: Iremember, when I finally got myself to speak about my experiences -- oh, it -- it\ncouldn\u2019t even have been my own, maybe it was just generalization about the Holocaust, I\n-- | remember -- and that was very much later, that was, I would say, in the 1960\u2019s or\neven -- yeah, in the 1960\u2019s, that was in Maine and I spoke to a B\u2019nai Brith group of\nwomen in somebody\u2019s home. And here -- and was very difficult for me to get up and\nspeak for the first time. And next to me or in front of me sat one of the women -- I knew\nall the women, they were from town and one of them pulled out her knitting and started\nto knit. And me being so nervous, I said to her, \u201cAre you going to knit through my whole\ntalk? Am I going to, you know, hear that clappering of the needles all through the talk?\u201d\nNumber one, it showed me that she really didn\u2019t care what I was going to say. And\nnumber two, it -- it -- it -- 1t did make me even more nervous. And I remember her\nanswering, \u201cIf it\u2019s interesting, I\u2019m going to stop.\u201d So you see the -- the people didn\u2019t\nreally care. This was a Jewish woman, a young Jewish woman. And I started to talk and I\nnoticed that she stopped and she didn\u2019t knit any more. And f-from then on it became a\nlittle bit easier for me to talk. And it be-became more the thing to do to ask me to talk.\nThen, after the B\u2019nai Brith, then every other local organization wanted me to talk, then\nthe churches came in, the schools. And it became easier and easier. But there was a\ndefinite bar. There was a definite high hurdle that I had to overcome and that the listeners\nhad to overcome. And once that hurdle was passed, then things were okay.",
        "A: I -- one of the most unforgettable moments in my life is when I saw the photographs\nfor the first time and it was in a moviehouse. You recall, in years gone by, the first thing\nthey always showed was the -- the -- the -- the newsreel. And I did see one of those\nAuschwitz photographs for the first time. And maybe that was the moment when I\nbelieved that my mother and sister were dead. And 1-it was horrible. And also for the first\ntime, I heard the phrase like -- like animals to the slaughter, from the rabbi in Lewiston,\nMaine at -- at one of his Rosh Hashanah sermons. And I was terribly shocked. That was\nlong before I was able to talk and long before people wanted to listen. But, you know, it\nstarted creeping along and there was no way of holding it back. It was like water lapping\nthe shore and then -- then the whole flood finally came.",
        "A: Oh, that must have been -- that must have been -- I was married and had one child, so\nth -- I would say that it was 1948 - \u201c49 - \u201850 maybe, at least -- at last. \u00b048 - \u201849, I would\nsay.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t even want to. I was very busy putting my life together. Having a -- a -- a\nfianc\u00e9 and -- and a husband and the baby and the house and being able to keep all those\nthings. Nobody was taking them away from me. It was quite something. My nightmares\nwere terrible, but my days were heaven. The nightmares, interestingly enough, never -- I\nnever dream about my mother or my sister. I think about them a lot, but I n -- I never\ndream about them. The nightmares are always that the Nazis are coming to take my\nchildren and the life I have now. Very strange. But they\u2019re letting off a little bit now. I\nstill have them. Now, I have nightmares about the grandchildren. My last nightmare was\nthe Nazis were coming and my little granddaughter said, \u201cOh, I want to run upstairs and\nget my party dress.\u201d Yeah... But that was at least a year ago, so I haven\u2019t had one for\nawhile. I always wake up in a cold sweat with a -- with fibrillations afterwards. One of\nthe more satisfying moments of my life was when I was able to give a deposition against\nAlois Brunner. I saw a little notice in one of the Jewish papers that people who knew the\nSS man Brunner should come forward and -- and give a deposition to -- at -- in Boston. I\nwas still living in Maine at the time. And I called that number and I said, \u201cI remember\nBrunner only too well and I\u2019m quite ready to give a deposition.\u201d Nothing became of it.\nThe Syrians didn\u2019t release him, even so he -- he -- he was quite guilty.",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "A: Yes, he -- he was -- he was one of the key figures in -- in Berlin when we were taken\nfrom the hospital to the -- to the Jewish community and were told that from now on, we\nwere the agents of our own destruction. We jolly well could pick up our own Jews, the\nSS didn\u2019t have to do that dirty work any more. And that we could -- that we could do\nduty in the -- on the trains ourselves, so the SS wouldn\u2019t have to do all that hard work of\nherding the people into the -- into the -- into the -- into the freight trains. That was\nBrunner. And then he stayed for awhile in Berlin and I remember it very well. I wrote it\nall down and you have that on record. But I don\u2019t know if I told then that I -- I had been\nable to give a def -- deposition, that was much later. I was very glad to do that, it was a\nlong, long deposition. The interesting thing is that the German counsel who -- who took\nthe deposition heard some of the things for the first time. So I was very happy about that.",
        "A: No, that was much later. That was much, much later. I wasn\u2019t very comfortable, but it\nseemed necessary to do that.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, I can. I can. My father had met me in Boston and after the holiday was\nover, we traveled by train to New York and then he took a taxi from the train station to --\nto his home up in Washington Heights and of course I kept looking out of the taxi\nwindow the whole time. It seemed difficult to see the tops of the buildings. I had never\nseen a skyscraper before and I was completely aghast at those. But what even impressed\nme more were the black people. At that time they were still called Negroes and what I\ncouldn\u2019t get over was the colors they wore. Green and purple and -- and red and blue.\nLoud, loud colors. I hadn\u2019t seen colors for a long, long time. Everything was drab for 12\nyears. Black and gray and -- and green, the Nazi uniforms and -- and that was about it.\nNobody wore colors. And here I saw these black people -- first of all, the black color\nalready, was striking. I hadn\u2019t seen a black person before. And then their hair was dark\nand I had only seen blonde. And then they had these -- these -- these rainbow colors on\nthem, dresses and shoes and fingernails. Everything was blazing. I was very taken aback\nby that. And then we got into the house -- my father took me in and of course the\napartments were so different, too. And the people were different, it was -- it was difficult\nat first, it was very difficult.",
        "A: Well, I was still halfway -- half-halfway 1-1n my former life and now I had all this --\nthis to cope with, thi -- 1t -- I think it was difficult and I was still waiting -- I still felt\nguilty and I was still waiting for my family. And it was a turmoil. It was a -- it -- it was --\nis a tumultuous time. Feelings were impinging on me that I -- and impressions that I -- I\ncouldn\u2019t -- that I couldn\u2019t digest right away so quickly and -- and -- and pigeonhole.",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall. I don\u2019t recall. I don\u2019t remember that. I think we didn\u2019t talk about the\npast at all. He was, of course, settled by then and he was very proud of himself to have\npulled up a little butcher store out of -- out of nothing in -- in New York, America and he\nwas making a living and h-he was extreme -- he showed me his door, and -- and I\nremember he gave a -- a religious object to his synagogue in gratitude that I was saved.\nAnd the rabbi welcomed me from the -- from the podium in one of -- in his speech when\nI first came to synagogue. That was unheard of, I was terribly embarrassed. And I -- I\ndon\u2019t recall much about that... The name of the man who wrote the book, \u201cStella\u201d is\nPeter Wyden, Peter W-y-d-e-n. Simon and Schuster, 1992. And my documentation is in\nSumlongin, Dr. Hans Clay manuscript, CDJCXX70, Santre de document mon taisson\njuivre contemporare Pari. Anonymous parishta Annabelina Crankensfesta. And they were\npicked up by Gerhard Shernbrenner and were included in his -- in his book, \u201cVere haben\nesska sayen.\u201d And that\u2019s where this Wyden picked it up. If that\u2019s important or not, I don\u2019t\nknow. But still in -- okay.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes, I surely can. He took me to 719 179th Street. The building is now razed,\nbecause it made room for -- actually for -- for the bus terminal, that big bus terminal on\n179th Street. And it was a very strange -- 1-in Washington Heights, that\u2019s in New York,\nbut in the Washington Heights section. And it was a very strange building for me. I had\nonly known buildings where you walk in and you\u2019re in the living room and dining room\nand the kitchen and out the door into the garden and upstairs were the bedrooms. Well,\nthis was an apartment building where a whole city lived. You walked in and you had to\ntake the elevator up to the sixth floor and then you were confronted by long, dark, usually\nsmelly corridors and from the corridor, on each side, doors entered. And little did I know\nthat every single door was a whole apartment in itself. I\u2019d never seen a construction at --\nlike that. In fact I -- I tried to explain it to one of my friends 1n letters and they couldn\u2019t\npicture it at all, either. So anyway, we went through a door, number 6B, I think. And\nthere, al-all of a sudden, it opened up into a re-regular apartment. But you just couldn\u2019t\ntell that from that dark corridor. So here we were and of course the Mezuzah was on the\ndoor and everything was right away. Then when I came in, all the people hugged me and\n[indecipherable] me. There was -- my father was living with an old cousin, whose\nhusband had just died and his brother. His brother and he, I think she had one bedroom\nand the cousin and her husband had shared the second bedroom and fortunately the\nhusband just died so that I could have the other bed. Otherwise, I don\u2019t where I would\nhave slept. But how God arranges things for me is just miraculous, really. So I re -- I\nremember -- of course that -- the ca -- the husband of that cousin absolutely meant\nnothing to me. I never met the guy, he was ages old, deaf and blind and ready to die. I\nhad never even heard his name. But he died when I was still in Switzerland and my father\n-- who by that time corresponded with me regularly -- didn\u2019t tell me about his death and\nonly told me on the train from Boston to New York that the cousin had died. And he said\nhe didn\u2019t want to tell me that because I had been surrounded by so much death and dying\nthat he didn\u2019t want to upset me any more. I think that gives you an idea of -- of how they\nregarded us. We were like -- like fragile, ethereal things that you mustn\u2019t upset and -- and\ndon\u2019t tell them anything bad, they\u2019ve gone through bad enough. And that was very weird.\n[ -- | -- I still -- still remember that, he was afraid to tell me that this anonymous cousin of\nmine had died. Anyway, I had a good time sleeping in his bed.",
        "A: Not right away. On that Shabbat -- you see, that was a very -- very religious\ncommunity. Perhaps I better say a little bit about the community, so you understand what\nit was like. In a way, it was almost like coming back to Germany. First of all, nobody\nspoke English, they were all -- also, they\u2019d all tried very hard to learn the language and\nthey eventually did and they all aspired to be citizens and of course they all were. But\namong themselves, they lived still way back in their little German villages. The gossip\nwas tremendous. Everything was word of mouth. They all went to synagogue, of course,\nin their best clothes and at synagogue, if -- if you didn\u2019t say \u201cGood Shabbas\u201d\u2019 to\nsomebody, he was insulted with you for the whole week. And it was such a narrow\nminded, such a petty little community, that I, who had gone through so much, just -- I -- I\nwas aghast. And everybody watched everybody else, that they did everything right and\nwhether they had a new hat on for Rosh Hashanah. And one person said she\u2019s not going\nto synagogue because she couldn\u2019t afford to buy a new hat. So I say, \u201cGo in the old hat.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you can\u2019t do that, the people will talk about you.\u201d It was such a narrow minded,\nsuch a pi-pitiful community. They had -- you see, they had all emigrated before Hitler\nreally did his job and so they knew nothing of the hardship we would go through. And so\nthey transferred all their pettiness and all their parochialism and all their pedestrianism to\nthis beautiful city and they just lived within that gorgeous city, still in their old, little\nhometown of -- of maybe 2,000 people. Was weird. I had a hard time fitting in. And\neverybody gossiped about everybody else and was not for me. I was glad my husband\ntook me out of there.",
        "A: Oh, who cares whether you had a new hat? And who cares if you wore a nice diamond\npin or not? But if they couldn\u2019t catch up -- and -- and my -- my stepmother was -- fell\nright into that. Although she too had lost people, she too was in Theresienstadt, she\nworked in the glimmer factory, her hands off and -- and she had gone through just as\nmuch as I did. But as soon as she married my father, she -- she joined that -- that\nstampede of -- of -- of the Washington Heights Jewish women. You had to have exactly\nthe right kind of jewelry and a new dress and a fur coat and -- and she was one of the\nworst, honestly. I just could -- I think that\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t get used to -- to her. My\nmother had been so plain, the only thing she ever possessed was her -- her engagement\nring, which I fortunately still have. But my -- my stepmother just wasn\u2019t like that at all.\nThe first time I met her, she -- she -- that -- that was then again, much later, after I was\nmarried, she came to visit me in Lewiston with my father, in a fur coat and a fancy outfit,\nand I ju -- I just couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t get used to that. So, anyway, Washington Heights\nwas a community of it\u2019s own. My father only had Jewish customers. Only the Jewish\nreligious people from the surrounding s -- s -- few streets came to see him. And once in\nawhile a -- an inspector would show up to inspect the cleanliness and -- and the exits and\nentrances and the fire escape. And my father always was afraid of them, because they\nspoke English and they were the strangers, they were them, you see? So that ghetto\nmentality was still there.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. He never really -- he never really became Americanized. He\u2019s -- he still\nremained it -- remained just the way he was. And I think that was the -- a source of\nfriction between us too, because I wanted to be American. I sa -- I didn\u2019t want to be any\nmore like I was in Anspach. I wanted to be an American woman. I remember when I\nfinally went to college, and then became a librarian and took a job, his comment was,\n\u201cWhy do you need to work? Your husband will support you.\u201d See, that was the mentality.\nHe never understood it.",
        "A: Well, I -- I didn\u2019t like the -- the Washington Heights mentality and -- and environment\nat all. I -- I -- just wasn\u2019t comfortable. I knew I was being talked about and criticized\nand -- and -- and I just couldn\u2019t relate to these bosoms -- fat woman in their finery and\ndoing really not very much. They just transplanted themselves. So when I came to Maine,\nmy husband -- my husband also felt that way about New York and he wanted to be in a\nsmall town where he could make an impact and really -- and really be an American\nphysician. Then when we moved to Maine, actually I ha -- I had a new struggle then.\nThen I was expected to be an American -- a young American wife and I didn\u2019t know\nhow. And then I -- I didn\u2019t know how to play Bridge, that was the furthest from my mind,\nso I was already ostracized because I couldn\u2019t ever be invited to Bridge games. What\nwere they going to do with me? I couldn\u2019t play. So, you know, that was already a\nhandicap. And my English of course, wasn\u2019t so great at the time. I remember -- I don\u2019t\nknow if this will sit well on tape or not, but I have a memory of trying to play Bridge and\ntrying to fit in and finally -- and then you had to always say what you put down, what\ncard, the King or the Queen. And finally one of the other three American ladies said to\nme, \u201cGerda, please stop referring to that card as the ass. Call it the Ace.\u201d So that\u2019s how --\nthat\u2019s how ha -- ha -- I struggled. And I quit after awhile. I just couldn\u2019t learn that stupid\ngame. Also, it wasn\u2019t important to me. And then soon I was pregnant and I had a child\nand th-that of course, was crucial. And I felt very much that I was saved because I should\ndo something ex -- ec -- other than playing Bridge and learning to say the cards correctly.\nAnd so I -- I devoted myself to my kids. So much so that actually I -- I -- I became\ndepressed after awhile. I -- I did nothing but worry about this firstborn of mine, because\nhe was actually the first thing that I could call mine and I -- I knew, excepting my\nnightmares, I knew that he couldn\u2019t be taken away from me. Nobody could come in and -\n- and take him, he was mine. And so I -- I -- I was between the reality and the nightmares,\nI -- I became very depressed and actually I did see a psychiatrist, upon the urging of my\nhusband. And then one of the woman also -- that was also a -- a big factor in my\ndepression -- one of the women, actually the local rabbi\u2019s wife, who was about the age of\nmy mother then and I being without a mother or mother-in-law or anybody and being that\npoor, displaced person there, she befriended me and she acted as my -- as my dominant\nguardian. And somehow, without my really understanding it, I -- I just couldn\u2019t get along\nwith her. I just feared her and I -- I -- I never knew how to -- how to talk with her and --\nand she -- she was very possessive of me and I was terribly -- actually afraid of her. And\nafter that went on for maybe a couple of years or so, I -- my husband, who -- who n --\nwho noticed that I wasn\u2019t reacting right --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: -- put me down sometime -- someday and -- and talk to me and try to find out why I\nwas having such a hard time. And he pointed out to me -- as so often an outsider can tell\nyou much better what\u2019s wrong with you -- he pointed out to me that she was moving into\nmy mother\u2019s place and I, having that guilt complex a ma -- about my mother, I just\ncouldn\u2019t relate to her. Ij -- I just couldn\u2019t deal with it. I was so afraid of her, although I\ndidn\u2019t know why and she of course, didn\u2019t know why either. And that\u2019s when he sent me\nto a psychiatrist. And then, after a few sessions, when he pointed out to me that it was --\nall this was perfectly normal and how I could deal with it, then I was okay.",
        "A: Well, I was always afraid of this person who called me up and demanded that I call\nher back and I had to tell her everything that was going on in my life. For instance, she\nwas So possessive of me that when I told her that I was three months pregnant with my\nfirst child, and I told her as the first person because, you know, naturally I felt some kind\nof -- of a debt to her for being so nice to me and teaching me English and teaching me\nhow to cook. What did I know about cooking? And teach -- and taking me to her friends\nand everything. So I felt a certain debt to her, so she was the first one I told that I was\npregnant. Very joyously and I thought, \u201cOh now she\u2019Il be just so sweet to me.\u201d And she\nsaid, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me this sooner?\u201d And you know, again, I sh-shrank back and\nthis old fear of her came back to me. And you know, I was just always not just right with\nher. They invited us all the time and I always feared to go and my husband noticed that\nsomething was wrong with me -- with me and that relationship with her. So finally we\nstraightened it -- he straightened it out.",
        "A: That was okay. I wanted to get over it myself. I didn\u2019t know what was ailing me. She\nwas a somewhat dem-demanding and domineering -- a childless woman and she kind of\nsucked onto me and -- and wanted me to be completely hers and I didn\u2019t want to. I didn\u2019t\nwant to be dominated again.",
        "A: Oh, you know, that\u2019s 50 years ago. Let me see if I can reconstruct that. First of all, at\nthat point, 1t was not so accepted to go to the psychiatrist, so we -- we went to a\npsychiatrist in the next town, Portland and I think my husband drove me down each time.\nI think so. And he a-asked about the -- the past and the Holocaust, something about the\nHolocaust and my life. And he also noticed that I had a guilt complex. And then he told\nme that I was perfectly normal and that people who go through very great traumatic\nexperiences and come out alive, whereas other people die, as for instance in the plane\ncrash or any natural disaster, do end up with a guilt complex and he thought that was\nquite normal. And once I knew that, I could deal with it. I didn\u2019t go many times. He was\nvery good and very kind and -- and I could deal with it. Interesting enough, though, I -- I\ngot over it and I adjusted okay, but three of my four children ended up going to a\npsychiatrist or a psychologist in -- in their formative years. Apparently I did pass that on\nto them. And I think they talked a lot about me and -- and my past and my relationship to\nthem. They\u2019re all very close to me now, but there was a time when they just -- they just --\ndidn\u2019t know just how to act. I know for instance that -- w-we never talked about the\nHolocaust and we never talked German, but once the children knew that I had been in a\nconcentration camp and -- and I\u2019I1 tell you in a minute how they found that out, then I\nbegan to realize that they were reading under their covers at night with flashlights, books\nabout the Holocaust, but they didn\u2019t dare to ask me, so they visualized that I went\nthrough the worst of what they were reading and I think that was the cause of their -- of\ntheir m-maladjustment. And how did they find out? Because after I went to college, at\nage 49 and then to grad school and became a librarian -- that was in \u201874, early -- maybe\neven before then -- then I became a book reviewer for the Library Journal and for some\nof the Jewish magazines. And once they realized that I could deal with Holocaust books\non an authentic and authoritative basis, they deluged me with Holocaust material. And\nthen my kids, of course, caught on and asked and -- and then we were okay. Was the --\ncan you talk a little bit about your decision not to talk -- not to tell your children about it?\nWas it a conscious decision or perhaps a decision where you [indecipherable]",
        "A: I don\u2019t believe that 1t was a conscious decision. I never much talked to my husband\nabout it, either. H-He -- in the beginning, he went with me and heard me lecture, so he\nknew all about it, but I -- it didn\u2019t seem something I wanted to talk with him about. I\nwonder why? It was okay to talk to the psychiatrist about it and it was okay to -- to talk to\na -- to a faceless audience. But it was not okay to talk to my father or my husband or my\nkids about it. Or even my closer girlfriends. I -- I did find some -- some of my colleagues\nfrom Berlin Hospital here again. One of the friends I was especially close to, I found her\nagain and then my head nurse, I found quite by chance in a little for -- Godforsaken town\nin Maine and that seemed okay. All we ever talk about was the Holocaust and Berlin and\nwhat happened and other friends and od -- it just -- 1t just didn\u2019t seem to come out with\nmy family. I don\u2019t know why not.",
        "A: Oh, that --",
        "A: There was nothing to talk about. We had gone through the same thing, we were like\nsisters. Fortunately sh-she had -- she -- she has by now forgotten everything. She\u2019s\nmaybe getting a little bit senile, but what -- 1f we ever say anything, she doesn\u2019t\nremember it. She doesn\u2019t remember any of the things that are so vivid in my mind. Like\nwhen we washed our hair under that pump that we had to pump. We had to help each\nother, cause one had to pump and the other one had to wash her hair. I never forgot it.\nShe doesn\u2019t remember a thing about it. So, it -- I -- I have no explanation why I didn\u2019t\ntalk to my family. There was so much else to talk about. I had to learn English, I had to\nlearn to be a wife. I had to be a mother. There was so much to do. I had books to read. I\nhadn\u2019t read a book in 12 years. Jews weren\u2019t supposed to read. I hadn\u2019t listened to music,\nall of this I had to do now. So, my husband was a big, big help to me. He was just an\nangel. And I had to get to know him. I married him while being practically engaged to the\nother guy and I didn\u2019t even know him. We only knew each other for three months, but we\ntruly fell in love and I knew that was the man I wanted to spend my life with. We were\njust really so made for each other. Our background was the same a-and w-we just entered\na very happy marriage and we still have a very happy, functional marriage. And it just\ndidn\u2019t seem necessary to talk about the past. I somehow assumed he knew it all. You\nknow how you -- when you\u2019re -- when you\u2019re very close to someone? He knows. You\nknow? And he probably does know. I\u2019ve -- we never talk about it. It\u2019s not important, a-at\nleast in that context. I don\u2019t know if that makes any sense or not.",
        "A: It did, yes.",
        "A: I have to think a minute -- a minute, how to answer you that, because I had never\nreally thought about it. Well, I was -- I was a walking survivor. It was probably written\nall over me. I had such different values from other people. You know, I couldn\u2019t throw\nout any food. I -- I would go to people\u2019s homes to eat and whatever was on the table and\ndidn\u2019t get eaten, was thrown in the waste. I couldn\u2019t do that. A-And -- and this business\nwith having new clothes all the time. Who cares? I had a dress, that was great. And\nmaybe some of those things, surely it must have transmitted its-itself to the kids.",
        "A: Yes, I will, but first I want to say this, my -- my children, in a way, by osmosis almost,\nsurmised what was going on and yet, they didn\u2019t really understand. I -- I\u2019m sure I spoke\nabout this when I was interviewed the first time, but 1t seems important enough now\nmaybe just to touch on it once more without going into too much detail. When I was --\nwhen I was asked to be a member of the state Board of Education in Maine, I accepted,\nof course, greedily and then I -- a phone call came -- or rather a notice came that my\nconfirmation hearing was on -- on a certain date in September and I looked at my\ncalendar, it was the second day of Rosh Hashanah and I didn\u2019t travel then. So, I talked to\nmy husband and he said, \u201cWell, you have to call up and tell them you can\u2019t come and\nprobably they\u2019ll pick someone else.\u201d So I called up and it was the Senator Katz who was\non the phone, who was the chairman and of course, obviously he was also Jewish and he\nwas such a nice guy, I became very close friends with him later. And I said to him, \u201cI\u2019m\nsorry, I don\u2019t travel on the second day of Rosh Hashanah. I can\u2019t come.\u201d And he was\nquiet for a minute and then he said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m Jewish too, I never even knew there\nwas a second day of Rosh Hashanah.\u201d And so we talked about that for awhile and then he\nsaid, \u201cWell, then we\u2019ll postpone the hearing for a week -- for a --\u201d I don\u2019t know how\nlong. And I was just flabbergasted that this senator from Maine ju -- postponed a hearing\nfor me, who was persecuted for being Jewish. And I talked about that werbar in front of\nthe kids. And my daughter Heddy, the one who\u2019s living here now, said -- still ringing in\nmy ears and she said to me -- she was then about, oh, maybe 14 or 15. She said, \u201cWhy --\nwhy do you think that\u2019s so -- so -- so noteworthy? Naturally, if you can\u2019t come because\nof religious reasons, they have to postpone the date for you.\u201d You know, and I -- then I\nwas even more flabbergasted, that my own kid didn\u2019t understand what -- what it means to\n-- not to live in a democracy. I -- I -- I don\u2019t know if you understand the bigness of that\nthing. It was such a revelation to me, such an epiphany. And -- and then -- then I\nprobably explained to her at that point that not everybody grows up in a democracy and\nhas democracy in their bloods -- in their bloodstreams, with their mother\u2019s milk. Well, in\nthat case, it wasn\u2019t the case but -- but obviously she was American enough not to\nunderstand that this -- a senate does not have to postpone a hearing for a Jewish woman.\nSo then I wrote my book. And the book just came out of me, because I thought, \u201cIf my\nown kids don\u2019t know it, other kids don\u2019t know it either.\u201d And I -- I wrote my book then. I\n-- it was the first one, it\u2019s in the preface. The whole preface, that\u2019s why I wrote the book,\nfor my kids and for other kids, who grow up blithely and -- a-and then, of course, as I\nwas writing and researching and talking about it and speaking, then the kids know\neverything. The kids also didn\u2019t want to know all that much. The grandchildren want to\nknow more then the kids now. But the grandchildren already don\u2019t understand it any\nmore. They don\u2019t understand it any -- \u201cWhat did Hitler look like? Did he come and kill\nyour mother hi-himself?\u201d You know, things like that. \u201cWhat are you going to say to him\nwhen you meet him in heaven?\u201d There, at least I had an answer. I\u2019m not going to meet\nhim in heaven. I ain\u2019t going there, where he is. So, anyway. Yes, now I want to tell you\nabout my oldest son. Somehow I -- I always felt -- or at least I rationalized -- for lack of\nany other rationalization, that I was saved so that I could have children and -- and\nsomehow continue the -- the -- the re -- the depleted Jewish people. So, I quickly had my\nfour kids and -- and I\u2019m sure that feeling translated itself in -- imbued itself into my kids.\nThey too should have kids and grandkids and the Jewish race should -- should keep going\nin spite of Hitler. Hitler did not win. He did not eradicate us all. We, the survivors are\nstarting again. And after my son was married for many years and didn\u2019t have children, he\nconfessed to me once that this is a -- a very big problem for him because he fee -- he feels\nhe has let me down, that he has not continue -- that I was saved and he -- he is not\ncontinuing this. And of course, I was flabbergasted to hear that and I assured him that he\nhas not let -- now, mind you, he\u2019s a psychologist himself, he doesn\u2019t have to go to a\npsychologist, he is one. So he and I talked at length and he understood then that -- that he\ndid not let me down and I never felt let down by him. On the contrary, I -- I\u2019m just\nextremely proud of all my kids and especially of him. And then, shortly after that he -- he\nadopted a little girl and she\u2019s now five and she\u2019s -- 10 months ago he adopted a little boy\nand now he feels whole. He has two children, that name will continue, the children have\nboth come here to our synagogue to be -- to go to the Mikvah to become Jewish and of\ncourse the boy had his circumcision here and I ha -- my son, honestly, he\u2019s a different\nperson since then. His head is up high and his chest is out and -- and he and I are -- are\nvery close again. So --",
        "A: Oh yes, of course I can, my whole pride and joy. With the children, I felt I had paid\nmy dues, at least to God and to the Jewish community. And then the other dues I paid, I\nwant to tell you after I tell you the children\u2019s name. So I\u2019m looking at this picture here,\nwhich was taken at the brit of my oldest son\u2019s little boy. And it\u2019s in front of the Kineset\nIsel synagogue, with the name clearly visible. So there\u2019s my husband and I and in the\ncenter iv my -- 1s my son Leonard. Now mind you, all my kids are named after the\nparents we lost. So Leonard -- which is a burden, actually. The kids say it is a burden.\nLeonard is named after my husband\u2019s father, Leonard. And next to him is my daughter\nHeddy, who is named after my husband\u2019s mother, Hedwick. And on his other side is my\nson David, who is named after a distant grandfather and here is my daughter Pauli, who\nis named after my mother, Paula. And then, these are their -- their mates and then in front\nyou have the next generation and of course their names are picked out of a hat and in fact,\nit is very interesting. You know, Hitler had -- one of the many laws that he made against\nthe Jews was that the Jews had to have what he thought was degrading names like Sarah\nand Jacob and Moses and Daniel. Those were names that only Jews should have. And the\ninteresting fact is that all my grandchildren have Jewish and Hebrew names, not because\nHitler decreed it, because those names are beautiful and they like them. The only one that\ndoesn\u2019t have a Jewish name, actually, is the two adopted kids. But it\u2019s no problem. So\nthere\u2019s Rachel and there is Tally and Ari. And not on the picture are Sarah and Jonathan\nand Benjamin and Raphael. And the two kids of my old -- of my youngest son\u2019s, which\nweren\u2019t born then -- oh yes they were -- is Jacob and Evan. Isn\u2019t that a great -- nice\npicture of my family and -- and I\u2019m very proud of them. So I have fulfilled my duty there\nand then -- and then I want to just mention a little bit that I have also fulfilled my duty to\n-- to this country, because after all, I owe it quite a debt. Quite a debt. And in that way\nI\u2019m very glad that I moved to small town, but that was very se -- very secondary, only\nafter I lived there for many years in -- in Lewiston, Maine, population maybe 60 -- maybe\n50,000. Only after I lived there for a long time, did I realize that the population, the\ngeneral American population knows very little about Judaism and almost nothing about\nthe Holocaust. And so I -- I really found a fulfilling role for myself. By that time I was a -\n- a librarian at Bates College in Lewiston and when we first moved there, in 1947, Bates\nCollege had only one Jewish professor and did not acknowledge the needs of the Jewish\nstudents. Holidays, no time off. Kosher food never was heard of. Jewish subjects were\nnever taught and so the Jewish population and also th-the non-Jewish population knew\nnothing. And I was able to change that. I -- I got myself some grants from the -- of course\nthen the times were different, too. This was in the 1970\u2019s, 1980\u2019s, I got myself some\nsizable grants from the Maine Human -- Council of the Humanities and with the blessing\nand -- and the encouragement of the Bates College president, I -- I conducted several\nJewish oriented conferences. And they really went over big. This was for the whole state\nof Maine, we had a tremendous budgets, we -- the first conference I did was a month\nlong. Just informational conference on Judaism and we moved from city to city, with\npeople and -- and videos and we talked and we an -- mostly we answered questions and\nmany people in the hinterlands of Maine confessed that they had never seen a Jew before.\nSo I -- I really felt proud about that. And then the next thing we did -- I was able to get a\nJewish library -- a Rabbinic library for Bates College. The -- the -- the husband of the --\nof the woman that had oppressed me so, the rabbi of -- of Lewiston died and -- and by\nthen of course I was on -- on even terms with her and I was able to -- to coax her into\ndonating his whole Rabbinic library in toto to Bates College. And it\u2019s known now as the\nRabbi David Berund Rabbinic Library of Bates College. And I\u2019m proud to say that I did\nit. And I catalogued it -- took me several years. And it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s a nice -- nice\nlegacy. And then we did s -- then again I got f-funding for several Jewish events --\nJewish music. And that was all within that library, I got money for that and I was able to\ndo a David Berund event annually. And once I did a music -- Jewish music and the other\ntime we did Jewish films and next time we did Yiddish. And I got good speakers and we\nalways had standing room only. It was fabulous, it was like they needed to hear about\nJudaism. Not only the Jews, but the non-Jews as well. The students, the professors, the\ntownspeople, the out of townspeople. Was fabulous. And out of that -- when I realized\nthe need, out of that, I -- then we did Holocaust conferences, especially with teachers.\nAnd again I felt this - this void. This -- this -- this -- this magnetic need that I had and\nthen we finally got together and we had a little bit of money left from the last conference\n-- oh, I don\u2019t know, maybe a thousand dollars and of course we were obliged to return it\nto the -- to the main Humanities Council, but we asked and got permission to keep it as\nseed money to found the Holocaust Human Rights Center of Maine. And we were just\nsailing through that. It was like they just waited for us. The Maine State Library\nsponsored us, we had our meetings there, they did all our cataloguing, all our mailing, all\nour newsletter, our videota -- I did a complete video and oral history tape of all the\nsurvivors in my -- Maine is such a small state, all we had was 25 survivors and maybe\nless than a dozen t -- much less than a dozen liberators. And we -- we -- we interviewed\nthem all. We also interviewed non-Jewish people. Our criterion for survivor simply was\nanyone whose life has been dramatically changed because of Hitler. And that included a\nlot of non-Jewish, too. We had a lay -- a layer of -- a s -- of a small town in Poland who\nwouldn\u2019t go along with him and had to leave, with his whole family. And we had a\nformer Nazi woman who then completely turned around and married a Jewish soldier and\ncame over to Maine and became completely de-Nazified and -- and talked about -- and\nshe wrote a book called, \u201cPoison in my Roots.\u201d She talked about h-h-how she couldn\u2019t\nhelp being a Nazi, there was nothing else. If she wasn\u2019t a Nazi, she was going to be shot,\nas simple as that. And she explained that to us. So I -- I really am feeling so -- so pleased.\nWe got funding from people we -- we didn\u2019t even approach. People came to us with --\nwith thousands of dollars. It was just fabulous. Today we are a functioning, vibrant, rich,\nbusy center.",
        "A: I\u2019m in very close contact with them. Just a cu -- just a day or so ago, I had on my e-\nmail on my computer, a message from -- from our secretary, whom I still picked -- she\nwas hand picked by me when I was still the -- the president and she stayed with us all\nthese years. This was like 15 years ago. And she said one of the synagogues in a small\ntown in Maine was desecrated on Yom Kip -- on Rosh Hashanah and she wanted me to --\nto say something that they can put into their newsletter and of course I wrote -- I\u2019m still\nvery much a part of it.",
        "A: I -- [just want to continue on some of the things we did in Maine. After we founded\nthe Holocaust center, we had an annual reception for survivors and liberators at the\nBlaine House, the State House in Augusta, Maine, with the governor presiding and\nsomebody giving a speech and the Mrs. governor passing around the famous cookies and\nthings like that. And it was always something I -- I personally felt somewhat responsible\nfor, so I always walked around and greeted everybody and made sure they felt welcomed\nand made su -- and I -- I knew most of them, anyway. And they knew me, too and -- and\none year, I saw a man standing aside and I didn\u2019t know him and I couldn\u2019t place him, he\ndidn\u2019t look old enough to be a survivor. He looked at least 10 years younger than I. And\nhe certainly didn\u2019t look like a liberator. The liberators by then, all had a certain look.\nThey were a little bit on the heavy side, gray hair -- you know, salt of the earth kind of\npeople. And he didn\u2019t look like that, he looked quite elegant and quite aloof and I\nthought, \u201cWho is he?\u201d So I said, \u201cWell, no -- no time is lost in finding out.\u201d And I\nmarched right up to him, after all, I acted a little bit like the -- like the hostess in that\u2019s --\nin that context and I said, \u201cI\u2019m Gerda Haas. Welcome to our reception. May I ask who\nyou are? Are you one of our survivors or one of our liberators?\u201d And he -- he clicked his\nheels you know and gave me a salute. He was in civilian clothes, of course, just with a\nmilitary insignia on his lapel. And he said, \u201cI am Colonel Retired Manfred Kelman, US\nRegiment --\u201d and I think he named it, which I have forgotten by then. And I was taken\naback and I said, \u201cSo you are one of our liberators?\u201d He said, \u201cNo. I am a survivor. I was\nin Theresienstadt.\u201d And I was completely baffled. He didn\u2019t look old enough and he\ndidn\u2019t look Jewish and he didn\u2019t look like a survivor. Neither did he act like one. So he\nand I huddled a little bit, because I couldn\u2019t spend too much time, but we made a date and\nwe met later for coffee. And the fellow tells me he was a Mishling. He was brought up by\na Jewish father and an -- and an Aryan SS mother. And he was 14 years old when the\nNazis finally yanked him out of his house. Up to now his mother could keep him and\nkept her eye on him and he was a little bit protected. Also, as he told me later, he had a\nmiserable childhood. He was neither Jewish nor Aryan. So anyway, by the age of 14, he\nwas sent to Theresienstadt and there he was again miserable, because he wasn\u2019t a Jew and\nhe had to wear the star all of a sudden and he had no friends. There was nobody 14 years\nold in Theresienstadt. And so finally at the -- at the end of the war, his mother sent an --\nan -- a still functioning army car to pick him up out of Theresienstadt. But by gosh, the\nguy was in Theresienstadt just like me, a prisoner of the Nazis, with his star on his left\nhand side. And of course we became close friends. I just couldn\u2019t get over it. And as soon\nas he -- that finished it for him. As soon as he could, he took -- his father died in\nconcentration camp and he took his mother out and came to America. And of course he\nwas a youngster, so he got his education, enrolled into the army, rose to the level of\nColonel, went back to fight the Nazis and retired to Maine because it was a nice state to\nretire in. How do you like that story? That\u2019s -- I should -- I should write that as a novel --\nas a short story. I\u2019ve told it many times and it\u2019s just flabbergasting. So that\u2019s again the\nenvelope of -- of -- of the Holocaust, of my life. And he was the nicest, nicest fellow.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: Very.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "A: Well, I -- I think -- I think I was a little bit on the outside, actually. I -- I think I have\nto say I was a little bit on the outside, by choice and by the rejection of my peers. And --\nand I think I made my own little world. I mean, to begin with that I went back to college\nat the age of 49. The people thought I was nuts. Here I was, married to a successful\nphysician, why should I go to college like a little girl? And sure enough, I was the age of\nmy professors. And that was kind of funny at times. But I went to college and then when\nI was done, I went to work. And in -- in 1971 that was not so common in a small town for\na -- for the wife of a professional to do. So again, out of choice, I didn\u2019t have time for\nthem and they rejected me because I went a different path. So, I had some close friends,\nbut looking back, they were all Europeans. No, I won\u2019t say that, I have a couple that were\nAmericans. But, pre-predominantly, my friends in -- in Maine were Europeans. And then\nI got so embroiled in the -- in all the activities that I have just described to you and then I\ngot completely snowed under with the Holocaust center. And they -- they didn\u2019t take part\nin that at all. They did come through when I did Jewish music and Jewish this and Jewish\nthat. That, they supported me in, but with the Holocaust they didn\u2019t support me all that\nmuch. And so I was on my own and I -- I was happy. I -- I was satisfied. I was different.\nThat\u2019s very funny, I -- I am thinking of -- I -- I had a girlfriend who was also European\nand we chatted a little bit and our children were in the next room playing. They were\nsmall, maybe eight. And I hear one of them say, \u201cMy mother doesn\u2019t have an accent,\nyour mother does.\u201d And I hear my daughter reply, \u201cNo, my mother doesn\u2019t have an\naccent, your mother has an accent.\u201d So I was different and yet I wasn\u2019t, you know? So, to\nanswer your question, you know, it hurt at times when I wasn\u2019t invited or -- or I knew\nthey were talking about me, or -- but you see, also I was very happily married. I -- I really\n-- you know, what did I need? I had my kids, I had my husband, I still had my father at\nthe time. And also, I did not get along with him as well as I should have. And I had my\nstepmother. I had them and they were -- and they were a responsibility as they became\nolder, you see? So I -- I -- I was okay. I have no qualms. And then I became interested in\nother things and I wanted to build a nice life and -- and I -- I think I Americanized\nmyself. I had a career, I was a book reviewer. I was always doing something.",
        "A: Yes. In -- in school.",
        "A: Well, I --",
        "A: Well I -- I think for a long time it stayed with me. See, I was 10 years old when I was\ndeclared a subhuman, an outsider. A Jew. I was supposed to be -- I was supposed to be\nugly, with a big nose and s -- big ears and stupid and the pu -- the real sturmer picture,\nyou know, of -- of kids that were Jewish. And I was supposed to be on the outside of -- of\nthe Aryan world, which was blonde and straight and beautiful and dancing about. And I -\n- | think when you te-tell that to a kid of 10 for 12 years, I think it will leave an impact.\nAnd I think partly that\u2019s why I had a hard time for a long time. I had to prove to myself\nthat I -- that I was intelligent, that I could do something, that I was beautiful and that I\nwas a good mother and a good wife. I think it took awhile. I -- I really do. I really do.\nAnd I think that\u2019s where all the nightmares came from, also. Subconsciously I was still\nthe fugitive, the haunted one. And I couldn\u2019t shake it, for the longest time. And my\nhusband helped me a great deal in that, too. He was very understanding about that. Yes,\nbut it took awhile. In school we were not allowed to -- to answer, because we were not\nallowed to know. You know, don\u2019t rock the boat of their -- of their perception of a Jewish\nstudent. We were sitting in the back and we were not allowed to answer. And we to -- we\ngot passing grades, but nothing special. And -- and then, of course, I -- I picked a -- a\nhands on profession, I became a nurse. But that was also because of necessity. No college\nwould take us. Completely out of the question, because all the colleges were states\ncolleges.",
        "A: Fleetingly. I was married to a doctor and I would have to be in the same hospital and I\ndidn\u2019t want that. And there was so much else to do. I -- I didn\u2019t want to be a nurse, I\nwanted to -- I wanted to be a student and I -- I was.",
        "A: Yes, well number one, he wu -- he understood me better than I understood myself. He\nwas completely able to pinpoint my problems with -- with the wife of the rabbi and he\nwas able to lift that from me. And he understood my obsession with my children very\nwell. He was very tolerant about that. And -- and he never probed, he never questioned,\nhe never -- he was never angry, which I -- I don\u2019t think I could have taken. And h-he was\njust -- I never quite thought about how he helped me, but as I\u2019m thinking -- and he was\nthe one that urged me to go to college. And when I was done with college, and I\ngraduated fabulously, coo -- summa cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa, all the honors you can\nhave. So I said -- it was very funny too, for a graduation present, he gave me a new\nelectric stove. Stay here, cook for me. But when he realized that I wasn\u2019t very happy\ndoing that, he urged me to go to grad school. He said, \u201cLook into librarianship, that looks\nlike a challenging profession.\u201d And he was always the one who -- who advised me right.\nI na -- just -- he still understands me very well. He still -- he still understands everything I\ndo and -- and he -- he himself 1s still very religious, but I -- my religion has shifted from\npoint A to point B and he understands that. He -- he -- he knows completely where --\nwhere I\u2019m coming fr -- to use that worn phrase -- where I\u2019m coming from and where I\u2019m\ngoing to. That\u2019s not what I want to say. H-He really -- he really understands my -- my --\nmy background. He himself is of course a refugee also, but he didn\u2019t go through\nconcentration camps. And -- and so he -- he doesn\u2019t consider himself a survivor, although\nI say he is. Does that answer your question?",
        "A: Good. Let\u2019s see if I have anything else on my thing here. It was funny when I meet all\nthese people again. Did I -- did I emphasize once more why we are the last of the\nsurvivors?",
        "A: Yeah, Id like to -- to really press hard on that point.",
        "A: I-It\u2019s so little known that one of the tenets of Nazi ideology was of course that we\nshouldn\u2019t live. We -- we should all be killed. And that -- that is one of the laws of the --\nof the Nazi party, the Jews have to be killed. But then practicality took over and they\nfigured as long as we can squeeze a little labor out of them, let\u2019s work around that basic\nlaw and make a second law. And this law -- and I have it here, in -- in Xerox copy, th-the\nWannsee Conference Law of 1942 states that when the people come to concentration\ncamp, anyone under 18 is to be killed on arrival and anyone over 45 1s to be killed on\narrival. And so they were. So that narrow gap, between 18 and 45 was allowed to sort of\nkill themselves. Die of natural causes, namely starvation and -- and h-hard labor and\nbeatings and infections and finally then of course also, the gas chamber. So this should\nnot be forgotten. So after we, who are now in our 70\u2019s, are gone, there are very few true\nsurvivors left, because of that ominous law of killing people under 18. When I tell that to\nstudents, that -- they really sit up and -- and take notice. It was really beastly. It was\nreally beastly.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: You're hitting all the right spots and some of them are sore. Yes, that was an ingrained\ninstinct, not only because of the Nazis, but you know, we grew up obeying. We grew up\nobeying our parents and our grandparents and our teachers and our rabbis. And our -- our\nelders. That\u2019s how we were brought up. That was the Jewish way and of course the\nGerman way also. And then Hitler came upon the scene and suddenly we had to obey for\nvery different reasons and -- and really k -- knuckle down and obey, or we were killed.\nThere was no question about it. They came with their sticks and their dogs. And to this\nday I -- I\u2019m so uncomfortable around dogs and I think it\u2019s because of that. They always\nhad their dogs with them. And we had to give up all our animals, you see, so that there\u2019d\nbe no interaction with dogs or cats or anything, because they always had their dogs on\ntheir side. So here they came, a-an -- and we didn\u2019t even question obedience. We didn\u2019t\neven question it and I\u2019m ashamed to say it today. When they made us the -- the -- the --\nthe instigators of our own death, we obeyed. Why didn\u2019t we just lay down and die instead\nof -- instead of obeying them and ha -- aiding them? We were going to be killed anyway.\nYou know that -- I don\u2019t think that occurred to us. We obeyed and that was all there was\nto it. That\u2019s the way -- you didn\u2019t know you could disobey. I -- we didn\u2019t know there was\ncivil disobedience. That\u2019s an American institution. We didn\u2019t know that. So we obeyed.\nNow, to come to this -- to the present, how did I deal with it over here? I have to really\nthink. Yeah, we were shocked at the time when the 60\u2019s came and -- and the ki -- and our\nown kids were sitting s-sit-outs or sit-ins? Sit ins. I was shocked. That didn\u2019t occur to us.\nAnd we didn\u2019t al-allow our kids to disobey very much either. It really was ingrained. I\nguess 1n a way it still is. I guess in a way it has never quite left. I remember -- I remember\nvery well that I was married for 19 years and I finally one day stood up to my husband.\nAnd it\u2019s a strong memory. I thought, \u201cMy God, I\u2019m married 19 years and this is the first\ntime I\u2019m speaking back to him.\u201d I-It -- you just didn\u2019t. But, of course the circumstances\nwere different. Nobody yells at me now or orders me to do things. I do it because I want\nto. So I think some of that is still with me. I -- I think it is. And the obedience to God, that\nreally never quite left me either. That is the best I can explain it. But, of course I\u2019m very\nmuch my own person now. I hope. I am. I don\u2019t know if that answers your question, but\nit\u2019s about all I can do. But you know, there is a certain freedom in obedience also. I\u2019m\nfree to -- to do as I wish, e1-either to go along with what\u2019s expected of me, or not to. And\nthat\u2019s very nice too, so if I go along, it\u2019s because I want to.",
        "A: It\u2019s very hard to say. The wer -- I never thought the world would be in such dire\nstraights as it is now. I really thought they had learned a little something, but they\nhaven\u2019t. I -- I don\u2019t think things have changed. I -- I -- I don\u2019t think the world as such has\ngotten any better. But I -- I think -- I think this country at least is more aware of not\nblindly ob-obeying. Of not blindly walking along and doing their own thing and I -- I\u2019m\nvery thrilled about that. But I think they\u2019re going overboard now. Th-This freedom to\ninvestigate everybody, that\u2019s too much. That\u2019s almost again like Hitler, this perse -- this -\n- this persecution of a person or -- of a person, that -- I -- I just can\u2019t see that. That can\nonly lead to more trouble. But -- but th-the liberty to criticize anybody, right up to your\npresident, that is a thrilling aspect. That reporters can -- can have a say of what they\nthink, that\u2019s unheard -- that was unheard of in Germany. Every newspaper had to print\nwhat Hitler told them to, you see? And that\u2019s why it -- it became so widespread. So I\nthink the world has learned some things. That people have to be honest and have to say\nwhat they think and have to stand up and march for their rights. But 1-1n other wer -- in\nother parts of the world, not too much has changed and things are still pretty bad.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m thinking now of -- of where people are really oppressed. Of Third World\ncountries where people ca -- one of the truths of -- of -- of political life is that you can\u2019t\nrebel unless you have already reached a certain level. And Hitler made sure that the\nGermans never reached that level. He kept them down. But Third -- Third World\ncountries can\u2019t rebel. They haven\u2019t got enough food in their stomachs and not enough\nvoice in their lungs. But here, where everything is so great and wonderful and people can\ndo as they wish and have the -- the personal strength to do it, they can rebel. But while\nthey were slaves, they couldn\u2019t do anything about it either.",
        "A: So there\u2019s a -- a natural gra-gradient up the ladder where for a long time they can\u2019t do\nanything about it and then as you get a little better, a little higher up, then you can object\nand can make yourself heard. And you should. But each country and each person has to\nfind th-that uphill grade by themselves.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "A: Yes, I went back at least twice to my town, Anspach, that beautiful, baroque town\nwith the beautiful cobblestones and the [indecipherable] and the castle and the churches\nand everything. See how pretty it is, with stained glass windows and these gorgeous roofs\nall covered with that tile. And I -- I -- I -- I used to like my hometown, I w -- I was a v --\na very happy girl there, before Hitler and I used to love it. I remember so many little\nthings. M-My grandmother once took me to the -- to the Hoffgarden, which is like a\narboretum, at night when I was very little, because there was a Queen of the Night that\nwas opening up at night and she wanted me to see that and I never forgot it. It had such\nan aroma to it and at -- it -- I could see the petals opening, I was just a young girl and it\nwas dark and there were these white petals opening up and throwing their -- their\nperfume at me. I never forgot it. So there were many reasons why I liked my hometown a\nlot. But I went back and I -- I -- I was most unhappy there. I felt so -- I felt as if I had an\nitchy skirt -- shirt on me. As if I wanted to scratch myself all the time and get out of there.\nAnd Anspach was notoriously anti-Semitic and it was very interesting. I -- I had -- I\nwanted to see the synagogue, which is a -- a beautiful, historical building. It was built by\nthe same architect that built the castle for the margraff there. At that point the Jews were\nin -- in good standing with the margraff and they asked for a synagogue and he -- that\nwas in 1745 -- 300 -- 500 -- 400 years ago and he gave them his own architect and helped\nthem build this beautiful synagogue, here it is. See, this is the castle and the synagogue\nhas the same high windows, that I\u2019Il show you in a minute, if I can find it. So, I was very\nanxious to go back and I had to ask for the key to the synagogue at the -- at the city hall,\nbecause now it\u2019s closed. There are no Jews living there, so it\u2019s just a memorial. And I\nwent to the city hall and I asked for the -- for the key and they told me that -- I asked in --\nin German, you know, I didn\u2019t want them to know who I am. And -- and I asked and they\nsaid I had to wait a few minutes, the fellow th-that -- who I had corresponded with that I\nwas coming, Mr. Lung, will be here in a minute, he\u2019s out celebrating his birthday. And I\nhad noticed that on the letters that he had written to me, telling me I had to come and get\nthe key myself, he never used his first name, he always said his title, whatever it was,\nRaths -- something Lung and there was no first name. And so I waited a few minutes and\nhe came back from his birthday party and I could figure out from the date that where we\nare now and hi -- this was his 50th birthday party, that he was born right smack in the\nHitler regime. And when he came in, you know, the whole office exploded, \u201cOh, g-\nglerkil -- glerklishan kiportstak, Adolf.\u201d So you see, the whole city was so anti -- so pro-\nHitler that they named their little kids Adolf. And that\u2019s why he never used his -- his\nname, he was ashamed of -- he could change it actually, he\u2019s sitting right there in city\nhall. It\u2019s not hard for him to change. But you know, you\u2019re -- you\u2019re fine tuned. You pick\nup things that other people would -- that then I would never have picked up. He didn\u2019t\nuse his name and he was born just -- just 1933 and his parents named him Adolf in -- in --\nin adoration of their fuehrer, you see? So -- so everything contributed to my being very\nuncomfortable there. And he gave me the key and I went through the synagogue and of\ncourse as soon as I had opened up that very beautiful synagogue, other people came,\npushing in and of course he didn\u2019t allow that, so he cut my visit short and you know,\neverything was just against me and I da -- I wa -- I wasn\u2019t happy there.",
        "A: Yes. I looked at my house, which again, I was so happy there and I thought, \u201cOh, I\njust want to see it once more.\u201d But it turned out to be a terrible experience. Number one, I\nwalked up those few steps of 200 Strasserfunfe and I look at the little plaque that\u2019s there\nand it was still the man who drove us out, who got the house from us from prac -- next to\nnothing. So, by implication, all my furniture and all my belongings and all my stuff must\nhave still been in my house. Cause he surely didn\u2019t throw it out or do anything with it, we\nhad left everything. And he moved in. He moved into a ready set table and made up beds.\nSo, I already had that feeling, oh, what am I doing here? And then to make things even\nworse, he had one of those big German Shepherd dogs that I -- that I feared so much,\nboth physically and mentally. So, of course, I didn\u2019t -- I asked if I could walk through\nand at least see -- see the garden and everything, but -- he said yes, but how could I with\nthat dog sitting there, you know\u201d? So that was a very bad experience and I turned right\naround and walked out.",
        "A: No, but I think he guessed it. Who else would come and look at an 0 -- a house that\nhad no historical significance? I may have said I lived here once, or something. But I\ndidn\u2019t kno -- but I had my daughter with me, who -- the one who 1s living in France now\nand we started out from Strasbourg to -- wh-where she had relatives and we were visiting\nand it took us very little time to come by car from Strasbourg, just across the Rhine into\nAnspach, it was maybe -- maybe a two hour car ride and she came with me. And I was\nextremely taken by her reaction. She -- she couldn\u2019t believe that my hometown was --\nwas there. You see, in her mind, it was some -- someplace on the moon, you know. And\nthat the people who bought my house were -- were there. In her mind they were monsters\nthat were living in Dante\u2019s Inferno, you know\u201d? And they were here, right there, she saw\nthem. She could touch the doorpost and -- and see their names and everything. A-And\nshe was flabbergasted that two hours from her, there was actually where it all took place.\nI -- I never even thought of -- she was so moved by that experience, she was just beside\nherself. And we took her to the synagogue and -- where my parents used to stand and as -\n- which is a beautiful, beautiful synagogue, I\u2019m so sorry we lost that to the Germans. I\nmade a little bit of an effort to have it transposed t-to Israel, as some synagogues have\nbeen, but I didn\u2019t get any res -- \u201cNo, that\u2019s ours now, that\u2019s a museum, there\u2019s nothing to\ndo with you any more.\u201d And then I asked for a -- some records, \u201cWell, we don\u2019t have\nthem. We sent them all to Israel.\u201d\u201d You know. They were anti-Semites and they still are\nanti-Semites. And they always will be. And my other da -- we took my other daughter,\nHedwick, the one that\u2019s named after my father\u2019s -- my husband\u2019s mother to the cemetery\nin Frankfort where my husband\u2019s parents are buried. And she had the shock of her life,\ntoo, because she saw her name on the grave-gravestone there. She still goes by her\nmaiden name, Heddy Haas and there was Hedwick Haas, buried under a stone with her\nname and she was also -- she finally realized she\u2019s named after a person that\u2019s lying\nthere, you see? So, really the children open up your eyes all over again.",
        "A: No. I -- I don\u2019t want to. I -- I just don\u2019t want to. And I don\u2019t want to go to Auschwitz.\nAnd I have a hard time going to -- to Holocaust museums. I have a hard time. At your\nmuseum -- at the US Holocaust Museum, I -- I -- I wa -- I was almost sick with anxiety\nbecause -- because it was the real thing, once you were in there, you couldn\u2019t get out.\nYou had to go through the whole rooms and upstairs and downstairs and this room and\nthat room. There was no way out, just like then. And you had to go through it until you\nwere finally out of there. I -- I was sweating. I -- so I\u2019m not comfortable with those things\nat all. But I can\u2019t -- I can\u2019t shake it, either. I can\u2019t shake it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, I -- I can. You see, when we finally, finally realized that we really should leave --\nalso our rabbi never urged us to and people began to leave from Anspach, they were\npacking their belongings, their furniture and the whole business into large lifts and were\nsending them over here. And my mother was able to give little packages to a few of the\npeople to take along. \u201cTake it,\u201d she said, \u201ctake it. Maybe we\u2019ll show up there too,\nsomeday. And if not, you keep it.\u201d So these were friends, you know, it was no great\ndanger that they would walk off with it. And if they did, you know, who cared, nobody\nknew. But they -- nobody did. So when I came over here -- and also when my father\ncame over here, all of a sudden people brought him things that -- that were his and he\ndidn\u2019t know that. He didn\u2019t know he -- I have such beautiful tablecloths that my mother\nand my aunt hand did and you know, th-these were important things for them. And then a\nfew pieces of silver, like this here, just a tiny little ashtray. One octagonal and the other\necliptical or what do you call that shape? Very finely chaste and -- and molded and\nlovingly polished by me, every so -- every so often, because I -- I Just love those things.\nThey were my mothers and she thought enough of them to stick them into somebody\u2019s\nbag and I got them again. And her own -- her own engagement ring, she gave to my\nfather to take along and he kept it on him until he was able to give it to me and I have\nalready given it to one of my daughters and little things like that. Very few things. This\nShabbas lamp, for instance, that is an old lamp that the people used before -- actually\nbefore wax candles and before electricity to light their Sabbath lights on. It had oil in it\nand wicks and before Shabbat you would light all the -- all the eight arms of it and it\nwould ga -- go for at least 10 or 12 hours and that way you had light. And I happen to\nhave the one that was in my house in Anspach.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Okay. Okay, these -- my father was already in -- in America and mother was stuck in\nMunich. You see, we had to leave Anspach and had to move in with some relatives in a\nbig city. My sister was already then in Frankfort, at the Jewish hospital as a nurse and I\nwas in Berlin as a Jewish nurse. So we were all separated and in order to save postage,\nwhich was -- was a big deal in those days, we would write to my mother, to Munich and\nthen she would include our letters into hers. But, as you can see here, there\u2019s a note from\nFreidel and possibly a note from me somewheres too, but not right here. So here she\nwrites, on N-November the ninth, on a Sunday, in 1941 -- yeah, I was wrong, was the\nSeptember date, I -- I blacked out there for awhile. September was her birthday and she\nwrote to him at that time -- and I think it\u2019s in here, too, that she got as a birthday present\nwhat everybody else got too, September 19th of 1941 and that was the star. And whether\nmy father caught on or not, I don\u2019t know, but she couldn\u2019t outright say that. But I -- I\nunderstood it when I reread her letter. So I got my dates wrong. On November the ninth,\nshe was beginning to be de-deported and she says, \u201cMy dear Siegfried, it is difficult to\nme to wr -- for me to write to you today, because I have to give you sad news. I have\ngotten my notification for transport, for the transport that leaves here on Tuesday. I\u2019m so\nsorry for you and for the children. I know you will be upset, but I beg you, dear Siegfried,\ndon\u2019t grieve and don\u2019t be pessimistic. I am calm and I\u2019m not excited. The children feared\ndeporta-deportation already for a long time and have been worried about me all this time.\nTomorrow I must call them and talk to them. I only hope that they will be spared. I beg\nyou, dear Siegfried, don\u2019t be upset and don\u2019t be sad and most of all, do not blame\nyourself. If anyone deserves to be blamed, it is I, because it was I who urged you to leave\nwithout us. We human beings are a thing of naught. I see it clearer now than ever before.\nAll our planning, our hopes and toil comes to nothing when God decides differently. I\nthink now, if only I had done this or that, but it\u2019s no use. It\u2019s all destined by God. Here I\nam, making a farewell speech, but as yet I hope that I can write to you where I\u2019m going. I\nhaven\u2019t heard anything from mother in Redensberg or from Berta in Aidid. I hope they\nwill be spared. I will write to you a second letter today before I must go. Lovingly,\nPaula.\u201d Yeah, that was the ninth of November, 1941. And she wrote that same day,\nanother letter. \u201cMy dear Siegfried, to continue, I have a letter to send you from the\nchildren also; it\u2019s a week old. I had hoped so much that Freidel would be able to come for\na few days before I would be deported, but really, I didn\u2019t believe that I would actually be\ncalled up. And now it\u2019s a reality, as I told you in the first letter. I am in the first\nevacuation from Munich. I don\u2019t imagine it as all too black and I\u2019m not upset and of\ncourse Ill write to you from there as soon as possible, but don\u2019t be concerned if it takes\nlong. And I repeat, dear Siegfried, don\u2019t worry about me and don\u2019t reproach yourself.\nFate 1s stronger than we are. If it\u2019s God will that we will be reunited, He can arrange that\nfrom there, just as it is His will that I could not get to you from here. I\u2019ve packed already,\nhave taken all my warm clothes along. Frau Kaufman, the old lady who lives with me is\nalso in the transport and many of my old friends. Together our lot will be easier to pare --\nbear. Now my dear Siegfried, I have just talked with the children. Freidel wants to come\nwith me and Gerda too. I don\u2019t know if they can get travel permission and at any rate,\nthey should stay and keep in contact with you. Farewell.\u201d On the 11th she was deported\nto Ausch -- to Riga. She was 45 years old. On the ninth she was called and on the 11th\nshe was deported. And the ways of God are indeed strange.

        "A: We'll wind up, yes. I have a stack of letters here that you can see is quite an\nimpressive collection of -- of -- of letters that I received from my first book. And you\nknow, I got only one criticism in that whole time on the first book and it was from a\nPolish man -- a Pole, not a Jew, who objected to my stating in the book that the Poles\nwere the most anti-Semitic nation in -- in Europe and he pointed out to me in that letter,\nwhich of course I saved, that the Poles had done a lot for the Jews back in the olden days,\nwhich 1s correct. The kings of Pole -- Poland took the Jews in and let them prosper there\nand indeed they prospered in Poland. The Jewish community of Poland was outstanding.\nBut during Hitler time, I remain with my -- with my statement that Poland was the most\nviolently anti-Semitic country in Europe. But all the other letters, except for that one,\nwere -- were with me -- were with me. Some were eye openers, that they didn\u2019t know\nwhat was going on. Some said, \u201cYeah, I was there too and you described it just right.\u201d\nOthers thanked me for opening up and others complimented me for being able to do it.\nAnd that was, of course, in \u201883, after my first book came out. Now I wrote a second book\nand that came out in \u201893 and I wrote that for a younger audience and you know, the\ninteresting thing 1s, I did not get the response that I got the first time. I don\u2019t know why.\nIt may have to do with the editor\u2019s broadcasting it less, publish it -- publicizing it less.\nBut I give the book to Bat Mitzvah and Bas Mitzvah -- and Bar Mitzvah kids and kids\nthat I think would understand. They are 12 and 13 years old and they should know. And I\ngave it recently to one of my little -- little 13 year -- 12 year old friends who had a -- a --\na Bat Mitzvah. She lives actually right across the street from me and she writes me, \u201cDear\nDr. and Mrs. Rudolf Haas, thank you very much for celebrating this special occasion with\nme. Your gift was wonderful. I finished the book with a completely different attitude\ntoward the Holocaust. I was often afraid to read Holocaust books, because I feared they\nwould give me nightmares. Reading the stories of all these people made me realize how\nmany good people there were. I also need to remember that the Holocaust was a reality\nand it wasn\u2019t a nightmare. Thank you for everything you have done for me. Sincerely,\nSophie Rappaport.\u201d And that was now -- that\u2019s a young girl, that -- the third generation\nafter me. It still lives and they still want to know.",
