        "Q: Please tell us your name.",
        "A: Lore Baer.",
        "Q: And where and when were you born?",
        "A: I was born in Amsterdam, Holland, August 26, 1938. And, uh, my parents had come to\nAmsterdam from Germany. Uh, my mother was born in Erfurt which is the eastern sector of\nGermany and my father was born in Frankfurt-am-Main. And, uh, in 1933, my, my parents\ncame to Holland to avoid, uh, and evade Hitler. Uh, it was no no longer safe for Jewish\npeople to be in, in Germany at that time and they thought that they would be safer in in\nHolland. Uh, a friend of my father's had started a butcher shop in Amsterdam, uh, on a street\ncalled the Van Baerlestraat which is a main street right across from the Concertgebouw. It's\nstill...it, it's still a big street in in Amsterdam today and, uh, he opened up a butcher shop and\nalthough my father didn't have any background 1n, in, in that business at all, he felt that that\nwas the only way he could really leave Germany and have an income so he, uh, went into a\npartnership with this friend of his and, uh, was in Amsterdam for several years before my\nmother joined him there. My mother and, uh, my grandfather, uh, came to Amsterdam and,\nuh, joined my father and I was born, as I said, in 1938, and at that time things seemed to be\ngoing fairly smoothly. We didn't have a tremendous amount of problems. I grew up pretty\nmuch like any young, uh, kid would in, you know, in Holland. I learned how to speak the\nlanguage. Although my parents were German, they also learned to speak the language,\nwhich probably wasn't that difficult for them. They were still pretty young and, uh, I went to\nnursery school and my mother helped my father in the store because, uh, it was growing and\nso she and, uh, and he and ran the store and my grandfather took care of me, and he was\npretty much the one who was in charge of, uh, my growing up and he and I went walking\ntogether and I have very fond memories of my, as I called him my opa\u2019 and, uh, he was my\nmother's father and the only grandparent that I ever knew. Uh, my other grandparents had\ndied before I was born and, uh, he was just very dear to me and very special and, but he\nbecame ill. He was quite a bit older, uh, than my grandmother had been, although she died\nwhen my mother was sixteen and, uh, my grandfather was not too well and, but he lived with\nus in an apartment in, uh, in Amsterdam. Uh, I'm not exactly sure of the, the street although\nmy mother has said that it's the street called Wauwermanstraat, uh, which does exist today as\nwell. Uh, I don't recall a great deal about my very early childhood except that my grandfather\nwas very, very dear to me and that I had a little playmate called Harold who, uh, was the son\nof, uh, my father's partner. Unfortunately he died when, before my childhood friend Harold,\nuh, was born, so he never knew his father and so we were quite a large extended family. Uh,\n' Grandpa.\nthis young boy Harold, his mother Erna, and my mother, my father, my grandfather and I\nand we, we were very close and, uh, again I don't remember a great deal of what was\nhappening, uh,\nin Amsterdam at the time except I knew that the climate, what the climate was like and there\nwas a tremendous amount of tension and I saw that my parents worked very hard and were\nvery serious and I just remembered that and I remember my mother being very nervous a lot\nand crying a lot and I remember my, uh, my grandfather, a tremendous amount of concern\nabout my grandfather and I only found out really much later that, uh, the reason there was\nthis concern was because the Germans were beginning to round up old people in Holland\nand they were beginning to round them up to take them to concentration camps. And when I\nwas about, I guess it was four or five, somewhere in that area, uh, my grandfather was in\nfact, uh, taken away by the Gestapo and I remember that very well. I remember, I remember\nhim being in a wheel chair and I remember standing next to him and I remember there was a\nknock on the door and and my mother was screaming and I don't know what she was\nscreaming except something like they're coming, they're coming. Uh, so, you know, for\nopa...they're coming for opa...and I think up to, up till that time my father did what ever he\ncould, uh, to, uh, either bribe the Germans and with, with salami and meat and because the\nbutcher shop was a very desirable thing but I guess it, 1t reached the point where that could\nno longer be done and so these two uniformed men...that's all I remember...they were very\ntall...they knocked on the door and my grandfather was in a wheel chair and there was really\nnothing to be done. They just took him away and and I never saw him again. And they took\nhim to Bergen-Belsen and and that was the last I ever saw of him, and shortly after that, uh,\nthings just started turning very bad. I think that that was when they were rounding Jews. It\nwas in 19, uh, 43 or maybe before that already. Uh, they were starting to round up Jews and\ndeporting them and my father had, uh, made friends with this very nice couple. They were\ncalled Elsa and Sam Izaaks, uh, and they lived somewhere in near Amsterdam I think in a\nplace called Zandvoort which is Am..a suburb and, uh, she was Gentile and he was Jewish\nand she worked for the...they both worked for the underground. They both tried to help\nplace, uh, families with, with, uh, Dutch Gentile families. They tried to help Jewish families\nand, uh, and so my father asked if there was any way that they could, uh, try to find a place\nfor them and it was told to me that it was not safe for, uh, for us to be together, so, uh, we\nhad to be separated and my mother and father had to leave me and find...and the\nunderground had to find a place for me and they had to find a place for them as well.\nAnd I guess I really...I don't really remember how I felt, but I must have felt or what I think\nnow, what I think about and how it must have felt to, you know, to leave your child must\nhave been pretty unbearable for my parents and it was probably very difficult for me too, but\nagain I don't remember that very, very well. Uh, again it was told to me that I had been\nplaced by this couple with, uh, one other or maybe two other families in, uh, Gentile families\nin Holland, but that I didn't like them and I didn't want to stay with them and I cried a lot and\nI was very unhappy so they, uh, they found this wonderful family for me who I lived with for\ntwo years and they were the Schouten family and they lived in, uh, Oosterlokker which is\nabout forty miles outside of Amsterdam and they had a farm and it was Ma and Pa\nSchouten,\u201d and they were I guess in their fifties. Uh, and they had five children. They had\ntwo daughters...uh, Triene [Catheriena] and Cornelia, and three sons and that was Jan\n[Johannes], uh, Kees [Cornelius] and Cor [Cornelis], and they were all in their twenties but\nthe one that I was the most attached to was Cornelia. She was twenty-five at the time that I\nwas five and placed with her and she was just very special. She sort of took me under her\nwing, uh, and when I cried for my mother and father, she just... she was just with me. She\njust comforted me and at night when I cried she would sleep with me and she would hold my\nhand and she would tell me stories and, uh, they were very religious Catholic people and, uh,\nthey went to church regularly and of course before I left, my mother had told me that my\nname would not be the same. I would be living with other people, not with them, and I\nshould never divulge my real name because it would not be safe and I should not divulge\nthat I was Jewish and I should just remember that that they loved me very much and that\nhopefully they would see me again and, uh, they were, uh, and I, I just remember that this\nfamily was very special and warm and and good and I just really loved them and, uh, I liked\nbeing there and they had, uh, because they had such a large family they had a lot of children\nin the neighborhood for me to play with and from what Cornelia tells me now, while I don't\nremember it, I didn't cry very much after the first week and I didn't seem to miss my parents\nvery much after that and I sort of just fit in and played with the children in the neighborhood\nand one of the things I thought about was how I fit in with them, because I had always\npictured that I would...this is in going back and thinking what it might have been like then\n..and I had always pictured that all Dutch people had blonde hair so I had fantasized that I\nhad had my hair dyed blonde and I asked Cornelia on this trip whether I in fact had my hair\ndyed blonde and she said no, it wasn't necessary because her father, uh, had dark hair. In fact\nhe was called, uh, the black Schouten because there were others with that name but they all\nhad blonde hair and he was, uh, and he had dark hair so it's not as though I didn't fit in, uh, in\nterms of, you know, hair coloring. I did.\nAnd there were a number of things that I probably fantasized in terms of, uh, coming to\nterms myself with what happened at the time and how I might have been protected by these\npeople. Uh, from I, I seem to have remembered clearly that by because I was Catholic now\nand living with this family that I had a rosary and that I, I prayed with this rosary every day\nand Cornelia doesn't remember that at all, so I would think that if she doesn't remember it, it\nprobably never happened but this is probably how I sort of resolved my being Catholic and\nalso, uh, I thought that I was brought up by the nuns in the Catholic school, and again I don't\nthink that that...Cornelia doesn't seem to think that there were any nuns in the school that I\nwent to. Uh, I was, uh, a very stubborn child and I...1t was told to me that I was, when I went\n* Martha Schouten-Stam and Theodorus Schouten.\nto school, uh, I was really, uh, I was not very...uh, what's the word I'm looking for...empathic\nwith people who weren't religious Catholics and that if I saw people that weren't, or kids that\nweren't that weren't, uh, saying their prayers or doing their homework I would point them out\nas not being good Catholics like I was. Uh, and when I came to the Shoutens, my name as I\nsaid could not be Lore Baer. It was Lora Kruk and, uh, I hated that name and because it\nmeant that I wasn't anything. I wasn't Baer and I wasn't Schouten, so I really, uh, begged\nthem to have me, name me Schouten so after a lot of cajoling, I guess, they agreed that I\ncould call myself Lore Schouten.\nNow, uh, the Schouten family, uh, Ma and Pa were also very stubborn, uh, Dutch people.\nThey, they lived in a neighborhood that seemed to be very sympathetic to, to people who\nwere, uh, discriminated against in any way, not necessarily Jews, and I was under the\nimpression that the two other people who they harbored...there were two other people living\nwith me, uh, underground on the farm...I was under the impression that they were Jewish but\nit turns out that neither of them were Jewish. They were, uh, young men who, who were to\nbe conscripted into the German army and they did not want to, uh, join the army because\nthey didn't want to have anything to do with the Germans, so they were also fleeing and they\nwere also in hiding and, uh, they did not...and they were sympathetic to this as well as the\nother neighbors in the area were sympathetic to the same, uh, to Jews as well as to\nProtestants as well as to conscientious objectors or people who just didn't sympathize with\nthe Germans, which there many of and it seems to me that my, my memories of this family\nand my life there were really, uh, very good memories. I don't remember a great deal of, uh,\nbombing of that area. I don't remember a great deal of, uh, hardship. In fact that particular\narea was very fortunate because it was a farm area and everybody, uh, in the area was either\na dairy farmer or a vegetable farmer and the Schouten family had a dairy farm. In fact,\nCornelia tells me that her father was supposed to deliver a certain quantity of, uh, milk to the\nGerman army and he was greatly opposed to doing this and he refused. He, in fact, he felt\nthat if he was going to produce milk he wanted to give it to the Dutch people and he was\ncalled, uh, in to, uh, by the Germans to come to Amsterdam. Again, this was told just to me\nthis week, which I didn't know about...uh, to explain his actions and it, it seems that, uh, in\norder for the Germans to, uh, to ma...to scare him, he was supposed to read when he came to\nAmsterdam a list of, uh, the names of all the people who had been killed by the Germans for\ndoing the same thing, and he knew that if he was to do this and he claimed that he couldn't\nread any German so...I mean that he couldn't read ...and that, so he didn't have to do that but\nthat's an indication of how stubborn this man was and how...but also how he risked his, you\nknow, his life and his ideals not only for the Jewish people but just for humanity and, you\nknow, just for doing the right thing. He felt so strongly that this was the wrong thing that,\nyou know, his actions in every way indicated that you must do what is right and listening to\nwhat the Germans tell you to do is not the right thing\nand, uh, he, uh, he obviously...his children obviously felt very much this way too. Uh,\nbecause and his grandchildren, because last year when I went back to, to, uh, to the farm\nwith some friends of mine, my friend asked one of the grandsons, uh, how...what he would\nhave done in a similar situation and his grandson said, 1s there any choice? How could I act\ndifferently? And it, it's to me incredible that a young person today who is now twenty years\nold would say that when obviously there were many choices and there are many people who\ndid other things and not what this family did. So my memories, uh, are that I that I led a\nfairly normal childhood there and and I, uh, helped on the farm. I didn't have any toys really\nbecause on the farm you, you know, you play outdoors and I played outdoors a lot. I went\nbicycling a lot and, uh, and it was my impression that when the Gestapo came around, uh, I\nhid with the two other undergrounders and there was a trap door in a closet that led to a\nhayloft. Now the way the, the house is constructed, the farmhouse is a house with the actual\nbarn and hayloft attached to it. It's all one building, so that the trap door of the closet that you\nwould, you know, it was the whole, basically the floor boards of the closet lifted up and led\nto a staircase which led under the ground and up to a little room in the hayloft and the little\nroom was covered over with hay and there was a window in this room which, when you\npush away the hay, you could see out but of course you didn't push away the hay because\nyou didn't want anybody to see you, so this was like a room within the hayloft that you got\nto, and this was the secret hiding place where we would remain, uh, when the Germans\ncame. Cornelia tells me that they came, when they did come, very often instead of hiding in\nthe hayloft she would, uh, bicycle with me to another neighborhood. We would just...she\nwould say to me let's just go for a bicycle ride and she would bike down the road with me to\nanother area, uh, so that I wouldn't be so scared because she, I gather, was felt that I would\nbe very frightened by having to hide, so she thought it would be better if, if it was a more\nnormal kind of a situation where we would just go bicycling together and she would try to\ndistract me. And I don't recall that,\nbut I do recall spending a lot of time with her and I remember a lot of the things that I really\nhad forgotten came back to me last year when I went back to, to the farmhouse, which I\ndidn't recognize at first because they had changed the front of it, but as I bicycled away from\nthe house and I looked towards...looked over my shoulder, I saw the farm the way I had\nremembered it and the part that had not been changed and then the, you know, just the\nvisuals came back to me and then I went back into the farm. Her brother lives in...Cornelia's\nbrother still lives on the farm now and it's pretty much intact the way it was when I was\nthere, except the room that I lived in is now, uh, a stall for animals and, uh, but other than\nthat nothing much has changed, and I've taken some, some photographs. I took some\nphotographs last year, uh, of that and the living room and the dining room and the kitchen\nare pretty much the way it was when I was there and it was interesting because when we sat\ndown and had lunch together, the thing that I remember was the soup and the way they made\nlittle meatballs and the smell of the soup and the way it was served and the prayer that they\nsaid before the meal are all things that I remember. It wasn't, uh...it was all the good things\nthat I remembered, and still remember, you know, just the warmth... churning butter with\nCornelia in the back and learning how to make cheese and learning how to bake, because a\nlot of that was done and Cornelia did a lot of that with me. Uh, that's what I remember. I\nremember just the warmth, uh, and that's, you know, to me the important part of things. Uh, I\ndon't remember, uh, the Gestapo coming except for one time and I seem to recall, although\nCornelia doesn't remember but her nephew Dick does have some memories of this, that there\nwas also a manhole cover in the garden in the...or not the garden but the pasture in back of\nthe house, uh, where we would also go down into it was like a sewer-like hole that would\nlead to, uh, into a a dark area. Now I may be confusing that with, uh, with the stairs and the\ncloset that we walked into. I don't know, because she doesn't re... recall it. Uh, and my\nrecollection was that we were staying down in that area for about a week, but she said it was\nmore like an hour if at all, so I guess, you know, time plays funny tricks on you.\nUh, the things that I remember too were the many people, uh, uh, that came to the house\nalways. There was always a great deal of activity at the house. Uh, the many relatives, the\naunts and uncles and cousins and brothers and sisters and family and the busy work place...\nyou know, the milking of the cows and, uh, and I remember making wreaths out of\nbuttercups for my hair, that Cornelia taught me how to make too. And, uh, very often she\nwould make me a little wreath that I would put around my hair and although I've tried to do\nthe same with my own children, I've forgotten how to do it. And again when I went back to\nHolland last year and I went biking through the fields, through the, through the countryside,\nthrough the Dutch countryside, 1t was really the memory that I have of the stillness and the\nsort of the flatness and the beauty of those buttercups that I remember and sort of the cows\ngrazing and just that sort of peaceful time and, uh, sometimes now that I think back I\nremember the green uniforms...the khaki colored uniforms of the Gestapo, but I think it must\nhave been difficult for the Gestapo in that area because the neighbors were very, very close\nwith each other and told each other when they were coming, when someone from the\nGestapo was coming by.\nAnd as I said earlier, I was fortunate to be in that particular region because when there was a\nfamine in Amsterdam, I think it was in '44, people came for vegetables and potatoes and\nmilk because there was no food to be had in Amsterdam. The only place where you could\nget food was in the farm country. What I remember is--I don't remember a tremendous\namount of hardships or famine, I don't remember doing without. I remember things were\ngood. When I think back how, what it must have been for my parents, its very different.\nLiving with another family, and they moved around a great deal before they found a family\nthat took them in where they felt comfortable. They were with people for about, at least four\nor five different families, and many of the families took in a lot of borders and a lot of them\ntook in Jews and got paid for it. It was very dangerous for a lot of people because they, for\npeople like my parents, so when they felt uncomfortable in a house, when they felt there\nwere people who might talk, and who might divulge that they were Jews, they had to move\non, and they were very fortunate also the last year and a half before the war ended to live\nwith a family, as it turned out, only ten miles from where I was living but unbeknownst to\nme and unbeknownst to them because it wasn't safe for them to know where I was because if\nthey knew they would want to find me, and if I knew I would want to probably find them as\nwell. So that was never spoken about and Cornelia tells me that her family did not know\nwhere my parents were, didn't know my real name, didn't know where I came from. But\nafter the war the family that my parents were with knew where I was living. They had know\nthat; somehow they had found out. But my family lived in very tight quarters. They lived\nwith a couple who had one daughter and in a town not far from Oosterblokker called\nBerkhout. I went, I went back there last year and unfortunately the house is not standing the\nway it was. It's now a garage. It was a very small, humble home and these people shared\nwhatever food they had; they were not farmers, with my mother and father. You know they\ndid the same thing that the Schouten family did, but my mother and father did not, were not\nable to leave the house and go bicycle riding and play outdoors. They had to stay in hiding\nin their house all those years. And it wasn't safe because no one in that neighborhood could\nreally know about them. I think maybe one other couple knew about them, but that was it.\nSo when the war did end and my mother and father came for me, I really didn't want to go\nback with them. Probably it was a combination of being worried that they would leave me\nagain, maybe it was that I had a new family name, I had friends, I was in school, I was\ncomfortable, and it was very difficult for me. I think it was more difficult for me after the\nwar than it was during the war. I just, I Just felt very much alone when I left because I didn't\nhave any friends and my mother and father really didn't know any people anymore in\nAmsterdam. They had no family. My grandfather, we never heard from again. And, so after,\nwhen my parents did come for me, I really didn't want to go with them at all. I claimed that I\ndidn't recognize my father. I had remembered him as very, very tall, and he wasn't all that tall\nand it was a very difficult thing for my mother and father whose only hope and only wish\nwas to be reunited with me. For me not to want to go with them must have been a really\nhorrible thing. I mean, I think back to what would happen in my situation, how it would feel.\nI mean it must have been awful. But I was just a kid, I was seven years old and I was\ninterested in playing and, you know, in my friends. So that's all I could think about.\nSo we went, after the war, my father was able to get his store back, his butcher shop, which\nhad been taken away by the Germans in 1943, when all Jews had to give up any of their\nproperty and any of their belongings and their apartments and whatever they had that\nbelonged to them, they had to give up. But after the war he was able to reclaim his butcher\nshop, which he did, and he worked there for another two years, waiting to get a visa to come\nto America. And the only way we could get that really was through my father's brother who\nwas living in America and he helped us with the formalities of getting to the United States.\nAnd I went back to school in Amsterdam and had a very difficult time in Amsterdam, in the\ncity and the school, and missed the farm a great deal. I remember I was very sad and I was\nvery nervous at night. I remember not sleeping well at all because I was so scared that my\nparents would leave me again or that the Germans would come and I guess I just couldn't\nreally understand the concept of the war and the end of the war, and that it was all over and\nnow I would be with my parents again forever, and I really missed my playmates. I\nremember that very well and, uh, we lived in an apartment that...it's sort of vague to me, but\nit was an apartment that I think while our...while we couldn't get our our original apartment\nback we lived in this, uh, apartment that one of the Germans had lived in during the war who\nwas quite wealthy, and I remember the apartment as being quite luxurious and the kind of a\nplace where you couldn't touch anything and and so different from the farm where, you\nknow, everything was so comfortable and I could just run around and here I felt I had to be\nthis proper lady and everything had to be kept perfectly because the apartment didn't belong\nto us and the furnishings didn't belong to us and nothing really belonged to us and, uh, I just\nfelt uncomfortable, and, uh, I don't remember anything about school. I remember that there\nwas a young boy who I was friendly with who lived in this apartment...uh, it was a\nbrownstone on the Amsteldik in, in Amsterdam. And I remember befriending him and I\nremember being close with him and I remember again then having to come to America and\nbeing uprooted from from him as well, and I don't remember seeing my family, the farm\nfamily, at all after that.\nUh, and I remember when I came to America living in the Bronx with another family\nbecause we didn't have any money and they took us in for about a year and I started to learn\nEnglish and they were very good to us. They had three daughters and one of them took me\nunder her wing and taught me English and, uh, we lived with them in their house for about a\nyear and again, I felt, you know, this sort of constant uprooting and this not knowing where I\nwas really going to be. Will I ever be permanently in any one place and always the fear, you\nknow, of, of leaving but I really had... 1 was eighteen before I went back to Holland again to\nsee the Schoutens and it was very difficult for me. Uh, I was very, very nervous because I\ndidn't speak Dutch anymore. I never kept it up because my parents didn't speak Dutch at\nhome. They spoke only German because their friends were were friends that they had from\nGermany that came over to America before the war and they had a circle of German friends\nand they wanted to forget the war. They wanted to forget the time and so for them, uh, I\nmean Dutch just wasn't a language that was spoken. My mother wanted me to become\nAmericanized as quickly as possible. She wanted me to speak English. I didn't want to speak\nGerman because I hated the language. I hated the Germans. I hated everything that\nrepresented that time. So I didn't, uh, speak German and I didn't speak Dutch and when I\nwent back to Holland when I was eighteen, uh, I wanted to I wanted to, uh, you know, thank\nthese people for the wonderful thing they had done for me and how they had saved my life\nbut I was kind of tongue-tied, you know. I just didn't have the words and I had heard that the\nDutch people really hated, uh, if they hated the Germans and they hated people who spoke\nGerman and while I didn't speak German I I understood German perfectly and when I spoke\nwhatever Dutch I knew, I kept mixing my Dutch and German, and I was really afraid that I\nwas going to offend them that by speaking, you know, Dutch with a, with German mixed in\nand it really took me all these years to realize that they wouldn't care what I spoke. They\nreally had no, you know, uh, I mean it didn't really matter. I think it took me up till last year\nto realize that...that I could have spoken to them in gibberish...1t would have been all right,\nuh, you know, because whatever connection I felt, they must have felt too. So I feel very...I\nfeel very sad that I hadn't kept up a connection with this family all these years. I really, uh,\nonly started thinking about Holland and what I went through again when I was fifty last year,\nand that's when I felt that I had to go back and make a connection again, even though the\nparents that, uh, kept me were no longer alive, uh, and the only real connection that I felt that\nI had there was Cornelia and, uh, again the problem of the language, but luckily there were\nmany people in Holland that spoke Dut...uh, English that were able to interpret for me so\nwhen I went back to see Cornelia last year, 1t was a very short visit\nbecause again I felt like it would be very uncomfortable not being able to speak the\nlanguage, uh, but it, you know, gave me time from last year to this year to think about what\nthese people had done and to what it means, uh, not only to me but I think to to my children,\nto my family, to my friends...uh, that they have risked their lives at a time when it was very\ndangerous to go against what was told to them to do which was that all the Jews were being\nrounded up and and they must, you know, follow the dictum of the government of Germany\nwhich had occupied Holland at that time, and I really feel that for people to do what they did\nwithout any, uh, I mean to them what they did was what they feel every human being should\ndo. They really feel that it was nothing. They feel like what they did was only the nght thing,\nthat it's not something unusual for them and when I think about how, when I think back now\nwhat I would have done, I don't think I would have done the same thing. I think that if I had\na family and if there was a threat that my family might be killed or 1f my family would, uh,\nbe hurt or that I might be, I don't think I could have made that decision and now I will think\ndifferently because I lived through that, but I, I hope that people don't have to live through\nthat to make the decision to help another human being, to save another human being, and,\nuh, so that's why I think it's so important, you know, people like this, uh, talk about their\nexperiences so that other young people and our children and, uh, my friends\u2019 children and\nfuture generations will think about what it is to do the right thing and what it is to save\nhuman life and what it 1s to risk your own life, and that's I guess all I can say.",

        "A: I was born in Amsterdam, Holland, August 26, 1938. And, uh, my parents had come to\nAmsterdam from Germany. Uh, my mother was born in Erfurt which is the eastern sector of\nGermany and my father was born in Frankfurt-am-Main. And, uh, in 1933, my, my parents\ncame to Holland to avoid, uh, and evade Hitler. Uh, it was no no longer safe for Jewish\npeople to be in, in Germany at that time and they thought that they would be safer in in\nHolland. Uh, a friend of my father's had started a butcher shop in Amsterdam, uh, on a street\ncalled the Van Baerlestraat which is a main street right across from the Concertgebouw. It's\nstill...it, it's still a big street in in Amsterdam today and, uh, he opened up a butcher shop and\nalthough my father didn't have any background 1n, in, in that business at all, he felt that that\nwas the only way he could really leave Germany and have an income so he, uh, went into a\npartnership with this friend of his and, uh, was in Amsterdam for several years before my\nmother joined him there. My mother and, uh, my grandfather, uh, came to Amsterdam and,\nuh, joined my father and I was born, as I said, in 1938, and at that time things seemed to be\ngoing fairly smoothly. We didn't have a tremendous amount of problems. I grew up pretty\nmuch like any young, uh, kid would in, you know, in Holland. I learned how to speak the\nlanguage. Although my parents were German, they also learned to speak the language,\nwhich probably wasn't that difficult for them. They were still pretty young and, uh, I went to\nnursery school and my mother helped my father in the store because, uh, it was growing and\nso she and, uh, and he and ran the store and my grandfather took care of me, and he was\npretty much the one who was in charge of, uh, my growing up and he and I went walking\ntogether and I have very fond memories of my, as I called him my opa\u2019 and, uh, he was my\nmother's father and the only grandparent that I ever knew. Uh, my other grandparents had\ndied before I was born and, uh, he was just very dear to me and very special and, but he\nbecame ill. He was quite a bit older, uh, than my grandmother had been, although she died\nwhen my mother was sixteen and, uh, my grandfather was not too well and, but he lived with\nus in an apartment in, uh, in Amsterdam. Uh, I'm not exactly sure of the, the street although\nmy mother has said that it's the street called Wauwermanstraat, uh, which does exist today as\nwell. Uh, I don't recall a great deal about my very early childhood except that my grandfather\nwas very, very dear to me and that I had a little playmate called Harold who, uh, was the son\nof, uh, my father's partner. Unfortunately he died when, before my childhood friend Harold,\nuh, was born, so he never knew his father and so we were quite a large extended family. Uh,\n' Grandpa.\nthis young boy Harold, his mother Erna, and my mother, my father, my grandfather and I\nand we, we were very close and, uh, again I don't remember a great deal of what was\nhappening, uh,\nin Amsterdam at the time except I knew that the climate, what the climate was like and there\nwas a tremendous amount of tension and I saw that my parents worked very hard and were\nvery serious and I just remembered that and I remember my mother being very nervous a lot\nand crying a lot and I remember my, uh, my grandfather, a tremendous amount of concern\nabout my grandfather and I only found out really much later that, uh, the reason there was\nthis concern was because the Germans were beginning to round up old people in Holland\nand they were beginning to round them up to take them to concentration camps. And when I\nwas about, I guess it was four or five, somewhere in that area, uh, my grandfather was in\nfact, uh, taken away by the Gestapo and I remember that very well. I remember, I remember\nhim being in a wheel chair and I remember standing next to him and I remember there was a\nknock on the door and and my mother was screaming and I don't know what she was\nscreaming except something like they're coming, they're coming. Uh, so, you know, for\nopa...they're coming for opa...and I think up to, up till that time my father did what ever he\ncould, uh, to, uh, either bribe the Germans and with, with salami and meat and because the\nbutcher shop was a very desirable thing but I guess it, 1t reached the point where that could\nno longer be done and so these two uniformed men...that's all I remember...they were very\ntall...they knocked on the door and my grandfather was in a wheel chair and there was really\nnothing to be done. They just took him away and and I never saw him again. And they took\nhim to Bergen-Belsen and and that was the last I ever saw of him, and shortly after that, uh,\nthings just started turning very bad. I think that that was when they were rounding Jews. It\nwas in 19, uh, 43 or maybe before that already. Uh, they were starting to round up Jews and\ndeporting them and my father had, uh, made friends with this very nice couple. They were\ncalled Elsa and Sam Izaaks, uh, and they lived somewhere in near Amsterdam I think in a\nplace called Zandvoort which is Am..a suburb and, uh, she was Gentile and he was Jewish\nand she worked for the...they both worked for the underground. They both tried to help\nplace, uh, families with, with, uh, Dutch Gentile families. They tried to help Jewish families\nand, uh, and so my father asked if there was any way that they could, uh, try to find a place\nfor them and it was told to me that it was not safe for, uh, for us to be together, so, uh, we\nhad to be separated and my mother and father had to leave me and find...and the\nunderground had to find a place for me and they had to find a place for them as well.\nAnd I guess I really...I don't really remember how I felt, but I must have felt or what I think\nnow, what I think about and how it must have felt to, you know, to leave your child must\nhave been pretty unbearable for my parents and it was probably very difficult for me too, but\nagain I don't remember that very, very well. Uh, again it was told to me that I had been\nplaced by this couple with, uh, one other or maybe two other families in, uh, Gentile families\nin Holland, but that I didn't like them and I didn't want to stay with them and I cried a lot and\nI was very unhappy so they, uh, they found this wonderful family for me who I lived with for\ntwo years and they were the Schouten family and they lived in, uh, Oosterlokker which is\nabout forty miles outside of Amsterdam and they had a farm and it was Ma and Pa\nSchouten,\u201d and they were I guess in their fifties. Uh, and they had five children. They had\ntwo daughters...uh, Triene [Catheriena] and Cornelia, and three sons and that was Jan\n[Johannes], uh, Kees [Cornelius] and Cor [Cornelis], and they were all in their twenties but\nthe one that I was the most attached to was Cornelia. She was twenty-five at the time that I\nwas five and placed with her and she was just very special. She sort of took me under her\nwing, uh, and when I cried for my mother and father, she just... she was just with me. She\njust comforted me and at night when I cried she would sleep with me and she would hold my\nhand and she would tell me stories and, uh, they were very religious Catholic people and, uh,\nthey went to church regularly and of course before I left, my mother had told me that my\nname would not be the same. I would be living with other people, not with them, and I\nshould never divulge my real name because it would not be safe and I should not divulge\nthat I was Jewish and I should just remember that that they loved me very much and that\nhopefully they would see me again and, uh, they were, uh, and I, I just remember that this\nfamily was very special and warm and and good and I just really loved them and, uh, I liked\nbeing there and they had, uh, because they had such a large family they had a lot of children\nin the neighborhood for me to play with and from what Cornelia tells me now, while I don't\nremember it, I didn't cry very much after the first week and I didn't seem to miss my parents\nvery much after that and I sort of just fit in and played with the children in the neighborhood\nand one of the things I thought about was how I fit in with them, because I had always\npictured that I would...this is in going back and thinking what it might have been like then\n..and I had always pictured that all Dutch people had blonde hair so I had fantasized that I\nhad had my hair dyed blonde and I asked Cornelia on this trip whether I in fact had my hair\ndyed blonde and she said no, it wasn't necessary because her father, uh, had dark hair. In fact\nhe was called, uh, the black Schouten because there were others with that name but they all\nhad blonde hair and he was, uh, and he had dark hair so it's not as though I didn't fit in, uh, in\nterms of, you know, hair coloring. I did.\nAnd there were a number of things that I probably fantasized in terms of, uh, coming to\nterms myself with what happened at the time and how I might have been protected by these\npeople. Uh, from I, I seem to have remembered clearly that by because I was Catholic now\nand living with this family that I had a rosary and that I, I prayed with this rosary every day\nand Cornelia doesn't remember that at all, so I would think that if she doesn't remember it, it\nprobably never happened but this is probably how I sort of resolved my being Catholic and\nalso, uh, I thought that I was brought up by the nuns in the Catholic school, and again I don't\nthink that that...Cornelia doesn't seem to think that there were any nuns in the school that I\nwent to. Uh, I was, uh, a very stubborn child and I...1t was told to me that I was, when I went\n* Martha Schouten-Stam and Theodorus Schouten.\nto school, uh, I was really, uh, I was not very...uh, what's the word I'm looking for...empathic\nwith people who weren't religious Catholics and that if I saw people that weren't, or kids that\nweren't that weren't, uh, saying their prayers or doing their homework I would point them out\nas not being good Catholics like I was. Uh, and when I came to the Shoutens, my name as I\nsaid could not be Lore Baer. It was Lora Kruk and, uh, I hated that name and because it\nmeant that I wasn't anything. I wasn't Baer and I wasn't Schouten, so I really, uh, begged\nthem to have me, name me Schouten so after a lot of cajoling, I guess, they agreed that I\ncould call myself Lore Schouten.\nNow, uh, the Schouten family, uh, Ma and Pa were also very stubborn, uh, Dutch people.\nThey, they lived in a neighborhood that seemed to be very sympathetic to, to people who\nwere, uh, discriminated against in any way, not necessarily Jews, and I was under the\nimpression that the two other people who they harbored...there were two other people living\nwith me, uh, underground on the farm...I was under the impression that they were Jewish but\nit turns out that neither of them were Jewish. They were, uh, young men who, who were to\nbe conscripted into the German army and they did not want to, uh, join the army because\nthey didn't want to have anything to do with the Germans, so they were also fleeing and they\nwere also in hiding and, uh, they did not...and they were sympathetic to this as well as the\nother neighbors in the area were sympathetic to the same, uh, to Jews as well as to\nProtestants as well as to conscientious objectors or people who just didn't sympathize with\nthe Germans, which there many of and it seems to me that my, my memories of this family\nand my life there were really, uh, very good memories. I don't remember a great deal of, uh,\nbombing of that area. I don't remember a great deal of, uh, hardship. In fact that particular\narea was very fortunate because it was a farm area and everybody, uh, in the area was either\na dairy farmer or a vegetable farmer and the Schouten family had a dairy farm. In fact,\nCornelia tells me that her father was supposed to deliver a certain quantity of, uh, milk to the\nGerman army and he was greatly opposed to doing this and he refused. He, in fact, he felt\nthat if he was going to produce milk he wanted to give it to the Dutch people and he was\ncalled, uh, in to, uh, by the Germans to come to Amsterdam. Again, this was told just to me\nthis week, which I didn't know about...uh, to explain his actions and it, it seems that, uh, in\norder for the Germans to, uh, to ma...to scare him, he was supposed to read when he came to\nAmsterdam a list of, uh, the names of all the people who had been killed by the Germans for\ndoing the same thing, and he knew that if he was to do this and he claimed that he couldn't\nread any German so...I mean that he couldn't read ...and that, so he didn't have to do that but\nthat's an indication of how stubborn this man was and how...but also how he risked his, you\nknow, his life and his ideals not only for the Jewish people but just for humanity and, you\nknow, just for doing the right thing. He felt so strongly that this was the wrong thing that,\nyou know, his actions in every way indicated that you must do what is right and listening to\nwhat the Germans tell you to do is not the right thing\nand, uh, he, uh, he obviously...his children obviously felt very much this way too. Uh,\nbecause and his grandchildren, because last year when I went back to, to, uh, to the farm\nwith some friends of mine, my friend asked one of the grandsons, uh, how...what he would\nhave done in a similar situation and his grandson said, 1s there any choice? How could I act\ndifferently? And it, it's to me incredible that a young person today who is now twenty years\nold would say that when obviously there were many choices and there are many people who\ndid other things and not what this family did. So my memories, uh, are that I that I led a\nfairly normal childhood there and and I, uh, helped on the farm. I didn't have any toys really\nbecause on the farm you, you know, you play outdoors and I played outdoors a lot. I went\nbicycling a lot and, uh, and it was my impression that when the Gestapo came around, uh, I\nhid with the two other undergrounders and there was a trap door in a closet that led to a\nhayloft. Now the way the, the house is constructed, the farmhouse is a house with the actual\nbarn and hayloft attached to it. It's all one building, so that the trap door of the closet that you\nwould, you know, it was the whole, basically the floor boards of the closet lifted up and led\nto a staircase which led under the ground and up to a little room in the hayloft and the little\nroom was covered over with hay and there was a window in this room which, when you\npush away the hay, you could see out but of course you didn't push away the hay because\nyou didn't want anybody to see you, so this was like a room within the hayloft that you got\nto, and this was the secret hiding place where we would remain, uh, when the Germans\ncame. Cornelia tells me that they came, when they did come, very often instead of hiding in\nthe hayloft she would, uh, bicycle with me to another neighborhood. We would just...she\nwould say to me let's just go for a bicycle ride and she would bike down the road with me to\nanother area, uh, so that I wouldn't be so scared because she, I gather, was felt that I would\nbe very frightened by having to hide, so she thought it would be better if, if it was a more\nnormal kind of a situation where we would just go bicycling together and she would try to\ndistract me. And I don't recall that,\nbut I do recall spending a lot of time with her and I remember a lot of the things that I really\nhad forgotten came back to me last year when I went back to, to the farmhouse, which I\ndidn't recognize at first because they had changed the front of it, but as I bicycled away from\nthe house and I looked towards...looked over my shoulder, I saw the farm the way I had\nremembered it and the part that had not been changed and then the, you know, just the\nvisuals came back to me and then I went back into the farm. Her brother lives in...Cornelia's\nbrother still lives on the farm now and it's pretty much intact the way it was when I was\nthere, except the room that I lived in is now, uh, a stall for animals and, uh, but other than\nthat nothing much has changed, and I've taken some, some photographs. I took some\nphotographs last year, uh, of that and the living room and the dining room and the kitchen\nare pretty much the way it was when I was there and it was interesting because when we sat\ndown and had lunch together, the thing that I remember was the soup and the way they made\nlittle meatballs and the smell of the soup and the way it was served and the prayer that they\nsaid before the meal are all things that I remember. It wasn't, uh...it was all the good things\nthat I remembered, and still remember, you know, just the warmth... churning butter with\nCornelia in the back and learning how to make cheese and learning how to bake, because a\nlot of that was done and Cornelia did a lot of that with me. Uh, that's what I remember. I\nremember just the warmth, uh, and that's, you know, to me the important part of things. Uh, I\ndon't remember, uh, the Gestapo coming except for one time and I seem to recall, although\nCornelia doesn't remember but her nephew Dick does have some memories of this, that there\nwas also a manhole cover in the garden in the...or not the garden but the pasture in back of\nthe house, uh, where we would also go down into it was like a sewer-like hole that would\nlead to, uh, into a a dark area. Now I may be confusing that with, uh, with the stairs and the\ncloset that we walked into. I don't know, because she doesn't re... recall it. Uh, and my\nrecollection was that we were staying down in that area for about a week, but she said it was\nmore like an hour if at all, so I guess, you know, time plays funny tricks on you.\nUh, the things that I remember too were the many people, uh, uh, that came to the house\nalways. There was always a great deal of activity at the house. Uh, the many relatives, the\naunts and uncles and cousins and brothers and sisters and family and the busy work place...\nyou know, the milking of the cows and, uh, and I remember making wreaths out of\nbuttercups for my hair, that Cornelia taught me how to make too. And, uh, very often she\nwould make me a little wreath that I would put around my hair and although I've tried to do\nthe same with my own children, I've forgotten how to do it. And again when I went back to\nHolland last year and I went biking through the fields, through the, through the countryside,\nthrough the Dutch countryside, 1t was really the memory that I have of the stillness and the\nsort of the flatness and the beauty of those buttercups that I remember and sort of the cows\ngrazing and just that sort of peaceful time and, uh, sometimes now that I think back I\nremember the green uniforms...the khaki colored uniforms of the Gestapo, but I think it must\nhave been difficult for the Gestapo in that area because the neighbors were very, very close\nwith each other and told each other when they were coming, when someone from the\nGestapo was coming by.\nAnd as I said earlier, I was fortunate to be in that particular region because when there was a\nfamine in Amsterdam, I think it was in '44, people came for vegetables and potatoes and\nmilk because there was no food to be had in Amsterdam. The only place where you could\nget food was in the farm country. What I remember is--I don't remember a tremendous\namount of hardships or famine, I don't remember doing without. I remember things were\ngood. When I think back how, what it must have been for my parents, its very different.\nLiving with another family, and they moved around a great deal before they found a family\nthat took them in where they felt comfortable. They were with people for about, at least four\nor five different families, and many of the families took in a lot of borders and a lot of them\ntook in Jews and got paid for it. It was very dangerous for a lot of people because they, for\npeople like my parents, so when they felt uncomfortable in a house, when they felt there\nwere people who might talk, and who might divulge that they were Jews, they had to move\non, and they were very fortunate also the last year and a half before the war ended to live\nwith a family, as it turned out, only ten miles from where I was living but unbeknownst to\nme and unbeknownst to them because it wasn't safe for them to know where I was because if\nthey knew they would want to find me, and if I knew I would want to probably find them as\nwell. So that was never spoken about and Cornelia tells me that her family did not know\nwhere my parents were, didn't know my real name, didn't know where I came from. But\nafter the war the family that my parents were with knew where I was living. They had know\nthat; somehow they had found out. But my family lived in very tight quarters. They lived\nwith a couple who had one daughter and in a town not far from Oosterblokker called\nBerkhout. I went, I went back there last year and unfortunately the house is not standing the\nway it was. It's now a garage. It was a very small, humble home and these people shared\nwhatever food they had; they were not farmers, with my mother and father. You know they\ndid the same thing that the Schouten family did, but my mother and father did not, were not\nable to leave the house and go bicycle riding and play outdoors. They had to stay in hiding\nin their house all those years. And it wasn't safe because no one in that neighborhood could\nreally know about them. I think maybe one other couple knew about them, but that was it.\nSo when the war did end and my mother and father came for me, I really didn't want to go\nback with them. Probably it was a combination of being worried that they would leave me\nagain, maybe it was that I had a new family name, I had friends, I was in school, I was\ncomfortable, and it was very difficult for me. I think it was more difficult for me after the\nwar than it was during the war. I just, I Just felt very much alone when I left because I didn't\nhave any friends and my mother and father really didn't know any people anymore in\nAmsterdam. They had no family. My grandfather, we never heard from again. And, so after,\nwhen my parents did come for me, I really didn't want to go with them at all. I claimed that I\ndidn't recognize my father. I had remembered him as very, very tall, and he wasn't all that tall\nand it was a very difficult thing for my mother and father whose only hope and only wish\nwas to be reunited with me. For me not to want to go with them must have been a really\nhorrible thing. I mean, I think back to what would happen in my situation, how it would feel.\nI mean it must have been awful. But I was just a kid, I was seven years old and I was\ninterested in playing and, you know, in my friends. So that's all I could think about.\nSo we went, after the war, my father was able to get his store back, his butcher shop, which\nhad been taken away by the Germans in 1943, when all Jews had to give up any of their\nproperty and any of their belongings and their apartments and whatever they had that\nbelonged to them, they had to give up. But after the war he was able to reclaim his butcher\nshop, which he did, and he worked there for another two years, waiting to get a visa to come\nto America. And the only way we could get that really was through my father's brother who\nwas living in America and he helped us with the formalities of getting to the United States.\nAnd I went back to school in Amsterdam and had a very difficult time in Amsterdam, in the\ncity and the school, and missed the farm a great deal. I remember I was very sad and I was\nvery nervous at night. I remember not sleeping well at all because I was so scared that my\nparents would leave me again or that the Germans would come and I guess I just couldn't\nreally understand the concept of the war and the end of the war, and that it was all over and\nnow I would be with my parents again forever, and I really missed my playmates. I\nremember that very well and, uh, we lived in an apartment that...it's sort of vague to me, but\nit was an apartment that I think while our...while we couldn't get our our original apartment\nback we lived in this, uh, apartment that one of the Germans had lived in during the war who\nwas quite wealthy, and I remember the apartment as being quite luxurious and the kind of a\nplace where you couldn't touch anything and and so different from the farm where, you\nknow, everything was so comfortable and I could just run around and here I felt I had to be\nthis proper lady and everything had to be kept perfectly because the apartment didn't belong\nto us and the furnishings didn't belong to us and nothing really belonged to us and, uh, I just\nfelt uncomfortable, and, uh, I don't remember anything about school. I remember that there\nwas a young boy who I was friendly with who lived in this apartment...uh, it was a\nbrownstone on the Amsteldik in, in Amsterdam. And I remember befriending him and I\nremember being close with him and I remember again then having to come to America and\nbeing uprooted from from him as well, and I don't remember seeing my family, the farm\nfamily, at all after that.\nUh, and I remember when I came to America living in the Bronx with another family\nbecause we didn't have any money and they took us in for about a year and I started to learn\nEnglish and they were very good to us. They had three daughters and one of them took me\nunder her wing and taught me English and, uh, we lived with them in their house for about a\nyear and again, I felt, you know, this sort of constant uprooting and this not knowing where I\nwas really going to be. Will I ever be permanently in any one place and always the fear, you\nknow, of, of leaving but I really had... 1 was eighteen before I went back to Holland again to\nsee the Schoutens and it was very difficult for me. Uh, I was very, very nervous because I\ndidn't speak Dutch anymore. I never kept it up because my parents didn't speak Dutch at\nhome. They spoke only German because their friends were were friends that they had from\nGermany that came over to America before the war and they had a circle of German friends\nand they wanted to forget the war. They wanted to forget the time and so for them, uh, I\nmean Dutch just wasn't a language that was spoken. My mother wanted me to become\nAmericanized as quickly as possible. She wanted me to speak English. I didn't want to speak\nGerman because I hated the language. I hated the Germans. I hated everything that\nrepresented that time. So I didn't, uh, speak German and I didn't speak Dutch and when I\nwent back to Holland when I was eighteen, uh, I wanted to I wanted to, uh, you know, thank\nthese people for the wonderful thing they had done for me and how they had saved my life\nbut I was kind of tongue-tied, you know. I just didn't have the words and I had heard that the\nDutch people really hated, uh, if they hated the Germans and they hated people who spoke\nGerman and while I didn't speak German I I understood German perfectly and when I spoke\nwhatever Dutch I knew, I kept mixing my Dutch and German, and I was really afraid that I\nwas going to offend them that by speaking, you know, Dutch with a, with German mixed in\nand it really took me all these years to realize that they wouldn't care what I spoke. They\nreally had no, you know, uh, I mean it didn't really matter. I think it took me up till last year\nto realize that...that I could have spoken to them in gibberish...1t would have been all right,\nuh, you know, because whatever connection I felt, they must have felt too. So I feel very...I\nfeel very sad that I hadn't kept up a connection with this family all these years. I really, uh,\nonly started thinking about Holland and what I went through again when I was fifty last year,\nand that's when I felt that I had to go back and make a connection again, even though the\nparents that, uh, kept me were no longer alive, uh, and the only real connection that I felt that\nI had there was Cornelia and, uh, again the problem of the language, but luckily there were\nmany people in Holland that spoke Dut...uh, English that were able to interpret for me so\nwhen I went back to see Cornelia last year, 1t was a very short visit\nbecause again I felt like it would be very uncomfortable not being able to speak the\nlanguage, uh, but it, you know, gave me time from last year to this year to think about what\nthese people had done and to what it means, uh, not only to me but I think to to my children,\nto my family, to my friends...uh, that they have risked their lives at a time when it was very\ndangerous to go against what was told to them to do which was that all the Jews were being\nrounded up and and they must, you know, follow the dictum of the government of Germany\nwhich had occupied Holland at that time, and I really feel that for people to do what they did\nwithout any, uh, I mean to them what they did was what they feel every human being should\ndo. They really feel that it was nothing. They feel like what they did was only the nght thing,\nthat it's not something unusual for them and when I think about how, when I think back now\nwhat I would have done, I don't think I would have done the same thing. I think that if I had\na family and if there was a threat that my family might be killed or 1f my family would, uh,\nbe hurt or that I might be, I don't think I could have made that decision and now I will think\ndifferently because I lived through that, but I, I hope that people don't have to live through\nthat to make the decision to help another human being, to save another human being, and,\nuh, so that's why I think it's so important, you know, people like this, uh, talk about their\nexperiences so that other young people and our children and, uh, my friends\u2019 children and\nfuture generations will think about what it is to do the right thing and what it is to save\nhuman life and what it 1s to risk your own life, and that's I guess all I can say.\n"
