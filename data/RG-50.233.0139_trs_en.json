        "URBACH, Solomon (also called Rumak and Schomek)\nRG-50.233*0139\nApril 8, 1992\nAbstract",
        "Solomon Urbach was born in Kalwaria-Zebrzydowska in Poland in 1926. His parents and their\nsix children lived in Romania from 1928 until 1933, when the Romanian government expelled\nthem as non-Romanian citizens. The family was imprisoned across the border in Poland until a\nPolish family got them released.\nThe Urbachs settled near Krakow in Borek Falecki. Due to anti-Semitism at the school across\nfrom their home, Sol and his siblings had to walk four kilometers to and from a Krakow school\nwith only Jewish children. Polish Christian children threw rocks at them along the route they\nfollowed for six years. His family remained in Borek Falecki long after Germans invaded and\nordered them to enter the Krakow ghetto. But in 1942, neighbors threatened to report them, so the\nfamily sneaked into the Krakow ghetto to avoid punishment for not reporting themselves.\nOskar Schindler entered the ghetto and selected Solomon and a friend out of 100 others to work\nat his factory making pots and pans. Schindler factory workers, who stayed there several nights in\nMarch 1943 when the Krakow ghetto was liquidated, were the only survivors of the ghetto, as\nwell as the camp he and others were taken to, Krakow Plaszow. At Plaszow, he saw Amon Goeth\nand other SS men shoot or lynch inmates. Solomon continues to search for family members, but\nfound none who survived, and found only one friend after the war.\nHe got to know Schindler \u201cfairly well\u2019. Solomon was among 1,000 workers who moved into the\nconcentration camp Schindler built near the business. \u201cI was kind of happy to be there.\u201d In\nSeptember 1944, Schindler was ordered to liquidate the concentration camp and ship inmates\nback to the Plaszow concentration camp. In October 1944, that camp was liquidated as Russian\ntroops approached, and inmates were sent to Gross-Rosen. Soon they were sent on an eight-day\ntrain journey into Czechoslovakia, where Schindler had been given a textile factory. Solomon did\nwoodworking there and in Schindler\u2019s villa. Solomon stole food from a mill and elsewhere, and\ndistributed it to inmates.\nJust after the Russians liberated the camp May 8, Shindler opened his warehouses of food and\nother material, and told the freed inmates to take whatever they wished. Solomon and 16 others\nheaded toward Krakow, where he arrived three or four weeks later.",
        "He felt staying in Poland was not safe, so he settled in Bomberg, Germany, until emigrating to the\nUnited States in 1949.\nSolomon saw Schindler again in Munich, and years later in 1973 in Israel. Schindler greeted him\nwarmly, and called him Rumak, the name Solomon had been known by. Solomon says the\nmystery of Schindler\u2019s list continues.",
        "Tape I, Side A\nToday is April 8, 1992. Iam Anthony Dilorio and I am in Flemington, New Jersey. I am here on\nbehalf of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington to interview Mr.\nSolomon Urbach about his experiences during the Holocaust. Good morning.\nGood morning. I am facing a difficult task because I have to organize my thoughts and go back\ninto a difficult perlod\u2014bringing me back to pre-war, pre-World War II and the World War II\nexperiences in different concentration camps. I'll do my best.\nWhere were you born?\nI was born in Kalwaria-Zebrzydowska in Poland in October 25, 1926.\nHow many brothers and sisters did you have?\nWe were\u2014our family was four brothers, two sisters, father and mother. My oldest brother\u2019s\nname was Samuel, next to him was Rivka, then I would be the next in line, Sol Urbach. After\nthat there was Chona, the sister younger than I am and my next younger brother was Haskel and\nthe youngest brother was Szymon.\nWhat was it like growing up in Kalvaria?\nThe time of Kalvaria, as a very young person, I don\u2019t remember other than later on returning on\nvisits. I remember my youth when I spent some time in Romania, five years, where I was\nattending Talmud Torah and attending first grade of public school. Then I remember traveling\nback with my family to Krakow, Poland where we grew up outside of Krakow, an area known as\nBorek Falecki. Those were the years in Borek Falecki, I spent the years of 1933 to 1939. After\n1939, when the Germans already marched in, we continued living in Borek Falecki and even\nwent on living in Borek Falecki past the time when the Germans ordered us to report to a ghetto\nin Krakow which we managed to stay away from for one full year until the situation got very\ndifficult where the Polish neighbors would tell us that they no longer would be able to keep quiet\nabout us being outside of the ghetto and we better leave the town and report to the ghetto. So in\n1942, early 1942, we\u2014the whole family, as a unit, that means father and mother and six children,\nwent on and reported to the ghetto; or smuggled ourselves into the ghetto because we were no\nlonger legally able to turn ourselves into the ghetto.\nYou mentioned that your family moved to Romania when you were young. Was there any\nparticular reason why?",
        "It was because my mother\u2019s brother lived in Romania and was doing real well. Was able to\nsupport his family better than my parents were able to do in Poland. So they had influence my\nparents to move to Romania where things would be easier. Eventually what happened really is\nthat we spent there from 1928 to 1933 in Romania and the Romanian government has expelled us\nas a family. We were not welcome in Romania, the Polish citizens not having a Romanian\ncitizenship\u2014they eventually got to us and expelled us. I remember vividly where the Romanian\nauthorities brought us to the border of Poland and Romania and sent us across the border. Across\nthe border in Poland, the Polish authorities immediately threw us into jail as a family and I\nremember vividly the jail on the Polish side were the family of eight of us, six young children and\nparents, were sitting in a jail cell with a high window above like any criminal. Actually what\nhappened 1s, we returned to Poland where we were supposedly citizens. And it was through the\ngood graces of some Polish residents in the area on the Polish side discovered that there was a\nJewish family in jail, that they were able to influence and release us from jail.\nSo your first experience in prison and you were only seven years old. And you were imprisoned\nby Poles after being expelled by Romanians?\nRight.\nSo you lived briefly in Romania and then, of course, you lived in Poland. How would you\ndescribe the ways in which Jews were treated in each country? Was it worse or better in one\ncountry versus the other?\nI could not make a great comparison of the Jews and their conditions of living in different\ncountries. But in my own country, in Poland, after returning from Romania, I remember that I\nhad to walk\u2014when I say I with my other brothers or sisters who already went to school at that\ntime\u2014we went from Borek Falecki to ... We walked four kilometers daily to a school in the\ncenter of Krakow which was known as Mikawaraya, (ph) (c. 78) No. 14 Public School. This\nwas\u2014lI did that for six years, walking the four kilometers daily to that school. The reason for that\nwas while there was a school directly across from my home in Borek Falecki, this was a non-\nJewish school and I would have suffered greatly. Because at that time I didn\u2019t speak the language\nand generally there was an anti-Semitic feeling. So we couldn\u2019t attend that school, so we walked\nfour kilometers to a school in the middle of Krakow which had a total Jewish student body. So\nthis was a...\nSo this was a Jewish school?",
        "It had non-Jewish teachers and it was a regular public school but it was composed of only Jewish\nstudents, as far as I remember. The walking to that school had to be done rain or shine, good\nweather, bad weather, winter or summer. We would also have an encounter on a daily basis\u2014\nrock throwing at us by Polish Christian kids who somehow knew that there were the Jewish kids\nwalking. Or even if I was alone, they still would know it and we had to go through at times, a\nhail of rock-throwers to get to our school. But we did that for six years as far as I remember.\nWere you the only one in your family who went to this school? Did any of your brothers or\nsisters?\nOne brother and one sister went to the same school with me. The others probably were too young\nto attend any school at that time.\nThis would be Rivka and Samuel?\nRight.\nYou also attended one year of school in Romania?\nI attended the first grade in Romania. After arriving in Poland, the Polish authorities, school\nauthorities have told us that I would have to repeat the first grade in Poland. So as a result of it, I\nrepeated the first grade in Krakow, Poland.\nDid you have similar experiences when you went to school in Romania? That is rock throwing,\nor restrictions on Jewish ... ?\nAbout the Romanian experiences as far as being Jewish, I could not say much. I don\u2019t remember\nwhat happened there about the rock throwers or not. But chances are they were not really as bad\nin Romania. Otherwise I would have been left with some memories of that time.\nHow would you describe your family\u2019s religious life?",
        "We were an observant family, religiously speaking. My father was at times, a cantor, conducting\nservices for others. I would at times be his helper but we were obviously not religious enough for\nour grandfather to be comfortable in our home and approve of our religious behavior.\nWas this Grandfather Urbach?\nThis was Grandfather Baldinger.\nBaldinger. Did you live with your grandparents in the same house?\nAt the earlier stage of our life\u2014my mother came from Kalvaria and therefore we lived, at that\ntime, with my grandfather in Kalvaria.\nBut after you moved to Romania, you no longer lived with him?\nNo, in Romania, we were not living with any other family member other than the eight of us.\nThe same when we came back to Poland.\nWhat kind of home did you live in when you lived in Borek?\nIn Borek Falecki we lived in a rundown home, actually, where the eight of us in the family lived\nin two rooms. We lived there for the duration of 1933 to 1942 under these living conditions, was\ntwo rooms. My father was a tailor and hardly made a living. Food was certainly greatly\nappreciated when it was there. Holidays were observed. We managed to go to public school as\nwell as to religious schools but we all appreciated food all the time; it was not plentiful at all.\nSo times were tough economically.\nEconomically, times were tough as far back as I remember. We never had it very good where we\ncould move out into different living quarters. We had to stay there. This was our life up to 1942.\nDid your father work for someone else?",
        "No, he was a tailor and he worked for himself.\nAt home?\nAt home. So the shop ...\nHe had a shop in the house?\nRight in the house. The shop consisted of a sewing machine and lots of threads and needles and\nthat was his shop.\nDid your mother have time other than raising such a large family to also work?\nNo. My mother was not working outside of the home. She was totally preoccupied with the\nraising of the six children.\nWhat languages did your family use?\nWhen we returned from Romania, we all spoke Romanian\u2014those children who were already old\nenough to speak the language, spoke Romanian. I spoke Romanian and I did not speak a word of\nPolish. When we came into Poland, our language at home was Yiddish but we also spoke\nRomanian. When we arrived in Poland, the school authorities advised us that the best thing\nwould be if the language at home became Polish rather than Yiddish to help us get along a little\nfaster and learn the language. By doing that, one year later, I remember myself speaking Polish\nand almost totally forgetting the Romanian language.\nYour parents, though, they mainly spoke in Yiddish?\nMy parents spoke Yiddish amongst themselves and the whole family spoke Yiddish. Yiddish\nwas the language.\nYour father also knew Polish?",
        "My father, mother spoke Polish but used the\u2014the majority of times they were speaking Yiddish.\nWhat about your father\u2019s customers? What kind of customers did he have?\nThe customers for the tailoring were coming from the Jewish community, from friends and\nneighbors.\nWhat kind of schooling, would you know what kind of schooling your parents had?\nI have no recollection, no knowledge of what schooling my parents had.\nDo you recall whether or not your father\u2019s business was affected in the 1930s by any laws that\nwere being passed by the Polish government?\nMy memories bring me back to the 1930s, \u201933, which coincides with the rise of Hitler in\nGermany. Also at that time, this was not too much on my mind, Hitler\u2019s rise to power. But the\nanti-Semitic situation just was getting stronger and stronger and life was a little more difficult as\nthe years went by, up to the war and into the war. I remember vividly that my father who had a\n(c. 175) beard, had to get outside into the wall to see customers or walk the streets,",
        "he would take him a pair of scissors and carry them in his pocket. That was not meant to be there\nfor his need in the trade but it was in case of an attack by anti-Semites; he would have a way of\ndefending himself. That remains in my memory that he took the scissors and put them away\ncarefully, if he ever needed them.\nSo anti-Semitism was getting stronger?\nAntisemitism was getting stronger and stronger every year since 1933, which was about the time\nwe arrived from Romania to Poland.\nDid your family, your parents, mainly, did they ever talk about Hitler, the Nazis?",
        "I have no memories of strong talk about the Nazis, about Hitler in my childhood. Also towards\n1938, \u00b039, I remember the great concern and reading papers. I did not read the papers but the\nadults did and listening to the radio where Poland was raving about its strong army and its ability\nto defend itself if attacked by the Germans.\nSo you were aware that there was a danger of war?\nThere was a danger of war\u2014it was in the air as the years got closer to 1939 but I could not say\nthat I had any great idea what it meant to me, myself. The Polish authorities kept on hammering\naway that they are able to withstand any attacks that would come from Germany and so there was\nno great concern really.\nDid your parents ever talk about or consider the possibility of emigrating, of leaving?\nNo, we had no conversations in our house that I would have remembered about immigrating to\nany place. Of course, if we were going to do that when we were in Romania, this was the time to\ngo towards Palestine as opposed to going to Poland. I don\u2019t know whether my parents had this\noption, whether they had the means to do these things. They simply returned from Romania to\nPoland.\nWould you know why your parents chose to move to Borek? After the return? After you got out\nof prison?\nYeah. The reason we returned to Borek Falecki is because we could not afford any housing in the\ncity of Krakow and in fact we needed assistance to be able to afford any housing in Borek\nFalecki.\nYour parents had never lived there so the goal was to move to Krakow or as close to Krakow as\npossible?\nYes, the goal was to somehow get to Krakow and that\u2019s as close as we could get to it, Borek\nFalecki, only because the economical means were not there.\nNow, what were you doing on the day that the war began?",
        "September 1, 1939, the war broke out. As I recall it, it was in two or three days, the Germans\nwere in Krakow. I remember going out with other children to greet the Germans, to get close to\nthe tanks and to the trucks and shake hands and everybody was jovial. There was no fear because\nas the war approached, the conversation at home was that the Germans are a more civil people\nthan the Poles and actually there wasn\u2019t much to fear. So from what I remember from my\nparents\u2019 conversation, we were just free to go and shake the hands of this more civil people, the\nGermans. They would occasionally hand out some food to us in those early days. Confusion was\nrampant. My parents, along with other people, did not even know whether those soldiers that are\nnow arriving in the first days and now are stationed at the bridges\u2014whether they were Germans\nin fact, or whether they were English soldiers. We heard so much about the English coming in\nand protecting us that we, on the day when they arrived and controlled the bridges and all this, we\nhad to go out and take a look and find out whether those were Germans or English. We\ndiscovered they were Germans. Which at that time made no difference to us because we\nexpected maybe better things as opposed to the catastrophes that were waiting for us.\nSo at first, they behaved decently?\nIn the very first days, the group of soldiers we ran into behaved decently and handed out food and\ntalked to us and laughed and we all laughed.\nAnd there was no destruction, no combat?\nNo, no destruction other than the war was affecting us because now the total civil population did\nnot know what to do with themselves. Whether to remain home, the bombers were coming over\nPoland, over our area and we did not know because of total confusion in Polish authorities as to\nwhat is best to do\u2014to stay home or not to stay home. Or go\u2014where would you go and all that?\nSo we actually, as a family, undertook to go towards the city of Krakow. What sense that made, I\ncan\u2019t tell and it probably didn\u2019t make any sense but we walked towards the city of Krakow in the\nunit of eight members in our family along with many, many thousands of other families. While\nwalking towards the city of Krakow, we walked in the hail of bombs that were falling on the\nroads and streets. We somehow managed to get to Krakow eventually. Then only to discover\nthat that was not a safer place and then return back to Borek Faleck1.\nHow about school? Was school open that year?",
        "The school was totally interrupted. There was no longer\u2014this was when the war broke out\u2014was\nprobably vacation time and the schools never accepted Jewish children after that. So my\nschooling was interrupted in 1939, the religious school was also closed so essentially there was\nno schooling at all from September of 1939.\nSo even your school which was mostly, entirely Jewish students, that was closed?\nThat was closed because there were Jewish students and there was no schooling at all. It was all\ninterrupted, everything was in chaos. Jewish children did not have any schools to enter.\nHow long did the German behavior remain civil?\nVery short. The civil behavior was disappearing as they settled down in the city and began to\ngive orders on what Jews can and what Jews cannot do. It was not much later than entering into\n1940 already where there were certain sections of the city off limits to Jews and we could not\nwalk into it on certain streets. Later on, the orders came out again that all Jews walking anyplace\nwould have to wear an armband. As the war went on, in 1941, possibly no Jews were allowed to\nwalk anyplace unless they had business and they would be identified by some armband that\nwould tell whether they work in an industry that is important. I remember that my older brother\nwore an armband with an R. I can\u2019t even remember where he worked, but evidently he did work\nin some important industry.\nIn Krakow?\nIn Krakow.\nThis would have been after the ghetto?\nNo, this was before the ghetto opened. This was in 1940 and \u201941. My father was limited in his\nability to walk the streets from the earlier days because of his beard and his appearance and the\nneighbors\u2019 knowledge that he was Jewish. So he was sort of limited. My mother undertook the\nduties of providing for the family as soon as the war broke out. By appearing Christian, she was\nable to still travel on trains and to go into villages and return home with some provisions, eggs\nand flour and other things that would be necessary to survive. The children were also expected\nfrom the first day on, each child that was already grown up, maybe 12 to 13, to get into lines and",
        "stand on lines, potentially a full night into the day and see if they could buy a bread or other\nprovisions that we needed, coal, kerosene. So each child would have the duty of getting in line. I\nremember myself standing on many occasions on cold nights, winter nights, waiting for bread,\nand when finally the bakery opened and I got to the head of the line, the bread ran out and I\nreturned home without tt.\nWas your brother, Samuel, the only one who worked in a factory during these times?\nAs far as I remember he had the only armband with an R on it. The rest of us were unemployed.\nMy father was still able to do tailoring at home and got some paid for that but life was\napproaching the unbearable.\nWere Germans present in Borek?\nIn Borek Falecki which was about four kilometers outside of the city, there were Germans but not\nin large groups. They were in the city offices and managing the affairs of everything but they\nwere not in great masses there as soldiers.\nSo it was relatively safer to live in Borek?\nIt was relatively safer there and that is what led us to believe, that when the order finally came for\nus to report to the ghetto that we could survive somehow and maybe wait out the war by living in\nBorek Falecki without reporting to the ghetto. Always hoping that the war will be over any day.\nDo you remember when this order came to report to the ghetto?\nThe order to report to the ghetto would have been in 1941, middle of 1941. We did not report\nuntil close to the middle of 1942.\nYou were in civil disobedience in the Urbach family?\nWe certainly were. In fact, when the\u2014when my family finally made the decision to enter the\nghetto, to smuggle ourselves in, a decision was also made that I could potentially stay away and\nnot report to the ghetto, which I did temporarily. A Polish employer of mine at that time, where I\nbegan to work as a cabinet maker. Because I had lots of idle time, I began to observe the cabinet",
        "maker\u2019s shop and I was there often enough to begin to learn the trade. I was finally employed by\nthis Pole by the name of Kaminski (c. 3343).\nWas this in Borek?\nIn Borek Falecki. That led me to an employment with him. So when my family decided to enter\nthe ghetto, he promised that he could help me stay out of the ghetto and he allowed me to stay\nover in his shop and sleep in his shop. I can\u2019t say whether I asked for it or he volunteered, at this\npoint, but I did stay over for a number of nights and days continuing work in this furniture-\nmaking shop and staying into the night and sleeping at night. But the situation got to be\nunbearable. I was dying of fear at night, sleeping in this shop of wood and tools, all alone in a\nlarge shop. Being the youngster I was, I was simply dying of fear. I saw shadows walking\naround, I saw people knocking, I heard people knocking on the doors which was all not true but\nthe fear was so great that I could not survive there. Eventually I joined my family in the ghetto.\nSo you did not go with the entire family when they went to the ghetto? You went in after a few\ndays?\nA few days, yeah.\nWhat were your brothers and sisters doing in Borek before they went to the ghetto\u2014besides\ngetting on lines and trying to get food and so forth?\nThe only one that was employed would have been my oldest brother, Samuel. All the other\nchildren simply tried to help out at home and do whatever they could in order to bring in some\nfood to the house, bring in some coal, bring in some kerosene. I remember getting to the railroad\nstation and how that was done is unbelievable to me at this point but we somehow managed with\nsome neighbors potentially to get on railroad cars which were transporting coal from Poland to\nsomeplace all during the German occupation. We somehow managed to get on these coal trains\nand throw off enough coal and gather it up into burlap bags and bring it home so we would have\nsome fuel. Odd as it sounds, that\u2019s how it was.\nDo you remember what prompted your parents to go to the ghetto at that particular time?",
        "The situation that made my family rethink their status outside of the ghetto came from neighbors\nwe had known for years before the war that said the situation is getting real bad. That they no\nlonger could keep quiet and not to report us because this was already a crime on their part, not\nreport that any Jews lived outside of the ghetto. So they advised us, some of those that were\nfriendly with our family, advised us to somehow get out of there before things get real bad.\nSo it\u2019s fear of your neighbors who themselves were afraid of the Germans?\nThat\u2019s correct. It was not any direct order or roundup by the Germans that made us go to the\nghetto. It was fear and the stories that were told to us by the Polish neighbors.\nWhereas the initial order, the year before, to go to the ghetto, that was from the Germans?\nThe initial to report to the ghetto was from the Germans and that would have been pasted\u2014\nnotices were pasted on the kiosks and on some walls. This was an official report that we simply\ntake what we can carry with us and report to the ghetto. If we did that at that time, we would\nhave to begin our march much earlier than we eventually did by hiding out.\nWere there other Jewish families that ignored the order in 1941?\nI am not aware of anyone\u2014any other Jewish families in my area. Also it could very well have\nbeen but I don\u2019t remember that.\nWhat do you remember taking with you when you went into the Krakow ghetto?\nWhen we finally reported to the Krakow ghetto, what we were able to gather at home and I can\u2019t\nsay that we had very much at home so we did not have very much to carry with us. We were not\nburdened by any extra large amounts of clothing or valuables and we simply had just a small\nbundle of things that we took with us.\nOf course, the family had no idea where they would be staying when they went to Krakow? Did\nyou have a particular address in mind?",
        "When we went already, we went to the ghetto, when we finally reported to the ghetto. Then we\nbecame subject to what the authorities\u2014that would potentially be the Jewish authorities inside\nthe ghetto\u2014would assign to us as our living quarters in the ghetto.\nDo you remember how your father managed after smuggling the family into the ghetto, how he\nmanaged to explain to them that he needed accommodations? After all, he had to pretend that he\nhad been there all along, right?\nWell, I don\u2019t know whether he had to pretend that\u2014whether he did not fall into a category of\nother people returning to the ghetto at a later date. There is a good chance that there were other\nsimilar situations. But the problem that we experienced at that time 1s that we would simply be at\nthe end of the line in receiving housing. A room in a basement was assigned to us for all eight of\nus.\nWhat was it like, living in the ghetto?\nIn the ghetto, was a total idleness on the part of all the family members other than on different\ndays. Different member members of my family along with others, would be rounded up for\u2014by\nthe Germans. The Germans would come into the ghetto and round up people and take them away\nfor a daily work outside of the ghetto. This would have been to clean streets, to unload coal\nunder German supervision, to do any kind of jobs that suited the Germans and then returning to\nthe ghetto. On many of those occasions, some of those people that were rounded up and taken\nout to work, people did not return. This was simply instilling greater fear in us that one of our\nfamily members might also be subject to the same thing. But my family members did manage to\nreturn whenever they worked outside of the ghetto, they came back to the ghetto. On one of\nthose roundups that I was speaking about, I was outside of my building when two small trucks\nwith Germans arrived in front of our building almost and simply grabbed anyone they could lay\ntheir hands on and pushed them into the two trucks. This would have been towards the end of\n1942. They delivered us to what I later on found out to be the Schindler factory which was an\nenamel works factory, making pots and pans. They simply delivered us to that camp. I\nremember Oskar Schindler being there when the Germans delivered us to his yard, adjoining the\nfactory. There we were lined up for Schindler\u2019s inspection. Schindler looked us over and we\nwere there in a group of potentially 100 people and took two of us out of the line. That was\nmyself and I remember another friend of mine by the name of Goodhurtz (ph) (c.496) who was\npulled out of those 100. Schindler said to the Germans that he does not need any children. I still\nremember it in German, \u201cIsh brout kine kinder\u201d (ph) (c.500). The Germans in those days did not\nknow much about Oskar Schindler. He wasn\u2019t very important at that time to them because I\nremember them snapping back to Schindler, you will keep what we delivered. They departed and",
        "we became employees of the Oskar Schindler industrial complex which was at that time, making\nonly pots and pans and peddling those to the Polish citizenry.\nThis was when, when did you first ... ?\nEnd of 1942.\nAnd you mentioned that the Germans would round up people to work on the streets. Did any of\nyour brothers and sisters get ... ?\nYeah, my father, my older sister and brother all wound up working on occasion in different duties\noutside of the ghetto. And then returned to the ghetto at the end of the day. Similarly when I was\nrounded up and delivered to Oskar Schindler\u2019s factory outside of Krakow for a\u2014the next few\nmonths we were simply marched out daily. The group of 100 was marched out daily under the\nsupervision of SS guards, fixed bayonets. We were marched out of the ghetto in Krakow and\nwalked towards the factory which was operated by Oskar Schindler. I don\u2019t know exactly the\ndistance but it seems like a half hour to one hour walk from the ghetto. This was done daily, we\nwere delivered there. In the evening we reported back. Later on, we also broke up into shifts,\nwhere some of us worked nights and some of us worked days. I happened to wind up on a shift\nworking at night at Oskar Schindler\u2019s.\nSo you would sleep in the ghetto during the day?\nI would try to sleep during the day which was next to impossible because we were in such living\nquarters that the noise level and the activities simply did not permit me. This was one room.\nWhat really was happening on many occasions, I was so tired and exhausted that I remember\nmyself falling asleep while standing and working on a press in the factory of Oskar Schindler?\nOr falling asleep trying to feed the pots and pans into the ovens, out of total exhaustion, a lack of\nsleep.\nWhat did you get in return for your work?\nThere was no pay involved. We were fed there, at Oskar Schindler\u2019s. There was no pay\ninvolved.",
        "What kind of food did they give you?\nThere was a\u2014as far as I remember, there was a soup during the day. All the other food we would\nreceive in the ghetto when we returned home.\nWould they give you a ration card?\nThere was some method of rationing. I don\u2019t remember exactly how the food was received in the\nghetto but there was some food received by way of ration cards.\nHow did the rest of your family get food?\nThey lived on what was available in the ghetto. There was no other source. There was no\navailability [?]. The two older members and my father were possibly receiving some food\noutside of the ghetto. In earlier days, there was still some trading inside of the ghetto where you\ncould do some work and receive food in return. So we managed to eat and survive in the ghetto\nfor the next few months.\nHow long did this go on?\nThis existence in the ghetto, to me it appeared like a giant waiting room. I just, you know,\neverybody was waiting for something to happen. We didn\u2019t know exactly what was supposed to\nbe happening but we always hoped that maybe the war will end and everything will turn out all\nright. But in March, potentially March 10 or 11, while working at Oskar Schindler\u2019s night shift, I\nwas\u2014lI along with the rest of my group, were ordered to stay at the factory of Oskar Schindler\nand not to return to the ghetto. Because Schindler had discovered that there was an action going\non at the ghetto, as the Germans would call it, an action (ph) (c. 605) whereby there was a\ninformation by way of Oskar Schindler who brought this information back to us\nin the factory but he did not permit it ... (pause in tape).\nTape I, Side B",
        "This is March 1943?",
        "March 1943, it\u2019s the 10\", 11\", 12\". We stayed over at the factory, Oskar Schindler\u2019s factory\nbeing fully aware of it\u2014that the ghetto is being liquidated. I personally being fully aware of it\u2014\nthat my whole family is in the ghetto and not knowing what is happening to them. The Krakow\nghetto was stilled totally and after the three nights were over, where we stayed over at the Oskar\nSchindler factory, we were marched back into\u2014no longer to the ghetto but we were marched into\na concentration camp outside of Krakow known as Krakow Plaszow. A full-fledged\nconcentration camp with barbed wires, watch towers, lots of busy SS people all over the place,\ntotally fearsome place. I came into this camp as a youngster not knowing at all where the rest of\nmy family is and being assigned to a barrack with lots of people, sleeping one next to the other on\nthree rows high of berth or with some straw on it. During the next few days, I was assigned to\nwork in a stone quarry. I worked there four days, received some soup during the day. At the\nsame time, while I was in that concentration camp, my beginning in that concentration camp,\ntrucks were still arriving from, what was then rumored in the camp, as those that were killed in\nthe liquidation of the Krakow ghetto. Trucks were arriving with bodies into our concentration\ncamp, into prepared open pits. The dump trucks were dumping the bodies and returning for more\nloads to clean up the ghetto. It did enter my mind that possibly my family, brothers, sisters,\nparents were among those that were buried in that camp but it was also rumored that some people\nsurvived by being shipped to other camps. So I was not fully aware of what could have possibly\nhappened to my family. One of the\u2014word got to me from one person that arrived back from the\nghetto into the concentration camp that he saw my brother trying to run from one line that he was\nin to join his family and he was shot on the spot in the Krakow ghetto liquidation. But other than\nthis word and whether this could have been relied totally upon, I don\u2019t know, but that was the\nonly word I got from someone that supposedly saw my brother being shot, died right there. The\nrest of the family I had no knowledge at all.\nWhich brother would this have been?\nSamuel was the one that would have been shot by trying to join the rest of his family. I remained\nin the Plaszow concentration camp for a number of weeks, observing hangings, standing on the\nappel plotz during inspection time which I recall as being every day during which time Goeth\n(Amon? c. 657) and some of his cohorts were marching through the potentially 30,000 people\nstanding outdoors for inspection. You could actually hear a pin drop because no one dared\nbreathe at that time when this inspection was going on. Was total silence, total fear. Everybody\nstanding numb, totally numb, not being able to speak to one another. Because while we were\nstanding on the appel plotz, we were fully aware of the fact that Amon Goeth (c. 664) who was\nthe head of the concentration camp, the SS head of the concentration camp, was marching\nthrough those lines with his cohorts. For no apparent reason would shoot certain people and they\nwould fall as he walked by. At other times, there were lynchings going on while we all stood\nthere and observed. All this was done to instill more fear into us and it was certainly\naccomplished. We simply lived in daily fear.",
        "Did you still wear your clothes that you had with you when you had first gone to Schindler or\nwere you given prison garb?\nUpon arrival at Krakow Plaszow Camp, we did not receive any prison garb, any clothing. I don\u2019t\nrecall wearing any unusual clothing at that camp because as it turned out to be, I was not a long-\nterm inmate of this concentration camp. After a few weeks\u2019 stay there and working at the stone\nquarry, the group of people that was once employed by Oskar Schindler was eventually marched\nout daily again from this concentration camp and we were returned to work at Oskar Schindler\u2019s\nfactory, the enamel factory. So we would march out daily. Then again upon return, we would\nrejoin our people standing on the appel plotz, be subject to nightly attacks by Germans coming\ninto our barracks to take out some people for some unusual work. But basically the work outside\nof the concentration camp at the factory was working on presses, steel presses, that is, to punch\nout the pots and pans. Eventually, I was shifted into some cabinet work, wood-working shop\nbecause of my previous experience of working in a furniture shop. This led me into some wood-\nworking position in the Oskar Schindler factory. Eventually I began to be in charge of providing\nall the blackout shades for the offices of Oskar Schindler. It was in those duties I entered Oskar\nSchindler\u2019s office on many occasions with the purpose of seeing that the blackout shades were in\nproper order, working order, or replacing them. I would get to know Schindler fairly well and on\noccasion he would even speak to me and express some hope that this will maybe end one day.\nOn those trips I would also observe, those trips to the office of Oskar Schindler, I would observe\nthat one of our inmates, a fellow by the name of Banker, would be sitting in an office adjoining\nOskar Schindler. Banker was the former owner of this factory and some place along the line,\nOskar Schindler discovered that he could not conduct business with the Polish population. The\nonly way to be able to sell the pots and pans which we were still manufacturing in great numbers,\nwas to have this Banker sit in back of his office and conduct business with the Polish population.\nThis is how the wares were sold.\nSo this is the former owner of the factory, now being asked to help the new owner of the factory\nmake profit?\nThat\u2019s right. The former owner of the factory, the Jewish owner of the factory was brought back\nto\u2014he was one of the earlier members that was brought back to work there because Oskar\nSchindler recognized that he needs him to run the business. There was potentially another owner\nin that wisk (ph) (c. 720), Anchor (c. 719) whose first name I don\u2019t remember any more. But I\ndon\u2019t remember the other people involved, I only remember Banker.\nWould you know when Banker lost his factory?",
        "With the\u2014as soon as the Germans got settled in Krakow, they took away this factory from all\nJewish proprietors. They took his factory away from him. As far as I know, they took this\nfactory and gave it to Oskar Schindler as a gift to him for his previous contributions to the Nazi\nparty or to the Nazi effort. And Oskar Schindler got this gift but didn\u2019t know exactly what to do\nwith it but to bring back the former owner or owners to help him run this factory and sell the\nwares that he was producing.\nWhat was Mr. Schindler like?\nOskar Schindler was a very impressive young man, tall, handsome. In the earlier days, I\nremember Oskar Schindler actually still doing some work. I remember observing him one time\nwhen he was doing some woodwork on a machine. But then in later days, he became an\nindustrialist and would travel in company of very important people from Berlin. Bringing in\npeople from Berlin to show them what he is doing here and what the future plans are, developing\nthis seemingly unimportant complex into a factory that would produce materials for the war\neffort. Many times there were very important engineers, with very important high ranking\nofficers arriving and he would take them through inspections showing them what can be done in\nthis place. Eventually it was materialized whereby he received monies from someplace to\ndevelop this factory. He built a big office building and eventually plans were developed to build\na giant hangar-like building or a big factory building. In which rumors were that there were some\nparts of bullets, the ...\nCasings?\nCasings to bullets of different types would be pressed out there and this would be his contribution\nagain to the war effort. This work at the factory continued, for how long, I could no longer be\nsure of, but we were marched out daily, as I said before, from the concentration camp. On those\ndaily marches from the concentration camps, most of the times we were ordered by the SS guards\nin the concentration camp to pick up a rock near our barracks and carry it until we got to the gate.\nThen upon return from work, we would take the same rocks and bring it back from the gate of the\nconcentration camp to a pile near the barracks. This was simply to load us up and make us feel\nlike inmates rather than free people. But we did not carry any rocks, we were simply guarded by\nSS people on the march from the gate to the factory. This went on for a long time potentially into\nthe end of 1943. This type of work and daily marching out until one day at the end of 1943 or\nmaybe beginning of 1944, already, an English spy plane\u2014I have to back off here. I skipped a\npart and that is the part where at one point in time, Schindler was given permission to build his\nown concentration camp. Somehow received permission from Berlin to build his own\nconcentration camp on the grounds of the factory. Towards the end of 1943, he actually\nestablished barracks, built barracks and also was told that he can no longer employ 100 people.",
        "That the concentration camps that would be permitted on his grounds would have a minimum of\n1,000 people. In that connection, as I mentioned before, his grandiose plans to build this\narmament-producing factory was already on the drawing boards and some buildings began to be\nconstructed. Eventually, Oskar Schindler pulled off the shipment of 1,000 inmates including\nourselves, the original 100 people in the group. We were housed now in a concentration camp\nadjoining the enamel factory ran and operated by Oskar Schindler. These camps\u2014these barracks\nas I remember were in two rows, potentially six barracks on a very small site were our housing\naccommodations and life became much more bearable. Oskar Schindler would be amongst us.\nIn fact, I recall when these barracks were being built, the barbed wire going around the camp,\nwatchtowers being constructed, I remember one conversation with a group of inmates and Oskar\nSchindler in which Oskar Schindler described to us the need for the barbed wires and the\nwatchtowers because it was going to be so good in this camp that some people from the outside\nwould try to come into this camp. Nevertheless, the watchtowers went up and barbed wires\nbecause he obviously had to meet specifications to operate or to have the privilege of having the\n1,000 slave laborers working for his effort that he was going to put on for the Third Reich. We\nwere housed there and worked there so it was no big deal walking out of the concentration camp\nthrough a gate and walking into the factory which was totally adjoining. Worked as many hours\nas the factory operated, as needed and then returned back to our concentration camp, which was a\nbearable place really because there was no one dying there anymore. Nobody was being killed in\nthat concentration camp. I recall many ordinary illnesses afflicting people potentially dying but\nnot because of any hangings or lynchings or abuse by the Germans. The Oskar Schindler\ninfluence was all over the lot and the SS guards watching us could not abuse us as much as they\ndid in the Krakow Plaszow camp or in the ghetto.\nHow were the 1,000 selected, the 1,000 inmates?\nI have absolutely no knowledge on how they were selected but they came in different transports.\nAt that time, they were still outlying small ghettos like Skarzysko and Wieliczka, small ghettos of\npeople where the ghettos were liquidated. Some of those shipments from the people surviving\nthose liquidations came into our camp and potentially some of them came from the Krakow\nPlaszow concentration camp. I could not record it for sure. Also I had some friends that arrived\nfrom other camps and from other ghettos. But the total count of people, where they came from, I\nwould not be aware of.\nYou\u2019re still wearing the same clothes that you had on?\nI still recall wearing the same clothes. Also sometime during the time when we were inmates at\nthe concentration camp in the\u2014now known as Anka F and Amalia (ph) (c. 835) somehow two",
        "factories combining and using the people, the 1,000 inmates as their workers. Sometimes during\nthat time, our clothes were changed into stripes, striped outfits so that we could not escape.\nDuring any of this time, when you first began working for Oskar Schindler, were you still\nrequired to wear the yellow star? Remember when you were back in the ghetto, you had to wear\nan armband of some sort?\nNo, during this stay in Oskar Schindler\u2019s concentration camp and factory, we were not wearing\nany armbands. That was the time when the clothes was changed into stripes and we\u2019re wearing\ninmates outfits . (c. 848) Sometimes, during that time when this concentration camp\ncame into being under Oskar Schindler\u2019s influence and the SS guards guarding us, there was a\ntime when we underwent, all of the inmates underwent a tattooing process whereby the tattoo of a\nlarge KL was tattooed on our, if I recall, left wrist. The K stood for concentration, the L for lager.\nThis was done so that we could no longer escape. It was rather large letters, maybe one inch or\nlarger letters tattooed on the wrist. I received the same as everybody else but I also traveled in a\ncircle of friends who still had some hopes of escaping and we talked a great deal about it. We\ncould never do anything about it but we always talked about the possibility. In that connection,\nsomebody informed me at least that if I sucked out the tattooing right after it was done, when it\nwas still fresh, it would disappear. Thereby, I would still have a chance of escaping. Being a\nyoung person, naively hoping that this could happen one day, I did it. Surprisingly enough, this\ncame out and I never had a tattoo and to this day, I don\u2019t have a tattoo and yet the friends with\nwhom I survived together in this camp eventually, have this large KL on their wrists. I don\u2019t\nhave it but I know I received it and I sucked it out and it worked so well that there is no sign left\nof the KL on my wrist. Of course, escape never came, escape never was possible and somehow I\nmanaged to get by without ever having to prove that I belonged there without the KL.\nDid Schindler know you by then?\nSchindler would know me a little better than he knew a lot of other inmates, other than maybe\nBanker and some of the other officials. He knew me by sight because of the exposure that I had\nto him in that work in his offices. It was the blackout shades and also worked many nights there\nin a building when the construction was going on. It was going on during the winter and I recall\nmy responsibilities also as feeding the big drums with some wood so that there was heat provided\nfrom those burning drums. So I had to keep the fire going so the place\u2014so they would be able to\nwork, lay bricks and all that during the day.\nDid he remember you as the Jewish boy that he said was too young to work there?",
        "We never talked about it. I never brought this up to him again. I was kind of happy to be there. I\nalready began to recognize that this is a better place than someplace else so I wasn\u2019t going to\nbring up the fact that he didn\u2019t want me as a child in his factory. But I somehow left an\nimpression on him because when I met after the war, he greeted me warmly as if he knew me\nforever. So somehow, he did know me as one of the earlier inmates in his camp.\nHow long did you work there?\nThis existence of the 1,000 inmates in that camp adjoining the enamel works factory continued up\nto a time of very late 1943 or 1944, early 1944 when an English spy plane traveling over Krakow\nwas shot down. Of all the places in the city of Krakow, it landed in our small concentration camp\nwhich I was at this point size up as maybe a one-acre site, with six buildings, housing the 1,000\ninmates. It landed in our concentration camp, right on top of a building. Miraculously, this\nhappened, as far as I remember, during the night and those barracks were vacant. So there was no\none of the inmates was killed. I lived in an upper barrack which was a little removed from the\nsite of that plane crash, or the plane that was brought down. But this brought on a new situation\nbecause in that plane that came down in our camp ... I, of course, witnessed one or two bodies\nthat were burned in that plane and the ammunition was popping for a long time out of the plane.\nWhen we finally got a chance to see it, we saw either one body that was totally burned down, the\nonly thing that was left was his upper torso. Either one or two of the Englishmen strapped down\nand still the rest of the body being burned. But the first result from that crash burned \u2014 out of\nthe six buildings that were potentially there, there were only two left. So Schindler was ordered\nto return to the Krakow Plaszow concentration camp, 700 of these inmates and only 300 would\nremain. Of course, all these numbers I did not know at that time when this was going on. But\nthis was from stories and talking to different inmates later on. The 700 people that were\nsupposed to be returned to Krakow Plaszow arrived at a segregation or selection that the Germans\nconducted on the site. Oskar Schindler was there but the actual selection of people unless he has\ninstructed them different or made different requests which I was unaware of, the selection was\ndone by the Germans. During the selection time, I somehow sensed and I can\u2019t say that I knew\nanything else, but I somehow sensed that I am in a group of people that would be returned to\nKrakow Plaszow and somehow my sense also was telling me that this was a wrong place to go.\nTo this day, I don\u2019t know what made me think that, I did not have any previous knowledge but\nsomehow something was telling me that I\u2019m in the wrong place. I have to do something. My\nimmediate reaction was to step out of my line with the group of people I was with, step forward,\nrun towards Oskar Schindler who was, at this point, close to me. What you got to remember is\nthe SS guards were very strict, very business-like, with dogs, doing the selection. I somehow was\nwithout any fear, stepping out forward, stepping up to Schindler, practically shouting to\nSchindler, Herr Schindler (c. 970). What put these words into my mouth,\nwhy this was going to be so important to Oskar Schindler, I have absolutely no idea. I was just a\nyoungster doing what seemed to me like very unimportant work. But nevertheless, I did that and\nOskar Schindler, lo and behold, instructed the SS guards to place me in the other group. That\u2019s",
        "how I remained with the 300 people in the camp that was now two-thirds burned down. Two-\nthirds of the people down to Krakow Plaszow, I remained with the people in the\u2014in my work\nconcentration camp and continued to work at the factory. This probably would have been better\nplaced in early 1944.\nStill wintertime?\nStill wintertime, also the weather I recall as being mild. Once the plane crashed, I remember that\nas being mild. So this was later into the springtime or early in fall, I could not be 100 percent\nsure. But I would rather place it into the earlier spring of 1944. This arrangement with the 300\npeople only limping along, working shortage of materials for producing the pots and pans; the\nbuildings which were undertaken for the larger complex which was going to produce armaments\nor some parts of armaments was no longer being completed. Things began to come to a\nstandstill, just marking time. Of course, at the time, we did not know what was happening but\npretty\u2014after a few months, by October or September of 1944; September 1944, Schindler was\nordered to liquidate this concentration camp and ship us all back to the Krakow Plaszow\nconcentration camp. So once again I\u2019m with the 300 people who are delivered to the Krakow\nPlaszow camp and the factory, in fact, was closed and we remained for a while in the Krakow\nPlaszow concentration camp. This was an extremely busy place now. When we arrived there\ncattle cars were being loaded daily, simultaneously the appel plotz was still active like before.\nWe were there daily. Hangings were at a much brisker pace now and during those hangings, we\nall had to\u2014the inmates that were at the concentration camp\u2014had to stand and watch the\nhangings in progress. Some of my friends who were hung at that time and I witnessed and\nobserved the hanging at that time, Filledvich (ph) (c. 027) which was the Jewish leader of the\nconcentration camp or the assistant to the German was also hung at that time when I was there in\nthat concentration camp.\nWhy were they hanged?\nOnly rumors what we could rely on. Why people were hung. In the case of a friend of mine that\nwent to the same cheder, a religious school that I went to before the war, rumor was that he tried\nto escape. But these were all rumors. Don\u2019t imagine how anyone could escape from this\nconcentration camp. This was all surrounded by electrified barbed wires, with watchtowers. We\nwere, at that time, underfed, undernourished, just unimaginable, but nevertheless that was the\nrumor, that he was trying to escape. In Filledvich\u2019s (c. 047) case, the story was that he was a\nhelper to Amon Goeth and Amon Goeth had a long history of destroying those people that were\ntoo close to him. So he was one of the victims that was too close to him and he was hung. But\nthere were many other people hung, many other people that were brought in from the outside of\nthe concentration camp, were brought in because they found them hiding out or otherwise. At the",
        "same time, while the hangings were going on, there were also shootings going on. Ukrainian\nguard serving the Germans at that time was doing\u2014contributing his killing by shooting people\nand torturing people inside the camp. There was a place where this fellow by the name of Huyar\n(ph) (c.060), a Ukrainian and his cohorts would shoot people on that particular hill. This was the\nexistence in that camp for the next few weeks until October of 1944. In one of those transports\nthat were going out of the camp because this camp was being liquidated because of the advancing\nRussian army as we would only hear from rumors. We were too close to the Russian front and\nthe concentration camp of Krakow Plaszow had to be liquidated. Transports and killings were\ngoing on, as I said. One of those transports, I was loaded into cattle cars together with other\ninmates which I had no idea who the others were. Somehow, we had an idea that maybe Oskar\nSchindler is still alive someplace and will be building some concentration camp and maybe that\u2019s\nwhere we would be going. That\u2019s what some of us, in my group at least, thought. But we were\nthrown into these cattle cars, the SS guards pushing us, kicking us into these cars. Our railroad\ncar or the transport we were on would travel a few days and food was very meager. There was no\nway of getting any food from the outside. I don\u2019t recall the railroad cars being opened at any\ntime. Also I recall them being stopped and pushed into different sidings on that trip. We could\nonly surmise that some important transport of Germans was going through and needed the main\nlines so we were pushed off the track. But I really don\u2019t remember the railroad car being opened\nuntil we arrived in Gross-Rosen. Gross-Rosen was a concentration camp, quite a gruesome\nconcentration camp. We arrived there in October, cold. We were received by the SS guards\nthere. I recall standing on the appel plotz again counting and inspections going on. I remember\na latrine that was big enough for possibly 100 people. Open-air latrines. We stood there for what\nseemed a very long time. I believe we were eventually ordered to strip totally and in the nude\nmarch to a delousing showering facility, a cleaning facility. The guards would kick, if I recall\ncorrectly, these were Ukrainians that were on the inside of that concentration camp. Ukrainian\nguards in black uniforms would kick inmates and their habit was to kick inmates until they curled\nup on the ground or were too ill to respond. I don\u2019t know how many people died under these\nkicking outbursts but I know that they injured many people in that process. When we arrived at\nthe showering process and delousing as they would call it, we went through a room whereby our\nheads were\u2014we were given a crew cut and the Germans or the Ukrainian guards at that time\nwould spit on our heads to give them the ability to shave a stripe from front to back so it would\nwind up like a one to two inch stripe running through an otherwise crew cut, there would be a\nshaved strip. I suppose that this was done so that we would not be able to escape. So in the\nGross-Rosen camp, we received this crew cut and a shaved strip through the middle, running\nfrom front to back of the head. The situation inside the Gross-Rosen camp, as I described before,\nwhenever there was a chance for the Ukrainian guards to kick anyone, they enjoyed that. I don\u2019t\nrecall any killings or hangings inside that camp. The whole group that I arrived with was in a\nbarrack that potentially could have held a couple of hundred people. It seemed like all the seven\nhundred of us were held in this one barrack. One other thing I recall is in front of the\u2014the entry\nof the barrack, there was a meticulous room where the SS guards or the Ukrainian guards would\nbe standing by watching us in the rest of the room. Everything in that entry room was meticulous,\nwas pots and cooking ware and all this. It just looked like a little showplace until you got to the\nrest of the barrack where we were housed. There was not enough place for people to be housed.",
        "All those 700 and the only way we could be in that room would be by sitting on the floor and\nsitting in one another\u2019s lap. The clothes we received now at that delousing was simply one shirt\nand somehow I don\u2019t recall any other clothing that we received. We simply received one shirt\nand we were walking around in that one shirt, sitting in one another\u2019s lap in that Gross-Rosen\nbarrack. This lasted a few days, possibly a week. The only food I remember being given in that\nGross-Rosen camp\u2014number one, some of us were awakened at some hour like four o\u2019clock in\nthe morning. This was winter approaching so it seemed like a deep...\nTape Il",
        "Were you required to perform work at Gross-Rosen?\nI don\u2019t recall any work being required of us, maybe, not all of us. I personally don\u2019t recall doing\nany work. It was kind of idleness, sitting and the situation began to look very desperate. We\nforgot about Oskar Schindler. Or at least I was unaware of anything of what\u2019s happening with\nOskar Schindler, which was still in the back of our minds when we traveled in the cars. But at\nthis point, desperate... Also one other thing that I noticed was that the 700 of us that were in this\nbarrack were no longer the same group of people with whom I worked back in Poland at the\nenamel works. It looked like a total stranger group. Some of the people that I knew were still\nthere but most of the people were missing from this original group. In fact, some of the friends\nthat were with me in that time, in Krakow, were no longer here in Gross-Rosen. So somehow, it\nlooked like a different mix of people except for a smaller group of us that worked for Schindler\nand were still here. So that I did not know of what is happening to us and I did not know what\nthe future is bringing. One occasion, I recall, I could not find myself a place, somehow arrived\nlate in the barrack and everybody was already sitting in one another\u2019s lap. Walking in I just\ncouldn\u2019t find a place so the guard, the Ukrainian guard, with a nightstick in his hand, went after\nme to find myself a place. I couldn\u2019t because everybody was sitting tight. So I recall jumping\nover people, running to escape from him and him running with that nightstick and just hitting\nwhatever came along. On the way of chasing me, he probably hit many people. I eventually\nfound a place to collapse into and the chase was over. After a number of nights and days of this\nterror-ridden concentration camp, we were sitting assembled as I described before in one\nanother\u2019s lap. Somehow, the guards came in with a list and began to read names. Where this was\nleading to I didn\u2019t know but everybody was hoping to somehow be on that list. Whatever this\nwas turning out to be, it seemed like getting out of here someplace or doing something else was a\nrelief so everybody was extremely anxious to hear his name. I recall being extremely anxious\nbecause my name starts with a U and so this reading of names seemed like a whole night process\nand my name just was not coming up. Eventually it did get to my name and after all the names\nwere called out ... Up to this point in time, that is 1992 in Flemington, I have absolutely no idea\nwhere these names came from. Now the only thing I can suspect is that somehow when we left\nthe Krakow Plaszow concentration camp, somebody submitted a list of names to some German",
        "authorities and the pin leisheit[?] (ph) (c. 52) of the German authorities somehow led them to\nforward this list of people that are evidently destined to go into Oskar Schindler\u2019s factory again. I\ndon\u2019t know, I can\u2019t tell it for sure but I do know that in Gross-Rosen there was a list from which\nthe Ukrainian guards were reading. As I said before, probably, since 1941 or even since the\nbeginning of the war, I don\u2019t ever recall having to give anybody my name. I don\u2019t recall, maybe\nin the ghetto, when we arrived in the ghetto, we would have given names but other than that, we\nbecame totally nameless people. I don\u2019t recall anybody ever requiring of me to give him my\nname. But nevertheless, in Gross-Rosen, in the concentration camp there, that particular night all\nthe names were called, As I said before, most of the names were not familiar to me. They were\npeople simply that came from the Krakow Plaszow ghetto and were no longer the same people\nthat were working with me in the enamel works at Oskar Schindler in Krakow. My name was\neventually called. Eventually all the names were called and we were loaded into carloads,\nrailway cars again, and shipped to somewhere.\nOf the few people that you remembered from the enamel factory that were still with you, were\nthey also on this list?\nYes. Those few people that I recognized, that I knew, were from the list of\u2014or were from those\npeople that worked for Oskar Schindler before. But the bulk of them was not. The bulk of them\nsimply came to this Gross-Rosen camp by some knowledge that this was going to be a shipment\nto Oskar Schindler\u2019s concentration camp where the survival chances were the greatest. I was\ntotally unaware of it, being the youngster. I was simply probably amongst this group because of\nmy stepping forward at one time in\u2014to Oskar Schindler\u2014where Oskar Schindler placed me in\nthe group that would eventually survive.\nWhen were you transferred out of Gross-Rosen?\nGross-Rosen, we were transferred after a week\u2019s stay. We were shipped out of\u2014by railroad cars\nagain. I think that this time the railroad cars again traveled seven, eight nights, eight days, into a\nplace that\u2014in Czechoslovakia, deep in Czechoslovakia. The name of the town was Brinlitz (ph)\n(c. 87). We were marched from the railroad cars to a factory someplace in the vicinity. I don\u2019t\nrecall the distance of that march. But at this time, we were 700 of us that left Gross-Rosen. And\n700 of us, males only. I don\u2019t recall any women in Gross-Rosen. Also, they could have been there\nin a different barracks. But in our situation, I only recall males. We were\u2014when we arrived, 700\nof us were marched into this factory which looked like an old factory that what\u2019s that called\n9",
        "You mean a warehouse?",
        "No, where they make materials. Linen ...\nOh, okay, textiles?\nWhich looked like a textile factory. We were marched into that thing and if I recall correctly, we\nwere greeted by Schindler when we arrived on that site. It didn\u2019t look like a concentration camp.\nIt simply looked like a textile factory. The building was textile machinery but it was fairly\nobvious at that time that Oskar Schindler received this factory again as a gift and he was going to\nconvert this textile factory into some kind of an armament factory. How this was to be done, I\ndon\u2019t know. None of us had any training, none of us was skilled workers, at least that I was\naware of, in that area. But Oskar Schindler evidently received permission to build a\nconcentration camp. Barbed wires went up, watchtowers went up and the German contingent of\nSS guards to watch us was in place. IfI recall, this was not an extremely large group of SS\nguards. If I had to place a number on them, it would have been 50 or 60 SS guards being housed\nin one barrack. We were being housed in the upper floor of this textile factory.\nWere all the SS Germans?\nIt looked at that time like all the SS were Germans and also, one additional factor that I noticed at\nthat time were that these SS Germans were older people. They were no longer the younger, full\nof spic and span and polished. They were tired old people that were in the SS uniforms watching\nus. This factory began to take shape and some work was being done, disassembling the old\ntextile factory. Shortly after we arrived in this camp, a group of 300 women that evidently\nunderwent exactly the same thing in Auschwitz when we were being transported from Krakow\nPlaszow to Gross-Rosen, evidently these women were shipped to Auschwitz. It was fairly\nobvious that this group of people was somehow\u2014also arrived in Auschwitz was a list. Somehow\nby name, were called out by name from Auschwitz and set on a march from Auschwitz to\nBrimletz [?] (c. 130). So 300 women arrived in Brimletz in a much worse situation than we did\nbecause this was\u2014could have been October, November of 1944. They were set on a march,\nmarching from Auschwitz to Brimletz and being guarded by Polish-Ukrainian convicts that were\nset in charge of those women to march them towards the camp, these official guards were brutal\nduring the route to those women on the march from Auschwitz to Brimletz. But eventually they\narrived in Brimletz and a small section of this housing or the textile factory was surrounded by\nbarbed wire. The 300 women lived in the same complex with us but being separated from the\nmen by barbed wire. The productivity in this particular camp was not of great value as it\nappeared to me because dismantling, shifting around, building of offices for Oskar Schindler and\nhis staff that evidently was meant to appear as if he was going to do great things for the German\neffort.",
        "I wound up working in one of the buildings that was renovated into a\u2014offices for Oskar\nSchindler. I remember doing pine paneling and since there was a shortage of materials we used a\ntorch to sort of burn lightly the pine materials so that it would appear like a finished material. But\nactually, it was simply scorched from the flame of the torch and we eventually wound up\nconstructing some offices for Schindler that was very impressive looking. The factory\u2014I don\u2019t\never remember doing any work that would have been close to what the Germans were hoping for\nbut we were kept busy. Some woodworking shop was in existence. Everything on the inside\nlooked rather peaceful. The SS guards were somehow led to believe and understand that their\nduty is only to keep us from escaping. I don\u2019t recall any torture or anything that these SS guards\nwould inflict on us. There were occasional shipments that were arriving in the camp, of Jews that\nwere evidently rounded up as escapees someplace or potentially from liquidating small groups of\ninmates. Those were arriving at our doors or in our camp 1n horrible desperate situation. We\noccasionally had to go to the railroad cars and open them up; pry them open to get to the people\non the inside. We would occasionally find dead people, people with frozen bodies to the railroad\ncars, torn pieces of flesh from them from the frostbites. There were not great numbers that were\narriving but those that were arriving from some other sources were in desperate situation. Many\nof the people were buried there on the inside of the camps\u2014of that camp that I was in now. I,\nalong with another friend of mine who was also a woodworker like myself, we were assigned\nnow to renovate a villa that was given to Oskar Schindler at his residence. The villa was outside\nof the camp or maybe some distance away, maybe a 15, 20 minute walk to that villa. The villa\nwas located on the inside of a mill. I recall also it was behind a canal, water and a bridge leading\nup to his villa. But from this villa, you could walk out to the mill and be inside the mill. It was\nobvious that this villa once belonged to the owner of the mill, a rather large complex. In the mill,\nthere was flour and oatmeal and stuff like that. Schindler\u2019s villa appeared like an unoccupied\nbuilding also. Once in a great while, we would notice Mrs. Schindler being there. I don\u2019t ever\nrecall him being there but our assignment was to polish his furniture, clean up the villa, do\nwhatever we thought, the two of us inmates from the concentration camp, thought can be done to\nimprove Mr. Schindler\u2019s residence. The two of us were marched daily out of the concentration\ncamp on the textile grounds\u2014the textile factory grounds\u2014were marched out daily by two SS\nguards to that villa. On occasion, so one SS guard would lead us out and things were\u2014seemed\nrather normal. There was no great fear of escaping and the SS guards, as I mentioned were older\npeople. Somehow, it just began to feel like something is coming to an end. It 1s no longer that\nfearsome kind of concentration camps that I was in before. It somehow had the appearance of a\nmore relaxed situation. In fact, the SS guard or the two SS guards would come into the villa and\nwould sit down on a sofa and the two of us were pretty much free to do whatever we thought we\nshould do, polishing, making believe that we\u2019re polishing. Occasionally working on some radio\nwhere we would turn it on and hear BBC talking about the tremendous losses that the Germans\nare undergoing. We would be able to bring that news back to the camp. The reason we were able\nto hear this occasionally, listen to the radio occasionally, was that the SS guards who came in to\nwatch us, either one or two of them, would sit down on the sofa with their carbine or bayonet\nbetween their legs and they would doze off and went into deep sleep. We were able to simply\nroam around that building and do what we thought should be done. On numerous occasions, I",
        "would even be able to jump out of the window of that villa. As I described it was located inside\nof a mill and somehow make my way into one of the mill buildings where lots of stuff was\nbeing\u2014was laying around. I was able to go in these buildings, these warehouses, and by that\ntime I learned the trick of tying my pants at the bottom, whatever pants I had at that time and\nfilling up my pants\u2014\nPant leg.\nPant leg\u2014with some stuff like oatmeal, cornmeal or something like that. With that I came back\ninto the villa, acted as if I was nowhere, did not get out of the building and the SS guard didn\u2019t\neven know the difference. That material that I stole from the mill, I, on occasion, I would walk\nwith those pant legs tied at the bottom with stuff in them. Or by that time, I had a toolbox which\nI managed to build a fake top whereby on the top I had some tools laid out. The inside of the\nbox, was a rather large box, would hold all that material I stole from the mill. With that I was\nable to pass through the guards in the\u2014when we were marched back to the campsite. In the\ncampsite, I was able to give out all that stuff that I stole. I became quite good at it. I was able to\nhand this out and there were many occasions where people would, the inmates that is, some of the\ninmates became aware of it, that I am in this enviable position. I was having all this foodstuff and\nsome people would approach me because of an illness of a particular inmate or a relative and I\nbecame a person much in demand by giving out that food to other inmates. On many occasions, I\nalso stole other things. It somehow appears that I was\u2014became an important inmate because of\nmy employment in Oskar Schindler\u2019s villa. So I was somehow treated and was able to, on\noccasions, steal things from carloads that were passing by or arriving. I would also be able to\nhand out these things, as I said, to friends. But on many occasions, I was able to sneak these food\nmaterials, foodstuffs, into the women\u2019s barracks which was simply a way ... The way I got that\ninto the women\u2019s barracks is by throwing it over those barbed wires. I somehow had the\nfreedom, so did my friend who worked with me at the villa, to do that. On one of those\noccasions, I was discovered that I am bringing in foodstuff from the outside and that I ... That\nsomebody threw over some food into the women\u2019s barracks. I recall at the gathering, at the appel\nplotz in this case was held\u2014the gathering of all the inmates for counting purposes and all that\nwas held inside of this factory building. One of those inspections, the head of the SS guards,\nwhose name I don\u2019t recall at the moment, came to the appel plotz and yelled out, \u201cvaw zin\n\u201d (c. 288). That means where are those people that were inside the women\u2019s",
        "barracks? Evidently a woman SS guard who watched the women\u2019s quarters noticed us and we\nwere reported. The two of us were reported for being at one time inside the women\u2019s\nquarters. As I said before, on many occasions I would do that\u2014I would somehow make my way\ninto the women\u2019s barracks, either throwing it over or getting in there and giving away all that\nfoodstuff that I had. I have never received anything from anyone for the stuff that I gave out. It\nwas simply a very enjoyable moment for me to be able to do it. I\u2019ve never asked, never received,",
        "never knew of anything I could have asked or could have received. So at this appel plotz, this SS\nguard, head of the SS unit, is yelling \u201cvaw \u201d (c. 305). Out of fear, I did not step\nout. At first, neither did my friend. But eventually, it appeared very serious. Somebody could\npay for it if we didn\u2019t step out. We did step out finally and we said we were the ones that were in\nthe women\u2019s barracks. As it turned out, he did not possess, this SS guard, did not possess enough\nauthority to punish or hang us or punish us in any way. All he wanted to know was who\npermitted us\u2014who let us into the women\u2019s barracks. These were reactions that we had to rely\non, both my friend and myself, and our reaction was to simply point at two SS guard women who\nwere at the door and they saw us going in. At that point, if there was any punishment unleashed,\nit was on the two SS guard women opposed to us. We were permitted to re-join our ranks and we\nwere not punished at all for violation.\nNot even for stealing food?\nNo, we were not punished for anything. Now, as I said before, this was 1945 already. It was\u2014\nsomehow the air was filled with something going on. There were many demonstrations of that\nalready. I recall one day when we were all told to stay in our barracks, not to step out. I\nremember looking out the barracks where Schindler was ordered to appear to some authorities,\noutside of the camp obviously, to some authorities in Prague or outside of Prague. We can only\ngo by stories that were circulating amongst us\u2014one story was that Schindler was called in to\nexplain how it is that the inmates inside the camp received some food while the population\noutside is now being starved. The Czechoslovaks that were free supposedly did not have as much\nfood arriving into their homes as we were getting into the camp. I recall distinctly being in the\nbarracks, nobody went out to work anyplace and eventually after many hours, Schindler arrived\nback from that appearance before some authorities in a total drunk state. The engineer with him\nwas\u2014as I said we were inside the barracks looking out, looking for some signs of what is going\non. Nobody bothering us inside the camp at all, the SS guards being outside. Schindler arrives\nwith this engineer of his and we hear him distinctly pointing at the end of the camp, ordering this\nengineer to build a fence, a very high fence with corrugated metal solid so the outside residents\nwould not be able to look inside to see that we have food in the camp while they don\u2019t have any\nfood. That fence actually went up. He ordered the engineer to do that and that fence eventually\nwent up. Where in time this was, I don\u2019t know, but weatherwise that I would remember, it could\nhave been maybe already April of 1945, that this was happening. It appeared that the SS guards\nwere totally under the control of Oskar Schindler. So the fence went up and there was peace.\nAlso rumors were beginning to circulate that all this food and sometimes carloads of colorables\n(ph) (c. 376) or other foodstuff, bread would arrive in large numbers into the camp. The rumor\nhad it that Oskar Schindler was stealing those at the railroad station and was able to commandeer\nthings to bring them into the camp. There was total chaos among the Germans and he appeared\nas the highest ranking officer when he put on his SA uniform. He had a bunch of decorations on\nhim that he obviously appeared like the man in charge. When he went to the railroad stations and\nordered things to be loaded on cars and shipped to his camp or wherever he ordered them, he",
        "somehow succeeded in that. It is also my understanding that, on occasion, he would unseal some\nrailroad cars that had some armaments or parts of armaments. He was able to unseal those and\nput his own seal and his own name on them as if he produced those things and shipped them on to\nthe German hierarchy. All this was going on. Inside the camp, things were bearable. I continued\nmy work at the villa bringing back news that things for the Germans are turning bad. The BBC\ntalking about the Americans, the English successes. Eventually on May 8, Schindler called\ntogether all his inmates. I have to correct that. On May 7, Schindler called all his inmates\ntogether into this, what used to be the appel plotz, inside the factory building. When we were all\nassembled, he pointed to his open door in his own office, inside the factory and he said I have\nassembled 30 revolvers in that\u2014they were all on the table in his office. For those of you who\nknow how to use them, you should distribute them amongst yourselves and begin protecting\nyourselves. Because all the SS guards from the camp are gone. Rumor later on had it that\nSchindler faked an order for them to leave the barracks and immediately report to the SS units in\nPrague. So that he announced to us that we are no longer being watched by SS guards but there is\na potential of stray German units coming through this area that could still hurt us unless we begin\nto protect ourselves. Additionally, he said I have to leave this camp. I have to leave this factory\nimmediately. Because if I stay here this is deep in Czechoslovakia, the Czechoslovaks would\ntreat him as a German authority. He could potentially face trouble because since his original\ncontributions to the Germans took place inside Czechoslovakia. So he was in danger of his life\nand he asked that some of our inmates volunteer to help him get across into some American or\nEnglish zone. Some of our inmates, there were two or three that stepped forth to help him get\nhim across into the English zone or American zone, did take place. Schindler left and we were\nleft inside that concentration, inside that factory until the next day. On that appel plotz he also\nannounced to us that the Germans will be signing a surrender tomorrow. This was the 7\" and he\ntold us that by tomorrow the Germans will be signing a surrender and that the war will be over.\nHe announced those words to us. The cries, the laughs, the outbursts that went up from our\npeople is still vivid in my memory until today. It was just a scene of unbelievable confusion,\nhappiness, unhappiness, everything mixed together as this developed. The next day, as Schindler\npromised, we did not hear about any announcement of surrender but we did see a Russian soldier,\na single Russian soldier that looked like he was 20-foot tall on a horse that was extremely small.\nAt least that\u2019s how it appeared to me at that time, marched into our camp and declared that the\nGermans are no longer here, that the Russians have marched in here and that we are free people.\nWe remained in there because we had no guidance from anyone inside the camp other than to\nprotect ourselves. We really did not know what and when\u2014some of our people were sick, weak.\nWe did not know the next step immediately. Some of the older inmates knew that amongst us are\nsome of those Ukrainian, Polish guards that brought the women from Auschwitz to our camp.\nThese inmates of ours wanted to know from the Russians what we should do with them. Because\nnow, evidently, they had an eye on them and took them as prisoners. They wanted to know from\nthe Russians what we should do with them. The Russians evidently gave our inmates permission\nto deal with them as we see appropriate. So some of those inmates that were now held by the\nformer prisoners were actually hung on the factory pipes right after the war. We eventually were\nfreed and upon Schindler\u2019s leaving he also pointed to us, pointed out to us that he has warehouses\nfull of stuff. As I spoke about this, he was able to organize those by going to the train stations",
        "and ordering things to be shipped wherever he desired. In this he had warehouses full of stuff.\nFull of liquor, full of foodstuffs, he had materials, he had clothing, he had house shoes as I recall\nand all those. He told us in his parting message that all this should be divided amongst the\ninmates and we should do it as fast as we can because the Russians are marching in here and there\nis a good chance that they would take this because they needed it probably almost as much as we\ndid. So some of our inmates took charge immediately of those revolvers, of those\u2014of the\nammunition that was available and we were obviously protected. No one was harmed by stray\nGerman units. Schindler has left and we were now being dispensed all those materials that were\nin warehouses in that factory. I recetved\u2014I recall receiving some shoes, some house shoes, some\nmaterials that I eventually could make a suit and some other stuff which I don\u2019t recall at the\nmoment. But eventually we were free and it also appeared that everybody was totally on his own.\nThere was no authority, no Russian authority directing us anyplace, no Czechoslovak authority\ndirecting us anyplace. We just had to follow what our own imaginations would guide us to do. I\njoined a group of 17 people that is 13 men, four women, that evidently selected Krakow as our\ndestination and we would begin a march towards Krakow. We simply left the camp under no\none\u2019s guidance, with lack of knowledge of what we\u2019re going to have to pass through, whether\nthere was still some fighting going on anyplace. We nonetheless left the camp, 17 of us. We\nwere able to round up a horse and wagon. The horses at that time were simply roaming the fields,\nsome of them being injured from the war. Some of them simply left by fleeing German units.\nThey were simply roaming the fields. We were able to take a horse or two and a wagon. Load up\non this wagon whatever materials we just received from the warehouses of Oskar Schindler, take\nthose with us. Those of us that were stronger would march behind the wagon. Those that were\nweaker were on the wagon. We would exchange those that were riding and those that were\nwalking. We did that for the next seven days. The horses would not last that long because they\nwere injured horses. So during that march of the seven or so days, we would have to exchange\nthese injured horses for other injured horses to pull our wagon to help us get to our destination of\nKrakow. We never reached Krakow itself. We went as far as Vruzwuff (ph) (c. 588) which was\na former city of Breslow, a German city. When we got to Breslow, there was some semblance of\nnormality already existing there. There were already residents trying to rebuild the city. All the\noutskirts and railroad cars and the city itself of Breslow were totally destroyed during the war\nfrom bombardments. I recall buildings that were totally destroyed, with just one room still\nfunctioning or something. We were accommodated in those bombed-out buildings. Eventually\nfrom Breslow, (c. 605) I would have to think that I was able to eventually get on a train and go\nfrom there to Poland and eventually wind up in Krakow. Potentially, three or four weeks after\nMay 8, the end of the war, I arrived in Krakow.\nWhat did you find there?\nSomehow within the next few days, we all went out on our own in search of families. Whether\nfamily members of ours\u2014as I mentioned all of our group, all of the 17 people went out on their\nown. I traveled back to Borek Falecki immediately and inquired of neighbors, of my former",
        "employer whether he has seen any one of my family members. No one was able to shed any light\non that. The situation was very difficult for me to remain in Borek Falecki because it just seemed\nlike it was unsafe yet because of the anti-Semitism which didn\u2019t somehow disappear with the\nwar. From word that we got from other Jewish members who traveled to different locations of\ntheir homes and they felt extremely unsafe. Based on that, I also felt unsafe and returned back to\nKrakow. By that time, I discovered that some of the people from the 17 people that I returned\nwith, had found some relatives either close ones or distant ones and in fact I discovered that I was\nthe only one of that group of 17 that so far did not find anyone, distant relative or close relative.\nEventually, one of the 17 people was able to find a place for me to stay with them in a one room\nsituation where it seemed like maybe 20 or 30 people that had no place to go, were\naccommodated by this one person in Krakow. In Krakow, the organizations, Jewish\norganizations, UNRRA, other organizations became active and sent out calls for people to begin\nto look for lists at certain places of people who survived and returned. So that we will be able to\nlook whether any of our relatives returned from the war. This was my daily function, to go to\nthose places and look for lists up and down. I did not find names of my family on any of those\nlists. Eventually I was assigned some housing in Krakow itself where myself with three other\npeople lived in one room which was formerly a students\u2019 building in Krakow. On one of those\ndaily trips to these schools or gathering places where they were bringing in some inmates from\nsome concentration camps like Mauthausen, other (c.652), Auschwitz... By that time, I\nalready gave up or did not have any hope any more that any one of my family members 1s alive.\nThis was already going on a few weeks into post war and no one was appearing. I practically\ngave up hope. But on one of those trips I found a bunch of returnees from Mauthausen and I\nsomehow had knowledge that one of my close friends, a fellow by the name of Adam Mondel (7?)\n(c. 659) was in Mauthausen when we were separated once before in Krakow Plaszow. We were\nclose friends and I somehow understood that he went to Mauthausen. So in this transport of\npeople that arrived from Mauthausen, those that survived, and they were all very ill. When I\narrived in this school building where those survivors arrived, they were all sitting or laying on the\nfloors, very poor shape, very bad health wise. I already had eaten and I already had clothing by\nthat time but those people were in horrible shape. Some of them not even remembering their\nnames. So I along with another friend of mine began walking through those survivors of\nMauthausen and shouting Adam Mondel (ph) (c. 670) loudly. Would this friend of ours be\namong those survivors? Because no one was recognizable, really. We couldn\u2019t recognize\nanyone. Poorly clothed, poorly fed and in real bad shape. So that the only way we could\ndiscover whether anyone we know was there, was to yell their name and maybe somebody would\nrespond. Sure enough on one of those trips, I was there with a friend yelling Adam Mondel, and\na fellow answered to that name. Stood up, unfolded from the floor and stood up. That was my\nfriend, Adam Mondel. This was about the closest that I came to seeing any one of my friends.\nRelatives were noy found by that time and no one was ever found from my relatives. But this\nwas the closest friend that I found and the only close friend that I found that I knew from before,\nAdam Mondel. Took him with me out of this waiting room in the school and he began living\ntogether with us in that building, in that students\u2019 building in Krakow.",
        "As far as you can tell, your family was killed during that liquidation of March, 1943.\nYes, as far as I can ascertain. At this point from reading different materials, from talking to\nformer residents of the Krakow ghetto; very few people from there went from any place else but\nto Krakow Plaszow. Some few only went to Krakow Plaszow and only us, the ones that worked\nat the Oskar Schindler factory and held overnight, those were the only ones who survived\u2014that\nsurvived that camp. To the best of my knowledge, at this point, no one left from there to any\nother camp. Simply was killed in the ghetto itself. All the shooting and all the killing was done\ninside the ghetto. Those transports never left any place at all. So I have never found anyone from\nmy family, not even from distant relatives. To this point, I always look through books and lists.\nBut at this point, in 1992, I still have not found any close relative of mine that survived the war. I\nam the only one that survived.\nYou\u2019re the only survivor of the Urbach--?\nOf the Urbach or any Boldinger family from that area.\nWhen did you realize that the Oskar Schindler episode would become famous?\nAfter my settling in Krakow, the situation became clearer to me that no one survived. It also\nbecame clear to me that Poland was no place to remain. Number one because of my previous\nknowledge of anti-Semitism, number two, the Russians were there now and we already began to\nunderstand the Russians were not only the liberators but they also have a totalitarian state and\ncertainly Poland was no place to remain. I began to look towards traveling out of Poland into the\nAmerican or English zone, to somehow get away from communism. For a while, I traveled to\nUsti nad Orlici (Czech Republic) c.715) or the German name for it would have been Aussig (c.\n716) and hoped to settle in Czechoslovakia because I was ... When the war ended and from my\nexperience and knowledge of the Czechoslovakian people, they were the friendliest people I have\never come across. My own thinking led me to believe that maybe, somehow settling in\nCzechoslovakia would be the place and the three of us made that decision to somehow escape\nfrom Poland and travel to Czechoslovakia and settle in the city of Austic (c. 724). I don\u2019t\nremember at this moment how we happen to pick Austic but that\u2019s where we were heading for.\nBut when we got to Austic and we already had some living quarters there, we were not in touch\nwith any Jewish organizations that would provide us with more definite instructions or more\ndefinite help as to where and what. We were somehow on our own and we began to recognize\nthat the Russians or the communists are there too and this was no place to stay. So we began to\nlook, the three of us began to look to escaping from Czechoslovakia into the American or English\nzone. That\u2019s what we eventually did. But before we escaped from Czechoslovakia, we also\ndiscovered we acquired, all of a sudden, a skill of being able to cross the Polish Czechoslovak\nborder fairly efficiently without being caught by the Russians or Poles or Czechoslovaks. So for",
        "a while, I acted as a courier in trying to help some people that wanted to get out of Poland. I was\nable to smuggle at least two people out of Krakow to Czechoslovakia and eventually into West\nGermany. I helped smuggle them out of Poland into Czechoslovakia to help them get into the\nAmerican zone and eventually wound up settling in Bomberg, Germany.\nOskar Schindler reentered into my knowledge that he, in fact, survived and he lived in Munich. I\nwent to see him in Munich. He somehow had the knowledge to recognize me and he called me\nby the name of Rumak (ph) (c. 751). Rumak somehow was give to me\u2014the name Rumak was\ngiven to me somehow in the process of the war because at one time I was called Schomek (c.\n754) but that became an awkward name so somebody popped out Rumak. The name Rumak\nstuck and evidently Schindler remembered that name so he still remembered Rumak. Later on in\nyears, I became aware of it that Schindler was, in fact, a recognized Christian for helping Jews\nand it became common knowledge that he was a guest of the Israeli government and that he\nfrequently traveled to Israel where he was celebrated as a hero by the former inmates of the\nconcentration camps, especially those that he helped survive. One of those trips, my trips that I\nwent to Israel in 1973, I was aware that Schindler was in the country at that time and found the\naddress of Oskar Schindler. I, together with my family at that time, my wife, my children went to\nvisit Oskar Schindler in Tel Aviv. When I walked in, he was already a man after a slight stroke\nbut he did recognize me. He yelled out Rumak. He called my name again, he still remembered\nmy name at that time. We spoke briefly and we parted. He eventually died the same year and\nwas buried on Mt. Scopus in Jerusalem.\nHe didn\u2019t know your last name then? So the mystery of the list ?\nThe mystery of the list continues, right. There was only as I speculated already that was one\nchance that some German official in the Krakow Plaszow ghetto was handed a list of who is\ngoing to Schindler. It is unbeknown to me but there is a good chance that there are some people\nwho would have known how this list was created. It certainly was not born in Gross-Rosen.\nAs you know, there has been literature grown regarding his factory and his lists. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re\nfamiliar with some of them. What can you tell us regarding how the system really operated and\nhow were people saved by Schindler?\nSchindler managed to befriend the head of the SS guards of Krakow Plaszow, Amon Goeth. He\nsomehow managed to befriend him, and from what it appeared at that time, and was confirmed\nlater on, this brutal murderer, Amon Goeth looked to Schindler and believed that Schindler was a\ncapable individual and that he would somehow help him accumulate wealth and well-being. So\nsomehow an extreme friendship developed with those two people. There is also the slight chance",
        "that Schindler was able to hand a list later on also. I have no knowledge of this because some\nplace along the line at that particular time of confusion when we were being transferred from one\ncamp to another Oskar Schindler as well as Amon Goethe wound up in German jail. This was\nnot the first time that they wound up in German jail or Oskar Schindler would up in German jail\nand he wound up in German jail, as rumor would have it at that time, because German authorities\nbecame aware of his ability to accumulate wealth and having warehouses of materials even back\nin Poland. That something was fishy but Oskar Schindler never stayed long enough in jail\nbecause some of his cohorts and good friends from Berlin would set him free again and he went\nback to doing exactly what he was doing before, after he came out from jail. I recall that Oskar\nSchindler just came out of jail not long before we came to Brunnlitz (Brnenec, Czech Republic).\nWhen we already were in Brunnlitz, this Amon Goeth who conducted all these hangings and\nshootings and murderous acts in Krakow Plaszow also appeared in Brunnlitz. At one time, I\nremember seeing him but this Amon Goeth was no longer the Amon Goeth of the SS guard with\nthe almighty power but somehow they stripped him of all his ranks while he was in jail. Because\nhe was in jail at that time, as rumor would have it, for stealing the transports of foods that would\narrive into the concentration camp from some Jewish organizations abroad or Red Cross or\nsomething. That he was stealing those and he was turning them into gold and diamonds and other\nthings. So when he appeared in Brunnlitz, he looked like a former inmate. The clothes that he\nonce wore and looked so tall and big and fat, was not the same man any more. He looked like he\nwent through hell in the German jail. This Amon Goeth eventually traveled back to Poland\nbecause evidently that\u2019s where he was assigned. He came to Brunnlitz only because of his\nfriendship with Oskar Schindler so he evidently came to visit Oskar Schindler but it also appears\nthat Oskar Schindler didn\u2019t return the friendship and did not help him stay with him in\nCzechoslovakia. But from what I discovered later on, Amon Goeth returned to Poland, to\nKrakow. In fact, when the Russians marched in, Amon Goeth was captured by the Poles in that\ncity of Krakow where he conducted this horribly brutal camp and eventually was sentenced to\ndeath by hanging. He was hung in Krakow by the Polish authorities. Oskar Schindler also had\ngreat influence from what I have observed. While the criminal acts of Amon Goeth were going\non inside the camp, hangings, lynchings, shootings, beatings, the whole catastrophe; it was also\nknown to us at that time that if Oskar Schindler entered the Krakow Plaszow camp on a visit to\nAmon Goeth, Amon Goeth would suspend all the activities of hangings and killings because he\nsometimes didn\u2019t want Schindler to know that he is conducting such affairs. So in that way,\nmany of the Jews that were spared from hangings and killings and beatings were simply spared\nby Oskar Schindler appearing in this killing camp.\nHow did people get on list? I imagine that over a period of time, it was obviously that it was not\na bad place to be, working for Mr. Schindler. I suspect that there were people who were trying to\nget put on these lists. Did you have any insight or knowledge about this, either during the time\nyou were there or after the fact, after the war?",
        "Yes, as I stated before probably towards the end of the war, it became fairly obvious that if\nanyone will survive this nightmare, it would be through the help somehow of this character,\nOskar S. That being with him, he would somehow protect us. Whether we knew it fully or not, I\npersonally can\u2019t say that I knew it but instinct would lead me to believe me all the time that that\nwas a better place than any place else. In Krakow Plaszow, when we returned to Krakow\nPlaszow because Oskar Schindler\u2019s camp was closed, it became common knowledge that Oskar\nSchindler is still searching for a place, someplace that he would be able to move his people to that\nplace, maybe further away from the front. It some became common knowledge. Also at this\nparticular time, being maybe one of the younger members of the inmates, being one of the lesser\nknown inmates, I did not personally know that. But it was fairly obvious that some of the Jewish\nleaders in connection with some of the Germans, the SS guards were aware of this in Krakow\nPlaszow, that Oskar Schindler is out there someplace deeper into the country of Czechoslovakia\nmaybe or Germany, escaping further away from the Russians. And that he would create again a\nconcentration camp and it would be desirable for anyone from the Krakow Plaszow camp to get\nto Oskar Schindler. Somehow, some of the Jewish authorities knew all that and some of the\u2014in\nthe process some of the former inmates or workers for Oskar Schindler would be shipped out to\nMauthausen and ... So as I explained before but to clarify, it would appear that the 1,000 people\nthat survived in Oskar Schindler\u2019s camp in Brunnlitz (Brnenec, Czech Republic), which was\ncomposed of 700 men and 300 women approximately, were no longer the same 1000 people that\nwere at one time in the Krakow concentration camp near Oskar Schindler\u2019s factory but, in fact,\nwere those that were replaced in the process of shipments leaving Krakow Plaszow into uncertain\ndestinies and camps like Mauthausen. Those former workers of that factory were shipped out to\nthose camps and replaced by other people from the Krakow Plaszow camp. Those people\nessentially spent with\u20141in Brimlitz the last six months of the war and survived that way.\nSo you would say that some people were bumped from the original list and that other names were\nadded?\nIt would appear at this point that some people that were originally destined to go into Oskar\nSchindler\u2019s camp were bumped in the process at Krakow Plaszow and were replaced by others.\nNow Mr. Schindler, apparently he made a lot of money during these years. On the other hand, he\nsaved people, he saved lives. In your opinion, based on your knowledge of the man, which was\nthe more important for him?\nIt would appear to me that Oskar Schindler of the earlier days of the war was an opportunist\nlooking upon the war as a great opportunity to enrich himself. Certainly being given that Jewish\nfactory in Poland led him to believe that the future is his and that he was going to make a lot of\nmoney. But someplace along the line, he began to feel that his ideas of making money, being an\nindustrialist in Poland and accumulating wealth were not exactly what the German Reich would\neventually lead into. That is that the Jews would eventually be killed and he would have to either",
        "stand on the side of Germans or else he would have problems. So he probably some place along\nthat line began to figure out things that unless he appears as an extremely loyal German, he will\nnot be able to conduct his business and he will not be able to save anyone. There is no doubt in\nmy mind that he began to look upon the potential of ending the war and unless he had friends on\nboth sides, he wasn\u2019t going to make it. The rest of the war, he spent appearing extremely loyal to\nthe Germans and at the same time appearing as \u2014acting as a friend of the Jews and inmates of\nthe concentration camp.\nNow, your story, we left you in Bomberg in 1945. How did you get to America?\nI arrived in Bomberg, Germany on March 13, which happens to coincide with the date of the\nliquidation of the Krakow ghetto in 1943. I arrived in Bomberg in March 13, 1949 [?].\nIn Bomberg?\nIn Bomberg. Where I settled and began to continue my education which I interrupted in 1939.\nThe way I have done that is by private tutoring from a German professor of a university who\nundertook to meet with me and continue my education. This continued education eventually led\nme to apply to an engineering school in Neurenberg where I was eventually rejected as not either\nbeing well-prepared enough or not having enough room to accommodate everyone. I also at the\nsame time had to support myself and I began work at the UNRRA, for UNRRA in warehouses\nwhere we were distributing food to other DPs. In 1946, Ada Birnbaum with her family of Edith,\nFred, Ann Birnbaum and Joe Birnbaum arrived in Bomberg, Germany. At that time, I met Ada\nand her family and we established a friendship, a courtship. I established the friendship and\ncourtship with Ada Birnbaum. I continued my education and working for the UNRRA in\nGerman and I also began working in a radio-phonograph repair shop where I learned the trade of\nrepairing small appliances. All through this time, I kept company with Ada Birnbaum. In 1949, I\nleft Germany for the United States. I traveled by a former troop transport ship, United States\nJumper, arrived in United States in 1949. Ada Birnbaum and her family arrived in the United\nStates about three months later in June of 1949. In 1950, we were married in New York and lived\nuntil 1951 in New York City. I continued working in woodworking shops and furniture shops\nand Ada began work as a seamstress in the garment center in New York. Eventually in 1951,\nAda\u2019s parents bought a farm in Flemington, New Jersey where they moved to. Since our roots\nwere not very deep in New York, making a living was difficult, in fact. Both Ada and myself\ndecided to move to Flemington, New Jersey where her parents were already settled at a chicken\nfarm. I began work as a carpenter in the Flemington area. I became a union member, a\ncarpenters\u2019 union member and was able, in fact, to make a decent living in Flemington. Our first\nchild was born in 1952, that is David; our second child was born in 1955, that is Barbara, and the\nthird child was born, also in Flemington in 1963 and that is Henry. I continued my work as a",
        "carpenter for a while. In 1953, I established a construction business which began operating as the\nfirm of Reemer (?) and Urbach. That business\u2014that partnership lasted until 1959. From 1959\non, I began operating the business, the same building construction business as Urbach and Urbach\nin Flemington. My oldest son is married to Zeborak Kohane (c. 040) and they have three\nchildren, Rebecca, Simon, Jonathan. They now reside in Cape Cod, (c. 045) Cape Cod\nwhere David is a cardiologist at the hospital and has a private practice of a group of five. Barbara\nis married to Michael Listner (ph. c. 046) now residing in Crescent, New Jersey. Barbara is an\nattorney, graduated from (c. 048) University and her husband is also an attorney.\nThey have two children, one is Samuel and the daughter is Elise. They both practice law in New\nJersey and New York. The youngest one, Henry, is single. He is a graduate of Princeton\nUniversity, went on to Columbia Law School where he finished a successful first year of law\nschool. Decided that he did not like law, transferred into architecture, graduated with honors\nfrom the School of Architecture in Columbia and at present, in 1992, is entering a Ph.D. program\nin architecture at Princeton University.\nSounds like congratulations are in order. I certainly can add that you are a very young-looking\ngrandfather.\nThank you very much. It was a little bit of a trip again, to do that, but it had to be done.\nI thank you on behalf of the Museum for your time and for your story.",
