        "A: When? Before the war?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: We lived in a little small town in Zamgala. My father was a well-to-do man. He was a\nfarmer. He was...by education, he was a agronome. You know when a tree is sick, he always\ngave an injection and made the tree well. We had cows and we had horses and we had\nsheeps. We had maids and dogs and cats and chickens. You know, like a farm. And we lived\nvery happy and the kids was growing up nicely and it was a wonderful childhood. I\nremember my childhood, a very, very nice childhood. I don't remember sufferings or\nanything. They...my parents loved each other very much, and so love was spread all over our\nfamily. The children was loving each other, and it was beautiful. Beautiful.",
        "Q: Did you have brothers and sisters?",
        "A: Yes, I did have a younger brother and I have a 8...8 years older sister.",
        "Q: And then conditions started to change. What were your first recollections?",
        "A: There was no change. We lived wonderful and peaceful and Latvia was a free country, you\nknow. Just like a America. We...we lived very peaceful and very, very nicely.",
        "Q: And then?",
        "A: Then in 41, the...the Russians occupied our country. Because you know, Latvia belongs to\nthe Baltic States, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania and in all these three countries was the same\nwonderful life like in America. But in 41, the Russians occupied the country, and it was war\nand it was terrible, and when they settled already in the Baltic States, they confiscated\neverything. The house and the animals and the gardens. My father has about 10 apple gardens\nwhat he was, you know, collected the fruits and was selling and made good money about\nthat. They collected, nationalized...they nationalized everything. So my father was just...we\nwas poor. We have nothing absolutely. The children was going to school to... was going to a\nLatvian school and my father was working. I don't remember something very...I can't... don't\nknow how you say that in English. He was just watching something in...on a...house. I don't\nknow how to say that in English. And the children was going to school, my sister and me.\n[...I attended a Latvian school. Also there was other schools that my parents sent me to a\nLatvian school and I learned languages there and it was for one year, we was starving. It was\na terrible time. Everything was difficult with food and then after a year, the Germans came\nover. When the Germans came over, we moved to Riga. We didn't live from the beginning in\nRiga. We...from the beginning we did live, then we moved back to.. to the Zamgla. Then we\ncame back. When the Germans came, we moved back to Riga because the Germans was\ncollecting all the Jews in one spot because they opened up in...1n Riga ghetto where they\nwanted people to...to settle, the Jewish people. But from the beginning when we moved\nto...to Riga, we had a nice apartment. We had a four room apartment and that was still in\nthe...in the Russian time. The end of...before the Germans came in, we moved to Riga. And\nwe settled in that apartment until the...the Germans came in. And when the Germans came\nin, they threw us out of this apartment in that ghetto. A ghetto is a place, a section\nsurrounded by iron _Draht [wire], iron.",
        "Q: Fence?",
        "A: Fence. Yeah. By iron fence and all the Jews was put together there, lived together. And we\nhad one single room in a cellar\n01:05:\nwhere we all...not my brother, my mother, my sister, my...my father and me we lived there.\nThere was no toilet, no water, no electricity. Nothing! So there was...they took us there\nwhere we...we settled when the Germans til...til my parents was killed. I mean I...I just\nescaped because I.... am surviving.",
        "Q: How did you get your food in the ghetto?",
        "A: Yeah. The...the...the Germans gave us some kind of a ration, you know, little piece of bread\nand...and kind of soup and we did have to stay in long, long lines to get our rations. I\ndon't...in English you say rations?",
        "Q: Rations.",
        "A: Rations. Yeah. The bread was so small like 3 fingers when you put together that was all what\nit is. It was...we was starving. The people who was going out to work in town, they could get\nfrom somebody...from the Latvians some...sometimes give you a little something, a little\npiece of bread. Bread was extremely important because bread was the main food and or a\ncandle because we didn't have electricity. But coming back in the ghetto, that was a big\nproblem because on the gate, the Germans was searching you and you didn't...you was not\nallowed to bring in the ghetto anything. Nothing! Because they themselves needed cigarettes\nand...and soap. Soap was a big problem because we had lice. We had lice all over. And we\nwant to wash ourselves. There was difficulties with water and7 o'clock, there was\nthe...the...the time when you had to be in your place. You cannot go out. If 8 o'clock, if they\nfind you on the street, you are dead. They shoot you on the...on the spot. So my mother didn't\nwork because my mother had a problem with the ulcers. She had a ulcers problem. She was\nsick, but my father was getting out to work and my sister was working and the children...I\nwas then 12 years old...13, 12...1 was working in a shoe factory. Uh...The Russians have\nbomb...bombarded a shoe factory, so there was a, a old, you know...the whole house...the\nwhole factory was in shambles so we did have to clean up all the...the dirt and the...the\nstones, to schlepp [drag] the stones away and mostly children was working there. And then\nthe shoe...the shoe Schmier [polish], the little boxes, we did have to put from the good boxes,\nthe Schmier back in the...from the bad broken boxes in...1n...in the good boxes, and then we\ndid have to on a...on a candle, a fire, we did have to turn it around and make it even that it\nlooks like new. And it was a very a dangerous job because it 1s...1t affect our health. We was\ncoughing and sneezing. It is...1t is some kind of...I don't know what it is...that all the childrens\nget sick after that. But we did have to work there. That's what they...and in the evening, they\ntook us back to the ghetto and when we was there, sometimes somebody give you a piece of\nbread or...or a carrot, sometimes beans, you know. This...it was difficult with...food was\nextremely difficult.",
        "Q: What were your feelings as a child then?",
        "A: I didn't understand what's going on. I think if I would be, older, I would commit...commit\nsuicide. I couldn't go through that. Then I thought it is not real. I think because I had my\nmother, I had my father and you know, I was working. What's the difference? I...a child don't\nunderstand much. Also, I was pretty mature I must say for my age. But we was going from\nthe work back to the ghetto and...and that's the way we lived until the final call. The final call\nwas November... November. What does it mean the final call? I'll explain to you. There was\noutside a big, big sign: ALL PEOPLE, ALL JEWS HAVE TO GATHER TOGETHER\nAND TAKE THEIR BEST THINGS, THEIR BEST THINGS, AND WHATEVER IN\nSACKS, INRUCKSACKS, WHATEVER BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO BE\nTRANSFERRED TO A DIFFERENT, TO A DIFFERENT PLACE. So we didn't make a\ndeal out of it. It's supposed to be the next morning, 5 o'clock or\n4 o'clock in the morning. So I remember overnight, my father took...told us to take a pillow\ncase with towels to make a rucksack. A rucksack...how do you say in English, a rucksack?",
        "Q: That's right.",
        "A: A rucksack. Yeah. And we put all our best things there because we believed that we are\ngoing to transferred to Salaspils, what...what was a bigger concentration camp. So we was\npeacefully. We didn't think that we are going to be harmed or anything. I mean there was\nplenty of killings all the time in the ghetto. Because you see some parents lived there in this\nsection and the children live in the other section, and the parents and the children wanted to\nmove together. So if you are out after 7 o'clock or 8 o'clock, they kill you. And it was\nshooting. I remember...I hear remember the whole night was shooting and shooting and\nshooting. People was sounds of...of...of shooting people, and that was people who wanted to\nrun around to my daughter or I will run to my dad or to my brother, you know.\nPeople...people wanted to get together or to go to that new concentration camp together. And\nso we also sewed the whole night. My mother, my sister and me, we sewed all the time the\nsacks and put the best things. Because...not because we...we just wanted to exchange for\nbread because bread was the biggest thing there. It's like a house. Because we was\nconstantly, constantly hungry. And then 4 o'clock in the morning, the Germans came armed\nwith...with the whips and \"Raus, Raus, Raus.\u201d They screamed all the time, \"Raus.\u201d This\nmean \"Get out. Get out. Get out.\u201d And so they...they threw us all out in the garden where we\nsit together altogether these people to gather together. There we...we tried to be together\nbecause my father had a brother there, Uncle Arthur with his wife and two children, my\ncousins. So we was lucky. We tried to stay together. We wanted to live all to...because my\nfather was very close to his brother. That's the only brother he ever had. And then when all\nthe people was...you know, there was screams and yells and the...the...the tragedy was that\nthe...the men who was capable to work, they couldn't go with their wives or with their\nmothers or with their children. They was putting in in a special little ghetto. They called that\nthe little ghetto. There was...this was called a man's...man's ghetto, but in my... in my\nparticular line in that thing where we...we was was mostly old people, old women, mothers\nwith children, with little children. There was a mother who had a baby on her hand and three\nchildren on her...holding on on her because her husband was in the other ghetto. And you\nknow, when we passed by we saw them and they were screaming and calling names\nand...my wife, my child...you know, by their name, \"Frieda, Frieda, Sascha, Manya, you\nknow. They...they...because we...we was gathered altogether 1n a...on the Chaussee, on the\nbig Chaussee to go somewhere. We didn't know where we go. We thought we are going to\nSalaspils to a concentration camp. We...we hoped so. So we was in that big line. There was\n30,000 people. 30,000 people! I didn't know that. They only later somebody told me that\nthere in this particular aktion was 30,000 people. There was two aktions 1n...in Latvia. I was\nin the first, but then was in December the other one. Now I am going to just tell you about\nthe first aktion. This is what happened in the first aktion. So we was on that Chaussee. There\nwas blood and snow in November. You know, it snowed and I remember it was squashing,\nsquish, squish... blood and snow, blood and snow, and there was...you know, on the side was\npeople. I...I thought it's...1t's wood, but this was not wood. That was dead bodies piled up on\neach other like a mountain. I say...from the...because it was 4 o'clock in the morning. It was\ndark. You couldn't even see real good. So then I saw these are people. That was not wood at\nall. So we straightened out on that...that Chaussee...I think it was 10 people in...in a row, you\nknow, like...as...as breit [broad] as the Chaussee, I think it was 10 or 9 people or I cannot\nremember really. And it was a big, big line. We was one of the last ones who...who was who\nwas joining that...that line. And we start walking. On each side was German, Latvian, so...so\nNazis, with their Totenkopf, with the dead skull on their hat, and with a...with a...with\na...with revolvers. How you call that? With guns. Yeah. On each side, you know, and with\nthe...with the whips. Go. Go. Schnell Schnell, you know, because there was old people. They\ncouldn't walk. The little children crying. They...it was cold. It was freezing. They wanted\nMama, Mama, Mama. And the Mama has a baby on her...on her...this 1s... cannot explain to\nyou what that was. It is disgusting. You just looked, and you couldn't understand\nwhat...what's going on. So when we was walking about maybe a half an hour, suddenly from\nthe first line...from the first line, we heard that we are turning in on left. Turning in, not going\nstraight because I don't know, but people knew where Salaspils is. This 1s a different, total\ndifferent way. We was turning in...in the left and from the first road the people was\nscreaming, \"We are not going to Salaspils. They are going to kill us. They are taking us to\nRumbula, Rumbula. I didn't\neven know what Rumbula is then Rumbula is woods, woods. So the first line, surely the\nGermans people start screaming and yelling and some people was running, starting running\nand as they were shoot on the spot, so the...the whole group...the whole 30,000 people left in\nthe woods, in that Rumbula woods till I saw what it was there. Because we were one of the\nlast ones. Not...not really, but almost. There was already a...a Yama...how do you say that?",
        "Q: Pit?",
        "A: A pit. Yeah. A big pit and the sand was already taken out on both sides. Yellow sand. I\nremember it was in winter, but it was just fresh...fresh, black and...and yellow sand you\nknow. So make the story shorter, 1t was a pit. It was a pit. And in the other side, I saw\nLatvians...I'm sorry, Latvians and German Polizei with...with guns like a...with, you know,\nlike tut, tut, tut, tut, tut, like this. And we did have to undress ourselves. In one mountain was\nthe...the...the clothes, the...the coats, and one mountain was the shoes, and one mountain was\njewelry. There's a box with jewelry. Later, the Germans took it back and...and confiscated all\nthis stuff. They...they used it. But we did have to make it very neat, you know. Very neat.\nWhen...when somebody was making not so accurate, you get with that whip and the...all the\ntime they scream: Schnell, schnell sich ausziehen [Fast fest, get undressed]. The people was\nhesitating to...some people went over to the Germans, say, \"You know, I am married to a\nLatvian. I am married to a Latvian. I am married to a German\". Just to explain, \"I am not\nJewish. I am not Jewish.\u201d And they didn't even listen to this. I'm not Jewish or Jewish. \"Sich\nauszichen, sich ausziehen\". But I will tell you about our line. So my father, my mother, my\nUncle Arthur, his wife and two children, me and my sisters stands there, and I already took\noff my coat. I had a beautiful coat my...my father bought me and I loved my coat so very\nmuch, but I already took my coat off. In the same minute when I did that...I...we don't know\nfrom where and where, there was German officers, about four German officers on horses.\nAnd said...they said: \"Halt, nicht schiessen, nicht schiessen, Ich brauche Schweiderinnen\".\n\"Don't shoot. Don't shoot. I need seamstresses. I need seamstresses\". Women, if you can\nsew, come here.\u201d\u201d My Mom grabbed me and my sister because she supposed to understand\nGerman. She speaks Yiddish. Yiddish is like German. It is very close. She said: \"Ich bin eine\nO1:18:\nSchneiderin, Ich kann naehen.\u201d \"I am a seamstress. My children can sew. Please take us.\nTake us.\u201d So she grabbed me. You know in such a moment, she wasn't thinking about my\nfather, about the uncle and she just grabbed me and my sister and we run over...I grabbed\nmy...schlepped my coat with me and run over to these Germans. And there was other\nwomen, \"Schneiderinnen, Schneiderinnen \" it...it was about 200 women. About 200 woman\nwas the drop with these Germans. And so we stand also with the group and he turned\nthe...the Germans they was on horses. This I remember. On white horses. White and brown,\nsome kind. And and they turn us around and they say, \"You follow us.\u201d So we were sure that\nthey need for their factory seamstresses. And we are going to be saved because at least we\nare going to be saved on that particular killing you know. So we followed them, and they\ntook us I don't know where and you know, they took us to a prison. And the name of the\nprison is Termina. Termina prison. It's still in Latvia. Stilll is there. And the Germans went in\nand they opened up the door and all these two 200 woman went in in that prison and the\nGermans disappeared. Until today, I don't know where they are. And we have never, ever\nworked as seamstresses. Never! Till today, I don't know who they are. Is this a God's miracle\nor they was partisans or they was who? They just saved 200 women. Now, the story in the\nprison. Because we are Jews, we couldn't get a normal room with...with, you know, with\na...with a...you call it a __commada. You know, you have a commada where you can lie\ndown. You have a...a straw sack and you have a straw pillow like...like prisoners usually do.\nNow, they took us on top on the attica, and the attica was a open place. You know, an\nopenly...you know what a attica is. A open place. No ceiling. You...you put up your head and\nyou see the Heaven is there, you know. And in November, usually, in Latvia is snow and\ncold and...and freezing. And we was in that attica about 3 weeks. We was...lived..lived there.\nLike herring in...1n..1n...1n a...1n a box, you know. We was sitting on each other. We was\nsleeping together. And you know all this...I think it's 2 or 3 weeks. I really don't remember\nthat. I remember it was before December. There was not one single snow, not one single\nrain. The sun was shining. It was beautiful and warm. Nobody froze. Nothing! You know, in\nmy later years, I was thinking, \"God, did you do that?\" Usually, November, it was...you...you\nwear a peltz [fur]. It's so freezing cold in Latvia. It was beautiful. The sun in the...during the\nday, the sun was in the...night the...the...the...the...the sky was beautiful, clean with the stars.\nI remember I was lying and looking in the stars, counting the stars. It was like summer. It\nwas magnificent. Nobody get even sick. Nobody. Only we was lice. I remember I...I was\nlying down and saw lice coming over me. I have never seen so...such big lice, the way I have\nthem on my coat. And I told my Mom, \"Look at these lice.\u201d She said, \"Good. Good.\u201d She\nsay, \"Don't worry about the lice. You are alive. Good.\u201d My Mom believed in God all the\ntime. And she was in that prison upstairs in that attica the only one who had two children\nwith her, so she was quiet with her mouth. She didn't say a word. She was happy that she has\ntwo children with her because the other woman didn't have no children,\nnobody, they were \"uno\", by themselves there. And so there was jealous on my mother and\nsay, \"You are talking. What are you talking? You have two children with you.\u201d You know, it\nwas such...such a jealousy between the woman and the madness and one beautiful night, you\nknow, a woman gave a birth to a girl, to a baby girl. Can you imagine? Oh, I will never tell\nthis will something absolutely dreadful. That little kid...kid. A girl! And you know, that she\ndidn't even cry because the mother was so hungry she barely had milk. So everybody was\naround the children. I remembered my mother gave her underskirt, you know, to...to cuddle\nin the child and...and somebody was cutting off the...the...the...the, you know, how you call\nthat...I don't know. A little kid...what...",
        "Q: A cord.",
        "A: A cord. Yeah. A cord. And we...we...we was hiding that because when the Germans would\nknow that there is a kid...and you know we hide that girl. Later she came...they killed her\nanyway. But the...the...the girl's name was Termina. And she was in the ghetto still till the\nsecond aktion. She was still alive, and then she was also killed with her mother, when it was\nthe second aktion. So we was here all the time till the ghetto was cleaned out and after the\nghetto. There was a lot of clothes and...and everything, you know, left and...and...and good\nthings and when we...then they took us back...back to the ghetto to prepare for the next\nkilling because there was two aktions. This was the first. This is coming the first...the\nsecond. And you know, I was a girl. I was not going to work. Women didn't go to work, only\nmen. So I stay all...all the time by the women's ghetto by the gate and was looking how in the\nmorning, 5 o'clock in the morning, the people...the men...only men's groups...only men's\ngroups was going out to work, going out to work. And it come to mind I have to run. What\nI'm going to stay here? Because there will be killing. When I will tell that my mother will\nnever let me do it. I wanted out. I wanted out. I wanted out. It was terrible. It was nothing to\ndo the whole day. Just...just wait...waiting for death you know. Everybody was when\nI'm...when I'm going to kill you. They killed them in December, beginning of December, and\nI run away. In meanwhile, they brought from...from Kaunas from Vienna, from Holland,\nfrom Muenster, from France other Jews to kill them here because as I later heard\nthe...the...the Holland people say, \"You want to kill them. Take them out. We are not going\nto.\u201d Latvia was the only country who accepted every other country's Jews to be killed. That\nis the truth.",
        "Q: So you...you were standing at the gate watching the people.",
        "A: So I was standing by the gate and watching, but you know, only men could go out, not\nwoman. I am a girl so I did need men's clothes. I needed men's clothes. So I went upstairs\nand was looking. There was all over the place ghetto was clothes as much as you want.\nKilled the people and...and the...the clothes what they bring back from that aktion, you\nknow. Clothes was was like this. You can have them. There...there was a lot of clothes. And\nI put on a pair of pants and, uh...a big jacket I remember such a...and in a hat with...with like\na dog hat, with...with flaps here, to look like a boy. And then one morning...that particular\nmorning, I stand on the gate. Gail, I have to tell you something. Everybody asks me, \"How\ncould you get out of that gate when there was projectors on you? There was German Polizei\nwith guns walking. Six people this way and six people this way. No way could you get out of\nthis. Not be seeing you. They have to see you. You couldn't open up the gate and get out by\nyourself. You could not do it because it was light...like a daylight. It was 5 o'clock in the\nmorning. It was very dark. But the projectors was so loud and you know, light that you...you\njust couldn't. They have to see you. And I opened up the gate and I went...wait...waited\nwhere the men's ghetto groups comes out and I ran in in that group and the men surrounded\nme because they knew what I'm doing. They surrounded me. I was not so tall. I was not so\nhigh. They surrounded me and I went out with the group to town. I went to town. And when\nI was 1n the town, I did have a Magen David here and a Magen David tn the back, so the\nman in the back took off my Magen David and tells me, \"Take off the Magen David on the\nfront. Take off and don't go in the middle of the street,\" because Jews was going, you know,\nin the middle of...of the street. Only not a Jews can go on the trottoir [sidewalk], you know.\nSay, \"Take off on the front there the Magen David and go...go on the trottoir. Don't go in the\nmiddle. Go on the trottoir.\u201d So I jumped on the trottoir, and the man who was...you know,\nthey have a",
        "Q: Sidewalk.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Sidewalk?",
        "A: I was on the trottoir. The trottoir, how do you say in English?",
        "Q: Sidewalk.",
        "A: The sidewalk. So I went on the sidewalk when the group went away. So here I was, 4 or 5\no'clock in the morning. Dark. I was so scared and I looked, you know, like...like a\nSchornsteinfeger [chimney sweep] . You know, what you put in the field and birds are\nafraid. How you call that? You put it you know like this. It stays like.",
        "Q: [scarecrow |",
        "A: Yeah, you know. I looked awful. Everybody was standing around and looking at me. I\nlooked like really not real. So I knew I have to hide somewhere. I have to go somewhere. I\nremembered I was going over a station and there was...over a station because I was afraid to\nmeet somebody because everybody was standing around and looking at me. I was looking\nnot real. People don't...not dressed like me. And then I...I was walking, walking and\nsweating, you know. I was so scared. Basically, I wanted to go to our maid. We had a...a\nBaptist woman who was working years ago with...with my father, so I wanted to go to her\nhouse. I remember I know where she was living. And I didn't even mean to...to get 1n...must\nbe I was walking already couple of hours because it was getting light. It was getting...and I\nknew I have to hide. I have to go. I cannot go on like this. So I saw a little gate, and I went\non in the gate. That was a house. I will show you. I have the picture of the house andthere\nwas wood wood, so I...at first, I...1 hide behind the woods just to catch my breath, you know.\nIt was just so...I didn't know what to do, where to go and...and I was tired and scared and\nsweaty. And then in that house, there was I saw a door. So I thought, \"I'm going to knock on\nthat door because maybe\n01:29:\nthere are good people. Maybe there are Russian people. Maybe they will help me.\u201d So I\nknocked on the door and suddenly I heard two dogs barking, you know, Shepherd dogs. And\nonly the Germans did have Shepherd dogs. Nobody else. They was going, you know\nand...and looking with the dogs where there are Jews are hiding or partisans were hiding so I\nwas sure I did something dreadful. And...and...and the...the dogs was crying terribly, but\nsuddenly I heard a woman's voice in the Russian, ___to the dogs, like \"Stop the barking.\nStop barking,\" in the Russian language. I said, \"Oh, My God. This is maybe Russian people.\nSo I was running back to the woods...to the...the woods. Then I came there was logs. You\nknow, logs in English. Logs. Yeah. Behind the logs. Then I came back and knocked a second\ntime on the door. And the second time, a man came to the door and...and in...in Russian: Kto\ntam? who is there? And I tell him: Otkrivaetz, otkrivaets. And I tell him, please, open.\nOpen,\" in Russian. And he opened the door and here stands a man, so about 40 years old,\nmaybe 39. I don't...I'm not really sure. So about and...say you know, \"I run away from the\nghetto. Can I be in your place for awhile?\" I tell him that in Russian. And he looked at me\nfor a moment. He say, \"Come in my child. You will be with me.\u201d Then he took me in the\nkitchen, seated me on the table and give me food. I was starving. I was so hungry. He gave\nhe a glass with warm milk. I will never forget that, and a big piece of black bread. Latvians\nbake their breads themselves. It was so delicious. Till today, I will never throw out a piece of\nbread as long as I live. And he told me, said he had yesterday a vision. God spoke to him.\nGail, maybe you don't believe me, but that man is alive and he can tell you the same thing.\nAnd God told him that a humanbeing will knock on your door. Take...take it in. Don't be\nafraid and save that person's life. I will be with you all the time through. I swear to God if I\nlie. That's what he told me. But then I believe in a God like you believe in \" Ich waiss wos\". I\ndidn't believe him. I cuckoo, meshuge. He was a religious person, and he told...and he\nrepeated that all the time, you know. You can ask him. He will tell you. He did have a vision.\nHe didn't know that I am going to be the one. He thought maybe a old Jew will come or\nmaybe a...a soldier, a Russian soldier. The Germans were treating the Russian soldiers\ndreadful. They was starving on the streets. They was absolutely starving, these...these poor\nRussian soldiers. But 1t was me, and he thought that I am the one. And he told me...I told\nhim, \"I don't want to stay in your house. I will go to my Nanny.\u201d He said, \"No. No. You will\nstay right here and I will save your life.\u201d I didn't want to do it, but...because he didn't let me\ngo away. And in that particular farm family was his father, his mother, his sister, and his\nsister's husband who was...they...they was all beautiful people. They took me in without any\nproblem. Only had the sister's...the sister's husband was a alcoholic, and they was afraid that\nbeing a alcoholic he can start babbling, you know, and telling. You know, my...my wife 1s\nsaving a Jewish girl. That's all what they was very much afraid. But he was...he didn't do that\nso he didn't do that. So now he was thinking how to save my life. How to...to be around in\nthe house was not really good. He needs a ...a cellar or something. So because the...the house\nwhere...where they lived, they had five...five rooms in five room apartment, and a parquet\nfloor. You know a parquet floor? Yeah?",
        "Q: Wooden, parquet floor.\n01:33:",
        "A: Wooden...wooden parquet floor. So in that particular bedroom where I was hiding, he made\na hole for me. He broke the...the...the parquet floor not big as my body is that I can myself\nput in and hide there. So he...he took a shovel and took the earth out and because the\nGermans was doing a garage in...in...1n out of the house so he couldn't take the sand out\nand...and put it right there. You know how he did that. He put a big coat and put the sand in\nhis pocket. Can you believe hundred times he was going back and forth, back and forth, back\nand forth, till he made me a little bunker. It was as big as I. Know, I was...I don't know how\nto say, 5 feet or something like this. Not a big one. I just did put down my body and sit there\nlike that crumpled, you know, and sit there. You know, I can sit...I mean stretch my...my\nfeet. And then if there was..uh..a danger, I took that...that little top myself and it was with\nlittle...I...",

You know, a table with a big table cloth because the Germans when they came and\nthey did came, they didn't look for me but they looked for his...something else happened. It's\na different story. I just want to finish this one. Uh...So and a vase on top so nobody could\nknow where...that's even somebody is hiding in that place. Surely if the Germans would be\ncoming with dogs, they would find me with no questions asked. But God loved me and God\nwanted to leave me alive, so they came without dogs. This is other story I will tell you some\nother time. So in that particular hole I sat for 3 years. 2 years and 8 months for...for exact\ntill...the...the...the Russians came in and took it over.",
        "Q: Let's...",

        "Q: Did you come out during the day or what did you do?",
        "A: During the day because I...you know there is no oxygen in...in...1n that hole and it is wet and\ndamp. Also, he put me a mattress there and he put his mother's fur coat there you know. He\ntried to do the best he could you know. And only when...when somebody was knocking on\nthe door, you know, like the super. The supers was the worst because they was working for\nthe Germans and for every Jew's head...there was a lot of hiding I mean. I was not the only\none __. I was...he was...let...didn't let me go by the window. I didn't look through the\nwindow in 3 years not even once. The curtains was down and you know I was bored the\nwhole time there.

And\nyou know, they are...they are ____. They are...there has to be funerals and everything and I\nam in the house. I couldn't do it you know. It was very complicated. But the worse thing was\nthat I had toothaches...toothaches. Such tooth aches I needed a doctor you know. I had such\ntooth pain that it...so I colored my hair blonde. That's what he wanted me to do.

Regularly the man did it. The way he came in. The way he\ncame out. And you know when the Russians says to me, \"How did you do that?\" You know\nwhat the answer you say, \"In the Bible says such a word if God wants he makes you blind,\nand you don't see it.

        "A: Yes. Yes. What I... The most important thing was when he went into the ghetto...not always\nhe went through the ghetto you know. Only once he did that. The other time he was crawling\nunder the ghetto...under the...the...the...wire...wires, the...how you call these wires?",

And she was a porcelain painter. She was\npaint..painting porcelain, and she was working on a factory. Kuznibor is the name of the\nfactory. She was painting vases and plates and she was a marvelous.

But because she's Russian, and the people are Russian, so she also bring food to them\nand...and befriended them you know. And there was was two guys whom she wanted to\nhelp. So she bring him to the house....to our house. I saw him through the door. You know, I\nopened up the door and I saw a little bit of them. I remembered how they looked. They didn't\nknow that I am there. They didn't tell them that they're hiding a Jewish girl there. So L..1\nwas...I saw him. And...My priest get them priest clothes and false documents and we wanted\nthem to go Resikecky you know you took...to bring them over to the Russian area so they\ncould go or to the partisans or somehow closer to the Russians you know, and they wanted to\nsave their life. Everybody knew. No, his father and mother were stilll alive. I'm sorry. Then\nwhen...when they saved these two people, the father and the mother was not dead yet. Only\nher husband was dead. So they bring him in that house. They clothed him in that priest's\nclothes, get him the documents, and let him go. The Gestapo catched him not far from the\nborder and took him back to the Gestapo. And they scalped them. They scalped them. So at\nnight at 3 o'clock in the morning...we already had...we didn't know nothing. Somebody came\nthe day before and told Olga...Olga is the name of the...of the woman who did that...to\ndisappear because there will be definitely a...a blava...how you call that?",
        "Q: Search.",
        "A: A search. So she disappeared. We didn't even know where she is. So they come not to look\nfor me. They come for\n01:47\nparticular Olga. So 3 o'clock in the morning: \"Aufmachen\" Banged the door. \"Aufmachen\"\nAnd I'm in bed. You know, I'm sleeping in the bed. So they...they have to hold on the door\nuntil I'm in the...in the...in the pit till I close the...the top, till they put the table on top, till they\ntable cloth on top, till they put the base on top. And \"Aufmachen, aufmachen, aufmachen\".\nSo everybody, you know, is out of breath and scared. Aufmachen! So they surrounded the\nwhole house. They surrounded...inside maybe 6...6 police looking, looking, \"Where 1s Olga\nKatzinova? Where is Olga Katzinova?\" And his mother speaks fluent German. She say, \"She\nis not here. She don't live even here. She...she went 2 weeks ago. We saw where she comes\nand goes we have no idea.\u201d And and he was touching every bed, every bed and surely you\nknow people just 3 o'clock the beds are warm. He say, \"Who slept in this bed?\" So Elizabeth\nIrina, the mother, say, \"My dog. My dog.\u201d She has two dogs. \"My dog slept in that bed.\u201d\nAnd then she...he found a pant...my panties, you know my little panties.\u201d He said, \"Is this the\ndog's panties.\u201d \"No,\" she said, \"this is my panties.\u201d Because she was very tiny. She was a\ntiny woman. And they turned the house around, and they arrested my priest, the father and\nthe mother and Valodya, all...all of them. And I'm in the cellar by myself with the two dogs\nupstairs. And how long can I stay there inside. I have no air. I have to get out. And the...the\ntwo dogs are \"hmm hmm hmm hum,\" go around. You see, Gail, what I want to tell you is 1f\nthey would come with dogs, they would find me because the dogs would smell me out you\nunderstand. That miracles that God send the Germans without the dogs. Isn't this something?\nTell me. They never...they always came with dogs. Always! But this time they didn't. So\n[...I...1 count that a God's miracle again, and I can tell you about miracles more and more and\nmore. And they arrested the whole house and I was by myself in that cellar with the two\ndogs. Now I think to myself, \"Maybe there is a German upstairs waiting till Olga comes\nhome. I cannot open up. They will find me. What should I do? How long can I stay? I was\nalready without breath.\u201d And then I called, Chippie, Biggie. This is the names of the dogs.\nAnd if those dogs come to me, around me, \"Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm,\" because I know when\nthere would be a German that these dogs was trained to bark on Germans. She trained them\nto bark mostly on Germans. They didn't bark. Nothing! So I say, \"There must be nobody.\u201d\nAnd they was hungry. I have to give them some food. So I open up my little top and I went\nout and there was nobody. But what not? Now they are arrested. And this was I will\n01:50:\ntell you 6 o'clock in the morning. They...they was searching for 2 hours. They arrested...now\nfollow me. Six o'clock in the morning, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...nobody! I was\nalone. I didn't know what to do. What should I do? Now they are dead. I know the Gestapo\nwill not let them come back. They are dead. What I'm going to alone in that big house. You\nknow...you know I didn't know what to do. I...I was dying. I...I...] have to go back to the\nghetto. Six o'clock in the evening they all came back home. Aw, he was worrying about me,\nand I was worrying about them. You can imagine what a welcome it was to both of us. We\nwas hysterically crying and...and...and his mother and father kissed me and hugged me and\noh, they was such beautiful people. I'm telling you I have never met in my life that kind of\nfine people as they was. So they came back and they told me they was taken to the Gestapo\nand they saw these two soldiers, these Russian...Russian war prisoners. They was scalped.\nThey was scalped. They didn't recognize them. And they asked, \"Do you know them? You\nknow...this is ____. This 1s eye to eye witness. They say, \"We never saw him.\u201d They...they\nwas hitting them and...and beating them and they say, \"No, we have never...we don't know\nthem who they are. We don't if Olga did? We have no idea. But we have never seen them.\u201d\n\"Didn't you give them the clothes? Didn't you give them the passport? Didn't you...\u201d They\nsay, \"No, no, no, no, no.\u201d \"I think that's lie.\u201d Also they tortured them, tortured them, then let\nthem go. They was blue and green when they came home. So that was one of the biggest\nhappiness when they came back to me. And that's...that's one of the biggest. But then\nthey...this was other searches, but not this one because they surrounded the whole house and\nSO.\n01:52:\nAnd I did have to be careful. I...I...I liked to look through the window.

We had\neverything. We was working. My husband was working. Then...",
        "Q: Then you stayed how long in Riga?",
        "A: We was fighting with the Russians for 15 years. Thirty six times they refused us to get out.\nThey didn't give us a permission. We was one of the very, very first. We wanted out. My\nhusband wanted out because he was in Russia. That's the way he survived. He was in Russia.\nHe came back after the war as a soldier. And he survived only that, and he hated them guts.\nHe wanted back and out of here. So we found his mother. What we didn't even know that she\nis alive. We thought that she is also dead. Because you know, it was such a chaos during the\nwar. When the Russians came in, people was evacuating and and my father didn't want to go\nto the Russia, because he hated the Communisms, and that's why we went... Maybe if my\nfather would, you know, evacuate together with us, maybe he would be even alive. But that\nhappened. He didn't love them and he didn't want them. And in the first war, the...the\nGermans was not bad. They treated their war...war people very good. So my father said, \"I'm\nnot going to go,\" and that's why we didn't go.

        "A: Our commandant's name was Donskopf. I remember that name. Donskopf Nobody 1s\nlooking for him. I have calls. Maybe I know this and maybe that name and that name, but\nthis name I know particular nobody is looking for him. I don't know why. He was our ghetto\ncommandant, and his name is Donskopf. And my sister in her letters name his name too. So\nthis Donskopf was coming over andI remember when we came over, he always looked at\nme. I think he liked children. I mean I was not a child. I was, you know, pretty good\ndeveloped. And he came in and we have a oven, a little stove where we was making tea or\nsomething, you know, because the stove was heated with wood. And my mother...in that\nroom was living my mother, Mrs. Schapiro, a girl by the name Mary, I and my sister, and a\nother woman also and then later she moved out. And when they came in, they was looking,\n\"Do...do you have...\u201d There was four policei, Latvians. There was no Germans. They was\nLatvians. They came in and was, \"Do you have cigarettes. Do you have bla, bla, bla.\u201d And if\nyou don't give it to them, then they search and that's worse. And then I was standing then in\nthe front and he told me to undress. To undress naked. Naked! And you know, I didn't want\nto do it, but my mother spoke in Latvian to me, \"Do it. Do it.\u201d ____- She stayed in back of\nme and she said, \"Undress,\" in Latvian to me. And I undressed. I was just in my panties. And\nhe told me to take a chair and to get up on the stove. And I...I was...the stove was up about so\nhigh. Not higher for me. I was on the stove and I did have to jump from the stove. Then he\ntold me to get up the stove again and to jump on the stove. And then I...I jumped about\nmaybe 7 times. I don't remember the count. And then they turned around and went away.\nThey didn't rape me. Didn't do nothing. Just look at me. How I was doing that. Isn't this\nsadism? Isn't this sadism? This is real sadism you know? Why did they do this? What for?\nWhat pleasure did they have in that? I can't understand. And then the other episode\nwith...what I will never forget.",
        "Q: Thank you. Yeah. We're going to change tapes now.\nTape #2",
        "Q: You were going to tell us about your experiences.\n02:03:",
        "A: Yeah. I want to tell you just one more story. Uh...We were standing in line getting our bread,\nour ration bread. It was so small, you know, that you know you can...you have to drip(?) it to\neat it. I don't know. How big is that? Three fingers wide. So we did have to stand in the line,\nand I was standing with my mother in the line, usually one of the last ones. And there...there\nwas only old people, old man, old woman because the younger was...was working. The old\npeople usually was standing in line whatever they was giving us. Suddenly, for no\nreason...for no reason, the German brown shirts with their death...death sign on their hats,\nSD...I don't know what the name is, came on motorcycles and start whipping these old\npeople with a whip so badly. For no particular reason! They beat them and beat them and the\npoor people was falling on the floor...floor. My mother grabbed me and we had 1m a...in a\ndoor in...in a house...in a house door. And I was seeing that with my own...own eyes how\nthese people...everybody who was standing in line was whipped so hard. They couldn't...they\nwas running. They was falling on the floor. The way they came they beat up the people. The\nway they ran away with the motorcycles. Tell me why. What is it? Isn't that sadism? This\nepisode also stays in my mind all the time.",
        "Q: Were there any other experiences in the ghetto like that?",
        "A: Uh...Plenty, but I don't want to talk about it. I don't. I can't. It upsets me. I don't want it. Ask\nme something else.",
        "Q: Not even one, one other...",
        "A: I cannot tell you. Shootings and killings. You walk over. You...you...you think it is...1s a\npiece of log. No, it's a dead man.",
        "Q: Is there anything else that you wanted to...to add.",
        "A: I want also to tell that I am not perfectly cured from all that. I see I have\nnightmares...I...many times. It is like yesterday. It is 45. 50 years already. It is like yesterday.\nI see all the things over and over. I...1 wake up in my bed all sweat and the Russians... mean\nRussians no, the Germans are after me. They hit me with the whips. They whip me, whip\nme. Once they whip me when I came in and they found a...what did they find in my...I think\na candle. You know, we didn't have lights, so I found...about | candle, he hit with the whip\nthat my feet was swollen with...with such things my feet was. Why did they whip me for?\nBecause they took away...they found in my pocket a candle. This all...always comes back.\nThat always comes back. And you know what I notice on myself. I was in show business and\nI have had in Latvia a fantastic life. I go to parties, and I go to, you know, movies and\neverything I did. And you know, I was always sad. I was always sad. I put on a face. I was\ndancing. I like to dance and...and so I am not in drugs and never drink. I don't smoke. Never.\nNever did I do that. And I...I pray when I am in a bad mood. I pray and that...that...that I take\nout my...and I love music. Music is my drug. I adore music. But you know I am always until\ntoday, that sadness don't go away from me. The sadness is always with me. I...I go out...I'm\ninvited and I look at these people and say, \"Boy, they don't know nothing what I know.\u201d\nThey would...sometimes my daughters throws out bread or the children, \"I don't like this. I\ndon't like that.\u201d It makes me sick to my stomach. I will never throw out anything. I\nremember all the times that there were so many hungry people. They would give their lives\nfor a piece of bread you know. Bread is... You will see the letters, bread, bread, bread. This is\nlike...like a house, like a car, like diamonds. And this never let me go, you know. I speak to\ndoctor sometimes. I...I...I...I feel sad. And you know I...God made such a miracle with me. I\nhave traveled. I came to America. I had a job. I was invited. I meet beautiful people, show\nbusiness. I love show business. Here I met Placido Domingo, Pavarotti. I 2? I worked\nwith...I\nseen Karayan. I have seen every opera in the world. I was in every opera house. You know,\nthis is what I like. I have...whatever I ask, God gives to me. He give it to me. I want to travel.\nI have no money. He makes I have money. I go with travel. I wanted to go to Jamaica. I go to\nJamaica. I wanted to go Paris. I go to Paris. He does it. I am not rich. Not at all. He does it.\nDon't ask me. He does it. But I am always sad. I go to these places and I am sad. In my\ninside, I am not cured. I am always sad. This is you know like a stamp, like a stamp. How\nyou say that? You know, like a \"Staempel\" on my soul. This is it. And it breaks my heart my\ndaughter don't understand that. My grandchildren...they have their own life. I don't want\nthem to understand because it's a sad story. It is sad... am happy that they are happy. I want\nthem to be only happy. Really. I mean it. But I need...you know, sadness need company. I\nneed somebody to...to have pity on me a little bit. And...uh...all the people with whom I was\ntogether are dead or they are somewheres where I cannot reach them or they don't want to\ntalk about that. I have met people. I say, \"You was with my sister. Why don't you tell me\nsomething about her?\" \"Don't ask me. I will not tell it.\u201d I say, \"Come over. I want to know\nhow she died.\u201d \"No.\u201d And she don't come. And there is a person who knows. And there are a\nlot of people who can come and tell you stories and they don't because it is terrible, terrible\npainful. It 1s painful. I'm doing it because I think that maybe we'll take that sorrow off my\nsoul. Because I have two things what I have to put the Valodya name in Yad Vashem. It's my\nduty. And if I can also, his sister's name, and I have to give the letters to the Holocaust\nMuseum. This is my duty. Maybe I will feel better after that. I am always sad. And always I\nlike crying kind of. (Crying) (Sigh) (Pause) And I will tell you I'm sorry I'm alive. I'm\nashamed. I am absolutely ashamed that I'm alive because why did all these people have to\ndie? Who is me? Why did God pick up me? I don't like this world. I am from a different era.\nThis is not my time to live. I am compassioned, with feelings, with...with caring. The world\nis not like that right now. It is rude. It is dirty. I can't stand dirty language. I don't belong. I\nwant to go back. I...I talk to God every day. Take me back. Take me back. It is not my time\nto go. I understand that. But I am not happy in this world. I mean to go out and...and I don't\ngo out because I don't like 1t what I see. I can't stand drugs. I cannot...dirty language kills me.\nYou know I...my time 1s Renaissance. I am...1 am born in wrong time. And I feel guilty that I\nam alive and other people are dead. Each time I eat, I thank God. I go to the American\nsupermarket. I am here in this country with 25 years very soon. Okay? I cannot understand\nso much of everything. It is so beautiful this country. When I will die, I will ask God to send\nme right back to America. And people don't cherish that. America! America! You know I\npunched in the mouth one person. I can't hear that word that America is bad. The best! The\ntops! The only one! And that's what I feel. I feel sad. And something else I wanted to tell you\nvery much. I believe in God. I was not a believer at all, and don't everybody forget, 1t was by\na priest and the priest didn't influence. Not true. He didn't influence me about nothing.\n02:11:\nHe 1s an evangelist. You know, he...respects the Old Testament and the New Testament and\nhe should live 1n Israel. He's more Jewish than you and me together. He is a wonderful\nperson to talk to him. But he's old and he...always he says, \"I didn't save your life. God saved\nyou.\u201d And you know, getting older I start thinking about the miracles. The magnificent\nmiracles what happened to me. Like I was in...1n...1n prison. One beautiful appell. You have\nto stand in line. One person goes left, one person right, one person goes left, one person goes\nright. We knew that one of this line is going to be killed because there's too much people\nthere so they have to kill somebody. So I went left. My sister, my mother went right. My\nsister went left. Yeah? I run over to the...I know that she's going to be dead. I knew. Don't\nask me how. I have a intuition from my childhood. I knew what is bad or what is good. Like\nsomebody tells me that I am born in. I have till today. I can look at you and I can read\nyour...your... your horoscope. I have a intuition. So I ran over to the Germanit was\nWehrmacht man. It was not a Nazi. It was a soldier. I said, \"Please let my mother come in\nmy line. Please because my sister 1s there.\u201d He said, \"Okay.\u201d And he didn't say, \"No.\u201d And\nmy mother...and all these people where my mother was in line was dead, and we survived.\nAnd if they ever created ?? in these letters, you will see that when I have my sister's last\nletter...this is a very important letter. There is the date and the time and the year when they\nwere evacuated from that working platz, where they was working for the Emheit. And she\nwrites right now we don't have...a...I mean the...the cars are not ready, so maybe we will stay\nand I will you a other letter. But if not, this is my last letter and I tell you goodbye. Oh, this is\njust a...[...I was hysterical when I read that. You will see the letters are the most...I am not\nimportant. The most important thing is my sister's letters. You will see how they was living\nin ghetto when I was having a warm place to live and eat and everything. I feel guilty.\nGuilty! Guilty! But why did God pick me up from all these 30,000 people I have no idea. I\nhave no idea. I am not such a girl. I wasn't listening to my mother many times but maybe he\nthought that... I...I start thinking about the miracles when I was getting older. You know\nbecause God was always on my mind. Always on my mind! I thought something must be\nmore than all this what I see. There must be...there must be a...sure it is not a God with a\nbeard and...and...and sitting in his chair as a child as I thought it is. But when somebody ask\nme, \"You and your God.\u201d You know people don't like when\nyou say that. \"Caroline, You're a modern woman. What is going on with you? God. God.\nWhat is God?\" So I tell them, \"Do you know what is love? Could you tell me? Please, tell\nme what 1s love? How can you...destiny needs that. Destiny...what is love? To me, God is\nlove. The all good things is God.\u201d And I start thinking, \"How did I get out of the ghetto?\nHow? How? With all the projectors, with all the Nazis there?\" I did. How did I know that I\nhave to go in this line and not in this line. Why did the Germans came on their horses and\ntook me away from that killing spot in the prison? How? Why? And you know I could tell\nyou millions of this moments. Millions. I could write now. Miracle, miracle, miracle,\nmiracle, miracle, miracle. I start thinking, \"Hey. This is not real. This is miracles. And\nsomebody did that. Not you did it. God did it.\u201d And I started to believe in it so that of today\nif you ask me, \"Caroline, what is your biggest desire? What do you...would like to know. Do\nyou want to travel? Do you want steaks? Do you want fish? Tell me what do you want?\nDiamonds? Clothes? Furs?\" I have it. I don't want it. I have it all the steaks in the world. I\nhave all the best fish in the world. I have traveled all over the... You know what I want? If\nyou ask me, I will tell you, \"What I want of today, I want to know God better.\u201d This is the\nonly thing what I don't know. Everything I have searched and I know there is nothing.\nNothing. I know that I know nothing. That I can say. I want to know God better. He is love.\nAnd this world is without love.",

You know when a tree is sick, he always\ngave an injection and made the tree well. We had cows and we had horses and we had\nsheeps. We had maids and dogs and cats and chickens. You know, like a farm. And we lived\nvery happy and the kids was growing up nicely and it was a wonderful childhood. I\nremember my childhood, a very, very nice childhood.

        "A: There was no change. We lived wonderful and peaceful and Latvia was a free country, you\nknow. Just like a America. We...we lived very peaceful and very, very nicely.",
        "A: Then in 41, the...the Russians occupied our country. Because you know, Latvia belongs to\nthe Baltic States, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania and in all these three countries was the same\nwonderful life like in America. But in 41, the Russians occupied the country, and it was war\nand it was terrible, and when they settled already in the Baltic States, they confiscated\neverything. The house and the animals and the gardens. My father has about 10 apple gardens\nwhat he was, you know, collected the fruits and was selling and made good money about\nthat. They collected, nationalized...they nationalized everything. So my father was just...we\nwas poor. We have nothing absolutely. The children was going to school to... was going to a\nLatvian school and my father was working. I don't remember something very...I can't... don't\nknow how you say that in English. He was just watching something in...on a...house. I don't\nknow how to say that in English. And the children was going to school, my sister and me.\n[...I attended a Latvian school. Also there was other schools that my parents sent me to a\nLatvian school and I learned languages there and it was for one year, we was starving. It was\na terrible time. Everything was difficult with food and then after a year, the Germans came\nover. When the Germans came over, we moved to Riga. We didn't live from the beginning in\nRiga. We...from the beginning we did live, then we moved back to.. to the Zamgla. Then we\ncame back. When the Germans came, we moved back to Riga because the Germans was\ncollecting all the Jews in one spot because they opened up in...1n Riga ghetto where they\nwanted people to...to settle, the Jewish people. But from the beginning when we moved\nto...to Riga, we had a nice apartment. We had a four room apartment and that was still in\nthe...in the Russian time. The end of...before the Germans came in, we moved to Riga. And\nwe settled in that apartment until the...the Germans came in. And when the Germans came\nin, they threw us out of this apartment in that ghetto. A ghetto is a place, a section\nsurrounded by iron _Draht [wire], iron.",
        "A: Fence. Yeah. By iron fence and all the Jews was put together there, lived together. And we\nhad one single room in a cellar\n01:05:\nwhere we all...not my brother, my mother, my sister, my...my father and me we lived there.\nThere was no toilet, no water, no electricity. Nothing! So there was...they took us there\nwhere we...we settled when the Germans til...til my parents was killed. I mean I...I just\nescaped because I.... am surviving.",
        "A: Yeah. The...the...the Germans gave us some kind of a ration, you know, little piece of bread\nand...and kind of soup and we did have to stay in long, long lines to get our rations. I\ndon't...in English you say rations?",
        "A: Rations. Yeah. The bread was so small like 3 fingers when you put together that was all what\nit is. It was...we was starving. The people who was going out to work in town, they could get\nfrom somebody...from the Latvians some...sometimes give you a little something, a little\npiece of bread. Bread was extremely important because bread was the main food and or a\ncandle because we didn't have electricity. But coming back in the ghetto, that was a big\nproblem because on the gate, the Germans was searching you and you didn't...you was not\nallowed to bring in the ghetto anything. Nothing! Because they themselves needed cigarettes\nand...and soap. Soap was a big problem because we had lice. We had lice all over. And we\nwant to wash ourselves. There was difficulties with water and7 o'clock, there was\nthe...the...the time when you had to be in your place. You cannot go out. If 8 o'clock, if they\nfind you on the street, you are dead. They shoot you on the...on the spot. So my mother didn't\nwork because my mother had a problem with the ulcers. She had a ulcers problem. She was\nsick, but my father was getting out to work and my sister was working and the children...I\nwas then 12 years old...13, 12...1 was working in a shoe factory. Uh...The Russians have\nbomb...bombarded a shoe factory, so there was a, a old, you know...the whole house...the\nwhole factory was in shambles so we did have to clean up all the...the dirt and the...the\nstones, to schlepp [drag] the stones away and mostly children was working there. And then\nthe shoe...the shoe Schmier [polish], the little boxes, we did have to put from the good boxes,\nthe Schmier back in the...from the bad broken boxes in...1n...in the good boxes, and then we\ndid have to on a...on a candle, a fire, we did have to turn it around and make it even that it\nlooks like new. And it was a very a dangerous job because it 1s...1t affect our health. We was\ncoughing and sneezing. It is...1t is some kind of...I don't know what it is...that all the childrens\nget sick after that. But we did have to work there. That's what they...and in the evening, they\ntook us back to the ghetto and when we was there, sometimes somebody give you a piece of\nbread or...or a carrot, sometimes beans, you know. This...it was difficult with...food was\nextremely difficult.",
        "A: I didn't understand what's going on. I think if I would be, older, I would commit...commit\nsuicide. I couldn't go through that. Then I thought it is not real. I think because I had my\nmother, I had my father and you know, I was working. What's the difference? I...a child don't\nunderstand much. Also, I was pretty mature I must say for my age. But we was going from\nthe work back to the ghetto and...and that's the way we lived until the final call. The final call\nwas November... November. What does it mean the final call? I'll explain to you. There was\noutside a big, big sign: ALL PEOPLE, ALL JEWS HAVE TO GATHER TOGETHER\nAND TAKE THEIR BEST THINGS, THEIR BEST THINGS, AND WHATEVER IN\nSACKS, INRUCKSACKS, WHATEVER BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO BE\nTRANSFERRED TO A DIFFERENT, TO A DIFFERENT PLACE. So we didn't make a\ndeal out of it. It's supposed to be the next morning, 5 o'clock or\n4 o'clock in the morning. So I remember overnight, my father took...told us to take a pillow\ncase with towels to make a rucksack. A rucksack...how do you say in English, a rucksack?",
        "A: A rucksack. Yeah. And we put all our best things there because we believed that we are\ngoing to transferred to Salaspils, what...what was a bigger concentration camp. So we was\npeacefully. We didn't think that we are going to be harmed or anything. I mean there was\nplenty of killings all the time in the ghetto. Because you see some parents lived there in this\nsection and the children live in the other section, and the parents and the children wanted to\nmove together. So if you are out after 7 o'clock or 8 o'clock, they kill you. And it was\nshooting. I remember...I hear remember the whole night was shooting and shooting and\nshooting. People was sounds of...of...of shooting people, and that was people who wanted to\nrun around to my daughter or I will run to my dad or to my brother, you know.\nPeople...people wanted to get together or to go to that new concentration camp together. And\nso we also sewed the whole night. My mother, my sister and me, we sewed all the time the\nsacks and put the best things. Because...not because we...we just wanted to exchange for\nbread because bread was the biggest thing there. It's like a house. Because we was\nconstantly, constantly hungry. And then 4 o'clock in the morning, the Germans came armed\nwith...with the whips and \"Raus, Raus, Raus.\u201d They screamed all the time, \"Raus.\u201d This\nmean \"Get out. Get out. Get out.\u201d And so they...they threw us all out in the garden where we\nsit together altogether these people to gather together. There we...we tried to be together\nbecause my father had a brother there, Uncle Arthur with his wife and two children, my\ncousins. So we was lucky. We tried to stay together. We wanted to live all to...because my\nfather was very close to his brother. That's the only brother he ever had. And then when all\nthe people was...you know, there was screams and yells and the...the...the tragedy was that\nthe...the men who was capable to work, they couldn't go with their wives or with their\nmothers or with their children. They was putting in in a special little ghetto. They called that\nthe little ghetto. There was...this was called a man's...man's ghetto, but in my... in my\nparticular line in that thing where we...we was was mostly old people, old women, mothers\nwith children, with little children. There was a mother who had a baby on her hand and three\nchildren on her...holding on on her because her husband was in the other ghetto. And you\nknow, when we passed by we saw them and they were screaming and calling names\nand...my wife, my child...you know, by their name, \"Frieda, Frieda, Sascha, Manya, you\nknow. They...they...because we...we was gathered altogether 1n a...on the Chaussee, on the\nbig Chaussee to go somewhere. We didn't know where we go. We thought we are going to\nSalaspils to a concentration camp. We...we hoped so. So we was in that big line. There was\n30,000 people. 30,000 people! I didn't know that. They only later somebody told me that\nthere in this particular aktion was 30,000 people. There was two aktions 1n...in Latvia. I was\nin the first, but then was in December the other one. Now I am going to just tell you about\nthe first aktion. This is what happened in the first aktion. So we was on that Chaussee. There\nwas blood and snow in November. You know, it snowed and I remember it was squashing,\nsquish, squish... blood and snow, blood and snow, and there was...you know, on the side was\npeople. I...I thought it's...1t's wood, but this was not wood. That was dead bodies piled up on\neach other like a mountain. I say...from the...because it was 4 o'clock in the morning. It was\ndark. You couldn't even see real good. So then I saw these are people. That was not wood at\nall. So we straightened out on that...that Chaussee...I think it was 10 people in...in a row, you\nknow, like...as...as breit [broad] as the Chaussee, I think it was 10 or 9 people or I cannot\nremember really. And it was a big, big line. We was one of the last ones who...who was who\nwas joining that...that line. And we start walking. On each side was German, Latvian, so...so\nNazis, with their Totenkopf, with the dead skull on their hat, and with a...with a...with\na...with revolvers. How you call that? With guns. Yeah. On each side, you know, and with\nthe...with the whips. Go. Go. Schnell Schnell, you know, because there was old people. They\ncouldn't walk. The little children crying. They...it was cold. It was freezing. They wanted\nMama, Mama, Mama. And the Mama has a baby on her...on her...this 1s... cannot explain to\nyou what that was. It is disgusting. You just looked, and you couldn't understand\nwhat...what's going on. So when we was walking about maybe a half an hour, suddenly from\nthe first line...from the first line, we heard that we are turning in on left. Turning in, not going\nstraight because I don't know, but people knew where Salaspils is. This 1s a different, total\ndifferent way. We was turning in...in the left and from the first road the people was\nscreaming, \"We are not going to Salaspils. They are going to kill us. They are taking us to\nRumbula, Rumbula. I didn't\neven know what Rumbula is then Rumbula is woods, woods. So the first line, surely the\nGermans people start screaming and yelling and some people was running, starting running\nand as they were shoot on the spot, so the...the whole group...the whole 30,000 people left in\nthe woods, in that Rumbula woods till I saw what it was there. Because we were one of the\nlast ones. Not...not really, but almost. There was already a...a Yama...how do you say that?",
        "A: A pit. Yeah. A big pit and the sand was already taken out on both sides. Yellow sand. I\nremember it was in winter, but it was just fresh...fresh, black and...and yellow sand you\nknow. So make the story shorter, 1t was a pit. It was a pit. And in the other side, I saw\nLatvians...I'm sorry, Latvians and German Polizei with...with guns like a...with, you know,\nlike tut, tut, tut, tut, tut, like this. And we did have to undress ourselves. In one mountain was\nthe...the...the clothes, the...the coats, and one mountain was the shoes, and one mountain was\njewelry. There's a box with jewelry. Later, the Germans took it back and...and confiscated all\nthis stuff. They...they used it. But we did have to make it very neat, you know. Very neat.\nWhen...when somebody was making not so accurate, you get with that whip and the...all the\ntime they scream: Schnell, schnell sich ausziehen [Fast fest, get undressed]. The people was\nhesitating to...some people went over to the Germans, say, \"You know, I am married to a\nLatvian. I am married to a Latvian. I am married to a German\". Just to explain, \"I am not\nJewish. I am not Jewish.\u201d And they didn't even listen to this. I'm not Jewish or Jewish. \"Sich\nauszichen, sich ausziehen\". But I will tell you about our line. So my father, my mother, my\nUncle Arthur, his wife and two children, me and my sisters stands there, and I already took\noff my coat. I had a beautiful coat my...my father bought me and I loved my coat so very\nmuch, but I already took my coat off. In the same minute when I did that...I...we don't know\nfrom where and where, there was German officers, about four German officers on horses.\nAnd said...they said: \"Halt, nicht schiessen, nicht schiessen, Ich brauche Schweiderinnen\".\n\"Don't shoot. Don't shoot. I need seamstresses. I need seamstresses\". Women, if you can\nsew, come here.\u201d\u201d My Mom grabbed me and my sister because she supposed to understand\nGerman. She speaks Yiddish. Yiddish is like German. It is very close. She said: \"Ich bin eine\nO1:18:\nSchneiderin, Ich kann naehen.\u201d \"I am a seamstress. My children can sew. Please take us.\nTake us.\u201d So she grabbed me. You know in such a moment, she wasn't thinking about my\nfather, about the uncle and she just grabbed me and my sister and we run over...I grabbed\nmy...schlepped my coat with me and run over to these Germans. And there was other\nwomen, \"Schneiderinnen, Schneiderinnen \" it...it was about 200 women. About 200 woman\nwas the drop with these Germans. And so we stand also with the group and he turned\nthe...the Germans they was on horses. This I remember. On white horses. White and brown,\nsome kind. And and they turn us around and they say, \"You follow us.\u201d So we were sure that\nthey need for their factory seamstresses. And we are going to be saved because at least we\nare going to be saved on that particular killing you know. So we followed them, and they\ntook us I don't know where and you know, they took us to a prison. And the name of the\nprison is Termina. Termina prison. It's still in Latvia. Stilll is there. And the Germans went in\nand they opened up the door and all these two 200 woman went in in that prison and the\nGermans disappeared. Until today, I don't know where they are. And we have never, ever\nworked as seamstresses. Never! Till today, I don't know who they are. Is this a God's miracle\nor they was partisans or they was who? They just saved 200 women. Now, the story in the\nprison. Because we are Jews, we couldn't get a normal room with...with, you know, with\na...with a...you call it a __commada. You know, you have a commada where you can lie\ndown. You have a...a straw sack and you have a straw pillow like...like prisoners usually do.\nNow, they took us on top on the attica, and the attica was a open place. You know, an\nopenly...you know what a attica is. A open place. No ceiling. You...you put up your head and\nyou see the Heaven is there, you know. And in November, usually, in Latvia is snow and\ncold and...and freezing. And we was in that attica about 3 weeks. We was...lived..lived there.\nLike herring in...1n..1n...1n a...1n a box, you know. We was sitting on each other. We was\nsleeping together. And you know all this...I think it's 2 or 3 weeks. I really don't remember\nthat. I remember it was before December. There was not one single snow, not one single\nrain. The sun was shining. It was beautiful and warm. Nobody froze. Nothing! You know, in\nmy later years, I was thinking, \"God, did you do that?\" Usually, November, it was...you...you\nwear a peltz [fur]. It's so freezing cold in Latvia. It was beautiful. The sun in the...during the\nday, the sun was in the...night the...the...the...the...the sky was beautiful, clean with the stars.\nI remember I was lying and looking in the stars, counting the stars. It was like summer. It\nwas magnificent. Nobody get even sick. Nobody. Only we was lice. I remember I...I was\nlying down and saw lice coming over me. I have never seen so...such big lice, the way I have\nthem on my coat. And I told my Mom, \"Look at these lice.\u201d She said, \"Good. Good.\u201d She\nsay, \"Don't worry about the lice. You are alive. Good.\u201d My Mom believed in God all the\ntime. And she was in that prison upstairs in that attica the only one who had two children\nwith her, so she was quiet with her mouth. She didn't say a word. She was happy that she has\ntwo children with her because the other woman didn't have no children,\nnobody, they were \"uno\", by themselves there. And so there was jealous on my mother and\nsay, \"You are talking. What are you talking? You have two children with you.\u201d You know, it\nwas such...such a jealousy between the woman and the madness and one beautiful night, you\nknow, a woman gave a birth to a girl, to a baby girl. Can you imagine? Oh, I will never tell\nthis will something absolutely dreadful. That little kid...kid. A girl! And you know, that she\ndidn't even cry because the mother was so hungry she barely had milk. So everybody was\naround the children. I remembered my mother gave her underskirt, you know, to...to cuddle\nin the child and...and somebody was cutting off the...the...the...the, you know, how you call\nthat...I don't know. A little kid...what...",
        "A: A cord. Yeah. A cord. And we...we...we was hiding that because when the Germans would\nknow that there is a kid...and you know we hide that girl. Later she came...they killed her\nanyway. But the...the...the girl's name was Termina. And she was in the ghetto still till the\nsecond aktion. She was still alive, and then she was also killed with her mother, when it was\nthe second aktion. So we was here all the time till the ghetto was cleaned out and after the\nghetto. There was a lot of clothes and...and everything, you know, left and...and...and good\nthings and when we...then they took us back...back to the ghetto to prepare for the next\nkilling because there was two aktions. This was the first. This is coming the first...the\nsecond. And you know, I was a girl. I was not going to work. Women didn't go to work, only\nmen. So I stay all...all the time by the women's ghetto by the gate and was looking how in the\nmorning, 5 o'clock in the morning, the people...the men...only men's groups...only men's\ngroups was going out to work, going out to work. And it come to mind I have to run. What\nI'm going to stay here? Because there will be killing. When I will tell that my mother will\nnever let me do it. I wanted out. I wanted out. I wanted out. It was terrible. It was nothing to\ndo the whole day. Just...just wait...waiting for death you know. Everybody was when\nI'm...when I'm going to kill you. They killed them in December, beginning of December, and\nI run away. In meanwhile, they brought from...from Kaunas from Vienna, from Holland,\nfrom Muenster, from France other Jews to kill them here because as I later heard\nthe...the...the Holland people say, \"You want to kill them. Take them out. We are not going\nto.\u201d Latvia was the only country who accepted every other country's Jews to be killed. That\nis the truth.",
        "A: So I was standing by the gate and watching, but you know, only men could go out, not\nwoman. I am a girl so I did need men's clothes. I needed men's clothes. So I went upstairs\nand was looking. There was all over the place ghetto was clothes as much as you want.\nKilled the people and...and the...the clothes what they bring back from that aktion, you\nknow. Clothes was was like this. You can have them. There...there was a lot of clothes. And\nI put on a pair of pants and, uh...a big jacket I remember such a...and in a hat with...with like\na dog hat, with...with flaps here, to look like a boy. And then one morning...that particular\nmorning, I stand on the gate. Gail, I have to tell you something. Everybody asks me, \"How\ncould you get out of that gate when there was projectors on you? There was German Polizei\nwith guns walking. Six people this way and six people this way. No way could you get out of\nthis. Not be seeing you. They have to see you. You couldn't open up the gate and get out by\nyourself. You could not do it because it was light...like a daylight. It was 5 o'clock in the\nmorning. It was very dark. But the projectors was so loud and you know, light that you...you\njust couldn't. They have to see you. And I opened up the gate and I went...wait...waited\nwhere the men's ghetto groups comes out and I ran in in that group and the men surrounded\nme because they knew what I'm doing. They surrounded me. I was not so tall. I was not so\nhigh. They surrounded me and I went out with the group to town. I went to town. And when\nI was 1n the town, I did have a Magen David here and a Magen David tn the back, so the\nman in the back took off my Magen David and tells me, \"Take off the Magen David on the\nfront. Take off and don't go in the middle of the street,\" because Jews was going, you know,\nin the middle of...of the street. Only not a Jews can go on the trottoir [sidewalk], you know.\nSay, \"Take off on the front there the Magen David and go...go on the trottoir. Don't go in the\nmiddle. Go on the trottoir.\u201d So I jumped on the trottoir, and the man who was...you know,\nthey have a",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: I was on the trottoir. The trottoir, how do you say in English?",
        "A: The sidewalk. So I went on the sidewalk when the group went away. So here I was, 4 or 5\no'clock in the morning. Dark. I was so scared and I looked, you know, like...like a\nSchornsteinfeger [chimney sweep] . You know, what you put in the field and birds are\nafraid. How you call that? You put it you know like this. It stays like.",
        "A: Yeah, you know. I looked awful. Everybody was standing around and looking at me. I\nlooked like really not real. So I knew I have to hide somewhere. I have to go somewhere. I\nremembered I was going over a station and there was...over a station because I was afraid to\nmeet somebody because everybody was standing around and looking at me. I was looking\nnot real. People don't...not dressed like me. And then I...I was walking, walking and\nsweating, you know. I was so scared. Basically, I wanted to go to our maid. We had a...a\nBaptist woman who was working years ago with...with my father, so I wanted to go to her\nhouse. I remember I know where she was living. And I didn't even mean to...to get 1n...must\nbe I was walking already couple of hours because it was getting light. It was getting...and I\nknew I have to hide. I have to go. I cannot go on like this. So I saw a little gate, and I went\non in the gate. That was a house. I will show you. I have the picture of the house andthere\nwas wood wood, so I...at first, I...1 hide behind the woods just to catch my breath, you know.\nIt was just so...I didn't know what to do, where to go and...and I was tired and scared and\nsweaty. And then in that house, there was I saw a door. So I thought, \"I'm going to knock on\nthat door because maybe\n01:29:\nthere are good people. Maybe there are Russian people. Maybe they will help me.\u201d So I\nknocked on the door and suddenly I heard two dogs barking, you know, Shepherd dogs. And\nonly the Germans did have Shepherd dogs. Nobody else. They was going, you know\nand...and looking with the dogs where there are Jews are hiding or partisans were hiding so I\nwas sure I did something dreadful. And...and...and the...the dogs was crying terribly, but\nsuddenly I heard a woman's voice in the Russian, ___to the dogs, like \"Stop the barking.\nStop barking,\" in the Russian language. I said, \"Oh, My God. This is maybe Russian people.\nSo I was running back to the woods...to the...the woods. Then I came there was logs. You\nknow, logs in English. Logs. Yeah. Behind the logs. Then I came back and knocked a second\ntime on the door. And the second time, a man came to the door and...and in...in Russian: Kto\ntam? who is there? And I tell him: Otkrivaetz, otkrivaets. And I tell him, please, open.\nOpen,\" in Russian. And he opened the door and here stands a man, so about 40 years old,\nmaybe 39. I don't...I'm not really sure. So about and...say you know, \"I run away from the\nghetto. Can I be in your place for awhile?\" I tell him that in Russian. And he looked at me\nfor a moment. He say, \"Come in my child. You will be with me.\u201d Then he took me in the\nkitchen, seated me on the table and give me food. I was starving. I was so hungry. He gave\nhe a glass with warm milk. I will never forget that, and a big piece of black bread. Latvians\nbake their breads themselves. It was so delicious. Till today, I will never throw out a piece of\nbread as long as I live. And he told me, said he had yesterday a vision. God spoke to him.\nGail, maybe you don't believe me, but that man is alive and he can tell you the same thing.\nAnd God told him that a humanbeing will knock on your door. Take...take it in. Don't be\nafraid and save that person's life. I will be with you all the time through. I swear to God if I\nlie. That's what he told me. But then I believe in a God like you believe in \" Ich waiss wos\". I\ndidn't believe him. I cuckoo, meshuge. He was a religious person, and he told...and he\nrepeated that all the time, you know. You can ask him. He will tell you. He did have a vision.\nHe didn't know that I am going to be the one. He thought maybe a old Jew will come or\nmaybe a...a soldier, a Russian soldier. The Germans were treating the Russian soldiers\ndreadful. They was starving on the streets. They was absolutely starving, these...these poor\nRussian soldiers. But 1t was me, and he thought that I am the one. And he told me...I told\nhim, \"I don't want to stay in your house. I will go to my Nanny.\u201d He said, \"No. No. You will\nstay right here and I will save your life.\u201d I didn't want to do it, but...because he didn't let me\ngo away. And in that particular farm family was his father, his mother, his sister, and his\nsister's husband who was...they...they was all beautiful people. They took me in without any\nproblem. Only had the sister's...the sister's husband was a alcoholic, and they was afraid that\nbeing a alcoholic he can start babbling, you know, and telling. You know, my...my wife 1s\nsaving a Jewish girl. That's all what they was very much afraid. But he was...he didn't do that\nso he didn't do that. So now he was thinking how to save my life. How to...to be around in\nthe house was not really good. He needs a ...a cellar or something. So because the...the house\nwhere...where they lived, they had five...five rooms in five room apartment, and a parquet\nfloor. You know a parquet floor? Yeah?\n01:33:",
        "A: Wooden...wooden parquet floor. So in that particular bedroom where I was hiding, he made\na hole for me. He broke the...the...the parquet floor not big as my body is that I can myself\nput in and hide there. So he...he took a shovel and took the earth out and because the\nGermans was doing a garage in...in...1n out of the house so he couldn't take the sand out\nand...and put it right there. You know how he did that. He put a big coat and put the sand in\nhis pocket. Can you believe hundred times he was going back and forth, back and forth, back\nand forth, till he made me a little bunker. It was as big as I. Know, I was...I don't know how\nto say, 5 feet or something like this. Not a big one. I just did put down my body and sit there\nlike that crumpled, you know, and sit there. You know, I can sit...I mean stretch my...my\nfeet. And then if there was..uh..a danger, I took that...that little top myself and it was with\nlittle...I...",
        "A: What?",
        "A: No, not handles, like like...",
        "A: Hooks. I can hook with...with four hooks. And I was sitting there and then he put on top a\ntable. You know, a table with a big table cloth because the Germans when they came and\nthey did came, they didn't look for me but they looked for his...something else happened. It's\na different story. I just want to finish this one. Uh...So and a vase on top so nobody could\nknow where...that's even somebody is hiding in that place. Surely if the Germans would be\ncoming with dogs, they would find me with no questions asked. But God loved me and God\nwanted to leave me alive, so they came without dogs. This is other story I will tell you some\nother time. So in that particular hole I sat for 3 years. 2 years and 8 months for...for exact\ntill...the...the...the Russians came in and took it over.",
        "A: That's the story.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: During the day because I...you know there is no oxygen in...in...1n that hole and it is wet and\ndamp. Also, he put me a mattress there and he put his mother's fur coat there you know. He\ntried to do the best he could you know. And only when...when somebody was knocking on\nthe door, you know, like the super. The supers was the worst because they was working for\nthe Germans and for every Jew's head...there was a lot of hiding I mean. I was not the only\none __. I was...he was...let...didn't let me go by the window. I didn't look through the\nwindow in 3 years not even once. The curtains was down and you know I was bored the\nwhole time there. They put me books. They gave me books and...and",
        "A: You know what I did? I...I...I.... am...I crocheted. I like to crochet, and I did gloves you\nknow. I...I'm very handy. I can do it from...from school times. I was crocheting and heckling\nyou know and they were selling the...the gloves you know, and so we have a little bit...bit.\nBut I wrote a letter to a friend of my...my father's, a farmer woman and I will show you the\npicture. She really...she should be also in the Yad Vashem. And every second week she sent\na package to a different address, not to our address surely. No questions asked and thanks to\nher I...we can...we could survive. Because the rations what they get...his father, mother was\nso small, they didn't eat. They give it to me. They didn't eat.",
        "A: Uh...They...what they send us. They send us Speck what I would never eat again. Speck.\nWhat is speck? Fat You know, pieces of fat and then you make it with...with onions and then\nyou smear it on your bread. This was delicious you know. And then butter sometimes a\nlittle...a little honey only because the farmers in German time was...they have their own\nfarm. So whatever they send us, they saved our life. Not only that because that particular\nperson, the Valodya who saved my life, I told him that my Mom and my sister is still in the\nghetto so he went in the ghetto.",
        "A: In his house?",
        "A: Oh, yes. I did not in the cellar. When I did need the facilities, I... went to the...the toilet that\nwas in the room. And they had a shower. They had a...a bath. I...I took baths. Yes. They took\ncare of me you know. They was like my parents. But...but but the dreadful thing was\nduring...during the German time, the father died, the mother died, and her husband died. And\nyou know, they are...they are ____. They are...there has to be funerals and everything and I\nam in the house. I couldn't do it you know. It was very complicated. But the worse thing was\nthat I had toothaches...toothaches. Such tooth aches I needed a doctor you know. I had such\ntooth pain that it...so I colored my hair blonde. That's what he wanted me to do. He get me\nperoxide. I have dark hair. My natural hair is dark. And he gave me, get me a false passport,\nand my name was Irma Purinya because if they catch me on the street I could...I could show\nthat I am Irma Purinya, a Latvian you know. And they took me to a dentist. And the dentist\nfixed my tooth. And that's what he did. He did it. And he said, \"Don't be afraid.\u201d You know\nwhat he did else. One day he put in a Mogen David, a David Star here and a David Star in\nthe back. And he went right in the ghetto, pass the German gate, find my mother, find my\nsister, bring them food regularly. Regularly the man did it. The way he came in. The way he\ncame out. And you know when the Russians says to me, \"How did you do that?\" You know\nwhat the answer you say, \"In the Bible says such a word if God wants he makes you blind,\nand you don't see it. They didn't see me.\u201d That's what brought...that's what it is. And the same\nas when I went out of the ghetto of the gate. They did not see me. I went out. God...God's\nfinger.",
        "A: Yes, he brings...she gave him...sometimes she gave him some clothes you know because\nthere was all over the place dead people's stuff. And then we sold that, make some money\nand...uh.. It was a \"och und weh\" you know. It was...we just...I surely...I surely thought that\nthis 1s the end of the world because I will never believe that Hitler because he took\nCzechoslovakia and Poland and...and every country and nothing will be done. The\ncountry...the whole world was just watching looking what is going on. And sure he was\nwatching all the time the radio and what's going on the front andI...I thought I'm going to live\nlike that till my...end of my days. He said, \"No.\"",
        "A: Yes. Yes. What I... The most important thing was when he went into the ghetto...not always\nhe went through the ghetto you know. Only once he did that. The other time he was crawling\nunder the ghetto...under the...the...the...wire...wires, the...how you call these wires?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Barbed wires. Exactly. Barbed wires. Under the barbed wires, they had a particular place\nwhere...where it was Abendon (?). There where my daughter...daughter...my sister was\nmeeting him. She knows when to meet and also he came to the place where she was\nworking. That was better. In the place where she was working, they...they have a signal you\nknow that they was making signals. He knew when to come. They met and she was writing\nletters to me and I was writing letters to her, so she know what I...because she didn't even\nknow that I am alive and I run away. My mother was sure I was killed. Because there was\nshooting, shooting, shooting, and I was run...going around in the ghetto from one end to the\nother. I wasn't sitting on one spot, so Mom and sister was sure I'm dead. I'm dead. And then\nwhen...when my priest came and found them, I told them the address. And he told them that\nshe's...she's in my cellar. She is here. She's alive. You can imagine my Mom. She...she\ncouldn't\u2019 believe it how happy she was. So he took out letters from her and I have 10 letters\nfrom my sister written to me how they was surviving in ghetto. That's I'm also going to give\nto you.",
        "A: Oh, I wanted to go back to the ghetto. I wanted to be with my mother. And I wanted to be\nwith my sister. They was writing me such dreadful letters. I thought that I'm going to come\nto the ghetto, let my mother come to here. My mother was sick with ulcers. She couldn't eat\nnothing. She was losing weight and my...my sister and my mother was extremely close. I\nwas my father's daughter. I was Dad's girl, but she was very...and she wrote me that Mom 1s\nvery sick and medicine. They didn't have any medicine you know. Aw, she was very ill, my\nmother. And the moment she cannot work, my Mom would be...my Mom would be shot.\nThey don't need sick, old people. They don't need them. So my...my... my sister's letters was\nbreaking my heart and I wanted to go back. I thought it's so simple. I will go back to the\nghetto. Mom will come in place of me and the man will save her and I will go to...stupid you\nknow, but that's the way I wanted. And my sister was sending me terrible letters. \"Don't you\nbe dumb. You don't do that? How can you do such a thing? Mom will never change with\nyou, you know?\" And so you will read the letters. It's just... would...I wanted to go back. I\nwanted to go back. I wanted to be with my Mom.",
        "A: Uh...I had a contact only with the...No. There was a family, friends of...of my savior.\nHis...his friends and in...1n a case if I would be 1n danger here, I would maybe go to their\nhouse. But they didn't play a big role in my life, but...but I have their names and I'm very\nthankful because they also bring food and shared sometimes. I saw them. Yes.",
        "A: Yes, they did. They did. Not...not looking for me. Should I tell you that?",
        "A: Uh... You see basically, I have two saviors. That priest and his sister. These two people\nbasically saved because the parents died and her husband died, so I was left with these just\ntwo people who saved my life till the very end. And..uh...the sister...they are a very\nintelligent family you know. Her father was a tea representative in India, and the mother was\na painter. They...they are very intelligent people. And she was a porcelain painter. She was\npaint..painting porcelain, and she was working on a factory. Kuznibor is the name of the\nfactory. She was painting vases and plates and she was a marvelous. I have some plates\nhome in New York. And there was working a Russian...a Russian what is Vajena Pleinik (7).\nHow...how do you call that in English? Oh, God. I have...I needed that word.",
        "A: No. No. You have to know that. They are war...war...you know when Hitler look them, they\nare what? War... Help me?",
        "A: Prisoners of war? Exactly. There was working prisoners of war in that factory doing dirty\njobs. But because she's Russian, and the people are Russian, so she also bring food to them\nand...and befriended them you know. And there was was two guys whom she wanted to\nhelp. So she bring him to the house....to our house. I saw him through the door. You know, I\nopened up the door and I saw a little bit of them. I remembered how they looked. They didn't\nknow that I am there. They didn't tell them that they're hiding a Jewish girl there. So L..1\nwas...I saw him. And...My priest get them priest clothes and false documents and we wanted\nthem to go Resikecky you know you took...to bring them over to the Russian area so they\ncould go or to the partisans or somehow closer to the Russians you know, and they wanted to\nsave their life. Everybody knew. No, his father and mother were stilll alive. I'm sorry. Then\nwhen...when they saved these two people, the father and the mother was not dead yet. Only\nher husband was dead. So they bring him in that house. They clothed him in that priest's\nclothes, get him the documents, and let him go. The Gestapo catched him not far from the\nborder and took him back to the Gestapo. And they scalped them. They scalped them. So at\nnight at 3 o'clock in the morning...we already had...we didn't know nothing. Somebody came\nthe day before and told Olga...Olga is the name of the...of the woman who did that...to\ndisappear because there will be definitely a...a blava...how you call that?",
        "A: A search. So she disappeared. We didn't even know where she is. So they come not to look\nfor me. They come for\n01:47\nparticular Olga. So 3 o'clock in the morning: \"Aufmachen\" Banged the door. \"Aufmachen\"\nAnd I'm in bed. You know, I'm sleeping in the bed. So they...they have to hold on the door\nuntil I'm in the...in the...in the pit till I close the...the top, till they put the table on top, till they\ntable cloth on top, till they put the base on top. And \"Aufmachen, aufmachen, aufmachen\".\nSo everybody, you know, is out of breath and scared. Aufmachen! So they surrounded the\nwhole house. They surrounded...inside maybe 6...6 police looking, looking, \"Where 1s Olga\nKatzinova? Where is Olga Katzinova?\" And his mother speaks fluent German. She say, \"She\nis not here. She don't live even here. She...she went 2 weeks ago. We saw where she comes\nand goes we have no idea.\u201d And and he was touching every bed, every bed and surely you\nknow people just 3 o'clock the beds are warm. He say, \"Who slept in this bed?\" So Elizabeth\nIrina, the mother, say, \"My dog. My dog.\u201d She has two dogs. \"My dog slept in that bed.\u201d\nAnd then she...he found a pant...my panties, you know my little panties.\u201d He said, \"Is this the\ndog's panties.\u201d \"No,\" she said, \"this is my panties.\u201d Because she was very tiny. She was a\ntiny woman. And they turned the house around, and they arrested my priest, the father and\nthe mother and Valodya, all...all of them. And I'm in the cellar by myself with the two dogs\nupstairs. And how long can I stay there inside. I have no air. I have to get out. And the...the\ntwo dogs are \"hmm hmm hmm hum,\" go around. You see, Gail, what I want to tell you is 1f\nthey would come with dogs, they would find me because the dogs would smell me out you\nunderstand. That miracles that God send the Germans without the dogs. Isn't this something?\nTell me. They never...they always came with dogs. Always! But this time they didn't. So\n[...I...1 count that a God's miracle again, and I can tell you about miracles more and more and\nmore. And they arrested the whole house and I was by myself in that cellar with the two\ndogs. Now I think to myself, \"Maybe there is a German upstairs waiting till Olga comes\nhome. I cannot open up. They will find me. What should I do? How long can I stay? I was\nalready without breath.\u201d And then I called, Chippie, Biggie. This is the names of the dogs.\nAnd if those dogs come to me, around me, \"Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm,\" because I know when\nthere would be a German that these dogs was trained to bark on Germans. She trained them\nto bark mostly on Germans. They didn't bark. Nothing! So I say, \"There must be nobody.\u201d\nAnd they was hungry. I have to give them some food. So I open up my little top and I went\nout and there was nobody. But what not? Now they are arrested. And this was I will\n01:50:\ntell you 6 o'clock in the morning. They...they was searching for 2 hours. They arrested...now\nfollow me. Six o'clock in the morning, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...nobody! I was\nalone. I didn't know what to do. What should I do? Now they are dead. I know the Gestapo\nwill not let them come back. They are dead. What I'm going to alone in that big house. You\nknow...you know I didn't know what to do. I...I was dying. I...I...] have to go back to the\nghetto. Six o'clock in the evening they all came back home. Aw, he was worrying about me,\nand I was worrying about them. You can imagine what a welcome it was to both of us. We\nwas hysterically crying and...and...and his mother and father kissed me and hugged me and\noh, they was such beautiful people. I'm telling you I have never met in my life that kind of\nfine people as they was. So they came back and they told me they was taken to the Gestapo\nand they saw these two soldiers, these Russian...Russian war prisoners. They was scalped.\nThey was scalped. They didn't recognize them. And they asked, \"Do you know them? You\nknow...this is ____. This 1s eye to eye witness. They say, \"We never saw him.\u201d They...they\nwas hitting them and...and beating them and they say, \"No, we have never...we don't know\nthem who they are. We don't if Olga did? We have no idea. But we have never seen them.\u201d\n\"Didn't you give them the clothes? Didn't you give them the passport? Didn't you...\u201d They\nsay, \"No, no, no, no, no.\u201d \"I think that's lie.\u201d Also they tortured them, tortured them, then let\nthem go. They was blue and green when they came home. So that was one of the biggest\nhappiness when they came back to me. And that's...that's one of the biggest. But then\nthey...this was other searches, but not this one because they surrounded the whole house and\nSO.\n01:52:\nAnd I did have to be careful. I...I...I liked to look through the window. I wanted to see things.\nYou know I was bored. And...",
        "A: Nothing. Nothing. They didn't find me. I was down there. They didn't let the people even in.\nThey didn't come the second time because they have these people. They shoot them. They\nwas killed.",
        "A: And then came liberation and I stayed with them for awhile because I didn't have anybody to\ngo. And then I get my own apartment and went back to school, and when I was 17 I married,\nand that's also the story after the war.",

We have to, then it's gymnasium you know, the\nmiddle school. But I finished the theater what is together with the high school. And I wanted\nto be actress or do something in show business and met my husband and get married and I...I\nwas able to have a baby, my baby girl, Aviva. And we lived better than ever. We had\neverything. We was working. My husband was working. Then...",
        "A: We was fighting with the Russians for 15 years. Thirty six times they refused us to get out.\nThey didn't give us a permission. We was one of the very, very first. We wanted out. My\nhusband wanted out because he was in Russia. That's the way he survived. He was in Russia.\nHe came back after the war as a soldier. And he survived only that, and he hated them guts.\nHe wanted back and out of here. So we found his mother. What we didn't even know that she\nis alive. We thought that she is also dead. Because you know, it was such a chaos during the\nwar. When the Russians came in, people was evacuating and and my father didn't want to go\nto the Russia, because he hated the Communisms, and that's why we went... Maybe if my\nfather would, you know, evacuate together with us, maybe he would be even alive. But that\nhappened. He didn't love them and he didn't want them. And in the first war, the...the\nGermans was not bad. They treated their war...war people very good. So my father said, \"I'm\nnot going to go,\" and that's why we didn't go. But, maybe that was a mistake and I think it\nwas, but what can I do about it?",
        "A: We wanted to come to America. After we found our mother...this 1s not...my husband's\nmother. She escaped during the war somehow. I don't even know how.

This is my,...I don't know...this is\neverything what I can ask God to give me. He blessed me that he took me out of this Hell. I\nlove America more than anything in this world. And I was working. I get a job at the New\nYork City Opera. I was there working for 16 years. I was in charge of makeup in hair\ndepartment, and I enjoyed my life. I love show business. I couldn't make it as an actress,\nso...because I have an accent with my language, but I did commercials. I did commercials.\nBut I also washed dishes, and I also was babysitting to make a dime.

Why did the Germans do this?\"\nYou know that they cannot even understand what I cannot understand myself. Why? Goetha,\nHeine How can you believe? Schiller... It's unbelievable. The Germans did such a thing?\nGassed people? Why did they gas? You know they don't understand? The children I talk to\nthem always why\u2019? Why did they do that? It will take a long time till they will understand.\nWhen I was learning the Spanish inquisition...you know there was a Spanish inquisition...I\nread one thing what I remembered that they was taking off the nails from people. I remember\nwhen I read that I thought, \"Why? This is terrible? Why do they do that? It 1s terrible?\" They\nwas sadists, that's why. Sadists!

So if the Jew...Jews has it, they came at night and they was always drunk.\nThen they took girls 12 years, 13 years old girls and raped them. Drunk! They don't know\nwhat they are doing, you know. I had an interesting...I was many times hit by the whips and\neverything, but this particular one I have to tell you because this 1s to show you how sadistic\na person can be.

Maybe I know this and maybe that name and that name, but\nthis name I know particular nobody is looking for him. I don't know why. He was our ghetto\ncommandant, and his name is Donskopf. And my sister in her letters name his name too. So\nthis Donskopf was coming over andI remember when we came over, he always looked at\nme. I think he liked children. I mean I was not a child. I was, you know, pretty good\ndeveloped. And he came in and we have a oven, a little stove where we was making tea or\nsomething, you know, because the stove was heated with wood. And my mother...in that\nroom was living my mother, Mrs. Schapiro, a girl by the name Mary, I and my sister, and a\nother woman also and then later she moved out. And when they came in, they was looking,\n\"Do...do you have...\u201d There was four policei, Latvians. There was no Germans. They was\nLatvians. They came in and was, \"Do you have cigarettes. Do you have bla, bla, bla.\u201d And if\nyou don't give it to them, then they search and that's worse. And then I was standing then in\nthe front and he told me to undress. To undress naked. Naked! And you know, I didn't want\nto do it, but my mother spoke in Latvian to me, \"Do it. Do it.\u201d ____- She stayed in back of\nme and she said, \"Undress,\" in Latvian to me. And I undressed. I was just in my panties. And\nhe told me to take a chair and to get up on the stove. And I...I was...the stove was up about so\nhigh. Not higher for me. I was on the stove and I did have to jump from the stove. Then he\ntold me to get up the stove again and to jump on the stove. And then I...I jumped about\nmaybe 7 times. I don't remember the count. And then they turned around and went away.\nThey didn't rape me. Didn't do nothing. Just look at me. How I was doing that. Isn't this\nsadism? Isn't this sadism? This is real sadism you know? Why did they do this? What for?\nWhat pleasure did they have in that? I can't understand. And then the other episode\nwith...what I will never forget.\n02:03:",
        "A: Yeah. I want to tell you just one more story. Uh...We were standing in line getting our bread,\nour ration bread. It was so small, you know, that you know you can...you have to drip(?) it to\neat it. I don't know. How big is that? Three fingers wide. So we did have to stand in the line,\nand I was standing with my mother in the line, usually one of the last ones. And there...there\nwas only old people, old man, old woman because the younger was...was working. The old\npeople usually was standing in line whatever they was giving us. Suddenly, for no\nreason...for no reason, the German brown shirts with their death...death sign on their hats,\nSD...I don't know what the name is, came on motorcycles and start whipping these old\npeople with a whip so badly. For no particular reason! They beat them and beat them and the\npoor people was falling on the floor...floor. My mother grabbed me and we had 1m a...in a\ndoor in...in a house...in a house door. And I was seeing that with my own...own eyes how\nthese people...everybody who was standing in line was whipped so hard. They couldn't...they\nwas running. They was falling on the floor. The way they came they beat up the people. The\nway they ran away with the motorcycles. Tell me why. What is it? Isn't that sadism? This\nepisode also stays in my mind all the time.",

It is like yesterday.\nI see all the things over and over. I...1 wake up in my bed all sweat and the Russians... mean\nRussians no, the Germans are after me. They hit me with the whips. They whip me, whip\nme. Once they whip me when I came in and they found a...what did they find in my...I think\na candle. You know, we didn't have lights, so I found...about | candle, he hit with the whip\nthat my feet was swollen with...with such things my feet was. Why did they whip me for?\nBecause they took away...they found in my pocket a candle. This all...always comes back.\nThat always comes back. And you know what I notice on myself. I was in show business and\nI have had in Latvia a fantastic life. I go to parties, and I go to, you know, movies and\neverything I did. And you know, I was always sad. I was always sad. I put on a face. I was\ndancing. I like to dance and...and so I am not in drugs and never drink. I don't smoke. Never.\nNever did I do that. And I...I pray when I am in a bad mood. I pray and that...that...that I take\nout my...and I love music. Music is my drug. I adore music. But you know I am always until\ntoday, that sadness don't go away from me.

I\ndon't like that.\u201d It makes me sick to my stomach. I will never throw out anything. I\nremember all the times that there were so many hungry people. They would give their lives\nfor a piece of bread you know. Bread is... You will see the letters, bread, bread, bread. This is\nlike...like a house, like a car, like diamonds. And this never let me go, you know. I speak to\ndoctor sometimes. I...I...I...I feel sad. And you know I...God made such a miracle with me. I\nhave traveled. I came to America. I had a job. I was invited. I meet beautiful people, show\nbusiness. I love show business. Here I met Placido Domingo, Pavarotti. I 2? I worked\nwith...I\nseen Karayan. I have seen every opera in the world. I was in every opera house. You know,\nthis is what I like. I have...whatever I ask, God gives to me. He give it to me. I want to travel.\nI have no money. He makes I have money. I go with travel. I wanted to go to Jamaica. I go to\nJamaica. I wanted to go Paris. I go to Paris. He does it. I am not rich. Not at all. He does it.\nDon't ask me. He does it. But I am always sad. I go to these places and I am sad. In my\ninside, I am not cured. I am always sad. This is you know like a stamp, like a stamp. How\nyou say that? You know, like a \"Staempel\" on my soul. This is it. And it breaks my heart my\ndaughter don't understand that. My grandchildren...they have their own life. I don't want\nthem to understand because it's a sad story. It is sad... am happy that they are happy. I want\nthem to be only happy. Really. I mean it. But I need...you know, sadness need company. I\nneed somebody to...to have pity on me a little bit. And...uh...all the people with whom I was\ntogether are dead or they are somewheres where I cannot reach them or they don't want to\ntalk about that. I have met people. I say, \"You was with my sister. Why don't you tell me\nsomething about her?\" \"Don't ask me. I will not tell it.\u201d I say, \"Come over. I want to know\nhow she died.\u201d \"No.\u201d And she don't come. And there is a person who knows. And there are a\nlot of people who can come and tell you stories and they don't because it is terrible, terrible\npainful. It 1s painful. I'm doing it because I think that maybe we'll take that sorrow off my\nsoul. Because I have two things what I have to put the Valodya name in Yad Vashem. It's my\nduty. And if I can also, his sister's name, and I have to give the letters to the Holocaust\nMuseum. This is my duty. Maybe I will feel better after that. I am always sad. And always I\nlike crying kind of. (Crying) (Sigh) (Pause) And I will tell you I'm sorry I'm alive. I'm\nashamed. I am absolutely ashamed that I'm alive because why did all these people have to\ndie? Who is me? Why did God pick up me? I don't like this world. I am from a different era.\nThis is not my time to live. I am compassioned, with feelings, with...with caring. The world\nis not like that right now. It is rude. It is dirty. I can't stand dirty language. I don't belong. I\nwant to go back. I...I talk to God every day. Take me back. Take me back. It is not my time\nto go. I understand that. But I am not happy in this world. I mean to go out and...and I don't\ngo out because I don't like 1t what I see. I can't stand drugs. I cannot...dirty language kills me.\nYou know I...my time 1s Renaissance. I am...1 am born in wrong time. And I feel guilty that I\nam alive and other people are dead. Each time I eat, I thank God. I go to the American\nsupermarket. I am here in this country with 25 years very soon. Okay? I cannot understand\nso much of everything. It is so beautiful this country. When I will die, I will ask God to send\nme right back to America. And people don't cherish that. America! America! You know I\npunched in the mouth one person. I can't hear that word that America is bad. The best! The\ntops! The only one! And that's what I feel. I feel sad. And something else I wanted to tell you\nvery much. I believe in God. I was not a believer at all, and don't everybody forget, 1t was by\na priest and the priest didn't influence. Not true. He didn't influence me about nothing.\n02:11:\nHe 1s an evangelist. You know, he...respects the Old Testament and the New Testament and\nhe should live 1n Israel. He's more Jewish than you and me together. He is a wonderful\nperson to talk to him. But he's old and he...always he says, \"I didn't save your life. God saved\nyou.\u201d And you know, getting older I start thinking about the miracles. The magnificent\nmiracles what happened to me. Like I was in...1n...1n prison. One beautiful appell. You have\nto stand in line. One person goes left, one person right, one person goes left, one person goes\nright. We knew that one of this line is going to be killed because there's too much people\nthere so they have to kill somebody. So I went left. My sister, my mother went right. My\nsister went left. Yeah? I run over to the...I know that she's going to be dead. I knew. Don't\nask me how. I have a intuition from my childhood. I knew what is bad or what is good. Like\nsomebody tells me that I am born in. I have till today. I can look at you and I can read\nyour...your... your horoscope. I have a intuition. So I ran over to the Germanit was\nWehrmacht man. It was not a Nazi. It was a soldier. I said, \"Please let my mother come in\nmy line. Please because my sister 1s there.\u201d He said, \"Okay.\u201d And he didn't say, \"No.\u201d And\nmy mother...and all these people where my mother was in line was dead, and we survived.\nAnd if they ever created ?? in these letters, you will see that when I have my sister's last\nletter...this is a very important letter. There is the date and the time and the year when they\nwere evacuated from that working platz, where they was working for the Emheit. And she\nwrites right now we don't have...a...I mean the...the cars are not ready, so maybe we will stay\nand I will you a other letter. But if not, this is my last letter and I tell you goodbye. Oh, this is\njust a...[...I was hysterical when I read that. You will see the letters are the most...I am not\nimportant. The most important thing is my sister's letters. You will see how they was living\nin ghetto when I was having a warm place to live and eat and everything. I feel guilty.\nGuilty! Guilty! But why did God pick me up from all these 30,000 people I have no idea. I\nhave no idea. I am not such a girl. I wasn't listening to my mother many times but maybe he\nthought that... I...I start thinking about the miracles when I was getting older. You know\nbecause God was always on my mind. Always on my mind! I thought something must be\nmore than all this what I see. There must be...there must be a...sure it is not a God with a\nbeard and...and...and sitting in his chair as a child as I thought it is. But when somebody ask\nme, \"You and your God.\u201d You know people don't like when\nyou say that. \"Caroline, You're a modern woman. What is going on with you? God. God.\nWhat is God?\" So I tell them, \"Do you know what is love? Could you tell me? Please, tell\nme what 1s love? How can you...destiny needs that. Destiny...what is love? To me, God is\nlove. The all good things is God.\u201d And I start thinking, \"How did I get out of the ghetto?\nHow? How? With all the projectors, with all the Nazis there?\" I did. How did I know that I\nhave to go in this line and not in this line. Why did the Germans came on their horses and\ntook me away from that killing spot in the prison? How? Why? And you know I could tell\nyou millions of this moments. Millions. I could write now. Miracle, miracle, miracle,\nmiracle, miracle, miracle. I start thinking, \"Hey. This is not real. This is miracles. And\nsomebody did that. Not you did it. God did it.\u201d And I started to believe in it so that of today\nif you ask me, \"Caroline, what is your biggest desire? What do you...would like to know. Do\nyou want to travel? Do you want steaks? Do you want fish? Tell me what do you want?\nDiamonds? Clothes? Furs?\" I have it. I don't want it. I have it all the steaks in the world. I\nhave all the best fish in the world. I have traveled all over the... You know what I want? If\nyou ask me, I will tell you, \"What I want of today, I want to know God better.\u201d This is the\nonly thing what I don't know. Everything I have searched and I know there is nothing.\nNothing. I know that I know nothing. That I can say. I want to know God better. He is love.\nAnd this world is without love.\n"
