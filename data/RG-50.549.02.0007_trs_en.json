        "Q: If you could just tell me \u2014",
        "A: Testing, one, two, testing.",
        "Q: How about just tell me \u2014 introduce yourself and tell us where you\u2019!l \u2014 where we\nare. Tell \u2014",

        "A: Is\u2014 am I coming through?",
        "Q: You\u2019re coming through fine. The one thing I\u2019m going to do is just tilt this slightly.\nThere we go. What they\u2019ve asked me to do is before we get started talking about your\nlife since coming to the U.S. is \u2014 there are a f \u2014 there were a few gaps in the video\ninterview that you did almost 10 years ago, and there were a \u2014 a short list of things that\nthey wanted me to ask about, to clarify certain \u2014",
        "A: The spelling and stuff?",
        "Q: Well, that separately, you got that list.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: That \u2014 that\u2019s something we can do at the end of the interview.",
        "A: Fine.",
        "Q: But there were a couple of specific things that they wanted me to ask you that\npertained to details regarding stories that you told before.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: So, I\u2019d like to start with those and then move into your life since the war ended.",
        "A: Fine.",
        "Q: In your previous interview you mentioned that on the \u2014 the march from Landsberg",
        "A: Landsberg.",
        "Q: Landsberg. That several guards asked the prisoners to quote, sign that I was good\nto you, that I gave you bread.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: What did they mean? What were they expecting of you?",
        "A: Well, I\u2019ve seen it, I\u2019ve seen the paper, I\u2019ve seen the paper in their hand. These were\nactually Wehrmacht guards by now, so most of the SS guards ran away. But as we\nwere marching with these Wehrmacht guards, from the lans \u2014 last concentration camp,\nwhich was a subcamp of Dachau, Landsberg, we were supposedly marching towards\nthe Tyrolean mountains, and they knew the ne \u2014 end was near. Of course we \u2014 we had\n\u2014 we had to push a wagon behind us so if anybody fell, that was just throw \u2018em in the\nwagon, so nobody was \u2014 be left on the road. And this piece of pa \u2014 they wrote these\npieces of paper and they tried to give it to the persons on the end, on the edge as they\nwere marching. Here, would you mind \u2014 would you sign this for me, and tell them that\nI was good to you, that I helped you, that I gave you some food. Some people did sign.\nI\u2019ve seen some people sign. Wha-Wha-What \u2014 what could a poor \u2014 poor soul do? In\nthe \u2014 they never came to me personally, but I\u2019ve seen them being done. So this was the\ndeath march, so to speak a death march because lot of people were \u2014 were falling like\nflies. I was one of the fortunate ones, I was still strong enough because of \u2014 of the\nslave labor that I performed prior to that, of eating a little better. So, during this death\nmarch there was also a American Air Force air raid on a munition depot very close to a\ntown called Wiirzburg, Germany. And from there as the \u2014 th \u2014 as the Americans\nwere bombing, I ran and I successfully escaped. And soon after I was picked up by the\nUnited States Armed Forces.",
        "Q: Th-Th-The questions I\u2019m going to ask you in the next few minutes are very\ndisparate, they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re not in chronology necessarily, but they\u2019re, again,\npicking up on things that you mentioned before. Did you ever get over your fear of\ndoctors and dentists? You referred to that.",
        "A: Unfortunately not. I \u2014 from day \u2014 from \u2014 ever since I\u2019ve been out of the \u2014 the death\ncamps, concentration camps \u2014 when I met my wife, I got married, I had \u2014 I had\nproblem with my teeth. You know, there \u2014 there is saying, your teeth are alright, but\nyour gums have to come out, and that was my case, and I was deathly afraid. Once \u2014 I\nonce ran away from a dentist in the army. I don\u2019t know if I ever s \u2014 mentioned that to \u2014\nto \u2014 to the Holocaust Museum. I was taken by another \u2014 another G.I. with \u2014 to \u2014 to go\nto the dentist because I had awful ba-bad teeth and pain. And I was sitting in the chair\nand I ran away from there. I\u2019m still scared of dentists, I\u2019m still deathly afraid of shots.\nPll tell you an \u2014 a little story about what happened to me a few years ago. As I\nmentioned to you before, I wa \u2014 I was involved in soccer, not only as a coach and a\nreferee, but as a player. I was playing a soccer game and I got hit by a man and he\nopened my f\u2014 my forehead. I ended up in a hospital. And a friend of mine, the one I\nshowed you on the picture in \u2014 in the wall there, took me to the hospital and then they\ncalled my wife to come to the hospital. They wanted to give me a tetanus shot. I would\nre \u2014 I refused it, I would \u2014 I fought it. My wife almost left me because of that, she was\nso upset with me. That tetanus shot was so important because I was hit, and also hit a\ndoor, and the hor \u2014 door had a little steel [indecipherable] I was \u2014 and doctors fear is\nstill there. When I go to examination, I am awfully fearful what they going to do to\nyou. Very much so, even today. I\u2019m afraid of when they look for po \u2014 prostrate, you\nknow, when they do th \u2014 do that little finger job on you. That scares me, that scares the\nhell out of me. When they take a little blood from the fingers, that scares me. So that\nfear is from Auschwitz, unfortunately, because I\u2019ve seen Mengele e-e-every day on th\n\u2014on-\u2014on the tracks. So the doctors always scare me, and they shouldn\u2019t, they really\nshouldn\u2019t, not today. And especially since I have a daughter who is a physician. But\nI\u2019m still afra \u2014 a-afraid of it. \u2019m very much so.",
        "Q: Have you ever made any efforts to do anything about that? Have you \u2014",
        "A: N-No. See, there are two things that I am afraid of. Doctors and dentists is two, and\nI\u2019m also afraid of water. Water scares me for the simple reason because in Auschwitz,\nI was sent to a shtraf(ph) commander once. Shtraf(ph) commander meaning that they\ncaught me es \u2014 organizing food for Jewish girls [indecipherable] commando, and they\nsend you to a sin 0-0-operation, so they call it shtraf(ph). Sin \u2014 sin \u2014 sin commando,\nwhich meant that we were forced to cut seaweeds in water. We had a chain \u2014 chainsaw\nlike, but with the one guy on one end of it, the other one the other end, gonna pull it,\nwas like a sickle, which would cut it. And there would be a kapo(ph) \u2014 a\u2014a\n[indecipherable], a kapo(ph), a \u2014 a person who was in charge of us behind us with the\nSS man, and they would dunk our heads in the water and kept us there until we could\nnot breathe any more. So I \u2014 I\u2014 I went through that for a couple of weeks as a \u2014 a-a-as\na shtraf commander, as a sin [indecipherable]. So whenever \u2014 whenever we go to a\nbeach or something, I only go up to my knees. And not one of my children, of the four\nkids, were swimmers, because of me. And of course, now they are learning a little bit.\nSome of them are \u2014 a couple of them are still afraid. Arsani\u2019s(ph) a swimmer now, his\nti\u2014 his children are a swimmer. Our daughter the physician, she swims now, she was\nalways deathly afraid of water, because of the \u2014 because of me. So those are the things\nthat scare me, scare the hell out of me, doctors, dentists and water.",
        "Q: Makes sense. I\u2019m gonna re-rearrange the microphone so it\u2019s a little less bothersome\nfor you and you can move around better.",
        "A: Can you \u2014",
        "Q: It\u2019s fine, it\u2019s -- that just gives you a little more free reign.",
        "A: Oh, okay.",
        "Q: Although it\u2019s off s \u2014 the chronology a little bit here, I would like t \u2014 well, I\u2019Il come\nback to this, th-the \u2014 how you think \u2014 what you \u2014 how you think your children have\nbeen affected by what happened to you is something I would like to talk to you about.",
        "A: Do you \u2014 you want to talk to me about 1t now?",
        "Q: Well \u2014",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: All right, we\u2019re there, so let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: All right, let\u2019s \u2014 the children, our children. Well, when I arrived to this country,\nMay 10\", 1946, I came from the army, so it was a little different for me than the most\nsurvivors that arrived here, because most survivors came on a diff \u2014in a\u20141-ina\u2014ina\ndifferent way. I was helped with the United States armed forces and also was very\nhelpful that I had an aunt living in Detroit. So when I first met my wife, my future\nwife, we started dating, we \u2014 also a survivor, you know. She didn't have much family,\nI didn\u2019t have any family, so you lonely, I\u2019m lonely, let\u2019s be lonely together, the old\nsaying what is the \u2014 one survivor said it at one time, if I may use his phrase. So when\nwe got married, February 22\", 1948, it will be 50 years coming up in the next \u2014 th-this\nFebruary, I asked my wife, why don\u2019t we \u2014 let\u2019s not talk any more any other language\nexcept English. My English was fairly decent except I had the ar-army language,\nwhich was not the cleanest language in those days, of course. That\u2019s how I learned.\nAnd we decided \u2014 she was a little bit against it. She said no, we should talk to the\nchildren other languages also. She was much smarter than me, believe me, because the\nkids today could have \u2014 although they speak some languages, but they could \u2014 today\nthey could have learned much more. So, how did it affect my children? First, we\nwouldn\u2019t talk about our experiences. Another mistake we made \u2014 I made, anyway, it\nwas \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m taking the blame for that. Reason we didn\u2019t want to, why hurt them?\nWhy let them know how much we suffered, how much we went through? But the kids\nknew they were different. Our children soon, as soon as they started school found out\nthey were different. Number one, they didn\u2019t have any first cousins. They didn\u2019t have\nany aunts and uncles. No grandparents. There was never a grandmother to \u2014 to \u2014 to\nhug them and kiss them or whatever. School functions, for parent and grandparents,\nthere were never any grandparents around. We used to adopt grandparents for them. In\nDetroit we use to a-adopt a lady in the apartment building. She was nice, and th \u2014\nGrandma Goldstein, that was her grandma. She did \u2014 she had one daughter, an old, old\nmaid, never married, so our children became her grandchildren. So the kids were \u2014\nknew they \u2014 and yet they knew, they knew why something was wrong, but we never\ntalked about it. The only time the kids would \u2014 our son was the first one, who was the\noldest. When I joined this soccer team in Detroit, which by the way was founded by\nGerman Jews who arrived to United States in the 30\u2019s, just before Hitler got to them.\nAnd I joined this team and pretty soon \u2014 there was a tryout \u2014 pretty soon there were\nmore survivors joining this team. So after soccer games we would go to someone\u2019s\nhome, yours, mine or someone else\u2019s and had a cookout or dinner, or whatever. We\nwould start talking about the game, then we would start talking about our lives in\nAmerica, how \u2014 how are we doing, how much money do you make. And before you\nknew it, Auschwitz would come to the \u2014 to \u2014 into the \u2014 into the conversation. And our\nchildren, especially our son, would always listen from be \u2014 from behind the door. And\n\u2014 and he knew \u2014 he \u2014 then he would tell his sisters, you know, I just heard something\nabout Daddy, or I heard something about Mom, about what ha \u2014 what happened to\nthem in the camps. So we didn\u2019t want to talk about these experiences to them. And ar\n\u2014 then, let me tell you about the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the local Jewish population. Detroit is a\nbig metropolitan city with a large Jewish population. We, Agnes and I, my wife Agnes\nwent to a school to learn English. I \u2014 at the Jewish Community Center in Detroit, and\nour soccer team will also meet there. So, I didn\u2019t go to that school because I\u2014I-\u2014I-I\nfelt I\u2014 I had enough of schooling, which was another mistake. Would have listened to\nmy wife I probably would have been sometime a teacher today somewhere. So we \u2014\nthen we tried to tell the local population, the local Jewish population, our \u2014 our own\npeople in \u2014 in the Jewish Community Center. We had a Purim play, we went to a\nPurim play, and then all of a sudden we start talking to these people about Auschwitz,\nno \u2014 number of us in the soccer team. And the leader of the group says, that\u2019s enough\nabout Auschwitz. Let\u2019s go back to singing and playing the music again. So nobody\nwant to listen. My own aunt, may she rest in peace, my father\u2019s youngest sister, who\nlost everybody in her family, she lost two sisters, she lost her brother, she lost all her\nnieces and nephews and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and all her cousins, she wouldn\u2019t \u2014 she, coming\nin 1939, emigrating to this country in 1939 from Vienna, Austria, she didn\u2019t want to\nlisten. So we decided not to talk about it. The first time I was able to talk about it was\nwhen our youngest daughter asked my wife to come to her eighth grade junior high\nschool to speak, and the next day my wife forced me to go there. Yet, I didn\u2019t tell them\na story like the story should be told. I kind of whitewashed it. I was afraid to hurt\npeople. So that took a long time. So my children, at f\u2014 at first they were resentful, they\nsaid Daddy, why didn\u2019t you tell us? Why \u2014 you know, th \u2014 they didn\u2019t come and \u2014 and\nsay to me, you \u2014 you \u2014 you were wrong, you \u2014 you should have done it. But you could\nhave told us. I didn\u2019t want to hurt you honey. This \u2014 this is simple, it\u2019s a \u2014 it the 0 \u2014\nit\u2019s the way it is, I'd \u2014 it just \u2014 I don\u2019t want to hurt strangers, let alone my own\nchildren. So they\u2019re different. But today they\u2019re very much involved. My daughter, the\noldest one, the physician was on the Holocaust Committee with me, which I am a\nchairman of [indecipherable] local \u2014 local Holocaust Committee called Jewish\nCommittee Relations. Both \u2014 all three of the daughters went to second generation\nmeetings, second generation of Holocaust survivors. In ninete \u2014 January 27, 1985, I\ntook two of my children, my son and my middle daughter, the New Yorker, the\njeweler, with me to Auschwitz for the commemoration of the 40\" anniversary of\nAuschwitz being liberated, if you can call being liberated by the Soviet Union a\nliberation. And they came there. I showed them, first of all Auschwitz number one,\nthat was the first camp that I was taken to. I showed them the barrack that my father\nwas last taken to, block seven in Auschwitz, called the Krankenbau, the sick bay.\nSick bay without doctors. I showed them that barrack. This is where they took my \u2014\nyour grandfather last time, to the ovens from. I showed them block 16 where I s \u2014\nwhere I was living on the \u2014 which by the way, block 16 today in Auschwitz is the\nCzechoslovakian block, a-a-and they have some artifacts in there. And we spend there\na couple da \u2014 two days in Auschwitz. And then of course in 1990, I went back again to\nAuschwitz, but this time I took agn \u2014 took Agnes with me, the same middle daughter\nand the youngest daughter. This 1s where we made a film called, \u201cAuschwitz, If You\nCried, You Died.\u201d So I sh \u2014 there I really pored my heart out to my children, to show\nthem what Auschwitz is all about, what it was all about. I took them to every \u2014 see I\nwas working as a slave laborer, a place called Kanada commando, unloading\nincoming Jews from every \u2014 every Nazi occupied European country. And this is where\nI gave my two daughters and my wife, who has not been to Auschwitz, their exact\nfeeling what Auschwitz was about. I explained to them crematorium one \u2014\ncrematorium one, which is in Auschwitz number one, which 1s still standing. Then we\nwent to Birkenau, which is the Auschwitz number two camp, and I showed them the\ncrematorias(ph). I worked as a slave laborer at Birkenau, 600 yards from the gas\nchambers and crematorias(ph). So the kids today know much more than they should\nhave known years ago, which I was afraid to tell them, to hurt them.",
        "Q: What ways \u2014 so much to talk about at th \u2014 \u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m trying to think in terms\nof doing this in a \u2014 in an order that would be useful to future people listening to this,\nbut other ways your children were affected, you \u2014 you talk about that they have, in a\nsecond hand fashion abs \u2014 absorbed some of your fears. Have \u2014 is that something that\nyou \u2019ve ever talked to them about over the years?",
        "A: About my fears? Well, the kids were always afraid that they would hurt me 1-if they\nwould talk to me about my fears because you know, it\u2019s bad enough that I had it, you\nknow? My son tried a number of times, he says, Dad, you know, you can go to water.\nYou can swim with the \u2014 look at your grandchildren, look at your little granddaughter,\nshe dives from this big diving board. He says, you don\u2019t have to dive, but you can go\nin the water deeper than you go into water. They tried it, but I \u2014 I \u2014 I-I \u2014 1\u2014 we were in\nIsrael, we just got back from Israel last week. We went to the swimming pool. There\nwere kids playing with a ball, I was playing soccer with them, you know, in a group. I\ndidn\u2019t want to go in that water. I went. Little \u2014 little above my knees, and anything that\n\u2014a-as soon as I feel the water above, I get scared, still to this day. So the fears, well,\nthe kids tried, but s \u2014 you know.",
        "Q: Have you ever done anything \u2014 I don\u2019t want to dwell on this too much, but 1n terms\nof your \u2014 your fear of doctors and dentists, have you \u2014 you know, there are certain\ndentists, for example, who specialize in people who are phobic about dentistry, and\nwho, you know, are particularly sensitive to that, and \u2014",
        "A: The only way any dentist could touch my teeth, or es \u2014 extract them, have to put me\nto sleep. That\u2019s \u2014 I \u2014 no other way I would have done it. Yet, when I lost all these teeth\n\u2014 of course, I \u2014 when I got out of Auschwitz I had hardly any teeth left, but when I lost\nthe rest of them, this guy, this dentist was very gentle, whom I still have \u2014 course, now\nI don\u2019t need him, I only got thr-three teeth left. But even then, he knows how sensitive\nI am. When he cleans the remaining on my teeth, he makes sure that I get enough\nNovocain into me that I don\u2019t feel not even his \u2014 I don\u2019t even feel his finger. My lips\nand mouth is frozen for a whole day after that. So I \u2014 1-1-I\u2014 I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think\nI would want to be the doctor that I should be his patient.",
        "Q: Out of curiosity, I know you\u2019ve \u2014 again, we\u2019re jumping ahead, I know that you\u2019ve\nhad a lot of contact with other survivors in the past decade or more.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Are \u2014 do you share common fears along those lines?",
        "A: There are some of us that have the same fears, and especially those of us who \u2014\nunfortunately two of them are \u2014 two of them died in the recent years \u2014 those of us who\nspent in Auschwitz more than two years, because we didn\u2019t live through because of\ndoctors, because the doctors were there to kill you. But they had the same fears. I have\none friend who died in Skokie al \u2014 two years ago, Joe Neumann(ph). You \u2014 you\nmentioned his name [indecipherable] misspelled it anyway, but Joe was the same as\nme. He had \u2014 unfortunately, he died of an aneurism and \u2014 and a heart problem two\nyears ago. He was the strongest prisoner ever, among us. He was seven years \u2014 se-\nseven, eight years older than me and he looked like a real -- a real born Nazi. He had\nblonde, blue eyed \u2014 blonde hair, blue eyes. And Mengele liked him so much that he\nnever believed he was Jewish. He never \u2014 he always told him, Du bist kein Jude\nnicht \u2014 you\u2019re not a Jew. You \u2014 you are \u2014 you are a German. And he spoke pretty \u2014\npretty good German, too. We all did from Slovakia, you know. So we \u2014 we \u2014 and the\nother guy in f\u20141n his hist \u2014 he was historian, his name was Eric Kulka. Eric Kulka\nwas a\u2014 wr-wrote a number of books. In fact, he wrote the first book, him and another\nguy in pra \u2014 li\u2014 who lives in Prague, his name is Ota Kraus, they wrote the book\ncalled, \u201cThe Death Factory.\u201d Started in 1947, you can imagine, not even two years\nafter Auschwitz, they started this book. And I happen to have a copy of it also, but it \u2014\nthat book was printed in many, many languages. And this guy Kulka, he too had fears\nof doctors.",
        "Q: Makes sense.",
        "A: We\u2019ve seen what doctors did to our \u2014 in Auschwitz. We knew when someone was\npulled from \u2014 from \u2014 from the bunk and being castrated by Mengele, or give him the \u2014\nthe injection, the shots, th-the \u2014 the penal what do you call it? The \u2014 the \u2014 the shot that\nkills you that th-they use in the pri \u2014 1n prisons when the death sentence fe \u2014 then th \u2014\nso they give you shots to kill you for \u2014 from a death row.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know what chemical that is.",
        "A: Phenyl \u2014 penal \u2014 some kind of a thing. Well, I \u2014 I can\u2019t think of the name now, I\u2019m\nsure it\u20191l come to me. And these were the shots that were given in Germany, in \u2014 in\nthe \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in the concentration camps.",
        "Q: What about other fears, general fears? When you \u2014 when you were here, when \u2014\nwhen the war was over, when you were \u2014 I don\u2019t know when we want to start talking\nabout this, but you must \u2014 I\u2019m assuming you had some other fears, fears of \u2014",
        "A: Well, let me just \u2014 okay.",
        "Q: \u2014 of the police, fears of \u2014",
        "A: Well le-let me \u2014 let me start with the fears. When I was first picked up in United\nStates Armed Forces, number one I didn\u2019t speak any \u2014 speak English. I spoke\nGerman, I spoke Hungarian, I spoke Russian, I spoke Polish. And the only reason I got\nalong with the army, because there was some people that were born in this country of\nPolish parents, of Czech parents, of Slovak parents and then I could communicate with\nthem. And there was a guy from Boston, of all places, and \u2014 a Jewish fellow by the\nname of Feldman, he was a schoolteacher. And he would teach me English, how did\nhe teach me English? By making me read \u201cStars and Stripes\u201d and also the army sent\nme to a school in \u2014 in Germany, in occupied Germany, I and E school. Information\neducation. Who was this school for? This school war \u2014 was not for people to \u2014 to learn\nEnglish, this was people from \u2014 from the illiterates. People from the south \u2014 and I\u2019m\nsorry not \u2014 I hope that nobody who listens to me, I don\u2019t think everybody in the south\ndoesn\u2019t know how to read. But these were guys who didn\u2019t go to schools. And they\nhad to write home letters from the armed forces. It was \u2014 they \u2014 they knew how to\ncarry a gun and shoot it, but they had problem reading or writing. So the ar \u2014 Feldman\nwas teaching this class called I and E, information education. And there would be a\nblackboard and on this blackboard there would be a letter. Dear folks, today I am in\nFrankfurt. I am fine, hope you are too. Love, your son John. And I would I-learn\nhow to read and write that way, plus this Feldman made me read \u201cStars and Stripes.\u201d\nAnd he would teach me English. I have a knack for languages and I learned the\nlanguage quite \u2014 quite qu-quickly in th \u2014 the American language, as well as other\nlanguages.",
        "Q: We were talking about fears \u2014",
        "A: Fears.",
        "Q: \u2014 and how you dealt with them over the years \u2014",
        "A: Ah \u2014 oh - okay \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 other types of fears.",
        "A: All right, I\u2019m sorry.",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay.",
        "A: Well, I got you \u2014 I got you this one. Now, fears in the army. I had fears in the army.\nAny time I\u2019ve seen soldiers march, I\u2019ve always looked back to see who was behind\nme. Those were the other fears. There was a Red Cross field director who had a\nwoman working for him, woman Red Cross, also a field dire \u2014 field person. She was\nfrom Milwaukee. Her name was Wanda Waleiko(ph) Wanda Waleiko(ph) was like\na psychia \u2014 psych-psychologist and she was in charge of me. She would always talk to\nme, try to get me back into \u2014 the ar \u2014 of course, in those days you didn\u2019t have\npsychiatrists like you have today. And she would try to talk to me and calm me down,\nand \u2014 and \u2014 and she was the one who tried to get the fear away from me, because she \u2014\nthey knew \u2014 soon I\u2014 when I ran away from the dentist they knew that something is\nwrong with me, that th \u2014 something has to be done. And I remember they gave me a\ncapsule to take to calm me down. And I don\u2019t know how to take this capsule. So what\nI\u2019ve done, I opened the capsule and I put the powder in my hand from the ca \u2014 th-the\ncontents into \u2014 and it was awfully bitter and that\u2019s what I took. I didn\u2019t know that you\ncan take the capsule and just swallow it and it dissolves. Who knew that, you know,\nfrom where? So, fears? Then I came to this country, I had fears here. I had awful fears\nhere. I was afraid of policemen. I was afraid of anything that \u2014 that had authority over\nme. See, I had my first job in this country in Detroit, Michigan. And my uncle, who\nwas my \u2014 my \u2014 my aunt\u2019s husband, he was ac p \u2014 accountant, C.P.A. And he would\nhelp me, reading the Detroit News and Detroit\u2019s Free Press to \u2014 in the a \u2014 want ads.\nAnd there was an ad in the paper, foreign speaking salesman wanted. So my uncle put\nme on a streetcar, and I went there. That\u2019s how I got my first job. And first job was\nworking in the \u2014 in the store, Zoleara(ph) department stores in Detroit Michigan on\nJefferson Avenue. And the store \u2014 we would sell merchandise to foreign people,\nAmericans that were \u2014 came from a foreign country. That would \u2014 now, war is over,\nthey had relatives in Europe, in Poland, in Hungary and wherever. They would\nreceive letters from \u2014 from their relatives and we would read the letters and they said,\nAnna needs a pair of pants, John needs a pair of shoes. Here is a piece of string, this is\nthe size of his foot. Here\u2019s a piece of string, this is size of his waist, for pants. And that\n\u2014 so that\u2019s what we used to do, that\u2019s how \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 that ma \u2014 was my first job. Then I\nwa \u2014 Started to lose a little f \u2014 little \u2014 little fear already, but I was still, 1f I can say it in\nthose words, I didn\u2019t have the trust, the faith. \u2019'd a\u2014I was always a \u2014 always afraid\nthat \u2014 that \u2014 th-that it\u2019s too good, you know, that it can\u2019t be, th-th-that\u2019s \u2014 you know. I\nalways look behind, who is behind me. And it took me a long time. Took me a very\nlong time, took me a very long time.",
        "Q: How long? Years, decades?",
        "A: I would say it took years, years. Five, six years or better. When I met my wife, and\nwe Started getting the children, even then I was always fearful, always very fearful\nabout my kids. It shouldn\u2019t happen to them what happened to the kids in Auschwitz.\nSo it took a long time. And the nightmares, you know, they were there for a long time,\nand \u2014 and let me tell you, even to this date, they don\u2019t stop. You know when they\ncome the strongest on? Let\u2019s say I\u2019m invited to speak at a university or a high school\nor college or civic or \u2014 or religious organization. And while I\u2019m speaking, I\u2019m fine.\nNow the questions come, and the questions bring back \u2014 bring out more than actual\npresentation because \u2014 see it \u2014 while I\u2019m speaking, I don\u2019t use any text. I never, never,\nnever use a piece of paper when I speak. I \u2014 I can\u2019t stand reading my life story at\nAuschwitz. But when I\u2019m speaking, I\u2019m reliving my time in Auschwitz, my time in\nSachsenhausen, my time in Landsberg and so on. And I \u2014 then I gotta \u2014 and it\u2019s all\nthere in front of you. Now you see yourself, you actually see in your own visual mind,\nyou see the days that you unloaded, the days that the selections are made at\nAuschwitz. So you see all that, you know. So you live that \u2014 you relive that. Now I\u2019m\nfinished the presentation. I\u2019m driving home from 60, 70, sometime 100 miles out of\nthe state, sometimes be different states. And as I go home I\u2019m \u2014 now I\u2019m trying to\ncalm myself down. I go to bed at night and I get nightmares. You know that \u2014 never a\nday goes by that Auschwitz doesn\u2019t come ba \u2014 come in your head. And it isn\u2019t\nbecause they tattoo a number on my arm. That is, you know, here I am. The same way\nwith my children as they got older. I tried to tell them a little more about it, you know,\nand then \u2014 now they\u2019re in college. You worry about them away from home. Then they\ncome home with boyfriends. You know, from the \u2014 from the \u2014 from the day they were\nborn, when there was bris, when there was a circumcision, people are there, my a \u2014 my\naunt, my wife\u2019s uncle is the godfather, and you\u2019re looking for people to come to your \u2014\nthere. I\u2019m looking for the people that never show up. I\u2019m looking the people that I\nwanted to be there, they\u2019re not there. Our ya \u2014 oldest daughter got engaged. Young\nman came to ask for her hand. And I \u2014I broke down something terrible. Broke down\nsomething terrible, from happiness and sadness. Here I\u2019ve got a daughter who is ready\nto get married. She will never see her grandmother, never see her cousins, never see\nanyone else at her wedding, you know. And then, when there is happiness and sadness,\nwho do you share it with? Just with the immediate family. Your wife and your\nchildren. And your children try to calm you down, they try to come to you and, you\nknow. And I feel very sad about those things, you know. Now our little daughter in\nSwitzerland is gonna make us grandparents, okay? So here she 1s, 4,000 miles away\nfrom us. And my wife and I, we insist we\u2019re going to be there when the kid 1s born but\nhow do we \u2014 how do you figure that out? Yeah, so \u2014 yeah.",
        "Q: When you were there in the army camp after the liberation, did they understand\nwhat had happened to you?",
        "A: When I first got picked up by the United States Armed Forces, called 774 tank\nbattalion, this was before the camps were even near. They were \u2014 this was quite a ways\nfrom any camp, away from Dachau. And when I showed them this number, when I\ntold them what it\u2019s all about, this Polish American from Chicago brings over his\ncaptain, his name was Captain Yogerling(ph), and he brings him over who is a \u2014 who\nwas an attorney from home. And he\u2019s try \u2014 he\u2019s telling him what I tell him in Polish\nwhat happened. They were sh-shrugging their shoulder. They had no idea what I \u2014 wh-\nwhat I \u2014 what I came from. They seen a guy who \u2014 who weighed nothing, like me, I\nwas a\u2014a Skinny skeleton runt. And they tried to feed \u2014 first of all they cleaned me up\nfrom head to toe, they had the \u2014 they had these traveling showers, what the army\nshower had carried around, they were wide open and they had water, and they had a\nlittle shower head and then they gave you soap and DDT powder to spray you. And\nthen they gave me clean uniform, clean fatigue, clean pair of boots. First time I had\nunderwear on 1n almost three years, an-and socks and pair of \u2014 pair of army boots. And\ntried to tell them, they knew nothing until they hit the first concentration camp. And\neven then they didn\u2019t understand. They\u2019re seeing this mass of bodies coming out of\ncattle cars, gotta \u2014 or coming out of \u2014 just walking over dead people. They couldn\u2019t\nunderstand how could anybody do this to anybody. And then I start to tell them. See,\nthis is what happened in Auschwitz. This 1s what happened in the camps, in the Nazi\ndeath camps. And then, of course, they started, you know, being rowdy on the streets.\nEvery time they seen a German on the bicycle they kicked him off, took his bicycle.\nThey did all sorts of things just to \u2014 they want to beat up every German they\u2019ve seen\non the street. Of course the \u2014 the officers stopped them because he \u2014 you \u2014 you don\u2019t \u2014\nAmerica you don\u2019t \u2014 you don\u2019t do these things in America, you don\u2019t do these things\nin war. So they di \u2014 really didn\u2019t know, didn\u2019t have the slightest idea. And they didn\u2019t\nknow how to treat us. What they would do? Every American, naive, goodhearted\nAmerican Joe would give you \u2014 this G.I. Joe would give you his k \u2014 K rations, his C\nrations, feed the heck out of you, give you a sh \u2014 Hershey bar, and then top it off with\na cigarette, with a Camel cigarette. And in the meanwhile, they were killing you,\nbecause th \u2014 our bodies couldn\u2019t take the food. The mal-nutritious body just could not\ntake that type of treatment. Then the medics came, so what did they do? They came to\nthese camps and they took their uniforms off and burned them, and put on whatever\nclothes they could get from UNRRA, from any organization, they start putting clothes\non us. As good as they were, thousands and thousands of survivors died after ha \u2014 after\nthe \u2014 after liberation.",
        "Q: Just because they didn\u2019t know what to do for you.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t know what to do with us, until the medical groups came when they\nfinally decided that that\u2019s not the way to treat them. And then, of course, then they\nopened the displaced person camps, and which I was not part of ba \u2014 part of one, but \u2014\nand I\u2019ve seen displaced person camps, and let me tell you, I\u2019m glad I wasn\u2019t a part of\none, because displaced person camps were just like camps. They were not like Nazi \u2014\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Michael Vogel. This is tape number one, side B. And as the tape was ending you\nwere explaining that because of malnourishment, that when you would \u2014 when the\nG.Ls in their \u2014 in their well-meaning way would give you food that was too rich for\nyou and in too large quantities and that it \u2014 your bodies couldn\u2019t handle it. What was it\nlike for you when they first gave you food?",
        "A: Well, when I was picked up at the United States forces, and \u2014 and the field kitchen\nwas operating, you \u2014 you \u2014 they had all field kitchens, I don\u2019t know if you know what\na field kitchen is, but it\u2019s an army unit kitchen. And they tried to f \u2014 they fed me too,\nand I had a problem. The first thing 1s, the food went right through me. And I was very\nfortunate, we had a medic on \u2014 with us, a medical unit with us, and they gave me some\n\u2014 some \u2014 some coal tablets, you know, charcoal tablets to stop \u2014 stop my \u2014 my \u2014 my \u2014\nmy \u2014 my \u2014",
        "Q: Diarrhea?",
        "A: Diarrhea. And one of the doctors tried to s-say di \u2014 don\u2019t give him so much food,\nyou know. Of course that\u2019s easy for \u2014 for him to say don\u2019t give me so much food,\nbecause he didn\u2019t stand in the chow line wi \u2014 like I did. I had a [indecipherable] on\nthe chow line and I piled it up. Of course, it got better with me, I was one of the\nfortunate ones for this reason, because I was a Kanada worker, I was also in a better\nphysical shape than the other prisoners were. So I had a little more. Although I had\nswollen eyes and swollen feet and swollen hands from malnutrition, but I was not as\nbad off as the other ones. So it took less time for me to digest \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to be able\nto digest the food. And it took awhile, I would say it took a couple of weeks at least,\nbut I was always hungry. I was always the first one in the chow line. And then I st \u2014\nthen, of course, put me to work in the kitchen, see, and I was working you n \u2014 in \u2014 in\nthe mess kitchen. So that was even better. And we had a \u2014 we had a cook, this mess\nsergeant, I don\u2019t know if you know what a mess sergeant is. That\u2019s the guy who 1s 1n\ncharge of the army ki-kitchen. He has cooks under him. His name was sad sack, they\nused to call him sad sack. And he would kind of take care of me and we used to \u2014 he\nused to go into town and \u2014 and we used to \u2014 he-he was stationed in Furth, Germany,\nf-u-r-t-h, which is a s\u2014 a suburb of Nuremberg. But I found out of course, many\nyears later, Henry Kissinger came from Furth. And he would go to this small town,\ngo to the farm, steal a few chickens, steal some fresh milk and bring them back to the\nG.Ls, bring them back to the kitchen. And we had fresh eggs. Normally we used to\nhave powder eggs, the army powder eggs. And he would take me with him in the Jeep\nand we would go organize. The reason he took me with him, because I spoke German.\nFor a couple of cigarettes he would get anything he wanted in a farm \u2014 farm place. So\nfor me it\u2019s \u2014 didn\u2019t take as long to get down to the system where I could eat.",
        "Q: What other physical problems did you have once they \u2014 you were there with the\narmy\u201d?",
        "A: Well, at Auschwitz, my fingers and my toes were frozen. So, I had very poor\ncirculation in my \u2014 in my hands, in my feet, my blood circulation. And when I was\nexamined, which I can show you, when I was sworn into the United States Armed\nForces, when I was examined by the medical group of \u2014 in the army, they did find a\nlittle \u2014 they don\u2019t put it down there as much, but they found some wrong. I had\ncracked fingers, my fingers opened up because of the froze \u2014 ba \u2014 frostbite and same\nthing with my toes. My \u2014 all my hair fell off from my legs, and that was because the\nblood circulation was poor. And my fingers, even to this date, when it s \u2014 gets real\ncold, tips of my fingers get white, even with gloves on. So that was one medical\nproblem I had. Other than that, I didn\u2019t have too many problems, medical problems,\nexcept being afraid of doctors and not going to one and probably if I would have gone\nto doctors and they would have possibly gave me some sort of mediation to \u2014 to \u2014 to\nmake me better, I probably would have been better. But I\u2014 I \u2014 I healed quite fast.",
        "Q: Did the G.I.s there, did they ask you about what had happened to you? Were they \u2014",
        "A: I found some of them that got to be interested much later. See, when I was with \u2014\npicked up by the army, last days of ni \u2014 o-of March 19 twe \u2014 1945, first part of ma \u2014\nApril. April 6, 1945, President Roosevelt died, and I was already in with this unit. 74 \u2014\n774 tank battalion, and I remember over the army radio system came the news and\neverybody was so hushed up about it, so you know, President Roosevelt died. That\nwas April 6\", 1945. And by then I was getting, you know, much better. So some of the\nboys after the war, May 8\", 1945, some of the boys \u2014 I found a couple of Jewish boys\nin the sa \u2014 1n the unit. One would not eat un-kosher food, so he was given special \u2014\nspecial food. And this guy wanted to know more, a little bit more about it, and since he\nfound out that most of the Jews were murdered in Europe, so he started asking me the\nquestions, so I would talk to him a little bit about it. Then, was a chaplain there also,\nand the chaplain would ask, but very few people really cared, because you know, here\nwere these young boys, 19 \u2014 20 \u2014 21 years old boys away from those \u2014 4,000 miles\naway from their home, they would sing [sings] I'll be home for Christmas, 1945, you\nknow. Or singing that type of song and worrying about one thing only, letters from\nhome. Mail call was the biggest thing in the world because you were late \u2014 letter from\nyour mom, from your girlfriend, from your brothers, from your sisters and this was the\nbig thing. I was a small fry. Here I was, a Jewish boy who survived concentration\ncamps they knew nothing about. And not only they knew nothing about, some of them\ncould care less. To them a crap game was more interesting than my story, which I\ndidn\u2019t tell, to certain groups. I tell you, this Jewish guy, a Sephardic Jew, is a\u2014 came\nfrom a Spanish type of family, and he was very much interested. He was a religious\nperson and he wanted to know what ha \u2014 why did the Jew \u2014 why did they do it to Jews,\nhe would ask me. I wish I could tell you why they do it \u2014 did it to Jews. But the Jews\nwere the one earmarked for ba \u2014 to be \u2014 to be murdered. And he was the only one that\nI would conver \u2014 oh, and the teacher, sorry, Feldman, who came from Boston. He was\nanother one, he wanted to know what happened, because his parents and his\ngrandparents came from somewhere in eastern Europe. But other than that most of\nthem get a furlough to go to Paris to have a good time with the girls. That was the\nmain thing. Get a weekend pass, or go to town. We were stationed then still in\nGermany, but on the way from Germany towards France, because this unit, 770 \u2014\n774 tank battalion, these boys had enough points \u2014 and let me explain what the points\nwere. Points were, if you served in service that such and such \u2014 long time, you were\ngiven points for each month. And if you were married and had family, that was extra\npoints, so you could come home earlier. Now this bat-battalion, 774 tank battalion was\nready to go home in September 1945. Now here they go from Germany with a convoy\nwe going towards France. We ended up in the camp called Camp Lucky Strike.\nCamp Lucky Strike, the ne \u2014 Holocaust Museum has a photograph of me in the\nCamp Lucky Strike, in a tent picture, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m in a tent over there. Outside a tent,\nI\u2019m sorry. And now we come to LaHavre, France. And here\u2019s an interesting story.\nI\u2019m sure I told this to the Holocaust Museum, but I\u2019m going to repeat it if I \u2014 1f I did,\nso I\u2019]l repeat it. LaHavre, France was an embarkation, it was the \u2014 this ab \u2014 th \u2014\nwhere the camp \u2014 embarkation camp, this is where you got on ships to go back home.\nNow here is my unit going on a ship called Lieutenant Colonel James Barker. That\u2019s\nthe troop carrier. The na \u2014 that ship is named after this colonel. Now they don\u2019t know\nwhat to do with me. They wanted to put me on a ship, and I\u2019m ready to go. I would be\ngoing on the ship with them to go to United States. Well, Captain Yogerling(ph), who\nis an attorney from home says, we\u2019re gonna get him in trouble. What they wanted to\ndo, the other captain wanted to do, take him \u2014 go into Boston, to \u2014 tha-that was our \u2014\nthe \u2014 they would stop in Boston, we would get discharged in Boston, get our \u2014 get our\npapers in Boston, and then leave for Boston. Get our papers and everything else.\nDischarge papers. Well, Captain Yogerling(ph) felt 1f I\u2019m going to be put on a ship \u2014\nthe other captain said, let\u2019s take him on with us, put him on the ship and when we get\nto Boston, turning him in to the authorities, to immigration office, and tell them he\u2019s\ngot an aunt here he \u2014 he can go to his aunt. Now, Captain Yogerling(ph), who is an\nattorney from home, this is nuts, this is illegal entry to United States and he will be\npunished, he will \u2014 he will be sent \u2014 sent back to where \u2014 wherever they send him\nback. So Captain Yogerling(ph) decided un \u2014 took me on a Jeep, with my duffle bag \u2014\nand the guys collected money. The \u2014 the \u2014 my group, company A, which I was with,\nthey collected dollars to give me, you know, to \u2014 so I have some money with me. They\ntook me \u2014 Captain Yogerling(ph) drove me to Camp Home Run, which was \u2014 that\nwas the name of the camp, which was an embarkation camp, but I\u2019m going to tell you\nwhat the camp meant \u2014 may be an embarkation. Replacement troops. This is what the\ntroops will be coming to replace the troops that went home. And I went to the Camp\nHome Run, the Captain Yogerling(ph) took me with him, took me to the camp\ncommander. And the camp commander kind of welcomed me, they got \u2014 they stuck\nme with the name Chesskey(ph), you know, that was the \u2014 that was given to me\nalready by this unit. Captain Yogerling(ph) said that\u2019s what they call him,\nChesskey(ph). So I got into this camp, and what I be gi \u2014 what kind of job they give\nme? To be in charge of a officer\u2019s dry cleaning and laundry, manned by German\nprisoners, all right? First thing the captain of \u2014 of \u2014 of Home Run, Captain Home Run\ntells me who was in charge of us in that area. He says to me, Chesskey(ph), you\u2019re\ngoing to be working, you\u2019re going to be in charge of this laundry. Now, there are\nGerman prisoners there. We didn\u2019t come here to make concentration camps, we came\nhere to bring democracy. And that\u2019s what it was. I was there, I was sworn into the\nUnited States Armed Forces at Camp Home Run with another fellow, whose name is\nalso misspelled on the list you have, whose name was Raymond Delafonte(ph)\nQuinones(ph). He was a Spaniard, not Jewish. Now we sworn into United States\nArmed Forces. However, it was a wrong form, a regular army form. United States has\ntwo armies. Army of United States and regular army. Well, the colonel who swore us\nin tipped [indecipherable] over it and put down Army of United States, sent it to the\nwar department of Washington. Oh, I would say a couple of months later, came back\ndisapproved. Attached new forms to re-sign. In the meanwhile, my aunt was found in\nDetroit, Michigan. There was a Jewish chaplain whose na \u2014 are also from Chicago, in\nCamp Home Run, whose name was Michael Lipschitz(ph), and Michael\nLipschitz(ph), I to \u2014 showed him I f\u2014 my aunt was found too, by the Red Cross and\nby the army, what do I do? He went to the colonel, the company \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 th-the \u2014\nthe \u2014 the camp commander and he told him the story, so I didn\u2019t have to re-sign.\nRaymond Dellafonta(ph) Quinones(ph), soon as he signed the new papers, was\nshipped to South Pacific. And this what would happen to me. Now waiting for my\naunt papers to come, and the army papers came, the army gave me referral to go to\nCzechoslovakia go pick up some passports and \u2014 and \u2014 an-and birth certificates. But\nsha \u2014 never got a birth certificate. Passport I bought in \u2014 in Paris at the Czech embassy,\nand I came to this \u2014 and that\u2019s how I came to United States.",
        "Q: Where did you \u2014 did you go to Boston? Did you \u2014",
        "A: No. When I came to United States? No, no, I didn\u2019t go with \u2014 on a ship.",

And I\nwas on one of those planes and I was on the standby, and they had found a seat for me.\nAnd I came to United States May 10\", 19 \u2014 May \u2014 May 10\", 1946.

        "Q: What was that like?",
        "A: Scary, because first of all it was very noisy. Awfully noisy. We stopped in \u2014 in \u2014 in\nIceland. That\u2019s where we, I guess \u2014",

        "Q: How \u2014 how did you find them? How did you find out \u2014",
        "A: Oh they \u2014 I got my aunts \u2014 my aunt gave me the information. Oh, I got to \u2014 they\nwere the ones who helped my aunt to \u2014 to \u2014 to get transportation for me. There \u2014 they\nwere in \u2014 fur manufacturers in New York City, quite Orthodox religious. Very \u2014 in\nfact, very Orthodox religious. And I arrive on a Saturday, Saturday morning. So I went\nthrough the immigration office and you gotta pay head tax, six dollars head tax. And I\nhad money sewn in a duffle bag, but I didn\u2019t want to [indecipherable] duffle bag\n[indecipherable] because they told me that you\u2019re only allowed to bring so much\nmoney. I didn\u2019t have six dollars. So the immigration officer was a Jewish guy and he\npaid for me, and he says, I know. I saw y \u2014 I tried to call the Birman(ph) family, the\npeople that I went to, they lived in Brooklyn. And he says, don\u2019t even try calling him.\nThey won\u2019t answer this \u2014 the phone on a Saturday. So he put me on a subway to get to\nBrooklyn. And that\u2019s how I got to the people. I knocked on the door, I \u2014 and they\nwere \u2014 had the Sabbath lunch. I come over there and then they direct me to the\nbathroom, and what do I do in the bathroom? I shave. One of the son comes in he says,\nyou don\u2019t do this on Saturday. I come out, eat lunch, put a cigarette in my mouth. You\ncan\u2019t smoke on Saturday. So the old man, Mr. Birman(ph) says to me now, you know,\nI am not God\u2019s policeman, but you can\u2019t s-s-smoke here on Shabbas \u2014 on Sabbath. But\nthey were very, very lovely people. They helped me. In fact they \u2014 they took me to buy\nme the first suit. You know, they were the new manufact \u2014 in those days th-things\nwere still on ration, so to speak, you know there was a \u2014 nothing was \u2014 you couldn\u2019t\nbuy a shirt there \u2014 a shirt, or suits.

I told him I just came to America a few days ago. And asked\nme what languages you speak? I tell him. He said, go in the shipping room \u2014 the stock\nroom, see Joe Zwartney(ph). Zwartney(ph) spoke a number of languages, American\nborn Pole, Polish guy. He spoke Yiddish, he spoke Polish, he spoke Hungarian, he had\nall the languages, because that \u2014 that was a store.

This is Monday morning, Saturday 1s payday and everybody got\npaid in a small envelope, cash. He gave me 56 dollars, my first week\u2019s pay. That\u2019s a\nlot of money in 1946. So I stayed with him for almost six years and I learned the\nbusiness, then I became a shoe buyer, that\u2019s how I knew the New England shoe\ncompanies. And I stayed with him until six years, then I went to work for another\ncompany, and I ended up with the company I mentioned called Shopper\u2019s Fair.",

We had people that would do music, you know, all sorts of music and we\nhad people that were interested in our life stories. There was a guy who owned a\nsupermarket chain, a Jewish person who was a \u2014 quite a philanthropist. He hired a\nnumber of us \u2014 not me, but he hired a number of the boys to work on supermarkets.\nSome of them he made managers 1-1n there \u2014 in \u2014 in there \u2014 in s -- in some time, as \u2014\nas soon as they learned the tricks of the trade, so to speak. So we \u2014 we kind of kept to\nourselves, because \u2014 you know what they used to calls us? Greeners. Greeners mean\ngreen people.",
        "Q: New.",
        "A: New people, and greenhorns. They call us greenhorns. In Yiddish griners(ph). And\nthat\u2019s how we kept going. Soccer was really helpful to me. It got all the anxiety out of\nyou, the nervousness out of you. You kicked the ball you were kicking the Germans,\nyou know, an-and that type of thing. So \u2014 and of course I met some good people in\nsoccer too, some of the old time Germans who came here before us. One was the\nMetropolitan Life Insurance salesman, he\u2019s on the picture with \u2014 on th \u2014 on the soccer\nteam with us, he was our manager. And every person who played for him bought his \u2014\nbought the policies, and that was his business.",

        "A: Among ourselves, yes. Among ourselves we used to. You know, we didn't believe\nourselves that we still were free yet, you know, we were still, you remember what\nhappened there, you remember what happened here. And remember when you worked\nover there and you did over there, and then \u2014 and that type of \u2014 oh, Auschwitz always\ncame up. See, because we were one of the first ones 1n this country, and some of us\nwere old time survivors. You had some Polish Jewish boys there who not only\nsuffered in Auschwitz, but suffered before Auschwitz. They suffered in Warsaw\nghetto and Bialystok ghetto, Lodz ghetto. So these guys, from \u201941 on had a \u2014a hell of\na tough time with their \u2014 in their lives, lost all \u2014 everybody \u2014 I don\u2019t remember anyone\nof these boys who played on the soccer team that came with a sibling or a parent.

        "Q: Did you find that you were any more or less comfortable in their company than\nwith other \u2014",
        "A: No, because I soon became friendly with American \u2014 American boys. I met two\nbrothers, two Jewish boys, you know, Fleischer(ph) boys. Their name is \u2014 last name is\nFleischer(ph), Matt and Ben Fleischer(ph). And both of them were in armed servi \u2014\none was in the army, one was in the navy during World War II, and we became quite\nfriendly. And I-I st \u2014 I started to break away from that group and started to find more\nAmerican friends. Soon my wife and I \u2014 of course we be \u2014 we did belong to the\nnewcomer club, that \u2014 that we did, that we joined. It was a \u2014 it was a club that you\njoined and then it was all survivors. Or survivors married non-survivors. You know,\nlike one girl married an American, the other \u2014 the other boy married an American girl,\nyou know, that was \u2014 that ca \u2014 that type of a mixture. I-I-In the 40\u2019s, you know, the\nshidduch \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the matchmakers was \u2014 was \u2014 was \u2014 the still \u2014 still in\naction among the Jewish crowds, among the Jewish parents. You know, they would\nask who are you, what are you, how old are you? Boy, have I got a daughter for you.\nYou know, that type of story, see? So with me, it didn\u2019t work that way. I was going\nwith another girl before I met Agnes. I shouldn\u2019t say it so loud. And all this girl\nwanted to do was get married. And anything and anything \u2014 anything goes, but she\nwants to get married. And my aunt was in love with the girl. She thought she was the\ngreatest thing for me.

But we also had\nmeetings there with the \u2014 with the soccer team, the Jewish soccer team, these were\ncalled the Maccabees. And I would go to t\u2014 Thursday was our meetings and Thursday\nwas their school. So every time you went to the meeting, after the meeting I would\nwalk into the class \u2014 I knew the teacher, to look to see if there are new girls in the\nclass. Well, here I see this young, good looking lady, Agnes, with another man who\ncame with her, also a survivor and he walked her, 1t was \u2014 it was a walking distance\nfrom the me \u2014 it wasn\u2019t that far, maybe a mile walk.

        "Q: Do you \u2014 is it \u2014 is your anger at God? Is it \u2014",
        "A: God? I have a problem with God. I have an argument with God. Of course, he\ndoesn\u2019t answer me. I never lost the identity where I came from. Never lost that I was\nborn to a Jewish family. I was born to a God fearing Jewish family in easter \u2014 in\nEurope, in ch \u2014 in Slovakia. In fact, I was quite religious, for a number of years.\nWhen I got to Auschwitz I still had belief in religion, a belief in God, but I soon lost\nthat. If God wanted to punish us Jews, if we did something that terribly wrong, punish\nus for a day, a week or three da \u2014 whatever. But let us suffer from 1939 in Slovakia, in\nPoland, in Ukraine, in all the other European countries, from 1939 til 1945, let us\nbeing systematically murdered, thrown into the ovens. And me, working the ga \u2014\nworking that railroad tracks, and seeing that with my own eyes, knowing what these\nmass of thousands upon thousands of people were being herded like sheep, not\nknowing where they\u2019re going, I have an anger with God. I have a problem with God. If\nit wouldn\u2019t be for Agnes, I probably would never stepped in a temple, my foot in a\ntemple. She says, we have children, we have to do something. We have to let them \u2014\nlet them do, and then when they get older let them \u2014 let them lead their own way, but\nteach \u2014 show them the way first. Well, we did that. Our son was Bar Mitzvah, our little\n\u2014 our young \u2014 oldest daughter was Bat Mitzvahed, the other two weren\u2019t. But I still\nwhen I go to the temple I feel like \u2014 like a hypocrite. Where was God for three years,\nletting this happen, the systematic destruction of every Jew in Europe? That\u2019s my\nanger with God. You know, in Yiddish there \u2014 I\u2014 I \u2014 there\u2019s a saying, Ehob tsores\nwich hemas borach (ph). I\u2019ve got troubles with God, problems with God. Where were\nyou \u2014 wh-when \u2014 where were you? There\u2019s some time I\u2019m speak to a group of\nChristian churches, some \u2014 some guy came up to me after the questions and he\u2019s \u2014 he\n\u2014he may [indecipherable] while \u2014 while I was answering the question he cames up to\nthe \u2014 to the microphone and he says, but you Jews were the chosen people. So I, being\na sarcastic with a sick sense of humor, well why didn\u2019t God choose somebody else for\nthis? Why were we chosen to be burned and gassed? So th-th-this is my anger. I don\u2019t\nhave an ounce of hate in me. Anger 1s not hate, because if you hate, you die inside. I\u2019m\nangry because this happened, and I\u2019m angry because I\u2019m the only one from my\nimmediate family. Wouldn\u2019t that be wonderful if my brother would \u2014 could see his\nnieces and nephews being a success?",
        "Q: Were you ever suicidal?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Were you ever suicidal?",
        "A: Suicidal? No. No. In Auschwitz, yes, I thought about it, but outside of Auschwitz,\nnever. When I married and started to see my children, I said here is my life. This is\nwhat I want to live for. In Auschwitz I was this close from running to the fence, to the\nelectric fence.",
        "Q: A lot of people did that.",
        "A: I had typhus. 1943, I had typhus in Auschwitz, and I thought for sure that\u2019s the end\nof me. When you have typhoid fever in Auschwitz, your equilibrium, you lose that,\nyou lose hearing, totally. You don\u2019t hear. And if it wouldn\u2019t be for two guys that saved\nmy life in Kanada commando where I was working \u2014 under my ar \u2014 under my arms\nthey would drag me through the gates. When I got to Kanada commando, in a pile of\nclothes they would cover me up and bring me some water, hot water to drink, with \u2014\nwith lemon if they could find it among the packages that the Jews brought with them.\nAnd that\u2019s how they \u2014 that\u2019s how they helped me come out of it. If they would left me\nin the barracks, I would have been in the ovens. And that\u2019s when I wanted to walk to\nthe wires, and they stopped me. Unfortunately both of them died already. One died in\nNew York and one died in Slovakia.",
        "Q: You say you don\u2019t have an ounce of hate in you. Who do you \u2014 outside of having a\nproblem with God that you\u2019ve talked about, ha-have you struggled with who to blame\nfor what happened?",
        "A: The world. The world looked the other way. You know, we never believed that\nanyone knew about us. We never believed in Auschwitz that anybody knew what was\ngoing on because if somebody would believe, somebody would do something.\nSomebody would stop. When I got out of Auschwitz, it took many years to find out\nwh-who knew and who didn\u2019t know. United States knew in 1942 that there were Jews\nbeing murdered in th \u2014 in th \u2014 in \u2014 in the camps. They didn't have all the details, but\nthey knew. How did I find out? Through documentaries, through Shoah. Jan Karski,\nprofessor at \u2014 in Washington, Georgetown University. He was a Polish courier, he\ncame to this country, came to England, came to Switzerland. He was talking to these\npeople, to \u2014 to the presidents, the Churchill and no one wanted to do \u2014 they knew,\nthey believed, but didn\u2019t do anything about it. In my stay at Auschwitz, on two\noccasion the international Red Cross came. Once in Auschwitz one, and then in\nBirkenau the following year. Not one time did the Nazis let them into the barracks.\nWe were all lined up in a roll call place, standing sc \u2014 clean, with clean uniforms. They\ncleaned up the camp. You know what the cleaned up camp meant? They took all the\nprisoners who were looking like skeletons, or half skeletons, got them away from\nthere, right in the ovens. Showered us, so you can call the showers. Gave us clean\nstripes. And they would bring forward \u2014 they would talk to \u2014 they would put the best\nlooking guys forward, standing forward, and they would let them talk to somebody.\nHow are you treated? Oh fine, everything is great. Course, if you didn\u2019t say that\n[indecipherable] Red Cross leaves and you know what\u2019s going to happen to you. The\ncamp was swept clean there a \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 this \u2014 the grounds. That\u2019s how it was.\nSo who do you blame? You blame the world, knowing and not listening.",
        "Q: You know it\u2019s \u2014 to me it\u2019s interesting, because I didn\u2019t experience what you\nexperienced, that everyone I\u2019ve spoken to, and everyone I\u2019ve \u2014 whose memoirs I\u2019ve\nread or anything, directs their anger there, at the peep \u2014 at the rest of the world who s \u2014\nwho sat back and \u2014 and didn\u2019t do anything, rather than at the people who did do things,\nmeaning at the people at the \u2014",
        "A: Well, let me put you to the people who did their things, okay? You see, I blame the\nworld for not stopping the people who did it to us. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the first ones to\nblame. Now, let\u2019s go to the people that did it to us. Who did it to us? Not just the\nGerman Nazi SS, but the Slovakian Nazi guards, the Croatian Nazi guards, the\nRomanian Nazi guards, the Hungarian Nazi guards. These were all part of it. You\nknow, I had at Auschwitz a number of guar \u2014 Croatian guards who had SS uniforms\non, who were our guards. And these were the animals, these were the killers. They\nwere bigger killers in \u2014 1n a way sometimes than the Nazi Germans killers. I have\ntestified since 1982. \u201982 - \u00b090 - \u201991 - \u00b092 - \u00b093, against Nazis, former Nazi aw \u2014 guards\nand officers at Auschwitz. Out of those, three of them were not Germans. One was a\nLatvian, the one who elected to be deported. The other one, in 1990 I testified in\nHonolulu was a Yugoslavian. One in September I gave deposition on, two year \u2014 three\n\u2014 two years ago, a Slovak, from my country, and the other guy was a German.",
        "Q: So clearly it was not only the Germans, I mean this 1s \u2014",
        "A: Well, my own town, who picked me up, who picked up my family? Our owe \u2014 our\nbarber. Our family barber, his name was Martinchek(ph). This the guy who picked us\nup.",
        "Q: Let me ask you a question. I\u2019m embarrassed to say I can\u2019t remember th-the name of\nthe author, but youll know immediately the book I\u2019m talking about, the book that has\nbeen such a controversy in the past few years, the Harvard professor \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, \u201cHitler\u2019s Willing Executioners.\u201d",
        "Q: What did you think of that?",
        "A: I think it\u2019s one of the best piece of work ever done. Unfortunately it\u2019s written in \u2014\nin such a high college terms, cause this guy is an educator, he\u2019s \u2014 he did his thesis on\nthat, that it\u2019s \u2014 it \u2014 you have to read it twice to understand it, for the average person.\nBut this man did something that was gutsy, that was plain, plain gutsy. He finally said\nsomething that we as survivors hoped somebody would say. It was the average\nGerman, the average person. It was not the hierarchy of the Nazis who did this, it was\nevery German on the street that did this. This was Hitler\u2019s willing executioner. And\nyou couldn\u2019t get a better title in that in a book. It\u2019s th-the \u2014 the writer who wrote it, his\nname is Goldhagen. I\u2019ve got the book, by the way.",
        "Q: But would you add to that th-the Slovak on the street, the Croatian on the street, the",
        "A: I would add every member of the Slovakian community on the street for the simple\nreason, why did the Slovak did it here? The Nazis told them, get rid of the Jews, you\nknow what\u2019s gonna happen? You\u2019re going to get their businesses, you\u2019re going to get\ntheir homes, you\u2019re going to get their monies. Now they got greed and \u2014 and anti-\nSemitism they had to begin with. They need \u2014 they didn\u2019t need \u2014 they didn\u2019t need\nmuch pushing and shoving. The \u2014 wh-who put me in the cattle cars? Wasn\u2019t the Nazis.\nI never seen a Nazi put me in the cattle car. Was \u2014 was the Slovak guards who, with\nhis wife \u2014 with his rifle butts and \u2014 and bayonets that start sticking into you, shoving\nyou into the cattle cars. Goodbye Jews. These were their famous words, they were the\n\u2014 they would all say goodbye Jews, good riddance. The guy who took my father\u2019s\nbusiness became a Nazi. This \u2014 this [indecipherable] Martinchek(ph) who was a\nbarber, he took another guy\u2019s name, Benow(ph), Desdair(ph) Benow\u2019s(ph) business,\nhe \u2014 he worked for him before, now he\u2019s got his business. He put him in the oven \u2014 in-\ninto the \u2014 into the cattle cars. So these were there. Neilosh(ph) in Hungary, the same\ntype of Nazis, and Romania had them. Yugoslavia had all the Croats. Franjo\nTrudman, th-the president of Croatia 1-is a big shot. He was invited to come to the\nopening of the Holocaust Museum, I almost died, I almost \u2014 almost \u2014 pardon the\nexpression, threw up when I\u2019ve seen him. Here comes a Croatian, I don\u2019t care how\nyoung he is, but his father was a Nazi and so is he and they\u2019re bringing him to the\nopening of the Holocaust Museum in Washington. He had no business there. He\ncertainly was not a Righteous Gentile. These were the \u2014 these were the \u2014 these were\nthe Hitler\u2019s willing executioner, not only in Germany, but in Poland, in Ukraine, in\nSlovakia. Every eur \u2014 Nazi European country wa-wa \u2014 wa \u2014 these people collaborated\nwith the Nazis. Slovakia became a fascist country. We had a president, who was he?\nJosef Tiso, a Catholic pis \u2014 a priest. Very close to my hometown, that\u2019s where he\ncame from. Anti-Semite. Jews the Christ killers.",
        "Q: But you say you don\u2019t hate?",
        "A: No. No. In spite of all that, I don\u2019t hate. But what I wa \u2014 what I say is this, when the\ntrial is begun, and I\u2019m not talking about the trials one by one, I\u2019m talking \u2014 the biggest\nfarce were the Nuremberg trials. They brought a few of these bigwigs into the trial, pe\n\u2014 few of them, nicht schuldig, not guilty, hm? Well, my dear friend, where was the\nrest of the world, of the Nazi world, that wasn\u2019t tried? What happened to the Nazi\nguards, to the Nazi officers who ran these over a hundred concentration camps and\ndeath camps? Where are they? Living the life of Riley, if they\u2019re still alive today,\nwhich mo \u2014 a lot of them are. What happened to them? Absolutely nothing. In the\nSoviet prison they were mistreated, were beaten, sometimes they were starved,\nwhatever, big deal. By the Americans? A slap on the wrist, two months in prison,\nreleased, go back home. Nothing happened to them. They were never on trial. These\nwere the killers, these were \u2014 they should have been on trial. The-These few people\nthey had lined up the Nuremberg trials, the few hotshots, the few Nazi leaders, that\u2019s\nnothing. They did nothing. United States should be ashamed for even pe-performing\nthat trial over there. That was an \u2014 absolutely a farce, nothing to it. The words of my\ncaptain, Chesskey(ph), we didn\u2019t come here to make a concentration camp, we came\nhere to bring democracy. Beautiful, bring democracy. But punish the animals who\nwere killing my father and my mother and my sister and my brother. Nothing was\npunished, nothing was done.",
        "Q: Do you think that if all of the guards and all of the \u2014 the people who were in charge\nat Auschwitz, the people that killed your family, if they were all executed, would you\nfeel better?",
        "A: Not \u2014 they don\u2019t have to execute them. Don\u2019t have to execute them. Bring them on\ntrial, and bring the survivors to be witnesses. Bring the survivors to force these guys to\ntell their life stories, what they did. You know, I testified against a guy named ha \u2014\nHanscun(ph) \u2014 Heinrich Hans Kunneman(ph) in Germany, in Dussberg, Germany\nin \u00b091 - \u201992 and \u201993, three times. Actually five times, because two times here, also, you\nknow, at the \u2014 at the German \u2014 at the German consulates in Chicago and Detroit. Here\nis aman who was in charge of \u2014 of the counter-commando, one of the counter-\ncommando pris \u2014 Nazis, in front of my eyes murdered a little boy about six years old.\nHow did he murder him? We were unloading a transport of Jews coming into\nAuschwitz. This little boy is sitting inside a cattle car crying. Hans Kunneman(ph) ha\n\u2014 his name is Heinrich, Hans Kunneman(ph) tells me, go pick up that Jew. Pick up\nthe little boy, set him down, kid is still crying. Kunneman(ph) walks by the kid\nbecause he starts to stop him from crying. With his boot he kicks the kid in the head\nand kills him right there on the spot. Little, little shaver, little kid. Ta \u2014 tells me to pick\nup the sack of Jewish shit and \u2014 and bring him to the rest of the people. There I am\ncarrying the limp body of his little boy. Hans Kunneman(ph) was then already\ntraining to be an opera singer, okay? As he walks away from killing the je \u2014 little\nJewish boy, he is whistling an operatic tune. Singing and whistling an operatic tune\nlike nothing happened. 90 \u2014 in 1990 I got a call from Germany from a prosecutor. I\u2019ve\ngot your name from such and such person, would you be willing to give us a testimony\nagains \u2014 against a former Nazi. Didn\u2019t tell me who. Course we meet in Chicago at the\nger \u2014 German consulate \u2014 the German consulate on Michigan Avenue, so when? It\u2019s\nlike day after Thanksgiving. So I go over there for Chicago, they bought me a flight\nticket or whatever, I\u2019m in a hotel and I get there. I testify all day, from nine o\u2019clock in\nthe morning to break for lunch, til six o\u2019clock in the evening. He opens up a book of\nphotographs then, not today, then photographs with the uniforms and everything on.\nIdentify this man on three different photographs, plus three other Nazis who also\nworked in the same position. Then I was taken to Germany following summer with\nmy wife. Identified them over there just as easy. This a \u2014 this was a tribunal. Eight\njudge tribunal, not a\u2014 not a\u2014 a\u2014a jury trial. I had a interpreter, and the \u2014 and the\nGerman attorney sitting next to me. There was Kunneman(ph) sitting, he had a court\nappointed doctor with him, he claimed to be very sick, and these eight judges. And I\u2019m\ntestifying and testifying. And I was asked, the third time I testified, what would you\nlike that should happen, you know, cause otherwi \u2014 I knew I testi \u2014 because there was\nother people testifying. But they brought 17 guys to testify against him. 17 former\nprisoners. Not one of us meet each other \u2014 met each other. You came on the Saturday,\nstayed for three days and then you went to court, then you left, then the other guys\ncame on a Saturday. One guy at a time. So I was asked by one of the judges, how\nwould I \u2014 what would \u2014 what would I feel that should happen here? After all, with\nyour testimony the man should be sentenced. Well, I said, I really don\u2019t care if you\nsentence him. I just want one thing from you people. If this man will be willing to do\nwhat I\u2019m doing. I speak about my experiences as a Holocaust survivor. I go to\ncolleges, universities, high schools, civic, religious organizations. Let him come with\nme. Let him tell his \u2014 his story about what he did in Auschwitz for the 18 months that\nI knew him on the ramps. For the 18 months that he would direct people, select people\nto the gas chambers or to slave labor. Let him tell what he did and I\u2019Il tell mals \u2014 my\nstory. The two of us together. That would be enough of a sentence for me. And that\u2019s\nthe kind of sentence I was hoping the masses of the Nazis would get. The masses, in\nevery German community. They should be taken to court with so \u2014 Holocaust\nsurvivors to be there and talk about it and tell them and force them to \u2014 to admit that\nnot I followed orders like \u2014 like I was told, to do \u2014 what to do, I only \u2014 even\nEichmann in 1961, what he said in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in Israel? I followed orders. Well, tell\nme why did you followed orders? You tell this to your community, in front of a\nsurvivor who is mentally and physically able to testify. That is what I am saying them\n\u2014 should happen to the masses. Not once of all these times I testified did I walk out of\nthe courtrooms with a lighter heart, just satisfied that something was done, because\nthere wasn\u2019t. One damn Nazi in Honolulu called me a liar. He was being tried, he\ncalled me a liar. He admitted being on the railroad tracks. He admitted walking and\nmarching prisoners from and to slave labor. And that\u2019s what I told, he was a killer and\nhe calls me a liar. And what happened to him? He was deported to Germany. Big\ndeal. I was told that there will be a trial again in Germany, you will be called. This\nwas seven years ago.",
        "Q: I was just thinking of \u2014 I don\u2019t mean to make a na \u2014 a direct analogy but I know\nthat there are like drunken drivers who have killed people, who go talk to children in\nschools and say, you know, this is where this led me, this is what I did. Learn from me.\nDo you think that if\u2014 if these guards and officers and \u2014 were to do what you\u2019re talking\nabout, that it would have much of an impact on \u2014",
        "A: On the civilization, or on me?",
        "Q: On civilization.",
        "A: Yes, it would have much impact because you see, Holocaust became fashionable\nthe last number of years. It wasn\u2019t fashionable as soon as we got out of there. Took \u2014\nyou know, it took Meryl Streep, with the worst piece of drecky work, worst piece of\ncrappy film, called, \u201cThe Holocaust,\u201d or whatever y-you \u2014 yeah, it\u2019s called \u2014 was\ncalled \u201cThe Holocaust.\u201d It made her a star. It was the worst piece of junk that was\never produced in ho \u2014 it\u2019s Hollywood, you know, it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s a\u2014 it\u2019s a plastic. But\nwhat was good about it? That was \u2014 they had two, two things. One, the worst film.\nSecond, it had the best thing. It got the attention of the pub \u2014 the general public. Well,\nthis is what the general public now wants today. Holocaust is a very fashionable thing,\nnot only because of Spielberg, because of Shoah, and any \u2014 any piece of \u2014\ndocumentary on Holocaust, true or not true \u2014 I-I shouldn\u2019t say not true, accurate or\nalmost inaccurate, it has some affect on people. Now, Anne Frank has an affect on\npeople. These guys would have a big affect if they would go to colleges and\nuniversities, schools and civic and religious organizations. Oh yeah, lot of s \u2014 lot of\nour population wouldn\u2019t want to hear that. They won\u2019t listen to it. Not because they\ndon\u2019t want to hear, but because they don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u2014 that should be done. I-In\nGermany nobody wanted to do it. Listen, his book, hi \u2014 \u201cHitler\u2019s Willing\nExecutioners\u201d was the biggest seller in Germany. He drew more crowd in Germany\nwhen he was lecturing there, and there was boycotts there. Yet, this is what the people\nshould hear. You know, pretty soon there won\u2019t be any survivors left. We\u2019re getting to\nbe old people. Now, I\u2019m not \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I consider myself still one of the younger guys,\nbut at the same time, every day you got less and less \u2014 there\u2019s less and less of us\naround. A-A-Auschwitz will only be a legend. Now who\u2019s gonna \u2014 other than the\nHolocaust Museum which I\u2019m doing today, which I did in 1989 for the Holocaust\nMuseum, who 1s going to be here? Just this. There won\u2019t be a living person to be able\nto say things like I say, or like other survivors who are capable of talking. So these\nguys should go out there and do that. And let me tell you, they would have a great\naudience. Very \u2014 there are so many people that are hungry to know why it happened,\nbecause ho \u2014 there are not that many of us that go to schools and colleges and\nuniversities. You know, some of us are getting so old that we \u2014 we \u2014 we fantasize. You\nknow, some people fantasize and I get very upset with it, you know. If they don\u2019t\nremember what happened to them, th-the-they say something different. And that\u2019s\nwhat gets me very upset. And that even gots me u \u2014 gets me upset with sp \u2014\nSpielberg\u2019s interviews. I will not be interviewed by Spielberg, no way, no how. But\nlet\u2019s leave that alone.",
        "Q: Well, no, no, not really, because one of the things I was eventually going to ask you\nis your critique of the books and the movies and the things that have come about in the\npast, really, mostly the past decade.",
        "A: Yeah, til 10 years. I mean, the bi \u2014 1t wasn\u2019t \u2014 well, it became fashion \u2014 the\nHolocaust became fashionable. I call it the fashionable time for the Holocaust.",
        "Q: So \u2014 so it\u2019s \u2014 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s not germane to this interview to your perspective as\none who was there, about how you feel about how it\u2019s been documented, accurately,\ninaccurately, inappropriately, appropriately. In the \u2014 1n the various ways that people\nhave tried to do. So I \u2014 that was actually something I was going to ask you about.",
        "A: Well, anything done in Hollywood, to me, got me upset, including Simon\nWiesenthal\u2019s story, when he was \u2014 did some \u2014 Simon Wiesenthal did some stuff.\nAnd I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m very disturbed with Simon Wiesenthal\u2019s presentation of the \u2014 of the\ntelevision movies. It didn\u2019t happen like that, number one and then it\u2019s a fantasizing\nthere a little bit. I\u2019ve seen these rubber blown up bodies being taken in Mauthausen\nconcen \u2014 Mauthausen concentration camp, which is wrong, totally wrong, you don\u2019t\ndo these things. You want to do something? Make a documentary. Documentary which\n\u2014 which you know how to do. The best ever film on Holocaust was \u201cThe Shoah.\u201d The\neight and a half hour program by Lanzmann, the Frenchman who did it. This was a\npiece of work that is the best. Other than that, I haven\u2019t seen very li \u2014 I\u2019ve seen very\nlittle that I would recommend. Oh yeah, the people will watch it \u2014 which I\u2019m glad\nthey\u2019re watching, because it [indecipherable] gets the attention. But a Spielberg\nmovie? When I first found out that Steven Spielberg is going to make the Schindler\nstor \u2014 \u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\u201d at first I was wondering. I says, here is a guy who Is going\nto make a Holocaust movie. He is a man who made \u201cE.T,\u201d what is he going to do with\nthe Holocaust? You know, he\u2019s got Indiana Jones and \u201cE.T.\u201d Well, when the \u2014\n\u2018\u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d came to town, here to Indianapolis, I was invited as a Holocaust\nsurvivor to be there for special presentations, and I went. Here comes the elite Jewish\ncommunity of Indianapolis, some of the elite guys, some of the big givers, what do\nyou call, they come there. Everyone\u2019s got a popcorn in their \u2014 bag in their hand, puts\ntheir feet on \u2014 on \u2014 on the other seat and stretch themselves, I hope there\u2019s a \u2014 there 1s\na nice popcorn movie tos \u2014 to watch. So here I am listening, watching, and watching\nbecause [indecipherable] what \u2014 what this guy could do, what he did with it. And I\nwalked out of there really almost satisfied that he did a good job. If he\u2019d shown any\nmore atrocities than he showed in the film, I don\u2019t think people could have sit through\nit. Some of it was a little schmaltzy. I was a little bit \u2014 you know, I watched it so\nclosely. When Oskar Schindler said at the end, I should have done more, I should\nhave done this, I should have that, I \u2014 I\u2019d\u2014I didn\u2019t do enough, I should have saved\nmore people, those words, well that was a little schmaltzy to me, you know. Th-That \u2014\nthat \u2014 that they could have left out. Yes, Oskar Schindler did help. There\u2019s 5,000\nsurvivors of that group that are alive today because of him. You know, 5,000 members\nof the families that came la \u2014 after. So that \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 1t was fairly \u2014 done fairly decent.\nBut the other ones, I don\u2019t remember of any other one, other than Sobibor, \u201cEscape\nFrom Sobibor,\u201d I\u2019m sorry, that was done because they found people that survived\nSobibor and these were the people that helped, same as Oskar Schindler got the \u2014 got\nthe book from a \u2014 from a \u2014 from the luggage store in \u2014 in L.A. and here\u2019s these guys\nfrom th \u2014 Long Island, New York who were Sobibor survivors, they helped with the\nmovie. Well, that was almost \u2014 pretty accurate. But other than that, there is nothing.\nAbsolutely nothing. Kirk Douglas was in the movie one time, and I \u2014 I tell you\nsomething, I \u2014I was going to go over there and kick the hell out of him for that movie.\nBut if \u2014 but you di \u2014 what it 1s, the American public. They eat it up. They listen to it,\nthey want to know. See, I\u2019d \u2014I\u2014I become like a \u2014 like \u2014 like a Mattel toy, somebody\nwind you up and you keep going. Because all of a sudden they said, oh you \u2014\nHolocaust? Call Mike Vogel. All right, so th - Mike Vogel, ah \u2014 wind you up, send\nyou to the school. You know, that type of stuff. \u2019ve got enough here to write a book\njust \u2014 just for the letters I'd received from universities, colleges, civic and religious\norganizations, just \u2014 just the letters that they talk about my \u2014 my being there.",
        "Q: Let me ask you a question. Because you\u2019ve done so much public speaking and \u2014\nand you\u2019ve told your story so often, 1n \u2014 since that time when your daughter, in eighth\ngrade \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 when you went to her class \u2014 I don\u2019t know how to ask this question properly, and\nI mean no disrespect \u2014",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Michael Vogel. This is tape number two, side B, and I was asking Mr. Vogel\nwhether through repetition of telling your story in all the many times that you\u2019ve told\nit now, whether it has lost for you any \u2014 any connection to your emotions, or \u2014",
        "A: It\u2019s a very good question. You know, although the story is the same, it\u2019s not the\nsame. Like some \u2014 some \u2014 on many occasions, many places, comes out \u2014 you know,\nstarts out a little different. It depends. Lot of time I\u2019m looking at the audience. I \u2014 the\nstories \u2014 I\u2014 I can\u2019t change the stories, I can\u2019t exchange my style of it, I \u2014 but I tell it,\nbut sometime it\u2019s much stronger, or sometime it\u2019s a little weaker, depending on the\naudience. But it\u2019s not \u2014 I don\u2019t feel it repetitious. I tell it from day one, before, during\nand after the Holocaust. And \u2014 an-and it\u2019s not a routine. It always like a new story, if\nyou know what I\u2019m saying. And when it becomes even more interesting, it depends on\nthe audience, their questions. When their questions come, and when you talk to\ngraduate students, when you talk to clergy, when you talk to people that are really\nknowledgeable, that \u2014 that some are even scholars, a-and book writers, then it becomes\neven more powerful. You gotta remember, when I\u2019m speaking to high school students,\nI don\u2019t get the same questions from high school kids that I get from a graduate student.\nSo it becomes more powerful. And a lot of times it\u2019s surprising, some of these private\nschools, like high schools and even middle schools, ask a better question than some of\nthe college students.",
        "Q: That\u2019s what I was going to ask you, whether there\u2019s exceptions that rule.",
        "A: Exception to that rule, yes.",
        "Q: Do you have any \u2014 I realize you\u2019ve done this many times, but is there anything that\njumps out at you, an anecdote of \u2014 you know, out of the mouths of babes, some\ninsightful question that \u2014",
        "A: I wish I could.",
        "Q: Here I am, I-I\u2019ve gotten through a \u2014 a tiny bit of the questions that I \u2014 that \u2014",
        "A: You got more to go?",
        "Q: This is terrible. I mean terrible only that I\u2019m taking so much of your time. There\nwere a couple more. This is \u2014 I \u2014 I apologize for \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, right, right.",
        "Q: \u2014 for not being better organized with this, but there are a few more questions that\nthey wanted me to ask you that still pertain to the video interview that there were a\ncouple of holes in.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: They wanted me to ask you about the trans part from Auschwitz.",
        "A: To?",
        "Q: Where you were going next. Was that \u2014",
        "A: Sachsenhausen.",
        "Q: Sachsenhausen. Did you \u2014 did you know where you were going?",
        "A: No. When they uprooted us nighttime from the barracks, Kanada commando was\ndissolved already. There were no more transports coming in. This is October 1944. We\nthought for sure that they\u2019re taking us to the gas chambers because we\u2019ve seen so\nmuch, number one. Of course we didn\u2019t know that \u2014 we thought we were the last Jews\nalive to begin with. Now, here we go to the railroad tracks, and there are cattle cars\nwaiting for us. And guards went with us, some of the guards went with us, only up to\nthe camp, and then that is the last time we\u2019ve seen them. We n \u2014 did not know what we\ngoing. Now we come to Sachsenhausen, and there is no room for us in\nSachsenhausen in the barracks, because there\u2019s more prisoners in \u2014 everybody is on\nthe street of the camp, not knowing where I \u2014 why and what. We find out from the\nother prisoners who came a little after us, that the Russians are already very close to\npole \u2014 they are in Poland now. They could hear \u2014 hear the shots and that\u2019s why they\nwere taken away from there. So now we found out why. And then, of course,\nSachsenhausen is very close to Berlin. The Americans and the British were bombing\nBerlin like crazy. And yet, there were still killings.",
        "Q: Let me step back a little bit.",
        "A: All right.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a r-reasonably long trip, isn\u2019t it?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember exactly how many hours, but say it was \u2014 Auschwitz was close to\nborder of \u2014 the Czech and German border too. I would say five, six, seven hours,\nmaybe longer.",
        "Q: Oh okay, all right. What I was wondering about and what they were asking about\nis. [ha\u2014I realize you\u2019d been at Auschwitz for quite some time at \u2014 I mean you \u2014 wa \u2014\nyou \u2014 was \u2014 I\u2019m trying to understand what it was like for you to be leaving and \u2014 and\nto be \u2014 have this uncertainty of where you were going, and I mean, to jus \u2014",
        "A: Well, we were like robots, it was \u2014 first of all, they don\u2019t give you time to think,\nyou couldn\u2019t think. Among ourselves we would say, oh my God, where we going?\nAmong ourselves. Think they\u2019re going to take us to kill us now? They \u2014 we figure they\ncleared some \u2014 some wooded area, shoot us and that\u2019s the end of us. First we thought,\nif they make a left turn as we marching, gas chambers. But they didn\u2019t make a left\nturn, where we going? Pe \u2014 cattle cars. Now we come to sa \u2014 Sachsenhausen. We\ndon\u2019t know what we doing here. No more slave labor camps, no more slave labor\n[indecipherable] no \u2014 no \u2014 no place to go.",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 we \u2014 were you talking amongst yourselves in the car?",
        "A: Oh sure, sure \u2014",
        "Q: Cause it seems like \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 sc \u2014 I went with three of my friends who were my partners. One had died in\nIsrael, one died in Slovakia. Sydler(ph), you have \u2014 you got his name on \u2014 on the list\nthere, misspelled.",
        "Q: That\u2019s why the list is there, so you can afterwards spell them properly.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: How long did you spent in Sachsenhausen?",
        "A: I would say couple weeks.",
        "Q: What was it like there, aside from being crowded? What \u2014 what did you do, how \u2014",
        "A: Was har-hardly any food. Nothing. Just walked the camp and slept on the si \u2014 1n the\nsi\u2014 we didn\u2019t sleep inside the barracks, we slept on the \u2014 0-on the grounds. There was\nno room for us. Dogs and guards, people dying next to you. All the \u2014 all you tried to\ndo is to take off the \u2014 somebody\u2019s jacket so you can be a little warmer.",
        "Q: So s \u2014 you said it was October?",
        "A: October 1944.",
        "Q: So it was already starting to get cold?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Then how long were you in \u2014 in Landsberg?",
        "A: Until March 1945.",
        "Q: So that\u2019s how long?",
        "A: From end of October \u2014",
        "Q: To March \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 to March 1945. In Landsberg \u2014 the only labor that we did over there, we worked\nthe potato fields. They had some outside potato, buried potatoes and stuff. For the\nwinter they would bury potatoes, you know, they had these potato like \u2014 like \u2014 like a\nlittle grave it looks like, you know what I\u2019m saying?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And we would dig out the potatoes for food. And I was one of the fortunate ones,\ngot the job in the potato field and I used to organize potatoes for my \u2014 for my friends\nin the camp.",
        "Q: You mentioned briefly that \u2014 that you left Auschwitz with two close friends. What\nhappened to them?",
        "A: Okay, one was Jacob Buchler, b-u-a \u2014 b-u-c-h-l-e-r, and the other one was\nSydler(ph), his name was Pishta(ph) in Slovak. And both of these men \u2014 I ra \u2014 I left\nthem and I ran from \u2014 you know. Both of these men ended up in Slovakia, back in\nSlovakia. Sydler(ph) ended up in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia. Buchler went\nback to our hometown, which 1s called Topol\u2019\u20acany. Buchler and his nephew, and \u2014\nand his sister, some \u2014 some of them that survived, ended up in 1948 in Israel. In 1981\nmy wife Agnes and I went to the first gathering of Holocaust survivors in Israel, June\n11\", 1981. I did not see Buchler, I spoke to him on the phone. He, for some reason\ncouldn\u2019t make it, he was not feeling well, and we were talking. That\u2019s the last time I\nspoke to him and then he died in \u201985. However, his nephew, whose name is Robert, or\nYehasure(ph) Buchler became a historian, went to schools, and as a matter of fact, I\njust seen him last week in Israel. I\u2019ve got a book here with me which 1s in Slovak\nabout our hometown. Every member of that community of my city 1s \u2014 that was\nmurdered by the Nazis, including my family, is listed in this book. The other man,\nSydler(ph) ended up in Bratislava, worked there for awhile. I\u2019ve got letters from him\nat home now. He \u2014 only thing he wanted to do, we should meet and go together back\nto Auschwitz and then go and beat every Pollack in the \u2014 in \u2014 in the streets. That\u2019s\nwhat he writes in the Slovak letter. And unfortunately, he wasn\u2019t well when he left\nAuschwitz. He \u2014 he was quite ill, and he died quite young. I would say he died before\n1970. Oh, hell yes, before 1970 because in 1964, I \u2014 I lived in Michigan City, that\u2019s\nthe last I heard from him. Indiana. And so, he died there, in Bratislava.",
        "Q: You talk about not being able to cry in Auschwitz. \u201cYou Cried, You Died,\u201d the \u2014\nthe film you mentioned. What do you mean by that?",
        "A: Well, you see, if you showed weakness to the Nazis, they liked that. They killed\nyou for \u2014 for it even easier. But if you showed that you were \u2014 still had a little \u2014 little\ngutsy strength in you, they \u2014 they respected that a little better, if you can call it respect.\nYou know, they \u2014 the \u2014 this guy I testified against, Hans Kunneman(ph), Heinrich\nKunneman(ph), he had the expression, when he would see you after so many weeks,\nafter week he sees you, you\u2019re still alive, you\u2019re still working, you\u2019re still striving, he\nwould greet you, Du alter bandit, du lebs noch. You old bandit, are you still alive?\nAnd he said it with such a respect that you still fought the system, that you still\nsurvived the system, see? So, if you showed crying, you might as well lay down and\ndie. I couldn\u2019t cry for my father. First time I was able to cry for him, it was January 27,\n1985, when I took my two children with me, when I showed them the window which I\nseen my fa\u2014 my father from \u2014 through, on the barrack that he was taken. Took me a\nlong time. When I said Kaddish over there for my father in front of that window, that\u2019s\nwhen I broke down and cried for him.",
        "Q: Do you remember the first time you were able to cry at all when you came back?",
        "A: When I came to this country? When my daughter got engaged to be married.",
        "Q: That was the first time?",
        "A: That was the first time. I couldn\u2019t \u2014 I couldn\u2019t cry. Every once in awhile when I\nspeak now, and the question comes out s \u2014 a little stronger than \u2014 a little more\npersonal, about my parents, about my father, about my sisters, about my mother, once\nin awhile I hold back the tears and \u2014 I cried last week in Israel. Now, here\u2019s why I\ncried last week in Israel. I was asked by the Jewish Welfare Federation of\nIndianapolis, when we go to the \u2014 with the family mission to Israel, when we get to\nYad Vashem, the Holocaust Memorial, would I be willing to address my group, the\nfellow \u2014 fellow \u2014 the travelers with me, at Yad Vashem, and I agreed to do so. Not\nonly did I address them, but I also got my friend, this Buchler, the historian to meet\nme there, he teaches there at the \u2014 at the Holocaust memorial. And he told the group\nhow I saved his life at Auschwitz, and that mi \u2014 made \u2014 made me \u2014 well, I broke down\nand cried. Took me a little while to calm down and tell my story after he left. So \u2014",
        "Q: Do you ever \u2014 once you started \u2014 when your daughter got engaged, was it any\neasier, thereafter?",
        "A: Yes. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it gets a little easier after you let it \u2014 let it loose, let go.",
        "Q: Cause that\u2019s quite a few years.",
        "A: Yes, \u201981. \u201981. I don\u2019t remember crying after \u2014 oh, maybe I \u2014 in my dreams maybe, I\nknow when I have some bad nightmares.",
        "Q: Can \u2014 what are your dreams like?",
        "A: Most of the time I try to make them pleasant, but \u2014",
        "Q: The bad dreams.",
        "A: The bad ones. The bad ones 1s Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Are there particular images that reoccur?",
        "A: See the faces. The faces of the Nazis. I can see every one of them. I can see them\nwhen I\u2019m talking to you now. I can see the faces on the railroad tracks. I can see\nMengele as clear as day. I\u2019Il never forget the beatings. The 25 on your behind if they\ncaught you with organizing food for other prisoners. As you were carrying the bundles\nof clothing to the women prisoners who did the cleaning and disinfecting of the\nclothes, and all of a sudden the cane crook \u2014 the handle of the cane is behind your\nneck, and your neck and he pulls you down, he drops you, you drop your bundle and\nhe pokes with that stick in the \u2014 1n there, in the clothes and he finds some food and he\n\u2014 before you even turn around he smacks you right over the head with the cane, and he\nwould ask, to what Jewish sow are you taking this? And of course, if you tell, the\nJewish girl is in trouble. If you don\u2019t tell, bend over, 25 on your behind. And you got\nto count. You count and he stops you. How many did I give you? 17. Wrong, all over\nagain. By the time he st-starts all over again you already fainted, you\u2019re already gone.\nSo those are the things. I\u2019ve got marks on my \u2014 on my \u2014 below my belt now which\nnever will go away. I\u2019ve got a mark on my neck right here from a shovel by a Nazi.\nThey didn\u2019t \u2014 life meant nothing to them.",
        "Q: You know I \u2014 when I was getting ready to leave to come here, I was talking to a\nfriend of mine and she said, would you ask him for me \u2014 that would be you \u2014 were\nthere any moments of humanity? Were there any guards or anybody that worked at the\ncamp, any of them that had little pockets of humanity?",
        "A: Tell her that\u2019s a very good question. The work that we did, the Kanada commando,\nunloading incoming Jews and then, after the Nazis sorted them, selected them, you die\nnow, you die later, then we start working with the belongings, with the artifacts. And\namong the artifacts is all sorts of watches, diamonds, rings, jewelry, because that was\nall confiscated. There were boxes for this merchandise, for these items. And the Nazis\nwould march back and forth, back and forth. They were not allowed to bend down and\npick anything up. But a Nazi would see a watch and he tells you, take that watch and\ntake it to the latrine with you. And he would march you \u2014 with you \u2014 behind you\ntowards the men\u2019s latrine. And you squat, as you got this watch in your pocket and you\nthrow it to him on the ground. He takes off his rifle and with his rifle head he picks up\nthe piece. So he\u2019s good to you for \u2014 for a day or so. But as far as compassion, as far as\nany feeling towards you, the only compassion feeling if they could benefit, because\nthey cou \u2014 they \u2014 they were all on the take. They all knew how. Everyone \u2014 every Nazi\nhad their own prisoners who would organize for them. So they took care of you for\nawhile. But if he sees his superior coming towards you, regardless of what you gave\nhim, he beat you just the same. So the compassion wasn\u2019t there. They had no\ncompassion, none whatsoever. Yeah, there were some people that \u2014 I know of \u2014 of a\nguy who knew a Nazi from his hometown, and he was the worst animal to him. So\nthere\u2019s \u2014 there was s \u2014 there was some of them that would throw me a piece of bread\nonly because you dealt with them, only because you gave them something. And they\nlet you organize. They turned their backs so you could eat. You know, turn their head\nand \u2014 and \u2014 an-and \u2014 and \u2014 and turn your \u2014 turn away so they couldn\u2019t \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t\nsee it, because if they seen it, they have to beat you. They knew we were eating,\nbecause they needed our hands at the railroad tracks.",
        "Q: Have you ever had \u2014 I think I know the answer to this, but have you ever had an\nopportunity t-to ever since the war, talk to anybody on the other side?",
        "A: What side?",
        "Q: Any of the guards, any of the \u2014",
        "A: Just in the trials. No-Not directly to them, through their attorneys, yes. We accuse\nthem of \u2014 of things that they did. As far as per \u2014 one on one, no, never met anyone. I\nmay have met some, but I did \u2014 you know, may have been one, but I didn\u2019t know who\nthey were, you know.",
        "Q: If you had that opportunity, would you take it?",

Let me tell you \u2014 this may not come \u2014\nthis has nothing to do with this question. I have a friend who is a president of PBS in\nRichmond, Virginia, okay? He name is Charles Sidna(ph), Jr., historian on Nazism.\nWrote a couple of books on SS. I met him the first time in 1990 in Honolulu. Last\nOctober he went to Germany and Austria with a number of historians for his ta \u2014\nconference on Nazi German \u2014 Nazi German Wehrmacht from 1941 to 1945. Among\nthem was also an SS guard, SS person who a \u2014 who was in there with him in the\ngroup. And here they are, they \u2014 there was a exhibit traveling to Germany, and there\nwas very much \u2014 a lot of protest against that exhibit in Germany. But they were there\nand talking, each one had their own \u2014 own \u2014 the work. You know, one \u2014 one was on\nthe Greek Jews, one was on \u2014",
        "Q: A specialty.",
        "A: Special \u2014 sp \u2014 oh \u2014 own specialty, see, thanks. Also there was an Israeli boy who I\nmet last week, my \u2014 from my hometown. He too was there, okay? He is a historian\nfrom Israel. So he was the only Jew, there was a guy from Czech Republic, there was\na guy from Poland, there was a guy from Austria, there was number of ca \u2014 people\nfrom Germany, and they were talking. And they were demonstrating against him.\nSome German took a canister of salt and threw it through the window ins \u2014 1n the\nbuilding with a sign, here is your Zyklon B gas. That\u2019s \u2014 that happened last fall, okay?\nSo my friend from Richmond, Virginia, the president of PBS, who made a film on\nme by the way, called \u201c65316\u201d and c \u2014 he calls me up and tells me what happened,\nand he also told me that he was there with an Israeli guy and he asked him where he 1s\nfrom, he told him from Slovakia and from where, from the s \u2014 my hometown. And he\nsays to him, I know a guy from that town, too \u2014 my friend from Richmond told him.\nHe says, he lives in the States. So the guy says, I know who, Mike Vogel. Mike Vogel\nsaved my life at Auschwitz. That\u2019s the guy I told you about. So here\u2019s a guy, pitches\nsalt, grain of salt like Zyklon B gas into these people. So you see, Nazism, some of\nthese animals, when \u2014 when someone shows, \u201cHitler\u2019s Willing Executioners,\u201d or\nsomeone goes there for this type of a purpose, they\u2019re still fighting it. They never\nadmit.",

        "A: Yes.",

        "A: Absolutely. I meet younger Germans not only in Germany, but I also meet them\nhere, in this country. Students, c-college students, graduate students. And the question\nalways comes, do I hate all Germans? Well, I said, I don\u2019t hate all Germans. However,\nall Germans my age and older, and some even younger were responsible for the\natrocities that happened to us, that \u2014 that was done to us. Even if they themselves did \u2014\nwere not involved in throwing us into the ovens, but they were part of the process, part\nof the organization, part of the hate, part of the people that killed us. However you, as\na young German, I can\u2019t hold you responsible for the atrocity that happened to us \u2014\ndone to us by a\u2014 by your grandparents. But when you go back home, ask your parents,\nif they were old enough, or your grandparents, what did they do from 1933 to 1945?\nWhat did they do to stop the atrocities? What did they do to stop Kristallnacht? What\ndid they do to stop deportation? What did they do to stop taking away Jewish shops\nand Jewish businesses? What did they do to burn Jewish temples? This is what you got\nto ask their parents, your parents and grandparents. But as far as hating you, I don\u2019t\neven hate your parents, let alone you.",
        "Q: I have a dif \u2014 perhaps a difficult question. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard all these questions\nat one time or another. Have you ever pondered if by a twist of fate you were not born\nJewish, but you were born German, or you were a Gentile Slovak in your hometown \u2014",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Have you ever pondered how you would have behaved?",
        "A: You know, I never thought about that, but I probably would have been the same as\nthe rest of them. I probably would have been same as the rest of them, because it was\ninbred in them. It would be inbred in me \u2014 inbred-ed in me, because as much as these\nSlovaks or Hungarians or Poles worked with Jews, worked for Jews or benefited by\nJews or whatever, they were partners with them, or they were \u2014 they were part of their\noperation, they all were anti-Semites. And I probably would have been one of them. I\ngrew up init. You know, I referee soccer in Indianapolis in the state of Indiana.\nThere\u2019s a German man named Hans Gut, came to this country in the 50\u2019s with his\nfather. And Hans 1s in his 50\u2019s now, or better. \u201cAuschwitz, If You Cried You Died,\u201d\nwas showing the first time in Indianapolis. It was shown nationally, but 1t was shown\nin Indianapolis that time, too. I went to do a high school soccer game and Hans Gut\nwas also one of their \u2014 one of \u2014 we were three referee \u2014 three \u2014 three people. There\u2019s\ntwo linesmen and a \u2014 and a \u2014 and a referee. And I was scheduled to do the game and\nHans is getting out of his car and I\u2019m getting out of my car from the park \u2014 school\nparking lot, we walked to the soccer field. And Hans Gut says to me, Mike, I\u2019ve seen\nyour film last night. But don\u2019t you think it\u2019s about time to stop this? Isn\u2019t that enough\nof blasting, basting the Germans, of constantly \u2014 constantly \u2014 he says to me, my father\nwas also in the Russian front. He says, he wa \u2014 he too suffered. I said, well Hans, let\nme tell you a little bit about my father. Your father was in Russian front. He had the\nguns, ammunition, clothes, boots. He was dressed. My father was stripped naked,\nstripped from his dignity, totally dehumanized, taken to the gas chambers, starved \u2014\nfirst starved, tortured. I said, my father didn\u2019t have a gun to turn around and shoot his \u2014\nshoot people who were putting him in the ovens. Your father didn\u2019t have to join the\narmy. My father was forced into go in the concentration camp and be killed. So what\nare you giving me this bullcrap about your father? So you see, people don\u2019t want to\nsee, the people don\u2019t want to hear. And especially German people.",

        "A: Mm, well, he\u2019s right. Not too many did it, cause if there were so many Righteous\nGentiles, why else \u2014 if there were so many, why so many of us died, why so many was\nkilled. Let me tell you my own personal experiment \u2014 experience with what you just\nasked me. First part of 1942, I was in a slave labor camp in Slovakia called Novaky.\nThere was a good friend of mine whose name was Josef Knap(ph), Kanap(ph) in\nSlovak, Knap(ph). Josef Knap(ph) had a Christian girlfriend, name was Terri(ph) \u2014\nTherese \u2014 ter \u2014 terra \u2014 terries \u2014 Th-Therese. Him and I escaped together from\nNovaky. He knew his way pretty well, he was about a year and a half older than me.\nWe get to our hometown, Topol\u2019\u20acany, his \u2014 her father had a small farm on the\noutskirts of our city and we two boys, escapees, going the back doors, back ways so\nwe will get picked up by this \u2014 by the gendarmes, by the police of our town. Came to\nthis house hoping that I would be able to hide there too. Well, the father of the girl,\nfather of Therese, the father said, I\u2019m taking Josef in my house and hide him, but I\u2019m\nnot taking a chance with two Jews in my house. And here I am, stuck out on the\noutskirt of our town, got picked up by police as I was walking back to town, beat the\nhell out of me, send me back to Novaky. In 1946 I went back to Slovakia wi \u2014 through\nthe army because I went to get my papers and those two are still married, of course,\nthey had a child. And she cried. She apologized to me that her father wouldn\u2019t take\nme. Her father died since, but he wouldn\u2019t take me. So \u2014 but as fate would have it, I\nsurvived, she says, so at least I came to see them. Josef Knap(ph) died, let\u2019s see, 1990\nI was in Israel and there was a Czechoslovakian gathering of Holocaust survivors, and\nthere was another Jew \u2014 Jewish person there who travels from \u2014 to my hometown and\nhe told me that he died a few months ago. So the Righteous Gentiles really weren\u2019t\nthat many. As far as the guy said he wouldn\u2019t do it, I believe it, because most people\ndidn\u2019t want to do it. My father had enough Christian friends and people that he dealt\nwith, people that he sold horses and cattle to, that somebody could have saved us.\nNobody was willing.",
        "Q: You earlier were talking about, when I was asking about anger, you were saying\nthat 1-1 \u2014 I\u2019m paraphrasing, that most of your anger is directed at the fact that you made\nit and your \u2014 your siblings and your parents didn\u2019t. I \u2014 I \u2014 that classic thing that is\ntalked about with survivors is guilt.",

I had\nnobody left, and they\u2019re still putting \u2014 put the guilt on me. So they \u2014 the people put\nguilt on us. You know, at first I was even afraid to speak about it. Here I am, survived\nthe camps and nobody else did \u2014 did it in my family, so why should I be guilty that I\nsurvived?",

And yet, to the last minute the\nguy didn\u2019t admit to anything. And he was the mastermind of the railroad tracks of the\nca \u2014 of the cattle cars. He was the guy who \u2014 who \u2014 who had another guy, Dieter\nWisliceny who was \u2014 who he \u2014 he sent to Slovakia to \u2014 to get us out of there, who he\nsent to Greece to get the Greek Jews. And \u2014 and \u2014 and this man to the last moment did\nnot admit \u2014 only thing he said, I followed orders. And as far as Eichmann\u2019s capture, it\nwasn\u2019t done because of Simon Wiesenthal, it was done because of the Israeli\nMossad. And Simon Wiesenthal want \u2014 took it \u2014 the credit for that, but it is no longer\nthe credit for \u2014 he doesn\u2019t take it any more, I\u2019m sure of it. Excuse me.",

This 1s my telephone number, this is my house address, which by the\nway, becomes my home \u2014 home address now, because when I bought this house \u2014\nwhen I \u2014 when we were moving here 30 years ago, looking for a home and the real\nestate lady takes me in this neighborhood and I see a address, 6531. My number is\n65316. I said, we\u2019re going to buy this house. My wife says, you gotta be crazy. I says\nwhy? I never \u2014 I \u2014I can never lose my \u2014 if I lose my way I know I got it on my arm,\nyou know, I said \u2014 no, she says, don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t \u2014 let\u2019s not buy this house. I \u2014 so we\nbought it anyway, you know. So that\u2019s a sick sense of humor in me, you know. I\nbought the house only \u2014 not only because it was a good price, but it also had a right\nnumber. So coworkers, yeah, they always ask. Not co \u2014 s-strangers on the street, in a\nrestaurant, when it\u2019s summertime you go there in a short sleeve shirt. They look at you\nfirst and they don\u2019t want to say anything, they\u2019re kind of you know. And what am I\ngonna do, cover it like this? No. So \u2014 you were in one of them camps, huh? Ye \u2014 wa \u2014\nwa \u2014 one of them bad Nazi camps, huh? And I, oh yeah, I says. Could you tell me a\nlittle bit about it? I says no, not in a restaurant, you know. You got children in school, I\nsaid, we have a film over there. Or wa \u2014 you \u2014 ever go here, you can find out. You go\nto the children\u2019s museum, they have s-stuff on the Holocaust, you know. So th-that \u2014\nthat always comes up, always, there isn\u2019t \u2014 I tho \u2014 there isn\u2019t a day when somebody\ndoesn\u2019t stare at you when you have the number exposed. I'll tell you another story. In\n1961 we lived in Cleveland, Ohio. I was working for a company called Shoppers\nFair. I was straightening out a couple of shelves in the store with my sleeves \u2014 short\nsleeve shirt on. A guy walks in, he says, you got number. I know man got number.\nTalks with an accent. I said oh yeah, you do? Okay. I bring him here. Next day he\ndrags in a gu \u2014 brings in a guy, we were together in Auschwitz. This guy\u2019s name was\nMutti(ph) Klein(ph). He worked with my father with the horses at Auschwitz. We\nbecame f\u2014 of course, close friends until we moved to Cleveland, he \u2014 they \u2014 a-and \u2014\nand he eva \u2014 a-a-after awhile he got a heart attack. Then he retired in Florida. In 1990\nwe went to Israel ag-again for the gathering, and he didn't make it because he was ill.\nAnd there I met some people that know him also because they came the same time as\nwe did to Auschwitz. We got home to Indianapolis, we found out a few months later\nhe died. So that was also through his number because the guy seen me at work,\nstocking shelves at Shoppers Fair. So the number 1s always there and always comes\nup in the conversation wherever I go. And when I went to Germany to test \u2014 testify, I\nmade it a point when we were free from court, and we went for train rides and went \u2014\nanywhere we went, I would always [indecipherable] summertime, of course we were\nthere summertime, I would sit there \u2014 and always would like to sit close to an older\nGerman, just to let him see the number. And they would look at you, then they put the\nhead down and never look at you again. Probably couldn't get a \u2014 couldn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t\nwait to get off the next stop. Yeah, the number is there unfortunately and it\u2019ll stay\nthere as long as I live.",
        "Q: You talk \u2014 you\u2019ve talked quite a bit about this gathering in 1981. What was that\nlike?",
        "A: This was the most \u2014 fir \u2014 first of all it was the first gathering ever, okay? This was\nthe most emotional four or five days we had in Israel. We had a survivor village in \u2014\nin Jerusalem. There were computers set up all over the creation \u2014 all over the place\nand every one of us was listed in the computer, who we were, where we came from.\nAnd this is how I met in person, Eric Kulka. I didn\u2019t know \u2014 first of all, I didn\u2019t know\nEric Kulka. I didn\u2019t know who Eric Kulka was. I get a message at the Hilton\nJerusalem, note Eric Kulka, telephone number. Call up Eric Kulka and he tells me\nwho he 1s. Eric Kulka\u2019s wife was murdered by the Nazis, so what he did, he took his\nwife\u2019s maiden name and changed his name.",
        "Q: In tribute?",
        "A: In \u2014 yeah, 1n \u2014 in tribute for his wife, yeah. He\u2019s got a son who teaches at the\nUniversity of Jerusalem, also a historian and a writer of books. So Eric died, I was\ntold the other day, last week, year and a half ago. Kidney failure. But he was much\nolder than me, Eric was in his late 80\u2019s. I also saved his life, yeah. But Eric was quite\na guy.",

        "A: A number of times, yes.",
        "Q: What was that like the first time you went there?",
        "A: Well, the first time I went there was for the opening when \u2014 when the \u2014 when it was\nthe g \u2014 the grand opening of the Holocaust Museum. That was in April 1993. The\ncoldest, rainiest day you can imagine, it was so cold. And we \u2014 we said, it fits the\noccasion, the oc \u2014 the opening fits the occasion. Three of our kids came with us, two\ndaughters and a son and my wife and I. And I was written up in the U.S. \u2014 the U.S.A.\ntoday in the \u2014 because of the opening. And this was too, very, very emotional. The \u2014\nthe \u2014 the \u2014 the demonstrators, they \u2014 the park police, of course, took care of them after\nawhile. They had demonstrators up to a point and after that they took care of them.\nThe-They blocked them off with buses, they could \u2014 you couldn\u2019t see them any more.\nAnd of course, it was so emotional. But the \u201981 in Israel, that is where I met Kulka\nand met some other people, a couple guys from France who worked with me in the\nKanada commando. And then \u2014 that was the hardest part. That was the \u2014 that was the\nhardest part for me. When at Yad Vashem we heard a first speech by a \u2014 the le \u2014 one\nof the leaders of the group, and man there wasn\u2019t a dry eye in the place. This is when I\nreally cried, when they start talking, my number is such and such. And then you\nwalked through the Yad Vashem Museum where all the photographs of \u2014 original\nphotographs of Nazis that t \u2014 took \u2014 the documentation, Nazi documentation took. As I\nwalked through, I\u2019ve seen the railroad tracks where I worked. And I\u2019ve seen the\nprisoners whom I knew and I point \u2014 could point out who they were. And that broke\nme down. And NPR was there, she interviewed me, a lady interviewed me, I couldn\u2019t\nfinish the interview, that\u2019s how bad I was. That was very, very emotional. And we\nwent \u2014 since then, of course, we went to a few more gathering \u2014 Holocaust gathering. I\nhad the great honor, because of the Holocaust Museum and the Holocaust\norganization, May eighth, this past May eighth, be invited to Washington, D.C. at the\ncapital rotunda to do the Holocaust Memorial Kaddish. So I did May eighth in\nWashington, which was also very beautiful.",
        "Q: So le-let me ask you a question about your faith. You \u2014 we\u2019ve talked about your\nproblems with God. I \u2014 I gather from talking to you and to your wife that you were\nless than enthusiastic about raising your children in an observant home.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And \u2014 and yet, you say the Kaddish.",
        "A: What is it?",
        "Q: And \u2014 and yet, th \u2014 you said the Kaddish \u2014",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: \u2014 and that \u2014",
        "A: [indecipherable]",
        "Q: \u2014 is meaningful to you.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Are you \u2014 how can I phrase the question? Have you become any more comfortable\nor interested, or \u2014",
        "A: The last few years, last few years I \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014I go to the temples Friday nights. I\u2019m\nstill a little thinking about it, just what am I doing here, but yet I feel I must do it now,\nespecially now. I\u2019m getting older and it\u2019s time to identify myself more, not just by\nname, but also by attending the services, hoping to heal a little different.",
        "Q: Is it helping?",
        "A: Yes, I think it\u2019s helping. I think it\u2019s helping because the community knows me so\nwell now and they identify me with this. The Jewish community relations which I am a\nchairman of the Holocaust Committee here in t \u2014 1n our organization, and anytime\nsomething happens, they call on me. At the state capital rotunda here, I was asked to\nspeak, als \u2014 May sixth, two days before Washington. They wanted to also make it\nMay eighth, I said, I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t attend it, you have to get someone else. No, we\ndon\u2019t want someone else, we want you. So we make it on May sixth. So they made it\non May sixth and there too I spoke, and I was asked by the community to do the holoc\n\u2014 to do the Kaddish for the ser-service. So the community is kind of pushing me\ntowards this sort of a making me part of \u2014 the Holocaust Jew to be the spokesperson.\nAny time they need someone, newspapers here, local papers, the television channels \u2014\nthere isn\u2019t a television program on Holocaust that I\u2019m not involved in that they don\u2019t\ncall me. When Shpindler \u2014 \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u2019 was shown, I was asked to be on the\nprogram. Yom HaShoah comes around, the Day of Remembrance, I am asked to be\non programs. So I\u2019m \u2014 now I feel I\u2019m coming back to my roots.",
        "Q: Do you ever wish that you were not born Jewish?",
        "A: No. No, no, never. I am proud of my heritage, but I \u2014 the only problem I had was\nGod and I think I\u2019m healing a little bit.",
        "Q: One of the things that they wanted me to talk to you about is y-your observations of\nwhat has been going on in the world surrounding you since you\u2019ve been back \u2014",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: \u2014 from Europe, since you\u2019ve been in this country. Through the lens of one who has\nhad the experiences that you have had in the Holocaust, and I\u2019m wondering \u2014 I\u2019Il ask\nyou about a few things \u2014",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: \u2014 you \u2014 I think you overheard me talking to your wife about this yesterday.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Well, in a general way let me ask you what \u2014 what fears do you continue to have\nhere? I don\u2019t mean fear of water, fear of dentists, but fears for this country, fears for \u2014\nworries about hate groups \u2014",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: \u2014 political fringes, religious groups \u2014",
        "A: Well, the hate groups is one of them. You see, the First Amendment in this country\nis a beautiful item, but the First Amendment should stop somewhere. It should stop\nwith these hate groups, it should stop with the \u2014 with the KKK, they shouldn\u2019t have\ntheir rights with the First Amendment, I\u2019m sorry. Neither should have the skinheads\nand the white supremists shouldn\u2019t have that, the racists shouldn\u2019t have that, the anti-\nSemites shouldn\u2019t have that, they shouldn\u2019t have the First Amend \u2014 that should \u2014 that\nhas nothing to do with the First Amendment. You may na \u2014 disagree with me, but\nthese are \u2014 there\u2019s just got to be stop somewhere. Well, here is a guy who has got First\nAmendment rights, he killed 160 people in \u2014 in Oklahoma. This is the First\nAmendment. He shouldn\u2019t be even tried. He should be given to the people in\nOklahoma City and they should take care of it. That\u2019s \u2014 may sound cruel, but look\nhow cruel he was. So these are the fears I have, that because of our freedom in our ri \u2014\nlives, we let all these groups do whatever they want to do and they murder, then we\nput them to death row and they stay there for 15 years and 16 times they say \u2014 th-the\ngovernor says a\u2014a stay of execution and they stay, he goes back there and you feed\nhim and you spend money on him. These \u2014 these are fears I have. I have fears of these\nhate groups. I have fears of all these \u2014 all these anti-Semites, all these racists. You\nknow, this is what \u2014 this is what scares me, this \u2014 this is \u2014 and now wa \u2014 why does it\nscare me so much? Because all you got to have, all you need, God forbid, is bad\neconomy. These are the people that will lead the other middle America, and middle\nAmerica is a na \u2014 dangerous world, believe me. I\u2019ve seen them, I-I\u2019ve seen them in\naction, you know, doing my \u2014 sometime my \u2014 some my speeches, I \u2014 sometime I get\nthese middle Americans in there too. But these are the ones you\u2019ve got to be careful\nwith. The fundamentalists, the middle America. The ones who push the j1 \u2014 push their\nreligions onto you. These are the ones that you worry about. The white \u2014 white\nsupremists, who are they? They come from the churches. What \u2014 lot of them. Th-\nThey \u2014 they all God loving, Christ fearing white Anglo-Saxon Americans. And these\nare the ones that can lead the mili \u2014 militia that can lead this country into ruin.",
        "Q: When you say middle America, what are you referring to? That\u2019s a kind of a vague",
        "A: I\u2019m referring to the \u2014 the white supremist, that they call themselves the middle s --\npure Americans. If you black you have no business to live in their neighborhood. If\nyou Jew, you \u2014 your \u2014 you\u2019re a bloodsucker. If you\u2019re an Asian, if you\u2019re any \u2014 any \u2014\nany of these Asian countries, they hate you. Look what\u2019s happened in \u2014 happened in\nNew York, all these p \u2014 all these poor Koreans or \u2014 or \u2014 or Asians are working their \u2014\nevery member in the family is working in their little grocery store trying to eke out a\nliving, working, 24 hours a day open and they try to make a living and yet these \u2014\nthese \u2014 these animals, the whites beat the hell out of them. And \u2014 and their some \u2014 so\ndo some \u2014 some blacks do the same thing to them, it was a ca \u2014 1t\u2019s happened there\nwas the blacks that came after them.",
        "Q: Have you been any more concerned in the recent past than in the decades previous?",
        "A: Yes, because it\u2019s \u2014 now we have the news media that keeps bringing it \u2014 bringing\nthe \u2014 all these atrocities up, brings \u2014 bringing the news up, which we didn\u2019t have in the\npast like we have it today. I wish we had the news media during my time in\nAuschwitz, before Auschwitz, probably wouldn\u2019t have been \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 I don\u2019t know, if\nyou had CNN then, who knows what would happen. But the \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t as bad in\nyears back. Years back, yes, there was anti-Semitism, racism and all [indecipherable]\nI\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m afraid always will be anti-Semitism and racism as far as \u2014 as long as we\nhave this kind of a population as we have here, the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 and middle America\nthat loves the pure white people. So \u2014 but that scares me, it scares me that if ano \u2014 be\nanother Holocaust, that can be a lot of troubles, that can create a lot of problems.",
        "Q: What should we do to ward that off?",
        "A: Indifference and education. Indifference, teaching people what indifference means,\nstands for. Indifference, don\u2019t look at me that I\u2019m dark eyed and brow-brown hair and\ndark skin, look at me as a person, that I\u2019m your neighbor, that I\u2019m your citizen, I\u2019m the\nsame citizen as you are, and don\u2019t put the hate on me because of what I am, what I was\nborn. That\u2019s the indifference. Education, teach these people what can happen when\nhate and racism and anti-Semitism flourishes. What can happen when poor economy\ncan bring these people to do what Hitler did to the Jews and other minorities.",
        "Q: That was something I wanted to ask you about. Obviously other people died in the\nHolocaust, other than Jews.",
        "A: Mm-hm, yes.",
        "Q: The Gypsies.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Homosexuals.",
        "A: Jehovah Witnesses. Jehovah Witnesses.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Have you had much contact with je \u2014 with Gentile survivors?",
        "A: I haven\u2019t met too many. I met some, but not too many. Very few Gentile survivors\ncome forward, very, very few. I had contact with liberators, but not survivors. And I\nwish I had contact with some survivors. There were Poles, there were \u2014 there were\npolitical prisoners. Of course, the criminal prisoners, you know.",
        "Q: Priests.",
        "A: Priests, Academians. Very, very seldom, I na \u2014 don\u2019t think I met maybe one or two\nin my lifetime here. And I don\u2019t even remember where.",
        "Q: Just wondering.",
        "A: I wish I would, because there are some around, believe me, there are some people\naround.",
        "Q: I know that I read a book recently about the Gypsies and the proportion of \u2014 of the\nGypsies that were killed \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 gi-given the size of the \u2014",
        "A: Well, the \u2014 a-and they had a Gypsy camp in Birkenau, just \u2014 Gypsy family camp,\nand in \u2014 1n less than two nights, two nights [indecipherable] boom, boom, boom, one,\ntwo, three, they murdered close to 30,000 Gypsies, and some of them had German\narmy uniforms on, some of the men. Came from the Wehrmacht, they picked them up\nand brought them to Auschwitz. German Gypsies.",
        "Q: What about outside of this country? We talked about the militia movement and the\nclan and what about things that you\u2019ve observed outside of this country, Yugoslavia?",
        "A: You mean the Bosnia, th-th-th-that \u2014 that problem there? It\u2019s a horrible item,\nhorrible thing. Elie Wiesel went to Bosnia some years back and begged the people,\ndon\u2019t do this to your people. Look what happened to us. He went to see th \u2014 some of\nthe prisoners who he could see them through the \u2014 through the elect \u2014 through the\nfences and seen people with this \u2014 like s \u2014 looking like skeletons. But you know,\nthere\u2019s a difference between Holocaust and \u2014 and Bosnia [indecipherable]\nYugoslavia. The difference is all [indecipherable] had guns. They had weapons. They\nwere fighting each other with weapons. Ethnic \u2014 a fa \u2014 wh-what were they fighting\nfor? Religious \u2014 religion ethnicity, for ethnics. And with us, we didn\u2019t have guns or\nammunition [indecipherable] it was different. But at the same time, it was a\nholocaust. Look what they\u2019ve done to a beautiful country, the Yugoslavia. Years\nbefore the winter sports were held in that beautiful part of the world, and now the\nwhole country is ruined. Other than a \u2014 other than Croatia which 1s still in a fairly\ndecent shape. So that was a holocaust. Cambodia, the boat people. Vietnam war was\nanother one. You know, when Vietnam war first started, when it \u2014 when it was first\nstarted in the 60\u2019s, late 60\u2019s, I was for it. I was for the Americans. After all, here is the\nUnited States of America, you \u2014 you know, you go fight, don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t knock the\nsoldiers that are going there. And after awhile, when I listened to my children who\nwere at the time college age, you know, and they were going demonstrating in\nWashington against it, I tried to listen and reason with them. But kids, they\u2019re fighting\nfor freedom. So the kids would tell me, what\u2019s freedom? It\u2019s 10,000 miles \u2014 20 thou \u2014\n10,000 miles away from us, what kind of freedom? They\u2019re killing innocent children\nand women, is that a freedom? So when I first started I was very much for it, then I\nhad to go with my kids. I\u2019ve seen that what they were talking about, they were right.\nMaybe they were too radical about it. Maybe they went overboard, maybe. And some\nof them did. I mean, in spite of the drugs, they brought some \u2014 some good things out\nof it, these young people.",
        "Q: What about \u2014 I was thinking \u2014 I \u2014 I mean, I\u2019m not trying to make parallels to what\nhappened to you, but I\u2019m just wondering about things that have happened in history\nthat might have particularly concerned you or chilled you or \u2014 or the \u2014 what \u2014 and I\nwas thinking about what happened in Rwanda in the past couple of years, where one\nside basically annihilated the other side.",
        "A: Yeah, mm-hmm. The tutsu \u2014 tutu \u2014 tutues and \u2014 and Tutsi then.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Well, that is a holocaust, a horrible, horrible, horrible crime. No one even there\nhelped, re-really. What did they do? Th-They fly \u2014 a plane flew over and \u2014 and\ndropped some food and people were killing each other for the piece of food that they\ncould find. In \u2014 in \u2014 look, Bosnia and Yugoslavia, no one helped five, six years ago\nwhen they should have helped. That\u2019s when they should have stopped right there. This\nis when the help should have come, not today with the sending \u2014 Clinton sends the\narmy over there now\u201d? Now you send the army over there? Send the army there before\nthe first shot was fired. Control it and try to do the Dayton before Dayton. You know\nwhat I\u2019m trying to say? Don\u2019t go to Dayton after every \u2014 after nine million people are\nmurdered. Go there before. Make the Dayton in \u2014 in Yugoslavia, in Croatia, in\nBosnia. This is where you do it. Nobody paid attention. The next door neighbors,\nGermany, the Hitler y \u2014 nobody did anything. When I was there testifying in\nGermany in \u201991, it was still early enough to go there and try to stop all that. They\nwere just trying to start \u2014 starting to shoot. That\u2019s the time to go there, but oh well, we\ncan\u2019t send our sons to be murdered over there. Nobody asked them to be murdered\nover there, nobody is murdered there now. One [indecipherable] the guy got lost in\nthe wooded area someplace, shot down or whatever happened to him and he survived.\nAnd all you had to do was go there, send their armed forces over there and control\nthem, send the UN over there before it happened, not after it happened. So these are\nthe things that should be done. Rwanda the same way. Look \u2014 did you see all these\nstarving little innocent children? Who did they hurt? Same thing like the one and a half\nmillion Jewish children murdered by the Nazis. Poor, innocent children. How many\nprofessors, how many scientists, how many teachers, how many doctors were\nmurdered among these little one and a half million children? The same thing with the\nRwanda people. Maybe they weren\u2019t professors 1n ta \u2014 1-1-1n \u2014 1-1-1n \u2014 but they were\nhuman beings and nobody helped. Everyone turned their head the other way. We were\nwatching the news programs a \u2014 while we eating dinner and they would say to e \u2014 to\nwife \u2014 wife to a husband, look at this, isn\u2019t that terrible what happening over there?\nOh, what\u2019s on tonight. You know, that was the end of the conversation. What else is\non television?",
        "Q: So now we do have CNN, now we do know, we \u2014 we can\u2019t feign ignorance.",
        "A: And we didn\u2019t do anything. And we didn\u2019t do anything. We watching for CNN to\nbring us atrocities. Everybody is looking for something terrible to happen. Middle\nEast, the fights, the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the fights between Palestinians and throwing stones,\nthey\u2019re throwing rocks, they\u2019re doing \u2014 they \u2014 they\u2019re burning tires, the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014\nthat \u2014 this is what CNN is for, this all the newscast is for, but no one does anything.",
        "Q: What would you suggest people do?",
        "A: The big countries, the powers should be the ones. You know, I know it sounds \u2014\nsounds like easy task to do, but we should be the ones to be the guards of the world.\nAnd not with guns and ammunition, but sending people to try to solve their problems\ntalking. Get into the table with these people. Get to the \u2014 to get to the com \u2014 get to the\nconferences with these people. There are some people it\u2019s hard to talk with.",
        "Q: You know, I\u2019m just thinking \u2014 oh, first of all, I want to check my tape.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Michael Vogel. This is tape number three, side B and we were talking about\nways of intervening to prevent future \u2014",
        "A: Holocausts.",
        "Q: \u2014 holocausts. And I was thinking, you know, of the \u2014 the real notorious leaders,\npolitical figures, Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, Idi Amin, the \u2014 the Serbian leader,\nMilosevic. How do you \u2014 these people don\u2019t seem very reasonable, from everything\nI\u2019ve been told.",
        "A: Mm-hm, yeah they aren\u2019t. They\u2019re not reasonable. But these are the people that the\ngovernments, like United States, Soviet u \u2014 or ru \u2014 former Soviet Union, anyone who\nhas power should go to these people and say, enough killing. Let\u2019s sit down and talk\nabout the tuti \u2014 Tutus and let\u2019s talk about the Bosnians, let\u2019s talk about the\nCambodians here, the Pol Pots, the \u2014 the killings, it\u2019s got to stop. And someone has\ngot to do it. Now, I know it\u2019s not easy and I know you \u2014 somebody\u2019s going to tell me\nthat I\u2019m full of bull talking like this, because who is going to mix in in someone else\u2019s\nkitchen? Well, s-someone has to mix in in someone else\u2019s kitchen, because we can\u2019t\ngo on like this. One thing stops, something else starts. There is never a dull moment as\nfar as somebody killing somebody. One country. These [indecipherable] Rwandan\npeople, these \u2014 these little innocent children should be saved. Who\u2019s going to save\nthem? Not the Tutsis and not whatever you want to call them Tutus or Tutsis, it\u2019s\ngotta be done by a powerful country and it\u2019s got to stop. And if somebody said well,\nwe have enough problem in this country, we have racism and anti-Semitism here, sure\nwe do, but in the meanwhile we\u2019re not starving, and those people are starving. And\nthose people have to be put together, those people had to have help with the \u2014 from our\ntechnology from farming and for everything. Everyone \u2014 if you help people to \u2014 to\nfeed them, you\u2019re gonna start \u2014 you\u2019re gonna pa \u2014 st-stop a lot of these atrocities.\nEducation.",
        "Q: Do you \u2014 do you feel reasonably safe here now?",
        "A: In this country, yes. Very much so. I \u2014 I feel safe because this is the best country in\nth \u2014 in spite of all our problems, in spite of all isms that we have here, this is still the\nbest country in the world, and I\u2019ve been around a few countries. I\u2019ve been around\nEurope, I\u2019ve been around the Middle East. This country is the country that I love, and\nlike I tell my children, you can sing America [indecipherable] three times a day,\ncause there\u2019s no other country like it.",
        "Q: Why? Why is it so great in your mind?",
        "A: Because of the freedom, because of the freedom of speech, that you can say what\nyou \u2014 what you mean and no one\u2019s going to arrest you for it, no one\u2019s going to shoot\nyou for it. You couldn\u2019t talk like this in s \u2014 in Russia even today, you couldn't talk like\nthis in some of the European countries, unless you go on the streets and start fighting\nlike they do in Ireland.",
        "Q: Tell me about becoming a citizen. What was that like for you?",
        "A: That will stay as one of the f \u2014 best thing ever happening to me. Of course, I could\nhave been a citizen much sooner if I would have stayed with the United States Armed\nForces. I could have become a citizen as soon as I left La Havre on the way to far east\nJapan to \u2014 to be a replacement soldier to occupy \u2014 the occupying forces. But since I\ndidn\u2019t, I had to wait and I got \u2014 I was taken \u2014 I was make a ci \u2014 made a citizen in\nDetroit, Michigan. And when I went to the federal court, after I took a test \u2014 you\nknow, they give you so much time to \u2014 to \u2014 to learn the test, who was the 16\"\npresident, who was this, who was that, and to become a citizen, with a number of\npeople with you, and you get the oath and they give you a flag in your hand, that was\nthe greatest thing ever \u2014 ever for me. And I\u2019ve tell you, I have never missed an\nelection. State, federal, presidential, none of them, never. That is my right and I kiss\nthe ground for that.",
        "Q: Have you gotten involved much with politics in this country?",
        "A: Not really, not really. The on \u2014 sometime when I speak about my experiences,\npolitics do come up and I very kindly turn it down because I am not knowledgeable in\npolitics. I read the papers, I have my opinions. My opinions are for me and my family.\nI will not s \u2014 force something on someone else. I will not tell you that I\u2019m a\nRepublican or a Democrat because I am a person for persons. And that\u2019s the way it 1s,\nI don\u2019t get involved. I do help once in awhile with some campaign people, they say\nwould you do this or would you do that. I don\u2019t do any fundraisers, but I help\nsometimes, organizations, you know, they ask me to. I don\u2019t belong to too many\norganizations. I belong to the men\u2019s clu \u2014 men\u2019s brother \u2014 brotherhood in our temple,\nand I\u2019m a member of the temple [indecipherable] the Jewish community relations.\nAnd I have the highest soccer referee license you can get, and those are the\norganizations that I\u2019m part of.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you about, and in the context of your st \u2014 putting the soccer into this\ncontext, what things have given you pleasure, have given you joy since you\u2019ve been\nback from Auschwitz? What are the things that you have, in the past 50 years gotten\nthe most \u2014",
        "A: Well, first and foremost, my children and my wife, that\u2019s the first thing. There\u2019s n-\nnot the greatest pleasure than to see childrens achieve, and I can say about my\nchildren, they\u2019re all achievers, every one of them. Second, of course, watching my\ngrandchildren being born. That is another pleasure, there\u2019s five of them and sixth one\ncoming. I am not much of a art museum person, but being that the childrens are very\nmuch involved in arts, I do go with them sometimes, in fact Sunday we went to the\nmuseum with my wife. And of course, the enjoyment that I have is teaching young\npeople the game of soccer. I happen to be one of the people, unfortunately the second\nperson that was part of it passed away at a very young age, at the age of 47, an\nEnglishman. The two of us started soccer in the state of Indiana, so to speak. So to\nspeak, no, we \u2014 we used to travel the state to give clinics to coaches and to kids. And\nwe would take our players, who were already more knowledgeable in soccer than the\nrest of the state of Indiana, and take the kids with us and we would let the kids do a\nlot of the soccer s \u2014 stuff for them, you know, to teach them how to handle a soccer\nball, how to \u2014 how to balance a soccer ball, how to juggle a soccer ball. And we als \u2014\nalso helped them to buy equipment, soccer equipment. We went into that business, the\ntwo of us, for awhile. So that\u2019s another pleasure that I have. This year I was selected \u2014\nelected to the soccer Hall of Fame, State of Indiana. I have number of trophies which\nI received from my job as a soccer person, as a soccer coach and a soccer referee,\nnumber of citation. Oh, there is a humanitarian award named after me also, I don\u2019t\nknow if I showed it to you or not, but there is one. It\u2019s hanging at one of th \u2014 the\nlargest school \u2014 the larger high school in the state of Indiana called North Central\nHigh School. This just called the Mike Vogel\u2019s Humanitarian award. Every year a\nperson is added to that award, which is hanging at the school. I have a copy of \u2014-a\u2014a\nsmall replica of the award here at home, and that was given to me three years ago for\nsoccer and other humanitarian things that I do.",
        "Q: What are the other things that you do that you\u2019ve gotten involved with in terms of f\n\u2014 philanthropic activities or \u2014 or \u2014",
        "A: Just lectu \u2014 mostly lecturing, speaking, and of course last May 24\", I was given the\nhonorary doctorate de-degree of public service at one of the f-fine university of state of\nIndiana called DePauw University, which was given to me at the graduation\ncommencement May 24\". That was a nice one. Last year I was selected in the state of\nIndiana for the Jefferson Award. The Jefferson Award was founded by Robert Taft,\nJr., Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and a guy named Sam Beard whose father was a\ncongressman at one time. The Jefferson Award is given to people who \u2014 ev-every\nstate \u2014 this is \u2014 this is nationwide \u2014",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: \u2014 who do volunteer work, like speaking and helping the children and teaching\nchildren and doing li \u2014 working with homeless and so on. Each state selects their own.\nThere was 127 people nominated from the state of Indiana, only 10 are selected for\nthe na \u2014 for the Jefferson Award, and then there is a luncheon at the hotel here in\ntown, and the 10 people that were the winners of the \u2014 from the 127 and their families\nand friends, they all come to the lunch, and you have a sponsor. I was sponsored by\n\u201cThe Indianapolis Star News.\u201d And this year \u2014 last year they gave, for the first time,\na 500 dollar money to be given to your charit \u2014 favorite charity. My money was given\nto the Holocaust Museum in Washington, my 500 dollars. And from the 10 people,\neach state selects one person to represent the state in Washington, D.C. So now you\nwon the national award. You come to the national award for three days and you stay in\nWashington at a beautiful hotel. You are allowed to bring one guest, in my case I\nbrought my wife. And then there are two gala dinners and lunches, and you meet the\nother people and everyone talks about what he did. You give \u2014 first evening you get\ntwo minutes to say how did you come to given \u2014 be given this en \u2014 honor. Then the\ngala dinner is held on Tuesday nights and this dot \u2014 this year was \u2014 last year was held\nat the women\u2019s museum 1n arts, and it\u2019s a beautiful, beautiful dinner, a dress up dinner\nwith all sorts of dignitaries there, and congressmen, senators. This dinner was funded\nby Heinz company, h \u2014 Heinz 57. And the guests are first asked to come down, e-each\ngiven a number of table where you are sitting and we were asked to sit at a front table.\nAnd when we got there and my wife \u2014 and the guests go down first. Then they\nannounce us one by one, alphabetically order and you shake hands with all these\ndignitaries. And when you come to your table \u2014 when I got to my table the president of\nthe Jefferson Awards, Sam Beard comes up to me and he says, after dinner I would\nlike to speak to you. Well, I didn\u2019t know what he wanted, so little nervous about it, but\nanyway, dinner was over, we come to the hotel and he\u2019s talking to me. He says,\ntomorrow morning we\u2019re going to the United States Supreme Court and I want you to\nbe the closing speaker. I\u2019ll give you three minutes to speak. I got a little nervous. I told\nmy wife, what am I gonna tell them? She says, why don\u2019t you jot something down? I\nsaid, you know how I am with writing. What am I gonna \u2014 you know, I don\u2019t want to\ntell them about the Holocaust too much. So I started writing but I threw it away. Next\nmorning we go to the United States Supreme Court. Sandra Day O\u2019Connor opened\nour session. And Sam Beard was going to introduce me to speak. I was fol \u2014 I\nfollowed Sam Nunn, the guy who was \u2014 was \u2014 founded C-Span and Julian Bond,\nyou know who he 1s? Okay, and Rosalynn Carter. And I followed Rosalynn Carter\n\u2014 Rosalynn Carter, the pr \u2014 former President Carter\u2019s wife. So I gave them a three\nminute speech. That was the greatest honor I could \u2014 anybody could bestow on me,\nspeaking at the United States Supreme Court.",
        "Q: It\u2019s a long way from \u2014 from the K rations at the \u2014",
        "A: Well, it was long way from Slovakia. And I told them, 50 years ago I arrived to\nthis beautiful free country called United States of America from the ashes of\nAuschwitz to life. My parents, my grandparents, my two brothers, my two sisters all\nperished, all de \u2014 murdered, gassed and burned in the largest death factory of all Nazi\nconcentration camp. Yet today, I have a mission. My mission is to speak for the six\nmillion who cannot speak for themselves. Today I speak at colleges, universities, high\nschools, civic and religious organization. Not everyone 1s an anti-Semite in the world.\nNot everyone is a Kurt Waldheim, Marge Schott. Yet, look at me, Mike Miso\nVogel, Jewish boy born in a small village of Slovakia, speaking to you in this great\nplace called United States Supreme Court of America. I thank you for this honor.\nThat was my speech. I \u2014I missed a couple lines, but that was my speech. And I tell\nyou, my wife tells me that everybody cried. So, that was the honor. I had a beautiful\nspeech also at DePauw University. I mise \u2014 I got it here to show you, but \u2014",
        "Q: I\u2014I know we\u2019 ve been doing this for awhile, I \u2014 I \u2014 trying to focus on the \u2014 the few\nlast questions that \u2014 that I want to make sure to \u2014 to fit in here. Many of the things I\nwanted to ask you you\u2019ve alre \u2014 we\u2019ve already talked about just in the natural flow of\nour conversation. I\u2019m just looking through the list here. Talked about that. There \u2014\nthere\u2019s some \u2014 some questions that they\u2019re asking everyone just to \u2014 to sort of see what\nthe similar experiences of other survivors have been, so this is a very general question\nand I mean you \u2014 you\u2019ve touched on this in many ways, but can you talk about the\nlong term impact that your experiences during the Holocaust have had on you? That\u2019s\na \u2014 that\u2019s a tough \u2014 I think it\u2019s a pretty enormous question. It\u2019s \u2014 it \u2014 for example, we\ntalked about in your family and raising your children. How about in terms of trust,\nyour ability to trust people?",
        "A: Well, it \u2014 that took awhile also. That took \u2014 took quite awhile before I \u2014 before I\nbelieved or trusted, cause you know, that was not an easy part for me to do. How could\nyou trust after you went through what we went through? How could you have faith in\nso-someone, you know, in someone\u2019s word, but you didn\u2019t, you know \u2014 here in this\ncountry, th-the BS system gets \u2014 gets \u2014 gets in the way, you know, and people tell \u2014\ntells \u2014 tell tales. Yet, I had a hard \u2014 I had a hard time with trusting. I trusted my wife\nand children, but I was afraid to trust someone else. So that took a long time. Today I\ncan tell by a person\u2019s handshake. When the guy looks in your eyes when he shakes\nyour hand and he shakes it like he means it, not like a dead fish, you can almost say\nthat here is a guy who 1s halfway decent and honest. So I had a hard time with trusting.\nFaith and trust was a hard thing for me, hard thing.",
        "Q: What about just being with Gentiles?",
        "A: No problem, none whatsoever. None whatsoever. I-I have a tremendous sense of\nhumor, I tell jokes about ra \u2014 not racial, I\u2019m talking about ethnic jokes, to me that\u2019s \u2014 I\ntell them all the time. But I have no problem with Gentiles.",
        "Q: But I meant when you first \u2014 whe-when you first came over, were you \u2014",
        "A: Oh, when I first came over? Well, I first came over to Detroit, we lived in a Jewish\nneighborhood. So only Gentiles I met was in the business world, wa \u2014 you know, in\nthe store that I worked in. So I didn\u2019t have too much outside of my business life to do\nwith the Gentiles. But now, today, I have no problem with them. I \u2014 I work with them,\nI \u2014I play soccer with them, against them, and they all respect me, I respect them. I\nhave no problem whatsoever.",
        "Q: I was just wondering if that took awhile \u2014",
        "A: No, no \u2014",

And people tell me I\u2019m crazy, that I should do it, I should see what\nit\u2019s going on. A friend of mine who just gave me the book I told you about, he just\ncame from there. It was just before \u2014 when we got to Israel he \u2014 day before we got\nthere he got home from there. And it used to be a 14,000 dollar \u2014 14,000 population is\nnow 40,000. And he said there are no Jews there, of course, and th-there are no Jews\nleft in Slovakia, I mean sla \u2014 any Jew who would live there would be crazy. But I have\nno desire to go there, no. I went to Prague, but not \u2014 not to Slovakia. I went to the\nCzech Republic which was then still Czechoslovakia, but I have no desire. I don\u2019t\nwant to see a Slovak.

        "Q: A few more historical things that \u2014 we talked about Vietnam, we talked about\nEichmann\u2019s trial, we talked about \u2014 what about the McCarthy era?",
        "A: Well, let me tell you. Then I was such a strong American believer, so strong anti-\ncommunist, cause I knew what that was, communism, that I almost went along with\nthat \u2014 that program and \u2014 and \u2014 almost. But then, of course, when I heard the way Joe\nMcCarthy was handling the \u2014 it was on \u2014 televised in those days, you know, and I just\ncouldn\u2019t \u2014 this guy was a hate monger. And I considered him worse than the Nazis\nafter I\u2019ve se \u2014 after I seen him for awhile. At first I said, he\u2019s fighting communists, it\u2019s\ngood. Hoover is fighting communists too, that\u2019s good. But neither one of these guys\nwere good a \u2014 good Americans, so to speak, because they were hate mongers. Hoover,\nwhat did he do? He went after the wrong people all the time, you know. Martin\nLuther King. What did he want from Martin Luther King? Here was a man who\nwas a peaceful demonstrator. He pi \u2014 th \u2014 he th \u2014 he never wanted to throw a rock on\nanybody, he didn\u2019t do any of that, he was very peaceful. He put him to jail, he put him\nto jail, and he was nicely quiet, with his good voice, telling the world what it\u2019s all\nabout. McCarthy was just as bad as the Nazis. He went after people whom he\nconsider \u2014 whom he \u2014 whom he accused of being a communist. He took so many lives\naway from people \u2014 so many livelihoods away from people in \u2014 in \u2014 in those years. He\nwas the \u2014 one of the worst thing \u2014 he was an animal.",
        "Q: Did it frighten you at all? I understand that you were supportive of the \u2014 the \u2014 the\nlarger aims and the \u2014 were a good anti-communist, but w-were you frightened at all to\nsee \u2014 I mean, there were some similarities it \u2014 1t seems, 1n retrospect with the\ntechniques used to accuse people and \u2014 and you know, neighbors against neighbors\nand \u2014",
        "A: Right, right.",

        "A: Mm-hm, yup, yup. I\u2019d w \u2014 it frightened me, because it was similar like what\nhappened \u2014 here \u2014 here 1s a Jew living, here is a \u2014 you know, they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re telling\non people, or how to catch people, telling on your neighbors to save your own skin.",

She went once to a \u2014\na communist meeting with her \u2014 one of her friends and they accused her of being a\nmember. This was during the McCarthy era.

        "A: Mm-hm. See, when I came to this country, there was still lynching in the south,\nokay? In the 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s it was \u2014 late 40\u2019s, it was still \u2014 you could still \u2014 there was\nsome lynching in the south, and we couldn\u2019t understand it. When we \u2014 when we move\n\u2014 when I first met my wife in Detroit, went to look for an apartment in the apartment\nbuilding, there was a sign, no Jews, no dogs, no niggers. Now this is coming from\nAuschwitz to si \u2014 to this, right? Now, let\u2019s go to the Civil Right movements. I never\nmarched with them, okay, never went with them anywhere, but I was very much for\nthose people, very much so. The demonstration, the burning, the si \u2014 the big cities like\nDetroit was burning, Los Angeles was burning. I was against that, that part bothered\nme. What were they burning? They were burning their own neighborhoods. That was\nthe worst part, you see, that part was wrong on them. But wha \u2014 what e \u2014 what else\nwere they doing? They were looting. See, that was wrong \u2014 wrong, too. See, they went\nthe wrong way. They were afraid to go to the better neighborhoods, but they went to\ntheir own ne \u2014 they burned their own neighborhood, burned their own houses down,\nburned their own storekeepers down. So \u2014 but I tell you, racism and anti-Semitism\nunfortunately, unless the whole world will change, as \u2014 and it\u2019s gonna take awhile, the\nwhole United States will change, it will stay with us.",

What can happen when \u2014 when anti-Semitism and\nracism flourishes. That people are being murdered, people are being deprived of\nfreedom, people are being deprived of that. If this is the kind of world we want in the\nUnited States, this is not what we need. What we need is education. We need people \u2014\nbetter schools, we need to teach people about indifference, we need te \u2014 teach people\nabout all of us are equal and that\u2019s what we should do.

Another one is Pat Buchanan is \u2014 is the one\nthat I fear a lot. And I don\u2019t know why he always ends up getting the same job back on\nCNN on \u2014 on \u2014 in same program he gets on. He is another guy that I\u2019m deathly afraid\nof that if he ever gets any power, what he could do. He is a clear anti-Semite who\ndenies the Holocaust very much. Him and his sister. And one of the actors, Marlon\nBrando. Marlon Brando was on the lar \u2014 Larry King show last year, before I went\nto the Jefferson awards. And he said Hollywood is controlled by Jews, and if you\ndon\u2019t go through the Jews, you don\u2019t get anywhere in Hollywood. Now look at him,\nhe has made millions in Hollywood, and if Hollywood controlled the Jews, they\ncertainly helped him.",

And he\u2019s the one who protected and defended Demjanjuk\nthrough the government, OSI, Office of Special Investigation had the wrong man, as\nfar as being Demjanjuk, but did not have the wrong man as far as being a former Nazi\nguard.

He\nwas a ca-camp guard, a Nazi camp guard in Sobibor and two more other camps. They\nalso got the wrong information about him. He came to this country illegally, lying\nabout his past. He committed crime against humanity and he should be punished for it,\nbut he wasn\u2019t. Oh, he was punished, he was a year and a half in prison in Israel. Pat\nBuchanan was very much against the Holocaust. The people do not remember what\nhappened. The people identified him wrongly and he was never a Nazi. He was a poor\nUkrainian who came \u2014 emigrated to America, went to work in a Cleveland\nautomobile factory, where he made a damn good living and never revealed his past.\nDemjanjuk was a Nazi, and he\u2019s living in Cleveland, maybe not as comfortably as\nhe\u2019d like to today because of all that had happened to him, but he\u2019s still there, free man\nand his children think he\u2019s the greatest thing on two feet.",

You know, especially since the Swiss\nsituation happened, I was asked \u2014 in fact, I was written up in the paper about the Swiss\nca \u2014 Swiss monies, gold money. Well, it \u2014 1t \u2014 it got so that every day I was being\ncalled by someone in the \u2014 in the media, just about. And I must tell you this, that I\ncertainly didn\u2019t know about the Swiss money. Didn\u2019t know about the Swiss gold. I\nknew about the gold that was yanked out of the Jewish teeth. I knew about the money\nthat was confiscated from the Jews when they arrived to Auschwitz, but I certainly\ndidn\u2019t know that it went to Switzerland. There are gold bars in Switzerland with \u2014\nwith a swastika on it and \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in Switzerland, in Swiss banks. It came from\nAuschwitz and other camps, that it was yanked out of teeth that they were gassing.

But I\nhave the youngest grandchild and \u2014 I should say the 10 year old granddaughter who\ncame with us to Israel on this trip, and she was allowed to go to Yad Vashem. This\nkid stuck with me like glue while I was speaking and she would not leave me for a\nmoment, she was so tight next to me, holding onto me. And after that, she says,\nGrandpa, that was very sad. The museum and also your speech. So th \u2014 our\ngrandchildren know much, much more now than our kids ever knew. So the 10 year\nold asked me to promise her when she is 12 years old, she wants to hear the whole\nstory. She says, by 12, I\u2019m gonna be better equipped to listen to it.

        "Q: I have a dif \u2014 perhaps a difficult question. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard all these questions\nat one time or another. Have you ever pondered if by a twist of fate you were not born\nJewish, but you were born German, or you were a Gentile Slovak in your hometown \u2014",

        "Q: You earlier were talking about, when I was asking about anger, you were saying\nthat 1-1 \u2014 I\u2019m paraphrasing, that most of your anger is directed at the fact that you made\nit and your \u2014 your siblings and your parents didn\u2019t. I \u2014 I \u2014 that classic thing that is\ntalked about with survivors is guilt.",
        "Q: You know, why did I make it and other people didn\u2019t. Would you call that guilt?",
        "Q: How so?",
        "Q: So you were afraid that by talking about it people would \u2014 it would beg the\nquestion \u2014",

That\u2019s\na \u2014 that\u2019s a tough \u2014 I think it\u2019s a pretty enormous question. It\u2019s \u2014 it \u2014 for example, we\ntalked about in your family and raising your children.

But as we\nwere marching with these Wehrmacht guards, from the lans \u2014 last concentration camp,\nwhich was a subcamp of Dachau, Landsberg, we were supposedly marching towards\nthe Tyrolean mountains, and they knew the ne \u2014 end was near. Of course we \u2014 we had\n\u2014 we had to push a wagon behind us so if anybody fell, that was just throw \u2018em in the\nwagon, so nobody was \u2014 be left on the road. And this piece of pa \u2014 they wrote these\npieces of paper and they tried to give it to the persons on the end, on the edge as they\nwere marching. Here, would you mind \u2014 would you sign this for me, and tell them that\nI was good to you, that I helped you, that I gave you some food. Some people did sign.\nI\u2019ve seen some people sign. Wha-Wha-What \u2014 what could a poor \u2014 poor soul do? In\nthe \u2014 they never came to me personally, but I\u2019ve seen them being done. So this was the\ndeath march, so to speak a death march because lot of people were \u2014 were falling like\nflies. I was one of the fortunate ones, I was still strong enough because of \u2014 of the\nslave labor that I performed prior to that, of eating a little better. So, during this death\nmarch there was also a American Air Force air raid on a munition depot very close to a\ntown called Wiirzburg, Germany. And from there as the \u2014 th \u2014 as the Americans\nwere bombing, I ran and I successfully escaped. And soon after I was picked up by the\nUnited States Armed Forces.",
        "A: Unfortunately not. I \u2014 from day \u2014 from \u2014 ever since I\u2019ve been out of the \u2014 the death\ncamps, concentration camps \u2014 when I met my wife, I got married, I had \u2014 I had\nproblem with my teeth. You know, there \u2014 there is saying, your teeth are alright, but\nyour gums have to come out, and that was my case, and I was deathly afraid. Once \u2014 I\nonce ran away from a dentist in the army. I don\u2019t know if I ever s \u2014 mentioned that to \u2014\nto \u2014 to the Holocaust Museum. I was taken by another \u2014 another G.I. with \u2014 to \u2014 to go\nto the dentist because I had awful ba-bad teeth and pain. And I was sitting in the chair\nand I ran away from there. I\u2019m still scared of dentists, I\u2019m still deathly afraid of shots.\nPll tell you an \u2014 a little story about what happened to me a few years ago. As I\nmentioned to you before, I wa \u2014 I was involved in soccer, not only as a coach and a\nreferee, but as a player. I was playing a soccer game and I got hit by a man and he\nopened my f\u2014 my forehead. I ended up in a hospital. And a friend of mine, the one I\nshowed you on the picture in \u2014 in the wall there, took me to the hospital and then they\ncalled my wife to come to the hospital. They wanted to give me a tetanus shot. I would\nre \u2014 I refused it, I would \u2014 I fought it. My wife almost left me because of that, she was\nso upset with me. That tetanus shot was so important because I was hit, and also hit a\ndoor, and the hor \u2014 door had a little steel [indecipherable] I was \u2014 and doctors fear is\nstill there. When I go to examination, I am awfully fearful what they going to do to\nyou. Very much so, even today. I\u2019m afraid of when they look for po \u2014 prostrate, you\nknow, when they do th \u2014 do that little finger job on you. That scares me, that scares the\nhell out of me. When they take a little blood from the fingers, that scares me. So that\nfear is from Auschwitz, unfortunately, because I\u2019ve seen Mengele e-e-every day on th\n\u2014on-\u2014on the tracks. So the doctors always scare me, and they shouldn\u2019t, they really\nshouldn\u2019t, not today. And especially since I have a daughter who is a physician. But\nI\u2019m still afra \u2014 a-afraid of it. \u2019m very much so.",
        "A: N-No. See, there are two things that I am afraid of. Doctors and dentists is two, and\nI\u2019m also afraid of water. Water scares me for the simple reason because in Auschwitz,\nI was sent to a shtraf(ph) commander once. Shtraf(ph) commander meaning that they\ncaught me es \u2014 organizing food for Jewish girls [indecipherable] commando, and they\nsend you to a sin 0-0-operation, so they call it shtraf(ph). Sin \u2014 sin \u2014 sin commando,\nwhich meant that we were forced to cut seaweeds in water. We had a chain \u2014 chainsaw\nlike, but with the one guy on one end of it, the other one the other end, gonna pull it,\nwas like a sickle, which would cut it. And there would be a kapo(ph) \u2014 a\u2014a\n[indecipherable], a kapo(ph), a \u2014 a person who was in charge of us behind us with the\nSS man, and they would dunk our heads in the water and kept us there until we could\nnot breathe any more. So I \u2014 I\u2014 I went through that for a couple of weeks as a \u2014 a-a-as\na shtraf commander, as a sin [indecipherable]. So whenever \u2014 whenever we go to a\nbeach or something, I only go up to my knees. And not one of my children, of the four\nkids, were swimmers, because of me. And of course, now they are learning a little bit.\nSome of them are \u2014 a couple of them are still afraid. Arsani\u2019s(ph) a swimmer now, his\nti\u2014 his children are a swimmer. Our daughter the physician, she swims now, she was\nalways deathly afraid of water, because of the \u2014 because of me. So those are the things\nthat scare me, scare the hell out of me, doctors, dentists and water.",
        "A: Can you \u2014",
        "A: Oh, okay.",
        "A: Do you \u2014 you want to talk to me about 1t now?",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: All right, let\u2019s \u2014 the children, our children. Well, when I arrived to this country,\nMay 10\", 1946, I came from the army, so it was a little different for me than the most\nsurvivors that arrived here, because most survivors came on a diff \u2014in a\u20141-ina\u2014ina\ndifferent way. I was helped with the United States armed forces and also was very\nhelpful that I had an aunt living in Detroit. So when I first met my wife, my future\nwife, we started dating, we \u2014 also a survivor, you know. She didn't have much family,\nI didn\u2019t have any family, so you lonely, I\u2019m lonely, let\u2019s be lonely together, the old\nsaying what is the \u2014 one survivor said it at one time, if I may use his phrase. So when\nwe got married, February 22\", 1948, it will be 50 years coming up in the next \u2014 th-this\nFebruary, I asked my wife, why don\u2019t we \u2014 let\u2019s not talk any more any other language\nexcept English. My English was fairly decent except I had the ar-army language,\nwhich was not the cleanest language in those days, of course. That\u2019s how I learned.\nAnd we decided \u2014 she was a little bit against it. She said no, we should talk to the\nchildren other languages also. She was much smarter than me, believe me, because the\nkids today could have \u2014 although they speak some languages, but they could \u2014 today\nthey could have learned much more. So, how did it affect my children? First, we\nwouldn\u2019t talk about our experiences. Another mistake we made \u2014 I made, anyway, it\nwas \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m taking the blame for that. Reason we didn\u2019t want to, why hurt them?\nWhy let them know how much we suffered, how much we went through? But the kids\nknew they were different. Our children soon, as soon as they started school found out\nthey were different. Number one, they didn\u2019t have any first cousins. They didn\u2019t have\nany aunts and uncles. No grandparents. There was never a grandmother to \u2014 to \u2014 to\nhug them and kiss them or whatever. School functions, for parent and grandparents,\nthere were never any grandparents around. We used to adopt grandparents for them. In\nDetroit we use to a-adopt a lady in the apartment building. She was nice, and th \u2014\nGrandma Goldstein, that was her grandma. She did \u2014 she had one daughter, an old, old\nmaid, never married, so our children became her grandchildren. So the kids were \u2014\nknew they \u2014 and yet they knew, they knew why something was wrong, but we never\ntalked about it. The only time the kids would \u2014 our son was the first one, who was the\noldest. When I joined this soccer team in Detroit, which by the way was founded by\nGerman Jews who arrived to United States in the 30\u2019s, just before Hitler got to them.\nAnd I joined this team and pretty soon \u2014 there was a tryout \u2014 pretty soon there were\nmore survivors joining this team. So after soccer games we would go to someone\u2019s\nhome, yours, mine or someone else\u2019s and had a cookout or dinner, or whatever. We\nwould start talking about the game, then we would start talking about our lives in\nAmerica, how \u2014 how are we doing, how much money do you make. And before you\nknew it, Auschwitz would come to the \u2014 to \u2014 into the \u2014 into the conversation. And our\nchildren, especially our son, would always listen from be \u2014 from behind the door. And\n\u2014 and he knew \u2014 he \u2014 then he would tell his sisters, you know, I just heard something\nabout Daddy, or I heard something about Mom, about what ha \u2014 what happened to\nthem in the camps. So we didn\u2019t want to talk about these experiences to them. And ar\n\u2014 then, let me tell you about the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the local Jewish population. Detroit is a\nbig metropolitan city with a large Jewish population. We, Agnes and I, my wife Agnes\nwent to a school to learn English. I \u2014 at the Jewish Community Center in Detroit, and\nour soccer team will also meet there. So, I didn\u2019t go to that school because I\u2014I-\u2014I-I\nfelt I\u2014 I had enough of schooling, which was another mistake. Would have listened to\nmy wife I probably would have been sometime a teacher today somewhere. So we \u2014\nthen we tried to tell the local population, the local Jewish population, our \u2014 our own\npeople in \u2014 in the Jewish Community Center. We had a Purim play, we went to a\nPurim play, and then all of a sudden we start talking to these people about Auschwitz,\nno \u2014 number of us in the soccer team. And the leader of the group says, that\u2019s enough\nabout Auschwitz. Let\u2019s go back to singing and playing the music again. So nobody\nwant to listen. My own aunt, may she rest in peace, my father\u2019s youngest sister, who\nlost everybody in her family, she lost two sisters, she lost her brother, she lost all her\nnieces and nephews and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and all her cousins, she wouldn\u2019t \u2014 she, coming\nin 1939, emigrating to this country in 1939 from Vienna, Austria, she didn\u2019t want to\nlisten. So we decided not to talk about it. The first time I was able to talk about it was\nwhen our youngest daughter asked my wife to come to her eighth grade junior high\nschool to speak, and the next day my wife forced me to go there. Yet, I didn\u2019t tell them\na story like the story should be told. I kind of whitewashed it. I was afraid to hurt\npeople. So that took a long time. So my children, at f\u2014 at first they were resentful, they\nsaid Daddy, why didn\u2019t you tell us? Why \u2014 you know, th \u2014 they didn\u2019t come and \u2014 and\nsay to me, you \u2014 you \u2014 you were wrong, you \u2014 you should have done it. But you could\nhave told us. I didn\u2019t want to hurt you honey. This \u2014 this is simple, it\u2019s a \u2014 it the 0 \u2014\nit\u2019s the way it is, I'd \u2014 it just \u2014 I don\u2019t want to hurt strangers, let alone my own\nchildren. So they\u2019re different. But today they\u2019re very much involved. My daughter, the\noldest one, the physician was on the Holocaust Committee with me, which I am a\nchairman of [indecipherable] local \u2014 local Holocaust Committee called Jewish\nCommittee Relations. Both \u2014 all three of the daughters went to second generation\nmeetings, second generation of Holocaust survivors. In ninete \u2014 January 27, 1985, I\ntook two of my children, my son and my middle daughter, the New Yorker, the\njeweler, with me to Auschwitz for the commemoration of the 40\" anniversary of\nAuschwitz being liberated, if you can call being liberated by the Soviet Union a\nliberation. And they came there. I showed them, first of all Auschwitz number one,\nthat was the first camp that I was taken to. I showed them the barrack that my father\nwas last taken to, block seven in Auschwitz, called the Krankenbau, the sick bay.\nSick bay without doctors. I showed them that barrack. This is where they took my \u2014\nyour grandfather last time, to the ovens from. I showed them block 16 where I s \u2014\nwhere I was living on the \u2014 which by the way, block 16 today in Auschwitz is the\nCzechoslovakian block, a-a-and they have some artifacts in there. And we spend there\na couple da \u2014 two days in Auschwitz. And then of course in 1990, I went back again to\nAuschwitz, but this time I took agn \u2014 took Agnes with me, the same middle daughter\nand the youngest daughter. This 1s where we made a film called, \u201cAuschwitz, If You\nCried, You Died.\u201d So I sh \u2014 there I really pored my heart out to my children, to show\nthem what Auschwitz is all about, what it was all about. I took them to every \u2014 see I\nwas working as a slave laborer, a place called Kanada commando, unloading\nincoming Jews from every \u2014 every Nazi occupied European country. And this is where\nI gave my two daughters and my wife, who has not been to Auschwitz, their exact\nfeeling what Auschwitz was about. I explained to them crematorium one \u2014\ncrematorium one, which is in Auschwitz number one, which 1s still standing. Then we\nwent to Birkenau, which is the Auschwitz number two camp, and I showed them the\ncrematorias(ph). I worked as a slave laborer at Birkenau, 600 yards from the gas\nchambers and crematorias(ph). So the kids today know much more than they should\nhave known years ago, which I was afraid to tell them, to hurt them.",
        "A: About my fears? Well, the kids were always afraid that they would hurt me 1-if they\nwould talk to me about my fears because you know, it\u2019s bad enough that I had it, you\nknow? My son tried a number of times, he says, Dad, you know, you can go to water.\nYou can swim with the \u2014 look at your grandchildren, look at your little granddaughter,\nshe dives from this big diving board. He says, you don\u2019t have to dive, but you can go\nin the water deeper than you go into water. They tried it, but I \u2014 I \u2014 I-I \u2014 1\u2014 we were in\nIsrael, we just got back from Israel last week. We went to the swimming pool. There\nwere kids playing with a ball, I was playing soccer with them, you know, in a group. I\ndidn\u2019t want to go in that water. I went. Little \u2014 little above my knees, and anything that\n\u2014a-as soon as I feel the water above, I get scared, still to this day. So the fears, well,\nthe kids tried, but s \u2014 you know.",
        "A: The only way any dentist could touch my teeth, or es \u2014 extract them, have to put me\nto sleep. That\u2019s \u2014 I \u2014 no other way I would have done it. Yet, when I lost all these teeth\n\u2014 of course, I \u2014 when I got out of Auschwitz I had hardly any teeth left, but when I lost\nthe rest of them, this guy, this dentist was very gentle, whom I still have \u2014 course, now\nI don\u2019t need him, I only got thr-three teeth left. But even then, he knows how sensitive\nI am. When he cleans the remaining on my teeth, he makes sure that I get enough\nNovocain into me that I don\u2019t feel not even his \u2014 I don\u2019t even feel his finger. My lips\nand mouth is frozen for a whole day after that. So I \u2014 1-1-I\u2014 I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think\nI would want to be the doctor that I should be his patient.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: There are some of us that have the same fears, and especially those of us who \u2014\nunfortunately two of them are \u2014 two of them died in the recent years \u2014 those of us who\nspent in Auschwitz more than two years, because we didn\u2019t live through because of\ndoctors, because the doctors were there to kill you. But they had the same fears. I have\none friend who died in Skokie al \u2014 two years ago, Joe Neumann(ph). You \u2014 you\nmentioned his name [indecipherable] misspelled it anyway, but Joe was the same as\nme. He had \u2014 unfortunately, he died of an aneurism and \u2014 and a heart problem two\nyears ago. He was the strongest prisoner ever, among us. He was seven years \u2014 se-\nseven, eight years older than me and he looked like a real -- a real born Nazi. He had\nblonde, blue eyed \u2014 blonde hair, blue eyes. And Mengele liked him so much that he\nnever believed he was Jewish. He never \u2014 he always told him, Du bist kein Jude\nnicht \u2014 you\u2019re not a Jew. You \u2014 you are \u2014 you are a German. And he spoke pretty \u2014\npretty good German, too. We all did from Slovakia, you know. So we \u2014 we \u2014 and the\nother guy in f\u20141n his hist \u2014 he was historian, his name was Eric Kulka. Eric Kulka\nwas a\u2014 wr-wrote a number of books. In fact, he wrote the first book, him and another\nguy in pra \u2014 li\u2014 who lives in Prague, his name is Ota Kraus, they wrote the book\ncalled, \u201cThe Death Factory.\u201d Started in 1947, you can imagine, not even two years\nafter Auschwitz, they started this book. And I happen to have a copy of it also, but it \u2014\nthat book was printed in many, many languages. And this guy Kulka, he too had fears\nof doctors.",
        "A: We\u2019ve seen what doctors did to our \u2014 in Auschwitz. We knew when someone was\npulled from \u2014 from \u2014 from the bunk and being castrated by Mengele, or give him the \u2014\nthe injection, the shots, th-the \u2014 the penal what do you call it? The \u2014 the \u2014 the shot that\nkills you that th-they use in the pri \u2014 1n prisons when the death sentence fe \u2014 then th \u2014\nso they give you shots to kill you for \u2014 from a death row.",
        "A: Phenyl \u2014 penal \u2014 some kind of a thing. Well, I \u2014 I can\u2019t think of the name now, I\u2019m\nsure it\u20191l come to me. And these were the shots that were given in Germany, in \u2014 in\nthe \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in the concentration camps.",
        "A: Well, let me just \u2014 okay.",
        "A: Well le-let me \u2014 let me start with the fears. When I was first picked up in United\nStates Armed Forces, number one I didn\u2019t speak any \u2014 speak English. I spoke\nGerman, I spoke Hungarian, I spoke Russian, I spoke Polish. And the only reason I got\nalong with the army, because there was some people that were born in this country of\nPolish parents, of Czech parents, of Slovak parents and then I could communicate with\nthem. And there was a guy from Boston, of all places, and \u2014 a Jewish fellow by the\nname of Feldman, he was a schoolteacher. And he would teach me English, how did\nhe teach me English? By making me read \u201cStars and Stripes\u201d and also the army sent\nme to a school in \u2014 in Germany, in occupied Germany, I and E school. Information\neducation. Who was this school for? This school war \u2014 was not for people to \u2014 to learn\nEnglish, this was people from \u2014 from the illiterates. People from the south \u2014 and I\u2019m\nsorry not \u2014 I hope that nobody who listens to me, I don\u2019t think everybody in the south\ndoesn\u2019t know how to read. But these were guys who didn\u2019t go to schools. And they\nhad to write home letters from the armed forces. It was \u2014 they \u2014 they knew how to\ncarry a gun and shoot it, but they had problem reading or writing. So the ar \u2014 Feldman\nwas teaching this class called I and E, information education. And there would be a\nblackboard and on this blackboard there would be a letter. Dear folks, today I am in\nFrankfurt. I am fine, hope you are too. Love, your son John. And I would I-learn\nhow to read and write that way, plus this Feldman made me read \u201cStars and Stripes.\u201d\nAnd he would teach me English. I have a knack for languages and I learned the\nlanguage quite \u2014 quite qu-quickly in th \u2014 the American language, as well as other\nlanguages.",
        "A: Fears.",
        "A: Ah \u2014 oh - okay \u2014",
        "A: All right, I\u2019m sorry.",
        "A: Well, I got you \u2014 I got you this one. Now, fears in the army. I had fears in the army.\nAny time I\u2019ve seen soldiers march, I\u2019ve always looked back to see who was behind\nme. Those were the other fears. There was a Red Cross field director who had a\nwoman working for him, woman Red Cross, also a field dire \u2014 field person. She was\nfrom Milwaukee. Her name was Wanda Waleiko(ph) Wanda Waleiko(ph) was like\na psychia \u2014 psych-psychologist and she was in charge of me. She would always talk to\nme, try to get me back into \u2014 the ar \u2014 of course, in those days you didn\u2019t have\npsychiatrists like you have today. And she would try to talk to me and calm me down,\nand \u2014 and \u2014 and she was the one who tried to get the fear away from me, because she \u2014\nthey knew \u2014 soon I\u2014 when I ran away from the dentist they knew that something is\nwrong with me, that th \u2014 something has to be done. And I remember they gave me a\ncapsule to take to calm me down. And I don\u2019t know how to take this capsule. So what\nI\u2019ve done, I opened the capsule and I put the powder in my hand from the ca \u2014 th-the\ncontents into \u2014 and it was awfully bitter and that\u2019s what I took. I didn\u2019t know that you\ncan take the capsule and just swallow it and it dissolves. Who knew that, you know,\nfrom where? So, fears? Then I came to this country, I had fears here. I had awful fears\nhere. I was afraid of policemen. I was afraid of anything that \u2014 that had authority over\nme. See, I had my first job in this country in Detroit, Michigan. And my uncle, who\nwas my \u2014 my \u2014 my aunt\u2019s husband, he was ac p \u2014 accountant, C.P.A. And he would\nhelp me, reading the Detroit News and Detroit\u2019s Free Press to \u2014 in the a \u2014 want ads.\nAnd there was an ad in the paper, foreign speaking salesman wanted. So my uncle put\nme on a streetcar, and I went there. That\u2019s how I got my first job. And first job was\nworking in the \u2014 in the store, Zoleara(ph) department stores in Detroit Michigan on\nJefferson Avenue. And the store \u2014 we would sell merchandise to foreign people,\nAmericans that were \u2014 came from a foreign country. That would \u2014 now, war is over,\nthey had relatives in Europe, in Poland, in Hungary and wherever. They would\nreceive letters from \u2014 from their relatives and we would read the letters and they said,\nAnna needs a pair of pants, John needs a pair of shoes. Here is a piece of string, this is\nthe size of his foot. Here\u2019s a piece of string, this is size of his waist, for pants. And that\n\u2014 so that\u2019s what we used to do, that\u2019s how \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 that ma \u2014 was my first job. Then I\nwa \u2014 Started to lose a little f \u2014 little \u2014 little fear already, but I was still, 1f I can say it in\nthose words, I didn\u2019t have the trust, the faith. \u2019'd a\u2014I was always a \u2014 always afraid\nthat \u2014 that \u2014 th-that it\u2019s too good, you know, that it can\u2019t be, th-th-that\u2019s \u2014 you know. I\nalways look behind, who is behind me. And it took me a long time. Took me a very\nlong time, took me a very long time.",
        "A: I would say it took years, years. Five, six years or better. When I met my wife, and\nwe Started getting the children, even then I was always fearful, always very fearful\nabout my kids. It shouldn\u2019t happen to them what happened to the kids in Auschwitz.\nSo it took a long time. And the nightmares, you know, they were there for a long time,\nand \u2014 and let me tell you, even to this date, they don\u2019t stop. You know when they\ncome the strongest on? Let\u2019s say I\u2019m invited to speak at a university or a high school\nor college or civic or \u2014 or religious organization. And while I\u2019m speaking, I\u2019m fine.\nNow the questions come, and the questions bring back \u2014 bring out more than actual\npresentation because \u2014 see it \u2014 while I\u2019m speaking, I don\u2019t use any text. I never, never,\nnever use a piece of paper when I speak. I \u2014 I can\u2019t stand reading my life story at\nAuschwitz. But when I\u2019m speaking, I\u2019m reliving my time in Auschwitz, my time in\nSachsenhausen, my time in Landsberg and so on. And I \u2014 then I gotta \u2014 and it\u2019s all\nthere in front of you. Now you see yourself, you actually see in your own visual mind,\nyou see the days that you unloaded, the days that the selections are made at\nAuschwitz. So you see all that, you know. So you live that \u2014 you relive that. Now I\u2019m\nfinished the presentation. I\u2019m driving home from 60, 70, sometime 100 miles out of\nthe state, sometimes be different states. And as I go home I\u2019m \u2014 now I\u2019m trying to\ncalm myself down. I go to bed at night and I get nightmares. You know that \u2014 never a\nday goes by that Auschwitz doesn\u2019t come ba \u2014 come in your head. And it isn\u2019t\nbecause they tattoo a number on my arm. That is, you know, here I am. The same way\nwith my children as they got older. I tried to tell them a little more about it, you know,\nand then \u2014 now they\u2019re in college. You worry about them away from home. Then they\ncome home with boyfriends. You know, from the \u2014 from the \u2014 from the day they were\nborn, when there was bris, when there was a circumcision, people are there, my a \u2014 my\naunt, my wife\u2019s uncle is the godfather, and you\u2019re looking for people to come to your \u2014\nthere. I\u2019m looking for the people that never show up. I\u2019m looking the people that I\nwanted to be there, they\u2019re not there. Our ya \u2014 oldest daughter got engaged. Young\nman came to ask for her hand. And I \u2014I broke down something terrible. Broke down\nsomething terrible, from happiness and sadness. Here I\u2019ve got a daughter who is ready\nto get married. She will never see her grandmother, never see her cousins, never see\nanyone else at her wedding, you know. And then, when there is happiness and sadness,\nwho do you share it with? Just with the immediate family. Your wife and your\nchildren. And your children try to calm you down, they try to come to you and, you\nknow. And I feel very sad about those things, you know. Now our little daughter in\nSwitzerland is gonna make us grandparents, okay? So here she 1s, 4,000 miles away\nfrom us. And my wife and I, we insist we\u2019re going to be there when the kid 1s born but\nhow do we \u2014 how do you figure that out? Yeah, so \u2014 yeah.",
        "A: When I first got picked up by the United States Armed Forces, called 774 tank\nbattalion, this was before the camps were even near. They were \u2014 this was quite a ways\nfrom any camp, away from Dachau. And when I showed them this number, when I\ntold them what it\u2019s all about, this Polish American from Chicago brings over his\ncaptain, his name was Captain Yogerling(ph), and he brings him over who is a \u2014 who\nwas an attorney from home. And he\u2019s try \u2014 he\u2019s telling him what I tell him in Polish\nwhat happened. They were sh-shrugging their shoulder. They had no idea what I \u2014 wh-\nwhat I \u2014 what I came from. They seen a guy who \u2014 who weighed nothing, like me, I\nwas a\u2014a Skinny skeleton runt. And they tried to feed \u2014 first of all they cleaned me up\nfrom head to toe, they had the \u2014 they had these traveling showers, what the army\nshower had carried around, they were wide open and they had water, and they had a\nlittle shower head and then they gave you soap and DDT powder to spray you. And\nthen they gave me clean uniform, clean fatigue, clean pair of boots. First time I had\nunderwear on 1n almost three years, an-and socks and pair of \u2014 pair of army boots. And\ntried to tell them, they knew nothing until they hit the first concentration camp. And\neven then they didn\u2019t understand. They\u2019re seeing this mass of bodies coming out of\ncattle cars, gotta \u2014 or coming out of \u2014 just walking over dead people. They couldn\u2019t\nunderstand how could anybody do this to anybody. And then I start to tell them. See,\nthis is what happened in Auschwitz. This 1s what happened in the camps, in the Nazi\ndeath camps. And then, of course, they started, you know, being rowdy on the streets.\nEvery time they seen a German on the bicycle they kicked him off, took his bicycle.\nThey did all sorts of things just to \u2014 they want to beat up every German they\u2019ve seen\non the street. Of course the \u2014 the officers stopped them because he \u2014 you \u2014 you don\u2019t \u2014\nAmerica you don\u2019t \u2014 you don\u2019t do these things in America, you don\u2019t do these things\nin war. So they di \u2014 really didn\u2019t know, didn\u2019t have the slightest idea. And they didn\u2019t\nknow how to treat us. What they would do? Every American, naive, goodhearted\nAmerican Joe would give you \u2014 this G.I. Joe would give you his k \u2014 K rations, his C\nrations, feed the heck out of you, give you a sh \u2014 Hershey bar, and then top it off with\na cigarette, with a Camel cigarette. And in the meanwhile, they were killing you,\nbecause th \u2014 our bodies couldn\u2019t take the food. The mal-nutritious body just could not\ntake that type of treatment. Then the medics came, so what did they do? They came to\nthese camps and they took their uniforms off and burned them, and put on whatever\nclothes they could get from UNRRA, from any organization, they start putting clothes\non us. As good as they were, thousands and thousands of survivors died after ha \u2014 after\nthe \u2014 after liberation.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t know what to do with us, until the medical groups came when they\nfinally decided that that\u2019s not the way to treat them. And then, of course, then they\nopened the displaced person camps, and which I was not part of ba \u2014 part of one, but \u2014\nand I\u2019ve seen displaced person camps, and let me tell you, I\u2019m glad I wasn\u2019t a part of\none, because displaced person camps were just like camps. They were not like Nazi \u2014\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: Well, when I was picked up at the United States forces, and \u2014 and the field kitchen\nwas operating, you \u2014 you \u2014 they had all field kitchens, I don\u2019t know if you know what\na field kitchen is, but it\u2019s an army unit kitchen. And they tried to f \u2014 they fed me too,\nand I had a problem. The first thing 1s, the food went right through me. And I was very\nfortunate, we had a medic on \u2014 with us, a medical unit with us, and they gave me some\n\u2014 some \u2014 some coal tablets, you know, charcoal tablets to stop \u2014 stop my \u2014 my \u2014 my \u2014\nmy \u2014 my \u2014",
        "A: Diarrhea. And one of the doctors tried to s-say di \u2014 don\u2019t give him so much food,\nyou know. Of course that\u2019s easy for \u2014 for him to say don\u2019t give me so much food,\nbecause he didn\u2019t stand in the chow line wi \u2014 like I did. I had a [indecipherable] on\nthe chow line and I piled it up. Of course, it got better with me, I was one of the\nfortunate ones for this reason, because I was a Kanada worker, I was also in a better\nphysical shape than the other prisoners were. So I had a little more. Although I had\nswollen eyes and swollen feet and swollen hands from malnutrition, but I was not as\nbad off as the other ones. So it took less time for me to digest \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to be able\nto digest the food. And it took awhile, I would say it took a couple of weeks at least,\nbut I was always hungry. I was always the first one in the chow line. And then I st \u2014\nthen, of course, put me to work in the kitchen, see, and I was working you n \u2014 in \u2014 in\nthe mess kitchen. So that was even better. And we had a \u2014 we had a cook, this mess\nsergeant, I don\u2019t know if you know what a mess sergeant is. That\u2019s the guy who 1s 1n\ncharge of the army ki-kitchen. He has cooks under him. His name was sad sack, they\nused to call him sad sack. And he would kind of take care of me and we used to \u2014 he\nused to go into town and \u2014 and we used to \u2014 he-he was stationed in Furth, Germany,\nf-u-r-t-h, which is a s\u2014 a suburb of Nuremberg. But I found out of course, many\nyears later, Henry Kissinger came from Furth. And he would go to this small town,\ngo to the farm, steal a few chickens, steal some fresh milk and bring them back to the\nG.Ls, bring them back to the kitchen. And we had fresh eggs. Normally we used to\nhave powder eggs, the army powder eggs. And he would take me with him in the Jeep\nand we would go organize. The reason he took me with him, because I spoke German.\nFor a couple of cigarettes he would get anything he wanted in a farm \u2014 farm place. So\nfor me it\u2019s \u2014 didn\u2019t take as long to get down to the system where I could eat.",
        "A: Well, at Auschwitz, my fingers and my toes were frozen. So, I had very poor\ncirculation in my \u2014 in my hands, in my feet, my blood circulation. And when I was\nexamined, which I can show you, when I was sworn into the United States Armed\nForces, when I was examined by the medical group of \u2014 in the army, they did find a\nlittle \u2014 they don\u2019t put it down there as much, but they found some wrong. I had\ncracked fingers, my fingers opened up because of the froze \u2014 ba \u2014 frostbite and same\nthing with my toes. My \u2014 all my hair fell off from my legs, and that was because the\nblood circulation was poor. And my fingers, even to this date, when it s \u2014 gets real\ncold, tips of my fingers get white, even with gloves on. So that was one medical\nproblem I had. Other than that, I didn\u2019t have too many problems, medical problems,\nexcept being afraid of doctors and not going to one and probably if I would have gone\nto doctors and they would have possibly gave me some sort of mediation to \u2014 to \u2014 to\nmake me better, I probably would have been better. But I\u2014 I \u2014 I healed quite fast.",
        "A: I found some of them that got to be interested much later. See, when I was with \u2014\npicked up by the army, last days of ni \u2014 o-of March 19 twe \u2014 1945, first part of ma \u2014\nApril. April 6, 1945, President Roosevelt died, and I was already in with this unit. 74 \u2014\n774 tank battalion, and I remember over the army radio system came the news and\neverybody was so hushed up about it, so you know, President Roosevelt died. That\nwas April 6\", 1945. And by then I was getting, you know, much better. So some of the\nboys after the war, May 8\", 1945, some of the boys \u2014 I found a couple of Jewish boys\nin the sa \u2014 1n the unit. One would not eat un-kosher food, so he was given special \u2014\nspecial food. And this guy wanted to know more, a little bit more about it, and since he\nfound out that most of the Jews were murdered in Europe, so he started asking me the\nquestions, so I would talk to him a little bit about it. Then, was a chaplain there also,\nand the chaplain would ask, but very few people really cared, because you know, here\nwere these young boys, 19 \u2014 20 \u2014 21 years old boys away from those \u2014 4,000 miles\naway from their home, they would sing [sings] I'll be home for Christmas, 1945, you\nknow. Or singing that type of song and worrying about one thing only, letters from\nhome. Mail call was the biggest thing in the world because you were late \u2014 letter from\nyour mom, from your girlfriend, from your brothers, from your sisters and this was the\nbig thing. I was a small fry. Here I was, a Jewish boy who survived concentration\ncamps they knew nothing about. And not only they knew nothing about, some of them\ncould care less. To them a crap game was more interesting than my story, which I\ndidn\u2019t tell, to certain groups. I tell you, this Jewish guy, a Sephardic Jew, is a\u2014 came\nfrom a Spanish type of family, and he was very much interested. He was a religious\nperson and he wanted to know what ha \u2014 why did the Jew \u2014 why did they do it to Jews,\nhe would ask me. I wish I could tell you why they do it \u2014 did it to Jews. But the Jews\nwere the one earmarked for ba \u2014 to be \u2014 to be murdered. And he was the only one that\nI would conver \u2014 oh, and the teacher, sorry, Feldman, who came from Boston. He was\nanother one, he wanted to know what happened, because his parents and his\ngrandparents came from somewhere in eastern Europe. But other than that most of\nthem get a furlough to go to Paris to have a good time with the girls. That was the\nmain thing. Get a weekend pass, or go to town. We were stationed then still in\nGermany, but on the way from Germany towards France, because this unit, 770 \u2014\n774 tank battalion, these boys had enough points \u2014 and let me explain what the points\nwere. Points were, if you served in service that such and such \u2014 long time, you were\ngiven points for each month. And if you were married and had family, that was extra\npoints, so you could come home earlier. Now this bat-battalion, 774 tank battalion was\nready to go home in September 1945. Now here they go from Germany with a convoy\nwe going towards France. We ended up in the camp called Camp Lucky Strike.\nCamp Lucky Strike, the ne \u2014 Holocaust Museum has a photograph of me in the\nCamp Lucky Strike, in a tent picture, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m in a tent over there. Outside a tent,\nI\u2019m sorry. And now we come to LaHavre, France. And here\u2019s an interesting story.\nI\u2019m sure I told this to the Holocaust Museum, but I\u2019m going to repeat it if I \u2014 1f I did,\nso I\u2019]l repeat it. LaHavre, France was an embarkation, it was the \u2014 this ab \u2014 th \u2014\nwhere the camp \u2014 embarkation camp, this is where you got on ships to go back home.\nNow here is my unit going on a ship called Lieutenant Colonel James Barker. That\u2019s\nthe troop carrier. The na \u2014 that ship is named after this colonel. Now they don\u2019t know\nwhat to do with me. They wanted to put me on a ship, and I\u2019m ready to go. I would be\ngoing on the ship with them to go to United States. Well, Captain Yogerling(ph), who\nis an attorney from home says, we\u2019re gonna get him in trouble. What they wanted to\ndo, the other captain wanted to do, take him \u2014 go into Boston, to \u2014 tha-that was our \u2014\nthe \u2014 they would stop in Boston, we would get discharged in Boston, get our \u2014 get our\npapers in Boston, and then leave for Boston. Get our papers and everything else.\nDischarge papers. Well, Captain Yogerling(ph) felt 1f I\u2019m going to be put on a ship \u2014\nthe other captain said, let\u2019s take him on with us, put him on the ship and when we get\nto Boston, turning him in to the authorities, to immigration office, and tell them he\u2019s\ngot an aunt here he \u2014 he can go to his aunt. Now, Captain Yogerling(ph), who is an\nattorney from home, this is nuts, this is illegal entry to United States and he will be\npunished, he will \u2014 he will be sent \u2014 sent back to where \u2014 wherever they send him\nback. So Captain Yogerling(ph) decided un \u2014 took me on a Jeep, with my duffle bag \u2014\nand the guys collected money. The \u2014 the \u2014 my group, company A, which I was with,\nthey collected dollars to give me, you know, to \u2014 so I have some money with me. They\ntook me \u2014 Captain Yogerling(ph) drove me to Camp Home Run, which was \u2014 that\nwas the name of the camp, which was an embarkation camp, but I\u2019m going to tell you\nwhat the camp meant \u2014 may be an embarkation. Replacement troops. This is what the\ntroops will be coming to replace the troops that went home. And I went to the Camp\nHome Run, the Captain Yogerling(ph) took me with him, took me to the camp\ncommander. And the camp commander kind of welcomed me, they got \u2014 they stuck\nme with the name Chesskey(ph), you know, that was the \u2014 that was given to me\nalready by this unit. Captain Yogerling(ph) said that\u2019s what they call him,\nChesskey(ph). So I got into this camp, and what I be gi \u2014 what kind of job they give\nme? To be in charge of a officer\u2019s dry cleaning and laundry, manned by German\nprisoners, all right? First thing the captain of \u2014 of \u2014 of Home Run, Captain Home Run\ntells me who was in charge of us in that area. He says to me, Chesskey(ph), you\u2019re\ngoing to be working, you\u2019re going to be in charge of this laundry. Now, there are\nGerman prisoners there. We didn\u2019t come here to make concentration camps, we came\nhere to bring democracy. And that\u2019s what it was. I was there, I was sworn into the\nUnited States Armed Forces at Camp Home Run with another fellow, whose name is\nalso misspelled on the list you have, whose name was Raymond Delafonte(ph)\nQuinones(ph). He was a Spaniard, not Jewish. Now we sworn into United States\nArmed Forces. However, it was a wrong form, a regular army form. United States has\ntwo armies. Army of United States and regular army. Well, the colonel who swore us\nin tipped [indecipherable] over it and put down Army of United States, sent it to the\nwar department of Washington. Oh, I would say a couple of months later, came back\ndisapproved. Attached new forms to re-sign. In the meanwhile, my aunt was found in\nDetroit, Michigan. There was a Jewish chaplain whose na \u2014 are also from Chicago, in\nCamp Home Run, whose name was Michael Lipschitz(ph), and Michael\nLipschitz(ph), I to \u2014 showed him I f\u2014 my aunt was found too, by the Red Cross and\nby the army, what do I do? He went to the colonel, the company \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 th-the \u2014\nthe \u2014 the camp commander and he told him the story, so I didn\u2019t have to re-sign.\nRaymond Dellafonta(ph) Quinones(ph), soon as he signed the new papers, was\nshipped to South Pacific. And this what would happen to me. Now waiting for my\naunt papers to come, and the army papers came, the army gave me referral to go to\nCzechoslovakia go pick up some passports and \u2014 and \u2014 an-and birth certificates. But\nsha \u2014 never got a birth certificate. Passport I bought in \u2014 in Paris at the Czech embassy,\nand I came to this \u2014 and that\u2019s how I came to United States.",
        "A: No. When I came to United States? No, no, I didn\u2019t go with \u2014 on a ship.",
        "A: I flew on TWA. It was a \u2014 they had e-e-emergency flights, like for instance, let\u2019s\nsay a G.I.\u2019s mother is dying, or died, they would \u2014 they would fly him home. And I\nwas on one of those planes and I was on the standby, and they had found a seat for me.\nAnd I came to United States May 10\", 19 \u2014 May \u2014 May 10\", 1946. Took 17 hours to\nget here by TWA flight.",

        "A: \u2014 refueled, yeah. And I was scared t-to death. I came to New York on a Saturday\nmorning. I went to s \u2014 went to a family that knew my family, that knew my aunt and\nalso knew my parents. These were religious Jews, of course \u2014",
        "A: Oh they \u2014 I got my aunts \u2014 my aunt gave me the information. Oh, I got to \u2014 they\nwere the ones who helped my aunt to \u2014 to \u2014 to get transportation for me. There \u2014 they\nwere in \u2014 fur manufacturers in New York City, quite Orthodox religious. Very \u2014 in\nfact, very Orthodox religious. And I arrive on a Saturday, Saturday morning. So I went\nthrough the immigration office and you gotta pay head tax, six dollars head tax. And I\nhad money sewn in a duffle bag, but I didn\u2019t want to [indecipherable] duffle bag\n[indecipherable] because they told me that you\u2019re only allowed to bring so much\nmoney. I didn\u2019t have six dollars. So the immigration officer was a Jewish guy and he\npaid for me, and he says, I know. I saw y \u2014 I tried to call the Birman(ph) family, the\npeople that I went to, they lived in Brooklyn. And he says, don\u2019t even try calling him.\nThey won\u2019t answer this \u2014 the phone on a Saturday. So he put me on a subway to get to\nBrooklyn. And that\u2019s how I got to the people. I knocked on the door, I \u2014 and they\nwere \u2014 had the Sabbath lunch. I come over there and then they direct me to the\nbathroom, and what do I do in the bathroom? I shave. One of the son comes in he says,\nyou don\u2019t do this on Saturday. I come out, eat lunch, put a cigarette in my mouth. You\ncan\u2019t smoke on Saturday. So the old man, Mr. Birman(ph) says to me now, you know,\nI am not God\u2019s policeman, but you can\u2019t s-s-smoke here on Shabbas \u2014 on Sabbath. But\nthey were very, very lovely people. They helped me. In fact they \u2014 they took me to buy\nme the first suit. You know, they were the new manufact \u2014 in those days th-things\nwere still on ration, so to speak, you know there was a \u2014 nothing was \u2014 you couldn\u2019t\nbuy a shirt there \u2014 a shirt, or suits. They took me to a suit manufacturer and bought me\na \u2014 bought me a suit, shirt, tie. Then they took the la \u2014 Mrs. Birman(ph) took me next\nday to Macy\u2019s and bought me a pair of shoes. And I took my uniform, of course home,\nmy army uniform.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "A: Never. Never.",
        "A: Never been on a\u2014 never been on a bus, let alone a subway. I was in \u2014 1n Jeeps, and\nI was in trucks, in G.I. trucks. That \u2014 that I drove. Motorcycles the G.I.s used to steal\nfrom the Germans. But then, never on a subway.",
        "A: All I had on me \u2014 all I had with me was my uniform, my duffle bag and my field\nbag. Do you know what a field bag is like? A carry on bag to [indecipherable] you\nwould call it today.",

And then I got to Brooklyn, now I gotta walk up the\nsteps from the k \u2014 from the \u2014 from the subway to the street. Now what\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s not\ntoo hard because it was all written, you know, there\u2019s a \u2014 the streets were marked. And\nthat wasn\u2019t too \u2014 too hard, but what was the hardest part, Saturday evening after\nSabbath, the Birman(ph) boys and their wives, they were older than I, took me for a\nride to Manhattan to buy a newspaper. They wanted to go to Manhattan, to show me\nManhattan. I never seen anything like it. ve never seen so many tall buildings. My li\n\u2014 my \u2014 was scratching my \u2014 stretching my neck like a giraffe, you know, that\u2019s all I\nwas looking at. And next day, Sunday, they had a summer home in New Jersey on the\nle \u2014 on the lake, so they took me there. So that was my introduction to United States.",

        "A: Only relative, yes, and her \u2014 and her son. She had a little baby boy three years old.",
        "A: Well, you know, I wish I could explain that feeling. I \u2014 of course it was emotional\nto her, you know, but me, it\u2019s a\u2014 you know, I been by myself for so many years, you\nknow, this is \u2014 so I came to her ap \u2014 she had an apartment, she gave me a little small\nroom with a Murphy bed in it, and I really don\u2019t know ho-how to explain that feeling,\nit was \u2014 it was kind of strange feeling, here I am from the camps, from the army, into\ncivilization. Didn\u2019t know how to cope with it. I had a hard time coping with it.",
        "A: Well, as soon as I got a job I kind of readjusted because I got busy with \u2014 with my\nwork. Now I\u2019m going to tell you how \u2014 interesting how I got the job. Foreign speaking\nsalesman wanted, that\u2019s how I got the job. Mr. Zolcar(ph), the boss was in th \u2014 five\nfoot man. He had two sons working for him in the store and a son-in-law, and me, plus\na few other people and the manager of the store, whose name was Joe Zwartney(ph).\nAnd when I got there the old man looks at me and speaks with a Yiddish accent, he\nsaid, are you a salesman? I told him I just came to America a few days ago. And asked\nme what languages you speak? I tell him. He said, go in the shipping room \u2014 the stock\nroom, see Joe Zwartney(ph). Zwartney(ph) spoke a number of languages, American\nborn Pole, Polish guy. He spoke Yiddish, he spoke Polish, he spoke Hungarian, he had\nall the languages, because that \u2014 that was a store. And the old man didn\u2019t tell me I\u2019m\ngoing to pay you six dollars, or seven dollars or whatever, he didn\u2019t tell me how much\nhe\u2019s going to pay me. This is Monday morning, Saturday 1s payday and everybody got\npaid in a small envelope, cash. He gave me 56 dollars, my first week\u2019s pay. That\u2019s a\nlot of money in 1946. So I stayed with him for almost six years and I learned the\nbusiness, then I became a shoe buyer, that\u2019s how I knew the New England shoe\ncompanies. And I stayed with him until six years, then I went to work for another\ncompany, and I ended up with the company I mentioned called Shopper\u2019s Fair.",
        "A: A little \u2014 my wife got there in March 1947.",
        "A: I was there from May 10\", 1946 until March 1947 before I met her.",
        "A: Well, I played soccer. I went to the Jewish Community Center. I met with people\nlike myself, other survivors. We became \u2014 we were called the new Americans. We had\nmeetings. We had people that would do music, you know, all sorts of music and we\nhad people that were interested in our life stories. There was a guy who owned a\nsupermarket chain, a Jewish person who was a \u2014 quite a philanthropist. He hired a\nnumber of us \u2014 not me, but he hired a number of the boys to work on supermarkets.\nSome of them he made managers 1-1n there \u2014 in \u2014 in there \u2014 in s -- in some time, as \u2014\nas soon as they learned the tricks of the trade, so to speak. So we \u2014 we kind of kept to\nourselves, because \u2014 you know what they used to calls us? Greeners. Greeners mean\ngreen people.",
        "A: New people, and greenhorns. They call us greenhorns. In Yiddish griners(ph). And\nthat\u2019s how we kept going. Soccer was really helpful to me. It got all the anxiety out of\nyou, the nervousness out of you. You kicked the ball you were kicking the Germans,\nyou know, an-and that type of thing. So \u2014 and of course I met some good people in\nsoccer too, some of the old time Germans who came here before us. One was the\nMetropolitan Life Insurance salesman, he\u2019s on the picture with \u2014 on th \u2014 on the soccer\nteam with us, he was our manager. And every person who played for him bought his \u2014\nbought the policies, and that was his business.",
        "A: Among ourselves, yes. Among ourselves we used to. You know, we didn't believe\nourselves that we still were free yet, you know, we were still, you remember what\nhappened there, you remember what happened here. And remember when you worked\nover there and you did over there, and then \u2014 and that type of \u2014 oh, Auschwitz always\ncame up. See, because we were one of the first ones 1n this country, and some of us\nwere old time survivors. You had some Polish Jewish boys there who not only\nsuffered in Auschwitz, but suffered before Auschwitz. They suffered in Warsaw\nghetto and Bialystok ghetto, Lodz ghetto. So these guys, from \u201941 on had a \u2014a hell of\na tough time with their \u2014 in their lives, lost all \u2014 everybody \u2014 I don\u2019t remember anyone\nof these boys who played on the soccer team that came with a sibling or a parent. Lone\nsurvivors. Yeah, one of them did. One had a brother, yeah. And he is on the \u2014 they\u2019re\nboth on the team with us.",
        "A: No, because I soon became friendly with American \u2014 American boys. I met two\nbrothers, two Jewish boys, you know, Fleischer(ph) boys. Their name is \u2014 last name is\nFleischer(ph), Matt and Ben Fleischer(ph). And both of them were in armed servi \u2014\none was in the army, one was in the navy during World War II, and we became quite\nfriendly. And I-I st \u2014 I started to break away from that group and started to find more\nAmerican friends. Soon my wife and I \u2014 of course we be \u2014 we did belong to the\nnewcomer club, that \u2014 that we did, that we joined. It was a \u2014 it was a club that you\njoined and then it was all survivors. Or survivors married non-survivors. You know,\nlike one girl married an American, the other \u2014 the other boy married an American girl,\nyou know, that was \u2014 that ca \u2014 that type of a mixture. I-I-In the 40\u2019s, you know, the\nshidduch \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the matchmakers was \u2014 was \u2014 was \u2014 the still \u2014 still in\naction among the Jewish crowds, among the Jewish parents. You know, they would\nask who are you, what are you, how old are you? Boy, have I got a daughter for you.\nYou know, that type of story, see? So with me, it didn\u2019t work that way. I was going\nwith another girl before I met Agnes. I shouldn\u2019t say it so loud. And all this girl\nwanted to do was get married. And anything and anything \u2014 anything goes, but she\nwants to get married. And my aunt was in love with the girl. She thought she was the\ngreatest thing for me. But I found out soon that she was not for me, and when I met\nAgnes, see. So \u2014",
        "A: It\u2019s a very interesting meeting, actually. As I told you, there was a school at the\nJewish Community Center what was teaching newcomers English. But we also had\nmeetings there with the \u2014 with the soccer team, the Jewish soccer team, these were\ncalled the Maccabees. And I would go to t\u2014 Thursday was our meetings and Thursday\nwas their school. So every time you went to the meeting, after the meeting I would\nwalk into the class \u2014 I knew the teacher, to look to see if there are new girls in the\nclass. Well, here I see this young, good looking lady, Agnes, with another man who\ncame with her, also a survivor and he walked her, 1t was \u2014 it was a walking distance\nfrom the me \u2014 it wasn\u2019t that far, maybe a mile walk. And I started walking with them.\nAnd being an old American already, almost a year, I took them to Saunder\u2019s.\nSaunder\u2019s was a ice cream and \u2014 and confectionary place where you could buy cakes,\nice cream. Being a hotshot I knew what to buy, ap-apple pie and ice cream, you know,\nand coffee. And then I walked them home, and I got \u2014 kind of pushed this guy aside,\nand before you knew it, we started dating. We dated from I would say end of March\n\u201947, and then the following year, February, we got married. February 22\". And the\nwedding was in a house, Agnes\u2019s aunt\u2019s and uncle\u2019s house. Wer \u2014 we got married by\nthe same rabbi who married Agnes\u2019s parents in Hungary. Name was\n[indecipherable] and he married us. Gypsy music playing, because these were\nHungarian Jews, Gypsy music they brought, playing and \u2014 you know. And, a nice \u2014\nnice affair, la \u2014 home \u2014 home \u2014 home in the house. Hippa(ph) and th \u2014 you know, the\ncanopy. And one of my friends was my best man, an American boy who became \u2014 was\nmy best friend. So that\u2019s how we met and we got married.",
        "A: Li\u2014 blocking you?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Well, she was afraid of it. She was actually afraid of it, she didn't want to talk about\nit. My aunt had some psychological problems, I think. We found out much later she\nhad Alzheimer\u2019s. But she never wanted to talk about it. She had a only child. After 18\nyears of being married, the kid was born. They didn't want to have any children in sh \u2014\nin Austria, so they came here and it took them a long time before they had the child.\nAnd now is no \u2014 he js now in his 50\u2019s. He was \u2014 he was three years old in 1946, so in\nhis 50\u2019s. What is \u2014 what is he? How old is he?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s all, yes, mm-hm, my first cousin. Very prominent attorney in Cincinnati,\none of the largest law firms, and not only in Cincinnati but all over the wor \u2014 all over\nthe \u2014 they have some in Europe, in \u2014 in Asia they got law offices. And he is a \u2014 he\nwas the first Jewish boy hired by this law firm. It was Taft, with one of the Taft\nfamily, and Hollister and as \u2014 and it\u2019s a huge, huge law firm. And he\u2019s now a partner\nthere for last, I would say 15 \u2014 20 years. The first Jew to become a partner of a \u2014 of a\nvery kind of Christians \u2014 for Christian organization.\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",

And\nhe\u2019s now just graduated one of the big colleges in the east, and he spent some time in\nEngland. He\u2019s back home now, taking some time out to go to grad school. And \u2019'm\nquite close with him. He does look like my father and his son does also look like my\nfather. And \u2014 red hair like my father had, fire red hair and a very bright, bright, bright\nguy. My children love him, you know. He comes \u2014 Thanksgiving is never without him.\nIn fact, he\u2019s very upset with me, I was supposed to be there last weekend. He wants us\nover there so we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll see if \u2014 if I can get away from soccer this weekend, we\u2019ll go\nover there.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know if you can call it anger. I call it resentment.",
        "A: Resenting that about myself, that I don\u2019t have anyone \u2014 anyone from my immediate\nfamily in the \u2014 close to me. I had a brother who was a strong, feisty young man, young\nboy. He was murdered weeks after he wa \u2014 was taken away by the Nazis. I had a\nsister, you\u2019ve seen her picture, pretty strong girl, another one who [indecipherable].\nMy father, a strong cattle and horse dealer, who fell to the Nazis like \u2014 like this. So my\nanger 1s, why me and why not them? At least, why not me with them? This is wa \u2014 this\nis what it is. There are times I feel so lonely about it, so lonesome, yet I am so close\nwith my children. This 1s all I have, my children, my grandchildren. But I\u2019m missing\nthe most important thing in my life. If you can call it anger, that\u2019s anger. But I resent, I\nf\u2014Isay why it had to happen to me?",
        "A: God? I have a problem with God. I have an argument with God. Of course, he\ndoesn\u2019t answer me. I never lost the identity where I came from. Never lost that I was\nborn to a Jewish family. I was born to a God fearing Jewish family in easter \u2014 in\nEurope, in ch \u2014 in Slovakia. In fact, I was quite religious, for a number of years.\nWhen I got to Auschwitz I still had belief in religion, a belief in God, but I soon lost\nthat. If God wanted to punish us Jews, if we did something that terribly wrong, punish\nus for a day, a week or three da \u2014 whatever. But let us suffer from 1939 in Slovakia, in\nPoland, in Ukraine, in all the other European countries, from 1939 til 1945, let us\nbeing systematically murdered, thrown into the ovens. And me, working the ga \u2014\nworking that railroad tracks, and seeing that with my own eyes, knowing what these\nmass of thousands upon thousands of people were being herded like sheep, not\nknowing where they\u2019re going, I have an anger with God. I have a problem with God. If\nit wouldn\u2019t be for Agnes, I probably would never stepped in a temple, my foot in a\ntemple. She says, we have children, we have to do something. We have to let them \u2014\nlet them do, and then when they get older let them \u2014 let them lead their own way, but\nteach \u2014 show them the way first. Well, we did that. Our son was Bar Mitzvah, our little\n\u2014 our young \u2014 oldest daughter was Bat Mitzvahed, the other two weren\u2019t. But I still\nwhen I go to the temple I feel like \u2014 like a hypocrite. Where was God for three years,\nletting this happen, the systematic destruction of every Jew in Europe? That\u2019s my\nanger with God. You know, in Yiddish there \u2014 I\u2014 I \u2014 there\u2019s a saying, Ehob tsores\nwich hemas borach (ph). I\u2019ve got troubles with God, problems with God. Where were\nyou \u2014 wh-when \u2014 where were you? There\u2019s some time I\u2019m speak to a group of\nChristian churches, some \u2014 some guy came up to me after the questions and he\u2019s \u2014 he\n\u2014he may [indecipherable] while \u2014 while I was answering the question he cames up to\nthe \u2014 to the microphone and he says, but you Jews were the chosen people. So I, being\na sarcastic with a sick sense of humor, well why didn\u2019t God choose somebody else for\nthis? Why were we chosen to be burned and gassed? So th-th-this is my anger. I don\u2019t\nhave an ounce of hate in me. Anger 1s not hate, because if you hate, you die inside. I\u2019m\nangry because this happened, and I\u2019m angry because I\u2019m the only one from my\nimmediate family. Wouldn\u2019t that be wonderful if my brother would \u2014 could see his\nnieces and nephews being a success?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Suicidal? No. No. In Auschwitz, yes, I thought about it, but outside of Auschwitz,\nnever. When I married and started to see my children, I said here is my life. This is\nwhat I want to live for. In Auschwitz I was this close from running to the fence, to the\nelectric fence.",
        "A: I had typhus. 1943, I had typhus in Auschwitz, and I thought for sure that\u2019s the end\nof me. When you have typhoid fever in Auschwitz, your equilibrium, you lose that,\nyou lose hearing, totally. You don\u2019t hear. And if it wouldn\u2019t be for two guys that saved\nmy life in Kanada commando where I was working \u2014 under my ar \u2014 under my arms\nthey would drag me through the gates. When I got to Kanada commando, in a pile of\nclothes they would cover me up and bring me some water, hot water to drink, with \u2014\nwith lemon if they could find it among the packages that the Jews brought with them.\nAnd that\u2019s how they \u2014 that\u2019s how they helped me come out of it. If they would left me\nin the barracks, I would have been in the ovens. And that\u2019s when I wanted to walk to\nthe wires, and they stopped me. Unfortunately both of them died already. One died in\nNew York and one died in Slovakia.",
        "A: The world. The world looked the other way. You know, we never believed that\nanyone knew about us. We never believed in Auschwitz that anybody knew what was\ngoing on because if somebody would believe, somebody would do something.\nSomebody would stop. When I got out of Auschwitz, it took many years to find out\nwh-who knew and who didn\u2019t know. United States knew in 1942 that there were Jews\nbeing murdered in th \u2014 in th \u2014 in \u2014 in the camps. They didn't have all the details, but\nthey knew. How did I find out? Through documentaries, through Shoah. Jan Karski,\nprofessor at \u2014 in Washington, Georgetown University. He was a Polish courier, he\ncame to this country, came to England, came to Switzerland. He was talking to these\npeople, to \u2014 to the presidents, the Churchill and no one wanted to do \u2014 they knew,\nthey believed, but didn\u2019t do anything about it. In my stay at Auschwitz, on two\noccasion the international Red Cross came. Once in Auschwitz one, and then in\nBirkenau the following year. Not one time did the Nazis let them into the barracks.\nWe were all lined up in a roll call place, standing sc \u2014 clean, with clean uniforms. They\ncleaned up the camp. You know what the cleaned up camp meant? They took all the\nprisoners who were looking like skeletons, or half skeletons, got them away from\nthere, right in the ovens. Showered us, so you can call the showers. Gave us clean\nstripes. And they would bring forward \u2014 they would talk to \u2014 they would put the best\nlooking guys forward, standing forward, and they would let them talk to somebody.\nHow are you treated? Oh fine, everything is great. Course, if you didn\u2019t say that\n[indecipherable] Red Cross leaves and you know what\u2019s going to happen to you. The\ncamp was swept clean there a \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 this \u2014 the grounds. That\u2019s how it was.\nSo who do you blame? You blame the world, knowing and not listening.",
        "A: Well, let me put you to the people who did their things, okay? You see, I blame the\nworld for not stopping the people who did it to us. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the first ones to\nblame. Now, let\u2019s go to the people that did it to us. Who did it to us? Not just the\nGerman Nazi SS, but the Slovakian Nazi guards, the Croatian Nazi guards, the\nRomanian Nazi guards, the Hungarian Nazi guards. These were all part of it. You\nknow, I had at Auschwitz a number of guar \u2014 Croatian guards who had SS uniforms\non, who were our guards. And these were the animals, these were the killers. They\nwere bigger killers in \u2014 1n a way sometimes than the Nazi Germans killers. I have\ntestified since 1982. \u201982 - \u00b090 - \u201991 - \u00b092 - \u00b093, against Nazis, former Nazi aw \u2014 guards\nand officers at Auschwitz. Out of those, three of them were not Germans. One was a\nLatvian, the one who elected to be deported. The other one, in 1990 I testified in\nHonolulu was a Yugoslavian. One in September I gave deposition on, two year \u2014 three\n\u2014 two years ago, a Slovak, from my country, and the other guy was a German.",
        "A: Well, my own town, who picked me up, who picked up my family? Our owe \u2014 our\nbarber. Our family barber, his name was Martinchek(ph). This the guy who picked us\nup.",
        "A: Yeah, \u201cHitler\u2019s Willing Executioners.\u201d",
        "A: I think it\u2019s one of the best piece of work ever done. Unfortunately it\u2019s written in \u2014\nin such a high college terms, cause this guy is an educator, he\u2019s \u2014 he did his thesis on\nthat, that it\u2019s \u2014 it \u2014 you have to read it twice to understand it, for the average person.\nBut this man did something that was gutsy, that was plain, plain gutsy. He finally said\nsomething that we as survivors hoped somebody would say. It was the average\nGerman, the average person. It was not the hierarchy of the Nazis who did this, it was\nevery German on the street that did this. This was Hitler\u2019s willing executioner. And\nyou couldn\u2019t get a better title in that in a book. It\u2019s th-the \u2014 the writer who wrote it, his\nname is Goldhagen. I\u2019ve got the book, by the way.",
        "A: I would add every member of the Slovakian community on the street for the simple\nreason, why did the Slovak did it here? The Nazis told them, get rid of the Jews, you\nknow what\u2019s gonna happen? You\u2019re going to get their businesses, you\u2019re going to get\ntheir homes, you\u2019re going to get their monies. Now they got greed and \u2014 and anti-\nSemitism they had to begin with. They need \u2014 they didn\u2019t need \u2014 they didn\u2019t need\nmuch pushing and shoving. The \u2014 wh-who put me in the cattle cars? Wasn\u2019t the Nazis.\nI never seen a Nazi put me in the cattle car. Was \u2014 was the Slovak guards who, with\nhis wife \u2014 with his rifle butts and \u2014 and bayonets that start sticking into you, shoving\nyou into the cattle cars. Goodbye Jews. These were their famous words, they were the\n\u2014 they would all say goodbye Jews, good riddance. The guy who took my father\u2019s\nbusiness became a Nazi. This \u2014 this [indecipherable] Martinchek(ph) who was a\nbarber, he took another guy\u2019s name, Benow(ph), Desdair(ph) Benow\u2019s(ph) business,\nhe \u2014 he worked for him before, now he\u2019s got his business. He put him in the oven \u2014 in-\ninto the \u2014 into the cattle cars. So these were there. Neilosh(ph) in Hungary, the same\ntype of Nazis, and Romania had them. Yugoslavia had all the Croats. Franjo\nTrudman, th-the president of Croatia 1-is a big shot. He was invited to come to the\nopening of the Holocaust Museum, I almost died, I almost \u2014 almost \u2014 pardon the\nexpression, threw up when I\u2019ve seen him. Here comes a Croatian, I don\u2019t care how\nyoung he is, but his father was a Nazi and so is he and they\u2019re bringing him to the\nopening of the Holocaust Museum in Washington. He had no business there. He\ncertainly was not a Righteous Gentile. These were the \u2014 these were the \u2014 these were\nthe Hitler\u2019s willing executioner, not only in Germany, but in Poland, in Ukraine, in\nSlovakia. Every eur \u2014 Nazi European country wa-wa \u2014 wa \u2014 these people collaborated\nwith the Nazis. Slovakia became a fascist country. We had a president, who was he?\nJosef Tiso, a Catholic pis \u2014 a priest. Very close to my hometown, that\u2019s where he\ncame from. Anti-Semite. Jews the Christ killers.",
        "A: No. No. In spite of all that, I don\u2019t hate.

They brought a few of these bigwigs into the trial, pe\n\u2014 few of them, nicht schuldig, not guilty, hm? Well, my dear friend, where was the\nrest of the world, of the Nazi world, that wasn\u2019t tried? What happened to the Nazi\nguards, to the Nazi officers who ran these over a hundred concentration camps and\ndeath camps? Where are they? Living the life of Riley, if they\u2019re still alive today,\nwhich mo \u2014 a lot of them are. What happened to them? Absolutely nothing. In the\nSoviet prison they were mistreated, were beaten, sometimes they were starved,\nwhatever, big deal. By the Americans? A slap on the wrist, two months in prison,\nreleased, go back home. Nothing happened to them. They were never on trial. These\nwere the killers, these were \u2014 they should have been on trial. The-These few people\nthey had lined up the Nuremberg trials, the few hotshots, the few Nazi leaders, that\u2019s\nnothing. They did nothing. United States should be ashamed for even pe-performing\nthat trial over there. That was an \u2014 absolutely a farce, nothing to it. The words of my\ncaptain, Chesskey(ph), we didn\u2019t come here to make a concentration camp, we came\nhere to bring democracy. Beautiful, bring democracy.

You know, I testified against a guy named ha \u2014\nHanscun(ph) \u2014 Heinrich Hans Kunneman(ph) in Germany, in Dussberg, Germany\nin \u00b091 - \u201992 and \u201993, three times. Actually five times, because two times here, also, you\nknow, at the \u2014 at the German \u2014 at the German consulates in Chicago and Detroit. Here\nis aman who was in charge of \u2014 of the counter-commando, one of the counter-\ncommando pris \u2014 Nazis, in front of my eyes murdered a little boy about six years old.\nHow did he murder him? We were unloading a transport of Jews coming into\nAuschwitz. This little boy is sitting inside a cattle car crying. Hans Kunneman(ph) ha\n\u2014 his name is Heinrich, Hans Kunneman(ph) tells me, go pick up that Jew. Pick up\nthe little boy, set him down, kid is still crying. Kunneman(ph) walks by the kid\nbecause he starts to stop him from crying. With his boot he kicks the kid in the head\nand kills him right there on the spot. Little, little shaver, little kid. Ta \u2014 tells me to pick\nup the sack of Jewish shit and \u2014 and bring him to the rest of the people. There I am\ncarrying the limp body of his little boy. Hans Kunneman(ph) was then already\ntraining to be an opera singer, okay? As he walks away from killing the je \u2014 little\nJewish boy, he is whistling an operatic tune. Singing and whistling an operatic tune\nlike nothing happened. 90 \u2014 in 1990 I got a call from Germany from a prosecutor. I\u2019ve\ngot your name from such and such person, would you be willing to give us a testimony\nagains \u2014 against a former Nazi. Didn\u2019t tell me who. Course we meet in Chicago at the\nger \u2014 German consulate \u2014 the German consulate on Michigan Avenue, so when? It\u2019s\nlike day after Thanksgiving. So I go over there for Chicago, they bought me a flight\nticket or whatever, I\u2019m in a hotel and I get there. I testify all day, from nine o\u2019clock in\nthe morning to break for lunch, til six o\u2019clock in the evening. He opens up a book of\nphotographs then, not today, then photographs with the uniforms and everything on.\nIdentify this man on three different photographs, plus three other Nazis who also\nworked in the same position. Then I was taken to Germany following summer with\nmy wife. Identified them over there just as easy. This a \u2014 this was a tribunal. Eight\njudge tribunal, not a\u2014 not a\u2014 a\u2014a jury trial. I had a interpreter, and the \u2014 and the\nGerman attorney sitting next to me. There was Kunneman(ph) sitting, he had a court\nappointed doctor with him, he claimed to be very sick, and these eight judges. And I\u2019m\ntestifying and testifying. And I was asked, the third time I testified, what would you\nlike that should happen, you know, cause otherwi \u2014 I knew I testi \u2014 because there was\nother people testifying. But they brought 17 guys to testify against him. 17 former\nprisoners. Not one of us meet each other \u2014 met each other. You came on the Saturday,\nstayed for three days and then you went to court, then you left, then the other guys\ncame on a Saturday. One guy at a time. So I was asked by one of the judges, how\nwould I \u2014 what would \u2014 what would I feel that should happen here? After all, with\nyour testimony the man should be sentenced. Well, I said, I really don\u2019t care if you\nsentence him. I just want one thing from you people. If this man will be willing to do\nwhat I\u2019m doing. I speak about my experiences as a Holocaust survivor. I go to\ncolleges, universities, high schools, civic, religious organizations. Let him come with\nme. Let him tell his \u2014 his story about what he did in Auschwitz for the 18 months that\nI knew him on the ramps. For the 18 months that he would direct people, select people\nto the gas chambers or to slave labor. Let him tell what he did and I\u2019Il tell mals \u2014 my\nstory. The two of us together. That would be enough of a sentence for me. And that\u2019s\nthe kind of sentence I was hoping the masses of the Nazis would get. The masses, in\nevery German community. They should be taken to court with so \u2014 Holocaust\nsurvivors to be there and talk about it and tell them and force them to \u2014 to admit that\nnot I followed orders like \u2014 like I was told, to do \u2014 what to do, I only \u2014 even\nEichmann in 1961, what he said in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in Israel? I followed orders. Well, tell\nme why did you followed orders? You tell this to your community, in front of a\nsurvivor who is mentally and physically able to testify. That is what I am saying them\n\u2014 should happen to the masses. Not once of all these times I testified did I walk out of\nthe courtrooms with a lighter heart, just satisfied that something was done, because\nthere wasn\u2019t. One damn Nazi in Honolulu called me a liar. He was being tried, he\ncalled me a liar. He admitted being on the railroad tracks. He admitted walking and\nmarching prisoners from and to slave labor. And that\u2019s what I told, he was a killer and\nhe calls me a liar. And what happened to him? He was deported to Germany. Big\ndeal. I was told that there will be a trial again in Germany, you will be called. This\nwas seven years ago.",
        "A: On the civilization, or on me?",
        "A: Yes, it would have much impact because you see, Holocaust became fashionable\nthe last number of years. It wasn\u2019t fashionable as soon as we got out of there. Took \u2014\nyou know, it took Meryl Streep, with the worst piece of drecky work, worst piece of\ncrappy film, called, \u201cThe Holocaust,\u201d or whatever y-you \u2014 yeah, it\u2019s called \u2014 was\ncalled \u201cThe Holocaust.\u201d It made her a star. It was the worst piece of junk that was\never produced in ho \u2014 it\u2019s Hollywood, you know, it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s a\u2014 it\u2019s a plastic. But\nwhat was good about it? That was \u2014 they had two, two things. One, the worst film.\nSecond, it had the best thing. It got the attention of the pub \u2014 the general public. Well,\nthis is what the general public now wants today. Holocaust is a very fashionable thing,\nnot only because of Spielberg, because of Shoah, and any \u2014 any piece of \u2014\ndocumentary on Holocaust, true or not true \u2014 I-I shouldn\u2019t say not true, accurate or\nalmost inaccurate, it has some affect on people. Now, Anne Frank has an affect on\npeople. These guys would have a big affect if they would go to colleges and\nuniversities, schools and civic and religious organizations. Oh yeah, lot of s \u2014 lot of\nour population wouldn\u2019t want to hear that. They won\u2019t listen to it. Not because they\ndon\u2019t want to hear, but because they don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u2014 that should be done. I-In\nGermany nobody wanted to do it. Listen, his book, hi \u2014 \u201cHitler\u2019s Willing\nExecutioners\u201d was the biggest seller in Germany. He drew more crowd in Germany\nwhen he was lecturing there, and there was boycotts there. Yet, this is what the people\nshould hear. You know, pretty soon there won\u2019t be any survivors left. We\u2019re getting to\nbe old people. Now, I\u2019m not \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I consider myself still one of the younger guys,\nbut at the same time, every day you got less and less \u2014 there\u2019s less and less of us\naround. A-A-Auschwitz will only be a legend. Now who\u2019s gonna \u2014 other than the\nHolocaust Museum which I\u2019m doing today, which I did in 1989 for the Holocaust\nMuseum, who 1s going to be here? Just this. There won\u2019t be a living person to be able\nto say things like I say, or like other survivors who are capable of talking. So these\nguys should go out there and do that. And let me tell you, they would have a great\naudience. Very \u2014 there are so many people that are hungry to know why it happened,\nbecause ho \u2014 there are not that many of us that go to schools and colleges and\nuniversities. You know, some of us are getting so old that we \u2014 we \u2014 we fantasize. You\nknow, some people fantasize and I get very upset with it, you know. If they don\u2019t\nremember what happened to them, th-the-they say something different. And that\u2019s\nwhat gets me very upset. And that even gots me u \u2014 gets me upset with sp \u2014\nSpielberg\u2019s interviews. I will not be interviewed by Spielberg, no way, no how. But\nlet\u2019s leave that alone.",
        "A: Yeah, til 10 years. I mean, the bi \u2014 1t wasn\u2019t \u2014 well, it became fashion \u2014 the\nHolocaust became fashionable. I call it the fashionable time for the Holocaust.",
        "A: Well, anything done in Hollywood, to me, got me upset, including Simon\nWiesenthal\u2019s story, when he was \u2014 did some \u2014 Simon Wiesenthal did some stuff.\nAnd I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m very disturbed with Simon Wiesenthal\u2019s presentation of the \u2014 of the\ntelevision movies. It didn\u2019t happen like that, number one and then it\u2019s a fantasizing\nthere a little bit. I\u2019ve seen these rubber blown up bodies being taken in Mauthausen\nconcen \u2014 Mauthausen concentration camp, which is wrong, totally wrong, you don\u2019t\ndo these things. You want to do something? Make a documentary. Documentary which\n\u2014 which you know how to do. The best ever film on Holocaust was \u201cThe Shoah.\u201d The\neight and a half hour program by Lanzmann, the Frenchman who did it. This was a\npiece of work that is the best. Other than that, I haven\u2019t seen very li \u2014 I\u2019ve seen very\nlittle that I would recommend. Oh yeah, the people will watch it \u2014 which I\u2019m glad\nthey\u2019re watching, because it [indecipherable] gets the attention. But a Spielberg\nmovie? When I first found out that Steven Spielberg is going to make the Schindler\nstor \u2014 \u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\u201d at first I was wondering. I says, here is a guy who Is going\nto make a Holocaust movie. He is a man who made \u201cE.T,\u201d what is he going to do with\nthe Holocaust? You know, he\u2019s got Indiana Jones and \u201cE.T.\u201d Well, when the \u2014\n\u2018\u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d came to town, here to Indianapolis, I was invited as a Holocaust\nsurvivor to be there for special presentations, and I went. Here comes the elite Jewish\ncommunity of Indianapolis, some of the elite guys, some of the big givers, what do\nyou call, they come there. Everyone\u2019s got a popcorn in their \u2014 bag in their hand, puts\ntheir feet on \u2014 on \u2014 on the other seat and stretch themselves, I hope there\u2019s a \u2014 there 1s\na nice popcorn movie tos \u2014 to watch. So here I am listening, watching, and watching\nbecause [indecipherable] what \u2014 what this guy could do, what he did with it. And I\nwalked out of there really almost satisfied that he did a good job. If he\u2019d shown any\nmore atrocities than he showed in the film, I don\u2019t think people could have sit through\nit. Some of it was a little schmaltzy. I was a little bit \u2014 you know, I watched it so\nclosely. When Oskar Schindler said at the end, I should have done more, I should\nhave done this, I should have that, I \u2014 I\u2019d\u2014I didn\u2019t do enough, I should have saved\nmore people, those words, well that was a little schmaltzy to me, you know. Th-That \u2014\nthat \u2014 that they could have left out. Yes, Oskar Schindler did help. There\u2019s 5,000\nsurvivors of that group that are alive today because of him. You know, 5,000 members\nof the families that came la \u2014 after. So that \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 1t was fairly \u2014 done fairly decent.\nBut the other ones, I don\u2019t remember of any other one, other than Sobibor, \u201cEscape\nFrom Sobibor,\u201d I\u2019m sorry, that was done because they found people that survived\nSobibor and these were the people that helped, same as Oskar Schindler got the \u2014 got\nthe book from a \u2014 from a \u2014 from the luggage store in \u2014 in L.A. and here\u2019s these guys\nfrom th \u2014 Long Island, New York who were Sobibor survivors, they helped with the\nmovie. Well, that was almost \u2014 pretty accurate. But other than that, there is nothing.\nAbsolutely nothing. Kirk Douglas was in the movie one time, and I \u2014 I tell you\nsomething, I \u2014I was going to go over there and kick the hell out of him for that movie.\nBut if \u2014 but you di \u2014 what it 1s, the American public. They eat it up. They listen to it,\nthey want to know. See, I\u2019d \u2014I\u2014I become like a \u2014 like \u2014 like a Mattel toy, somebody\nwind you up and you keep going. Because all of a sudden they said, oh you \u2014\nHolocaust? Call Mike Vogel. All right, so th - Mike Vogel, ah \u2014 wind you up, send\nyou to the school. You know, that type of stuff. \u2019ve got enough here to write a book\njust \u2014 just for the letters I'd received from universities, colleges, civic and religious\norganizations, just \u2014 just the letters that they talk about my \u2014 my being there.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: It\u2019s a very good question. You know, although the story is the same, it\u2019s not the\nsame. Like some \u2014 some \u2014 on many occasions, many places, comes out \u2014 you know,\nstarts out a little different. It depends. Lot of time I\u2019m looking at the audience. I \u2014 the\nstories \u2014 I\u2014 I can\u2019t change the stories, I can\u2019t exchange my style of it, I \u2014 but I tell it,\nbut sometime it\u2019s much stronger, or sometime it\u2019s a little weaker, depending on the\naudience. But it\u2019s not \u2014 I don\u2019t feel it repetitious. I tell it from day one, before, during\nand after the Holocaust. And \u2014 an-and it\u2019s not a routine. It always like a new story, if\nyou know what I\u2019m saying. And when it becomes even more interesting, it depends on\nthe audience, their questions. When their questions come, and when you talk to\ngraduate students, when you talk to clergy, when you talk to people that are really\nknowledgeable, that \u2014 that some are even scholars, a-and book writers, then it becomes\neven more powerful. You gotta remember, when I\u2019m speaking to high school students,\nI don\u2019t get the same questions from high school kids that I get from a graduate student.\nSo it becomes more powerful. And a lot of times it\u2019s surprising, some of these private\nschools, like high schools and even middle schools, ask a better question than some of\nthe college students.",

        "A: No. When they uprooted us nighttime from the barracks, Kanada commando was\ndissolved already. There were no more transports coming in. This is October 1944. We\nthought for sure that they\u2019re taking us to the gas chambers because we\u2019ve seen so\nmuch, number one. Of course we didn\u2019t know that \u2014 we thought we were the last Jews\nalive to begin with. Now, here we go to the railroad tracks, and there are cattle cars\nwaiting for us. And guards went with us, some of the guards went with us, only up to\nthe camp, and then that is the last time we\u2019ve seen them. We n \u2014 did not know what we\ngoing. Now we come to Sachsenhausen, and there is no room for us in\nSachsenhausen in the barracks, because there\u2019s more prisoners in \u2014 everybody is on\nthe street of the camp, not knowing where I \u2014 why and what. We find out from the\nother prisoners who came a little after us, that the Russians are already very close to\npole \u2014 they are in Poland now. They could hear \u2014 hear the shots and that\u2019s why they\nwere taken away from there. So now we found out why. And then, of course,\nSachsenhausen is very close to Berlin. The Americans and the British were bombing\nBerlin like crazy. And yet, there were still killings.",

They \u2014 we figure they\ncleared some \u2014 some wooded area, shoot us and that\u2019s the end of us. First we thought,\nif they make a left turn as we marching, gas chambers. But they didn\u2019t make a left\nturn, where we going? Pe \u2014 cattle cars. Now we come to sa \u2014 Sachsenhausen. We\ndon\u2019t know what we doing here.

Sydler(ph) ended up in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia. Buchler went\nback to our hometown, which 1s called Topol\u2019\u20acany. Buchler and his nephew, and \u2014\nand his sister, some \u2014 some of them that survived, ended up in 1948 in Israel. In 1981\nmy wife Agnes and I went to the first gathering of Holocaust survivors in Israel, June\n11\", 1981. I did not see Buchler, I spoke to him on the phone. He, for some reason\ncouldn\u2019t make it, he was not feeling well, and we were talking. That\u2019s the last time I\nspoke to him and then he died in \u201985. However, his nephew, whose name is Robert, or\nYehasure(ph) Buchler became a historian, went to schools, and as a matter of fact, I\njust seen him last week in Israel. I\u2019ve got a book here with me which 1s in Slovak\nabout our hometown. Every member of that community of my city 1s \u2014 that was\nmurdered by the Nazis, including my family, is listed in this book. The other man,\nSydler(ph) ended up in Bratislava, worked there for awhile. I\u2019ve got letters from him\nat home now. He \u2014 only thing he wanted to do, we should meet and go together back\nto Auschwitz and then go and beat every Pollack in the \u2014 in \u2014 in the streets. That\u2019s\nwhat he writes in the Slovak letter. And unfortunately, he wasn\u2019t well when he left\nAuschwitz. He \u2014 he was quite ill, and he died quite young. I would say he died before\n1970. Oh, hell yes, before 1970 because in 1964, I \u2014 I lived in Michigan City, that\u2019s\nthe last I heard from him. Indiana. And so, he died there, in Bratislava.",
        "A: Well, you see, if you showed weakness to the Nazis, they liked that. They killed\nyou for \u2014 for it even easier. But if you showed that you were \u2014 still had a little \u2014 little\ngutsy strength in you, they \u2014 they respected that a little better, if you can call it respect.\nYou know, they \u2014 the \u2014 this guy I testified against, Hans Kunneman(ph), Heinrich\nKunneman(ph), he had the expression, when he would see you after so many weeks,\nafter week he sees you, you\u2019re still alive, you\u2019re still working, you\u2019re still striving, he\nwould greet you, Du alter bandit, du lebs noch. You old bandit, are you still alive?\nAnd he said it with such a respect that you still fought the system, that you still\nsurvived the system, see? So, if you showed crying, you might as well lay down and\ndie. I couldn\u2019t cry for my father. First time I was able to cry for him, it was January 27,\n1985, when I took my two children with me, when I showed them the window which I\nseen my fa\u2014 my father from \u2014 through, on the barrack that he was taken. Took me a\nlong time. When I said Kaddish over there for my father in front of that window, that\u2019s\nwhen I broke down and cried for him.",

Now, here\u2019s why I\ncried last week in Israel. I was asked by the Jewish Welfare Federation of\nIndianapolis, when we go to the \u2014 with the family mission to Israel, when we get to\nYad Vashem, the Holocaust Memorial, would I be willing to address my group, the\nfellow \u2014 fellow \u2014 the travelers with me, at Yad Vashem, and I agreed to do so. Not\nonly did I address them, but I also got my friend, this Buchler, the historian to meet\nme there, he teaches there at the \u2014 at the Holocaust memorial. And he told the group\nhow I saved his life at Auschwitz, and that mi \u2014 made \u2014 made me \u2014 well, I broke down\nand cried.

As you were carrying the bundles\nof clothing to the women prisoners who did the cleaning and disinfecting of the\nclothes, and all of a sudden the cane crook \u2014 the handle of the cane is behind your\nneck, and your neck and he pulls you down, he drops you, you drop your bundle and\nhe pokes with that stick in the \u2014 1n there, in the clothes and he finds some food and he\n\u2014 before you even turn around he smacks you right over the head with the cane, and he\nwould ask, to what Jewish sow are you taking this? And of course, if you tell, the\nJewish girl is in trouble. If you don\u2019t tell, bend over, 25 on your behind. And you got\nto count. You count and he stops you. How many did I give you? 17. Wrong, all over\nagain. By the time he st-starts all over again you already fainted, you\u2019re already gone.\nSo those are the things. I\u2019ve got marks on my \u2014 on my \u2014 below my belt now which\nnever will go away. I\u2019ve got a mark on my neck right here from a shovel by a Nazi.\nThey didn\u2019t \u2014 life meant nothing to them.",
        "A: Tell her that\u2019s a very good question. The work that we did, the Kanada commando,\nunloading incoming Jews and then, after the Nazis sorted them, selected them, you die\nnow, you die later, then we start working with the belongings, with the artifacts. And\namong the artifacts is all sorts of watches, diamonds, rings, jewelry, because that was\nall confiscated. There were boxes for this merchandise, for these items. And the Nazis\nwould march back and forth, back and forth. They were not allowed to bend down and\npick anything up. But a Nazi would see a watch and he tells you, take that watch and\ntake it to the latrine with you. And he would march you \u2014 with you \u2014 behind you\ntowards the men\u2019s latrine. And you squat, as you got this watch in your pocket and you\nthrow it to him on the ground. He takes off his rifle and with his rifle head he picks up\nthe piece. So he\u2019s good to you for \u2014 for a day or so. But as far as compassion, as far as\nany feeling towards you, the only compassion feeling if they could benefit, because\nthey cou \u2014 they \u2014 they were all on the take. They all knew how. Everyone \u2014 every Nazi\nhad their own prisoners who would organize for them. So they took care of you for\nawhile. But if he sees his superior coming towards you, regardless of what you gave\nhim, he beat you just the same. So the compassion wasn\u2019t there. They had no\ncompassion, none whatsoever. Yeah, there were some people that \u2014 I know of \u2014 of a\nguy who knew a Nazi from his hometown, and he was the worst animal to him. So\nthere\u2019s \u2014 there was s \u2014 there was some of them that would throw me a piece of bread\nonly because you dealt with them, only because you gave them something. And they\nlet you organize. They turned their backs so you could eat. You know, turn their head\nand \u2014 and \u2014 an-and \u2014 and \u2014 and turn your \u2014 turn away so they couldn\u2019t \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t\nsee it, because if they seen it, they have to beat you. They knew we were eating,\nbecause they needed our hands at the railroad tracks.",
        "A: What side?",
        "A: Just in the trials. No-Not directly to them, through their attorneys, yes. We accuse\nthem of \u2014 of things that they did. As far as per \u2014 one on one, no, never met anyone. I\nmay have met some, but I did \u2014 you know, may have been one, but I didn\u2019t know who\nthey were, you know.",
        "A: Yes, definitely would. And I wouldn\u2019t do it with hate. I wouldn\u2019t do it with hate.\nConversation. I was asked to go on a program once and \u2014 and \u2014 with \u2014 with these \u2014 the\nhate group, you know \u2014",

        "A: Ruby Ridge, and \u2014 and a \u2014 and a clan guy to go \u2014 are you nuts? I want to go on that\nprogram with these animals? First of all I wouldn\u2019t go on his show. Geraldo Rivera is\nnot my person. That\u2019s not my kind of show, not my kind of people. And he\u2019s half\nJewish, too.",
        "A: No, that\u2019s not me, no. But I would go one on one, or I would go two on one. I\u2019Il be\none, they\u2019ll be two. Let their t-tell their story. Let me tell you \u2014 this may not come \u2014\nthis has nothing to do with this question. I have a friend who is a president of PBS in\nRichmond, Virginia, okay? He name is Charles Sidna(ph), Jr., historian on Nazism.\nWrote a couple of books on SS. I met him the first time in 1990 in Honolulu. Last\nOctober he went to Germany and Austria with a number of historians for his ta \u2014\nconference on Nazi German \u2014 Nazi German Wehrmacht from 1941 to 1945. Among\nthem was also an SS guard, SS person who a \u2014 who was in there with him in the\ngroup. And here they are, they \u2014 there was a exhibit traveling to Germany, and there\nwas very much \u2014 a lot of protest against that exhibit in Germany. But they were there\nand talking, each one had their own \u2014 own \u2014 the work. You know, one \u2014 one was on\nthe Greek Jews, one was on \u2014",
        "A: Special \u2014 sp \u2014 oh \u2014 own specialty, see, thanks. Also there was an Israeli boy who I\nmet last week, my \u2014 from my hometown. He too was there, okay? He is a historian\nfrom Israel. So he was the only Jew, there was a guy from Czech Republic, there was\na guy from Poland, there was a guy from Austria, there was number of ca \u2014 people\nfrom Germany, and they were talking. And they were demonstrating against him.\nSome German took a canister of salt and threw it through the window ins \u2014 1n the\nbuilding with a sign, here is your Zyklon B gas. That\u2019s \u2014 that happened last fall, okay?\nSo my friend from Richmond, Virginia, the president of PBS, who made a film on\nme by the way, called \u201c65316\u201d and c \u2014 he calls me up and tells me what happened,\nand he also told me that he was there with an Israeli guy and he asked him where he 1s\nfrom, he told him from Slovakia and from where, from the s \u2014 my hometown. And he\nsays to him, I know a guy from that town, too \u2014 my friend from Richmond told him.\nHe says, he lives in the States. So the guy says, I know who, Mike Vogel. Mike Vogel\nsaved my life at Auschwitz. That\u2019s the guy I told you about. So here\u2019s a guy, pitches\nsalt, grain of salt like Zyklon B gas into these people. So you see, Nazism, some of\nthese animals, when \u2014 when someone shows, \u201cHitler\u2019s Willing Executioners,\u201d or\nsomeone goes there for this type of a purpose, they\u2019re still fighting it. They never\nadmit.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Absolutely. I meet younger Germans not only in Germany, but I also meet them\nhere, in this country. Students, c-college students, graduate students. And the question\nalways comes, do I hate all Germans? Well, I said, I don\u2019t hate all Germans. However,\nall Germans my age and older, and some even younger were responsible for the\natrocities that happened to us, that \u2014 that was done to us. Even if they themselves did \u2014\nwere not involved in throwing us into the ovens, but they were part of the process, part\nof the organization, part of the hate, part of the people that killed us. However you, as\na young German, I can\u2019t hold you responsible for the atrocity that happened to us \u2014\ndone to us by a\u2014 by your grandparents. But when you go back home, ask your parents,\nif they were old enough, or your grandparents, what did they do from 1933 to 1945?\nWhat did they do to stop the atrocities? What did they do to stop Kristallnacht? What\ndid they do to stop deportation? What did they do to stop taking away Jewish shops\nand Jewish businesses? What did they do to burn Jewish temples? This is what you got\nto ask their parents, your parents and grandparents. But as far as hating you, I don\u2019t\neven hate your parents, let alone you.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You know, I never thought about that, but I probably would have been the same as\nthe rest of them. I probably would have been same as the rest of them, because it was\ninbred in them. It would be inbred in me \u2014 inbred-ed in me, because as much as these\nSlovaks or Hungarians or Poles worked with Jews, worked for Jews or benefited by\nJews or whatever, they were partners with them, or they were \u2014 they were part of their\noperation, they all were anti-Semites. And I probably would have been one of them. I\ngrew up init. You know, I referee soccer in Indianapolis in the state of Indiana.\nThere\u2019s a German man named Hans Gut, came to this country in the 50\u2019s with his\nfather. And Hans 1s in his 50\u2019s now, or better. \u201cAuschwitz, If You Cried You Died,\u201d\nwas showing the first time in Indianapolis. It was shown nationally, but 1t was shown\nin Indianapolis that time, too. I went to do a high school soccer game and Hans Gut\nwas also one of their \u2014 one of \u2014 we were three referee \u2014 three \u2014 three people. There\u2019s\ntwo linesmen and a \u2014 and a \u2014 and a referee. And I was scheduled to do the game and\nHans is getting out of his car and I\u2019m getting out of my car from the park \u2014 school\nparking lot, we walked to the soccer field. And Hans Gut says to me, Mike, I\u2019ve seen\nyour film last night. But don\u2019t you think it\u2019s about time to stop this? Isn\u2019t that enough\nof blasting, basting the Germans, of constantly \u2014 constantly \u2014 he says to me, my father\nwas also in the Russian front. He says, he wa \u2014 he too suffered. I said, well Hans, let\nme tell you a little bit about my father. Your father was in Russian front. He had the\nguns, ammunition, clothes, boots. He was dressed. My father was stripped naked,\nstripped from his dignity, totally dehumanized, taken to the gas chambers, starved \u2014\nfirst starved, tortured. I said, my father didn\u2019t have a gun to turn around and shoot his \u2014\nshoot people who were putting him in the ovens. Your father didn\u2019t have to join the\narmy. My father was forced into go in the concentration camp and be killed. So what\nare you giving me this bullcrap about your father? So you see, people don\u2019t want to\nsee, the people don\u2019t want to hear. And especially German people.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",

        "A: That\u2019s possible.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Mm, well, he\u2019s right. Not too many did it, cause if there were so many Righteous\nGentiles, why else \u2014 if there were so many, why so many of us died, why so many was\nkilled. Let me tell you my own personal experiment \u2014 experience with what you just\nasked me. First part of 1942, I was in a slave labor camp in Slovakia called Novaky.\nThere was a good friend of mine whose name was Josef Knap(ph), Kanap(ph) in\nSlovak, Knap(ph). Josef Knap(ph) had a Christian girlfriend, name was Terri(ph) \u2014\nTherese \u2014 ter \u2014 terra \u2014 terries \u2014 Th-Therese. Him and I escaped together from\nNovaky. He knew his way pretty well, he was about a year and a half older than me.\nWe get to our hometown, Topol\u2019\u20acany, his \u2014 her father had a small farm on the\noutskirts of our city and we two boys, escapees, going the back doors, back ways so\nwe will get picked up by this \u2014 by the gendarmes, by the police of our town. Came to\nthis house hoping that I would be able to hide there too. Well, the father of the girl,\nfather of Therese, the father said, I\u2019m taking Josef in my house and hide him, but I\u2019m\nnot taking a chance with two Jews in my house. And here I am, stuck out on the\noutskirt of our town, got picked up by police as I was walking back to town, beat the\nhell out of me, send me back to Novaky. In 1946 I went back to Slovakia wi \u2014 through\nthe army because I went to get my papers and those two are still married, of course,\nthey had a child. And she cried. She apologized to me that her father wouldn\u2019t take\nme. Her father died since, but he wouldn\u2019t take me. So \u2014 but as fate would have it, I\nsurvived, she says, so at least I came to see them. Josef Knap(ph) died, let\u2019s see, 1990\nI was in Israel and there was a Czechoslovakian gathering of Holocaust survivors, and\nthere was another Jew \u2014 Jewish person there who travels from \u2014 to my hometown and\nhe told me that he died a few months ago. So the Righteous Gentiles really weren\u2019t\nthat many. As far as the guy said he wouldn\u2019t do it, I believe it, because most people\ndidn\u2019t want to do it. My father had enough Christian friends and people that he dealt\nwith, people that he sold horses and cattle to, that somebody could have saved us.\nNobody was willing.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: It\u2019s guilt, yeah, it\u2019s guilt. You know, people would also pul \u2014 ge \u2014 put guilt \u2014 guilt\non us.",
        "A: When I \u2014 \u201946 when I went to my hometown, was a small Jewish community left\nthat came back, and th \u2014 some that were hidden.

Why \u2014 what \u2014 why should you be\nthe lucky one, and not \u2014 not \u2014 I\u2014 why shouldn\u2019t I have my brother or sister here?

The trial was held in Frankfurt against a former Nazi, and I don\u2019t\nremember which one it was. It was also photograph brought there and there\u2019s a\nphotograph of me in \u2014 taken by the Nazi documentation department. And \u2014 and that\nphotograph was used as evidence.

That was in Germany, and this photograph which I have \u2014 which Kulka by the\nway, gave me in 1981 in Israel, copy of it, this was used as evidence, this photograph,\nidentifying the prisoners that were a \u2014 1n that photographs.

And yet, to the last minute the\nguy didn\u2019t admit to anything. And he was the mastermind of the railroad tracks of the\nca \u2014 of the cattle cars. He was the guy who \u2014 who \u2014 who had another guy, Dieter\nWisliceny who was \u2014 who he \u2014 he sent to Slovakia to \u2014 to get us out of there, who he\nsent to Greece to get the Greek Jews. And \u2014 and \u2014 and this man to the last moment did\nnot admit \u2014 only thing he said, I followed orders. And as far as Eichmann\u2019s capture, it\nwasn\u2019t done because of Simon Wiesenthal, it was done because of the Israeli\nMossad. And Simon Wiesenthal want \u2014 took it \u2014 the credit for that, but it is no longer\nthe credit for \u2014 he doesn\u2019t take it any more, I\u2019m sure of it. Excuse me.",

This 1s my telephone number, this is my house address, which by the\nway, becomes my home \u2014 home address now, because when I bought this house \u2014\nwhen I \u2014 when we were moving here 30 years ago, looking for a home and the real\nestate lady takes me in this neighborhood and I see a address, 6531. My number is\n65316. I said, we\u2019re going to buy this house. My wife says, you gotta be crazy. I says\nwhy? I never \u2014 I \u2014I can never lose my \u2014 if I lose my way I know I got it on my arm,\nyou know, I said \u2014 no, she says, don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t \u2014 let\u2019s not buy this house. I \u2014 so we\nbought it anyway, you know. So that\u2019s a sick sense of humor in me, you know. I\nbought the house only \u2014 not only because it was a good price, but it also had a right\nnumber. So coworkers, yeah, they always ask. Not co \u2014 s-strangers on the street, in a\nrestaurant, when it\u2019s summertime you go there in a short sleeve shirt. They look at you\nfirst and they don\u2019t want to say anything, they\u2019re kind of you know. And what am I\ngonna do, cover it like this? No. So \u2014 you were in one of them camps, huh? Ye \u2014 wa \u2014\nwa \u2014 one of them bad Nazi camps, huh? And I, oh yeah, I says. Could you tell me a\nlittle bit about it? I says no, not in a restaurant, you know. You got children in school, I\nsaid, we have a film over there. Or wa \u2014 you \u2014 ever go here, you can find out. You go\nto the children\u2019s museum, they have s-stuff on the Holocaust, you know. So th-that \u2014\nthat always comes up, always, there isn\u2019t \u2014 I tho \u2014 there isn\u2019t a day when somebody\ndoesn\u2019t stare at you when you have the number exposed. I'll tell you another story. In\n1961 we lived in Cleveland, Ohio. I was working for a company called Shoppers\nFair. I was straightening out a couple of shelves in the store with my sleeves \u2014 short\nsleeve shirt on. A guy walks in, he says, you got number. I know man got number.\nTalks with an accent. I said oh yeah, you do? Okay. I bring him here. Next day he\ndrags in a gu \u2014 brings in a guy, we were together in Auschwitz. This guy\u2019s name was\nMutti(ph) Klein(ph). He worked with my father with the horses at Auschwitz. We\nbecame f\u2014 of course, close friends until we moved to Cleveland, he \u2014 they \u2014 a-and \u2014\nand he eva \u2014 a-a-after awhile he got a heart attack. Then he retired in Florida. In 1990\nwe went to Israel ag-again for the gathering, and he didn't make it because he was ill.\nAnd there I met some people that know him also because they came the same time as\nwe did to Auschwitz. We got home to Indianapolis, we found out a few months later\nhe died. So that was also through his number because the guy seen me at work,\nstocking shelves at Shoppers Fair. So the number 1s always there and always comes\nup in the conversation wherever I go. And when I went to Germany to test \u2014 testify, I\nmade it a point when we were free from court, and we went for train rides and went \u2014\nanywhere we went, I would always [indecipherable] summertime, of course we were\nthere summertime, I would sit there \u2014 and always would like to sit close to an older\nGerman, just to let him see the number. And they would look at you, then they put the\nhead down and never look at you again. Probably couldn't get a \u2014 couldn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t\nwait to get off the next stop. Yeah, the number is there unfortunately and it\u2019ll stay\nthere as long as I live.",
        "A: This was the most \u2014 fir \u2014 first of all it was the first gathering ever, okay? This was\nthe most emotional four or five days we had in Israel. We had a survivor village in \u2014\nin Jerusalem. There were computers set up all over the creation \u2014 all over the place\nand every one of us was listed in the computer, who we were, where we came from.\nAnd this is how I met in person, Eric Kulka. I didn\u2019t know \u2014 first of all, I didn\u2019t know\nEric Kulka. I didn\u2019t know who Eric Kulka was. I get a message at the Hilton\nJerusalem, note Eric Kulka, telephone number. Call up Eric Kulka and he tells me\nwho he 1s. Eric Kulka\u2019s wife was murdered by the Nazis, so what he did, he took his\nwife\u2019s maiden name and changed his name.",
        "A: In \u2014 yeah, 1n \u2014 in tribute for his wife, yeah. He\u2019s got a son who teaches at the\nUniversity of Jerusalem, also a historian and a writer of books. So Eric died, I was\ntold the other day, last week, year and a half ago. Kidney failure. But he was much\nolder than me, Eric was in his late 80\u2019s. I also saved his life, yeah. But Eric was quite\na guy.",
        "A: A number of times, yes.",
        "A: Well, the first time I went there was for the opening when \u2014 when the \u2014 when it was\nthe g \u2014 the grand opening of the Holocaust Museum. That was in April 1993. The\ncoldest, rainiest day you can imagine, it was so cold. And we \u2014 we said, it fits the\noccasion, the oc \u2014 the opening fits the occasion. Three of our kids came with us, two\ndaughters and a son and my wife and I. And I was written up in the U.S. \u2014 the U.S.A.\ntoday in the \u2014 because of the opening. And this was too, very, very emotional. The \u2014\nthe \u2014 the \u2014 the demonstrators, they \u2014 the park police, of course, took care of them after\nawhile. They had demonstrators up to a point and after that they took care of them.\nThe-They blocked them off with buses, they could \u2014 you couldn\u2019t see them any more.\nAnd of course, it was so emotional. But the \u201981 in Israel, that is where I met Kulka\nand met some other people, a couple guys from France who worked with me in the\nKanada commando. And then \u2014 that was the hardest part. That was the \u2014 that was the\nhardest part for me. When at Yad Vashem we heard a first speech by a \u2014 the le \u2014 one\nof the leaders of the group, and man there wasn\u2019t a dry eye in the place. This is when I\nreally cried, when they start talking, my number is such and such. And then you\nwalked through the Yad Vashem Museum where all the photographs of \u2014 original\nphotographs of Nazis that t \u2014 took \u2014 the documentation, Nazi documentation took. As I\nwalked through, I\u2019ve seen the railroad tracks where I worked. And I\u2019ve seen the\nprisoners whom I knew and I point \u2014 could point out who they were. And that broke\nme down. And NPR was there, she interviewed me, a lady interviewed me, I couldn\u2019t\nfinish the interview, that\u2019s how bad I was. That was very, very emotional. And we\nwent \u2014 since then, of course, we went to a few more gathering \u2014 Holocaust gathering. I\nhad the great honor, because of the Holocaust Museum and the Holocaust\norganization, May eighth, this past May eighth, be invited to Washington, D.C. at the\ncapital rotunda to do the Holocaust Memorial Kaddish. So I did May eighth in\nWashington, which was also very beautiful.",

I\u2019m\nstill a little thinking about it, just what am I doing here, but yet I feel I must do it now,\nespecially now. I\u2019m getting older and it\u2019s time to identify myself more, not just by\nname, but also by attending the services, hoping to heal a little different.",
        "A: Yes, I think it\u2019s helping. I think it\u2019s helping because the community knows me so\nwell now and they identify me with this. The Jewish community relations which I am a\nchairman of the Holocaust Committee here in t \u2014 1n our organization, and anytime\nsomething happens, they call on me. At the state capital rotunda here, I was asked to\nspeak, als \u2014 May sixth, two days before Washington. They wanted to also make it\nMay eighth, I said, I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t attend it, you have to get someone else. No, we\ndon\u2019t want someone else, we want you. So we make it on May sixth. So they made it\non May sixth and there too I spoke, and I was asked by the community to do the holoc\n\u2014 to do the Kaddish for the ser-service. So the community is kind of pushing me\ntowards this sort of a making me part of \u2014 the Holocaust Jew to be the spokesperson.\nAny time they need someone, newspapers here, local papers, the television channels \u2014\nthere isn\u2019t a television program on Holocaust that I\u2019m not involved in that they don\u2019t\ncall me. When Shpindler \u2014 \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u2019 was shown, I was asked to be on the\nprogram. Yom HaShoah comes around, the Day of Remembrance, I am asked to be\non programs.

        "A: Well, the hate groups is one of them. You see, the First Amendment in this country\nis a beautiful item, but the First Amendment should stop somewhere. It should stop\nwith these hate groups, it should stop with the \u2014 with the KKK, they shouldn\u2019t have\ntheir rights with the First Amendment, I\u2019m sorry. Neither should have the skinheads\nand the white supremists shouldn\u2019t have that, the racists shouldn\u2019t have that, the anti-\nSemites shouldn\u2019t have that, they shouldn\u2019t have the First Amend \u2014 that should \u2014 that\nhas nothing to do with the First Amendment. You may na \u2014 disagree with me, but\nthese are \u2014 there\u2019s just got to be stop somewhere. Well, here is a guy who has got First\nAmendment rights, he killed 160 people in \u2014 in Oklahoma. This is the First\nAmendment. He shouldn\u2019t be even tried. He should be given to the people in\nOklahoma City and they should take care of it. That\u2019s \u2014 may sound cruel, but look\nhow cruel he was. So these are the fears I have, that because of our freedom in our ri \u2014\nlives, we let all these groups do whatever they want to do and they murder, then we\nput them to death row and they stay there for 15 years and 16 times they say \u2014 th-the\ngovernor says a\u2014a stay of execution and they stay, he goes back there and you feed\nhim and you spend money on him. These \u2014 these are fears I have. I have fears of these\nhate groups. I have fears of all these \u2014 all these anti-Semites, all these racists. You\nknow, this is what \u2014 this is what scares me, this \u2014 this is \u2014 and now wa \u2014 why does it\nscare me so much? Because all you got to have, all you need, God forbid, is bad\neconomy. These are the people that will lead the other middle America, and middle\nAmerica is a na \u2014 dangerous world, believe me. I\u2019ve seen them, I-I\u2019ve seen them in\naction, you know, doing my \u2014 sometime my \u2014 some my speeches, I \u2014 sometime I get\nthese middle Americans in there too. But these are the ones you\u2019ve got to be careful\nwith. The fundamentalists, the middle America. The ones who push the j1 \u2014 push their\nreligions onto you. These are the ones that you worry about. The white \u2014 white\nsupremists, who are they? They come from the churches. What \u2014 lot of them.

Elie Wiesel went to Bosnia some years back and begged the people,\ndon\u2019t do this to your people. Look what happened to us. He went to see th \u2014 some of\nthe prisoners who he could see them through the \u2014 through the elect \u2014 through the\nfences and seen people with this \u2014 like s \u2014 looking like skeletons. But you know,\nthere\u2019s a difference between Holocaust and \u2014 and Bosnia [indecipherable]\nYugoslavia. The difference is all [indecipherable] had guns. They had weapons. They\nwere fighting each other with weapons. Ethnic \u2014 a fa \u2014 wh-what were they fighting\nfor? Religious \u2014 religion ethnicity, for ethnics. And with us, we didn\u2019t have guns or\nammunition [indecipherable] it was different. But at the same time, it was a\nholocaust. Look what they\u2019ve done to a beautiful country, the Yugoslavia. Years\nbefore the winter sports were held in that beautiful part of the world, and now the\nwhole country is ruined. Other than a \u2014 other than Croatia which 1s still in a fairly\ndecent shape. So that was a holocaust. Cambodia, the boat people. Vietnam war was\nanother one. You know, when Vietnam war first started, when it \u2014 when it was first\nstarted in the 60\u2019s, late 60\u2019s, I was for it. I was for the Americans. After all, here is the\nUnited States of America, you \u2014 you know, you go fight, don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t knock the\nsoldiers that are going there. And after awhile, when I listened to my children who\nwere at the time college age, you know, and they were going demonstrating in\nWashington against it, I tried to listen and reason with them. But kids, they\u2019re fighting\nfor freedom. So the kids would tell me, what\u2019s freedom? It\u2019s 10,000 miles \u2014 20 thou \u2014\n10,000 miles away from us, what kind of freedom? They\u2019re killing innocent children\nand women, is that a freedom? So when I first started I was very much for it, then I\nhad to go with my kids. I\u2019ve seen that what they were talking about, they were right.\nMaybe they were too radical about it. Maybe they went overboard, maybe. And some\nof them did. I mean, in spite of the drugs, they brought some \u2014 some good things out\nof it, these young people.\nwas thinking about what happened in Rwanda in the past couple of years, where one\nside basically annihilated the other side.",

Th-They fly \u2014 a plane flew over and \u2014 and\ndropped some food and people were killing each other for the piece of food that they\ncould find. In \u2014 in \u2014 look, Bosnia and Yugoslavia, no one helped five, six years ago\nwhen they should have helped. That\u2019s when they should have stopped right there. This\nis when the help should have come, not today with the sending \u2014 Clinton sends the\narmy over there now\u201d? Now you send the army over there? Send the army there before\nthe first shot was fired. Control it and try to do the Dayton before Dayton. You know\nwhat I\u2019m trying to say? Don\u2019t go to Dayton after every \u2014 after nine million people are\nmurdered. Go there before. Make the Dayton in \u2014 in Yugoslavia, in Croatia, in\nBosnia. This is where you do it. Nobody paid attention. The next door neighbors,\nGermany, the Hitler y \u2014 nobody did anything. When I was there testifying in\nGermany in \u201991, it was still early enough to go there and try to stop all that. They\nwere just trying to start \u2014 starting to shoot. That\u2019s the time to go there, but oh well, we\ncan\u2019t send our sons to be murdered over there. Nobody asked them to be murdered\nover there, nobody is murdered there now. One [indecipherable] the guy got lost in\nthe wooded area someplace, shot down or whatever happened to him and he survived.\nAnd all you had to do was go there, send their armed forces over there and control\nthem, send the UN over there before it happened, not after it happened. So these are\nthe things that should be done. Rwanda the same way. Look \u2014 did you see all these\nstarving little innocent children? Who did they hurt? Same thing like the one and a half\nmillion Jewish children murdered by the Nazis. Poor, innocent children. How many\nprofessors, how many scientists, how many teachers, how many doctors were\nmurdered among these little one and a half million children? The same thing with the\nRwanda people. Maybe they weren\u2019t professors 1n ta \u2014 1-1-1n \u2014 1-1-1n \u2014 but they were\nhuman beings and nobody helped. Everyone turned their head the other way.

I happen to be one of the people, unfortunately the second\nperson that was part of it passed away at a very young age, at the age of 47, an\nEnglishman. The two of us started soccer in the state of Indiana, so to speak. So to\nspeak, no, we \u2014 we used to travel the state to give clinics to coaches and to kids.

And the guests are first asked to come down, e-each\ngiven a number of table where you are sitting and we were asked to sit at a front table.\nAnd when we got there and my wife \u2014 and the guests go down first. Then they\nannounce us one by one, alphabetically order and you shake hands with all these\ndignitaries. And when you come to your table \u2014 when I got to my table the president of\nthe Jefferson Awards, Sam Beard comes up to me and he says, after dinner I would\nlike to speak to you. Well, I didn\u2019t know what he wanted, so little nervous about it, but\nanyway, dinner was over, we come to the hotel and he\u2019s talking to me. He says,\ntomorrow morning we\u2019re going to the United States Supreme Court and I want you to\nbe the closing speaker. I\u2019ll give you three minutes to speak. I got a little nervous. I told\nmy wife, what am I gonna tell them? She says, why don\u2019t you jot something down? I\nsaid, you know how I am with writing. What am I gonna \u2014 you know, I don\u2019t want to\ntell them about the Holocaust too much. So I started writing but I threw it away. Next\nmorning we go to the United States Supreme Court. Sandra Day O\u2019Connor opened\nour session. And Sam Beard was going to introduce me to speak. I was fol \u2014 I\nfollowed Sam Nunn, the guy who was \u2014 was \u2014 founded C-Span and Julian Bond,\nyou know who he 1s? Okay, and Rosalynn Carter. And I followed Rosalynn Carter\n\u2014 Rosalynn Carter, the pr \u2014 former President Carter\u2019s wife. So I gave them a three\nminute speech. That was the greatest honor I could \u2014 anybody could bestow on me,\nspeaking at the United States Supreme Court.",
        "A: Well, it was long way from Slovakia. And I told them, 50 years ago I arrived to\nthis beautiful free country called United States of America from the ashes of\nAuschwitz to life. My parents, my grandparents, my two brothers, my two sisters all\nperished, all de \u2014 murdered, gassed and burned in the largest death factory of all Nazi\nconcentration camp. Yet today, I have a mission. My mission is to speak for the six\nmillion who cannot speak for themselves. Today I speak at colleges, universities, high\nschools, civic and religious organization. Not everyone 1s an anti-Semite in the world.\nNot everyone is a Kurt Waldheim, Marge Schott. Yet, look at me, Mike Miso\nVogel, Jewish boy born in a small village of Slovakia, speaking to you in this great\nplace called United States Supreme Court of America. I thank you for this honor.\nThat was my speech. I \u2014I missed a couple lines, but that was my speech. And I tell\nyou, my wife tells me that everybody cried. So, that was the honor. I had a beautiful\nspeech also at DePauw University. I mise \u2014 I got it here to show you, but \u2014",
        "A: Well, it \u2014 that took awhile also. That took \u2014 took quite awhile before I \u2014 before I\nbelieved or trusted, cause you know, that was not an easy part for me to do. How could\nyou trust after you went through what we went through? How could you have faith in\nso-someone, you know, in someone\u2019s word, but you didn\u2019t, you know \u2014 here in this\ncountry, th-the BS system gets \u2014 gets \u2014 gets in the way, you know, and people tell \u2014\ntells \u2014 tell tales. Yet, I had a hard \u2014 I had a hard time with trusting. I trusted my wife\nand children, but I was afraid to trust someone else. So that took a long time. Today I\ncan tell by a person\u2019s handshake. When the guy looks in your eyes when he shakes\nyour hand and he shakes it like he means it, not like a dead fish, you can almost say\nthat here is a guy who 1s halfway decent and honest. So I had a hard time with trusting.\nFaith and trust was a hard thing for me, hard thing.",
        "A: No problem, none whatsoever. None whatsoever. I-I have a tremendous sense of\nhumor, I tell jokes about ra \u2014 not racial, I\u2019m talking about ethnic jokes, to me that\u2019s \u2014 I\ntell them all the time. But I have no problem with Gentiles.",
        "A: Oh, when I first came over? Well, I first came over to Detroit, we lived in a Jewish\nneighborhood. So only Gentiles I met was in the business world, wa \u2014 you know, in\nthe store that I worked in. So I didn\u2019t have too much outside of my business life to do\nwith the Gentiles. But now, today, I have no problem with them. I \u2014 I work with them,\nI \u2014I play soccer with them, against them, and they all respect me, I respect them. I\nhave no problem whatsoever.",
        "A: No, no \u2014",
        "A: \u2014no, no, not in this country, not at all.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I have no desire, none whatsoever. I don\u2019t want ever to step in that Slovakian town\nthat I came from. And people tell me I\u2019m crazy, that I should do it, I should see what\nit\u2019s going on. A friend of mine who just gave me the book I told you about, he just\ncame from there. It was just before \u2014 when we got to Israel he \u2014 day before we got\nthere he got home from there. And it used to be a 14,000 dollar \u2014 14,000 population is\nnow 40,000. And he said there are no Jews there, of course, and th-there are no Jews\nleft in Slovakia, I mean sla \u2014 any Jew who would live there would be crazy. But I have\nno desire to go there, no. I went to Prague, but not \u2014 not to Slovakia. I went to the\nCzech Republic which was then still Czechoslovakia, but I have no desire. I don\u2019t\nwant to see a Slovak. I understand your mom comes from that world, but \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s her ma \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 her parents, yeah.",
        "A: None.",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "A: No, ba \u2014 something burning? No, nothing.",
        "A: Well, let me tell you. Then I was such a strong American believer, so strong anti-\ncommunist, cause I knew what that was, communism, that I almost went along with\nthat \u2014 that program and \u2014 and \u2014 almost. But then, of course, when I heard the way Joe\nMcCarthy was handling the \u2014 it was on \u2014 televised in those days, you know, and I just\ncouldn\u2019t \u2014 this guy was a hate monger. And I considered him worse than the Nazis\nafter I\u2019ve se \u2014 after I seen him for awhile. At first I said, he\u2019s fighting communists, it\u2019s\ngood. Hoover is fighting communists too, that\u2019s good. But neither one of these guys\nwere good a \u2014 good Americans, so to speak, because they were hate mongers. Hoover,\nwhat did he do? He went after the wrong people all the time, you know. Martin\nLuther King. What did he want from Martin Luther King? Here was a man who\nwas a peaceful demonstrator. He pi \u2014 th \u2014 he th \u2014 he never wanted to throw a rock on\nanybody, he didn\u2019t do any of that, he was very peaceful. He put him to jail, he put him\nto jail, and he was nicely quiet, with his good voice, telling the world what it\u2019s all\nabout. McCarthy was just as bad as the Nazis. He went after people whom he\nconsider \u2014 whom he \u2014 whom he accused of being a communist. He took so many lives\naway from people \u2014 so many livelihoods away from people in \u2014 in \u2014 in those years. He\nwas the \u2014 one of the worst thing \u2014 he was an animal.\nsee \u2014 I mean, there were some similarities it \u2014 1t seems, 1n retrospect with the\ntechniques used to accuse people and \u2014 and you know, neighbors against neighbors\nand \u2014",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: Mm-hm, yup, yup. I\u2019d w \u2014 it frightened me, because it was similar like what\nhappened \u2014 here \u2014 here 1s a Jew living, here is a \u2014 you know, they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re telling\non people, or how to catch people, telling on your neighbors to save your own skin.",
        "A: Yeah, well, that\u2019s right. We\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll \u2014 well, your okay, but you tell me e-\neverything about the other people and your \u2014 your \u2014 you\u2019re a free man. And that\u2019s \u2014\nthat\u2019s what McCarthyism was.",
        "A: No, not really. I knew \u2014 I knew someone in Binghamton, New York when we\nlived there that he was falsely accused \u2014 she was falsely accused. She went once to a \u2014\na communist meeting with her \u2014 one of her friends and they accused her of being a\nmember. This was during the McCarthy era. But of course did \u2014 nothing happened to\nher. And he \u2014 her husband was working for GE at the time as an engineer and they\ncould have gotten in trouble, you know, he could have lost his job.",
        "A: Lot of Jews involved.",
        "A: Labor and actors, and \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 academia, yeah.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: It was the \u2014 the Workmen Society was another one, Jewish group, Workmen\nSociety and they all called them communists, because it\u2019s a Workmen Society.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Well actually I wasn\u2019t. No, I wasn\u2019t.",
        "A: In the 20\u2019s.",
        "A: Yeah, I wasn\u2019t. I was in the 20\u2019s.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Mm-hm. See, when I came to this country, there was still lynching in the south,\nokay? In the 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s it was \u2014 late 40\u2019s, it was still \u2014 you could still \u2014 there was\nsome lynching in the south, and we couldn\u2019t understand it. When we \u2014 when we move\n\u2014 when I first met my wife in Detroit, went to look for an apartment in the apartment\nbuilding, there was a sign, no Jews, no dogs, no niggers. Now this is coming from\nAuschwitz to si \u2014 to this, right? Now, let\u2019s go to the Civil Right movements. I never\nmarched with them, okay, never went with them anywhere, but I was very much for\nthose people, very much so. The demonstration, the burning, the si \u2014 the big cities like\nDetroit was burning, Los Angeles was burning. I was against that, that part bothered\nme. What were they burning? They were burning their own neighborhoods. That was\nthe worst part, you see, that part was wrong on them. But wha \u2014 what e \u2014 what else\nwere they doing? They were looting. See, that was wrong \u2014 wrong, too. See, they went\nthe wrong way. They were afraid to go to the better neighborhoods, but they went to\ntheir own ne \u2014 they burned their own neighborhood, burned their own houses down,\nburned their own storekeepers down. So \u2014 but I tell you, racism and anti-Semitism\nunfortunately, unless the whole world will change, as \u2014 and it\u2019s gonna take awhile, the\nwhole United States will change, it will stay with us.",
        "A: Now, or then?",
        "A: Now?",
        "A: I would show them what racism and anti-Semitism can do to a folk \u2014 can do to\npeople. I would tell them about it. What can happen when \u2014 when anti-Semitism and\nracism flourishes. That people are being murdered, people are being deprived of\nfreedom, people are being deprived of that. If this is the kind of world we want in the\nUnited States, this is not what we need. What we need is education. We need people \u2014\nbetter schools, we need to teach people about indifference, we need te \u2014 teach people\nabout all of us are equal and that\u2019s what we should do. As a survivor I\u2019m speaking to\nyou today that racism, anti-Semitism should be abolished an-and quickly.",
        "A: Unfortunately, it\u2019s not an act of Congress, yeah. And we have some people there in\nthe Congress that are \u2014 that are anti-Semites or \u2014 or racists. They try to be nice, but\nthey\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re \u2014 right down \u2014 deep down they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re racists\nand anti-Semites.",
        "A: Oh, during the Demjanjuk trial in Israel, there was a cup \u2014 there was a guy from\nOhio, can\u2019t think of his name, a congressman from Ohio, but he was an anti-Semite\nand he didn\u2019t m-mince words about it. Another one is Pat Buchanan is \u2014 is the one\nthat I fear a lot. And I don\u2019t know why he always ends up getting the same job back on\nCNN on \u2014 on \u2014 in same program he gets on. He is another guy that I\u2019m deathly afraid\nof that if he ever gets any power, what he could do. He is a clear anti-Semite who\ndenies the Holocaust very much. Him and his sister. And one of the actors, Marlon\nBrando. Marlon Brando was on the lar \u2014 Larry King show last year, before I went\nto the Jefferson awards. And he said Hollywood is controlled by Jews, and if you\ndon\u2019t go through the Jews, you don\u2019t get anywhere in Hollywood. Now look at him,\nhe has made millions in Hollywood, and if Hollywood controlled the Jews, they\ncertainly helped him.",
        "A: Pat Buchanan, his politics. He sounds like an anti anybo \u2014 anti-all \u2014 all an \u2014 he\u2019s\nan anti-Semite, anti-race. And he\u2019s the one who protected and defended Demjanjuk\nthrough the government, OSI, Office of Special Investigation had the wrong man, as\nfar as being Demjanjuk, but did not have the wrong man as far as being a former Nazi\nguard.

He\nwas a ca-camp guard, a Nazi camp guard in Sobibor and two more other camps. They\nalso got the wrong information about him. He came to this country illegally, lying\nabout his past. He committed crime against humanity and he should be punished for it,\nbut he wasn\u2019t. Oh, he was punished, he was a year and a half in prison in Israel. Pat\nBuchanan was very much against the Holocaust. The people do not remember what\nhappened. The people identified him wrongly and he was never a Nazi. He was a poor\nUkrainian who came \u2014 emigrated to America, went to work in a Cleveland\nautomobile factory, where he made a damn good living and never revealed his past.\nDemjanjuk was a Nazi, and he\u2019s living in Cleveland, maybe not as comfortably as\nhe\u2019d like to today because of all that had happened to him, but he\u2019s still there, free man\nand his children think he\u2019s the greatest thing on two feet.",
        "A: All right.",
        "A: Unfortunately not. Auschwitz always comes up, always, every day, somehow or\nother \u2014 some \u2014 some \u2014 somewhere or other.

Well, it \u2014 1t \u2014 it got so that every day I was being\ncalled by someone in the \u2014 in the media, just about. And I must tell you this, that I\ncertainly didn\u2019t know about the Swiss money. Didn\u2019t know about the Swiss gold. I\nknew about the gold that was yanked out of the Jewish teeth. I knew about the money\nthat was confiscated from the Jews when they arrived to Auschwitz, but I certainly\ndidn\u2019t know that it went to Switzerland. There are gold bars in Switzerland with \u2014\nwith a swastika on it and \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in Switzerland, in Swiss banks. It came from\nAuschwitz and other camps, that it was yanked out of teeth that they were gassing.

But I\nhave the youngest grandchild and \u2014 I should say the 10 year old granddaughter who\ncame with us to Israel on this trip, and she was allowed to go to Yad Vashem. This\nkid stuck with me like glue while I was speaking and she would not leave me for a\nmoment, she was so tight next to me, holding onto me. And after that, she says,\nGrandpa, that was very sad. The museum and also your speech. So th \u2014 our\ngrandchildren know much, much more now than our kids ever knew. So the 10 year\nold asked me to promise her when she is 12 years old, she wants to hear the whole\nstory. She says, by 12, I\u2019m gonna be better equipped to listen to it.
