        "Question: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection. This\nis an interview with Cecilie Klein-Pollak, conducted by Arwin Donohue on February 24th,\n1998, at Mrs. Klein-Pollak's home in Hellendale, Florida. This is a follow up interview to\na United States Holocaust Memorial Museum videotaped interview, conducted with Mrs.\nKlein-Pollak on May seventh, 1990. The Holocaust Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff\nand Toby Hur for making this interview possible. This 1s tape number one, side A. Okay,\nfirst of all, would you state your full name at birth and -- and tell me a little bit about how\nyour names have changed, it seems like you've had several names over the years and what\nyour name 1s now.",
        "Answer: I was born -- my name is Cecilia Goldensile, the maiden name and I was born in\n1925, April 13. My home was Yasinna, Czechoslovakia and when I got married, my name\nchanged to Klein. My husband, unfortunately died 13 years ago. I remarried three and a half\nyears later, to my present husband, Isaac Pollak. This is why I use both my names, because\nI never wanted to erase the name of my first husband, whom I loved very much and had a\nwonderful marriage. And I was married to him 39 and a half years.",
        "Q: And also, for the record, your father's full name and your mother's full name, including\nher maiden name.",
        "A: My father's name was David Goldensile. My mother's name was Hosa Einhorn and they\n-- my father, fortunately, passed away a natural death. My mother was killed in Auschwitz\nwith her grandson in her arms. She took her grandson so that my sister should live, because\nyoung women with children were destined to be killed the same way as older people.\nThough my mother was by no means old, she was 56 years old, but this was considered by\nthe Nazis, old. Even 40 year o-old was -- were killed, had no chance of surviving.",
        "Q: Were you parent -- your parents were from the town Yasinna, Poland --\nCzechoslovakia, as you mentioned. Had your family lived in that area for a long time, for\ngenerations before or did they come from elsewhere?",
        "A: No, not into -- not to Yasinna. My -- my parents -- one of -- my mother came from a\nsmall town which was at the time Romania. | can't re-remember exactly, the name of the\ntown. And my father was born in Poland, but he was only two years old and he came to the\narea that was Yasinna. At the time when my father came to Yasinna, that part was not\nCzechoslovakia, it belonged to Hungary, but when I was born, it was of course Yasinna,\nby then it was already Czechoslovakia in existence, modern, since 1914. So we were taken\naway, I mean, I left Yasinna because I had to run away from Yasinna in -- in 1940, so that\nis about 26 years, was in existence, Czechoslovakia.",
        "Q: What language did your family speak at home?",
        "A: We s -- our mother language was Jewish, but we spoke several languages. Is -- my father\nwas perfect in German, in fact he was teaching German and so we spoke Jewish, we knew\nGerman, Czech. And then when the Hungarian occupied us, I really had to make a crash\ncourse, learning very quickly Hungarian, which I did for just to survive, because if I went to\nhide, I had to know the language. And being I was so young and I had -- I really had an\naptitude to learn quickly languages and I learned it within a few months.",
        "Q: What kind of school did you attend, did you attend secular school or Jewish school?",
        "A: No, Czech, Czech. There was Jewi -- there was no Jewish school, there was only, if -- if\nyou wanted to privately then you -- you went to, you know, like for people [inaudible] have\nto learn how to -- how to pray, but that was not in the schools. We had just Czech schools\nand also Russian, because in our town there lived a -- a great many, they were U-Ukrainians\nlived in our town and they lived mostly in the hills, not in the center of the town. So they\nhad schools for them also and there were some children that preferred to go to that school.\nThey had a choice, to go either to that -- to the Russian school or to the Czech school. I\nwent to the Czech school.",
        "Q: Was there a significant Jewish population in Yasinna?",
        "A: Yes. It was a small town, it was about, I would say -- we -- we were -- it was only about\n12,000 occupants and approximately I would say that 50 percent were Jewish.",
        "Q: Was there harmony between Jews and non-Jews in the town, would you say, before the\nwar began?",
        "A: Th-Th-The Czechs were very liberal and we had no anti-Semitism as far as the Czechs\nwere concerned, but the Ukrainians were anti-Semitic, however they had absolutely no\npower, because they were not in power. The Czech government was in power, so there was,\nI would say there was pretty much what you would say, harmony. We were not usually\ngreat, I mean we did not socialize a lot, but on -- just on friendly basis, to say hello. But it -\n- somehow it was that Jews were mostly socializing with Jews and it was also, you know,\nthey did not care too much for education, where we are very education minded. So there\nwould have been also a gap, as far as on an intellectual level.",
        "Q: Did that change -- did the harmony between Jews and non-Jews change after the\nHungarian occupation?",
        "A: It -- as soon as the Hungarian occupied us, they implemented the same laws what the --\nwhat the Nazis did. So when they -- before -- before their occupation, the Ukrainian took\nover because the -- the Czechs had left, they -- they -- there was no Czech government any\nmore and th-they -- so we were really in peril, because they were going to kill all the Jews\nin the town. And -- so we were really very glad when the Hungarians came in because we\nthought that they are much more civilized and much more organized government, but we\nfound out very soon that this was not the case. My father was born in -- in Poland, but he\nwas only two years when we came -- when he came to Yasinna and he had Czech\ncitizenships. They took away our Czech citizenship and eventually, a few months later,\nwhen I went to Plata frip -- no, before that. As soon as the Hungarian came in -- I was 14 y\n-- not even quite 14, but -- but close to 14 and I was still in school, of course and I didn't\neven finish the eighth grade, because I was -- in the eighth grade it was like -- like here a\nhigh school, because our level of education was always very, very high. Let's say if you had\nhigh school in -- in Czechoslovakia, then it would be here -- like here two years of college.\nBecause we -- this is how they taught, because we didn't have like college and right by us --\nright after college, you -- after high school, you could go into medical school or to law\nschool. Like my brothers. They studied, one studied law, one studied a dentistry, but it was\nright after they finished high school. They didn't have to go first four years of college and\nthen four years to become a dentist or four years of college and three years to become a\nlawyer. From as soon as we graduated high school, you could go in right straight to law\nschool or to medical school. But then we -- I was -- all the Jewish children were thrown out\nof school as soon as the Hungarian came in and we were sent out, they sent me -- we could\nnot return to classes the next day, so -- so of course we had nothing to do. So one day I went\nto play to a friend's house and when I came back, m-my house was -- the door was open and\nmy mother and my sister Mina were gone. And we had three tenants in our home and they\ncame to tell me that they were taken away by the police because they had no -- they took\naway their citizenship paper, so they were considered as aliens and -- and they -- and I ran\nto the police station, but my mother motioned to me I shouldn't come near, because she\ndidn't want me to be arrested too. And there was already my brother's friend, who was a\nlawyer and he came over to me an-and he told me -- he bent down with me and he told me I\nsh -- because I wanted to go right away with my mother, I was very attached to my mother.\nTold me if I'll be on the outside, I'll be able to -- to help more and -- and I -- by then I had a\nmarried sister, so I really had this -- who to stay. And -- an-and -- and so they will take th --\naway and I remained alone, for the -- at the age of 14. But eventually, my mother got and\nmy sister, a six months extension. And this 1s -- when they came back, we had to make plans\nto leave Yasinna because in six months they would -- they were the only ones really to get\nthat extension, all the other people that were arrested at that time, when my mother and\nsister, they were taken over the Polish border, after a few months being kept ch -- in jail.\nAnd most of them got killed.",
        "Q: Before we go on with that, I wanted to ask about your -- y-you were the youngest of six -\n- six children?",
        "A: I was the youngest of six children.",
        "Q: And could you say -- tell the names of each of the -- of your brothers and sisters and just\n-- just tell me one by one, what th-the fate of each was, and --",
        "A: [inaudible]",
        "Q: What the fate of each one was an-and their ages, relative to you.",
        "A: My -- my oldest sister, name was Fran. Badushnee vas fragy. She had three children,\nages five, eight and 11. Her husband's name was Abraham. They were all killed in\nAuschwitz. Because she had children and any woman -- all the women with children were\nkilled. Her husband was in a concentration camp until -- almost til the end, but about a\ncouple of months before, they -- they drowned him in a barrel of water, which took a\nhorrible ti -- which was a horrible death, even worse than -- than his family's deaths. For\nsome minor infraction which probably was -- was nothing. They -- they were just killing\npeople at random anyway. Sometimes they killed them just out of sport. But maybe he -- I\ndon't know, maybe h -- maybe he went out an-and he wasn't allowed to go out from the\ncamp or what-whatever, outside. The f -- the reason I don't know, but the people that came\nback had told me about his fate.",
        "Q: Was he in Auschwitz also?",
        "A: He was in various camps, but I -- a-at this point I don't even remember. This did not\nhappen in Auschwitz, this drowning. It happened in -- in a different camp. But it's so many\nyears ago, I -- I really can't tell exactly in which camp it happened, but I was told by the\npeople that had witnessed this terrible incident. My -- my brother, Haim -- yeah my sister\nwas approximately at the time when she was killed, 31 or 32 years old. My brother Haim,\nhe was a dentist and he was first in a labor camp. They took him -- the Hungarians took him\naway and he got sick and he was in a hospital and they eventually, they burned down the\nhospital with all the patients and he was one among those patients, so he was burned alive in\na hospital. And his wife, Shoshanna, she went -- she went to Auschwitz, but in the train she\nwent berserk and she had no children and she was young, she may have had a chance to live\na little longer, but they killed her up-upon her ar-arrival because they -- they -- they saw that\nshe wasn't normal. But this happens in the train, so she was killed.",
        "Q: How old was Haim? How much older than you was he?",
        "A: Haim was older, 11 years. And Menachim, who had a chance to also go to Palestine,\nbefore -- before -- he had been -- been -- because he was in Prague, he was studying law, so\nhe left for Palestine and he's older -- he was older 13 years than me. So actually he and\nParela, they're alive. Parela is five years older and my sister Mina was -- 1s three years\nolder.",
        "Q: Were you particularly close with any of your brothers or sisters?",
        "A: We were very, very close. In fact my brother was almost to me -- he took over, actually,\nthe duties of our father because I was only nine years old and my father had passed away.\nAnd he -- he arranged that eventually I was going to study in Prague when I finish the\neighth grade, because after eighth grade, you had to leave Yasinna because there was no\nhigher education. So y-you had to go -- go to a bigger city for -- we called the gimnasium,\nwhich was you know, the high school. And he -- he was always bringing me presents and we\nwere -- we were a very, very closeknit family and very devoted. I will show you how\ndevoted my brothers were, that Haim, he had also a chance to leave for Palestine because\nhe was also, he was in Prague and after that he went on a hackshara, which was a -- you\nknow, this was like a place where you were trained in -- in toiling the land and -- and\npreparing yourself to leave for Palestine where you will be able to help build the country\nand he had a -- and because he was a farshara, so he got a certificate to leave for Palestine,\nbut in-instead he c -- he -- and -- but he came to say good-bye to us and then he came, he\ndecided not to leave because he thought he'll be able to help us and he didn't want to leave\nus alone, so he stayed and -- and this is why he paid with his life, because he wanted to help\nhis mother and sisters.",
        "Q: And it was Haim who you were saying was so helpful with -- with you, becoming like\nanother father after your father had died?",
        "A: I-It -- It was Menachim and father, Menachim did also everything but in fact,\nMenachim all these years, was so unhappy because he felt that he should have been there\nfor us and -- and I kept alway -- I always had to -- had to tell him that this was the greatest\nthing that could have happened, because if -- if not he would have also perhaps perished and\nthis way at least we had a-another family member survive. But he felt guilty all these years\nand he didn't know himself how -- how to help us after the war. My -- my brothers and\nsisters and my mother, they were the whole world to me. There was no better people on this\nearth that -- that I know, even -- for instance, Mina lives in -- in Israel, but we see each\nother twice a year, because I go there every year and when I come back, she -- I-I take her\nwith me and we always -- 1-if-if one didn't have, we always shared everything. While my\nhusband was alive, whatever he bought me and if -- if they couldn't afford, he would always\nbuy for my sister, because he knew it meant so much for me to enjoy it if she had it also.\nAnd we remained like this, very devoted to each other. And therefore, I d-d -- by having my\nfamily killed, they really destroyed my life also, because even -- even when you live and\nwhen you and -- and when you have already everything, but we could never fully enjoy\nanything, because we -- we lost so much in our lives and -- and we could never -- you can\nnever get back. Can get back material things, but you simply cannot get back family and --\nand it wasn't only the family, it was to -- to watch the terrible things that were done while\nwe were incarcerated and to see people being killed so senselessly. It -- it remains with you\nthe rest of your life. The nightmares never go away. The screams never fade in your mind\nand the nights are the ones that bring everything back to us, to all the survivors. I think\nwhen I speak, I speak for all the survivors. There isn't one survivor that 1s really a healthy\nperson. But we have always lived our li-life decent. We never went out to murder just\nbecause we were murdered. We never became -- be-became criminals, just because such\ncriminal acts were done to us. We brought our children up with values, with love and with\nrespect for all humanity, for all races and because we know what it means to be a bigot. And\nthough it still today, much hasn't changed, there are people that have the audacity to deny\nthat this ever happened. We, as survivors can render them liars, because we are here as\nwitnesses. We are the proof of those atrocities that were committed. And all our loved ones,\nthey're not here to talk about it, but we are and though it is very painful for us to go back\nand to open our wounds, we're willing to do it, for the sake of future generations and\nhistory, so that our voices will be heard and those liars will be -- will be put to shame, that\nthey can yet not even repent that was done to us. Because these are the people that would do\nit all over again, so unless they are going to be somehow silenced and unless all of the\ngenerations that will come after us, will be able to prove with our testimonies that this really\nhappened, there will be many books written that people eventually will believe it because\nhow -- how -- how would they otherwise know what a w -- that it wasn't, that it was\ndifferent than what they are reading to the books? So I'm very pleased now that the schools\nare finally having programs and that they are teaching us, because for the first 35 years it\nwas utter silence. Nobody even knew anything about the Holocaust. And if somebody in the\nmovies, the -- the books that were written, read by us, will vouch by us. I-I remember that\npeople would tell me that -- all weekend, it's too painful, we cannot go to see -- that's if they\nmade the Holocaust movie or we cannot read those book, it -- it's -- it's makes us very sad. It\nwould be very upsetting to me to hear that, because if we could go through what we did,\nwhat we had to go through, then can't you at least watch it, can't you at least familiarize\nyourself? We couldn't even talk about it because -- because it was so painful to us and\nbecause we had to rebuild our lives and because we wanted to have a normal life. As mu --\nas much as we could have a normal life ourselves, but people don't even feel like to -- to\nknow about it. So finally, they have now Holocaust memorials that -- that people can take\ntheir children to -- to show what -- what bessiality was conducted on human beings. And\nwhat can I add to this except that -- that we hope that this will never happen again and if\nyou have any questions that would like, you should -- you should ask me and I will tell you,\nif you want to know about my -- my life after, then -- then I will tell you about that. All\nright with -- you got that and now I speak af -- about my life after -- after the concentration\ncamp.",
        "Q: I have just a couple of more questions about -- just to clarify and -- and you -- you really\n-- | thought your first testimony on the video tape was -- it was very clearly presented and\nyou -- and you -- there are going to be gaps in this story of course, from your wartime\nexperiences, but there were a couple of things that I wasn't sure that -- about and I wanted to\nask you about now. Y-You of course told the story about how you got to Budapest, you\nwere trying to find a way to help your sister out of prison, you thought -- had thought she\nwas in prison in Budapest and -- and you told the story of how you found her and how you\nwere cheated out of your money and -- and -- and -- and so forth and that you found a\nlawyer who agreed to try to obtain her release. I wasn't sure --",
        "A: [inaudible]",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I never forgot these names the w -- I have now such a bad memory because wi -- with\nage, you know, your memory's not as good, but I will forget what was yesterday, but I can't\nforget what -- what happened.",
        "Q: You mentioned in your video testimony that this lawyer was able to obtain your sister's\nrelease after six months. And what I'm unclear about is, why at that point you remained in\nBudapest?",
        "A: I had no paper -- I had no papers. I could never go -- go back to my hometown, my\nhometown was Yasinna. My sister went back to my hometown, to her children, she had --\nshe had three children. And by then her husband was -- was, not any more with her, they --\nthey took him to a labor camp. And he never came out of that labor camp. This was the\nhusband that was eventually killed so brutally wi -- that he was drowned in a pail of water.\nBut Is -- told mys -- but I went at night, I -- I went at night to my sister's house. I -- I wrote\nthis in fact, in my book and -- and we spend -- I spend there -- I arrived at night and I spend\nthis of 24 hours and -- and left again, just -- just to see her once again and this was the last\nthat I ever saw of my sister. And I had to remain in Budapest because this was a big city\nwhere I could, you know, lose myself where -- where -- where -- and I was -- I didn't even\nlook my age, so I-I hoped that I was not going to be picked up and asked for papers, but\nonce I-I did, I mean I was picked up. But somehow I managed to talk myself out, you know,\nbut [inaudible] the papers and I'm going to -- I-I -- if you want me, I tell you this incident,\nbut -- but if you want me to talk about something else, then -- then I'll talk about --",
        "Q: No, that's all -- that -- that made it clearer, I was just wondering about that one thing.",
        "A: Because I had no papers, I could never go back, you know. I had to be there, by my --\nand I was by myself.",
        "Q: I ima -- I think it's probably in your book, but it's not in your first -- in your video\ntestimony, how it was that you met Joe, your fianc\u00e9 and when.",
        "A: I -- all of us in Budapest, without paper, actually that -- hiding, but not like some people\nwere hiding, you know 1-in one room or were behind a wall. I was also hiding, but I had to -\n- I could walk the streets and if I would be, 1-if they would ask me for papers, I would be\npicked up. But I still had to also look for some work, because I needed to live and to -- and\nto pay rent. So first I -- I worked in many different places and then finally I got to work in --\nI got a job in a dental laboratory, because while I -- when Menac -- when my brother Haim\nleft and he was the one that helped us all along until -- until they took him away, he made\narrangements for me and my mother to leave for Vimiritas, which was a big city in\nHungary and made arrangements where he used to send his dental work, in to that\nlaboratory, that I should learn to become a dental technician, to be a-an apprentice. So I had\na little idea, I had some idea about dental -- dental technician work. I wasn't yet -- well, I\nmean I wasn't proficient in it, but I knew a little bit because I -- I only learned like eight\nmonths. And after that I had to leave f-for Budapest, hoping that I can help my sister out of\nthat jail. So I tried to find work in a -- a laboratory, but for awhile I couldn't and eventually I\ndid find work in a -- I was accepted in a laboratory and my husband -- my fianc\u00e9, who\neventually became my husband after the war, and to say good-bye to my mother, who lived\nwith my sister and whose -- she also had no papers, but that's why she was not in our\nhometown, she was with my sister and was with Mina and she showed them my picture.\n[inaudible] this is my beautiful daughter and she is working in a dental laboratory where\n[inaudible] because we were like distantly related like sixth cousins removed maybe, you\nknow. But my mother knew his father and -- and anyway. So he came to look -- he looked\nme up and [inaudible] from my mother -- and he was a dental technician, so he worked in a\nlaboratory and -- and this is how we met. And eventually became engaged.",
        "Q: How long -- how long had you known him before you got engaged?",
        "A: I -- about -- close to a year. He -- we worked in the same laboratory.",
        "Q: Was that coincidental that you ended up working --",
        "A: No, he left a much better paying job, because he w -- he was a full fledged dental\ntechnician and I was just so-so. I didn't know that much. So h-he left a better paying job to\ncome to work in that place where I worked, only that he should be near me, because he fell\nin love with me very, you know, much sooner than I fell in love with him, because I was so\nhomesick for my mother that all I could think is, you know, my mother, my sister, I -- I\ndidn't pay that much attention yet, to boys.",
        "Q: Had you had plans at the time you got engaged, of when you would get married, or was it\nindefinite?",
        "A: No, we -- we -- we had planned t-to get married, but not before the war would be over,\nfor it was something normal times. But eventually the -- the Nazis came into Budapest\nbecause they felt that the Hungarians are not doing, ar-aren't doing enough against the Jews,\nthat they're not sending them out quickly, I mean because porty somehow the -- the --\nwasn't willing yet to -- to -- to send them out, to -- to take away their businesses and -- they\ndid things to -- to the ones that didn't have papers, but the ones that were born there, they\ndid not, they left them the businesses and they left them -- they let them stay in Hungary.\nThen the Nazis came in and they did [inaudible]. And of course then I knew there was no\nway for me to -- to remain in Budapest any more. So I wanted to be with my family, so this\nis why I went back.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of an interview with Cecilie Klein-Pollak, this is tape one, side B.\nYou described in your video interview, returning to Hoost and rejoining with your family\nthere and that you were immediately put into a ghetto.",
        "A: A few weeks later.",
        "Q: Okay. Would you describe a little bit more about th-those six weeks that you spent in\nthat ghetto?",
        "A: In the ghetto? We were in once -- one room. We were -- my family, my -- my sister,\nmyself, my brother-in-law, their -- their baby and one more family and some slept on -- on\nthe floor because we didn't have enough beds, on -- and we were very crowded, we would\nget -- food was being -- there was like a kitchen -- I'm sorry -- and everybody also brought\nth-their own food, prepared. We had -- my mother made a lot of like toast, you know, they\ncalled it sweebark, what can stay and dried noodles and whatever we could -- that wasn't\nperishable and we brought it with us, so for awhile we still had our own food, and after that\nis -- there was from the -- I -- I can't remember exactly, h-how was th-the food situation, but\nsomehow everybody still had something what -- what to eat. And we would play with the\nchildren, we organized a -- like play groups and we -- we -- we tried to teach them Hebrew\nsongs and we -- we would sing to them and -- and we would -- we would just -- th-there was\nno -- nothing cultural, because nobody had any -- we didn't have that -- too many books, a\nfew toys that people would bring for their children or -- or children's books. But we were\nhoping that -- everybody hoped that this will not last long and that eventually you know, we\nwill all return to our homes. Nobody really believed that we are going to be exterminated.\nEverybody still hoped that, even when they -- when we heard that people were taken away,\nwe thought that they were placed in, say a -- an -- they would say a campfire, you know on -\n- in a camp or -- or that they were taken for work or -- nobody believed that this -- that this -\n- in the 20th century, that they would really kill women and children. Because my sister had\na chance to go in-into hiding. I had a chance to go into hiding, but I didn't want to go into\nhiding with his -- my fianc\u00e9's family because I wanted to stay with my mother. So he went\nback to his family and I stayed with my mother and my mother wanted very much I should\ngo into hiding, because she was not -- I guess my mother did believe that may -- you know,\ncome to -- to that -- that we may have -- not be able to survive. But we were too naive and\ntoo -- too optimistic to believe that this will -- can happen. So my sister didn't want to --\nagain, nobody wanted to leave each other and that's what -- why we stayed together and\nnobody went into hiding. And with a little child, would have been really impossible to go\ninto hiding. But for instance, my mother could have gone into hiding with me, with -- with\nmy fianc\u00e9's family but she refused and I refused and in a way, we didn't -- I-I was glad I did\n-- I didn't go into hiding because then I would have always had this, you know, I would have\na guilty conscience, thinking that maybe if I would have been there, maybe I could have\nbeen of help. And this way I know that there was nothing that anybody could do to help, not\neven for the closest and for the most loved one in the families. Now my fianc\u00e9 and his\nfamily did go into hiding and they hid also a lot of other families and the rabbi with his\nfamily, because my father-in-law was very wealthy and he gave a lot of money for the\npeople, you know, that -- that hid him. And then, they -- what they did is, eventually they --\nthey went to the authorities and -- and gave them out, after they had taken everything away\nfrom them. So -- so they were yet brutally beaten before they send them to the -- to the\nghetto and then -- and then they send them to Auschwitz to be killed. So there was no --\neven the ones that were -- were in hiding were not safe, that they would survive.",
        "Q: And whose -- in the ghetto, were there -- were -- was anybody working during the day?",
        "A: No. Nobody was working, we were just really -- nobody was working and you really had\nnothing to do and we were just marking time. And -- and this was really still my -- my\nhappiest time while I was in the -- in the ghetto because I was with my mother, I was with\nmy sister and -- and her family. I mean, not with my sister the one that was the three\nchildren, but with Mina, because we were not in the same ghetto, my sister was in a\ndifferent ghetto and we were in as -- different ghetto. And so she was killed with all her\nchildren and my mother had a chance to save my sister by -- by taking h-her child. And of\ncourse you never get over losing a child. My sister didn't even want to live aft-after she\neventually knew what happened to her child. And she always made herself, she always\nthought that maybe mother would have survived, th-that mother got killed because of her,\nwhich that's not true because mother could have never survived, they would have taken her\nto the gas chambers even without her child. But it -- the point is, sh -- I can't convince my\nsister because she is s-so determined to feel guilty about it. And she was very, very sick and\n-- and she could never have -- and the saddest part is that she could not have any more\nchildren. She had only that one child. And I loved my sister so much that I always told my\nhusband that I'm going to have one child just for my sister, to give it away to her. But of\ncourse, you know, til you don't have a child, until you're not a mother, y-you don't know that\nyou really can -- cannot do that. That no mother can give a baby, a -- a child. And it was not\neasy for me, I-I don't have my children, the three children by choice that they are 10 years\napart, because I -- I was very sick and I-I-I couldn't have children and I -- I -- it's --when we\ncame out, we were always very sick, my sister and me.",
        "Q: We'll talk more about that in a little while and I wanted to ask you before we -- we move\non and I do -- I also have questions about Mina, but you mentioned that you family was\nvery Orthodox?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: D -- were you able to keep kosher through the time in the ghetto or how did -- what\nhappened?",
        "A: In the ghetto, yes, but not -- but of course after that, not even -- I didn't even keep kosher\nafter I got liberated. One -- partly because of being re-rebellious about what happened,\nbeing very mad at God and -- and just not -- and also partly because we -- we were so\nhungry that we would eat anything, we were -- we starved for so many years and -- and --\nand you -- you just ate whatever you could get. But eventually I turned back to galichin\nwhich we will come to it if, you know, in my interview, I will -- I will explain why and how.",
        "Q: And you're -- du-during the ghetto, did you also observe the Sabbath and --",
        "A: Yes, because my mother was very religious, I would never have done anything to hurt\nmy mother's feelings. I was even observant while I was in Budapest with-without my\nmother and even then I was so hungry, because I did -- I didn't have enough food and -- but\nI would never eat non-kosher, even there. I-I ate just -- sometimes I lived only on bread and\nmargarine and I would buy myself, for like five cents, a cookie, because I remembered my\nmother would say, \u201cDon't eat sweets before dinner, because you won't have -- you won't be\nable to eat.\u201d So I thought, \u201cIf I'll eat a cookie, I wouldn't be so hungry, because the sweet is\ngoing to -- to chase away my hunger.\u201d But unfortunately it didn't. I -- in -- in the camp, I\nwas always so sorry. Why didn't I at least drink more water, because you know, we couldn't\njust drink water whenever we want a drink. We suffered a lot of thirst and -- and -- and I\nalso would buy myself lot of clothes, then -- dapootib because I would tell myself, if\nI will be shabby, then I -- somebody will ask me for papers sooner, because I will be more\nobvious if I look shabby. But -- so I would buy myself, rather -- let's say a skirt or -- or -- or\nwhatever, something to wear or shoes. And -- and not food. And then I was so sorry, why\ndidn't I -- hadder, buy myself food and -- and not starve so many years already in\nBudapest. But you know, when you are young, you want to look pretty and you rather not\neat.",
        "Q: So, let's go on then to -- we know how you arrived in Auschwitz and what -- and the\n[indecipherable] story of your arrival and after you had been there, d -- were -- you\ndescribed your -- your da -- your daily life a little bit, how you had gone first to Birkenau\nand then you, after you had been there for maybe a few months, you were --",
        "A: [inaudible] from May until end of October. May, June, July, August, September.\nOctober or -- or even November. I think it was end of October, approximately, because I\nwas in -- in Nuremberg in -- in [inaudible] January, February, March. Yeah, end of\nOctober. I mean, I can be, you know, it-it's hard to remember the -- the exact date and -- and\nyou -- you wanted me to describe h-how -- how I left --",
        "Q: Actually I wanted to know --",
        "A: I remember standing in front the gas chambers [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Yeah, I wanted to know, while you were in Auschwitz, did you -- a little bit more about\nyour daily existence. Did you have to work at all while you were there or did you -- were\nyou hiding most of the time because of the --",
        "A: No. No, that isn't -- wasn't -- no -- no -- y-you couldn't hide in -- in Auschwitz your day\nstarted at 4:30, you were chased out of the -- we were thousand in one stable and 10 in each\nthree layer bunks. We were standing say lappelle as soon as we got -- as we were chased\nout. We didn't have to dress because everybody slept in that one dress we had. We had only\none dress and there was nothing under, we had no -- no panties, we had no slip, just that one\ndress. In that you slept, in -- in that you wore and eventually became infested with lice.\nCompletely with lice and -- and this was eating you up. So the min -- every minute that --\nthat you had free, when you were in the bunk, you would take off your dress and you would\ntry to -- to get the -- the -- the lice out, which was a futile job. But we would stand for hours\nto be counted because to count -- there were 30 such barracks, they had to count 30,000\nwomen, all women. And if one was missing -- and if -- if she was missing, it was only that\nshe went to the electrified wires, to kill herself, then -- then you would stand so long until\nthey -- until they -- they found the corpse or they would think you know that somebody ran\naway, which was no -- no chance of running away. People only worked -- the ones that\nworked were either in the kitchen, and I wasn't lucky enough, you know, to be -- to be\nchosen to work in the kitchen, or they worked by -- which -- they -- that was called Canada,\nwhere they sorted out the clothes and all the stuff that were brought in by the -- by the\npeople that arrived on the trains, because everybody came with a suitcase of something. An-\nAnd some people had valuables still, I mean hidden, like I -- we had hidden in one bar of\nsoap, large diamond earrings. But we threw away the bar of soap, because when -- when we\narrived and they took us to the shower, you know, to be showered and we had to un-undress\ncompletely naked and they shaved us all over and -- and they said, if every -- you cannot\nhave nothing with you -- you have to walk in just completely naked and you will not get\nback your clothes anyway, so I was afraid to have that cake of soap, so I threw away the\nsoap right there and -- and I -- and I had nothing. But eventually, no they -- they took all\nthese things and they were looking for, you know, for -- for valuables and people had sewn\nin and some had in clothes, sewn in something, you know. So they had people working\nsorting out and -- and finding and also taking away the clothes, which was eventually\nshipped to Germany. So, this kind of work. And then some may have worked somewheres\nelse, but -- but in Birkenau say lager, where I was, nobody was taken for work. They were\n-- always made selections, who each went straight to the gas chambers, or sometimes they\ndid select, but you never knew what a t -- they selected to take for work deep into Germany\nor whether you were selected to the gas chambers, so the block avdest always told us, don't\nel -- volunteer. If you're taken, you're taken, you have no choice, you know? So we were\ntold not to volunteer and we didn't volunteer. But we always knew when they were taken to\nthe gas chambers, because then they t-taken the people th-that they were selected to the gas\nchambers, they would make a ring, from the oneth of the remaned and this is how they took\nthem to the gas chambers, nobody should get -- I'm sorry -- nobody should be able to run\nout from under that ring. And it -- as you read probably in my book about that girl that ran\nout and -- ballerina that I wrote a b -- poem about a ballerina. She was beaten to death\nbecause she was -- she ran out.",
        "Q: You -- that -- that was the only question about Auschwitz, so now we'll jump o-over to\nwhen you were leaving and you -- you described being on the train, heading towards the\nammunition factor-factory --",
        "A: [inaudible]",
        "Q: And -- and your -- you're with Mina your sister and you became very ill and described\nhow Mina --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Sort of came to life in a way, where she had been --",
        "A: [indecipherable], that's right, it was just like a miracle, because Mina was -- was in such\na depression, she -- that she didn't want to eat and there, noth -- you killed yourself, I mean,\nto get -- to get the food. People became completely dehumanized. We were called the two\ngood sisters because we took care of each other. And others were stealing from each other,\nw-would eat up ea-each other's food. And this never happened, you know, between me and\nmy sister. I would -- I would force oo -- er -- mouth open and put in the margarine, you\nknow, it -- it should melt because in order that she should have something in her and I\nwould change my piece of roosh, because sometimes one get with the brudder roosh the\none, I got margarine, but everybody wanted the roosh, not the margarine. I would go and\nchange my roosh, which was such a, you know, big deal to receive that slice of cold cuts\n[inaudible] for a piece of margarine so that I should be able to give her my margarine plus\nher margarine, it should go down her, you know, it should melt and -- and she'll swallow it\nand she only wanted to go and kill herself on the electrified wires, so I-I always kept a tab,\nyou know and always was able to talk her out of it and yet, when -- when I became so ill and\nyou see, you were not allowed to talk to German -- to any Nazi. You were not allowed to\ntalk to an SS. You -- he could kill you if you were only -- th-that was like hierarchy. The\nblock gelderstad could talk to him. There was only who could, you know, talk to whom.\nAnd -- and then I was so ill and -- and the train, this SS was eating an apple and she went\nover and she said, \u201cPlease, could you give me a piece of apple for -- for my sister,\u201d because\nshe didn't even know that she is not allow to approach him. And he slapped her so hard I\nwas just happy it wasn't a Nashis, because a Nashis, he would have killed her. There, on the\ntrain, he only gave her such a slap that sh-she flew all the way to, you know, to the other\nside of the -- of the train. And -- and this is when I told her, you know, was all -- you were\nnot also allowed to divulge if somebody was sick, because if you were sick, then you were\nnot of any value that y-you could possibly still work. Then they killed you anyway, you\nknow, so nobody would be divulging to an SS that somebody is sick. They -- they, this was\nalways the biggest -- the biggest worry of -- for each of the prisoners not to be sick and if\nyou were sick, you never admitted that you were sick. If you were dying, you -- you came\nout to stand say lappelle. If not you were right away dragged off to the gas chambers or\nsometimes for one, they didn't even drag you off to the gas chambers, they would just beat\nyou to death right there. So I -- I -- I told her and then, to my sister that she should never,\nyou know, do that and -- and she even took off her coat, you know, to cover me because I\nhad a high fever and -- and somehow it just, it really, it -- I think whoever is alive, it 1s\neither way, by sheer miracle. It -- It wasn't because one was smart or one was, you know, so\nbrave. It was that sheer luck and -- and also of course, you have to have -- you had to have a\ngreat will to want to live. And this I -- I certainly had. I was so determined to live. Because\nsomehow I thought just because nobody knew, you know and we -- we were so completely\nunaware of what was going on and I thought that the whole world is like this, nobody\nknows. Som-Somebody must come back and -- and tell, you know, what happened. But we\nfound out soon that it was just -- it wasn't ignorance, it was just complete disregard and\nunwillingness on the part of the rest of the world, that they should want to do something to\nstop this killing and these murders. Nobody cared what is happening to the -- to the Jews.",
        "Q: Let's get to that later, too. That's really an important part of your experience to discuss, 1s\nhow -- how you discover what -- what people knew about what had been happening during\nthe war. But before that, did that change in Mina last, wh -- you -- I mean that was such a --\na turn around --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: As you describe, almost miraculous. Did she really sustain that from then on?",
        "A: Sh-Sh-She -- She eventually became, you know, more or less like me, that -- that she was\n-- that she -- they took her to work, so sh-she worked, just like me and -- and she was -- she\nwas eating and, you know and she was -- she -- but she was much more fearful than me, I --\nI was much more, you know, trying organize, organize meant there, a nicer work for\nstealing, you know. To steal, let's say, if -- if we went to dig out potatoes for the -- for the\nGerman -- for the Germans, for their kitchen, let's see, I would try -- before we left for\nNuremberg, so everybody got a coat. Top o -- besides that one dress, we got a coat and my\ncoat had a hood and that hood saved my life. I -- we went to the kitchen, I-I mean they took\nus -- that was done on Sunday because during the weekday they wouldn't waste the time that\nwe should go to dig out potatoes for the German kitchen, but on Sundays, that we shouldn't,\nGod forbid, have it too easy and -- and to relax, so they would take us either to dig -- this\nwas a vety -- everybody wanted to go to dig up potatoes because you saw that you had a\nchance, you know, to eat a potato or -- or to steal a potato and bring it in and we would eat it\nraw because this was no -- no problem, th-that we had to cook it, we thought this is the very\ndelicious food. So we went that Sunday to dig potatoes and I dug some potatoes and I took a\nfew and I put it in the tip of my hood, not in -- in the pockets. Somehow I don't even know\nwhere my -- that I -- I was so smart to do that, not to put nothing in the pockets, but in the\nhood and it was cold, so it was okay, you know, nobody would think why I have the hood\non. And -- and Mina back me, \u201cDon't do it,\u201d because she was afraid, I shouldn't be caught\nand two other sisters took also some potatoes and they put them in the pocket. They didn't\nhave a hood, they had pocket, so -- so and -- I saw Mina so afraid, so I didn't even let her\nstand with me, I said, \u201cYou know what, you're not going to stay with me,\u201d because I was\nafraid that she would keep looking at me and that -- that her looks and her fear shouldn't\ngive me away. So I told her I'll stay in the front and she'll stay in back -- in back of me with\nanother, these other girls, because if she'll be in the front, she's going to turn around always.\nSo I didn't want all that should happen. So as we were going in to the camp, they started to\nsearch everybody's pocket and they came to those two girls who had pocket, who had\npotatoes in the pockets and they made her -- them throw out the potatoes on the floor and\nthey beat them, they were already half dead. They beat them so much that we never saw\nthose girls again, I mean they killed them. That -- they took then four girls, two girls had to\ntake one by the foot and by -- by the head and -- and two other girls, to carry in those two\nsisters to their headquarters and they were never seen again, they killed them. And that --\nbut while I watched this, how they are beating them and the screams and I think okay, this 1s\ngoing to be now my finish. Why didn't I -- I listen to Mina? But they search my pocket, I --\nI had nothing in the pockets and I came in with those potatoes. This made such an\nimpression on me. First of all, we ate those potatoes and my sister said they taste like norts.\nI said I -- they taste like apple. And -- and -- and I even shared, you know, some with\nwhoever was under -- under bunk and -- and I always wondered, because you completely\nlost the normalcy, why didn't we ever eat raw potato at home? I made up my mind, I said to\nMina, \u201cYou know when -- the first thing I'll do when I get home, I will eat all the potatoes I\ncan buy.\u201d Never even thought, you know, potatoes have to be cooked, I'm going to cook\nthem first and eat them. \u201cMina, we will eat all the potatoes.\u201d It made such an impression on\nme that when they broke open already our -- our camp to liberate us, you know, the\npartisans and they broke open the ledgers and everybody was running to the ledgers to get -\n- to get salami and bread. I ran to that field to dig out raw potatoes. And Mina had sense\nenough, she ran and she brought a bread and a salami and she looked all over for me, she\ncouldn't find me, but she thought about those potatoes and she came and she found me\ndigging there, a whole bunch of potatoes. And she said, \u201cCecilie, we don't need those. We\nhave -- go and get -- get some --\u201d I said, \u201cNo.\u201d I said, \u201c I don't budge from here til you don't\nhelp me bring in those potatoes.\u201d She -- she helped me bring in those potatoes. And by the\ntime I came to those ledgers, nothing was left. So luckily that she had a -- a bread and -- and\nI'm just saying that how our whole thinking -- how everything changed, from normal and to\nbecome -- t-to think differently, to taste -- our tastes were different. Our -- our whole\noutlook of life was different. I w -- I would tell Mina, the only thing that I wish if we are\nliberated is -- an-and I completely discounted everybody, only me and Mina, like nobody\nelse exists any more, that we should have one room to ourselves, just me and you and have a\nradio -- for some reason I craved music. And -- this was my biggest mission, that's all -- you\nknow, I couldn't even think any more of the rest of the family, whether anybody is alive,\nbecause I never really, you know, thought that anybody 1s going -- lives and that we will -- I\nnever thought that we will be a -- remain alive. I thought -- I built somehow, a world for\nmyself, just me and Mina in it and -- and some music and -- and -- and all the rest\nsomehow, I never even thought any more about my fianc\u00e9, you know, like having -- like\nhaving aspirations, I want to become this or that or -- or -- or get married or -- or have\nchildren or -- just me and Mina to live and outlive our -- our lives, just the two of us. Ina\nroom by ourselves with music. And of course, life goes on and all this changes.",
        "Q: Do different -- do foods, like potatoes bring back memories for you whenever you eat\nthem now\u201d?",
        "A: No, no, this -- not. Memories only that -- that never leave me 1s -- oh -- oh, what\nhappened -- is a lot I-I cannot bring back. All this I-I know was just a certain hallucination.\nI mean about being just two in a world. And -- but I am -- but I am very glad that I -- Iam\nalive, because -- because there was a time that I -- I didn't want to live, even after -- after the\n-- I mean I -- twice I attempted suicide, wanted to kill myself. Because I-I just somehow\ncouldn't -- vatmany become normal again. I couldn't visualize my life without my family. I-\nI-I miss them so much and -- and even my normal feelings, you know, that I was in love\nonce with m -- with my fianc\u00e9, somehow everything was dead when I -- when I was\nliberated, there was n-no, I-I-I had no feelings. I didn't even know why I'm getting married,\nbut I was getting married because we were engaged. An-And I was even wondering whether\n-- whether I will ever feel again, you know, have feelings of whether it's sex, or feelings of\nwhether I -- whether I'll have any feelings of -- of love, whether I can -- can live it -- in this\nworld again, that I can find any reason for living. But then you -- I feel that I did accomplish\na lot because I -- th-this way if I would die, there wouldn't be my children, my\ngrandchildren, the names of my family. You don't make any contributions to -- to society.\nThere is th -- y-you just somehow -- you stop be -- stop existing, my family would stop\nexisting. And this I never wanted it should happen. They were very, very important and\nsomehow as each child that was born, I feel a n -- their name is -- is -- and then I call my --\nmy -- like, the last child that was born now, to my youngest son, she's named after my sister\nand after my mother. It 1s like -- like they're here again, you know. And -- and I still -- I -- I\nwas able to be somehow like a witness. I was able to -- to write two books, I -- I was able to\ncontribute something that I think 1s -- 1s worthwhile. I -- my children are wonderful human\nbeings. They're all professionals. They -- they all, you know, they never heard me say that\nyou have to hate anybody or -- or they, I mean what I feel is something else, but because to\nhate is self-destructive. It's -- you -- it's self-destruction because if you love, then -- then\nyou love only -- not only yourself, but you can love other people as well. And to love is so\nmuch, you make the world so much better than to hate. But the damage that was done to us,\nI can't love everybody because there is a society that -- that does not deserve to be loved,\neven though, let's say they're children and it's not their fault, but somehow it wasn't -- we\nwere children also once, and we didn't do nothing. Our parents never did anything and we\nwere s-so destroyed. I mean, the thing is -- the destruction is, that though I -- I could afford\neverything, thank God, because my husband was, I mentioned, very successful and -- and\nwe did a lot of traveling and we did a lot of, you know, charity and we -- we help a lot of\npeople, my husband was very charitable. But whatever I did, wherever we went, I could\nnever fully enjoy. I -- I remember we were in -- in Spain and it was my anniversary and my\ndaughter wanted to s -- help and came specially. She was already engaged, she was going to\nget married.

And ber -- back -- and also what happened to\nus, because then you'll see that -- that when you know, that all the fam -- most of your\nfamily was killed and -- and when you remember the screams of all those people that I\nwatched being killed and beaten to death, you always tell yourself, \u201cHow can you enjoy\nnow, you know, how can you have a good time?\u201d Now here, what happened I -- I was with\nmy husband in Spain and he wanted we should celebrate our anniversary and my daughter\neven joined me, she flew down to be with us, because we are very close to our children and\nshe was engaged, she was getting married, so we thought she should have just one vacation\nstill with us alone and as we were sitting and -- in that beautiful restaurant, right by the\nocean, a group of German people came in and -- and they were so happy and they were --\nthey were singing and they were -- and they were having such a good time and here I felt so\nsad in my -- and my heart was so heavy and they reminded me of the difference -- how my\nfam -- how -- how I feel and how my husband must feel and -- and after all what happened,\nhow they are feeling, how -- wh-what a -- how -- how happy they are, how they can enjoy\nand how we cannot enjoy anything, even though we could have now everything.

And as I was coming back to this beautiful hotel that\nwe were staying and by the swimming pool I went out and I just -- and I wrote a poem,\nbecause the only relief I would get when I would be very depressed and -- and would think\nof wh-what happened to my family, that I memorialize them in my poems.

As your salty tears will flow, we'll strike back for every blow. By your children, you\nwill be called to task. \u201cWhy did you kill them,\u201d they will ask. Your children will bear the\nshame, you the parents they shall blame. We will tell them that we were human too. We\nlived, we laughed and loved like you. And rejoiced with our children in being a proud Jew.\nFor this we were slain. To kill us all became your goal, though our flesh was dying, you can\nnot -- you could not kill our soul. When you burned us to ashes, a little spark was left. The\nlittle spark rekindled into a great big flame, a great new generation out of it came. This new\ngeneration was sent forth to win our land.

I mean she never gave me a pencil and\npaper, but she would tell me that if I have a poem, I should come and tell it to her. And so --\nso that when they would make the selections, you know, for the gas chamber, eventually she\nwould hide me. In one of the blocks, they had a whole big block -- a block is those stables,\nyou know an-and -- and but we were living, but they had one that they kept just for blankets,\nthey would se -- collect those blankets and then ship them to Germany. So when they\nwould come to select for the gas chambers, the people that were already deteriorated and I\nwould, by then already was a candidate, she would hide me under those blankets, me and my\nsister and when the selection would be over, she would get me out. So that's really how I --\nshe really is responsible for s-saving my life, not to be selected because of those -- because\nof poems. But of course, eventually, when I knew English, I wrote down in English, because\nyou cannot really translate poetry, it loses in translation. It's only that when I wrote a book, I\nhave that one -- one or two German poems, so I -- I just wrote a few lines that I -- in\ntranslation, but -- but this is -- these poems I wrote all after, you know, after I know better\nEnglish and so I -- I -- and by each time, that made me very, very sad, [inaudible] I wrote a\npoem. If I'm happy, I don't write. When I'm very sad --",
        "Q: When you wrote that poem at the -- after the restaurant experience, did you share it with\nyour family?",
        "A: Yeah, with my husband? Oh, yeah, I sh -- I shared all the poems, yeah. In fact my -- my\nsister -- I never even h-had intentions of -- never even thought of publishing it, but my -- my\ns-sister, I always sent her the -- the poems so and so and my brother, so they -- they wanted\nto surprise me, so they ask me so -- so they had all my E-English poems and they wanted t-\nto publish them, they -- because it was published in Israel. So nobody would publish\nnothing that I wanted to publish here, so -- and I -- so -- but they wanted to surprise me, but\nthen they didn't want to surprise me because they thought in case I have something that I\nwant to add, you know? So they let me know that they want to publish it and I -- that a -- I\nwant to send them something. So I was glad, because this way, I -- I wrote, you know, like\nwh-what I wanted to write, to add to it, about each member of the family, I -- I added and I\nstill had a -- a couple of poems that -- that I added, because here it -- it gives just an outline\nabou-about my brother, you know, about each member of the family, I-I wrote something, so",
        "Q: Will you go ahead and read for the -- for the tape, the title of your -- of your book? This\none.",
        "A: This one is? I -- I published, \u201cPoems of the Holocaust\u201d is the title and then I published\nmy memoirs, which is \u201cSentenced to Live.\u201d And -- but --",
        "Q: When were -- when was -- were they each published?",
        "A: This was -- this was published -- first it was published about 20 years ago, but since then\nit was published twi -- you know, what my sister and brother published, was not -- it -- it\nwas a very rough publi-publishing, you know? It was not by any particular publisher. It -- it\nwas somebody that had, I guess, a printing -- a printing int, they printed it up and put a\ncover on it. But then somebody has seen th-the poems in Israel and he asks permission to\npublish it. So thens he pulb-published it, you see, in 1988, no, in -- in 1985 and then he\npublished -- he sold them all out and he published them again in 1988. So it's -- it's 10 an-\nand -- and 13, you know, he publish it -- but -- but they were published already, like almost\n20 years ago, the -- the first. And he already since then published a few times more. Cause\nhe sells them all over, he sells them in England and the United State. I just, sa -- I just have\nnothing o-out of this, in fact I buy m-my own books back from him, you know, when I'm in\nIsrael, I buy and I give them to -- out to friends or -- or -- because I -- I didn't want to, you\nknow, hear nobody was interested to publish it. I mean, he doesn't have th-the rights or\nanything, I -- I have the rights, but I-I didn't try, even. Because once I -- I -- I send up a\npoem and they didn't even publish it, so -- or -- or I got back that it's too sad, something like\nthat and after that I -- I wasn't in the mood even to -- to make an attempt. So it's like -- it's\nthis being read and being sold, I -- that this is not from what I want to make money anyway,\nso, you see, th-th -- from this I could have and I gave the royalties, in fact I -- I even gave a\ndonation 10,000 dollars, to have it -- you know to help publish this book, because the --",
        "Q: You're talking now about \u201cSentenced to Live\u201d?",
        "A: \u201cSentenced to Live,\u201d yes, because it was published by Olaf Kisibery in New York and -\n- and I didn't have th-th-the money and -- and they were after me, they want to -- my book to\npublish and I -- because I -- I really was going to publish it with -- this was another\npublisher that -- that was interested and wouldn't have cost me nothing, but then I felt I want\nit in a place that is -- has some -- some sentiment to me, you know. They were only\npublishing books from Holocaust survivors and make -- I wasn't interested in the money. So\nI -- I gave them a donation and they published it. And then -- and -- and they closed out,\nthey -- they actually -- the Holocaust Memorial in -- that hall ifine -- Washington, bought up\nthere all the rights and all the -- the books and they started to sell them and being that we\ndid have a contract like for royalties, I -- and they wanted to sell me, I-I wrote them a letter\nthat they don't have to send me and I -- I am donating it, it's all theirs, they can keep the\nmoney. So they always send me, just the end of the year, just to see how m -- how much\nthey sold and their little touch about the, you know, the amount that they are selling. And\nnow they wrote me that they don't have any more, that they're thinking of ra -- and even\nfrom them, when I order, I-I pay my own books, and because | -- I want to -- there should be\nenough left, you know, if it's not going to be ever printed again, or whatever. I -- children,\ngrandchildren and their grandchildren, let them have.",
        "Q: When was the, \u201cSentenced to Live\u201d published, first?",
        "A: [inaudible] 1988, 11 years ago. No, 10 years -- it's now 19 -- 1998, 10 years ago.",
        "Q: I'd like to jump around with that one a little bit, too an-and talk a little later while\nsticking with the chronology about your experience of writing the book. But first let's -- we\n-- we were talking about -- y-you had told me a little bit about your -- your transport from\nAuschwitz and we do have that story on -- on the first tape. And we know that you -- you\nwere transported to a munitions factory in Nuremberg.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And then -- and then you were on another --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- transport.",
        "A: [inaudible] to -- to Hallechin.",
        "Q: Hallechin?",
        "A: That was Sudetenkabete. That was Sudetenkabete, you know, that was part of\nCzechoslovakia. And this is where --",
        "Q: And then you were liberated there?",
        "A: This is where we were liberated.",
        "Q: Why don't you describe that day that -- that you were liberated by the Russian partisans\nyer. What -- what did they look like, what did you see, what did you feel?",
        "A: Yeah, okay. We were locked in, in the -- in the barracks and we didn't know why,\nbecause usually they would come every morning and they would t-take us out, even though\nthe factories were already bombed and they didn't have any work for us, but they would take\nus either to dig ditches, or to clear rubble, take from one place big snowstorm, another\nplace, only that, you know, that we should be doing something which 1s -- which is very\nhard wh -- especially when you are in such weakened conditions. What -- this was another\npart of -- another way of -- to torture us. So -- and w-we had no idea why we were locked in,\nwhy they didn't come for us. Everybody was very apprehensive, but you know, whatever\nwill be, will be. Nobody knew what's happening. What they did is they -- they were running\naway because the -- the British were supposed to come and liberate us, but that was still\nthree days away and they knew that they h-have time, you know, still to -- to accomplish\nwhat they want, which was -- there were three camps, of which we were unaware, we only\nknew about our camp, about the Jewish. Jewish, a Polish and a French. And they were going\nthat night, when we were -- th-that morning when they locked us in, they already left their --\ntheir headquarters and they were already in the woods. But, at the -- you know, in the\nwoods, from where th-they were going to run away, but they came back to eat lunch. And in\nthe evening, they -- they had planned to burn down our camp, with -- with us, with -- with\nall our --the -- with all those living, th-those three camps. So what they did is, they had\nsurrounded each camp with wooden logs and soaked them with a certain lighting fluid. And\n-- and they came and they were going to do that in the -- at night -- in the evening and then\nrun away completely. So, but they came back to eat lunch. Meantime, one of the --\nsomebody send word to the partisans, th-that this 1s going to happen, somebody that knew\ntheir plan, which was, we understand, one of the women SS, she was from Czech -- she was\nlike a mixed marriage, from Czech and German parents. Either she wanted to save us, or\nsave herself, that I-I -- we will never know. But she had betrayed this plan and therefore the\npartisans couldn't -- didn't want to wait for the, you know, so the partisan surprised them\nwhile eating lunch. They took all the SS, they -- they -- they broke open our camp, they\nbroke open the ledgers. When they broke open our camp, they showed us how our -- what --\nwhat the plan was, it was still smelling from that fluid that they were going to commit this\nmurder. In fact, they even said that whoever wants, can go and do whatever they want --\nwhatever we want to those SS. Some went and -- and cut their hairs off, you know, but I --\nbut I -- I told you what I did, I ran to the -- to -- for the -- for the potatoes. And -- and we\nhad -- one girl was dead because she got killed just a day before from the bo -- from a bomb,\nyou know. And as they were taking us already to -- to that rubble and they started to -- the\nbombs started to -- to fell, so they told us, everybody should drop to the floor. We all\ndropped to the floor and when we got up, this one girl was dead, she was maybe 19 years\nold. So we had a dead body in our -- in our camp. So we first asked them, you know -- well,\nfirst of all when they came, you can't imagine what we -- we -- first we got scared, we didn't\n-- you know, they didn't have regular uniforms. One had a green jacket an-and black pants\nand one had just civilian clothes and -- and one had an army coat and one had -- th-they --\nthey weren't like a -- an -- an -- an army, but then they started to speak Russian, you know\nand -- and th-they couldn't -- th-they were absolutely shocked. Everybody was so excited\nand crying and -- and we first asked, you know, we want to give her a burial, so we first --\nwe buried her right there. In -- in -- in that courtyard. And they told us that they have to -- to\nleave, they are taking with them, the -- those -- some they killed, I'm sure. No, I don't think -\n- know whether they didn't kill all, but I da -- I don't know what happened to them and I\ncouldn't care less wh--what happened to them. But we were afraid they should leave and we\nstarted to beg them, \u201cDon't leave us, but maybe there are some still hidden in the -- in the\nwoods and they could come and -- and hurt us.\u201d So they said, \u201cDon't be afraid, we -- the --\nthe French camver all man,\u201d this was a man's camp. They are leaving arms with the French\nand they will guard ours and the -- the women's c -- the two women's camps and in a few\ndays they told us, the British will come and liberate us, you know, formally. And -- and th-\nthis is what really happen -- how it happened. So those few days we had what to eat because\nthey broke open the ledger and I certain -- had enough potatoes to last me for -- for a -- for\nmonths. And -- and then when the -- when the British came, they put up a regular kitchen\nand they -- they made those regular meals, but we were so -- without any discipline and\nwithout any, you know and -- and in such fear, all this, that we -- that we will not have what\nto eat, it was so imbedded in -- in our minds, that when we would come to -- to the meal,\neverybody would take -- would want to take the bowl with them, because this was a very\nimportant tool, cause we were afraid that we are not going to have that bowl and -- because\nthis how it was in Auschwitz, if you didn't have that one cup that they gave us, then y-you\nwould have been starved, because you wouldn't even get that -- that one, you know, the meal\nwithout the one -- the soup what we were getting once a day. So we would all take it out the\nbowl, because we thought that we are hungry, we will go in now, into the village to ask for\nfood, you know. And they would beg us, they would say, \u201cYou have to leave,\u201d yeah, th-the\nspoon, we would take everything with us. \u201cYou must leave it -- because if not, you're\ncoming back tomorrow, we won't have what -- what to give you.\u201d Nobody listened. It was\nlike talking to the wall. So what they would do, they would station themselves in the front\nand like for children, they would say any more, anything, don't take. Because they knew we\nare taking it, they would take away from us, the -- take it away and that was a repeat, every\nsingle day, until we got used to, know -- you know, until we saw that we getting normal,\nthree -- . Yeah, they would always beg us, \u201cDon't go out and eat, you know, anything else,\u201d\nbecause -- because our bodies were in such a state, that by eating too much or -- y-you\nwould get sick and you could die, because our resistance was so low. We had people that\ndied because they -- they went into the village or went you know an-and got food that was --\nthat they shouldn't have eaten. An-and they got sick an-and died. \u201cJust eat what we give\nyou, we give you nourishing food and -- and you will always have enough, you know and\nwe cannot give you a lot at one time, but -- but as you build, you're going to be built up and\nyou're going to stay here as -- as long as you need to be.\u201d Because nobody was in any\ntraveling condition. We stayed there at least four weeks, until we could travel. And then\neverybody got a -- like a voucher, you know and it was what -- we could travel free and\neverywhere. And everybody wanted to go back to look for some relatives. Our destination\nwas to go to Budapest, because this is where I was last and we had made up with my\nmother and you know, with -- with fam -- with the family that whoever survives, we should\ngo and look for each other in -- in Budapest. But -- but we -- I-I never g-got actually. I-I\nmean I eventually got to Budapest, but what happened is that when we were -- when we\nwent back, already after the -- the camp, a-after we were already able to travel and we got\nsome -- they gave us also some money to -- to have, you know, like if you want to buy\nyourself a drink or -- or, you know, something. So we -- we could travel free everywhere\nand we were -- me and my sister, we were going a-around away to Budapest. And at\nPrague the train made a stop and the redcoats was giving out sandwiches, so I went down to\ntake a sandwich from the redcoats for me and my sister. My sister stayed in the train. So it\ncame over to me a -- a young man who recognized me and he -- everybody would come to\nthe trains to see whether, when the trains would come in with -- with refugees, they would --\nactually we weren't refugees, we were ex-prisoners, would come in, they would come an-\nand ask whether we have seen this one or that one, you know, to get information that\nsomebody is alive. And -- and this young man came over and said, \u201cAre you,\u201d that I am\nJoe's fianc\u00e9, he recognized me. I said, \u201cYes.\u201d He said \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cJoe is here, in -- in\nPrague. He's alive and he's in, it's called Harrick,\u201d that was also where you went for\nrecuper -- to recuperate. They had places for people to recuperate. He said that he -- he used\nto go every day to the trains, but he stopped going because last time when he went to the\ntrain, he was told that -- that me and my sister, that we were killed. That -- because we were\ntaken, we were really on the way to the gas chambers at one time, I mean before we went to\nthe -- to the -- to Nuremberg. But th-they, th-th-the gas chambers were full, so they --they\ndidn't want to wait hours, so they had a transport to -- to take the next day, you know, for\nwork. So they made us switch, they took us for work and they took th-that transport that was\nsupposed to go to Nuremberg to the gas chambers. That's why we remained alive, but\nwhoever saw that -- that transport going to the gas chambers, told them that we were killed.\nSo my fianc\u00e9 stopped going to the trains. So he told me that -- that I should -- that he's going\nto take me to where my fianc\u00e9, so of course I went there right away to Mina and told her we\nare not going to Budapest, Joe is alive and he -- and he took us to where my fianc\u00e9 was and\nthis is where we stayed again, like four weeks.",
        "Q: Do you remember the moment of being reunited with Joe?",
        "A: But the thing 1s this, that I still had never -- I told you something, that there was\nsomething very dead in me, you know? Nothing, you know, completely alive. I was very\nhappy that he's alive, but I -- I couldn't even think yet, like in the terms of fianc\u00e9, that this is\nreally somebody that I'm going to live my life with, you know? I di -- I wasn't yet -- I didn't\nhave yet all those normal -- normal feelings. But of course I was very happy just -- just to\nknow I'm -- I'm not alone, you know. That I have somebody, that I have somebody that --\nthat belongs to me. And what's -- what I want to just show you the -- the -- how -- how one\ncan become, from a very, you know, the way we were brought up, that you never touch\nsomething that doesn't belong to you, or -- or -- or you were -- we were brought up to give,\nnot to take, you know. Only to do charity and to help others an-an-and m-my mother was --\nwas such a charitable person, we -- we had three tenants in our house, they were so poor and\nwe are -- were certainly not rich either and not even one paid rent because they didn't have\nmoney, my -- my -- here you would be on the street if you don't pay rent. These three renters\nwere living all these years without a cent paying rent. So here, now here so -- this gentleman\nis taking the names, you know, registering me and my sister and he sees the name\nGoldensile, you know and he says to me, \u201cYou know,\u201d he said, \u201cI had a very good friend,\nMenachim Goldensile,\u201d who's my brother, \u201cwe were studying law together.\u201d They were 1-\nin law school together. He said, \u201cIs this any relative of yours?\u201d He is asking me. I said,\n\u201cThis is my brother. In fact he's in Palestine, you know.\u201d Because he said, \u201cWhat happened\nto him?\u201d I said, \u201cHe's in Palestine and -- and he's thank God alive.\u201d He said, \u201cOh,\u201d he said,\n\u201cyou know, everybody is allowed to stay only here, two weeks, but you can stay as long as\nyou want and with your fianc\u00e9.\u201d And he is so happy that his sis -- you know, Menachim's\nsister is there. And -- and he brings us and makes a beautiful cake, you know, like a\nwelcoming and -- and t-to celebrate and -- and brings wine and -- and brings us the best\nfood and every day comes to visit us and -- and is in seventh heaven that, you know, that he\ncan help us. But after four weeks, my sister says, \u201cI don't want to stay here any more. I -- I\nwant to go and look for Nate.\u201d Nate was her husband, you know. She knew that the child is\nnot alive, but maybe her husband is alive and so she wants to go -- we should go to\nBudapest. So I said, \u201cOkay, we are leaving, we will leave then tomorrow.\u201d And the bed had\nvery good blankets and we have nothing, we are just, you know, we -- we have nothing, we\ndon't own anything. So I said, \u201cYes, oh, you know what?\u201d I said, \u201cBut you will stay, we\nrowed the stairs, like a hotel, you know, it had a few flights. I said, \u201cYou and Joe go down\nto the front, I will throw down the blankets and then I'll just walk out,\u201d because I was afraid\nhe will want to take us to the station if I will say, you know, we are -- this way we are going\nt-to the subway, we go over the subway, he would have driven us to the station. Without\nsaying a good-bye, without saying thank you, just throw, I threw down those blankets and\noff we went and never thinking -- oh my conscience didn't bother me, y-you know, here -- I\nam -- I am stealing here blankets, I still called it organizing, I was still camp, you know, th-\nthat if you need something, y-you -- you have to get it because you can't be without it, y-you\nwant to survive. I'm still -- on that -- on that survival mission, you know? And what do you\nthink, we come to the train and -- and we -- we cover ourselves, by the time in the morning\nwe wake up, no blankets. Somebody else took them away. Th-This 1s -- this is what was\nhappened. Until we got -- we got completely, you know, normalized. Until we became\ncivilized. We were -- we were not civilized. I -- I would never believe that -- that somebody\ncan take away everything from you, you know. That you can become a complete different\nperson. That's why, when people, you know, even our own people that were there, that were\nin charge, were brutal and -- and were -- and -- and were beating and -- and doing all\nhorrible things, that prisoners themselves, to other prisoners, I only could understand after --\nafter those blankets and after this that -- that how I had changed also. Then I sort of said,\nthese people were already there four years, they had nothing -- they had only their lives,\nthey had nobody and they had any more, there were no feelings. You have no feelings,\nnothing can bother you. Killing becomes like -- like you would kill a chicken and you -- you\njust want to eat a chicken. They could kill because they want to live. And -- and -- and --\nand I will never, never blame those people that were made into those animals. I blame those\nanimals that made them into animals. Because only them, because I-I know how a person\ncan change and that is only my experience, but never to the -- I never changed to the -- that I\nshould be able to hurt somebody. I -- I changed to this, that I should not respect somebody\nelse's property, that's what I meant. But if you can do that and maybe years later you can --\nyou can do more. You notice that? This is -- this is what my -- what I assume. So anyway,\nnow we are already on our way, because I know you want the life after, okay? Now we are\non our way to Budapest and luckily, my -- with Joe an-and without those blankets and now\nwe atrive to Budapest and my sister knows -- has a cousin for -- to her husband in\nBudapest and sh -- we arrived at his cousin and her husband had arrived the same day on\nthe -- the reason we didn't see each other is, but he was traveling on the roof of the -- of the\ntrain, you know, because people were -- were -- it wasn't normal times and we didn't have\nenough -- transportation was very scarce, so whoever could go into the train went into the\ntrain and who couldn't go into the train was traveling on top of the roof and he was traveling\non top of the roof and he arrived the same day -- we came on the same train. And this is how\nmy sister found her husband. We were maybe the only two people, that I found my, you\nknow, my fianc\u00e9 the day I arrived to Prague and she found her husband the day we arrived\nto Budapest.",
        "Q: Where -- his name was?",
        "A: Nathan.",
        "Q: And where had he been?",
        "A: He was a dentist. Oh, he wh -- where he was? He was also in concentration camp, he was\nin -- in many, in Auschwitz -- I'm sorry, in Auschwitz an-and in many different ones. I-I\ndon't know exactly now the names.",
        "Q: What -- what had Nathan's experience been? I mean, not Nathan, what had Joe's\nexperience been during the war?",
        "A: Joe was in -- also he was in -- in Auschwitz and he was in -- he was -- just a moment, I\nhad it here someplace even, written down, cause he was in quite a few camps. He -- he was -\n- he was working as a -- he was a dent- technician, but he was working as a locksmith. I\nmean, you had to say something that you are and somebody told him he should say he's a\nlocksmith, you know? So they -- because if not, then -- then they could -- they thought that\nthis is what they need and they let him -- then they let you live for awhile, until you are able\n-- able to work. So he was in --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning of Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: At one point -- is it -- 1s it going again? [inaudible]",
        "Q: This is a continuation of an interview with Cecilie Klein-Pollak, this is tape number two,\nside B. So, y-you were saying you didn't -- you don't know the exact names --",
        "A: No, yeah but -- but it -- towards the -- towards the end, when they would take either on\nmarches, you know, they would take on death march or -- and whoever survived the death\nmarch, survived it an-and who didn't -- if -- if you couldn't walk, then they -- then they shot\nyou. So 1-1-1t -- this -- what happened to Joe was that they were on a death march and then --\nit was already, it was winter and they had -- they had, yeah, in Buna, he was in Buna, that I\nre -- I remember. They took him on a death march and many that couldn't walk, they shot\nand then they took them to a train and they told everybody to run on the train. Whoever\ncould run up, was on the train -- it was cattle train, it was open. And whoever couldn't run,\nthey shot. In fact, one was a very good friend of his and a very religious guy and he was so\nhopeful that, you know, that he is going to survive and he gave them so much courage and\nso much, you know, hope. And he was by the train, but h-he couldn't get on quickly and --\nand the SS shot him. But anyway -- I'm -- I'm sorry -- on that train, they were traveling w --\nin the open wagons, in the open cattle trains, for many days and -- and Joe went completely\nout of his mind and he wanted, h-he thought he s -- that he has wings, that he wants to fly\nand he wanted, you know, like to jump out, but he had a very good friend in the camp. You\ncould only survive, either you had somebody in the family, like a sister, or you made\nyourself or you became a friend with somebody and that one looked out for each other, you\nlooked out for each other and that -- they were like two brothers. If his friend wanted to -- to\n-- once, to kill himself, because his -- his brother died, so Joe kept him from, you know,\nfrom running to the w -- whatever he wanted to do. And -- and now, Joe -- when Joe was t-\ntrying to j-jump off the train, he saw all of a sudden that -- that he 1s getting up and his\noutstretched hand, he right away realized that he wants to, you know, jump, so he -- he\npushed him back and he sat on him. He s -- he s -- he pushed him down and he sat on him,\nliterally and he had like a lit -- a -- he had a cup -- a cup and with the cup, he -- the cup had\na string and with the cup he took a little bit snow, you know, he let it drop, for snow and he\ngave Joe, you know, like snow to, like to revive him, to get more to his senses and -- and --\nand he -- he saved his life. And they saved each others lives. Anyway, when Joe was\nliberated, he couldn't -- he had typhus and he couldn't walk, he -- he only walked on all four,\nyou know, like -- like an animal, h-he couldn't stand up straight, but he survived and he was\nin that Harrickton, there he got, you know, he recuperated and -- and -- and we arrived to\nBudapest, Mina found Nathan and -- and Joe wanted to get married, so we got married in\nBudapest. Our -- we had, of course, nothing. We had -- we had no wedding a -- we -- we\nwent to, first of all to a rabbi, that made just, you know, ack -- I don't know, you wouldn't\nknow, probably, but a canopy, you know.",
        "Q: A hoopa.",
        "A: A hoopa. Oh, you're not Jewish, so I-I assume you wouldn't know much about our\nreligion, but anyway, h-hoopa and -- and -- and of course we went also to the, you know,\nlegally we got married. We had no -- no -- we had -- we didn't have what to eat, the -- h-her\ncousin made -- we -- I had to fast because our religion tells us to fast that day. At the\nwedding was only my s -- my sister, in fa -- it was very comical because we went by s -- by\nsubway and my husband had a -- he had a nice suit because he went back home and he\nretrieved some -- something, but he had those heavy boots on, you know? And in the\nsubway, he meets a friend and he says, w-we are going to the hoopa, by subway and he\nmeets a friend and he says, \u201cOh Joe, you're alive, oh I'm so happy.\u201d And Joe is so happy\nwith him and he even forgots -- and they are so excited with each other and I have on this --\na white suit that borrowed my sisters -- her brother-in-law was hidden, so he had a little\nmoney, so he bought for my sister a white suit, so my sister borrowed me the suit and I w-\nwith some bob -- pins, hooked up, you know, that skirt and everything was falling off me, a\nb -- a big jacket that didn't fit me and somebody lent me a little white hat with a little veil\nand this is how we traveled to that hoopa and he asked Joe, Joe asked him, \u201cWhere are you\ngoing?\u201d This guy says, \u201cOh, I'm going to somebody's wed -- to a wedding.\u201d He asked Joe,\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Joe said, \u201cI'm also going to a wedding.\u201d \u201cWhose wedding?\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cMy wedding.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cthen I'm coming to your wedding.\u201d J-J -- so Joe said\n\u201cFine.\u201d But this guy tells him, \u201cJoe, these boots -- 1 -- in these boots you are getting\nmarried?\u201d He said, \u201cWell, I don't have any shoes.\u201d He said, \u201cOkay, we'll change.\u201d He had\nshoes, so he gave him the shoes. He ga -- his boots, he gave him the shoes and everything in\nthe subway and just -- it's comical, because the wedding's a time [indecipherable] my\nchildren, you know, in this -- now, this is my wedding. And -- And now we have already the\nhoopa and -- so this cousin made -- made food -- she prepared food for everybody else that\nwas in our wedding co-company, these three people and for us she made a piece of fish and\nthat was -- after I fasted the whole day, that was a whole food. And we had no money to go\nto a hotel for our wedding night. Mina had one room, with whom I stayed, you know. So we\nput -- took a white sheet, a sheet that we split the room in half so that one bed is here and\none bed is there and this was our wedding night and all the time I'm just thinking how\nhungry I am. So you can imagine how romantic this wedding night was but -- so there -- this\nwas our wedding, but --",
        "Q: What were your feelings as you were experiencing?",
        "A: I -- I was very shattered at the hoopa, that -- that -- that nobod -- you know, that my\nfamily 1-is -- is killed and -- and I was just thinking about th-the wedding that my sister had,\nyou know, when -- at home when she got married and it was a very sad day for me, but --\nbut you know, the -- the feelings right now, th-this -- this is part of -- of this -- this process,\nth -- that w-we still have to be hungry, at -- at our wedding night, we still can't even afford,\nyou know, to have just a little privacy, just to have a -- a room to ourselves and -- and this is\nhow we -- we stayed -- we stayed there for a -- awhile, because we had to -- they thought of\nmaybe was the working a little bit, but then they -- they couldn't get work, so -- so we went\n-- they went back to our -- Joe went back to his hometown, because they had hidden, you\nknow, like some valuables and they were well-to-do people, but they had houses an-and\nfields and all that, but everything somebody else took away and when -- when he came back.\nSo he thought he will bring back something and meantime, before he went, we went to\nCzechoslovakia to see where we could live, you know. T-T-To get -- because I never want\nto go back to my hometown, I wouldn't go back to his hometown either, but we went,\nsomewheres not far from Prague, like we lived in Varstow for awhile. So we went just to\nfind out what the situation is, wh-wh-what we can get as far as, you know, I-living quarters\nand -- and job, but w-we came back to Budapest f-for my sister and -- and Nathan and Joe\neach went to their hometowns, to find -- to see what -- what they can salvage, what they can\nbring back, you know. Maybe they can sell something and get some money. When Joe came\nback, the maid was living in their house and she didn't even -- she didn't even let him in. He\nsaid he wants just to go, you know, to go up to the attic, j-just t-to look for -- to see\nsomething in the attic. She wouldn't let him go up til her husband doesn't come. And after\nall -- h-he -- they had lots of fields and all that and I'll bet he could make -- he couldn't go in\nand sell nothing, because in time the -- this became Russia. The Russia took this away, this\npart. And in fact, they didn't even let, want to let him go back. They -- he was afraid even to\n-- to go in, you know, once he felt it -- to go up with him, because what happened was a lot\nof people got killed, like in Poland, I don't know h -- 60 people at one time they killed,\nbecause they came back to their hometown and they -- and they thought they're going to get\nback their -- they didn't want that they should go ask back for the properties. They -- th-they\nhacked them to pieces. So he wasn't going to get himself killed over property. All he wanted\nis just to go back already, but the -- th-th-they said, the Russians th-that occupied, said that\nthey need dentists there. Th-They -- by them, dental technician, dentist, everything was --\nwas to them the same, you know? They said, \u201cOh, you're a dentist, [indecipherable].\u201d \u201cNo,\nno, I'm a dental technician.\u201d \u201cOh, that's the s -- it doesn't matter, we need you.\u201d He said,\n\u201cAll right, then I go -- I want to go back for my wife.\u201d \u201cYou tell your wife to come here.\u201d\nThey wouldn't let him go out -- go back. So he had to -- he had to steal himself away, over\nthe border and -- and it took him weeks and weeks and we didn't know what happened to\nthem, until they came back. So they finally came back and Nathan came back also, also\nback like that -- th-they had to steal themselves back. And we came to -- to Czechoslovakia\nand there they gave us -- everybody that came t-to Czechoslovakia, especially to the part,\nSudetenkabete, that the Germans had taken away all -- all the housing, you know, from --\nfrom the Jewish people. They took away their housing, they send them out -- they took the\nGermans out and they gave us a very nice villa, without -- we didn't have to pay nothing. I\nmean, to live in.",
        "Q: What was the name of the town?",
        "A: Varlensdorf, Varlensdorf. So my sister, you know, we both shared it, she lived upstairs,\nI lived downstairs and we even had one kitchen, I'm sorry -- we didn't have like she cooks, I\ncook. I was the one to go shopping, she was the one to cook, I didn't know how to cook. My\nbrother-in-law was a dentist an-and my husband was a dental technician. So first they both\nworked for the -- it -- it is like you have here, like there 1s socialized medicine, you know?\nSo he worked -- my brother-in-law worked as a dentist and he got a salary and my husband\nworked -- did the technical work and they got of course, salaries. Me and my sister started\nto work also, we worked -- each got a job in -- in a bank. And -- a-an -- but then I -- but then\nwe became both, very soon too, she became very sick and I became sick. I had tuberculosis,\nwhich I didn't know, you know and -- and she had some internal, what was -- running such\nhigh fever that everything in -- in her had turned upside down and she had operations and\nshe almost died, she was -- very few people sur-survived it. I forgot the name of that illness.\nAnd I got pleurisy fluid, so I was already then sent to a sanatorium and I had -- I -- and then\nI became pregnant and I had -- very soon I had my son, my first son. And -- and this, my\ntuberculosis became worse, apparently from -- from giving birth, so they send me again to,\nyou know, to -- to get well, but there they didn't have medications, they only, bed rest, you\nknow and -- and fresh air in -- in the high mountains, so Mina was taking care of -- of Peter\nwhile I was away. Then I came back and -- and eventually, my husband had here an uncle in\nthe United States, so he sent him papers and -- and we came to the United States and my\nsister went to Palestine, because we had there my brother and sister. In fact I also wanted to\ngo to Palestine, but my husband wanted to come here, because he said that here -- here the\ntechnical work is far -- far more advanced than in Czechoslovakia and he wants to have this\nexperience and -- and he has the only -- he has one uncle that he would like to meet.\nMeantime, we had a very, very bad beginning here, because when I came out, when we\ncame back -- when we came here to the United States, who -- who didn't have relatives?\nThere is a hires, you know, an organization that helped the refugees bring over and they\ntook care of them until -- until they got a job and housing. But if you got from a relative,\nthen the papers, then they were responsible for you and you couldn't get any help from them.\nAnd we -- we could not even though we had Czech money, but the Czech money had\nabsolutely no value and we couldn't bring out nothing. W-We came with -- wi -- that\n[indecipherable] -- we converted, we had 13 dollars. Th-That was all our -- we -- we had\nstuff like clothing and you know, because, from working we -- we could buy that in\nCzechoslovakia, but we didn't have money. So, with clothing what can you do and we had\nbrought out crystals and things like that, but this has no value. So when we arrived, we\nthought, you know, we're arriving and somebody's going to be waiting for us. And here, I\ndon't speak English, my husband doesn't speak English. Yes, no was our vo-vocabulary. We\ns -- we spoke five other languages, but -- but not English. So any -- then we arrived, this --\nwe happened to have an Italian tax -- taxi driver. We have -- you look -- my uncle had five\nchildren, all married -- not even one came to -- to wait for us. And when we arrived, we\narrived on -- on a ship that was -- that they ditched already, I mean that was an army ship\nand they -- w-w -- it was their last journey, they -- they were not going to use it any more.\nSO we were even, not together th-the whole time and my little boy, who was two years old,\nwas -- got sick and he was sick the whole time on th -- he was in the hospital in -- on the\nboat the whole time and a-a -- we were -- my husband was sleeping on the floor on -- on --\nin one bicabo hold, you know, it was just on the fl -- on the floor, on -- on mattresses. And I\nwas Sleeping with a -- with a whole bunch of -- of other women. In -- in -- in the other hold\nwas chickens, it was a-- a terrible journey and -- and we arrived to Halifax and from\nHalifax we had to take a train that was more than 24 hours and luckily we still had money\nfor the train, plus 13 dollars and when we ar-arrive to the -- to the station, you know, wh-\nwhere the trains are arriving and we are looking for any of our relatives being to pick us up,\nnobody showed up. Nobody came t-to -- to wait for us, so we had to be two car -- we had an\naddress, uncle's address, so we took a -- a taxi and this is an Italian guy and he doesn't speak\nand we don't speak Italian. And we give him, just we show him the -- the address and w-we\n-- we looked a sight, was, you know, we were sitting up so many hours and tired and -- and\nthe child is sick and -- and he comes with us to Brooklyn, this is where my u -- where my\nuncle had a -- a very beautiful house. That time that was in a very fancy neighborhood in\nBrooklyn. And -- and somebody and we ring, ring, no answer, so the neighbor, he knocked\non the door, the Italian guy knocks on the door and she said, \u201cNo, the Kleins left for\nFlorida, they're not home, they w-we-went away for Florida.\u201d They know that we are\narriving the next day, they get a cable, none of the children are waiting for us. The -- his\nuncle picks himself up with his wife and leaves for Florida and -- an-and because he didn't\nwant to be bothered with -- with -- wi-with refugees. That is his nephew, his brother's son.\nBut he gives him the address of his son's office in Manhattan, he's a very rich man, I mean\nhe was in -- he's a real estate ma -- th-the uncle, in real estate an-and he has an office in\nManhattan and his son has an office. So he gives him the number, I mean th-the address\nand here I'm only worrying, with those 13 dollars, taxi -- how we going to pay this -- this\ntax1? I was afraid what is going to be w-without -- with the, you know, how are we going to\npay for all that? But he came to -- comes, takes us to th-the son's office. The son has the\nkeys from this house, from the uncle's house because he left them, the keys, that we should\nmove in the meantime there and hoping that by the time he comes, we'll be -- we'll\ndisappear, we won't be there. So -- and we -- th-th-the son gives us the key and tells the tax1,\nhe paid the taxi and tells us that his father will -- lef-left us the keys and they will come and\nvisit us in the evening. Never even asked, \u201cHow are you? How was the trip?\u201d H-How -- an-\nand we come, there is nothing to eat, you know? And we -- and we had those 13 dollars.\nThis is -- this is with what I'm going to -- to live in an empty house with -- with a sick child\nand with people that care so much, that never came even to -- to wait for us.",
        "Q: Did -- was there --",
        "A: I was devastated. You know, you arrive -- I remember that this was the worst -- one of\nthe worst times aft-after concentration camp. Th-Th-The complete disregard, you know.\nBecause we were always so friendly, mine, w-we always helped so much, you know? We\nhelped for -- for strangers, I'm telling you that three tenants lived in our house, ever -- never\nto pay rent. My mother used to cook more food than -- than she needed to bring down to the\ntenants children because they were so poor. And here, relatives, after losing everybody, I\nmean they were not ignorant, they know wh-what happened. They -- they know that the\nfamily was killed. They are not anxious to see, they are not interested to -- to see somebody\nan-and -- and cheer up those people, to know we are here for you, I'm glad you survived?\nThat's why we couldn't talk about th-th-the past. Who cared? If -- if relatives don't care? So\n-- so my husband also was absolutely -- he felt terrible for me more, because I -- I wanted to\ngo to Palestine. I -- right away -- he told me, see? You wanted to, this is where you wanted\nto come? I wanted to come where my family is. This is family? There must be silica, there\nmust be a reason why my uncle left, maybe he's sick, maybe -- he was funny, he was an\nunusual, wonderful, good person, my husband and he still believed that there -- there 1s a\nreason. But eventually he even -- b-but now we are anyway in a situation that we don't even\nhave -- have money w-we want to go to -- to Palestine. So he said, \u201cD-Don't worry, I have a\ngood trade and I will get a job,\u201d and -- and he was trying, you know, to do his best to cheer\nme up, but then th-th-these -- these -- his children came and I had such -- I mean I never had\nfelt any more animosity than -- than for this family, who could treat us so shabbily. But\nthere was another part of the family, th-that we just got to know that were very kind people,\nthat were not, you know, th-they were not rich and they couldn't help us financially, but --\nbut they -- at least they were -- they -- they helped us, you know, with a nice word. They\nwould say, \u201cDon't worry, every beginning is -- 1s very tough and -- and you'll see that\neverything will turn out good\u201d But this whole other family, you know the -- all those\nchildren, they just came, saw us, good-bye and -- and left and here we are with those 13\ndollars from that time. So I would go and buy for us, for 25 cents, a lung, because that was\nthe cheapest, so that I could buy for my child a lamb chop, you know. For him I tried to buy\nan orange, a lambchops, you know, that -- that he should have what to eat. He was very sick,\nI have no money for doctor and my -- that other family that I told you that they were very\nnice and kind would come an-and -- and -- and visit us and -- and my husband was trying to\nget a job, but h-he couldn't -- 1-it was very hard to get that time a job as a dental technician\nand we cannot get nothing, you know, to the hires. So there was another cousin that she --\nshe lived in -- in Allentown somewheres. So -- no -- so-somewheres on -- in -- in the\ncountry. And so she came once and she brought a big package of food an-and brought --\nbought stuff and filled up my Fridgidaire. And -- and helped us that way. And th-then, m-\nmy husband, no matter how he tried, he couldn't get a -- he couldn't get a job. So he s -- he\nwas sure that when his uncle will come, he has connections, he will -- he will get him a job.\nBut as soon as -- as his uncle -- finally his uncle arrives and his uncle tells him, in no other\nterms, he said, \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI thought by the time I'll come, that you will have moved\nout and that you will have a -- a job.\u201d I said, \u201cLook,\u201d I said, \u201cHitler wasn't kind enough to\nsupply us with money, so -- and that we could move out,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd,\u201d I says, \u201cyou send\nus papers, we had no way of getting, you know, of getting into the hires.\u201d I said, \u201cBut we\nare not going to stay here.\u201d And I told him and I called up the hires and I-I told them my\nsituation and I told them, \u201cLook, we haven't got wh-where to be, I have as -- m-my child is\nsick, we have no job, we haven't got where to be. You -- you helping for so many people, I\nwant you to come through an-and help us also.\u201d They said, \u201cWell, they're really responsible,\nbut since your situation is that, you know, bad, then you have to -- if you sign that you are\ngoing -- that we can send you wherever we want, that you're not going to stay in New York,\nbecause in New York is very difficult to get jobs and New York is very difficult. We have -\n- we placed already too many people. It's easier for us to find you something in Dallas,\nTexas. And if you sign that you're willing to leave New York, then\u201d -- because all along,\nbecause I had contacted them already and they said -- told me the same thing, but I -- but my\nhusband said, \u201cNo, let's wait for the uncle,\u201d he -- he wanted to stay in New York. Joe\nwanted very much to stay in New York, so I -- I said, just finally said, \u201cI am going to sign\nanything they want.\u201d And -- and we left and we told them, \u201cWe sign, you can send us\nwherever you want.\u201d They gave us right away a room in -- in das hotel, was a -- a very\ndilapidated hotel, but they had there all the refugees in -- in one place and they had a -- a --\na dining room for us and we could have three meals and -- but they -- before they -- so I\nsigned, but then they said to me, \u201cYou know, you have to go to the doctor, because you need\nto be examined and you have to be in perfect condition and we send you, that you're\nhealthy.\u201d And when I came to the doctor, the doctor gave the -- this -- t-told -- t-told -- g-\ngave the report that I have tuberculosis and that I have to be hospitalized, it is dangerous for\n-- for my child and that I need to carrior test and I was positive. That I cannot be send no\nplace and so they couldn't send me away to Dallas, Texas, so instead they -- they got me\ninto a sanatorium and of course my -- the worst nightmare was for me that now I have to\nleave my child, you know? And he has to be placed, he had to be placed in a -- in a home.",
        "Q: Let's pause here for a minute and I have some questions about the -- about even before\nyou actually took your trip to the United States, you mentioned your -- what year was Peter\nborn, your son?",
        "A: He was born December 28th, 1946 and we came in 1948, on his second birthday,\nDecember 28th, 1948. He was exactly two years when we arrived.",
        "Q: You mentioned about right when the war ended, you were in a state of mind where you --\nyou couldn't imagine the future and you just wanted to be in the room with your sister and --\nand you weren't thinking about marriage and you weren't thinking about children and family\nand the whole thing. And then you were also describing how you felt a -- a little numb\nduring your wedding. Was there a decision made in having a child, or did that just sort of\nhappen to you also?",
        "A: [inaudible], no I was very inexperienced and I didn't, you know, think of that there was\nsuch a thing of -- of using birth control, because at the time I really -- I -- I wasn't really -- I\ndidn't know really how to be yet, a good mother. I was -- not only was I too young, because\nI was young, I was 20 when I married and I was -- and I was 21 when I had my -- my son.\nAnd -- and I-I was not yet -- I didn't have enough yet, life experience. I mean, that -- that I\nshould know to be a -- to be a careful mother. My lot was that Mina had already a child, so\nshe bathed the child, she -- she -- she handled him. I was afraid t -- I let her do everything\nand she was very happy to do everything for the child because she missed so much her child\nthat she sort of -- she almost had a nervous breakdown when I left with my child, because it\nwas like taking away her child. Her husband had to -- to put away -- to hide all the pictures\nbecause sh-she didn't stop crying. She'd stop -- didn't stop crying for me also, but even more\nfor -- for Peter. Peter didn't even know wh-who's the mother, he had two mothers. I was the\none to -- to dress him up nice and to go with him for a walk and she was the one, you know,\nto -- to nurture him, to -- to give him the best, to feed him, to, you know, t-to do the things\nthat -- that the mother is -- is supposed to do. To play with him. I brought him one day and -\n- and I left him because I also saw that she has so much, you know, she comes so much alive\nwhen she is doing that for Peter. Because also, when she moved away, eventually my\nbrother-in-law got, after another dentist, a very nice -- for himself, an office th-that he didn't\nhave to work for the -- you know, for the socialized, he could do private work for himself.\nAnd so they had a beautiful house with a -- with an office and it was a -- a couple of miles\naway, a few miles away. So my sister always asked me for her -- for Peter and I would\nalways let -- like really he was more w-with my sister an-an-an-and I was -- my -- my\nhusband liked very much to go to -- to those soccer games, you know, there -- it was a big\nsport and s-so I -- I always went with my husband, you know and I -- and I let her have him.\nAnd then when he came back to me an-and then, of course, we took him always back. But\nthen when I left, she was left with a very, you know, s-she was hurting a -- a lot for my\nchild. And -- and Peter didn't care either way, because Peter loved us both, he -- we were\nalways both with him together. But I'm just saying that I was not yet a really responsible\nmother, you know? This came - this came later on. But of course I loved my child, this was -\n- to me this was a miracle when -- when he was born because you know, it was -- he was\nmaybe w -- the first children born after -- after the -- the Holocaust. So then, when -- when I\nhad to -- this was a-an absolute nightmare, I-I couldn't -- I-I said to them, \u201cNo, I am not --\nI'm not going no place. I cannot -- I'm not going to leave my child, I have nobody to take\ncare of.\u201d They said, \u201cLook, what do you want, you want,\u201d you know, the doctor spoke to me\nand also th-the ones from hires. \u201cIf you love your child, you don't want your child to -- to\nget infected and -- and then he will get sick also. This way you will cure yourself and -- and\nwe have homes for children.\u201d So they -- they took me to see the home where he's going to\nbe and that he will get used to it and -- and so when -- so we came to that home and I took\nhim still the first time back, you know. And they let him of course play and with toys and --\nand with other children. And then I came back and then I-I -- I came the day that I had to\nleave and we went back to that home to leave him. And I remember there was one girl, that\nshe -- she liked him very much, right from the beginning, a young girl that was helping with\nthe -- with the children. And he was -- he was a very, very beautiful baby, he was very good\n-- th-the baby, I-I mean he was two years old. He was very advanced, he spoke, but he -- he\nspoke only Czech. He didn't even know English yet. And he -- she came with him to the --\nthere was like a gate, you know and -- and I went back into the car and I cried the whole\nway home and then I -- I left for -- for the sanatorium and then Joe would always go, every\nweek. The only time -- they got him a job, they got for Joe a job in a dental laboratory. He\nwas making 35 dollars a week. And they got him, you know, so he moved out from the\nhotel, he wasn't going to, you know, be a burden on them that they should still have to pay\nhis food and hotel, so --",

        "A: I think I say right. And so -- so he had by somebody a room, you know and he could only\nvisit Peter on one day a week, because -- then he came to visit me. One day he visit Peter\nand -- and one day me. So after a few -- a couple of months, I am told that they're going to\nput him in a foster home and I didn't want -- I wanted -- I didn't want him to be changed\nbecause I thought that he is used to this home, with the children and there's this girl that she\nliked him so much and she -- Joe always told me about h-how this girl was always taking\ncare of him and how much, how he follows her around that -- and -- and so I -- I was very\napprehensive that he should be changed and get another home. And I don't know what kind\nof a home he's going to get in. Tis like -- like I had like a premonition you know. So, but\nthey tell -- they told me there was no way, th-th-they keep maximum two months in this\nhome. After that, child must be placed in a foster home, because it 1s a more normal\natmosphere for the child and this is a foster home where they have already two or three\nother children, I think three. And -- and they have a -- a dog and he will like the dog, you\nknow they, they persuaded me -- and he will have fr-friends right away, these children are\nalso foster children, because they don't have their own children. And -- all right, so. Then,\nJoe --",
        "Q: Let's pause, because the tapes --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning of Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This 1s a continuation of an interview with Cecilie Klein-Pollak. This is tape number\nthree, side A. Okay. Before we go forward, I would like to know what your expectations\nwere of the United States. You mentioned that you wanted to go to Palestine, partially\nbecause your family was there. Did -- did you have ideas about what the United States\nwould be like and hopes and fears about that?",
        "A: I -- I really didn't have any positive plan at that time. We just looked for a place where it\nis democracy, so that we will be able to bring up our children free of prejudice, where we\nwill have all the rights to educate them, to -- so that they should be able to have their\nchoices. These are -- were my expectations. I wasn't afraid that my husband is not going to\nmake a living, because he was very conscientious and ambitious and he was very smart and\nknowledgeable and I had all the confidence in him, so I had no special fear. My\ndisappointments were these -- the way we were accepted here and the way we were here\ntreated and -- and also I must say that as soon as anybody thought of -- of was that we are\nrefugees, we were taken like we are -- we don't know anything, we are like from -- from the\nwoods, that we have no idea of civilization, I mean some people would ask me -- when I\nwent into a car, whether I have seen already something. Or as soon as th-they heard an\naccent, they -- they really didn't -- didn't try to -- t-to be very nice to us. Th-They -- they\nwere -- they did not like too much Europeans. This is what was my impression. Until --\nmaybe I didn't meet the right people in the beginning. Eventually, I understood also that it\nwas largely our fault too, that we felt excluded because we felt so different from -- from you\npeople here in the United States, that you had such normal lives and -- and we had such\ndifferent and difficult and -- and -- and sad lives, that we cannot -- we don't fit in to you,\nyou know, into your company. And that showed me many times. For example, when I had\nchildren and we went t-to the mountains, you know, we had a bungalow and there were\nrefugees, wi-with a accent like me, people always sticking together and American people\nwould s-stick together and we could never -- we never had like a common ground. I\nremember that once, which was absolutely very comical, because they would stage shows\nthemselves, you know, it was a bungal -- colony, so we had like a club there and they would\nstage shows and they -- and my husband was always a great participant, so -- and he had a\nvery beautiful v-voice and my husband would be singing and -- a-and we tried really to\nparticipate, to be one of the crowd, we -- well accepted. But then -- and then once, they said,\n\u201cYou know, why should we all s-sit separate, so let's push all the tables together.\u201d So they\npush all the tables together. And what do you think? On one end, all the refugees, you\nknow? All the ones with the -- wi -- that are from Europe and on the other, all -- all the\nAmericans. And something else, eventually more Americans would go away, you know,\nmore European came in and then, like five, six years later, it was mostly, practically, hardly\nany American people. Because you had more in common, the American people had more in\ncommon with the American people. The European people had more in common with the\nEuropean people. We somehow, you know, if we are in -- in one room, you just look at an-\nanother one and you know exactly what his life has been, you know? It is like -- like a-an\nopen book. We pretend very much to be like you, but it -- it isn't, it can never -- it can never\nhappen again, not in our lifetime. When -- when I had -- when I came back from the\nsanatorium, f-first I wanted just to continue with the sanatorium because this I fear -- find\nwas a very important and very terrible part of my life, here in the United States, but when\nthey put Peter in that foster home, all those children were mistreated. They were\nundernourished. They treated the dogs very well, but my child was very, very badly treated.\nI only found out when I c -- after a w -- awhile, when I got better, they would give me like a\npass to go home for the weekend and Joe would go, of course, to -- to visit Peter and take\nhim out for the day and he couldn't notice anything. Because he would take the child out, he\nwasn't going to spend with him in -- in the house. But when we took him home, when I came\nhome for the weekend, as part of an activity that, you know, as you get better, they want you\nto s -- because we are a lot 1-in the beds and they want you should start getting used to\nnormal life again, so -- this was already after I had been there a year, so then I came back --\nwhen I s -- came out for the weekend, we took Peter home and he was filthy, like he would\nnever have a bath and he was all scratched up and he had temperature. So when I -- so of\ncourse I bathed him and I put on clean clothe -- underwear and when I came back and -- and\ntold that woman, I said that, \u201cHe's got temperature, would you please put him to bed?\u201d She\ntells me, \u201cI'm not going to go up and -- and down th-the steps. He had temperature before\nand it goes away.\u201d Th-This 1s what her answer was. And also when I came there, his -- he\nhad curly hair, his hair was so n -- you know, in knots that -- that she didn't even make an\nattempt, you know, to have him nicely combed, washed, nothing. So when I came back to\nthe sanatorium, I was very upset, I -- I -- of course I had no choice but to leave him there, I\nwent to the social worker and I told her I want him changed, I -- by no way do I let him stay\nthere. If he is not changed, then I have no choice but to -- but to go home and -- and take\ncare of him. They didn't want me to, you know, to throw away th-the opportunity to cure\nmyself, so she -- she told me that they're going to investigate and -- and they did investigate.\nFirst -- first of course, the social worker said she came, she couldn't find nothing, that the\nother woman told her I must be jealous of her, that she's taking away the love of my child. I\nsaid, \u201cAll I want is that somebody should love him while I can't be with him.\u201d And -- and I\ninsisted on him being changed, so then -- then they changed not only Peter, then they send\nsomebody else. I told her, I said -- she said -- \u201cThe social worker doesn't think so,\u201d I said,\n\u201cThe social worker is not going to think so, because she placed him there. You send\nsomebody else, that didn't place him there. Then, let them find out how well they're taken\ncare of.\u201d And that's what she did. They found that all the children were undernourished.\nThey -- mal -- malnutrition, they were mal -- malnutrition. They took away all the children\nfrom her and they placed each child in different homes and that time, his home was a much\nbetter one. And -- and then I came -- I came home, after I was there a year and a half, I came\nhome, I took my child back and my child -- this is only how I -- and I know it -- saw it there\nthat I'm very different because when everybody else would -- were telling joke and would\nlaugh and I couldn't laugh, I couldn't even crack a smile and they would all -- and nobody\nknew what, you know, about my -- my experiences, so they would always tell me, \u201cWhy --\nthis is -- was a joke, why don't you laugh? Why are you always so serious?\u201d You know. And\nI -- and I di-didn't respond too much to -- to that. I-I would also suffer a lie because they\nwould have, you know, grandmothers come to visit them and -- and they would tell all the\njokes from their children and -- and I -- and there was nobody, bu-but the joke wouldn't, you\nknow, there was nobody telling me how well my child is doing and I would always listen to\nthem, thinking, what Peter is -- must be doing already now, because y-you know, if -- if\nthey would say how clever they are and I would think about my child, that I am missing all\nthis, I don't know his progress. So it made me very, very sad, but what I did know -- the\npeople shouldn't even talk to me, so I took a dictionary, Joe bought me a dictionary in\nCzech and in English and I studied language. So that within eight months I -- that I was\nthere, I spoke, I -- I read and I could write English, you know, so--",
        "Q: What language did you speak when you arrived to -- with Joe's relatives?",
        "A: They spoke Jewish. Joe's relatives were Jewish and with my child Czech, he knew only\nCzech. But a child learns quickly, I -- you know, within a few months, within two months,\nhe -- he probably spoke English. I know he -- the Czech he forgot completely. So w-w-when\nI came back and my -- my child would play with other children, you know and then when he\nwould come home from that home, he would say to me, \u201cMommy, why don't you smile like\nEdie's mother? Mommy, are you going to die?\u201d Because h-he knew already, you know, that\nI -- I was sick and I would tell him, \u201cOf course not.\u201d And then I made up my mind that I\nwant to be like all the mommies here in America, I'm going to smile, I'm going to do\neverything. I'm going to -- to -- I started to go to a -- a psychiatrist. Everything was arranged\nbecause we had no -- no means, you know, no money. I-It was arranged through this hires,\nthey got me -- they wanted me a long time ago, but you know, I-I wasn't ready. I always\nthought to myself, I have to see guy and he's going to give me back my family? A\npsychiatrist, you go, you don't know why you are or how you are. I knew why I am the way\nI am and so what 1s he going to do? He can't replace nobody and he can't help me much and\n-- and therefore I didn't believe too much in psychiatry. But I thought to myself, for my\nchild's sake, you know, I've got to do something. I want to -- want to be able to do\neverything -- I-I right away I-learned everything, s-so that I-I should be able to do with my\nchildren. I mean I used to ice skate when I was a child. I-I went back t-to, I went to -- I\ncouldn't go t-to night classes because he was little and we had no money like for babysitters,\nso -- but as soon as I could, I take courses, I would -- I learned how to -- I-I would take him\nplaces, to Manhattan, to -- to -- to those, sometimes the church gave a -- a -- a children's\nshow and sometimes temple was something and I occupied myself a lot with this -- my\nchild. But e1-eight months later I -- I had a -- a relapse an-and I had to go back and this 1s\nwhen -- this is my -- my first impulse w-was this is when I thought of suicide, because I\ndidn't want to have to leave my child again, I didn't want he should have to -- to be in foster\nhomes, I didn't want -- I didn't know how many times I'm going to be up and down -- in and\nout of sanatoriums. And I thought this way, you know, he's young, Joe is young, he could\nremarry, he will have one mother and someone who du -- that can laugh and be cheery and -\n- and -- and my husband was absolutely, he was an unusual, wonderful, fabulous person and\nh-he was, oh, he was always the first one to -- to -- to be, when the -- you know, when the\nvisiting was. He w-would always buy me presents even though he didn't have -- he would\nlive on -- on bread and margarine always, to bring me something nice, you know, just t-to\ncheer me up. And he'd always tell me how great Peter was doing, bring me all his pictures\nand -- and always smiling. He -- he was never a down person, he -- how -- how he remained\nso -- I-I want to say perfect, I-I really don't know, but -- but -- but he did. And -- an-and he\nwas very, very much in love with me and if he alw -- and he was a person that could show a\nlot of love, because some people can love and not be able to show, but -- but his love really\npulled me through and -- and so he -- he was always, you know, very hopeful and always\ntold me -- always planned wh-what we are going to do and how we going to live our lives\nand how wonderful it's going to be when -- when I can get back. So when -- when I had -- so\nhe told me he's not going to go to a foster home any more, that he made arrangements like\nnext house, they were a family with two children and they say he can see him every single\nday when he comes home from work and take him back to the house and I should -- so that\nthere -- so I brought him there and -- and when I left him and -- and Peter was all so -- I\nremembered that h-he didn't cry when I left him, but -- but you could see that he -- 1-1t isn't\nbecause he's not going to miss me, but because he was like 1n shock also, you know. With\nagain being left, because I knew how he was afraid that I'm not -- going to die, you know, he\nasked me when I was home and now I'm going a-away again. And this is when -- when I\ncame home and I asked the psychiatrist, I told him I can't sleep -- he sh -- he didn't have\nany, you know, he never suspected that I have anything in mind and I had sleeping pills\nfrom before and I told him I don't have any, he should prescribe new sleeping pills. I took\nout a whole bunch of those sleeping pills, I took them -- I -- I prepared all of them, I had\nmaybe 50 of them. And I thought I'll -- when I go to the sanatorium, I'm going to take them\nall and -- and I'll die. And my husband brought me a very beautiful bed jacket and he\nwanted me -- not to give it to me here, he want when I'll open the suitcase I should be\nsurprised, he always loved, you know, surprises. And he -- and again and a beautiful letter\nhe wrote me, you know, that I should have what to eat again and about his love for me and\nall that. And when he put it in and somehow, I don't know how -- how he looked where to\nput it, I guess he wanted to put it a little bit underneath, he found these pills. And knew right\naway that in -- in a sanatorium you don't need pills, you don't take any medication, because\nif you can't sleep they give you pills, you know. So he right away guessed my intentions, of\ncourse he took them upthay and -- and he was crying and he begged me not -- not to -- what\n-- what kind of -- wh-what I would do to him and to the child and to my sisters and would I\ndo that and -- and made me swear that I will never, you know, attempt anything like that.\nAnd this is really an -- I -- tha-that's how I -- anyway, I went back and when I came -- but it\ndidn't work out very well with that family, because they would take for instance, the\nchildren to the movies, they would leave him alone. They -- he didn't brush his teeth once,\nso she -- she brushed it that she made it bleed and -- and he was already old enough to tell\nJoe, so my sister Mina came to stay with him, her husband let her go and stay here so that\nshe should take care of the child. And she took -- took back Peter and she stayed here a\nwhole year until I didn't come -- come home. And then, I was still not -- not well enough,\nbut they let me go home because I-I -- I wanted so much to go home, but only if I don't take\ncare of my child. So my sister took him with her to Israel and -- by then he was already --\nshe enrolled him already in the first grade and so that I could still recuperate an-and not do\nanything and not -- to have complete peace and not always -- I was taking --\npneumothorax, you know, I had to go once a week for -- because my lung was collapsed\nand I took that -- I was still an outgoing patient fo-for three years after I came back. So they\nwanted I shouldn't have any stress and -- and we -- so, when was I told them that my sister\nwould take him back, because he was so used to my sister, it made no difference to him\nwhether it's me or my s -- my sister. And she was more than -- than willing to do that, so I\ncame home and -- and after that I -- after -- when it was vacation, I went to Israel and\nstayed with my sister, visited with her, like three months and took back Peter and then we --\nI -- I never had any more problems with tuberculosis after -- after the three years were up\nfrom this, you know, after they start pneumothorax, except that I would go -- go for thr --\nfor the checkups. I went only for checkups. And -- and I was very anxious to have lots of\nchildren, because to me somehow, it meant that every time a child is born, was like I'm\nbringing back somebody from, you know, from the dead. It w -- it became -- 1t became to a\npoint, it became an obsession. It wasn't any more just normal, because the doctor forbid me\nto have more children. He said that for my condition, I -- it's very bad, because I could -- I\ncould get sick again and I have a child, I shouldn't have any children. But I was so\ndetermined to have more children that -- that 1f we would travel in the car, you know, and --\nand I would travel with Joe in the car and I would always look into other cars and I would\nsee a few children, I would always count, I would say, \u201cLet's see, there are three children,\nfour children,\u201d and I would say, \u201cJoe, look, look, in that -- this car.\u201d I thought that he can\nread my mind. He say, \u201cWhat's that, oh it's -- yeah, it's a Cadillac.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, not what car\nitis, four children, these people have four children, we have only one.\u201d He would say,\n\u201cLook, we have one child, he is wonderful, he is beautiful, he is healthy. If you want more\nchildren, we'll adopt.\u201d I said, \u201cNever.\u201d I said, \u201cI will have m-my own children.\u201d And I\nwould not use anything, making him think that I'm using, I should become pregnant. I would\nbecome pregnant and maybe because I want it so much, I would lose -- I would lose my\npregnancy. But then I would come to the doctor, he would say, \u201cI -- didn't I tell you not to\nhave any more children?\u201d So I would say, which wasn't true, because we had -- at that time\nhe wanted all religious, I didn't observe anything. I said, \u201cWe are so religious, and in our\nreligion, we're not allowed to --\u201d You know, because he said, \u201cWell, I give you a -- you ha -\n- you have to use something.\u201d I said, \u201cIn our religion,\u201d I said, \u201cwe can't use something.\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cSo you want to kill yourself?\u201d I said, \u201cIt's up to God.\u201d I -- all of a sudden I became a\nGod's person. I said -- he said, \u201cWell, then let me -- you know,\u201d he said, \u201cI know your\nreligion,\u201d he said, \u201cand your religion s-states that -- that if it's for the health of your mother,\nyou're allowed t-to have an abortion.\u201d I said, \u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cI am so religious that this part I\ndon't -- I-I-I -- I don't agree, I'm not going to have any-anything killed,\u201d I said. \u201cAll right,\u201d\nhe said. And he was -- be very mad at me. But then I would lose it. And this happens three\ntimes. Each time I lost my pregnancy, it -- sometimes as late as in the fifth and sixth months.\nThen, with my second daughter, with my daughter that was eventually born, I stayed nine\nmonths in bed. I had a nurse come twice a week to give me injection, the doctor would give\nme -- to -- to -- to make the house calls, you know, the examinations in my house. And --\nand this 1s how I -- how I carried her out and then I was very happy that I -- I have my\ndaughter and I-I named her after my mother and -- and then Joe became -- established\nhimself. He opened up his own laboratory and he did very well financially and our children\nwere doing well -- Peter was very -- doing very well in school and we lived a very normal\nlife, except that I was -- I was always very sad in me. Whatever I did, the trips that we take -\n- that we took, no matter where we went, it -- I could never enjoy it fully. Because if -- if I\neven watched a show and -- and then I -- I would -- it would come in, like -- seeing my\nmother with her grandchild or -- or thinking about my brother [inaudible] that how -- how\nthis must have been, what a terrible death this must been. Always I spoiled everything\nmyself. Nobody did it for me, I did it myself. I don't know whether it was sort of like a --\nlike I have to punish myself, that I have now a good life or whatever it is. But that's -- but\nthat's how it 1s. I can't explain it, I don't know whether everybody feels the same way, but\nthis is -- I never spoke about it because I didn't want to upset my husband, he's trying so\nhard, you know, to give me everything and t-to have a wonderful life and -- and he would\nbring down the stars for me if he could. And -- and yet, he always would ask me, \u201cWhy are\nyou not happy? Look, we -- you have every reason.\u201d And -- and -- and logically, I had every\nreason, but I just, I-I couldn't. I would have such depressions. Sometimes I would have\ndepressions that I couldn't answer the telephone. My husband, poor man, h-had -- didn't\nhave a-an easy life on account o-of me, because he was always so involved about my well\nbeing that he -- his whole mind revolved around me. So I-I would get into depressions and I\nw -- I couldn't answer the phone, I-I couldn't take care of my children, I had already that\ntime two children that -- and I had already what I wanted so much. I couldn't see people, I --\nan-and we went everywhere, to shows and to -- and I would go, I -- I -- and I would\nentertain and nobody would really know what -- ho -- what battle I-I am waging within\nmyself, battle to live or to die. I-I wrote a poem, \u201cDepression,\u201d I wrote a poem, I'm going to\ngive you a book, okay? I -- I don't have too many any more, but -- but just -- it will give you\nan insight that what -- even though -- that we have everything, you understand? Financially,\nwonderful children and beautiful grandchildren. That they -- my children are very close to\nme. They're all professionals, my grandchildren are -- are lovely. We have no drug addicts, I\ndon't have to worry, you know? Yet, what happened has completely taken away the good\nlife that I could have enjoyed. It's -- a-and yet, I learned how to dance, I learned because -- I\nle -- I'm telling you, I learned everything, to play bridge, even to swim, which -- which I-I\nd-didn't know any of those things. I -- I always -- th-the only real enjoyment came always,\nonly for my children. At their graduations, at their weddings, at their -- at their, you know,\nbirths of their children -- I -- I make it for my children always, very easy. Everybody tells\nme that's -- that's calling spoiled and I don't care. If I can give them a good life and I can see\nit, then I don't want to have to be dead that they should have -- that -- that I should help\nthem with the money. I do all that while I'm alive. I do all that while I'm alive. I don't care\nth-that they are -- you know, that they are not saving like I would have liked them to, but if\nthey are not, I -- I'd like -- I am glad that they have a good life. I am glad that they have\neverything what I didn't have. I never told them, \u201cYou know, when I was young, this is what\nI did or what -- when I was your age d --.\u201d I never -- I never put any guilt trips on them. I\nalways led them at their pace. When to call, how much to call, when to visit, how much to\nvisit. I -- I -- I want them to know that when -- when -- when I die, they are not guilty of\nanything, they didn't have to do anything more. All they have to do is, they should be happy\nand that makes me happy. And -- and now that -- that they are -- that they are adults, they\nknow, of course about everything, because even through reading, even through -- I used to\nspeak in schools, I used to speak in -- in colleges. In fact, my children were so little that my\ndaughter once -- and I never let them listen to the tapes -- that she -- after I spoke once in\nQueensborough Community College and -- and I wasn't home and she was in my house,\nshe took the tape -- because I taped, because I wanted the tape should go to libraries, you\nknow, those audio tapes, like yo -- like you have. And she was crying because she listened\nto this tape. And -- an-and one other incident is, when my daughter was in high school, her\nsocial worker called me and she told me, \u201cYou know Mrs. Klein, I had to call you because\nyour daughter is very unhappy and -- and -- and I have to talk to you because she tells me\nthat she 1 -- when she is home, she always has to be happy. If soon she is not happy, then\nyou are very upset. And she doesn't want to upset you so she -- she pretends to be happy, but\nshe is not and she's upset why -- why you have to be upset if she is moody or -- or --.\u201d So\nshe tells me like this, \u201cHaven't you ever been a teenager? Don't you know that teenagers,\nthey have ups and downs.\u201d And then I was think to myself, \u201cA teenager, think. I have never\nbeen a teenager.\u201d Wh-When I was 14, my mother was in -- in -- in a jail. When -- when she\ncame home, we had to run away. I -- I -- I couldn't go -- go outside for eight months, when\nmy brother found us somewheres, a room. I had no friends, because I couldn't have friends,\nbecause I-I-I was always in hiding and running. When was I ever a teenager? I -- I thought\nto myself, \u201cI really am making my daughter crazy. I want something that nobody can -- can\ngive me.\u201d And then she wanted to go t -- away to college, I right away said, \u201cYes, this is the\nbest thing for you.\u201d But she was with me on the phone, every single -- and I never told her,\n\u201cCall me every day.\u201d But she called me, she would tell me everything and we were so close,\nthat -- an-and I don't -- and I -- and I never, you know, was holding on to my children that I\nshouldn't let them move away or -- or tell them, \u201cDon't do skiing, you'll break a leg.\u201d Or\ndon't -- I want them to know everything, to learn everything and to have everything. And --\nand a -- and that's why I never told -- talked to them when they were small and never, if my\nchildren would ask me, you know, \u201cWhere are my grandparents, because this one has\ngrandparents.\u201d I would always say, \u201cThey are in Czechoslovakia, in heaven.\u201d Because if I\nwill say they are here, they would want to go to visit their grave or something, you know?\nSo this is how I had planned my life, this was my plan from the beginning, concerning my\nchildren. And I think I accomplished what I wanted to accomplish, because they are\nwonderful people and they are very, also -- they have a lot of -- th-they are very sensitive\npeople. Th-They are very -- people that will help anybody that needs -- my -- my oldest son\nis a dentist, he did for people so many jobs that he never charged a penny that couldn't\nafford. And my youngest son is a lawyer, but unfortunately he's not working in law because\nhe couldn't -- when he finished, the law profession was so overwhelmed with lawyers, he\ncouldn't get a -- a job. He got a few very -- I mean very -- jobs that were very insignificant\nand h-he didn't like them and so -- so he's not working as a lawyer, but he -- he would give\nhis shirt off, if he can help somebody. If there was -- once a -- a woman by mistake called\nhim, that she called somebody else, but his phone answered and that time he didn't even\nwork and I was completely supporting him because he couldn't get a --a job as a lawyer, he\nwas already that time a lawyer. And she is in Brooklyn and she wanted to go to -- her\nhusband had left her and took the children and she wanted to go after her husband and she\ndidn't have money and my h -- son's w -- this is -- son is religious and this is why, we'll\ncome back -- why I became again religious and she's stranded and he asks -- he calls me\nright away back, he tells her to -- to wait by the phone, he's going to call me back and he\ntells me, \u201cMom, what shall I do, th-this lady is -- and it's Friday, you know.\u201d And he even\ntalked to the synagogue, they said they don't want to get involved because, you know, she\nwasn't a religious person. He went, picked her up, took her to his house for -- for -- for the\nShabbat. I told him I will return his money, h-he should buy her the ticket, wherever she\nwants to go. He took her down to the, you know -- after Shabbat, he took her to the airport,\nbought her a ticket and sent her where she wanted to go for -- to, you know, after that\nhusband and children. Th-This is how far he would go out of his way to help people. I'm just\nshowing that my children are not at all selfish kids. They are very aware of -- of being\nfortunate that th-they can help others and that I always told them and my mother told me\nthat. And we would complain why the richer people -- and we weren't rich at all, that my\nmother is -- is not having any money -- income, you know, from the house where -- where I\nneeded, if I wanted something and she couldn't afford t-to buy it for me, we would say there\nare richer people, my mother always said, \u201cYou should always look off, but you can do not\nbut one that doesn't do and -- and God will reward you and you should always be happy that\nyou are the one in a position to help and that you don't need. And that it's not the other way\naround.\u201d And this is how all my children are. So I'm very proud of them.",
        "Q: Why don't you say your daughter's name and when she was born and then your second\nson's name.",
        "A: Okay. My daughter's name is Ren\u00e9 and she was born September first, 19 -- 1956 -- 1958.\nNo, no -- 1956, 1956 because Peter was born in '46, it's always -- and my son David was\nborn July ninth, his name is David and he was born in 1966.",
        "Q: So exactly 10 years between each child? And how did you -- di -- after Ren\u00e9 was born,\nwere you immediately trying to have another child?",
        "A: No, I was already very, you know, I -- I was already relaxed, I-I have at least two\nchildren. In fact, something th-that happened is that I was bleeding profusely after -- I had a\nhemorrhage after Ren\u00e9, a few weeks later and they had to rush me to the hospital and I\nalmost died from loss of blood. And then -- it took me months to recuperate and then for\nsome reason I didn't have, for ov -- almost -- almost -- more than nine years, I didn't have\nthe period. So I thought that they did something, that the doctors did something internally\nfrom me, that I cannot have children. So we -- we never watched. And -- and 10 years later,\nI became pregnant and I was very happy, but the doctor said that this child -- you're not\ngoing to go to bed any more. If -- if it works, it works and if not, not and it worked. And --\nand he was born and this was one of the happiest days of my life and I even -- y-you will\nread in my book, I called it miracle baby and I-I wrote a poem about -- about him.",
        "Q: Do you want to -- to talk about your experience with religion now?",
        "A: Yes. My -- we were -- I mean, tradition -- we -- we kept --",
        "Q: Oh, I'm sorry, the tape's about to end, we might as well wait for the other side.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning of Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape number three, side B of an interview with Cecilie Klein-Pollak.",
        "A: We were always traditional Jews, but not religious Jews. We did keep holidays, an -- but\nwe did not keep all the dietary laws. We did not keep the, you know that I traveled on -- on\nShabbat when -- whoever is religious, does not do these things, but I always had a kosher\nhome, but outside, I was not observing what I ate. Then my husband -- w-we -- we had -- we\nmoved a very nice house in Great Neck and then we changed houses to -- to a nicer area in\nGreat Neck, because my husband wanted very much to live there. So we moved and -- and\nafter, about -- we didn't even live there a year, my husband got cancer and -- and he didn't\nhave very long to live. My son David, we -- was -- was already danear religious, because\nwe sent my children, all of my children, we sent to religious school, like David went to\nYeshiva. My oldest son Peter went to Yeshiva, but Peter didn't like Yeshiva and -- and\ndidn't remain religious, he didn't keep anything, but we wanted to give our children the\nchoice, that they should be able, if -- if they want to be religious and my husband went also\nto a Yeshiva when he was young and we wanted them to have the same education and then\nwhatever they do with their, you know, whatever they do, we can't always control. So my\nson David, he loved Yeshiva and he became religious right from the beginning, as soon as\nhe started at school. And this the -- full time day school, where they have both, you know.\nHalf a year -- half a day is devoted to religion and a half a day is to secular studies. And\nwhen my h-husband got very sick, my son David, he used to go to rabbi's, to -- you know,\nthey should pr-pray for him and asked his -- ask-asked my son whether his parents are\nreligious and he said, \u201cThey are not.\u201d So h-he told him that maybe God would help if -- if\nthe parents became religious, Shomu Shabbat. Shomu Shabbat means that you keep -- you\nkeep the Sabbath, you -- because there are degrees of religion -- there is very religious and\nvery religious, you know? Amada religiouson. So when David came back, my husband was\nalready very sick and -- and he wasn't going to -- and I told him not to bother my husband,\nyou know, because if he's religious, on -- on the hol-holidays, not allowed to watch\ntelevision, you know. I wanted him to be able to occupy, you know, not to think always\nabout his sickness. So David told me what the rabbi said, and he said, \u201cYou know, why\ndon't you become religious, maybe this will help Dad.\u201d And they are very, very close to\ntheir father and they loved him very much and -- and I loved him very much, but I knew\nthere is no hope. But I didn't want that my son should ever think for one day that I didn't try\nto help his father -- to save his father. If he believes so much that -- in the rabbi's, that\nHallechin is going to help his father, I didn't want that when Joe will die that David should\never think once, you know, if his mother would have become religious, maybe his father\nwould have lived, or would have lived longer. I told David, if -- if this will help your father,\nI'm going to become religious, I'm going to keep everything. Unfortunately, I don't -- we\nhave to be prepared, because I didn't want him to be so disappointed, because I knew what\nthe score is. I said, \u201cBut I am going to -- you can rely on me, I'm promising you, I'll become\nreligious.\u201d And this is how it was, this is how I turn back to -- to observing the Sabbath and\noutside I don't eat, ever, a-anything that's not kosher. I-I travel a lot, even now, but I only\neat always fish and you know, salad, baked potato. Wherever we are, when we are not in a\nkosher restaurant. And my son became always more and more religious. This is how -- how\nhe 1s happy in his life and religion really helped a great deal for me, in a way -- that my son\nwas religious because his father died when he just entered college, it was his first year of\ncollege and though he wanted to go away to college, but because his father died, so he didn't\nwant me to be alone, so he stayed home and he went to Queen's College, instead of going\naway, you know. And -- and he was the one, the strong one in the family when -- when this -\n- when the de -- when my fa -- when my husband passed away. Because my daughter got\nsick after his death and my older son could not accept it. David was the only one, the strong\none and the one that -- that accepted it and that he always felt that there is a reason for\neverything, whatever God does and he was the one that could -- th-that could give courage\nto my other children and -- and he wrote such a beautiful letter to my daughter that she\nkeeps it to this day, because he wrote her that, first of all he would -- he -- he believed that\nif somebody who 1s -- cries too much and -- an-and is mourning so much for a -- for a loved\none, that his soul can't rest in heaven. This 1s how he believes. So he wrote, he told me once,\n\u201cMom, you loved Dad so much, then you have to want to give him also, peace 1n heaven. Y-\nYou can't -- you have to accept and -- and you have to go on with your life and -- and -- and\n-- and you cannot keep mourning all the day and night. You must -- you must do that for\nDad.\u201d I-I wish I could feel the same way my son feels, but -- but I don't, but I -- I observe\nwhatever 1-1s possible, as far as I can observe. But what he wrote to -- to my daughter is -- is\n-- I really want to show his -- h-h-how a religious person can help others who are not\nreligious. And he -- and how he can accept the unac -- the unacceptable, like it was\nunacceptable for my older children. He wrote her, to his sister, \u201cDear Ren\u00e9, look how much\nmore you had in life because of Daddy, than me. Daddy was there for you when you\ngraduated college, he was at your college graduation. When you was engaged, he was at\nyour engagement and he -- you were married, he was at -- he was at your wedding. When --\nwhen you gave birth to your children, he was at their, you know, at their birth. Now I -- Iam\njust -- I-I am just starting now college. He's not going to be there when I graduate, he's not\ngoing to be there when I get married, he's not going to be there when I'll have my children.\nAnd I accept because you cannot bring -- you cannot change what -- what God designate for\neach person, but Dad always told us --\u201d and this is really what he told the family always,\n\u201cI'm not afraid to die, I had a wonderful life and a wonderful marriage and -- and I -- \u201d he\nwas 63 years old, \u201cand after all, some people live 80 years and they have a miserable\nmarriage or they have no children or they have children that are -- that are in jail or th -- I\nhad everything, I-I have no worries, no financial worries. I always -- I always was able to do\neverything that -- that I wanted for my family and with my family and you must accept that\nand I -- I'm accepting and I want you to accept.\u201d And he reminded this to my daughter, and\nthis was an 18 year old and -- and I would like to see which -- an 18 year old that is not\nreligious would be able to do that an-and to have the strength and the -- and the wisdom to -\n- to talk like that or to write like that or to feel like that and to think like that. And -- and I\ncould have had a lot of problems if it would be not a religious child because he could have\nbeen a rebellious and metagart an-an-and become either a drug addict or -- or fidon or not\nwant to go to school or -- h-he did everything what he thought would have made his father\nproud or his mother proud. For instance, he wanted very much to move to -- to Israel af-\nafter -- after he graduated college. And -- and I told him I will never stand in his way, he\ncan always live in Israel if this is what he wanted, but I want him to have a profession. He\nmust first choose a profession. If he finishes his profession and he wants to go to Israel, I\nwill never say no. So, h-he -- he accepted my wish, that he should have first the profession\nand he studied law and he finished law, but then he got married and you know, and then --\nso he goes instead -- right now he goes every year to Israel to visit, which I also go. So -- so\nwhen you have rel -- a religious son, they're somehow more apt to listen to -- to their\nparents, you know and to -- and to grant their wishes than -- than when you're not religious.",
        "Q: When I hear you talk about that, I wonder if it might have changed your own feelings\nabout God and your relationship with God.",
        "A: As I said, I do all these things, but I don't feel the way my son feels. I don't feel that\nreligious inside me, you understand? I would never go back on what I promised my son.\nThat I have never done and I would never do it, because my -- my nephew from Israel, my\nbrother's son, was the Israeli consul in South Africa, in Johannesburg and that was about\n10 years ago, we went -- I went to Johannesburg with my sister to his -- his son's Bar\nMitzvah. And we were staying in a hotel and -- th-the Bar Mitzvah was done so that where I\ncould walk, because I'm not allowed to travel. But then he had a big party in his house,\nwhere he had all those dignitaries, be-besides the -- and he wanted so much I should come to\nhis house. And I would have, but I couldn't -- it's not the walking distance, I would have had\nto travel and he tells me, he said, \u201cYou know, David is not here,\u201d you know, my religious\nson. \u201cDavid is not here, you could come, nobody will know that you traveled.\u201d I said, \u201cI\ndon't do that any more for David. I do that that if I promise something I -- I have to -- I live\nup to my promise\u201d and I would never go and I never went and I didn't go. I'd rather miss, I --\nI do, I -- I --I mean, this is my character, that I will never disappoint or I will never go back\non something that I make a vow o-or a promise.",
        "Q: Do you still question -- do you have any anger at -- at -- at God?",
        "A: I-I-I have anger. I-I have anger, I have anger not so much a-at God, because to me God is\nnot, you know, I don't see God as a -- first that He can say -- He can, like -- like when we\nlearn that -- that he split them, th-th -- you know, like Passover, that he split water an-and\nall the Egyptians drowned and -- and the Jews went out from bondage and brucha 40 years\nin the dessert until Moses brought them to -- to the Holy Land. To me, this -- God 1s a spirit.\nI am Go -- I am mad at every government, at every country, at everybody that had the power\nto do something and didn't do. The United States didn't -- didn't let in -- didn't do anything\nto help th-the Jewish refugees. Every country willingly gave out the Jews as soon as the\norder came. It's true there are a few -- what do you call them? W-We called them the\nrighteo-righteous gentiles, I give them all my credit. I-I think they were very brave and\nwonderful people. But there were very, very few to do that and -- and -- an-and they deserve\nfar more credit because they really were -- were -- could have paid with their lives, but the\ngovernment wouldn't have paid with their lives. All they -- all they had to do is open the\ngates, let us in. Bomb the -- bomb the tracks that go t-to Auschwitz. If they would have\nbombed those tracks, then the mili -- at least of one million of people would have been\nsaved. The Hungarian people were only one year, that they, you know -- it was on -- they\nwere people only one year, but they managed to kill most of them because th-they were not\neven trying any more to send them to work, they were only killing them. If they would have\nbombed the tracks, they couldn't have taken them t-to Auschwitz, to the gas chambers. I\nmean, nobody di-di-did anything. In fact, an-and it wasn't that they didn't know, they buried\nall the knowledge, th-the state department buried among them, that Roosevelt shouldn't\neven know. But then they came to Roosevelt and -- personally and told him about it and he\nwasn't willing to do anything either. S-So of course I have anger. England could have saved\nmil -- quite a -- how many -- a half a million or -- he -- f-for some -- I think they had to give\nakem amount trucks from them, trucks -- I can't remember exactly how many, 500 trucks or\n-- for -- for trucks and -- and -- and money, they could have -- they wanted to give out the --\nthe Hungarian Jews, but nobody -- who -- who -- who would to let them in? Nobody did\nanything and on those I'm ma -- I'm mad at all the people that could have, like all the\npoliticians that -- at -- at every country and -- but not at -- at God. God, to me, 1s a spirit.\nHe's not a human being that he comes down and -- and he's going to smite this one and that\none.",
        "Q: You described coming to the U.S. and -- and how disappointing it was to not be met with\npeople who were really understanding an-and -- di-did anyone ask you what happened to\nyou?",
        "A: No -- th -- not -- th-th-they asked but -- if somebody wanted to say something, you better\nforget about it, don-don't dwell on it, the -- I will tell you something, in sanatorium, when I\nwas in sanatorium, they had once shown a movie that had to do with the -- with the\nHolocaust and then wh-what I heard was complaints. \u201cWhat's -- what do they give us su-\nsuch propaganda, this a propaganda, this never happened. Look it is what they can give.\u201d\nThey didn't even believe it an-and I cried all night because I couldn't even talk about it and\nthat's why I couldn't even become close, you know, to the people that -- that they didn't even\n-- they didn't even want to know. An-And -- and I know then I used to play in -- and I 1 -- I\nlived in Flushing, I played Mah Jong, you know because I told you, I learned everything, I\ndid everything and -- and it was the Eichmann trial was on and I was watching every --\nevery night the Eichmann trial. And then -- these were American people of course and they\ntell me -- and I said, \u201cAre you watching the Eichmann trial?\u201d \u201cNo, we -- we can't, it-it's just\nagainst us. We c -- we can't look at it, it's too -- it's, you know, it's too sad.\u201d This when I\nthought to myself, \u201cWhat kind of people are these? They don't even want to know, they\ndon't want to know. They don't even -- they can't -- they only want if they can have parties\nand if they can laugh and if they can have a good time. So what if it's too sad? They deserve\nyour sadness. They deserve your tears. You are here.\u201d You -- you -- y -- once -- once -- told\nme once, \u201cYou know, we had it very rough too. We -- we had to stand in line,\u201d for sugar or\nfor meat or for something here in the United States. Th-This is why I-I wrote a poem about\nthat too, because it just mind-boggling to me. I know 1f -- if I watch those, you know, those\nchildren on, whether it's Biafra or -- or Angola or anywhere, my heart goes out to them and\nI watch and -- and I-I have such pain and I send donations to them. I-I-I care about not only\nwhat happened to us, I care everything that is happening now. O-Or when was happening,\nyou see, Israel was taking in from Bosnia and people -- why people think that as long as\nthey have it good, then that's all that counts. There's not I can do a lot for Bo -- f-f-for those\nchildren that are istan but it reminds me also o-of us, of those children, I mean the feelings\nof -- of pity came back to me. I just said that the enjoyment never came back to me.",
        "Q: Did you have other experiences of people saying directly to you, this didn't happen, this\nis propaganda?",
        "A: IJ-I-I-I had -- I had so-something wor-worse happening and that was in -- in -- 1n -- we\nlived that time in the Bronx and I had from Czechoslovakia, feathers, you know, and with\nvery big covers, an-and so we went with my husband to have made quilts out of it and we\nchose a material or whatever. And then when we came back, they -- they changed the\nfeathers, because our feathers were, you know, those -- that's from goose, were very good\nfeathers and they gave us very bad feathers back, you know, with a different material and\nwe said, \u201cYou know, th-these weren't the quilts that we ordered.\u201d And she got so mad, she\nsaid, \u201cYou know, you shouldn't have come back for -- f-for --\u201d because as soon as we have\nan accent, they know that -- they know there was a -- a camp and that there was an\nAuschwitz and, \u201cYou shouldn't have come back from Auschwitz.\u201d This is what -- what they\ntold me. You know what? W-W-We left them theres, we were so upset, w-we walked out,\nwe didn't want to get th-the quilts, we left it to them. And then there is, of course -- you\nthink is it that I used to -- my depressions only stopped, you know when? When they started\nto -- t-to be availof -- heard and -- and to start making it publicly, like -- like schools started\nto ask us whether we want to talk to the children or -- or when they started to -- when they\nstarted to do something about the Holocaust to be remembered, because I always used to\nthink that when we die, not -- nobody will ever know because we weren't able really, that\nmuch, you know, to talk to o -- to our children. We wanted them to be happy, we wanted\nthem t-to be like -- like all the other kids, not to have this kind of pain and whe-whether it\nwas right on our part or not, but -- but I wanted there should be some avail -- or some other\nthat there should be -- they should be remembered. So I thought to myself that all these lives\nlost an-and there will -- nobody even -- maybe my children will light a candle because that\nmuch they will know, but what about the world? Nobody will ever remember them and --\nand -- and then th-they will -- then those lies that will start circulating that it never\nhappened and this -- this is also why I used to have these depressions -- it was -- it started to\nbe, you know, like publicized and memorials are being cr-created and -- and there 1s\nsomething being done about it and schools are -- the children are learning in the schools and\nit's being passed on from generation to generations and -- and everybody's aware. I -- my\ndepressions left me. I-I don't have depressions. I have the sadness, I have the emptiness, I\nhave the -- the -- I-I miss them. I-I always will. I will never -- they can never be replaced.\nN-None of my children can replace it, none of my grandchildren. They -- I had them once\nand -- and I-I loved them with such a love that it's hard to express. So this is my tragedy and\nthank God I am not so young any more, I am -- I am 72 so -- so if there is such a -- my\nreligious son believes that they're all in heaven and that you meet. I-I hope it's true, for -- for\nmy sake and if there is such a thing, then I -- I'll happily die and there isn't such a thing,\nthen I-I lived my life and -- and I think whatever I could die, I contributed and -- and it\nwasn't in vain and -- and my children will -- will carry on the names and -- and our heritage.",
        "Q: When did you write your book, \u201cSentenced to Live,\u201d your -- that's really an\nautobiography, isn't it?",
        "A: It -- it -- I'll be always sorry and I'm never really happy with it because I wrote -- I\nwanted it like a three, four hundred page book and it would have been, because I have\nwritten everything much more, you know, I-I wrote a lot about -- about -- how -- how --\nabout my life, how I felt, about -- about everything and -- and then somebody read it an-and\nadvised me that I should not -- I should just write it to this -- to this period, you know, finish\nit at the period th-that I did, no-not to write the rest of my life, because -- and also I wrote\nwith a lot of -- more emotion because I-I used to, you know, always -- like when somebody\ndreams o-of, o-or imagines th-the -- whatever, you know, about the life -- about what --\nwhat kind of a life they're going to have as -- with their Prince Charming, I was always, in\nmy mind, thinking only about -- about everything I will do for my mother and -- and how\nI'm going to make -- make her happy someday and -- and how she's not going to have to\nsuffer so much because -- because well, we were in hiding. Sh-She -- sh-she didn't eat, sh-\nshe would give away her last bite to me and -- and she cut up her only dress to make me --\nmy hant a -- a nice dress and never remarried because she didn't want us to have a\nstepfather and -- and she was a widow at 43 and she did so much f-for her children and I\nalways planned and I always saw in my mind only how h -- what I am everything going to\ndo for my mother. That's why I was so -- that's why I'm so unhappy all my life, that I\ncouldn't -- not only couldn't I do nothing, but the terrible fate, I mean that she had, that she\ndied such a horrible death an-and with her grandson, to know where she was going, that she\n-- because she knew where -- where she was taking her grandson. So -- so I heard all this\nand then, whoever added, I mean he 1s really -- I-I'm not going to say that he's not -- in his\nopinion probably he was right, but I shouldn't have listen, I should do what I thought was\nright. He said, \u201cI-It's too emotional, y-you want these books to be able that children in\nschool should be able to read and -- and you write better another book apart, you know,\nanother book and the --\u201d I should make another book, let's say after -- after the -- the -- the\nHolocaust, about the -- the whole life, you know, what happened and how we lived our life\nand all that, but you know I -- I never did it after any more and if I would have done it the\nway I wanted it, it would have been the way I wanted and I would have had more\nsatisfaction out the book. This way, it's a book, I mean, whoever reads it, likes it because\nthey don't know, you know, it -- I am the one that 1s not that satisfied with the book.",
        "Q: And what spurred you to start writing it?",
        "A: Because I always felt that I have to put something on paper because if -- I-I can't, if not\nI'll explode inside. You see, this is for me a kind of release. The poems were a kind of\nrelease. Th -- Until -- I didn't speak in schools, to -- even speaking in the -- in the\nclassrooms was for me a kind of release. The first time, I thought, wh-when I was asked for\nthe first time, because nobody really taught it, it started really, the schools started in -- in\nthe Great Neck, the principal is a member in our synagogue and -- and he knows I am a\nHolocaust survivor and he came over to me and he asked me whether -- and I also, they --\nthey had my poems you know, in the bulletins, this one, that one. He came over, he asked\nme, could I speak to his class? First I said no, then I said yes, then I said no, then I said yes.\nI couldn't, you know -- then I came home and I thought to myself, \u201cHow am I going to? I-I\nwouldn't be able to, it's -- it's just too painful, I -- I'll -- I -- and I -- in -- in all the years that\nI spoke I never cried in front of children. I always was able to speak very well and you\nknow, and -- and take answers and questions and everything. Giv-Give answers to\nquestions. So, but then I told him, \u201cOkay, I'm going to speak.\u201d And the first time I spoke,\nfirst of all, the children were mesmerized. Nobody -- he said -- an-and he took all the classes\nat one time because he was afraid I'm not going to come back maybe to another class, you\nknow? And -- but I had such a headache, I had such a splitting headache that I thought my\nhead will explode, because that was, you know, the fi -- the first time. And going back and\nt-to -- to everything. So and then -- then of course I got home and I took something and --\nand for days I couldn't sleep, it wa -- it was very emotional. But then I got used to it and --\nand it was okay. I didn't have any more headaches. I-I would -- I -- once a year when I\nspoke actually in Queensborough Community College, I -- I spoke front -- in front of 37\nteachers once, it's th-three hours straight. An-And the funniest thing you -- was one of the\nteachers se -- you know, I gave - I say now you can ask me questions. \u201cMrs. Klein, what\nwas your, you know, what kind of reli --\u201d you know what -- when you have like you have,\nhere in the Jersey, you have television or you go for exercise, what do you call it?",
        "Q: Hobby.",
        "A: No, not hobby. What did you do, like what kind of -- of --",
        "Q: Pastime?",
        "A: Of --",
        "Q: Recreation?",
        "A: Recreation, recreat -- \u201cWhat kind of recreation did you have?\u201d That was after I spoke\nthree hours about Auschwitz, about -- about the killings, about -- about the beating to\ndeaths, about t-the -- you know, when you would go to those showers that they've -- to f --\nth-the -- once -- once aforweese about the showers was a form of torture, because they\nwould first let th-the hot water that you burned your skin an-and -- and you ran out, so they\nbeat you with the -- with those whips and then the cold water. Nobody wanted to go, they\nwould hide. So then he asked me what kind of recreations, I thought, well, tell yitmut, \u201cThe\nrecreation was that we would try to see and count how many lice we have killed that day\nfrom our -- from the seams of our dress. The other recreation was watching two sisters being\nbeaten to death. The other recreation was that -- that when I -- when they caught me with a\nbread, I-I was beaten up so badly that they broke, you know, a big spoon that y-you -- you\nare cooking for the whole army th -- and that I thought that they are going to kill me with it,\nbut how I survived it is just really by miracle.\u201d I said, \u201cIsn't that enough recreation for you?\u201d\nAnd then the teacher, the other teacher came in and said, \u201cMrs. Klein, he's all -- he's not a\nvery bright man, don't take him,\u201d but I just thought, what kind -- what kind of a question is?\nI could see ask something, ask when did you get up or what was your food, or what was\nyour, you know, th-they take you for work or didn't they take you for work or -- or what are\nyour feelings, what -- ask an intel -- you are a teacher, ask an intelligent question. What\nkind of -- what recreation wo-would -- would the Nazis if -- 1f they made tests on the -- on --\nI have a friend that she had her, they were twins, Mengele make -- made tests for them, they\nwould take out the blood from them, you know and the -- and the mother was luckily a\nnurse, so -- so sh-she would take out from herself blood and -- and -- and inject it back into\nthe children. I mean how many -- how many twins s-survived? I mean they made -- they\nmade experiments what they make on -- on -- they made on humans, but they make here on\nmice and on rats. I mean this is -- that they would take children, they would put them, freeze\nthem, then unfreeze them, th-then -- then -- then kill them. They would see -- th-they would\ncount how long it takes for somebody to die in the sun, how long it takes for somebody to --\nto -- to die 1-1-1n -- 1n -- in, you know, fr --in the freezing weather. I mean, this -- this kind\nof brutalities were -- were committed on us. There -- there was th-th-this SS woman that\nwas riding around on a horse and -- and -- and she would just de-decide that -- to go and --\nand kill somebody, trample with that horse to death, a -- a -- a prisoner. They would let the\ndogs tear to pieces prisoners. I-I will tell you what happened to my brother-in-law, the one I\ntold you, Mina's husband. The SS gave for the dogs, food. And -- and he saw this bowl with\nthe -- with the food. And the dog ate, ate and then -- and then had enough and -- and left.\nLeft over something in that bowl. My brother-in-law stole himself, you know, crept to this\nbowl and took out the rest of the food and ate it quickly up. The SS came out with that dog\nthat had eaten before and -- and my brother-in-law was sure that he's going to tear him to\npieces because this used to be a big sport by them. And told him he should kneel in front of\nthe dog and he should say, let's see, like Herr, Herr is Mister, you know, like Mr. Klein or\nMr. Dog, you know, Mr. Dog an-and beg forgiveness and beg apology and apologize to him,\nkneeling and -- and prostrate yourself and -- and then beat him, beat him so badly with --\nwith th-that, that people had to carry him in, but they didn't kill him. This 1s -- this is the --\nthis 1s what they did, because he -- he took -- yeah and I had to t -- to talk about himself,\nIshfa fluta yuda, that means, \u201cI, the lowest of the Jews that -- that has ever crawled on this\nearth.\u201d This is what -- everything he had to tell t-to -- to the dog an -- and -- and Herr do --\nHerr, you know wha -- this 1s wh -- wh -- what diabolical creatures, that they weren't --\nthese were -- these were and these were people that some were doctors, some were\nengineers, s-some were teachers, some were businessmen, but they loved the dogs and they\nloved their families and this is what they were able t-to -- to do to people. My -- my sister\nhas a Polish housekeeper because the one, Parela, that lived in -- in Israel, she moved\neventually to the United States and she lives here and my sister 1s sick, sh-she has\nParkinson's. So she has a Polish woman. And her husband was one of the people that would\n-- the -- a train engineer, you know, that would -- manned that he manned the trains. So she\ntold her that the Ukraine's, because sh-sh-she's Polish, I'm sure that the Poles did the same\nthing. When they took together -- when they took the Jews, you know, they took them\ntogether t-to be put on the trains, that some went, they took their eyes out, while alive you\nknow, took their eyes out, cut their tongues off. This is what her h-husband witnessed. Cut\ntheir penis off. This is what they did to -- to -- to -- to our people and th -- and th --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning of Tape Four, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number four, side A, a continuation of an interview with Cecilie Klein-\nPollak. I -- I see the photograph on the cover of your book, \u201cSentenced to Live\u201d and I\nrecognize it from the film at the Holocaust Museum.",
        "A: And this is why they put it there. They -- they took this from my cover, they made a very\nhuge -- I mean they had it also probably from the Auschwitz album, there's an Auschwitz\nalbum and this is where they -- they have this photograph from. They put this in the\nHolocaust Museum. There's also one large photograph that I am -- there are a group of\nwomen and I am one of the -- one of the women, one of the girls standing there, I don't\nknow, you probably wouldn't recognize me because, you know, so many years, but I\nrecognize myself and so they had taken this one out also and they have a display there and\nmy -- my mother, sh-she's 55 or 56 [inaudible], but she looks like 90, see? Because she had\nanjus that my brother made her and then they -- and then they chased her out, you know,\nfrom the ghetto, sh-she forgot it, she wanted to go back in, they didn't let her look for that,\nwhich wouldn't matter anyway, it was -- would have been only for a few days, because after\n-- after that, after we arrived, they killed her.",
        "Q: So this is a photograph of your mother with Danny, with --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah --",
        "Q: With Mina's son.",
        "A: Sh-She is -- she knows where she's walking, she knows where she's going. No -- no --\nnobody else -- you know why she knows? Because in the train when my brother-in-law --\nwhen those prisoners came on -- on the train to chase us out and tell us to leave everything,\none prisoner -- my brother-in-law still had a watch and he gave it t-to this prisoner and he\ntold him, \u201cTell me what's going on here.\u201d And my mother was standing next to my brother-\nin-law and me. Mina, as soon as the train opened, ran down with the child to get some air,\nbecause it was, you can imagine, traveling so many days, so many people and -- and it was\nhorrible. Th-Th-The trip in itself was -- was an absolute horrible experience. So he said, \u201cIf\nyou have children, give the -- give the children to mothers with other children, because if\nnot, your wife would -- would be killed with the child and women with children and older\nwomen are being gassed, so --\u201d And my mother heard this, she ran down and I heard it too,\nbut I didn -- I couldn't even believe it, you know? I -- I thought, \u201cThis is -- he's -- he's\nsaying something crazy.\u201d I ran down after my mother, I came over to Mina and my mother\ncame over to Mina and tells her, \u201cDarling, I just heard that women with children will have it\nvery easy, because all they will have to do is take care of the children. But young people\nwill be sent on hard labor,\u201d and she said, \u201cand I'm not well enough to go on hard labor. Let\nme have your child.\u201d But Mina even -- she didn't have a -- a clue yet what she wants to do,\nmy mother didn't ask her, removed the child from her arms. And as soon as she had the\nchild, she -- she was pushed to the side where the women with children were and she yelled\nout to me, \u201cTake care of your sister,\u201d to me, you know, because she knew what my sister wi-\nwill -- will suffer when she find out. So she knew where she was going.",
        "Q: How did you -- how did you discover that photograph?",
        "A: Actually, my sister discovered it. She -- she -- in Israel she was watching television and\nthey gave that movie, \u201cWorlds of War.\u201d Worl --",
        "Q: \u201cWorld at War\u2019?",
        "A: World --",
        "Q: \u201cThe World at War.\u201d",
        "A: \u201cThe World at War,\u201d yeah. And it flashed on the -- on the television screen and my\nbrother lived [indecipherable], my brother passed away since then and he just thought,\n\u201cOh, I hope M-Mina didn't see it,\u201d and he called right away Nathan, her husband to make\nsure that he doesn't put on television and he says, \u201cMina is in shock and -- and she saw it\u201d\nand and sh-she -- she -- that time she got -- she got a -- a stroke. I mean, she came out of it\nand -- and -- and then when she got better, she went to the television media and asked for --\ntold them. They wanted she should talk about, but Mina never -- never could talk anything\nabout it. Not only wouldn't she talk about it, Mina completely wiped out everything that\nhappened before, only that she knows she lost her child, but she doesn't remember anything,\nanything -- everything that I am telling you, about seeing these girls beaten to death, about -\n- only -- she remembers only just that I was beaten, because the only -- this made impression\nd-de -- on her. And everything else she completely blocked out. So then th-they made --\nthey gave her a big photograph and I have it a regular ph-photograph now, you know, at -- at\nhome. And from that photograph I-I gave the strudel to my -- to the publisher that I want\nthis as my cover. An-And this photograph 1s also here, because I don't want it should -- it\nshould, you know sometimes this gets stolen or -- or the other one it has a -- a cover again in\ncloths. So -- so I-I have it here, inside the book. [inaudible]",
        "Q: That's just -- that just must have been so amazing to see that photograph.",
        "A: So shattering. [inaudible]. I'm glad I have it.",
        "Q: That -- that section of the film that plays at the Holocaust Museum 1s just so powerful\nand devastating when you tell the story of what -- what happened to your mother and to your\nnephew. I wondered if -- if people ever recognized you from that film, after the Holocaust\nMuseum opened? Strangers?",
        "A: Well, yeah -- no -- no, p-people that know me recogni -- they always come and say, \u201cYou\nknow, I saw you on -- on the --\u201d B-But I'm there very little, only in the middle and then in\nthe end. Did you see the end, what I --",
        "Q: Well, even though you're not -- you might not spend a lot of time on the screen, 1-it's a\nvery powerful impact [indecipherable]",
        "A: I-I think the end I-I-I find everybody says that it's very powerful, the end when -- when I\ntell them that when they bring their children, you know, to the museum, then they will see\nall these shoes. Did you see that end?",
        "Q: Yeah, I -- I saw the whole -- I've seen the whole thing several times.",
        "A: What it means to us is one thing, what it means to other people is another thing. I-I in-\nincluded a few po-poems in my book and this is one of my poems which is in my book,\n\u201cSentenced to Live.\u201d I-I named it \u201cPromise.\u201d \u201cI shut away and locked the painful\nmemories. I begged you, give me peace, but you ignored my pleas. I saw my mother's face\nand then I heard, Celia, bear witness to our murder. I lighted a candle every night, I\ndavenned in temple and prayed for your plight. You followed me chanting the same\nrequest, tell them, tell them, or we cannot rest. Day and day I found an excuse, but you\nhaunted me always, so it was no use. I tried to describe it, but could not express the torture,\nthe fear, the hate, the distress. I'd shat at you -- I'd shout at you, please just leave me alone.\nI put horror behind me, I have a life of my own. When I hum to the children, you sang\nalong, tell them, tell them in your song. Why should the young ones suffer our pain? What\ngood if they know, what do they gain? You look at my soul with a deadly stare, if you don't\ntell them, how can they care? We must be remembered, all must know, of that season of hell\n40 years ago. Tell them Celia, tell them now. I lifted my pen, I will, I vow.\u201d",
        "Q: How did you tell your children, how did they learn about your experiences during the\nHolocaust?",
        "A: My children really learned the first time when I started to speak at schools and my son\nwas in that school, but whenever I spoke in his class, I didn't want him to be present, so he\nwas not present. But when I would have tapes and they would just go take the tapes and\nlisten to -- to them. And also, when I started to -- when I published my poems, when I\npublished my book and this is how they came to know. But not -- I will tell you something,\nevery child that lives with a survivor, knows quite a bit even if you don't talk to him,\nbecause of the way we are -- some parents are overprotective, some are fearful, some are\nvery nervous, some are sick and -- and they somehow know that -- that this is from -- from\nway back.",
        "Q: Was it difficult to -- to actually let them hear the details of what had happened?",
        "A: Not -- not as adults, now when they're adults I feel they had the formative years, you\nknow, where -- where they are done and -- and as adults and now that they have children of\ntheir own and is okay for them to know and -- and they can handle it now much better. And\n-- and also this -- a few generations removed, which we have now already grandchildren and\nit's never, you know, t-the same as -- as when it 1s -- when you live with that person.\nGrandchildren don't live with their grandparents. It's one thing to know and it is one thing to\n-- to have to be raised by -- by the parents of Holocaust survivors, that went -- saw so much,\nit's somehow, it gets to -- to your children because in many ways we couldn't do the same\nthing as the American parents did. We were more often sick, we were more often -- we\nwere, like I was away for so many years. It certainly was a bad time for my youngest child -\n- for my oldest child and I always worried what effect this is going to be on him. And -- but\nall in all, thank God that it didn't turn out as bad as I was afraid 1-it would. I'm -- I'm sure\nthat it left him with some, you know -- if he's not kirtis -- he doesn't like to appear in -- in\nfront of a lot of people, let's say, as a speaker. I can do all that, but m-my oldest son was\nalways very nervous to -- to give a -- a speech or -- or to -- but now h-he overcame already,\nbecause as a dentist he sometimes had to go to conventions and -- and -- and also speak and\n-- and explain certain methods, because he's a s -- he specialized in anesthesiology and --\nand there aren't that many in this country, only about 50, you know, that apply anesthet-\nanesthesiology in their dentistry. So he even, in fact he even told me once that h-he took up\nacting j-just, you know, for a-a-an outlet, in order to overcome his stage fright, you know?\nSo there is something always that -- I-I find that the best adjusted of my three children is my\nyoungest son. He can -- he's a very good speaker, he is -- he -- he's a -- and also, you know,\nhe's involved because he -- he was always helping cancer children, h-he was a volunteer\ncounselor in a camp for cancer children and then he would go to visit them in the hospitals\nand to go -- unfortunately to their funerals and to go and then they -- they honored him in --\nin one of the hotels and there were like 2000 people, was a very, very rich place. It was, of\ncourse, to get -- it was a fundraising, he went and he gave a speech that everybody got up\nand -- and gave him a standing ovation, it was -- all over was his, you know, on the wall\nthey had those blown up, like video of him because if not they couldn't see him and -- and\nhear him because it was a -- a huge room. So -- but he has no problem about speaking and\nI'm very pleased.",
        "Q: Tell me about your -- your second husband and also about your move to Florida\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: M-My second husband 1s also a Holocaust survivor. I feel I could never marry anybody\nelse, I don't think anybody else -- you know, y-y-you have to be able to -- to understand\neach other and -- and to live with each other and -- and h -- and he was one of the longest\npeople in -- in a camp. He was five and a half years in Buchenwald. And I-I married -- I\nmarried him three and a half years after my husband died and we are almost married no-\nnow, it's going to be 10 years. He is a very apt person and he also wr-wrote a book about his\nexperiences, I think this is what we, you know, if y -- somehow -- this is really how we met,\nbecause he didn't know how to go about publishing his book. And -- and so we had a lot in\ncommon and he's retired already 15 years, so we live partially -- a half a year we live, about\nseven months we live in Great Neck and five months we live in Florida and don't make this\n-- as a table -- we have only to talk about the Holocaust just because we are both Holocaust\nsurvivors. We usually don't like to, you know, keep this as a regular conversation. I talk\nabout the Holocaust only if -- if I have a reason for, like -- like this is a reason or if it comes\nup sometimes, of course when you are with --with friends and somehow you -- you\nremember certain things and -- and conversation leads to it, but I'm not -- I-I -- d -- I don't\nlike just to, you know, keep this as a daily menu on my agenda.",
        "Q: What do you do with your life on a daily basis now, just --",
        "A: My husband is a average tennis player, so a half a day he plays tennis. I also play a little\nbit tennis. We play bridge, we -- we go -- being that we are in a community here that they\nhave all kinds of -- I-I belong to Hadassah, we have functions, we attend, we be-belo -- I\nbelong to every organization that -- whether it's Holocaust, whether it is -- the Holocaust, if\nyou're a very big organization, it's called -- Eidnow, in fact we have big parties there to\nraise money for Israel and I-I keep busy by -- also my -- my sister, unfortunately is not\nwell, she lives a-across the street so I try to help her out a lot, I go out shopping for her, I\nspend time with my sister that comes here from Israel and is here. We go swimming, we --\nwe try to live a very -- here we have friends, we entertain.",
        "Q: Which sister lives across the street?",
        "A: The one that was once in Israel. And Mina just comes, Mina lives in Israel and she\ncomes here to spend winters with us, because her husband also died, he died two year --\nthree years ago. So sh-she -- we go there -- I go there once a year and she comes back with\nuS.",
        "Q: I just remembered there's one question a little further back that I had wanted to ask and\nyou had mentioned it was either in your book or in the first -- in the video, that you went to\nthe world gathering of Holocaust survivors, and that it made a very -- in Jerusalem and it\nmade a very big effect. Will you tell a little bit about that?",
        "A: Yes, th-this was the -- this was the first time that there was going to be a -- a Holocaust --\ns-something public, you know, a Holocaust reunion. It was called the World Gathering. And\nI-I flew to that and my daughter was supposed to come with me and lo and behold, she had\nmoved that time, because her husband had just finished his specialty as a -- as a dentist and\na root canal and she moved back from -- from Pennsylvania to Great Neck, to my house\nand she left her passport in the furniture that they had stored in -- 1-1-in Pennsylvania and\nwe came -- she came with the suitcases to my house and without the passport. And I\nremained with the tickets and with a hotel reservation and I went there myself. And this is\nwhen -- when we went to, you know, it was a very moving experience, because it was the\nfirst time that ever -- that this was publicized and that we had workshops and that we had\nspeakers and most of all that in six languages, it was handed down, th-the remembrance\nfrom -- from generation to generation and I -- when I saw those candles, it was like\neverybody lit a candles and it was like all these candles were shining as stars for the six\nmillion and it was one of the most moving and heartbreaking experiences for all of us. There\nwere people that hadn't seen each other 40, 50 years that found each other -- that was 50\nyears, it was -- I think it was all together one time. I'm not even sure, that was in 19 -- I\nthink 1980, because --",
        "Q: I'm not sure of the exact date, I think it was around '79 or '80.",
        "A: Yeah, a-around there. And after that I have -- I-I have always attended every gathering.\nThe one that was in Washington, the one that was in Philadelphia, [inaudible]\nPhiladelphia. And anything that has to do with the Holocaust I am very partial and support\nit -- supportive.",
        "Q: Did you ever return to -- to Czechoslovakia or to your -- to eastern Europe?",
        "A: Yeah, so far I-I never did. I -- to my hometown I-I-I never want to return. I never want to\nwalk those streets again, I never want to see the house again. But I would like to return once\nto visit the camps and I'm getting ready for it, perhaps -- not this year, maybe next year.\nBecause I would like to go with one of my children. So I have to wait when -- when they\ncan make it because, you know they're all -- they're all -- they have s-small children and\nlittle kids really are not yet -- I don't want them to come. But I would | -- want my adult\nchildren to come. So I hope to go next year, not this y -- not this coming year. Un-\nUnfortunately my present husband has cancer also now. But -- but he is in treatment and he\nis doing much better.",
        "Q: What is your present husband's name?",
        "A: His name -- my present husband's name is Isaac Pollak and -- and he -- we have a very\ngood life together and we each made a new life, knowing that we cannot bring back the\nspouses and we each had very good marriages before, so this 1s wonderful companionship\nthat we have and -- and my children are very happy about it, they were very supportive and\nthey wanted f -- and they like my present husband and he likes them. And we hope that our\nsuffering will -- will be the last and that a future generation will never have to experience\nwhat we had to and -- and that they will really uphold the memory of th-the six millions and\nthat they will remember not only the six millions, but they will also remember the survivors\nbecause we had -- our lives was never the same and -- and this is just part of history and --\nand so that they should know what happens when -- when such -- when such terrible tragedy\nhits our -- our -- a people and they should always remember that we are all born the same\nand we all have the right to be free, to educate our children and freedom and to worship and\n-- and this will -- may -- and if they will remember and all the nations will remember, then\nthey -- there will be a much better world for their children to live in.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you'd like to say?",
        "A: I -- Iam just very grateful that -- for the work that all of you are doing and -- and I feel\nthat you are our saviors by doing that, because if we wouldn't have people like you, then\nthere wouldn't be remembering -- Holocaust memorials because there wouldn't be -- who\nwould take care of this, so I thankful all the people that are involved.",

Y-You of course told the story about how you got to Budapest, you\nwere trying to find a way to help your sister out of prison, you thought -- had thought she\nwas in prison in Budapest and -- and you told the story of how you found her and how you\nwere cheated out of your money and -- and -- and -- and so forth and that you found a\nlawyer who agreed to try to obtain her release. I wasn't sure --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: You mentioned in your video testimony that this lawyer was able to obtain your sister's\nrelease after six months. And what I'm unclear about is, why at that point you remained in\nBudapest?",

    "answers": [
        "Answer: I was born -- my name is Cecilia Goldensile, the maiden name and I was born in\n1925, April 13. My home was Yasinna, Czechoslovakia and when I got married, my name\nchanged to Klein. My husband, unfortunately died 13 years ago. I remarried three and a half\nyears later, to my present husband, Isaac Pollak. This is why I use both my names, because\nI never wanted to erase the name of my first husband, whom I loved very much and had a\nwonderful marriage. And I was married to him 39 and a half years.",
        "A: My father's name was David Goldensile. My mother's name was Hosa Einhorn and they\n-- my father, fortunately, passed away a natural death. My mother was killed in Auschwitz\nwith her grandson in her arms. She took her grandson so that my sister should live, because\nyoung women with children were destined to be killed the same way as older people.\nThough my mother was by no means old, she was 56 years old, but this was considered by\nthe Nazis, old. Even 40 year o-old was -- were killed, had no chance of surviving.",
        "A: No, not into -- not to Yasinna. My -- my parents -- one of -- my mother came from a\nsmall town which was at the time Romania. | can't re-remember exactly, the name of the\ntown. And my father was born in Poland, but he was only two years old and he came to the\narea that was Yasinna. At the time when my father came to Yasinna, that part was not\nCzechoslovakia, it belonged to Hungary, but when I was born, it was of course Yasinna,\nby then it was already Czechoslovakia in existence, modern, since 1914. So we were taken\naway, I mean, I left Yasinna because I had to run away from Yasinna in -- in 1940, so that\nis about 26 years, was in existence, Czechoslovakia.",
        "A: We s -- our mother language was Jewish, but we spoke several languages. Is -- my father\nwas perfect in German, in fact he was teaching German and so we spoke Jewish, we knew\nGerman, Czech. And then when the Hungarian occupied us, I really had to make a crash\ncourse, learning very quickly Hungarian, which I did for just to survive, because if I went to\nhide, I had to know the language. And being I was so young and I had -- I really had an\naptitude to learn quickly languages and I learned it within a few months.",
        "A: No, Czech, Czech. There was Jewi -- there was no Jewish school, there was only, if -- if\nyou wanted to privately then you -- you went to, you know, like for people [inaudible] have\nto learn how to -- how to pray, but that was not in the schools. We had just Czech schools\nand also Russian, because in our town there lived a -- a great many, they were U-Ukrainians\nlived in our town and they lived mostly in the hills, not in the center of the town. So they\nhad schools for them also and there were some children that preferred to go to that school.\nThey had a choice, to go either to that -- to the Russian school or to the Czech school. I\nwent to the Czech school.",
        "A: Yes. It was a small town, it was about, I would say -- we -- we were -- it was only about\n12,000 occupants and approximately I would say that 50 percent were Jewish.",
        "A: Th-Th-The Czechs were very liberal and we had no anti-Semitism as far as the Czechs\nwere concerned, but the Ukrainians were anti-Semitic, however they had absolutely no\npower, because they were not in power. The Czech government was in power, so there was,\nI would say there was pretty much what you would say, harmony. We were not usually\ngreat, I mean we did not socialize a lot, but on -- just on friendly basis, to say hello. But it -\n- somehow it was that Jews were mostly socializing with Jews and it was also, you know,\nthey did not care too much for education, where we are very education minded. So there\nwould have been also a gap, as far as on an intellectual level.",
        "A: It -- as soon as the Hungarian occupied us, they implemented the same laws what the --\nwhat the Nazis did. So when they -- before -- before their occupation, the Ukrainian took\nover because the -- the Czechs had left, they -- they -- there was no Czech government any\nmore and th-they -- so we were really in peril, because they were going to kill all the Jews\nin the town. And -- so we were really very glad when the Hungarians came in because we\nthought that they are much more civilized and much more organized government, but we\nfound out very soon that this was not the case. My father was born in -- in Poland, but he\nwas only two years when we came -- when he came to Yasinna and he had Czech\ncitizenships. They took away our Czech citizenship and eventually, a few months later,\nwhen I went to Plata frip -- no, before that. As soon as the Hungarian came in -- I was 14 y\n-- not even quite 14, but -- but close to 14 and I was still in school, of course and I didn't\neven finish the eighth grade, because I was -- in the eighth grade it was like -- like here a\nhigh school, because our level of education was always very, very high. Let's say if you had\nhigh school in -- in Czechoslovakia, then it would be here -- like here two years of college.\nBecause we -- this is how they taught, because we didn't have like college and right by us --\nright after college, you -- after high school, you could go into medical school or to law\nschool. Like my brothers. They studied, one studied law, one studied a dentistry, but it was\nright after they finished high school. They didn't have to go first four years of college and\nthen four years to become a dentist or four years of college and three years to become a\nlawyer. From as soon as we graduated high school, you could go in right straight to law\nschool or to medical school. But then we -- I was -- all the Jewish children were thrown out\nof school as soon as the Hungarian came in and we were sent out, they sent me -- we could\nnot return to classes the next day, so -- so of course we had nothing to do. So one day I went\nto play to a friend's house and when I came back, m-my house was -- the door was open and\nmy mother and my sister Mina were gone. And we had three tenants in our home and they\ncame to tell me that they were taken away by the police because they had no -- they took\naway their citizenship paper, so they were considered as aliens and -- and they -- and I ran\nto the police station, but my mother motioned to me I shouldn't come near, because she\ndidn't want me to be arrested too. And there was already my brother's friend, who was a\nlawyer and he came over to me an-and he told me -- he bent down with me and he told me I\nsh -- because I wanted to go right away with my mother, I was very attached to my mother.\nTold me if I'll be on the outside, I'll be able to -- to help more and -- and I -- by then I had a\nmarried sister, so I really had this -- who to stay. And -- an-and -- and so they will take th --\naway and I remained alone, for the -- at the age of 14. But eventually, my mother got and\nmy sister, a six months extension. And this 1s -- when they came back, we had to make plans\nto leave Yasinna because in six months they would -- they were the only ones really to get\nthat extension, all the other people that were arrested at that time, when my mother and\nsister, they were taken over the Polish border, after a few months being kept ch -- in jail.\nAnd most of them got killed.",
        "A: I was the youngest of six children.",
        "A: [inaudible]",
        "A: My -- my oldest sister, name was Fran. Badushnee vas fragy. She had three children,\nages five, eight and 11. Her husband's name was Abraham. They were all killed in\nAuschwitz. Because she had children and any woman -- all the women with children were\nkilled. Her husband was in a concentration camp until -- almost til the end, but about a\ncouple of months before, they -- they drowned him in a barrel of water, which took a\nhorrible ti -- which was a horrible death, even worse than -- than his family's deaths. For\nsome minor infraction which probably was -- was nothing. They -- they were just killing\npeople at random anyway. Sometimes they killed them just out of sport. But maybe he -- I\ndon't know, maybe h -- maybe he went out an-and he wasn't allowed to go out from the\ncamp or what-whatever, outside. The f -- the reason I don't know, but the people that came\nback had told me about his fate.",
        "A: He was in various camps, but I -- a-at this point I don't even remember. This did not\nhappen in Auschwitz, this drowning. It happened in -- in a different camp. But it's so many\nyears ago, I -- I really can't tell exactly in which camp it happened, but I was told by the\npeople that had witnessed this terrible incident. My -- my brother, Haim -- yeah my sister\nwas approximately at the time when she was killed, 31 or 32 years old. My brother Haim,\nhe was a dentist and he was first in a labor camp. They took him -- the Hungarians took him\naway and he got sick and he was in a hospital and they eventually, they burned down the\nhospital with all the patients and he was one among those patients, so he was burned alive in\na hospital. And his wife, Shoshanna, she went -- she went to Auschwitz, but in the train she\nwent berserk and she had no children and she was young, she may have had a chance to live\na little longer, but they killed her up-upon her ar-arrival because they -- they -- they saw that\nshe wasn't normal. But this happens in the train, so she was killed.",
        "A: Haim was older, 11 years. And Menachim, who had a chance to also go to Palestine,\nbefore -- before -- he had been -- been -- because he was in Prague, he was studying law, so\nhe left for Palestine and he's older -- he was older 13 years than me. So actually he and\nParela, they're alive. Parela is five years older and my sister Mina was -- 1s three years\nolder.",
        "A: We were very, very close. In fact my brother was almost to me -- he took over, actually,\nthe duties of our father because I was only nine years old and my father had passed away.\nAnd he -- he arranged that eventually I was going to study in Prague when I finish the\neighth grade, because after eighth grade, you had to leave Yasinna because there was no\nhigher education. So y-you had to go -- go to a bigger city for -- we called the gimnasium,\nwhich was you know, the high school. And he -- he was always bringing me presents and we\nwere -- we were a very, very closeknit family and very devoted. I will show you how\ndevoted my brothers were, that Haim, he had also a chance to leave for Palestine because\nhe was also, he was in Prague and after that he went on a hackshara, which was a -- you\nknow, this was like a place where you were trained in -- in toiling the land and -- and\npreparing yourself to leave for Palestine where you will be able to help build the country\nand he had a -- and because he was a farshara, so he got a certificate to leave for Palestine,\nbut in-instead he c -- he -- and -- but he came to say good-bye to us and then he came, he\ndecided not to leave because he thought he'll be able to help us and he didn't want to leave\nus alone, so he stayed and -- and this is why he paid with his life, because he wanted to help\nhis mother and sisters.",
        "A: I-It -- It was Menachim and father, Menachim did also everything but in fact,\nMenachim all these years, was so unhappy because he felt that he should have been there\nfor us and -- and I kept alway -- I always had to -- had to tell him that this was the greatest\nthing that could have happened, because if -- if not he would have also perhaps perished and\nthis way at least we had a-another family member survive. But he felt guilty all these years\nand he didn't know himself how -- how to help us after the war. My -- my brothers and\nsisters and my mother, they were the whole world to me. There was no better people on this\nearth that -- that I know, even -- for instance, Mina lives in -- in Israel, but we see each\nother twice a year, because I go there every year and when I come back, she -- I-I take her\nwith me and we always -- 1-if-if one didn't have, we always shared everything. While my\nhusband was alive, whatever he bought me and if -- if they couldn't afford, he would always\nbuy for my sister, because he knew it meant so much for me to enjoy it if she had it also.\nAnd we remained like this, very devoted to each other. And therefore, I d-d -- by having my\nfamily killed, they really destroyed my life also, because even -- even when you live and\nwhen you and -- and when you have already everything, but we could never fully enjoy\nanything, because we -- we lost so much in our lives and -- and we could never -- you can\nnever get back. Can get back material things, but you simply cannot get back family and --\nand it wasn't only the family, it was to -- to watch the terrible things that were done while\nwe were incarcerated and to see people being killed so senselessly. It -- it remains with you\nthe rest of your life. The nightmares never go away. The screams never fade in your mind\nand the nights are the ones that bring everything back to us, to all the survivors. I think\nwhen I speak, I speak for all the survivors. There isn't one survivor that 1s really a healthy\nperson. But we have always lived our li-life decent. We never went out to murder just\nbecause we were murdered. We never became -- be-became criminals, just because such\ncriminal acts were done to us. We brought our children up with values, with love and with\nrespect for all humanity, for all races and because we know what it means to be a bigot. And\nthough it still today, much hasn't changed, there are people that have the audacity to deny\nthat this ever happened. We, as survivors can render them liars, because we are here as\nwitnesses. We are the proof of those atrocities that were committed. And all our loved ones,\nthey're not here to talk about it, but we are and though it is very painful for us to go back\nand to open our wounds, we're willing to do it, for the sake of future generations and\nhistory, so that our voices will be heard and those liars will be -- will be put to shame, that\nthey can yet not even repent that was done to us. Because these are the people that would do\nit all over again, so unless they are going to be somehow silenced and unless all of the\ngenerations that will come after us, will be able to prove with our testimonies that this really\nhappened, there will be many books written that people eventually will believe it because\nhow -- how -- how would they otherwise know what a w -- that it wasn't, that it was\ndifferent than what they are reading to the books? So I'm very pleased now that the schools\nare finally having programs and that they are teaching us, because for the first 35 years it\nwas utter silence. Nobody even knew anything about the Holocaust. And if somebody in the\nmovies, the -- the books that were written, read by us, will vouch by us. I-I remember that\npeople would tell me that -- all weekend, it's too painful, we cannot go to see -- that's if they\nmade the Holocaust movie or we cannot read those book, it -- it's -- it's makes us very sad. It\nwould be very upsetting to me to hear that, because if we could go through what we did,\nwhat we had to go through, then can't you at least watch it, can't you at least familiarize\nyourself? We couldn't even talk about it because -- because it was so painful to us and\nbecause we had to rebuild our lives and because we wanted to have a normal life. As mu --\nas much as we could have a normal life ourselves, but people don't even feel like to -- to\nknow about it. So finally, they have now Holocaust memorials that -- that people can take\ntheir children to -- to show what -- what bessiality was conducted on human beings. And\nwhat can I add to this except that -- that we hope that this will never happen again and if\nyou have any questions that would like, you should -- you should ask me and I will tell you,\nif you want to know about my -- my life after, then -- then I will tell you about that.

        "A: I had no paper -- I had no papers. I could never go -- go back to my hometown, my\nhometown was Yasinna. My sister went back to my hometown, to her children, she had --\nshe had three children. And by then her husband was -- was, not any more with her, they --\nthey took him to a labor camp. And he never came out of that labor camp. This was the\nhusband that was eventually killed so brutally wi -- that he was drowned in a pail of water.\nBut Is -- told mys -- but I went at night, I -- I went at night to my sister's house. I -- I wrote\nthis in fact, in my book and -- and we spend -- I spend there -- I arrived at night and I spend\nthis of 24 hours and -- and left again, just -- just to see her once again and this was the last\nthat I ever saw of my sister. And I had to remain in Budapest because this was a big city\nwhere I could, you know, lose myself where -- where -- where -- and I was -- I didn't even\nlook my age, so I-I hoped that I was not going to be picked up and asked for papers, but\nonce I-I did, I mean I was picked up.

        "A: I -- all of us in Budapest, without paper, actually that -- hiding, but not like some people\nwere hiding, you know 1-in one room or were behind a wall. I was also hiding, but I had to -\n- I could walk the streets and if I would be, 1-if they would ask me for papers, I would be\npicked up. But I still had to also look for some work, because I needed to live and to -- and\nto pay rent. So first I -- I worked in many different places and then finally I got to work in --\nI got a job in a dental laboratory, because while I -- when Menac -- when my brother Haim\nleft and he was the one that helped us all along until -- until they took him away, he made\narrangements for me and my mother to leave for Vimiritas, which was a big city in\nHungary and made arrangements where he used to send his dental work, in to that\nlaboratory, that I should learn to become a dental technician, to be a-an apprentice. So I had\na little idea, I had some idea about dental -- dental technician work. I wasn't yet -- well, I\nmean I wasn't proficient in it, but I knew a little bit because I -- I only learned like eight\nmonths. And after that I had to leave f-for Budapest, hoping that I can help my sister out of\nthat jail. So I tried to find work in a -- a laboratory, but for awhile I couldn't and eventually I\ndid find work in a -- I was accepted in a laboratory and my husband -- my fianc\u00e9, who\neventually became my husband after the war, and to say good-bye to my mother, who lived\nwith my sister and whose -- she also had no papers, but that's why she was not in our\nhometown, she was with my sister and was with Mina and she showed them my picture.\n[inaudible] this is my beautiful daughter and she is working in a dental laboratory where\n[inaudible] because we were like distantly related like sixth cousins removed maybe, you\nknow. But my mother knew his father and -- and anyway.

        "A: I -- about -- close to a year. He -- we worked in the same laboratory.",
        "A: No, he left a much better paying job, because he w -- he was a full fledged dental\ntechnician and I was just so-so. I didn't know that much. So h-he left a better paying job to\ncome to work in that place where I worked, only that he should be near me, because he fell\nin love with me very, you know, much sooner than I fell in love with him, because I was so\nhomesick for my mother that all I could think is, you know, my mother, my sister, I -- I\ndidn't pay that much attention yet, to boys.",
        "A: No, we -- we -- we had planned t-to get married, but not before the war would be over,\nfor it was something normal times. But eventually the -- the Nazis came into Budapest\nbecause they felt that the Hungarians are not doing, ar-aren't doing enough against the Jews,\nthat they're not sending them out quickly, I mean because porty somehow the -- the --\nwasn't willing yet to -- to -- to send them out, to -- to take away their businesses and -- they\ndid things to -- to the ones that didn't have papers, but the ones that were born there, they\ndid not, they left them the businesses and they left them -- they let them stay in Hungary.\nThen the Nazis came in and they did [inaudible].

        "A: A few weeks later.",
        "A: In the ghetto? We were in once -- one room. We were -- my family, my -- my sister,\nmyself, my brother-in-law, their -- their baby and one more family and some slept on -- on\nthe floor because we didn't have enough beds, on -- and we were very crowded, we would\nget -- food was being -- there was like a kitchen -- I'm sorry -- and everybody also brought\nth-their own food, prepared. We had -- my mother made a lot of like toast, you know, they\ncalled it sweebark, what can stay and dried noodles and whatever we could -- that wasn't\nperishable and we brought it with us, so for awhile we still had our own food, and after that\nis -- there was from the -- I -- I can't remember exactly, h-how was th-the food situation, but\nsomehow everybody still had something what -- what to eat. And we would play with the\nchildren, we organized a -- like play groups and we -- we -- we tried to teach them Hebrew\nsongs and we -- we would sing to them and -- and we would -- we would just -- th-there was\nno -- nothing cultural, because nobody had any -- we didn't have that -- too many books, a\nfew toys that people would bring for their children or -- or children's books. But we were\nhoping that -- everybody hoped that this will not last long and that eventually you know, we\nwill all return to our homes. Nobody really believed that we are going to be exterminated.\nEverybody still hoped that, even when they -- when we heard that people were taken away,\nwe thought that they were placed in, say a -- an -- they would say a campfire, you know on -\n- in a camp or -- or that they were taken for work or -- nobody believed that this -- that this -\n- in the 20th century, that they would really kill women and children. Because my sister had\na chance to go in-into hiding. I had a chance to go into hiding, but I didn't want to go into\nhiding with his -- my fianc\u00e9's family because I wanted to stay with my mother. So he went\nback to his family and I stayed with my mother and my mother wanted very much I should\ngo into hiding, because she was not -- I guess my mother did believe that may -- you know,\ncome to -- to that -- that we may have -- not be able to survive. But we were too naive and\ntoo -- too optimistic to believe that this will -- can happen. So my sister didn't want to --\nagain, nobody wanted to leave each other and that's what -- why we stayed together and\nnobody went into hiding. And with a little child, would have been really impossible to go\ninto hiding. But for instance, my mother could have gone into hiding with me, with -- with\nmy fianc\u00e9's family but she refused and I refused and in a way, we didn't -- I-I was glad I did\n-- I didn't go into hiding because then I would have always had this, you know, I would have\na guilty conscience, thinking that maybe if I would have been there, maybe I could have\nbeen of help. And this way I know that there was nothing that anybody could do to help, not\neven for the closest and for the most loved one in the families. Now my fianc\u00e9 and his\nfamily did go into hiding and they hid also a lot of other families and the rabbi with his\nfamily, because my father-in-law was very wealthy and he gave a lot of money for the\npeople, you know, that -- that hid him. And then, they -- what they did is, eventually they --\nthey went to the authorities and -- and gave them out, after they had taken everything away\nfrom them. So -- so they were yet brutally beaten before they send them to the -- to the\nghetto and then -- and then they send them to Auschwitz to be killed. So there was no --\neven the ones that were -- were in hiding were not safe, that they would survive.",
        "A: No. Nobody was working, we were just really -- nobody was working and you really had\nnothing to do and we were just marking time. And -- and this was really still my -- my\nhappiest time while I was in the -- in the ghetto because I was with my mother, I was with\nmy sister and -- and her family. I mean, not with my sister the one that was the three\nchildren, but with Mina, because we were not in the same ghetto, my sister was in a\ndifferent ghetto and we were in as -- different ghetto. And so she was killed with all her\nchildren and my mother had a chance to save my sister by -- by taking h-her child. And of\ncourse you never get over losing a child. My sister didn't even want to live aft-after she\neventually knew what happened to her child. And she always made herself, she always\nthought that maybe mother would have survived, th-that mother got killed because of her,\nwhich that's not true because mother could have never survived, they would have taken her\nto the gas chambers even without her child. But it -- the point is, sh -- I can't convince my\nsister because she is s-so determined to feel guilty about it. And she was very, very sick and\n-- and she could never have -- and the saddest part is that she could not have any more\nchildren. She had only that one child. And I loved my sister so much that I always told my\nhusband that I'm going to have one child just for my sister, to give it away to her. But of\ncourse, you know, til you don't have a child, until you're not a mother, y-you don't know that\nyou really can -- cannot do that. That no mother can give a baby, a -- a child. And it was not\neasy for me, I-I don't have my children, the three children by choice that they are 10 years\napart, because I -- I was very sick and I-I-I couldn't have children and I -- I -- it's --when we\ncame out, we were always very sick, my sister and me.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: In the ghetto, yes, but not -- but of course after that, not even -- I didn't even keep kosher\nafter I got liberated. One -- partly because of being re-rebellious about what happened,\nbeing very mad at God and -- and just not -- and also partly because we -- we were so\nhungry that we would eat anything, we were -- we starved for so many years and -- and --\nand you -- you just ate whatever you could get. But eventually I turned back to galichin\nwhich we will come to it if, you know, in my interview, I will -- I will explain why and how.",
        "A: Yes, because my mother was very religious, I would never have done anything to hurt\nmy mother's feelings. I was even observant while I was in Budapest with-without my\nmother and even then I was so hungry, because I did -- I didn't have enough food and -- but\nI would never eat non-kosher, even there. I-I ate just -- sometimes I lived only on bread and\nmargarine and I would buy myself, for like five cents, a cookie, because I remembered my\nmother would say, \u201cDon't eat sweets before dinner, because you won't have -- you won't be\nable to eat.\u201d So I thought, \u201cIf I'll eat a cookie, I wouldn't be so hungry, because the sweet is\ngoing to -- to chase away my hunger.\u201d But unfortunately it didn't. I -- in -- in the camp, I\nwas always so sorry. Why didn't I at least drink more water, because you know, we couldn't\njust drink water whenever we want a drink. We suffered a lot of thirst and -- and -- and I\nalso would buy myself lot of clothes, then -- dapootib because I would tell myself, if\nI will be shabby, then I -- somebody will ask me for papers sooner, because I will be more\nobvious if I look shabby. But -- so I would buy myself, rather -- let's say a skirt or -- or -- or\nwhatever, something to wear or shoes. And -- and not food. And then I was so sorry, why\ndidn't I -- hadder, buy myself food and -- and not starve so many years already in\nBudapest. But you know, when you are young, you want to look pretty and you rather not\neat.",
        "A: [inaudible] from May until end of October. May, June, July, August, September.\nOctober or -- or even November. I think it was end of October, approximately, because I\nwas in -- in Nuremberg in -- in [inaudible] January, February, March. Yeah, end of\nOctober. I mean, I can be, you know, it-it's hard to remember the -- the exact date and -- and\nyou -- you wanted me to describe h-how -- how I left --",
        "A: I remember standing in front the gas chambers [indecipherable]",
        "A: No. No, that isn't -- wasn't -- no -- no -- y-you couldn't hide in -- in Auschwitz your day\nstarted at 4:30, you were chased out of the -- we were thousand in one stable and 10 in each\nthree layer bunks. We were standing say lappelle as soon as we got -- as we were chased\nout. We didn't have to dress because everybody slept in that one dress we had. We had only\none dress and there was nothing under, we had no -- no panties, we had no slip, just that one\ndress. In that you slept, in -- in that you wore and eventually became infested with lice.\nCompletely with lice and -- and this was eating you up. So the min -- every minute that --\nthat you had free, when you were in the bunk, you would take off your dress and you would\ntry to -- to get the -- the -- the lice out, which was a futile job. But we would stand for hours\nto be counted because to count -- there were 30 such barracks, they had to count 30,000\nwomen, all women. And if one was missing -- and if -- if she was missing, it was only that\nshe went to the electrified wires, to kill herself, then -- then you would stand so long until\nthey -- until they -- they found the corpse or they would think you know that somebody ran\naway, which was no -- no chance of running away. People only worked -- the ones that\nworked were either in the kitchen, and I wasn't lucky enough, you know, to be -- to be\nchosen to work in the kitchen, or they worked by -- which -- they -- that was called Canada,\nwhere they sorted out the clothes and all the stuff that were brought in by the -- by the\npeople that arrived on the trains, because everybody came with a suitcase of something. An-\nAnd some people had valuables still, I mean hidden, like I -- we had hidden in one bar of\nsoap, large diamond earrings. But we threw away the bar of soap, because when -- when we\narrived and they took us to the shower, you know, to be showered and we had to un-undress\ncompletely naked and they shaved us all over and -- and they said, if every -- you cannot\nhave nothing with you -- you have to walk in just completely naked and you will not get\nback your clothes anyway, so I was afraid to have that cake of soap, so I threw away the\nsoap right there and -- and I -- and I had nothing. But eventually, no they -- they took all\nthese things and they were looking for, you know, for -- for valuables and people had sewn\nin and some had in clothes, sewn in something, you know. So they had people working\nsorting out and -- and finding and also taking away the clothes, which was eventually\nshipped to Germany. So, this kind of work. And then some may have worked somewheres\nelse, but -- but in Birkenau say lager, where I was, nobody was taken for work. They were\n-- always made selections, who each went straight to the gas chambers, or sometimes they\ndid select, but you never knew what a t -- they selected to take for work deep into Germany\nor whether you were selected to the gas chambers, so the block avdest always told us, don't\nel -- volunteer. If you're taken, you're taken, you have no choice, you know? So we were\ntold not to volunteer and we didn't volunteer. But we always knew when they were taken to\nthe gas chambers, because then they t-taken the people th-that they were selected to the gas\nchambers, they would make a ring, from the oneth of the remaned and this is how they took\nthem to the gas chambers, nobody should get -- I'm sorry -- nobody should be able to run\nout from under that ring. And it -- as you read probably in my book about that girl that ran\nout and -- ballerina that I wrote a b -- poem about a ballerina. She was beaten to death\nbecause she was -- she ran out.",
        "A: [inaudible]",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: [indecipherable], that's right, it was just like a miracle, because Mina was -- was in such\na depression, she -- that she didn't want to eat and there, noth -- you killed yourself, I mean,\nto get -- to get the food. People became completely dehumanized. We were called the two\ngood sisters because we took care of each other. And others were stealing from each other,\nw-would eat up ea-each other's food. And this never happened, you know, between me and\nmy sister. I would -- I would force oo -- er -- mouth open and put in the margarine, you\nknow, it -- it should melt because in order that she should have something in her and I\nwould change my piece of roosh, because sometimes one get with the brudder roosh the\none, I got margarine, but everybody wanted the roosh, not the margarine. I would go and\nchange my roosh, which was such a, you know, big deal to receive that slice of cold cuts\n[inaudible] for a piece of margarine so that I should be able to give her my margarine plus\nher margarine, it should go down her, you know, it should melt and -- and she'll swallow it\nand she only wanted to go and kill herself on the electrified wires, so I-I always kept a tab,\nyou know and always was able to talk her out of it and yet, when -- when I became so ill and\nyou see, you were not allowed to talk to German -- to any Nazi. You were not allowed to\ntalk to an SS. You -- he could kill you if you were only -- th-that was like hierarchy. The\nblock gelderstad could talk to him. There was only who could, you know, talk to whom.\nAnd -- and then I was so ill and -- and the train, this SS was eating an apple and she went\nover and she said, \u201cPlease, could you give me a piece of apple for -- for my sister,\u201d because\nshe didn't even know that she is not allow to approach him. And he slapped her so hard I\nwas just happy it wasn't a Nashis, because a Nashis, he would have killed her. There, on the\ntrain, he only gave her such a slap that sh-she flew all the way to, you know, to the other\nside of the -- of the train. And -- and this is when I told her, you know, was all -- you were\nnot also allowed to divulge if somebody was sick, because if you were sick, then you were\nnot of any value that y-you could possibly still work. Then they killed you anyway, you\nknow, so nobody would be divulging to an SS that somebody is sick. They -- they, this was\nalways the biggest -- the biggest worry of -- for each of the prisoners not to be sick and if\nyou were sick, you never admitted that you were sick. If you were dying, you -- you came\nout to stand say lappelle. If not you were right away dragged off to the gas chambers or\nsometimes for one, they didn't even drag you off to the gas chambers, they would just beat\nyou to death right there. So I -- I -- I told her and then, to my sister that she should never,\nyou know, do that and -- and she even took off her coat, you know, to cover me because I\nhad a high fever and -- and somehow it just, it really, it -- I think whoever is alive, it 1s\neither way, by sheer miracle. It -- It wasn't because one was smart or one was, you know, so\nbrave. It was that sheer luck and -- and also of course, you have to have -- you had to have a\ngreat will to want to live. And this I -- I certainly had. I was so determined to live. Because\nsomehow I thought just because nobody knew, you know and we -- we were so completely\nunaware of what was going on and I thought that the whole world is like this, nobody\nknows. Som-Somebody must come back and -- and tell, you know, what happened. But we\nfound out soon that it was just -- it wasn't ignorance, it was just complete disregard and\nunwillingness on the part of the rest of the world, that they should want to do something to\nstop this killing and these murders. Nobody cared what is happening to the -- to the Jews.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Sh-Sh-She -- She eventually became, you know, more or less like me, that -- that she was\n-- that she -- they took her to work, so sh-she worked, just like me and -- and she was -- she\nwas eating and, you know and she was -- she -- but she was much more fearful than me, I --\nI was much more, you know, trying organize, organize meant there, a nicer work for\nstealing, you know. To steal, let's say, if -- if we went to dig out potatoes for the -- for the\nGerman -- for the Germans, for their kitchen, let's see, I would try -- before we left for\nNuremberg, so everybody got a coat. Top o -- besides that one dress, we got a coat and my\ncoat had a hood and that hood saved my life. I -- we went to the kitchen, I-I mean they took\nus -- that was done on Sunday because during the weekday they wouldn't waste the time that\nwe should go to dig out potatoes for the German kitchen, but on Sundays, that we shouldn't,\nGod forbid, have it too easy and -- and to relax, so they would take us either to dig -- this\nwas a vety -- everybody wanted to go to dig up potatoes because you saw that you had a\nchance, you know, to eat a potato or -- or to steal a potato and bring it in and we would eat it\nraw because this was no -- no problem, th-that we had to cook it, we thought this is the very\ndelicious food. So we went that Sunday to dig potatoes and I dug some potatoes and I took a\nfew and I put it in the tip of my hood, not in -- in the pockets. Somehow I don't even know\nwhere my -- that I -- I was so smart to do that, not to put nothing in the pockets, but in the\nhood and it was cold, so it was okay, you know, nobody would think why I have the hood\non. And -- and Mina back me, \u201cDon't do it,\u201d because she was afraid, I shouldn't be caught\nand two other sisters took also some potatoes and they put them in the pocket. They didn't\nhave a hood, they had pocket, so -- so and -- I saw Mina so afraid, so I didn't even let her\nstand with me, I said, \u201cYou know what, you're not going to stay with me,\u201d because I was\nafraid that she would keep looking at me and that -- that her looks and her fear shouldn't\ngive me away. So I told her I'll stay in the front and she'll stay in back -- in back of me with\nanother, these other girls, because if she'll be in the front, she's going to turn around always.\nSo I didn't want all that should happen. So as we were going in to the camp, they started to\nsearch everybody's pocket and they came to those two girls who had pocket, who had\npotatoes in the pockets and they made her -- them throw out the potatoes on the floor and\nthey beat them, they were already half dead. They beat them so much that we never saw\nthose girls again, I mean they killed them. That -- they took then four girls, two girls had to\ntake one by the foot and by -- by the head and -- and two other girls, to carry in those two\nsisters to their headquarters and they were never seen again, they killed them. And that --\nbut while I watched this, how they are beating them and the screams and I think okay, this 1s\ngoing to be now my finish. Why didn't I -- I listen to Mina? But they search my pocket, I --\nI had nothing in the pockets and I came in with those potatoes. This made such an\nimpression on me. First of all, we ate those potatoes and my sister said they taste like norts.\nI said I -- they taste like apple. And -- and -- and I even shared, you know, some with\nwhoever was under -- under bunk and -- and I always wondered, because you completely\nlost the normalcy, why didn't we ever eat raw potato at home? I made up my mind, I said to\nMina, \u201cYou know when -- the first thing I'll do when I get home, I will eat all the potatoes I\ncan buy.\u201d Never even thought, you know, potatoes have to be cooked, I'm going to cook\nthem first and eat them. \u201cMina, we will eat all the potatoes.\u201d It made such an impression on\nme that when they broke open already our -- our camp to liberate us, you know, the\npartisans and they broke open the ledgers and everybody was running to the ledgers to get -\n- to get salami and bread. I ran to that field to dig out raw potatoes. And Mina had sense\nenough, she ran and she brought a bread and a salami and she looked all over for me, she\ncouldn't find me, but she thought about those potatoes and she came and she found me\ndigging there, a whole bunch of potatoes. And she said, \u201cCecilie, we don't need those. We\nhave -- go and get -- get some --\u201d I said, \u201cNo.\u201d I said, \u201c I don't budge from here til you don't\nhelp me bring in those potatoes.\u201d She -- she helped me bring in those potatoes. And by the\ntime I came to those ledgers, nothing was left. So luckily that she had a -- a bread and -- and\nI'm just saying that how our whole thinking -- how everything changed, from normal and to\nbecome -- t-to think differently, to taste -- our tastes were different. Our -- our whole\noutlook of life was different. I w -- I would tell Mina, the only thing that I wish if we are\nliberated is -- an-and I completely discounted everybody, only me and Mina, like nobody\nelse exists any more, that we should have one room to ourselves, just me and you and have a\nradio -- for some reason I craved music. And -- this was my biggest mission, that's all -- you\nknow, I couldn't even think any more of the rest of the family, whether anybody is alive,\nbecause I never really, you know, thought that anybody 1s going -- lives and that we will -- I\nnever thought that we will be a -- remain alive. I thought -- I built somehow, a world for\nmyself, just me and Mina in it and -- and some music and -- and -- and all the rest\nsomehow, I never even thought any more about my fianc\u00e9, you know, like having -- like\nhaving aspirations, I want to become this or that or -- or -- or get married or -- or have\nchildren or -- just me and Mina to live and outlive our -- our lives, just the two of us. Ina\nroom by ourselves with music. And of course, life goes on and all this changes.",
        "A: No, no, this -- not. Memories only that -- that never leave me 1s -- oh -- oh, what\nhappened -- is a lot I-I cannot bring back. All this I-I know was just a certain hallucination.\nI mean about being just two in a world. And -- but I am -- but I am very glad that I -- Iam\nalive, because -- because there was a time that I -- I didn't want to live, even after -- after the\n-- I mean I -- twice I attempted suicide, wanted to kill myself.

They were very, very important and\nsomehow as each child that was born, I feel a n -- their name is -- is -- and then I call my --\nmy -- like, the last child that was born now, to my youngest son, she's named after my sister\nand after my mother. It 1s like -- like they're here again, you know. And -- and I still -- I -- I\nwas able to be somehow like a witness. I was able to -- to write two books, I -- I was able to\ncontribute something that I think 1s -- 1s worthwhile. I -- my children are wonderful human\nbeings. They're all professionals. They -- they all, you know, they never heard me say that\nyou have to hate anybody or -- or they, I mean what I feel is something else, but because to\nhate is self-destructive. It's -- you -- it's self-destruction because if you love, then -- then\nyou love only -- not only yourself, but you can love other people as well. And to love is so\nmuch, you make the world so much better than to hate. But the damage that was done to us,\nI can't love everybody because there is a society that -- that does not deserve to be loved,\neven though, let's say they're children and it's not their fault, but somehow it wasn't -- we\nwere children also once, and we didn't do nothing. Our parents never did anything and we\nwere s-so destroyed. I mean, the thing is -- the destruction is, that though I -- I could afford\neverything, thank God, because my husband was, I mentioned, very successful and -- and\nwe did a lot of traveling and we did a lot of, you know, charity and we -- we help a lot of\npeople, my husband was very charitable. But whatever I did, wherever we went, I could\nnever fully enjoy. I -- I remember we were in -- in Spain and it was my anniversary and my\ndaughter wanted to s -- help and came specially. She was already engaged, she was going to\nget married. And she came to celebrate my anniversary -- we're very close with my children\n-- to celebrate my anniversary and to spend the vacation with us. And we went in the very\nbeautiful restaurant by the ocean and I -- I'm always very sad inside. I can -- I can smile but\nI can never really laugh, you know. Like I -- I envy people if they laugh ha ha, you know,\nreally loud laugh, never in my life after, I could not, no matter -- no matter what joyful thing\nhappened to my life. And then came in a whole table and they spoke German, so they were\nfrom Germany. A whole --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: I-I will tell you of incid-incident that how I can enjoy everything what is offered to me in\nlife, because of what happened to my family. And ber -- back -- and also what happened to\nus, because then you'll see that -- that when you know, that all the fam -- most of your\nfamily was killed and -- and when you remember the screams of all those people that I\nwatched being killed and beaten to death, you always tell yourself, \u201cHow can you enjoy\nnow, you know, how can you have a good time?\u201d Now here, what happened I -- I was with\nmy husband in Spain and he wanted we should celebrate our anniversary and my daughter\neven joined me, she flew down to be with us, because we are very close to our children and\nshe was engaged, she was getting married, so we thought she should have just one vacation\nstill with us alone and as we were sitting and -- in that beautiful restaurant, right by the\nocean, a group of German people came in and -- and they were so happy and they were --\nthey were singing and they were -- and they were having such a good time and here I felt so\nsad in my -- and my heart was so heavy and they reminded me of the difference -- how my\nfam -- how -- how I feel and how my husband must feel and -- and after all what happened,\nhow they are feeling, how -- wh-what a -- how -- how happy they are, how they can enjoy\nand how we cannot enjoy anything, even though we could have now everything. And -- and\nI just couldn't even finish my meal. I told my husband and my daughter I-I have to get out of\nhere, because I-I have a headache and of course they knew right away that it's not a\nheadache why I am getting out of there and my husband -- I made him just pay and leave the\n-- the food there and we went home. And as I was coming back to this beautiful hotel that\nwe were staying and by the swimming pool I went out and I just -- and I wrote a poem,\nbecause the only relief I would get when I would be very depressed and -- and would think\nof wh-what happened to my family, that I memorialize them in my poems. And -- and I will\nhave to read to you this poem I wrote in this beautiful resort place, instead of enjoying it,\nthis is what -- what -- how I felt and this is what I wrote. \u201cOut of the Ashes.\u201d \u201cFrom our\nashes, we'll rise up and cry out to the world, on our ashes you are treading and make you\nface your guilt. Our ashes will remind you of our gruesome past. We will fill your pols with\nashes and refuse to let you rest. Our bones will make you oerswel, of our tortures they will\ntell. As your salty tears will flow, we'll strike back for every blow. By your children, you\nwill be called to task. \u201cWhy did you kill them,\u201d they will ask. Your children will bear the\nshame, you the parents they shall blame. We will tell them that we were human too. We\nlived, we laughed and loved like you. And rejoiced with our children in being a proud Jew.\nFor this we were slain. To kill us all became your goal, though our flesh was dying, you can\nnot -- you could not kill our soul. When you burned us to ashes, a little spark was left. The\nlittle spark rekindled into a great big flame, a great new generation out of it came. This new\ngeneration was sent forth to win our land. They fought for it bravely and build it up from\nsand. To this land, our ashes were taken, put gently death to rest and our children walk\nproudly, for we have Israel at last.\u201d",
        "A: I -- I always, I wrote -- 1-1f I'm -- 1f I'm made a birthday for my children and my -- my\nfamily couldn't be there, I wrote a poem. If my -- and at my first wedding that I made to my\nson and my family couldn't be there, I wrote a poem. This is somehow, I think how it keep\nme sane. The -- the outlet that I had in being able to -- to express myself. And I -- I manage.",
        "A: I wrote poetry, yet -- wh-when -- the first poem I wrote is when they took my mother\naway. That time I wrote in German -- in German and Czech. And then I wrote even poetry, I\nhave a whole stack of German and Czech poems that I didn't have pencil and paper, but I\ncomposed it in the camp, when I was in the camp. And this actually saved my -- my life\nalso. I don't know whether you read about it in the book, because -- because the -- the block\ngeldest, she considered me like a talented child. I wasn't a child, but I looked like a child.\nAnd -- and some -- and she knew that I write poetry. I mean she never gave me a pencil and\npaper, but she would tell me that if I have a poem, I should come and tell it to her. And so --\nso that when they would make the selections, you know, for the gas chamber, eventually she\nwould hide me. In one of the blocks, they had a whole big block -- a block is those stables,\nyou know an-and -- and but we were living, but they had one that they kept just for blankets,\nthey would se -- collect those blankets and then ship them to Germany. So when they\nwould come to select for the gas chambers, the people that were already deteriorated and I\nwould, by then already was a candidate, she would hide me under those blankets, me and my\nsister and when the selection would be over, she would get me out. So that's really how I --\nshe really is responsible for s-saving my life, not to be selected because of those -- because\nof poems. But of course, eventually, when I knew English, I wrote down in English, because\nyou cannot really translate poetry, it loses in translation. It's only that when I wrote a book, I\nhave that one -- one or two German poems, so I -- I just wrote a few lines that I -- in\ntranslation, but -- but this is -- these poems I wrote all after, you know, after I know better\nEnglish and so I -- I -- and by each time, that made me very, very sad, [inaudible] I wrote a\npoem. If I'm happy, I don't write. When I'm very sad --",
        "A: Yeah, with my husband? Oh, yeah, I sh -- I shared all the poems, yeah. In fact my -- my\nsister -- I never even h-had intentions of -- never even thought of publishing it, but my -- my\ns-sister, I always sent her the -- the poems so and so and my brother, so they -- they wanted\nto surprise me, so they ask me so -- so they had all my E-English poems and they wanted t-\nto publish them, they -- because it was published in Israel. So nobody would publish\nnothing that I wanted to publish here, so -- and I -- so -- but they wanted to surprise me, but\nthen they didn't want to surprise me because they thought in case I have something that I\nwant to add, you know? So they let me know that they want to publish it and I -- that a -- I\nwant to send them something. So I was glad, because this way, I -- I wrote, you know, like\nwh-what I wanted to write, to add to it, about each member of the family, I -- I added and I\nstill had a -- a couple of poems that -- that I added, because here it -- it gives just an outline\nabou-about my brother, you know, about each member of the family, I-I wrote something, so",
        "A: This one is? I -- I published, \u201cPoems of the Holocaust\u201d is the title and then I published\nmy memoirs, which is \u201cSentenced to Live.\u201d And -- but --",
        "A: This was -- this was published -- first it was published about 20 years ago, but since then\nit was published twi -- you know, what my sister and brother published, was not -- it -- it\nwas a very rough publi-publishing, you know? It was not by any particular publisher. It -- it\nwas somebody that had, I guess, a printing -- a printing int, they printed it up and put a\ncover on it. But then somebody has seen th-the poems in Israel and he asks permission to\npublish it. So thens he pulb-published it, you see, in 1988, no, in -- in 1985 and then he\npublished -- he sold them all out and he published them again in 1988. So it's -- it's 10 an-\nand -- and 13, you know, he publish it -- but -- but they were published already, like almost\n20 years ago, the -- the first. And he already since then published a few times more. Cause\nhe sells them all over, he sells them in England and the United State. I just, sa -- I just have\nnothing o-out of this, in fact I buy m-my own books back from him, you know, when I'm in\nIsrael, I buy and I give them to -- out to friends or -- or -- because I -- I didn't want to, you\nknow, hear nobody was interested to publish it. I mean, he doesn't have th-the rights or\nanything, I -- I have the rights, but I-I didn't try, even. Because once I -- I -- I send up a\npoem and they didn't even publish it, so -- or -- or I got back that it's too sad, something like\nthat and after that I -- I wasn't in the mood even to -- to make an attempt. So it's like -- it's\nthis being read and being sold, I -- that this is not from what I want to make money anyway,\nso, you see, th-th -- from this I could have and I gave the royalties, in fact I -- I even gave a\ndonation 10,000 dollars, to have it -- you know to help publish this book, because the --",
        "A: \u201cSentenced to Live,\u201d yes, because it was published by Olaf Kisibery in New York and -\n- and I didn't have th-th-the money and -- and they were after me, they want to -- my book to\npublish and I -- because I -- I really was going to publish it with -- this was another\npublisher that -- that was interested and wouldn't have cost me nothing, but then I felt I want\nit in a place that is -- has some -- some sentiment to me, you know. They were only\npublishing books from Holocaust survivors and make -- I wasn't interested in the money. So\nI -- I gave them a donation and they published it. And then -- and -- and they closed out,\nthey -- they actually -- the Holocaust Memorial in -- that hall ifine -- Washington, bought up\nthere all the rights and all the -- the books and they started to sell them and being that we\ndid have a contract like for royalties, I -- and they wanted to sell me, I-I wrote them a letter\nthat they don't have to send me and I -- I am donating it, it's all theirs, they can keep the\nmoney. So they always send me, just the end of the year, just to see how m -- how much\nthey sold and their little touch about the, you know, the amount that they are selling. And\nnow they wrote me that they don't have any more, that they're thinking of ra -- and even\nfrom them, when I order, I-I pay my own books, and because | -- I want to -- there should be\nenough left, you know, if it's not going to be ever printed again, or whatever.

        "A: That was Sudetenkabete. That was Sudetenkabete, you know, that was part of\nCzechoslovakia. And this is where --",
        "A: This is where we were liberated.",
        "A: Yeah, okay. We were locked in, in the -- in the barracks and we didn't know why,\nbecause usually they would come every morning and they would t-take us out, even though\nthe factories were already bombed and they didn't have any work for us, but they would take\nus either to dig ditches, or to clear rubble, take from one place big snowstorm, another\nplace, only that, you know, that we should be doing something which 1s -- which is very\nhard wh -- especially when you are in such weakened conditions. What -- this was another\npart of -- another way of -- to torture us. So -- and w-we had no idea why we were locked in,\nwhy they didn't come for us. Everybody was very apprehensive, but you know, whatever\nwill be, will be. Nobody knew what's happening. What they did is they -- they were running\naway because the -- the British were supposed to come and liberate us, but that was still\nthree days away and they knew that they h-have time, you know, still to -- to accomplish\nwhat they want, which was -- there were three camps, of which we were unaware, we only\nknew about our camp, about the Jewish. Jewish, a Polish and a French. And they were going\nthat night, when we were -- th-that morning when they locked us in, they already left their --\ntheir headquarters and they were already in the woods. But, at the -- you know, in the\nwoods, from where th-they were going to run away, but they came back to eat lunch. And in\nthe evening, they -- they had planned to burn down our camp, with -- with us, with -- with\nall our --the -- with all those living, th-those three camps. So what they did is, they had\nsurrounded each camp with wooden logs and soaked them with a certain lighting fluid. And\n-- and they came and they were going to do that in the -- at night -- in the evening and then\nrun away completely. So, but they came back to eat lunch. Meantime, one of the --\nsomebody send word to the partisans, th-that this 1s going to happen, somebody that knew\ntheir plan, which was, we understand, one of the women SS, she was from Czech -- she was\nlike a mixed marriage, from Czech and German parents. Either she wanted to save us, or\nsave herself, that I-I -- we will never know. But she had betrayed this plan and therefore the\npartisans couldn't -- didn't want to wait for the, you know, so the partisan surprised them\nwhile eating lunch. They took all the SS, they -- they -- they broke open our camp, they\nbroke open the ledgers. When they broke open our camp, they showed us how our -- what --\nwhat the plan was, it was still smelling from that fluid that they were going to commit this\nmurder. In fact, they even said that whoever wants, can go and do whatever they want --\nwhatever we want to those SS. Some went and -- and cut their hairs off, you know, but I --\nbut I -- I told you what I did, I ran to the -- to -- for the -- for the potatoes. And -- and we\nhad -- one girl was dead because she got killed just a day before from the bo -- from a bomb,\nyou know. And as they were taking us already to -- to that rubble and they started to -- the\nbombs started to -- to fell, so they told us, everybody should drop to the floor. We all\ndropped to the floor and when we got up, this one girl was dead, she was maybe 19 years\nold. So we had a dead body in our -- in our camp. So we first asked them, you know -- well,\nfirst of all when they came, you can't imagine what we -- we -- first we got scared, we didn't\n-- you know, they didn't have regular uniforms. One had a green jacket an-and black pants\nand one had just civilian clothes and -- and one had an army coat and one had -- th-they --\nthey weren't like a -- an -- an -- an army, but then they started to speak Russian, you know\nand -- and th-they couldn't -- th-they were absolutely shocked. Everybody was so excited\nand crying and -- and we first asked, you know, we want to give her a burial, so we first --\nwe buried her right there. In -- in -- in that courtyard. And they told us that they have to -- to\nleave, they are taking with them, the -- those -- some they killed, I'm sure. No, I don't think -\n- know whether they didn't kill all, but I da -- I don't know what happened to them and I\ncouldn't care less wh--what happened to them. But we were afraid they should leave and we\nstarted to beg them, \u201cDon't leave us, but maybe there are some still hidden in the -- in the\nwoods and they could come and -- and hurt us.\u201d So they said, \u201cDon't be afraid, we -- the --\nthe French camver all man,\u201d this was a man's camp. They are leaving arms with the French\nand they will guard ours and the -- the women's c -- the two women's camps and in a few\ndays they told us, the British will come and liberate us, you know, formally. And -- and th-\nthis is what really happen -- how it happened. So those few days we had what to eat because\nthey broke open the ledger and I certain -- had enough potatoes to last me for -- for a -- for\nmonths. And -- and then when the -- when the British came, they put up a regular kitchen\nand they -- they made those regular meals, but we were so -- without any discipline and\nwithout any, you know and -- and in such fear, all this, that we -- that we will not have what\nto eat, it was so imbedded in -- in our minds, that when we would come to -- to the meal,\neverybody would take -- would want to take the bowl with them, because this was a very\nimportant tool, cause we were afraid that we are not going to have that bowl and -- because\nthis how it was in Auschwitz, if you didn't have that one cup that they gave us, then y-you\nwould have been starved, because you wouldn't even get that -- that one, you know, the meal\nwithout the one -- the soup what we were getting once a day. So we would all take it out the\nbowl, because we thought that we are hungry, we will go in now, into the village to ask for\nfood, you know. And they would beg us, they would say, \u201cYou have to leave,\u201d yeah, th-the\nspoon, we would take everything with us. \u201cYou must leave it -- because if not, you're\ncoming back tomorrow, we won't have what -- what to give you.\u201d Nobody listened. It was\nlike talking to the wall. So what they would do, they would station themselves in the front\nand like for children, they would say any more, anything, don't take. Because they knew we\nare taking it, they would take away from us, the -- take it away and that was a repeat, every\nsingle day, until we got used to, know -- you know, until we saw that we getting normal,\nthree -- . Yeah, they would always beg us, \u201cDon't go out and eat, you know, anything else,\u201d\nbecause -- because our bodies were in such a state, that by eating too much or -- y-you\nwould get sick and you could die, because our resistance was so low. We had people that\ndied because they -- they went into the village or went you know an-and got food that was --\nthat they shouldn't have eaten. An-and they got sick an-and died. \u201cJust eat what we give\nyou, we give you nourishing food and -- and you will always have enough, you know and\nwe cannot give you a lot at one time, but -- but as you build, you're going to be built up and\nyou're going to stay here as -- as long as you need to be.\u201d Because nobody was in any\ntraveling condition. We stayed there at least four weeks, until we could travel. And then\neverybody got a -- like a voucher, you know and it was what -- we could travel free and\neverywhere. And everybody wanted to go back to look for some relatives. Our destination\nwas to go to Budapest, because this is where I was last and we had made up with my\nmother and you know, with -- with fam -- with the family that whoever survives, we should\ngo and look for each other in -- in Budapest. But -- but we -- I-I never g-got actually. I-I\nmean I eventually got to Budapest, but what happened is that when we were -- when we\nwent back, already after the -- the camp, a-after we were already able to travel and we got\nsome -- they gave us also some money to -- to have, you know, like if you want to buy\nyourself a drink or -- or, you know, something. So we -- we could travel free everywhere\nand we were -- me and my sister, we were going a-around away to Budapest. And at\nPrague the train made a stop and the redcoats was giving out sandwiches, so I went down to\ntake a sandwich from the redcoats for me and my sister. My sister stayed in the train. So it\ncame over to me a -- a young man who recognized me and he -- everybody would come to\nthe trains to see whether, when the trains would come in with -- with refugees, they would --\nactually we weren't refugees, we were ex-prisoners, would come in, they would come an-\nand ask whether we have seen this one or that one, you know, to get information that\nsomebody is alive. And -- and this young man came over and said, \u201cAre you,\u201d that I am\nJoe's fianc\u00e9, he recognized me. I said, \u201cYes.\u201d He said \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cJoe is here, in -- in\nPrague. He's alive and he's in, it's called Harrick,\u201d that was also where you went for\nrecuper -- to recuperate. They had places for people to recuperate. He said that he -- he used\nto go every day to the trains, but he stopped going because last time when he went to the\ntrain, he was told that -- that me and my sister, that we were killed. That -- because we were\ntaken, we were really on the way to the gas chambers at one time, I mean before we went to\nthe -- to the -- to Nuremberg. But th-they, th-th-the gas chambers were full, so they --they\ndidn't want to wait hours, so they had a transport to -- to take the next day, you know, for\nwork. So they made us switch, they took us for work and they took th-that transport that was\nsupposed to go to Nuremberg to the gas chambers. That's why we remained alive, but\nwhoever saw that -- that transport going to the gas chambers, told them that we were killed.\nSo my fianc\u00e9 stopped going to the trains. So he told me that -- that I should -- that he's going\nto take me to where my fianc\u00e9, so of course I went there right away to Mina and told her we\nare not going to Budapest, Joe is alive and he -- and he took us to where my fianc\u00e9 was and\nthis is where we stayed again, like four weeks.",
        "A: But the thing 1s this, that I still had never -- I told you something, that there was\nsomething very dead in me, you know? Nothing, you know, completely alive. I was very\nhappy that he's alive, but I -- I couldn't even think yet, like in the terms of fianc\u00e9, that this is\nreally somebody that I'm going to live my life with, you know? I di -- I wasn't yet -- I didn't\nhave yet all those normal -- normal feelings. But of course I was very happy just -- just to\nknow I'm -- I'm not alone, you know. That I have somebody, that I have somebody that --\nthat belongs to me. And what's -- what I want to just show you the -- the -- how -- how one\ncan become, from a very, you know, the way we were brought up, that you never touch\nsomething that doesn't belong to you, or -- or -- or you were -- we were brought up to give,\nnot to take, you know. Only to do charity and to help others an-an-and m-my mother was --\nwas such a charitable person, we -- we had three tenants in our house, they were so poor and\nwe are -- were certainly not rich either and not even one paid rent because they didn't have\nmoney, my -- my -- here you would be on the street if you don't pay rent. These three renters\nwere living all these years without a cent paying rent. So here, now here so -- this gentleman\nis taking the names, you know, registering me and my sister and he sees the name\nGoldensile, you know and he says to me, \u201cYou know,\u201d he said, \u201cI had a very good friend,\nMenachim Goldensile,\u201d who's my brother, \u201cwe were studying law together.\u201d They were 1-\nin law school together. He said, \u201cIs this any relative of yours?\u201d He is asking me. I said,\n\u201cThis is my brother. In fact he's in Palestine, you know.\u201d Because he said, \u201cWhat happened\nto him?\u201d I said, \u201cHe's in Palestine and -- and he's thank God alive.\u201d He said, \u201cOh,\u201d he said,\n\u201cyou know, everybody is allowed to stay only here, two weeks, but you can stay as long as\nyou want and with your fianc\u00e9.\u201d And he is so happy that his sis -- you know, Menachim's\nsister is there. And -- and he brings us and makes a beautiful cake, you know, like a\nwelcoming and -- and t-to celebrate and -- and brings wine and -- and brings us the best\nfood and every day comes to visit us and -- and is in seventh heaven that, you know, that he\ncan help us. But after four weeks, my sister says, \u201cI don't want to stay here any more. I -- I\nwant to go and look for Nate.\u201d Nate was her husband, you know. She knew that the child is\nnot alive, but maybe her husband is alive and so she wants to go -- we should go to\nBudapest. So I said, \u201cOkay, we are leaving, we will leave then tomorrow.\u201d And the bed had\nvery good blankets and we have nothing, we are just, you know, we -- we have nothing, we\ndon't own anything. So I said, \u201cYes, oh, you know what?\u201d I said, \u201cBut you will stay, we\nrowed the stairs, like a hotel, you know, it had a few flights. I said, \u201cYou and Joe go down\nto the front, I will throw down the blankets and then I'll just walk out,\u201d because I was afraid\nhe will want to take us to the station if I will say, you know, we are -- this way we are going\nt-to the subway, we go over the subway, he would have driven us to the station. Without\nsaying a good-bye, without saying thank you, just throw, I threw down those blankets and\noff we went and never thinking -- oh my conscience didn't bother me, y-you know, here -- I\nam -- I am stealing here blankets, I still called it organizing, I was still camp, you know, th-\nthat if you need something, y-you -- you have to get it because you can't be without it, y-you\nwant to survive. I'm still -- on that -- on that survival mission, you know? And what do you\nthink, we come to the train and -- and we -- we cover ourselves, by the time in the morning\nwe wake up, no blankets. Somebody else took them away. Th-This 1s -- this is what was\nhappened. Until we got -- we got completely, you know, normalized. Until we became\ncivilized. We were -- we were not civilized. I -- I would never believe that -- that somebody\ncan take away everything from you, you know. That you can become a complete different\nperson. That's why, when people, you know, even our own people that were there, that were\nin charge, were brutal and -- and were -- and -- and were beating and -- and doing all\nhorrible things, that prisoners themselves, to other prisoners, I only could understand after --\nafter those blankets and after this that -- that how I had changed also. Then I sort of said,\nthese people were already there four years, they had nothing -- they had only their lives,\nthey had nobody and they had any more, there were no feelings. You have no feelings,\nnothing can bother you. Killing becomes like -- like you would kill a chicken and you -- you\njust want to eat a chicken. They could kill because they want to live. And -- and -- and --\nand I will never, never blame those people that were made into those animals. I blame those\nanimals that made them into animals. Because only them, because I-I know how a person\ncan change and that is only my experience, but never to the -- I never changed to the -- that I\nshould be able to hurt somebody. I -- I changed to this, that I should not respect somebody\nelse's property, that's what I meant. But if you can do that and maybe years later you can --\nyou can do more. You notice that? This is -- this is what my -- what I assume. So anyway,\nnow we are already on our way, because I know you want the life after, okay? Now we are\non our way to Budapest and luckily, my -- with Joe an-and without those blankets and now\nwe atrive to Budapest and my sister knows -- has a cousin for -- to her husband in\nBudapest and sh -- we arrived at his cousin and her husband had arrived the same day on\nthe -- the reason we didn't see each other is, but he was traveling on the roof of the -- of the\ntrain, you know, because people were -- were -- it wasn't normal times and we didn't have\nenough -- transportation was very scarce, so whoever could go into the train went into the\ntrain and who couldn't go into the train was traveling on top of the roof and he was traveling\non top of the roof and he arrived the same day -- we came on the same train. And this is how\nmy sister found her husband. We were maybe the only two people, that I found my, you\nknow, my fianc\u00e9 the day I arrived to Prague and she found her husband the day we arrived\nto Budapest.",
        "A: Nathan.",
        "A: He was a dentist. Oh, he wh -- where he was? He was also in concentration camp, he was\nin -- in many, in Auschwitz -- I'm sorry, in Auschwitz an-and in many different ones. I-I\ndon't know exactly now the names.",
        "A: Joe was in -- also he was in -- in Auschwitz and he was in -- he was -- just a moment, I\nhad it here someplace even, written down, cause he was in quite a few camps. He -- he was -\n- he was working as a -- he was a dent- technician, but he was working as a locksmith. I\nmean, you had to say something that you are and somebody told him he should say he's a\nlocksmith, you know? So they -- because if not, then -- then they could -- they thought that\nthis is what they need and they let him -- then they let you live for awhile, until you are able\n-- able to work. So he was in --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning of Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: At one point -- is it -- 1s it going again? [inaudible]",
        "A: No, yeah but -- but it -- towards the -- towards the end, when they would take either on\nmarches, you know, they would take on death march or -- and whoever survived the death\nmarch, survived it an-and who didn't -- if -- if you couldn't walk, then they -- then they shot\nyou. So 1-1-1t -- this -- what happened to Joe was that they were on a death march and then --\nit was already, it was winter and they had -- they had, yeah, in Buna, he was in Buna, that I\nre -- I remember. They took him on a death march and many that couldn't walk, they shot\nand then they took them to a train and they told everybody to run on the train. Whoever\ncould run up, was on the train -- it was cattle train, it was open. And whoever couldn't run,\nthey shot. In fact, one was a very good friend of his and a very religious guy and he was so\nhopeful that, you know, that he is going to survive and he gave them so much courage and\nso much, you know, hope. And he was by the train, but h-he couldn't get on quickly and --\nand the SS shot him. But anyway -- I'm -- I'm sorry -- on that train, they were traveling w --\nin the open wagons, in the open cattle trains, for many days and -- and Joe went completely\nout of his mind and he wanted, h-he thought he s -- that he has wings, that he wants to fly\nand he wanted, you know, like to jump out, but he had a very good friend in the camp. You\ncould only survive, either you had somebody in the family, like a sister, or you made\nyourself or you became a friend with somebody and that one looked out for each other, you\nlooked out for each other and that -- they were like two brothers. If his friend wanted to -- to\n-- once, to kill himself, because his -- his brother died, so Joe kept him from, you know,\nfrom running to the w -- whatever he wanted to do. And -- and now, Joe -- when Joe was t-\ntrying to j-jump off the train, he saw all of a sudden that -- that he 1s getting up and his\noutstretched hand, he right away realized that he wants to, you know, jump, so he -- he\npushed him back and he sat on him. He s -- he s -- he pushed him down and he sat on him,\nliterally and he had like a lit -- a -- he had a cup -- a cup and with the cup, he -- the cup had\na string and with the cup he took a little bit snow, you know, he let it drop, for snow and he\ngave Joe, you know, like snow to, like to revive him, to get more to his senses and -- and --\nand he -- he saved his life. And they saved each others lives. Anyway, when Joe was\nliberated, he couldn't -- he had typhus and he couldn't walk, he -- he only walked on all four,\nyou know, like -- like an animal, h-he couldn't stand up straight, but he survived and he was\nin that Harrickton, there he got, you know, he recuperated and -- and -- and we arrived to\nBudapest, Mina found Nathan and -- and Joe wanted to get married, so we got married in\nBudapest. Our -- we had, of course, nothing. We had -- we had no wedding a -- we -- we\nwent to, first of all to a rabbi, that made just, you know, ack -- I don't know, you wouldn't\nknow, probably, but a canopy, you know.",
        "A: A hoopa. Oh, you're not Jewish, so I-I assume you wouldn't know much about our\nreligion, but anyway, h-hoopa and -- and -- and of course we went also to the, you know,\nlegally we got married. We had no -- no -- we had -- we didn't have what to eat, the -- h-her\ncousin made -- we -- I had to fast because our religion tells us to fast that day. At the\nwedding was only my s -- my sister, in fa -- it was very comical because we went by s -- by\nsubway and my husband had a -- he had a nice suit because he went back home and he\nretrieved some -- something, but he had those heavy boots on, you know? And in the\nsubway, he meets a friend and he says, w-we are going to the hoopa, by subway and he\nmeets a friend and he says, \u201cOh Joe, you're alive, oh I'm so happy.\u201d And Joe is so happy\nwith him and he even forgots -- and they are so excited with each other and I have on this --\na white suit that borrowed my sisters -- her brother-in-law was hidden, so he had a little\nmoney, so he bought for my sister a white suit, so my sister borrowed me the suit and I w-\nwith some bob -- pins, hooked up, you know, that skirt and everything was falling off me, a\nb -- a big jacket that didn't fit me and somebody lent me a little white hat with a little veil\nand this is how we traveled to that hoopa and he asked Joe, Joe asked him, \u201cWhere are you\ngoing?\u201d This guy says, \u201cOh, I'm going to somebody's wed -- to a wedding.\u201d He asked Joe,\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Joe said, \u201cI'm also going to a wedding.\u201d \u201cWhose wedding?\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cMy wedding.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cthen I'm coming to your wedding.\u201d J-J -- so Joe said\n\u201cFine.\u201d But this guy tells him, \u201cJoe, these boots -- 1 -- in these boots you are getting\nmarried?\u201d He said, \u201cWell, I don't have any shoes.\u201d He said, \u201cOkay, we'll change.\u201d He had\nshoes, so he gave him the shoes. He ga -- his boots, he gave him the shoes and everything in\nthe subway and just -- it's comical, because the wedding's a time [indecipherable] my\nchildren, you know, in this -- now, this is my wedding. And -- And now we have already the\nhoopa and -- so this cousin made -- made food -- she prepared food for everybody else that\nwas in our wedding co-company, these three people and for us she made a piece of fish and\nthat was -- after I fasted the whole day, that was a whole food. And we had no money to go\nto a hotel for our wedding night. Mina had one room, with whom I stayed, you know. So we\nput -- took a white sheet, a sheet that we split the room in half so that one bed is here and\none bed is there and this was our wedding night and all the time I'm just thinking how\nhungry I am. So you can imagine how romantic this wedding night was but -- so there -- this\nwas our wedding, but --",
        "A: I -- I was very shattered at the hoopa, that -- that -- that nobod -- you know, that my\nfamily 1-is -- is killed and -- and I was just thinking about th-the wedding that my sister had,\nyou know, when -- at home when she got married and it was a very sad day for me, but --\nbut you know, the -- the feelings right now, th-this -- this is part of -- of this -- this process,\nth -- that w-we still have to be hungry, at -- at our wedding night, we still can't even afford,\nyou know, to have just a little privacy, just to have a -- a room to ourselves and -- and this is\nhow we -- we stayed -- we stayed there for a -- awhile, because we had to -- they thought of\nmaybe was the working a little bit, but then they -- they couldn't get work, so -- so we went\n-- they went back to our -- Joe went back to his hometown, because they had hidden, you\nknow, like some valuables and they were well-to-do people, but they had houses an-and\nfields and all that, but everything somebody else took away and when -- when he came back.\nSo he thought he will bring back something and meantime, before he went, we went to\nCzechoslovakia to see where we could live, you know. T-T-To get -- because I never want\nto go back to my hometown, I wouldn't go back to his hometown either, but we went,\nsomewheres not far from Prague, like we lived in Varstow for awhile. So we went just to\nfind out what the situation is, wh-wh-what we can get as far as, you know, I-living quarters\nand -- and job, but w-we came back to Budapest f-for my sister and -- and Nathan and Joe\neach went to their hometowns, to find -- to see what -- what they can salvage, what they can\nbring back, you know. Maybe they can sell something and get some money. When Joe came\nback, the maid was living in their house and she didn't even -- she didn't even let him in. He\nsaid he wants just to go, you know, to go up to the attic, j-just t-to look for -- to see\nsomething in the attic. She wouldn't let him go up til her husband doesn't come. And after\nall -- h-he -- they had lots of fields and all that and I'll bet he could make -- he couldn't go in\nand sell nothing, because in time the -- this became Russia. The Russia took this away, this\npart. And in fact, they didn't even let, want to let him go back. They -- he was afraid even to\n-- to go in, you know, once he felt it -- to go up with him, because what happened was a lot\nof people got killed, like in Poland, I don't know h -- 60 people at one time they killed,\nbecause they came back to their hometown and they -- and they thought they're going to get\nback their -- they didn't want that they should go ask back for the properties. They -- th-they\nhacked them to pieces. So he wasn't going to get himself killed over property. All he wanted\nis just to go back already, but the -- th-th-they said, the Russians th-that occupied, said that\nthey need dentists there. Th-They -- by them, dental technician, dentist, everything was --\nwas to them the same, you know? They said, \u201cOh, you're a dentist, [indecipherable].\u201d \u201cNo,\nno, I'm a dental technician.\u201d \u201cOh, that's the s -- it doesn't matter, we need you.\u201d He said,\n\u201cAll right, then I go -- I want to go back for my wife.\u201d \u201cYou tell your wife to come here.\u201d\nThey wouldn't let him go out -- go back. So he had to -- he had to steal himself away, over\nthe border and -- and it took him weeks and weeks and we didn't know what happened to\nthem, until they came back. So they finally came back and Nathan came back also, also\nback like that -- th-they had to steal themselves back. And we came to -- to Czechoslovakia\nand there they gave us -- everybody that came t-to Czechoslovakia, especially to the part,\nSudetenkabete, that the Germans had taken away all -- all the housing, you know, from --\nfrom the Jewish people. They took away their housing, they send them out -- they took the\nGermans out and they gave us a very nice villa, without -- we didn't have to pay nothing. I\nmean, to live in.",
        "A: Varlensdorf, Varlensdorf. So my sister, you know, we both shared it, she lived upstairs,\nI lived downstairs and we even had one kitchen, I'm sorry -- we didn't have like she cooks, I\ncook. I was the one to go shopping, she was the one to cook, I didn't know how to cook. My\nbrother-in-law was a dentist an-and my husband was a dental technician. So first they both\nworked for the -- it -- it is like you have here, like there 1s socialized medicine, you know?\nSo he worked -- my brother-in-law worked as a dentist and he got a salary and my husband\nworked -- did the technical work and they got of course, salaries. Me and my sister started\nto work also, we worked -- each got a job in -- in a bank. And -- a-an -- but then I -- but then\nwe became both, very soon too, she became very sick and I became sick. I had tuberculosis,\nwhich I didn't know, you know and -- and she had some internal, what was -- running such\nhigh fever that everything in -- in her had turned upside down and she had operations and\nshe almost died, she was -- very few people sur-survived it. I forgot the name of that illness.\nAnd I got pleurisy fluid, so I was already then sent to a sanatorium and I had -- I -- and then\nI became pregnant and I had -- very soon I had my son, my first son. And -- and this, my\ntuberculosis became worse, apparently from -- from giving birth, so they send me again to,\nyou know, to -- to get well, but there they didn't have medications, they only, bed rest, you\nknow and -- and fresh air in -- in the high mountains, so Mina was taking care of -- of Peter\nwhile I was away. Then I came back and -- and eventually, my husband had here an uncle in\nthe United States, so he sent him papers and -- and we came to the United States and my\nsister went to Palestine, because we had there my brother and sister. In fact I also wanted to\ngo to Palestine, but my husband wanted to come here, because he said that here -- here the\ntechnical work is far -- far more advanced than in Czechoslovakia and he wants to have this\nexperience and -- and he has the only -- he has one uncle that he would like to meet.\nMeantime, we had a very, very bad beginning here, because when I came out, when we\ncame back -- when we came here to the United States, who -- who didn't have relatives?\nThere is a hires, you know, an organization that helped the refugees bring over and they\ntook care of them until -- until they got a job and housing. But if you got from a relative,\nthen the papers, then they were responsible for you and you couldn't get any help from them.\nAnd we -- we could not even though we had Czech money, but the Czech money had\nabsolutely no value and we couldn't bring out nothing. W-We came with -- wi -- that\n[indecipherable] -- we converted, we had 13 dollars. Th-That was all our -- we -- we had\nstuff like clothing and you know, because, from working we -- we could buy that in\nCzechoslovakia, but we didn't have money. So, with clothing what can you do and we had\nbrought out crystals and things like that, but this has no value. So when we arrived, we\nthought, you know, we're arriving and somebody's going to be waiting for us. And here, I\ndon't speak English, my husband doesn't speak English. Yes, no was our vo-vocabulary. We\ns -- we spoke five other languages, but -- but not English. So any -- then we arrived, this --\nwe happened to have an Italian tax -- taxi driver. We have -- you look -- my uncle had five\nchildren, all married -- not even one came to -- to wait for us. And when we arrived, we\narrived on -- on a ship that was -- that they ditched already, I mean that was an army ship\nand they -- w-w -- it was their last journey, they -- they were not going to use it any more.\nSO we were even, not together th-the whole time and my little boy, who was two years old,\nwas -- got sick and he was sick the whole time on th -- he was in the hospital in -- on the\nboat the whole time and a-a -- we were -- my husband was sleeping on the floor on -- on --\nin one bicabo hold, you know, it was just on the fl -- on the floor, on -- on mattresses. And I\nwas Sleeping with a -- with a whole bunch of -- of other women. In -- in -- in the other hold\nwas chickens, it was a-- a terrible journey and -- and we arrived to Halifax and from\nHalifax we had to take a train that was more than 24 hours and luckily we still had money\nfor the train, plus 13 dollars and when we ar-arrive to the -- to the station, you know, wh-\nwhere the trains are arriving and we are looking for any of our relatives being to pick us up,\nnobody showed up. Nobody came t-to -- to wait for us, so we had to be two car -- we had an\naddress, uncle's address, so we took a -- a taxi and this is an Italian guy and he doesn't speak\nand we don't speak Italian. And we give him, just we show him the -- the address and w-we\n-- we looked a sight, was, you know, we were sitting up so many hours and tired and -- and\nthe child is sick and -- and he comes with us to Brooklyn, this is where my u -- where my\nuncle had a -- a very beautiful house. That time that was in a very fancy neighborhood in\nBrooklyn. And -- and somebody and we ring, ring, no answer, so the neighbor, he knocked\non the door, the Italian guy knocks on the door and she said, \u201cNo, the Kleins left for\nFlorida, they're not home, they w-we-went away for Florida.\u201d They know that we are\narriving the next day, they get a cable, none of the children are waiting for us. The -- his\nuncle picks himself up with his wife and leaves for Florida and -- an-and because he didn't\nwant to be bothered with -- with -- wi-with refugees. That is his nephew, his brother's son.\nBut he gives him the address of his son's office in Manhattan, he's a very rich man, I mean\nhe was in -- he's a real estate ma -- th-the uncle, in real estate an-and he has an office in\nManhattan and his son has an office. So he gives him the number, I mean th-the address\nand here I'm only worrying, with those 13 dollars, taxi -- how we going to pay this -- this\ntax1? I was afraid what is going to be w-without -- with the, you know, how are we going to\npay for all that? But he came to -- comes, takes us to th-the son's office. The son has the\nkeys from this house, from the uncle's house because he left them, the keys, that we should\nmove in the meantime there and hoping that by the time he comes, we'll be -- we'll\ndisappear, we won't be there. So -- and we -- th-th-the son gives us the key and tells the tax1,\nhe paid the taxi and tells us that his father will -- lef-left us the keys and they will come and\nvisit us in the evening. Never even asked, \u201cHow are you? How was the trip?\u201d H-How -- an-\nand we come, there is nothing to eat, you know? And we -- and we had those 13 dollars.\nThis is -- this is with what I'm going to -- to live in an empty house with -- with a sick child\nand with people that care so much, that never came even to -- to wait for us.",
        "A: I was devastated. You know, you arrive -- I remember that this was the worst -- one of\nthe worst times aft-after concentration camp. Th-Th-The complete disregard, you know.\nBecause we were always so friendly, mine, w-we always helped so much, you know? We\nhelped for -- for strangers, I'm telling you that three tenants lived in our house, ever -- never\nto pay rent. My mother used to cook more food than -- than she needed to bring down to the\ntenants children because they were so poor. And here, relatives, after losing everybody, I\nmean they were not ignorant, they know wh-what happened. They -- they know that the\nfamily was killed. They are not anxious to see, they are not interested to -- to see somebody\nan-and -- and cheer up those people, to know we are here for you, I'm glad you survived?\nThat's why we couldn't talk about th-th-the past. Who cared? If -- if relatives don't care? So\n-- so my husband also was absolutely -- he felt terrible for me more, because I -- I wanted to\ngo to Palestine. I -- right away -- he told me, see? You wanted to, this is where you wanted\nto come? I wanted to come where my family is. This is family? There must be silica, there\nmust be a reason why my uncle left, maybe he's sick, maybe -- he was funny, he was an\nunusual, wonderful, good person, my husband and he still believed that there -- there 1s a\nreason. But eventually he even -- b-but now we are anyway in a situation that we don't even\nhave -- have money w-we want to go to -- to Palestine. So he said, \u201cD-Don't worry, I have a\ngood trade and I will get a job,\u201d and -- and he was trying, you know, to do his best to cheer\nme up, but then th-th-these -- these -- his children came and I had such -- I mean I never had\nfelt any more animosity than -- than for this family, who could treat us so shabbily. But\nthere was another part of the family, th-that we just got to know that were very kind people,\nthat were not, you know, th-they were not rich and they couldn't help us financially, but --\nbut they -- at least they were -- they -- they helped us, you know, with a nice word. They\nwould say, \u201cDon't worry, every beginning is -- 1s very tough and -- and you'll see that\neverything will turn out good\u201d But this whole other family, you know the -- all those\nchildren, they just came, saw us, good-bye and -- and left and here we are with those 13\ndollars from that time. So I would go and buy for us, for 25 cents, a lung, because that was\nthe cheapest, so that I could buy for my child a lamb chop, you know. For him I tried to buy\nan orange, a lambchops, you know, that -- that he should have what to eat. He was very sick,\nI have no money for doctor and my -- that other family that I told you that they were very\nnice and kind would come an-and -- and -- and visit us and -- and my husband was trying to\nget a job, but h-he couldn't -- 1-it was very hard to get that time a job as a dental technician\nand we cannot get nothing, you know, to the hires. So there was another cousin that she --\nshe lived in -- in Allentown somewheres. So -- no -- so-somewheres on -- in -- in the\ncountry. And so she came once and she brought a big package of food an-and brought --\nbought stuff and filled up my Fridgidaire. And -- and helped us that way. And th-then, m-\nmy husband, no matter how he tried, he couldn't get a -- he couldn't get a job. So he s -- he\nwas sure that when his uncle will come, he has connections, he will -- he will get him a job.\nBut as soon as -- as his uncle -- finally his uncle arrives and his uncle tells him, in no other\nterms, he said, \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI thought by the time I'll come, that you will have moved\nout and that you will have a -- a job.\u201d I said, \u201cLook,\u201d I said, \u201cHitler wasn't kind enough to\nsupply us with money, so -- and that we could move out,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd,\u201d I says, \u201cyou send\nus papers, we had no way of getting, you know, of getting into the hires.\u201d I said, \u201cBut we\nare not going to stay here.\u201d And I told him and I called up the hires and I-I told them my\nsituation and I told them, \u201cLook, we haven't got wh-where to be, I have as -- m-my child is\nsick, we have no job, we haven't got where to be. You -- you helping for so many people, I\nwant you to come through an-and help us also.\u201d They said, \u201cWell, they're really responsible,\nbut since your situation is that, you know, bad, then you have to -- if you sign that you are\ngoing -- that we can send you wherever we want, that you're not going to stay in New York,\nbecause in New York is very difficult to get jobs and New York is very difficult. We have -\n- we placed already too many people. It's easier for us to find you something in Dallas,\nTexas. And if you sign that you're willing to leave New York, then\u201d -- because all along,\nbecause I had contacted them already and they said -- told me the same thing, but I -- but my\nhusband said, \u201cNo, let's wait for the uncle,\u201d he -- he wanted to stay in New York. Joe\nwanted very much to stay in New York, so I -- I said, just finally said, \u201cI am going to sign\nanything they want.\u201d And -- and we left and we told them, \u201cWe sign, you can send us\nwherever you want.\u201d They gave us right away a room in -- in das hotel, was a -- a very\ndilapidated hotel, but they had there all the refugees in -- in one place and they had a -- a --\na dining room for us and we could have three meals and -- but they -- before they -- so I\nsigned, but then they said to me, \u201cYou know, you have to go to the doctor, because you need\nto be examined and you have to be in perfect condition and we send you, that you're\nhealthy.\u201d And when I came to the doctor, the doctor gave the -- this -- t-told -- t-told -- g-\ngave the report that I have tuberculosis and that I have to be hospitalized, it is dangerous for\n-- for my child and that I need to carrior test and I was positive. That I cannot be send no\nplace and so they couldn't send me away to Dallas, Texas, so instead they -- they got me\ninto a sanatorium and of course my -- the worst nightmare was for me that now I have to\nleave my child, you know? And he has to be placed, he had to be placed in a -- in a home.",
        "A: He was born December 28th, 1946 and we came in 1948, on his second birthday,\nDecember 28th, 1948. He was exactly two years when we arrived.",
        "A: [inaudible], no I was very inexperienced and I didn't, you know, think of that there was\nsuch a thing of -- of using birth control, because at the time I really -- I -- I wasn't really -- I\ndidn't know really how to be yet, a good mother. I was -- not only was I too young, because\nI was young, I was 20 when I married and I was -- and I was 21 when I had my -- my son.\nAnd -- and I-I was not yet -- I didn't have enough yet, life experience. I mean, that -- that I\nshould know to be a -- to be a careful mother. My lot was that Mina had already a child, so\nshe bathed the child, she -- she -- she handled him. I was afraid t -- I let her do everything\nand she was very happy to do everything for the child because she missed so much her child\nthat she sort of -- she almost had a nervous breakdown when I left with my child, because it\nwas like taking away her child. Her husband had to -- to put away -- to hide all the pictures\nbecause sh-she didn't stop crying. She'd stop -- didn't stop crying for me also, but even more\nfor -- for Peter. Peter didn't even know wh-who's the mother, he had two mothers. I was the\none to -- to dress him up nice and to go with him for a walk and she was the one, you know,\nto -- to nurture him, to -- to give him the best, to feed him, to, you know, t-to do the things\nthat -- that the mother is -- is supposed to do. To play with him. I brought him one day and -\n- and I left him because I also saw that she has so much, you know, she comes so much alive\nwhen she is doing that for Peter. Because also, when she moved away, eventually my\nbrother-in-law got, after another dentist, a very nice -- for himself, an office th-that he didn't\nhave to work for the -- you know, for the socialized, he could do private work for himself.\nAnd so they had a beautiful house with a -- with an office and it was a -- a couple of miles\naway, a few miles away. So my sister always asked me for her -- for Peter and I would\nalways let -- like really he was more w-with my sister an-an-an-and I was -- my -- my\nhusband liked very much to go to -- to those soccer games, you know, there -- it was a big\nsport and s-so I -- I always went with my husband, you know and I -- and I let her have him.\nAnd then when he came back to me an-and then, of course, we took him always back. But\nthen when I left, she was left with a very, you know, s-she was hurting a -- a lot for my\nchild. And -- and Peter didn't care either way, because Peter loved us both, he -- we were\nalways both with him together. But I'm just saying that I was not yet a really responsible\nmother, you know? This came - this came later on. But of course I loved my child, this was -\n- to me this was a miracle when -- when he was born because you know, it was -- he was\nmaybe w -- the first children born after -- after the -- the Holocaust. So then, when -- when I\nhad to -- this was a-an absolute nightmare, I-I couldn't -- I-I said to them, \u201cNo, I am not --\nI'm not going no place. I cannot -- I'm not going to leave my child, I have nobody to take\ncare of.\u201d They said, \u201cLook, what do you want, you want,\u201d you know, the doctor spoke to me\nand also th-the ones from hires. \u201cIf you love your child, you don't want your child to -- to\nget infected and -- and then he will get sick also. This way you will cure yourself and -- and\nwe have homes for children.\u201d So they -- they took me to see the home where he's going to\nbe and that he will get used to it and -- and so when -- so we came to that home and I took\nhim still the first time back, you know. And they let him of course play and with toys and --\nand with other children. And then I came back and then I-I -- I came the day that I had to\nleave and we went back to that home to leave him. And I remember there was one girl, that\nshe -- she liked him very much, right from the beginning, a young girl that was helping with\nthe -- with the children. And he was -- he was a very, very beautiful baby, he was very good\n-- th-the baby, I-I mean he was two years old. He was very advanced, he spoke, but he -- he\nspoke only Czech. He didn't even know English yet. And he -- she came with him to the --\nthere was like a gate, you know and -- and I went back into the car and I cried the whole\nway home and then I -- I left for -- for the sanatorium and then Joe would always go, every\nweek. The only time -- they got him a job, they got for Joe a job in a dental laboratory. He\nwas making 35 dollars a week. And they got him, you know, so he moved out from the\nhotel, he wasn't going to, you know, be a burden on them that they should still have to pay\nhis food and hotel, so --",
        "A: Marseilles.",
        "A: I think I say right. And so -- so he had by somebody a room, you know and he could only\nvisit Peter on one day a week, because -- then he came to visit me. One day he visit Peter\nand -- and one day me. So after a few -- a couple of months, I am told that they're going to\nput him in a foster home and I didn't want -- I wanted -- I didn't want him to be changed\nbecause I thought that he is used to this home, with the children and there's this girl that she\nliked him so much and she -- Joe always told me about h-how this girl was always taking\ncare of him and how much, how he follows her around that -- and -- and so I -- I was very\napprehensive that he should be changed and get another home. And I don't know what kind\nof a home he's going to get in. Tis like -- like I had like a premonition you know. So, but\nthey tell -- they told me there was no way, th-th-they keep maximum two months in this\nhome. After that, child must be placed in a foster home, because it 1s a more normal\natmosphere for the child and this is a foster home where they have already two or three\nother children, I think three. And -- and they have a -- a dog and he will like the dog, you\nknow they, they persuaded me -- and he will have fr-friends right away, these children are\nalso foster children, because they don't have their own children. And -- all right, so. Then,\nJoe --\nBeginning of Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: I -- I really didn't have any positive plan at that time. We just looked for a place where it\nis democracy, so that we will be able to bring up our children free of prejudice, where we\nwill have all the rights to educate them, to -- so that they should be able to have their\nchoices. These are -- were my expectations. I wasn't afraid that my husband is not going to\nmake a living, because he was very conscientious and ambitious and he was very smart and\nknowledgeable and I had all the confidence in him, so I had no special fear. My\ndisappointments were these -- the way we were accepted here and the way we were here\ntreated and -- and also I must say that as soon as anybody thought of -- of was that we are\nrefugees, we were taken like we are -- we don't know anything, we are like from -- from the\nwoods, that we have no idea of civilization, I mean some people would ask me -- when I\nwent into a car, whether I have seen already something. Or as soon as th-they heard an\naccent, they -- they really didn't -- didn't try to -- t-to be very nice to us. Th-They -- they\nwere -- they did not like too much Europeans. This is what was my impression. Until --\nmaybe I didn't meet the right people in the beginning. Eventually, I understood also that it\nwas largely our fault too, that we felt excluded because we felt so different from -- from you\npeople here in the United States, that you had such normal lives and -- and we had such\ndifferent and difficult and -- and -- and sad lives, that we cannot -- we don't fit in to you,\nyou know, into your company. And that showed me many times. For example, when I had\nchildren and we went t-to the mountains, you know, we had a bungalow and there were\nrefugees, wi-with a accent like me, people always sticking together and American people\nwould s-stick together and we could never -- we never had like a common ground. I\nremember that once, which was absolutely very comical, because they would stage shows\nthemselves, you know, it was a bungal -- colony, so we had like a club there and they would\nstage shows and they -- and my husband was always a great participant, so -- and he had a\nvery beautiful v-voice and my husband would be singing and -- a-and we tried really to\nparticipate, to be one of the crowd, we -- well accepted. But then -- and then once, they said,\n\u201cYou know, why should we all s-sit separate, so let's push all the tables together.\u201d So they\npush all the tables together. And what do you think? On one end, all the refugees, you\nknow? All the ones with the -- wi -- that are from Europe and on the other, all -- all the\nAmericans. And something else, eventually more Americans would go away, you know,\nmore European came in and then, like five, six years later, it was mostly, practically, hardly\nany American people. Because you had more in common, the American people had more in\ncommon with the American people. The European people had more in common with the\nEuropean people. We somehow, you know, if we are in -- in one room, you just look at an-\nanother one and you know exactly what his life has been, you know? It is like -- like a-an\nopen book. We pretend very much to be like you, but it -- it isn't, it can never -- it can never\nhappen again, not in our lifetime. When -- when I had -- when I came back from the\nsanatorium, f-first I wanted just to continue with the sanatorium because this I fear -- find\nwas a very important and very terrible part of my life, here in the United States, but when\nthey put Peter in that foster home, all those children were mistreated. They were\nundernourished. They treated the dogs very well, but my child was very, very badly treated.\nI only found out when I c -- after a w -- awhile, when I got better, they would give me like a\npass to go home for the weekend and Joe would go, of course, to -- to visit Peter and take\nhim out for the day and he couldn't notice anything. Because he would take the child out, he\nwasn't going to spend with him in -- in the house. But when we took him home, when I came\nhome for the weekend, as part of an activity that, you know, as you get better, they want you\nto s -- because we are a lot 1-in the beds and they want you should start getting used to\nnormal life again, so -- this was already after I had been there a year, so then I came back --\nwhen I s -- came out for the weekend, we took Peter home and he was filthy, like he would\nnever have a bath and he was all scratched up and he had temperature. So when I -- so of\ncourse I bathed him and I put on clean clothe -- underwear and when I came back and -- and\ntold that woman, I said that, \u201cHe's got temperature, would you please put him to bed?\u201d She\ntells me, \u201cI'm not going to go up and -- and down th-the steps. He had temperature before\nand it goes away.\u201d Th-This 1s what her answer was. And also when I came there, his -- he\nhad curly hair, his hair was so n -- you know, in knots that -- that she didn't even make an\nattempt, you know, to have him nicely combed, washed, nothing. So when I came back to\nthe sanatorium, I was very upset, I -- I -- of course I had no choice but to leave him there, I\nwent to the social worker and I told her I want him changed, I -- by no way do I let him stay\nthere. If he is not changed, then I have no choice but to -- but to go home and -- and take\ncare of him. They didn't want me to, you know, to throw away th-the opportunity to cure\nmyself, so she -- she told me that they're going to investigate and -- and they did investigate.\nFirst -- first of course, the social worker said she came, she couldn't find nothing, that the\nother woman told her I must be jealous of her, that she's taking away the love of my child. I\nsaid, \u201cAll I want is that somebody should love him while I can't be with him.\u201d And -- and I\ninsisted on him being changed, so then -- then they changed not only Peter, then they send\nsomebody else. I told her, I said -- she said -- \u201cThe social worker doesn't think so,\u201d I said,\n\u201cThe social worker is not going to think so, because she placed him there. You send\nsomebody else, that didn't place him there. Then, let them find out how well they're taken\ncare of.\u201d And that's what she did. They found that all the children were undernourished.\nThey -- mal -- malnutrition, they were mal -- malnutrition. They took away all the children\nfrom her and they placed each child in different homes and that time, his home was a much\nbetter one. And -- and then I came -- I came home, after I was there a year and a half, I came\nhome, I took my child back and my child -- this is only how I -- and I know it -- saw it there\nthat I'm very different because when everybody else would -- were telling joke and would\nlaugh and I couldn't laugh, I couldn't even crack a smile and they would all -- and nobody\nknew what, you know, about my -- my experiences, so they would always tell me, \u201cWhy --\nthis is -- was a joke, why don't you laugh? Why are you always so serious?\u201d You know. And\nI -- and I di-didn't respond too much to -- to that. I-I would also suffer a lie because they\nwould have, you know, grandmothers come to visit them and -- and they would tell all the\njokes from their children and -- and I -- and there was nobody, bu-but the joke wouldn't, you\nknow, there was nobody telling me how well my child is doing and I would always listen to\nthem, thinking, what Peter is -- must be doing already now, because y-you know, if -- if\nthey would say how clever they are and I would think about my child, that I am missing all\nthis, I don't know his progress. So it made me very, very sad, but what I did know -- the\npeople shouldn't even talk to me, so I took a dictionary, Joe bought me a dictionary in\nCzech and in English and I studied language. So that within eight months I -- that I was\nthere, I spoke, I -- I read and I could write English, you know, so--",
        "A: They spoke Jewish. Joe's relatives were Jewish and with my child Czech, he knew only\nCzech. But a child learns quickly, I -- you know, within a few months, within two months,\nhe -- he probably spoke English. I know he -- the Czech he forgot completely. So w-w-when\nI came back and my -- my child would play with other children, you know and then when he\nwould come home from that home, he would say to me, \u201cMommy, why don't you smile like\nEdie's mother? Mommy, are you going to die?\u201d Because h-he knew already, you know, that\nI -- I was sick and I would tell him, \u201cOf course not.\u201d And then I made up my mind that I\nwant to be like all the mommies here in America, I'm going to smile, I'm going to do\neverything. I'm going to -- to -- I started to go to a -- a psychiatrist. Everything was arranged\nbecause we had no -- no means, you know, no money. I-It was arranged through this hires,\nthey got me -- they wanted me a long time ago, but you know, I-I wasn't ready. I always\nthought to myself, I have to see guy and he's going to give me back my family? A\npsychiatrist, you go, you don't know why you are or how you are. I knew why I am the way\nI am and so what 1s he going to do? He can't replace nobody and he can't help me much and\n-- and therefore I didn't believe too much in psychiatry. But I thought to myself, for my\nchild's sake, you know, I've got to do something. I want to -- want to be able to do\neverything -- I-I right away I-learned everything, s-so that I-I should be able to do with my\nchildren. I mean I used to ice skate when I was a child. I-I went back t-to, I went to -- I\ncouldn't go t-to night classes because he was little and we had no money like for babysitters,\nso -- but as soon as I could, I take courses, I would -- I learned how to -- I-I would take him\nplaces, to Manhattan, to -- to -- to those, sometimes the church gave a -- a -- a children's\nshow and sometimes temple was something and I occupied myself a lot with this -- my\nchild. But e1-eight months later I -- I had a -- a relapse an-and I had to go back and this 1s\nwhen -- this is my -- my first impulse w-was this is when I thought of suicide, because I\ndidn't want to have to leave my child again, I didn't want he should have to -- to be in foster\nhomes, I didn't want -- I didn't know how many times I'm going to be up and down -- in and\nout of sanatoriums. And I thought this way, you know, he's young, Joe is young, he could\nremarry, he will have one mother and someone who du -- that can laugh and be cheery and -\n- and -- and my husband was absolutely, he was an unusual, wonderful, fabulous person and\nh-he was, oh, he was always the first one to -- to -- to be, when the -- you know, when the\nvisiting was. He w-would always buy me presents even though he didn't have -- he would\nlive on -- on bread and margarine always, to bring me something nice, you know, just t-to\ncheer me up. And he'd always tell me how great Peter was doing, bring me all his pictures\nand -- and always smiling. He -- he was never a down person, he -- how -- how he remained\nso -- I-I want to say perfect, I-I really don't know, but -- but -- but he did. And -- an-and he\nwas very, very much in love with me and if he alw -- and he was a person that could show a\nlot of love, because some people can love and not be able to show, but -- but his love really\npulled me through and -- and so he -- he was always, you know, very hopeful and always\ntold me -- always planned wh-what we are going to do and how we going to live our lives\nand how wonderful it's going to be when -- when I can get back. So when -- when I had -- so\nhe told me he's not going to go to a foster home any more, that he made arrangements like\nnext house, they were a family with two children and they say he can see him every single\nday when he comes home from work and take him back to the house and I should -- so that\nthere -- so I brought him there and -- and when I left him and -- and Peter was all so -- I\nremembered that h-he didn't cry when I left him, but -- but you could see that he -- 1-1t isn't\nbecause he's not going to miss me, but because he was like 1n shock also, you know. With\nagain being left, because I knew how he was afraid that I'm not -- going to die, you know, he\nasked me when I was home and now I'm going a-away again. And this is when -- when I\ncame home and I asked the psychiatrist, I told him I can't sleep -- he sh -- he didn't have\nany, you know, he never suspected that I have anything in mind and I had sleeping pills\nfrom before and I told him I don't have any, he should prescribe new sleeping pills. I took\nout a whole bunch of those sleeping pills, I took them -- I -- I prepared all of them, I had\nmaybe 50 of them. And I thought I'll -- when I go to the sanatorium, I'm going to take them\nall and -- and I'll die. And my husband brought me a very beautiful bed jacket and he\nwanted me -- not to give it to me here, he want when I'll open the suitcase I should be\nsurprised, he always loved, you know, surprises. And he -- and again and a beautiful letter\nhe wrote me, you know, that I should have what to eat again and about his love for me and\nall that. And when he put it in and somehow, I don't know how -- how he looked where to\nput it, I guess he wanted to put it a little bit underneath, he found these pills. And knew right\naway that in -- in a sanatorium you don't need pills, you don't take any medication, because\nif you can't sleep they give you pills, you know. So he right away guessed my intentions, of\ncourse he took them upthay and -- and he was crying and he begged me not -- not to -- what\n-- what kind of -- wh-what I would do to him and to the child and to my sisters and would I\ndo that and -- and made me swear that I will never, you know, attempt anything like that.\nAnd this is really an -- I -- tha-that's how I -- anyway, I went back and when I came -- but it\ndidn't work out very well with that family, because they would take for instance, the\nchildren to the movies, they would leave him alone. They -- he didn't brush his teeth once,\nso she -- she brushed it that she made it bleed and -- and he was already old enough to tell\nJoe, so my sister Mina came to stay with him, her husband let her go and stay here so that\nshe should take care of the child. And she took -- took back Peter and she stayed here a\nwhole year until I didn't come -- come home. And then, I was still not -- not well enough,\nbut they let me go home because I-I -- I wanted so much to go home, but only if I don't take\ncare of my child. So my sister took him with her to Israel and -- by then he was already --\nshe enrolled him already in the first grade and so that I could still recuperate an-and not do\nanything and not -- to have complete peace and not always -- I was taking --\npneumothorax, you know, I had to go once a week for -- because my lung was collapsed\nand I took that -- I was still an outgoing patient fo-for three years after I came back. So they\nwanted I shouldn't have any stress and -- and we -- so, when was I told them that my sister\nwould take him back, because he was so used to my sister, it made no difference to him\nwhether it's me or my s -- my sister. And she was more than -- than willing to do that, so I\ncame home and -- and after that I -- after -- when it was vacation, I went to Israel and\nstayed with my sister, visited with her, like three months and took back Peter and then we --\nI -- I never had any more problems with tuberculosis after -- after the three years were up\nfrom this, you know, after they start pneumothorax, except that I would go -- go for thr --\nfor the checkups. I went only for checkups. And -- and I was very anxious to have lots of\nchildren, because to me somehow, it meant that every time a child is born, was like I'm\nbringing back somebody from, you know, from the dead. It w -- it became -- 1t became to a\npoint, it became an obsession. It wasn't any more just normal, because the doctor forbid me\nto have more children. He said that for my condition, I -- it's very bad, because I could -- I\ncould get sick again and I have a child, I shouldn't have any children. But I was so\ndetermined to have more children that -- that 1f we would travel in the car, you know, and --\nand I would travel with Joe in the car and I would always look into other cars and I would\nsee a few children, I would always count, I would say, \u201cLet's see, there are three children,\nfour children,\u201d and I would say, \u201cJoe, look, look, in that -- this car.\u201d I thought that he can\nread my mind. He say, \u201cWhat's that, oh it's -- yeah, it's a Cadillac.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, not what car\nitis, four children, these people have four children, we have only one.\u201d He would say,\n\u201cLook, we have one child, he is wonderful, he is beautiful, he is healthy. If you want more\nchildren, we'll adopt.\u201d I said, \u201cNever.\u201d I said, \u201cI will have m-my own children.\u201d And I\nwould not use anything, making him think that I'm using, I should become pregnant. I would\nbecome pregnant and maybe because I want it so much, I would lose -- I would lose my\npregnancy. But then I would come to the doctor, he would say, \u201cI -- didn't I tell you not to\nhave any more children?\u201d So I would say, which wasn't true, because we had -- at that time\nhe wanted all religious, I didn't observe anything. I said, \u201cWe are so religious, and in our\nreligion, we're not allowed to --\u201d You know, because he said, \u201cWell, I give you a -- you ha -\n- you have to use something.\u201d I said, \u201cIn our religion,\u201d I said, \u201cwe can't use something.\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cSo you want to kill yourself?\u201d I said, \u201cIt's up to God.\u201d I -- all of a sudden I became a\nGod's person. I said -- he said, \u201cWell, then let me -- you know,\u201d he said, \u201cI know your\nreligion,\u201d he said, \u201cand your religion s-states that -- that if it's for the health of your mother,\nyou're allowed t-to have an abortion.\u201d I said, \u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cI am so religious that this part I\ndon't -- I-I-I -- I don't agree, I'm not going to have any-anything killed,\u201d I said. \u201cAll right,\u201d\nhe said. And he was -- be very mad at me. But then I would lose it. And this happens three\ntimes. Each time I lost my pregnancy, it -- sometimes as late as in the fifth and sixth months.\nThen, with my second daughter, with my daughter that was eventually born, I stayed nine\nmonths in bed. I had a nurse come twice a week to give me injection, the doctor would give\nme -- to -- to -- to make the house calls, you know, the examinations in my house. And --\nand this 1s how I -- how I carried her out and then I was very happy that I -- I have my\ndaughter and I-I named her after my mother and -- and then Joe became -- established\nhimself. He opened up his own laboratory and he did very well financially and our children\nwere doing well -- Peter was very -- doing very well in school and we lived a very normal\nlife, except that I was -- I was always very sad in me. Whatever I did, the trips that we take -\n- that we took, no matter where we went, it -- I could never enjoy it fully. Because if -- if I\neven watched a show and -- and then I -- I would -- it would come in, like -- seeing my\nmother with her grandchild or -- or thinking about my brother [inaudible] that how -- how\nthis must have been, what a terrible death this must been. Always I spoiled everything\nmyself. Nobody did it for me, I did it myself. I don't know whether it was sort of like a --\nlike I have to punish myself, that I have now a good life or whatever it is. But that's -- but\nthat's how it 1s. I can't explain it, I don't know whether everybody feels the same way, but\nthis is -- I never spoke about it because I didn't want to upset my husband, he's trying so\nhard, you know, to give me everything and t-to have a wonderful life and -- and he would\nbring down the stars for me if he could. And -- and yet, he always would ask me, \u201cWhy are\nyou not happy? Look, we -- you have every reason.\u201d And -- and -- and logically, I had every\nreason, but I just, I-I couldn't. I would have such depressions. Sometimes I would have\ndepressions that I couldn't answer the telephone. My husband, poor man, h-had -- didn't\nhave a-an easy life on account o-of me, because he was always so involved about my well\nbeing that he -- his whole mind revolved around me. So I-I would get into depressions and I\nw -- I couldn't answer the phone, I-I couldn't take care of my children, I had already that\ntime two children that -- and I had already what I wanted so much. I couldn't see people, I --\nan-and we went everywhere, to shows and to -- and I would go, I -- I -- and I would\nentertain and nobody would really know what -- ho -- what battle I-I am waging within\nmyself, battle to live or to die. I-I wrote a poem, \u201cDepression,\u201d I wrote a poem, I'm going to\ngive you a book, okay? I -- I don't have too many any more, but -- but just -- it will give you\nan insight that what -- even though -- that we have everything, you understand? Financially,\nwonderful children and beautiful grandchildren. That they -- my children are very close to\nme. They're all professionals, my grandchildren are -- are lovely. We have no drug addicts, I\ndon't have to worry, you know? Yet, what happened has completely taken away the good\nlife that I could have enjoyed. It's -- a-and yet, I learned how to dance, I learned because -- I\nle -- I'm telling you, I learned everything, to play bridge, even to swim, which -- which I-I\nd-didn't know any of those things. I -- I always -- th-the only real enjoyment came always,\nonly for my children. At their graduations, at their weddings, at their -- at their, you know,\nbirths of their children -- I -- I make it for my children always, very easy. Everybody tells\nme that's -- that's calling spoiled and I don't care. If I can give them a good life and I can see\nit, then I don't want to have to be dead that they should have -- that -- that I should help\nthem with the money. I do all that while I'm alive. I do all that while I'm alive. I don't care\nth-that they are -- you know, that they are not saving like I would have liked them to, but if\nthey are not, I -- I'd like -- I am glad that they have a good life. I am glad that they have\neverything what I didn't have. I never told them, \u201cYou know, when I was young, this is what\nI did or what -- when I was your age d --.\u201d I never -- I never put any guilt trips on them. I\nalways led them at their pace. When to call, how much to call, when to visit, how much to\nvisit. I -- I -- I want them to know that when -- when -- when I die, they are not guilty of\nanything, they didn't have to do anything more. All they have to do is, they should be happy\nand that makes me happy. And -- and now that -- that they are -- that they are adults, they\nknow, of course about everything, because even through reading, even through -- I used to\nspeak in schools, I used to speak in -- in colleges. In fact, my children were so little that my\ndaughter once -- and I never let them listen to the tapes -- that she -- after I spoke once in\nQueensborough Community College and -- and I wasn't home and she was in my house,\nshe took the tape -- because I taped, because I wanted the tape should go to libraries, you\nknow, those audio tapes, like yo -- like you have. And she was crying because she listened\nto this tape. And -- an-and one other incident is, when my daughter was in high school, her\nsocial worker called me and she told me, \u201cYou know Mrs. Klein, I had to call you because\nyour daughter is very unhappy and -- and -- and I have to talk to you because she tells me\nthat she 1 -- when she is home, she always has to be happy. If soon she is not happy, then\nyou are very upset. And she doesn't want to upset you so she -- she pretends to be happy, but\nshe is not and she's upset why -- why you have to be upset if she is moody or -- or --.\u201d So\nshe tells me like this, \u201cHaven't you ever been a teenager? Don't you know that teenagers,\nthey have ups and downs.\u201d And then I was think to myself, \u201cA teenager, think. I have never\nbeen a teenager.\u201d Wh-When I was 14, my mother was in -- in -- in a jail. When -- when she\ncame home, we had to run away. I -- I -- I couldn't go -- go outside for eight months, when\nmy brother found us somewheres, a room. I had no friends, because I couldn't have friends,\nbecause I-I-I was always in hiding and running. When was I ever a teenager? I -- I thought\nto myself, \u201cI really am making my daughter crazy. I want something that nobody can -- can\ngive me.\u201d And then she wanted to go t -- away to college, I right away said, \u201cYes, this is the\nbest thing for you.\u201d But she was with me on the phone, every single -- and I never told her,\n\u201cCall me every day.\u201d But she called me, she would tell me everything and we were so close,\nthat -- an-and I don't -- and I -- and I never, you know, was holding on to my children that I\nshouldn't let them move away or -- or tell them, \u201cDon't do skiing, you'll break a leg.\u201d Or\ndon't -- I want them to know everything, to learn everything and to have everything. And --\nand a -- and that's why I never told -- talked to them when they were small and never, if my\nchildren would ask me, you know, \u201cWhere are my grandparents, because this one has\ngrandparents.\u201d I would always say, \u201cThey are in Czechoslovakia, in heaven.\u201d Because if I\nwill say they are here, they would want to go to visit their grave or something, you know?\nSo this is how I had planned my life, this was my plan from the beginning, concerning my\nchildren. And I think I accomplished what I wanted to accomplish, because they are\nwonderful people and they are very, also -- they have a lot of -- th-they are very sensitive\npeople. Th-They are very -- people that will help anybody that needs -- my -- my oldest son\nis a dentist, he did for people so many jobs that he never charged a penny that couldn't\nafford. And my youngest son is a lawyer, but unfortunately he's not working in law because\nhe couldn't -- when he finished, the law profession was so overwhelmed with lawyers, he\ncouldn't get a -- a job. He got a few very -- I mean very -- jobs that were very insignificant\nand h-he didn't like them and so -- so he's not working as a lawyer, but he -- he would give\nhis shirt off, if he can help somebody. If there was -- once a -- a woman by mistake called\nhim, that she called somebody else, but his phone answered and that time he didn't even\nwork and I was completely supporting him because he couldn't get a --a job as a lawyer, he\nwas already that time a lawyer. And she is in Brooklyn and she wanted to go to -- her\nhusband had left her and took the children and she wanted to go after her husband and she\ndidn't have money and my h -- son's w -- this is -- son is religious and this is why, we'll\ncome back -- why I became again religious and she's stranded and he asks -- he calls me\nright away back, he tells her to -- to wait by the phone, he's going to call me back and he\ntells me, \u201cMom, what shall I do, th-this lady is -- and it's Friday, you know.\u201d And he even\ntalked to the synagogue, they said they don't want to get involved because, you know, she\nwasn't a religious person. He went, picked her up, took her to his house for -- for -- for the\nShabbat. I told him I will return his money, h-he should buy her the ticket, wherever she\nwants to go. He took her down to the, you know -- after Shabbat, he took her to the airport,\nbought her a ticket and sent her where she wanted to go for -- to, you know, after that\nhusband and children. Th-This is how far he would go out of his way to help people. I'm just\nshowing that my children are not at all selfish kids. They are very aware of -- of being\nfortunate that th-they can help others and that I always told them and my mother told me\nthat. And we would complain why the richer people -- and we weren't rich at all, that my\nmother is -- is not having any money -- income, you know, from the house where -- where I\nneeded, if I wanted something and she couldn't afford t-to buy it for me, we would say there\nare richer people, my mother always said, \u201cYou should always look off, but you can do not\nbut one that doesn't do and -- and God will reward you and you should always be happy that\nyou are the one in a position to help and that you don't need. And that it's not the other way\naround.\u201d And this is how all my children are. So I'm very proud of them.",
        "A: Okay. My daughter's name is Ren\u00e9 and she was born September first, 19 -- 1956 -- 1958.\nNo, no -- 1956, 1956 because Peter was born in '46, it's always -- and my son David was\nborn July ninth, his name is David and he was born in 1966.",
        "A: No, I was already very, you know, I -- I was already relaxed, I-I have at least two\nchildren. In fact, something th-that happened is that I was bleeding profusely after -- I had a\nhemorrhage after Ren\u00e9, a few weeks later and they had to rush me to the hospital and I\nalmost died from loss of blood. And then -- it took me months to recuperate and then for\nsome reason I didn't have, for ov -- almost -- almost -- more than nine years, I didn't have\nthe period. So I thought that they did something, that the doctors did something internally\nfrom me, that I cannot have children. So we -- we never watched. And -- and 10 years later,\nI became pregnant and I was very happy, but the doctor said that this child -- you're not\ngoing to go to bed any more. If -- if it works, it works and if not, not and it worked. And --\nand he was born and this was one of the happiest days of my life and I even -- y-you will\nread in my book, I called it miracle baby and I-I wrote a poem about -- about him.",
        "A: Yes. My -- we were -- I mean, tradition -- we -- we kept --\nBeginning of Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: We were always traditional Jews, but not religious Jews. We did keep holidays, an -- but\nwe did not keep all the dietary laws. We did not keep the, you know that I traveled on -- on\nShabbat when -- whoever is religious, does not do these things, but I always had a kosher\nhome, but outside, I was not observing what I ate. Then my husband -- w-we -- we had -- we\nmoved a very nice house in Great Neck and then we changed houses to -- to a nicer area in\nGreat Neck, because my husband wanted very much to live there. So we moved and -- and\nafter, about -- we didn't even live there a year, my husband got cancer and -- and he didn't\nhave very long to live. My son David, we -- was -- was already danear religious, because\nwe sent my children, all of my children, we sent to religious school, like David went to\nYeshiva. My oldest son Peter went to Yeshiva, but Peter didn't like Yeshiva and -- and\ndidn't remain religious, he didn't keep anything, but we wanted to give our children the\nchoice, that they should be able, if -- if they want to be religious and my husband went also\nto a Yeshiva when he was young and we wanted them to have the same education and then\nwhatever they do with their, you know, whatever they do, we can't always control. So my\nson David, he loved Yeshiva and he became religious right from the beginning, as soon as\nhe started at school. And this the -- full time day school, where they have both, you know.\nHalf a year -- half a day is devoted to religion and a half a day is to secular studies. And\nwhen my h-husband got very sick, my son David, he used to go to rabbi's, to -- you know,\nthey should pr-pray for him and asked his -- ask-asked my son whether his parents are\nreligious and he said, \u201cThey are not.\u201d So h-he told him that maybe God would help if -- if\nthe parents became religious, Shomu Shabbat. Shomu Shabbat means that you keep -- you\nkeep the Sabbath, you -- because there are degrees of religion -- there is very religious and\nvery religious, you know? Amada religiouson. So when David came back, my husband was\nalready very sick and -- and he wasn't going to -- and I told him not to bother my husband,\nyou know, because if he's religious, on -- on the hol-holidays, not allowed to watch\ntelevision, you know. I wanted him to be able to occupy, you know, not to think always\nabout his sickness. So David told me what the rabbi said, and he said, \u201cYou know, why\ndon't you become religious, maybe this will help Dad.\u201d And they are very, very close to\ntheir father and they loved him very much and -- and I loved him very much, but I knew\nthere is no hope. But I didn't want that my son should ever think for one day that I didn't try\nto help his father -- to save his father. If he believes so much that -- in the rabbi's, that\nHallechin is going to help his father, I didn't want that when Joe will die that David should\never think once, you know, if his mother would have become religious, maybe his father\nwould have lived, or would have lived longer. I told David, if -- if this will help your father,\nI'm going to become religious, I'm going to keep everything. Unfortunately, I don't -- we\nhave to be prepared, because I didn't want him to be so disappointed, because I knew what\nthe score is. I said, \u201cBut I am going to -- you can rely on me, I'm promising you, I'll become\nreligious.\u201d And this is how it was, this is how I turn back to -- to observing the Sabbath and\noutside I don't eat, ever, a-anything that's not kosher. I-I travel a lot, even now, but I only\neat always fish and you know, salad, baked potato. Wherever we are, when we are not in a\nkosher restaurant. And my son became always more and more religious. This is how -- how\nhe 1s happy in his life and religion really helped a great deal for me, in a way -- that my son\nwas religious because his father died when he just entered college, it was his first year of\ncollege and though he wanted to go away to college, but because his father died, so he didn't\nwant me to be alone, so he stayed home and he went to Queen's College, instead of going\naway, you know. And -- and he was the one, the strong one in the family when -- when this -\n- when the de -- when my fa -- when my husband passed away. Because my daughter got\nsick after his death and my older son could not accept it. David was the only one, the strong\none and the one that -- that accepted it and that he always felt that there is a reason for\neverything, whatever God does and he was the one that could -- th-that could give courage\nto my other children and -- and he wrote such a beautiful letter to my daughter that she\nkeeps it to this day, because he wrote her that, first of all he would -- he -- he believed that\nif somebody who 1s -- cries too much and -- an-and is mourning so much for a -- for a loved\none, that his soul can't rest in heaven. This 1s how he believes. So he wrote, he told me once,\n\u201cMom, you loved Dad so much, then you have to want to give him also, peace 1n heaven. Y-\nYou can't -- you have to accept and -- and you have to go on with your life and -- and -- and\n-- and you cannot keep mourning all the day and night. You must -- you must do that for\nDad.\u201d I-I wish I could feel the same way my son feels, but -- but I don't, but I -- I observe\nwhatever 1-1s possible, as far as I can observe. But what he wrote to -- to my daughter is -- is\n-- I really want to show his -- h-h-how a religious person can help others who are not\nreligious. And he -- and how he can accept the unac -- the unacceptable, like it was\nunacceptable for my older children. He wrote her, to his sister, \u201cDear Ren\u00e9, look how much\nmore you had in life because of Daddy, than me. Daddy was there for you when you\ngraduated college, he was at your college graduation. When you was engaged, he was at\nyour engagement and he -- you were married, he was at -- he was at your wedding. When --\nwhen you gave birth to your children, he was at their, you know, at their birth. Now I -- Iam\njust -- I-I am just starting now college. He's not going to be there when I graduate, he's not\ngoing to be there when I get married, he's not going to be there when I'll have my children.\nAnd I accept because you cannot bring -- you cannot change what -- what God designate for\neach person, but Dad always told us --\u201d and this is really what he told the family always,\n\u201cI'm not afraid to die, I had a wonderful life and a wonderful marriage and -- and I -- \u201d he\nwas 63 years old, \u201cand after all, some people live 80 years and they have a miserable\nmarriage or they have no children or they have children that are -- that are in jail or th -- I\nhad everything, I-I have no worries, no financial worries. I always -- I always was able to do\neverything that -- that I wanted for my family and with my family and you must accept that\nand I -- I'm accepting and I want you to accept.\u201d And he reminded this to my daughter, and\nthis was an 18 year old and -- and I would like to see which -- an 18 year old that is not\nreligious would be able to do that an-and to have the strength and the -- and the wisdom to -\n- to talk like that or to write like that or to feel like that and to think like that. And -- and I\ncould have had a lot of problems if it would be not a religious child because he could have\nbeen a rebellious and metagart an-an-and become either a drug addict or -- or fidon or not\nwant to go to school or -- h-he did everything what he thought would have made his father\nproud or his mother proud. For instance, he wanted very much to move to -- to Israel af-\nafter -- after he graduated college. And -- and I told him I will never stand in his way, he\ncan always live in Israel if this is what he wanted, but I want him to have a profession. He\nmust first choose a profession. If he finishes his profession and he wants to go to Israel, I\nwill never say no. So, h-he -- he accepted my wish, that he should have first the profession\nand he studied law and he finished law, but then he got married and you know, and then --\nso he goes instead -- right now he goes every year to Israel to visit, which I also go. So -- so\nwhen you have rel -- a religious son, they're somehow more apt to listen to -- to their\nparents, you know and to -- and to grant their wishes than -- than when you're not religious.",
        "A: As I said, I do all these things, but I don't feel the way my son feels. I don't feel that\nreligious inside me, you understand? I would never go back on what I promised my son.\nThat I have never done and I would never do it, because my -- my nephew from Israel, my\nbrother's son, was the Israeli consul in South Africa, in Johannesburg and that was about\n10 years ago, we went -- I went to Johannesburg with my sister to his -- his son's Bar\nMitzvah. And we were staying in a hotel and -- th-the Bar Mitzvah was done so that where I\ncould walk, because I'm not allowed to travel. But then he had a big party in his house,\nwhere he had all those dignitaries, be-besides the -- and he wanted so much I should come to\nhis house. And I would have, but I couldn't -- it's not the walking distance, I would have had\nto travel and he tells me, he said, \u201cYou know, David is not here,\u201d you know, my religious\nson. \u201cDavid is not here, you could come, nobody will know that you traveled.\u201d I said, \u201cI\ndon't do that any more for David. I do that that if I promise something I -- I have to -- I live\nup to my promise\u201d and I would never go and I never went and I didn't go. I'd rather miss, I --\nI do, I -- I --I mean, this is my character, that I will never disappoint or I will never go back\non something that I make a vow o-or a promise.",
        "A: I-I-I have anger. I-I have anger, I have anger not so much a-at God, because to me God is\nnot, you know, I don't see God as a -- first that He can say -- He can, like -- like when we\nlearn that -- that he split them, th-th -- you know, like Passover, that he split water an-and\nall the Egyptians drowned and -- and the Jews went out from bondage and brucha 40 years\nin the dessert until Moses brought them to -- to the Holy Land. To me, this -- God 1s a spirit.\nI am Go -- I am mad at every government, at every country, at everybody that had the power\nto do something and didn't do. The United States didn't -- didn't let in -- didn't do anything\nto help th-the Jewish refugees. Every country willingly gave out the Jews as soon as the\norder came. It's true there are a few -- what do you call them? W-We called them the\nrighteo-righteous gentiles, I give them all my credit. I-I think they were very brave and\nwonderful people. But there were very, very few to do that and -- and -- an-and they deserve\nfar more credit because they really were -- were -- could have paid with their lives, but the\ngovernment wouldn't have paid with their lives. All they -- all they had to do is open the\ngates, let us in. Bomb the -- bomb the tracks that go t-to Auschwitz. If they would have\nbombed those tracks, then the mili -- at least of one million of people would have been\nsaved. The Hungarian people were only one year, that they, you know -- it was on -- they\nwere people only one year, but they managed to kill most of them because th-they were not\neven trying any more to send them to work, they were only killing them. If they would have\nbombed the tracks, they couldn't have taken them t-to Auschwitz, to the gas chambers. I\nmean, nobody di-di-did anything. In fact, an-and it wasn't that they didn't know, they buried\nall the knowledge, th-the state department buried among them, that Roosevelt shouldn't\neven know. But then they came to Roosevelt and -- personally and told him about it and he\nwasn't willing to do anything either. S-So of course I have anger. England could have saved\nmil -- quite a -- how many -- a half a million or -- he -- f-for some -- I think they had to give\nakem amount trucks from them, trucks -- I can't remember exactly how many, 500 trucks or\n-- for -- for trucks and -- and -- and money, they could have -- they wanted to give out the --\nthe Hungarian Jews, but nobody -- who -- who -- who would to let them in? Nobody did\nanything and on those I'm ma -- I'm mad at all the people that could have, like all the\npoliticians that -- at -- at every country and -- but not at -- at God. God, to me, 1s a spirit.\nHe's not a human being that he comes down and -- and he's going to smite this one and that\none.",
        "A: No -- th -- not -- th-th-they asked but -- if somebody wanted to say something, you better\nforget about it, don-don't dwell on it, the -- I will tell you something, in sanatorium, when I\nwas in sanatorium, they had once shown a movie that had to do with the -- with the\nHolocaust and then wh-what I heard was complaints. \u201cWhat's -- what do they give us su-\nsuch propaganda, this a propaganda, this never happened. Look it is what they can give.\u201d\nThey didn't even believe it an-and I cried all night because I couldn't even talk about it and\nthat's why I couldn't even become close, you know, to the people that -- that they didn't even\n-- they didn't even want to know. An-And -- and I know then I used to play in -- and I 1 -- I\nlived in Flushing, I played Mah Jong, you know because I told you, I learned everything, I\ndid everything and -- and it was the Eichmann trial was on and I was watching every --\nevery night the Eichmann trial. And then -- these were American people of course and they\ntell me -- and I said, \u201cAre you watching the Eichmann trial?\u201d \u201cNo, we -- we can't, it-it's just\nagainst us.

We -- we had to stand in line,\u201d for sugar or\nfor meat or for something here in the United States. Th-This is why I-I wrote a poem about\nthat too, because it just mind-boggling to me.

O-Or when was happening,\nyou see, Israel was taking in from Bosnia and people -- why people think that as long as\nthey have it good, then that's all that counts. There's not I can do a lot for Bo -- f-f-for those\nchildren that are istan but it reminds me also o-of us, of those children, I mean the feelings\nof -- of pity came back to me. I just said that the enjoyment never came back to me.",
        "A: IJ-I-I-I had -- I had so-something wor-worse happening and that was in -- in -- 1n -- we\nlived that time in the Bronx and I had from Czechoslovakia, feathers, you know, and with\nvery big covers, an-and so we went with my husband to have made quilts out of it and we\nchose a material or whatever. And then when we came back, they -- they changed the\nfeathers, because our feathers were, you know, those -- that's from goose, were very good\nfeathers and they gave us very bad feathers back, you know, with a different material and\nwe said, \u201cYou know, th-these weren't the quilts that we ordered.\u201d And she got so mad, she\nsaid, \u201cYou know, you shouldn't have come back for -- f-for --\u201d because as soon as we have\nan accent, they know that -- they know there was a -- a camp and that there was an\nAuschwitz and, \u201cYou shouldn't have come back from Auschwitz.\u201d This is what -- what they\ntold me. You know what? W-W-We left them theres, we were so upset, w-we walked out,\nwe didn't want to get th-the quilts, we left it to them. And then there is, of course -- you\nthink is it that I used to -- my depressions only stopped, you know when? When they started\nto -- t-to be availof -- heard and -- and to start making it publicly, like -- like schools started\nto ask us whether we want to talk to the children or -- or when they started to -- when they\nstarted to do something about the Holocaust to be remembered, because I always used to\nthink that when we die, not -- nobody will ever know because we weren't able really, that\nmuch, you know, to talk to o -- to our children. We wanted them to be happy, we wanted\nthem t-to be like -- like all the other kids, not to have this kind of pain and whe-whether it\nwas right on our part or not, but -- but I wanted there should be some avail -- or some other\nthat there should be -- they should be remembered. So I thought to myself that all these lives\nlost an-and there will -- nobody even -- maybe my children will light a candle because that\nmuch they will know, but what about the world? Nobody will ever remember them and --\nand -- and then th-they will -- then those lies that will start circulating that it never\nhappened and this -- this is also why I used to have these depressions -- it was -- it started to\nbe, you know, like publicized and memorials are being cr-created and -- and there 1s\nsomething being done about it and schools are -- the children are learning in the schools and\nit's being passed on from generation to generations and -- and everybody's aware.

He said, \u201cI-It's too emotional, y-you want these books to be able that children in\nschool should be able to read and -- and you write better another book apart, you know,\nanother book and the --\u201d I should make another book, let's say after -- after the -- the -- the\nHolocaust, about the -- the whole life, you know, what happened and how we lived our life\nand all that, but you know I -- I never did it after any more and if I would have done it the\nway I wanted it, it would have been the way I wanted and I would have had more\nsatisfaction out the book. This way, it's a book, I mean, whoever reads it, likes it because\nthey don't know, you know, it -- I am the one that 1s not that satisfied with the book.",
        "A: Because I always felt that I have to put something on paper because if -- I-I can't, if not\nI'll explode inside. You see, this is for me a kind of release. The poems were a kind of\nrelease. Th -- Until -- I didn't speak in schools, to -- even speaking in the -- in the\nclassrooms was for me a kind of release. The first time, I thought, wh-when I was asked for\nthe first time, because nobody really taught it, it started really, the schools started in -- in\nthe Great Neck, the principal is a member in our synagogue and -- and he knows I am a\nHolocaust survivor and he came over to me and he asked me whether -- and I also, they --\nthey had my poems you know, in the bulletins, this one, that one. He came over, he asked\nme, could I speak to his class? First I said no, then I said yes, then I said no, then I said yes.\nI couldn't, you know -- then I came home and I thought to myself, \u201cHow am I going to? I-I\nwouldn't be able to, it's -- it's just too painful, I -- I'll -- I -- and I -- in -- in all the years that\nI spoke I never cried in front of children. I always was able to speak very well and you\nknow, and -- and take answers and questions and everything. Giv-Give answers to\nquestions. So, but then I told him, \u201cOkay, I'm going to speak.\u201d And the first time I spoke,\nfirst of all, the children were mesmerized. Nobody -- he said -- an-and he took all the classes\nat one time because he was afraid I'm not going to come back maybe to another class, you\nknow? And -- but I had such a headache, I had such a splitting headache that I thought my\nhead will explode, because that was, you know, the fi -- the first time. And going back and\nt-to -- to everything. So and then -- then of course I got home and I took something and --\nand for days I couldn't sleep, it wa -- it was very emotional. But then I got used to it and --\nand it was okay. I didn't have any more headaches. I-I would -- I -- once a year when I\nspoke actually in Queensborough Community College, I -- I spoke front -- in front of 37\nteachers once, it's th-three hours straight. An-And the funniest thing you -- was one of the\nteachers se -- you know, I gave - I say now you can ask me questions. \u201cMrs. Klein, what\nwas your, you know, what kind of reli --\u201d you know what -- when you have like you have,\nhere in the Jersey, you have television or you go for exercise, what do you call it?",
        "A: No, not hobby. What did you do, like what kind of -- of --",
        "A: Of --",
        "A: Recreation, recreat -- \u201cWhat kind of recreation did you have?\u201d That was after I spoke\nthree hours about Auschwitz, about -- about the killings, about -- about the beating to\ndeaths, about t-the -- you know, when you would go to those showers that they've -- to f --\nth-the -- once -- once aforweese about the showers was a form of torture, because they\nwould first let th-the hot water that you burned your skin an-and -- and you ran out, so they\nbeat you with the -- with those whips and then the cold water. Nobody wanted to go, they\nwould hide. So then he asked me what kind of recreations, I thought, well, tell yitmut, \u201cThe\nrecreation was that we would try to see and count how many lice we have killed that day\nfrom our -- from the seams of our dress. The other recreation was watching two sisters being\nbeaten to death. The other recreation was that -- that when I -- when they caught me with a\nbread, I-I was beaten up so badly that they broke, you know, a big spoon that y-you -- you\nare cooking for the whole army th -- and that I thought that they are going to kill me with it,\nbut how I survived it is just really by miracle.\u201d I said, \u201cIsn't that enough recreation for you?\u201d\nAnd then the teacher, the other teacher came in and said, \u201cMrs. Klein, he's all -- he's not a\nvery bright man, don't take him,\u201d but I just thought, what kind -- what kind of a question is?\nI could see ask something, ask when did you get up or what was your food, or what was\nyour, you know, th-they take you for work or didn't they take you for work or -- or what are\nyour feelings, what -- ask an intel -- you are a teacher, ask an intelligent question. What\nkind of -- what recreation wo-would -- would the Nazis if -- 1f they made tests on the -- on --\nI have a friend that she had her, they were twins, Mengele make -- made tests for them, they\nwould take out the blood from them, you know and the -- and the mother was luckily a\nnurse, so -- so sh-she would take out from herself blood and -- and -- and inject it back into\nthe children. I mean how many -- how many twins s-survived? I mean they made -- they\nmade experiments what they make on -- on -- they made on humans, but they make here on\nmice and on rats. I mean this is -- that they would take children, they would put them, freeze\nthem, then unfreeze them, th-then -- then -- then kill them. They would see -- th-they would\ncount how long it takes for somebody to die in the sun, how long it takes for somebody to --\nto -- to die 1-1-1n -- 1n -- in, you know, fr --in the freezing weather. I mean, this -- this kind\nof brutalities were -- were committed on us. There -- there was th-th-this SS woman that\nwas riding around on a horse and -- and -- and she would just de-decide that -- to go and --\nand kill somebody, trample with that horse to death, a -- a -- a prisoner. They would let the\ndogs tear to pieces prisoners. I-I will tell you what happened to my brother-in-law, the one I\ntold you, Mina's husband. The SS gave for the dogs, food. And -- and he saw this bowl with\nthe -- with the food. And the dog ate, ate and then -- and then had enough and -- and left.\nLeft over something in that bowl. My brother-in-law stole himself, you know, crept to this\nbowl and took out the rest of the food and ate it quickly up. The SS came out with that dog\nthat had eaten before and -- and my brother-in-law was sure that he's going to tear him to\npieces because this used to be a big sport by them. And told him he should kneel in front of\nthe dog and he should say, let's see, like Herr, Herr is Mister, you know, like Mr. Klein or\nMr. Dog, you know, Mr. Dog an-and beg forgiveness and beg apology and apologize to him,\nkneeling and -- and prostrate yourself and -- and then beat him, beat him so badly with --\nwith th-that, that people had to carry him in, but they didn't kill him. This 1s -- this is the --\nthis 1s what they did, because he -- he took -- yeah and I had to t -- to talk about himself,\nIshfa fluta yuda, that means, \u201cI, the lowest of the Jews that -- that has ever crawled on this\nearth.\u201d This is what -- everything he had to tell t-to -- to the dog an -- and -- and Herr do --\nHerr, you know wha -- this 1s wh -- wh -- what diabolical creatures, that they weren't --\nthese were -- these were and these were people that some were doctors, some were\nengineers, s-some were teachers, some were businessmen, but they loved the dogs and they\nloved their families and this is what they were able t-to -- to do to people. My -- my sister\nhas a Polish housekeeper because the one, Parela, that lived in -- in Israel, she moved\neventually to the United States and she lives here and my sister 1s sick, sh-she has\nParkinson's. So she has a Polish woman. And her husband was one of the people that would\n-- the -- a train engineer, you know, that would -- manned that he manned the trains. So she\ntold her that the Ukraine's, because sh-sh-she's Polish, I'm sure that the Poles did the same\nthing. When they took together -- when they took the Jews, you know, they took them\ntogether t-to be put on the trains, that some went, they took their eyes out, while alive you\nknow, took their eyes out, cut their tongues off. This is what her h-husband witnessed. Cut\ntheir penis off. This is what they did to -- to -- to -- to our people and th -- and th --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning of Tape Four, Side A",
        "A: And this is why they put it there. They -- they took this from my cover, they made a very\nhuge -- I mean they had it also probably from the Auschwitz album, there's an Auschwitz\nalbum and this is where they -- they have this photograph from. They put this in the\nHolocaust Museum. There's also one large photograph that I am -- there are a group of\nwomen and I am one of the -- one of the women, one of the girls standing there, I don't\nknow, you probably wouldn't recognize me because, you know, so many years, but I\nrecognize myself and so they had taken this one out also and they have a display there and\nmy -- my mother, sh-she's 55 or 56 [inaudible], but she looks like 90, see? Because she had\nanjus that my brother made her and then they -- and then they chased her out, you know,\nfrom the ghetto, sh-she forgot it, she wanted to go back in, they didn't let her look for that,\nwhich wouldn't matter anyway, it was -- would have been only for a few days, because after\n-- after that, after we arrived, they killed her.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah --",
        "A: Sh-She is -- she knows where she's walking, she knows where she's going. No -- no --\nnobody else -- you know why she knows? Because in the train when my brother-in-law --\nwhen those prisoners came on -- on the train to chase us out and tell us to leave everything,\none prisoner -- my brother-in-law still had a watch and he gave it t-to this prisoner and he\ntold him, \u201cTell me what's going on here.\u201d And my mother was standing next to my brother-\nin-law and me. Mina, as soon as the train opened, ran down with the child to get some air,\nbecause it was, you can imagine, traveling so many days, so many people and -- and it was\nhorrible. Th-Th-The trip in itself was -- was an absolute horrible experience. So he said, \u201cIf\nyou have children, give the -- give the children to mothers with other children, because if\nnot, your wife would -- would be killed with the child and women with children and older\nwomen are being gassed, so --\u201d And my mother heard this, she ran down and I heard it too,\nbut I didn -- I couldn't even believe it, you know? I -- I thought, \u201cThis is -- he's -- he's\nsaying something crazy.\u201d I ran down after my mother, I came over to Mina and my mother\ncame over to Mina and tells her, \u201cDarling, I just heard that women with children will have it\nvery easy, because all they will have to do is take care of the children. But young people\nwill be sent on hard labor,\u201d and she said, \u201cand I'm not well enough to go on hard labor. Let\nme have your child.\u201d But Mina even -- she didn't have a -- a clue yet what she wants to do,\nmy mother didn't ask her, removed the child from her arms. And as soon as she had the\nchild, she -- she was pushed to the side where the women with children were and she yelled\nout to me, \u201cTake care of your sister,\u201d to me, you know, because she knew what my sister wi-\nwill -- will suffer when she find out. So she knew where she was going.",
        "A: Actually, my sister discovered it. She -- she -- in Israel she was watching television and\nthey gave that movie, \u201cWorlds of War.\u201d Worl --",
        "A: World --",
        "A: \u201cThe World at War,\u201d yeah. And it flashed on the -- on the television screen and my\nbrother lived [indecipherable], my brother passed away since then and he just thought,\n\u201cOh, I hope M-Mina didn't see it,\u201d and he called right away Nathan, her husband to make\nsure that he doesn't put on television and he says, \u201cMina is in shock and -- and she saw it\u201d\nand and sh-she -- she -- that time she got -- she got a -- a stroke. I mean, she came out of it\nand -- and -- and then when she got better, she went to the television media and asked for --\ntold them. They wanted she should talk about, but Mina never -- never could talk anything\nabout it. Not only wouldn't she talk about it, Mina completely wiped out everything that\nhappened before, only that she knows she lost her child, but she doesn't remember anything,\nanything -- everything that I am telling you, about seeing these girls beaten to death, about -\n- only -- she remembers only just that I was beaten, because the only -- this made impression\nd-de -- on her. And everything else she completely blocked out. So then th-they made --\nthey gave her a big photograph and I have it a regular ph-photograph now, you know, at -- at\nhome. And from that photograph I-I gave the strudel to my -- to the publisher that I want\nthis as my cover. An-And this photograph 1s also here, because I don't want it should -- it\nshould, you know sometimes this gets stolen or -- or the other one it has a -- a cover again in\ncloths. So -- so I-I have it here, inside the book. [inaudible]",
        "A: So shattering. [inaudible]. I'm glad I have it.",
        "A: Well, yeah -- no -- no, p-people that know me recogni -- they always come and say, \u201cYou\nknow, I saw you on -- on the --\u201d B-But I'm there very little, only in the middle and then in\nthe end. Did you see the end, what I --",
        "A: I-I think the end I-I-I find everybody says that it's very powerful, the end when -- when I\ntell them that when they bring their children, you know, to the museum, then they will see\nall these shoes. Did you see that end?",
        "A: What it means to us is one thing, what it means to other people is another thing. I-I in-\nincluded a few po-poems in my book and this is one of my poems which is in my book,\n\u201cSentenced to Live.\u201d I-I named it \u201cPromise.\u201d \u201cI shut away and locked the painful\nmemories. I begged you, give me peace, but you ignored my pleas. I saw my mother's face\nand then I heard, Celia, bear witness to our murder. I lighted a candle every night, I\ndavenned in temple and prayed for your plight. You followed me chanting the same\nrequest, tell them, tell them, or we cannot rest. Day and day I found an excuse, but you\nhaunted me always, so it was no use. I tried to describe it, but could not express the torture,\nthe fear, the hate, the distress. I'd shat at you -- I'd shout at you, please just leave me alone.\nI put horror behind me, I have a life of my own. When I hum to the children, you sang\nalong, tell them, tell them in your song. Why should the young ones suffer our pain? What\ngood if they know, what do they gain? You look at my soul with a deadly stare, if you don't\ntell them, how can they care? We must be remembered, all must know, of that season of hell\n40 years ago. Tell them Celia, tell them now. I lifted my pen, I will, I vow.\u201d",
        "A: My children really learned the first time when I started to speak at schools and my son\nwas in that school, but whenever I spoke in his class, I didn't want him to be present, so he\nwas not present. But when I would have tapes and they would just go take the tapes and\nlisten to -- to them. And also, when I started to -- when I published my poems, when I\npublished my book and this is how they came to know. But not -- I will tell you something,\nevery child that lives with a survivor, knows quite a bit even if you don't talk to him,\nbecause of the way we are -- some parents are overprotective, some are fearful, some are\nvery nervous, some are sick and -- and they somehow know that -- that this is from -- from\nway back.",
        "A: Not -- not as adults, now when they're adults I feel they had the formative years, you\nknow, where -- where they are done and -- and as adults and now that they have children of\ntheir own and is okay for them to know and -- and they can handle it now much better. And\n-- and also this -- a few generations removed, which we have now already grandchildren and\nit's never, you know, t-the same as -- as when it 1s -- when you live with that person.\nGrandchildren don't live with their grandparents. It's one thing to know and it is one thing to\n-- to have to be raised by -- by the parents of Holocaust survivors, that went -- saw so much,\nit's somehow, it gets to -- to your children because in many ways we couldn't do the same\nthing as the American parents did. We were more often sick, we were more often -- we\nwere, like I was away for so many years. It certainly was a bad time for my youngest child -\n- for my oldest child and I always worried what effect this is going to be on him. And -- but\nall in all, thank God that it didn't turn out as bad as I was afraid 1-it would. I'm -- I'm sure\nthat it left him with some, you know -- if he's not kirtis -- he doesn't like to appear in -- in\nfront of a lot of people, let's say, as a speaker. I can do all that, but m-my oldest son was\nalways very nervous to -- to give a -- a speech or -- or to -- but now h-he overcame already,\nbecause as a dentist he sometimes had to go to conventions and -- and -- and also speak and\n-- and explain certain methods, because he's a s -- he specialized in anesthesiology and --\nand there aren't that many in this country, only about 50, you know, that apply anesthet-\nanesthesiology in their dentistry. So he even, in fact he even told me once that h-he took up\nacting j-just, you know, for a-a-an outlet, in order to overcome his stage fright, you know?\nSo there is something always that -- I-I find that the best adjusted of my three children is my\nyoungest son. He can -- he's a very good speaker, he is -- he -- he's a -- and also, you know,\nhe's involved because he -- he was always helping cancer children, h-he was a volunteer\ncounselor in a camp for cancer children and then he would go to visit them in the hospitals\nand to go -- unfortunately to their funerals and to go and then they -- they honored him in --\nin one of the hotels and there were like 2000 people, was a very, very rich place. It was, of\ncourse, to get -- it was a fundraising, he went and he gave a speech that everybody got up\nand -- and gave him a standing ovation, it was -- all over was his, you know, on the wall\nthey had those blown up, like video of him because if not they couldn't see him and -- and\nhear him because it was a -- a huge room. So -- but he has no problem about speaking and\nI'm very pleased.",
        "A: M-My second husband 1s also a Holocaust survivor. I feel I could never marry anybody\nelse, I don't think anybody else -- you know, y-y-you have to be able to -- to understand\neach other and -- and to live with each other and -- and h -- and he was one of the longest\npeople in -- in a camp. He was five and a half years in Buchenwald. And I-I married -- I\nmarried him three and a half years after my husband died and we are almost married no-\nnow, it's going to be 10 years. He is a very apt person and he also wr-wrote a book about his\nexperiences, I think this is what we, you know, if y -- somehow -- this is really how we met,\nbecause he didn't know how to go about publishing his book. And -- and so we had a lot in\ncommon and he's retired already 15 years, so we live partially -- a half a year we live, about\nseven months we live in Great Neck and five months we live in Florida and don't make this\n-- as a table -- we have only to talk about the Holocaust just because we are both Holocaust\nsurvivors. We usually don't like to, you know, keep this as a regular conversation. I talk\nabout the Holocaust only if -- if I have a reason for, like -- like this is a reason or if it comes\nup sometimes, of course when you are with --with friends and somehow you -- you\nremember certain things and -- and conversation leads to it, but I'm not -- I-I -- d -- I don't\nlike just to, you know, keep this as a daily menu on my agenda.",
        "A: My husband is a average tennis player, so a half a day he plays tennis. I also play a little\nbit tennis. We play bridge, we -- we go -- being that we are in a community here that they\nhave all kinds of -- I-I belong to Hadassah, we have functions, we attend, we be-belo -- I\nbelong to every organization that -- whether it's Holocaust, whether it is -- the Holocaust, if\nyou're a very big organization, it's called -- Eidnow, in fact we have big parties there to\nraise money for Israel and I-I keep busy by -- also my -- my sister, unfortunately is not\nwell, she lives a-across the street so I try to help her out a lot, I go out shopping for her, I\nspend time with my sister that comes here from Israel and is here. We go swimming, we --\nwe try to live a very -- here we have friends, we entertain.",
        "A: The one that was once in Israel. And Mina just comes, Mina lives in Israel and she\ncomes here to spend winters with us, because her husband also died, he died two year --\nthree years ago. So sh-she -- we go there -- I go there once a year and she comes back with\nuS.",
        "A: Yes, th-this was the -- this was the first time that there was going to be a -- a Holocaust --\ns-something public, you know, a Holocaust reunion. It was called the World Gathering. And\nI-I flew to that and my daughter was supposed to come with me and lo and behold, she had\nmoved that time, because her husband had just finished his specialty as a -- as a dentist and\na root canal and she moved back from -- from Pennsylvania to Great Neck, to my house\nand she left her passport in the furniture that they had stored in -- 1-1-in Pennsylvania and\nwe came -- she came with the suitcases to my house and without the passport. And I\nremained with the tickets and with a hotel reservation and I went there myself. And this is\nwhen -- when we went to, you know, it was a very moving experience, because it was the\nfirst time that ever -- that this was publicized and that we had workshops and that we had\nspeakers and most of all that in six languages, it was handed down, th-the remembrance\nfrom -- from generation to generation and I -- when I saw those candles, it was like\neverybody lit a candles and it was like all these candles were shining as stars for the six\nmillion and it was one of the most moving and heartbreaking experiences for all of us. There\nwere people that hadn't seen each other 40, 50 years that found each other -- that was 50\nyears, it was -- I think it was all together one time. I'm not even sure, that was in 19 -- I\nthink 1980, because --",
        "A: Yeah, a-around there. And after that I have -- I-I have always attended every gathering.\nThe one that was in Washington, the one that was in Philadelphia, [inaudible]\nPhiladelphia. And anything that has to do with the Holocaust I am very partial and support\nit -- supportive.",
        "A: Yeah, so far I-I never did. I -- to my hometown I-I-I never want to return. I never want to\nwalk those streets again, I never want to see the house again. But I would like to return once\nto visit the camps and I'm getting ready for it, perhaps -- not this year, maybe next year.\nBecause I would like to go with one of my children. So I have to wait when -- when they\ncan make it because, you know they're all -- they're all -- they have s-small children and\nlittle kids really are not yet -- I don't want them to come. But I would | -- want my adult\nchildren to come. So I hope to go next year, not this y -- not this coming year. Un-\nUnfortunately my present husband has cancer also now. But -- but he is in treatment and he\nis doing much better.",
        "A: His name -- my present husband's name is Isaac Pollak and -- and he -- we have a very\ngood life together and we each made a new life, knowing that we cannot bring back the\nspouses and we each had very good marriages before, so this 1s wonderful companionship\nthat we have and -- and my children are very happy about it, they were very supportive and\nthey wanted f -- and they like my present husband and he likes them. And we hope that our\nsuffering will -- will be the last and that a future generation will never have to experience\nwhat we had to and -- and that they will really uphold the memory of th-the six millions and\nthat they will remember not only the six millions, but they will also remember the survivors\nbecause we had -- our lives was never the same and -- and this is just part of history and --\nand so that they should know what happens when -- when such -- when such terrible tragedy\nhits our -- our -- a people and they should always remember that we are all born the same\nand we all have the right to be free, to educate our children and freedom and to worship and\n-- and this will -- may -- and if they will remember and all the nations will remember, then\nthey -- there will be a much better world for their children to live in.",
        "A: I -- Iam just very grateful that -- for the work that all of you are doing and -- and I feel\nthat you are our saviors by doing that, because if we wouldn't have people like you, then\nthere wouldn't be remembering -- Holocaust memorials because there wouldn't be -- who\nwould take care of this, so I thankful all the people that are involved.\n"
