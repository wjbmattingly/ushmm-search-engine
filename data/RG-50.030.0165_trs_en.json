        "A: Well, what happened afterwards? My father was drafted. We were left with my mother at\nhome and, of course, she cried, we cried when my father left and afterwards in '42 when they\ncame around one or two in the morning to pick us up, my mother, my husband, and my sister\nwere taken away. My sister also. Also they took my brother's little sister. She was young. And\nwhen they came they told us to get dressed. The police came in the morning...one or two in the\nmorning when we were asleep they came. They kind of raided the whole neighborhood. We got\nup. We got dressed. I told them that my mother was drafted. My mother showed them all the\npapers. No, no. We have to go. And they picked us up, but they also picked up other neighbors.\nYes. Yes.",

They\ndidn't pick him up. He was not on a list. So they before came and registered all the people, made\na list of people. Yes, yes. Somebody came and took the names down, a policeman, and made up\na list. I told him let's not put our names down, because you never know what's going to happen.\nAnd that's why I'm always afraid. And he said well, 1f everybody puts their name on a list, why\nshould I not? I don't want to be left all by myself here so anyway he put his name down on a list\ntoo for all of us.",
        "Q: And where did they take you when they picked you up from home?",
        "A: They took us to the police station. They took us there. The first roundup...we were in the\nfirst roundup. We were taken to the school. Then another batch of people came and then a third\none and when the second and third round of people were...the third round of people were taken,\nthey started making so much noise that they didn't take them anymore. They broke windows.\nThey really created a stir. Some had children. We also had children, but we were quiet, hoping\nthat they'd let us go. So other people whom they had just taken but started creating a ruckus, they\nsent them home. Now I'm sorry too. How come we didn't make some noise too? Maybe we could\nhave gotten away from being sent away. So they came. They took us to the school. My mother\nwas coming, crying, to let us go. They didn't. My mother showed all the papers about my father\nbeing in the army and they said well, maybe they'll be freed later on. My mother went to the\npolice. Every where she showed the papers...nothing. So we were taken away. We stayed at the\nschool maybe about two days and then they took us to Socora (ph). They...in Socora they put us\non a train. It was a long train. It had brought people from all over, not...many cities, not just us.\nAnd took all of us who were there in that neighborhood who were on the lists, but not the others.\nThe others were returned from that school back to home. So they loaded us in cars...",
        "Q: Were they freight cars or passenger cars?",
        "A: No, that was for cattle...cattle cars...for for for cattle. So they put us in there. We stayed\nabout a few...a while, just...they closed the doors and they let us out just so we wouldn't...so we'd\nuse a bathroom. We left. We stopped by ; , and we got all the way to in\nthese closed cattle cars. From there when they opened the the doors and they left the doors open,\nand we kept going. From the train we could see all kinds of things, and we got to a point...I\nthought they were trees and wineries, but no...they were people who were in this place, had been\nthere for maybe a week. They were just gathered there.",
        "Q: Were they gypsies?",
        "A: Yes, yes. Gypsies from all over. When I saw from the train all these, we started crying.\nWe were really crying, and we saw a long, long ditch. It was long, long, long, like the train. We\nstayed there until the night fell. We didn't hear anything. Nobody told us anything. We only\nheard the train whistle and felt it start and the soldiers who were there, remained down. We didn't\nknow what would happen to us or what the soldiers would do or that they would throw us in the\ntrenches. After us maybe something happened and they they threw the people down in the\nditches. We got off at that place where there were so many people assembled, and some military\nsoldiers came and they made us walk about two days. We walked about two days. And then we\nrested.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit how this march, when you walked down...tell me what happened?\nWell, you know...just tell me a little bit how the march was?",
        "A: Well, we walked day and night without any food, without water, without anything. If you\nsaw a little bit of water like a puddle and if you wanted to kneel down to drink some, they would\nshoot you because there were two guards or something like that with weapons, with arms, so if\nyou stopped to drink the water, they would shoot you right there. So we just continued walking.",
        "Q: Did you see people who were shot? Did you hear shooting?",
        "A: No, no, no. Because everybody knew that if 1t were after...the guards were after us. There\nwere soldiers along side us, so we saw that the old women, children...children say Mom, I can't\ncarry you any more on my back. I'll throw you down. I can't carry you. You are heavy. The\nmother couldn't walk. Her feet ached. So once this woman just let her mother down from her\nback and left her there. The...but then she went back and picked up her mother whom she had left\non the ground. Afterwards the girl still couldn't walk with her mother on her back. Left her\nbehind and the woman just was left to die on the road. Women with children in her arms couldn't\ncarry them anymore. They were starved. Then we rested by a fountain there and I drank some\nwater and we continued walking until there in that village...what's the name of it...I forgot.\nMaybe you could remind me.",
        "Q: ee,",
        "A: Yeah. So they took us there so we stayed there about two or three months.",
        "Q: Where did you stay?",
        "A: Outside under the sky, on the fields. There was corn left on the fields. We'd go and pick it\nup. We'd pick up some grains left on the ground. We would make a fire on a tray and we'd cook\nthese grains and eat it. And then we just had this older man who took us to . There there\nwere these homes...I guess Russians. I don't know who they were. There were gypsies there still\nbut they were really housed well. When they took us in they put us, five, six families in\none home with the children. Anyway with everything, and it was on the banks of the .\nYou could see the water shine at night. And we stayed there until it got cooler outside. Well,\nwhat do we do here? No food. What do we do...just sit here to to tear...to wear down these stone\nwalls? We just went back to...from where we left. Afterwards we stayed there for a while. He got\nsick. Couldn't stay there any longer.",
        "Q: What did he have?",
        "A: Well, you know...hunger. He got weaker. He lost weight. He got brown in his face. You\ncould look at him and see and anyway I said well man, rather than dying right under my eyes,\nyou know, just leave. If God wants you to escape, you will maybe feel sorry for us and you will\ncome and take us out of here. Go home. See maybe my father heard about us and he'll come find\nus. Well, anyway he escaped and left.",
        "Q: What did you do after he left?",
        "A: He left and I was left alone with my sister and the little girl. Yeah. What shall we do? It\nwas...how do you call these things that you do...I don't know how to call it. You make rope from\nit and it just used to grow wildly...some kind of tall grasses, and we went with my sister and we\npicked a lot of these tall grasses and we used to make them...braid them, and made ropes from\nthem. And we used to go to the Russians, to the bazaar and we sold these things. And they'd give\nus a loaf of bread, some flour, two or three potatoes when it was warm. Then the cold arrived and\nthey didn't have any of this stuff either, so that's how we lived...from one day to another.\nNot...and we put aside some things so we could eat it gradually, not just in one sitting. My father\nheard about us. He came to pick us up. The first time he came...",
        "Q: How did he hear about it?",
        "A: My mother wrote to him in and she told him about it. He came to pick us up.\nWhen he came there, he saw us there. He looked us up and when he came he said see, if you\ndidn't listen to me, he says. You didn't listen at home. You didn't listen to me here. He came with\nsome food that he got from his army unit.",
        "Q: Where was his army stationed?",
        "A: At . So he came with two knapsacks full of food that they gave him to take us,\nto us. Here...some cold food and take it to them. He came. When he came, he found us there. He\nsaw my sister. She was already on her death bed almost. She was sick.",
        "Q: What did she have?",
        "A: Typhus. You know, typhus. We, of course, jumped on his...in his arms and kissed him\nand he said just leave me alone and go and eat. But you know there was almost nothing left to eat\nbecause people had stolen everything by then. My father says you are too good. That's why you\ngot all the way here, because even at home when I asked you to eat, you wouldn't eat. Well, there\nwas nothing left. Everything had been stolen. And my father went to the gendarme station post\nthere and to tell them who he was and he needed papers to take us away because he wasn't\nallowed to come in there otherwise. They did not approve the request to take us away. You go to\nBucharest and you bring an order from Bucharest to give you back your family, to take her\nhome. He went to Bucharest and nobody gave him any approval. Meanwhile, until he came back\nbecause it took a long time until he came back from Bucharest to there, in the meanwhile...what\nshall I do with her. I didn't have any medication. She was sleeping on bare ground. We didn't\nhave any sheets, nothing. I would go and collect grass from outside and put it on the ground to\nsleep on. So she died.",
        "Q: You are talking about your sister?",
        "A: Yes, yes. My sister died. I was left with the little girl. When she died many people died\nand whoever died, they were thrown out of this barn-like woods, so you are in a stable, yes,\nwithout windows, without doors, no roof. And whoever was dying they just put outside, outside\nthe wall. Well, every day two, three people are dying at night again, until there was a big hole\ndug outside and they put some trees in there. They set fire to these trees with the people and they\nburnt them up. When he...",
        "Q: Your father?",
        "A: Yes. When my father returned from Bucharest, he went home first. He knew and told my\nmother I don't know if I'll bring back both daughters. Be happy if I bring you one. When my\nmother heard this because...if they had taken my mother away and I had left alone, maybe my\nsister would have escaped. My mother said here's some clothes. Take it for the girls to wear. My\nfather said don't give clothes for both of them. Just give me clothes for one. My mother realized\nthat she was no longer alive, so my father only took stuff for...clothing for me, shoes and\nsomething for the little girl for his sister and he came. He came in here. Get dressed. Where's\nyour sister? She died. He was sorry too. He started crying. He said well, maybe I could have\ntaken her. As ill as she was, I would have managed to save her but they didn't give me the\napproval. And then we left. We went to the station. There was a train with soldiers who were\nreturning from the front. They put us in a room there where they gave us some tea, bread, but\nwho could eat anything when your heart was so heavy. I was hungry but I just couldn't eat\nanymore with the little girl after me. The train arrived and we got on this train. There were these\nreturning soldiers in there. They were wounded, and...",
        "Q: You were there with your father?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. He was a soldier. He had his weapon with him. He stayed on the stair and\nwe Stayed inside near these casualties. And even if anyone were to would come to ask us who we\nwere, my father would tell them that nobody could go into the car because it was filled with sick\npeople, so we went back by , by , until we arrived back at home in a station...what's\nthe name of it...Socora.",
        "Q: But your father did not have the approval to take you?",
        "A: No, no, no. He didn't get it. And we got off at Socora. We arrived there and we got out of\nthe train and then he shot twice in the air. It was just dawn. My mother and my older brother\nknew that we were coming...the father would come with the sisters. We got into our\nneighborhood. All the people surrounded us...boys, girls. He he came, my husband. He started\ncrying.",
        "Q: In our house what was there...1in our house?",
        "A: There were...let's see...we had two rooms and my mother had two rooms and in the two\nrooms which were ours, there were these people who were...had been drafted. My mother told\nthem to stay there. They were...sorry, I can't understand what you're...anyway, the neighbors\nwould come. They were helping my mother. They used to give her food because my mother was\nso restless, was like crazy. She couldn't just live a normal life until I returned home. She was so\ndesperate. Yes. The neighbors came. When they say me, everyone jumped on me. They washed\nme. They dressed me. They put shoes on my feet, because I had nothing left in the house. The\nhouse was empty. Everything just was gone, and they brought me cushions, covers, a\nchair...whatever I needed, not that I needed a chair but...and I stayed there. My mother got ill.\nShe also became ill. My father, he was...he returned from the front wounded and he died. She\ndied. And I was left with my husband and with my brothers.",
        "Q: In what year did you come back?",

        "Q: And what happened with the little girl, the sister of your husband?",
        "A: Well, she was ill. She had been ill. She couldn't recuperate, poor thing. I prepared some\nointments. I made teas for her. I made some hot bath, but nothing helped her, poor thing, so she\ndied. She died. The neighbors buried her. How could I do that? I didn't have any money to do\nthat. And they buried her. They made her casket and everything and they buried her. And I was\nleft... we were left with my mother. And after this, the hunger started, the hardships in life. He\nwas drafted in the army in '45, and we went to . During the starvation times we stayed\nthere. We stayed a long time there until he was drafted. They drafted him from there. That's\nwhere he went into the military. And then we went back home, to our home. Only then we kind\nof quieted down a little bit. In'45 we calmed down. We looked for some jobs. We painted the\nhouse. We just went back to normal life. And my mother calmed down a little bit because she\nsaw me. She became sad...every time I told her however what happened, you know...camp and\nmy brothers...one is still alive. The younger one is still alive. The older one is dead. He died in\n'40...'44 or '45. Yeah. And about...this is my story.",
        "Q: Thank you. Thank you so much.",
        "A: For nothing. This 1s the pain that we carry and every time I remember I can't stand this,\nbecause I know how much we suffered and I tell my grandchildren and my daughters and my\ngrandchildren are dear to me like the son of my eyes...like the apple of my eyes.",
        "Q: I would like to thank you again very much, Mrs. Moise. We would like to thank you.",
        "A: I think I realize...you know, I'm not a literate person. People didn't go to school at that\ntime. We were so miserable. We were four children in the family, and my mother didn't know\nhow to feed us. She couldn't even think about sending us to school, and now when I think I don't\nknow how many millions of lei(ph) I could be paid just to forget the pain and the wretched life\nwe had. If we tell other people, they don't believe you. Nobody believes you and when I tell my\nchildren, they tell me...Grandma, tell us some other stories. I take them near me and I say I'll tell\nyou some stories and the grandchildren will say, ha...Grandma wants to tell us her stories. Yeah,\nthe grandchildren love us, but when I go to their house they don't know what to do for us to keep\nus there, because they know I raised them up. I helped them a lot, very much.",

We stopped by ; , and we got all the way to in\nthese closed cattle cars. From there when they opened the the doors and they left the doors open,\nand we kept going. From the train we could see all kinds of things, and we got to a point...I\nthought they were trees and wineries, but no...they were people who were in this place, had been\nthere for maybe a week. They were just gathered there.",
        "A: Yes, yes. Gypsies from all over. When I saw from the train all these, we started crying.\nWe were really crying, and we saw a long, long ditch. It was long, long, long, like the train. We\nstayed there until the night fell. We didn't hear anything. Nobody told us anything. We only\nheard the train whistle and felt it start and the soldiers who were there, remained down. We didn't\nknow what would happen to us or what the soldiers would do or that they would throw us in the\ntrenches. After us maybe something happened and they they threw the people down in the\nditches. We got off at that place where there were so many people assembled, and some military\nsoldiers came and they made us walk about two days. We walked about two days. And then we\nrested.",
        "A: Well, we walked day and night without any food, without water, without anything. If you\nsaw a little bit of water like a puddle and if you wanted to kneel down to drink some, they would\nshoot you because there were two guards or something like that with weapons, with arms, so if\nyou stopped to drink the water, they would shoot you right there. So we just continued walking.",
        "A: No, no, no. Because everybody knew that if 1t were after...the guards were after us. There\nwere soldiers along side us, so we saw that the old women, children...children say Mom, I can't\ncarry you any more on my back. I'll throw you down. I can't carry you. You are heavy. The\nmother couldn't walk. Her feet ached. So once this woman just let her mother down from her\nback and left her there. The...but then she went back and picked up her mother whom she had left\non the ground. Afterwards the girl still couldn't walk with her mother on her back. Left her\nbehind and the woman just was left to die on the road. Women with children in her arms couldn't\ncarry them anymore. They were starved. Then we rested by a fountain there and I drank some\nwater and we continued walking until there in that village...what's the name of it...I forgot.\nMaybe you could remind me.",
        "A: Yeah. So they took us there so we stayed there about two or three months.",
        "A: Outside under the sky, on the fields. There was corn left on the fields. We'd go and pick it\nup. We'd pick up some grains left on the ground. We would make a fire on a tray and we'd cook\nthese grains and eat it. And then we just had this older man who took us to . There there\nwere these homes...I guess Russians. I don't know who they were. There were gypsies there still\nbut they were really housed well. When they took us in they put us, five, six families in\none home with the children. Anyway with everything, and it was on the banks of the .\nYou could see the water shine at night. And we stayed there until it got cooler outside. Well,\nwhat do we do here? No food. What do we do...just sit here to to tear...to wear down these stone\nwalls? We just went back to...from where we left. Afterwards we stayed there for a while. He got\nsick. Couldn't stay there any longer.",
        "A: Well, you know...hunger. He got weaker. He lost weight. He got brown in his face. You\ncould look at him and see and anyway I said well man, rather than dying right under my eyes,\nyou know, just leave. If God wants you to escape, you will maybe feel sorry for us and you will\ncome and take us out of here. Go home. See maybe my father heard about us and he'll come find\nus. Well, anyway he escaped and left.",
        "A: He left and I was left alone with my sister and the little girl. Yeah. What shall we do? It\nwas...how do you call these things that you do...I don't know how to call it. You make rope from\nit and it just used to grow wildly...some kind of tall grasses, and we went with my sister and we\npicked a lot of these tall grasses and we used to make them...braid them, and made ropes from\nthem. And we used to go to the Russians, to the bazaar and we sold these things. And they'd give\nus a loaf of bread, some flour, two or three potatoes when it was warm. Then the cold arrived and\nthey didn't have any of this stuff either, so that's how we lived...from one day to another.\nNot...and we put aside some things so we could eat it gradually, not just in one sitting. My father\nheard about us. He came to pick us up. The first time he came...",
        "A: My mother wrote to him in and she told him about it. He came to pick us up.\nWhen he came there, he saw us there. He looked us up and when he came he said see, if you\ndidn't listen to me, he says. You didn't listen at home. You didn't listen to me here. He came with\nsome food that he got from his army unit.",
        "A: At . So he came with two knapsacks full of food that they gave him to take us,\nto us. Here...some cold food and take it to them. He came. When he came, he found us there. He\nsaw my sister. She was already on her death bed almost. She was sick.",
        "A: Typhus. You know, typhus. We, of course, jumped on his...in his arms and kissed him\nand he said just leave me alone and go and eat. But you know there was almost nothing left to eat\nbecause people had stolen everything by then. My father says you are too good. That's why you\ngot all the way here, because even at home when I asked you to eat, you wouldn't eat. Well, there\nwas nothing left. Everything had been stolen. And my father went to the gendarme station post\nthere and to tell them who he was and he needed papers to take us away because he wasn't\nallowed to come in there otherwise. They did not approve the request to take us away. You go to\nBucharest and you bring an order from Bucharest to give you back your family, to take her\nhome. He went to Bucharest and nobody gave him any approval. Meanwhile, until he came back\nbecause it took a long time until he came back from Bucharest to there, in the meanwhile...what\nshall I do with her. I didn't have any medication. She was sleeping on bare ground. We didn't\nhave any sheets, nothing. I would go and collect grass from outside and put it on the ground to\nsleep on. So she died.",
        "A: Yes, yes. My sister died. I was left with the little girl. When she died many people died\nand whoever died, they were thrown out of this barn-like woods, so you are in a stable, yes,\nwithout windows, without doors, no roof. And whoever was dying they just put outside, outside\nthe wall. Well, every day two, three people are dying at night again, until there was a big hole\ndug outside and they put some trees in there. They set fire to these trees with the people and they\nburnt them up. When he...",
        "A: Yes. When my father returned from Bucharest, he went home first. He knew and told my\nmother I don't know if I'll bring back both daughters. Be happy if I bring you one. When my\nmother heard this because...if they had taken my mother away and I had left alone, maybe my\nsister would have escaped. My mother said here's some clothes. Take it for the girls to wear. My\nfather said don't give clothes for both of them. Just give me clothes for one. My mother realized\nthat she was no longer alive, so my father only took stuff for...clothing for me, shoes and\nsomething for the little girl for his sister and he came. He came in here. Get dressed. Where's\nyour sister? She died. He was sorry too. He started crying. He said well, maybe I could have\ntaken her. As ill as she was, I would have managed to save her but they didn't give me the\napproval. And then we left. We went to the station. There was a train with soldiers who were\nreturning from the front. They put us in a room there where they gave us some tea, bread, but\nwho could eat anything when your heart was so heavy. I was hungry but I just couldn't eat\nanymore with the little girl after me. The train arrived and we got on this train. There were these\nreturning soldiers in there. They were wounded, and...",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. He was a soldier. He had his weapon with him. He stayed on the stair and\nwe Stayed inside near these casualties. And even if anyone were to would come to ask us who we\nwere, my father would tell them that nobody could go into the car because it was filled with sick\npeople, so we went back by , by , until we arrived back at home in a station...what's\nthe name of it...Socora.",
        "A: No, no, no. He didn't get it. And we got off at Socora. We arrived there and we got out of\nthe train and then he shot twice in the air. It was just dawn. My mother and my older brother\nknew that we were coming...the father would come with the sisters. We got into our\nneighborhood. All the people surrounded us...boys, girls. He he came, my husband. He started\ncrying.",
        "A: There were...let's see...we had two rooms and my mother had two rooms and in the two\nrooms which were ours, there were these people who were...had been drafted. My mother told\nthem to stay there. They were...sorry, I can't understand what you're...anyway, the neighbors\nwould come. They were helping my mother. They used to give her food because my mother was\nso restless, was like crazy. She couldn't just live a normal life until I returned home. She was so\ndesperate. Yes. The neighbors came. When they say me, everyone jumped on me. They washed\nme. They dressed me. They put shoes on my feet, because I had nothing left in the house. The\nhouse was empty. Everything just was gone, and they brought me cushions, covers, a\nchair...whatever I needed, not that I needed a chair but...and I stayed there. My mother got ill.\nShe also became ill. My father, he was...he returned from the front wounded and he died. She\ndied. And I was left with my husband and with my brothers.",
        "A: At the end of '43. It was by now...I remember really...1n New Year's Eve, '43-44.",
        "A: Well, she was ill. She had been ill. She couldn't recuperate, poor thing. I prepared some\nointments. I made teas for her. I made some hot bath, but nothing helped her, poor thing, so she\ndied. She died. The neighbors buried her. How could I do that? I didn't have any money to do\nthat. And they buried her. They made her casket and everything and they buried her. And I was\nleft... we were left with my mother. And after this, the hunger started, the hardships in life. He\nwas drafted in the army in '45, and we went to . During the starvation times we stayed\nthere. We stayed a long time there until he was drafted. They drafted him from there. That's\nwhere he went into the military. And then we went back home, to our home. Only then we kind\nof quieted down a little bit. In'45 we calmed down. We looked for some jobs. We painted the\nhouse. We just went back to normal life. And my mother calmed down a little bit because she\nsaw me. She became sad...every time I told her however what happened, you know...camp and\nmy brothers...one is still alive. The younger one is still alive. The older one is dead. He died in\n'40...'44 or '45. Yeah. And about...this is my story.",
        "A: For nothing. This 1s the pain that we carry and every time I remember I can't stand this,\nbecause I know how much we suffered and I tell my grandchildren and my daughters and my\ngrandchildren are dear to me like the son of my eyes...like the apple of my eyes.",
        "A: I think I realize...you know, I'm not a literate person. People didn't go to school at that\ntime. We were so miserable. We were four children in the family, and my mother didn't know\nhow to feed us. She couldn't even think about sending us to school, and now when I think I don't\nknow how many millions of lei(ph) I could be paid just to forget the pain and the wretched life\nwe had. If we tell other people, they don't believe you. Nobody believes you and when I tell my\nchildren, they tell me...Grandma, tell us some other stories. I take them near me and I say I'll tell\nyou some stories and the grandchildren will say, ha...Grandma wants to tell us her stories. Yeah,\nthe grandchildren love us, but when I go to their house they don't know what to do for us to keep\nus there, because they know I raised them up. I helped them a lot, very much.",
        "A: I think now if my children would see us...they don't know what's happened to us, they\nwould be worried.",
        "A: But don't call my son. Call my older daughter. I'll give you her number, because they are\nworried about us. This is it.\n"
