        "Question: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr\ncollection. This is an interview with Paul Strassmann, conducted by Margaret West,\non January the 8\", 2004, in New Canaan, Connecticut. This interview is part of the\nUnited States Holocaust Memorial Museum\u2019s post-Holocaust interview project, and\nStrassmann on July the 11\", 1990. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ngratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible.\nThis is tape number one, side A.",
        "Answer: Good morning, this is Paul Strassmann. I-I\u2019m being interviewed by\nMargaret West in my home in New Canaan, Connecticut on January 8\", 2004. I am\nPaul Strassman who was born in Trencin, January 24, 1929.",
        "Q: Id first like to ask you to tell me about your early childhood.",
        "A: The earliest that I remember of my childhood was the -- the rituals of the family\nthat revolved around Jewish holidays. The peak holiday was, of course, always\nPesach, Passover, and it was big fuss, the dishes had to be changed. And lots of\ncooking took place. I always ran errands for my mother, helping her out. And I\nremember, perhaps as early as at the age of four or five, I learned how to pull the\ndough to make a streudel-thin dough. These are all trivial examples of what I\nremember.",
        "Q: Tell me more about those family traditions and rituals, o-other observances,\nbirthdays, religious holidays.",
        "A: The Jewish community in Trencin consisted of about 2,000 souls out of a\npopulation of about 19,000, so it was a very large Jewish community. The Jewish\ncommunity was centered around the school, which was a parochial school, and the\nsynagogue. The -- the -- so far as I can remember, my grandfather always took me\nto prayers on Saturday morning. There was regulated holidays that had to be kept,\nand my mother maintained originally, during the 30\u2019s, before the trouble started,\nshe maintained a kosher home. It was a -- a Jewish religious procedure that didn\u2019t\nmake much sense to me. What particularly didn't make sense to me 1s that all the\npraying was done in ancient Hebrew, and I didn\u2019t understand a word of it. They\nnever tried to teach us what all of this mumbo-jumbo meant. As a matter of fact, my\nfather, although he was one of the leading lights of the community, was known to\nbe highly critical of the local rabbi for never speaking Slovak, or even German that\npeople could understand. So there was this peculiar dichotomy, on the one hand of a\nvery formal, ritualized religious experience and a gradual rebellion against the --\nwhich was largely engendered by the time I was about seven, by my association\nwith the local Zionist organization, co -- Hashomer Hatzair, which was a leftist\norganization, who was, at least mildly speaking, anti-religious, socialist,\ncommunalist, and totally rejecting the existence in the -- in the -- 1n the -- in the --\nin the Slovak environment and totally focused on everybody getting out and moving\nto Palestine, and to live in a kibbutz in a communal Utopian environment. And as\ntime went on, this influence became stronger and stronger, because that was a\ncommunity that made lots of sense. The songs were very good. The -- the s-singing\nin the synagogue was always wailing. The -- the -- the singing in the Hashomer\nHatzair was very zippy. Subsequently I found out that much of the communist\nsinging was actually stolen from the Zionists, and -- but the songs were very strong.\nI always said, years later, that the communists and the leftists always had the best\nsongs and the ugliest girls. But the songs were great, and the entertainment was\ngreat, and there was a great deal of hiking, and -- and sort of rebellion organization -\n- r-rebellions -- rebellious thinking against the environment that was closing in on\nus, already starting in \u00b036.",
        "Q: Now, you were only seven when you joined this organization, so obviously it\nwas with your full family blessing.",
        "A: Well, I wouldn\u2019t say so. My grandfather, the religious grandfather highly\ndisapproved of it, but my sister, Ella already was part of this religious and -- anti-\nreligious attitude, and she had joined Hashomer Hatzair before me, so she sort of\ndragged me in. And also, one of the teachers in the Jewish school was a -- a rebel.\nHe turned out to be, subsequently, the editor of the Pravda newspaper, and of\ncourse, they shot him afterwards in the anti -- anti-Communist purges. But -- so\nthere was a very lively environment going on, a tremendous amount of change, and\na great deal of debates about the future and ideas. So I was exposed to ideas like\nthat very early in my childhood.",
        "Q: Hm. How much older than you was Ella? What -- when would she have been\nborn?",
        "A: My sister Ella was born in 1925, so she was four -- almost four and a half 0 --\nyears older than me, and I\u2019ve been always very, very close to her.",
        "Q: And what is her full name?",
        "A: Her full name is Ella Fabian. And she married a -- a -- just about the only\neligible Jewish boy who was left in Trencin after the Holocaust. He survived being\nput behind a false brick wall, and two bricks were removed from time to time to\nfeed him and take the soil out. And he never regained his health, but she married\nhim anyway, and they have two beautiful children. They are both medical doctors\nand I visit them quite often.",
        "Q: And the grandparents you spoke of, would they have been your -- were they\nmaternal?",
        "A: Well, my maternal grandmother is a lady of particular distinction that I talk\nabout very much. She was the local marriage broker. Did I ever tell the story about\nhere?",
        "Q: No. I would love to know.",
        "A: Oh, Grandmother Emma was really something very special. She was married to\nmy maternal grandfather, Alexander Weiner, who was a master cabinetmaker. It\nwas apparently a deep love because during the first World War, when he went to\nwar, and no, he didn\u2019t write for a couple of years, everybody thought that he died,\nand she got very, very sick. At any rate, meanwhile she made a living by having a\nvery small store selling embroidery. And this was embroidery patterns. So when the\nlittle girls had to come in to start working on their trousseau, they had to come to\nEmma\u2019s little shop and she imprinted on their pieces of linen, patterns. And 1n those\ndays, my mother tells me, the girls had to start working on their trousseau at the age\nof five. I mean -- I mean, if you didn\u2019t get married by the time you were 19, you\nwere really just not marriageable, or wa -- there was something wrong with you. At\nany rate, the girls started working on a trousseau, and because the girls had to come\nin and do very complex embroidery, my grandmother could tell how intelligent the\ngirl was, and how industrious she was, which was two criteria, basically, for\nrecommending somebody. So my maternal grandmother, Emma, apparently was\nknown very widely in the whole community as absolutely reliable I.Q. testing that -\n- that never made a mistake. And so she made a living, b-both as a marriage broker,\nas well as a -- as a Seller of embroidery.",
        "Q: So this would be done quite formally. People would pay for her advice?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes. Marriage brokers were paid, and of course the other thing was\nthat my grandfather Weiner made -- was known for making chests which were\ninlain -- inlaid -- h-he did very fine cabinetry. This was inlaid wood veneer. And so,\nusually somebody who was a little wealthier, at the age of six or seven, they were\nstarting to get on the queue with my grandfather Alexander, to start making a chest.\nWell, Grandfather Weiner liked to drink, and so the delivery on these chests was\nalways uncertain. But he was a fun guy. He was always singing, he -- he -- he was\nreally -- Grandfather Weiner took m-more c-care of me than anybody else in the\nfamily, because he had the time. And I was then apprenticed to him at the age of 11,\nand he taught me how to do inlaid veneer. So I worked for him for awhile. So it was\na very colorful kind of an experience.",
        "Q: And very loving.",
        "A: Well, yes and no. My father was a very tense person. And -- and there was\nalways a question -- course, I was -- I was a -- a child that caused trouble. I-I was\nknown as the troublemaker. I-I had a reputation as being a particularly rebellious\nchild. And years later some people tell me about kind of the pranks that I used to\npull, and my father was a very stern task maker, and I just had to tow the line and\nvery often I didn\u2019t. But the rebellion was there to begin with. My mother was a very\nloving woman, but she was really the brains behind the business, we ran a big\nbusiness, my father had a big business. She was the cashier. She was the\npeacemaker am-among the employees. She was very charitable. She was actually\nthe head of the WIZO, which was the women\u2019s Zionist organization, in Trencin.\nEverybody loved her, a-although there were some women who wore a grudge\nagainst her because she stole the best man in town. And 1 -- years later, a woman\nwho survived told me that she could have been my mother. She was a -- she had her\neye on -- on my father, except for that conniving matchmaker, your grandmother.\nSo that\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- these are the kinds of stories that one -- I remember.",
        "Q: What would be the kind of things that you would get up -- up to, and where did\nthat rebelliousness come from, I wonder, in your case?",
        "A: Where does the rebelliousness come from, I don\u2019t know. I was not considered to\nbe a bright child. I was not considered to be one of the leading scholars. I mean,\nthere were kids who were -- had better grades than I did. I was always looking at\nthings. I-I must say that one of the memories that I have was that in the third grade -\n- so I must have been eight years old, maybe less, I became very interested in\ncondoms, which was a no-no thing in those days. I mean, that was totally out of --\nout of bound for everybody. And I did not know exactly what it was, but I was told\nthis is really hush-hush. Well, what happened is that through some arrangements, I\ngot hold of a pack and brought them to school. Now, that was considered to be -- I\nwas badly beaten up. You know -- in those days, you know, the kids got physical\npunishment. I had to stretch my hands, and I got caned over my hands. Now why I\ndid it, I don\u2019t know, but it should have sort of -- you know, I got a kick out of it.\nParticularly the -- the teacher, who was caning me, was an idiot. And he didn't hear\nwell, he didn\u2019t speak well, didn\u2019t see well. He was in his last year before retirement,\nand I think I just had to get at him one way or another. So -- so, discipline was\nalways a problem with -- with me, including some really bad st-stunts that I pulled\non girls, but it\u2019s -- it\u2019s history.",
        "Q: We'll get to that.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Now, tell me the full names of your maternal grandparents and then I\u2019d like to\nask about your other grandparents.",
        "A: Yeah, the maternal grandfather was Alexander Weiner, my mother\u2019s -- she was\nborn Weiner, Frances Weiner. Her -- Alexander\u2019s wife was Emma wa -- she died\nquite early, in the 30\u2019s. And -- and they really mer -- wro -- ma -- had a major\nimprint on -- on -- on my sensibility and understanding and -- and -- and -- and care.\nBy the way, I just want you to know 1-is that Grandfather Weiner was a diabetic,\nwhich mean he had to eat early, and he -- he had to eat more frequently than\nanybody else. He made a mean garlic soup. I mean, really strong garlic soup. To\nthis day, a garlic soup, to me, is the best soup you can eat. And my whole family is\nstill kidding me about the fact that I will eat anything as long as it has garlic. But\nit\u2019s in memory of my grandfather.",
        "A: And your paternal grandparents?",
        "Q: Well, the paternal grandfather, Filip was a sick man, he had angina. He was a\nvery withdrawn kind of a person, never talked too much. He was no fun. The -- the -\n- he married a woman from a family that -- that had lots of aunts. Oh, it was a huge,\nhuge family. And my paternal grandfather\u2019s wife Anna was very small and she\nalways liked to give me food that I didn\u2019t get at home. So her specialty was baked\npotatoes with lots of onions, garlic and when you render goose fat, the skin -- sh-she\nmixed that in. And so for years I ate on that and of course when I came home I\ndidn\u2019t have an appetite, for which I was always punished, of course.",
        "Q: By the way, of your maternal grandfather, does any of his furniture survive, do\nyou know?",
        "A: I recognize some of his pieces in the homes of the Gentiles that I visited after the\nwar. They vehemently desi -- [coughs] deny -- let me stop. [tape break]. You -- your\nquestion was about precious possessions. One of the things that I learned from the\nHolocaust is never to care for precious possessions. I can walk away from this\nhouse any time.",
        "Q: Yeah, because you\u2019ve -- you -- you\u2019ve learned from those experiences.",
        "A: Yeah, what I learned from the experience is that the ability to walk away from\nsomething is very important, it\u2019s [indecipherable] survival. If there is a major lesson\nI\u2019ve learned from the Holocaust, it is my ability to just, when I see a problem,\nsomething going wrong, I just walk. And -- and I would say that is a characteristic\nwhich is something very deeply ingrained in my behavior. And if there is a single\npattern that describes what I learned from the Holocaust, is that ability to walk\naway.",
        "Q: We\u2019ll come back to that later in the interview, but because you\u2019ve mentioned it, I\nwill ask now about your decision to leave your home in 1948, when you, more than\nmany others, had a reason to stay. You had a heritage and things you could pick up",
        "A: Property, yeah. We had a heri -- heritage property. I could have inhe -- I --\npresumably I was inheriting lots of land, houses. My decision to walk was much\nearlier than when people were forced out by the communists. I -- although many of\nthe Jews who came back, they were spending their time reclaiming properties and\ngoing to court, and going through recovery and reclamation and restitution and all\nof this thing, I wanted no part of it. I didn\u2019t -- never touched it in my years there. I\nbasically felt that the -- the country was poisoned. The people that I saw on the\nstreets when I walked, were -- were the people who were killing and stealing and\nrobbing and -- and -- and committing crimes, including the people who gradually\ncame to the forefront 1n a political position. These are people I knew from the\nuprising as criminals. You know, I said, I just don\u2019t want to live in this country. Just\ndon\u2019t want to be there, regardless. So I told my sister, you take everything is here --\nby the way, I never took a penny out of that place. Never took a penny, I\u2019ve never\nclaimed anything. I was never paid or made any claims to the Germans, although all\nthe other Jews did. Never wanted to touch it, that was tainted stuff. So this is -- this\nis a very important characteristic of my experience that -- that I did not cling -- I do\nnot cling to things which are basically, in my view, morally evil. When you see\nanything that\u2019s morally evil, wrong, you don\u2019t stick around. And -- and that is really\nthe reason why, starting in 1946, the idea was, I\u2019m not going to stick around, I\u2019m\njust going to go wherever I can. Of course, the idea was to go to America, where\nthere was unlimited opportunity and nobody knew me.",
        "Q: Now, was it that clear cut in the beginning? I mean, th -- all -- did you rationally\nthink through the pros and cons of leaving everything and going with nothing to\nAmerica?",
        "A: Well, the big moment, the big moment in my life, you know, in -- in other\nwords, in -- when you look at life, there are only few things which are so called, a\nfulcrum. And this is when you roll your dice, and if you don\u2019t roll the dice right,\nyou die. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- or -- or perish, or whatever. When the -\n- when the uprising took place and -- and the Germans started persecuting Jews and\npartisans and arresting people, we went to predetermined houses where we wo --\nyou know, hide and we -- the Christians are going to keep us hidden and we were\ngoing to crawl into the attic, or crawl into a closet or -- or whatever. And, you\nknow, these experiences, everybody has a different experience about what they did.\nI went to the house, which you may or may not recall from my interview, to the\nhouse of an employee who was a very trusted interview -- employee of -- of my\nfather\u2019s. A long employee who owed very much to my father. His wife was very\nunhappy, his wi -- by the way, the marriage was a bad marriage to begin with. And\nshe was grousing about, y-you -- you know, the Germans coming, finding me there\nand shooting the whole family because they to -- that is what the Germans were\nadvertising, anybody hiding a Jew is going to be executed. So I -- I was told to just\ngo out to the -- near the river, and sit there during the day, when presumably the\nGermans were going to do house to house searches and then come back at night and\nthey\u2019re going to feed me. And the big decision, this is one of these fulcrum\ndecisions which sort of imprinted me on my whole model, walking away. When I\nsat at the river, I said, I\u2019m not going to go back. I\u2019m rather going to go take my\nchances where the shooting was than go back to what is presumably a safe house.\nSame thing happened in \u00b048 -- or \u201946, you know, I could have stayed there, but this\nidea of walking was by that time very heavily imprinted in me. Also, th-that my\nbehavior in -- in the partisans was very much -- a-as you know, during the partisan\nwarfare, there\u2019s always a little cottage where you can go to and some peasants will\nhide you or keep you for the night, so instead you being outside in the frost, you\u2019re\ngoing to come into the village and stay there and get fed. Well, lots of partisans lost\ntheir life that way. I just didn\u2019t do that. There was always a bunch of guys who say,\nwell, it\u2019s just too dangerous. So this idea of not necessarily staying comfortable, but\ndoing the contrary thing is something which is not just Paul Strassmann, this 1s\nsomething, when you look at history of Jews -- I\u2019m just finished reading for the\nsecond time Paul Johnson\u2019s history of th -- of Jews. You know, when you say, well\nhow did the Jews survive for, you know, whatever thousand years it was, you know,\nhow did they move from -- from Sumer to Egypt to Canaan to Assyria to Babylon\nand back and forth. And then went to Persia, then went to -- to -- to -- to Damascus\nand to Anatolia. Th-The -- the wandering Jew. Well, the survival of the Jews was\none that they always were ready to move. They would have stayed put, they would\nhave died and perished like everybody else who stayed put. So this is not just a Paul\nStrassmann kind of an imprint, it\u2019s just deeply -- now whether it\u2019s genetic, I doubt,\nbut it is, what do you call it, r-racial, or religious or psychological orientation. It\u2019s\nsomething that -- that very much has been a pattern of everything I\u2019ve done and\nhow I\u2019ve progressed in the United States.",
        "Q: It could be, I suppose, this real survival instinct. I had -- on the one hand, you\ncould say that you\u2019re -- certainly with the partisans you\u2019re -- you seemed to have\nnine lives. You were young, you were taking risks, but it\u2019s an interesting to -- way\nto -- to look at it, that it was in your blood, that it\u2019s part of the -- part of your\nheritage. And there does seem to be moral overtones, that rather than hiding, you\nwere taking an active role that might make things better.",
        "A: Yeah, in fact my son that I lost was very much interested in the subject, and --\nand he was a brilliant, brilliant scholar at Harvard. And he always wanted to know,\nyou know, what -- what makes it tick? You know? Give me an equation, you know,\ngive -- give me something quantitative. Because you know, I always do things\nquantitatively. And I said, well, a-as you know, in -- in games theory and in\nmathematics, and in gaming, there are things called algorithms, okay? And so he\nwanted to know, what\u2019s the algorithm. And anythi -- in conversation with my son,\nthen I said, you know, the -- the -- the algorithm in life is that you always want to\nmigrate to where your number of options that you have, increase. So the algorithm\nis that if you are somewhere 1n what\u2019s called a mathematical sack, cul-de-sac,\nyou\u2019re down to one option. And so in gaming theory -- this is called option theory,\nby the way, and by the way Van Neumann did a formal analysis of this\n[indecipherable] so -- so there\u2019s a mathematical basis for it. In gaming theory you\nhave to look always for space, for more options, even if 1t costs you more, because\nonce you have more options, even if the price is higher, the probability of you\npossibly doing better is greater than if you are what\u2019s called, in a zero sum game.\nCul-de-sac, it\u2019s called -- in -- in mathematics, by the way, this is called a knapsack.\nI mean, there is formal theory over this thing. And my -- my second son Steven,\nwho has a Ph.D. from M.I.T., he -- he -- he\u2019s a -- he\u2019s acclass one nerd, you know,\nmathematics, everything has to be quantitative. You know, one day I just on a\nnapkin, drew for him this whole theory of life, that life is really of maximizing your\noptions. That\u2019s what life is. In fact, when you look at the --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: According to this theory of option, 1t means that if you stay hidden in a house of\nan employee whose wife is sort of a hostile party to this whole deal, you are\nbasically cooped up and there\u2019s no options. I mean, you are just totally wedged in,\nand you have no place to go. When you are just in shorts, and with a t-shirt and\nsandals, and one sandwich, in the reeds of the river Vah, and going back two miles\nis that house, or going forward, actually swimming down the river and then going to\nthe mountains where shooting takes place, that\u2019s more options. So you go.",
        "Q: Yes. Now you spoke very critically of that wife and that being a bad marriage\nand -- in your earlier interview.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: What -- did you know, in your community, much about that woman? I assume\nshe could not be trusted, and you were at risk in the household.",
        "A: Well, about that wife I knew very little, except that the a -- other employees were\n-- were always joshing this man, who was my father\u2019s confidant, about this wife\nthat he picked up. And I picked up enough sort of, innuendo, to -- that my -- my --\nmy radar said, well there\u2019s something f-funny in here. Y- You must understand, in\nthe back of my father\u2019s store were, you know, were the merchandise and were the --\nwe loaded cars. There was lots of rough play and -- and -- and -- among the\nemployees and of course I always mixed around and listened. And I picked up that\nthis was one unhappy, henpecked husband. So -- so, you know, but yo-you just\nfactor that in -- into the equation. The fact that they didn\u2019t want me to stay inside\nthe house, and you know, this was only the second day. I was there only one night.\nOn the second day, get out, you know, was enough of a signal that I would have no\noptions at all because when the Germans really started looking for people and doing\nhouse to house searches, I would have no place to go.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back for a moment, because we\u2019ve jumped from your early childhood --",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: -- to this period when you w-were in hiding. And tell me a -- the context of what\nhad taken place by then, and what had happened to your father.",
        "A: Well, the tragedy was -- is that the -- my father greatly mistimed the whole issue\nof how we will survive. Ye -- we received, in 1942 at the end -- towards the end of\nthe deportation, a presidential exception, which also covered the grandparents.\nGrandfather Weiner was sent to concentration camp, but it was the Slovak\nconcentration camp. The Slovaks kept some of the carpenters, and some of the\nJewish craftsman to make furniture and artifacts for the Slovak new powers. So they\nkept a camp where the Jews were slave laborers, but they did -- were not shipped to\n-- to -- to annihilation camps. So Grandfather Alexander was in a place called\nNovaky. We were in Trencin. My father, because of his prior connection with a\nvery distinguished Catholic priest, by name of Bernetsky, really an outstanding\nfriend of my father, secured a presidential protection, so that we were not deported\nin 1942. But we always knew that the day of reckoning will come when the front\nmoves in from the east, and the Germans retreat. At that time, there will be\nwholesale destruction and annihilation and murder and who knows what happens.\nAnd so, starting in \u201943, we started rehearsing where do we go, where do we hide\nwhen the front moves. My father had set up a hiding place, and then a fall-back\nhiding place and a third place. In other words, there were like three places to go to.\nWhen the -- the beginning of the uprising, but it was not so full born yet, but when\nthe guerilla attacks started -- it was precipitated, by the way, by the -- by the\ncommunists, for reasons which -- that\u2019s another story. We decided to go to back-up\nplace number one, which was in a town called Selec, which is not too far from --\nfrom Trencin, in the mountains. Was a small peasant village, there was peasant who\nwas for money and my father already provided food and what have you, we\u2019re\ngoing to go there. Well, when my father decided to -- to go to Selec, well then, there\nwere other people who my father was obligated to. My father inherited from his\npartner, who I may or may not have mentioned, by name of Kubicek. Kubicek went\nto the Zionist congress in Basel in 1938 and never came back. My father took over\ncustody of his wife and his son. So -- and there were two aunts, so my father took a\ntruck from the business, loaded everybody and in we go into Selec to hide. Of\ncourse, the whole village saw that here comes a whole bunch of Jews, you know. It\nwas just not well thought out. So we were there for two days, which was, I think\nAugust 27 and 28 and my father recognized this was really -- 1t was just too noisy,\nthere were just too many people. And everybody was in the same place. So the\ndecision was to go back to Trencin and regroup and start going into places where\neverybody will go in onesies or twosies --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- to hiding places. Well, that night Gestapo came and took my father as a\nhostage, and my grandfather Weiner. And just happens that that night I was not\nsleeping at home. Of course, we were, by that time, living in very, very low, low --\nlow kinds of housing, you know, housing that was very, very low grade. You know,\nit was out in the boonies. I think we had only one bedroom and one living room, so\nit was crowded anyway, so I stayed with a friend. So in the morning I was told the\nfamily was taken, my father was taken, and therefore I should go now to\ncontingency place number three, which was the -- this employee, so -- so within\nthree days, we went from contingency one to contingency two, to cont-contingency\nthree like this. And these -- so you were at the end of the rope by that time. And it\nwas still now only September one or September two, 1944. So you were out of an --\na-- arope, you\u2019re at the end of the rope now, already, and the -- you know, the\nshow only started, I mean the -- the bad times only started now. So that th -- was the\ncontext under which I said, this is a bad option. I mean, I have no place to go.",
        "Q: And how old were you then?",
        "A: 15. Iwas 15. I was a sturdy 15. Really experienced hiker. Because I couldn\u2019t go\nto school at the age of 11, my father apprenticed me to my grandfather. When my\ngrandfather was shipped to the labor camp, I was then apprenticed to work in a\nmachine shop, which was a wonderful experience. And in the machine shop we\nwere fixing threshing machines. And 1 -- the -- in -- in those days they didn\u2019t have\nball bearings, so they had bushings made out of copper, and when they didn\u2019t oil it\nproperly the copper melted, so you had to re -- ream the bushings, and I learned\npouring, holding the mold when people were pouring metal to make a bushing and\nthen reaming it out and fitting axels into it. I -- the people in the machine shop were\na bunch of real tough guys, including one guy who was wounded in the Spanish\nCivil War, in a communist brigade. Was a rough guy, and who subsequently\nbecame the commissar of one of the battalions and was guilty of enormous\natrocities. And after the war he became the deputy chairman of the communist\nparty. And he was one of the guys why I decided, with that guy around, I -- I don\u2019t\nwant to live in this town.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: That -- it was one -- one dangerous guy.",
        "Q: Yeah. Do you think your father, just as he took you on hikes --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- was also, in your apprenticeship in the threshing shop --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- deliberately toughening you up?",
        "A: Oh yes. Oh my -- my father always -- of course my fa -- because of his\nbackground, believed in tough. You know, physical, mental tough stuff. And of\ncourse, Hashomer Hatzair particularly emphasized that.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And of course the town I come from used to be a garrison all the way going back\nto Roman times. Trencin was the last mountains -- mountain pass from the\nCarpathian mountains into the D-Danube [indecipherable] and the Romans were --\nhad their advance camp in there and on the castle, I will show the picture if you\u2019re\ninterested in. It was a huge, medieval castle. And we used to, you know, at -- at -- at\nseven years old our favorite game was to go into the castle and play cops and\nrobbers and Crusaders and particularly figuring out how to defeat the Turks,\nbecause the Turks used to come to Trencin and devastate the population, so -- so,\nyou know, th-that environment was already that kind of a mental process. This was\nnot a mamby-pamby kind of a protected environment.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And of course, starting in \u201937 - 38, we were badly beaten up by the hooligans,\nas Jews, you know, so we had to go in packs on the street.",
        "Q: But at the same time your father was also, with optimism, making sure you\ncontinued your studies, your piano lessons and your tutoring.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh -- well, meanwhile, my father, of course, paid for piano lessons,\nwhich we couldn\u2019t afford, and for English, you know, I -- starting in \u201938. But we\nalways knew -- you know, my father\u2019s ideal life -- I mean, he alway -- was to move\nout of Slovakia -- Czechoslovakia, move to England, put his son into an English\nschool, and live in a setting like I live in right now. A garden and privacy and\nquietness. And th-that was his idea. My father\u2019s idea of life was to live like an\nEnglish gentleman, reading books and -- and -- and writing, and -- and -- and -- and\n-- and not -- not having to deal with this tremendous pressure, this enormous social\npressure which existed in that place.",
        "Q: And of course you -- I-I was just thinking of the fact that your survival in that\none instant, clearly rested on your father sending you away that night, to stay with\nthis former employee. I -- I mean that y-you were the only son, he seems in so many\nways to have --",
        "A: No, no, no, that night when my father was taken by the Gestapo, I was with a\nfriend who was not an employee, he was just a chi --",
        "Q: Oh, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: -- was a childhood friend, and we -- we were quite friendly with him. He was\nhalf Jewish. And th-the reason I stayed there was that, you know, it was just I s -- I\nused to sleep around with friends, you know, we visiting back and forth, and it was\nlate, there was curfew already and they said, well, why don\u2019t you stay there.",
        "Q: Oh, so that was not a --",
        "A: It was not a [indecipherable]",
        "Q: -- a kind of instinctive thing on your father\u2019s part.",
        "A: No, it was not, it was -- it was just stupid luck. I mean, it was just --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- just luck.",
        "Q: Mm. Do you remember what -- what it was like, what you felt emotionally,\nknowing that your father had been taken?",
        "A: Well, in some respect it was a sense of betrayal, because I did not know -- see,\nnobody ever told me what the plan was. I did not have any money. I did not know\nwhat the financial arrangements were. See, part of the problem was that I was a big\nblabber. And my father really didn\u2019t share too many things with me. So -- you see,\nthe assumption was always that dad will take care of everybody. This idea that I, at\nthe age of 15 would be independent, and have to make decisions on my own, I don\u2019t\nthink that was on the agenda. See, the assumption always was, the father of the\nfamily will sort of direct everybody and decide who goes where. And so part of this\nexperience was that here I was with no clothing, just wol -- told, why don\u2019t you go\nto this house. No -- there was no question of money, what the arrangements were,\nnothing. I didn\u2019t know what the deal was. I did not know where it leads, what was\nthe further fall back, nothing. So not knowing anything, I finally decided, well, you\nknow, you either sit here, go back and do what everybody else was doing, or just\nget -- get on with something. And I guess that was the -- the -- the decisive moment,\nbecause had I stayed, I would have been -- sure ended up in a concentration camp.\nThey -- they would have surely found me and shipped me off.",
        "Q: Now the protection that your father had from -- was it Monsignor Be-Bernetsky?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How rare would that be? I know your father was prominent and successful --",
        "A: It was quite rare, it was quite rare. It was quite rare, yeah, it -- 1t -- it was. It was\n-- well, you know, I can give you the numbers, you know the numbers are that --\nthat there were 83,000 Jews in Slovakia, 64,000 were shipped to annihilation camp\nwith nobody coming ever back. Of those who left, which was like 18,000, a\nnumber, maybe 4,000 went into slave labor camps to -- to work for the locals. Then\nwhoever was left [sneezes] -- excuse me -- either got false papers or sort of\ndisappeared, or got legitimacy, and of -- got -- got papers, so-called white papers,\nand [indecipherable] and it -- it was a big deal. It was a big deal.",
        "Q: Would it have involved any assumption of risk or danger for Bernetsky that he\nwas --",
        "A: Protecting.",
        "Q: -- protecting your father?",
        "A: Bernetsky was untouchable. He is considered today a sort of, you know, the\ntown square is named after him, a-a-and he -- he was close with Tiso, who was the\npresident. The president of Slovakia could write an exception, you know, under his\nsignature. For my father and the family to be protected required the signature of the\npresident of Slovakia.",
        "Q: And it seemed that you never had to pass as a non-Jew. Am I right in -- I -- I\nmean, al-always your community knew who you were, and who your family\nmembers were, but from a bureaucratic point of view, you did things so that\naccording to paperwork, your -- you\u2019d be placed in the category that gave you a\nbetter chance for survival.",
        "A: Well, there was a few wrinkles with this thing. We had to get baptized, and the\nquestion was, well what\u2019s the faster ways of getting baptized? Well, to become\nbaptized as a Catholic -- and Bernetsky offered that, was a very complicated thing,\nand you know, the timing was short. My father was very good friends also --\nbecause my father was one of the leading citizens in town, with the senior -- the --\nwhich he\u2019s a sort of a -- like a auxiliary bishop, by name of Zimon, a wonderful\nscholar of the Lutheran church. And so in 1942, after a proper course in catechism\nand so forth -- which I did very well, by the way. Frankly, I liked the catechism\nbetter than I liked the Jewish stuff because I could understand it, you know, it was\nin Slovak and it was sort of interesting, historically. And -- you know, and Jesus\nwas a Jew, so it must have been okay. And also, the beautiful thing about the -- the\nLutherans is th-the organ music. You see, the Jews didn\u2019t have music in the\nsynagogue, only wailing, you know, the -- no music. The -- the Lutheran church had\na wonderful organ and then in the chapel they had a harmonium, which I used to\nlike to play on. But, you know, the -- the -- the s -- the psalms, you know, mostly\nold -- this -- this was Lutheran of the Augsburg persuasion. I don\u2019t know you\nunderstand the -- Lutherans -- Lutherans come in various flavors, you understand\nthat? Okay. There was lots of Old Testament songs, which have been -- which have\nbeen -- which are sung, according to music [indecipherable] by Johann Sebastian\nBach. And they\u2019re beautiful, they\u2019re absolutely beautiful. So I had a great time with\nthe Lutherans. Everybody knew, of course, that I was a baptized Jew. I mean, y-you\nknow, in this little town, everybody could tell that. But 1 -- you know, it was just --\njust wonderful.",
        "Q: Yes. I -- I really just meant that distinction between those who hid their\nJewishness, and y-you were really, as a family, not doing that, but also assuming\nthis membership in the Lutheran church.",
        "A: Yeah, and a -- a -- yeah, we -- we were not hiding anything, there was no way of\nhiding it. I mean, everybody knew who s -- Adolf Strassman, my father was and\nwho I am, but -- but 1-it was a convenient way, and the Lutherans who were a\nminority in the town sort of felt that they were -- and the Lutherans never went in\nwith this Nazi stuff anyway. I mean, in the ar -- in the underground, much of the\npro-western connection -- 1 -- yi -- as you know there was a London underground\nand there was a Soviet underground. The -- the Soviet underground was a bunch of\natheists and -- and -- and quasi-criminal element. The intellectual underground in\nLondon was mostly Lutheran. And I turned out to be quite a scholar in -- in\nLutheran affairs, and of course I went, you know, the catechism, answered all the\nquestions and -- and -- and -- you know, I -- I did just fine. I enjoyed it. So -- so yi -\n- y -- sort of everybody went along with this thing. It was a very interesting period.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I have only warmest memories on -- on that period. I mean, in -- in the period of\nthe war, which is 1942 to 1944, it provided a period of relative stability.",
        "Q: Does your story of what happened in this case shed light on Madeline Albright\u2019s\nfamily history, and the fact that, I think, she di -- she was not aware of her Jewish\nheritage --",
        "A: Oh, balderdash --",
        "Q: -- until a late si --",
        "A: -- balderdash. I don\u2019t believe that, but -- but 1f she was or she wasn\u2019t, a -- I mean,\nthere -- there was no point of hiding it, if -- I mean, these are small circumstances,\nsmall town. Now she u -- if she came from a big town like Prague, and I don\u2019t know\nof the detail, it\u2019s possible that the thing was sort of expunged, but in a small town\nthere was no way of forgetting who was a Jew, and who wasn\u2019t a Jew.",
        "Q: I just thought that -- that th -- the practices and the things done to help s -- Jews\nsurvive in Czechoslovakia might differ from what was happening in other countries,\nand that therefore --",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: -- her case -- that it shed some light on her story.",
        "A: Yeah, I -- I -- I -- I --I -- I\u2019m sure of that and you know, that the conditions were\ndifferent in Bulgaria. For instance, I -- I happened to be presiding last year at the\nBulgarian memorial, and it was very interesting for me, th-that was a totally\ndifferent approach of solving the situation. The -- the -- you know, ge-getting a\npresidential except -- exception, the white paper, and by saying, well yeah, but that\nyou also converted to Christianity, you know, that was another check mark and that\nwas Okay. At least in \u201942 it was -- you know, in September of 1944, all the bets\nwere off, I mean, none of that applied.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. But what was happening in your family\u2019s story, where your father\npreviously seems to have been masterfully studying strategies --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- is most interesting. I mean, yo-you suggest that with some forward thinking\nand astuteness, you could work the system, to some extent.",
        "A: That is correct, you could work the system as long as options were available.\nOnce the Germans took over, there were no options. I mean, they eliminated all\noptions, I mean, there was -- y-ye -- if you were a Jew, baptized or otherwise, you\nknow, your -- you were either shot or shipped to -- to concentration camps.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Now you were 10 when the Germans occupied Czechoslovakia?",
        "A: No, th-the Germans did not occupy Czechoslovakia. The Germans occupied only\nthe Czech Republic and they created what\u2019s called the Protectorat. They did not\noccupy Slovakia. They made a deal with Monsignor Tiso to create a Slovak state,\nbecause they just had their hands full, and th-they wanted to draw on the military\ncapability of Slovakia, which was quite considerable. Slovakia ultimately put up\n92,000 soldiers working for the Germans, fighting with the Germans against the\nSoviets. So the Slovak, two divisions went into Russia, advancing all the way to the\nCaucasian mountains.",
        "Q: But it was -- it was that -- well, really my question is, your life would change\ndramatically when you were 10, am I right?",
        "A: Yes, yeah, life changed dramatically because the Aryan laws were put into effect\nby the Slovak legislature, following the script, the German script, and that means\nJews were stripped, in a very methodical way of all property, all privileges. And it\nwas a bureaucratically highly organized process of taking property away. The -- it\nwas very important that the various people who owed their loyalty to the Nazis and\nto the Slovak, were getting as much property as possible. So it started as a way of\nstripping the Jews of property, shipping most of the Jews, like 85 percent of the\nJews into annihilation camps, and then whoever was left, depriving them of all the\ncivil rights and -- and property and radios and fur coats and -- and automobiles, and\n-- and -- you know, th-there was a long list, I still have those lists of what you can\nor cannot do, and what street you can be on, what is your curfew, whether you can\nhave a window looking at the street, or not looking at the street. I mean it was a\nvery elaborate, bureaucratic structure that got erected to do this. And, you know, as\ntime went on, you know, things got closed down. The synagogue got closed down,\nthe Jewish school got closed down. Going to a movie got closed down and so forth\nand so forth. And it -- it was -- there was -- it was always a next step.",
        "Q: And when you were living in poor quarters --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- in what you describe as a shack, but it -- 1t would be a couple of room, that\nwould have happened within the space of a couple of years?",
        "A: Oh yes. First we had a beautiful house that my father built in 1933, which was\non top of the store on the main, commercial streets. So, immediately we could not\nlive in the rooms which were facing the street. That was -- immediately we were\npushed down into the two rooms which were behind, not looking over the street. So\nthat went on for about eight month or so. Then came an ordinance that you cannot\nlive on that street altogether. So then we moved to another apartment, a one\nbedroom apartment. It was a very small living room, an upstairs walk-up, not too\nfar from our original house. And we were there for maybe a year. Then an\nordinance was passed that you cannot be even there, because it was ho -- it had hot\nand cold water. Jews cannot be in any apartment where there is both hot water and\ncold water. So we had to find a place which was really, you know, a slum, beca --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection. This\nis an interview with Paul Strassmann, conducted by Margaret West, on January the\n8, 2004, in New Canaan, Connecticut. This interview is part of the United States\nHolocaust Memorial Museum\u2019s post-Holocaust interview project, and is a follow up\nJuly the 11\", 1990. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully\nacknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible. This is tape\nnumber two, side A. Did you ever go back and look at your old home?",
        "A: We -- I surely did. I -- my father\u2019s house on the main street, when I finished my\nofficer course in 1945, in a military uniform and with a Tommy gun, I just walked\nin at two o\u2019clock in the morning, banged at the door. And of course it was occupied\nby the people who took over my father\u2019s business. They were absolutely petrified,\nyou know, it was immediately after the war, and I was basically a political officer.\nYou -- you must understand that when I got out of the partisans, I was considered to\nbe an exceptionally reliable person to be used for whatever purpose, such as eth --\nethnic cleansing, you know, I was ready to do anything. And so I went back as soon\nas I could to find out if anybody was alive and of course they were petrified, they\nimmediately moved out of the front -- front rooms of the house, to the back, where\nwe used to live. And I stayed there one night. I wa-wanted no part of it, I found out\nnobody knew about anything about my family. All they knew that my mother was\nfound shortly after she went into hiding and that nobody knew where my sister was,\nand everybody knew that my father was shipped to concentration camp right away.\nSo -- so that was in \u201945, I immediately went there. Since then a v -- you know,\nunder the communists, I couldn\u2019t go back. The -- it was shut down in 1948, when\nthe communists took over. First time I went back to Trencin was in -- maybe in\n1978 or \u201979. By that time the house was razed and a huge monster complex was\nbuilt up as -- for Soviet kind of apartments. But I go there now at least once a year,\nsometimes twice a year. I just finished a very major project in Trencin, which may\nbe of interest to you. When I went there in 1986, I went finally to the synagogue,\nwhich of course was converted into some kind of a music hall, but next to the\nsynagogue was a small chapel, and everything was piled in, what that was left from\nthe synagogue into the chapel. It was a warehou -- 1-it was a ma -- badly messed up\ncloset, that\u2019s all 1t was, the benches were stacked up. And on the wall were the\nnames of the Jews that perished. 1536 names. And they were just printed on pieces\nof paper that was curling and getting mildew. And there on the spot I decided that\nthat is not going to be. And after four years of work, and getting people from all\nover the world to cooperate, last year we unveiled 24 bronze tablets with the names.\nI paid for it, just about all of it. And it is now a sanctuary. So I\u2019ve been back -- I\nmean, this idea of getting that memorial up into the -- into that chapel was very time\nconsuming. I must have made like 10 trips negotiating with various people. See, the\nJews didn\u2019t want to have any part of it. They didn't want to stir trouble. So -- but\nfinally I -- y-you know, it got very complicated. Nobody wanted any part of it, you\nknow, why do you want to stir things up? Well, I stir things up.",
        "Q: Would there be repercussions fo -- th-that the Jews would suffer f-f --",
        "A: The few Jews, and I think there are eight or nine, that\u2019s all there is, and they\u2019re\nall in their 80\u2019s like my sister, want to be left alone, peaceful. They don\u2019t want to be\nbothered. They don\u2019t want to be called Jew, or anything. So their idea is to lay low,\nand if there\u2019s one thing this guy doesn\u2019t do, it\u2019s lay low, you know? So -- but\nultimately, people came from Israel, and from Germany and Switzerland and\nEngland for the unveiling. I think they were more interested in talking to one\nanother who survived, because they grew up all together. These are the survivors.\nThey\u2019re looking at the memorial, but that\u2019s okay, that memorial is go -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s --\nit\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s wedged into the wall with deep rivets. Th -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s heavy metal,\nlike this. So it\u2019s fairly indestructible, I mean, you would -- really would have to\nblow it up. And I just feel good about it, and to hell with everybody else.",
        "Q: And there had been Jews a -- I understand in Trencin since -- I as -- somewhere I\nsaw that first records were of 1760, perhaps before that.",
        "A: Oh, Jews have been in Trencin, you know, I mean for -- the records go back to\nabout the 11\" century, because you see, Trencin was always a military town, it was\na base. It was always a government town, it was a trading town. And so Jewish\ntraders came and gone. That\u2019s why you have those large co -- concentration of Jews\nin Trencin. Because the Jews were basically the lawyers and the record keepers and\nthe -- the -- the Hungarian and Austro-Hungarian nobility used Jews as their record\nkeepers, as their bookkeepers. See, the [indecipherable] never wanted to be tainted\nby anything commercial. So they -- and they actually, as you know the history, they\ninvited the Jews to come in to help them to manage Poland and -- and many of\nthose countries, because the Jews were totally dependent on the nobility. And so\nthere was a very large Jewish population and the Jews were being used as a money\ngatherer because the Jews really were, until about 1860 could not own land. So the\nJews were used as instrument of feudal oppression and tax collection, which of\ncourse was one of the sources of anti-Semitism, which was deeply endemic in that\npart, particularly among the peasantry.",
        "Q: Now, you talk in your earlier interview about anti-Semitism being essentially an\nurban phenomenon.",
        "A: Yes, well because the Jews were urban.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. The jur -- the Jews were, of course, here and there, sitting in the -- in\nthe properties, where they were maintaining property, and they were innkeepers.\nBut that was p -- all part of the taxation mechanism that the feudal regime\nmaintained. See, the feudal lords, they don\u2019t want to mess around with that.",
        "Q: Now, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m going back again, but from whom would you have learned\nabout what happened to your father, and when would you know that he\u2019d been\ntaken to Sachsenhausen and tortured?",
        "A: I knew it from secondhand, of his torturing, because when I got back into\nTrencin as a political officer, I was hell bent to even some scores. And we were\ninterrogating a number of people, and I j-just found out what happened, because\neverybody was saying, well it wasn\u2019t me. It turned out that the Slovaks, jointly with\nthe local Germans went -- and they had a list of hostages that they wanted to pick\nup, people who were suspect as working with the partisans, you see, because my\nfather managed the food business, even under the Slovak regime. My father made\nsure that some food got moved into the villages. So my father was on the list for a\ncollaborator.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So that you -- you learned that later on. Now, y -- t-to what extent did you settle\nscores? I think you make some reference to ugly times, or whatever, initially after --",
        "A: I -- well -- le-let me -- le-let me say, looking back at it, I really didn\u2019t settle any\nscores. I really did not kill anybody. There were some people that I testified against,\nbecause of some of the acts that they committed, but they were let go anyway, so --\nso there was no scores to settle.",
        "Q: Again I want to go back to ask you about th-the fact that your family did not\nleave in 1938, when th-they had made preparations to escape. And you tell the story\nin your earlier interview about your mother as treasurer --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- hiding money and then it got damaged by a steam radiator.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: But it -- it seemed to me that your father\u2019s family responsibilities weighed\nheavily on him.",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: And did he ever speak about -- with regret about not going, or -- ju -- I\u2019d just like\nto know more about that.",
        "A: Yeah. Th -- as I noted before, during the bad years, which is \u201939 through \u201944, the\nparents really didn\u2019t speak much. They -- they -- they felt that -- that -- that I was a\npotential source of -- of leaks. Of course, my sister subsequently told me that she\nalso did not know what was going on. I think it was just the way my father and my\nmother operated is they -- they wanted to keep everything very tight. Also, in those\ndays you did not speak to your children as peers. It was a different social structure.\nChildren were there to be told what to do, to be educated, to be trained. And -- and -\n- and you had obligations, it was almost a feudal kind of a relationship. It\u2019s not the\nAmerican way, you know, where -- you know, the conversation between the father\nand the mother and the children is fairly free, at least in my family. So we -- we just\ndidn\u2019t know. We didn't know their thoughts.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. But have you put yourself in your father\u2019s shoes, and it does seem to\nme that the reason he chose not to leave with his immediate family was because of\nthat responsibility to the extended family --",
        "A: Oh yes. Well, yes, clearly, the responsible for the extended family and\nparticularly to his parents, he was very devoted to his father. He went and visited\nhis father every night. And th -- he could not get his father out. I mean, we had\npassports. You must understand. In 1938, my father, my mother, my sister and I had\npass -- valid passports. We could have walked out any time.",
        "Q: Did your parents ever regret this, do you think? Or was it an unspoken regret, if\nthat was there.",
        "A: It was unspoken, it was never discussed. They never discussed, you know, what\ncould have happened, or what didn\u2019t happen. That was never discussed, not to my\nbest knowledge, and neither to my sister\u2019s knowledge, who was older and she says\nshe didn\u2019t know. She just didn\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Mm. And I assume that this would be what would happen in so many families\nwhere it would be possible for some members to leave, but it\u2019s very hard to leave\nclose relatives behind.",
        "A: Well, yes. I -- I would say that -- that the fir-fir-first -- everybody always said\nthat nobody expected it to be so bad. There was this old pattern, well somehow\nwe\u2019re going to mu -- muddle through. You know, this also will come to pass. I\ndon\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen the movie, \u201cThe Pianist\u201d. You remember the early scene\n-- by the way, I only saw the first eight minutes of the thing, and then I wa -- got\nsick. There they are, ready to move out and leave Warsaw, and they hear on the\nradio, Churchill announces that England and France is going ag-against -- in war\nagainst the Germans and they all have a big party because all their problems are\nsolved. You remember that scene? Well, that scene was repeated again and again\nand again. This is denial. The -- the -- much of the existence in those days was\ndenial. People were denial -- were in denial all the way to the entrance of the gas\nchambers, and even then they were in denial.",
        "Q: Why do you think that was so? Is that human nature?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know about what is human nature, but -- but a-a-as you know,\nwhen you have no option -- this goes back to my options theory, okay, if you have\nno option, if you are -- if you have only one option, and that\u2019s all you have, the only\nthing you can do about it, if it\u2019s a horrible option, is to deny it. You don\u2019t want to\nface up to it.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: See, the moment you have options, you cannot do denial because you then have\nto confront -- you know, of the three or four things that I can do, which one will I\ndo? Then you have to go into so -- irrational process. So if you are pretty well set in\na given groove, denial will be the most natural way to try to deal with it, other than\ncommitting suicide.",
        "Q: And it helps to protect your children, and your spouse, and --",
        "A: Yes, yes, yeah.",
        "Q: -- and so on. Tell me what happened to your mother and your sister after your\nfather was taken.",
        "A: Well, Mother went into a place for hiding, you know, she -- she already knew\nthis was fallback number three, she went there. My sister didn\u2019t like fallback\nnumber three, but she had false papers, so she went and took a train and went to\nBratislava, where she worked as a servant. My mother was betrayed in 30 days.\nSomebody said, well there is a Jewess in this house. Most likely, of course, 1t was\ngiven that she was betrayed by the people who were keeping her. My sister was\npicked up on the street, somebody recognized her. And my mother was shipped to\nRavensbrick and so was my sister. My sister barely made it, I mean she was this\nclose. She -- she then did the forced march. M-My mother died of typhoid. My\nsister was very sick and she was on this forced march and they were shooting\nanybody who was a straggler, and she just fell down and two of her friends picked\nher up and walked her. That\u2019s how she survived.",
        "Q: Has she ever been interviewed by the --",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: -- Holocaust -- oh.",
        "A: Yeah, I have a ca -- I have a copy of her ta-tape. It is a very guarded description.\nShe -- she censors her feelings very much. I mean, she -- she just feels that -- that\nshe was left really helpless. And very much alone. And really did not know what to\ndo.",
        "Q: That sounds much like your feelings, initially.",
        "A: Initially. But she had no -- no -- she had no place to go. She just went to another\ntown. And once you were in another town and you were moving up 1n an open,\nsooner or later they\u2019re going to get you.",
        "Q: I wonder if you feel, or you have any memory of when you were on your own,\nwhether you have any sense that you clung to f-fond memories of childhood, and\ndid they wa -- ho -- wa -- did that give you strength to keep going? As an observer it\nwould seem to me that -- that start that you had 1n life, of security and a -- and an\nextended family, a really stable, good background would give you reserves, sort of\ninner reserves that might help you to keep going, but do you -- do you consciously\nhave any thoughts? Do you remember having memories of family times?",
        "A: Le-Let me sa -- tell you very, very clearly on this one. None. The -- the -- the\nconditions were so brutal and so difficult, that just coping with the here and now,\nand what do next totally occupied me. There was no -- looking back would be --\nhave been a weakness. So if you\u2019re totally occupied with trying to make the next\nstep, the -- you know, the next sortie, the next raid, the next piece of clothing that\nyou need because winter is coming. The -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the struggle for\nsurvival in -- on a very brutal military conditions was so extreme that looking back\nwas really not very useful. And -- and I usually don\u2019t look back. It was interesting,\nabout two days ago I had a conversation with my daughter. She had a contract that\nexpired early in 2003, and the people paid her for awhile, and then she protested\nand so they finally gave her a new contract. And th -- it\u2019s a nice contract, it\u2019s a three\nyear contract. The question was, they didn\u2019t pay her for about four month and there\nwas a back pay issue. And her husband screamed at her that she should not sign a\ncontract because th-they owe her back pay. I say, forget about it. Forget about back\npay, you know. It\u2019s gone, you know\u201d? Look forward, they\u2019re giving you a good deal\nfor the next three years. Take it and run.",
        "Q: Move on.",
        "A: Move on. So this idea of move on and the -- the -- the -- that is the only thing\nthat -- that -- that is important. Except when it comes something very close, like the\ndeath of my son. That you -- that\u2019s something that -- that sort of looms because that\nis a d-deep wound. But, you know, whether you had a nice house, and nice clothing\nand nice this and tha -- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- doesn\u2019t matter. That\u2019s the -- that\u2019s easy.\nThat\u2019s -- you can walk away from there. For instance, during the Cuban crisis, I\npicked up my children and moved them out to upstate New York. You know, we\nhad a nice house in Mount Vernon, so what? I mean, I mean, this means nothing.",
        "Q: Trappings.",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s all trappings.",
        "Q: Yes. Well, you moved on. I-In -- was it 1948 when you came to the United\nStates?",
        "A: Yes, yes, October in 1948.",
        "Q: Yeah. And you\u2019d been, of course, a remarkably young, noncommissioned\nofficer, looking like a young boy in uniform, it seems to me.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: You were a young boy.",
        "A: Oh, sure.",
        "Q: But you -- tell me about your -- your plans to come -- I think your goal was,\nfrom early on, to come to the United States.",
        "A: Yeah, and get an education. I mean, the important thing in life is to get an\neducation, get a wife, and have a house, and live as closely as your father talked\nabout, namely live somewhere with a garden, and -- and have children and -- and --\nand have peace and quiet. You know. It\u2019s that simple.",
        "Q: And your -- w -- t-tell me about your -- th-the -- the logistics of how you came to\nthe United States.",
        "A: Okay, the logis -- the logistics was that I knew the communists would be taking\nover, because they actually came over and said, you know, Strassman, you\u2019re a\nhero, but you are the son of a capitalist. Would you do us a favor and just go? So, a\nvery close, wonderful friend of my father, who was if so -- so -- who was a brother-\nin-law of the man who went to Basel -- you know, my father took care of a mother\nand a child.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: So they went to America right away because he was an American citizen, so he\ncould get his wife and his son to America right away. I, of course, was not a\nrelative, but he issued an affidavit for me and put me on the immigration waiting\nlist. My immigration visa hadn\u2019t come through in \u00b047, or even 48, but the brother-\nin-law of this man who was in America, a very wonderful guy, said, look\nStrassmann, you better get out. You better get out while the getting is good. So he\nfound a school in England which was teaching electronics, who signed me up for a\ncourse. And with that course and the fact that I\u2019d all kinds of certificates and what\nhave you, plus the fact that I paid 50,000 dollars for a passport, I was able to leave\nSlovakia with a -- one suitcase and no money, on February the seventh, of 1948.\nThe communists took over on February the 15\", and shut the place down.",
        "Q: Just in time.",
        "A: I went -- and I went to -- to Paris where this man, his name is Freddie Kobler,\ncame from London to Paris to pick me up, he was waiting for me at the North\nStation as I came from the train, and he looked at me and said, boy do you look\nbedraggled, I -- ya -- you know, you -- you -- I -- I have to take you out into a real\nrestaurant. And so he took me out to a three star restaurant and served me a steak. I\ngot promptly sick. He couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t si -- you know. I cried when he -- when\nthe steak came on my plate, I said, oh this is a ration for a whole family for a month,\nI cannot eat that. And then in the evening he took me to Folies Berg\u00e9re where I saw\nfor the first time a naked woman, which you know, in -- in those days, you know,\nma -- ma -- that was very puritanical. And then I came to England and I went to\nschool in England, getting my English fixed up, and I was in England from\nFebruary 1948 until early in October 1948 when a Liberty ship w-was returning\nempty from Plymouth to New York. And I got, for 83.50, a fare on an empty -- in\nthe hold of a Liberty ship. I just want you to know, the real Americans all came\nfrom Plymouth, you know.",
        "Q: Yes. Now, are the --",
        "A: And so I arrived in -- in -- in Brooklyn. M-My father\u2019s friend picked me up at\nthe dock in Brooklyn and brought me to a house in Forest Hills, and I decided that I\nhave to start my career in America, so I found a job in -- in Thanksgiving -- for\nThanksgiving at -- in the Gertz Department store in Jamaica, New York, selling\nsocks. And I sold the socks from Thanksgiving right through Christmas.",
        "Q: Let me go back. The passport that you left with --",
        "A: Wasn\u2019t --",
        "Q: -- when had the money been paid for that? When did you obtain that? Was it the\npassport you had earlier, or is 1t a new one?",
        "A: No. I had only one -- one Czechoslovak passport, which I obtained in January,\nlate in January of 1948, and I obtained it by paying a lawyer, basically 50,000\ndollars, who then went around -- you couldn\u2019t get the passport any other way except\npaying a lawyer who then went and paid off the various bureaucrats and got a\npassport. The passport was not valid to go to America, was just to go to England to\nschool.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: And that would be th -- the money was going to someone, it was essentially a\nbribe?",
        "A: Oh yes, of course.",
        "Q: And how would you access the funds? I mean, presumably this was --",
        "A: Well, I was still in Slovakia.",
        "Q: Yes, and --",
        "A: And -- and, you know, my sister had money from the store. I mean --",
        "Q: Well --",
        "A: -- my sister took over the store I mean wa -- she got back the property. Sh-She\nmarried her sweetheart, who was sick. But she was in the store, and there was\nmoney. And I said, well give me 50,000 then.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: This was in kraus, this was not in dollars.",
        "Q: Now your sister could have left, but she was --",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: -- dedicated to her sick husband?",
        "A: Well that, and the property. There was lots of property and she, you know,\nclaimed the property and asked for the restitution of the property and there was a\nbig store, there were fields, there were -- all the uncles were killed, so they had\nproperty. So I said, take the whole thing.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Now -- I\u2019m jumping back to the Liberty ship.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How long would it take you to travel across the Atlantic, and --",
        "A: 13 days. Liberty ship from Plymouth to Brooklyn was 13 days. It\u2019s the same\nthing that it took prior years -- I mean, those Liberty ships were leaking. I mean,\nthey were riding high, th-they -- you know, they were coming back empty.",
        "Q: Tell me -- explain the -- explain what a Liberty ship was, and then I also want to\nknow who else was on board.",
        "A: What is a Liberty ship? During World War II, we needed a great deal of shipping\ncap-capacity to ship the soldiers, both first to -- to Europe and then to Atlantic. So\nthere was a man by the name of Henry Kaiser, who used to make automobiles, who\nset up two assembly lines of making ships. They were called Liberty ships, they\nwere sort of tack welded together. He made one ship every two days. And they were\nsort of tacky, and against all the code violations and what have you, but they\nbrought the troops back and forth, brought them home. You know, the -- the\nGermans sank a few, but not too many. They went -- used to go in big convoys.\nAnd then in 1946, the relief for Europe, much of the grain went in Liberty ships.\nBut by \u201948 those ships were just too small for that sort of thing, so they retired them\ndown in the James River. I mean, there were -- I used to fly over the James River,\nthere used to be couple of hundred Liberty ships tied up in James River. I say,\nwhich one did I come in on? They were all the same. So that was li -- li -- a Liberty\nship.",
        "A: Yeah. Who else was on board? And -- and I\u2019m also interested in knowing what\nwas in that suitcase? You had -- have very few possessions then, but --",
        "Q: Oh yes. What was in the suitcase was an -- a small accordion. In fact, my -- the\nfirst money I ever made was playing accordion and I actually arrived in the United\nStates with 20 dollars that I made on the ship. The -- most of the people on the ship\nwere a bunch of hippies. I mean, there was no -- not too many immigrants -- or\nemigrants from Europe, you know, because the visas were very hard to get,\nparticularly immigration. But starting in \u201946 and \u00b047, lots of American college kids\nused to just go to Europe to -- just to see Europe, for whatever reasons. And that\nwas the cheapest way how to get back. And many of them subsequently became\nquite famous. For instance, on the ship was Leonard Rose, who subsequently\nbecame a very famous cellist. But th -- it was mostly a student and young kind of\nadventure, non-conformist young people who used that as the cheapest way to get\nback to the United States.",
        "Q: Now, at the end of your time as a partisan and then in the Czech army --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- you were emaciated. I wondered if, by the time that you sailed to America,\nyou had gained weight and were pretty much restored to good health?",
        "A: Well, you have to listen to my wife. My wife -- I -- I had a bad stomach until I\nmarried her. In other words, you know, I married her in 1954, but I had y-you\nknow, th-the places where I used to eat. And the kind of diet I maintained and the\nkind of schedule I maintained. So I had a very -- I never recovered until I married\nher, and then she started feeding me what she calls in a -- not very well seasoned\nhospital food. She\u2019s -- she -- she still just believes in boiled chicken and boiled\npotatoes and -- and -- and not -- not -- none of the fancy food. I love the spiced,\nfancy stuff. She doesn\u2019t feed me any of that. So I wa -- my -- my real health did not\nrecover until -- until married times.",
        "Q: Yeah. You -- you spoke about the fact that you\u2019re -- in your teenage years,\ndespite all the deprivations, you\u2019ve -- you felt as if your family was -- despite the\nhardships, maintaining a semblance of n-normal life with --",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: -- n-no feeling that there was no food and so on, but in fact, your diet must have\nbeen very restricted.",
        "A: Well, dur -- in -- from there -- from 1942 through 1944, you know, diet was very\nlimited, it was wartimes. On the other hand, my mother knew so many people and\nthey brought us fruit and they brought us things that otherwise were not available.\nOnce in awhile we had a chicken. But we only had meat once -- once a week. Most\nof the time we had dumplings, or ya -- you know, sour cream with potatoes and\nstuff like -- which was fine. I mean, I never felt deprived. I was never hungry.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Clever management. Do you have any -- I mean, did you have any long\nterm health problems that resulted from your hardships during World War II?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, I -- I had bleeding pleur -- pleurisy. So, when I came out of the\npartisans, which was on March 25, 1945, I was immediately shipped to the hospital\nand declared unfit for military duty. So they shipped me to a very good sanitorium.\nAnd -- and -- and you know, th-they started feeding me. I -- I-I -- really, I had good\nfood. And after three weeks I was declared to be totally fit to go and kill some more\nGermans. [laughs]. So -- so they shipped me out of the sanitorium and that was that.\nBut -- but m -- you know, always had problems with stomach. And of course then,\nin the summer of 1945, I had a relapse and I was again shipped to a sanitorium, but\nthat was on my own money. And I think during the month of August of 1945, I was\nbedridden for about a month, but ri -- I was fine after that.",
        "Q: So there, not surprisingly were affects of that kind of existence.",
        "A: Well, actually, the most serious disease I ever had was -- I -- I don\u2019t think I\nmentioned it, but in 1949, I went to Cooper Union, the ci-civil engineering course,\nyou know the story how I got into that -- that -- that school, wonderful school. And\nin the -- the summer of 1950, after having a course in surveying, I volunteered to go\nto Israel to do surveying of Arab lands, subdivide Arab lands, f -- you know, for the\nnew jew -- Jewish settlements. And made a load -- loads of money, I mean -- I\nmean, they really paid well. I didn\u2019t know, when they told me to go and how much\nthey will pay me, that this actually involved getting shot at, because you see, the\nsurveyors 1s the first thing you kill. You -- you -- you understand, you always take a\nshot at the surveyors. But the problem was that towards the end, and I, against any\nadvice, drank from an Arab well, water, because I was so thirsty. And I came in\nwith a horrible case of dysentery that lasted for about a year. I was sick a year af-\nafter that. But what the hell.",
        "Q: Now, tell me about meeting your wife.",
        "A: Oh, Mona, Mona was upstairs in the art school. The art school of Cooper Union.\nThe engineers were very busy, I don\u2019t -- you know, I was the class president, I was\neditor of this or that, a chairman of the judiciary and what have you. And self-\nsupporting, so I also had a job, Thursday, Friday nights and all day Saturday as a\ndraftsman, so that I -- I was making a decent living. Decent living, sure, you know,\n2,000 dollars a year was really all you needed the -- in those days. All -- you know,\nall you ate was potato chips and rotisserie chicken that you bought in a supermarket,\nand you know, perfectly good food, plus some Twinkies, you know? That -- that\ncan last very well. And there was this girl in -- in Cooper Union I had my eye on.\nShe was really a beauty, I mean, really beauti -- her hair, she had a braid all the way\ndown to her waist. She looked very traditional, she wore a dress up to her s -- to her\n-- to her neck, you know? And she was -- what -- five years younger, and she was\nvery subdued, you know, sort of -- you know the other girls in the art school were\nsort of wild. There was lots of girls. I-I was the -- the big man on campus, you\nknow, as the chairman of this and that. She was one of the girls who were -- really\ndid not come on, you know? So she was interesting. On graduation day, 1953, us\nengineers, who really didn\u2019t have time for anything because th -- you know, it was\nmuch more convenient for a date to go upstairs than to go scurrying around the\ntown. We went upstairs and we invited some of the girls from the art\n[indecipherable] to go to -- for hot dogs at Coney Island. You know, it -- that was\nthe big thing. So this whole bunch of girls from the art school -- it was one s -- one\nclass below our class. I was al -- oh -- because of my military, I was older than my -\n- my -- my -- the other guys in this school. We went to Coney Island and somehow\nthey put her next to me on the roller coaster. Now, have you ever been on a Coney\nIsland roller coaster? The most dangerous thing, I mean, people get killed all the\ntime in those days. Well, we go into the roller coaster and it\u2019s just really bad, I mean\nit\u2019s really -- I mean it\u2019s one of these extreme things. We get on the top, we come\ndiving down and this girl goes limp on me. She basically -- whatever, she either\nfainted or whatever. Well, I grab her, because you know, in those days they didn\u2019t\nhave any of the safety stuff, she could have fallen out. Well, we get off the roller\ncoaster, she\u2019s as white as a linen. And I say well, you know, I really have to take\ncare of you, I saved your life. And she said, well what do you want to do? I said,\nwell you know, I have to take you somewhere. And that\u2019s how we met and never\nleft. So that\u2019s the girl I saved. She always had an eye on me anyway.",
        "Q: Tell me about Mona\u2019s family, and do you share a lot of values? What was her\nbackground?",
        "A: Yes, her father was a very unusual guy. He was a philosopher, he was in a\nJewish tradition, a student. He really was a very bad businessman, very bad. But he\nwas a Scholar and he read. The mother pretty well ran -- wonderful woman,\nwonderful woman, her mother. They ultimately ended up living with us. And th --\nMona\u2019s father, Joe and I got along very well. Joe\u2019s idea was that the world is\ncoming to an end, and that you have to go and really live out on a farm somewhere,\nso it will be self sufficient. So he bought a 10 acre farm, upstate New York, in\nDuchess county and built a sort of a dinky house, and -- and well, got cattle and\ngeese and planted an orchard and the conversation was always survival. Subject that\nI sort of could relate to. This where went during the Cuban -- Cuban episode. So --\nso he and I used to go up, you know, as the kids, my little children were growing\nup, leaving my mother-in-law and Mona and the little kids and he and I went up\nfarming, to prepare for doomsday. It\u2019s a long, sad story. He used excessive amount\nof insecticide because he wasn\u2019t a resident there, and he ultimately got a stroke\nfrom -- from the insecticides, you know -- you know, the insecticide was very\npowerful, he over-overdosed the place with insectici -- insecticide and herbicide.",
        "Q: Now, not realizing its toxicity?",
        "A: Well, he did, but he -- he was -- it was not on his mind. But I married into a\nwonderful family, I really -- he was a true friend. Joe was a true friend. Mother -- I\ncalled her Mother, was a very loving person. She stayed with us. She was really a\ntrue grandmother to my little children. You know, we had four children, one after\nanother, and the-there was lots of work to be done. And my wife Mona never\nwanted to have any servants. First we couldn\u2019t afford it, so you know, my -- my --\nmy wife washed the diapers. I mean, there was no -- no such thing as -- you know,\nbuying them, diapers. And she taught the children -- she\u2019s -- the children were very\nliterate at the age of four.",
        "Q: So you re-created, and we -- and were blessed with a wonderful family.",
        "A: Actua --",
        "Q: Seemingly so much by chance.",
        "A: Well, 1 -- yeah --",
        "Q: The girl in the --",
        "A: Well, you know, there\u2019s no such thing as a chance, you know. You know, the -- I\n-- | -- there were lots of girls I could have picked from, and there were some girls\nwho were very seriously interested in me. In fact, there was one girl who actually\nannounced that she is marrying me and told everybody. And that\u2019s bad, though, you\ndon\u2019t do that.",
        "Q: Yeah. Now you were -- you were eyeing the woman who was right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: The sort of quiet one.",
        "A: Yeah, the quiet one.",
        "Q: And the reserved one, or -- or what have you.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: N-Now, tell me about your choices in raising the children. To some extent\nyou\u2019ve explained that really in -- in telling me how you started, but did you want to\nbring them up with this so-sort of real sense of their Jewish heritage? Did you\nobserve religious holidays?",
        "A: No, we -- they had all choice. They all had choice, and one of them is religious,\nstrong Jew, a devout Jew, reasonably so, and the other one no part of it. But\neverybody had a choice, and -- and that\u2019s their call. I never, for better or worse, for\nbetter or worse, never tried to tell my children what to do. My model has always\nbeen they have to find their own choices and then live with those choices. I was not\ngoing to mastermind for them, anything. Nothing.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And tell me about the -- your children. When they were born, and their\nnames.",
        "A: Well, Vera was born in 1957. She did extremely well in school, in high school.\nShe scored 800 on the SAT, eight zero zero, you know? [indecipherable]. You don\u2019t\nscore 800 on the SAT. Then she went to Johns Hopkins and she was going to be --\ngo study medicine, and something happened in Johns Hopkins, and I really don\u2019t\nknow what, where she suddenly just decided she was very insecure about herself.\nWhat it was, you know, I visited her; she just clammed up. She then went for a\nMaster\u2019s degree in public health. Went to work for a number of insurance\ncompanies. She\u2019s quite an expert in her field. She\u2019s a recognized expert. She has\nmaybe 80 published papers in the field. The men she always -- she is on her third\nmarriage, although one of them sort of had a heart attack and died on her. But the\nmen she always -- were sort of weak men. She -- she always picked a very weak\nperson. She has two beautiful children, absolutely gorgeous children. She\u2019s all right,\nbut she\u2019s still struggling. She still has to figure out what she wants to do. You know,\nshe\u2019s 47 now.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: The second child is Andrew. Andrew has always been interested in simulation,\nwar gaming. He is the Jew. Very militant, he -- he -- he wants to take on the whole\nworld.",
        "Q: How much younger than Vera?",
        "A: He\u2019s just barely less than two years younger than Vera. And -- and Andrew has a\nMaster\u2019s degree from Carnegie Mellon and a summa cum laude from Wesleyan.\nHe\u2019s literate. He\u2019s really a literate person. I mean, he reads. You know, he\u2019s a\nstudent. Has two boys. He married a woman he shouldn\u2019t have married. He tells me,\nDad, why didn\u2019t you tell me? She -- she married him because she expected that he\u2019s\ngoing to be a rich man. When she discovered he\u2019s not going to be a rich man, she\njust walked. It was just too much -- too much work for her to take care of. She --\nshe wanted to be taken care -- she was a Jewish princess, if you know that\nexpression.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: And, you know, Andrew is a very hard working, very honest, straight kind of a\nkid. Ab -- as straight as they can be. I mean, he\u2019s never done anything crooked, or\nanything. He has only had two jobs. [indecipherable] always everybody likes him\non the job. And that\u2019s Andrew. Then comes Steven, two years later.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Let me go back, first of all, to Andrew. Does he have custody of the\nchildren, or --",
        "A: Oh yes, he --",
        "Q: -- oh he\u2019s -- he\u2019s remarried.",
        "A: -- he\u2019s got custody.",
        "Q: Oh, oh, okay.",
        "A: Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah --",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: -- the judge looked at the situation and said, I don\u2019t want that wa -- wa -- woman\nto -- to -- to -- to have anything to do with those children, you know. Which is rare,\nby the way. Of course, when he got custody of the children, me and Mona got -- my\nwife got custody of the children. I mean, you -- you understand that, because he has\n-- he has work. And he\u2019s a consultant, he travels.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So that\u2019s Andrew. Nice guy, a nice kid. Then you have Steven. He\u2019s the rascal of\nthe family. Steven was born two years later. The jokester. Bright as can be.",
        "Q: Like his father, sounds like?",
        "A: Oh, he\u2019s a fa -- he\u2019s a jokester. Never cracks a book in his life and always gets A\ngrades. And I said, Steven, how do you do it? [indecipherable] well, I study the\nteacher, I don\u2019t study the subject. He has a Ph.D. from M.I.T., has a undergraduate\ndegree. He just went to M.I.T. and stayed. He would have stayed in M.I.T. all his\nlife, he di -- had a great time, lots of girls. Good looking boy. I mean, he just draws\ngirls like -- like -- like, you know, the catnip, you know, just very congenial. He\u2019s a\nBoy Scout and an Eagle Scout. A real solid citizen, honest as can be. Very smart,\nvery good friend of mine. Very good friend of mine. I mean, he and I talk once or\ntwice a day. Let me give you a Steven typical. Comes high school. I say, Steven,\nyou have to start applying to college. He says, it\u2019s too much paperwork. And -- and\nthen I-I say, well yeah, but you have to, you know, you have to spread your risk,\nyou know, you have a number of col -- where do you want to go? Well Dad, you\nwent to M.I.T., I go to M.LT.. I say, it\u2019s hard to get to M.I.T.. Oh, don\u2019t worry. So,\nyou know, now -- now -- now, you know, it\u2019s March and I say, Steven, where are\nyour applications? Well, I applied for early admission to M.I.T.. Now, you know, in\nthose days, early admission means that you don\u2019t apply to anybody else and you\u2019ve\n-- you understand, you -- you -- you -- you just roll your dice, and that\u2019s it. I said,\nyou can\u2019t do that. He goes up to -- to -- to M.I.T. for an interview. I buy him a\nBrooks Brothers suit, th-the kid has never wore a suit in his life before or ever after.\nOne of the beautiful things about Steven is very early, you know, I had computers\nin my house. Never told the kids to go be interested in computers. Steven -- all my\nkids had to go to work at the age of 13, just like my father, you know, you -- you\nhave to have a trade. Steven decided to sell Apple computers. This is when Apple\ncame out. Well, the salesman in the electronics store didn\u2019t have a clue what an\nApple computer was like. Steven was a hacker from the word go. He sold more\nApple computers than anybody else. So -- so he goes up to M.I.T. and they -- during\nthe interview he tells them how to sell microcomputers. M.I.T. said, well, you\nknow, fine. Early admission? You\u2019re in. So he comes back in the evening by train\nfrom Boston, sort of mischievously, like I didn\u2019t do it kind of a thing. I say, well\nSteve, what happened? Well, they accepted me. I said, well, when are you starting?\nWell, they accepted me. So -- so he never filled out a piece of paper. I mean, he\u2019s a\nreal rascal. I mean, this kid is a rascal. Very good natured, really helping me. Y-You\nknow, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m doing some fairly complicated things. So that\u2019s Steven. And then\nof course, comes --",
        "Q: And M.I.T. made a good choice.",
        "A: And M.I.T. made a good choice, yeah, yeah. And then, of course, comes the\napple of my heart, Eric, the youngest. Beautiful child. I mean, this kid had\neverything. Eagle Scout. He was -- he\u2019d has his own software company. He started\ndoing software in high school, when a teacher gave him a project to do, physics,\nlike a pendulum, he wrote a software program to solve all the pendulum problems\nin the world, and handed in a floppy disk as his homework. The teacher then said,\nyou know what -- and now, Eric is now 14. There may be other kids who would\nwant to -- to -- to take advantage of this thing. So Eric, with my help, opens a\nsoftware business, Strassmann, Incorporated, and start selling and licensing\nworldwide, Apple programs to be peddled to high schools throughout the world to\nsolve homework in physics.",
        "Q: Wh-Where were you living then? Where did th -- where did he go to school?",
        "A: Well, we -- we -- we -- we lived in New York and then when Vera came we had\na small, two bedroom apartment. And then when the other kids came, I bought a\nhouse in Mount Vernon, a four bedroom apartment. I always wanted the kids to\nhave their own bedrooms. And then I built, in 1969 -- in \u201968, this absolutely\ngorgeous house in Chappaqua, a six bedroom house. I mean it really -- it made the\nfront page of the real estate section of the New York Times. It was made out of\nredwood, I mean, and it was made by Finnish carpe -- boat carpenters, who used to\ncome during the winter season when Finland sort of freezes up, to work here where\nit\u2019s warmer. And they built my house like a ship. I mean, it was really some house.",
        "Q: Like Shackleton\u2019s boat.",
        "A: Oh yeah, that -- that was really built. And -- and so --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection. This\nis an interview with Paul Strassmann, conducted by Margaret West, on January the\n8, 2004, in New Canaan, Connecticut. This interview is part of the United States\nHolocaust Memorial Museum\u2019s post-Holocaust interview project, and is a follow up\nJuly the 11\", 1990. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully\nacknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible. This is tape\nnumber three, side A. Chappaqua.",
        "A: Chappaqua.",
        "Q: You --",
        "A: So s -- and Eric could do anything. He -- he was a worker, for instance. You\nknow, he was 12 years old when we built the house. He laid the pavement for the\nsidewalks. He -- he was a worker. This kid, I mean, you know, we have pictures of\nhim, always with a shovel, or something, or helping. A scout, very much admired as\na scout. Very thoughtful. He -- he was a -- a child that was thinking about -- was not\nimpulsive. He was a very thoughtful, very bright, but not assertive, he was sort of a\nlovable teddy bear. Everybody loved this kid. And -- and -- but he always liked to\nexperiment. He did -- I mean, he did always something, you know, he -- he -- he put\na knife into the electrical socket when he was three years old. He climbed this tall\ntree that we have here, this 50 foot tree, all the way to the top to see how far he can\ngo. As quiet as he was, he was always pushing the limit. This kid did not have any\nlimits. And so we lost him in 1984. I must say that was the most devastating thing\nthat ever happened to me. I mean, this is -- you know, when you look at life, you\nknow, what happened over the last 75 years, that is the thing that was the -- the\nworst thing. Worse than the Holocaust, worse than anything, because this kid was\njust -- and he\u2019s destroyed my wife. I mean, she -- she just absolutely shrank, as a\nresult. And life has never been the same. He was such a good kid, and -- and -- you\nknow, I -- I always felt that if I ever have somebody who could be a president of the\nUnited States, that was the kid who could make it. You know, the -- the -- when you\nget an Eagle Scout, there\u2019s a -- what\u2019s called a court of honor. Do you know about\nEagle Scouts?",
        "Q: I do.",
        "A: It\u2019s a big deal.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It\u2019s a big deal.",
        "Q: It shows a lot of discipline and dedication and it\u2019s a big accomplishment for a\nkid.",
        "A: And -- and charisma, because you have to be able to organize the other kids, who\nlook to him as a leader. Everybody always looked to him as a leader because he was\nnot a pushy -- he was a leader leader, he actually went out and did things. He wa --\na-at the court of honor the scout executive said, well I\u2019ve seen lots of Eagles in my\nlife, never seen one like this. So that is the tragedy, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: What happened?",
        "A: Ah, it\u2019s a long story. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s a -- yeah. It\u2019s -- again, he was pushing, he was\npushing the limit.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And of course pushing the limit is what special people do.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: And I suppose -- would you say that that\u2019s what you had done always? Or was\nEric [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah. Yeah, an-and he was very close to me. You know, his\nstatement always were, when I grow up I want to be just like Dad. And he always\nasked me how -- why did you do this, why did you do this?",
        "Q: What did you -- I wondered if there\u2019s anything special that you did in memory of\nhim. I only ask that cause --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- sometimes -- oh, I -- I\u2019m -- I shouldn\u2019t be putting his on tape [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, what happened was, he was so admired at Harvard that Harvard did\nsomething that has never been done before. The students, from their own money,\nwhen they graduated, decided to take all the money -- because you know, when the\nstudents go in and they sell their books and furniture to the next class, and what\nhave you, they took all the money and informed the faculty that they are putting a\ngranite bench with Eric\u2019s name on the quadrangle. Now, you know, there\u2019s lots of\nrich kids at Harvard and so forth. There\u2019s lots of parents. Mr. Bok, who was the pre\n-- chairman -- president of Harvard was so taken --",
        "Q: Derek Bok.",
        "A: -- Derek Bok was so taken by it, that he gave permission for the students to put\nthat bench into the grove on the quadrangle and it\u2019s still there to this day. What I\nhave done, Eric\u2019s royalties for the software -- you know, by the way, all my books\nare dedicated to him -- Eric\u2019s royalties go into a fund to send Boy Scouts who\ncannot afford it to summer camp. It continues to this day. And there is a library,\nEric\u2019s computer library in -- in a kibbutz in Israel. There is a funding to put\ncomputer books there in his memory. It\u2019s going to be 20 years this year, and I\u2019m\nputting together, right now, in the middle, putting together a book about Eric for his\nsiblings and for the grandchildren.",
        "Q: Good. You know, I\u2019d -- I -- my comment before, it doesn\u2019t really have a place in\nthe interview, but a boy who lived next door died on that Lockerbie plane crash.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Special -- a special young man, I think, and his parents started a music\nscholarship, and it just simply that it\u2019s -- the students benefiting from the\nscholarship has been helpful to them --",
        "A: Oh yeah, I know --",
        "Q: -- to feel that --",
        "A: -- that it\u2019s the right thing to do.",
        "Q: -- but it\u2019s some --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But I\u2019m sorry that you had such a loss. Hard for -- hard for your other children,\ntoo. Their loss is different to yours, but they see you suffering in a way they --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- both parents, anyway. The -- going on. Let\u2019s move on now to your career.",
        "A: Okay, yeah.",
        "Q: I really -- family came first.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But then you\u2019ve had a really most interesting career, which you say was because\nyou became involved with computers, but I think 1t was much more.",
        "A: Yeah, wh-what happened over here was after Cooper Union, when I\u2019ve -- and I\nfinished Tau Beta Pi, and you know, honors, and number two man in a very tough\nschool. Cooper Union 1s a tough school because it\u2019s all -- everybody there is on\nscholarship. And it was very competitive, these were -- this was the last crop of\nWorld War II veterans who went on the G.I. Bill of Rights to school, and th-they --\nthey were a different generation, I mean, very serious students, I mean no\nhorseplay, no nothing. And my conclusions was that although I loved engineering\nand always wanted to be an engineer, I felt that I just didn\u2019t have -- I was not an\neducated person. And there was a trustee of Cooper Union by the name of Rossi,\nwho set up a scholarship for the Sloane School at M.I.T., which in those days was\nother than Harvard Business School, but for engineers it was the school on -- on --\non -- on management. And I was nominated for the Rossi scholarship, because of all\nof that. And I basically said that -- that I would love to go to M.LT. -- and by the\nway, M.I.T. accepted me, but a Strassmann doesn\u2019t take scholarship money from\nanybody, I am self-supporting. Now everybody tells me, including my wife Mona,\nthat was absolutely stupid. But I declined the scholarship because I considered it a\nact of charity. Now, this was still the old way, you know, you don\u2019t take money\nfrom anybody.",
        "Q: Adolf Strassmann\u2019s son.",
        "A: Yeah, I don -- doesn\u2019t take money from anybody. So -- and I just made quite a\nbit of money working on the New Jersey turnpike, summers. So -- so -- so I said,\nwell, I\u2019m going to pay my own way, which I could afford. You know, in those days\nthe tuition at M.I.T. was 40 -- 4,500 dollars, which was an awful lot of money, but I\nmade eight. And of course, I worked overtime and weekends and what have you,\nbut I had 8,000 dollars, so I could afford 4,500 dollars. So I went to M.I.T. Sloane\nschool. That\u2019s when I started dating Mona. Mona was either in New York or at her\ndad\u2019s country place in Salt Point, New York, Godforsaken place out in the boonies.\nAnd she just said, well, if you\u2019re interested in me, you better court me. And I asked\nher father for permission for me to court her, you know. He says, take her, you\nknow? He liked me very much. But, you know, you don\u2019t -- did -- don\u2019t ask --\nnobody does that any more. So I said, yeah, but 1-in the Bible, you -- I have to earn\na wife, and I don\u2019t have money. So, he said, well, you know, what do you want to\ndo? I said, well I want to do something on this farm for you so that I can show,\nbecause it was a -- Abraham built for his father-in-law Laban, a enclosure for sheep.\nSaid, I\u2019m going to build something for you. And my father-in-law -- potential\nfather-in-law said, well, you know, I could really use a barn. So I built a 22 by 22\nbarn to earn my wife, which was subject to lots of conversations over the years. So I\nfinished that, and the --",
        "Q: Who helped you?",
        "A: Oh, my father-in-law helped me, you know, you know. But -- but I d -- I did\nquite a bit of 1t myself. But that was considered t-to be that, you know, how old-\nfashioned do you want to get, I mean, you know, you\u2019re really getting Biblical. But\nI felt, you know, I have to earn -- this is a wife, I have to earn it, you know? So that\nwas that. So while I was working weekends on the barn, I was also working for a\ncompany who was building the New Jersey turnpike. And the problem was that that\nsummer there was a dispute about toll collectors, and you may or may not have\nheard that story. You haven\u2019t heard the story?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Oh, that\u2019s the story. Well, I\u2019m sitting in a drafting room, checking blueprints,\nyou know, a-and there was no air conditioning, and when you lean your sweat on an\nOzalid blueprint, you leave an orange mark, yeah, really miserable, smelly, but that\nwas the job I had. And one day as -- as -- as Al Matimbi, the senior partner of\nHoward, Needles, Tammen and Bergendoff, a very distinguished consulting firm,\nthey built most of the turnpikes in the United States, walks through. He says,\nStrassmann, I understand you going to M.I.T.. Yeah. What are you going to study? I\nsaid, well I\u2019m going to study management. He said, well do you know anything\nabout statistics? Oh, sure. Well, we got a problem. We have a union dispute on the\nNew Jersey turnpike we just built, where the toll collectors say that we are -- that\nthey are overworked. And we need somehow to figure out whether they are\noverworked or not, because the governor goes through the tollgates and finds that\nthey are just standing there doing nothing. Course the governor goes to work at 11\no\u2019clock in the morning, but -- ah, so I said, oh, th-th-this thing 1s answer, you know,\nyou have punch tickets in ev-ev-every toll gate, with round holes. All you have to\ndo is count the punch tickets and find out how many cars go through, do some time\nmotion studies on the toll collector -- I make it up as I go, and we\u2019 ll figure out\nwhether they are overworked or not. He said, you know what? Let me take you off\nthis -- this drawing board and let me put you to work on the New Jersey turnpike.\nFor the next two years in grad school, I processed hundred thousands of punch\ncards from the New Jersey turnpike, through the only place in the world where there\nwas a computer like this, M.I.T.. When I got done I had a Master\u2019s thesis, which is\ntoday considered to be the first Master\u2019s thesis in the United States on business\napplication of computer. That computer scheduled toll collectors and compared\nwhat they were doing against what the machine was doing. I got paid an awful lot\nof money. Howard, Needles got paid extremely well for this thing.",
        "Q: Everybody was happy.",
        "A: Everybody was happy. I finally had enough money to be able to afford a wife,\nbecause I was not going to have a wife -- my father-in-law was going to give me\nmoney. I said, f-forget about it, you know, I -- I\u2019m supporting my wife. So -- so I\ngot into computers in 1954. Really liked it and from then on I was in computers and\n-- and -- so you sort of wander into these things almost -- almost by accident.",
        "Q: Well, to what extent do you think that your career has been luck, arising out of\nthe story you just told, or is it much more complex, with strands that come from\nyour background and also energy and discipline and --",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: -- maybe ambition.",
        "A: Yeah, my -- my children have always asked me the question. My answer to that\nis everybody has luck. The question is, do you pick it up or not. But everybody,\nsooner or later, has luck. The -- everybody has coincidences, and some people jump\nat it, and some people sort of walk away from it, or don\u2019t recognize it.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: So --",
        "Q: Someone else might have said, oh I don\u2019t think you -- I\u2019m prepared at M.I.T. to\nhelp you with those punch cards.",
        "A: Oh, yeah, something like -- something like that. And -- and so the ga -- the\nquestion 1s -- again, coming back to this whole question of choice, luck is -- and I\u2019m\ngiving you the mathematical concept, luck is an event, it\u2019s in -- what\u2019s called a\nnode. And out of that node goes a number of options. One of the options is to do\nnothing. Another option, of course, not even know that you have a node. Now the\nreal game of life is that you have a node, which happens, and it happens to\neverybody. Now, of course, if you are in America, you have more nodes than if you\nare in the Soviet Union. I mean, this is -- this is part of the social context. In other\nwords, you cannot say that a peasant 1n India a -- or in -- in Bangladesh has all his\nluck opportunities. Th -- you know they are -- the tragedy, they are all constrained\nin a world where there are no choices at all. But if you are in America and you\nhappen to be moving 1n a given direction which seems to be evolving and where the\noptions are continually opening -- in other words, if you are in -- in making buggy\nwhips, you know, ther -- ye -- you know, you\u2019re th -- unless you do something else,\nyou know, you just don\u2019t have those options. But the luck is there, it\u2019s always there.\nIn America more so. And as you climb up on the chain of luck, which by the way\nlooks -- gr-graphically it\u2019s represented at what\u2019s called a decision tree. I don\u2019t -- I\nmean, there\u2019s a formal branch of economics called decision trees. By the way, ma --\nthe first professional paper I ever wrote, that was published, was on so-called\nstocastic decision trees. Stocastic 1s probabilistic decision trees tr -- dec -- decision\ntrees that branch out probabilistically. Which means at any given juncture you don\u2019t\nonly have branches, one or two branches, but you have a whole spectrum. It\u2019s just --\njust occurred to me I never mentioned it that way, but that -- coming back to the\nquestion of -- of luck, what you learn from Holocaust, coming back to the theme, is\nthat certain things happen, or the -- what happened in 1944 is that I go where the\nshooting is. I go up the mountain, I get a hand grenade, come down the mountain\nand there is bunch of Russian commando groups who just looking for somebody\njust like me to walk ahead of them, okay? Now that\u2019s stupid luck, okay? Now\nsomebody else would say, well, you know, I\u2019m not going to go with the Russians.\nBy the way, the guy who went with me, imme -- immediately wanted no part of it\nbecause the Russians were really a ragtag bunch of bandits. I mean, they were really\na bunch of bandits. And I say, bandits, you know, this is fine, you know? Besides,\nthey wanted me, you know. Besides, they gave me a rifle, you know? So luck\nhappens and then you learn to -- to push it -- push it, as far as you can do. Now, in\ncase of my son Eric, he pushed it too far. But, there you go. So -- so th -- that is the\nmodel, then. The -- the model of the Holocaust is that those people who get\nsquashed, and there are lots of them, wh-who -- you -- you know, the people who\nbrought me to America, you know, the friend of my father\u2019s and so forth --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- they stayed confined. They started -- they went into the Jewish lodge and they\nmeet Sundays, for years and years, bemoaning the tragedy and what happened, and\nthey sti-still speak Slovak, and they have lectures about, you know, Vienna in 1934,\nand th -- Prague -- you know, Prague theater in 1932. I mean, they\u2019re still in the\nback country. They\u2019re still mentally back there.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: The -- the -- the -- th-the model that I believe I represent is -- the notion 1s that\nopportunities happen, and you have to look forward, and see how far it gets you,\neven if it kills you.",
        "Q: Take risks, seizes opportunities.",
        "A: Seize opportunities, take risk, and -- but do it within certain confines of value,\nbecause there are others who came to the United States, Jews --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- who basically went after money, you know, how much money can I make?\nAnd they become speculators, criminals, embezzlers, con artists, stock market map\n-- manipulators and all of that. There\u2019s -- you know, New York is full of that. I\nmean, there\u2019s -- there is a whole Jewish money-optimizing, with no feeling for\nAmerica, no feeling for the community, no feeling for the society, who are very,\nvery successful, particularly in real estate and so forth.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: You know, beco -- becoming billionaires. Money is an outcome. I always tell my\nchildren, whether you get money, or don\u2019t get money, well that\u2019s an outcome.\nThat\u2019s not a goal, ever. So, you know, one has to really put around this whole\nquestion of -- of values, also a question of what do you represen -- what are your\nbeliefs? What is the ethics? And what is the -- what\u2019s called the sense of honor.",
        "Q: Right. Which -- which your faith t -- informs, if you like, if you allow it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: I mean, what your faith teaches.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: To --",
        "A: Yeah, th-th -- this is the essence of faith. The essence of faith is grace,\nfellowship, trying to make life better 1f you can, and have responsibility to your\nsociety and to your community. And so that\u2019s -- it\u2019s this -- but you never, never\ncompromise on that, even if it works against you. For instance, you know, the\npeople in the Jewish circle, particularly the people who brought me to America,\nalways berated me that I never applied for reparations from the Nazis. I mean, just -\n- you know, it\u2019s unthinkable. I mean, it\u2019s just -- just not right. Just not right.",
        "Q: They felt?",
        "A: No, I felt it was not right.",
        "Q: Oh, right.",
        "A: But they felt it was not right for me not to do it because you know, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m\nleaving the -- the bastards with money. But 1 -- but -- but that\u2019s not the question of\nmoney, it\u2019s a question of honor.",
        "Q: Yes. You know, I -- I know sometimes people feel that it\u2019s at least a -- a -- a\ngesture that has meaning for them. I mean, wh-wh-wh-why do you think y -- y --\nyou feel it\u2019s sort of morally wrong?",
        "A: Yeah, a -- a -- a moral wrong di -- does not get right by money.",
        "Q: By a pay -- amount of money.",
        "A: By paying them the money, ever.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Okay. You know, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s very fundamental.",
        "Q: Yes. I have to think about that, just because I was thinking of a case where a\nfriend whose, you know, family lost property in Vienna, but just felt deeply moved\nto -- to get this sort of -- the paperwork of reparations and so on. The -- the\nacknowledgement of --",
        "A: That was so wrong that the acknowledgement isn\u2019t good enough. No amount of\nacknowledgement is good enough, okay?",
        "Q: Yes, of course, yeah, you\u2019re -- you\u2019re right. I -- I needed to think about it.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. No -- I mean, just not right. Certain things are such horrible crimes -",
        "Q: Yeah. But how can --",
        "A: And sometimes doing the right thing, against your interest, turns out to be\nunbelievably attractive and profitable. Let me give you a si -- my favorite story. My\nfavorite story is here I become the chief information officer of Kraft. You know,\nSealtest milk, ice cream, cheese on the loading dock. I have 48 computers making it\npossible for people to come up at four o\u2019clock in the morning to the sh -- loading\ndock, get the pieces of paper, where they deliver this ice cream, or this cream and so\nforth. And it -- now it\u2019s 1963, and I just can\u2019t get all of the -- the business is\nfantastic and now they want more sophisticated delivery tickets, what have you, and\nIBM cannot do it. Just can\u2019t do it. IBM says, well look, we are making new\nmachines, the 360 series are going to be fantastic, but we cannot give you machines\nthat can cope with your workload. And I said, guys, you know, you keep promising\nthings to me and you\u2019re not delivering. Well, it turns out that I get a phone call from\na guy by the name of Art Messerschmitt from Syracuse, and he says, you know, I\u2019m\ngolfing with this Honeywell salesman and the Honeywell salesman -- and I know\nthey have a very good machine -- the Honeywell salesman tells me he\u2019s going to\nput a Honeywell machine side by side with the IBM machine, charge me nothing,\nand when the Honeywell machine does exactly what the IBM machine, but twice as\nmuch for half the price, you have to promise me that I can get rid of the IBM\nmachine. Now, in 1963 getting rid of IBM 1s, if you know, no-no. I mean, they just\n-- not good for your career. You understand that? I said --",
        "Q: Now -- yes, I -- I know the saying, nobody --",
        "A: [indecipherable] fired.",
        "Q: -- what did they say? Nobody ever gets fired for -- yeah.",
        "A: So I say, Art, you know, what the hell? Go ahead and do it. So Art\nMesserschmitt brings in the Honeywell machine, slides it in, it is fantastic. Get rid\nof that IBM machine. Well, so then the other controllers -- I mean, you know, the\nmilk business, these are -- the people in Sealtest and Kraft are middle America.\nPenny pinching, honest farm guy, none of this fancy New York stuff. And they said,\nwhat the hell, you know? It\u2019s three cents for a carload of this stuff, let\u2019s get some\nmore Honeywells in, so the -- I started rolling in Honeywell. Well, IBM gets very\nexcited. What IBM does in those days 1s they get the guy who does this thing fired.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, yeah.",
        "A: I mean -- [indecipherable] So they --",
        "Q: I should add -- you know, when we made that comment, an aside, I should finish\nit, which is, nobody ever gets fired for buying IBM.",
        "A: That\u2019s right [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Anyway.",
        "A: Yeah, well, the -- it works the other way.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: He gets fired if you get rid of IBM. So IBM sends one of their heavies, an\nexecutive vice-president to have golf with Edwards, the Chairman of the Board of\nKraft. And they go golfing, they\u2019re having a good time, they\u2019re friends and this. Oh,\nthen after the golf, the executive vice president of IBM says to the chairman of\nKraft, you know, this guy Strassmann 1s really taking lots of risks, I mean, getting\nrid of --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: -- this guy has reputation. He\u2019s a risk taker, and you know, if you were 1n the\nbusiness, you don\u2019t want to take any risks. Besides, IBM is going to have these new\nmachines, you know. And Gordon Edwards, a good old Texan, says, you know, Joe,\nwhen you have those machines and you\u2019re ready to ship them, we have -- you have\norders for them, yeah. We\u2019ll test them too. Meanwhile, Strassmann is shipping ice\ncream on a loading dock and it\u2019s not melting. So, you know, what\u2019s the problem?\nSo Strassmann -- everybody -- of course everybody tells this story, you know, the --\nthe -- the -- the -- the Kraft company is good old boys. This is sen -- middle\nAmerica. This is good old boys, you know. They think this is very funny. They\nthink this is a riot. They talk about it. Four years later, Xerox decides to go into\ncomputer business. And they buy this company, which was a bad company to begin\nwith, p-pay billion dollars for it. The chairman of the board of Xerox announces that\nthe way how they\u2019re going to prove that this turkey is really good 1s that we are\ngoing to get rid of all of our IBM computers, and I have just the guy who knows\nhow to get rid of. So they hire me, double my salaries and were willing to pay me\n5,000 shares of Xerox stock for every IBM computer I get rid of. That\u2019s what built\nthis house. Every store you look in there\u2019s an IBM computer. You know, I can point\nto the [indecipherable] you know. So -- so that is how things can sometimes work\nfor you. Xerox needed -- the only guy with a track record of getting rid of IBM\ncomputers in the United States, was Paul Strassmann.",
        "Q: Good story.",
        "A: So, a similar story is -- a similar story is when I retired from Xerox -- again, I\u2019m\ndistr-splaying a morality. The morality 1s, good, bad or indifferent -- I mean,\nGordon Edwards could have come back from that golf game and fired me on the\nspot, for whatever reason.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But that\u2019s not the way I play the game. If they would have wanted to fire me, this\nwas not going to be a company for me to work for anyway, you know. Years later,\nI\u2019m wi -- quite an expert, I write a couple of books about computers. General\nMotors buys EDS, this big corporation. EDS takes over all computers from General\nMotors, it\u2019s a absolute disaster. Ross Perot gets greedy, starts charging General\nMotors excess money. General Motors plant managers don\u2019t get any bonuses, EDS\ngets all the bonuses. So the vice-chairman of General Motors is given the job to find\nout whether EDS is overcharging or not. Guess who they hire? Paul Strassmann.\nYou see, I don\u2019t have any consultants, I don\u2019t have -- I don\u2019t bring in a big staff. I\nam a well known expert in the fie-field. I study the situation, I call up the vice-\nchairman of General Motors and say, look, they\u2019re overcharging you. And then he -\n- he says, well how much are they overcharging me? They are overcharging you at\nleast 300 million dollars a year, which is quite a bit of money. And it\u2019s actually\nmore, but 300 million dollars you can prove. So he says, you know, this is very\ndifficult, Ross Perot is on the Board of Directors of General Motors. I have to bring\nit up before the board. Why don\u2019t you write a half page memorandum, stand by\nuntil the board meeting and just before the board meeting you fax it to my secretary\noutside of the board meeting and I\u2019Il read it to the board. Which he does -- I mean,\nthis was going to be hush-hush. By three o\u2019clock in the afternoon every plant\nmanager in General Motors who hates the guts of EDS has a copy of Strassmann\u2019s\nmemo that they\u2019re overcharged by 300 million doll -- which is out of their pocket,\nyou know?",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: So General Motors says, you know, sorry, you know, this really caused all kinds\nof problems. We\u2019re going to pay you your fee, but we cannot employ you any more.\nI come home, Mona tells me, you know, Strassmann, again, you know, you just\nplay it straight, you know? You missed a great opportunity getting a consulting\ncontract from General Motors. You -- couldn\u2019t you have varnished it a little or\nsomething? I say, well that\u2019s the way it is. Six months later, the vice-chairman of\nGeneral Motors is now deputy secretary of defense, working for Dick Cheney.\nSoviet Union collapses --",
        "Q: Who -- who would that be?",
        "A: Donald Atwood.",
        "Q: Okay I mean a -- wondered if I knew the name. Anyway.",
        "A: Yeah, Donald Atwood.",
        "Q: Yes. That\u2019s not the point, it\u2019s [indecipherable]",
        "A: W-We -- Congress decides [indecipherable] dividend, cuts the department of ar -\n- Department of Defense budget by 75 billion dollars. And Cheney turns to Donald\nAtwood say, well you know, find the 75 billion dollars. Donald can find 30, but\nthere is -- he\u2019s short, you know, he\u2019s short quite a bit. So he said, well we are going\nto do it by corporate information [indecipherable] we are going to bring into the\ndepartment of defer -- corporate information management based on computers. You\nknow, this is -- this is -- this is a holy grail, you know, every couple of years this\nidea perks up and dies.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Okay. And I am just the bastard who knows how to do it. And guess what? I get\npulled into the Department of Defense as the first Chief Information Officer of the\nDepartment of Defense --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- to do the job.",
        "Q: And I assume you were much needed.",
        "A: Oh yes. I mean, everybody agrees and you know, I and -- you know, I\n[indecipherable] I don\u2019t know how many billions I saved, but I at least set the thing\nin a direction -- finally Rumsfeld is doing it now, but it takes a long time to move\nthat -- that thing. But again, you know, who would have known that by calling the\nshots on General Motors, would end -- will end me up in this -- this position. So\nthere\u2019s a story.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Now, just to show you how luck or opportunity works, I get into the Department\nof Defense, and I look around, and I say, well what\u2019s wrong is computers report to\nthe controller. Computers should not report to the controller because finance people\njust keeps computers under throttle, computers is a weapon, it\u2019s a military weapon,\nit\u2019s a command and control weapon. Let\u2019s yank out the computers away from the\ncontroller. Now, to do that in the Department of Defense, I mean, 1s -- this is hard.",
        "Q: Rock the boat.",
        "A: Tha-That\u2019s really rocking the boat. We rocked the boat, guess what? Donald\nAtwood wanted to do it anyway, now he pulls the responsibility for computers away\nfrom the controller of the depart -- where it has been for the prior 50 years. The\ncontroller of the Department of Defense is a guy by the name of Sean O\u2019Keefe. So\nwe -- we make an enemy right there. So we take it out, we bring it under and the\nassistant Secretary of Defense for command and control, the military loves me. The\nmilitary just loves me. I get a big checkbook, I start spending money on the special\nforces, who until then didn\u2019t get the money. They make me an honorary Green\nBeret, they find out that I was a guerilla fighter. Boy, this is one of our guys, he\u2019s\none of ours. And of course, I give them the money, you know, I move the money\naway from finance and give it to the war fighters. I mean, you can\u2019t go wrong, I\nmean. So the story then goes, I retire from the Department of Defense with all the\nhonors, you know, but when Clinton gan -- comes in, that\u2019s not the place for me to\nbe, I mean, I just can\u2019t stand the guy. NASA gets into trouble. The new\nadministrator of NASA is one Sean O\u2019 Keefe. He says, I know just the bastard to\nstraighten out this place.",
        "Q: Well, he -- yo-you made an enemy of him, but he could see that the action taken\nwas right?",
        "A: No, what happens is that people disagree with me, but everybody respects me.",
        "Q: Exactly.",
        "A: Yeah. And so I get a call that, you know, would you like to do some consulting\nfor NASA? So I -- sure. I come down to NASA. They showed me everything else. I\ndidn\u2019t know I was walking into a setup. I ga -- arrive at NASA at nine o\u2019clock in the\nmorning. They give me the review of the situation. I said, you guys are just in an\nawful mess. Okay, Mr. Strassmann, what would do? I said, well there are three\nthings you have to do. Well, you know, now it\u2019s 3:30 in the afternoon, would you\nlike to walk up and present your findings to the administrator? I walk in, oh Paul, so\nnice to see you, so glad to see -- you know. I present the thing, and he said, well,\nyou know, that makes awful sense. Guess what, you\u2019re staying here and you\u2019re\ngoing to fix it. I said, well I\u2019m here for a consulting. No, you\u2019re coming -- you\u2019re\nstaying here and fixing it. I say, well you cannot appoint me to a senior executive\nposition in the federal government that easily. He said, you think I can\u2019t? So he\nsaid, well, will you take it? I say, well, you know, I am a servant of this country. If -\n- if am asked to do something -- he says, just wait a moment, picks up the phone,\nbrings in lawyers, what have you. I walk at 6:30 that evening with a badge, as the\nChief Information Officer of NASA. Now, the question is luck, opportunity, or\nwhat, but there is a pattern. You know, I have many stories like that.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I mean, lots of stories like that. The -- the -- the paradigm of the Holocaust, the --\ncoming back to the Holocaust is that what I learned from the Holocaust is that there\nis always opportunity. You cannot stay in a position where there\u2019s no opportunity,\nbecause you die, one way or another. And this is true. In the Holocaust this is also\ntrue, in business, this true everywhere in life. And within bounds of ethics and\nhonor and commitment and service, you just do what\u2019s right. And then if you\nhappen to get money for it, well so be it.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But that\u2019s not the way I make the -- the decisions. That\u2019s not the way to make\ndecisions.",
        "Q: You know, there\u2019s a Quaker saying, you do good, and do well.",
        "A: Well, sure, y -- well, yeah. But -- and the well may or may not come.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. That\u2019s right.",
        "A: So that -- that is really -- I think -- not just Paul Strassmann, this is -- this is\nbigger than Paul Strassmann, has to do with history of Jews --",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: -- has to do with preservation, has to do --",
        "Q: That\u2019s what I was going to ask. It\u2019s not just the Holocaust, it\u2019s really the history\nof a people.",
        "A: It\u2019s a -- oh, history of a people. Jews, when you look at the history of the people,\nhave been extremely successful in survival. They are the oldest survive --\ncontinually survivable civilization and culture. There\u2019s nobody else who goes that\nfar back in a line of succession. The Egyptians are gone, the Romans are gone, the\nGreeks are gone. The Chinese empire has come and gone. But as a continuum, as a\nthread, there has be -- there has been a paradigm there that basically says that you --\nyou -- you -- you diversify. You don\u2019t know -- do not get stuck in Judea. Sure, you\nmay fight the Romans, but everybody else who fought the Romans and stayed\nwhere they were, are gone.",
        "Q: And then I was thinking of Eric\u2019s place in that evolution, that you lose some --",
        "A: Yeah, and then you lose some.",
        "Q: Of --",
        "A: There\u2019s horrendous losses. There are horrendous losses in the process.",
        "Q: Mm. But you could say they\u2019re not in vain, because they\u2019re part of the --",
        "A: They\u2019re part of the -- part of the --",
        "Q: -- thread.",
        "A: -- part of the thread.",
        "Q: And all your -- all your honors and awards are --",
        "A: So what?",
        "Q: -- fit with the pattern -- I know.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- yeah, yeah, just milestones, that\u2019s all. That\u2019s all they are.",
        "Q: Yes. [indecipherable][tape break] There are many other things we haven\u2019t\ncovered.",
        "A: Oh, sure. My relationship with the Holocaust Museum goes back to perhaps as\nearly as 1990 -- no, no, no, no, 1988, when -- 1988 when I gave a lecture at the\nHolocaust Museum on -- on the fact that the great lessons of the Slovak no --\nuprising was the fact that a Jewish brigade at the labor camp, the slave labor camp,\nmarched out as a bat -- armed battalion, as organized battalion and participated as a\nJewish organized military unit, although the -- the Jewish brigade in the British\narmy was organized in Tobruk in November of 1944, the Jewish brigade organized\nin Slovakia as a Jewish unit, goes back to August 29\", 1944. And I wanted to point\nout that -- that -- that unit, perhaps, is the first organized Jewish military unit that\nwent to war since A.D. 70. There was some interest on the part of the Holocaust\nMuseum, but in those days the Holocaust Museum was very much concerned about\ncrying about the enormity of the crime, Holocaust. The idea of fighting, Jews\nfighting and opposing by action, the actions on the part of the Germans was not\nhigh on the agenda, except there was a -- a researcher in the -- in the -- the\nHolocaust Museum, a Dr. Sybil Milton, who got very much interested in the\nsubject, and subsequently, when I was in Washington, I met with Dr. Milton several\ntimes, we had lunch together. And I tried to convey to you my sense of the\nHolocaust, namely that this was not necessary some evil maniac plot, but 1t was a\nhistorical evolution of a state machinery that went berserk. In other words, the\nNazis and Hitler unleashed the power of the state to its ultimate form of destruction.\nYou know, the state has always done pogroms and done injustice, and done all\nkinds of things, but here, the superiority of industrial organization and scientific\norganization, in fact, went to its ultimate conclusion, namely, we are just going to\nplan, methodically, to destroy people. And the enormity of the Holocaust really lies\nin the fact that -- in its engineering. In other words, it was planned as an engineer\ncould -- conscious process, where they were actually calculating the capacity of the\ncars, the capacity of the killing, how quickly can we burn them. In other words, they\napplied scientific management. And that is really the grossness, the horror of this\nthing, which I called the -- the bureaucratization of Holocaust. In other words, the\nbureaucratization of genocide. And the point that I was raising was that with\nadvanced information technology, the state can, through control of people, and\neliminating privacy in the future, basically grind masses of people to destruction. In\nother words, endemic in the structure of modern civilization, of industrialization, 1s\na capability of massive destruction, by means out of anatomic weapons. Sybil\nMilton was very, very much taken by it. I then subsequently provided to the\nHolocaust Museum, a collection of documents which I assembled, my sister\nactually helped with it, which showed methodically how the various laws were used\nin Slovakia to gradually strip an innkeeper, who was a veteran from World War I,\nand who received special license to be an innkeeper and how that was taken away,\nand this was taken away and the fur coats was taken, and radio was taken, and so\non, until you finally got rid of the innkeeper altogether and then gassed him. And I\ngave a collection of something like 30 documents, where the wife actually got a\nreceipt for the husband. In other words, the bureaucracy worked with perfection and\ncompleteness and everything was legitimate and everything was signed and\neverything was covered by law. It was passed by a duly elected parliament. And\nthen, of course, Sybil said, yeah, but where do computers come into this thing? And\nI said, well I don\u2019t know, but when I look at this succession of how Mr. Flak got\neliminated, I can see a computerized society doing it much more efficiently, much\nmore expeditiously, without any errors. Sybil then went away. A month later Sybil\ncalls me up and say, I have something interesting for you. She sends to me in the\nmail, copies of three pages from some kind of German documentation, which shows\na punch card, and shows a picture of what\u2019s called a Hollerith, Deutsche Hollerith\nmachine, and says, could you tell me what it is? And -- and of course I said, surely,\nthis 1s -- this is a machine that is being used, using census data in order to make sure\nthat all the Jews and their property is properly filtered out so that you can schedule\nthe Jews to destruction. And she said, you know, we are building a -- a Holocaust\nMuseum, it\u2019s all crying and weeping, and what have you, but there\u2019s nothing in\nthere about this concept of the grindstone of the bureaucracy actually being an\nengine of the Holocaust. And she said, you know, it would be very interesting to be\nable to prove that the Germans actually used computers in tabulating mach -- she\ndidn\u2019t distinguish between tabulating machine and -- and I said, yeah, that would be\nvery interesting. I took the picture and send it to a friend of mine who 1s a retired\nIBM executive. She said, oh we tried it before, we asked IBM whether they had\nanything to do with providing tabulating machine to the Nazis, you know. I said,\nSybil, you must be kidding, you know. So I send it to this guy in Denver, he\u2019s\nretired, he looks at it, he says, oh, this is Dehomag number 325, you know. And\nyeah, the card says so and so Jew, and property and location and he\u2019s accounted for.\nSo Sybil says, you know what, we really would need this kind of thing on the\nexhibit in order to make the point. Could you get the Nazi machine? I said, you\nmust be kidding, you know, there\u2019s no such thing. Well, try anyway. So I sent out,\nbecause of my many connection -- you know, I am a collector, you know, you saw\nthat --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- I collect some stuff, you know that -- I love to go and look for things. And\nsomeday I\u2019m going to tell you some of the stuff that I was able to find. I mean,\nreally, I have a story behind each. See, I collected every item in here, I bought and\ncollected.",
        "Q: Yeah. And we should say that\u2019s the IBM museum of -- w-we should explain to\nthem, anyways.",
        "A: Yeah. Well -- well, the museum -- the --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- Xerox Historical Museum of the Written Word. Well at any rate, I sent out a --\na letter saying -- to all the computer museums in the world, and there are four, you\nknow, do you have a Dehomag number 302? Oh no, we haven\u2019t got it. I said, well,\nif you find wa -- one of them, we really need it for a museum, could you -- could\nyou let me know? Well, the Berlin wall falls, three weeks later I get a phone call\nfrom the British museum, the engineering museum in -- in London on -- on -- on --\non -- next to the Imperial Museum. And they said, you know, somebody\u2019s offered\nus for sale, in Dresden, a Dehomag 302. I said, fine, can we buy it? Well, you know,\nthey -- they just -- they -- they -- they really would like to sell it for 2,000 dollars. I\nsay, go buy it. Well, then I go to the Holocaust Museum, oh, you know, this -- we --\nhow do we know it\u2019s authentic, what is this and this? I said, 2,000 bucks guys, be\nreal. Then they had to send somebody to -- to Germany to look at the machine, they\ndidn\u2019t know anything about the machine, they come back, yeah, there is such a\nmachine. It -- actually the air ca -- air -- th-the expense for -- was more than the\nmachine. Well, finally they buy the machine. The machine is shipped to the\nwarehouse in Baltimore where all of this stuff was being staged prior to being -- to\ncompletion of the building. This is before the building was done. They invite me to\ncome to authenticate the machine, and of course my friend in Denver tells me what\nto look at, what serial number and all of those things. I go and look at -- it\u2019s a\ngorgeous machine, just gor -- you know, only the Germans can make this fine\nmachine parts. It was a tabulator, it was a sorter, it was an input machine, the whole\nthing, whole shooting thing. I said, you know, this is -- this 1s just a beautiful thing.\nWell, would you please write something? So I wrote a script for the -- for the -- for\nthe -- for the display unit, called the bureaucratization of genocide. Well, it didn't go\nover very well with the Holocaust Museum. They ultimately put the three machines\non the exhibit, but they were taking too much space, so last time I know, they\nremoved two of them. I find -- I have a real bad feeling about the Holocaust\nMuseum, I just want you to know. Many of the people who are the biggest donor to\nthe Holocaust Museums are Jews who are survivors, who came to the United States,\nmade lots of money and are heavily funding the museum. You know, this is -- this\nis their guilt trip. I -- you know.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Now I -- I may be overdoing it, but they really did not want to take it from the\nfact it\u2019s a crime to something that I see, it is something which has much broader\nconsequence for the future. And when you are telling kids about the Holocaust --\nwell they say, well Hitler was a bad guy. Well, when -- when do we gonna get\nanother Hitler? You know, it\u2019s all the Nazis and the Hitler.",
        "Q: Ah, but the mission is, you know, it\u2019s a government insti -- funded institution to\neducate.",
        "A: They don\u2019t educate, in my view, and I been to the Holocaust Museum twice, I\nspoke there. I look at -- I -- I ge -- I\u2019m on the mailing list and so forth, and I listen to\nElie Wiesel -- Elie Wiesel. The education in the information age is to beware of the\nabrogation of civil liberties, of the use of computers in the police system --",

        "Q: They want to keep, you feel, to the narrower.",
        "A: Yeah, they want to keep it as a feeling, well this is bad, this is bunch of bad\nguys, and all of those things. To me it is much more endemic. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s the -- the\nstate going mad, like in Pol Pot\u2019s time, I mean. Like under Mao.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Oh, which conceivably can happen to any society at any time.",
        "A: Can happen to any society, any time.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And that moral lesson is not visible. And you might as well tell your sponsors\nthat, that I said so. Had to get it off my chest.",
        "Q: You had something further to add.",
        "A: Yeah. There was no way -- ma -- this is my commentary on the tenor and the\nmorality of the Holocaust Museum, and the lessons to the history. And one of the\nvery significant lessons of bureaucratization of genocide is the extremely small staff\nthat Eichmann had in order to execute massive amount of people. Eichmann and his\npeople, in a typical German fashion, were methodical bureaucrats first. So when\nArons -- Ar-Arons says about the banality of -- of -- of -- of the crime, he -- she\nreally does not get into the analytic mech -- mechanism of how this 1s done. It was\ndone, and I\u2019ve studied it, in a very organized, methodical method which leveraged\nthe machinery of the state, of the police, of the [indecipherable] of the judicial\nsystem, to commit the crime. When you really look at it from a legal standpoint,\nthere was no crime. Duly elected --",

The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully\nacknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible. This is tape\nnumber four, side A. Nothing -- you\u2019re saying that nothing illegal --",
        "A: Well, the --",
        "Q: -- had occurred.",
        "A: -- the Holocaust, at least the way I witnessed it, with the evidence available to\nme, although there were exceptions, particularly in the conquered lands, where in\nRussia, in -- where there was no legality at all, it was -- th-that was just plunder and\nmur-murder and what have you. But I\u2019m talking about western Europe, so-called\ncivilized western Europe, which includes our good friends the French, and -- and --\nand the Belgians, and the Germans and particularly the Austrian and the Slovaks,\nand the Hungarians and the Romanian, etcetera, etcetera, all did that in a very\nmethodical, prescribed, legitimate method, which means that they could argue that\nthey were proceeding through the sovereign rights of the state to take measures\nwhich they considered necessary to defend their social and economic well being. By\nthe way, that argument has been made. Now, with that structure, and then\nharnessing the power of the state, they were then able to execute a crime in a very\nwell structured method, which took advantage of all the best managerial know-how,\nsuch as being taught in schools today, of management. In fact, people get MBAs in\nsubjects which are closely related to that, except they apply to cattle and apply to\nkrispies, and hamburgers and what have you. Now, the evidence for this thing really\nis in what\u2019s called a transaction cost. The transaction costs for executing this crime\nwere very low, because this was largely self funding. For instance, the Slovak paid\nthe Germans, as you know, 10 marks for every body for resettlement and\nreeducation fees. The confiscations were self funding. Eichmann actually produced\na profit and loss statement, because through the confiscation and so forth, they were\nable to get a large amount of gold into the coffers of their Reich system, although\nsooner or later the corruption crept in, but nevertheless, it was run as a business.\nThe business was based on the fact that a very small number of people at corporate\nheadquarters, with some enforcement, could take care of problems which involved\nthe marshalling and destruction of millions of people. And one of the key elements\nin that process was the utilization of the Jewish organizations in co-opting the\nJewish organizations into the liquidation process. The deportation lists from my\ntown, Trencin, that I used to trace the authenticity of who was a victim or not, were\nmade by the Jewish [indecipherable], by the Jewish organization. The supervision\nand the guidance of, you know, going to this car, and going to this car, was done\nmostly by Jews with the enforcers onlooking except when there were some\nhooligans who did some stupid things, you know, like beat up people and so forth.\nBut most of it was done in a fairly organized fashion. So now comes the Holocaust\nMuseum, and you have a list of Holocaust survivors. And then you have a list of\nHolocaust survivor donors. And then you have interviews with these donors who\nare being awarded this or that, and being treated to this or that dinner. And then you\nhave the Los Angeles chapter, and then you have the New York chapter, etcetera,\netcetera. Well, these people get up and make a speech and they say how they\nsuffered in Auschwitz, and in what have you. Now it turns out that none of them\never give away when they went to Auschwitz. None of them. They never do. This is\none thing -- by the -- in many of my inquiries, and I will tell you some stories also\nhow this [indecipherable] -- many of these people, by innuendo and implication esp\n-- espe -- especially as to the date of the way, how the destruction was done, are\nclearly 1942 inmates. Now please tell me --",
        "Q: Oh, because based on putting together information from what they\u2019ve said?",
        "A: Yes. Please tell me how can anybody survive Auschwitz from \u201942 to --",
        "Q: Liberation.",
        "A: -- the spring -- to liberation, which is early spring of 1945, without being a kapo?\nSo the money they\u2019re giving is guilt money, it\u2019s tainted money, it\u2019s immoral money,\nit\u2019s bad money. And they influence the -- the tenor of what I see -- I haven\u2019t been to\nthe Holocaust Museum now for about seven years, maybe they changed the\nexhibits. But it is -- the morality, you see, the morality of that thing, which is really\nthe underlying issue and the guidance for people to think about the future is not\nobvious, or not apparent. It\u2019s not even discussed. Now, the morality of course, is in\nYad Vashem, where they have the Righteous, and th-that\u2019s a different thing. But to\nme the Holocaust Museum is --",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s also part of the story told at the Holocaust Museum, is the\nRighteous.",

        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: -- individual -- you see -- see -- see --",
        "Q: I do see.",
        "A: You see, that gets you into individual psychology of individual people. When\nyou are going to teach about the Holocaust, children, and if you\u2019re looking into the\ninformation society of the 21%\u2018 and 22 century -- you know, those museum has\nways of staying around for a long time.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Something that 1s the guts of the issue, in terms of relevance to the future is not\nthere.",
        "Q: Right. And -- and of course, all the time, life goes on and other events take place,\nsuch as the Bosnian war, which also comes under the --",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yes, absolutely.",
        "Q: -- teaching message of the Holocaust Museum",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right, e-except the Bosnian war 1s really not analyzed in terms\nof -- in my terms of reference. It was again the state machinery -- in this particular\ncase the military machinery, which is the most dangerous machinery. See, the\nGermans were much more refined, they never used the military for this purpose.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I mean, the Bosnians and the Serbs --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- were just very crude. I mean, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- you -- you know, that\u2019s\nvery crude. Now --",
        "Q: Yes, I see the distinction.",
        "A: And -- and those are very important, you see, the taxonomy of genocide varies.\nYou have a Mao Tse-Tung, very sophisticated, harnessing the young pioneers to\nengage in genocide, but actually mobilizing a section of the communist party to\nexecute. Then you have Pol Pot, okay? Then you have the very interesting situation\nin Indonesia. There is a whole taxonomy of different forms. There is a life form out\nthere called genocide, that has a set of indicators which should be used as an way of\nalerting society, so that society can distinguish it. See, one of -- part of the problem\nwith the genocide was that the society in \u201938 - \u00b039 did not discriminate, did not\ndistinguish it, and the Jewish organizations were used as way of distorting and not\nclarifying what was really happening. We knew, for instance, what Auschwitz was,\nwhat [indecipherable]. The Jewish -- we had two people come from Auschwitz, and",
        "Q: To your --",
        "A: To Slovakia.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah. So that was known at the end of 1943. Had that been known and broadcast\nby the Jewish community, more Jews would have taken a different view. They\ndidn\u2019t. The thing was hushed up.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Don\u2019t rock the boat. Keep low. You might offend somebody. So, you know, if\nyou really want to listen to Paul Strassmann, my lesson for the Holocaust, I mean,\nthere\u2019s a whole different story to be told, in terms of its real events, to the Holocaust\nMuseum.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But I\u2019m not sure they want to hear it.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Well, we\u2019ve -- this is a small way of making sure the story 1s there.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: In their -- in the archives.",
        "A: Yeah. The whole taxonomy, structure and dynamics of the Holocaust has to deal\nwith going back to options. I-I wrote a paper and gave a series of lectures which\nwere very 0 -- people were very unhappy about it. I pointed out that in 1944, the\nprobability of surviving the eight month remaining for the remainder of the war,\nmuch greater if you fought than if you went to the concentration camp. In other\nwords, there were two work camps in Slovakia, one in Sered, one in Novaky. The\none in Novaky marched a battalion with a survival rate of 70 percent. Sered was\ndone -- run by religious Jews. Well, maybe we\u2019ll negotiate our way, maybe it\u2019s not\nthere, maybe we don\u2019t go on this transfer, maybe we\u2019ll go to the next transfer.\nAlways bargaining. See, you were bargaining, see the -- you were bargaining with\nevil.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: The bargaining with evil. There comes a point where you don\u2019t bargain with\nevil, you see, because you are out of choices. Because the evil will not give you any\nchoices. And so the probability, the morbidity rate of those was 95 percent. So you\nknow, you\u2019re now dealing with statistics and with odds, and with orientation. You\nknow, you had six million Jews with lots of money in 1938, let\u2019s go and take a hike.\nYou know, we could have gone to Madagascar. We could have gone to all kinds of\nother places. Again, I am talking about the survival rates.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Well, it\u2019s very interesting. And --",

The -- the -\n- he married a woman from a family that -- that had lots of aunts. Oh, it was a huge,\nhuge family.

        "Q: Mm-hm.",

        "Q: And did he ever speak about -- with regret about not going, or -- ju -- I\u2019d just like\nto know more about that.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. But have you put yourself in your father\u2019s shoes, and it does seem to\nme that the reason he chose not to leave with his immediate family was because of\nthat responsibility to the extended family --",
        "Q: Did your parents ever regret this, do you think? Or was it an unspoken regret, if\nthat was there.",
        "Q: Mm. And I assume that this would be what would happen in so many families\nwhere it would be possible for some members to leave, but it\u2019s very hard to leave\nclose relatives behind.",
        "Q: Why do you think that was so? Is that human nature?",

As an observer it\nwould seem to me that -- that start that you had 1n life, of security and a -- and an\nextended family, a really stable, good background would give you reserves, sort of",

        "Q: And that would be th -- the money was going to someone, it was essentially a\nbribe?",

        "Q: Tell me -- explain the -- explain what a Liberty ship was, and then I also want to\nknow who else was on board.",
        "Q: Oh yes. What was in the suitcase was an -- a small accordion. In fact, my -- the\nfirst money I ever made was playing accordion and I actually arrived in the United\nStates with 20 dollars that I made on the ship. The -- most of the people on the ship\nwere a bunch of hippies. I mean, there was no -- not too many immigrants -- or\nemigrants from Europe, you know, because the visas were very hard to get,\nparticularly immigration. But starting in \u201946 and \u00b047, lots of American college kids\nused to just go to Europe to -- just to see Europe, for whatever reasons. And that\nwas the cheapest way how to get back. And many of them subsequently became\nquite famous. For instance, on the ship was Leonard Rose, who subsequently\nbecame a very famous cellist. But th -- it was mostly a student and young kind of\nadventure, non-conformist young people who used that as the cheapest way to get\nback to the United States.",

        "Q: Mm-hm. Clever management. Do you have any -- I mean, did you have any long\nterm health problems that resulted from your hardships during World War II?",

        "Answer: Good morning, this is Paul Strassmann. I-I\u2019m being interviewed by\nMargaret West in my home in New Canaan, Connecticut on January 8\", 2004. I am\nPaul Strassman who was born in Trencin, January 24, 1929.",
        "A: The earliest that I remember of my childhood was the -- the rituals of the family\nthat revolved around Jewish holidays. The peak holiday was, of course, always\nPesach, Passover, and it was big fuss, the dishes had to be changed. And lots of\ncooking took place. I always ran errands for my mother, helping her out. And I\nremember, perhaps as early as at the age of four or five, I learned how to pull the\ndough to make a streudel-thin dough. These are all trivial examples of what I\nremember.",
        "A: The Jewish community in Trencin consisted of about 2,000 souls out of a\npopulation of about 19,000, so it was a very large Jewish community. The Jewish\ncommunity was centered around the school, which was a parochial school, and the\nsynagogue. The -- the -- so far as I can remember, my grandfather always took me\nto prayers on Saturday morning. There was regulated holidays that had to be kept,\nand my mother maintained originally, during the 30\u2019s, before the trouble started,\nshe maintained a kosher home. It was a -- a Jewish religious procedure that didn\u2019t\nmake much sense to me. What particularly didn't make sense to me 1s that all the\npraying was done in ancient Hebrew, and I didn\u2019t understand a word of it. They\nnever tried to teach us what all of this mumbo-jumbo meant. As a matter of fact, my\nfather, although he was one of the leading lights of the community, was known to\nbe highly critical of the local rabbi for never speaking Slovak, or even German that\npeople could understand. So there was this peculiar dichotomy, on the one hand of a\nvery formal, ritualized religious experience and a gradual rebellion against the --\nwhich was largely engendered by the time I was about seven, by my association\nwith the local Zionist organization, co -- Hashomer Hatzair, which was a leftist\norganization, who was, at least mildly speaking, anti-religious, socialist,\ncommunalist, and totally rejecting the existence in the -- in the -- 1n the -- in the --\nin the Slovak environment and totally focused on everybody getting out and moving\nto Palestine, and to live in a kibbutz in a communal Utopian environment. And as\ntime went on, this influence became stronger and stronger, because that was a\ncommunity that made lots of sense. The songs were very good. The -- the s-singing\nin the synagogue was always wailing. The -- the -- the singing in the Hashomer\nHatzair was very zippy. Subsequently I found out that much of the communist\nsinging was actually stolen from the Zionists, and -- but the songs were very strong.\nI always said, years later, that the communists and the leftists always had the best\nsongs and the ugliest girls. But the songs were great, and the entertainment was\ngreat, and there was a great deal of hiking, and -- and sort of rebellion organization -\n- r-rebellions -- rebellious thinking against the environment that was closing in on\nus, already starting in \u00b036.",
        "A: Well, I wouldn\u2019t say so. My grandfather, the religious grandfather highly\ndisapproved of it, but my sister, Ella already was part of this religious and -- anti-\nreligious attitude, and she had joined Hashomer Hatzair before me, so she sort of\ndragged me in. And also, one of the teachers in the Jewish school was a -- a rebel.\nHe turned out to be, subsequently, the editor of the Pravda newspaper, and of\ncourse, they shot him afterwards in the anti -- anti-Communist purges. But -- so\nthere was a very lively environment going on, a tremendous amount of change, and\na great deal of debates about the future and ideas. So I was exposed to ideas like\nthat very early in my childhood.",
        "A: My sister Ella was born in 1925, so she was four -- almost four and a half 0 --\nyears older than me, and I\u2019ve been always very, very close to her.",
        "A: Her full name is Ella Fabian. And she married a -- a -- just about the only\neligible Jewish boy who was left in Trencin after the Holocaust. He survived being\nput behind a false brick wall, and two bricks were removed from time to time to\nfeed him and take the soil out. And he never regained his health, but she married\nhim anyway, and they have two beautiful children. They are both medical doctors\nand I visit them quite often.",
        "A: Well, my maternal grandmother is a lady of particular distinction that I talk\nabout very much. She was the local marriage broker. Did I ever tell the story about\nhere?",
        "A: Oh, Grandmother Emma was really something very special. She was married to\nmy maternal grandfather, Alexander Weiner, who was a master cabinetmaker. It\nwas apparently a deep love because during the first World War, when he went to\nwar, and no, he didn\u2019t write for a couple of years, everybody thought that he died,\nand she got very, very sick. At any rate, meanwhile she made a living by having a\nvery small store selling embroidery. And this was embroidery patterns. So when the\nlittle girls had to come in to start working on their trousseau, they had to come to\nEmma\u2019s little shop and she imprinted on their pieces of linen, patterns. And 1n those\ndays, my mother tells me, the girls had to start working on their trousseau at the age\nof five. I mean -- I mean, if you didn\u2019t get married by the time you were 19, you\nwere really just not marriageable, or wa -- there was something wrong with you. At\nany rate, the girls started working on a trousseau, and because the girls had to come\nin and do very complex embroidery, my grandmother could tell how intelligent the\ngirl was, and how industrious she was, which was two criteria, basically, for\nrecommending somebody. So my maternal grandmother, Emma, apparently was\nknown very widely in the whole community as absolutely reliable I.Q. testing that -\n- that never made a mistake. And so she made a living, b-both as a marriage broker,\nas well as a -- as a Seller of embroidery.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes. Marriage brokers were paid, and of course the other thing was\nthat my grandfather Weiner made -- was known for making chests which were\ninlain -- inlaid -- h-he did very fine cabinetry. This was inlaid wood veneer. And so,\nusually somebody who was a little wealthier, at the age of six or seven, they were\nstarting to get on the queue with my grandfather Alexander, to start making a chest.\nWell, Grandfather Weiner liked to drink, and so the delivery on these chests was\nalways uncertain. But he was a fun guy. He was always singing, he -- he -- he was\nreally -- Grandfather Weiner took m-more c-care of me than anybody else in the\nfamily, because he had the time. And I was then apprenticed to him at the age of 11,\nand he taught me how to do inlaid veneer. So I worked for him for awhile. So it was\na very colorful kind of an experience.",
        "A: Well, yes and no. My father was a very tense person. And -- and there was\nalways a question -- course, I was -- I was a -- a child that caused trouble. I-I was\nknown as the troublemaker. I-I had a reputation as being a particularly rebellious\nchild. And years later some people tell me about kind of the pranks that I used to\npull, and my father was a very stern task maker, and I just had to tow the line and\nvery often I didn\u2019t. But the rebellion was there to begin with. My mother was a very\nloving woman, but she was really the brains behind the business, we ran a big\nbusiness, my father had a big business. She was the cashier. She was the\npeacemaker am-among the employees. She was very charitable. She was actually\nthe head of the WIZO, which was the women\u2019s Zionist organization, in Trencin.\nEverybody loved her, a-although there were some women who wore a grudge\nagainst her because she stole the best man in town. And 1 -- years later, a woman\nwho survived told me that she could have been my mother. She was a -- she had her\neye on -- on my father, except for that conniving matchmaker, your grandmother.\nSo that\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- these are the kinds of stories that one -- I remember.",
        "A: Where does the rebelliousness come from, I don\u2019t know. I was not considered to\nbe a bright child. I was not considered to be one of the leading scholars. I mean,\nthere were kids who were -- had better grades than I did. I was always looking at\nthings. I-I must say that one of the memories that I have was that in the third grade -\n- so I must have been eight years old, maybe less, I became very interested in\ncondoms, which was a no-no thing in those days. I mean, that was totally out of --\nout of bound for everybody. And I did not know exactly what it was, but I was told\nthis is really hush-hush. Well, what happened is that through some arrangements, I\ngot hold of a pack and brought them to school. Now, that was considered to be -- I\nwas badly beaten up. You know -- in those days, you know, the kids got physical\npunishment. I had to stretch my hands, and I got caned over my hands. Now why I\ndid it, I don\u2019t know, but it should have sort of -- you know, I got a kick out of it.\nParticularly the -- the teacher, who was caning me, was an idiot. And he didn't hear\nwell, he didn\u2019t speak well, didn\u2019t see well. He was in his last year before retirement,\nand I think I just had to get at him one way or another. So -- so, discipline was\nalways a problem with -- with me, including some really bad st-stunts that I pulled\non girls, but it\u2019s -- it\u2019s history.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, the maternal grandfather was Alexander Weiner, my mother\u2019s -- she was\nborn Weiner, Frances Weiner. Her -- Alexander\u2019s wife was Emma wa -- she died\nquite early, in the 30\u2019s. And -- and they really mer -- wro -- ma -- had a major\nimprint on -- on -- on my sensibility and understanding and -- and -- and -- and care.\nBy the way, I just want you to know 1-is that Grandfather Weiner was a diabetic,\nwhich mean he had to eat early, and he -- he had to eat more frequently than\nanybody else. He made a mean garlic soup. I mean, really strong garlic soup. To\nthis day, a garlic soup, to me, is the best soup you can eat. And my whole family is\nstill kidding me about the fact that I will eat anything as long as it has garlic. But\nit\u2019s in memory of my grandfather.",
        "A: And your paternal grandparents?",
        "A: I recognize some of his pieces in the homes of the Gentiles that I visited after the\nwar. They vehemently desi -- [coughs] deny -- let me stop. [tape break]. You -- your\nquestion was about precious possessions. One of the things that I learned from the\nHolocaust is never to care for precious possessions. I can walk away from this\nhouse any time.",
        "A: Yeah, what I learned from the experience is that the ability to walk away from\nsomething is very important, it\u2019s [indecipherable] survival. If there is a major lesson\nI\u2019ve learned from the Holocaust, it is my ability to just, when I see a problem,\nsomething going wrong, I just walk. And -- and I would say that is a characteristic\nwhich is something very deeply ingrained in my behavior. And if there is a single\npattern that describes what I learned from the Holocaust, is that ability to walk\naway.",
        "A: Property, yeah. We had a heri -- heritage property. I could have inhe -- I --\npresumably I was inheriting lots of land, houses. My decision to walk was much\nearlier than when people were forced out by the communists. I -- although many of\nthe Jews who came back, they were spending their time reclaiming properties and\ngoing to court, and going through recovery and reclamation and restitution and all\nof this thing, I wanted no part of it. I didn\u2019t -- never touched it in my years there. I\nbasically felt that the -- the country was poisoned. The people that I saw on the\nstreets when I walked, were -- were the people who were killing and stealing and\nrobbing and -- and -- and committing crimes, including the people who gradually\ncame to the forefront 1n a political position. These are people I knew from the\nuprising as criminals. You know, I said, I just don\u2019t want to live in this country. Just\ndon\u2019t want to be there, regardless. So I told my sister, you take everything is here --\nby the way, I never took a penny out of that place. Never took a penny, I\u2019ve never\nclaimed anything. I was never paid or made any claims to the Germans, although all\nthe other Jews did. Never wanted to touch it, that was tainted stuff. So this is -- this\nis a very important characteristic of my experience that -- that I did not cling -- I do\nnot cling to things which are basically, in my view, morally evil. When you see\nanything that\u2019s morally evil, wrong, you don\u2019t stick around. And -- and that is really\nthe reason why, starting in 1946, the idea was, I\u2019m not going to stick around, I\u2019m\njust going to go wherever I can. Of course, the idea was to go to America, where\nthere was unlimited opportunity and nobody knew me.",
        "A: Well, the big moment, the big moment in my life, you know, in -- in other\nwords, in -- when you look at life, there are only few things which are so called, a\nfulcrum. And this is when you roll your dice, and if you don\u2019t roll the dice right,\nyou die. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- or -- or perish, or whatever. When the -\n- when the uprising took place and -- and the Germans started persecuting Jews and\npartisans and arresting people, we went to predetermined houses where we wo --\nyou know, hide and we -- the Christians are going to keep us hidden and we were\ngoing to crawl into the attic, or crawl into a closet or -- or whatever. And, you\nknow, these experiences, everybody has a different experience about what they did.\nI went to the house, which you may or may not recall from my interview, to the\nhouse of an employee who was a very trusted interview -- employee of -- of my\nfather\u2019s. A long employee who owed very much to my father. His wife was very\nunhappy, his wi -- by the way, the marriage was a bad marriage to begin with. And\nshe was grousing about, y-you -- you know, the Germans coming, finding me there\nand shooting the whole family because they to -- that is what the Germans were\nadvertising, anybody hiding a Jew is going to be executed. So I -- I was told to just\ngo out to the -- near the river, and sit there during the day, when presumably the\nGermans were going to do house to house searches and then come back at night and\nthey\u2019re going to feed me. And the big decision, this is one of these fulcrum\ndecisions which sort of imprinted me on my whole model, walking away. When I\nsat at the river, I said, I\u2019m not going to go back. I\u2019m rather going to go take my\nchances where the shooting was than go back to what is presumably a safe house.\nSame thing happened in \u00b048 -- or \u201946, you know, I could have stayed there, but this\nidea of walking was by that time very heavily imprinted in me. Also, th-that my\nbehavior in -- in the partisans was very much -- a-as you know, during the partisan\nwarfare, there\u2019s always a little cottage where you can go to and some peasants will\nhide you or keep you for the night, so instead you being outside in the frost, you\u2019re\ngoing to come into the village and stay there and get fed. Well, lots of partisans lost\ntheir life that way. I just didn\u2019t do that. There was always a bunch of guys who say,\nwell, it\u2019s just too dangerous. So this idea of not necessarily staying comfortable, but\ndoing the contrary thing is something which is not just Paul Strassmann, this 1s\nsomething, when you look at history of Jews -- I\u2019m just finished reading for the\nsecond time Paul Johnson\u2019s history of th -- of Jews. You know, when you say, well\nhow did the Jews survive for, you know, whatever thousand years it was, you know,\nhow did they move from -- from Sumer to Egypt to Canaan to Assyria to Babylon\nand back and forth. And then went to Persia, then went to -- to -- to -- to Damascus\nand to Anatolia. Th-The -- the wandering Jew. Well, the survival of the Jews was\none that they always were ready to move. They would have stayed put, they would\nhave died and perished like everybody else who stayed put. So this is not just a Paul\nStrassmann kind of an imprint, it\u2019s just deeply -- now whether it\u2019s genetic, I doubt,\nbut it is, what do you call it, r-racial, or religious or psychological orientation. It\u2019s\nsomething that -- that very much has been a pattern of everything I\u2019ve done and\nhow I\u2019ve progressed in the United States.\nnine lives. You were young, you were taking risks, but it\u2019s an interesting to -- way\nto -- to look at it, that it was in your blood, that it\u2019s part of the -- part of your\nheritage. And there does seem to be moral overtones, that rather than hiding, you\nwere taking an active role that might make things better.",
        "A: Yeah, in fact my son that I lost was very much interested in the subject, and --\nand he was a brilliant, brilliant scholar at Harvard. And he always wanted to know,\nyou know, what -- what makes it tick? You know? Give me an equation, you know,\ngive -- give me something quantitative. Because you know, I always do things\nquantitatively. And I said, well, a-as you know, in -- in games theory and in\nmathematics, and in gaming, there are things called algorithms, okay? And so he\nwanted to know, what\u2019s the algorithm. And anythi -- in conversation with my son,\nthen I said, you know, the -- the -- the algorithm in life is that you always want to\nmigrate to where your number of options that you have, increase. So the algorithm\nis that if you are somewhere 1n what\u2019s called a mathematical sack, cul-de-sac,\nyou\u2019re down to one option. And so in gaming theory -- this is called option theory,\nby the way, and by the way Van Neumann did a formal analysis of this\n[indecipherable] so -- so there\u2019s a mathematical basis for it. In gaming theory you\nhave to look always for space, for more options, even if 1t costs you more, because\nonce you have more options, even if the price is higher, the probability of you\npossibly doing better is greater than if you are what\u2019s called, in a zero sum game.\nCul-de-sac, it\u2019s called -- in -- in mathematics, by the way, this is called a knapsack.\nI mean, there is formal theory over this thing. And my -- my second son Steven,\nwho has a Ph.D. from M.I.T., he -- he -- he\u2019s a -- he\u2019s acclass one nerd, you know,\nmathematics, everything has to be quantitative. You know, one day I just on a\nnapkin, drew for him this whole theory of life, that life is really of maximizing your\noptions. That\u2019s what life is. In fact, when you look at the --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: According to this theory of option, 1t means that if you stay hidden in a house of\nan employee whose wife is sort of a hostile party to this whole deal, you are\nbasically cooped up and there\u2019s no options. I mean, you are just totally wedged in,\nand you have no place to go. When you are just in shorts, and with a t-shirt and\nsandals, and one sandwich, in the reeds of the river Vah, and going back two miles\nis that house, or going forward, actually swimming down the river and then going to\nthe mountains where shooting takes place, that\u2019s more options. So you go.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Well, about that wife I knew very little, except that the a -- other employees were\n-- were always joshing this man, who was my father\u2019s confidant, about this wife\nthat he picked up. And I picked up enough sort of, innuendo, to -- that my -- my --\nmy radar said, well there\u2019s something f-funny in here. Y- You must understand, in\nthe back of my father\u2019s store were, you know, were the merchandise and were the --\nwe loaded cars. There was lots of rough play and -- and -- and -- among the\nemployees and of course I always mixed around and listened. And I picked up that\nthis was one unhappy, henpecked husband. So -- so, you know, but yo-you just\nfactor that in -- into the equation. The fact that they didn\u2019t want me to stay inside\nthe house, and you know, this was only the second day. I was there only one night.\nOn the second day, get out, you know, was enough of a signal that I would have no\noptions at all because when the Germans really started looking for people and doing\nhouse to house searches, I would have no place to go.",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: Well, the tragedy was -- is that the -- my father greatly mistimed the whole issue\nof how we will survive. Ye -- we received, in 1942 at the end -- towards the end of\nthe deportation, a presidential exception, which also covered the grandparents.\nGrandfather Weiner was sent to concentration camp, but it was the Slovak\nconcentration camp. The Slovaks kept some of the carpenters, and some of the\nJewish craftsman to make furniture and artifacts for the Slovak new powers. So they\nkept a camp where the Jews were slave laborers, but they did -- were not shipped to\n-- to -- to annihilation camps. So Grandfather Alexander was in a place called\nNovaky. We were in Trencin. My father, because of his prior connection with a\nvery distinguished Catholic priest, by name of Bernetsky, really an outstanding\nfriend of my father, secured a presidential protection, so that we were not deported\nin 1942. But we always knew that the day of reckoning will come when the front\nmoves in from the east, and the Germans retreat. At that time, there will be\nwholesale destruction and annihilation and murder and who knows what happens.\nAnd so, starting in \u201943, we started rehearsing where do we go, where do we hide\nwhen the front moves. My father had set up a hiding place, and then a fall-back\nhiding place and a third place. In other words, there were like three places to go to.\nWhen the -- the beginning of the uprising, but it was not so full born yet, but when\nthe guerilla attacks started -- it was precipitated, by the way, by the -- by the\ncommunists, for reasons which -- that\u2019s another story. We decided to go to back-up\nplace number one, which was in a town called Selec, which is not too far from --\nfrom Trencin, in the mountains. Was a small peasant village, there was peasant who\nwas for money and my father already provided food and what have you, we\u2019re\ngoing to go there. Well, when my father decided to -- to go to Selec, well then, there\nwere other people who my father was obligated to. My father inherited from his\npartner, who I may or may not have mentioned, by name of Kubicek. Kubicek went\nto the Zionist congress in Basel in 1938 and never came back. My father took over\ncustody of his wife and his son. So -- and there were two aunts, so my father took a\ntruck from the business, loaded everybody and in we go into Selec to hide. Of\ncourse, the whole village saw that here comes a whole bunch of Jews, you know. It\nwas just not well thought out. So we were there for two days, which was, I think\nAugust 27 and 28 and my father recognized this was really -- 1t was just too noisy,\nthere were just too many people. And everybody was in the same place. So the\ndecision was to go back to Trencin and regroup and start going into places where\neverybody will go in onesies or twosies --",
        "A: -- to hiding places. Well, that night Gestapo came and took my father as a\nhostage, and my grandfather Weiner. And just happens that that night I was not\nsleeping at home. Of course, we were, by that time, living in very, very low, low --\nlow kinds of housing, you know, housing that was very, very low grade. You know,\nit was out in the boonies. I think we had only one bedroom and one living room, so\nit was crowded anyway, so I stayed with a friend. So in the morning I was told the\nfamily was taken, my father was taken, and therefore I should go now to\ncontingency place number three, which was the -- this employee, so -- so within\nthree days, we went from contingency one to contingency two, to cont-contingency\nthree like this. And these -- so you were at the end of the rope by that time. And it\nwas still now only September one or September two, 1944. So you were out of an --\na-- arope, you\u2019re at the end of the rope now, already, and the -- you know, the\nshow only started, I mean the -- the bad times only started now. So that th -- was the\ncontext under which I said, this is a bad option. I mean, I have no place to go.",
        "A: 15. Iwas 15. I was a sturdy 15. Really experienced hiker. Because I couldn\u2019t go\nto school at the age of 11, my father apprenticed me to my grandfather. When my\ngrandfather was shipped to the labor camp, I was then apprenticed to work in a\nmachine shop, which was a wonderful experience. And in the machine shop we\nwere fixing threshing machines. And 1 -- the -- in -- in those days they didn\u2019t have\nball bearings, so they had bushings made out of copper, and when they didn\u2019t oil it\nproperly the copper melted, so you had to re -- ream the bushings, and I learned\npouring, holding the mold when people were pouring metal to make a bushing and\nthen reaming it out and fitting axels into it. I -- the people in the machine shop were\na bunch of real tough guys, including one guy who was wounded in the Spanish\nCivil War, in a communist brigade. Was a rough guy, and who subsequently\nbecame the commissar of one of the battalions and was guilty of enormous\natrocities. And after the war he became the deputy chairman of the communist\nparty. And he was one of the guys why I decided, with that guy around, I -- I don\u2019t\nwant to live in this town.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: And of course the town I come from used to be a garrison all the way going back\nto Roman times. Trencin was the last mountains -- mountain pass from the\nCarpathian mountains into the D-Danube [indecipherable] and the Romans were --\nhad their advance camp in there and on the castle, I will show the picture if you\u2019re\ninterested in. It was a huge, medieval castle. And we used to, you know, at -- at -- at\nseven years old our favorite game was to go into the castle and play cops and\nrobbers and Crusaders and particularly figuring out how to defeat the Turks,\nbecause the Turks used to come to Trencin and devastate the population, so -- so,\nyou know, th-that environment was already that kind of a mental process. This was\nnot a mamby-pamby kind of a protected environment.",

But we\nalways knew -- you know, my father\u2019s ideal life -- I mean, he alway -- was to move\nout of Slovakia -- Czechoslovakia, move to England, put his son into an English\nschool, and live in a setting like I live in right now. A garden and privacy and\nquietness. And th-that was his idea. My father\u2019s idea of life was to live like an\nEnglish gentleman, reading books and -- and -- and writing, and -- and -- and -- and\n-- and not -- not having to deal with this tremendous pressure, this enormous social\npressure which existed in that place.\nthis former employee. I -- I mean that y-you were the only son, he seems in so many\nways to have --",

        "A: -- was a childhood friend, and we -- we were quite friendly with him. He was\nhalf Jewish. And th-the reason I stayed there was that, you know, it was just I s -- I\nused to sleep around with friends, you know, we visiting back and forth, and it was\nlate, there was curfew already and they said, well, why don\u2019t you stay there.",

        "A: -- just luck.",
        "A: Well, in some respect it was a sense of betrayal, because I did not know -- see,\nnobody ever told me what the plan was. I did not have any money. I did not know\nwhat the financial arrangements were. See, part of the problem was that I was a big\nblabber. And my father really didn\u2019t share too many things with me. So -- you see,\nthe assumption was always that dad will take care of everybody. This idea that I, at\nthe age of 15 would be independent, and have to make decisions on my own, I don\u2019t\nthink that was on the agenda. See, the assumption always was, the father of the\nfamily will sort of direct everybody and decide who goes where. And so part of this\nexperience was that here I was with no clothing, just wol -- told, why don\u2019t you go\nto this house. No -- there was no question of money, what the arrangements were,\nnothing. I didn\u2019t know what the deal was. I did not know where it leads, what was\nthe further fall back, nothing. So not knowing anything, I finally decided, well, you\nknow, you either sit here, go back and do what everybody else was doing, or just\nget -- get on with something. And I guess that was the -- the -- the decisive moment,\nbecause had I stayed, I would have been -- sure ended up in a concentration camp.\nThey -- they would have surely found me and shipped me off.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It was quite rare, it was quite rare. It was quite rare, yeah, it -- 1t -- it was. It was\n-- well, you know, I can give you the numbers, you know the numbers are that --\nthat there were 83,000 Jews in Slovakia, 64,000 were shipped to annihilation camp\nwith nobody coming ever back. Of those who left, which was like 18,000, a\nnumber, maybe 4,000 went into slave labor camps to -- to work for the locals. Then\nwhoever was left [sneezes] -- excuse me -- either got false papers or sort of\ndisappeared, or got legitimacy, and of -- got -- got papers, so-called white papers,\nand [indecipherable] and it -- it was a big deal.

        "A: Bernetsky was untouchable. He is considered today a sort of, you know, the\ntown square is named after him, a-a-and he -- he was close with Tiso, who was the\npresident. The president of Slovakia could write an exception, you know, under his\nsignature. For my father and the family to be protected required the signature of the\npresident of Slovakia.",
        "A: Well, there was a few wrinkles with this thing. We had to get baptized, and the\nquestion was, well what\u2019s the faster ways of getting baptized? Well, to become\nbaptized as a Catholic -- and Bernetsky offered that, was a very complicated thing,\nand you know, the timing was short. My father was very good friends also --\nbecause my father was one of the leading citizens in town, with the senior -- the --\nwhich he\u2019s a sort of a -- like a auxiliary bishop, by name of Zimon, a wonderful\nscholar of the Lutheran church. And so in 1942, after a proper course in catechism\nand so forth -- which I did very well, by the way. Frankly, I liked the catechism\nbetter than I liked the Jewish stuff because I could understand it, you know, it was\nin Slovak and it was sort of interesting, historically. And -- you know, and Jesus\nwas a Jew, so it must have been okay. And also, the beautiful thing about the -- the\nLutherans is th-the organ music. You see, the Jews didn\u2019t have music in the\nsynagogue, only wailing, you know, the -- no music. The -- the Lutheran church had\na wonderful organ and then in the chapel they had a harmonium, which I used to\nlike to play on. But, you know, the -- the -- the s -- the psalms, you know, mostly\nold -- this -- this was Lutheran of the Augsburg persuasion. I don\u2019t know you\nunderstand the -- Lutherans -- Lutherans come in various flavors, you understand\nthat? Okay. There was lots of Old Testament songs, which have been -- which have\nbeen -- which are sung, according to music [indecipherable] by Johann Sebastian\nBach. And they\u2019re beautiful, they\u2019re absolutely beautiful. So I had a great time with\nthe Lutherans. Everybody knew, of course, that I was a baptized Jew. I mean, y-you\nknow, in this little town, everybody could tell that. But 1 -- you know, it was just --\njust wonderful.",
        "A: Yeah, and a -- a -- yeah, we -- we were not hiding anything, there was no way of\nhiding it. I mean, everybody knew who s -- Adolf Strassman, my father was and\nwho I am, but -- but 1-it was a convenient way, and the Lutherans who were a\nminority in the town sort of felt that they were -- and the Lutherans never went in\nwith this Nazi stuff anyway. I mean, in the ar -- in the underground, much of the\npro-western connection -- 1 -- yi -- as you know there was a London underground\nand there was a Soviet underground. The -- the Soviet underground was a bunch of\natheists and -- and -- and quasi-criminal element. The intellectual underground in\nLondon was mostly Lutheran. And I turned out to be quite a scholar in -- in\nLutheran affairs, and of course I went, you know, the catechism, answered all the\nquestions and -- and -- and -- you know, I -- I did just fine. I enjoyed it. So -- so yi -\n- y -- sort of everybody went along with this thing. It was a very interesting period.",
        "A: I have only warmest memories on -- on that period. I mean, in -- in the period of\nthe war, which is 1942 to 1944, it provided a period of relative stability.",

I don\u2019t believe that, but -- but 1f she was or she wasn\u2019t, a -- I mean,\nthere -- there was no point of hiding it, if -- I mean, these are small circumstances,\nsmall town. Now she u -- if she came from a big town like Prague, and I don\u2019t know\nof the detail, it\u2019s possible that the thing was sort of expunged, but in a small town\nthere was no way of forgetting who was a Jew, and who wasn\u2019t a Jew.",

        "A: Yeah, I -- I -- I -- I --I -- I\u2019m sure of that and you know, that the conditions were\ndifferent in Bulgaria. For instance, I -- I happened to be presiding last year at the\nBulgarian memorial, and it was very interesting for me, th-that was a totally\ndifferent approach of solving the situation. The -- the -- you know, ge-getting a\npresidential except -- exception, the white paper, and by saying, well yeah, but that\nyou also converted to Christianity, you know, that was another check mark and that\nwas Okay. At least in \u201942 it was -- you know, in September of 1944, all the bets\nwere off, I mean, none of that applied.",

        "A: No, th-the Germans did not occupy Czechoslovakia. The Germans occupied only\nthe Czech Republic and they created what\u2019s called the Protectorat. They did not\noccupy Slovakia. They made a deal with Monsignor Tiso to create a Slovak state,\nbecause they just had their hands full, and th-they wanted to draw on the military\ncapability of Slovakia, which was quite considerable. Slovakia ultimately put up\n92,000 soldiers working for the Germans, fighting with the Germans against the\nSoviets. So the Slovak, two divisions went into Russia, advancing all the way to the\nCaucasian mountains.",
        "A: Yes, yeah, life changed dramatically because the Aryan laws were put into effect\nby the Slovak legislature, following the script, the German script, and that means\nJews were stripped, in a very methodical way of all property, all privileges. And it\nwas a bureaucratically highly organized process of taking property away. The -- it\nwas very important that the various people who owed their loyalty to the Nazis and\nto the Slovak, were getting as much property as possible. So it started as a way of\nstripping the Jews of property, shipping most of the Jews, like 85 percent of the\nJews into annihilation camps, and then whoever was left, depriving them of all the\ncivil rights and -- and property and radios and fur coats and -- and automobiles, and\n-- and -- you know, th-there was a long list, I still have those lists of what you can\nor cannot do, and what street you can be on, what is your curfew, whether you can\nhave a window looking at the street, or not looking at the street. I mean it was a\nvery elaborate, bureaucratic structure that got erected to do this. And, you know, as\ntime went on, you know, things got closed down. The synagogue got closed down,\nthe Jewish school got closed down. Going to a movie got closed down and so forth\nand so forth. And it -- it was -- there was -- it was always a next step.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh yes. First we had a beautiful house that my father built in 1933, which was\non top of the store on the main, commercial streets. So, immediately we could not\nlive in the rooms which were facing the street. That was -- immediately we were\npushed down into the two rooms which were behind, not looking over the street. So\nthat went on for about eight month or so. Then came an ordinance that you cannot\nlive on that street altogether. So then we moved to another apartment, a one\nbedroom apartment. It was a very small living room, an upstairs walk-up, not too\nfar from our original house. And we were there for maybe a year. Then an\nordinance was passed that you cannot be even there, because it was ho -- it had hot\nand cold water. Jews cannot be in any apartment where there is both hot water and\ncold water. So we had to find a place which was really, you know, a slum, beca --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: We -- I surely did. I -- my father\u2019s house on the main street, when I finished my\nofficer course in 1945, in a military uniform and with a Tommy gun, I just walked\nin at two o\u2019clock in the morning, banged at the door. And of course it was occupied\nby the people who took over my father\u2019s business. They were absolutely petrified,\nyou know, it was immediately after the war, and I was basically a political officer.\nYou -- you must understand that when I got out of the partisans, I was considered to\nbe an exceptionally reliable person to be used for whatever purpose, such as eth --\nethnic cleansing, you know, I was ready to do anything. And so I went back as soon\nas I could to find out if anybody was alive and of course they were petrified, they\nimmediately moved out of the front -- front rooms of the house, to the back, where\nwe used to live. And I stayed there one night. I wa-wanted no part of it, I found out\nnobody knew about anything about my family. All they knew that my mother was\nfound shortly after she went into hiding and that nobody knew where my sister was,\nand everybody knew that my father was shipped to concentration camp right away.\nSo -- so that was in \u201945, I immediately went there. Since then a v -- you know,\nunder the communists, I couldn\u2019t go back. The -- it was shut down in 1948, when\nthe communists took over. First time I went back to Trencin was in -- maybe in\n1978 or \u201979. By that time the house was razed and a huge monster complex was\nbuilt up as -- for Soviet kind of apartments. But I go there now at least once a year,\nsometimes twice a year. I just finished a very major project in Trencin, which may\nbe of interest to you. When I went there in 1986, I went finally to the synagogue,\nwhich of course was converted into some kind of a music hall, but next to the\nsynagogue was a small chapel, and everything was piled in, what that was left from\nthe synagogue into the chapel. It was a warehou -- 1-it was a ma -- badly messed up\ncloset, that\u2019s all 1t was, the benches were stacked up. And on the wall were the\nnames of the Jews that perished. 1536 names. And they were just printed on pieces\nof paper that was curling and getting mildew. And there on the spot I decided that\nthat is not going to be. And after four years of work, and getting people from all\nover the world to cooperate, last year we unveiled 24 bronze tablets with the names.\nI paid for it, just about all of it. And it is now a sanctuary. So I\u2019ve been back -- I\nmean, this idea of getting that memorial up into the -- into that chapel was very time\nconsuming. I must have made like 10 trips negotiating with various people. See, the\nJews didn\u2019t want to have any part of it. They didn't want to stir trouble. So -- but\nfinally I -- y-you know, it got very complicated. Nobody wanted any part of it, you\nknow, why do you want to stir things up? Well, I stir things up.",
        "A: The few Jews, and I think there are eight or nine, that\u2019s all there is, and they\u2019re\nall in their 80\u2019s like my sister, want to be left alone, peaceful. They don\u2019t want to be\nbothered. They don\u2019t want to be called Jew, or anything. So their idea is to lay low,\nand if there\u2019s one thing this guy doesn\u2019t do, it\u2019s lay low, you know? So -- but\nultimately, people came from Israel, and from Germany and Switzerland and\nEngland for the unveiling. I think they were more interested in talking to one\nanother who survived, because they grew up all together. These are the survivors.\nThey\u2019re looking at the memorial, but that\u2019s okay, that memorial is go -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s --\nit\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s wedged into the wall with deep rivets. Th -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s heavy metal,\nlike this. So it\u2019s fairly indestructible, I mean, you would -- really would have to\nblow it up. And I just feel good about it, and to hell with everybody else.",
        "A: Oh, Jews have been in Trencin, you know, I mean for -- the records go back to\nabout the 11\" century, because you see, Trencin was always a military town, it was\na base. It was always a government town, it was a trading town. And so Jewish\ntraders came and gone. That\u2019s why you have those large co -- concentration of Jews\nin Trencin. Because the Jews were basically the lawyers and the record keepers and\nthe -- the -- the Hungarian and Austro-Hungarian nobility used Jews as their record\nkeepers, as their bookkeepers. See, the [indecipherable] never wanted to be tainted\nby anything commercial. So they -- and they actually, as you know the history, they\ninvited the Jews to come in to help them to manage Poland and -- and many of\nthose countries, because the Jews were totally dependent on the nobility. And so\nthere was a very large Jewish population and the Jews were being used as a money\ngatherer because the Jews really were, until about 1860 could not own land. So the\nJews were used as instrument of feudal oppression and tax collection, which of\ncourse was one of the sources of anti-Semitism, which was deeply endemic in that\npart, particularly among the peasantry.",
        "A: Yes, well because the Jews were urban.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. The jur -- the Jews were, of course, here and there, sitting in the -- in\nthe properties, where they were maintaining property, and they were innkeepers.\nBut that was p -- all part of the taxation mechanism that the feudal regime\nmaintained. See, the feudal lords, they don\u2019t want to mess around with that.",
        "A: I knew it from secondhand, of his torturing, because when I got back into\nTrencin as a political officer, I was hell bent to even some scores. And we were\ninterrogating a number of people, and I j-just found out what happened, because\neverybody was saying, well it wasn\u2019t me. It turned out that the Slovaks, jointly with\nthe local Germans went -- and they had a list of hostages that they wanted to pick\nup, people who were suspect as working with the partisans, you see, because my\nfather managed the food business, even under the Slovak regime. My father made\nsure that some food got moved into the villages. So my father was on the list for a\ncollaborator.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I -- well -- le-let me -- le-let me say, looking back at it, I really didn\u2019t settle any\nscores. I really did not kill anybody. There were some people that I testified against,\nbecause of some of the acts that they committed, but they were let go anyway, so --\nso there was no scores to settle.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "A: Yeah. Th -- as I noted before, during the bad years, which is \u201939 through \u201944, the\nparents really didn\u2019t speak much. They -- they -- they felt that -- that -- that I was a\npotential source of -- of leaks. Of course, my sister subsequently told me that she\nalso did not know what was going on. I think it was just the way my father and my\nmother operated is they -- they wanted to keep everything very tight. Also, in those\ndays you did not speak to your children as peers. It was a different social structure.\nChildren were there to be told what to do, to be educated, to be trained. And -- and -\n- and you had obligations, it was almost a feudal kind of a relationship. It\u2019s not the\nAmerican way, you know, where -- you know, the conversation between the father\nand the mother and the children is fairly free, at least in my family. So we -- we just\ndidn\u2019t know. We didn't know their thoughts.",
        "A: Oh yes. Well, yes, clearly, the responsible for the extended family and\nparticularly to his parents, he was very devoted to his father. He went and visited\nhis father every night. And th -- he could not get his father out. I mean, we had\npassports. You must understand. In 1938, my father, my mother, my sister and I had\npass -- valid passports. We could have walked out any time.",
        "A: It was unspoken, it was never discussed. They never discussed, you know, what\ncould have happened, or what didn\u2019t happen. That was never discussed, not to my\nbest knowledge, and neither to my sister\u2019s knowledge, who was older and she says\nshe didn\u2019t know. She just didn\u2019t know.",
        "A: Well, yes. I -- I would say that -- that the fir-fir-first -- everybody always said\nthat nobody expected it to be so bad. There was this old pattern, well somehow\nwe\u2019re going to mu -- muddle through. You know, this also will come to pass. I\ndon\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen the movie, \u201cThe Pianist\u201d. You remember the early scene\n-- by the way, I only saw the first eight minutes of the thing, and then I wa -- got\nsick. There they are, ready to move out and leave Warsaw, and they hear on the\nradio, Churchill announces that England and France is going ag-against -- in war\nagainst the Germans and they all have a big party because all their problems are\nsolved. You remember that scene? Well, that scene was repeated again and again\nand again. This is denial. The -- the -- much of the existence in those days was\ndenial. People were denial -- were in denial all the way to the entrance of the gas\nchambers, and even then they were in denial.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know about what is human nature, but -- but a-a-as you know,\nwhen you have no option -- this goes back to my options theory, okay, if you have\nno option, if you are -- if you have only one option, and that\u2019s all you have, the only\nthing you can do about it, if it\u2019s a horrible option, is to deny it. You don\u2019t want to\nface up to it.",
        "A: See, the moment you have options, you cannot do denial because you then have\nto confront -- you know, of the three or four things that I can do, which one will I\ndo? Then you have to go into so -- irrational process. So if you are pretty well set in\na given groove, denial will be the most natural way to try to deal with it, other than\ncommitting suicide.",

My mother was betrayed in 30 days.\nSomebody said, well there is a Jewess in this house. Most likely, of course, 1t was\ngiven that she was betrayed by the people who were keeping her. My sister was\npicked up on the street, somebody recognized her. And my mother was shipped to\nRavensbrick and so was my sister. My sister barely made it, I mean she was this\nclose.

My\nsister was very sick and she was on this forced march and they were shooting\nanybody who was a straggler, and she just fell down and two of her friends picked\nher up and walked her.

        "A: Initially. But she had no -- no -- she had no place to go. She just went to another\ntown. And once you were in another town and you were moving up 1n an open,\nsooner or later they\u2019re going to get you.\ninner reserves that might help you to keep going, but do you -- do you consciously\nhave any thoughts? Do you remember having memories of family times?",
        "A: Le-Let me sa -- tell you very, very clearly on this one. None. The -- the -- the\nconditions were so brutal and so difficult, that just coping with the here and now,\nand what do next totally occupied me.

So if you\u2019re totally occupied with trying to make the next\nstep, the -- you know, the next sortie, the next raid, the next piece of clothing that\nyou need because winter is coming. The -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the struggle for\nsurvival in -- on a very brutal military conditions was so extreme that looking back\nwas really not very useful. And -- and I usually don\u2019t look back. It was interesting,\nabout two days ago I had a conversation with my daughter. She had a contract that\nexpired early in 2003, and the people paid her for awhile, and then she protested\nand so they finally gave her a new contract. And th -- it\u2019s a nice contract, it\u2019s a three\nyear contract. The question was, they didn\u2019t pay her for about four month and there\nwas a back pay issue. And her husband screamed at her that she should not sign a\ncontract because th-they owe her back pay. I say, forget about it. Forget about back\npay, you know. It\u2019s gone, you know\u201d? Look forward, they\u2019re giving you a good deal\nfor the next three years. Take it and run.",

You better get out while the getting is good. So he\nfound a school in England which was teaching electronics, who signed me up for a\ncourse. And with that course and the fact that I\u2019d all kinds of certificates and what\nhave you, plus the fact that I paid 50,000 dollars for a passport, I was able to leave\nSlovakia with a -- one suitcase and no money, on February the seventh, of 1948.\nThe communists took over on February the 15\", and shut the place down.",

He made one ship every two days. And they were\nsort of tacky, and against all the code violations and what have you, but they\nbrought the troops back and forth, brought them home. You know, the -- the\nGermans sank a few, but not too many. They went -- used to go in big convoys.\nAnd then in 1946, the relief for Europe, much of the grain went in Liberty ships.\nBut by \u201948 those ships were just too small for that sort of thing, so they retired them\ndown in the James River.

So I had a very -- I never recovered until I married\nher, and then she started feeding me what she calls in a -- not very well seasoned\nhospital food. She\u2019s -- she -- she still just believes in boiled chicken and boiled\npotatoes and -- and -- and not -- not -- none of the fancy food. I love the spiced,\nfancy stuff.

On the other hand, my mother knew so many people and\nthey brought us fruit and they brought us things that otherwise were not available.\nOnce in awhile we had a chicken.

And\nin the -- the summer of 1950, after having a course in surveying, I volunteered to go\nto Israel to do surveying of Arab lands, subdivide Arab lands, f -- you know, for the\nnew jew -- Jewish settlements. And made a load -- loads of money, I mean -- I\nmean, they really paid well. I didn\u2019t know, when they told me to go and how much\nthey will pay me, that this actually involved getting shot at, because you see, the\nsurveyors 1s the first thing you kill. You -- you -- you understand, you always take a\nshot at the surveyors. But the problem was that towards the end, and I, against any\nadvice, drank from an Arab well, water, because I was so thirsty.

All -- you know,\nall you ate was potato chips and rotisserie chicken that you bought in a supermarket,\nand you know, perfectly good food, plus some Twinkies, you know?

On graduation day, 1953, us\nengineers, who really didn\u2019t have time for anything because th -- you know, it was\nmuch more convenient for a date to go upstairs than to go scurrying around the\ntown. We went upstairs and we invited some of the girls from the art\n[indecipherable] to go to -- for hot dogs at Coney Island. You know, it -- that was\nthe big thing. So this whole bunch of girls from the art school -- it was one s -- one\nclass below our class. I was al -- oh -- because of my military, I was older than my -\n- my -- my -- the other guys in this school. We went to Coney Island and somehow\nthey put her next to me on the roller coaster. Now, have you ever been on a Coney\nIsland roller coaster? The most dangerous thing, I mean, people get killed all the\ntime in those days. Well, we go into the roller coaster and it\u2019s just really bad, I mean\nit\u2019s really -- I mean it\u2019s one of these extreme things. We get on the top, we come\ndiving down and this girl goes limp on me. She basically -- whatever, she either\nfainted or whatever. Well, I grab her, because you know, in those days they didn\u2019t\nhave any of the safety stuff, she could have fallen out. Well, we get off the roller\ncoaster, she\u2019s as white as a linen. And I say well, you know, I really have to take\ncare of you, I saved your life. And she said, well what do you want to do? I said,\nwell you know, I have to take you somewhere. And that\u2019s how we met and never\nleft. So that\u2019s the girl I saved. She always had an eye on me anyway.",
        "A: Yes, her father was a very unusual guy. He was a philosopher, he was in a\nJewish tradition, a student. He really was a very bad businessman, very bad. But he\nwas a Scholar and he read. The mother pretty well ran -- wonderful woman,\nwonderful woman, her mother. They ultimately ended up living with us. And th --\nMona\u2019s father, Joe and I got along very well. Joe\u2019s idea was that the world is\ncoming to an end, and that you have to go and really live out on a farm somewhere,\nso it will be self sufficient. So he bought a 10 acre farm, upstate New York, in\nDuchess county and built a sort of a dinky house, and -- and well, got cattle and\ngeese and planted an orchard and the conversation was always survival. Subject that\nI sort of could relate to. This where went during the Cuban -- Cuban episode. So --\nso he and I used to go up, you know, as the kids, my little children were growing\nup, leaving my mother-in-law and Mona and the little kids and he and I went up\nfarming, to prepare for doomsday. It\u2019s a long, sad story. He used excessive amount\nof insecticide because he wasn\u2019t a resident there, and he ultimately got a stroke\nfrom -- from the insecticides, you know -- you know, the insecticide was very\npowerful, he over-overdosed the place with insectici -- insecticide and herbicide.",
        "A: Well, he did, but he -- he was -- it was not on his mind. But I married into a\nwonderful family, I really -- he was a true friend. Joe was a true friend. Mother -- I\ncalled her Mother, was a very loving person. She stayed with us. She was really a\ntrue grandmother to my little children. You know, we had four children, one after\nanother, and the-there was lots of work to be done. And my wife Mona never\nwanted to have any servants. First we couldn\u2019t afford it, so you know, my -- my --\nmy wife washed the diapers. I mean, there was no -- no such thing as -- you know,\nbuying them, diapers.

Then she went to Johns Hopkins and she was going to be --\ngo study medicine, and something happened in Johns Hopkins, and I really don\u2019t\nknow what, where she suddenly just decided she was very insecure about herself.\nWhat it was, you know, I visited her; she just clammed up. She then went for a\nMaster\u2019s degree in public health. Went to work for a number of insurance\ncompanies. She\u2019s quite an expert in her field. She\u2019s a recognized expert. She has\nmaybe 80 published papers in the field. The men she always -- she is on her third\nmarriage, although one of them sort of had a heart attack and died on her.

She -- she married him because she expected that he\u2019s\ngoing to be a rich man. When she discovered he\u2019s not going to be a rich man, she\njust walked.

[indecipherable] well, I study the\nteacher, I don\u2019t study the subject. He has a Ph.D. from M.I.T., has a undergraduate\ndegree. He just went to M.I.T. and stayed. He would have stayed in M.I.T. all his\nlife, he di -- had a great time, lots of girls. Good looking boy. I mean, he just draws\ngirls like -- like -- like, you know, the catnip, you know, just very congenial. He\u2019s a\nBoy Scout and an Eagle Scout. A real solid citizen, honest as can be. Very smart,\nvery good friend of mine. Very good friend of mine. I mean, he and I talk once or\ntwice a day. Let me give you a Steven typical. Comes high school. I say, Steven,\nyou have to start applying to college. He says, it\u2019s too much paperwork. And -- and\nthen I-I say, well yeah, but you have to, you know, you have to spread your risk,\nyou know, you have a number of col -- where do you want to go? Well Dad, you\nwent to M.I.T., I go to M.LT.. I say, it\u2019s hard to get to M.I.T.. Oh, don\u2019t worry. So,\nyou know, now -- now -- now, you know, it\u2019s March and I say, Steven, where are\nyour applications? Well, I applied for early admission to M.I.T.. Now, you know, in\nthose days, early admission means that you don\u2019t apply to anybody else and you\u2019ve\n-- you understand, you -- you -- you -- you just roll your dice, and that\u2019s it. I said,\nyou can\u2019t do that. He goes up to -- to -- to M.I.T. for an interview. I buy him a\nBrooks Brothers suit, th-the kid has never wore a suit in his life before or ever after.\nOne of the beautiful things about Steven is very early, you know, I had computers\nin my house. Never told the kids to go be interested in computers. Steven -- all my\nkids had to go to work at the age of 13, just like my father, you know, you -- you\nhave to have a trade. Steven decided to sell Apple computers. This is when Apple\ncame out. Well, the salesman in the electronics store didn\u2019t have a clue what an\nApple computer was like. Steven was a hacker from the word go. He sold more\nApple computers than anybody else. So -- so he goes up to M.I.T. and they -- during\nthe interview he tells them how to sell microcomputers. M.I.T. said, well, you\nknow, fine. Early admission? You\u2019re in. So he comes back in the evening by train\nfrom Boston, sort of mischievously, like I didn\u2019t do it kind of a thing. I say, well\nSteve, what happened? Well, they accepted me. I said, well, when are you starting?\nWell, they accepted me. So -- so he never filled out a piece of paper. I mean, he\u2019s a\nreal rascal. I mean, this kid is a rascal. Very good natured, really helping me. Y-You\nknow, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m doing some fairly complicated things. So that\u2019s Steven. And then\nof course, comes --",
        "A: And M.I.T. made a good choice, yeah, yeah. And then, of course, comes the\napple of my heart, Eric, the youngest. Beautiful child. I mean, this kid had\neverything. Eagle Scout. He was -- he\u2019d has his own software company. He started\ndoing software in high school, when a teacher gave him a project to do, physics,\nlike a pendulum, he wrote a software program to solve all the pendulum problems\nin the world, and handed in a floppy disk as his homework. The teacher then said,\nyou know what -- and now, Eric is now 14. There may be other kids who would\nwant to -- to -- to take advantage of this thing. So Eric, with my help, opens a\nsoftware business, Strassmann, Incorporated, and start selling and licensing\nworldwide, Apple programs to be peddled to high schools throughout the world to\nsolve homework in physics.",
        "A: Well, we -- we -- we -- we lived in New York and then when Vera came we had\na small, two bedroom apartment. And then when the other kids came, I bought a\nhouse in Mount Vernon, a four bedroom apartment. I always wanted the kids to\nhave their own bedrooms. And then I built, in 1969 -- in \u201968, this absolutely\ngorgeous house in Chappaqua, a six bedroom house. I mean it really -- it made the\nfront page of the real estate section of the New York Times. It was made out of\nredwood, I mean, and it was made by Finnish carpe -- boat carpenters, who used to\ncome during the winter season when Finland sort of freezes up, to work here where\nit\u2019s warmer. And they built my house like a ship. I mean, it was really some house.",
        "A: Oh yeah, that -- that was really built. And -- and so --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: Chappaqua.",
        "A: So s -- and Eric could do anything. He -- he was a worker, for instance. You\nknow, he was 12 years old when we built the house. He laid the pavement for the\nsidewalks. He -- he was a worker. This kid, I mean, you know, we have pictures of\nhim, always with a shovel, or something, or helping. A scout, very much admired as\na scout. Very thoughtful. He -- he was a -- a child that was thinking about -- was not\nimpulsive. He was a very thoughtful, very bright, but not assertive, he was sort of a\nlovable teddy bear. Everybody loved this kid. And -- and -- but he always liked to\nexperiment. He did -- I mean, he did always something, you know, he -- he -- he put\na knife into the electrical socket when he was three years old. He climbed this tall\ntree that we have here, this 50 foot tree, all the way to the top to see how far he can\ngo. As quiet as he was, he was always pushing the limit. This kid did not have any\nlimits. And so we lost him in 1984. I must say that was the most devastating thing\nthat ever happened to me. I mean, this is -- you know, when you look at life, you\nknow, what happened over the last 75 years, that is the thing that was the -- the\nworst thing. Worse than the Holocaust, worse than anything, because this kid was\njust -- and he\u2019s destroyed my wife. I mean, she -- she just absolutely shrank, as a\nresult. And life has never been the same. He was such a good kid, and -- and -- you\nknow, I -- I always felt that if I ever have somebody who could be a president of the\nUnited States, that was the kid who could make it. You know, the -- the -- when you\nget an Eagle Scout, there\u2019s a -- what\u2019s called a court of honor. Do you know about\nEagle Scouts?",
        "A: It\u2019s a big deal.",
        "A: It\u2019s a big deal.",
        "A: And -- and charisma, because you have to be able to organize the other kids, who\nlook to him as a leader. Everybody always looked to him as a leader because he was\nnot a pushy -- he was a leader leader, he actually went out and did things. He wa --\na-at the court of honor the scout executive said, well I\u2019ve seen lots of Eagles in my\nlife, never seen one like this. So that is the tragedy, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Ah, it\u2019s a long story. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s a -- yeah. It\u2019s -- again, he was pushing, he was\npushing the limit.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah. Yeah, an-and he was very close to me. You know, his\nstatement always were, when I grow up I want to be just like Dad. And he always\nasked me how -- why did you do this, why did you do this?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, what happened was, he was so admired at Harvard that Harvard did\nsomething that has never been done before. The students, from their own money,\nwhen they graduated, decided to take all the money -- because you know, when the\nstudents go in and they sell their books and furniture to the next class, and what\nhave you, they took all the money and informed the faculty that they are putting a\ngranite bench with Eric\u2019s name on the quadrangle. Now, you know, there\u2019s lots of\nrich kids at Harvard and so forth. There\u2019s lots of parents. Mr. Bok, who was the pre\n-- chairman -- president of Harvard was so taken --",

It continues to this day. And there is a library,\nEric\u2019s computer library in -- in a kibbutz in Israel. There is a funding to put\ncomputer books there in his memory. It\u2019s going to be 20 years this year, and I\u2019m\nputting together, right now, in the middle, putting together a book about Eric for his\nsiblings and for the grandchildren.",

        "A: Yeah, wh-what happened over here was after Cooper Union, when I\u2019ve -- and I\nfinished Tau Beta Pi, and you know, honors, and number two man in a very tough\nschool. Cooper Union 1s a tough school because it\u2019s all -- everybody there is on\nscholarship. And it was very competitive, these were -- this was the last crop of\nWorld War II veterans who went on the G.I. Bill of Rights to school, and th-they --\nthey were a different generation, I mean, very serious students, I mean no\nhorseplay, no nothing. And my conclusions was that although I loved engineering\nand always wanted to be an engineer, I felt that I just didn\u2019t have -- I was not an\neducated person. And there was a trustee of Cooper Union by the name of Rossi,\nwho set up a scholarship for the Sloane School at M.I.T., which in those days was\nother than Harvard Business School, but for engineers it was the school on -- on --\non -- on management. And I was nominated for the Rossi scholarship, because of all\nof that. And I basically said that -- that I would love to go to M.LT. -- and by the\nway, M.I.T. accepted me, but a Strassmann doesn\u2019t take scholarship money from\nanybody, I am self-supporting. Now everybody tells me, including my wife Mona,\nthat was absolutely stupid. But I declined the scholarship because I considered it a\nact of charity. Now, this was still the old way, you know, you don\u2019t take money\nfrom anybody.",
        "A: Yeah, I don -- doesn\u2019t take money from anybody. So -- and I just made quite a\nbit of money working on the New Jersey turnpike, summers. So -- so -- so I said,\nwell, I\u2019m going to pay my own way, which I could afford. You know, in those days\nthe tuition at M.I.T. was 40 -- 4,500 dollars, which was an awful lot of money, but I\nmade eight. And of course, I worked overtime and weekends and what have you,\nbut I had 8,000 dollars, so I could afford 4,500 dollars. So I went to M.I.T. Sloane\nschool. That\u2019s when I started dating Mona. Mona was either in New York or at her\ndad\u2019s country place in Salt Point, New York, Godforsaken place out in the boonies.\nAnd she just said, well, if you\u2019re interested in me, you better court me. And I asked\nher father for permission for me to court her, you know. He says, take her, you\nknow? He liked me very much. But, you know, you don\u2019t -- did -- don\u2019t ask --\nnobody does that any more. So I said, yeah, but 1-in the Bible, you -- I have to earn\na wife, and I don\u2019t have money. So, he said, well, you know, what do you want to\ndo? I said, well I want to do something on this farm for you so that I can show,\nbecause it was a -- Abraham built for his father-in-law Laban, a enclosure for sheep.\nSaid, I\u2019m going to build something for you. And my father-in-law -- potential\nfather-in-law said, well, you know, I could really use a barn. So I built a 22 by 22\nbarn to earn my wife, which was subject to lots of conversations over the years. So I\nfinished that, and the --",
        "A: Oh, my father-in-law helped me, you know, you know. But -- but I d -- I did\nquite a bit of 1t myself. But that was considered t-to be that, you know, how old-\nfashioned do you want to get, I mean, you know, you\u2019re really getting Biblical. But\nI felt, you know, I have to earn -- this is a wife, I have to earn it, you know? So that\nwas that. So while I was working weekends on the barn, I was also working for a\ncompany who was building the New Jersey turnpike. And the problem was that that\nsummer there was a dispute about toll collectors, and you may or may not have\nheard that story. You haven\u2019t heard the story?",
        "A: Oh, that\u2019s the story. Well, I\u2019m sitting in a drafting room, checking blueprints,\nyou know, a-and there was no air conditioning, and when you lean your sweat on an\nOzalid blueprint, you leave an orange mark, yeah, really miserable, smelly, but that\nwas the job I had. And one day as -- as -- as Al Matimbi, the senior partner of\nHoward, Needles, Tammen and Bergendoff, a very distinguished consulting firm,\nthey built most of the turnpikes in the United States, walks through. He says,\nStrassmann, I understand you going to M.I.T.. Yeah. What are you going to study? I\nsaid, well I\u2019m going to study management. He said, well do you know anything\nabout statistics? Oh, sure. Well, we got a problem. We have a union dispute on the\nNew Jersey turnpike we just built, where the toll collectors say that we are -- that\nthey are overworked. And we need somehow to figure out whether they are\noverworked or not, because the governor goes through the tollgates and finds that\nthey are just standing there doing nothing. Course the governor goes to work at 11\no\u2019clock in the morning, but -- ah, so I said, oh, th-th-this thing 1s answer, you know,\nyou have punch tickets in ev-ev-every toll gate, with round holes. All you have to\ndo is count the punch tickets and find out how many cars go through, do some time\nmotion studies on the toll collector -- I make it up as I go, and we\u2019 ll figure out\nwhether they are overworked or not. He said, you know what? Let me take you off\nthis -- this drawing board and let me put you to work on the New Jersey turnpike.\nFor the next two years in grad school, I processed hundred thousands of punch\ncards from the New Jersey turnpike, through the only place in the world where there\nwas a computer like this, M.I.T.. When I got done I had a Master\u2019s thesis, which is\ntoday considered to be the first Master\u2019s thesis in the United States on business\napplication of computer. That computer scheduled toll collectors and compared\nwhat they were doing against what the machine was doing. I got paid an awful lot\nof money. Howard, Needles got paid extremely well for this thing.",
        "A: Everybody was happy. I finally had enough money to be able to afford a wife,\nbecause I was not going to have a wife -- my father-in-law was going to give me\nmoney. I said, f-forget about it, you know, I -- I\u2019m supporting my wife. So -- so I\ngot into computers in 1954. Really liked it and from then on I was in computers and\n-- and -- so you sort of wander into these things almost -- almost by accident.",
        "A: Well --",
        "A: Yeah, my -- my children have always asked me the question. My answer to that\nis everybody has luck. The question is, do you pick it up or not. But everybody,\nsooner or later, has luck. The -- everybody has coincidences, and some people jump\nat it, and some people sort of walk away from it, or don\u2019t recognize it.",
        "A: So --",
        "A: Oh, yeah, something like -- something like that. And -- and so the ga -- the\nquestion 1s -- again, coming back to this whole question of choice, luck is -- and I\u2019m\ngiving you the mathematical concept, luck is an event, it\u2019s in -- what\u2019s called a\nnode. And out of that node goes a number of options. One of the options is to do\nnothing. Another option, of course, not even know that you have a node. Now the\nreal game of life is that you have a node, which happens, and it happens to\neverybody. Now, of course, if you are in America, you have more nodes than if you\nare in the Soviet Union. I mean, this is -- this is part of the social context. In other\nwords, you cannot say that a peasant 1n India a -- or in -- in Bangladesh has all his\nluck opportunities. Th -- you know they are -- the tragedy, they are all constrained\nin a world where there are no choices at all. But if you are in America and you\nhappen to be moving 1n a given direction which seems to be evolving and where the\noptions are continually opening -- in other words, if you are in -- in making buggy\nwhips, you know, ther -- ye -- you know, you\u2019re th -- unless you do something else,\nyou know, you just don\u2019t have those options. But the luck is there, it\u2019s always there.\nIn America more so. And as you climb up on the chain of luck, which by the way\nlooks -- gr-graphically it\u2019s represented at what\u2019s called a decision tree. I don\u2019t -- I\nmean, there\u2019s a formal branch of economics called decision trees. By the way, ma --\nthe first professional paper I ever wrote, that was published, was on so-called\nstocastic decision trees. Stocastic 1s probabilistic decision trees tr -- dec -- decision\ntrees that branch out probabilistically. Which means at any given juncture you don\u2019t\nonly have branches, one or two branches, but you have a whole spectrum. It\u2019s just --\njust occurred to me I never mentioned it that way, but that -- coming back to the\nquestion of -- of luck, what you learn from Holocaust, coming back to the theme, is\nthat certain things happen, or the -- what happened in 1944 is that I go where the\nshooting is. I go up the mountain, I get a hand grenade, come down the mountain\nand there is bunch of Russian commando groups who just looking for somebody\njust like me to walk ahead of them, okay? Now that\u2019s stupid luck, okay? Now\nsomebody else would say, well, you know, I\u2019m not going to go with the Russians.\nBy the way, the guy who went with me, imme -- immediately wanted no part of it\nbecause the Russians were really a ragtag bunch of bandits. I mean, they were really\na bunch of bandits. And I say, bandits, you know, this is fine, you know? Besides,\nthey wanted me, you know. Besides, they gave me a rifle, you know? So luck\nhappens and then you learn to -- to push it -- push it, as far as you can do. Now, in\ncase of my son Eric, he pushed it too far. But, there you go. So -- so th -- that is the\nmodel, then. The -- the model of the Holocaust is that those people who get\nsquashed, and there are lots of them, wh-who -- you -- you know, the people who\nbrought me to America, you know, the friend of my father\u2019s and so forth --",
        "A: -- they stayed confined. They started -- they went into the Jewish lodge and they\nmeet Sundays, for years and years, bemoaning the tragedy and what happened, and\nthey sti-still speak Slovak, and they have lectures about, you know, Vienna in 1934,\nand th -- Prague -- you know, Prague theater in 1932. I mean, they\u2019re still in the\nback country. They\u2019re still mentally back there.",
        "A: The -- the -- the -- th-the model that I believe I represent is -- the notion 1s that\nopportunities happen, and you have to look forward, and see how far it gets you,\neven if it kills you.",
        "A: Seize opportunities, take risk, and -- but do it within certain confines of value,\nbecause there are others who came to the United States, Jews --",
        "A: -- who basically went after money, you know, how much money can I make?\nAnd they become speculators, criminals, embezzlers, con artists, stock market map\n-- manipulators and all of that. There\u2019s -- you know, New York is full of that. I\nmean, there\u2019s -- there is a whole Jewish money-optimizing, with no feeling for\nAmerica, no feeling for the community, no feeling for the society, who are very,\nvery successful, particularly in real estate and so forth.",
        "A: You know, beco -- becoming billionaires. Money is an outcome. I always tell my\nchildren, whether you get money, or don\u2019t get money, well that\u2019s an outcome.\nThat\u2019s not a goal, ever. So, you know, one has to really put around this whole\nquestion of -- of values, also a question of what do you represen -- what are your\nbeliefs? What is the ethics? And what is the -- what\u2019s called the sense of honor.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Yeah, th-th -- this is the essence of faith. The essence of faith is grace,\nfellowship, trying to make life better 1f you can, and have responsibility to your\nsociety and to your community. And so that\u2019s -- it\u2019s this -- but you never, never\ncompromise on that, even if it works against you. For instance, you know, the\npeople in the Jewish circle, particularly the people who brought me to America,\nalways berated me that I never applied for reparations from the Nazis. I mean, just -\n- you know, it\u2019s unthinkable. I mean, it\u2019s just -- just not right. Just not right.",
        "A: No, I felt it was not right.",
        "A: But they felt it was not right for me not to do it because you know, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m\nleaving the -- the bastards with money. But 1 -- but -- but that\u2019s not the question of\nmoney, it\u2019s a question of honor.",
        "A: Yeah, a -- a -- a moral wrong di -- does not get right by money.",
        "A: By paying them the money, ever.",
        "A: Okay. You know, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s very fundamental.",
        "A: That was so wrong that the acknowledgement isn\u2019t good enough. No amount of\nacknowledgement is good enough, okay?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. No -- I mean, just not right. Certain things are such horrible crimes -",
        "A: And sometimes doing the right thing, against your interest, turns out to be\nunbelievably attractive and profitable. Let me give you a si -- my favorite story. My\nfavorite story is here I become the chief information officer of Kraft. You know,\nSealtest milk, ice cream, cheese on the loading dock. I have 48 computers making it\npossible for people to come up at four o\u2019clock in the morning to the sh -- loading\ndock, get the pieces of paper, where they deliver this ice cream, or this cream and so\nforth. And it -- now it\u2019s 1963, and I just can\u2019t get all of the -- the business is\nfantastic and now they want more sophisticated delivery tickets, what have you, and\nIBM cannot do it. Just can\u2019t do it. IBM says, well look, we are making new\nmachines, the 360 series are going to be fantastic, but we cannot give you machines\nthat can cope with your workload. And I said, guys, you know, you keep promising\nthings to me and you\u2019re not delivering. Well, it turns out that I get a phone call from\na guy by the name of Art Messerschmitt from Syracuse, and he says, you know, I\u2019m\ngolfing with this Honeywell salesman and the Honeywell salesman -- and I know\nthey have a very good machine -- the Honeywell salesman tells me he\u2019s going to\nput a Honeywell machine side by side with the IBM machine, charge me nothing,\nand when the Honeywell machine does exactly what the IBM machine, but twice as\nmuch for half the price, you have to promise me that I can get rid of the IBM\nmachine. Now, in 1963 getting rid of IBM 1s, if you know, no-no. I mean, they just\n-- not good for your career. You understand that? I said --",
        "A: [indecipherable] fired.",
        "A: So I say, Art, you know, what the hell? Go ahead and do it. So Art\nMesserschmitt brings in the Honeywell machine, slides it in, it is fantastic. Get rid\nof that IBM machine. Well, so then the other controllers -- I mean, you know, the\nmilk business, these are -- the people in Sealtest and Kraft are middle America.\nPenny pinching, honest farm guy, none of this fancy New York stuff. And they said,\nwhat the hell, you know? It\u2019s three cents for a carload of this stuff, let\u2019s get some\nmore Honeywells in, so the -- I started rolling in Honeywell. Well, IBM gets very\nexcited. What IBM does in those days 1s they get the guy who does this thing fired.",
        "A: I mean -- [indecipherable] So they --",
        "A: That\u2019s right [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, well, the -- it works the other way.",
        "A: He gets fired if you get rid of IBM. So IBM sends one of their heavies, an\nexecutive vice-president to have golf with Edwards, the Chairman of the Board of\nKraft. And they go golfing, they\u2019re having a good time, they\u2019re friends and this. Oh,\nthen after the golf, the executive vice president of IBM says to the chairman of\nKraft, you know, this guy Strassmann 1s really taking lots of risks, I mean, getting\nrid of --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: -- this guy has reputation. He\u2019s a risk taker, and you know, if you were 1n the\nbusiness, you don\u2019t want to take any risks. Besides, IBM is going to have these new\nmachines, you know. And Gordon Edwards, a good old Texan, says, you know, Joe,\nwhen you have those machines and you\u2019re ready to ship them, we have -- you have\norders for them, yeah. We\u2019ll test them too. Meanwhile, Strassmann is shipping ice\ncream on a loading dock and it\u2019s not melting. So, you know, what\u2019s the problem?\nSo Strassmann -- everybody -- of course everybody tells this story, you know, the --\nthe -- the -- the -- the Kraft company is good old boys. This is sen -- middle\nAmerica. This is good old boys, you know. They think this is very funny. They\nthink this is a riot. They talk about it. Four years later, Xerox decides to go into\ncomputer business. And they buy this company, which was a bad company to begin\nwith, p-pay billion dollars for it. The chairman of the board of Xerox announces that\nthe way how they\u2019re going to prove that this turkey is really good 1s that we are\ngoing to get rid of all of our IBM computers, and I have just the guy who knows\nhow to get rid of. So they hire me, double my salaries and were willing to pay me\n5,000 shares of Xerox stock for every IBM computer I get rid of. That\u2019s what built\nthis house. Every store you look in there\u2019s an IBM computer. You know, I can point\nto the [indecipherable] you know. So -- so that is how things can sometimes work\nfor you. Xerox needed -- the only guy with a track record of getting rid of IBM\ncomputers in the United States, was Paul Strassmann.",
        "A: So, a similar story is -- a similar story is when I retired from Xerox -- again, I\u2019m\ndistr-splaying a morality. The morality 1s, good, bad or indifferent -- I mean,\nGordon Edwards could have come back from that golf game and fired me on the\nspot, for whatever reason.",
        "A: But that\u2019s not the way I play the game. If they would have wanted to fire me, this\nwas not going to be a company for me to work for anyway, you know. Years later,\nI\u2019m wi -- quite an expert, I write a couple of books about computers. General\nMotors buys EDS, this big corporation. EDS takes over all computers from General\nMotors, it\u2019s a absolute disaster. Ross Perot gets greedy, starts charging General\nMotors excess money. General Motors plant managers don\u2019t get any bonuses, EDS\ngets all the bonuses. So the vice-chairman of General Motors is given the job to find\nout whether EDS is overcharging or not. Guess who they hire? Paul Strassmann.\nYou see, I don\u2019t have any consultants, I don\u2019t have -- I don\u2019t bring in a big staff. I\nam a well known expert in the fie-field. I study the situation, I call up the vice-\nchairman of General Motors and say, look, they\u2019re overcharging you. And then he -\n- he says, well how much are they overcharging me? They are overcharging you at\nleast 300 million dollars a year, which is quite a bit of money. And it\u2019s actually\nmore, but 300 million dollars you can prove. So he says, you know, this is very\ndifficult, Ross Perot is on the Board of Directors of General Motors. I have to bring\nit up before the board. Why don\u2019t you write a half page memorandum, stand by\nuntil the board meeting and just before the board meeting you fax it to my secretary\noutside of the board meeting and I\u2019Il read it to the board. Which he does -- I mean,\nthis was going to be hush-hush. By three o\u2019clock in the afternoon every plant\nmanager in General Motors who hates the guts of EDS has a copy of Strassmann\u2019s\nmemo that they\u2019re overcharged by 300 million doll -- which is out of their pocket,\nyou know?",
        "A: So General Motors says, you know, sorry, you know, this really caused all kinds\nof problems. We\u2019re going to pay you your fee, but we cannot employ you any more.\nI come home, Mona tells me, you know, Strassmann, again, you know, you just\nplay it straight, you know? You missed a great opportunity getting a consulting\ncontract from General Motors. You -- couldn\u2019t you have varnished it a little or\nsomething? I say, well that\u2019s the way it is. Six months later, the vice-chairman of\nGeneral Motors is now deputy secretary of defense, working for Dick Cheney.\nSoviet Union collapses --",
        "A: Donald Atwood.",
        "A: Yeah, Donald Atwood.",
        "A: W-We -- Congress decides [indecipherable] dividend, cuts the department of ar -\n- Department of Defense budget by 75 billion dollars. And Cheney turns to Donald\nAtwood say, well you know, find the 75 billion dollars. Donald can find 30, but\nthere is -- he\u2019s short, you know, he\u2019s short quite a bit. So he said, well we are going\nto do it by corporate information [indecipherable] we are going to bring into the\ndepartment of defer -- corporate information management based on computers. You\nknow, this is -- this is -- this is a holy grail, you know, every couple of years this\nidea perks up and dies.",
        "A: Okay. And I am just the bastard who knows how to do it. And guess what? I get\npulled into the Department of Defense as the first Chief Information Officer of the\nDepartment of Defense --",
        "A: -- to do the job.",
        "A: Oh yes. I mean, everybody agrees and you know, I and -- you know, I\n[indecipherable] I don\u2019t know how many billions I saved, but I at least set the thing\nin a direction -- finally Rumsfeld is doing it now, but it takes a long time to move\nthat -- that thing. But again, you know, who would have known that by calling the\nshots on General Motors, would end -- will end me up in this -- this position. So\nthere\u2019s a story.",
        "A: Now, just to show you how luck or opportunity works, I get into the Department\nof Defense, and I look around, and I say, well what\u2019s wrong is computers report to\nthe controller. Computers should not report to the controller because finance people\njust keeps computers under throttle, computers is a weapon, it\u2019s a military weapon,\nit\u2019s a command and control weapon. Let\u2019s yank out the computers away from the\ncontroller. Now, to do that in the Department of Defense, I mean, 1s -- this is hard.",
        "A: Tha-That\u2019s really rocking the boat. We rocked the boat, guess what? Donald\nAtwood wanted to do it anyway, now he pulls the responsibility for computers away\nfrom the controller of the depart -- where it has been for the prior 50 years. The\ncontroller of the Department of Defense is a guy by the name of Sean O\u2019Keefe. So\nwe -- we make an enemy right there. So we take it out, we bring it under and the\nassistant Secretary of Defense for command and control, the military loves me. The\nmilitary just loves me. I get a big checkbook, I start spending money on the special\nforces, who until then didn\u2019t get the money. They make me an honorary Green\nBeret, they find out that I was a guerilla fighter. Boy, this is one of our guys, he\u2019s\none of ours. And of course, I give them the money, you know, I move the money\naway from finance and give it to the war fighters. I mean, you can\u2019t go wrong, I\nmean. So the story then goes, I retire from the Department of Defense with all the\nhonors, you know, but when Clinton gan -- comes in, that\u2019s not the place for me to\nbe, I mean, I just can\u2019t stand the guy. NASA gets into trouble. The new\nadministrator of NASA is one Sean O\u2019 Keefe. He says, I know just the bastard to\nstraighten out this place.",
        "A: No, what happens is that people disagree with me, but everybody respects me.",
        "A: Yeah. And so I get a call that, you know, would you like to do some consulting\nfor NASA? So I -- sure. I come down to NASA. They showed me everything else. I\ndidn\u2019t know I was walking into a setup. I ga -- arrive at NASA at nine o\u2019clock in the\nmorning. They give me the review of the situation. I said, you guys are just in an\nawful mess. Okay, Mr. Strassmann, what would do? I said, well there are three\nthings you have to do. Well, you know, now it\u2019s 3:30 in the afternoon, would you\nlike to walk up and present your findings to the administrator? I walk in, oh Paul, so\nnice to see you, so glad to see -- you know. I present the thing, and he said, well,\nyou know, that makes awful sense. Guess what, you\u2019re staying here and you\u2019re\ngoing to fix it. I said, well I\u2019m here for a consulting. No, you\u2019re coming -- you\u2019re\nstaying here and fixing it. I say, well you cannot appoint me to a senior executive\nposition in the federal government that easily. He said, you think I can\u2019t? So he\nsaid, well, will you take it? I say, well, you know, I am a servant of this country. If -\n- if am asked to do something -- he says, just wait a moment, picks up the phone,\nbrings in lawyers, what have you. I walk at 6:30 that evening with a badge, as the\nChief Information Officer of NASA. Now, the question is luck, opportunity, or\nwhat, but there is a pattern. You know, I have many stories like that.",
        "A: I mean, lots of stories like that. The -- the -- the paradigm of the Holocaust, the --\ncoming back to the Holocaust is that what I learned from the Holocaust is that there\nis always opportunity. You cannot stay in a position where there\u2019s no opportunity,\nbecause you die, one way or another. And this is true. In the Holocaust this is also\ntrue, in business, this true everywhere in life. And within bounds of ethics and\nhonor and commitment and service, you just do what\u2019s right. And then if you\nhappen to get money for it, well so be it.",
        "A: But that\u2019s not the way I make the -- the decisions. That\u2019s not the way to make\ndecisions.",
        "A: Well, sure, y -- well, yeah. But -- and the well may or may not come.",
        "A: So that -- that is really -- I think -- not just Paul Strassmann, this is -- this is\nbigger than Paul Strassmann, has to do with history of Jews --",
        "A: -- has to do with preservation, has to do --",
        "A: It\u2019s a -- oh, history of a people. Jews, when you look at the history of the people,\nhave been extremely successful in survival. They are the oldest survive --\ncontinually survivable civilization and culture. There\u2019s nobody else who goes that\nfar back in a line of succession. The Egyptians are gone, the Romans are gone, the\nGreeks are gone. The Chinese empire has come and gone. But as a continuum, as a\nthread, there has be -- there has been a paradigm there that basically says that you --\nyou -- you -- you diversify. You don\u2019t know -- do not get stuck in Judea. Sure, you\nmay fight the Romans, but everybody else who fought the Romans and stayed\nwhere they were, are gone.",
        "A: Yeah, and then you lose some.",
        "A: There\u2019s horrendous losses. There are horrendous losses in the process.",
        "A: They\u2019re part of the -- part of the --",
        "A: -- part of the thread.",
        "A: So what?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah --",
        "A: -- yeah, yeah, just milestones, that\u2019s all. That\u2019s all they are.",
        "A: Oh, sure. My relationship with the Holocaust Museum goes back to perhaps as\nearly as 1990 -- no, no, no, no, 1988, when -- 1988 when I gave a lecture at the\nHolocaust Museum on -- on the fact that the great lessons of the Slovak no --\nuprising was the fact that a Jewish brigade at the labor camp, the slave labor camp,\nmarched out as a bat -- armed battalion, as organized battalion and participated as a\nJewish organized military unit, although the -- the Jewish brigade in the British\narmy was organized in Tobruk in November of 1944, the Jewish brigade organized\nin Slovakia as a Jewish unit, goes back to August 29\", 1944. And I wanted to point\nout that -- that -- that unit, perhaps, is the first organized Jewish military unit that\nwent to war since A.D. 70. There was some interest on the part of the Holocaust\nMuseum, but in those days the Holocaust Museum was very much concerned about\ncrying about the enormity of the crime, Holocaust. The idea of fighting, Jews\nfighting and opposing by action, the actions on the part of the Germans was not\nhigh on the agenda, except there was a -- a researcher in the -- in the -- the\nHolocaust Museum, a Dr. Sybil Milton, who got very much interested in the\nsubject, and subsequently, when I was in Washington, I met with Dr. Milton several\ntimes, we had lunch together. And I tried to convey to you my sense of the\nHolocaust, namely that this was not necessary some evil maniac plot, but 1t was a\nhistorical evolution of a state machinery that went berserk. In other words, the\nNazis and Hitler unleashed the power of the state to its ultimate form of destruction.\nYou know, the state has always done pogroms and done injustice, and done all\nkinds of things, but here, the superiority of industrial organization and scientific\norganization, in fact, went to its ultimate conclusion, namely, we are just going to\nplan, methodically, to destroy people. And the enormity of the Holocaust really lies\nin the fact that -- in its engineering. In other words, it was planned as an engineer\ncould -- conscious process, where they were actually calculating the capacity of the\ncars, the capacity of the killing, how quickly can we burn them. In other words, they\napplied scientific management. And that is really the grossness, the horror of this\nthing, which I called the -- the bureaucratization of Holocaust. In other words, the\nbureaucratization of genocide. And the point that I was raising was that with\nadvanced information technology, the state can, through control of people, and\neliminating privacy in the future, basically grind masses of people to destruction. In\nother words, endemic in the structure of modern civilization, of industrialization, 1s\na capability of massive destruction, by means out of anatomic weapons. Sybil\nMilton was very, very much taken by it. I then subsequently provided to the\nHolocaust Museum, a collection of documents which I assembled, my sister\nactually helped with it, which showed methodically how the various laws were used\nin Slovakia to gradually strip an innkeeper, who was a veteran from World War I,\nand who received special license to be an innkeeper and how that was taken away,\nand this was taken away and the fur coats was taken, and radio was taken, and so\non, until you finally got rid of the innkeeper altogether and then gassed him. And I\ngave a collection of something like 30 documents, where the wife actually got a\nreceipt for the husband. In other words, the bureaucracy worked with perfection and\ncompleteness and everything was legitimate and everything was signed and\neverything was covered by law. It was passed by a duly elected parliament. And\nthen, of course, Sybil said, yeah, but where do computers come into this thing? And\nI said, well I don\u2019t know, but when I look at this succession of how Mr. Flak got\neliminated, I can see a computerized society doing it much more efficiently, much\nmore expeditiously, without any errors. Sybil then went away. A month later Sybil\ncalls me up and say, I have something interesting for you. She sends to me in the\nmail, copies of three pages from some kind of German documentation, which shows\na punch card, and shows a picture of what\u2019s called a Hollerith, Deutsche Hollerith\nmachine, and says, could you tell me what it is? And -- and of course I said, surely,\nthis 1s -- this is a machine that is being used, using census data in order to make sure\nthat all the Jews and their property is properly filtered out so that you can schedule\nthe Jews to destruction. And she said, you know, we are building a -- a Holocaust\nMuseum, it\u2019s all crying and weeping, and what have you, but there\u2019s nothing in\nthere about this concept of the grindstone of the bureaucracy actually being an\nengine of the Holocaust. And she said, you know, it would be very interesting to be\nable to prove that the Germans actually used computers in tabulating mach -- she\ndidn\u2019t distinguish between tabulating machine and -- and I said, yeah, that would be\nvery interesting. I took the picture and send it to a friend of mine who 1s a retired\nIBM executive. She said, oh we tried it before, we asked IBM whether they had\nanything to do with providing tabulating machine to the Nazis, you know. I said,\nSybil, you must be kidding, you know. So I send it to this guy in Denver, he\u2019s\nretired, he looks at it, he says, oh, this is Dehomag number 325, you know. And\nyeah, the card says so and so Jew, and property and location and he\u2019s accounted for.\nSo Sybil says, you know what, we really would need this kind of thing on the\nexhibit in order to make the point. Could you get the Nazi machine? I said, you\nmust be kidding, you know, there\u2019s no such thing. Well, try anyway. So I sent out,\nbecause of my many connection -- you know, I am a collector, you know, you saw\nthat --",
        "A: -- I collect some stuff, you know that -- I love to go and look for things. And\nsomeday I\u2019m going to tell you some of the stuff that I was able to find. I mean,\nreally, I have a story behind each. See, I collected every item in here, I bought and\ncollected.",
        "A: Yeah. Well -- well, the museum -- the --",
        "A: -- Xerox Historical Museum of the Written Word. Well at any rate, I sent out a --\na letter saying -- to all the computer museums in the world, and there are four, you\nknow, do you have a Dehomag number 302? Oh no, we haven\u2019t got it. I said, well,\nif you find wa -- one of them, we really need it for a museum, could you -- could\nyou let me know? Well, the Berlin wall falls, three weeks later I get a phone call\nfrom the British museum, the engineering museum in -- in London on -- on -- on --\non -- next to the Imperial Museum. And they said, you know, somebody\u2019s offered\nus for sale, in Dresden, a Dehomag 302. I said, fine, can we buy it? Well, you know,\nthey -- they just -- they -- they -- they really would like to sell it for 2,000 dollars. I\nsay, go buy it. Well, then I go to the Holocaust Museum, oh, you know, this -- we --\nhow do we know it\u2019s authentic, what is this and this? I said, 2,000 bucks guys, be\nreal. Then they had to send somebody to -- to Germany to look at the machine, they\ndidn\u2019t know anything about the machine, they come back, yeah, there is such a\nmachine. It -- actually the air ca -- air -- th-the expense for -- was more than the\nmachine. Well, finally they buy the machine. The machine is shipped to the\nwarehouse in Baltimore where all of this stuff was being staged prior to being -- to\ncompletion of the building. This is before the building was done. They invite me to\ncome to authenticate the machine, and of course my friend in Denver tells me what\nto look at, what serial number and all of those things. I go and look at -- it\u2019s a\ngorgeous machine, just gor -- you know, only the Germans can make this fine\nmachine parts. It was a tabulator, it was a sorter, it was an input machine, the whole\nthing, whole shooting thing. I said, you know, this is -- this 1s just a beautiful thing.\nWell, would you please write something? So I wrote a script for the -- for the -- for\nthe -- for the display unit, called the bureaucratization of genocide. Well, it didn't go\nover very well with the Holocaust Museum. They ultimately put the three machines\non the exhibit, but they were taking too much space, so last time I know, they\nremoved two of them. I find -- I have a real bad feeling about the Holocaust\nMuseum, I just want you to know. Many of the people who are the biggest donor to\nthe Holocaust Museums are Jews who are survivors, who came to the United States,\nmade lots of money and are heavily funding the museum. You know, this is -- this\nis their guilt trip. I -- you know.",
        "A: Now I -- I may be overdoing it, but they really did not want to take it from the\nfact it\u2019s a crime to something that I see, it is something which has much broader\nconsequence for the future. And when you are telling kids about the Holocaust --\nwell they say, well Hitler was a bad guy. Well, when -- when do we gonna get\nanother Hitler? You know, it\u2019s all the Nazis and the Hitler.",
        "A: They don\u2019t educate, in my view, and I been to the Holocaust Museum twice, I\nspoke there. I look at -- I -- I ge -- I\u2019m on the mailing list and so forth, and I listen to\nElie Wiesel -- Elie Wiesel. The education in the information age is to beware of the\nabrogation of civil liberties, of the use of computers in the police system --",
        "A: -- which can be perverted, and that I don\u2019t see as a theme emerging from the\nHolocaust Museum. They don\u2019t want to touch it with a 10 foot pole.",
        "A: Yeah, they want to keep it as a feeling, well this is bad, this is bunch of bad\nguys, and all of those things. To me it is much more endemic. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s the -- the\nstate going mad, like in Pol Pot\u2019s time, I mean. Like under Mao.",
        "A: Can happen to any society, any time.",
        "A: And that moral lesson is not visible. And you might as well tell your sponsors\nthat, that I said so. Had to get it off my chest.",
        "A: Yeah. There was no way -- ma -- this is my commentary on the tenor and the\nmorality of the Holocaust Museum, and the lessons to the history. And one of the\nvery significant lessons of bureaucratization of genocide is the extremely small staff\nthat Eichmann had in order to execute massive amount of people. Eichmann and his\npeople, in a typical German fashion, were methodical bureaucrats first. So when\nArons -- Ar-Arons says about the banality of -- of -- of -- of the crime, he -- she\nreally does not get into the analytic mech -- mechanism of how this 1s done. It was\ndone, and I\u2019ve studied it, in a very organized, methodical method which leveraged\nthe machinery of the state, of the police, of the [indecipherable] of the judicial\nsystem, to commit the crime. When you really look at it from a legal standpoint,\nthere was no crime. Duly elected --",
        "A: -- democratically elected majority people, all voting in favor, in --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "A: Well, the --",
        "A: -- the Holocaust, at least the way I witnessed it, with the evidence available to\nme, although there were exceptions, particularly in the conquered lands, where in\nRussia, in -- where there was no legality at all, it was -- th-that was just plunder and\nmur-murder and what have you. But I\u2019m talking about western Europe, so-called\ncivilized western Europe, which includes our good friends the French, and -- and --\nand the Belgians, and the Germans and particularly the Austrian and the Slovaks,\nand the Hungarians and the Romanian, etcetera, etcetera, all did that in a very\nmethodical, prescribed, legitimate method, which means that they could argue that\nthey were proceeding through the sovereign rights of the state to take measures\nwhich they considered necessary to defend their social and economic well being. By\nthe way, that argument has been made. Now, with that structure, and then\nharnessing the power of the state, they were then able to execute a crime in a very\nwell structured method, which took advantage of all the best managerial know-how,\nsuch as being taught in schools today, of management. In fact, people get MBAs in\nsubjects which are closely related to that, except they apply to cattle and apply to\nkrispies, and hamburgers and what have you. Now, the evidence for this thing really\nis in what\u2019s called a transaction cost. The transaction costs for executing this crime\nwere very low, because this was largely self funding. For instance, the Slovak paid\nthe Germans, as you know, 10 marks for every body for resettlement and\nreeducation fees. The confiscations were self funding. Eichmann actually produced\na profit and loss statement, because through the confiscation and so forth, they were\nable to get a large amount of gold into the coffers of their Reich system, although\nsooner or later the corruption crept in, but nevertheless, it was run as a business.\nThe business was based on the fact that a very small number of people at corporate\nheadquarters, with some enforcement, could take care of problems which involved\nthe marshalling and destruction of millions of people. And one of the key elements\nin that process was the utilization of the Jewish organizations in co-opting the\nJewish organizations into the liquidation process. The deportation lists from my\ntown, Trencin, that I used to trace the authenticity of who was a victim or not, were\nmade by the Jewish [indecipherable], by the Jewish organization. The supervision\nand the guidance of, you know, going to this car, and going to this car, was done\nmostly by Jews with the enforcers onlooking except when there were some\nhooligans who did some stupid things, you know, like beat up people and so forth.\nBut most of it was done in a fairly organized fashion. So now comes the Holocaust\nMuseum, and you have a list of Holocaust survivors. And then you have a list of\nHolocaust survivor donors. And then you have interviews with these donors who\nare being awarded this or that, and being treated to this or that dinner. And then you\nhave the Los Angeles chapter, and then you have the New York chapter, etcetera,\netcetera. Well, these people get up and make a speech and they say how they\nsuffered in Auschwitz, and in what have you. Now it turns out that none of them\never give away when they went to Auschwitz. None of them. They never do. This is\none thing -- by the -- in many of my inquiries, and I will tell you some stories also\nhow this [indecipherable] -- many of these people, by innuendo and implication esp\n-- espe -- especially as to the date of the way, how the destruction was done, are\nclearly 1942 inmates. Now please tell me --",
        "A: Yes. Please tell me how can anybody survive Auschwitz from \u201942 to --",
        "A: -- the spring -- to liberation, which is early spring of 1945, without being a kapo?\nSo the money they\u2019re giving is guilt money, it\u2019s tainted money, it\u2019s immoral money,\nit\u2019s bad money. And they influence the -- the tenor of what I see -- I haven\u2019t been to\nthe Holocaust Museum now for about seven years, maybe they changed the\nexhibits. But it is -- the morality, you see, the morality of that thing, which is really\nthe underlying issue and the guidance for people to think about the future is not\nobvious, or not apparent. It\u2019s not even discussed. Now, the morality of course, is in\nYad Vashem, where they have the Righteous, and th-that\u2019s a different thing. But to\nme the Holocaust Museum is --",
        "A: But without the morality, that\u2019s --",
        "A: -- individual -- you see -- see -- see --",
        "A: You see, that gets you into individual psychology of individual people. When\nyou are going to teach about the Holocaust, children, and if you\u2019re looking into the\ninformation society of the 21%\u2018 and 22 century -- you know, those museum has\nways of staying around for a long time.",
        "A: Something that 1s the guts of the issue, in terms of relevance to the future is not\nthere.",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yes, absolutely.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right, e-except the Bosnian war 1s really not analyzed in terms\nof -- in my terms of reference. It was again the state machinery -- in this particular\ncase the military machinery, which is the most dangerous machinery. See, the\nGermans were much more refined, they never used the military for this purpose.",
        "A: I mean, the Bosnians and the Serbs --",
        "A: -- were just very crude. I mean, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- you -- you know, that\u2019s\nvery crude. Now --",
        "A: And -- and those are very important, you see, the taxonomy of genocide varies.\nYou have a Mao Tse-Tung, very sophisticated, harnessing the young pioneers to\nengage in genocide, but actually mobilizing a section of the communist party to\nexecute. Then you have Pol Pot, okay? Then you have the very interesting situation\nin Indonesia. There is a whole taxonomy of different forms. There is a life form out\nthere called genocide, that has a set of indicators which should be used as an way of\nalerting society, so that society can distinguish it. See, one of -- part of the problem\nwith the genocide was that the society in \u201938 - \u00b039 did not discriminate, did not\ndistinguish it, and the Jewish organizations were used as way of distorting and not\nclarifying what was really happening. We knew, for instance, what Auschwitz was,\nwhat [indecipherable]. The Jewish -- we had two people come from Auschwitz, and",
        "A: To Slovakia.",
        "A: Yeah. So that was known at the end of 1943. Had that been known and broadcast\nby the Jewish community, more Jews would have taken a different view. They\ndidn\u2019t. The thing was hushed up.",
        "A: Don\u2019t rock the boat. Keep low. You might offend somebody. So, you know, if\nyou really want to listen to Paul Strassmann, my lesson for the Holocaust, I mean,\nthere\u2019s a whole different story to be told, in terms of its real events, to the Holocaust\nMuseum.",
        "A: But I\u2019m not sure they want to hear it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. The whole taxonomy, structure and dynamics of the Holocaust has to deal\nwith going back to options. I-I wrote a paper and gave a series of lectures which\nwere very 0 -- people were very unhappy about it. I pointed out that in 1944, the\nprobability of surviving the eight month remaining for the remainder of the war,\nmuch greater if you fought than if you went to the concentration camp. In other\nwords, there were two work camps in Slovakia, one in Sered, one in Novaky. The\none in Novaky marched a battalion with a survival rate of 70 percent. Sered was\ndone -- run by religious Jews. Well, maybe we\u2019ll negotiate our way, maybe it\u2019s not\nthere, maybe we don\u2019t go on this transfer, maybe we\u2019ll go to the next transfer.\nAlways bargaining. See, you were bargaining, see the -- you were bargaining with\nevil.",
        "A: The bargaining with evil. There comes a point where you don\u2019t bargain with\nevil, you see, because you are out of choices. Because the evil will not give you any\nchoices. And so the probability, the morbidity rate of those was 95 percent. So you\nknow, you\u2019re now dealing with statistics and with odds, and with orientation. You\nknow, you had six million Jews with lots of money in 1938, let\u2019s go and take a hike.\nYou know, we could have gone to Madagascar. We could have gone to all kinds of\nother places. Again, I am talking about the survival rates.",
