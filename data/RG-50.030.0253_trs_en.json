        "Q: Hi. Tell me... Uh, give me your name and when you were born.",
        "A: All right. I'm Curtis R. Whiteway. And I was born in Newburyport, Mass[achusetts], in\n1925. November 3rd.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about yourself, and your advent into the Army. And, uh, then we can talk\nabout your career in Germany.",
        "A: All right. In 19...the December 1943, I was drafted, uh, into the, uh, Army. And then, uh, uh,\nwe're at Fort Devens, Mass[achusetts].' And then, uh, couple of days later, taken to Fort\nKnox, Kentucky, for, uh, my major training in the armored forces. I continued on then, uh,\nafter graduating there. Instead of going into the armored, uh, division, they took a group of\nus, uh, that were apparently high in the records of, uh, achievement; and they sent us to\nSouth Carolina, to the Rangers, where we received 19 weeks of very intensive training.",
        "Q: Then you went overseas?",
        "A: Then we went, uh, to, uh, Camp Maxey, Texas, and joined the 99th Division. Uh, there we\nwere supposed to train a lot of the troops, and so on. And we went immediately over to\nEngland (clearing throat) by way of Boston. So from England, well, we trained for awhile.\nInvasion training. And then, uh, very shortly, why, we land...we went across the channel in\nLSTs and landed at Le Havre.\u201d And we had a little bit of skirmishes there; but, uh, we moved\ninland, uh, into Belgium. And then we relieved the 9th Infantry Division on line, in uh...1in\naround the area of Li\u00a2ge [Flem: Luik], Belgium.",
        "Q: And then, what happened after that?",
        "A: All right. Uh...uh, of course, we were totally green. We had a lot of experience, uh, there 1n,\nuh, training, but, uh, totally green to combat. And, uh, about a month and a half later, uh, on\nDecember 16th at dawn, the Germans attacked us with, uh, uh, over 10 to | of their prime\nGerman SS troopers, Panzer Grenadiers, the, uh, German, uh, paratroopers, and so on. And\njust simply overwhelmed us on what we now call \"Hell's Corner.\" And, uh, like, uh, my\ncompany, uh, of--as I understand now--of approximately 216 men, there were only 29 of us\nsurvived. And then, uh, we, uh, managed to hold the line. We wiped out the 3rd Panzer\nDivision\u2019--uh, with...with great help of our artillery, of course. And, uh, then, uh, within\n' Located near Ayer, Massachusetts.\n* This would have been well after June 6, 1944, since Le Havre was held by German forces until\nSeptember 12, 1944 when it was captured by the British 1st Corps.\n\u00b0 This could not have been the 3rd Panzer Division, which served on the Eastern Front. Probably\nabout another month or so, why, we began getting replacements and were again ready for\ncombat and pushing into Germany through the Siegfried Line.\u201d",
        "Q: Tell us what happened after that.",
        "A: All right. We pushed, uh, into Germany, uh, forcing, naturally, the German army back,\nor...or Just wiping them out. Uh, I'm making it sound a lot easier than, uh, what actually\nhappened. But, uh, we...the main part is we came to, uh, Cologne [Ger: Koln]; and, uh, then\nswitched, uh, south to, uh, the...one of our armored divisions had captured a bridge now\nknow as the Remagen Bridge. We were immediately pulled out of the fighting in Cologne,\nand pulled south. And my battalion was the first, uh, of the 99th Division to arrive there. And\nwe went over the bridge that night, under very heavy fire, took the [Epellolai (ph)] on the\nother side--uh, which is a mountain there--and held it and until other troops could get up\nthere. And we pushed inland, and made what is known as a bridgehead. It was tn this\nbridgehead that we first came upon our first concentration camps.",
        "Q: Tell us about that.",
        "A: All right. The army (clearing throat) had never, uh, informed of ...us of anything about the\nconcentration camps. Uh, so that we were not mentally prepared for anything. Uh, the first\nfew camps, uh, that we came to, we were ordered--being combat troops, our mission was to\nfight and destroy the German army. So we would part, and go around these huge camps, and\nre-engage on the other side. In doing this, we came by...many times, the...one of the gates.\nAnd here, uh, uh--as I've learned or put together in the last few years--a handful of men\nwould normally be detailed to go into the camps, unchain the people who were chained and\nso on, and release the prisoners. Uh, the rest of all the combat troops would, as I say,\ncontinue engaging the German troops. As we went by the gates, we would see, uh, handfuls,\nor, uh, quite a few prisoners--or, uh we now call them, survivors--would come outside the\ngates [and] be standing there as we were passing by, either on foot or on trucks and tanks.\nAnd they would be waving to you, and they'd be all smiles. And if they got a chance, they'd\ncome over to you and hug and kiss you and shake hands. And this threw us off guard.\nBecause now, when we saw all these smiling faces, we assumed that they were alright. And\nwe just kept on going. The only ones to see any of the horrors in the camps, not... For us, not\nrealizing that many of them were not physically able to come out of the gates.",
        "Q: The Germans had already left the camps?",
        "A: The Germans normally, uh, in my experience, uh, would normally stay in the camps--the\nhe is referring here to the 9th Panzer Division, which served in the Battle of the Bulge in December\n1944 and suffered heavy losses there.\n* English name for the Westwall, a fortified line along the western border of Germany.\nguards--until we were approaching one of the gates. And they would withdraw out the back,\nuh, side, uh, opposite side, of wherever we were approaching. And what I...we've learned is\nthat they would normally take selected prisoners--usually Jewish people--uh, out the back\ngates, and keep on taking them in forced marches, uh, further into Germany or into Austria.\nAnd they would continue then to try to kill them as fast as they could do that. Uh, we hadn't\nlearned that at this point, uh, there. And so it was a very tragic thing, uh, to be able to permit\nthe Germans to...to keep on murdering people like that. (Clearing throat) They usually beat\nthem to death with rifle butts or...or bayonets, or just shoot them. But they...we also learned\nthat they had to be very careful about not using too much ammunition, because they were\ngoing to need that to fight us. So we continued on fighting, continued past the camps--except\nfor our handfuls of men that would go in.",
        "Q: There many camps like that?",
        "A: There were many camps like this. And we continued pushing north into Germany, until we\ncame to a city called Giessen [Giessen is due east of Remagen]. And in Giessen--or in that\narea--uh, my group was Selected to, uh...at nighttime, swim the river [this would have been\nthe Lahne River], come in quietly behind the German guards and the engineers at the\nbridges, and quietly take them off. And then cut the, uh, cords to all the explosives on the\nbridges. At dawn, or about dawn, then our entire regiment or battalion came in on trucks and\ntanks quickly; and were inside the city before the Germans knew it.\u201d Now, I was ordered to\ntake my men and go down one of the main streets. We fought from building to building,\nhouse to house. But in this area was very different from many of the other areas in, uh...1n\nEurope--and in particular, in Germany. Because we came upon the most appalling odor that I\nhave ever smelled. And there's no way to really describe it. Uh, except to bring out the, uh,\nimportant points that, by now, in northern Germany like this we're all very experienced\ncombat troops. We had seen all kinds of human misery. We were used to the odor of death,\nof, uh, flesh--burning flesh--and all this kind of thing. But this odor was, uh, very distinct,\nand very strong. We had to find heavy cloth in the buildings that we were fighting in, from\nthe German soldiers; and hold it over our faces while we're trying to shoot. Because this...",
        "Q: How large was this city?",
        "A: Uh, the city was quite large. Uh, I would compare it, uh, with the size of Malden,\nMass[achusetts]. Of, uh, say around a 100,000.\u00b0 Somewhere on that idea. And, uh, as we\npushed down on this particular area, why, the odor got worse. And we finally came to a big\nstone wall, and a huge ancient wooden gate. Upon top were barbed wire, machine gun nests.\nThere was no soldiers there, at this point. Uh, apparently, each time we finally approached\n\u00b0 Giessen was captured March 28, 1945.\n\u00b0 Giessen had a population of 31,601 at the end of the war; by the 1980s its population had grown\nto 76,374.\nthe camps that the guards in the camps would not engage us. They would run instead. Unlike\nthe Wehrmacht or the regular infantry. So, when we came to the gate, we knew we had some\nkind of a prison there. And we put TNT against the gate, and we blew it in. Ran inside,\ndispersed to cover each other, and engage what we knew would be the, uh, the Death['s]-\nHead--from experience, the Death['s] -Head SS troopers\u2019 uh, that normally ran these camps.\nAnd this camp was called Hadamar.* Uh, it turned out to be, uh, an extermination camp, not\na concentration camp.\u201d Uh, why I say that is because they weren't keeping the prisoners there\nfor long periods of time and starving them and tormenting them and torturing them and\nterrorizing them, like in other camps that we would go into. As we burst into the camp and\nspread out, I saw in front of me a row of barracks. Wooden, one-story barracks. In front of\nthe barracks, at that point, was a large group of...what we called in those days \"slaves,\" for\nlack of any other word. Now we call them survivors. And they were standing there totally\nshocked at, of course, the explosion of the gate being blown in, these strange men in strange\nuniforms running in. And they didn't know who we were. Uh, I since learned, of course, that\nthe Germans kept all the information, news, away from them. So that...thus not ever giving\nthem any hope of surviving. I knew that these people were of no danger to us; so I\nimmediately, being combat, turned my attention to the left, to the buildings. And I ordered\nmy men to start going through the buildings and start cleaning them out--in other words,\nengaging the German soldier, the SS troopers. Uh, at that point, one of my men came for me.\nAnd he asked me...he says, \"You'd better come with me.\" And he had a voice...his tone of\nvoice was very serious. I followed him across the yard to a building; and as I, uh, observed,\nthe building--to my best memory now--was a masonry building. The windows were all\nsealed up. Outside, as I can remember now, was, I believe, eight automobiles, all up on\nblocks. In other words, they were in permanent position. The wheels had been taken off. The\nexhaust were piped in through the wall of that building. And I... We couldn't really\nunderstand what this was. We went inside the door; and there's a couple of my other men\nthere, standing there waiting for me. In the room....there was nobody 1n there, other than my\nown men. But there was human excretion, vomit, urine, blood all over the room. At this\npoint we're looking around, somebody had asked me what was going on. And I really had no\nidea. I did not understand. None of us did. One of the men went over to the far wall, uh, as I\nremember to my left. And there were shower heads and faucets all over the wall. He turned\nthem on. He called out to me; and he says, \"What the Hell's going on here?\" And I looked\nover questionly. And he said, \"There's no water.\" And I just shook my head. I didn't know.\n\"Ger: SS Totenkopfverbande.\n* According to US military records, the 99th Infantry Division was in the immediate vicinity north\nof Hadamar on March 27, 1945.\n* Also: \"Facility E.\" A killing center utilized by the Euthanasia program from January 1941 until\nliberation in 1945. Served as a replacement for the Grafeneck euthanasia center, which closed in\nDecember 1940. According to Arolsen, the exterminations carried out here were of the mentally ill\nand patients with TB and took place mainly from 1944-1945. According to camp records, more than\n10,000 people were killed.\nAnd just about this point.... And, of course, you can imagine what the odor was like in this\nroom. It was terrible. Uh, at that point, another man in a doorway motioned for us to come\nout into the back room. As we entered the back room, the room was filled with benches\nand...and, uh, uh, tables. And on the tables, there was thousands of gold wedding rings. And\nthere were diamond rings--uh, engagement rings, or whatever you want to call them in\nEurope. Uh, there was piles of human teeth with gold filling. These were all being separated.\nAnd then it was obvious that somebody was tn there counting them, and separating them.\nWe still just began to understand; but really didn't under....understand what was happening in\nthis camp, at that point. Uh, we went outside into the, uh, yard again. Only this is on the back\nside of the building, more or less. And here in front of me, I could see huge piles of human\nhair. I could see...as the Germans did everything very neatly, there were piles of boots, shoes,\nsuitcases, eyeglasses. And I stood there looking at the eyeglasses. And I couldn't imagine\nhow many thousands of people those eyeglasses represented, just sitting there in a huge pile.\nTo my left was hay wagons--four-wheel hay wagons and two-wheel push carts, which were\ncommon in Europe. Only, these wagons all contained nude bodies. They were separated; but\nthere was men, women, children, and even babies. All nude, all dead, all piled as high as\nthey basically could pile them on these wagons. And I remember going over and looking\nat...fairly close. Especially at some of the children--which...which was appalling to us. They\napparently had been just taken out of the building we just left, and been gassed. Uh, we...at\nthat point, one...another man came to me. And here again he said, \"You'd better come with\nus.\" And we followed them into another building behind. In the room, as we entered, here\nwas bodies thrown at random on the floor. On the far wall.... And, of course, you can\nimagine the odor was absolutely terrible in this place. Uh, on the, uh, far wall was a battery\nof ovens. Big ovens. Uh, I never did count the ovens, but they were on fire. Some of the\ndoors were open. There were bodies in the ovens, still burning. Uh, we were so shocked.\nAnd now we were beginning to understand that there was...this was some kind of an\nexecution camp. Or as we now call, extermination camp. Uh, we left the...that room, and\nwent out into the, uh, yard again. And still my men were scattering all over the place, uh...of\ncourse, looking for the German soldier; but now finding more and more, uh, things in the\ncamp. I turned my attention back to the original group of the \"slaves,\" as we called them\nthen. And as I walked across the yard, I called out to them. And I noticed...for...for one thing,\nof course, the condition of these people. As I can remember, they were all men. And now I\nassume that they were like a burial detail to handle all the bodies. Uh, but they were in a\nhorrible condition, uh, of starvation, of disease. The bodies...there was no flesh in their\nbodies. They were just skin...actual skin and bones. Their body odor was terrible. Uh,\nthere...and no hair, or literally no hair, on their bodies. Their eyes sunken way back in their\nheads. And as I approached them, I also saw the yellow star of David, uh, on their clothing.\nAnd coming from Boston and all the ethnic, uh, areas, that I understood that they were Jews.\nI called out to them as I approached them. I says, \"Does anybody speak English?\" And\nfinally, one man spoke up, uh, very much like a zombie; but he answered me, \"Yes,\" in\nEnglish. So I addressed him, uh, personally. And I came over to him; and I looked at him,\nand I said, \"We are American soldiers. It's all over. Do you understand what I'm saying to\nyou?\" And he stood there frozen in place. He wasn't looking at me. He was looking over my\nshoulder; and he was apparently looking at my men, who were still...some of them running\nthrough the buildings, uh, there. And then first thing...he wouldn't change his expression on\nhis face, but tears started coming down his face. And then he started to cry. And he started to\nsob. And then he started to sob his heart out; and he fell to the ground on his knees. And he\njust cried his heart out. And I stood there, standing there watching him, and waiting. And\nafter awhile, he regained his composure. And then he stopped crying. And then he spoke in\nYiddish. Which I had heard many times in the Boston area, and I recognized what it was.\nAnd then he told them that we were American soldiers. Now, at this point, there were other\nAmericans coming.\u201d And I could see over in the background, in other gates or other areas of\nthe camp, other Americans would come in. They began going through the hospital--because\nthis was a camp under the K-4 program,'' uh, where they were exterminating or cleansing\ntheir own nation, originally, and then went through many other peoples, uh, before they....\nAnd then they finally were exterminating the Jewish people, at this period of time that we\nwere there. And we then were ordered out of the camp to help re-engage the German\nsoldiers. And we left the other Americans in the camp. They saw many other things that I or\nmy group did not see. And then we...we continued fighting for that region. Uh, we pushed....\nThe best...",
        "Q: They were killing right up to the moment...?",
        "A: To the moment that we arrived there. Uh, which was something very, very hard to\nunderstand. Uh, but, as I mentioned, that, uh, in the camps we learned that they were taking\nprisoners out the back gates to continue that time of killing what they called \"prime\nprisoners.\" And it took us a while longer before we would learn that fact, and then begin to\noutmaneuver them. (Clearing throat) And we continued pushing through northern Germany,\nto Kassel [approximately 60 miles northwest of Giessen]. And, uh...I believe that was about\nthe deepest penetration; uh, when we were ordered to hold up. And then, uh, this was getting\ninto an area that was declared by [the] Yalta Agreement\u2019 that would be Russian territory. So\nthat now, other troops would come in and take our place and hold this line. We were pulled\nout; and we would turn and head south--toward Nuremberg [Ger: Nurnberg], Frankfurt[-am-\nMain], Wurzburg, and that region. Going down through that area, we came to quite a number\nof other camps. Uh, there is no understanding in my mind, or...as to the difference in the\ncamps. At that time of...of uh, the war, uh, there were slave labor camps. Many of them. Uh,\nthere were, uh, of course, concentration camps--which I really wasn't realizing at that point--\nuh, that we were going into. Uh, sometimes, I would only just penetrate. Uh, we came to a\ncamp called Ohrdruf,\u2019\u201d as best as I can determine to this day. And now I'm starting to\n'\u00b0 This was probably the US 2nd Infantry Division, which was in Limburg-an-der-Lahn to the\nsouth of Hadamar on March 27, 1945.\n'' The actual designation for the Euthanasia program was \"Operation T4.\"\n'* An Allied Summit Conference took place in Yalta from February 4 to 11, 1945.\n\u00b0 Subcamp of Buchenwald; located in the province of Thuringia. Established November 1944\nand apparently liberated by American troops on April 4, 1945.\nremember more...just recently starting to remember more and more about this; putting\ntogether other facts from my own division, where we were at that time. But, as I can\ndetermine now, it was Ohrdruf.'* And it was a small camp. We came right to the middle,\napparently, of the camp itself--of the outside. There was nothing there in front of us but\nbarbed wire. Behind the barbed wire, we could see into the camp. And there were bodies\nlaying all over the place. There were some small buildings and so on. The odor, again, was\nterrible here. Uh, I radioed in to the captain, uh, that we had come to the barbed wire and\nsome kind of a camp. He ordered all of us to turn left, and go around the camp in that\ndirection. Apparently, one of the other companies was on our other flank would go the other\ndirection. As we walked along the barbed wire and we kept looking in. Of course, we were\nin a very depressed mood, uh, looking at...at all these bodies laying there. We could see\nsome were still alive, were still moving, even if they were only twitching, some of them.\nAnd we passed a gate. Whether it was the main gate, I don't know. But we passed a gate.\nAnd at that point, now other...all the rest of the company was, uh, was progressing the same\nway. Some [of] them--uh, American soldiers of our own, uh, outfit, and probably of our own\ncompany--were already inside the camp. Only a few. And, I believe, two men came over\ntoward us and started waving us anxiously to come in to help them. So I radioed to Captain\nPat,\u201d or the company command, and told them that we, uh, uh, were requested [to] uh, help,\nuh, there. He gave us permission to move into the camp. So as far as I know that only my\nsquad turned and went into the uh...to the camp itself. As we were walking in, as I say, there\nwas bodies laying literally all over the place. And as I can remember, here again on my left\nas I was coming in, there was some buildings. And there was a gallows. And I can't\ndistinguish in my mind at this point whether there was just one or more. And I believe there\nwas more gallows. But there was no rope. It was...it was wire that they were using for a\nnoose. Uh, during the short stay in there, one of the survivors--and there weren't very many\nas far as I know--had explained to me what the Germans were doing. There were pile...piles\nof bodies all around the gallows. And they were taking the prisoners, and making...forcing\nthem to stand under the gallows. They would tighten the noose around and then they would\nadjust it up on top. So they would pull them up and stretch them, so only their toes would\njust barely touch the ground. And they left them that way. And as I can understand, as I\nremember the prisoner telling me--or the survivor--that it took something like about 15\nminutes for them to die that way. And, of course, this was very disgusting to us, at that point.\nWe were also looking... trying to look at other things that we were seeing in the camp.\nThe...we were starting to wander among the bodies, to see if we could help some of them.\nAnd each one that I came to, I knew just by looking at them that they were beyond help. Uh,\neven...even...we didn't have any medics in our company. They had all been shot in the head\nby the snipers. And what little medicine we had.... Well, [there] was no medicine. All we had\nwas bandages, by that time there. Uh, I came to...now as I remember, uh, a nude woman.\n* Tt is by no means certain, but US military records indicate that the 99th Infantry Division could\nhave been in this vicinity between April 17 and April 21, 1945.\n'\u00b0 Identified by Mr. Whiteway as Captain William Patterson of Miami, Florida.\nAnd it was apparent she was pregnant. And I was standing there looking... And this 1s\nsomething terrible to me, in my mind. She had a rope tied around her legs. But it wasn't in a\nposition where apparently the prisoners or somebody had tied ropes on her ankles and\ndragged the body out. And it confused me. Why would the rope be tied around her legs?\nAnd I was standing there pondering that, uh, fact, when one of the survivors in that camp\nquietly came over beside me. And he began talking very softly. And he told me; he says she\nwas pregnant. And as the baby was being born, the SS troopers took her clothing off--or\nripped her clothing off, I think, is the way he put it--and then tied a rope tightly around her\nlegs. And then left her and the baby to die that way; because, naturally, the baby couldn't be\nborn. And, of course, that upset me very, very much. In fact, I've had some...some rather\nterrible nightmares over it. And I remember then getting orders to leave the camp, while\nothers.... There were now more apparently of the...the supporting troops were coming in.\nAnd they were coming in the camp, and they were spreading out with some medics. I can\nremember seeing some medics with their Red Cross armbands on. And we left; and we\nrejoined our company. And we began, again, in the combat. And we pushed south again.\nThere were other camps that we came to. Other men went in and so-called \"liberated\" the\ncamps and the prisoners. Uh, released them, or whatever. I can remember seeing just tidbits\nof different camps like that. And we kept on going. And now the German Army was\ndisintegrating, so that they would disappear and pull back as much as 50 miles in... And, uh,\nthen set up lines. We would come out of the woods. We'd come out of the buildings, and\ncome onto the, uh, roads, and walk the roads until the points we'd re-engage the Germans.\nAnd we'd spread out and re-engage them again. Uh, in doing this, we came, uh, into the area\nof, as I now know as, Bavaria. And we were going up a mountain. And up at the top, all ofa\nsudden...my two scouts were always up in front of me. And I was always the third man. Uh,\nthe rest of the men were behind me. Uh, the two scouts signaled, and they hit the ground. I,\nuh, signaled for all the men to hit the ground, and...uh, for cover. And then I crawled up to\nwhere the two scouts were. And they pointed up ahead; and I could see some men up\nthrough the woods--quite a distance from us--that were running from tree to tree. They were\nvery skittish. And observing them, uh, I assumed that they were of no danger, that they were\nnot German soldiers. Because they had no helmets and they had no rifles. Uh, they... First, I\nthought they were women; because they had a long robe on them that went all the way to the\nankles. Now, I've been able to understand that what they were was prisoners that were\nallowed out of that camp that we were going to come to. Uh, and they were on perhaps burial\ndetail. Uh, but the idea of the long gown or dress on them was that they were hobbled, so\nthey could not run. The bottom [of] the uniform or dress was very close at the ankle. But\nwhat they were doing there was they were hiding behind the tree. There was quite a few of\nthem. And they'd look around, just like rabbits; they were so scared. Then, one by one, they\nwould get up, pull up the skirts above their waist. And we kinda snickered, because here they\nwere...we realized they were men. They were totally nude. The only thing they had for\nclothing on was this, uh, dress. And they would hold it above their waist; and they'd run and\nthen dive behind another tree and drop their skirt. And as I say, it was kind of humorous, at\nthat point. But they [were] working their way to close to us. So I signaled for the men to\nskirmish and get ready for a gun fight, yust in case. And we were all camouflaged, and, uh,\nso on. Then these men worked their way fairly close to us. And all of a sudden, I stood up\nand I challenged them. I almost scared the living daylights out of them. They didn't know we\nwere there. They dived in behind the trees. And when they did, some of them started to cry,\nstarted to beg. Uh, one man finally came out. And I kept telling him in broken German, uh,\n\"We are American solders.\" And, uh, tried to get them to understand that, uh, we were not,\nuh, going to harm them. And one man, in particular, came crawling out on his elbows and\nhis knees--almost like a caterpillar. And he crawled quite fast. And he [was] working his way\ntoward me; and then he turned around and put his hands up in the form of a prayer, and kept\nbegging me in some foreign language, apparently not to kill him. And I tried to console him\nand uh...here again, tell him that we are Americans. He finally, suddenly, under...\ncomprehended what I was trying to say. And he look...looked up, and said something in a\nforeign language. But... \"American?\" And I shook my head yes. He went like a machine gun\nacross the floor, came over to...uh, in front of me. Now, he was breaking down. And he was\nshivering all over his body; and he started kissing the ground and started kissing my shoes,\nor my boots. And uh, then he wrapped his arms violently around my legs. And he was crying\nhis heart out. And then he turned around; and he spoke in a foreign language to the others to\ncome, and that it was safe. Here again, these prisoners were just like the ones back at\nHadamar--in a terrible, terrible shape. So I asked them in German, uh...uh, \"Wo ist der\ndeutsche Soldaten?\"--\"Where is the German soldier?\" And they pointed down. We...\n(Clearing throat) I'll skip the rest of that part of the story, uh, to get to the better points. Uh,\nwe took them... I detailed one man to stay back behind, uh, and take them with us. And we,\nuh ...forward...made uh...uh, and went forward down the side of the mountain, then. Halfway\ndown the hill, we could hear a strange, crackling noise. And now we're getting the same odor\nthat we had smelled at Hadamar. Terrible odor. Only now, there was no cloth for us to hold\nover our faces. We suddenly came to a, uh...a big field in the middle of the forest, and right\nto the very edge. And I was standing there; and there was prisoners in front of me. And there\nwas three groups. One group was coming up with hay wagons with bodies on them. As I\nremember, most all of them had clothing on. Uh, this is a very important point. Because I\nlearned from President [Chaim] Herzog, uh, when I asked him, that \"Why were some nude\nand some others not?\" And he pointed out that, uh, the nude ones were usually Jews.\nBecause they believed in their religion that the worst thing that could happen to them was to\ngo to God in the nude. These prisoners, most of them were clothed, at that point. Or, the\nbodies on the wagons. And the prisoners were pushing the wagons up by hand. There was\nanother group at that point coming in from the forest carrying six-foot logs. The first group,\nin front of me, was taking the logs and laying them on the ground, side by side. Then they\nwere taking, uh, the bodies, and laying them across; and another row of bodies...uh, of logs, a\nrow of bodies. And building them up, uh, approximately as high as they could reach; but\napproximately seven, eight feet high. And we're standing there, all of us shocked. My own\nmen and these prisoners. They didn't know who we were. And I took a very close look at\nsome of the pyres of all these prisoners and all these dead bodies uh...uh, there. Many of the\npyres were on fire. And there were other pyres all over the field that were in all different\nstages of construction. And I was so shocked that I didn't talk to any of these prisoners. I just\nsignaled one man [to] go round them up and bring them all to me. And then I just simply\nasked them, \"Wo ist der deutsche Soldaten?\" And they pointed down. So we headed down.\nWe took the...those prisoners along with the others. Uh, the others I had detailed to go back\nbehind the lines with a, uh...I had a medic coming up to get them. Now, as we came down to\nthe bottom into the valley, I suddenly come to a road that was going across me. Off to the\nleft was some city. And most of my battalion was now throwing out artillery and throwing\nthe mortar shells in. They were attacking the city. So I turned my attention to my right. And\nhere was a huge camp. This was apparently the main road coming out of the city nght\nstraight into the main, uh, gate of the camp. There was two rows of barbed wire--electrified,\nas I can remember. And in fact, I'm sure; because we blew the transformer. There were\ntowers--guard towers--on the outside. I signaled; I sent some up in the guard towers, and\nthey disarmed the, uh, machine guns. Uh, a couple more men went over to the transformer.\nWe blew the transformer. Then we blew the gate in. And we ran in, dispersed as usual; and I\nran off to the left. I got...landed on my knees so I could watch my men, to make sure that\nthey were doing things right and covering each other. And in front of me... This camp was\ncalled--as I now know it--Dachau 3B.'\u00b0 Uh, this...in front of me was a series of barracks. At\nthe point that I landed on my knees, I could see behind some of the barracks; and there was a\ngroup of people. I believe that they were all male, but I'm not sure. They were all hanging;\nbut they [were] hanging in grotesque positions. They weren't hanging by the neck. I pointed\nto Hopper \u2019 and another man: \"Go over there and cut them down.\" So they left, uh, and I\ndetailed a couple more men to cover them. And at that point, I, uh, made a run for the\nbarracks in front of me, that was on a long, uh, ways to me. And the door was in the small\npart... end of the barracks. And in combat, you don't walk through a door. We dived through\nthe door. Goggleye\u2019\u00ae dived over the top of me; and we come up all ready to engage\nsomebody. Uh, as we got in, I was shocked; because there was nobody to fight. Instead, here\nwas a whole series--all along my left side, all the way down--of bunks. Uh...I believe, but I'm\nnot exactly sure...I believe there were three tiers. The prisoners were in the bunks--as many\nas they could get in them, all laying across the bunks. And we went into a, uh...a thing of\ntrying to tell them that we were American soldiers. \"Does anybody speak English?\" And\nfinally, one little, uh, Frenchman in the first row of bunk...uh, first bunk, uh, he asked me--in\nFrench, at first--1f I was an American soldier. And he began to comprehend. And I told\nhim.... And I couldn't understand why they wouldn't get out of the bunk...uh, or the beds.\nAnd, uh, so I told Goggleye, \"Go over there and find out what the heck's the matter with\nthem.\" And he told me...he said, \"They're chained at the ankle.\" So we come over and took\na look at them; and they had a heavy logging chain and some kind of an iron clamp on their\n'\u00b0 Tt is clear from documentation on the movements of the 99th Division and from supplementary\ninformation provided by Mr. Whiteway that \"Dachau 3B\" must have been a sub-camp of Dachau.\nResearch performed by Dr. Robert Kesting in the U. S. military records located at the National\nArchives in Suitland, Maryland, appear to indicate that the term \"3B\" was used to refer to the\nMuhldorf sub-camp of Dachau. This identification is consistent with U. S. military records, which\nindicate that Mihldorf was in the zone assigned to the 99th Infantry Division and affiliated units\n(i.e., 14th Cavalry Group/Armored and the 86th Infantry Division).\n'\u2019 Tdentified by Mr. Whiteway as Otis Hopper of Hartselle, Alabama.\n'\u00ae Tdentified by Mr. Whiteway as Ray Goggleye. Died in 1978.\nankles, every one of them. So I told, uh, the men, \"Find the locks.\" And on the end of the\nlocks... Not \"find the locks,\" but \"find the key.\" There was a big iron lock on each, uh, bunk.\nAnd he couldn't find the key; so I told him, \"Okay, shoot the locks off.\" And, of course, we\nhad to be careful where the bullet was going. But they shot...had to shoot the locks all the\nway down the barracks, through every series of, uh, bunks. And then all... instantly, all the\nprisoners were pulling the chains out quickly. And then they come over, and started hugging\nand kissing us and all that. We proceeded through the length of the barracks and went out the\nother door, and went into the second barracks. In the second barracks was exactly the same\nas the first barracks. But now, the prisoners from the first barracks were following me and\nmy men. We burst in the door. This time, we walked in the door. The only thing that was\ndifferent about this barracks was the condition of the prisoners. That they were on the verge\nof death. Here they were all chained. It was obvious that all food and water was shut off from\n[them]. And they were so weak. And the odor was terrible in this barrack. But they were so\nweak that they could not push themselves on their elbow. They were laying there and putting\none hand out; and they.... Instantly, everybody in the barracks were looking at me. And they\nwere begging in all kinds of foreign languages, apparently, for food and water. And\neveryone of us had different reactions. Now some of the guys were bumping up against me,\ncoming in and being shocked. And I remember Goggleye was down on his knees; and being\nan Indian, uh, and a Catholic, he was giving the sign of the cross and he was saying some\nprayers. Somebody behind me was swearing, and he was, uh, promising revenge. Uh, a\ncouple of the newer men turned around and went back out of the barracks; and they were\nvomiting. And every one of us, as I say, had a different reaction. And I got the strangest\nfeeling that I wanted to understand, somehow, what a German guard would feel like in this\nbarracks. So while everybody's standing there, uh... reacting, I slung my rifle over my\nshoulder and I stood up like a guard would do. And I marched all the way down the length of\nthe building, and turned around and came back, as a German soldier would. And alls I saw\nwas a whole handful of...hundreds of hands, literally, following me all the way up the\nbarracks and all the way back, begging. And they wouldn't stop begging. As I got back to the\nend again, the little Frenchman--who was now my self-appointed interpreter.... He could\nspeak five languages, as I remember. And he recognized somebody in the second bunk. And\nhe ran over to him; and he turned around. He was pointing to me, apparently tell him that we\nwere American soldiers and that it was all over. But his friend wouldn't put his hand down.\nHe still had his hand out. So I saw the Frenchman put, uh, his hand down like this. And the\nhand come up again. And he wouldn't stop. And he didn't even recognize his own buddy, his\nfriend. And it was a very, very emotional thing to...to see. And about at that point, we heard\nan awful ruckus outside. So we burst out both, uh, doorways of the barracks. And now, in\nthe yard that was totally empty before, was hundreds of people. A sea of humanity of the\nprisoners from this huge camp that was beyond us. And I remember seeing men and women\nnow here. And, uh, they... What had happened at this point, and what the ruckus was all\nabout, [was] that Bob Riggs\u201d and, I believe, Hopper had gone across the way to another\nbarracks.\n\u201d Identified by Mr. Whiteway and in documentation as PFC. Robert C. Riggs--Army Service No.\n42130776, SSN 069-01-0218--from Reno, Nevada. Died in 1978.",
        "Q: Your colleagues?",
        "A: These were my own men of my squad. I'm sorry. I should point there...there was\napproximately eight of us, at that point. And that's all I had left, uh, because of the, uh,\ncasualties. And Bob Riggs, uh, was bringing 20 German women guards out of this building,\nand marching them across the yard toward...to bring them to me. And, of course, the German\nwomen were... were military woman in uniform--very huge, powerful women. Well-fed;\nwhich appalled me at the time, because of the comparison of all these prisoners being so\nhorribly starved. Uh, it infuriated me to see these women so well fed at that point. And they\nmarched in a military, uh, rank of two toward me. And all these prisoners were trying to get\nto them and kill them. I don't believe they could really hurt them. Maybe they could. But\nthere was no.... Here again, there was no flesh in their bodies, no muscles or anything like\nthat. Uh, we ran out between them. And we held our rifles horizontal, and we tried to hold\nthis massive crowd back. At that point, uh, Whitey Hall\u2019\u2019--another squad leader--was going\nby the main gate. And he saw we were in trouble; and he brought his men in--approximately\neight or nine men--and he...they ran over and stood beside us, and tried to hold this crowd\nback. And I called out to...here again, Applegate--which was a very tall man--uh, and I told\nhim...I says, \"You take these women out of here, and get them out of the camp. Get them out\nof sight, so I can get control of the crowd.\" So he doubletimed the women out of the camp.\nLater, he come back and told me that he had marked them for war crimes. We were\nbeginning to understand there was something very wrong in this camp. So in the meantime,\nonce he got them out of sight, uh, then I started talking to the crowd. And I started telling\nthem, \"There's not going to be any killing. It's all over. You're free. Do you understand this?\"\nAnd the crowd, of course, the...they were so infuriated at seeing these women that,\nuh...the...there was electricity in the air. The hatred, the bitterness was there. And it was very\nobvious. And so I kept telling them that I'm not going to permit any killing, and, uh, that\n\"You're now free.\" But they couldn't understand this. And all of a sudden, in the crowd, uh,\nthere was a lot of people talking very excitedly to certain people, which it turned out to be,\nuh, people who could speak English. And so they would interpret these stories. And they\nbegan--I remember this very distinctly--one of the first stories. There was a Jewish woman\nright out in front of me. And you couldn't tell very, uh, well a difference of a woman from a\nman in those camps. They were so badly starved that a woman's breast is totally dissolved by\nher body. So there was no hourglass shape, or anything else. They had basically the same\nclothing as the other prisoners. Their hair was shaved off their heads. Usually, I could\nidentify by the tone of the voice whether they were male or female. And this woman spoke\nout; and--in English--and she started telling me. Uh, uh, she tried to describe what the\nGerman women--these German women-- were doing to these prisoners daily. That they\nwould take a group of perhaps 20 to 30 prisoners, and march them in two ranks to a specific\npart of the camp where the slit trenches--the toilets--were. And now as I mentioned, there's\nno flesh on their bodies, so they could not physically resist anything. One German woman,\n*\u2019 Identified by Mr. Whiteway as Staff Sargeant Alfred Hall of Winchester, Kentucky.\nas she described, would get down on her knees in front of a slit trench. She would reach up\nand grab two prisoners by the back of the head, force them down on their knees, force them\nto bend over. And then push their faces in human excretion, and hold them there until they\nsmothered to death. All the time laughing. As well as the other German women, who were\nsurrounding the prisoners. It was, uh...as she described it, was a daily game for them. In the\nmeantime, all the prisoners in the two ranks had to stand there and watch. But also they had\nto understand that each and every one of them, this was going to be done to them before they\nwere done. And they did this daily. Another person in the crowd called out. And they...uh, he\nwas yelling something about the dogs, the dogs. And then he began talking about how the\nGermans--guards--some of them would be going with packs of dogs. And at any time, they\nwould suddenly just point to one of the prisoners and command the dogs to attack that\nprisoner and tear him apart viciously. And as I have described to the kids in school today, as\nbad as it was, at least that person...it was over for that particular person. But for...the\npsychological thing that happened, and what the Germans were doing, was that they were\nputting the fear into all the others. So they had to think from then on that, \"When is it going\nto be my turn?\" The Germans, uh, we...we're learning that they could not simply just kill\nsomebody; but they had to humiliate and they had to terrorize, all at the same time. There\nwere many other stories. Another person in the crowd began calling out; and telling me,\n(clearing throat) here again, about the dogs. That in the winter, that the German guards\nwould select a prisoner--man or woman. They were given--him or her--a shower, a hot\nshower. And immediately take them out of the shower nude into the yard, in the snow storm;\nand command them to sit there, surrounded, uh, by killer dogs who were, uh,\nplaced...commanded to be on guard. And this prisoner... Now the guards would go back into\nthe barracks and watch. And this prisoner had a choice of sitting there in the snow storm and\nfreezing to death, or move and have the dogs attack them. And they went on telling me story\nafter story. And finally, I put my hands up. And I told them, I said, \"I've heard enough. I\ndon't want to hear anymore. It's all over.\" At that point, as I can remember, a little\nFrenchman in the crowd began to sing quietly, very hoarsely, the...\"\"La Marseillaise\"--the\nFrench national anthem. As he began singing, then some others--spotted all through the\ncrowd--began to sing along side of them. Apparently, they were French. Then, Bob Riggs\ncame for me. He said, \"You'd better come with me.\" So the rest.... These men.... Americans\nwere still standing there, now that we had laid our weapons down. Uh, but at that point, the\nsurvivors--as we now call them--began singing other songs that...that I didn't recognize.\nWe...Bob took me over to the barracks of the women guards. As we entered the room, the\nfirst room was a...what we in the army call a \"day room.\" This is where, normally in the\narmy, you would write letters, read, and relax. I was so shocked when I walked into this\nroom that I pretended I didn't see it. And I turned my attention; and off to my right was a\ndoorway and a hallway. And I quietly... And now there were some of my men, a couple of\nmy men coming in; there was a few survivors coming in. Nobody at this point was talking.\nAnd I went down the hallway, and I looked into the bedrooms. And each one of the\nbedrooms was neat, just like a normal army, uh, room. Orderly. All the uniforms were hung\nup on the left. The bunk was made in a, uh...uh, military, uh, fashion. Everything neat, and in\nits place. Nothing was wrong. And this puzzled me. And I turned around, and I walked back\nout of the...away from the bedrooms, and back into this room again. And in the room was\ntables all over the place. On the tables were lamps. Some of them had several lamps. The\nlamps themselves were made of human bones. The lamp shades were made of human skin\nwith tattoos. I recognized that immediately. I walked over and was starting to look at\ndifferent ones, and tried to comprehend what all these things I was seeing. The little French\nin...uh, uh, my interpreter now, the little Frenchman came over beside me. \"Monsieur, do\nyou understand what that is?\" At this point, his face was covered with tears. And I said,\n\"What...it looks like human skin with tattoos.\" He says, \"Yes.\" He says they would find a\nprisoner with the tattoos, and hold him or her down out here in the yard in front of us. And\nthen they, uh, would actually skin them alive, these women. He made a point that it was\nthese German women. They would actually skin them alive, somehow; and then hand the\nskin to the prisoners, who had to somehow cure and make these lamp shades. On the walls\nall around the room were picture frames, all different sizes, with human skin and tattoos. On\nthe shelves... Well, off to my right, a row of shelves along here, there were male sex organs\nhad been cut off. All different sizes. I believe it was Bob Riggs, but I'm not sure. One of my\nmen was down [at] the end, right by the hall door. And he just motioned to me, uh, with his\nhead. As I say, here [we] was not talking. And I walked down to him; and he nodded toward\nthis object that was in front of me. And I... can remember just thinking, \"A hairy blob. What\nis it?\" Because I was only 19 years old at this time. (Clearing throat) Uh, \"Monsieur...\" The\nlittle Frenchman had come up beside me again. He said, \"You know what that is?\" I said,\n\"No.\" And Bob didn't know what it was. He said, \"That's a woman's crotch. They held her\ndown, and cut that out of her. And preserved it, and put it right there.\" And I was pretty well\ndisgusted. There were sexual organs--breasts and everything else. Male and female sexual\norgans, all over the room, all preserved. There were human heads. There were bones of\ndifferent kinds, and... And by this time, my mind was becoming boggled with the things that\nwe were finding in this room. And I left... At that point somewhere, Little Cheeco--one of\nmy men, uh, an Indian--came for me. And he says, \"You'd better come with me, again.\" And\nI followed him out of that room, leaving the other survivors and...and some of my men there.\nWe walked out across the yard. At this point, the survivors were all still stinging, uh, there.\nAnd we were approaching a small building that I took to be like a Red Cross building. A\nsmall first-aid building 1s what it looked like. Much like here, when they go swimming in the\nsummer. I came up by the door--and by this time, I apparently been kind of getting used to\nthe horrors that we were finding. And I called out to Big Chief--a six-foot seven Indian, uh, a\nhuge man--was standing right in the doorway, with his back to me. And I called out to him,\n\"Chief, what have you got?\" And he just turned around slowly, and he looked me with the\nmost God-awrful look of shock on his face. And he couldn't talk. His lips were quivering. He\nwas trying to say something, but he couldn't talk. So I saw an expression on his face; he\ndecided what to do, and he took a giant step to one side, out of my way. And I entered the\ndoor, and I looked. Inside the room--as I say a small room--the Germans had erected some\nkind of a board upright, much like a sheet of plywood. And here, they had taken a prisoner\nand they had stripped him; and they had nailed him with spikes--common spikes with the\nheads on them--through his elbows and through his wrist that I saw. Nailed him like this,\nspread-eagled on that board. And I could see where they had taken apparently a scalpel, and\nthey had cut his throat on the side here...his vocal cords somewhere. So he couldn't scream.\nSo, in other words, apparently they...they did not give him any anesthesia. He was looking at\nme and he was shaking his head; and he was begging with his little eyes, pleading with me.\nThey had begun... They had already taken and cut open, uh, his chest, and taken his rib cage\noff. And I remember on the left side of, uh...of him[, his rib cage] was hanging on nails. They\nhad taken some of, uh, his intestines, and hung them on the right on nails. And I could see\nhis lungs--bluish and foamy-like looking--uh, pulsating inside of him. In other words, they...\nthey were dissecting him alive. Experimenting on him. And I didn't know what to do. You\nknow, some of the other men behind me coming 1n now were getting shocked like that. And\nI remember Goggleye saying, \"What in the Hell are we going to do?\" I said, \"Get outside\nthe building here.\" Because we...our radios--uh, the 536, we call it--uh, would not work\ninside the building like they do today. I said, \"Get outside the building here. Call the\ncompany. Tell them what we've found.\" Which he had already been reporting,\nuh...everything. \"And give them the name, the identification of this building in particular.\nTell them, for God's sake, somewhere, get a hold of a doctor. A surgeon, in particular; to try\nto help this man.\" Then I ordered everybody to get out of that room, so that perhaps we\ncould save him and not give him any disease. Because we were all filthy. And so I sealed the\nroom...the room off that way. And then I went back to the, uh...the uh...group of the\nsurvivors. And this [was] a sea of humanity, of survivors, out there singing. And I began\ntalking a little bit with them again, and telling them that it's all over. And it's about at this\npoint that they began to understand that they were liberated. Because now they turned and\nstarted looking at each other; and there was tears coming down their faces, but there were\nsmiles. They began to hug and kiss each other. And you kno...of course, European men,\nespecially, will kiss each other. They began to take and hug each other...uh, and cry. And\nthey started, a lot of them, locking their arms together; and they began singing. And it was\nvery, very emotional thing to see. And as I say, it was the beginning of them really\nunderstanding that they were liberated.",
        "Q: The SS men had already left the camp?",
        "A: The SS were already...at least deeper into the camp; and were on their way out, uh, with, uh,\n\"prime prisoners,\" out the other side. This 1s the first time that I can remember that we\nrealized what was going on. That some of the other prisoners had, uh, told us that the SS--\napparently through all the excitement and everything else--now one of us has asked them\nwhere 1s the...what...what happened to the SS there. And they told us, \"They're going out the\nother side.\" So I...1 remember radioing the company, and telling them that this column 1s\ngoing out the other side. The...we had orders then to leave that camp and rejoin the company,\nand fight for the city. So I called all the men together. We formed a line down the road, and\nwe started marching forward out the main gate into the city. All the survivors were following\nus. As we reached the city....",
        "Q: Let's stop at this point and, uh, then we'll continue later. We've got to change the film.",
        "A: All right.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTAPE #2",
        "Q: So you started out of the camp.",
        "A: All right. Now, you must understand that an awful lot of these things that I have been\ndescribing is very, very difficult to talk about.",
        "Q: Did you ever find out what happened to the man who was, uh, spiked against the board?",
        "A: No. No, uh, that I did not. Uh, I have often wondered about that; and people have asked me\nabout that man. Uh, we had to leave him in that condition. And (clearing throat) so we\nturned; and we started, side-by-side, walking down this main street with thousands of the\nsurvivors. And I don't... And I'm not exaggerating. This camp must have been huge. And\nthey were all walking behind us, very quietly. And, of course, I turned around a couple of\ntimes; and I told them, \"You people go back. Because we're going to start shooting now, and\nI don't want you people hurt.\" But they stayed nght with us. And it was almost like a parade.\nAnd shortly, we came to the first houses on the outskirts of the city. And suddenly, a\nwoman--a German woman--come running out the right hand side, uh, toward me. And she,\napparently, knew that I was the commanding, uh, man in this group. She reached me and\ngrabbed me by the shirt, and locked her hands into my shirt. And she began begging me.\nAnd she said, \"I was teacher in America, in Cleveland, Ohio, uh, before the war.\" And then\nshe looked around. She was scared. And she started telling me that she didn't know anything\nof what was going on in that camp. \"I didn't know! I didn't know!\" And I became rather\ninfuriated at that point. And I turned around. Now all the...most of the European people are\nsmaller than we are, except for the German people. And I turned around; and here's a sea of\nhumanity. And I could see over the top of their heads. And I could see the camp, uh, which\nwasn't very far from us. I could see the gates. I could see the barbed wire. I could see the\ntowers. And I could actually see the...the hanging ropes, where we cut all these people down.\nAnd incidently, in those ropes... Hopper had come to me, uh, earlier, and he brought me over\nthere after they cut them down. And these people--most of them that had clothing on--they\ntied their wrists behind them, and then they hung them by the wrist backwards. There was\ntwo people, two men, that were nude. They tied their wrists behind them and...with piano\nwire; and then they took a hook of some kind, and they ran it through their privates. And\nthey hung them upside down and left them that way. Which is an appalling thing to do to\nsomebody. Anyway, this woman came to me. And she [was] telling...trying to tell me that\nshe didn't know. The odor of this whole area was terrible. And then I turned back to her, after\nlooking back at the camp and even seeing the ropes from this distance; and I slapped her\nhard across the face. I was infur...I was furious. And I called her a...a damn liar. And she fell\nto the ground, let go of my shirt. And she was crying. And we all walked around her and\nkept on going. All of a sudden...and I ordered my men then... Now, [when] we got to the\nbuildings, I said, \"Some of you guys start going through these...this building over here. Some\nof you guys start going through there.\" All of a sudden, the...the survivors themselves began\nrunning like mad. And I said, \"Whoa!\" I started yelling at them, \"Whoa! Wait a minute!\nCome back here!\" I says, \"You can't go in there. There's going to be shooting. And they're\ngoing to go there.\" And I says, uh...and I realized now, looking at this massive crowd that\nthere's no way 16 of us are gonna, uh, control this mob--especially if they get excited. So I\ntold them, \"Okay. Go ahead. You help find the...the German soldier.\" \"But,\" I says, \"He's\nmy prisoner. You bring him back here, and you put him right there on the ground. I'll stay\nright here.\" So I stood in the middle of the street. My men and the survivors started going\nthrough all the buildings, all the closets, and everything else. They found...actually found\narmed, uh, Wehrmacht soldiers, uh, and dragged them down the street. They were spitting at\nthem. They were kicking at them, and all this; but they, uh, abided by my rule, and they\nbrought them and threw them on the ground beside me. When I...I noticed that they would\nstart getting excited and start talking like mad, then I would tell them, \"Okay. Go find me\nsome more, uh, German soldiers.\" And they'd take off and they'd start scattering, running\nagain. When they did that, then I ordered one of my men to take these prisoners; and take\nthem back behind and turn them over as prisoners. I didn't want a massacre here. We finally\ncame to the edge of the city, after going through. There wasn't much of a fight in the city.\nThe...most of everybody had deserted. And then Captain...uh, the Colonel of our battalion\nordered us into the woods instead. Uh, which was normal procedure; because we knew once\nthe German army found out that we had taken the city, that they would actually blow up their\nown city with artillery. So I turned around to the survivors. And I told them...I said, \"Now, I\nwant all of you to go back. We're going in the forest. All of you go back to the camp, where\nyou're gonna be safe. Because now the Germans are going to shell the city, and\nblow...destroy it. And I don't want you people hurt.\" They abided; and they turned around.\nUh, many of them throwing kisses to us, and that kind of thing (clearing throat) there. The...\nWe went into the woods and dug in for the night. And then I started to walk from hole to\nhole. Little foxholes, two men usually in each hole. And I was checking for the positions, to\nmake sure they were digging in the right position for defense and all that. As I came to each\nhole--and I'm standing up in the dead of night, and I'm looking down at the men--and I\nbelieve that every single man was crying. And they'd look up at me; and generally, the gist of\nit was that most of them looked up at me and said...asked me, \"Why?\" Of course, I\nunderstood what they were asking me. Why did the Germans do that to those people? And I\nhad no answer for them. The next morning, or sometime during the night, we moved out.\nAnd we began engaging the German Army and chasing them through the woods. And, uh,\nwe came to a huge valley. The entire battalion came to the valley. And the Germans were\nacross the valley... and with ack-ack batteries. And they were firing...now firing at us. So that\nColonel Hook decided that the only way to take them was to order us to, uh, spread out as far\nas we could, and stand up and walk across the entire valley. And which we did. As we\ngot...uh, I had one of the points. In other words, the foremost troops in the group. And as we\ncome to the edge of the, uh, hills and started to go up the hills, the Germans that were up\nthere on the artillery guns began to desert their guns and run. We climbed up and began [to]\noverrun the guns themselves. And at this point, I noticed two of my new men, that, uh, just\ncame into combat for the first time, had three German SS prisoners. The SS wore different\nuniforms entirely than the Wehrmacht did. And I noticed...at that point, I ran...began to run\nover to where they were. And I fired a shot at one of them. One of the SS troopers had his\nhands down like this. And I fired a shot at his feet; and I yelled for him to \"Hands hoch!\"--\n[to] put his hands high. And my two men began to call out, \"Well, we got the situation well\nin hand.\" And I told them they were crazy; that they were almost dead men. And I pointed\nout that the one SS trooper with his hands down low was reaching down to touch the buckle\non his belt. It was a big brass buckle, with a Swastika and so on on it. Touch a button, the\nheavy brass buckle dropped down. Instantly, three little tiny barrels of 22 shots drop down\nand would fire directly into your belly. And we.... Thus, we called them \"belly guns.\" And\nso all this time that I was chastising my men and teaching them this, I was watching the\neyes--or the faces--of these SS troopers. They had the Death['s]-Head SS insignia on them.\nSo then I knew by the expression on their face, that one...which one could speak English.\nAnd I addressed him immediately. And I said, \"Were you men in this camp behind us?\"\nAnd the SS trooper looked at me, and he realized I knew he spoke English. And he said,\n\"Yes.\" And then I searched for a question. And I knew it was ridiculous for me to ask him\nwhy they put people behind the prison...behind barbed wire, why they tortured them and\nmurdered them and all this; because of the attitude of the German nation at that time. So I\nfinally decided; and asked him, \"Well, why didn't you, at least, take care of the...treat the\ndiseases in the camp?\" And he look at me, and he stood erect. And he said, \"Why should\nwe? They were all going to die anyway.\" And I had everything I could do to control my\ntemper, and not kill the three of them right then and there. So I reached out, and I grabbed\nthe, uh...the, uh...the Death['s|-Head insignia off all three of them. I took the belly gun off the\none; and I took another belt buckle off the...off a second one. And (clearing throat) with our\nmorals.... And people have asked me many times since then, \"At the scene, or leaving the\ncamp... When you left the camp, why didn't you go into the city and shoot every German that\nyou found?\" And the only answer I have is that because the Germans--or the German SS\ntroopers, 1n particular--became animals in those days didn't mean that I could lower myself\nto those standards. And that was a very, very important part, or fact[or], in those days: that\nwe had to have something to stand by and believe in.",
        "Q: Uh, did you interrogate these, uh, three SS men, uh, any further, or did they go off...?",
        "A: No. Uh, we just uh searched them thoroughly and, uh, made sure that they didn't have any\nweapons, or any--like the SS normal...very often did--have, uh, TNT inside their shirts. And\nthey...at times, they would actually blow themselves up--and you with them--as you searched\nthem. But we, uh...we searched them thoroughly. And then, uh, I detailed one man to take\nthem back as prisoners and turn them over to...to our company headquarters. And...and thus\nback to a prison camp. But they were marked as war crimes, as were the German women\nguards at the camp, uh, there. Uh, now, we really didn't understand what would happen to\nthem from that point on. Except that they would...we hoped, would draw more attention than\nthe other prisoners would, uh, that we would turn back to them.",
        "Q: At that point, did you run into other camps, or other...?",
        "A: Yah. Then we continued on that particular day, as I remember. And now we had learned,\nuh... In fact, we had overrun the column that had gone out the back side of that camp. I\nbelieve--and...and I'm assuming--uh, uh, but through certain other facts, that in this particular\ncolumn was Dov Shelanski (ph), who eventually became the Prime Minister of Israel.\u201d\u2019 Uh,\nI do understand, uh, that he was in this column being taken away and that the Germans were\nkilling the prisoners as fast as they could while they were taking them back away from our\nline. Now, we had cut through and cut them off and...uh ...the men, as I can remember at this\nparticular column, they uh... the men were coming down out of the woods and seeing and\nhearing the Germans shooting the prisoners. And perhaps...and they were bayoneting them,\nand whatever. I believe they shot everyone of those guards. They didn't give them a chance\nto surrender. But then they relieved these prisoners that were coming out of the camp. Now,\nwe moved on; and we were coming to another camp not very far away, called Moosburg.\u201d\nThe quick, uh, history of Moosburg that it was designed as a Stalag [NB: Prisoner of War\ncamp] for the airmen.\u201d And they were normally treated rather quite well during the war,\nuntil this period of time. The camp was designed for 3,000 prisoners. Now, as we overran the\ncamp, [it] held over 30,000 prisoners 1n it. Instead of having just airmen, prisoners from the\nAllies--that would be the Canadians, English, and the Americans--they now held a lot of\nJews that had been taken away from the master camp at Dachau and Dachau, uh, No. 2 were\nin Moosburg. There were many of our own men [NB: from the US 394th Infantry\nRegiment], that were captured during the Battle of the Bulge, uh, were brought down on\nforced march. And they knew they didn't have a chance, apparently, to go by and go into\nMauthausen. So they detoured them into Moosburg. At this point, we had....because of\nDachau 3B, we knew that what the Germans were doing...that they were taking prisoners out\nthe back gate. So our battalion that night made a \"pincer movement\"--as the Germans called\nit--attacked heavily, and one point broke through the German line. We came in during the\nnight, behind the camp of Moosburg. In front, the armored uh...uh, battalion that was\nattached to us came in at the main gate. I understand that they had a bit of fight to begin with;\nand then they broke in and blew their way in the gate, and came in the front gate. Uh,\nthen...uh, I and my men were given, shall we say, a little bit of a reprieve and told to come in\nthe back gate. And we started finding some of our own buddies, that had been captured\nduring the Bulge, in there. Uh, which was an incredible thing; because at this stage of the\nwar and everything else, whether on purpose or design.... Uh, but all these men were horribly\nstarved. These were American soldiers, Jews...as I say, there were other Europeans there.\nThey were many... The... And we noticed distinctly that the British, Canadians, American\nairmen that were there were in much better physical condition. They were much better\ntreated, whether by...by design or...or events, uh, there. The American soldier from the 99th\nDivision, the 106th and the 28th Division that were brought in, in these columns were in\nhorrible condition. And, uh, of course, as I say, we got a chance to talk with some of them.\nAnd I remember so distinctly some of the men talking to me excitedly. And they said, \"Do\nyou remember when we were back in Camp Maxey, Texas, and two orders were--when we\nwere declared hot....\"\" In other words, the outfit was fit for combat, and we were now going\n*! There has been no Prime Minister of Israel by this name since 1948.\n* According to US military records, this would have happened around April 29 or April 30, 1945.\n\u00b0\u00b0 Officially designated by the Nazis as Stalag VIIA.\nto go to Europe in combat. Two orders came down from the higher command. Number one,\nthat all men with tattoos would have their tattoos removed at their cost. No reason given for\nthat. Now we had gone through Dachau, we knew why. But obviously, the American Army\nknew long time before what was happening to prisoners. Number two, all men in the line\ncompanies--now, roughly speaking, half the infantry, uh, divisions are behind the lines as\nintelligence, as supply, artillery, and all this kind of thing. But the linemen were the men who\nwere going to actually do the fighting, were in the line companies, [and] all had to be\ncircumcised. And I understand the 106th Division, which was formed about the same time\nwe were, was treated the same way. Now, these men were describing in Moosburg what\nhappened. \"...that you remember back there, when we were circumcised?\" \"Yes, I\nremember.\" Now, when they were captured during the Battle of the Bulge and the Germans\nbegan examining them, they found these men circumcised--at the same period of time that\nthe Germans are hunting all over Europe for the Jew, the only men in Europe at that time that\nwere circumcised. And here they had black men. They had Indians. They had Mexicans.\nAnd they had all the different religious men were circumcised. And I would assume that they\nwere probably dumbfounded. But they separated them from the other Americans. The Black\nmen, almost immediately as soon as they captured them, they took them aside. And we're\nfinding out now they piano wired their wrists behind them; and then they began to bayonet\nthem, sticking the bayonets up under their throat here, through their privates, and through\nother parts of their bodies first, before they finally ran them through and killed them. And\nthey left them.",
        "Q: These were soldiers?",
        "A: These were American soldiers. Black men. Uh, I have now been asking an awful lot of the\nex-POWs the same question. \"Have you, while you were an American soldier...prisoner of\nthe Germans, did you--on the force marches, the death marches, or in the prison camps--ever\nsee any American Black soldiers?\" And every one of them, at this point now--and I'm\ngetting an awful lot of letters in--every one of them answered me, \"No.\" They've never seen\na Black prisoner back in Germany. In the columns, as they were captured and taken back to\nbehind the lines during the Bulge, the SS troopers who--most of them could speak English--\nbegan ordering the prisoners to expose their dog tags. So the American took the dog tags out,\n[and] hung them out. Immediately, the Germans started...uh, the SS trooper started going\ndown, uh, the prisoners, looking at their dog tags. Your name 1s on it. There is a letter\ndesignat...on the top, designating your blood type; and on the bottom, there is a letter\ndesignating your religion. Every man with a letter H--\"Hebrew\"--was immediately pushed\naside, and their heads were blown off right there. They were also looking for the man of\nGerman descent. Apparently, the Germans resented that they didn't go to Germany and join\nthe German Army. But immediately in the columns, as I understand now from these men,\nthey realized what was happening. They began--the Indians, the Mexicans, the men of dark\nskin--began swapping dog tags with the Jew. Other men, uh, Catholics and Protestant, began\npassing up their Bibles to the Jews. And thus, they could...many of them bluffed their way\nthrough. Uh, very close friend of mine--George Golman, from Dallas, Texas--uh, still had...\nLast year, when he called me from Dallas, and he told me: he says, \"Whitey,\" he says, \"you\nknow, I still have that Bible that saved my life.\" He said, \"When the SS trooper came for\nme, he started to reach out for the dogtag. And I started telling him that I was a Catholic.\"\nAnd he says, \"I can recite anything in the book. You open the page, and I'll recite it to you.\"\nAnd he bluffed his way; uh, and the SS trooper moved on. And thus this...these tactics saved\na lot...a lot of these men's lives. It was an incredible facts that are coming out now, of what\nhappened to those men. Now, I find with, uh, a lot of these men are telling me that as\nthey...those who survived the marches--where they were brutalized, beaten, some shot, uh, a\ngreat many of them horribly starved. They picked up many of the diseases en route; and, of\ncourse, especially dysentery. Many of them probably died of dysentery. But those who\nsurvived to get to the different camps--such as Hammelburg. Uh, it's a key camp. As the\nsurvivors got into the camp, they were detailed so many men to a barracks in the prison\ncamp. And this is a Stalag, now--for POWs. Not a concentration camp. And these men then\nwere...went into the barracks and were assigned a bunk. Immediately, in came a group of\nGerman soldiers to each barrack; and commanded that the \"Jew boys\" step forward, is the\nway the termed it. The prisoners 1n there began yelling out, calling out to the men: \"Don't do\nit! Don't do it!\" Unfortunately, some of the Jews stepped forward. These are American\nsoldiers. And they were immediately taken out. Now, others did not step forward and, uh,\ndeclare themselves. The men who declared themselves as Jews were immediately taken out\nof the barracks. They were never seen again. Over and over again, the other prisoners keep\ntelling me this. Now, along came a letter from another man--uh, McCracken, his name 1s--\nand he was in the regimental, uh, medics. And he said he was among the men who liberated\nthat camp of Hammelburg. He began exploring, after the excitement was all over; and he\nwent into one particular building, and down into the basement. And here he found a room, as\nhe declares, as a execution room. One whole wall covered with lead and bullet marks. At the\nbase of the, uh, wall 1s a trench, to carry the blood, and a drainhole. We're trying to\ninvestigate much deeper into these facts, uh, as we go along now. But all these little facts are\nstarting to come out, and put a much better picture of what was happening. But it was, uh,\nvery strange to find an execution chamber in a Stalag.",
        "Q: So, uh, from your, uh... After you left Dachau and went to the next camp, uh...which was...",
        "A: Moosburg.",
        "Q: Yah. The Moosburg camp. What happened after that? Did you...?",
        "A: Okay. We then moved on out of the camp, leaving the prisoners behind. Uh, and then we\nwere heading toward a city called Landshut, not very far from there. And, uh, here there was\nanother camp. Uh, it was in our minds not significant. It wasn't a horror camp--at least, as\nmuch as I know about it. Uh, this camp at Landshut, uh, contained, uh, I believe, almost all\nEnglish and Canadian, uh, troops. Uh, they had already been liberated at this point, as we\nwere marching through; and a lot of the prisoners were coming out of the camps. And they,\nof course, waving to you as...as normal, and uh, even saluting us, and everything else. And it\nwas, uh, a stage of glory, should we say, and happiness at this point. And we continued on by\nthe camp itself, and we began... Now, this was on the border of Austria. And we that night,\nuh, took over some farm houses. And then, uh, Captain Pat called me, uh, to his\nheadquarters--that farm house he was in--and he told me... Now, he assigned me that I was\ngonna, uh, take a patrol into Austria. And this patrol, he says, \"I'm gonna ask you to\nvolunteer. Uh, and your men.\" Uh, he gave me the details. As best as I can remember now,\nuh, that I'm being assigned three tanks with rubber tracks. I'm to take my men on the top of\nthose tanks, to protect them. We're to hit the German lines, uh, during the middle of the\nnight. I believe that was about, probably, two o'clock in the morning. And break through; not\nfight unless we had to, but keep on going. Just fight our way through, and go behind the\nGerman lines. Keep on going down this particular road for approximately 30, 35 miles. And\ndown in there somewhere was a bridge that I was to try to take and stop the Germans from\nblowing up. That was my basic mission. Thus, we did this. And as I believe to this day, uh,\nthat, uh, a famous cartoonist--now I can't think of his name...uh, Bill Mauldin--uh, was\nstanding in the background, in the kitchen at the time. And he came up; and he asked me...he\nasked Captain Pat if he could go on that patrol. And Captain told him, he says, \"Well, that's\nnot my decision.\" He says, \"You'll have to ask Sargeant Whiteway.\" And I looked at him,\nand I said, \"Well, you understand, this is apparently a suicide patrol. That we're not going to\nget any help for some time. I cannot protect you. You are a civilian, technically; and you\ncan't carry any weapons, according to the Geneva Conference [Convention]. And I cannot\nprotect you. I don't have enough men.\" He said, \"I agree.\" He says, \"I want to go with you.\"\nSo he rode on one of the tanks. But I...I think I put him on the third tank. And uh...so we\nbroke through the lines. We had a...we had a few gun fights, and...but we kept on going. And\nuh...or reboarded the tanks after we, uh, initially, uh, cleared the way. And then we rode all\nnight, and through ...'til just about dawn. As I can remember, it was daylight when we came\nwithin sight of the bridge. And as we...then got off the tanks and we spread my men out to\nprotect my tanks, and then we started to move up. And we got pretty close to the bridge; and\nthe Germans there blew the bridge up in our faces. So now the mission was blown. Uh, the\nonly thing I could do, there was a clearing--an opening, a little small field. And I told the\ntanks, I says, \"Okay, pull in here. We'll make a big circle around you and dig in. And you\nguys dig the tanks in the middle of that.\" Which we did. Now, the Germans were coming in\nfrom all directions; and they totally surrounded us. And we could see them put a blockade\nup, uh, on the road, so we couldn't escape. And we were sweat...began to sweat. We stayed\nthere for countless hours. And everybody's asking me, \"What the heck are they doing?\" I\nsaid, \"The only thing I can think of...\" And, of course, at times I was communicating with\nthe tankers, who radioed back our condition. Uh, that the Germans were waiting to bring in\n\"Tiger\" tanks to blow our tanks up. And we had no defense against them. But we waited and\nwaited; and finally, we could hear way down the valley an American jeep. They have a very\ndistinct sound. And he was winding his way down. And so we kept looking there, and finally\nwe could see him. And we started yelling to him to go back, go back. He approached the,\nuh...the blockade. The Germans opened up the blockade and let him in. We couldn't\nunderstand what the heck was happening. And then the two guys in the jeep drove right up\nto us through the German lines; and they yelled out, \"It's all over! Forget about it. It's the\nend of the war!\"~\"\n*\u201c Th the European theatre, the war ended May 9, 1945.",
        "Q: While you were in Cherbourg, did you also run into some prisoners of war there?",
        "A: Ok. Yah. After the war, and on our...so-called \"on our way home,\" uh, for discharge. And we\ntook over; and we were assigned occupation, temporarily, uh, in the city of Cherbourg,\nFrance. And we had 200,000 German prisoners there. And at times, uh, we would go up, uh,\nbetween--when we were off-duty, and so on--uh, on patrol, we would go up and we'd watch\nthe Germans playing European football. As today, we call it soccer. And they were very\ngood at it. But, of course, they had nothing else to do. So uh, they'd be out there playing; and\nthen they come over talking to us, uh...uh, at the end of their games, and things like that.\nAnd, uh, they could...uh, some of them could speak English. Some could speak some\nEnglish, and visa versa. We was already learned a certain amount of German. So we could\ncommunicate quite easily. And I...there was a colonel, a German officer, standing there. And\nI questioned him. I said, \"You know, I'm very puzzled about one thing.\" I said, \"Everywhere\nI've gone in Europe here, during the war and after the war, that I can find no young men. In\nFrance, in Belgium, over in Denmark, there's no young men. What happened to them?\" And\nthe colonel stood erect. And he said, \"Well, we officers--or we Germans--occupying these\ncountries had a problem. That we knew that there would be one group that would most\nresent what we were going to do to the civilians. That was the young men. So as we overran\nthe towns, the villages, the neighborhoods and the cities, we immediately rounded up all the\npeople. And we separated all the young men from 16...or 15 or 16 to 25, stand over there\nagainst a stone wall. We set up firing squads, and we immediately shot everyone of them, in\nevery living country we went into. Voila! No problem.\" (Clearing throat)",
        "Q: Shocking!",
        "A: Very shocking. Uh... But then I began to understand the German mind. Of course, there were\nmany other things that came out of this. Of their attitudes of the German occupation of these\ncountries, and so on; and their intimidation and their firing squads, and why, are there.",
        "Q: In all your experience that you've already described to us, what were your feelings?\nWhat...what would you like to say about it?",
        "A: All right. Of course, uh, after, uh...at the very end of the war there, we did overrun--right\nsomewhere in that immediate vicinity--and only saw part of one of the Mauthausens. There\nwas 42, as I understand now. And we saw some awful horrors there. And even, uh,\ncannibalism in the camp. But these... Like Dachau. And we were so shocked. And Professor\nCrawford asked me after the war, he said... Now, he asked me the same question about my\nemotions, how I felt...thought about it. And he asked me another question, \"Did you men\nduring the war--after you left the camp, or after the war, or even at home--talk about these\nterrible camps and these horrors that you saw?\" And I suddenly realized, number one, that\nall this time I had been assuming that as we radioed--like, for instance, in Dachau--that we\nradioed back constantly all the things that we were finding to the company; to be reported,\nwe assumed, on the, uh, daily reports of the military, that here they, uh...all the reports itself\nwould be turned in. But I also assumed that due to us communicating with the men behind\nus, that all of a sudden everybody in the battalion would be coming into the camp and taking\na look at all these horrors that we saw. It didn't happen. Nobody came. And we were ordered\nout, to go help the battalion fight for the camp. I found out since that somebody in the\ndivision has deleted every single word of every camp all over Germany that we had entered.\nEvery single word had been disappeared. Nobody seemed to care. Of the human misery, or\nanything else there. And this shocked me. But at the end of the war--without even knowing\nabout this, but just assuming that everybody else around me and the company had gone in--it\nwas so distasteful to remember this that we tried to shut it off. We did not ever talk amongst\neach other about one single word about any of these things that happened in the camps. From\nthe shock, from all the human misery, uh, in France, Belgium....the misery among ourselves,\nthe misery about all the Germans that we shot and left wounded on the ground, crying and\nbegging...uh, to the German civilians who were bombed and fire-bombed. It was total misery\nall the time we were over there. So, by the end of the war, we became very, very bitter men.\nAnd it took us a long time to come out of this bitterness. Of the human misery. Not so much,\nuh, because of the war and what the Germans did, but the...all the misery that we had seen, of\neverybody. Uh, those are terrible, terrible memories. And for 40 years, approximately, I\nburied all those memories in my mind. When I came back home, I remember trying to tell\nsome of the adventures, some of the things that happened to me. And everybody--my\nfriends, my family--the minute you'd start talking about the war at all, they'd say, \"Forget it.\nIt's all over. We don't want to hear it. We don't care.\" And this... And I actually was even\nhumiliated. \"Oh. You were in the big one!\" And things like that. And becoming\nembarrassed or humiliated like that, that you'd bottle the things up even deeper. So finally\nwhen Professor Crawford approached me the first time, and I began to remember some.\nWhen I first started to testify and talk about it, even for the first few years, I could only\nremember just so much. And it was all kind of jumbled, and locations were jumbled in my\nmind. After a while, all of a sudden, things started to straighten out. But I have not had a\nnightmare since. And that's a very big point, uh, there.",

And then, uh, couple of days later, taken to Fort\nKnox, Kentucky, for, uh, my major training in the armored forces. I continued on then, uh,\nafter graduating there. Instead of going into the armored, uh, division, they took a group of\nus, uh, that were apparently high in the records of, uh, achievement; and they sent us to\nSouth Carolina, to the Rangers, where we received 19 weeks of very intensive training.",
        "A: Then we went, uh, to, uh, Camp Maxey, Texas, and joined the 99th Division. Uh, there we\nwere supposed to train a lot of the troops, and so on. And we went immediately over to\nEngland (clearing throat) by way of Boston. So from England, well, we trained for awhile.\nInvasion training. And then, uh, very shortly, why, we land...we went across the channel in\nLSTs and landed at Le Havre.\u201d And we had a little bit of skirmishes there; but, uh, we moved\ninland, uh, into Belgium. And then we relieved the 9th Infantry Division on line, in uh...1in\naround the area of Li\u00a2ge [Flem: Luik], Belgium.",
        "A: All right. Uh...uh, of course, we were totally green. We had a lot of experience, uh, there 1n,\nuh, training, but, uh, totally green to combat. And, uh, about a month and a half later, uh, on\nDecember 16th at dawn, the Germans attacked us with, uh, uh, over 10 to | of their prime\nGerman SS troopers, Panzer Grenadiers, the, uh, German, uh, paratroopers, and so on. And\njust simply overwhelmed us on what we now call \"Hell's Corner.\" And, uh, like, uh, my\ncompany, uh, of--as I understand now--of approximately 216 men, there were only 29 of us\nsurvived. And then, uh, we, uh, managed to hold the line. We wiped out the 3rd Panzer\nDivision\u2019--uh, with...with great help of our artillery, of course. And, uh, then, uh, within\n' Located near Ayer, Massachusetts.\n* This would have been well after June 6, 1944, since Le Havre was held by German forces until\nSeptember 12, 1944 when it was captured by the British 1st Corps.\n\u00b0 This could not have been the 3rd Panzer Division, which served on the Eastern Front. Probably\nabout another month or so, why, we began getting replacements and were again ready for\ncombat and pushing into Germany through the Siegfried Line.\u201d",
        "A: All right. We pushed, uh, into Germany, uh, forcing, naturally, the German army back,\nor...or Just wiping them out. Uh, I'm making it sound a lot easier than, uh, what actually\nhappened. But, uh, we...the main part is we came to, uh, Cologne [Ger: Koln]; and, uh, then\nswitched, uh, south to, uh, the...one of our armored divisions had captured a bridge now\nknow as the Remagen Bridge. We were immediately pulled out of the fighting in Cologne,\nand pulled south. And my battalion was the first, uh, of the 99th Division to arrive there. And\nwe went over the bridge that night, under very heavy fire, took the [Epellolai (ph)] on the\nother side--uh, which is a mountain there--and held it and until other troops could get up\nthere. And we pushed inland, and made what is known as a bridgehead. It was tn this\nbridgehead that we first came upon our first concentration camps.",
        "A: All right. The army (clearing throat) had never, uh, informed of ...us of anything about the\nconcentration camps. Uh, so that we were not mentally prepared for anything. Uh, the first\nfew camps, uh, that we came to, we were ordered--being combat troops, our mission was to\nfight and destroy the German army. So we would part, and go around these huge camps, and\nre-engage on the other side. In doing this, we came by...many times, the...one of the gates.\nAnd here, uh, uh--as I've learned or put together in the last few years--a handful of men\nwould normally be detailed to go into the camps, unchain the people who were chained and\nso on, and release the prisoners. Uh, the rest of all the combat troops would, as I say,\ncontinue engaging the German troops. As we went by the gates, we would see, uh, handfuls,\nor, uh, quite a few prisoners--or, uh we now call them, survivors--would come outside the\ngates [and] be standing there as we were passing by, either on foot or on trucks and tanks.\nAnd they would be waving to you, and they'd be all smiles. And if they got a chance, they'd\ncome over to you and hug and kiss you and shake hands. And this threw us off guard.\nBecause now, when we saw all these smiling faces, we assumed that they were alright. And\nwe just kept on going. The only ones to see any of the horrors in the camps, not... For us, not\nrealizing that many of them were not physically able to come out of the gates.",
        "A: The Germans normally, uh, in my experience, uh, would normally stay in the camps--the\nhe is referring here to the 9th Panzer Division, which served in the Battle of the Bulge in December\n1944 and suffered heavy losses there.\n* English name for the Westwall, a fortified line along the western border of Germany.\nguards--until we were approaching one of the gates. And they would withdraw out the back,\nuh, side, uh, opposite side, of wherever we were approaching. And what I...we've learned is\nthat they would normally take selected prisoners--usually Jewish people--uh, out the back\ngates, and keep on taking them in forced marches, uh, further into Germany or into Austria.\nAnd they would continue then to try to kill them as fast as they could do that. Uh, we hadn't\nlearned that at this point, uh, there. And so it was a very tragic thing, uh, to be able to permit\nthe Germans to...to keep on murdering people like that. (Clearing throat) They usually beat\nthem to death with rifle butts or...or bayonets, or just shoot them. But they...we also learned\nthat they had to be very careful about not using too much ammunition, because they were\ngoing to need that to fight us. So we continued on fighting, continued past the camps--except\nfor our handfuls of men that would go in.",
        "A: There were many camps like this. And we continued pushing north into Germany, until we\ncame to a city called Giessen [Giessen is due east of Remagen]. And in Giessen--or in that\narea--uh, my group was Selected to, uh...at nighttime, swim the river [this would have been\nthe Lahne River], come in quietly behind the German guards and the engineers at the\nbridges, and quietly take them off. And then cut the, uh, cords to all the explosives on the\nbridges. At dawn, or about dawn, then our entire regiment or battalion came in on trucks and\ntanks quickly; and were inside the city before the Germans knew it.\u201d Now, I was ordered to\ntake my men and go down one of the main streets. We fought from building to building,\nhouse to house. But in this area was very different from many of the other areas in, uh...1n\nEurope--and in particular, in Germany. Because we came upon the most appalling odor that I\nhave ever smelled. And there's no way to really describe it. Uh, except to bring out the, uh,\nimportant points that, by now, in northern Germany like this we're all very experienced\ncombat troops. We had seen all kinds of human misery. We were used to the odor of death,\nof, uh, flesh--burning flesh--and all this kind of thing. But this odor was, uh, very distinct,\nand very strong. We had to find heavy cloth in the buildings that we were fighting in, from\nthe German soldiers; and hold it over our faces while we're trying to shoot. Because this...",
        "A: Uh, the city was quite large. Uh, I would compare it, uh, with the size of Malden,\nMass[achusetts]. Of, uh, say around a 100,000.\u00b0 Somewhere on that idea. And, uh, as we\npushed down on this particular area, why, the odor got worse. And we finally came to a big\nstone wall, and a huge ancient wooden gate. Upon top were barbed wire, machine gun nests.\nThere was no soldiers there, at this point. Uh, apparently, each time we finally approached\n\u00b0 Giessen was captured March 28, 1945.\n\u00b0 Giessen had a population of 31,601 at the end of the war; by the 1980s its population had grown\nto 76,374.\nthe camps that the guards in the camps would not engage us. They would run instead. Unlike\nthe Wehrmacht or the regular infantry. So, when we came to the gate, we knew we had some\nkind of a prison there. And we put TNT against the gate, and we blew it in. Ran inside,\ndispersed to cover each other, and engage what we knew would be the, uh, the Death['s]-\nHead--from experience, the Death['s] -Head SS troopers\u2019 uh, that normally ran these camps.\nAnd this camp was called Hadamar.* Uh, it turned out to be, uh, an extermination camp, not\na concentration camp.\u201d Uh, why I say that is because they weren't keeping the prisoners there\nfor long periods of time and starving them and tormenting them and torturing them and\nterrorizing them, like in other camps that we would go into. As we burst into the camp and\nspread out, I saw in front of me a row of barracks. Wooden, one-story barracks. In front of\nthe barracks, at that point, was a large group of...what we called in those days \"slaves,\" for\nlack of any other word. Now we call them survivors. And they were standing there totally\nshocked at, of course, the explosion of the gate being blown in, these strange men in strange\nuniforms running in. And they didn't know who we were. Uh, I since learned, of course, that\nthe Germans kept all the information, news, away from them. So that...thus not ever giving\nthem any hope of surviving. I knew that these people were of no danger to us; so I\nimmediately, being combat, turned my attention to the left, to the buildings. And I ordered\nmy men to start going through the buildings and start cleaning them out--in other words,\nengaging the German soldier, the SS troopers. Uh, at that point, one of my men came for me.\nAnd he asked me...he says, \"You'd better come with me.\" And he had a voice...his tone of\nvoice was very serious. I followed him across the yard to a building; and as I, uh, observed,\nthe building--to my best memory now--was a masonry building. The windows were all\nsealed up. Outside, as I can remember now, was, I believe, eight automobiles, all up on\nblocks. In other words, they were in permanent position. The wheels had been taken off. The\nexhaust were piped in through the wall of that building. And I... We couldn't really\nunderstand what this was. We went inside the door; and there's a couple of my other men\nthere, standing there waiting for me. In the room....there was nobody 1n there, other than my\nown men. But there was human excretion, vomit, urine, blood all over the room. At this\npoint we're looking around, somebody had asked me what was going on. And I really had no\nidea. I did not understand. None of us did. One of the men went over to the far wall, uh, as I\nremember to my left. And there were shower heads and faucets all over the wall. He turned\nthem on. He called out to me; and he says, \"What the Hell's going on here?\" And I looked\nover questionly. And he said, \"There's no water.\" And I just shook my head. I didn't know.\n\"Ger: SS Totenkopfverbande.\n* According to US military records, the 99th Infantry Division was in the immediate vicinity north\nof Hadamar on March 27, 1945.\n* Also: \"Facility E.\" A killing center utilized by the Euthanasia program from January 1941 until\nliberation in 1945. Served as a replacement for the Grafeneck euthanasia center, which closed in\nDecember 1940. According to Arolsen, the exterminations carried out here were of the mentally ill\nand patients with TB and took place mainly from 1944-1945. According to camp records, more than\n10,000 people were killed.\nAnd just about this point.... And, of course, you can imagine what the odor was like in this\nroom. It was terrible. Uh, at that point, another man in a doorway motioned for us to come\nout into the back room. As we entered the back room, the room was filled with benches\nand...and, uh, uh, tables. And on the tables, there was thousands of gold wedding rings. And\nthere were diamond rings--uh, engagement rings, or whatever you want to call them in\nEurope. Uh, there was piles of human teeth with gold filling. These were all being separated.\nAnd then it was obvious that somebody was tn there counting them, and separating them.\nWe still just began to understand; but really didn't under....understand what was happening in\nthis camp, at that point. Uh, we went outside into the, uh, yard again. Only this is on the back\nside of the building, more or less. And here in front of me, I could see huge piles of human\nhair. I could see...as the Germans did everything very neatly, there were piles of boots, shoes,\nsuitcases, eyeglasses. And I stood there looking at the eyeglasses. And I couldn't imagine\nhow many thousands of people those eyeglasses represented, just sitting there in a huge pile.\nTo my left was hay wagons--four-wheel hay wagons and two-wheel push carts, which were\ncommon in Europe. Only, these wagons all contained nude bodies. They were separated; but\nthere was men, women, children, and even babies. All nude, all dead, all piled as high as\nthey basically could pile them on these wagons. And I remember going over and looking\nat...fairly close. Especially at some of the children--which...which was appalling to us. They\napparently had been just taken out of the building we just left, and been gassed. Uh, we...at\nthat point, one...another man came to me. And here again he said, \"You'd better come with\nus.\" And we followed them into another building behind. In the room, as we entered, here\nwas bodies thrown at random on the floor. On the far wall.... And, of course, you can\nimagine the odor was absolutely terrible in this place. Uh, on the, uh, far wall was a battery\nof ovens. Big ovens. Uh, I never did count the ovens, but they were on fire. Some of the\ndoors were open. There were bodies in the ovens, still burning. Uh, we were so shocked.\nAnd now we were beginning to understand that there was...this was some kind of an\nexecution camp. Or as we now call, extermination camp. Uh, we left the...that room, and\nwent out into the, uh, yard again. And still my men were scattering all over the place, uh...of\ncourse, looking for the German soldier; but now finding more and more, uh, things in the\ncamp. I turned my attention back to the original group of the \"slaves,\" as we called them\nthen. And as I walked across the yard, I called out to them. And I noticed...for...for one thing,\nof course, the condition of these people. As I can remember, they were all men. And now I\nassume that they were like a burial detail to handle all the bodies. Uh, but they were in a\nhorrible condition, uh, of starvation, of disease. The bodies...there was no flesh in their\nbodies. They were just skin...actual skin and bones. Their body odor was terrible. Uh,\nthere...and no hair, or literally no hair, on their bodies. Their eyes sunken way back in their\nheads. And as I approached them, I also saw the yellow star of David, uh, on their clothing.\nAnd coming from Boston and all the ethnic, uh, areas, that I understood that they were Jews.\nI called out to them as I approached them. I says, \"Does anybody speak English?\" And\nfinally, one man spoke up, uh, very much like a zombie; but he answered me, \"Yes,\" in\nEnglish. So I addressed him, uh, personally. And I came over to him; and I looked at him,\nand I said, \"We are American soldiers. It's all over. Do you understand what I'm saying to\nyou?\" And he stood there frozen in place. He wasn't looking at me. He was looking over my\nshoulder; and he was apparently looking at my men, who were still...some of them running\nthrough the buildings, uh, there. And then first thing...he wouldn't change his expression on\nhis face, but tears started coming down his face. And then he started to cry. And he started to\nsob. And then he started to sob his heart out; and he fell to the ground on his knees. And he\njust cried his heart out. And I stood there, standing there watching him, and waiting. And\nafter awhile, he regained his composure. And then he stopped crying. And then he spoke in\nYiddish. Which I had heard many times in the Boston area, and I recognized what it was.\nAnd then he told them that we were American soldiers. Now, at this point, there were other\nAmericans coming.\u201d And I could see over in the background, in other gates or other areas of\nthe camp, other Americans would come in. They began going through the hospital--because\nthis was a camp under the K-4 program,'' uh, where they were exterminating or cleansing\ntheir own nation, originally, and then went through many other peoples, uh, before they....\nAnd then they finally were exterminating the Jewish people, at this period of time that we\nwere there. And we then were ordered out of the camp to help re-engage the German\nsoldiers. And we left the other Americans in the camp. They saw many other things that I or\nmy group did not see. And then we...we continued fighting for that region. Uh, we pushed....\nThe best...",
        "A: To the moment that we arrived there. Uh, which was something very, very hard to\nunderstand. Uh, but, as I mentioned, that, uh, in the camps we learned that they were taking\nprisoners out the back gates to continue that time of killing what they called \"prime\nprisoners.\" And it took us a while longer before we would learn that fact, and then begin to\noutmaneuver them. (Clearing throat) And we continued pushing through northern Germany,\nto Kassel [approximately 60 miles northwest of Giessen]. And, uh...I believe that was about\nthe deepest penetration; uh, when we were ordered to hold up. And then, uh, this was getting\ninto an area that was declared by [the] Yalta Agreement\u2019 that would be Russian territory. So\nthat now, other troops would come in and take our place and hold this line. We were pulled\nout; and we would turn and head south--toward Nuremberg [Ger: Nurnberg], Frankfurt[-am-\nMain], Wurzburg, and that region. Going down through that area, we came to quite a number\nof other camps. Uh, there is no understanding in my mind, or...as to the difference in the\ncamps. At that time of...of uh, the war, uh, there were slave labor camps. Many of them. Uh,\nthere were, uh, of course, concentration camps--which I really wasn't realizing at that point--\nuh, that we were going into. Uh, sometimes, I would only just penetrate. Uh, we came to a\ncamp called Ohrdruf,\u2019\u201d as best as I can determine to this day. And now I'm starting to\n'\u00b0 This was probably the US 2nd Infantry Division, which was in Limburg-an-der-Lahn to the\nsouth of Hadamar on March 27, 1945.\n'' The actual designation for the Euthanasia program was \"Operation T4.\"\n'* An Allied Summit Conference took place in Yalta from February 4 to 11, 1945.\n\u00b0 Subcamp of Buchenwald; located in the province of Thuringia. Established November 1944\nand apparently liberated by American troops on April 4, 1945.\nremember more...just recently starting to remember more and more about this; putting\ntogether other facts from my own division, where we were at that time. But, as I can\ndetermine now, it was Ohrdruf.'* And it was a small camp. We came right to the middle,\napparently, of the camp itself--of the outside. There was nothing there in front of us but\nbarbed wire. Behind the barbed wire, we could see into the camp. And there were bodies\nlaying all over the place. There were some small buildings and so on. The odor, again, was\nterrible here. Uh, I radioed in to the captain, uh, that we had come to the barbed wire and\nsome kind of a camp. He ordered all of us to turn left, and go around the camp in that\ndirection. Apparently, one of the other companies was on our other flank would go the other\ndirection. As we walked along the barbed wire and we kept looking in. Of course, we were\nin a very depressed mood, uh, looking at...at all these bodies laying there. We could see\nsome were still alive, were still moving, even if they were only twitching, some of them.\nAnd we passed a gate. Whether it was the main gate, I don't know. But we passed a gate.\nAnd at that point, now other...all the rest of the company was, uh, was progressing the same\nway. Some [of] them--uh, American soldiers of our own, uh, outfit, and probably of our own\ncompany--were already inside the camp. Only a few. And, I believe, two men came over\ntoward us and started waving us anxiously to come in to help them. So I radioed to Captain\nPat,\u201d or the company command, and told them that we, uh, uh, were requested [to] uh, help,\nuh, there. He gave us permission to move into the camp. So as far as I know that only my\nsquad turned and went into the uh...to the camp itself. As we were walking in, as I say, there\nwas bodies laying literally all over the place. And as I can remember, here again on my left\nas I was coming in, there was some buildings. And there was a gallows. And I can't\ndistinguish in my mind at this point whether there was just one or more. And I believe there\nwas more gallows. But there was no rope. It was...it was wire that they were using for a\nnoose. Uh, during the short stay in there, one of the survivors--and there weren't very many\nas far as I know--had explained to me what the Germans were doing. There were pile...piles\nof bodies all around the gallows. And they were taking the prisoners, and making...forcing\nthem to stand under the gallows. They would tighten the noose around and then they would\nadjust it up on top. So they would pull them up and stretch them, so only their toes would\njust barely touch the ground. And they left them that way. And as I can understand, as I\nremember the prisoner telling me--or the survivor--that it took something like about 15\nminutes for them to die that way. And, of course, this was very disgusting to us, at that point.\nWe were also looking... trying to look at other things that we were seeing in the camp.\nThe...we were starting to wander among the bodies, to see if we could help some of them.\nAnd each one that I came to, I knew just by looking at them that they were beyond help. Uh,\neven...even...we didn't have any medics in our company. They had all been shot in the head\nby the snipers. And what little medicine we had.... Well, [there] was no medicine. All we had\nwas bandages, by that time there. Uh, I came to...now as I remember, uh, a nude woman.\n* Tt is by no means certain, but US military records indicate that the 99th Infantry Division could\nhave been in this vicinity between April 17 and April 21, 1945.\n'\u00b0 Identified by Mr. Whiteway as Captain William Patterson of Miami, Florida.\nAnd it was apparent she was pregnant. And I was standing there looking... And this 1s\nsomething terrible to me, in my mind. She had a rope tied around her legs. But it wasn't in a\nposition where apparently the prisoners or somebody had tied ropes on her ankles and\ndragged the body out. And it confused me. Why would the rope be tied around her legs?\nAnd I was standing there pondering that, uh, fact, when one of the survivors in that camp\nquietly came over beside me. And he began talking very softly. And he told me; he says she\nwas pregnant. And as the baby was being born, the SS troopers took her clothing off--or\nripped her clothing off, I think, is the way he put it--and then tied a rope tightly around her\nlegs. And then left her and the baby to die that way; because, naturally, the baby couldn't be\nborn. And, of course, that upset me very, very much. In fact, I've had some...some rather\nterrible nightmares over it. And I remember then getting orders to leave the camp, while\nothers.... There were now more apparently of the...the supporting troops were coming in.\nAnd they were coming in the camp, and they were spreading out with some medics. I can\nremember seeing some medics with their Red Cross armbands on. And we left; and we\nrejoined our company. And we began, again, in the combat. And we pushed south again.\nThere were other camps that we came to. Other men went in and so-called \"liberated\" the\ncamps and the prisoners. Uh, released them, or whatever. I can remember seeing just tidbits\nof different camps like that. And we kept on going. And now the German Army was\ndisintegrating, so that they would disappear and pull back as much as 50 miles in... And, uh,\nthen set up lines. We would come out of the woods. We'd come out of the buildings, and\ncome onto the, uh, roads, and walk the roads until the points we'd re-engage the Germans.\nAnd we'd spread out and re-engage them again. Uh, in doing this, we came, uh, into the area\nof, as I now know as, Bavaria. And we were going up a mountain. And up at the top, all ofa\nsudden...my two scouts were always up in front of me. And I was always the third man. Uh,\nthe rest of the men were behind me. Uh, the two scouts signaled, and they hit the ground. I,\nuh, signaled for all the men to hit the ground, and...uh, for cover. And then I crawled up to\nwhere the two scouts were. And they pointed up ahead; and I could see some men up\nthrough the woods--quite a distance from us--that were running from tree to tree. They were\nvery skittish. And observing them, uh, I assumed that they were of no danger, that they were\nnot German soldiers. Because they had no helmets and they had no rifles. Uh, they... First, I\nthought they were women; because they had a long robe on them that went all the way to the\nankles. Now, I've been able to understand that what they were was prisoners that were\nallowed out of that camp that we were going to come to. Uh, and they were on perhaps burial\ndetail. Uh, but the idea of the long gown or dress on them was that they were hobbled, so\nthey could not run. The bottom [of] the uniform or dress was very close at the ankle. But\nwhat they were doing there was they were hiding behind the tree. There was quite a few of\nthem. And they'd look around, just like rabbits; they were so scared. Then, one by one, they\nwould get up, pull up the skirts above their waist. And we kinda snickered, because here they\nwere...we realized they were men. They were totally nude. The only thing they had for\nclothing on was this, uh, dress. And they would hold it above their waist; and they'd run and\nthen dive behind another tree and drop their skirt. And as I say, it was kind of humorous, at\nthat point. But they [were] working their way to close to us. So I signaled for the men to\nskirmish and get ready for a gun fight, yust in case. And we were all camouflaged, and, uh,\nso on. Then these men worked their way fairly close to us. And all of a sudden, I stood up\nand I challenged them. I almost scared the living daylights out of them. They didn't know we\nwere there. They dived in behind the trees. And when they did, some of them started to cry,\nstarted to beg. Uh, one man finally came out. And I kept telling him in broken German, uh,\n\"We are American solders.\" And, uh, tried to get them to understand that, uh, we were not,\nuh, going to harm them. And one man, in particular, came crawling out on his elbows and\nhis knees--almost like a caterpillar. And he crawled quite fast. And he [was] working his way\ntoward me; and then he turned around and put his hands up in the form of a prayer, and kept\nbegging me in some foreign language, apparently not to kill him. And I tried to console him\nand uh...here again, tell him that we are Americans. He finally, suddenly, under...\ncomprehended what I was trying to say. And he look...looked up, and said something in a\nforeign language. But... \"American?\" And I shook my head yes. He went like a machine gun\nacross the floor, came over to...uh, in front of me. Now, he was breaking down. And he was\nshivering all over his body; and he started kissing the ground and started kissing my shoes,\nor my boots. And uh, then he wrapped his arms violently around my legs. And he was crying\nhis heart out. And then he turned around; and he spoke in a foreign language to the others to\ncome, and that it was safe. Here again, these prisoners were just like the ones back at\nHadamar--in a terrible, terrible shape. So I asked them in German, uh...uh, \"Wo ist der\ndeutsche Soldaten?\"--\"Where is the German soldier?\" And they pointed down. We...\n(Clearing throat) I'll skip the rest of that part of the story, uh, to get to the better points. Uh,\nwe took them... I detailed one man to stay back behind, uh, and take them with us. And we,\nuh ...forward...made uh...uh, and went forward down the side of the mountain, then. Halfway\ndown the hill, we could hear a strange, crackling noise. And now we're getting the same odor\nthat we had smelled at Hadamar. Terrible odor. Only now, there was no cloth for us to hold\nover our faces. We suddenly came to a, uh...a big field in the middle of the forest, and right\nto the very edge. And I was standing there; and there was prisoners in front of me. And there\nwas three groups. One group was coming up with hay wagons with bodies on them. As I\nremember, most all of them had clothing on. Uh, this is a very important point. Because I\nlearned from President [Chaim] Herzog, uh, when I asked him, that \"Why were some nude\nand some others not?\" And he pointed out that, uh, the nude ones were usually Jews.\nBecause they believed in their religion that the worst thing that could happen to them was to\ngo to God in the nude. These prisoners, most of them were clothed, at that point. Or, the\nbodies on the wagons. And the prisoners were pushing the wagons up by hand. There was\nanother group at that point coming in from the forest carrying six-foot logs. The first group,\nin front of me, was taking the logs and laying them on the ground, side by side. Then they\nwere taking, uh, the bodies, and laying them across; and another row of bodies...uh, of logs, a\nrow of bodies. And building them up, uh, approximately as high as they could reach; but\napproximately seven, eight feet high. And we're standing there, all of us shocked. My own\nmen and these prisoners. They didn't know who we were. And I took a very close look at\nsome of the pyres of all these prisoners and all these dead bodies uh...uh, there. Many of the\npyres were on fire. And there were other pyres all over the field that were in all different\nstages of construction. And I was so shocked that I didn't talk to any of these prisoners. I just\nsignaled one man [to] go round them up and bring them all to me. And then I just simply\nasked them, \"Wo ist der deutsche Soldaten?\" And they pointed down. So we headed down.\nWe took the...those prisoners along with the others. Uh, the others I had detailed to go back\nbehind the lines with a, uh...I had a medic coming up to get them. Now, as we came down to\nthe bottom into the valley, I suddenly come to a road that was going across me. Off to the\nleft was some city. And most of my battalion was now throwing out artillery and throwing\nthe mortar shells in. They were attacking the city. So I turned my attention to my right. And\nhere was a huge camp. This was apparently the main road coming out of the city nght\nstraight into the main, uh, gate of the camp. There was two rows of barbed wire--electrified,\nas I can remember. And in fact, I'm sure; because we blew the transformer. There were\ntowers--guard towers--on the outside. I signaled; I sent some up in the guard towers, and\nthey disarmed the, uh, machine guns. Uh, a couple more men went over to the transformer.\nWe blew the transformer. Then we blew the gate in. And we ran in, dispersed as usual; and I\nran off to the left. I got...landed on my knees so I could watch my men, to make sure that\nthey were doing things right and covering each other. And in front of me... This camp was\ncalled--as I now know it--Dachau 3B.'\u00b0 Uh, this...in front of me was a series of barracks. At\nthe point that I landed on my knees, I could see behind some of the barracks; and there was a\ngroup of people. I believe that they were all male, but I'm not sure. They were all hanging;\nbut they [were] hanging in grotesque positions. They weren't hanging by the neck. I pointed\nto Hopper \u2019 and another man: \"Go over there and cut them down.\" So they left, uh, and I\ndetailed a couple more men to cover them. And at that point, I, uh, made a run for the\nbarracks in front of me, that was on a long, uh, ways to me. And the door was in the small\npart... end of the barracks. And in combat, you don't walk through a door. We dived through\nthe door. Goggleye\u2019\u00ae dived over the top of me; and we come up all ready to engage\nsomebody. Uh, as we got in, I was shocked; because there was nobody to fight. Instead, here\nwas a whole series--all along my left side, all the way down--of bunks. Uh...I believe, but I'm\nnot exactly sure...I believe there were three tiers. The prisoners were in the bunks--as many\nas they could get in them, all laying across the bunks. And we went into a, uh...a thing of\ntrying to tell them that we were American soldiers. \"Does anybody speak English?\" And\nfinally, one little, uh, Frenchman in the first row of bunk...uh, first bunk, uh, he asked me--in\nFrench, at first--1f I was an American soldier. And he began to comprehend. And I told\nhim.... And I couldn't understand why they wouldn't get out of the bunk...uh, or the beds.\nAnd, uh, so I told Goggleye, \"Go over there and find out what the heck's the matter with\nthem.\" And he told me...he said, \"They're chained at the ankle.\" So we come over and took\na look at them; and they had a heavy logging chain and some kind of an iron clamp on their\n'\u00b0 Tt is clear from documentation on the movements of the 99th Division and from supplementary\ninformation provided by Mr. Whiteway that \"Dachau 3B\" must have been a sub-camp of Dachau.\nResearch performed by Dr. Robert Kesting in the U. S. military records located at the National\nArchives in Suitland, Maryland, appear to indicate that the term \"3B\" was used to refer to the\nMuhldorf sub-camp of Dachau. This identification is consistent with U. S. military records, which\nindicate that Mihldorf was in the zone assigned to the 99th Infantry Division and affiliated units\n(i.e., 14th Cavalry Group/Armored and the 86th Infantry Division).\n'\u2019 Tdentified by Mr. Whiteway as Otis Hopper of Hartselle, Alabama.\n'\u00ae Tdentified by Mr. Whiteway as Ray Goggleye. Died in 1978.\nankles, every one of them. So I told, uh, the men, \"Find the locks.\" And on the end of the\nlocks... Not \"find the locks,\" but \"find the key.\" There was a big iron lock on each, uh, bunk.\nAnd he couldn't find the key; so I told him, \"Okay, shoot the locks off.\" And, of course, we\nhad to be careful where the bullet was going. But they shot...had to shoot the locks all the\nway down the barracks, through every series of, uh, bunks. And then all... instantly, all the\nprisoners were pulling the chains out quickly. And then they come over, and started hugging\nand kissing us and all that. We proceeded through the length of the barracks and went out the\nother door, and went into the second barracks. In the second barracks was exactly the same\nas the first barracks. But now, the prisoners from the first barracks were following me and\nmy men. We burst in the door. This time, we walked in the door. The only thing that was\ndifferent about this barracks was the condition of the prisoners. That they were on the verge\nof death. Here they were all chained. It was obvious that all food and water was shut off from\n[them]. And they were so weak. And the odor was terrible in this barrack. But they were so\nweak that they could not push themselves on their elbow. They were laying there and putting\none hand out; and they.... Instantly, everybody in the barracks were looking at me. And they\nwere begging in all kinds of foreign languages, apparently, for food and water. And\neveryone of us had different reactions. Now some of the guys were bumping up against me,\ncoming in and being shocked. And I remember Goggleye was down on his knees; and being\nan Indian, uh, and a Catholic, he was giving the sign of the cross and he was saying some\nprayers. Somebody behind me was swearing, and he was, uh, promising revenge. Uh, a\ncouple of the newer men turned around and went back out of the barracks; and they were\nvomiting. And every one of us, as I say, had a different reaction. And I got the strangest\nfeeling that I wanted to understand, somehow, what a German guard would feel like in this\nbarracks. So while everybody's standing there, uh... reacting, I slung my rifle over my\nshoulder and I stood up like a guard would do. And I marched all the way down the length of\nthe building, and turned around and came back, as a German soldier would. And alls I saw\nwas a whole handful of...hundreds of hands, literally, following me all the way up the\nbarracks and all the way back, begging. And they wouldn't stop begging. As I got back to the\nend again, the little Frenchman--who was now my self-appointed interpreter.... He could\nspeak five languages, as I remember. And he recognized somebody in the second bunk. And\nhe ran over to him; and he turned around. He was pointing to me, apparently tell him that we\nwere American soldiers and that it was all over. But his friend wouldn't put his hand down.\nHe still had his hand out. So I saw the Frenchman put, uh, his hand down like this. And the\nhand come up again. And he wouldn't stop. And he didn't even recognize his own buddy, his\nfriend. And it was a very, very emotional thing to...to see. And about at that point, we heard\nan awful ruckus outside. So we burst out both, uh, doorways of the barracks. And now, in\nthe yard that was totally empty before, was hundreds of people. A sea of humanity of the\nprisoners from this huge camp that was beyond us. And I remember seeing men and women\nnow here. And, uh, they... What had happened at this point, and what the ruckus was all\nabout, [was] that Bob Riggs\u201d and, I believe, Hopper had gone across the way to another\nbarracks.\n\u201d Identified by Mr. Whiteway and in documentation as PFC. Robert C. Riggs--Army Service No.\n42130776, SSN 069-01-0218--from Reno, Nevada. Died in 1978.",
        "A: These were my own men of my squad. I'm sorry. I should point there...there was\napproximately eight of us, at that point. And that's all I had left, uh, because of the, uh,\ncasualties. And Bob Riggs, uh, was bringing 20 German women guards out of this building,\nand marching them across the yard toward...to bring them to me. And, of course, the German\nwomen were... were military woman in uniform--very huge, powerful women. Well-fed;\nwhich appalled me at the time, because of the comparison of all these prisoners being so\nhorribly starved. Uh, it infuriated me to see these women so well fed at that point. And they\nmarched in a military, uh, rank of two toward me. And all these prisoners were trying to get\nto them and kill them. I don't believe they could really hurt them. Maybe they could. But\nthere was no.... Here again, there was no flesh in their bodies, no muscles or anything like\nthat. Uh, we ran out between them. And we held our rifles horizontal, and we tried to hold\nthis massive crowd back. At that point, uh, Whitey Hall\u2019\u2019--another squad leader--was going\nby the main gate. And he saw we were in trouble; and he brought his men in--approximately\neight or nine men--and he...they ran over and stood beside us, and tried to hold this crowd\nback. And I called out to...here again, Applegate--which was a very tall man--uh, and I told\nhim...I says, \"You take these women out of here, and get them out of the camp. Get them out\nof sight, so I can get control of the crowd.\" So he doubletimed the women out of the camp.\nLater, he come back and told me that he had marked them for war crimes. We were\nbeginning to understand there was something very wrong in this camp. So in the meantime,\nonce he got them out of sight, uh, then I started talking to the crowd. And I started telling\nthem, \"There's not going to be any killing. It's all over. You're free. Do you understand this?\"\nAnd the crowd, of course, the...they were so infuriated at seeing these women that,\nuh...the...there was electricity in the air. The hatred, the bitterness was there. And it was very\nobvious. And so I kept telling them that I'm not going to permit any killing, and, uh, that\n\"You're now free.\" But they couldn't understand this. And all of a sudden, in the crowd, uh,\nthere was a lot of people talking very excitedly to certain people, which it turned out to be,\nuh, people who could speak English. And so they would interpret these stories. And they\nbegan--I remember this very distinctly--one of the first stories. There was a Jewish woman\nright out in front of me. And you couldn't tell very, uh, well a difference of a woman from a\nman in those camps. They were so badly starved that a woman's breast is totally dissolved by\nher body. So there was no hourglass shape, or anything else. They had basically the same\nclothing as the other prisoners. Their hair was shaved off their heads. Usually, I could\nidentify by the tone of the voice whether they were male or female. And this woman spoke\nout; and--in English--and she started telling me. Uh, uh, she tried to describe what the\nGerman women--these German women-- were doing to these prisoners daily. That they\nwould take a group of perhaps 20 to 30 prisoners, and march them in two ranks to a specific\npart of the camp where the slit trenches--the toilets--were. And now as I mentioned, there's\nno flesh on their bodies, so they could not physically resist anything. One German woman,\n*\u2019 Identified by Mr. Whiteway as Staff Sargeant Alfred Hall of Winchester, Kentucky.\nas she described, would get down on her knees in front of a slit trench. She would reach up\nand grab two prisoners by the back of the head, force them down on their knees, force them\nto bend over. And then push their faces in human excretion, and hold them there until they\nsmothered to death. All the time laughing. As well as the other German women, who were\nsurrounding the prisoners. It was, uh...as she described it, was a daily game for them. In the\nmeantime, all the prisoners in the two ranks had to stand there and watch. But also they had\nto understand that each and every one of them, this was going to be done to them before they\nwere done. And they did this daily. Another person in the crowd called out. And they...uh, he\nwas yelling something about the dogs, the dogs. And then he began talking about how the\nGermans--guards--some of them would be going with packs of dogs. And at any time, they\nwould suddenly just point to one of the prisoners and command the dogs to attack that\nprisoner and tear him apart viciously. And as I have described to the kids in school today, as\nbad as it was, at least that person...it was over for that particular person. But for...the\npsychological thing that happened, and what the Germans were doing, was that they were\nputting the fear into all the others. So they had to think from then on that, \"When is it going\nto be my turn?\" The Germans, uh, we...we're learning that they could not simply just kill\nsomebody; but they had to humiliate and they had to terrorize, all at the same time. There\nwere many other stories. Another person in the crowd began calling out; and telling me,\n(clearing throat) here again, about the dogs. That in the winter, that the German guards\nwould select a prisoner--man or woman. They were given--him or her--a shower, a hot\nshower. And immediately take them out of the shower nude into the yard, in the snow storm;\nand command them to sit there, surrounded, uh, by killer dogs who were, uh,\nplaced...commanded to be on guard. And this prisoner... Now the guards would go back into\nthe barracks and watch. And this prisoner had a choice of sitting there in the snow storm and\nfreezing to death, or move and have the dogs attack them. And they went on telling me story\nafter story. And finally, I put my hands up. And I told them, I said, \"I've heard enough. I\ndon't want to hear anymore. It's all over.\" At that point, as I can remember, a little\nFrenchman in the crowd began to sing quietly, very hoarsely, the...\"\"La Marseillaise\"--the\nFrench national anthem. As he began singing, then some others--spotted all through the\ncrowd--began to sing along side of them. Apparently, they were French. Then, Bob Riggs\ncame for me. He said, \"You'd better come with me.\" So the rest.... These men.... Americans\nwere still standing there, now that we had laid our weapons down. Uh, but at that point, the\nsurvivors--as we now call them--began singing other songs that...that I didn't recognize.\nWe...Bob took me over to the barracks of the women guards. As we entered the room, the\nfirst room was a...what we in the army call a \"day room.\" This is where, normally in the\narmy, you would write letters, read, and relax. I was so shocked when I walked into this\nroom that I pretended I didn't see it. And I turned my attention; and off to my right was a\ndoorway and a hallway. And I quietly... And now there were some of my men, a couple of\nmy men coming in; there was a few survivors coming in. Nobody at this point was talking.\nAnd I went down the hallway, and I looked into the bedrooms. And each one of the\nbedrooms was neat, just like a normal army, uh, room. Orderly. All the uniforms were hung\nup on the left. The bunk was made in a, uh...uh, military, uh, fashion. Everything neat, and in\nits place. Nothing was wrong. And this puzzled me. And I turned around, and I walked back\nout of the...away from the bedrooms, and back into this room again. And in the room was\ntables all over the place. On the tables were lamps. Some of them had several lamps. The\nlamps themselves were made of human bones. The lamp shades were made of human skin\nwith tattoos. I recognized that immediately. I walked over and was starting to look at\ndifferent ones, and tried to comprehend what all these things I was seeing. The little French\nin...uh, uh, my interpreter now, the little Frenchman came over beside me. \"Monsieur, do\nyou understand what that is?\" At this point, his face was covered with tears. And I said,\n\"What...it looks like human skin with tattoos.\" He says, \"Yes.\" He says they would find a\nprisoner with the tattoos, and hold him or her down out here in the yard in front of us. And\nthen they, uh, would actually skin them alive, these women. He made a point that it was\nthese German women. They would actually skin them alive, somehow; and then hand the\nskin to the prisoners, who had to somehow cure and make these lamp shades. On the walls\nall around the room were picture frames, all different sizes, with human skin and tattoos. On\nthe shelves... Well, off to my right, a row of shelves along here, there were male sex organs\nhad been cut off. All different sizes. I believe it was Bob Riggs, but I'm not sure. One of my\nmen was down [at] the end, right by the hall door. And he just motioned to me, uh, with his\nhead. As I say, here [we] was not talking. And I walked down to him; and he nodded toward\nthis object that was in front of me. And I... can remember just thinking, \"A hairy blob. What\nis it?\" Because I was only 19 years old at this time. (Clearing throat) Uh, \"Monsieur...\" The\nlittle Frenchman had come up beside me again. He said, \"You know what that is?\" I said,\n\"No.\" And Bob didn't know what it was. He said, \"That's a woman's crotch. They held her\ndown, and cut that out of her. And preserved it, and put it right there.\" And I was pretty well\ndisgusted. There were sexual organs--breasts and everything else. Male and female sexual\norgans, all over the room, all preserved. There were human heads. There were bones of\ndifferent kinds, and... And by this time, my mind was becoming boggled with the things that\nwe were finding in this room. And I left... At that point somewhere, Little Cheeco--one of\nmy men, uh, an Indian--came for me. And he says, \"You'd better come with me, again.\" And\nI followed him out of that room, leaving the other survivors and...and some of my men there.\nWe walked out across the yard. At this point, the survivors were all still stinging, uh, there.\nAnd we were approaching a small building that I took to be like a Red Cross building. A\nsmall first-aid building 1s what it looked like. Much like here, when they go swimming in the\nsummer. I came up by the door--and by this time, I apparently been kind of getting used to\nthe horrors that we were finding. And I called out to Big Chief--a six-foot seven Indian, uh, a\nhuge man--was standing right in the doorway, with his back to me. And I called out to him,\n\"Chief, what have you got?\" And he just turned around slowly, and he looked me with the\nmost God-awrful look of shock on his face. And he couldn't talk. His lips were quivering. He\nwas trying to say something, but he couldn't talk. So I saw an expression on his face; he\ndecided what to do, and he took a giant step to one side, out of my way. And I entered the\ndoor, and I looked. Inside the room--as I say a small room--the Germans had erected some\nkind of a board upright, much like a sheet of plywood. And here, they had taken a prisoner\nand they had stripped him; and they had nailed him with spikes--common spikes with the\nheads on them--through his elbows and through his wrist that I saw. Nailed him like this,\nspread-eagled on that board. And I could see where they had taken apparently a scalpel, and\nthey had cut his throat on the side here...his vocal cords somewhere. So he couldn't scream.\nSo, in other words, apparently they...they did not give him any anesthesia. He was looking at\nme and he was shaking his head; and he was begging with his little eyes, pleading with me.\nThey had begun... They had already taken and cut open, uh, his chest, and taken his rib cage\noff. And I remember on the left side of, uh...of him[, his rib cage] was hanging on nails. They\nhad taken some of, uh, his intestines, and hung them on the right on nails. And I could see\nhis lungs--bluish and foamy-like looking--uh, pulsating inside of him. In other words, they...\nthey were dissecting him alive. Experimenting on him. And I didn't know what to do. You\nknow, some of the other men behind me coming 1n now were getting shocked like that. And\nI remember Goggleye saying, \"What in the Hell are we going to do?\" I said, \"Get outside\nthe building here.\" Because we...our radios--uh, the 536, we call it--uh, would not work\ninside the building like they do today. I said, \"Get outside the building here. Call the\ncompany. Tell them what we've found.\" Which he had already been reporting,\nuh...everything. \"And give them the name, the identification of this building in particular.\nTell them, for God's sake, somewhere, get a hold of a doctor. A surgeon, in particular; to try\nto help this man.\" Then I ordered everybody to get out of that room, so that perhaps we\ncould save him and not give him any disease. Because we were all filthy. And so I sealed the\nroom...the room off that way. And then I went back to the, uh...the uh...group of the\nsurvivors. And this [was] a sea of humanity, of survivors, out there singing. And I began\ntalking a little bit with them again, and telling them that it's all over. And it's about at this\npoint that they began to understand that they were liberated. Because now they turned and\nstarted looking at each other; and there was tears coming down their faces, but there were\nsmiles. They began to hug and kiss each other. And you kno...of course, European men,\nespecially, will kiss each other. They began to take and hug each other...uh, and cry. And\nthey started, a lot of them, locking their arms together; and they began singing. And it was\nvery, very emotional thing to see. And as I say, it was the beginning of them really\nunderstanding that they were liberated.",
        "A: The SS were already...at least deeper into the camp; and were on their way out, uh, with, uh,\n\"prime prisoners,\" out the other side. This 1s the first time that I can remember that we\nrealized what was going on. That some of the other prisoners had, uh, told us that the SS--\napparently through all the excitement and everything else--now one of us has asked them\nwhere 1s the...what...what happened to the SS there. And they told us, \"They're going out the\nother side.\" So I...1 remember radioing the company, and telling them that this column 1s\ngoing out the other side. The...we had orders then to leave that camp and rejoin the company,\nand fight for the city. So I called all the men together. We formed a line down the road, and\nwe started marching forward out the main gate into the city. All the survivors were following\nus. As we reached the city....",
        "A: All right.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTAPE #2",
        "A: All right. Now, you must understand that an awful lot of these things that I have been\ndescribing is very, very difficult to talk about.",
        "A: No. No, uh, that I did not. Uh, I have often wondered about that; and people have asked me\nabout that man. Uh, we had to leave him in that condition. And (clearing throat) so we\nturned; and we started, side-by-side, walking down this main street with thousands of the\nsurvivors. And I don't... And I'm not exaggerating. This camp must have been huge. And\nthey were all walking behind us, very quietly. And, of course, I turned around a couple of\ntimes; and I told them, \"You people go back. Because we're going to start shooting now, and\nI don't want you people hurt.\" But they stayed nght with us. And it was almost like a parade.\nAnd shortly, we came to the first houses on the outskirts of the city. And suddenly, a\nwoman--a German woman--come running out the right hand side, uh, toward me. And she,\napparently, knew that I was the commanding, uh, man in this group. She reached me and\ngrabbed me by the shirt, and locked her hands into my shirt. And she began begging me.\nAnd she said, \"I was teacher in America, in Cleveland, Ohio, uh, before the war.\" And then\nshe looked around. She was scared. And she started telling me that she didn't know anything\nof what was going on in that camp. \"I didn't know! I didn't know!\" And I became rather\ninfuriated at that point. And I turned around. Now all the...most of the European people are\nsmaller than we are, except for the German people. And I turned around; and here's a sea of\nhumanity. And I could see over the top of their heads. And I could see the camp, uh, which\nwasn't very far from us. I could see the gates. I could see the barbed wire. I could see the\ntowers. And I could actually see the...the hanging ropes, where we cut all these people down.\nAnd incidently, in those ropes... Hopper had come to me, uh, earlier, and he brought me over\nthere after they cut them down. And these people--most of them that had clothing on--they\ntied their wrists behind them, and then they hung them by the wrist backwards. There was\ntwo people, two men, that were nude. They tied their wrists behind them and...with piano\nwire; and then they took a hook of some kind, and they ran it through their privates. And\nthey hung them upside down and left them that way. Which is an appalling thing to do to\nsomebody. Anyway, this woman came to me. And she [was] telling...trying to tell me that\nshe didn't know. The odor of this whole area was terrible. And then I turned back to her, after\nlooking back at the camp and even seeing the ropes from this distance; and I slapped her\nhard across the face. I was infur...I was furious. And I called her a...a damn liar. And she fell\nto the ground, let go of my shirt. And she was crying. And we all walked around her and\nkept on going. All of a sudden...and I ordered my men then... Now, [when] we got to the\nbuildings, I said, \"Some of you guys start going through these...this building over here. Some\nof you guys start going through there.\" All of a sudden, the...the survivors themselves began\nrunning like mad. And I said, \"Whoa!\" I started yelling at them, \"Whoa! Wait a minute!\nCome back here!\" I says, \"You can't go in there. There's going to be shooting. And they're\ngoing to go there.\" And I says, uh...and I realized now, looking at this massive crowd that\nthere's no way 16 of us are gonna, uh, control this mob--especially if they get excited. So I\ntold them, \"Okay. Go ahead. You help find the...the German soldier.\" \"But,\" I says, \"He's\nmy prisoner. You bring him back here, and you put him right there on the ground. I'll stay\nright here.\" So I stood in the middle of the street. My men and the survivors started going\nthrough all the buildings, all the closets, and everything else. They found...actually found\narmed, uh, Wehrmacht soldiers, uh, and dragged them down the street. They were spitting at\nthem. They were kicking at them, and all this; but they, uh, abided by my rule, and they\nbrought them and threw them on the ground beside me. When I...I noticed that they would\nstart getting excited and start talking like mad, then I would tell them, \"Okay. Go find me\nsome more, uh, German soldiers.\" And they'd take off and they'd start scattering, running\nagain. When they did that, then I ordered one of my men to take these prisoners; and take\nthem back behind and turn them over as prisoners. I didn't want a massacre here. We finally\ncame to the edge of the city, after going through. There wasn't much of a fight in the city.\nThe...most of everybody had deserted. And then Captain...uh, the Colonel of our battalion\nordered us into the woods instead. Uh, which was normal procedure; because we knew once\nthe German army found out that we had taken the city, that they would actually blow up their\nown city with artillery. So I turned around to the survivors. And I told them...I said, \"Now, I\nwant all of you to go back. We're going in the forest. All of you go back to the camp, where\nyou're gonna be safe. Because now the Germans are going to shell the city, and\nblow...destroy it. And I don't want you people hurt.\" They abided; and they turned around.\nUh, many of them throwing kisses to us, and that kind of thing (clearing throat) there. The...\nWe went into the woods and dug in for the night. And then I started to walk from hole to\nhole. Little foxholes, two men usually in each hole. And I was checking for the positions, to\nmake sure they were digging in the right position for defense and all that. As I came to each\nhole--and I'm standing up in the dead of night, and I'm looking down at the men--and I\nbelieve that every single man was crying. And they'd look up at me; and generally, the gist of\nit was that most of them looked up at me and said...asked me, \"Why?\" Of course, I\nunderstood what they were asking me. Why did the Germans do that to those people? And I\nhad no answer for them. The next morning, or sometime during the night, we moved out.\nAnd we began engaging the German Army and chasing them through the woods. And, uh,\nwe came to a huge valley. The entire battalion came to the valley. And the Germans were\nacross the valley... and with ack-ack batteries. And they were firing...now firing at us. So that\nColonel Hook decided that the only way to take them was to order us to, uh, spread out as far\nas we could, and stand up and walk across the entire valley. And which we did. As we\ngot...uh, I had one of the points. In other words, the foremost troops in the group. And as we\ncome to the edge of the, uh, hills and started to go up the hills, the Germans that were up\nthere on the artillery guns began to desert their guns and run. We climbed up and began [to]\noverrun the guns themselves. And at this point, I noticed two of my new men, that, uh, just\ncame into combat for the first time, had three German SS prisoners. The SS wore different\nuniforms entirely than the Wehrmacht did. And I noticed...at that point, I ran...began to run\nover to where they were. And I fired a shot at one of them. One of the SS troopers had his\nhands down like this. And I fired a shot at his feet; and I yelled for him to \"Hands hoch!\"--\n[to] put his hands high. And my two men began to call out, \"Well, we got the situation well\nin hand.\" And I told them they were crazy; that they were almost dead men. And I pointed\nout that the one SS trooper with his hands down low was reaching down to touch the buckle\non his belt. It was a big brass buckle, with a Swastika and so on on it. Touch a button, the\nheavy brass buckle dropped down. Instantly, three little tiny barrels of 22 shots drop down\nand would fire directly into your belly. And we.... Thus, we called them \"belly guns.\" And\nso all this time that I was chastising my men and teaching them this, I was watching the\neyes--or the faces--of these SS troopers. They had the Death['s]-Head SS insignia on them.\nSo then I knew by the expression on their face, that one...which one could speak English.\nAnd I addressed him immediately. And I said, \"Were you men in this camp behind us?\"\nAnd the SS trooper looked at me, and he realized I knew he spoke English. And he said,\n\"Yes.\" And then I searched for a question. And I knew it was ridiculous for me to ask him\nwhy they put people behind the prison...behind barbed wire, why they tortured them and\nmurdered them and all this; because of the attitude of the German nation at that time. So I\nfinally decided; and asked him, \"Well, why didn't you, at least, take care of the...treat the\ndiseases in the camp?\" And he look at me, and he stood erect. And he said, \"Why should\nwe? They were all going to die anyway.\" And I had everything I could do to control my\ntemper, and not kill the three of them right then and there. So I reached out, and I grabbed\nthe, uh...the, uh...the Death['s|-Head insignia off all three of them. I took the belly gun off the\none; and I took another belt buckle off the...off a second one. And (clearing throat) with our\nmorals.... And people have asked me many times since then, \"At the scene, or leaving the\ncamp... When you left the camp, why didn't you go into the city and shoot every German that\nyou found?\" And the only answer I have is that because the Germans--or the German SS\ntroopers, 1n particular--became animals in those days didn't mean that I could lower myself\nto those standards. And that was a very, very important part, or fact[or], in those days: that\nwe had to have something to stand by and believe in.",
        "A: No. Uh, we just uh searched them thoroughly and, uh, made sure that they didn't have any\nweapons, or any--like the SS normal...very often did--have, uh, TNT inside their shirts. And\nthey...at times, they would actually blow themselves up--and you with them--as you searched\nthem. But we, uh...we searched them thoroughly. And then, uh, I detailed one man to take\nthem back as prisoners and turn them over to...to our company headquarters. And...and thus\nback to a prison camp. But they were marked as war crimes, as were the German women\nguards at the camp, uh, there. Uh, now, we really didn't understand what would happen to\nthem from that point on. Except that they would...we hoped, would draw more attention than\nthe other prisoners would, uh, that we would turn back to them.",
        "A: Yah. Then we continued on that particular day, as I remember. And now we had learned,\nuh... In fact, we had overrun the column that had gone out the back side of that camp. I\nbelieve--and...and I'm assuming--uh, uh, but through certain other facts, that in this particular\ncolumn was Dov Shelanski (ph), who eventually became the Prime Minister of Israel.\u201d\u2019 Uh,\nI do understand, uh, that he was in this column being taken away and that the Germans were\nkilling the prisoners as fast as they could while they were taking them back away from our\nline. Now, we had cut through and cut them off and...uh ...the men, as I can remember at this\nparticular column, they uh... the men were coming down out of the woods and seeing and\nhearing the Germans shooting the prisoners. And perhaps...and they were bayoneting them,\nand whatever. I believe they shot everyone of those guards. They didn't give them a chance\nto surrender. But then they relieved these prisoners that were coming out of the camp. Now,\nwe moved on; and we were coming to another camp not very far away, called Moosburg.\u201d\nThe quick, uh, history of Moosburg that it was designed as a Stalag [NB: Prisoner of War\ncamp] for the airmen.\u201d And they were normally treated rather quite well during the war,\nuntil this period of time. The camp was designed for 3,000 prisoners. Now, as we overran the\ncamp, [it] held over 30,000 prisoners 1n it. Instead of having just airmen, prisoners from the\nAllies--that would be the Canadians, English, and the Americans--they now held a lot of\nJews that had been taken away from the master camp at Dachau and Dachau, uh, No. 2 were\nin Moosburg. There were many of our own men [NB: from the US 394th Infantry\nRegiment], that were captured during the Battle of the Bulge, uh, were brought down on\nforced march. And they knew they didn't have a chance, apparently, to go by and go into\nMauthausen. So they detoured them into Moosburg. At this point, we had....because of\nDachau 3B, we knew that what the Germans were doing...that they were taking prisoners out\nthe back gate. So our battalion that night made a \"pincer movement\"--as the Germans called\nit--attacked heavily, and one point broke through the German line. We came in during the\nnight, behind the camp of Moosburg. In front, the armored uh...uh, battalion that was\nattached to us came in at the main gate. I understand that they had a bit of fight to begin with;\nand then they broke in and blew their way in the gate, and came in the front gate. Uh,\nthen...uh, I and my men were given, shall we say, a little bit of a reprieve and told to come in\nthe back gate. And we started finding some of our own buddies, that had been captured\nduring the Bulge, in there. Uh, which was an incredible thing; because at this stage of the\nwar and everything else, whether on purpose or design.... Uh, but all these men were horribly\nstarved. These were American soldiers, Jews...as I say, there were other Europeans there.\nThey were many... The... And we noticed distinctly that the British, Canadians, American\nairmen that were there were in much better physical condition. They were much better\ntreated, whether by...by design or...or events, uh, there. The American soldier from the 99th\nDivision, the 106th and the 28th Division that were brought in, in these columns were in\nhorrible condition. And, uh, of course, as I say, we got a chance to talk with some of them.\nAnd I remember so distinctly some of the men talking to me excitedly. And they said, \"Do\nyou remember when we were back in Camp Maxey, Texas, and two orders were--when we\nwere declared hot....\"\" In other words, the outfit was fit for combat, and we were now going\n*! There has been no Prime Minister of Israel by this name since 1948.\n* According to US military records, this would have happened around April 29 or April 30, 1945.\n\u00b0\u00b0 Officially designated by the Nazis as Stalag VIIA.\nto go to Europe in combat. Two orders came down from the higher command. Number one,\nthat all men with tattoos would have their tattoos removed at their cost. No reason given for\nthat. Now we had gone through Dachau, we knew why. But obviously, the American Army\nknew long time before what was happening to prisoners. Number two, all men in the line\ncompanies--now, roughly speaking, half the infantry, uh, divisions are behind the lines as\nintelligence, as supply, artillery, and all this kind of thing. But the linemen were the men who\nwere going to actually do the fighting, were in the line companies, [and] all had to be\ncircumcised. And I understand the 106th Division, which was formed about the same time\nwe were, was treated the same way. Now, these men were describing in Moosburg what\nhappened. \"...that you remember back there, when we were circumcised?\" \"Yes, I\nremember.\" Now, when they were captured during the Battle of the Bulge and the Germans\nbegan examining them, they found these men circumcised--at the same period of time that\nthe Germans are hunting all over Europe for the Jew, the only men in Europe at that time that\nwere circumcised. And here they had black men. They had Indians. They had Mexicans.\nAnd they had all the different religious men were circumcised. And I would assume that they\nwere probably dumbfounded. But they separated them from the other Americans. The Black\nmen, almost immediately as soon as they captured them, they took them aside. And we're\nfinding out now they piano wired their wrists behind them; and then they began to bayonet\nthem, sticking the bayonets up under their throat here, through their privates, and through\nother parts of their bodies first, before they finally ran them through and killed them. And\nthey left them.",
        "A: These were American soldiers. Black men. Uh, I have now been asking an awful lot of the\nex-POWs the same question. \"Have you, while you were an American soldier...prisoner of\nthe Germans, did you--on the force marches, the death marches, or in the prison camps--ever\nsee any American Black soldiers?\" And every one of them, at this point now--and I'm\ngetting an awful lot of letters in--every one of them answered me, \"No.\" They've never seen\na Black prisoner back in Germany. In the columns, as they were captured and taken back to\nbehind the lines during the Bulge, the SS troopers who--most of them could speak English--\nbegan ordering the prisoners to expose their dog tags. So the American took the dog tags out,\n[and] hung them out. Immediately, the Germans started...uh, the SS trooper started going\ndown, uh, the prisoners, looking at their dog tags. Your name 1s on it. There is a letter\ndesignat...on the top, designating your blood type; and on the bottom, there is a letter\ndesignating your religion. Every man with a letter H--\"Hebrew\"--was immediately pushed\naside, and their heads were blown off right there. They were also looking for the man of\nGerman descent. Apparently, the Germans resented that they didn't go to Germany and join\nthe German Army. But immediately in the columns, as I understand now from these men,\nthey realized what was happening. They began--the Indians, the Mexicans, the men of dark\nskin--began swapping dog tags with the Jew. Other men, uh, Catholics and Protestant, began\npassing up their Bibles to the Jews. And thus, they could...many of them bluffed their way\nthrough. Uh, very close friend of mine--George Golman, from Dallas, Texas--uh, still had...\nLast year, when he called me from Dallas, and he told me: he says, \"Whitey,\" he says, \"you\nknow, I still have that Bible that saved my life.\" He said, \"When the SS trooper came for\nme, he started to reach out for the dogtag. And I started telling him that I was a Catholic.\"\nAnd he says, \"I can recite anything in the book. You open the page, and I'll recite it to you.\"\nAnd he bluffed his way; uh, and the SS trooper moved on. And thus this...these tactics saved\na lot...a lot of these men's lives. It was an incredible facts that are coming out now, of what\nhappened to those men. Now, I find with, uh, a lot of these men are telling me that as\nthey...those who survived the marches--where they were brutalized, beaten, some shot, uh, a\ngreat many of them horribly starved. They picked up many of the diseases en route; and, of\ncourse, especially dysentery. Many of them probably died of dysentery. But those who\nsurvived to get to the different camps--such as Hammelburg. Uh, it's a key camp. As the\nsurvivors got into the camp, they were detailed so many men to a barracks in the prison\ncamp. And this is a Stalag, now--for POWs. Not a concentration camp. And these men then\nwere...went into the barracks and were assigned a bunk. Immediately, in came a group of\nGerman soldiers to each barrack; and commanded that the \"Jew boys\" step forward, is the\nway the termed it. The prisoners 1n there began yelling out, calling out to the men: \"Don't do\nit! Don't do it!\" Unfortunately, some of the Jews stepped forward. These are American\nsoldiers. And they were immediately taken out. Now, others did not step forward and, uh,\ndeclare themselves. The men who declared themselves as Jews were immediately taken out\nof the barracks. They were never seen again. Over and over again, the other prisoners keep\ntelling me this. Now, along came a letter from another man--uh, McCracken, his name 1s--\nand he was in the regimental, uh, medics. And he said he was among the men who liberated\nthat camp of Hammelburg. He began exploring, after the excitement was all over; and he\nwent into one particular building, and down into the basement. And here he found a room, as\nhe declares, as a execution room. One whole wall covered with lead and bullet marks. At the\nbase of the, uh, wall 1s a trench, to carry the blood, and a drainhole. We're trying to\ninvestigate much deeper into these facts, uh, as we go along now. But all these little facts are\nstarting to come out, and put a much better picture of what was happening. But it was, uh,\nvery strange to find an execution chamber in a Stalag.",
        "A: Moosburg.",
        "A: Okay. We then moved on out of the camp, leaving the prisoners behind. Uh, and then we\nwere heading toward a city called Landshut, not very far from there. And, uh, here there was\nanother camp. Uh, it was in our minds not significant. It wasn't a horror camp--at least, as\nmuch as I know about it. Uh, this camp at Landshut, uh, contained, uh, I believe, almost all\nEnglish and Canadian, uh, troops. Uh, they had already been liberated at this point, as we\nwere marching through; and a lot of the prisoners were coming out of the camps. And they,\nof course, waving to you as...as normal, and uh, even saluting us, and everything else. And it\nwas, uh, a stage of glory, should we say, and happiness at this point. And we continued on by\nthe camp itself, and we began... Now, this was on the border of Austria. And we that night,\nuh, took over some farm houses. And then, uh, Captain Pat called me, uh, to his\nheadquarters--that farm house he was in--and he told me... Now, he assigned me that I was\ngonna, uh, take a patrol into Austria. And this patrol, he says, \"I'm gonna ask you to\nvolunteer. Uh, and your men.\" Uh, he gave me the details. As best as I can remember now,\nuh, that I'm being assigned three tanks with rubber tracks. I'm to take my men on the top of\nthose tanks, to protect them. We're to hit the German lines, uh, during the middle of the\nnight. I believe that was about, probably, two o'clock in the morning. And break through; not\nfight unless we had to, but keep on going. Just fight our way through, and go behind the\nGerman lines. Keep on going down this particular road for approximately 30, 35 miles. And\ndown in there somewhere was a bridge that I was to try to take and stop the Germans from\nblowing up. That was my basic mission. Thus, we did this. And as I believe to this day, uh,\nthat, uh, a famous cartoonist--now I can't think of his name...uh, Bill Mauldin--uh, was\nstanding in the background, in the kitchen at the time. And he came up; and he asked me...he\nasked Captain Pat if he could go on that patrol. And Captain told him, he says, \"Well, that's\nnot my decision.\" He says, \"You'll have to ask Sargeant Whiteway.\" And I looked at him,\nand I said, \"Well, you understand, this is apparently a suicide patrol. That we're not going to\nget any help for some time. I cannot protect you. You are a civilian, technically; and you\ncan't carry any weapons, according to the Geneva Conference [Convention]. And I cannot\nprotect you. I don't have enough men.\" He said, \"I agree.\" He says, \"I want to go with you.\"\nSo he rode on one of the tanks. But I...I think I put him on the third tank. And uh...so we\nbroke through the lines. We had a...we had a few gun fights, and...but we kept on going. And\nuh...or reboarded the tanks after we, uh, initially, uh, cleared the way. And then we rode all\nnight, and through ...'til just about dawn. As I can remember, it was daylight when we came\nwithin sight of the bridge. And as we...then got off the tanks and we spread my men out to\nprotect my tanks, and then we started to move up. And we got pretty close to the bridge; and\nthe Germans there blew the bridge up in our faces. So now the mission was blown. Uh, the\nonly thing I could do, there was a clearing--an opening, a little small field. And I told the\ntanks, I says, \"Okay, pull in here. We'll make a big circle around you and dig in. And you\nguys dig the tanks in the middle of that.\" Which we did. Now, the Germans were coming in\nfrom all directions; and they totally surrounded us. And we could see them put a blockade\nup, uh, on the road, so we couldn't escape. And we were sweat...began to sweat. We stayed\nthere for countless hours. And everybody's asking me, \"What the heck are they doing?\" I\nsaid, \"The only thing I can think of...\" And, of course, at times I was communicating with\nthe tankers, who radioed back our condition. Uh, that the Germans were waiting to bring in\n\"Tiger\" tanks to blow our tanks up. And we had no defense against them. But we waited and\nwaited; and finally, we could hear way down the valley an American jeep. They have a very\ndistinct sound. And he was winding his way down. And so we kept looking there, and finally\nwe could see him. And we started yelling to him to go back, go back. He approached the,\nuh...the blockade. The Germans opened up the blockade and let him in. We couldn't\nunderstand what the heck was happening. And then the two guys in the jeep drove right up\nto us through the German lines; and they yelled out, \"It's all over! Forget about it. It's the\nend of the war!\"~\"\n*\u201c Th the European theatre, the war ended May 9, 1945.",
        "A: Ok. Yah. After the war, and on our...so-called \"on our way home,\" uh, for discharge. And we\ntook over; and we were assigned occupation, temporarily, uh, in the city of Cherbourg,\nFrance. And we had 200,000 German prisoners there. And at times, uh, we would go up, uh,\nbetween--when we were off-duty, and so on--uh, on patrol, we would go up and we'd watch\nthe Germans playing European football. As today, we call it soccer. And they were very\ngood at it. But, of course, they had nothing else to do. So uh, they'd be out there playing; and\nthen they come over talking to us, uh...uh, at the end of their games, and things like that.\nAnd, uh, they could...uh, some of them could speak English. Some could speak some\nEnglish, and visa versa. We was already learned a certain amount of German. So we could\ncommunicate quite easily. And I...there was a colonel, a German officer, standing there. And\nI questioned him. I said, \"You know, I'm very puzzled about one thing.\" I said, \"Everywhere\nI've gone in Europe here, during the war and after the war, that I can find no young men. In\nFrance, in Belgium, over in Denmark, there's no young men. What happened to them?\" And\nthe colonel stood erect. And he said, \"Well, we officers--or we Germans--occupying these\ncountries had a problem. That we knew that there would be one group that would most\nresent what we were going to do to the civilians. That was the young men. So as we overran\nthe towns, the villages, the neighborhoods and the cities, we immediately rounded up all the\npeople. And we separated all the young men from 16...or 15 or 16 to 25, stand over there\nagainst a stone wall. We set up firing squads, and we immediately shot everyone of them, in\nevery living country we went into. Voila! No problem.\" (Clearing throat)",
        "A: Very shocking. Uh... But then I began to understand the German mind. Of course, there were\nmany other things that came out of this. Of their attitudes of the German occupation of these\ncountries, and so on; and their intimidation and their firing squads, and why, are there.",
        "A: All right. Of course, uh, after, uh...at the very end of the war there, we did overrun--right\nsomewhere in that immediate vicinity--and only saw part of one of the Mauthausens. There\nwas 42, as I understand now. And we saw some awful horrors there. And even, uh,\ncannibalism in the camp. But these... Like Dachau. And we were so shocked. And Professor\nCrawford asked me after the war, he said... Now, he asked me the same question about my\nemotions, how I felt...thought about it. And he asked me another question, \"Did you men\nduring the war--after you left the camp, or after the war, or even at home--talk about these\nterrible camps and these horrors that you saw?\" And I suddenly realized, number one, that\nall this time I had been assuming that as we radioed--like, for instance, in Dachau--that we\nradioed back constantly all the things that we were finding to the company; to be reported,\nwe assumed, on the, uh, daily reports of the military, that here they, uh...all the reports itself\nwould be turned in. But I also assumed that due to us communicating with the men behind\nus, that all of a sudden everybody in the battalion would be coming into the camp and taking\na look at all these horrors that we saw. It didn't happen. Nobody came. And we were ordered\nout, to go help the battalion fight for the camp. I found out since that somebody in the\ndivision has deleted every single word of every camp all over Germany that we had entered.\nEvery single word had been disappeared. Nobody seemed to care. Of the human misery, or\nanything else there. And this shocked me. But at the end of the war--without even knowing\nabout this, but just assuming that everybody else around me and the company had gone in--it\nwas so distasteful to remember this that we tried to shut it off. We did not ever talk amongst\neach other about one single word about any of these things that happened in the camps. From\nthe shock, from all the human misery, uh, in France, Belgium....the misery among ourselves,\nthe misery about all the Germans that we shot and left wounded on the ground, crying and\nbegging...uh, to the German civilians who were bombed and fire-bombed. It was total misery\nall the time we were over there. So, by the end of the war, we became very, very bitter men.\nAnd it took us a long time to come out of this bitterness. Of the human misery. Not so much,\nuh, because of the war and what the Germans did, but the...all the misery that we had seen, of\neverybody. Uh, those are terrible, terrible memories. And for 40 years, approximately, I\nburied all those memories in my mind. When I came back home, I remember trying to tell\nsome of the adventures, some of the things that happened to me. And everybody--my\nfriends, my family--the minute you'd start talking about the war at all, they'd say, \"Forget it.\nIt's all over. We don't want to hear it. We don't care.\" And this... And I actually was even\nhumiliated. \"Oh. You were in the big one!\" And things like that. And becoming\nembarrassed or humiliated like that, that you'd bottle the things up even deeper. So finally\nwhen Professor Crawford approached me the first time, and I began to remember some.\nWhen I first started to testify and talk about it, even for the first few years, I could only\nremember just so much. And it was all kind of jumbled, and locations were jumbled in my\nmind. After a while, all of a sudden, things started to straighten out. But I have not had a\nnightmare since. And that's a very big point, uh, there.",
        "A: Uh, there is so very many stories of human misery and so on. But pertaining to the\ncamps...uh...",
        "A: It is...very unpleasant. I hope that people can understand, uh, what it was like. Hmm.",
