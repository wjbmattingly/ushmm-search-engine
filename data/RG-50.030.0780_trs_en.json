And one of the guy from Serbian\nsociety, he went to Ukraine about five, 10 years ago, and they paid him for his\nhouse which he had over there.

        "A: Well, of course they were talking about Bolsheviks, how bad they were, and so\non. But as far as Germany, England, I don\u2019t think they discuss it ver-very much.

        "A: It\u2019s everybody felt that it\u2019s a matter of days. As a matter of fact, he \u2014 he got the\nletter from \u2014 from the army that they inducting him back.",
        "Q: He\u2019s being mobilized.",
        "A: Mobilized, right. And he became the chief \u2014 chief of anti-aircraft defensive\ncover, except they didn\u2019t have an air \u2014 aircrafts.",

        "A: Well, I think they took it in stride. For example, we \u2014 we lived \u2014 we lived close to\ndowntown, and on one occasion we went to the \u2014 where there was a army\nheadquarters, and they have a army mess over there, and we went there for lunch,\nwith my father, mother. And as we were having lunch, all of a sudden the planes\ncame over. You could see the faces of the pilots, and one of the lieutenants says, oh,\nthose are Polish, because they got Polish insignia on the planes.",
        "Q: Did they really?",
        "A: They did. And as he said they are Polish, they started shooting. So we went \u2014 run\naway from the building, and there were some planes over there, so we hid in there.\nSo that was like probably third and fourth of September.",
        "Q: Amazing that they were so close you could see the faces.January 31, 2015",
        "A: Yeah. They \u2014 well, there was no aircrafts. And the \u2014 later my father got couple\nwith those aircraft guns, so then they were flying very high. Evidently they had\nsome space on the ground.",
        "Q: So those first few weeks, your \u2014 was that as close as you got to someone from the\nGerman military \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 was this person in the plane?",

        "A: Well, they were going to work, and I think schools were closed, because they\nmade the hospital with those schools. So \u2014 and I was going to go to the fourth grade,\nbut never happened. And \u2014",

        "Q: Okay. Did your family know any? Did you have any interaction?",
        "A: Oh yes. My mother had a good relationship with those Jewish people, because\nshe was running that orphanage, so she needed some funds. So they \u2014 they were \u2014",
        "Q: Supporting it.",
        "A: Of course, where we lived, the owner of this house was Jew, too, and \u2014 and I was\ntalking with his son. His son was six, seven years older, and I was telling him that\nwe going to beat Germans, and this guy says, no way, they\u2019re too strong. Of course,\nhe was 15, or something.",
        "Q: So, two military experts having a conversation.",
        "A: Exactly, yes.",
        "Q: So, people still continued going to work, even though there was no school. What\nwas the talk that was going on?",
        "A: Well, really, we didn\u2019t interact with \u2014 with the outside world, you know, we just\n\u2014my mother, father, and myself, except for that trip that we made to that military\nmess over there. Cassino(ph), you could call it cassino(ph), really. So, I never\nfinished that lunch.",
        "Q: No, I guess not. So you stayed at home.",
        "A: Yes.\nJanuary 31, 2015",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 okay, did you do any preparations? Did you expect the Germans to\narrive at some point?",
        "A: Well, we as a military family were given the gas masks, because at that time\neverybody was expecting the day going to \u2014 to gas, but never happened. So we \u2014 we\n\u2014 we received the masks, those high \u2014 high tech masks that \u2014 because the old ones,\nyou could choke in them. The new ones, they were really comfortable, but we never\nuse them. And later we cut them to pieces because they didn\u2019t want Russians to take\nthem over.",
        "Q: Okay. So how do things progress throughout September? What happens?",
        "A: Well, September 17\", Russians entered Poland. And they were marching. And\nwe \u2014 we lived in that house, and by that house there was a water pump. And as they\nwere marching, this soldier \u2014 I was outside \u2014 came by me. Says, can you give me a\ncup, because I want to get some water. So to was \u2014 ma \u2014 my first interaction with the\n\u2014 with the Russians. And he was very, very polite, very nice. So that was probably\non the 18\" of September.",
        "Q: Was Kovel close to the border?",
        "A: Yeah, we\u2019re very close. I don\u2019t know how many miles, but yes, Kovel was pretty\nclose to the border, Russian there. So, of course, my father [indecipherable] that,\nJanuary 31, 2015\nand when the Russians came they getting men to shovel the snow or something. So\nwe were selling some different things, to survive.",

        "Q: That was pretty early on?",
        "A: Yeah. Army \u2014 Army lieutenant, and by the way, he was very nice guy. Of course,\na lot of Russians were okay, except for the government.",
        "Q: Does there any interaction between your father and himself, because both of them\nare military men.January 31, 2015",

So they \u2014 we had\nthe big radio. So they took that radio, they say it\u2019s no way private person could have\na radio like that, it had to belong to the government. And then he \u2014 had the leather \u2014\nleather briefcase, they took that one too, and they took him away, and told my\nmother that he\u2019 ll be released in \u2014 in couple days, which of course, never happened.",
        "Q: Did they say why they were arresting him?",
        "A: No, they arrested all the officers, all the officers \u2014",
        "Q: So, was he expecting this to happen?",
        "A: Well, probably. But he had the chance to go to Romania, that \u2014 that was still\nwhen the war was on, because the \u2014 the people were going \u2014 from part of the\ngovernment, they were going through Romania. So they stopped and they say to\nhim, listen, let\u2019s go with us, we go to Romania. And my father says no, I got to takeJanuary 31, 2015\ncare of my wife, and my \u2014 my son, so he didn\u2019t go. Otherwise, he \u2014 he would\nsurvive. That was still in the \u2014 September, of course, that he had the chance to go to\nRomania.",
        "Q: Do you think he fully \u2014 do you think he expected he\u2019d be back in a few days, like\nthey said?",
        "A: Ah, probably not. My \u2014 my mother went to the NK VD, and says, where are they\ngoing to process him, and so forth. And she says, where is the radio? Oh, you\u2019ll get\nit back eventually. Didn\u2019t care about the radio, she cared about him.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And \u2014 but they made her offer. They said, we are going to release him right\naway, if you\u2019re going to give us some information about lot of people in this town.\nAnd of course my mother turned them down, for two reasons. She was really\npatriotic. Second is she knew that they were lying. So, she didn\u2019t pick up it.",
        "Q: How long did this take, when they came to your home, and they banged on the\ndoor? Was it a half hour, an hour, sa \u2014 all day?",
        "A: Oh, at least hour and a half probably. They were searching the house for \u2014 for\nguns, some reason. Suddenly that\u2019s a \u2014 most hour and a half, yeah.",

        "A: No, I didn\u2019t know him.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Oh, he really was a member of communist party before the war.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And so, half an hour, and pack. My mother started arguing with those people,\nwith those NKVDs. Probably Germans would shot her on the spot because she was\ntelling them that Stalin gived his own mother, and so on. And I started to pack, and\nthis NK VD man was helping me packing, because my mother didn\u2019t pack.",
        "Q: She was busy arguing.January 31, 2015",
        "A: She was being arguing with them. And they also admired her language, you\nknow, that they were exhaust probably. Great education, and she \u2014 she was a college\ngraduate. So half an hour passed, hour passed, five hour passed.",

        "Q: What kind of dog?",
        "A: Oh, mongrel. So then we go to the station, those cattle cars, all this stuff, and the\ndog. And of course we thought \u2014 we used to sell the stuff later in Russia, so \u2014",
        "Q: But you were able to take a lot of things with you.",
        "A: Yeah.",

I took lot of\npictures, and \u2014 and by the way, this lieutenant comes with a \u2014 th-there was a \u2014\nbefore the war there was a jam in about maybe five pound cans. So he brings this\nsugar, and he says to my mother, take this. Because they keep telling you this \u2014\neverything is in Russia, but there is nothing there.",
        "Q: So this lieutenant who was in your house \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 Soviet lieutenant \u2014",
        "A: He was living there, because they r\u2014 they di \u2014 took one room, see?January 31, 2015",
        "Q: After your father is arrested for those three weeks, here was this lieutenant, in\none of those rooms.",
        "A: He was there all the time, and he brought that sugar, so we took that sugar. And\nhe was a very nice guy, quiet and everything else, and of course he didn\u2019t discuss\npolitics, because you know, he would be afraid to discuss politics, and so there were,\nI don\u2019t know how many, 50 people in that car.",
        "Q: Was your \u2014 did your mother quiet down at some point? What happened?",
        "A: Not really. She was arguing with them all the time.",
        "Q: She was arguing, and you were packing.",

        "A: NKVD, yeah, right. He says, take a \u2014 take you can, but originally they get half an\nhour, but it lasted five hours, so we took lot \u2014 lot \u2014 lot of stuff, and \u2014",
        "Q: Did you take food?",
        "A: Not \u2014 not really food. May-Maybe a little bit with the food, because we used to\ndry bread, you know, before the war, figure just in case. So we took some of that dry\nbread, and of course that was a February \u2014 April 13, so weather wasn\u2019t bad as\nFebruary 10, when the first people were deported.",
        "Q: Did you know about those first deportation?\nJanuary 31, 2015",
        "A: Oh yes, we did know, yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: Did you know anybody who was deported on February 10\"?",
        "A: Over here?",
        "Q: In Kovel.",
        "A: No, from Kovel they didn\u2019t deport February 10\", because they were deporting\npeople who \u2014 who had parcels of land, see?",
        "Q: Oh. So February 10\" was a different category of people?",
        "A: Oh, different, yes. That was people who \u2014 who got the land as a prize for fighting\nthe Russians in a 1920 war.",
        "Q: So how come your father didn\u2019t get any?",
        "A: Well, we didn\u2019t need it. He was an officer, you know.",
        "Q: Okay. But he fought in the 1920 war.",
        "A: Yeah, but he \u2014",
        "Q: He was fine as an officer.",
        "A: Exactly.",

        "Q: It\u2019s true.January 31, 2015",
        "A: It\u2019s not \u2014 not easy. And by the way, that\u2019s how my parents treated help. Thi \u2014 this\nwoman that worked for us, when my father was in prison, she too-took parcels to\nhim. So evidently, they were good employers.",
        "Q: That means something, yes.",
        "A: Except one thing I couldn\u2019t reconcile, because she wrote to us in Russia, a letter,\nin 1940, in December. She says that she \u2014 she \u2014 she passed the parcel to \u2014 to my\nfather, and at that time, he wasn\u2019t there. So evidently those \u2014 those prison officials\ntook the parcel and told her he is there, but I\u2019m sure he wasn\u2019t there, because it was\nDecember of 1940.",
        "Q: And when was Katyn?",
        "A: It was in May.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It was in May, so th-th \u2014 the \u2014",
        "Q: But when you were taken to the train, did you think your father still was in\nprison, locally?",
        "A: I thought so, because they screened the windows in prison. They put the screens\nover there, see? So they didn\u2019t want \u2014 of course, that was April. They didn\u2019t want to\nsee those people that people were being reported. But that was in April. TheyJanuary 31, 2015\nprobably went to Katyn later that month, or beginning of May. Because the order to\nexecute those people was signed on my birthday, March the fifth.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah. And Stalin died on March the fifth. Good present for me. ...",
        "Q: Okay, so you get to the train. Tell me what \u2014 how many people were in that cart,\nalong with your things?",

        "Q: Like bunkbeds?January 31, 2015",
        "A: Not beds, but yeah. So, that was a three weeks trip.",
        "Q: Well, tell me about those bunkbeds first. About how many people would be on\none platform?",
        "A: Oh, probably eight, or so. And they were like three story deep \u2014 high, and \u2014",
        "Q: Three levels high?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So there were three of them? Okay.",
        "A: Yeah, about eight or nine. So \u2014 and there were about four of them that way, so\nit\u2019s about 60 people, like I say. I never counted them, but \u2014",
        "Q: Did you know anybody who was on that train? Did you recognize them?",
        "A: Yes. There was a [bell ringing] \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 my father\u2019s friend, so after my father was arrested, and this guy was arrested \u2014\n[coughs] Excuse me.",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay.",
        "A: So that his wife and his daughter moved with us, and the daughter was about year\nolder than \u2014 than I was, I guess, and we were pretty good companions. So they \u2014 but\nlater they moved out, but somehow they got deported same day, too.",
        "Q: Okay.January 31, 2015",
        "A: So, the officers\u2019 families were deported on the April the 13\".",
        "Q: So that was the category for that deportation.",
        "A: Yeah. Policemen, officers, and high \u2014 high government officials. That was the\n13\". Later, there was another deportation in June. That was from towns again. But\nFebruary 10\", it was strictly from \u2014 from villages.",
        "Q: I see. So, where did all your things go? All those things that you brought with\nyou? Did they go in the middle of that cattle car, or something?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: And did anybody take them? I mean, did people steal it on the \u2014 you know, steal\nan \u2014",
        "A: They couldn\u2019t steal that, the doors were locked all the time, so no, no way to steal\nthem. I don\u2019t know how they \u2014 don\u2019t remember how they treated my dog over there,\nbecause there was a dog, too.",
        "Q: Was it the only dog in the cattle car?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And did the dog survive the journey?",
        "A: It did. But didn\u2019t survive Siberia. Those big Russian Huskies killed him.",
        "Q: So tell me about the beginning of the journey.",
        "A: Well \u2014\nJanuary 31, 2015",
        "Q: Did you see anything \u2014 did you \u2014 were you near a window? Were there any\nwindows?",
        "A: No windows. They would open the door once a day and give some hot water and\nclothes, on the floo \u2014 on the February 10\" they were opening more often, to throw\nout the dead bodies. But you know, weather was pretty good in \u2014 in April, so it took\nabout three weeks, then we got to this nation there.",
        "Q: I still want to talk about the journey a little bit. Do you remember leaving\nPoland? Did people know when they were leaving Poland?",
        "A: What do you mean? What people?",
        "Q: Well, the people in the train. You were on a train, the doors are closed \u2014",
        "A: Oh \u2014 oh yeah, they we \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 they knew, because we had to change the\ncars, because Poland had a w-wider, or not narrower rails. So they had to s-switch\nthe cars.",
        "Q: I see.",

        "Q: And did people react to this, that is, when they realized they are leaving Poland,\nor not?",
        "A: Yeah, they were singing, you know, religious songs, and patriotic songs and so\non. That\u2019s about it.",

        "A: Well, she didn\u2019t have nobody to argue with, there were [indecipherable]. Yeah,\nso that \u2014",
        "Q: But you said her health wasn\u2019t that great.",
        "A: Well, she had a, I guess, heart condition. But maybe part of it was in her mind,\ntoo, because what they say, that lot of people, when they went to Siberia, all of aJanuary 31, 2015\nsudden they got well. You know, going to the doctors all the time in Poland, while\nthey were in Siberia, the sickness disappeared. So \u2014",
        "Q: And what about you? Do you remember how you were feeling?",
        "A: Well, as I said in \u2014 I, from the very beginning \u2014 for example, after my father was\narrested, I used to go with this girl, you know, go play. And I didn\u2019t think much of\nit. | mean, I was sorry they arrested him. I didn\u2019t think, you know, he\u2019d be killed, but\n\u2014 but all my life I have everything took in stride, because I figured well, it\u2019s not\ngoing to help me if I am going to despair and stuff like that. Is going to make things\nworse. So, I was on the train, doing nothing, like most of the people. They were\nsinging, and so on.",
        "Q: Was it that you were trying to keep yourself from being sad?",
        "A: Oh, as I said, you know, usually I \u2014 I take things 1n stride. It\u2019s \u2014 I lost my father\nwhen I was 11, mother when was 17, and \u2014",
        "Q: Okay. Let\u2019s go then further on the train. Do you remember what you ate? What\nkind of food there was?",
        "A: Well, some of the dry bread what we had with us, and maybe \u2014 maybe\noccasionally, I don\u2019t know, if the train stopped on the \u2014 I \u2014 I don\u2019t really remember\nmuch about how was the food situation, but I know we had those \u2014 th-that pur \u2014 thatJanuary 31, 2015\ndry bread.

But sometimes very early in the morning they would say something. For\nexample, one day they said [speaks Russian] Former marshal of Poland escapes to\nRomania. But five o\u2019clock in the morning, they said only once. That\u2019s it.

        "A: Yeah, multilingual.",
        "A: Well, I\u2014 I\u2014 when I went to \u2014 to high school, I took English, because at that time\nyou need only one modern language. When my sister went to school, she needed\ntwo classical languages, was Greek and Latin, and two modern languages, which\nwas French and a \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and German.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Because English wasn\u2019t very popular, before the war, in Poland \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 just now, so yeah.",
        "A: My mother, later she was working as interpreter, so I was talking to a woman,\nand sh-she said well, she speaks German like she just came from Berlin, and she\ndidn\u2019t use the language for 25 years.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And she spoke three languages, and later she tried to learn English, when we\nwere in India. And some people here, they come and they spend here 40 years, and\nthey don\u2019t even learn English.",
        "A: She had a rough time with it, I\u2019m sure [indecipherable] 50, so that\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: It\u2019s harder, yes.",
        "A: Well, as I read some of the opinions of his superiors, that he was pretty\neasygoing, but di-didn\u2019t have much confidence",
        "A: \u2014 even though \u2014 even though he had, you know, good education, and so on. But\nhe wasn\u2019t pushy, let\u2019s put it this way. And he \u2014 like in any \u2014 in any area, you have to\nbe pushy, to really succeed.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: Yes, of course, I was the only one at home, so \u2014 and my father, for example, as a\n\u2014 when I was then, I don\u2019t know, eight or something, and [phone ringing]",
        "A: When I was seven or eight years old.",
        "A: I was riding a bike, and another boy hit me with something, and as it happened,\nhe was son of a doctor, so my father took me to that doctor, and says, listen, whom\nyou raising? Raising a bandit? You know kids.",
        "A: Oh, he says, oh, I\u2019m going to discipline him.",
        "A: No, the \u2014",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t big wound, just a scratch.",
        "A: Not so much. They \u2014 th-they believe in God, but my mother very seldom used to\ngo to church, and \u2014 and my father, right before the war, I think, he went to \u2014 to\nconfession, and so on. And of course my mother was running the orphanage, and she\nwas running the home for the old people.",
        "A: Yeah, before the war. So she says oh, that counts more than going to mass every\nSunday.",
        "A: Oh yes. Was \u2014 when she was sick [indecipherable] president\u2019s wife sent her a\nletter.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, she was 1n that \u2014 a [indecipherable] of the women for whatever, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes. Of course, non-profit.",
        "A: For her it was. And as a matter of fact, the president of the \u2014 of the Kovel, she\nwas involved there as well, but later they found that she took some money, so there\nwas a trial be-behind the closed door.",
        "A: In those days when somebody got the big position, they used to get every break\npossible. Yeah, so \u2014 and the \u2014 on the other hand, my mother used to take some stuff\nfrom home, and take it to the orphanage and my father says, well, what are you\ndoing? Says, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s enough for both of us.\nJanuary 31, 2015",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "A: Well, she got to return whatever she took, and that\u2019s it.",
        "A: Yes. My father was for government. He subscribed to newspaper like \u201cPolskas\nBronna(ph)\u201d \u2014 Armed Poland in \u2014 in English. And of course everything was rosy in\nthat paper. My mother was it \u2014 reading so-called \u201cDzien Dobry\u201d. They had different\nopinions.",
        "A: My mother.",
        "A: Yeah. Good morning.",
        "A: That was like, well, wasn\u2019t very literal paper, but as it turned out, they were right,\nand the \u2014 then the \u201cArmed Poland,\u201d because \u201cArmed Poland\u201d followed the\ngovernment line, and of course, everything they said, we\u2019re not going to give youJanuary 31, 2015\nthe button from our coat, and you know, we lost war in 30 days, except France lost\nin 10 days.",
        "A: Yeah, my father was blindly following the government line, and my mother was\nrather realistic about the things.",
        "A: Moscicki.",
        "A: He \u2014 he had a lot of patents about fertilizers.",
        "A: Well, of course they were talking about Bolsheviks, how bad they were, and so\non. But as far as Germany, England, I don\u2019t think they discuss it ver-very much. Of\ncourse, my father thought that after 20 years, the Bolsheviks became more human.\nAs it turned out, they weren\u2019t.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It\u2019s everybody felt that it\u2019s a matter of days. As a matter of fact, he \u2014 he got the\nletter from \u2014 from the army that they inducting him back.",
        "A: Mobilized, right. And he became the chief \u2014 chief of anti-aircraft defensive\ncover, except they didn\u2019t have an air \u2014 aircrafts.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh yes, I do.",
        "A: Well, listening to radio. Radio that day used to say, this plane 1s crossing our\nborder, this plane is doing this, and the Warsaw is bombed, and other towns are\nbombed, and so on. So it\u2019s a\u2014",
        "A: Well, I think they took it in stride. For example, we \u2014 we lived \u2014 we lived close to\ndowntown, and on one occasion we went to the \u2014 where there was a army\nheadquarters, and they have a army mess over there, and we went there for lunch,\nwith my father, mother. And as we were having lunch, all of a sudden the planes\ncame over. You could see the faces of the pilots, and one of the lieutenants says, oh,\nthose are Polish, because they got Polish insignia on the planes.",
        "A: They did. And as he said they are Polish, they started shooting. So we went \u2014 run\naway from the building, and there were some planes over there, so we hid in there.\nSo that was like probably third and fourth of September.",
        "A: Yeah. They \u2014 well, there was no aircrafts. And the \u2014 later my father got couple\nwith those aircraft guns, so then they were flying very high. Evidently they had\nsome space on the ground.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Not German, Russians.",
        "A: Well, they were going to work, and I think schools were closed, because they\nmade the hospital with those schools. So \u2014 and I was going to go to the fourth grade,\nbut never happened. And \u2014",
        "A: Quite a few, yeah.",
        "A: Running businesses, running businesses, what else?January 31, 2015",
        "A: Oh yes. My mother had a good relationship with those Jewish people, because\nshe was running that orphanage, so she needed some funds. So they \u2014 they were \u2014",
        "A: Of course, where we lived, the owner of this house was Jew, too, and \u2014 and I was\ntalking with his son. His son was six, seven years older, and I was telling him that\nwe going to beat Germans, and this guy says, no way, they\u2019re too strong. Of course,\nhe was 15, or something.",
        "A: Exactly, yes.",
        "A: Well, really, we didn\u2019t interact with \u2014 with the outside world, you know, we just\n\u2014my mother, father, and myself, except for that trip that we made to that military\nmess over there. Cassino(ph), you could call it cassino(ph), really. So, I never\nfinished that lunch.",
        "A: Yes.\nJanuary 31, 2015",
        "A: Well, we as a military family were given the gas masks, because at that time\neverybody was expecting the day going to \u2014 to gas, but never happened. So we \u2014 we\n\u2014 we received the masks, those high \u2014 high tech masks that \u2014 because the old ones,\nyou could choke in them. The new ones, they were really comfortable, but we never\nuse them. And later we cut them to pieces because they didn\u2019t want Russians to take\nthem over.",
        "A: Well, September 17\", Russians entered Poland. And they were marching. And\nwe \u2014 we lived in that house, and by that house there was a water pump. And as they\nwere marching, this soldier \u2014 I was outside \u2014 came by me. Says, can you give me a\ncup, because I want to get some water. So to was \u2014 ma \u2014 my first interaction with the\n\u2014 with the Russians. And he was very, very polite, very nice. So that was probably\non the 18\" of September.",
        "A: Yeah, we\u2019re very close. I don\u2019t know how many miles, but yes, Kovel was pretty\nclose to the border, Russian there. So, of course, my father [indecipherable] that,\nJanuary 31, 2015\nand when the Russians came they getting men to shovel the snow or something. So\nwe were selling some different things, to survive.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, they were \u2014 they \u2014 they were di \u2014 there were whole columns of tanks, and\neverything else, going through Kovel, going east.",
        "A: We-West, right, yeah.",
        "A: Going west.",
        "A: Don\u2019t know how many, but at one time we had a lieutenant living in \u2014 in our\nhome. They took \u2014 took one room from us, and he was living there.",
        "A: Yeah. Army \u2014 Army lieutenant, and by the way, he was very nice guy. Of course,\na lot of Russians were okay, except for the government.",
        "A: No. My father was already arrested when this lieutenant moved in.",
        "A: Well, it was the second day of Easter, in 1940.",
        "A: It was probably March.",
        "A: Knock on the door, it\u2019s three \u2014 three en - NK VD guys enter, and there was one\ncivilian, who sort of sided with Russians. He was a Polish citizen. So they \u2014 we had\nthe big radio. So they took that radio, they say it\u2019s no way private person could have\na radio like that, it had to belong to the government. And then he \u2014 had the leather \u2014\nleather briefcase, they took that one too, and they took him away, and told my\nmother that he\u2019 ll be released in \u2014 in couple days, which of course, never happened.",
        "A: No, they arrested all the officers, all the officers \u2014",
        "A: Well, probably. But he had the chance to go to Romania, that \u2014 that was still\nwhen the war was on, because the \u2014 the people were going \u2014 from part of the\ngovernment, they were going through Romania. So they stopped and they say to\nhim, listen, let\u2019s go with us, we go to Romania. And my father says no, I got to takeJanuary 31, 2015\ncare of my wife, and my \u2014 my son, so he didn\u2019t go. Otherwise, he \u2014 he would\nsurvive. That was still in the \u2014 September, of course, that he had the chance to go to\nRomania.",
        "A: Ah, probably not. My \u2014 my mother went to the NK VD, and says, where are they\ngoing to process him, and so forth. And she says, where is the radio? Oh, you\u2019ll get\nit back eventually. Didn\u2019t care about the radio, she cared about him.",
        "A: And \u2014 but they made her offer. They said, we are going to release him right\naway, if you\u2019re going to give us some information about lot of people in this town.\nAnd of course my mother turned them down, for two reasons. She was really\npatriotic. Second is she knew that they were lying. So, she didn\u2019t pick up it.",
        "A: Oh, at least hour and a half probably. They were searching the house for \u2014 for\nguns, some reason. Suddenly that\u2019s a \u2014 most hour and a half, yeah.",
        "A: Oh, he said goodbye to me. And he said, take care of your mother.January 31, 2015",
        "A: Never happened to me before. First time. Okay.",
        "A: So, what was, 24\" of March? That\u2019s six \u2014 three weeks later, another knock on the\ndoor. Again, three NK VD, and a private person.",
        "A: No, different. You got 30 minutes to pack.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t know him.",
        "A: Oh, he really was a member of communist party before the war.",
        "A: And so, half an hour, and pack. My mother started arguing with those people,\nwith those NKVDs. Probably Germans would shot her on the spot because she was\ntelling them that Stalin gived his own mother, and so on. And I started to pack, and\nthis NK VD man was helping me packing, because my mother didn\u2019t pack.",
        "A: She was being arguing with them. And they also admired her language, you\nknow, that they were exhaust probably. Great education, and she \u2014 she was a college\ngraduate. So half an hour passed, hour passed, five hour passed.",
        "A: Still packing.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Everything.",
        "A: Like I have pictures here on that wall over there, my pictures from before the\nwar. So finally the truck came, lorry, or whatever. What was happening, they were\ndeporting so many people on that day, that they ran out of those trucks. So when the\ntruck came, we loaded the truck all the way to the brim.",
        "A: Ie\u2014I even took a dog with me.",
        "A: Yes, I did.\nJanuary 31, 2015",
        "A: Katsis(ph), or whatever.",
        "A: Oh, mongrel. So then we go to the station, those cattle cars, all this stuff, and the\ndog. And of course we thought \u2014 we used to sell the stuff later in Russia, so \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Linen. The towels. I took some stamps that \u2014 my father\u2019s collection. I took lot of\npictures, and \u2014 and by the way, this lieutenant comes with a \u2014 th-there was a \u2014\nbefore the war there was a jam in about maybe five pound cans. So he brings this\nsugar, and he says to my mother, take this. Because they keep telling you this \u2014\neverything is in Russia, but there is nothing there.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: He was living there, because they r\u2014 they di \u2014 took one room, see?January 31, 2015",
        "A: He was there all the time, and he brought that sugar, so we took that sugar. And\nhe was a very nice guy, quiet and everything else, and of course he didn\u2019t discuss\npolitics, because you know, he would be afraid to discuss politics, and so there were,\nI don\u2019t know how many, 50 people in that car.",
        "A: Not really. She was arguing with them all the time.",
        "A: Yeah, the \u2014 wi-with the \u2014 with the \u2014",
        "A: NKVD, yeah, right. He says, take a \u2014 take you can, but originally they get half an\nhour, but it lasted five hours, so we took lot \u2014 lot \u2014 lot of stuff, and \u2014",
        "A: Not \u2014 not really food. May-Maybe a little bit with the food, because we used to\ndry bread, you know, before the war, figure just in case. So we took some of that dry\nbread, and of course that was a February \u2014 April 13, so weather wasn\u2019t bad as\nFebruary 10, when the first people were deported.\nJanuary 31, 2015",
        "A: Oh yes, we did know, yes, yes, yes.",
        "A: Over here?",
        "A: No, from Kovel they didn\u2019t deport February 10\", because they were deporting\npeople who \u2014 who had parcels of land, see?",
        "A: Oh, different, yes. That was people who \u2014 who got the land as a prize for fighting\nthe Russians in a 1920 war.",
        "A: Well, we didn\u2019t need it. He was an officer, you know.",
        "A: Yeah, but he \u2014",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "A: Work on land is \u2014 is a\u20141s a hard work.",
        "A: It\u2019s not \u2014 not easy. And by the way, that\u2019s how my parents treated help. Thi \u2014 this\nwoman that worked for us, when my father was in prison, she too-took parcels to\nhim. So evidently, they were good employers.",
        "A: Except one thing I couldn\u2019t reconcile, because she wrote to us in Russia, a letter,\nin 1940, in December. She says that she \u2014 she \u2014 she passed the parcel to \u2014 to my\nfather, and at that time, he wasn\u2019t there. So evidently those \u2014 those prison officials\ntook the parcel and told her he is there, but I\u2019m sure he wasn\u2019t there, because it was\nDecember of 1940.",
        "A: It was in May.",
        "A: It was in May, so th-th \u2014 the \u2014",
        "A: I thought so, because they screened the windows in prison. They put the screens\nover there, see? So they didn\u2019t want \u2014 of course, that was April. They didn\u2019t want to\nsee those people that people were being reported. But that was in April. TheyJanuary 31, 2015\nprobably went to Katyn later that month, or beginning of May. Because the order to\nexecute those people was signed on my birthday, March the fifth.",
        "A: Yeah. And Stalin died on March the fifth. Good present for me. ...",
        "A: About 60.",
        "A: No, no, the car.",
        "A: In the car train, yeah.",
        "A: There was no toilet, there was a hole in the floor of the \u2014 of the wagon, of the car.\nAnd \u2014",
        "A: Oh, the \u2014 oh, on the [indecipherable] It\u2019s like a wooden floors.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, that\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: Not beds, but yeah. So, that was a three weeks trip.",
        "A: Oh, probably eight, or so. And they were like three story deep \u2014 high, and \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, about eight or nine. So \u2014 and there were about four of them that way, so\nit\u2019s about 60 people, like I say. I never counted them, but \u2014",
        "A: Yes. There was a [bell ringing] \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 my father\u2019s friend, so after my father was arrested, and this guy was arrested \u2014\n[coughs] Excuse me.",
        "A: So that his wife and his daughter moved with us, and the daughter was about year\nolder than \u2014 than I was, I guess, and we were pretty good companions. So they \u2014 but\nlater they moved out, but somehow they got deported same day, too.",
        "A: So, the officers\u2019 families were deported on the April the 13\".",
        "A: Yeah. Policemen, officers, and high \u2014 high government officials. That was the\n13\". Later, there was another deportation in June. That was from towns again. But\nFebruary 10\", it was strictly from \u2014 from villages.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: They couldn\u2019t steal that, the doors were locked all the time, so no, no way to steal\nthem. I don\u2019t know how they \u2014 don\u2019t remember how they treated my dog over there,\nbecause there was a dog, too.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It did. But didn\u2019t survive Siberia. Those big Russian Huskies killed him.",
        "A: Well \u2014\nJanuary 31, 2015",
        "A: No windows. They would open the door once a day and give some hot water and\nclothes, on the floo \u2014 on the February 10\" they were opening more often, to throw\nout the dead bodies. But you know, weather was pretty good in \u2014 in April, so it took\nabout three weeks, then we got to this nation there.",
        "A: What do you mean? What people?",
        "A: Oh \u2014 oh yeah, they we \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 they knew, because we had to change the\ncars, because Poland had a w-wider, or not narrower rails. So they had to s-switch\nthe cars.",
        "A: So-",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: There was Szepet\u00e9wka, there was \u2014 that\u2019s as far as we went on the Polish, and\nthen they switched to the Russian cars.",
        "A: Yeah. That \u2014 that was where the rail would stop.",
        "A: Closed. All the time they were closed. That the \u2014 they open them when we are\nmoving from one car to the other.",
        "A: Yeah, they were singing, you know, religious songs, and patriotic songs and so\non. That\u2019s about it.",
        "A: Well, she didn\u2019t have nobody to argue with, there were [indecipherable]. Yeah,\nso that \u2014",
        "A: Well, she had a, I guess, heart condition. But maybe part of it was in her mind,\ntoo, because what they say, that lot of people, when they went to Siberia, all of aJanuary 31, 2015\nsudden they got well. You know, going to the doctors all the time in Poland, while\nthey were in Siberia, the sickness disappeared. So \u2014",
        "A: Well, as I said in \u2014 I, from the very beginning \u2014 for example, after my father was\narrested, I used to go with this girl, you know, go play. And I didn\u2019t think much of\nit. | mean, I was sorry they arrested him. I didn\u2019t think, you know, he\u2019d be killed, but\n\u2014 but all my life I have everything took in stride, because I figured well, it\u2019s not\ngoing to help me if I am going to despair and stuff like that. Is going to make things\nworse. So, I was on the train, doing nothing, like most of the people. They were\nsinging, and so on.",
        "A: Oh, as I said, you know, usually I \u2014 I take things 1n stride. It\u2019s \u2014 I lost my father\nwhen I was 11, mother when was 17, and \u2014",
        "A: Well, some of the dry bread what we had with us, and maybe \u2014 maybe\noccasionally, I don\u2019t know, if the train stopped on the \u2014 I \u2014 I don\u2019t really remember\nmuch about how was the food situation, but I know we had those \u2014 th-that pur \u2014 thatJanuary 31, 2015\ndry bread. So [indecipherable]. But I don\u2019t know what the dog was eating. It was\nthree weeks.",

What kind of a radio it was? It was a loudspeaker. There was a main station,\nthat\u2019s of course, and they were choosing the station, and you just listen whatever\nthey chose. But sometimes very early in the morning they would say something. For\nexample, one day they said [speaks Russian] Former marshal of Poland escapes to\nRomania. But five o\u2019clock in the morning, they said only once. That\u2019s it. AndJanuary 31, 2015\nthat\u2019s, of course, there was a chief of [indecipherable] they have a guy from the\nsatis \u2014 sat \u2014 whatev \u2014 he wasn\u2019t a member of KGB, but close to it.

He said, listen, there is a grievance against you people, that you\ninvolved in politics. So I have to deport you. If I don\u2019t do it, I will wind up in jail.\nSo, deportation was the place where there was only one house. They call it\ndoczka(ph), which more or less, period.",

        "A: For probably, I don\u2019t know, 75 meters. And there was a bucket, which weigh\nabout, I don\u2019t know, 300 kilos, so you let this thing go, it will break the ice, to get\nsome water. Because that place, only during the summer, that they were f \u2014 grazing\nthe sheeps over there, all d\u2014 all d \u2014 during summer. But we were deported like in \u2014\nin October, but fortunately November, Polish government sign treaty with Russia,\nand they let us out.

And again they told her [speaks Russian] cannot\nbe a nurse, because they\u2019re going in to cure patients. So, with her fluent Russian,\nthey made her supervisor for that whole group of people who are working there \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 in the summer. But it\u2019s only the summer. In the winter \u2014 nobody was working\nthere in the winter.",
        "A: Wheat, wheat.",
        "A: And when we came, the first job was to \u2014 there were stalks of wheat over there\nthat we had to burn them, because it rotted. And you know, they had this big famine\nin Ukraine.",
        "A: And th-there were thousands and thousands of pounds \u2014 kilos, of that stuff sitting\nthere. But \u2014 so we were burning this stuff, and in the wintertime it\u2019s\n[indecipherable] just sitting around, and burning in a s-s \u2014 in a furnace \u2014 there was\nno coal, but I don\u2019t know how to explain it, it\u2019s a cow\u2019s \u2014",

        "A: No, no, we moved to the private \u2014 private house over there. I don\u2019t know how it\nhappened. Evidently, my mother went to the city hall and got this \u2014 this room over\nthere.",
        "A: Oh yeah, what a woman.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s right, yeah. So evidently she \u2014 she went over there and they gave her\nthis room in this \u2014 but next door was some guy from Asia, I think, Uzbek or\nsomething. It could be Kazakhstan, this part of Russia, I don\u2019t know. But \u2014",
        "A: Well, it was more or less wooden, yeah. But there was electricity.",
        "A: And thankfully so, because my mother went someplace, and that storm came, that\nsnowstorm, which really, she had to crawl on the ground, but she saw the light in\nour window over there, and she crawled all the way to that house. But, for example,\nwa \u2014 one woman who lived in different building, she \u2014 she went to buy milk for her\ndaughter, that storm caught her, they found her in the spring, clinging to that tel \u2014 to\n\u2014 to the telephone pole.",

But yes, she \u2014 she \u2014\nand the \u2014 late \u2014 later on, when we moved to Uzbekistan, this \u2014 another young man\nJanuary 31, 2015\ndied, but not too many died over there. And for example, in the sovkhoz, I never\nsaw u\u2014 Russian soldier.",
        "A: Chief of the sovkhoz maybe, but when I was two years in \u2014 1n Siberia, I never\nseen Russian soldier, never. And I read those stories in that book what I gave you,\nsome people say they were guarding them, and stuff like that. Didn\u2019t happen to us.\nProbably that bochinkow(ph), he was politic \u2014",

        "A: You know, I hate to say, but we had all this stuff that we took \u2014 took from\nPoland, because sometimes you couldn\u2019t buy anything with money, was all with\ntrade, barter. But, as I lits \u2014 other peoples\u2019 stories, hunger and so on, I cannot say\nthat about us.",
        "A: Yeah, most of the time. I think I was very hungry maybe two days out of those\ntwo years. But what I explained that my mother did so, so good, you know, over the\n\u2014her lifetime, so maybe somebody was watching over us.",
        "A: Hardest part of being there ... was pretty boring. Boredom.",
        "A: Yeah, there was a school, but my mother didn\u2019t want to send me to Russian\nschool. She was afraid they may convert me, which would never happen. So she told\nthem that I don\u2019t have shoes, and the board of education says they don\u2019t have in the\nbudget money f\u2014 to buy stuff for the shoes. So I wasn\u2019t going to school, which was\na big mistake, because I could learn s-something. Th-Th \u2014 they had a good level\nmath in Russian schools, and of course I learned Russians at home, because lot of\nthose Russians officers came to Poland after Bolshevik revolution. As a matter of\nfact, we lived block and a half for Gagarina, who was a princess. They said that\nGagarin was her nephew, or \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. She had the big estate in Kovel. I used to go there and ride her\ndog. She got the dog, I don\u2019t know.January 31, 2015",

And you\nknow, eight year old, nine year old kid, picks it up like that. So my parents realized\nthat I understood everything, so if they wanted to say something that I don\u2019t \u2014\nwouldn\u2019t understand, they switched to German, because Russian I understood\neverything. Even now I understand everything in Russian, my \u2014 1-if I took a brush-\nup course, probably that would came back to me, the Russian language.",

And he wrote\nZabatskaya(ph), that wife of the president of Kovel. So, comes Christmas or\nsomething, she comes by our house with candies. And opened the door, and my\nmother says, what do you want? I brought some candies for your son. And myJanuary 31, 2015\nmother says, do you want to take candies from this woman? I said no. And she says\nto my mother, I\u2019m going to report you.

And\nby the way, I don\u2019t have too many memorabilia, because on that trip from \u2014 from\nIrtusk to \u2014 to Jambol(ph), somebody stole one of our bookcases \u2014 suitcases. AndJanuary 31, 2015\nthose were the people who were going to join Polish army. So then we went to this\nUzbeks.",

They invited us, of course\nthe \u2014 everybody is sitting on the floor. There is one big dish, everybody dipping in\nthat dish. And so \u2014 and that time \u2014 that time we had to work, and this f \u2014 friend of\nmine that lived with us, with this \u2014 my father\u2019s friend wife and him. So he goes to\nwork, and I, in the morning I take that shovel, put it on my arm, and go in front of\nthe \u2014 this supervisor house, go around, go home.",
        "A: Comes Friday, he gets half a pound of flour \u2014 half a kilo. I get whole kilo.",

        "A: If my mother wasn\u2019t there, I wouldn\u2019t survive. Because she used \u2014 took care of\nme, give me some juices and stuff like that. And then there was a Polish\nrepresentation there, so she wrote him a letter that she needs something for the\npatients, so they gave something. And so, we lived there I don\u2019t know how many\nmonths, but in August of \u00b042, we moved further with General Anders\u2019 Army. I was\ntoo young to join the army, but as a family, of course, my mother was figure out\nhow to do it, and we went to Persia from \u2014 and \u2014January 31, 2015",

So whole time was eating because you could buy peaches and stuff\nlike that, and we had money to burn. And \u2014 but of course, they said, you cannot take\nmoney, you cannot take cameras, and no \u2014",
