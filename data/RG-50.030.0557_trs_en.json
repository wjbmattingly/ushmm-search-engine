And\nwhen I was born, my mother, you know, I-lived with her family close by. And when\nI was about three and a half years old, you know, the war started, you know, and the\nGerman occupation of Poland began. And at \u2014 as most of us \u2014 most people know,\nthere was an agreement in the Ribbentrop-Molotov Act, which kind of divided up\nPoland, you know, be-before the war even started.

        "Q: \u2014 a little kid in school in Russia?",
        "A: No, the only thing that I \u2014 really stands out, you know, 1-is \u2014 is I \u2014 the distinct\ntime then when I first \u2014 the kids found out I was yid \u2014 Jewish, you know? And they\nstarted teasing me and \u2014 and beating me up, and \u2014",
        "Q: In a mean \u2014 in a mean way\u201d",
        "A: Oh yeah, you know, they \u2014 as far as we knew, we were the only Jews in there\nbecause my father had, you know, was able to get us on the \u2014 on this train. But there\nmay have been other ones, you know, the camp was so big, you know, there was\nthousands and thousands of people [indecipherable] over there.",
        "Q: So you \u2014 so, early on, as \u2014 as a little kid who\u2019s a refugee, you \u2014 you get it twice?",
        "A: Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: And, was your mother able to help or protect you, or \u2014 or pretty much you were\non your own?",

And she\u2019d\ncome back, you know, and we had this tiny little room, you know. An-And the Ural\nmountains are so cold, you know, my memory of my mother for all those years is \u2014\nis frozen, you know, you see \u2014 you see the icicles coming down her eyebrows and \u2014\nand, you know, her \u2014 her fingers and hands frozen. She\u2019d come in \u2014 she\u2019d come\nfrom work an-and she\u2019d sit down and she\u2019d be shivering for, you know, a period of\ntime where we\u2019d cover her up with the \u2014 with the \u2014 the straw mattress that we had,\nand whatever we had we\u2019d cover her up. She\u2019d sit there shivering and then finally\nafter awhile she would \u2014",
        "Q: Warm up just a little.",
        "A: \u2014 warm up, you know, an-and she\u2019d go an \u2014 you know, the barracks was set up,\nthere was a kitchen all the way on the other end of the barracks, you know, and it\nwas a common kitchen and when she finished warming up she would go to the\nkitchen and try to prepare whatever we could to eat, you know, so \u2014 so, yeah. But\nmy memory of \u2014 of my mother from all that period is that picture of her, you know,\nfrozen, sitting there. She lost \u2014 she \u2014 one \u2014 her finger was frostbitten, she had \u2014 had\nto be amputated. So, yeah.",
        "Q: What did she do? When she was working there, what did she do?",
        "A: I\u2014 from what I understand, she was making some kind of ammunition, you\nknow. I \u2014 I guess, you know, th-they weren't supposed to pass on any information,\nbut she was making some kind of mi \u2014 ammunition. She was \u2014 it was a fact \u2014 it was\na factory, you know.",
        "Q: Did she have any energy left over to give to you as a little kid?",
        "A: Not at all, no, she \u2014 you know, I mean, the day was basically \u2014 her day was\nbasically she\u2019d get up in the morning, go to work, you know, come back from work,\nyou know, after many, many hours, tired as, you know, make something to eat, you\nknow, and then fine \u2014 and fall asleep, and \u2014",
        "Q: The same thing repeated in \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 same \u2014 exactly, you know. That wa \u2014 that was \u2014",
        "Q: And when you \u2014 what was your day like? When did you get up? Did you get up\nbefore her, after her?",
        "A: Yeah, we were all up at the same time, you know, because everybody \u2014 the\nbarracks emptied out, you know, everybody had to go out either to school or to\nwork, you know, and the \u2014 the barracks were \u2014",
        "Q: And did you walk to school by yourself?",
        "A: No, th \u2014 well, there were other kids that wi \u2014 you know, but yeah, and we\u2019d walk\nto school, you know, and \u2014",
        "Q: So, in other words, when she went \u2014 she went to work and you were on your\nown until she came home?",
        "A: Exactly, yeah, yeah. That\u2019s all.",
        "Q: Were you hungry?",
        "A: Oh, I was \u2014 that was the big thing, you know, that was, you know, as I say, my \u2014\nmy two major memories of \u2014 of that period are \u2014 are first one, it was the cold, and\nthe second one was the hunger, you know, I mean tha \u2014 I was always hungry. My\nmother \u2014 it \u2014 now, you may not be familiar with the way they operated in \u2014 in the \u2014\nin the work camps, but basically the people would \u2014 who worked in the camps\nwould get paid basically in potatoes, and flour, you know, that was \u2014 that was the\nstaple. And \u2014 and once a month they would, you know, deliver this sack of potatoes\nand you know, sack th \u2014 a small sack of flour, and that was what you had to live on,\nyou know, with \u2014 with the exception of if you exceeded a quota \u2014 you know,\neverybody had \u2014 had a quota to perform. If you exceeded the quota you got s \u2014 an\nadditional staple, you know. And my mother, every couple of weeks she \u2014 she\u2019d\nbring, you know, back a \u2014 a black bread that she got for \u2014",
        "Q: I was gonna ask you, yeah, did you get bread, did you get any cheese ever, or \u2014",
        "A: Occasionally we\u2019d get cheese, you know. Every once in awhile the Russians\ntransport would be \u2014 transports would come in and the Russians would distribute it\nthroughout that camp, and then they would distribute it. You know, they \u2014 they tried\nvery hard to \u2014 to provide the pe \u2014 food for the people, but the war was raging, and I\nguess the \u2014 the front got the first aspect of it, you know. But yeah, whenever \u2014 you\nknow, I \u2014 I remember very distinctly every once in awhile these trucks showing up,\nyou know, and everybody got a piece of cheese, or everybody got a piece of salami,\nyou know. and yeah, yeah. And that \u2014 that \u2014 that occurred. But for the most part, my\n\u2014 you know, as I say, my mother, she was very industrious, you know. She would\nfind roots, and \u2014 and \u2014 and leaves you know, and she\u2019d make root pancakes, or leaf\npancakes. Every once 1n awhile she\u2019d chop up a root, you know, an-and leaves, you\nknow, so \u2014 yeah. We \u2014 we \u2014",
        "Q: I mean, the poor woman had to keep herself and you alive.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: It\u2019s \u2014 it-it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s really quite amazing.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s right. Now this, you know, as I say, I \u2014 I\u2014 I \u2014 when \u2014 when I \u2014\nsomebody asks me about this, you know, a-and I\u2019Il say, I\u2019ll tell you my story, but\nit\u2019s really not my story, it\u2019s my mother\u2019s story, you know. She\u2019s the one that \u2014\nwithout her, I would have had no chance whatsoever. She\u2019s the one that \u2014 you know",
        "Q: How long did this go on?",
        "A: For almost four and a half years, throughout the war.",
        "Q: So from \u2014 from \u2014 so it\u2019s not more than \u2014 1-if you got there in 19 \u2014 what \u2014 what\u2019d\nyou say, \u00b042?",

Did you feel\nfear, did you feel any safety, did you feel \u2014 yeah, 1 \u2014 was it when she came back in\nthe evening that somehow or other, okay, things are best again, she\u2019s back, or \u2014 can\nyou recall anything like that?",
        "A: I don\u2019t \u2014 no, I can\u2019t recall that. I \u2014 I just \u2014 just don\u2019t remember any, you know,\ngreat times, you know. The only \u2014 the only good time that I remember from the \u2014\nfrom the camp, you know, was \u2014 was when the camp commander would turn on the\nra \u2014 the loudspeakers, and the radio would come on. And that was, I \u2014 I remember\nthe best \u2014 the best of a \u2014 of everything that happened in \u2014 throughout the camp, you\nknow, as radio \u2014",
        "Q: What would come on there?",
        "A: The what?",
        "Q: What would come on the radio there, what was there, music, or \u2014",
        "A: There\u2019d be the \u2014 the \u2014 well, yeah, for the most part there would be \u2014 first there\u2019d\nbe the news, you know, of, you know, the \u2014 the Russian front is moving, you know,\nand the Russians are winning and all that kind of stuff. And then \u2014 then there would\nbe patriotic songs and melodies, you know, and that wou \u2014 that always made me\nfeel good, you know, the \u2014 the \u2014 the songs and the melodies, you know, and \u2014",

But that didn\u2019t last too long. You know, I mean, it \u2014\nit dissipated and I \u2014 I had a couple of friends, you know, they were \u2014",
        "Q: Was this the first time that you realized there was something different about\nyou?",
        "A: Yeah, I didn't know what was going on except for the fact, you know, when they\nstarted teasing, you know, I \u2014 you know, as I said, my memories of Judaism \u2014\nalthough my f\u2014 my grandfather was a Orthodox Jew. And the picture in here, you\ncan \u2014 you can see, 1s \u2014 well, some place I\u2019ve seen that he is wearing a yarmulke,\nyou know, so he was an Orthodox Jew and \u2014 and my mother told me that \u2014 that they\nwere Orthodox, that her parents were Orthodox. My father was not, you know, from\nwhat \u2014 what she told me, he \u2014 he was not religious.

        "A: Oh yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: A lot.",
        "A: This went on \u2014 when it \u2014 when the first \u2014 I don\u2019t know how they found out that\nwe were Jewish, but somebody \u2014 you know, somebody \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 must have told the kids, and \u2014 and they started picking on me.

And, you\nknow, after awhile it just was \u2014 stopped, you know. So \u2014",
        "Q: But during this time, in the \u2014 in the work camp, there was no sense, or no talk\nthat you could recall amongst the grownups that there was something particular that\nwas happening to the Jews? Or do you recall that?",
        "A: No, we th \u2014 for one thing, we really didn\u2019t know what was happening. We were,\nyou know, all the way in the Ural mountains, you know, where \u2014 a-and the only\ninformation we had was that \u2014 the radio that would come on, and of course, that\nwouldn\u2019t be on there.",

And in the\nmorning, you know, he would take the ba \u2014 waste bucket up one day and I would\ntake it out the next day, take it to the pits, you know, and get rid or it, and so yeah,\nwe \u2014 we were friends, you know, yeah.",
        "Q: Did \u2014 did anybody ever steal your food?",

        "Q: So how was it that you could return to Poland? Once you were in the Ural\nmountains, what happened after the war \u2014",
        "A: Well, when the war finished, everybody started \u2014 you know, they didn\u2019t need\nany more workers in the \u2014 in the \u2014 you know, th-they \u2014 so everybody started going\nhome, and took us months and months of walking and catching rides, and \u2014 and \u2014\nand \u2014",
        "Q: So, you had no train transportation, you \u2014 was all on your own energy?",
        "A: Yeah, pretty much so, because you know, you got \u2014 I don\u2019t know, the camp was\nso gigantic, I would say at least 50 - 100,000 people there, you know. And\neverybody was going their own way. And, you know, of course you couldn\u2019t do it\nin the winter, you know, but su \u2014 as soon as the spring came, you know, the \u2014 a\ncouple of months of sist \u2014 of summer that occurred in the Ural mountains,\neverybody started going home. You know, and of course, you know, there\u2019s \u2014 just\nwerent enough trains, or I don\u2019t know, there weren\u2019t any trains that were taking\npeople home, you know, but yeah, people started walking home.",
        "Q: So, do you remember that, do you remember when you left the camp?",
        "A: I remem \u2014 I remember wal \u2014 well, not exactly when I left the camp. I remember\nwalking and I remember, you know, places we used to \u2014 some places we stopped, I\nremember, and you know, and I remember, y-you know, like the \u2014 when we \u2014 when\nwe got to the \u2014 to \u2014 to certain places, you know, we\u2019d stop a-a-an-and go to bombed\nout houses, or \u2014 or destroyed places, and go into those and sleep in there, and try to,\nyou know, and walk the next day.",
        "Q: Did you \u2014",
        "A: And there were \u2014",
        "Q: How\u2019d you feed yourselves?",
        "A: The what?",
        "Q: How\u2019d you feed yourselves on such a long journey home?",
        "A: Yeah, and there \u2014 you know, as I say, there was always \u2014 there was always some\nkind of a barter system that was going on. You know, people kept bartering, you\nknow, and I don\u2019t know if there \u2014 1t was \u2014 1t was the nearby farms, or what, you\nknow? The \u2014 the nearby areas that there \u2014 but there was always \u2014 so I remember,\nyou know, every once 1n awhile we\u2019d \u2014 we\u2019d catch a ride, you know, or if \u2014 you\nknow, and \u2014 and I remember one time we were on a train, on a cattle car, and we\u2019d\nstopped at this station, and there was a \u2014 another train, th-the next \u2014 the next\nrailroad track, and were all Russian soldiers, they were returning from \u2014 from the \u2014\nyou know, from the war, basically. A lot of them were, you know, bandaged up and\netcetera, but they \u2014 I remember that distinctly, but th \u2014 at that point my mother and\nthe Russian soldiers were selling cans of fat, you know, that chicken \u2014 you know, I\nmean, animal fat. And my mother \u2014 and it would \u2014 they weren't closed cans, they\nwere cans that were \u2014 they filled up with fat, you know. And my mother somehow\nbartered with one of the soldiers for this small can of \u2014 of what \u2014 lard, I guess, you\nknow, it was \u2014 and she you n \u2014 gave up whatever she had and she bought this small\ncan of \u2014 of lard. And you know, soon as the trains left, you know, my \u2014 my mother\nstarted making \u2014 she had \u2014",
        "Q: Something with it.",
        "A: \u2014 grabbed it \u2014 with \u2014 started \u2014 and it turned out there was only an inch of \u2014 of\nlard, and the rest was all potatoes, you know, pota \u2014 you know, mashed potatoes,\nthat stuff.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Yeah, that was a disappointing event. Very disappointing.",
        "Q: To be tricked like that.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, you know. But, you know, it was rough times, rough times.",

        "A: No, we \u2014 we got there, you know, an-and yeah. I \u2014 I remember very distinctly\nmy mother scouring, looking the streets, you know, says, well, something\u2019s on this\nstreet, but the buildings were all destroyed, so she couldn\u2019t tell where the house\nwas, you know. And she kept running around you know, and \u2014 and you know, she\nwas in very disheveled and upset, you know, that she couldn\u2019t find the house. And\nyou know, I guess finally she got oriented and came to where she thought the house\nwas, but it wasn\u2019t there any more, it was destroyed, everything was destroyed, you\nknow [indecipherable]. And \u2014 and that\u2019s when we learned about what happened to\nthe rest of the family, she \u2014",
        "Q: Do you \u2014 did you \u2014 were you part of that, or did you hear it from second telling?\nI mean, how she learned and \u2014 and \u2014 and from whom?",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And \u2014",
        "Q: Do you have any particular memories of that?",
        "A: Not really. Not really.",
        "Q: But you \u2014 but you \u2014 but you recall that the information sort of came, and it\nstarted to dawn that there was nobody left.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, you know, we\u2019d get \u2014 you know, my mother kept running around\nfrom \u2014 you know, trying to find people, trying to do \u2014 find out what happened to so\nand so. And she\u2019d run into somebody who \u2014 who knew something or told her\nsomething, you know, and that\u2019s how it built, you know. And \u2014",
        "Q: Did she find any people whom she had known before the war?",
        "A: She must have found some, but none of them were Jewish, you know \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 it\u2019s a\u2014so, whoever she found, they were \u2014",

        "Q: They would have been more distant.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And do you remember where you stayed when you came back there?",
        "A: Yeah, I \u2014 I \u2014I-\u2014 you know, I remember that, you know, there was a bombed out\nbuilding, and we found a corner in that building, you know, and there were other\nfamilies all over, too. And we were there for, I don\u2019t know, for a period of time, I\ndon\u2019t know exactly how long. There was \u2014 well, what was also happening at the\nsame time is that, I guess some of the Zionists were trying to organize people to go\nto \u2014 to Palestine, to go to Israel, you know. And so, there was an organizing affect\ngoing on at the \u2014 at the same time, so we got \u2014 we got involved with those people,\nwith those \u2014 an-and began our journey to \u2014 to Austria, you know, to the \u2014",
        "Q: So you \u2014 you first went to Palestine before coming to the United States?",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no.",
        "Q: No? Okay.",
        "A: No, wha-what happened is that we \u2014 what \u2014 what these guys, these people, the\norganizers were doing is getting people into displaced person camps, into the DP\ncamps. So a\u2014 then the DP camp for \u2014 for the \u2014 Israel, was in Hallein by Salzburg,\nnear Salzburg, you know. And so we began the journey through to \u2014 to Hallein,\nand you know, that took months also, you know, I mean, there was\n[indecipherable] stops and walk, you know, some \u2014 some walking, some \u2014 but that\nwas more organized, you know, it had \u2014 they would have trucks occasionally, and\nthey would have trains occasionally, yeah. And there was fr \u2014",
        "Q: So there was no reas \u2014 yeah, there was no reason for her to stay in \u2014",
        "A: No, no, no after \u2014 you know, after a period of time, we were there, you know,\nshe \u2014 she \u2014 you know, the family is gone, you know. But she \u2014 she \u2014 you know, she\nknew that she had two sisters though, in the United States, you know, so \u2014 but you\nknow, it took a long time \u2014 well, until we got \u2014 when we got into \u2014 into south sp \u2014\ninto Hallein, we finally got involved with UNRRA, and th-the \u2014 you know, and the\npeople who \u2014 who were trying to find others, you know, a-and so \u2014",
        "Q: It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a\u2014 I mean, you went from one set of mountains, the Ural mountains \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 to another set of mountains, the Alps.",
        "A: Exactly, yeah.",
        "Q: You know? The area around Salzburg is really quite beautiful.",
        "A: It is, yeah, very nice.",
        "Q: And \u2014 and \u2014 and yet, the circumstances are anything but.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: When did the food improve?",
        "A: The what?",
        "Q: When did food improve, that you would be able to have enough to eat, that you\ndidn\u2019t feel hungry.",
        "A: Oh, 1-1-1t \u2014 it \u2014 well, that \u2014 that never \u2014 well, until we got to Hallein, it \u2014 it\ndidn\u2019t. You know, I mean, we kept getting more, but it was \u2014 it was always the\nhoarding, you know, carrying whatever you could in your pockets, you know, and \u2014\nand \u2014 and when we finally got to the DP camp in Hallein, you know, it was\noriginally run by the \u2014 by the army, you \u2014 U.S. Army, and they had the \u2014 the\ngigantic kitchens, you know, and all the \u2014 all the food that you could eat, you know,\nand \u2014",
        "Q: That was the first time.",
        "A: That was \u2014 that was the beginning, yeah. That was the good life, you know.",
        "Q: How long were you there?",
        "A: Almost four years.",
        "Q: Oh my. That\u2019s a long time.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: And this was all \u2014 Hallein was by Salzburg\u201d?",
        "A: Yeah, it is by Salzburg, mm-hm.",
        "Q: So, did you go to school there too?",
        "A: Yeah, what \u2014 what was happening in \u2014 in \u2014 you know, in the camps, you know,\nis \u2014 1s \u2014 because we were in a camp that was designated to \u2014 for \u2014 for Israel, you\nknow, everybody had to learn Hebrew, everybody had to learn a job. So, my\nmother, she was going to school to become a seamstress, you know, I was attending\na school in \u2014 totally in Hebrew, everything was spoken in Hebrew, etcetera. And \u2014\nyou know, so everybody had to become productive, you know, and \u2014 to be ready for\n\u2014 to go to Israel. And, so yeah, that was \u2014 that was a tremendous improvement\ncompared to \u2014 to everything else, you know. The army provided us with clothes,\nthey provided \u2014 I mean, the UNRRA, at the end provided us with cl-clothes and\nfood and, you know. We had movies, I remember movies, you know \u2014",
        "Q: What were the movies?",
        "A: Y-You know, the exact movie I don\u2019t remember, but I remember cowboy\npictures, you know.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: You know, you know. And something like, you know, I think it might have been\na John Wayne movies or something like that, you know [indecipherable]",
        "Q: But you know, it\u2019s really unusual, I don\u2019t know how many people would have\nbeen in a camp, a work camp in the Urals \u2014",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: \u2014 you know, and at the same time at a \u2014 for three or four years.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And then after that end up in a camp run by the U.S. Army and UNRRA \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 you know, near the Alps \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 for another three or four years.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: So the 40s were basically spent in camps, and walking between those camps.",
        "A: Exactly, exactly. Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: And what about \u2014 what about in \u2014 in this camp? I mean, clearly, because it was \u2014\nit was more Jewish \u2014",
        "A: Mm-hm, only Jewish.",
        "Q: \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t be picked on because you were \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 you \u2014 but were there \u2014 was it friendly, was it warmer, was it more accepting?\nWas it \u2014 or did it have its own difficulties as well?",
        "A: You know, I mean like \u2014 like any bureaucracy, and there were buroc \u2014\nbureaucracies there, you know, you had to follow certain rules and regulations, you\nknow, but that was \u2014 that was a good life for me, you know. I \u2014 I remember e \u2014\nattending school, and meeting a lot of kids my age, you know, and \u2014 and running\naround and doing pranks and \u2014 and en-enjoying myself, you know. Then, I was \u2014\nthat was",
        "Q: And were the grownups talking about what had just happened in the war?",
        "A: They \u2014 they \u2014 you know, they didn\u2019t talk much about it at all, you know, I mean\nthey were just kind of tight-lipped, you know, very, very hard to get over. They\nwould \u2014 you know, they would do a lot of, as they say in Yiddish, khasen(ph), you\nknow, they would say \u2014 that sigh. They would sigh, and \u2014 and look at each other\nand say \u2014 you know, and say things that \u2014 they understood each other. They\nunderstood what had transpired. You didn\u2019t have to discuss it, you know. And so,\nyeah, it\u2019s not \u2014 my \u2014",
        "Q: And so that yo \u2014 it wasn\u2019t like as kids you could pick up on some conversations\nthat were transpiring and \u2014 and \u2014 and kind of hear it that way.",
        "A: Yeah, wasn\u2019t much of that going on, you know, I mean, just they didn\u2019t want to\ntalk about it, you know, as they \u2014 I mean, my mother very seldom talked about it,\nyou know, so \u2014 you know, every once in awhile was \u2014",
        "Q: She must have had such a hard time.",
        "A: Yeah, you know, every once in awhile you know, something what happened, and\nit\u2019s \u2014 would offset people, and say, oh, not that Nazi situation, you know\n[indecipherable] and \u2014 but for the most part, that wasn\u2019t \u2014 wasn\u2019t discussed. So \u2014",
        "Q: When did you \u2014 where did \u2014 where did you go from from Hallein?",
        "A: Well, while we were \u2014 we came to the United States, but actually we \u2014 we went\nto Germany first, you know, and we went out of \u2014 we took a ship out of\nBremenhaven(ph). But what had transpired is that my mother, you know, at\nUNRRA, and that was able to find my mother\u2019s two sisters, and \u2014 and the \u2014 in \u2014 in\nthe United States, a-and they immediately sent us visas, you know, and \u2014",
        "Q: Where did they live?",
        "A: Well, one of them was in Boston, and one was in New York City. But I-I\nremember that day, you know, then \u2014 when \u2014 when \u2014 when we got that letter from\nthe, I-I guess through UNRRA, you know, we got a letter from the United States,\nand my aunts, you know, they found my aunts, you know. And my mother was so\nexcited. I remember she was dancing, she was jumping, you know, she was so \u2014\nthat was the \u2014 the \u2014",
        "Q: Well, it was the first feast of \u2014 first piece of good news \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s right, the first \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 in years.",
        "A: \u2014 that\u2019s ri \u2014 exactly. You know, I \u2014 I\u2014 you know, I have such a vivid memory of\nher jumping around and dancing, you know, I-I hadn\u2019t seen her in \u2014 you know,\nnever saw her dancing and jumping around, you know. She \u2014 she was just\noverjoyed. But yeah, that was \u2014",

        "Q: I understand.",
        "A: \u2014 or \u2014 or to be happy about, you know, I mean, she was \u2014",
        "Q: Even \u2014 even in asking that question, I realize that the circumstances, ha \u2014 who\nwould be happy during any of this?",
        "A: Right, but \u2014",
        "Q: But you know, there \u2014 there are people who \u2014 who have an optimistic\ndisposition, and people who are \u2014 have a sadder disposition. That was \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. No, she was more optimistic, I would say, you know \u2014",

        "A: Well, they immediately sent us \u2014 well, immediately, I don\u2019t know how much\ntime transpired, but they sent us a visa right away, you know, for the United States,\nand we said \u2014 we thought, well, next month we\u2019re going to \u2014 to United States. Of\ncourse, we di-didn\u2019t know about the quota.",

You \u2014 but specifically why did it become important? I don\u2019t\nknow, it\u2019s just \u2014 it just [indecipherable] and I \u2014 just something in me that needed to\nfind out more, you know, and still do.",
        "Q: And is there anything that you did find out more? Even if it\u2019s not enough, was\nthere anything that you did find out that you hadn\u2019t known before?",

Really\nhaven\u2019t found out anything about my father, you know, I mean I just haven\u2019t been\nable to make that connection. And all the people that I get ahold of nowadays, you\nknow, seem to be second generation or third generation, and they don\u2019t know what\nhappened, you know, so when you try to find out well, are we cousins, distant\ncousins or something like that, are you \u2014 how is the family tree over here?

        "A: Yeah. No, they \u2014 they \u2014 you know, they were so disorganized, and their\ndocumentation was so horrible, and \u2014 and \u2014 and they buried people wherever they\ncould, you know, I mean \u2014 and there was no documentation, you know, I mean\nthere were trenches, and buried in trenches and they didn\u2019t know who they were\nburying, you know. So, yeah, no \u2014 no, I haven\u2019t been able to \u2014 you know \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014\nyou know, so \u2014",

See, my memory of Russia isn\u2019t that strong\nany more, you know, but of Austria and Hallein it still is, you know, and then the \u2014\nand we went to Hallein and tried to find where \u2014 we knew the camp is gone, you\nknow, I mean, but we tried to find where it was. And we kept going from \u2014 from\none office to another, where was the camp, etcetera, an-and \u2014 and I \u2014 nobody knew,\nyou know. And finally I went to this one travel agent, you know, travel bureau, and\nwent to them, you know, and then kept talking to the people in \u2014 at the desk, you\nknow, and somebody in the back, a young lady in the back heard our discussion.\nAnd she finally says, oh yes, yeah, it was an Juden camp. You know, she \u2014 she\nknew about the \u2014 Grandfather had told me about this Jew camp \u2014 Jewish camp that\nused to be here. And it was on so and so strasse, you know, and \u2014 and there\u2019s a\nlittle plaque someplace now, where the camp was. You know, so we went looking\nfor the camp, we never \u2014 wen \u2014 or for this \u2014 for the plaque, you know, never found\nit.",
        "Q: Well \u2014 you never found the plaque?",
        "A: No, she \u2014 she wasn\u2019t that exact. She \u2014 she thought it was, you know, on so and\nso street, but 1t could have been on another street, you know, and \u2014",
        "Q: And so it\u2019s built over.",
        "A: Yeah, totally, you know, it\u2019s all [indecipherable] buildings that 50 or 60 years\nlater, you know. [inaudible]",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, so \u2014 yeah.",
        "Q: Is there anything from this that you would like to add from what I\u2019ve \u2014 you\nknow, from what we\u2019ve talked about? Is there anything I haven\u2019t asked that you\nthink is important to be a part of this interview?",
        "A: Can\u2019t think of anything specific. The \u2014 you know, the thing that is \u2014 1s \u2014 is \u2014 that\nthe hatred, you know, to overcome all that hatred is just, you know, I-I \u2014 that people\nwould do that to \u2014 to each other is just unbelievable, you know, and it\u2019s just hard \u2014",
        "Q: Is it something you had inside for a long time?",
        "A: You know, I guess, you know, I mean th-the \u2014 the \u2014 th-the thing from the \u2014 from\nRyevka(ph), the thing that still stands out in my mind is that incident with the kids,\nyou know, of them taunting me and \u2014 and \u2014 and calling me, you know, evra(ph) \u2014\nzhid, you know, and \u2014 and \u2014",
        "Q: Which is a terrible \u2014 1n \u2014 in Russian it\u2019s a terrible epithet.",
        "A: Yeah, you know, so th \u2014 that kind of hatred \u2014 and I \u2014 and I knew the kids were \u2014\ndidn\u2019t know what they were doing, you know, but somehow that was passed on to\nthem, you know? Because I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve had that much in \u2014 in \u2014 those young\nkids of \u2014 that had that much exposure to \u2014 to Jews for them to know what to \u2014 to\neven know that they should hate me, or why they hated me, you know, or why they\nkept calling me names. And I think that\u2019s why it dissipated, because they didn\u2019t\nreally know, didn\u2019t have the hatred, it was something that was passed onto them\nfrom \u2014 from their parents or \u2014 or \u2014 you know, from adults, that it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s all right to\npick on Jews, you know, and that thing. So that\u2019s why I think it stopped after a\nperiod of time, because it wasn\u2019t something that came from them, it was passed on\nto them.",
        "Q: But still, the circumstances couldn't have been \u2014 you know, you\u2019re five and a\nhalf, six years old, something like that. Your mother was powerless to try and help\nyou, she\u2019s barely keeping alive.",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: In \u2014 in future \u2014 you know, as you grow older, you can try and build a wall\naround yourself a bit, but at that age, it\u2019s just \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah, that\u2019s what \u2014 that\u2019s what that inexplicable sort of like he \u2014 what do you do\nwith that?",

        "A: Right.",
        "Q: What did that give you?",
        "A: You know, I just \u2014 the idea that, you know, I\u2019m not alone. There are others that\nhave the same thoughts, you know, and most of these people that are \u2014 you\u2019Il \u2014\nyoull meet here, they\u2019re trying to find out what they\u2019ve missed, you know, they \u2014\nyou know, they\u2019re trying to find out \u2014 you know, most of them \u2014 some of them were\nhidden children, they don\u2019t know what was going \u2014 didn\u2019t know what was going on,\nbut they know they lost something and they don\u2019t know what it is, you know. And\nsome of them, of course, are very damaged by it, because they were old enough to\nunderstand. And so \u2014",
        "Q: Do you have kids?",
        "A: Oh yeah, I have \u2014",

        "A: Yeah, y-y-you know. They \u2014 they \u2014 they ask questions, you know, much more\nthan I ever did of my mother and father, you know. So \u2014 so, yeah. Yeah, and \u2014 and\none of our \u2014 I guess, you know, some things ya \u2014 are kind of passed on whether you\nlike it or not, you know. I-I remember \u2014 I have four sons, you know, and I\nremember Eric, my th \u2014 my third son, one day, you know, we were going out to\nbuy a\u2014acar, and he was a young child yet, you know. And I remember we \u2014 we\nwere looking at Volkswagens, and he said, Dad, you\u2019re not gonna buy a German\ncar, are you? He was so upset about that, you know. You know, so he knew \u2014 na \u2014\nunintentionally I-I conveyed that feeling to him, which I didn\u2019t intend to, you know.\nSo, you know.",

        "A: You know, Germany has got some very nice places to \u2014 to visit, etcetera, you\nknow, and I kept concentrating on those, you know, rather than \u2014 and \u2014 and I did go\nto concentration camps, and I did go \u2014 you know, we\u2019ve been to a number of them.\nSo, we got a feeling of the horror, and \u2014 and what transpired, you know, it just\ndoesn\u2019t go away.

I\u2014 I don\u2019t want to have that feeling,\nyou know, I \u2014 you know, the young kids that are coming out of Germany, they had\nno part of it, you know, and so \u2014 a-an-and hopefully we\u2019re conveying enough\ninformation to them that they won\u2019t make the same mistakes, you know?

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: There would have been distance.",

        "Q: That was the first time.",
        "Q: How long were you there?",
        "Q: Oh my. That\u2019s a long time.",

        "Q: What were the movies?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: But you know, it\u2019s really unusual, I don\u2019t know how many people would have\nbeen in a camp, a work camp in the Urals \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 you know, and at the same time at a \u2014 for three or four years.",

        "Q: So the 40s were basically spent in camps, and walking between those camps.",
        "Q: And what about \u2014 what about in \u2014 in this camp? I mean, clearly, because it was \u2014\nit was more Jewish \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t be picked on because you were \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 you \u2014 but were there \u2014 was it friendly, was it warmer, was it more accepting?\nWas it \u2014 or did it have its own difficulties as well?",
        "Q: And were the grownups talking about what had just happened in the war?",
        "Q: And so that yo \u2014 it wasn\u2019t like as kids you could pick up on some conversations\nthat were transpiring and \u2014 and \u2014 and kind of hear it that way.",

        "Q: Even \u2014 even in asking that question, I realize that the circumstances, ha \u2014 who\nwould be happy during any of this?",
        "Q: But you know, there \u2014 there are people who \u2014 who have an optimistic\ndisposition, and people who are \u2014 have a sadder disposition. That was \u2014",
        "Q: But, it sounds \u2014",

She lost \u2014 she \u2014 one \u2014 her finger was frostbitten, she had \u2014 had\nto be amputated. So, yeah.",
        "A: I\u2014 from what I understand, she was making some kind of ammunition, you\nknow. I \u2014 I guess, you know, th-they weren't supposed to pass on any information,\nbut she was making some kind of mi \u2014 ammunition. She was \u2014 it was a fact \u2014 it was\na factory, you know.",
        "A: Not at all, no, she \u2014 you know, I mean, the day was basically \u2014 her day was\nbasically she\u2019d get up in the morning, go to work, you know, come back from work,\nyou know, after many, many hours, tired as, you know, make something to eat, you\nknow, and then fine \u2014 and fall asleep, and \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 same \u2014 exactly, you know. That wa \u2014 that was \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, we were all up at the same time, you know, because everybody \u2014 the\nbarracks emptied out, you know, everybody had to go out either to school or to\nwork, you know, and the \u2014 the barracks were \u2014",
        "A: No, th \u2014 well, there were other kids that wi \u2014 you know, but yeah, and we\u2019d walk\nto school, you know, and \u2014",
        "A: Exactly, yeah, yeah. That\u2019s all.",
        "A: Oh, I was \u2014 that was the big thing, you know, that was, you know, as I say, my \u2014\nmy two major memories of \u2014 of that period are \u2014 are first one, it was the cold, and\nthe second one was the hunger, you know, I mean tha \u2014 I was always hungry. My\nmother \u2014 it \u2014 now, you may not be familiar with the way they operated in \u2014 in the \u2014\nin the work camps, but basically the people would \u2014 who worked in the camps\nwould get paid basically in potatoes, and flour, you know, that was \u2014 that was the\nstaple. And \u2014 and once a month they would, you know, deliver this sack of potatoes\nand you know, sack th \u2014 a small sack of flour, and that was what you had to live on,\nyou know, with \u2014 with the exception of if you exceeded a quota \u2014 you know,\neverybody had \u2014 had a quota to perform. If you exceeded the quota you got s \u2014 an\nadditional staple, you know. And my mother, every couple of weeks she \u2014 she\u2019d\nbring, you know, back a \u2014 a black bread that she got for \u2014",
        "A: Occasionally we\u2019d get cheese, you know. Every once in awhile the Russians\ntransport would be \u2014 transports would come in and the Russians would distribute it\nthroughout that camp, and then they would distribute it. You know, they \u2014 they tried\nvery hard to \u2014 to provide the pe \u2014 food for the people, but the war was raging, and I\nguess the \u2014 the front got the first aspect of it, you know. But yeah, whenever \u2014 you\nknow, I \u2014 I remember very distinctly every once in awhile these trucks showing up,\nyou know, and everybody got a piece of cheese, or everybody got a piece of salami,\nyou know. and yeah, yeah. And that \u2014 that \u2014 that occurred. But for the most part, my\n\u2014 you know, as I say, my mother, she was very industrious, you know. She would\nfind roots, and \u2014 and \u2014 and leaves you know, and she\u2019d make root pancakes, or leaf\npancakes. Every once 1n awhile she\u2019d chop up a root, you know, an-and leaves, you\nknow, so \u2014 yeah. We \u2014 we \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s right. Now this, you know, as I say, I \u2014 I\u2014 I \u2014 when \u2014 when I \u2014\nsomebody asks me about this, you know, a-and I\u2019Il say, I\u2019ll tell you my story, but\nit\u2019s really not my story, it\u2019s my mother\u2019s story, you know. She\u2019s the one that \u2014\nwithout her, I would have had no chance whatsoever. She\u2019s the one that \u2014 you know",
        "A: For almost four and a half years, throughout the war.",
        "A: \u201842 to \u00b045, yeah, you know, so yeah. Wa \u2014 it was three years. Yeah, three years.",
        "A: Throughout the war, yes.",
        "A: I don\u2019t \u2014 no, I can\u2019t recall that. I \u2014 I just \u2014 just don\u2019t remember any, you know,\ngreat times, you know. The only \u2014 the only good time that I remember from the \u2014\nfrom the camp, you know, was \u2014 was when the camp commander would turn on the\nra \u2014 the loudspeakers, and the radio would come on. And that was, I \u2014 I remember\nthe best \u2014 the best of a \u2014 of everything that happened in \u2014 throughout the camp, you\nknow, as radio \u2014",
        "A: The what?",
        "A: There\u2019d be the \u2014 the \u2014 well, yeah, for the most part there would be \u2014 first there\u2019d\nbe the news, you know, of, you know, the \u2014 the Russian front is moving, you know,\nand the Russians are winning and all that kind of stuff. And then \u2014 then there would\nbe patriotic songs and melodies, you know, and that wou \u2014 that always made me\nfeel good, you know, the \u2014 the \u2014 the songs and the melodies, you know, and \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. The \u2014 you know, it \u2014 well, I had that incident with \u2014 with \u2014 you know,\nwhen they first discovered I was Jewish, and they \u2014 they started teasing me and \u2014\nand beating me up, you know. But that didn\u2019t last too long. You know, I mean, it \u2014\nit dissipated and I \u2014 I had a couple of friends, you know, they were \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, I didn't know what was going on except for the fact, you know, when they\nstarted teasing, you know, I \u2014 you know, as I said, my memories of Judaism \u2014\nalthough my f\u2014 my grandfather was a Orthodox Jew. And the picture in here, you\ncan \u2014 you can see, 1s \u2014 well, some place I\u2019ve seen that he is wearing a yarmulke,\nyou know, so he was an Orthodox Jew and \u2014 and my mother told me that \u2014 that they\nwere Orthodox, that her parents were Orthodox. My father was not, you know, from\nwhat \u2014 what she told me, he \u2014 he was not religious. But, you know, an-and \u2014 and\nbut I had very few memories of a young child, in th \u2014 you know, a \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 attending a \u2014 a\u2014a event of some kind yet. And so when \u2014 when they first\nstarted teasing me and calling me, you know \u2014",

I mean, what\nis this?",
        "A: Yeah, what \u2014 you know. A-And I \u2014 I remember that first night, you know, asking\nmy mother [indecipherable] you know \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 tell me, yeah, why is this, you know? And so she 1\u2014 you know, I don\u2019t\nremember her exact comments, but I \u2014 I remember her trying to explain to me, you\nknow, so \u2014 but yeah.",
        "A: You know, th-that something \u2014 you know, I \u2014 I\u2014 I remember her saying \u2014 saying\nsomething about anti-Semitism, but she didn\u2019t use the word anti-Semitism, but I \u2014\nno, I can\u2019t really recollect the exact, you know, what \u2014 what she said.",

        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, just don\u2019t remember it, you know. And I never, you know, never really\nthought about it in that way.",
        "A: Oh yeah, you know, I mean when \u2014 when - right after the war ended, you know,\nthe \u2014 and we came back to Poland, to \u2014 to Sarny, you know, th-that\u2019s \u2014",

        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah.",
        "A: This went on \u2014 when it \u2014 when the first \u2014 I don\u2019t know how they found out that\nwe were Jewish, but somebody \u2014 you know, somebody \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 must have told the kids, and \u2014 and they started picking on me. And that went\non for a period of time, and \u2014 you know \u2014 you know, it got \u2014 first couple of days\nwas pretty bad, you know, and then \u2014 then it dissipated as time went on. And, you\nknow, after awhile it just was \u2014 stopped, you know. So \u2014",
        "A: No, we th \u2014 for one thing, we really didn\u2019t know what was happening. We were,\nyou know, all the way in the Ural mountains, you know, where \u2014 a-and the only\ninformation we had was that \u2014 the radio that would come on, and of course, that\nwouldn\u2019t be on there.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, they\u2019d \u2014 you know, the mother worked hard, like the same as my\nmother, and \u2014 you know, the \u2014 the boy was my age, so we were friends, you know,\nand we had chores that we would do together, and we would do ye \u2014 you know,\nlike, for example, we had the buckets, the waste bucket in each room. And in the\nmorning, you know, he would take the ba \u2014 waste bucket up one day and I would\ntake it out the next day, take it to the pits, you know, and get rid or it, and so yeah,\nwe \u2014 we were friends, you know, yeah.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember of us \u2014 an incident stealing food, but that was, you know,\npunishable by death.",

        "A: Well, when the war finished, everybody started \u2014 you know, they didn\u2019t need\nany more workers in the \u2014 in the \u2014 you know, th-they \u2014 so everybody started going\nhome, and took us months and months of walking and catching rides, and \u2014 and \u2014\nand \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, pretty much so, because you know, you got \u2014 I don\u2019t know, the camp was\nso gigantic, I would say at least 50 - 100,000 people there, you know. And\neverybody was going their own way. And, you know, of course you couldn\u2019t do it\nin the winter, you know, but su \u2014 as soon as the spring came, you know, the \u2014 a\ncouple of months of sist \u2014 of summer that occurred in the Ural mountains,\neverybody started going home. You know, and of course, you know, there\u2019s \u2014 just\nwerent enough trains, or I don\u2019t know, there weren\u2019t any trains that were taking\npeople home, you know, but yeah, people started walking home.",
        "A: I remem \u2014 I remember wal \u2014 well, not exactly when I left the camp. I remember\nwalking and I remember, you know, places we used to \u2014 some places we stopped, I\nremember, and you know, and I remember, y-you know, like the \u2014 when we \u2014 when\nwe got to the \u2014 to \u2014 to certain places, you know, we\u2019d stop a-a-an-and go to bombed\nout houses, or \u2014 or destroyed places, and go into those and sleep in there, and try to,\nyou know, and walk the next day.",
        "A: And there were \u2014",
        "A: The what?",
        "A: Yeah, and there \u2014 you know, as I say, there was always \u2014 there was always some\nkind of a barter system that was going on. You know, people kept bartering, you\nknow, and I don\u2019t know if there \u2014 1t was \u2014 1t was the nearby farms, or what, you\nknow? The \u2014 the nearby areas that there \u2014 but there was always \u2014 so I remember,\nyou know, every once 1n awhile we\u2019d \u2014 we\u2019d catch a ride, you know, or if \u2014 you\nknow, and \u2014 and I remember one time we were on a train, on a cattle car, and we\u2019d\nstopped at this station, and there was a \u2014 another train, th-the next \u2014 the next\nrailroad track, and were all Russian soldiers, they were returning from \u2014 from the \u2014\nyou know, from the war, basically. A lot of them were, you know, bandaged up and\netcetera, but they \u2014 I remember that distinctly, but th \u2014 at that point my mother and\nthe Russian soldiers were selling cans of fat, you know, that chicken \u2014 you know, I\nmean, animal fat. And my mother \u2014 and it would \u2014 they weren't closed cans, they\nwere cans that were \u2014 they filled up with fat, you know. And my mother somehow\nbartered with one of the soldiers for this small can of \u2014 of what \u2014 lard, I guess, you\nknow, it was \u2014 and she you n \u2014 gave up whatever she had and she bought this small\ncan of \u2014 of lard. And you know, soon as the trains left, you know, my \u2014 my mother\nstarted making \u2014 she had \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 grabbed it \u2014 with \u2014 started \u2014 and it turned out there was only an inch of \u2014 of\nlard, and the rest was all potatoes, you know, pota \u2014 you know, mashed potatoes,\nthat stuff.",
        "A: Yeah, that was a disappointing event. Very disappointing.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, you know. But, you know, it was rough times, rough times.",
        "A: No, everybody was so anxious to get home, you know, everybody, you know \u2014\nyou know, you walked, you [indecipherable]",

        "A: The Ural \u2014 you know, from the Ural mountains, you know, we \u2014 we wound up\ngoing \u2014 yeah, I guess it may have been the Ukraine, I\u2019m no \u2014 I\u2019m not quite sure\nthat \u2014 of the route, you know, what routes we took.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: You know, I must have, but you know, I \u2014 so much got blocked out that I \u2014 I \u2014\nyou know, most of \u2014 most of the horrible events, I just don\u2019t remember, you know.\nJust don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: Had to be in the spring, because it was just too cold",
        "A: Right, yeah. So, yeah, it was shortly after the war ended. Must have been jul \u2014\nJune or July or something like that, that I would say, because we were there for a\nperiod \u2014 the little period longer after the war ended, you know, s-so \u2014",
        "A: I was nine, yeah in \u2014 it\u2019s right, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, we \u2014 we got there, you know, an-and yeah. I \u2014 I remember very distinctly\nmy mother scouring, looking the streets, you know, says, well, something\u2019s on this\nstreet, but the buildings were all destroyed, so she couldn\u2019t tell where the house\nwas, you know. And she kept running around you know, and \u2014 and you know, she\nwas in very disheveled and upset, you know, that she couldn\u2019t find the house. And\nyou know, I guess finally she got oriented and came to where she thought the house\nwas, but it wasn\u2019t there any more, it was destroyed, everything was destroyed, you\nknow [indecipherable]. And \u2014 and that\u2019s when we learned about what happened to\nthe rest of the family, she \u2014",

And she\u2019d run into somebody who \u2014 who knew something or told her\nsomething, you know, and that\u2019s how it built, you know. And \u2014",
        "A: She must have found some, but none of them were Jewish, you know \u2014",

        "A: Yeah, I \u2014 I \u2014I-\u2014 you know, I remember that, you know, there was a bombed out\nbuilding, and we found a corner in that building, you know, and there were other\nfamilies all over, too. And we were there for, I don\u2019t know, for a period of time, I\ndon\u2019t know exactly how long. There was \u2014 well, what was also happening at the\nsame time is that, I guess some of the Zionists were trying to organize people to go\nto \u2014 to Palestine, to go to Israel, you know. And so, there was an organizing affect\ngoing on at the \u2014 at the same time, so we got \u2014 we got involved with those people,\nwith those \u2014 an-and began our journey to \u2014 to Austria, you know, to the \u2014",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no.",
        "A: No, wha-what happened is that we \u2014 what \u2014 what these guys, these people, the\norganizers were doing is getting people into displaced person camps, into the DP\ncamps. So a\u2014 then the DP camp for \u2014 for the \u2014 Israel, was in Hallein by Salzburg,\nnear Salzburg, you know. And so we began the journey through to \u2014 to Hallein,\nand you know, that took months also, you know, I mean, there was\n[indecipherable] stops and walk, you know, some \u2014 some walking, some \u2014 but that\nwas more organized, you know, it had \u2014 they would have trucks occasionally, and\nthey would have trains occasionally, yeah. And there was fr \u2014",

But she \u2014 she \u2014 you know, she\nknew that she had two sisters though, in the United States, you know, so \u2014 but you\nknow, it took a long time \u2014 well, until we got \u2014 when we got into \u2014 into south sp \u2014\ninto Hallein, we finally got involved with UNRRA, and th-the \u2014 you know, and the\npeople who \u2014 who were trying to find others, you know, a-and so \u2014",

You know, I mean, we kept getting more, but it was \u2014 it was always the\nhoarding, you know, carrying whatever you could in your pockets, you know, and \u2014\nand \u2014 and when we finally got to the DP camp in Hallein, you know, it was\noriginally run by the \u2014 by the army, you \u2014 U.S. Army, and they had the \u2014 the\ngigantic kitchens, you know, and all the \u2014 all the food that you could eat, you know,\nand \u2014",

        "A: Yeah, what \u2014 what was happening in \u2014 in \u2014 you know, in the camps, you know,\nis \u2014 1s \u2014 because we were in a camp that was designated to \u2014 for \u2014 for Israel, you\nknow, everybody had to learn Hebrew, everybody had to learn a job. So, my\nmother, she was going to school to become a seamstress, you know, I was attending\na school in \u2014 totally in Hebrew, everything was spoken in Hebrew, etcetera. And \u2014\nyou know, so everybody had to become productive, you know, and \u2014 to be ready for\n\u2014 to go to Israel. And, so yeah, that was \u2014 that was a tremendous improvement\ncompared to \u2014 to everything else, you know. The army provided us with clothes,\nthey provided \u2014 I mean, the UNRRA, at the end provided us with cl-clothes and\nfood and, you know. We had movies, I remember movies, you know \u2014",
        "A: Y-You know, the exact movie I don\u2019t remember, but I remember cowboy\npictures, you know.",

Cause that link \u2014 and as I say, we started writing to people\nand trying to find out, and as a matter of fact, we took trips to try to talk to cousins\nwho may have spoken to somebody, an-and try to gather as much as we could, and\n\u2014 and didn't get much.",

Really\nhaven\u2019t found out anything about my father, you know, I mean I just haven\u2019t been\nable to make that connection. And all the people that I get ahold of nowadays, you\nknow, seem to be second generation or third generation, and they don\u2019t know what\nhappened, you know, so when you try to find out well, are we cousins, distant\ncousins or something like that, are you \u2014 how is the family tree over here? What is\nthe \u2014 it just \u2014 it just \u2014",

        "A: Yeah. No, they \u2014 they \u2014 you know, they were so disorganized, and their\ndocumentation was so horrible, and \u2014 and \u2014 and they buried people wherever they\ncould, you know, I mean \u2014 and there was no documentation, you know, I mean\nthere were trenches, and buried in trenches and they didn\u2019t know who they were\nburying, you know. So, yeah, no \u2014 no, I haven\u2019t been able to \u2014 you know \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014\nyou know, so \u2014",

See, my memory of Russia isn\u2019t that strong\nany more, you know, but of Austria and Hallein it still is, you know, and then the \u2014\nand we went to Hallein and tried to find where \u2014 we knew the camp is gone, you\nknow, I mean, but we tried to find where it was. And we kept going from \u2014 from\none office to another, where was the camp, etcetera, an-and \u2014 and I \u2014 nobody knew,\nyou know. And finally I went to this one travel agent, you know, travel bureau, and\nwent to them, you know, and then kept talking to the people in \u2014 at the desk, you\nknow, and somebody in the back, a young lady in the back heard our discussion.\nAnd she finally says, oh yes, yeah, it was an Juden camp. You know, she \u2014 she\nknew about the \u2014 Grandfather had told me about this Jew camp \u2014 Jewish camp that\nused to be here. And it was on so and so strasse, you know, and \u2014 and there\u2019s a\nlittle plaque someplace now, where the camp was.

The \u2014 you know, the thing that is \u2014 1s \u2014 is \u2014 that\nthe hatred, you know, to overcome all that hatred is just, you know, I-I \u2014 that people\nwould do that to \u2014 to each other is just unbelievable, you know, and it\u2019s just hard \u2014",

Because I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve had that much in \u2014 in \u2014 those young\nkids of \u2014 that had that much exposure to \u2014 to Jews for them to know what to \u2014 to\neven know that they should hate me, or why they hated me, you know, or why they\nkept calling me names. And I think that\u2019s why it dissipated, because they didn\u2019t\nreally know, didn\u2019t have the hatred, it was something that was passed onto them\nfrom \u2014 from their parents or \u2014 or \u2014 you know, from adults, that it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s all right to\npick on Jews, you know, and that thing.
