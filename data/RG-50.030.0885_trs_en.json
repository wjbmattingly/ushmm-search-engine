        "Q: Kitty Miriam Weiss. And has it stayed Kitty the whole time?",
        "A: Yes, that was the name my mother found for me. She read a book. She liked the name\nKitty. And so I\u2019ve been Kitty.",

        "Q: So even for something as simple and, and recognizable",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That comes up. So what about the rest of your family. Did you have brothers and\nsisters?",
        "A: Yes, I have an older, had an older sister and, her name was Inge Weiss. And she was\ntwo and a half years older than me.",
        "Q: So she born in 1931.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: And what about your parents? What were their names?",
        "A: My father\u2019s name was Lizer.",
        "Q: Lizer.",
        "A: Lizer, Lazer Weiss. And he came from Knihynicze.",
        "Q: Knihynicze?",
        "A: Knihynicze.",
        "Q: And what is that?",
        "A: That was in Galicia. However, it has changed borders and, and rulers constantly.",
        "Q: So when you say Galicia, Knihynicze, was it a shtetl? Was it a town?",
        "A: I think so. I think it was a shtetl.",
        "Q: Did you ever go there?",
        "A: No. I\u2019ve never found it. ve never found it on a map, but a cousin of mine who is\nvery savvy on the internet found it.",
        "Q: Oh really. So now at least you know where it is.",
        "A: Exactly, and the spelling, which is extraordinary.",
        "Q: The places in that part of the world can have five spellings for a small town, a small\nplace, five different languages. Did your father ever speak of it?",
        "A: He did. Not too fondly. He was very eager to get away from it and he served in the\nFirst World War and had a chance to see the world, a little more of the world. And he\nwas very eager to get away from Knihynicze.",
        "Q: Can you give me a sense, now that you\u2019ve found it on a map, where is Knihynicze?\nWhere in Galicia would that be?",

        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: Is it near any large city that you were able to place when you finally \u2014",
        "A: No but he always spoke of Krakow, which is in Poland and he, he sort of hoped that\nthat was, that was a goal of his to go to Krakow.",

        "A: It is, \u2019ve been there yes.",
        "Q: Did your father come from a large family himself?",
        "A: He was the oldest and he had quite a few sisters and brothers. And his father was a\ncarpenter who quickly brought him into the business. And so he learned carpentry from\nknee high up and he became a carpenter, which served him very well throughout his life.",
        "Q: Yes, it\u2019s one of those types of skills that is transferrable. A lawyer may not be able to\nbe a lawyer in every country, but a carpenter, that\u2019s different.",
        "A: And it gave him sort of a privileged position during the First World War when his\ncommanding officer recognized his talent and sort of kept him close by to feather his love\nnest basically. And so he, he made things for this--",
        "Q: Commanding officer",
        "A: Commanding officer. And stayed safe.",
        "Q: One thing I didn\u2019t ask was which army did he serve with. That\u2019s also not a done deal.",
        "A: Right. It must have been the Kaiser\u2019s army.",
        "Q: It would have been the German depression army?",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: Not the Austro-Hungarian army\u201d?",
        "A: You know, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Poland when it was subdivided, well basically torn apart in 1795 1s when it went to\nAustro-Hungary, to Prussia and to Russia and when your father was born, he was born in\none of those three places. Whether it was the Russian part--",
        "A: I think it was Austria, Austria. Yes.",
        "Q: So then it probably was the Austrian army.",
        "A: Army. Correct. Yeah. He spoke German so.",
        "Q: Well both places, Prussia and Austro-Hungary.",
        "A: Well they were on the same side.",
        "Q: What else did he tell you about his life, as he was growing up that sticks in your mind?",
        "A: Well they were, you know, in a small town and the, everybody watched everybody\nelse and made sure that you were doing the right thing. That you were going to cheder,\nyou were observing the holidays. And of course it was a very kosher home. And that\u2019s,\nthat was you know all he knew. When his father died suddenly, he was 14 years old.",
        "Q: Oh he was very young.",
        "A: He was very young and he became the head of the house.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a huge burden for a young boy.",
        "A: It was and he never got, he never quite got over it. I mean I think the man was a\ngenius.",
        "Q: Your father.",
        "A: Yes. And the older I get, the more I can relate to what he went through, but he was\nvery stern. And he had all these kids to take care of. And his mother. To take care of.\nAnd he did it, he did.",
        "Q: What year was he born?",
        "A: He was born in 1892.",
        "Q: So his father would have died in 1906, something like that. And he took care of these\nkids. He had learned the carpentry trade from his own father, during those first few years\nthat he had with him. And he served in the Austro-Hungarian army during World War I.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: Where the carpentry kept him safe.",
        "A: Exactly. Exactly.",
        "Q: Did you ever know any of your aunts and uncles, his brothers and sisters?",
        "A: I, I knew two of them. There was a hard feelings in that family. Very, very hard\nfeelings. And so there was a rift and I did not really get to know them. I know of them but\nI did not have a direct experience with them.",
        "Q: You say when you know two of them, you know of two of them, rather than having\nmet them?",
        "A: I think we did meet them. In fact one of my father\u2019s sisters came to meet the boat\nwhen we arrived.",
        "Q: Oh I see, so she had already been to the United States. She was already in America.",
        "A: Correct, yes. My grandmother\u2019s, his, my father\u2019s mother, Chia Rivka Goldberg had a\nlarge extended family and some of them had emigrated to the United States. Probably\nbefore the First World War. And so there was a family on this side of the ocean yes.\nAnd they were the ones who provided the first visas for our family.",
        "Q: We\u2019ll come to that. Now what did your father tell you about his own parents, his own,\nwhat kind of people they were and things like that.",
        "A: He didn\u2019t really talk about them too much. As I say, by the time he was talking to me\nthere was this rift.",
        "Q: Do you know what it was due to?",
        "A: It was a lack of appreciation for what he had done for them. It was a lack of\nacknowledgment and he just couldn\u2019t get over that. So he just turned his back on them.\nIt was very painful.",
        "Q: I can imagine or I can\u2019t imagine actually.",
        "A: Well it meant that you know we didn\u2019t have any supportive family around.",
        "Q: And that means in Vienna?",
        "A: No, this was in the United States. In Vienna, his mother had her own apartment,\nwhich my father supported.",
        "Q: So you knew your grandmother?",
        "A: A little bit, yeah. Yeah.",
        "Q: Do you have any memories of her?",
        "A: Just that she was very tiny. Very tiny and she didn\u2019t speak German. She spoke\nYiddish and we didn\u2019t have much, much contact. Yeah.",
        "Q: What about religion? Was he brought up in a very orthodox family? Or?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think they were you know really committed to orthodoxy but the trappings of\northodoxy. Kosher home and food and observation of major holidays. I don\u2019t think the,\nthe real ethnic deepness of the Jewish religion was something that they actually felt\nconnected to.",
        "Q: Even your grandparents\u2019 generation?",
        "A: I think I think it was just \u2014",
        "Q: Tradition.",
        "A: Yes, just the trappings of it. I don\u2019t think they were intellectually rooted in Judaism.",
        "Q: Did the children that means your father and his siblings, what kind of schooling did\nthey get?",
        "A: My fa, well as I said my father left school by the time he was 14. And he was very\nfrustrated with the schooling because it was German one day and then they\u2019d come back\nfrom a vacation and they, everything was in Polish. Then everything was in Russian.\nAnd he just lost patience with the whole thing. He just said to heck with it.",
        "Q: Well that\u2019s what happens when borders change.",
        "A: He just, it was too frustrating.",
        "Q: Now your mother, let\u2019s turn to her side of the family. Where was your mother from?",
        "A: My mother was born in Vienna.",
        "Q: And what was her maiden name?",
        "A: Her maiden name was Zehngut, which means ten times good. And her parents were\nAustrian. Her father was a photographer and a inventor. He invented a washing machine\nand he invented all kinds of useful things but he never made money. He never made\nmoney at that.",
        "Q: Sometimes it\u2019s not the inventors who do. It\u2019s the people who take their ideas and\nmarket them.",
        "A: Right and there were no patents and everything. But he was a very kindly person, very\ngenerous and very nice.",
        "Q: Do you remember him\u2019?",
        "A: Barely, barely. I remember my mother\u2019s impressions of him where he was very gentle\nand very kind to the girls. She had two sisters and she was the youngest. And her mother\nwas, her maiden name was, the mother\u2019s maiden name was Ernestina Deutch.",
        "Q: Ernestine German.",
        "A: Yes. And she had several siblings whom I knew. And she actually was the\nbreadwinner of the family and she did sewing which many of the women did in those\ndays, because everything was hand made. Clothing was hand made. And so she\nsupported the family. And she was you know she had a tough job. She had a tough job.",
        "Q: At a time when that wasn\u2019t acknowledged so easily or almost at all by society that\nwomen were supporting families, more than men were. Some of them ended up in such a\npredicament. Was your maternal side of the family well to do or struggling do you think?",
        "A: I think they were struggling. I think they were struggling to be middle class. But they\nvalued culture. They loved to go to the opera and dances and beautiful clothes and\nVienna was sort of a, I don\u2019t know, high class place like Paris and New York.",
        "Q: Before the Austro-Hungarian empire fell 1t certainly was.",
        "A: Yes, yes. and the trappings are still there. The Baroque buildings and the opera and\nmuseums and that\u2019s still there. And the art and the music. Very, very proud of it, the\nAustrians. Especially the Viennese.",
        "Q: Do you know much about your mother\u2019s side of the family, if they had been Viennese\nfor generations. Or whether they had come from someplace else?",
        "A: Well with the name of Deutch. I would guess that maybe they were sort of more from\nGermany and her father, Zehngut, had a branch of the family that was in Eisenstaedt,\nwhich is, well it was the mining area, probably more to the east. So there is some\nrelationship there. So it was Austria.",
        "Q: Within those lands, within the German speaking lands--",
        "A: Exactly, exactly. And the Austrian empire, the Hungarian empire was quite extensive.",
        "Q: What was your mother\u2019s first name?",
        "A: Stella.",
        "Q: Stella. And so her maiden name was Stella, she was Stella Zehngut.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: Do you know how your parents met?",
        "A: I do not, I do not.",
        "Q: Were they very different as people?",
        "A: I think so. I think they were, I think my mother was very proud of her Austrian\nheritage and sort of lauded it over my father who was, who was the country bumpkin.",
        "Q: Well you know I didn\u2019t want to ask it quite like that but these are different worlds.\nThe world of Vienna even if you are let\u2019s say in a lower middle class and the world of the\ntown I can\u2019t pronounce.",
        "A: Knihynicze.",
        "Q: Knihynicze, the world of Knihynicze are two different ones and you know when\nthey\u2019re blended you know how do they mix.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah there was always that tension. Yeah but you know she recognized that he\nalways earned a good living and that he was very reliable and very dependable but had\nrough edges.",
        "Q: What were their personalities like as people, your parents.",
        "A: Well my father loved to work. He really liked his work and he knew that he had\nability. He could look at something and make it. He could design something new and\ndid. I have some of his furniture that he made for me. Yes. Made here in the United\nStates. So he was, he was really, I think he was a genius. If he had, had any schooling he\nwould have god knows where he would have been. But and my mother was very, you\u2019d\nhave to call it shtultz, she was very proud. And snooty. Kind of snooty. I have to say\nthat. Yeah and so she always liked pretty things and made sure that her girls had pretty\nthings. And that sort of thing. But she was a very strong woman. I mean she, she was the\none who signed us up to come to America. My father was in Knihynicze taking care of\nthings there. He was out of town at the time. And she signed us up. When he came home\nit was fait accompli.",
        "Q: Oh my goodness.",
        "A: Yeah. He went crazy.",
        "Q: I can imagine. You know one parent taking you know the decision on the children.\nAnd such a decision. We\u2019ll come to that. But this sets the scene, this really does. And\nwhat about as parents. Was there one parent that you were closer to than the other?",
        "A: Well I think children are especially girls are close to their mothers. And it\u2019s only later\nthat they discover that their fathers are people too. My father seemed brusque and he was\nvery powerfully built so he was a little scary.",
        "Q: Was he a handsome man\u2019?",
        "A: I think so yes. They were both handsome people. So yeah.",
        "Q: For a little girl--",
        "A: He was tough. He was yeah, I sort of [pushes hands away]",
        "Q: Were your parents strong disciplinarians?",
        "A: Well they were very protective. For girls. Very protective. But we were such good\ngirls. We didn\u2019t do anything. We were such good girls. We were so\u2014",
        "Q: You were well behaved.",
        "A: --And nice, yes. I don\u2019t know where that came from. But I made up for it. (laughs)",
        "Q: The second part of one\u2019s life one undoes the first part.",
        "A: Probably. [wipes mouth]",
        "Q: What do you remember from home, from your home in Vienna. Can you tell me what\nit looked like?",
        "A: We had an apartment in Vienna. I believe it was on the second floor. And it was on\nRohdenstern Gasse.",
        "Q: Rohdenstern Gasse.",
        "A: Rohdenstern Gasse.",
        "Q: Red star street. Alley, actually.",
        "A: And I remember that each room had a ceramic heater.",
        "Q: You mean one of those old stoves that you put coal into.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "Q: Those used to be huge.",
        "A: They, each room had its own heating. You know Vienna being in Central Europe was\nquite chilly so yes, and it was heated with coals. The furniture, my father made every\nstitch.",
        "Q: Really. Everything that you had \u2014",
        "A: Everything yes.",
        "Q: Did he have a workshop nearby.",
        "A: Yes. I don\u2019t know the address of it. But it was nearby. And it was a Jewish\nneighborhood. And it was not fancy. I mean we didn\u2019t have the furniture that we have\ntoday. We did not entertain at home. And my children puzzled about that. That I don\u2019t\u2019\nentertain. They said didn\u2019t you entertain in Vienna. No. People met in cafes. They did\nnot, it was only family that came home. And had you know \u2014",
        "Q: Oh, so that\u2019s like Manhattan. In Manhattan people don\u2019t have space to entertain so\nthey meet in restaurants.",
        "A: Well they meet in restaurants, but this was you know this predates that by quite a bit.\nIt was the home was for the family.",
        "Q: So it was more than just space. It was a tradition, it was a way\u2014",
        "A: It was yes and, and it was around the dining room table and meals that one had\nentertainment with the family. So there was not the easy chair kind of sitting area. There\nwere bedrooms and there was probably like a big common area. I don\u2019t remember the\nkitchen at all. I probably was not permitted to go into the kitchen. We did have a maid.\nBecause there was so much you know in terms of coal and, and laundry and cooking that\nunless you were very poor, you had a maid.",
        "Q: It was far more prevalent in Europe \u2014",
        "A: Yes. it was not unusual. You know it was not the status thing that we have. It was a\nnecessity. And the maid very often would be a young woman from the country who was\nlooking for opportunities to meet a nice young man, somebody that wouldn\u2019t be in her\nhome town.",
        "Q: Everybody wanted to get away from all those eyes.",
        "A: Yes, yes. Totally understandable. But I do remember that the we had Christmas for\nthe maid and I would hang up a stocking and I would get a hunk of coal in the, in the toe,\njust to keep me humble. And oranges. And it was not a matter of toys so much but it was\njust you know little things. But I do remember the hunk of coal which was supposed to be\nif you were a bad girl.",
        "Q: And you weren\u2019t.",
        "A: NO. Let\u2019s see what else. I do, well when, when things got bad, after Kristallnacht\nwhich was 1938, which I do remember. And so pretty soon the maid said that she\ncouldn\u2019t\u2019 work for a Jewish family. Her boyfriend was a Nazi. And so the maid left.",
        "Q: And that was a real change.",
        "A: It was, it was. We really liked her.",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: Erica.",
        "Q: Did your mother take in sewing like your grandmother did?",
        "A: No. No she did not have to do that.",
        "Q: Was her role basically running the household?",
        "A: Exactly. She was running the household and taking my sister to school. And then\nwhen things got bad and she was trying to figure out what to do, of course my father was\nworking. Working, working. She was figuring out what to do. She left us alone. My\nsister went to school. Now I can\u2019t imagine that I was totally alone in the apartment, but I\nwould paint. I was you know I was painting and drawing from the time I could hold a\npencil. And so I was busy with my own things that I was doing.",
        "Q: And this was on paper not like on the walls or anything like that?",
        "A: No, no, no. This was on paper with water colors and colored pencils.",
        "Q: I painted on the walls.",
        "A: No I wouldn\u2019t think of that. Oh my goodness. You were a free spirit.",
        "Q: I paid.\nA: I bet yeah. No, no, this was just at a desk. And I would be busy for hours.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back before history and politics and you know makes itself felt. Did you have\nplumbing and \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes. oh yes, yes.",
        "Q: So there was running water?",
        "A: Running water, plumbing.",
        "Q: There was a bathroom?",
        "A: Yes, yes. Tub, yes.",
        "Q: And of course, I would assume, electricity.",
        "A: Yes. Even a telephone.",
        "Q: You had a telephone. Did you have a radio?",
        "A: Yes. one of those big curvy jobs, yes. And my father listened intently in the evening\nto the radio.",
        "Q: Was it music or was it news or was it\u2014",
        "A: Oh he wanted only the news. But there was, there was music too, yes.",
        "Q: At the workshop where he worked, was he self-employed and the only person?",
        "A: He was, no he hired. He had people working for him and one worker in particular was\nhe probably had been with him for years. And he actually warned us of Kristallnacht\nand warned that we were not to open the door, no matter what. And when the storm\ntroopers and the Black Shirts came and knocked on the door, and banged and called for\nmy father to come out, he did not. He would have been sent off to Buchenwald or god\nknows what.",
        "Q: So I just want to make sure. Can you tell me the name of that worker who warned\nyour father. Did you know him?",
        "A: I can\u2019t come up with a name now. I, I guess I didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t\u2019 really go to the shop.",
        "Q: Did any of them ever come to your home, any of those workers.",
        "A: No. No.",
        "Q: But was your father friendly with them?",
        "A: I guess so. I mean I guess he was a good employer. He, he was very short with\npeople. They had to, he had few people. In the United States he never kept a worker.\nThey just didn\u2019t do it right or you know he didn\u2019t\u2019 have the patience to teach yeah.",
        "Q: But there he is, this person felt this obligation.",
        "A: Right. Kristallnacht in Germany had preceded the one in Austria.",
        "Q: So what was the date for \u2014",
        "A: It was November tenth, 1938.",
        "Q: I believe it was the day earlier.",
        "A: In Germany, yes, yes. And so he got wind of it and warned my father.",
        "Q: Did you father ever speak of that in later years.",
        "A: Not really, no.",
        "Q: Do you remember the banging \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes. We were all in one bed.",
        "Q: Were you really?",
        "A: Yeah. But and my, you know the idea was to be hushed and not make a peep, not\nbreathe. And so they went away and they came back and they banged and yelled again.\nBut at that time they didn\u2019t break in. They didn\u2019t break in. They just expected\ncooperation.",
        "Q: You said you lived in a Jewish neighborhood.",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: I think they were mostly focused on family.",
        "Q: Did they talk much to one another about these events, this wider world?",
        "A: My father sort of as I said, he listened to the radio and, and my mother read the\nnewspapers. And he said you know Hitler was a menace and that he was going to go after\nEngland which was you know out of the blue. Nobody really thought that that would ever\nhappen. That he, he really he\u2019s going to go after England. My mother read the paper.\nAnd my mother socialized in the cafes. And there was an exchange of information. I\nmean that\u2019s all they, they really talked about was you know the oncoming menace and\nhow do we get out. My mother, I don\u2019t\u2019 know how she got the addresses of the family\nthat was in New York. We wrote to them. \u2014",
        "Q: You mean your father\u2019s side of the family.",
        "A: Correct. She wrote to them and asked for visas. For the family.",
        "Q: Did they supply them? Did the New York relatives supply them.",
        "A: Well I think they wrote back that they were not wealthy and that they would send the\nvisa for my father. And that as soon as he became established he would bring family.\nAnd that\u2019s the way it had been done previously.",
        "Q: It\u2019s true. In the first wave of immigration that often is what happened. One family\nmember came over and then brought the rest. But who knew that this was not going to be\nthat kind of situation ---",
        "A: Exactly, exactly. So they sent papers, visa and their, immigration was tight. Visas\nwere allocated according to strict quotas and so they sent visas for my father, and I\nbelieve for his brother.",
        "Q: Was his brother in Vienna as well?",
        "A: I guess so, I guess so. I guess he lived with his mother. And that was in a separate\napartment.",
        "Q: So when you father had turned his back on the family, it wasn\u2019t to his mother.",
        "A: It was much later.",
        "Q: Oh that was much later.",
        "A: It was state side, state side. No he supported his family through thick and thin. And so\nthey sent those visas and not for my mother and not for my sister and me. And so my\nmother, as I said, was constantly reading the newspapers and talking to people and\nhearing what how everybody was trying to get away. and she came across this article in\nthe paper that this family was coming. And they were going to bring 50 children out of\nVienna.",
        "Q: This must have been a Jewish newspaper. Was it?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I, my mother did not read Hebrew.",
        "Q: No, no but I mean a German speaking or maybe there weren\u2019t any by that point.\nBecause I can\u2019t imagine that in an Austrian newspaper such a thing would have been\npublished.",
        "A: I think it might have been a little ad something like that.",
        "Q: Maybe something innocuous.",
        "A: Yeah. They were the Krauses were below the radar. They were very, they did not\ncall attention to themselves either in Vienna or when they got to the United States. It was\nvery hush, hush. There were kindertransports going to England.",
        "Q: A lot.",
        "A: Yes. And my cousins went.",
        "Q: Your mother\u2019s side?",

And so we, were closer to them and we went to the park together and stuff\nlike that. And my aunt Olga, had an opportunity to sign her kids up.",
        "Q: This is one of your mother\u2019s older sisters, mother\u2019s older sisters. --",
        "A: Correct. Her oldest sister. And so that was a little precedent that and of course they\nwere older than these, my sister and me. So Herta went to England as an au pair, to a\nfamily. And Freddy was adopted into an English home, where they had already adopted\na boy out of Berlin. So they that was the precedent and they left quite a while before my\nsister and I.",
        "Q: And your mother\u2019s father, was he alive then your grandfather \u2014",
        "A: He was. He had cancer at some point, came down with cancer. And all these things.\nWhether there\u2019s a war going on or and he was at home. And he died I think shortly after\nwe left.",

        "A: She was alive. And her oldest daughter stayed back with her.",
        "Q: That wasn\u2019t Herta. That was \u2014",
        "A: That was Herta\u2019s mother.",
        "Q: Oh excuse me. So Herta\u2019s mother stayed.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And her name was what?",
        "A: Olga.",
        "Q: Excuse me. You had told me. Yes, so they two stayed together.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And what about the other sister?",
        "A: The other sister, Annie, was married, well Olga was married too. Annie went, her\nhusband was Bulgarian.\n(cut)",
        "Q: Annie, what happened with her?",
        "A: Annie was married. She had no children. Her husband was Bulgarian. His name was\nTager. Annie, Tager. And we always called him Tager. I don\u2019t know that he had any\nother name. He must have. but when things got bad, everybody kind of made a plan. And\nthey said well I\u2019m going to do this and either you\u2019re going to come with me or you\u2019re\nnot. And many people did that.",
        "Q: So what did Annie do?",
        "A: Annie I think she went to France and ultimately she was interned. In a camp in Nice.\nAnd she spent the war years in Nice and survived.",
        "Q: What about Tager? What happened to him\u2019?",
        "A: No one knows. He went back to Bulgaria and disappeared.",
        "Q: Was he Jewish?",
        "A: I believe so, yes.",
        "Q: So that could have been --",
        "A: Right, right. He got caught in some net.",
        "Q: And Olga?",
        "A: Olga was married to a man named Ulmacher who was the father of those children.\nMy cousins. And he she said he had to stay back and take care of her parents. As the\noldest. And as I said, my grandfather probably had early signs of cancer at that time. she\nstayed back, sent her children to England.",
        "Q: So Herta was the one who was the au pair?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And what about her father? So what happened to Mr. Ulmacher\u2019?",
        "A: He wound up in South America. In Caracas.",
        "Q: After the war, before the war?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know when he got to Caracas but he had a whole new life in Caracas.",
        "Q: But Olga stayed with her mother?",
        "A: Olga stayed with her mother and I\u2019ve always thought that the two of them stayed\ntogether and went, were sent to Theresienstadt together. And from there to Auschwitz.\nBut I understand they were separated. And, they went to Auschwitz at two different\ntimes.",
        "Q: Is that, no trace then after that?",
        "A: No. No. And after the war my mother sent for Annie to come to the United States.",
        "Q: And did she?",
        "A: And she came to New York, yes she came to live with us for a short time. But and\nthen she went off on her own and went to the cafes as she always did in Vienna and\ncontinued playing cards in the cafes. At one time she was playing cards, she said I have a\nterrible headache, fell over. She had had a massive brain hemorrhage and died. Shortly\nafter she came \u2014",

We walked together\nat the end of the day and there were other mothers standing outside and jeering and\nyelling about the Jewish children so [waves hand] I don\u2019t know what they were. But they\nit was horrible. And these were mothers, jeering at the Jewish children coming out of\nschool. They had separated the, you couldn\u2019t go to a regular school. They were now into\nJewish schools.",
        "Q: So this was jeering in front of the Jewish school?",
        "A: Probably, yeah. that\u2019s where she went. And so pretty soon she didn\u2019t continue going\nto school.",

        "A: I don\u2019t\u2019 think he did it on a regular basis. I think he went to sort of clear things out.\nTo settle things.",
        "Q: And it\u2019s during this time that your mother finds out something, sees this ad.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: And what happens then?",
        "A: Well she inquired about it. And she said count me in. Take my girls, take my girls to\nAmerica. And the hope was that when my father\u2019s family saw how desperate they were,\nby sending the girls away alone, that they would send the visa for her, which indeed 1s\nwhat happened. She, they did send the visa. They saw that we were, did not have horns,\nthat we were normal healthy girls and my sister\u2019s job was to beg them to send that last\nvisa for my mother.",
        "Q: Oh my gosh, what a \u2014",

        "Q: In what ways would you say your sister didn\u2019t\u2019 get over it? How did it show itself?",
        "A: I think she always felt that she had extra responsibility and that I got a free pass,\nwhich there is some truth to that.",

        "A: Exactly, exactly.",
        "Q: But it is a huge, you know had it not worked and it would never have been anything of\nyour sister\u2019s fault because she\u2019s a child, the kind of burden that was on her should she\nfail, is huge. So do you remember saying goodby to your mother? And your father?",
        "A: I remember the fight when my father came home yelling and screaming and carrying\non. What have you done? You must be crazy, insane to send your children away. But he\nalready had the visa and he already was secure. And she was desperate, absolutely\ndesperate. This was her last chance and our last chance.\nQ: And she was right.",
        "A: Absolutely. She was very wise, she was very wise, intuitively wise. So she said \u2014",
        "Q: So they came to terms and she put her foot down, right?",
        "A: She said they\u2019re going. And she made all the arrangements for my father and his\nmother and his brother to travel to America.",
        "Q: How bitter that is though.",
        "A: It\u2019s what she did.",

        "Q: Do you remember having gone to a US consulate to get paperwork, to get medical\nexams. Do you remember anything of the process?",
        "A: I remember being interviewed. And I remember you know what I thought were sort of\nsilly questions. Would you make a window out of wood or would you make it out of\nglass? Being a carpenter\u2019s daughter, I had a hint on that. You know stuff like that and,\nand maybe a Rorschach test. And physical exam. But that was the question that I\nremember. And I was a very charming kid. I was cute. And so they said yeah she\u2019s just\non the border of the right age. Just on the border.",

        "A: I think his name was Shless.",
        "Q: Shless, excuse me. We talked about the heaviness of the air. And what it was due to.\nNow you\u2019re very little. Did you know what being Jewish meant?",
        "A: well I knew it was a burden. Because I remember walking down the street with my\nfather one time. And we were I think we were going to the bakery. And this man in\nuniform came up and as I said I was a cute kid. Came up and he said, started talking to\nme. And he said are you Catholische. Ist du Catholische? And I said no, I\u2019m Polish.",

        "A: No. I remember. The train stopped in Berlin and subsequently. I mean I knew we were\nin Berlin. I didn\u2019t know why we were there. Apparently we were there to get the last exit\npapers. And if we hadn\u2019t gotten those we would have had to turn around and go back\nhome. So we were at this Jewish c, some kind of Jewish organization or building. And\nthey, my sister and I were in bunk beds. And there was a big to do downstairs in the\nstreet. Marching and music and parade and, and so my sister jumped down from her\nupper bunk and came into my bed. And then we peaked out the window and we thought it\nwas Hitler. And we watched and saw this you know all this uniforms and flags and it\nwas very frightening. It turned out it was a kind of the solidifying the relationship\nbetween Germany and Italy. Von Ribbentrop was representing the German Reich and\nMussolini\u2019s son in law, Chiano , was representing the Italians and this was their\nallegiance, their alliance being cemented in with great pomp. As we watched it.",
        "Q: How did you trace that back because as a five year old you wouldn\u2019t know.",
        "A: No, I thought it was Hitler from all the pomp that was happening and the marching\nand the uniforms and the flags. Subsequently from Pressman, Steven Pressman\u2019s book\nand his research filled in the details.",
        "Q: Isn\u2019t it interesting when you see dots that connect things that you yourself have seen.",
        "A: It was wonderful to fill in the spaces because I just had a generalized impression of\nwhat was going on.",

        "Q: Chaos.",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "Q: Or were you very well behaved children?",
        "A: We were very well behaved children but we were curious. And we ran all over that\nship, my sister and I.",
        "Q: Oh you\u2019re talking about the ship now.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I\u2019m still on the train.",
        "A: Oh sorry.",
        "Q: That\u2019s ok. On the train you know I guess I\u2019m wondering when you said goodby to the\ntwo adults that you know, your parents, is there somebody that you remember who kind\nof takes over or now adults are kind of foggy, hazy.",
        "A: We were on our own and my mother said you are going to have a wonderful time.",
        "Q: And you believed it.",
        "A: I totally believed her and I made sure that I did. So you know I made you know I was\ncurious. I looked around. I had my sister. And I was out for adventure.",
        "Q: Oh how wonderful. And she put that security blanket around you and \u2014",
        "A: She did. She said you\u2019re going to have a great time.",
        "Q: Do you remember anything else from that train ride?",
        "A: I don\u2019t\u2019 remember eating. I don\u2019t remember sleeping. I don\u2019t remember any of that.",
        "Q: And now you are on the ship. Do you remember what the ship looked like.",
        "A: Big. It was a big ship. With a very loud horn. And, and we took off and we went\nfrom Hamburg to Southampton, England and then we went across the ocean.",
        "Q: Were there other passengers, not part of this group of children.",
        "A: There must have been.",
        "Q: I wanted to get a sense of the ship life. Were there people on there who weren\u2019t part of\nthe group of children. Was it like a regular passenger liner.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure it was. But I am not aware of, I don\u2019t know whether we had a separate dining\nroom. Or they you know they kind of kept us together as best they could.",
        "Q: Do you remember being sea sick\u2019?",
        "A: No. No.",
        "Q: This is the part where I kind of interrupted you before when we train ship, train ship.\nSo what did you guys do on the ship?",
        "A: We ran around. We ran up and down the stairs and we ran up the decks and we\nexplored and we found first class playroom with fabulous rocking horses and FAO\nSchwarz toys. I mean we weren\u2019t supposed to be there. But there were no other children\nthere at the time. so maybe there were no other children on the ship besides these. And\nso we availed ourselves of that fabulous playroom. And as far as I remember, we did not\nlike the food. It was not familiar. But we did find a barrel of apples and we ate those.",
        "Q: You remember this?",
        "A: Iremember yes, stealing apples. And but I don\u2019t\u2019 remember sitting at a table. Or\nanything like that. I just remember being totally free. I mean we could have fallen\noverboard. Not even made a splash.",
        "Q: And every once in a while the two nurses in white would be kind of seen around.",
        "A: Seen, especially if, for taking pictures, photographs. Documentation. But I can\u2019t\nremember seeing them. I don\u2019t\u2019 remember what our bunk was like. I \u2014",
        "Q: do you remember playing with other kids?",
        "A: Just my sister. We were \u2014",
        "Q: How was Inge doing? You know the older you were the less that security blanket can\nwork.",
        "A: Well again she had a heavy responsibility to keep track of me which was probably\nquite a job. But she went along with me. We had fun. And I don\u2019t\u2019 remember being sea\nsick. I don\u2019t remember, I remember taking a bath in salt water. It, it the water, even the\nhot water was sourced from the ocean. And it had a particular smell.",
        "Q: Bad or good?",
        "A: Different, just different and many years later when I was in Atlantic City, lo and\nbehold the bathtub water was salt water. And it had a particular odor.",
        "Q: And that brought you back.",
        "A: Yes. And that was, 25 years later.",
        "Q: When you were on the ship with the Krauses, did you know who they were in your\nlife? Did you know of their role?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did they talk to you at all?",
        "A: I don\u2019t\u2019 re, they didn\u2019t speak German. They did not speak German. And we did not\nspeak English. We were on our own. Make sense of it as best you can.",
        "Q: Did the children talk amongst themselves about why you had all left?",
        "A: Not that I know of.",
        "Q: Well you were little, I know you were little.",
        "A: Yeah, right. 1t was many years later but there was a reunion, the so called children.\nAnd. There was a reunion and people got up and talked about their memories. And the\nmen had total amnesia. They did not remember the trip at all. And there were several\nwho had no memory of their transport or anything like that. It\u2019s just and memory picked\nup again when they were on land in Philadelphia.",
        "Q: How sad.",
        "A: Amnesia and it was probably a safety mechanism. It was too traumatic. It was too\ntraumatic for several of them so they blocked it out.",
        "Q: But it wasn\u2019t for you.",
        "A: Well I have very you know just smatterings of memory but I remember being happy.\nSunshine and freedom and I, I was good to go.",
        "Q: I mean that was one of the biggest aufca, one of the biggest sort of efforts that parents\nmade to protect their children from what\u2019s going on.",
        "A: Definitely.",
        "Q: To protect them emotionally and some succeeded because of a confluence of factors,\nsometimes they had no control over. And sometimes they did. I mean you were littler.\nThat helps.",
        "A: I think so.",
        "Q: And sometimes they didn\u2019t succeed. Sometimes the children\u2014",
        "A: It\u2019s trauma.",
        "Q: What do you remember next, while you are on this boat and you\u2019re having a good\ntime. You\u2019re with your sister, whose job is to make sure you\u2019re ok. And participate in\nsome of these adventures. What happens after that.",
        "A: Then we got to Ellis Island. And my aunt met us.",
        "Q: This aunt that you didn\u2019t know.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: I think her name was Fraicha.",
        "Q: Fraicha.",
        "A: Fraicha.",
        "Q: Is that the last name?",
        "A: No that\u2019s her first name.",
        "Q: Fraicha. I didn\u2019t know that name. What\u2019s her last name? Tante Fraicha.",
        "A: Right. Weiss if she was not married. Weiss. And she\u2019s a young woman. She\u2019s pretty\nand, and she wore a fashionable hat. And she came to meet us and that\u2019s when my sister\ndelivered her message.",
        "Q: Oh she had held it in all this time.",
        "A: You\u2019ve got to send that visa, you\u2019ve got to send the papers.",
        "Q: There on Ellis Island.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: The first thing she does when she gets off the boat.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And do you remember how Fraicha reacted?",
        "A: she was very friendly. She was very pleasant and I guess she took it to heart. Now\nyou know there\u2019s no telephone. I could not write. I don\u2019t know how soon thereafter the\nvisa was sent. But she got the message. She relayed it to the family in Brooklyn and\nthey sent the visa for my mother.",
        "Q: Now when you get to Ellis Island did she take you home?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: What happened with you girls?",
        "A: Well the group stayed together and I don\u2019t know how, I guess we took a bus or\nsomething, put bus, put us on a bus. We went to Philadelphia where the Jewish\norganization had a summer camp. Today I would call it like a motel and it was all on one\nfloor. And we had our separate rooms. And there was an attempt to teach us English and\nbaseball and stuff like that. And we played hopscotch and games and looked at the\ncomics and just had summer. Played outdoors and rallied round the flag to pledge\nallegiance which we were taught. And it was just nice. It was pleasant.",
        "Q: Did anything strike you as impressive when you first came to the United States?\nDifferent from what you were, you were thinking. How the place looked, how people\ntalked, how the food tasted. Anything in your mind\u2019s eye?",
        "A: No, I was receptive to it all. You know it was all new and it was ok. I didn\u2019t\u2019 have\nany great expectations or disappointments you know. A lot of the members of this Jewish\norganization the Brith Shalom of Philadelphia took an interest in the children and came to\nvisit us. And they brought you know they were business people. Some brought hats that\nthey had in their shop. Or they brought cakes. They, they befriended us and visited us.\nAnd I made particular friends with somebody who had the ability to throw his voice. He\nwas like a ventriloquist. And I just thought that was the most fabulous talent and we just\nhad a great time together.",
        "Q: So this is one of the visitors.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: He kept you entertained.",
        "A: He did, he did and he came you know regularly more than once. And I don\u2019t know\nwhether he thought he would adopt us or what.",
        "Q: How was Inge doing? Now that her mission was accomplished.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t talk about it. She just \u2014",
        "Q: Was she as carefree as you were?",
        "A: Probably not. Probably not.",
        "Q: In general was she a serious personality?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes.",
        "Q: I put words, how would you describe her personality?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think she ever got out from under that cloud of responsibility. And she just\nhad very different interests. And I was successful in ways that she was not. And that was\nhard. That was hard for her because she felt that she had blazed the trail and that I had an\neasy time.",
        "Q: You said that before.",
        "A: So for instance I, I mean we both did well at school and stuff and, and skipped you\nknow the New York City school system if you did well, they didn\u2019t know what to do with\nyou. There was no such thing as enrichment. They just pushed you ahead so that you\nwere in the next class. And so they pushed us both ahead and we had some of the same\nteachers and, and that sort of thing. And then I tried out for a special high school in New\nYork. Now she had\u2014",
        "Q: What high school?",
        "A: High school of music and art. She had tried out for that school (bells ringing).",
        "A: You don\u2019t want to continue where we were.",
        "Q: We will, but no I won\u2019t. Ok. we had a break now and before going back to the point\nwhere we had our break. I wanted to ask a question that I hadn\u2019t before. And that is your\nearliest memories total.",
        "A: Well the very earliest memory is of a curtain in probably in the nursery which sort of\nwe, they were casement windows, which means that they rolled out. And when the\nbreeze came in, it would lift this curtain which was very airy and lightweight. And it\nwould lift this curtain up and I just thought of a giant outside the window breathing in\nand out because the curtain would rise up and then fall. It would rise up and fall. And I\nremember the fabric so distinctly. It was pale sort of a pea green with white leaves ovoid\nleaves scattered throughout the curtain. And there was a heavy thread running the warp\nof the fabric to make it hang right. And if I ever ran into that I would know that fabric in\na minute.",
        "Q: Isn\u2019t that amazing.",
        "A: And that was, it was the very earliest memory that I had.",
        "Q: The logic of a child.",
        "A: The giant.",
        "Q: A giant you know. how could a curtain move like that.",
        "A: Right. repetition, you know in and out, in and out. And we were on the second floor\nso it had to be a giant.",
        "Q: So are we talking second floor American or second floor European.",
        "A: Vienna.",
        "Q: So it would be the third floor in the United States because there\u2019s the adgeschloss and\nthen there is the first floor and then there 1s the second floor. that\u2019s the way it is in\nEurope. So if it was the second floor from what you remember from Europe then it\nwould be the US Third floor.",
        "A: there was a courtyard in the center of the house. Now these houses were very old. So\nthe courtyard was probably at one time where carriages would enter this large gate of this\nentrance and then there would be this courtyard and then these wide curved stairs, going\nupstairs.",
        "Q: And did your house have windows going onto the street or into the courtyard as well?",
        "A: Yes. Both.",
        "Q: Both. Was it a house that was of stone or brick or \u2014",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure. I don\u2019t know what the construction was, but it maybe had five floors,\nfive stories high.",
        "Q: Put up probably wood. ok so let\u2019s go back to the camp that you were in outside\nPhiladelphia, that first summer when you were here. And you make a new friend who\nknows how to throw his voice, the ventriloquist. And the only time you saw your relative,\nher name was Aunt Fraicha, --",
        "A: Fraicha.",
        "Q: Fraicha is when she greets you at the boat.",
        "A: At Ellis Island.",
        "Q: At Ellis Island and your sister delivers her message and you two go off to camp. What\nhappened after the summer was over?",
        "A: Well my mother had made all the arrangements for my father, his mother and his\nbrother to travel to the, to America. And so since her visa arrived in time, she was simply\nadded to his cabin.",
        "Q: So she did arrive and she was able to travel with him.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t know this at the time though.",
        "A: No we did not. I mean I wasn\u2019t in touch with her. The letters you know went back\nand forth would take weeks and no telephone and nothing like that. No Twitter. No\nSkype. So we didn\u2019t know anything.",
        "Q: All of this is going on but you don\u2019t know it. You and your sister are unaware.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And when the summer ends what happens with you two.",
        "A: Well my parents arrived at the end of August, 1939. We had been at the camp since\nthe beginning of June when we arrived. And so they arrived and \u2014",
        "Q: They picked you up.",
        "A: They picked us up. And somehow we got to Brooklyn where the family had set up an\napartment sort of like a, like a railroad flat. All the rooms were in line. And, and we\nsettled in. and war broke out officially September 1.",
        "Q: I mean they got in by a hair\u2019s breadth.",
        "A: By a hair. And so September comes around and we start school. Not speaking English\nand my mother described us walking to the school weeping because we couldn\u2019t\nunderstand and couldn\u2019t speak. But the teacher spoke Yiddish and so she said don\u2019t\nworry. I\u2019ll take care of them. And you know within weeks we were speaking English.",
        "Q: Of course, but the beginning 1s difficult.",
        "A: Yeah the very, the very start was hard. But people were friendly. It wasn\u2019t like it was\nin Austria. It wasn\u2019t that way. There was nobody jeering and throwing things at us. And\nSo we Started school and you know learned English, fit right in.",
        "Q: Cool, very cool.",
        "A: Yeah it was like a magical age you know. [gestures idea of \u201cmargin\u201d\u2019| Just that little\nmargin of adaptability.",
        "Q: And also being shielded and protected from the larger events and the reasons for them.",
        "A: Right, well of course that was all that my parents talked about was what was\nhappening in Europe and my mother had her family there. And received letters\nperiodically that had big pieces censored out [gestures \u201ccensored pieces\u2019\u2019|, black marks\ncut. And so she pieced it together that her father was dying of cancer. And, and pretty\nsoon those letters stopped.",
        "Q: Did your father ever say to your mother you were right. I was wrong.",
        "A: Not that I know of. No. But they were very, very happy. And then we were at some\nkind of family gathering and I don\u2019t re, family was talking and they asked my\ngrandmother something about how her life was in Europe. Oh, she said it was terrible,\nterrible. And it was she never got anything, she never had anything and so my father said\nwell who bought your shoes. And who paid your passage. And he was just he was\nhumiliated in front of these strangers who were family. I don\u2019t know what her motivation\nwas. Maybe she was just stupid. You know she could have been stupid. Or she you\nknow this was before social security and things like that. Maybe she thought that she\nwould do better by throwing herself on these relatives. And my father was just more than\nincensed.",
        "Q: I can imagine.",
        "A: And that was the end of that. And he took a job in the Bronx and we moved to the\nBronx which was like you know\u2014",
        "Q: Another world.",
        "A: Another world. Different.",
        "Q: Where in Brooklyn had you had this flat? Do you remember?",
        "A: I do not.",
        "Q: Do you remember where the rest of the family lived in Brooklyn, what part of it?",
        "A: No. They had a house and a garden. And I believe this uncle I don\u2019t remember what\nhis, what his business was. He was elderly. He had a parrot, I remember that. And he\nused to cut the parrot\u2019s toenails, claws, yes. But he broke off.",
        "Q: So it was through his mother actually, more than the rest of the siblings that this kind\nof absolute unawareness of what his sacrifice had been.",
        "A: Mm hm.",
        "Q: And when you moved to the Bronx, when was that?",
        "A: I think I was in about third grade. I remember--",
        "Q: So you had been here a few years.",
        "A: Possibly yeah. A year or two, yeah. And I remember third grade in the Bronx. Miss\nBullock.",
        "Q: It\u2019s funny how we remember our grade school teachers.",
        "A: Unh hunh.",
        "Q: And your father, how did he make a living?",
        "A: He was a carpenter.",
        "Q: His own. Or did he work for somebody.",
        "A: Well he worked for somebody and then he lost patience completely and set up\npractically next door. In the Bronx. And so he had an apartment first. And then my\nmother noticed, she would walk from the apartment, two blocks around the corner to his\nshop. And one day she was walking by and people were moving furniture out of one of\nthe houses. And so she inquired and it turned out an old lady had lived there and died.\nAnd she, well you know can I buy this house. And I don\u2019t know. They said something\nridiculous, but $5000 and it\u2019s yours. And she went to the bank without my father\u2019s\nknowledge, plunked down $5000 and the house was ours. So here was the second time\nthat she acted totally on her own and it was wonderful. It was wonderful. It was \u2014",
        "Q: Did he give her any grief for that?",
        "A: No. No, that was a good thing. It was a brick house, three stories. Fabulous\nwoodwork, oak paneling and molding and stairs and it was a godsend \u2014",
        "Q: Had a middle class life. A nice middle class life.",
        "A: Absolutely, absolutely. It had a porch. I have a picture. I'll show it to you, of this\nhouse. It was, it was something special.",
        "Q: And your father\u2019s workshop was right\u2014",
        "A: Around the corner, like two blocks away.",
        "Q: And did he own his workshop or did he rent it?",
        "A: No, he rented the space. Yes. And originally it had an apartment behind it and he\nthought that maybe we should move there. And my mother said oh no. She\u2019s not going\nto raise her f, her children, her girls, in this situation.",
        "Q: There is a benefit to having Viennese standards. You know.",
        "A: Definitely [nods head] yeah.",
        "Q: Did she also work when she came, work for pay, when she came--.",
        "A: No never. She worked in my father\u2019s shop. When he went out to install things and he\ndid store fronts and fixtures. Very often for immigrants, refugees who established their\nown businesses and he would make their showcases and their store fronts. And if he was\nout of the shop, somebody had to mind the store. So she stayed at the store. While he was\nout.",
        "Q: That really does sound like an amazing, I don\u2019t want to say easy but so much easier\nthan someone who doesn\u2019t have that skill.",
        "A: Oh of course. I know people who were lawyers and whose skills did not transfer. And\npeople when family a doctor, he spent you know he had to go back to school and do you\nknow make up some coursework or something in order to get licensed here. And were\nfurriers and shop people.",
        "Q: What language, when you were now in the Bronx. What language did you speak at\nhome.",
        "A: German.",
        "Q: Still.",
        "A: Yes. We would come home for lunch. It was quite a, quite a walk. Go to school.\nSpeak English. Come home for lunch. Go back to school, come back home. So yeah we\nspoke German at home and we spoke English in the world.",
        "Q: Very much an immigrant kind of experience.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes. My mother was very eager to learn English and she went to classes and\nbecame a citizen. My father became a citizen too.",
        "Q: When?",
        "A: As soon as they could.",
        "Q: So within the 40s.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Sometime in the 40s.",
        "A: Definitely. I think even before the end of the war.",
        "Q: And what about you and your sister?",
        "A: I think I have my own papers, yes. And my \u2014",
        "Q: Do you remember becoming a citizen too, a US citizen?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: You remember the actual experience?",
        "A: They just asked some you know historical questions and things like that.",
        "Q: Did your parents, you mentioned in the beginning that they were trying to keep track\nof what was going on in Europe.",
        "A: Definitely.",
        "Q: And did that continue?",
        "A: Yes. Yes. Oh my father railed, railed against government in Germany. He, he gave up\nbeing Jewish completely. He never we never had a kosher house again. We, he never\nwent to temple. My mother did. Once in a while, for holidays. And Yom Kippur and\nRosh Hashanah. He said there was no god if this could happen and ne just turned his back\non the whole thing.",
        "Q: Wow. Because so many other people had the reverse thing. They did not particularly\nfeel themselves to be Jewish and then when they were targeted said all right now. I\u2019m not\ngoing to pretend to be someone I\u2019m not. Did that seem strange to you at the time or is just\nthat\u2019s his choice and that\u2019s her choice.",
        "A: Definitely. It was\u2014",
        "Q: What about you and your sister?",
        "A: My sister felt more connected to, to her Jewish heritage. She when they were in\nFlorida, she participated at a temple. I never have. And her daughter also seems more\nconnected to the Jewish heritage and not that she keeps a kosher home but she you know\nshe\u2019s connected to the community. And I\u2019m not.",
        "Q: Was this a conscious thing or is the way you developed in your interests and how they\nerew?",
        "A: Well I\u2019m an atheist and I just from my experience and my reading I have come to that\nconclusion. If anything, I\u2019d be a Buddhist.",
        "Q: Did your parents eventually find out what happened to various family members?",
        "A: They did. They I mean some people just disappeared like Tager. And I think one of\nmy father\u2019s brothers just disappeared like a blown leaf. We did know that my grandfather\npassed. And we knew that Olga and her mother, my grandmother, were pushed from one\napartment to another. I always thought that they were together, but I subsequently learned\nthat they also were separated.",
        "Q: How did you discover this?",
        "A: A friend, a cousin of my ex-husband 1s very savvy on the internet and she puzzled it\nout.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s a recent knowledge.",
        "A: Yes, yes. I always had a little fantasy that somehow they went off to the Vienna\nwoods and hid. And survived.",
        "Q: As you were growing up, tell me a little bit about school, about high school, about\nhow did your life develop.",
        "A: Well I enjoyed school. I had friends in school. I applied to the high school of music\nand art which was a special high school that you auditioned for in New York. And I\nprepared a portfolio and auditioned and was accepted. And that was probably the biggest\nlearning experience.",
        "Q: Was it really?",
        "A: Yes, cause I was with a wide variety of people, very diverse student body from all\nover the city. Some very well-heeled people, some people who were very political. There\nwas one gal whose father was a died and hard communist. There were people of color\nwhich was unusual. That wouldn\u2019t\u2019 have been in the neighborhood school. There was a\nChinese girl that I was very friendly with, Gloria Wong. And when the communists took\nover in China, I hadn\u2019t a clue. I said well what do you think? And she said I think it\u2019s\ngoing to be a better thing for China. This was the era of the Rosenberg trials. And it was\nvery, it was still very conflicted. It was still very, the world was coming to my awareness.",
        "Q: That\u2019s normal when you\u2019re in high school. That\u2019s what happens you know.",
        "A: But I was so happy at that school. I just, I just blossomed. I couldn\u2019t wait for\nsummer vacation to end and go back to high school, which is not your typical high school\nexperience.",
        "Q: No it isn\u2019t.",
        "A: But I was very lucky. Yeah. and I still have friends from high school. Yes. And then\nwhen I went off to college, it was a total disappointment. It was not as stimulating as high\nschool.",
        "Q: Where did you go to college?",
        "A: Well I started out at Brooklyn College. Which was free. The city colleges of New\nYork, I mean totally unbeknownst to anybody today were free. Just like high school and\nso I would meet my friends on the subway. There was quite a little contingent that went\nfrom the Bronx to Brooklyn. Brooklyn College, because they had a very interesting art\ndepartment. And but of course you know it was a liberal arts school and so I had classics\nand I had history and I had language and yeah.",
        "Q: But it wasn\u2019t as stimulating.",
        "A: No, it was not. It was a come down. We had artists. I mean it was sort of like a carry-\nover from the WPA projects where they hired artists in the art department to teach. So I\nhad Mark Rothko as a teacher. The poor man could not put two words together. He was\na wonderful artist but he was not a teacher. I had Clyfford Still and William Bazeotis and\nall these fabulous names today. They were struggling artists at the time. Anyway they\nwere not good teachers. And so I decided that and I really wanted to know about art. I\nwanted to know the background and so I was interested in art history. And Barnard\nCollege at that time was investing heavily in their art history department. And I was told\nto apply and I did and I got in and so I have a degree from Barnard College which is\nprestigious.",
        "Q: A question. You mentioned the different languages when you were at home at lunch\ntime and going back to school. Did that every change. Did you ever end up speaking\nEnglish at home?",
        "A: I think, I think yes. As the years went by. They understood. My parents understood\nmore than they could speak. My mother was pretty proficient but my father there, never,\nI mean he spoke Yiddish.",
        "Q: Did he speak any other language besides German and Yiddish. Did he speak Polish,\ndid he speak Russian, did he speak\u2014",
        "A: He just had a few phrases and he even had what, he had an English phrase like son of\na bitch. Somebody when he was a kid had come back and taught him son of a bitch and\nhe used that.",
        "Q: He knew that from then.",
        "A: Yes he knew that from Knihynicze.",
        "Q: Isn\u2019t that funny. Did you ever feel like you were an outsider when you were in the\nUnited States.",
        "A: [shakes head \u201cno\u201d| No.",
        "Q: So there was no sense of I don\u2019t really belong to this society. I\u2019m from over\nsomewhere else.",
        "A: Never. [shakes head \u201cno\u2019\u2019| Not in New York, not in Connecticut, not in Maine. No, I\njust it\u2019s where I\u2019m at.",
        "Q: Did you ever think of Vienna.",
        "A: I\u2019ve gone back to visit.",
        "Q: I want to come to that point about returning to your story. You mentioned that you are\nwriting your memotrs.",
        "A: Mm hm.",
        "Q: what prompted you to look back and when did you start looking back?",
        "A: I think ve always been sort of an introspective person. And I realized that my\ngrandchildren who are not near and have not been close to me or I to them. Cause they\u2019ve\nalways grown away, grown up away from me.",
        "Q: You mean geographically distant?",
        "A: Yes. But you know geographic distance also means emotional distance. And\nknowledge and knowing somebody. So I thought that I would clue them and help them\nout to know me a little better.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s what\u2019s prompted the memoirs?",
        "A: Correct, correct.",
        "Q: How far along have you gotten?",
        "A: Well I can\u2019t say it\u2019s a thing that goes chronologically from here to there. It\u2019s a series\nof stories. Of things that happened. Of things that I\u2019ve thought about. And we\u2019ll put\nthem together in some kind of a scrapbook and that\u2019!1 be it.",
        "Q: Those are the kinds, the most precious gifts now.",
        "A: [hope so, I hope so.",
        "Q: When did you first go back to Vienna?",
        "A: My sister has gone back several times. And then one time, we went together. And we\nwent with my niece also, Tina, her daughter. And well my sister had some money there.\nAnd she filed for social security basically where she paid into the system and then\naccumulated money out of the system, which, which was effective if she spent the money\nthere. In Europe. And so she was motivated to use that money. I never bothered to pay\ninto the system. I don\u2019t care about it and I don\u2019t want it. And she planned to live to be a\nhundred so she would use it all. That didn\u2019t quite work that way. So we went back hm,\nI\u2019m trying to think of when. In the 90s. And maybe 92 or so. And we went to\nRohdenstern Gasse. And we went to the Prater and we went to the Vienna woods and\nwe went to the opera. And then Pat and I, my partner, went to Vienna also as part of a trip\nthat included Budapest and Prague. And I don\u2019t like Vienna. I find it stuffy, baroque and\nfalse, pretentious. I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t like it at all.",
        "Q: Is there anything that was familiar or did you, when you went you felt like you were\nkind of to a place you had never been before?",
        "A: No, I was tourist, I was a tourist. I had my eyes open and I was curious and we went\nto Salzburg, went to a play there. It turned out to be a play about an old age home and\nmy sister said oh, why do we want to go to see that. Cause it interests me. I didn\u2019t get all\nthe nuances of the language but I got enough of it. But it was interesting, it was\ninteresting. We went to performances and I thought that they were just stuffy. They were\nfor tourists. There was nothing with heart. We went to Bratislava which was just recently\nliberated from Russian domination and we went to the opera. And they were, they could\nhave been bus drivers. It just had, they were just doing a job. You know they had no\nheart. They had no emotion in to the part. It was just a businessman\u2019s opera. It was, it\nwas nothing. It was just nothing.",
        "Q: What a disappointment.",
        "A: Yeah, cause my parents loved opera. And we went to the opera in New York. We\nwent to the City Center and we went to the Met.",
        "Q: You have mentioned off camera that in 1998 I believe it was you went to Auschwitz.",
        "A: I did.",
        "Q: Tell me about that trip and what that was all about.",
        "A: Well it\u2019s something called the March of the Living. And apparently, well it\u2019s a\nJewish organization that tries to get young people to understand the Holocaust and their\nheritage first hand. So they were mostly young people, but there were some survivors.\nAnd we were on a bus. And I made friends with several people. One of whom, Sophia\nAfariat was spent the war years in Poland. And she spoke fluent Polish so she had the\nadvantage of language. And we went to restaurants and things like that and she could\nspeak fluently with people. We went to Krakow. We went to Warsaw. And went to\nsome of the stations that Jews were assembled. We went to the ghetto. It was the first\ntime that I was with very devout Jews. The young people were devout. They prayed, on\nthe airplane. So that was the first. And then we went to Israel. (pause, something\nhappening off camera) We have to stop every time that door opens and closes.",
        "Q: What are the most memorable moments for you of that trip.",
        "A: For the trip. Well seeing Krakow which my father had spoken of was a high point. I\nthought that well, um, Warsaw was just a gray depressing place. We had a bus that took\nus from one place to another. We had guards on the bus. We had a Polish soldier who\nwas on leave earning extra money, accompanying us on the bus.",
        "Q: And the purpose of his presence?",
        "A: Well there\u2019s a lot of anti-Semitism, a lot of anti-Semitism. We went to a little village I\ndon\u2019t even know that it had a name. But it was a typical village, shtetl, town. The Jewish\nsynagogue, and there were no more Jews living there but it somehow, I don\u2019t know who\ntook care of it. So the synagogue had, was neatly tended. And the church was on the top\nof the hill. So the church was on the hill. And the synagogue was down here. [gestures\nlocation of church and synagogue| There was a contingent of Polish soldiers, with a tank\nstationed at the synagogue. They were playing cards. But there was a military presence.\nWe passed houses that were very derelict that probably had not been lived in for a\nnumber of years. We passed another place that was like a farm where they were very neat\nand tidy. They had cranes nesting in this chimney. I\u2019d never seen anything like that and\nthat was a tidy farm. So you know if the people who had the place could take care of it,\nhad the wherewithal to take care of it, had the energy and the skill and maybe some\nmoney to take care of it, they did well. If the people were old, poor, the place was\nderelict.",
        "Q: So you saw these types of things\u2014",
        "A: I saw that yes. This lady Sophia, who had spent the war. She was able to talk to our\nguard and sort of befriend him and find out who he was. And that\u2019s how I know that he\nwas on furlough and stuff like that. We went to a place in Krakow that was sort of a folk\nart place. And I wanted to buy something for my grandchild who was little at the time.\nMy first grandchild. And so we bought something there. And I brought it to the hotel,\nopened it up and it had shattered into you know 42 pieces. So the next day we went back\nand I said well you know this, you packed it poorly. I need something else. And oh, no.\nNo they wouldn\u2019t, they wouldn\u2019t\u2019 honor that and so Sophia said we are Jews. And she\nplayed the Jew card. I was so embarrassed. I was so embarrassed that she felt it necessary\nto draw that card. And he said ok, pick out something else. We went to a Jewish\ncemetery and there was this little old lady scuttling through the cemetery. And Sophia\nstarted talking to her. And she had spent the war. She was Jewish. She had spent the war\nthere. She, she had no prospects of going anywhere else.",
        "Q: The lady in the cemetery?",
        "A: Yes. And that was her life. I don\u2019t know, I think she was doing a short cut through\nthe cemetery to her home. Yeah. And she lived in that town with her daughter.",
        "Q: Did you feel in some way distant from these things or close to these things?",
        "A: No, I felt close to that, I did. It was very emotional. And when we went to Auschwitz\nthere were graffiti, anti-Semitic graffiti on the walls outside of Auschwitz, just outside.\nThey do keep the grounds themselves preserved. But it was very emotional. And so I left\na note saying you know but for fortunate kindness in this world, I would be here too.\n[shrugs shoulders |",
        "Q: Have you gone to any other of these\u2014",
        "A: Well that was part of the trip. We went to Sobibor and we went yeah, the whole, yep.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back a little bit. To when you finished Barnard college. How did your life\nevolve after that?",
        "A: Well I got married. And that made me very happy. He was a wonderful young man.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Eugene. He had a very supportive family. My family loved him so all was good. It\nwas good.",
        "Q: How many children do you have?",
        "A: Two sons. One lives in Ann Arbor, Michigan with two daughters who are now going\nto live on the east coast, one of whom 1s a graduate student at Harvard. And the other\nOne is just a graduate out of the college at Wooster, Ohio. I have a son now in LA, who\nhad two children, one of whom is in Providence, Rhode Island at Brown University. And\nthe daughter is a high school graduate, graduated, senior and she plans to go into musical\ntheater. She\u2019s very, very talented.",
        "Q: Have you talked about these things with them? About your childhood, about your\nescape? With your children, with your grandchildren?",
        "A: A little bit. Well they\u2019ve seen the, they\u2019 ve seen video of the 50 children that Steven\nPressman made. They have the book. They have very casual interest in it all.",
        "Q: How do you think it shaped you? Did it shape you? Did it contribute to you being the\nkind of person that you are today?",
        "A: Oh, completely.",
        "Q: In what way\u2019?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. If I had remained in Austria, and there had been no war, I would be a\nGerman hausfrau.",
        "Q: Artist?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I think that women still have a very tangential life there. I think it\u2019s still\nvery patriarchal. I think there is still some anti-Semitism that keeps people from\ndreaming and thinking that they could be something more. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have the\neducation that I have. I\u2019d be somebody else.",
        "Q: In your personality, has it had an effect on things that are your values or the way you\nlook at things, that early history.",
        "A: Well I think my mother\u2019s message that I\u2019m going to have a wonderful time and to be\nOpen to new experience has been my way of doing things.",
        "Q: What a wonderful gift.",
        "A: I know.",
        "Q: Tell me about how the rest of their years were here in the United States.",
        "A: My, when my sister hit adolescence my father lost it. He, he wanted to impose kind\nof the old protection. He did not understand that girls have you know rights and thoughts\nof their own. He made life very hard for her. Constant bickering and constant picking on\nher, constant demeaning. He did not understand that she wanted to wear something that\nhe didn\u2019t\u2019 approve of. Lipstick drove him up the wall. And, and she, she was destroyed.\nAnd my mother could not stop him. I don\u2019t know what he had in mind. Loose women\nyou know wear lipstick and he just, he just had a totally, totally other way of looking at a\nyoung woman.",
        "Q: It sounds almost like a village he came through.",
        "A: Exactly. Don\u2019t be this and don\u2019t be that and be careful here [gestures with hand] and\nbe careful there and he just made her life miserable. Somehow I did not get it into his\ncraw the way she did. That was something deep set him off. I did not buck him. I put on\nlipstick around the corner. I did not, I didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t defy him. I just went my own way.\nAnd somehow, he could accept that. So again she was the pioneer. She got the full brunt\nof his ire. And the only way she could think of to get out of it was to get married which\nshe did when she was 17.",
        "Q: Very young.",
        "A: Didn\u2019t work out too well. Of course. So.",
        "Q: Your parents, did they stay in that nice brick house in the Bronx.",
        "A: They did. Until my sister, my sister divorced that husband and remarried and they,\nwith her new husband and her daughter who was Tina was about eight by that time,\nmoved to Florida. My parents had vacationed in Florida. Just briefly you know go on\ntwo weeks\u2019 vacation. They liked it. And I don\u2019t know if you were around at the time but\nArthur Godfrey radio program really was a spokesman for Florida. And he talked up\nFlorida. And so my sister asked my father to come down and build something for her. To\nbuild, I don\u2019t know, some kind of storefront and of course he went. And he was not a\nyoung man at that time. So my mother saw an opportunity to get him out of his regular\nroutine and they started talking about retiring to Florida.",
        "Q: Nice.",
        "A: Which they did.",
        "Q: Where in Florida?",
        "A: They bought a place in Coral Gables. They like Miami. There was a large Jewish\ncontingent there, a lot of lands people. And they were very happy there.",
        "Q: Did they ever go back to Europe?",
        "A: No. At one point my father wanted me to go with him to some of his haunts like Bad\nKastine. And I had little kids at the time and so it wasn\u2019t that, I couldn\u2019t do it. Yeah.",
        "Q: They passed away in Florida?",
        "A: Yes. My mother had a series of heart attacks and died at age 59.",
        "Q: Oh my gosh, how young.",
        "A: Yeah. And my father was like 12 or 13 years older, he lived to be 88. On his own, in\nFlorida.",
        "Q: On your journey over to the United States what would you want your grandchildren\nand everybody else\u2019s grandchildren cause this will be on the internet, what would you\nwant them to understand the most about that journey?",
        "A: Hm. I think it is to just keep an open mind and keep your eyes open to experience\nthings for yourself, not what somebody told you, not what you read in a book, just be\nthere. Be there and see it for yourself. And live it for yourself. And make whatever\nsense you can of that experience. It'll be your own.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you\u2019d like to add to what we\u2019ve talked about today.",
        "A: No it\u2019s been good. Thank you.",
        "Q: Thank you Kitty. And with that this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial\nMuseum interview with Kitty Weiss Penner on July 29, 2016 in South Portland, Maine.\n(looking at photos)",
        "Q: Ok Kitty tell me what is this picture of?",

        "Q: What is this photograph of?",
        "A: This is a picture of my sister and myself in happier times. I would guess that this\nmight be 1938, spring of 38, something like that, before Kristallnacht.",

        "A: This is from the Sunday Daily News, the Sunday News which is like a magazine\nsection of the newspaper, of the daily news, in New York City. And it\u2019s dated June 18,\n1939. And this documents the children of which I am one in Collegeville, Brith Shalom.\nYou can see on the carpet there, was the sponsoring organization that helped the\nKrauses get all these children here. And my mother found this just in the newspaper.\nAnd she, oh my god. These are my children. The one on the bottom right, I don\u2019t\u2019 know\nthat you can see me but I can see my sister, right there [she points]",

        "A: Exactly.",
        "Q: On the 50 children.",

        "Q: Did she talk, did Inge talk at all about what school life would have been like? You\nknow what she ex, cause you were little and you hadn\u2019t yet gone and it\u2019s a \u2014",

        "Q: Did your father travel to K",
        "Q: For someone who has such a long last name as mine and I can\u2019t pronounce it, it\u2019s\nshameful. Knihynicze. He had property there you\u2019re saying.",

        "Q: in some ways it\u2019s an echo of your father having had too many burdens.",
        "Q: But it is a huge, you know had it not worked and it would never have been anything of\nyour sister\u2019s fault because she\u2019s a child, the kind of burden that was on her should she\nfail, is huge. So do you remember saying goodby to your mother? And your father?",
        "A: I remember the fight when my father came home yelling and screaming and carrying\non. What have you done? You must be crazy, insane to send your children away. But he\nalready had the visa and he already was secure. And she was desperate, absolutely\ndesperate. This was her last chance and our last chance.\nQ: And she was right.",
        "Q: So they came to terms and she put her foot down, right?",

        "Q: So we talked about Dr. Shlesser. We talked about \u2014",
        "Q: Shless, excuse me. We talked about the heaviness of the air. And what it was due to.\nNow you\u2019re very little. Did you know what being Jewish meant?",

        "Q: Were there other passengers, not part of this group of children.",
        "Q: I wanted to get a sense of the ship life. Were there people on there who weren\u2019t part of\nthe group of children. Was it like a regular passenger liner.",
        "Q: Do you remember being sea sick\u2019?",
        "Q: This is the part where I kind of interrupted you before when we train ship, train ship.\nSo what did you guys do on the ship?",

I would guess that maybe they were sort of more from\nGermany and her father, Zehngut, had a branch of the family that was in Eisenstaedt,\nwhich is, well it was the mining area, probably more to the east.

I have some of his furniture that he made for me. Yes. Made here in the United\nStates. So he was, he was really, I think he was a genius. If he had, had any schooling he\nwould have god knows where he would have been. But and my mother was very, you\u2019d\nhave to call it shtultz, she was very proud. And snooty. Kind of snooty. I have to say\nthat. Yeah and so she always liked pretty things and made sure that her girls had pretty\nthings. And that sort of thing. But she was a very strong woman. I mean she, she was the\none who signed us up to come to America. My father was in Knihynicze taking care of\nthings there. He was out of town at the time. And she signed us up. When he came home\nit was fait accompli.",
        "A: Yeah. He went crazy.",
        "A: Well I think children are especially girls are close to their mothers. And it\u2019s only later\nthat they discover that their fathers are people too. My father seemed brusque and he was\nvery powerfully built so he was a little scary.",

        "A: --And nice, yes. I don\u2019t know where that came from. But I made up for it. (laughs)",
        "A: Probably. [wipes mouth]",
        "A: We had an apartment in Vienna. I believe it was on the second floor. And it was on\nRohdenstern Gasse.",
        "A: Rohdenstern Gasse.",
        "A: And I remember that each room had a ceramic heater.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "A: They, each room had its own heating. You know Vienna being in Central Europe was\nquite chilly so yes, and it was heated with coals. The furniture, my father made every\nstitch.",
        "A: Everything yes.",
        "A: Yes. I don\u2019t know the address of it. But it was nearby. And it was a Jewish\nneighborhood. And it was not fancy. I mean we didn\u2019t have the furniture that we have\ntoday. We did not entertain at home. And my children puzzled about that. That I don\u2019t\u2019\nentertain. They said didn\u2019t you entertain in Vienna. No. People met in cafes. They did\nnot, it was only family that came home. And had you know \u2014",
        "A: Well they meet in restaurants, but this was you know this predates that by quite a bit.\nIt was the home was for the family.",
        "A: It was yes and, and it was around the dining room table and meals that one had\nentertainment with the family. So there was not the easy chair kind of sitting area. There\nwere bedrooms and there was probably like a big common area. I don\u2019t remember the\nkitchen at all. I probably was not permitted to go into the kitchen. We did have a maid.\nBecause there was so much you know in terms of coal and, and laundry and cooking that\nunless you were very poor, you had a maid.",
        "A: Yes. it was not unusual. You know it was not the status thing that we have. It was a\nnecessity. And the maid very often would be a young woman from the country who was\nlooking for opportunities to meet a nice young man, somebody that wouldn\u2019t be in her\nhome town.",
        "A: Yes, yes. Totally understandable. But I do remember that the we had Christmas for\nthe maid and I would hang up a stocking and I would get a hunk of coal in the, in the toe,\njust to keep me humble. And oranges. And it was not a matter of toys so much but it was\njust you know little things. But I do remember the hunk of coal which was supposed to be\nif you were a bad girl.",
        "A: NO. Let\u2019s see what else. I do, well when, when things got bad, after Kristallnacht\nwhich was 1938, which I do remember. And so pretty soon the maid said that she\ncouldn\u2019t\u2019 work for a Jewish family. Her boyfriend was a Nazi. And so the maid left.",
        "A: It was, it was. We really liked her.",
        "A: Erica.",
        "A: No. No she did not have to do that.",
        "A: Exactly. She was running the household and taking my sister to school. And then\nwhen things got bad and she was trying to figure out what to do, of course my father was\nworking. Working, working. She was figuring out what to do. She left us alone. My\nsister went to school. Now I can\u2019t imagine that I was totally alone in the apartment, but I\nwould paint. I was you know I was painting and drawing from the time I could hold a\npencil. And so I was busy with my own things that I was doing.",
        "A: No, no, no. This was on paper with water colors and colored pencils.",
        "A: No I wouldn\u2019t think of that. Oh my goodness. You were a free spirit.",
        "A: Oh yes. oh yes, yes.",
        "A: Running water, plumbing.",
        "A: Yes, yes. Tub, yes.",
        "A: Yes. Even a telephone.",
        "A: Yes. one of those big curvy jobs, yes. And my father listened intently in the evening\nto the radio.",
        "A: Oh he wanted only the news. But there was, there was music too, yes.",
        "A: He was, no he hired. He had people working for him and one worker in particular was\nhe probably had been with him for years. And he actually warned us of Kristallnacht\nand warned that we were not to open the door, no matter what. And when the storm\ntroopers and the Black Shirts came and knocked on the door, and banged and called for\nmy father to come out, he did not. He would have been sent off to Buchenwald or god\nknows what.",
        "A: I can\u2019t come up with a name now. I, I guess I didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t\u2019 really go to the shop.",
        "A: No. No.",
        "A: I guess so. I mean I guess he was a good employer. He, he was very short with\npeople. They had to, he had few people. In the United States he never kept a worker.\nThey just didn\u2019t do it right or you know he didn\u2019t\u2019 have the patience to teach yeah.",
        "A: Right. Kristallnacht in Germany had preceded the one in Austria.",
        "A: It was November tenth, 1938.",
        "A: In Germany, yes, yes. And so he got wind of it and warned my father.",
        "A: Not really, no.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes. We were all in one bed.",
        "A: Yeah. But and my, you know the idea was to be hushed and not make a peep, not\nbreathe. And so they went away and they came back and they banged and yelled again.\nBut at that time they didn\u2019t break in. They didn\u2019t break in. They just expected\ncooperation.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh for sure.",
        "A: Oh yes, yeah.",
        "A: A lot of broken glass. Store fronts had been smashed. And I don\u2019t remember, I know\nthat they broke into the synagogues and set fires and, and the police and the fire\ndepartment just watched and let it happen. And the next day they got old men with beards\nto clean it up on their knees.",
        "A: To clean up the streets with buckets of water.",
        "A: I believe so.",
        "A: I personally don\u2019t know but I\u2019ve certain read about it. And that was the first round.\nAlthough, you know intellectuals and, and people who were prominent were rounded up.\nHad been you know it was an ongoing process.",
        "A: Oh as permanent workers. Yes, everything was done by hand. You know there\nprobably was an electric saw or something like that but everything was done, measured\nand cut and \u2014",
        "A: Not in Vienna, no.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yeah, he was a sympathizer.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Exactly, yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, I don\u2019t remember that.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember that.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I think they were mostly focused on family.",
        "A: My father sort of as I said, he listened to the radio and, and my mother read the\nnewspapers. And he said you know Hitler was a menace and that he was going to go after\nEngland which was you know out of the blue. Nobody really thought that that would ever\nhappen. That he, he really he\u2019s going to go after England. My mother read the paper.\nAnd my mother socialized in the cafes. And there was an exchange of information. I\nmean that\u2019s all they, they really talked about was you know the oncoming menace and\nhow do we get out. My mother, I don\u2019t\u2019 know how she got the addresses of the family\nthat was in New York. We wrote to them. \u2014",
        "A: Correct. She wrote to them and asked for visas. For the family.",
        "A: Well I think they wrote back that they were not wealthy and that they would send the\nvisa for my father. And that as soon as he became established he would bring family.\nAnd that\u2019s the way it had been done previously.",
        "A: Exactly, exactly. So they sent papers, visa and their, immigration was tight. Visas\nwere allocated according to strict quotas and so they sent visas for my father, and I\nbelieve for his brother.",
        "A: I guess so, I guess so. I guess he lived with his mother. And that was in a separate\napartment.",
        "A: It was much later.",
        "A: It was state side, state side. No he supported his family through thick and thin. And so\nthey sent those visas and not for my mother and not for my sister and me. And so my\nmother, as I said, was constantly reading the newspapers and talking to people and\nhearing what how everybody was trying to get away. and she came across this article in\nthe paper that this family was coming. And they were going to bring 50 children out of\nVienna.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I, my mother did not read Hebrew.",
        "A: I think it might have been a little ad something like that.",
        "A: Yeah. They were the Krauses were below the radar. They were very, they did not\ncall attention to themselves either in Vienna or when they got to the United States. It was\nvery hush, hush. There were kindertransports going to England.",
        "A: Yes. And my cousins went.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well I did know my cousins. Herta who was older. She was a teenager. And her\nbrother, Freddy who was the only grand boy, grand child, grand son and so he had a\nspecial place. And so we, were closer to them and we went to the park together and stuff\nlike that. And my aunt Olga, had an opportunity to sign her kids up.",
        "A: Correct. Her oldest sister. And so that was a little precedent that and of course they\nwere older than these, my sister and me. So Herta went to England as an au pair, to a\nfamily. And Freddy was adopted into an English home, where they had already adopted\na boy out of Berlin. So they that was the precedent and they left quite a while before my\nsister and I.",
        "A: He was. He had cancer at some point, came down with cancer. And all these things.\nWhether there\u2019s a war going on or and he was at home. And he died I think shortly after\nwe left.",
        "A: She was alive. And her oldest daughter stayed back with her.",
        "A: That was Herta\u2019s mother.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Olga.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The other sister, Annie, was married, well Olga was married too. Annie went, her\nhusband was Bulgarian.\n(cut)",
        "A: Annie was married. She had no children. Her husband was Bulgarian. His name was\nTager. Annie, Tager. And we always called him Tager. I don\u2019t know that he had any\nother name. He must have. but when things got bad, everybody kind of made a plan. And\nthey said well I\u2019m going to do this and either you\u2019re going to come with me or you\u2019re\nnot. And many people did that.",
        "A: Annie I think she went to France and ultimately she was interned. In a camp in Nice.\nAnd she spent the war years in Nice and survived.",
        "A: No one knows. He went back to Bulgaria and disappeared.",
        "A: I believe so, yes.",
        "A: Right, right. He got caught in some net.",
        "A: Olga was married to a man named Ulmacher who was the father of those children.\nMy cousins. And he she said he had to stay back and take care of her parents. As the\noldest. And as I said, my grandfather probably had early signs of cancer at that time. she\nstayed back, sent her children to England.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: He wound up in South America. In Caracas.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know when he got to Caracas but he had a whole new life in Caracas.",
        "A: Olga stayed with her mother and I\u2019ve always thought that the two of them stayed\ntogether and went, were sent to Theresienstadt together. And from there to Auschwitz.\nBut I understand they were separated. And, they went to Auschwitz at two different\ntimes.",
        "A: No. No. And after the war my mother sent for Annie to come to the United States.",
        "A: And she came to New York, yes she came to live with us for a short time. But and\nthen she went off on her own and went to the cafes as she always did in Vienna and\ncontinued playing cards in the cafes. At one time she was playing cards, she said I have a\nterrible headache, fell over. She had had a massive brain hemorrhage and died. Shortly\nafter she came \u2014",
        "A: To the United States, yes.",
        "A: Yes. Yes.",
        "A: And how you deal.",
        "A: It was, it was. That\u2019s why it\u2019s the Holocaust.",
        "A: I remember going to pick up my sister at school, with my mother. We walked together\nat the end of the day and there were other mothers standing outside and jeering and\nyelling about the Jewish children so [waves hand] I don\u2019t know what they were. But they\nit was horrible. And these were mothers, jeering at the Jewish children coming out of\nschool. They had separated the, you couldn\u2019t go to a regular school. They were now into\nJewish schools.",
        "A: Probably, yeah. that\u2019s where she went. And so pretty soon she didn\u2019t continue going\nto school.",
        "A: No, she didn\u2019t talk about it. That I remember. But I had great confidence in my\nparents. They I just trusted that they knew what to do.",
        "A: Yes, yes. I felt, I felt secure. I did. I felt secure and I felt confident. I sort of got that\nfrom them, that they felt confident that they would figure it out.",
        "A: Knihynicze. He had property there \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I believe that I believe that they did. I think maybe there was one that stayed there.\nAnd was still there.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yes, to, to see you know what he could, I don\u2019t know. What he could sell or what he\ncould rescue. Or what they had taken at that time.",
        "A: I don\u2019t\u2019 think he did it on a regular basis. I think he went to sort of clear things out.\nTo settle things.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "A: Well she inquired about it. And she said count me in. Take my girls, take my girls to\nAmerica. And the hope was that when my father\u2019s family saw how desperate they were,\nby sending the girls away alone, that they would send the visa for her, which indeed 1s\nwhat happened. She, they did send the visa. They saw that we were, did not have horns,\nthat we were normal healthy girls and my sister\u2019s job was to beg them to send that last\nvisa for my mother.",
        "A: It was quite a responsibility and I don\u2019t think she ever got over it. I don\u2019t think she\never but you know that they, that was her task, one to look after me. And two, to\nconvince them and she only had like one little visit to send the papers for my mother.",
        "A: I think she always felt that she had extra responsibility and that I got a free pass,\nwhich there is some truth to that.",
        "A: Exactly, exactly.",
        "A: Absolutely. She was very wise, she was very wise, intuitively wise. So she said \u2014",
        "A: She said they\u2019re going. And she made all the arrangements for my father and his\nmother and his brother to travel to America.",
        "A: It\u2019s what she did.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "A: I remember the train station. And we all sort of you know everything had been said.\nThere was nothing to say. It was silent.",
        "A: Yeah. it was and the station was patrolled by black shirts and brown shirts and we just\nwaited for the train. We were not going to miss that train.",
        "A: The other children.",
        "A: I remember being interviewed. And I remember you know what I thought were sort of\nsilly questions. Would you make a window out of wood or would you make it out of\nglass? Being a carpenter\u2019s daughter, I had a hint on that. You know stuff like that and,\nand maybe a Rorschach test. And physical exam. But that was the question that I\nremember. And I was a very charming kid. I was cute. And so they said yeah she\u2019s just\non the border of the right age. Just on the border.",
        "A: Yes. Yes.",
        "A: Iremember them on the ship. I don\u2019t remember meeting them. I remember meeting\nthe doctor. Doctor Shluss, Shless. And then I remember meeting them on the ship.",
        "A: He was their German speaking spokesperson.",
        "A: He came from America. With the Krauses and he was their German speaking envoy\nwho was able to talk to people. They didn\u2019t speak German.",
        "A: Dr. Shless? He was just a kindly man and reading Steven Pressman\u2019s book, he has\nseveral children. He was a widower and had several children of his own. So he was good\nwith kids.",
        "A: He had glasses and he was not imposing. He was very easy to talk to. He was very\npleasant you know. That\u2019s all I really remember.",
        "A: Yes, we, I don\u2019t remember where. It was some office place, some \u2014",
        "A: At the train station.",
        "A: It was May 1939.",
        "A: Well I don\u2019t remember the date.",
        "A: Yes, something like that. Early spring.",
        "A: Both, both. It was just you know we were saying goodby, although the actual goodby\nhad, and the whole you know why we\u2019re going and I\u2019Il see you soon and that whole, that\nhad all transpired. That had all been done. Yeah.\n(cut)",
        "A: I think his name was Shless.",
        "A: well I knew it was a burden. Because I remember walking down the street with my\nfather one time. And we were I think we were going to the bakery. And this man in\nuniform came up and as I said I was a cute kid. Came up and he said, started talking to\nme. And he said are you Catholische. Ist du Catholische? And I said no, I\u2019m Polish.",
        "A: He was flabbergasted is all I know and he didn\u2019t say another word. Turned on his heel\nand walked away. But my father held his breath.",
        "A: Well Polish was synonymous at that time with being Jewish.",
        "A: Yes. My little passport said Polish. Not Austrian. Polish. That was like a code word.",
        "A: I believe so.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Do you know, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I think she also, because she was married to someone who was Polish. Even though he\nwas, I don\u2019t know. Ukrainian or whatever, was labeled Polish.",
        "A: Mm hm.",
        "A: My mother kept a Jewish, a kosher home but I can\u2019t remember any big hoopla. Yes,\nmy mother went to Yom Kippur and but it was not a big deal.",
        "A: Yes, well ostensibly that was for the maid. But it was, it was fun for the kids.",
        "A: Exactly, exactly.",
        "A: No. I remember. The train stopped in Berlin and subsequently. I mean I knew we were\nin Berlin. I didn\u2019t know why we were there. Apparently we were there to get the last exit\npapers. And if we hadn\u2019t gotten those we would have had to turn around and go back\nhome. So we were at this Jewish c, some kind of Jewish organization or building. And\nthey, my sister and I were in bunk beds. And there was a big to do downstairs in the\nstreet. Marching and music and parade and, and so my sister jumped down from her\nupper bunk and came into my bed. And then we peaked out the window and we thought it\nwas Hitler. And we watched and saw this you know all this uniforms and flags and it\nwas very frightening. It turned out it was a kind of the solidifying the relationship\nbetween Germany and Italy. Von Ribbentrop was representing the German Reich and\nMussolini\u2019s son in law, Chiano , was representing the Italians and this was their\nallegiance, their alliance being cemented in with great pomp. As we watched it.",
        "A: No, I thought it was Hitler from all the pomp that was happening and the marching\nand the uniforms and the flags. Subsequently from Pressman, Steven Pressman\u2019s book\nand his research filled in the details.",
        "A: It was wonderful to fill in the spaces because I just had a generalized impression of\nwhat was going on.",
        "A: There were the Krauses, there was Dr. Shless. And there were two nurses, for 50\nchildren.",
        "A: Two nurses or women in white uniforms. So there was very little supervision.",
        "A: Can you imagine 50 children.",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "A: We were very well behaved children but we were curious. And we ran all over that\nship, my sister and I.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh sorry.",
        "A: We were on our own and my mother said you are going to have a wonderful time.",
        "A: I totally believed her and I made sure that I did. So you know I made you know I was\ncurious. I looked around. I had my sister. And I was out for adventure.",
        "A: She did. She said you\u2019re going to have a great time.",
        "A: I don\u2019t\u2019 remember eating. I don\u2019t remember sleeping. I don\u2019t remember any of that.",
        "A: Big. It was a big ship. With a very loud horn. And, and we took off and we went\nfrom Hamburg to Southampton, England and then we went across the ocean.",
        "A: There must have been.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure it was. But I am not aware of, I don\u2019t know whether we had a separate dining\nroom. Or they you know they kind of kept us together as best they could.",
        "A: No. No.",
        "A: We ran around. We ran up and down the stairs and we ran up the decks and we\nexplored and we found first class playroom with fabulous rocking horses and FAO\nSchwarz toys. I mean we weren\u2019t supposed to be there. But there were no other children\nthere at the time. so maybe there were no other children on the ship besides these. And\nso we availed ourselves of that fabulous playroom. And as far as I remember, we did not\nlike the food. It was not familiar. But we did find a barrel of apples and we ate those.",
        "A: Iremember yes, stealing apples. And but I don\u2019t\u2019 remember sitting at a table. Or\nanything like that. I just remember being totally free. I mean we could have fallen\noverboard. Not even made a splash.",
        "A: Seen, especially if, for taking pictures, photographs. Documentation. But I can\u2019t\nremember seeing them. I don\u2019t\u2019 remember what our bunk was like. I \u2014",
        "A: Just my sister. We were \u2014",
        "A: Well again she had a heavy responsibility to keep track of me which was probably\nquite a job. But she went along with me. We had fun. And I don\u2019t\u2019 remember being sea\nsick. I don\u2019t remember, I remember taking a bath in salt water. It, it the water, even the\nhot water was sourced from the ocean. And it had a particular smell.",
        "A: Different, just different and many years later when I was in Atlantic City, lo and\nbehold the bathtub water was salt water. And it had a particular odor.",
        "A: Yes. And that was, 25 years later.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I don\u2019t\u2019 re, they didn\u2019t speak German. They did not speak German. And we did not\nspeak English. We were on our own. Make sense of it as best you can.",
        "A: Not that I know of.",
        "A: Yeah, right. 1t was many years later but there was a reunion, the so called children.\nAnd. There was a reunion and people got up and talked about their memories. And the\nmen had total amnesia. They did not remember the trip at all. And there were several\nwho had no memory of their transport or anything like that. It\u2019s just and memory picked\nup again when they were on land in Philadelphia.",
        "A: Amnesia and it was probably a safety mechanism. It was too traumatic. It was too\ntraumatic for several of them so they blocked it out.",
        "A: Well I have very you know just smatterings of memory but I remember being happy.\nSunshine and freedom and I, I was good to go.",
        "A: Definitely.",
        "A: I think so.",
        "A: It\u2019s trauma.",
        "A: Then we got to Ellis Island. And my aunt met us.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: I think her name was Fraicha.",
        "A: Fraicha.",
        "A: No that\u2019s her first name.",
        "A: Right. Weiss if she was not married. Weiss. And she\u2019s a young woman. She\u2019s pretty\nand, and she wore a fashionable hat. And she came to meet us and that\u2019s when my sister\ndelivered her message.",
        "A: You\u2019ve got to send that visa, you\u2019ve got to send the papers.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: she was very friendly. She was very pleasant and I guess she took it to heart. Now\nyou know there\u2019s no telephone. I could not write. I don\u2019t know how soon thereafter the\nvisa was sent. But she got the message. She relayed it to the family in Brooklyn and\nthey sent the visa for my mother.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Well the group stayed together and I don\u2019t know how, I guess we took a bus or\nsomething, put bus, put us on a bus. We went to Philadelphia where the Jewish\norganization had a summer camp. Today I would call it like a motel and it was all on one\nfloor. And we had our separate rooms. And there was an attempt to teach us English and\nbaseball and stuff like that. And we played hopscotch and games and looked at the\ncomics and just had summer. Played outdoors and rallied round the flag to pledge\nallegiance which we were taught. And it was just nice. It was pleasant.",
        "A: No, I was receptive to it all. You know it was all new and it was ok. I didn\u2019t\u2019 have\nany great expectations or disappointments you know. A lot of the members of this Jewish\norganization the Brith Shalom of Philadelphia took an interest in the children and came to\nvisit us. And they brought you know they were business people. Some brought hats that\nthey had in their shop. Or they brought cakes. They, they befriended us and visited us.\nAnd I made particular friends with somebody who had the ability to throw his voice. He\nwas like a ventriloquist. And I just thought that was the most fabulous talent and we just\nhad a great time together.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: He did, he did and he came you know regularly more than once. And I don\u2019t know\nwhether he thought he would adopt us or what.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t talk about it. She just \u2014",
        "A: Probably not. Probably not.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think she ever got out from under that cloud of responsibility. And she just\nhad very different interests. And I was successful in ways that she was not. And that was\nhard. That was hard for her because she felt that she had blazed the trail and that I had an\neasy time.",
        "A: So for instance I, I mean we both did well at school and stuff and, and skipped you\nknow the New York City school system if you did well, they didn\u2019t know what to do with\nyou. There was no such thing as enrichment. They just pushed you ahead so that you\nwere in the next class. And so they pushed us both ahead and we had some of the same\nteachers and, and that sort of thing. And then I tried out for a special high school in New\nYork. Now she had\u2014",
        "A: High school of music and art. She had tried out for that school (bells ringing).",
        "A: You don\u2019t want to continue where we were.",
        "A: Well the very earliest memory is of a curtain in probably in the nursery which sort of\nwe, they were casement windows, which means that they rolled out. And when the\nbreeze came in, it would lift this curtain which was very airy and lightweight. And it\nwould lift this curtain up and I just thought of a giant outside the window breathing in\nand out because the curtain would rise up and then fall. It would rise up and fall. And I\nremember the fabric so distinctly. It was pale sort of a pea green with white leaves ovoid\nleaves scattered throughout the curtain. And there was a heavy thread running the warp\nof the fabric to make it hang right. And if I ever ran into that I would know that fabric in\na minute.",
        "A: And that was, it was the very earliest memory that I had.",
        "A: The giant.",
        "A: Right. repetition, you know in and out, in and out. And we were on the second floor\nso it had to be a giant.",
        "A: Vienna.",
        "A: there was a courtyard in the center of the house. Now these houses were very old. So\nthe courtyard was probably at one time where carriages would enter this large gate of this\nentrance and then there would be this courtyard and then these wide curved stairs, going\nupstairs.",
        "A: Yes. Both.",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure. I don\u2019t know what the construction was, but it maybe had five floors,\nfive stories high.",
        "A: Fraicha.",
        "A: At Ellis Island.",
        "A: Well my mother had made all the arrangements for my father, his mother and his\nbrother to travel to the, to America. And so since her visa arrived in time, she was simply\nadded to his cabin.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "A: No we did not. I mean I wasn\u2019t in touch with her. The letters you know went back\nand forth would take weeks and no telephone and nothing like that. No Twitter. No\nSkype. So we didn\u2019t know anything.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Well my parents arrived at the end of August, 1939. We had been at the camp since\nthe beginning of June when we arrived. And so they arrived and \u2014",
        "A: They picked us up. And somehow we got to Brooklyn where the family had set up an\napartment sort of like a, like a railroad flat. All the rooms were in line. And, and we\nsettled in. and war broke out officially September 1.",
        "A: By a hair. And so September comes around and we start school. Not speaking English\nand my mother described us walking to the school weeping because we couldn\u2019t\nunderstand and couldn\u2019t speak. But the teacher spoke Yiddish and so she said don\u2019t\nworry. I\u2019ll take care of them. And you know within weeks we were speaking English.",
        "A: Yeah the very, the very start was hard. But people were friendly. It wasn\u2019t like it was\nin Austria. It wasn\u2019t that way. There was nobody jeering and throwing things at us. And\nSo we Started school and you know learned English, fit right in.",
        "A: Yeah it was like a magical age you know. [gestures idea of \u201cmargin\u201d\u2019| Just that little\nmargin of adaptability.",
        "A: Right, well of course that was all that my parents talked about was what was\nhappening in Europe and my mother had her family there. And received letters\nperiodically that had big pieces censored out [gestures \u201ccensored pieces\u2019\u2019|, black marks\ncut. And so she pieced it together that her father was dying of cancer. And, and pretty\nsoon those letters stopped.",
        "A: Not that I know of. No. But they were very, very happy. And then we were at some\nkind of family gathering and I don\u2019t re, family was talking and they asked my\ngrandmother something about how her life was in Europe. Oh, she said it was terrible,\nterrible. And it was she never got anything, she never had anything and so my father said\nwell who bought your shoes. And who paid your passage. And he was just he was\nhumiliated in front of these strangers who were family. I don\u2019t know what her motivation\nwas. Maybe she was just stupid. You know she could have been stupid. Or she you\nknow this was before social security and things like that. Maybe she thought that she\nwould do better by throwing herself on these relatives. And my father was just more than\nincensed.",
        "A: And that was the end of that. And he took a job in the Bronx and we moved to the\nBronx which was like you know\u2014",
        "A: Another world. Different.",
        "A: I do not.",
        "A: No. They had a house and a garden. And I believe this uncle I don\u2019t remember what\nhis, what his business was. He was elderly. He had a parrot, I remember that. And he\nused to cut the parrot\u2019s toenails, claws, yes. But he broke off.",
        "A: Mm hm.",
        "A: I think I was in about third grade. I remember--",
        "A: Possibly yeah. A year or two, yeah. And I remember third grade in the Bronx. Miss\nBullock.",
        "A: Unh hunh.",
        "A: He was a carpenter.",
        "A: Well he worked for somebody and then he lost patience completely and set up\npractically next door. In the Bronx. And so he had an apartment first. And then my\nmother noticed, she would walk from the apartment, two blocks around the corner to his\nshop. And one day she was walking by and people were moving furniture out of one of\nthe houses. And so she inquired and it turned out an old lady had lived there and died.\nAnd she, well you know can I buy this house. And I don\u2019t know. They said something\nridiculous, but $5000 and it\u2019s yours. And she went to the bank without my father\u2019s\nknowledge, plunked down $5000 and the house was ours. So here was the second time\nthat she acted totally on her own and it was wonderful. It was wonderful. It was \u2014",
        "A: No. No, that was a good thing. It was a brick house, three stories. Fabulous\nwoodwork, oak paneling and molding and stairs and it was a godsend \u2014",
        "A: Absolutely, absolutely. It had a porch. I have a picture. I'll show it to you, of this\nhouse. It was, it was something special.",
        "A: Around the corner, like two blocks away.",
        "A: No, he rented the space. Yes. And originally it had an apartment behind it and he\nthought that maybe we should move there. And my mother said oh no. She\u2019s not going\nto raise her f, her children, her girls, in this situation.",
        "A: Definitely [nods head] yeah.",
        "A: No never. She worked in my father\u2019s shop. When he went out to install things and he\ndid store fronts and fixtures. Very often for immigrants, refugees who established their\nown businesses and he would make their showcases and their store fronts. And if he was\nout of the shop, somebody had to mind the store. So she stayed at the store. While he was\nout.",
        "A: Oh of course. I know people who were lawyers and whose skills did not transfer. And\npeople when family a doctor, he spent you know he had to go back to school and do you\nknow make up some coursework or something in order to get licensed here. And were\nfurriers and shop people.",
        "A: German.",
        "A: Yes. We would come home for lunch. It was quite a, quite a walk. Go to school.\nSpeak English. Come home for lunch. Go back to school, come back home. So yeah we\nspoke German at home and we spoke English in the world.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes. My mother was very eager to learn English and she went to classes and\nbecame a citizen. My father became a citizen too.",
        "A: As soon as they could.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Definitely. I think even before the end of the war.",
        "A: I think I have my own papers, yes. And my \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: They just asked some you know historical questions and things like that.",
        "A: Definitely.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. Oh my father railed, railed against government in Germany. He, he gave up\nbeing Jewish completely. He never we never had a kosher house again. We, he never\nwent to temple. My mother did. Once in a while, for holidays. And Yom Kippur and\nRosh Hashanah. He said there was no god if this could happen and ne just turned his back\non the whole thing.",
        "A: Definitely. It was\u2014",
        "A: My sister felt more connected to, to her Jewish heritage. She when they were in\nFlorida, she participated at a temple. I never have. And her daughter also seems more\nconnected to the Jewish heritage and not that she keeps a kosher home but she you know\nshe\u2019s connected to the community. And I\u2019m not.",
        "A: Well I\u2019m an atheist and I just from my experience and my reading I have come to that\nconclusion. If anything, I\u2019d be a Buddhist.",
        "A: They did. They I mean some people just disappeared like Tager. And I think one of\nmy father\u2019s brothers just disappeared like a blown leaf. We did know that my grandfather\npassed. And we knew that Olga and her mother, my grandmother, were pushed from one\napartment to another. I always thought that they were together, but I subsequently learned\nthat they also were separated.",
        "A: A friend, a cousin of my ex-husband 1s very savvy on the internet and she puzzled it\nout.",
        "A: Yes, yes. I always had a little fantasy that somehow they went off to the Vienna\nwoods and hid. And survived.",
        "A: Well I enjoyed school. I had friends in school. I applied to the high school of music\nand art which was a special high school that you auditioned for in New York. And I\nprepared a portfolio and auditioned and was accepted. And that was probably the biggest\nlearning experience.",
        "A: Yes, cause I was with a wide variety of people, very diverse student body from all\nover the city. Some very well-heeled people, some people who were very political. There\nwas one gal whose father was a died and hard communist. There were people of color\nwhich was unusual. That wouldn\u2019t\u2019 have been in the neighborhood school. There was a\nChinese girl that I was very friendly with, Gloria Wong. And when the communists took\nover in China, I hadn\u2019t a clue. I said well what do you think? And she said I think it\u2019s\ngoing to be a better thing for China. This was the era of the Rosenberg trials. And it was\nvery, it was still very conflicted. It was still very, the world was coming to my awareness.",
        "A: But I was so happy at that school. I just, I just blossomed. I couldn\u2019t wait for\nsummer vacation to end and go back to high school, which is not your typical high school\nexperience.",
        "A: But I was very lucky. Yeah. and I still have friends from high school. Yes. And then\nwhen I went off to college, it was a total disappointment. It was not as stimulating as high\nschool.",
        "A: Well I started out at Brooklyn College. Which was free. The city colleges of New\nYork, I mean totally unbeknownst to anybody today were free. Just like high school and\nso I would meet my friends on the subway. There was quite a little contingent that went\nfrom the Bronx to Brooklyn. Brooklyn College, because they had a very interesting art\ndepartment. And but of course you know it was a liberal arts school and so I had classics\nand I had history and I had language and yeah.",
        "A: No, it was not. It was a come down. We had artists. I mean it was sort of like a carry-\nover from the WPA projects where they hired artists in the art department to teach. So I\nhad Mark Rothko as a teacher. The poor man could not put two words together. He was\na wonderful artist but he was not a teacher. I had Clyfford Still and William Bazeotis and\nall these fabulous names today. They were struggling artists at the time. Anyway they\nwere not good teachers. And so I decided that and I really wanted to know about art. I\nwanted to know the background and so I was interested in art history. And Barnard\nCollege at that time was investing heavily in their art history department. And I was told\nto apply and I did and I got in and so I have a degree from Barnard College which is\nprestigious.",
        "A: I think, I think yes. As the years went by. They understood. My parents understood\nmore than they could speak. My mother was pretty proficient but my father there, never,\nI mean he spoke Yiddish.",
        "A: He just had a few phrases and he even had what, he had an English phrase like son of\na bitch. Somebody when he was a kid had come back and taught him son of a bitch and\nhe used that.",
        "A: Yes he knew that from Knihynicze.",
        "A: [shakes head \u201cno\u201d| No.",
        "A: Never. [shakes head \u201cno\u2019\u2019| Not in New York, not in Connecticut, not in Maine. No, I\njust it\u2019s where I\u2019m at.",
        "A: I\u2019ve gone back to visit.",
        "A: Mm hm.",
        "A: I think ve always been sort of an introspective person. And I realized that my\ngrandchildren who are not near and have not been close to me or I to them. Cause they\u2019ve\nalways grown away, grown up away from me.",
        "A: Yes. But you know geographic distance also means emotional distance. And\nknowledge and knowing somebody. So I thought that I would clue them and help them\nout to know me a little better.",
        "A: Correct, correct.",
        "A: Well I can\u2019t say it\u2019s a thing that goes chronologically from here to there. It\u2019s a series\nof stories. Of things that happened. Of things that I\u2019ve thought about. And we\u2019ll put\nthem together in some kind of a scrapbook and that\u2019!1 be it.",
        "A: [hope so, I hope so.",
        "A: My sister has gone back several times. And then one time, we went together. And we\nwent with my niece also, Tina, her daughter. And well my sister had some money there.\nAnd she filed for social security basically where she paid into the system and then\naccumulated money out of the system, which, which was effective if she spent the money\nthere. In Europe. And so she was motivated to use that money. I never bothered to pay\ninto the system. I don\u2019t care about it and I don\u2019t want it. And she planned to live to be a\nhundred so she would use it all. That didn\u2019t quite work that way. So we went back hm,\nI\u2019m trying to think of when. In the 90s. And maybe 92 or so. And we went to\nRohdenstern Gasse. And we went to the Prater and we went to the Vienna woods and\nwe went to the opera. And then Pat and I, my partner, went to Vienna also as part of a trip\nthat included Budapest and Prague. And I don\u2019t like Vienna. I find it stuffy, baroque and\nfalse, pretentious. I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t like it at all.",
        "A: No, I was tourist, I was a tourist. I had my eyes open and I was curious and we went\nto Salzburg, went to a play there. It turned out to be a play about an old age home and\nmy sister said oh, why do we want to go to see that. Cause it interests me. I didn\u2019t get all\nthe nuances of the language but I got enough of it. But it was interesting, it was\ninteresting. We went to performances and I thought that they were just stuffy. They were\nfor tourists. There was nothing with heart. We went to Bratislava which was just recently\nliberated from Russian domination and we went to the opera. And they were, they could\nhave been bus drivers. It just had, they were just doing a job. You know they had no\nheart. They had no emotion in to the part. It was just a businessman\u2019s opera. It was, it\nwas nothing. It was just nothing.",
        "A: Yeah, cause my parents loved opera. And we went to the opera in New York. We\nwent to the City Center and we went to the Met.",
        "A: I did.",
        "A: Well it\u2019s something called the March of the Living. And apparently, well it\u2019s a\nJewish organization that tries to get young people to understand the Holocaust and their\nheritage first hand. So they were mostly young people, but there were some survivors.\nAnd we were on a bus. And I made friends with several people. One of whom, Sophia\nAfariat was spent the war years in Poland. And she spoke fluent Polish so she had the\nadvantage of language. And we went to restaurants and things like that and she could\nspeak fluently with people. We went to Krakow. We went to Warsaw. And went to\nsome of the stations that Jews were assembled. We went to the ghetto. It was the first\ntime that I was with very devout Jews. The young people were devout. They prayed, on\nthe airplane. So that was the first. And then we went to Israel. (pause, something\nhappening off camera) We have to stop every time that door opens and closes.",
        "A: For the trip. Well seeing Krakow which my father had spoken of was a high point. I\nthought that well, um, Warsaw was just a gray depressing place. We had a bus that took\nus from one place to another. We had guards on the bus. We had a Polish soldier who\nwas on leave earning extra money, accompanying us on the bus.",
        "A: Well there\u2019s a lot of anti-Semitism, a lot of anti-Semitism. We went to a little village I\ndon\u2019t even know that it had a name. But it was a typical village, shtetl, town. The Jewish\nsynagogue, and there were no more Jews living there but it somehow, I don\u2019t know who\ntook care of it. So the synagogue had, was neatly tended. And the church was on the top\nof the hill. So the church was on the hill. And the synagogue was down here. [gestures\nlocation of church and synagogue| There was a contingent of Polish soldiers, with a tank\nstationed at the synagogue. They were playing cards. But there was a military presence.\nWe passed houses that were very derelict that probably had not been lived in for a\nnumber of years. We passed another place that was like a farm where they were very neat\nand tidy. They had cranes nesting in this chimney. I\u2019d never seen anything like that and\nthat was a tidy farm. So you know if the people who had the place could take care of it,\nhad the wherewithal to take care of it, had the energy and the skill and maybe some\nmoney to take care of it, they did well. If the people were old, poor, the place was\nderelict.",
        "A: I saw that yes. This lady Sophia, who had spent the war. She was able to talk to our\nguard and sort of befriend him and find out who he was. And that\u2019s how I know that he\nwas on furlough and stuff like that. We went to a place in Krakow that was sort of a folk\nart place. And I wanted to buy something for my grandchild who was little at the time.\nMy first grandchild. And so we bought something there. And I brought it to the hotel,\nopened it up and it had shattered into you know 42 pieces. So the next day we went back\nand I said well you know this, you packed it poorly. I need something else. And oh, no.\nNo they wouldn\u2019t, they wouldn\u2019t\u2019 honor that and so Sophia said we are Jews. And she\nplayed the Jew card. I was so embarrassed. I was so embarrassed that she felt it necessary\nto draw that card. And he said ok, pick out something else. We went to a Jewish\ncemetery and there was this little old lady scuttling through the cemetery. And Sophia\nstarted talking to her. And she had spent the war. She was Jewish. She had spent the war\nthere. She, she had no prospects of going anywhere else.",
        "A: Yes. And that was her life. I don\u2019t know, I think she was doing a short cut through\nthe cemetery to her home. Yeah. And she lived in that town with her daughter.",
        "A: No, I felt close to that, I did. It was very emotional. And when we went to Auschwitz\nthere were graffiti, anti-Semitic graffiti on the walls outside of Auschwitz, just outside.\nThey do keep the grounds themselves preserved. But it was very emotional. And so I left\na note saying you know but for fortunate kindness in this world, I would be here too.\n[shrugs shoulders |",
        "A: Well that was part of the trip. We went to Sobibor and we went yeah, the whole, yep.",
        "A: Well I got married. And that made me very happy. He was a wonderful young man.",
        "A: Eugene. He had a very supportive family. My family loved him so all was good. It\nwas good.",
        "A: Two sons. One lives in Ann Arbor, Michigan with two daughters who are now going\nto live on the east coast, one of whom 1s a graduate student at Harvard. And the other\nOne is just a graduate out of the college at Wooster, Ohio. I have a son now in LA, who\nhad two children, one of whom is in Providence, Rhode Island at Brown University. And\nthe daughter is a high school graduate, graduated, senior and she plans to go into musical\ntheater. She\u2019s very, very talented.",
        "A: A little bit. Well they\u2019ve seen the, they\u2019 ve seen video of the 50 children that Steven\nPressman made. They have the book. They have very casual interest in it all.",
        "A: Oh, completely.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. If I had remained in Austria, and there had been no war, I would be a\nGerman hausfrau.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I think that women still have a very tangential life there. I think it\u2019s still\nvery patriarchal. I think there is still some anti-Semitism that keeps people from\ndreaming and thinking that they could be something more. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have the\neducation that I have. I\u2019d be somebody else.",
        "A: Well I think my mother\u2019s message that I\u2019m going to have a wonderful time and to be\nOpen to new experience has been my way of doing things.",
        "A: I know.",
        "A: My, when my sister hit adolescence my father lost it. He, he wanted to impose kind\nof the old protection. He did not understand that girls have you know rights and thoughts\nof their own. He made life very hard for her. Constant bickering and constant picking on\nher, constant demeaning. He did not understand that she wanted to wear something that\nhe didn\u2019t\u2019 approve of. Lipstick drove him up the wall. And, and she, she was destroyed.\nAnd my mother could not stop him. I don\u2019t know what he had in mind. Loose women\nyou know wear lipstick and he just, he just had a totally, totally other way of looking at a\nyoung woman.",
        "A: Exactly. Don\u2019t be this and don\u2019t be that and be careful here [gestures with hand] and\nbe careful there and he just made her life miserable. Somehow I did not get it into his\ncraw the way she did. That was something deep set him off. I did not buck him. I put on\nlipstick around the corner. I did not, I didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t defy him. I just went my own way.\nAnd somehow, he could accept that. So again she was the pioneer. She got the full brunt\nof his ire. And the only way she could think of to get out of it was to get married which\nshe did when she was 17.",
        "A: Didn\u2019t work out too well. Of course. So.",
