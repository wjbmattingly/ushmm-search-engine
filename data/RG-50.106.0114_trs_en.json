        "Question: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Richard Peterson, conducted by Gail Schwartz on\nApril 6\", 1999 at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. What is your\nfull name?",
        "Answer: Richard William Peterson.",
        "Q: And where were you born and when were you born?",
        "A: In [indecipherable] Iowa on September 29\", 1925.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk a little bit about your childhood and your family. Who made up the\nmembers of your family?",
        "A: My father, Henry K. Peterson was a lawyer. Mother, Laura May Peterson. I\nhad two \u2014 two others, my older sister Josephine, who was 11 years older than I,\nand my brother Robert, nine years older than I.",
        "Q: And you spent your childhood in this one location?",
        "A: Exactly, yes.",
        "Q: What were your interests as a young child?",
        "A: Thad, oh I think a variety of things. One thing I think Mother and Dad\nencouraged a lot of reading, we did a lot of reading at home. The usual childhood\nsports, I think. I think beyond that also Mother and Dad encouraged collections of\nApril 6, 1999\nthings. Stamp collections, that sort of thing basically that was of interest. Music\nwas always a part of our home. Mother sang beautifully and she played the piano,\nwe had that sort of thing. Interestingly too at home, I think though, we had quite a\nbit \u2014 because on my father\u2019s side, Danish background, as the name indicates. On\nmy mother\u2019s side the family went way back from New England Yankee people.\nSo on Dad\u2019s side we would have my grandparents who lived just a block away,\nwe'd be often times in their home. We learned little bit of Danish, used some\nDanish in the home place, and my father had not spoken English until he was five.\nOn Mother\u2019s side we had a lot of Civil War background because she had three\nuncles who were in the Civil War. We had a lot of Civil War songs and a lot of\nthat sort of thing basically. So there was a kind of a developing interest of history\nas well too, during that time.",
        "Q: What kind of physical condition were you in? Were you a healthy child?",
        "A: Yes, yeah. Oh I had the usual, I think, childhood diseases basically and the\nscrapes and bruises, that kind of thing. But no, nothing unusual. It was \u2014 it was a\ngood \u2014 good childhood, healthy-wise, you bet.",
        "Q: And were you small for your age or tall for your age?",
        "A: Right about average I would think, yeah. I think average.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And did you have any religious training?\nApril 6, 1999",
        "A: We were Baptists. The Baptist persuasion is that there is no baptism until you\nreach what 1s called the age of believer. I was baptized when I was nine years old\nafter some instruction, basically. And of course in the Baptist church that\u2019s by\nimmersion. Mother \u2014 D-Dad was very active. Not only his profession but in\ncommunity life and religious life as well too. He\u2019d been the past president of the\nIowa Baptist Association. Mother was even a stronger Baptist than he was. She\nwas what was called a deep water, loud shouting Baptist and she enjoyed the reli \u2014\nso we had \u2014 we had a\u2014 a good \u2014 good \u2014 good religious background.",
        "Q: Did you have many friends? Were you a social child?",
        "A: Yes, I think so. Neighborhood friends, quite a few of those. The neighborhood\nquote gangs, end quote, I suppose. Then farther along in school we lived just\nwithin a \u2014 oh, a block or so of [indecipherable] school where I attended, and we\nhad a lot of friends at school, I \u2014 I think so, yes.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Was your family a very emotional family? Did they encourage you as\na boy to show your emotions, or to keep them in?",
        "A: There was never direct lect \u2014 any \u2014 any limitation of \u2014 of showing emotion.\nDad was quite serious just by his demeanor basically. Mother \u2014 Mother had more\nexpression I think basically and she enjoyed things more. She was a\u2014a-\u2014a\ndelightfully humorous person, a lot of fun to be around. Dad, as I say, was more\nApril 6, 1999\nserious, but he was a very, very, very fine person. And looking back, too, in the\nhome, as I said, it was a lot of encouragement of reading and a lot of\nencouragement of motivation to do things. Dad was very active community-wise\nand he urged all of us to \u2014 to be involved in high school activities, other activities\nas well. An interesting thing about the family, though, you see, we\u2019re almost rather\nlike two families. My \u2014 1n the sense that my sister was 11 years older, my brother\nnine, and I, as Mother said, the side dish that came on orders was that much\nyounger, you see. So I\u2014 they were up and growing, my \u2014 my sister Josephine,\nbrother Robert, they were kind of on a different level by the time I was \u2014 I came\nalong. So I was home quite a bit myself, in those later years.",
        "Q: When did you start becoming aware of Europe?",
        "A: I think because of the interest in reading we had, we were really quite young,\nbecause Mother\u2019s two spinster sisters had both been to Europe. Quite unusual at\nthat particular time is these young women, they were teachers, basically, they had\nboth been in Europe. My Aunt Agnes had \u2014 had been in Germany a number of\ntimes and studied there. Aunt Belle had been with her also. But we would have,\nwhen Aunt Belle and Aunt \u2014 Aunt Agnes were there, talks about Europe and\nvisiting about Europe. So really as younger people we were aware of at least\nEurope. Not the rest of the world, but Europe, certainly. And I\u2019m speaking now\nApril 6, 1999\nof \u2014 of ages probably of 10 and 12, maybe eight, we were aware of Europe.\nNews-wise, later though, because it wasn\u2019t of course until I was getting into later\ngrade school that the world news became more and more important.",
        "Q: Did your parents talk that over with you? How aware were you of the situation\ngetting worse in Europe?",
        "A: We were aware because first of all we had the \u201cDes Moines Register,\u201d the\nstate paper that the folks read avidly, they would discuss it. We had radio news\nbasically as well, too. So I think probably as \u2014 as things were beginning to\ndevelop, I remember discussions of the Spanish Civil War, that would be what, in\nthe late 1930\u2019s. And then of course when the war itself began in the first or second\nof September 1939, why, we were much, much aware of it.",
        "Q: What was your personal reaction when \u2014 in September \u201939? Do you remember\nthat?",
        "A: Yes, I remember quite clearly because that morning, I remember coming into\nthe kitchen, the paper was there and Dad was very disturbed, having read the \u2014 the\nwar that \u2014 the word had come that \u2014 that of course as we remember, Germany had\nmoved into the \u2014 in-into \u2014 into Danzig, and then that the British gave the\nultimatum and I remember the talk, we all heard Neville Chamberlain saying that\nthey were given ultimatum, we have rece \u2014 [indecipherable] undertaking, so\nApril 6, 1999\nwe\u2019re therefore at war. I remember Dad being disturbed, Mother to a degree too,\nbut I-I think \u2014 I think maybe \u2014 maybe Dad was more evident about it.",
        "Q: And you were in what grade?",
        "A: Well, I would have been at that time, which was 1939, in \u2014 I\u2019d bega \u2014 I began\nschool as a five year old in 1930, so I\u2014 I would have been about the eighth or\nninth grade at that time, or in that period.",
        "Q: Did you feel threatened at all by that news?",
        "A: Not really, not really. That came a bit later.",
        "Q: Okay, so you continued to go to school in 1939.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: And your life did not change immediately?",
        "A: Correct, correct, but the real \u2014 the real change came in April of 1940, the next\nspring, during the first [indecipherable] of course it was the so-called static war,\nnothing happening basically. But it was in April, the next April, when Germany\nmoved into first Denmark and then the Scandinavian countries, and that was very\n\u2014 very meaningful because I remember so well of going over that morning to\nGrandma and Grandpa\u2019s, they\u2019re still living. This time they were in \u2014 1n the 80\u2019s.\nBut I can picture just as we talk right now, Grandpa Peterson sitting there in the\nsun in the early morning as if he were stunned. The war did come. And I said in\nApril 6, 1999\nDanish, Bedstefar [Danish]. Yeah, da \u2014 I'll put it sa \u2014 put it in Danish again.\n[Speaks Danish here] The Germans have Denmark. And then in English he says,\npoor little Denmark, she couldn\u2019t do a thing. She couldn\u2019t do a thing. And he just\n\u2014he\u2019d been in the German army, you se \u2014 oh, I\u2019m sorry, the \u2014 the Danish army.\nAnd of course it was a great history in the 1860\u2019s when Grandpa was in Denmark\ngrowing up, of the first \u2014 you know, th-the first war with Germany. And then of\ncourse the World War II is \u2014 World War \u2014 war was there also, but this was a really\ntraumatic thing for them. And we \u2014 we sensed that, we could see that in \u2014 in \u2014 in\ntheir \u2014 in their make-up, what was happening.",
        "Q: And did you respond in any way, did you feel threatened then, because of the\nconnection to your family?",
        "A: Oh, I think \u2014 I think not too much at that time. We knew things of course were\ngetting much more so because following that of course we recall Norway fell, and\nthen of course Germany moved into \u2014 in to the low countries and on and then of\ncourse there was a lot of awareness when the German [indecipherable] went\nthrough the Ardennes, to the great \u2014 the great shock and surprise of the French\nand British. And then of course the \u2014 the escape of the British at Dunkirk to get\nacross, we \u2014 that was a lot in the news, we were very, very aware of that.",
        "Q: So this is a young \u2014 as a teenager, you followed in the news.\nApril 6, 1999",
        "A: Quite a bit, because in school we would also \u2014 not by tha \u2014 by this time we\u2019re\ngetting into \u2014 into \u2014 into high school. I would have begun high school \u2014 I began\nhigh school, 1t would have been in \u2014 it had begun in 1939. I begun just that fall. In\nhigh school the current affairs magazines, the teachers were visiting about it back\nand forth, even though the war was still in Europe, of course, basically. But we\nwere quite aware of it, yeah.",
        "Q: Up to that point, did you have any Jewish friends, were there any Jewish\nfamilies living in your town?",
        "A: Yes. Yes. Polish friends as a matter of fact. I was in grade school with Marvin\nRichards, with Stanley Krazney(ph), both of Jewish \u2014 and some \u2014 and some\ngirls, too. So we \u2014 we \u2014 we had good friends that were, yes. We were just\nyoungsters, of course, but then on into high school we \u2014 we had number of Jewish\nfamilies in Council Bluffs, yes.",
        "Q: And did you read anything in the newspaper about what was happening to the\nJews in Germany in the 30\u2019s and so forth?",
        "A: To my recollection, nothing that I recall, no. Although I do recall Dad brought\nho \u2014 brought hom \u2014 brought home a story once from the office, very facetious, a\nfun story. He had some Jewish clients and th \u2014 interestingly enough, h \u2014 Dad\nrepresented one side, the other attorney in his o \u2014 the other people, and they were\nApril 6, 1999\nvisiting back and forth, the Jewish gentlemen ga \u2014 came quite involved back and\nforth. And finally as they left, the first group left, Dad\u2019s client remained, leaned\nover and says, can you blame Hitler? Can you blame Hitler? But that \u2014 that was a\nkind of a \u2014 of a joke sort of thing. But there had been word obviously at the time\nthat things were happening in Germany as far as anti-Semitic things basically, but\nno greater awareness at the time, I would say.",
        "Q: And no evidence \u2014",
        "A: As far as I would \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 of anti \u2014 and no evidence of anti-Semitism in your town?",
        "A: No, I think not. We had at that time a synagogue. The building 1s still there, the\ncongregation no long \u2014 but the \u2014 1-it was a fairly active synagogue. And I don\u2019t\never, ever recall at home any \u2014 any suggestion of anti-Semitism at all. The wa \u2014\nma \u2014 dad \u2014 Mother and Dad were both very, very liberal in attitude, and very, very\ntolerant. Matter of fact we had Jewish neighbors lived right next door to us. And\nthere \u2014 there was never, to my recollection, any reflection about them as\nindividuals.",
        "Q: Okay, so I assume then as things go on, you\u2019re a student at school, you\u2019re\nfollowing world affairs and then when \u2014 what happened when Pearl Harbor\noccurred?\nApril 6, 1999",
        "A: We got the word, of course, that Sunday afternoon at home. They\u2019re saying, we\ninterrupt this news [indecipherable] and so forth. A great \u2014 a great shocking\nthing. At this time, age 16, realized that not fully as yet, but it was going to affect\nus. The next morning in the \u201cDes Moines Register\u201d there appeared a \u2014 a \u2014 the\nname was Ding Darling, he was one of the leading cartoonists in the country, and\nhere was this \u2014 this drawing. It was of Uncle Sam kneeling, holding in his arms a\nsailor with a knife in his back. And Uncle Sam was looking up in fury and anger,\nshaking his fist at the departing Japanese aircraft. Powerful thing. I remem-mem-\nmember very well, and that\u2019s one of the first times I ever remember seeing Dad in\ntears, at that. And that was now Monday morning at home. At school, Abraham\nLincoln High School, our principal Mr. Kern, Gerald Kern, a \u2014 a very fine\neducator and he ran a tight school. He called the entire school body together, we\nwere in the \u2014 the big, large auditortum. He perceived in his wisdom how he\u2019Il be\naffecting us, and he had brought \u2014 he brought in a large floor model radio which\nwas up on the stage. And I can see him yet. The auditorium, large but couldn\u2019t\ntake all of them, so there were other students in the aisles, the balcony, the whole\nthing. And we sat there in dead silence, and Mr. Kern turned on President\nRoosevelt\u2019s war message. And how interesting. I thought about it over the years.\nOver \u2014 over the \u2014 the \u2014 the stage, on the proscenium of the stage, in large gothic\nApril 6, 1999\nletters in high school were, ye come to learn, go forth to serve. How rather\nprophetic looking back, huh, at those times. That was Monday and then of course\nduring the week, difficult. To drop back a bit though, the week before had been a\ntense week because I remember th-the \u2014 the \u2014 the [indecipherable] this country as\nwe recall, as the special en \u2014 envoys, emissaries and there were big pictures of\nthem in the paper, them smiling and very \u2014 you know. And then came the word\nabout it. But I remember when, during the end of the week as we\u2019re reaching \u2014 it\nwould have been in probably December fourth or fifth \u2014 third, fourth or fifth, that\nthe word came that they were re-reaching some kind of an accord, they thought \u2014 I\nremember saying to Dad, Dad, how lucky \u2014 a war with Japan would be terrible,\nwouldn\u2019t it? And then of course, came the events of Sunday and then Monday, of\ncourse, war was declared.",
        "Q: And so you went on with life as usual at \u2014 in \u2014 in high school?",
        "A: To a degree, but it was changing, because we realized things were indeed\nhappening, and they already had, to this extent. The National Guard had been\nalready brought into federal service by that time. I thi \u2014 I think that our local unit,\nwhich was the 168\" infantry of the na \u2014 34\" division had been mustered in in\nJanuary the year before. And we were aware of it because a number of the high\nschool student seniors were in the National Guard and they were gone. And I\nApril 6, 1999\nremember then, it was in the \u2014 May of that year, which would have been 1941,\nbefore the war, but here they made arrangements and I remember being in \u2014 I was\nin the band and orchestra, and it was always typical that we would play, the\norchestra, we would play \u2014 our \u2014 our school march was \u201cThe Pilgrim\u2019s Chorus\u201d\nfrom Tannhauser. And \u2014 and Mr. Kern liked it, 1t was very good. Much better\nthan \u201cPomp and Circumstance.\u201d But I remember being th \u2014 we were practicing\nand in came the high school seniors and I remember I was so, as a youngster,\nmoved, because here were four, five or six of the high school students now on\nactive duty, they were there in uniform, they came back to graduate. So that was \u2014\nSO We were very much aware of it. And to drop back to your other question, how\ndid it change? We were much aware, the \u2014 the high school paper, \u201cThe Echoes\u201d\nbegan having items more and more of classmates we had, or students who were\nnow in the service, in the military, back and forth. As well, at our high school we\nhad ROTC, junior ROTC, we were all in it, even band \u2014 band people had a\nmilitary band and the whole thing. So there was more emphasis all the time. I\nmean that things are going to happen, young people and you\u2019ve got training that\u2019s\ngoing on here, it\u2019s going to be helpful to you. So the \u2014 the high school paper as I\nsaid, was carrying more and more news about people who graduated, and where\nthey were training and so forth, so we\u2019re very much aware of it. And, may I add,\nApril 6, 1999\nthe school activities began to be directed. Junior Red Cross, for example, was\nhaving more projects. As \u2014 as youngsters, I was involved with the Boy Scouts, the\nBoy Scout project even at that time was collecting aluminum, s-scrap aluminum to\nget for the war effort. So we \u2014 were doing, things were happening.",
        "Q: Did you ever picture yourself in the army when you were young?",
        "A: Not immediately. You suddenly began realizing, as the senior class ahead of us\ngraduating, they were going in, that this was going to be happening to you. So\ngradually we recog \u2014 it was a part of it, and we were expected to do it and we\nknew it was coming by that time.",
        "Q: Was it a frightening prospect?",
        "A: No. I\u2014I think at that time there was so much \u2014 so much patriotism. You know,\nremember Pearl Harbor and so forth, and of course Germany declared war right\naway too on this, as you recall \u2014 as one recalls. So, I don\u2019t think \u2014 I don\u2019t think wa\n\u2014 it was a fearful project. Our feeling was everybody\u2019s in it, we will be too, and\nit\u2019s a part of party responsibility. It\u2019s a gr \u2014 a gr \u2014 a great sense of patriotism at that\ntime.",
        "Q: So would you describe yourself in the later high school years as a mature\nyoung person?\nApril 6, 1999",
        "A: I think fairly so. [indecipherable] to this. I had been the quote baby unquote at\nhome. Josephine and Robert were up, they were in college and so forth. And of\ncourse, you touch upon them actual \u2014 the war touching us, brother Robert was\nfinishing University of Iowa in law. He had finished in 1940. He went into the\nFBI initially, for a time, and then because he had an ROTC commission from\nIowa, he got a deferment and had a special service with the FBI overseas, but we\nwere aware of the war going on, very much indeed. So \u2014 and \u2014 but I, in my\nsituation, Mother always \u2014 she was very candid about it, she said that I needed to\nget out more and so forth. And it \u2014 I-I was, I think, a little bit sheltered at the time.",
        "Q: Did you talk about the war with your friends?",
        "A: Yeah. We \u2014 we did quite a bit. To drop back now, we\u2019re talking now 41, you\nsee the first real involvement that we knew about, was when the Marines landed in\nGuadalcanal in August of 1942. That was the first real, as I recall, over action by\nthe nation as far as being on the attack, that I remember offhand. So we were much\naware of that basically. Things were happening then too. And of course, as well,\nthe National Guard unit that I spoke of, the 168\" regiment, 34\" division was at\nCamp Claiborne, Louisiana and they were one of the first to go overseas, which\nwas a \u2014 yeah, they went over, went to north Ireland, I think it was in January of\n\"42. So the result is that all the hometown people were aware of their \u2014 their \u2014\nApril 6, 1999\ntheir sons, their husbands, brothers were \u2014 in the National Guard now \u2014 now were\noverseas now, so you began to feel it much more locally, that here were local\nhometown boys that had already gone over.",
        "Q: Had you heard anything in 1942 about camps, labor camps \u2014",
        "A: Not a bit.",
        "Q: \u2014 other kind of camps?",
        "A: Not a bit. As I recall \u2014 it\u2019s hard to loo \u2014 think back on that, and I don\u2019t think\nno-no-not a word about labor camps.",
        "Q: Had you heard about \u2014",
        "A: And even about concentration camps, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t recall any awareness of\nthat.",
        "Q: Had you heard anything about ghettos?",
        "A: Ghettos, yes, because of our history study basically that we knew \u2014 we knew\nhistorically, I mean, of the \u2014 the existence of the \u2014 the older \u2014 the European cities\nof \u2014 of ghettos, oh, I \u2014 I think particularly in \u2014 in Germany, the German ghettos.\nThe Rothschilds, it was a wonderful, interesting, th-the Rothschild family. The\nfilm, George Arliss was in it. They \u2014 we\u2019re talking the mid 30\u2019s now. And that\nbegan in the story of a \u2014 in \u2014 in, I think a ghetto in Frankfurt, I\u2019m not sure, but it\nApril 6, 1999\nwas new then, but we began reading about it, so we were aware of it on the matter\nof \u2014 matter of what it was, what they were.",
        "Q: Okay, now you\u2019re what, a senior in high school? And anything special about\nthat year?",
        "A: Junior, I mean basically then, I would have been, you see, a junior \u2014 yeah, I\nwould have been a senior, you\u2019re right in 1942, because then, all into the rest of\nthe year and then graduated 1943. I became \u2014 yeah, 17 in September of \u201942, that\u2019s\nright.",
        "Q: And what was your senior year like?",
        "A: We were getting closer to graduation obviously. I think, looking back, the\ncourses that we had, there was a real awareness of maybe boning up on your\nmathematics and so forth, that kind of thing basically because you might have\nmilitary. In the ROTC units, as I recall having a lot \u2014 a lot of training. If nothing\nelse, we learned at least close order drill and the manual of arms, if nothing else.\nSo that was it. And also, in school we were getting recruiting requests from the\nnavy, the army and so forth to get signed up to take tests basically, see if you \u2014 if\nyou could qualify maybe for some kind of a \u2014 of a \u2014 of a military education\nprogram, which there was a number of them. The navy had them, the army had\nApril 6, 1999\nthem and so forth. So we took tests now during that year to see 1f you could\nqualify for that. So we were heading 1n that direction.",
        "Q: And did you qualify for any of that?",
        "A: Yes, the way it worked, graduated in June of 1943. We\u2019d heard nothing back\nfrom the tests at that particular time. Some of our class, for example had already\ndone \u2014 signed up for submarine officer training and so forth, some for the air\nforce. I did not. I went to Drake University in June, just after graduation for about\n\u2014 it was about a month, six weeks. Drake, because it had been Dad\u2019s school, it\nwas a good school in Des Moines, and Dad\u2019s thought was, get as much education\nas you can before the military, which was exactly right. And then, after about six\nweeks there, I got word that I would be eligible for the Army Specialized Training\nReserve Program, ASTRP. Reserve being for those who had not yet attained age\n18 and you could go into the enlisted reserve, start off. And then, after finishing\none\u2019s first term, and when you reached your 18\" birthday or past it, then that term\nwould stop in school, you would be s \u2014 be \u2014 you would become a part of the army\nitself, be sworn in, have your basic training, then the program would come back to\nschool afterwards. All right, to drop back now, my particular group that I qualified\nfor, we were \u2014 I was still in Des Moines, Drake University. Down, I remember\ngoing downtown at the direction, and I had all the papers and so forth, I \u2014 in \u2014\nApril 6, 1999\nwent into the enlisted reserve, took the oath basically and so forth. And then\nterminated my work at Drake, went home and oh then two or three weeks\nafterwards reported to then Fort Crook for induction into the actual \u2014 the actual\nservice itself. Our group went to Kansas University at Lawrence, Kansas. And\nwe began our first tour of ASTRP, all reservists, we had \u2014 we had uniforms,\nROTC uniforms basically, the first part of August and we were there then with the\nfirst term of just basic engineering beginning supposedly, until we\u2019d accomplished\nour 18\" birthday. Mine was September 29\", you see. So I finished the first term,\nand then those of us that had reached age 18 then went home for a brief furlough,\nwe reported to Camp Dodge in Iowa, then sworn into the army itself, huh, and\nthen began our real army experience, because after the initial beginning in the\narmy you have just your uniform, your shots, your medical, the whole thing,\n[indecipherable] orientation, then you are sent to a basic training camp. And that\nwould have been then \u2014 that was just about the middle of November of 1943.",
        "Q: And wh-where were you sent for basic training?",
        "A: Fort Benning, Georgia. That was the training \u2014 th-the training camp. First of\nall, that was the so called infantry school for the United States, th-th-the \u2014 for\nhistorically that had been the \u2014 the headquarters of infantry training basically and\nGeneral Patton had been there basically, earlier years, quite well known. We went\nApril 6, 1999\nthere and began our basic training then, that would have been the first part of\nDecember of 1943.",
        "Q: And still, had you been aware in the previous spring, the Warsaw ghetto\nuprising in April \u201943?",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall it at all, no. That was in the spring of \u201943? No, I don\u2019t recall.",
        "Q: Okay, now you\u2019re in Georgia.",
        "A: Yes, ma\u2019am. Yes.",
        "Q: And can you just tell us a little bit about that.",
        "A: It was cold and damp, I recall that quite a bit. But it was something else\nbecause now we were in uniform full time. We began our actual basic training\nwhich at that time was a 17 year \u2014 a 17 week course. You begin the whole thing\nagain. Now, we\u2019d already had, to a degree we\u2019d had some military training at \u2014 in\nhigh school we had some, w-we had \u2014 we\u2019d had some at Kansas, KU, at\nLawrence. So we had the basic, we had alr \u2014 been through close order drill, we\nhad the manual of arms degree, but then you go through the whole thing and now\nfor the thirst \u2014 the first time you\u2019re in the barracks and so forth. Non-coms were\nokay, we were learn \u2014 our training company was in the area called the Harmony\nChurch area, which was the training area that we had for the AST people. We\nApril 6, 1999\nwere there and week by week the training went on basically, and we got underway\nin pretty good shape.",
        "Q: And then when you completed basic training?",
        "A: I had a mishap. I'll tell you. Measles was quite virulent. I never had measles.\nAnd I remember I got we \u2014 I \u2014 and this \u2014 we were pretty well down the line, we\nhad \u2014 we had \u2014 we had got rid of our training rifles, we had our new M1s, training\nfurther with them. And then the next \u2014 the next program was that we would hike\nout to, call it Caramouche, c-a-r-a-m-o-u-c-h-e range. It was a \u2014 oh, about a 10\nmile hike. We hiked out and we had a week tha \u2014 actually I think a week on the\nrange itself. And we had just finished \u2014 a week or 10 days \u2014 we had just finished\nthe last exercise, which was the infiltration course, where you crawl, you know,\nunder the \u2014 the firing machine gun bullets and so forth. A lot of very vigorous, you\nknow. That next morning I woke up and I was just speckled with\n[indecipherable]. And I remember th-that my non-com was there, I se \u2014Is \u2014I\nsaid, corporal, what \u2014 he says, Pete, you got measles. Into the hospital. Now the\nrule was that if a person, a trainee lost five days or more of basic training, he had\nto go back into an earlier training cycle, of people who had begun later, you see, to\npick up the time.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nApril 6, 1999\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Richard Peterson. This is tape number one,\nside B. And you were talking about the measles during basic training.",
        "A: Into the hospital, a fairly high fever, but I made it by about four days okay,\nback in, but because of technicality I had \u2014 I was told I would have to go back into\nan earlier cycle. I was devastated. Here I was, I\u2019d been with these \u2014 most of them\nmy friends from Kansas and all fellows I\u2019d known basically now \u2014 in basic,\nliterally, for over the last 10 weeks or so. And it was very \u2014 a really tough growing\nup process because these are the folks I\u2019d come to know and so forth, that I was\ntaken aback. But anyway, transferred back into another \u2014 another group basically,\nand we completed it. But then, the next thing that happened was this, we were just\nbarely finishing it up, word came from Washington that the AST prog \u2014 P\nprogram was being eliminated. They needed people carrying guns, not books and\nthe result was that not only the ASP \u2014 TP was being washed out, but also a\nnumber of Air Force cadets that had only gotten to a certain level, were also into\nthe infantry. Result was then that we were much \u2014 a lot of turmoil what\u2019s going to\nhappen. Mother learned about it, she was terribly upset, she wrote the\ncongressman and so forth, as if anything could be done. But that\u2019s the way it was\nApril 6, 1999\nand so we got packed up, we had finished pretty much of our training and we were\nthen shipped to the 86\" Blackhawk division, then training at Camp Livingston,\nLouisiana. So the trip then was from Fort Benning to Camp Livingston. There\nwe were met and greeted basically and then \u2014 and then began our training with the\n86\" division.",
        "Q: At that time you s \u2014 obviously spoke Danish, did you speak any German at that\ntime?",
        "A: A little, not \u2014 not much. My \u2014 my \u2014 actually, the few words I had I learned\nfrom Aunt Agnes who had been a German teacher, as I mentioned. My really\nsecond language if I have it was Spanish. Because I\u2019d had \u2014 well, first of all, I had\ntwo years of Latin, wonderful background and then two more years of Spanish in\nhigh school. So I could get along to a degree. My \u2014 and my Danish, I \u2014 I was\nrapidly forgetting, because that drifts away.",
        "Q: Okay, now you\u2019re with the 86\" in wa \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And you were trained to do what?",
        "A: Infantry. We were assigned to A company 342\" infantry. We were a \u2014 wh-\nwhich 1s \u2014 which, as I should add, a rifle company. To explain a bit further, in a\ndivision, infantry, about 15,000 men, one-half of those are infantry themselves, in\nApril 6, 1999\nthe form of three regiments. We were in 342\". The Blackhawk had regiments\n341\", second and third. And every regiment then would have three battalions. A\nbattalion would be composed of a headquarters company of the colonel, lieutenant\ncolonel ba \u2014 of the lieutenant colonel basically, of the \u2014 of the battalion. The\nheadquarters company had staff and there was a reconnaissance patrol and some\nother service. Then, in each \u2014 in each battalion beyond that, there were three rifle\ncompanies and a weapons company. And I \u2014 and I give this because it gives a\nbetter background for the future I think, too. A rifle company had approximately,\nin what was called the table of organization, TO, about 180 men commanded by,\nnormally, a captain. And then there would be a lieutenant, who is called the\nplatoon leader, for each of the four platoons. The \u2014 the three rifle platoons and the\nweapons platoon. And sometimes there would be another \u2014 another officer who 1s\n\u2014 be assistant \u2014 the assistant company commander. In our company it was Captain\nMitchell, and then we had the \u2014 th-the \u2014 the four lieutenants. Basically \u2014 trying to\nrecall base \u2014 the names we had ba \u2014 there was Lieutenant Hess, Lieutenant\nBudman(ph), Lieutenant Greenburg(ph). And those were basically the officers\nthat we had. Each platoon, rifle platoon was composed of three squads of 12 men\neach. Was the platoon sergeant, a platoon guy, like an assistant, the assistant\nperson. And then, for each squad, the squad leader was a staff sergeant, which is\nApril 6, 1999\nthe three chevrons and then the rocker underneath, an assistant squad \u2014 squad\nleader, who\u2019d be regular [indecipherable] and then the balance of the men will be\n12 [indecipherable]. Be two scouts, two patro \u2014 two [indecipherable] of two\nsquad scouts, a Browning automatic rifleman basically and other riflemen down\nthe line, too. So therefore each \u2014 each rifle platoon had those people. In the\nweapons platoon. separate, those \u2014 those were the light machine guns, and there\nwere two sections of those basically, with machine guns each and also mortars,\nwhich is 60 millimeter weapon, the tubes that fire the rockets, those thi \u2014 that\nwould be a rifle company. There was also each ra \u2014 in each battalion, a heavy\nweapons company, which would be the \u2014 would be the \u2014 the \u2014 the water cooled\nheavy machine guns, and the 81 millimeter mortars. And so that was basically the\nstructure of \u2014 of a regiment. And then we were A company of that, and I was in\nthe first squad, third platoon. I was a scout, okay.",
        "Q: And so then you were trained to be a scout and then you continued on to\nwhere?",
        "A: Exactly, we finished training, provisional training in February, March. Picture\nchanged because all of us recognized there were more people. Air Force people\ncoming in that had been washed out of \u2014 ne \u2014 not wa \u2014 that\u2019s the wrong te \u2014 but\nthey \u2014 they\u2019ve been transferred out of the infantry. So we began getting a lot more\nApril 6, 1999\npeople in and really the company was pretty much complete, the way it stayed\npretty much through, by probably May, June. We were then Louisiana, Camp\n[indecipherable] until \u2014 through July, went on maneuvers for the month of\nAugust and then the word came down that we were going to be transferred\nprobably out to California, the whole division for amphibious training, and that\u2019s\nwhat happened.",
        "Q: And?",
        "A: To California in September, we had about \u2014 been probably a span of two\nmonths of amphibious training, which was getting us ready for the south \u2014 the\nPacific. There\u2019s the small landing craft you see in the pictures of basically, you\nknow, like fre \u2014 quite a bit more. So we had a training camp, complete amphibious\ntraining. We finished that training at San Luis Obispo by mid-November.",
        "Q: 1944.",
        "A: 1944, exactly. Waited and then back after San Luis Obispo, we\u2019ve been in\nsouthern California, basically in San Diego, December 17\" began the Battle of\nthe Bulge, which changed the picture tremendously. Word came down we were\ngoing to probably be going to the east coast, going to Europe. The requirement\nwas they needed more troops in Europe because of the impact of the bulge.",
        "Q: You are now 19 years old.\nApril 6, 1999",
        "A: Yes. Important because at that time you had to be 19 to be qualified for\noverseas training. And interestingly enough, back in June, those who\u2019d already\nattained age 19 of our group, privates, wer-were transferred out, more people\nbrought in. But that was the rule at the time. So we were 19 at the time, exactly.\nThe division got the information, we were put on a \u2014 on an emergency basis of\npacking. We were put on special details, cutting wood and so forth to get all the\ncrates together, to get all the material crap together, put together. That was\nfinished up by probably about mid-January and we were on the troop trains headed\neast to our division the end of January of 1945.",
        "Q: And then?",
        "A: And then we went east, and we \u2014 our particu \u2014 all \u2014 all of our regiment,\nbasically, went to Camp Miles Standish, which is about 30 miles \u2014 was about 30\nmiles south of Boston. Coming from California, bright, pleasant, into the snow of\nMassachusetts, quite a change. New equipment, we got some new uniforms, more\nadditional equipment than we had basically. We were there probably staging for\nabout a week, 10 days, and then early in February, onto the trains, down to the port\nof Boston and we sailed from Boston in about \u2014 oh, th \u2014 maybe the second week\nof February.\nApril 6, 1999",
        "Q: By that time had you heard of anything \u2014 any news about labor camps, work\ncamps?",
        "A: Nota bit.",
        "Q: Death camps?",
        "A: Not a bit. On the matter of orientation, we all received from time to time, all of\nus have, the so-called why we fight series. That was a Walter Huston, as I recall,\nwas involved very much in that. And they were \u2014 they were \u2014 the first was why we\nfight generally and the whole history basically of the rise of Germany and Nazism\nand so forth. And then they would take it country by country, go into it. These\nwould be a series of documentary films we\u2019d have, as well as other films we were\nhaving on training, gas training and so forth, and f\u2014 and firing. But this was an\norientation series as I read it now, that really had been acted by Walter Huston,\ndirected by Capra, Frank Capra, he developed the whole series for the army, as I\nremember. So we learned why we were with England fighting, why we were\nbasically the free French, the Chinese [indecipherable] and the Russian. And\nthese were all good guys. And then the bad guys, of course, were the Japs. The\nmilitarism of the Japanese, and Pearl Harbor all over again and then of course in\nGermany the rise of Hitler and all the \u2014 the nasty Nazis and so forth.",
        "Q: Were you eager to go abroad?\nApril 6, 1999",
        "A: I don\u2019t know about eager. We were ready. We had trained completely and the\ntime had come. And I don\u2019t think that there was any question of eagerness. It was\na part of it. Maybe in the sense that we had friends and relatives and my \u2014 my\nsituation. My brother was by that time in military intelligence in South America.\nHe had acquired marvelous Spanish and so he became military intelligence,\nhowever \u2014 in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in the army. So we were ready, let me \u2014 let me put it\nthat way. And maybe the time had come, I \u2014 I\u2019m not sure. There was a lot of \u2014 get\na lot of \u2014 of patriotism about \u2014 to \u2014 to a modified degree. We \u2014 we were still in the\narmy, we complained and bitched, pardon the expression, but that was a part of it.\nBut our friends were over there, brothers, relatives overseas, so 1t was a part of it,\nit was expected.",
        "Q: Did you feel very old then? Older than your years?",
        "A: I felt \u2014 I felt more mature. I was no longer the baby of the family. I was one of\nmany, many people by that time, others of my \u2014 my \u2014 my peers, huh, and I was ar\n\u2014 I think probably more self c \u2014 more self confidence in myself and I know\nlooking back that the army made all the difference in the world to my growing up.\nBy that time, we\u2019re talking now, as I said, February of \u2014 of 1945, I\u2014 we had our\nfriends in our unit, good buddies and so forth. There was a lot of togetherness\nabout the whole thing.\nApril 6, 1999",
        "Q: And where did you dock?",
        "A: Our trip over was about 10 day \u2014 about 10 days, we \u2014 right at LaHavre. By\nthat time it had been secured, you see. Earlier it had to be brought in by\n[indecipherable] but this was right \u2014 right in LaHavre itself.",
        "Q: And then where did you go?",
        "A: We arrived \u2014 we debarked late at night, I recall, down onto the dock into great\nbig \u2014 big, huge trucks, large trucks. And I recall very well as we came down,\nwe're getting in. I went past the truck we were getting into. It happened to be the\none where our company commander, then Captain Mitchell was seated. And I\nrecall seeing Captain Mitchell looking up at the windshield, there was a bullet\nhole right through the windshield of the truck. Introduction. Before we had\ndebarked also, the guys, very juv \u2014 some are throwing candy bars over, and the\nsoldiers on [indecipherable] said, keep your candy, you\u2019re going to be dead in\nthree days. Well, ah \u2014 okay. All the trucks black at night, we drove over some \u2014\nthis is now LaHavre. We went, as I recall [indecipherable] and then on north to\nthe area called Old Gold. Now there were staging areas in France named for \u2014 for\n\u2014 for cigarettes. Old Gold, Lucky Strike, not as \u2014 but a large area. We were in the\nOld Gold area, which was right up \u2014 it was north of the town of Yvetot, y-v-e-t-o-\nt. The home of Madame Bovary in the novel, hm. Not \u2014 not Proust, but anyway \u2014\nApril 6, 1999\nMadame bo \u2014 however, we were about oh, eight or 10 miles north of \u2014 of Yvetot\nand as \u2014 right near a small French village called Normanville, n-o-r-m-a-n-v-i-l-\nl-e in large tents, large, large squad tents, cold and chilling. And we were located\nthere, staging for probably 10 days, two weeks, getting ready to go up to the front.\nSome more equipment, some more training. As is \u2014 as a\u2014 as a Squad scout I was\nsent with my fellow scouts up to so called mine, m-i-n-e school, up at Sassentot,\nS-a-S-S-e-n-t-0-t to learn about German mines. The teller, t-l-e \u2014 t-e-]-l-e-r mine,\nthat was like a plate [indecipherable] plate. The shoe mine, that\u2019s what you have\na \u2014 a variety of them. German explosives, Primacord, tetracord. Not th \u2014 we\nwould have much, but at \u2014 we theoretically, the scouts, you see, go out in front of\nthe squad to study the terrain and so forth and then the squad leader in charge\nbehind you controls your actions. So we had that, we were finishing that up and\nwe got the word, okay men, fold up your tents, we\u2019re going back, we\u2019re going to\nbe moving out, you\u2019re up tomorrow to the front. Back we went, down to\nNormanville and got ready to leave.",
        "Q: And you then went?",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "Q: And then you went?\nApril 6, 1999",
        "A: We left, of all things, down to Yvetot, loaded onto 40 and eights, the old World\nWar I style 40 and eights, 40 men or eight horses, yeah. Quarante hommes ou\nhuit chevaux. In the boxcars, they were [indecipherable] small, strewn with\nstraw, wonderful, because you could sleep on the straw, but there we were. So we\nleft by this \u2014 by the train. Some units I guess went by truck, but we went by train,\nup through Amien, on up to Namur. Now by this time we\u2019re up in \u2014 getting up\ntoward Belgium. This \u2014 this took two or three days, long time. Namur, Li\u00e9ge. We\nwent through just a very small part of \u2014 of the Netherlands at Maastricht, m-\ndouble a-s-t-r-i-c-h-t. And then I remember we got really, really something to\nthink about because boy I remember going through Li\u00e9ge, I-i \u2014 ]-e-i-g, I think, | or\nI-i, whichever. There on a \u2014 on a fencepost was a German helmet, just stuck on\ntop. Hm, first evidence. Then we began seeing signs of \u2014 of a lot of damage, either\nartillery or \u2014 or bombing damage of the city. There was \u2014 of course, Li\u00e9ge was one\nof the early areas where f \u2014 where fighting took place. And then really, because\nthat particular day twilight was falling, we had already gone through Maastricht,\nand were there stopped when there was a \u2014 a \u2014 at least a false alarm, they thought\nof a German, an air attack, because our anti-aircraft guns, which were out near the\n\u2014 near the \u2014 near the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the train yard \u2014 railroad yards, began go \u2014\nin an action getting \u2014 nothing happened, but they \u2014 we \u2014 we saw they were there.\nApril 6, 1999\nBut then at \u2014 twilight came and then it became dark and we went through Aachen,\nwhich had been terribly destroyed. The moonlight, I remember driving on \u2014 riding\non the train basically, looking out and seeing all of these ghostly white buildings\nout there, just \u2014 just the ruins, huh, of th-the \u2014 the destruction of Aachen. We \u2014",
        "Q: What does that do to a 19 year old from Iowa, to see that kind of destruction?",
        "A: You \u2014 it\u2019s pretty spooky. That was our first major di \u2014 war damage we\u2019d seen.\nIt was pretty spooky. I think we were getting pretty silent by that time, watching\nwhat was going past. I was on guard that night, which meant that you \u2014 the sentry\nseated there on the \u2014 tha-that open doorway, basically. And I saw a lot of it as we\nwent through and I think we had two hours basically and \u2014 but you watched and\nwent through. Still awake and I think it was probably mid-morning, black of the\nmorn \u2014 I mean, by \u2014 by two or three in the morning. We arrived at the city of\nDuren, d-u-r-e-n in Germany, we were in Germany now. Off the trains and on\nthe big trucks, which we call six by sixes. Six wheels and all six [indecipherable],\nth \u2014 we call them six by sixes. Out of the trucks and heading then \u2014 we left Duren.\nAnd they pointed out to us as we went through \u2014 went through a \u2014 a city square, I\ndon\u2019t know who pointed out to us, a statue there of a \u2014 of \u2014 I don\u2019t know what it\nwas. But earlier bombardment had been so intense that the statue, the bronze\nstatue had completely turned around. It had been facing one direction and now it\nApril 6, 1999\nwas facing the other direction. [phone ringing, tape break] On the statue, which\nwas of a bro-bronze, as near as we could tell, it\u2019s s-still dark in the morning, but\nthere \u2014 there were \u2014 there \u2014 there were truck lights. They pointed out the fact that\nit had apparently originally been facing on \u2014 to \u2014 t-to the west, but the \u2014 the\narterial bombardment they had had in Duren was so intense that it had just shifted,\nthe statue was facing east. Weird, weird. So here was dark, middle of the morning,\ncold, chilly. We \u2014 we were \u2014 we were course 1n \u2014 1n-1n-in March now. And out of\nDuren we drove, heading east toward Cologne.",
        "Q: What was it like to be in Germany when you put your foot down on German\nsoil? Did that have any kind of feeling for you?",
        "A: One had a -\u2014 one had a different feeling. We were there first time again on re \u2014\nyou know, on \u2014 on \u2014 on\u2014 on enemy soil. Lot of curiosity what it looked like\nStrangely, in my situation I kind of \u2014 could kind of relate back because of the tales\nof my Aunt Agnes and being in Germany and so forth and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and what\nlittle German she had, there were the signs and so forth we would see, you know,\nthe directional signs. I didn\u2019t know much German at all. I have a little more now,\nbut not that much. Then, of course, in the morning it began getting lighter, you\nknow, eerily morning. And began reli \u2014 we were driving through an area now\nheading east on the \u2014 a main, a fairly main roadway toward Cologne, which I\nApril 6, 1999\nthink probably was about, I\u2019m guessing 30 - 40 miles east of Duren. But here we\nwere, of course, basically in a truck going on east. We had seen, oh, forests to one\nside and then buildings. Then began to see a lot of bomb damage or some kind of\ndamage to buildings, basically. And then we probably got into Cologne, I\u2019m\nguessing, in the con \u2014 with the truck convoy by \u2014 by seven, eight o\u2019clock in the\nmorning, I\u2019m guessing. And that was something else. The \u2014 Cologne had been\nbadly damaged, and yet, way up ahead were the two huge spires of the Cologne\ncathedral. Some damage, but they were standing, they were still there. And then\noff \u2014 truck stopped off into the house, and then in \u2014 into houses, apartments where\nwe were being billeted. So then we were there in Cologne. Now, at that point\nsomething different happened. These were apartment houses, people\u2019s belongings,\nI mean their furniture and so forth. And somebody, strangely enough, began\ntossing the contents out of the windows into the central courtyard, just\nindiscriminately. And, was it the result of being in a foreign country, the enemy\ncountry? A strange thing but it just seemed to catch on and \u2014 and on just a \u2014 still I\nlook back and why in the world that was done, but a \u2014 just tossed to get rid of it, I\nguess, stuff out of the \u2014 out of the rooms, into the courtyard tha \u2014 then emptied the\nrooms out and we cou \u2014 we slept in them. A strange thing. I \u2014 I still wonder why it\nwas done.\nApril 6, 1999",
        "Q: Did you see any civilians, any townspeople? Were they affected by the war?",
        "A: In Cologne, people were all, I presume had been evicted or gotten out of \u2014\nbefore we came in. I don\u2019t remember seeing a lot of civilians in ca \u2014 where we\nwere in Cologne itself. Later, yes, bu-but not in Cologne itself.",
        "Q: Okay, and then how long did you stay?",
        "A: We were there, I\u2019d say oh, maybe oh, a couple days. I remember of that that we\nwere begin getting \u2014 we getting broadcasts from the BBC because their signal \u2014\nwell, we had \u2014 some guys had radios, I vi \u2014 it was that the \u2014 that tune about Bow\nBells, bum bum bum bum bum, buddle um bum, bum bum bum. That was the\nsignal of the BBC. [indecipherable] the Bow Bell, whatever, yeah. And we \u2014 then\nwe got the news from England, British accents and everything, oh yeah. Getting\nthings ready, I remember basically we were told we\u2019d be there a few days. I\nremember the day before we left, they took us all up, we went up to the \u2014 the attic\narea, huh. It was a la \u2014 fairly large area. And there we were briefed in. We had\nbeen designated as taper red able. Taper red able, code word. Taper was the 86\"\ndivision. Red, the 342\u2122, able, A company, hm. So that was the designation and\nthey told us what to expect. They meaning, I think it was Captain Mitchell and na\n\u2014 cap-captain \u2014 then Lieutenant Greenburg(ph), who we met. We were going to\nbe assigned, said they, up on the Rhine river, in of all things, the Ford factory.\nApril 6, 1999\nWas a major factory before the war that Ford had built and we were gonna be sent\nthere as our \u2014 as our location up on the Rhine, okay. Left fairly \u2014 as I remember\nwe \u2014 we left fairly early because we went in at nighttime and we relieved the eight\ninfantry division, which was already there, the men were there. And I remember\ngoing into the bunkers and we \u2014 and \u2014 and with \u2014 was \u2014 was rather wide-eyed\nbecause here were their old veterans, I mean you \u2014 they\u2019d been \u2014 th-the eighth had\nbeen in combat quite awhile. And different. They were a pretty rough, tough\noutfit. And amazingly, the first real eye opener when we got there, one of the\nmedics was there. Now, the medics, every platoon had a \u2014 had a \u2014 had a medic,\nhm, and they were not armed, their helmets had great big red \u2014 white circles with\nred cross. The medic that was with that particular group, in the \u2014 in the bunker\n[indecipherable] with eight \u2014 eighth \u2014 with the eighth \u2014 of the eighth division,\nstrange guys. Projecting out of his aid kit was \u2014 was a bone. Whether it was an\nanimal bone, but you know, that \u2014 that \u2014 well, really, where are we, what are we\ndoing here? Any event, the eighth then \u2014 the eighth \u2014 the men of the eighth\ndivision pulled out and we were then in place in the Ford factory. And that\u2019s\nwhere we saw our first \u2014 the first beginning evidence that we\u2019re having and that\nwe\u2019re in combat.",
        "Q: And again, up to that point you hadn\u2019t seen too many civilians.\nApril 6, 1999",
        "A: A \u2014 hadn\u2019t seen what, I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Q: Civilians.",
        "A: No. Some, but not \u2014 not \u2014 not \u2014 oh, maybe some people walking on the street,\nthat kind of a thing, but no-nothing \u2014 nothing to get tha \u2014 no, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: And then you stayed there?",
        "A: We were in the Ford factory, I\u2019m guessing probably about a week. That\u2019s\nwhen we first began to realize we were there because the Germans were our \u2014 on\nthe opposite side of the Rhine. Now we \u2014 we\u2019re now on the left or th-the \u2014 the \u2014\nthe west bank, all right. Germans on the east side. And the Rhine at that point,\nvery sizeable. I\u2019d say the Rhine was probably maybe a half a mile wide. It was\nwide. And we could look over and see there was a village over there. And we\nwould go up in the \u2014 in the \u2014 1n the \u2014 in the structure of the Ford factory. It was\njust as if the workers had walked away, there were big \u2014 there were rather big\nassembly lines, there were engines on the assembly lines being put together, but\nthey were all gone, but \u2014 and walked in, there was a great big [indecipherable]\ninside. Cologne, thanks to the second armored division, they\u2019d already bi \u2014\nsomebody painted it up there [indecipherable]. We were there, I\u2019d say, about that\nlength of time, but from time to time we were getting artillery coming in, just\nnuisance that the Germans had put across. Our fir \u2014 introduction to the 88, which\nApril 6, 1999\nwas the 88 millimeter ca \u2014 a remarkable weapon the Germans had. First of all, it\nwas \u2014 it was began, it was ta \u2014 it was tested in the Spanish Civil War by the\nGermans. It was anti-aircraft, could reach way up [indecipherable]. It could also\nbe a Howitzer, which is a \u2014 and a flat trajectory. And I remember that\u2019s the first\nexperience, I remember we would \u2014 the flat traje \u2014 that was really spooky because\nthe Germans would fire in and this sharp crack and that\u2019s the first you knew it\u2019s \u2014\nit was there. And it was \u2014 it was \u2014 it was frightening. That was our first\n[indecipherable] mm-hm. Okay.",
        "Q: And then, to continue.",
        "A: Yeah. We were there for about a week. Then we were told we\u2019re gonna be\npulled out and indeed we were. We were replaced by the 82\" airborne division,\nnow that had had experience already during the war. And as we \u2014 I remember as\nwe were walking out, marching out past the \u2014 past the cut \u2014 en-entry kiosk they\nhave there, in were coming men of the 824, we were on the outside, yes. And I\nremember walking past, looking up and there was this great big, tall, tall soldier,\ntwo big stars. It was General Gavin \u2014 Gavin. We saw him. Then we were pulled\nout into trucks and dropped, taken back into a German town some distance back.\nNow there we did see civilians for the first ttme. We were moved into the house,\nwe were supposed to be there for a day or so, something, til we\u2019re moved on\nApril 6, 1999\nfarther. But there was the conversation, what little German I had with \u2014 with one\nof the ladies there, because she \u2014 she was very upset, very unhappy. This 1s\n[indecipherable] this is your war, this is nicht unsere. This is not our war, this is\nzine(ph) war, this 1s your war, she was saying. But she wa \u2014 she was very, very\nupset about things. We didn\u2019t accept it of course, but that\u2019s the way it was. We\nwere there a limited time only and then we were take \u2014 put \u2014 back on the buses \u2014\non the bus \u2014 on the trucks again, six by sixes, and this was the long trip we had.\nThis was really, now will take us into Germany itself, okay. We left that suburb\no-of Cologne, but not until after we became aware of the first fatality we\u2019d had in\nour company. We had some injuries because as the Germans were dropping these\nshells across, one shell I recall, an 88 fell right into th \u2014 into the kitchen area and\ninjured, didn\u2019t \u2014 not badly, some of the cooks, shrapnel. And \u2014 an-and you had to\nwatch it because you could sometimes hear the shells coming in and you\u2019d duck.\nAnd that was pretty unnerving for \u2014 this was our first [indecipherable]. But then\nwe had learned and got the whole story, it was a \u2014 it was a bad situation, unhappy.\nSomebody, an officer had determined it was necessary to have an reconnaissance\npatrol across the Rhine. Why, I\u2019m not sure, but there \u2014 maybe to make a record or\nsomething, but they saw a set up and A company supplied \u2014 I was not in\u2014 A\ncompany supplied a number of the men, and went off at nighttime, boats, rubber\nApril 6, 1999\nboats across the Rhine. Lieutenant Henry, who \u2014 fine, he was a good man, of the\nfirst platoon, was in charge. The patrol was probably about \u2014 I\u2019m guessing\nprobably, I understand about 15 or 20, two boats. They got across and as\nreconstructed later they came back. Tell \u2014 the story came back and we were told\nthat they got over to the other shore, dark. Apparently there was \u2014 there had been a\nlot of firing and there was smoke drifting back and forth. And \u2014 and what\nhappened was \u2014 was one of those drastic, terrible things that happens in combat.\nThe two scouts moved out ahead. They were probably, as we get, maybe 10 or 15\nyards ahead of the patrol itself.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nApril 6, 1999\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Richard Peterson. This is tape number two,\nside A.",
        "A: The scouts had gotten out ahead, maybe 10 or 15 yards or so, and as we get the\nstory, the main patrol was behind them. The main patrol saw then, two figures\ncoming at them in the dark. They gave the password. The challenged party is\nsupposed to answer. The parties did not answer. Somebody in the patrol opened\nfire, only to discover afterwards it was the scouts coming back, our own people.\nAnd Corny Rippons was killed, he was one of them, the other I\u2019m not sure. They\ntried, apparently then, to carry Corny\u2019s body back. They couldn't get it all the way\nback and they had to leave him over there, basically, back they came. But that was\nour first \u2014 one of \u2014 one of those terrible thi \u2014 I mean, you know, the matter of the\nso-called friendly fire. As I think General Schwarzkopf said once, once the\nmissile leaves the barrel, it\u2019s no longer friendly. But it was a bad thing, so we \u2014 on\nthat \u2014 on that note then, we learned about that basically. And then \u2014 then after that,\nthe next day or so came our continuing trip on into Germany farther. To go and\npick that up, we left during the day, six by sixes again, the same trucks, parallel\ndown through Cologne itself and then on south to Bonn. And we\u2019re going through\nApril 6, 1999\nBonn, later of course, the capitol of the west \u2014 West Germany, a ba \u2014 interesting\nold town. I remember from Aunt Agnes\u2019 [indecipherable] that was the birthplace\nof Beethoven, here are these things coming back. We wound up someth \u2014 south of\nBonn and then onto a pontoon bridge to cross the Rhine. We crossed the Rhine\nthen at a pontoon bridge. We could see to the south what were called the\nDrachenfels, that\u2019s part of that \u2014 tha \u2014 of the other Wagnerian business. And there\nwere \u2014 there were \u2014 there were barrage balloons farther south. We learned later\nthat\u2019s the point where the first bridge had been captured across the Rhine at\nRemagen, it\u2019s quite a way south, but we saw the balloons. Then \u2014 now by this\ntime we were really now on the east side of the Rhine and moving deeper into\nGermany. We crossed several remarkably interesting roads, because they were\nautobahns that had built, you know, by the Reich in \u2014 and the Germans in the\n1930\u2019s as \u2014 as big work projects. We crossed them. So we got the ti \u2014 we got the\nword autobahn right away. But farther into Germany we began seeing more\nsigns of combat. There were destroyed tanks, American tanks and\n[indecipherable] tanks, too. We went through, oh I would say some 60 miles or\nso east, a major town called Siegen, s-i-e-g-e-n, and then we turned north up into\nwhat was called the Ruhr pocket, called that because about a week or 10 days\nbefore, two major American armored thrusts, armored divisions had moved east\nApril 6, 1999\nparallel to each other, about 60 - 70 miles apart, between them being the German\nRuhr, which was the great industrial area, and 1s, actually. Dusseldorf, Duren,\nEssen and so forth. Then, as these two armored thrusts went east, they began to\ncome together in out at area called Paderborn, p-a-d-e-r-b-o-r-n-e. They joined.\nThat became within that, what was called the Ruhr pocket. Then the plan\napparently was that they would \u2014 Americans, we would bring in reinforcing\ndivisions along where those two big pincers \u2014 p-i-n-c-e-r-s had come together.\nThe divisions would then, on the south side turn to the north, on the north side turn\nto the south and gradually converge to come together to eliminate the pocket. We\nwere one of those divisions. Other divisions were the 78\", the men of the eighth\ndivision, I\u2019Il come back that, that we had re-reinforced \u2014 replaced, they come into\nthe pocket. The 97\" division was there, on the south side. We were taken to a\nsmall town called Zimmersbach(ph) z-i-m-e-r-s-b-a-c-h \u2014 z-i-m-m-e-r-b-a-c-h.\nSmall, tiny, tiny town. We were billeted in a house, a great, huge manure pile out\nin front, typically of \u2014 of a \u2014 of a\u2014 of a German peasant area. A comfortable\nhouse, so we \u2014 we \u2014 it was good because we \u2014 the guys could find eggs and we\nfried eggs and so we were there a matter of two or three days getting final\ntogetherness and getting things ready. I remember nearby, it was a Sunday, we\nattended church, and one of the medics we had was a \u2014 a very accomplished\nApril 6, 1999\norganist who played the German organ there. I remember seeing in the front\ncemetery of the church there was some \u2014 some \u2014 some graves which had been\nobviously German soldiers buried there, I mean they [indecipherable] where they\nwere buried. Then \u2014 then we left that area, April eighth of 1945, we were taken by\nour six by sixes 1n the final \u2014 the final stretch \u2014 or we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re hiking, we\u2019re \u2014\nwe are on foot, into a wooded area, because we\u2019re getting ready to take off, as we\nsay, if we jump off in the attack the next day. So we\u2019re rowt \u2014 right up \u2014 right\npractically at the front. And spent the night there in bivouac, not tents, we just s-\nslept outside, basically. And then early the next morning we \u2014 we jumped off in\nthe attack. That would have been April ninth now, of 1945. To the north \u2014 nor-\nnorthwest actually, into the pocket. Then, next several days, our first major\nincursion into the area, the area was called Sauerland, s-a-u-e-r-l-a-n-d.\nSauerland, one word, I-a-n-d, because apparently the soil was \u2014 was \u2014 of all\nstrange things to know \u2014 but it was very rugged country, wooded. I-I-In the\ninfantry we say, excellent defensive terrain for the defender, huh. We moved\nthrough it. Not much was happening, however. The Germans were pulling back,\nthere was some occasional firefights there, not much. And I remember several\ntimes there, we \u2014 we did experience German mortars coming in as they were\ndefending, but not \u2014 not a great deal. It was a fast push, because we would be on\nApril 6, 1999\nthe way most of the time. We \u2014 at nighttime we\u2019d grab a few hours sleep if we\ncould, maybe in a \u2014 1n a\u20141n a\u2014I remember sleeping one night on the \u2014 on the \u2014\non the \u2014 on the kitchen floor. Another night we were \u2014 and that was lucky, we\nwere in a barn, and they had some straw. But pretty much we were pushing. And\nthat would have been Monday we jumped off, Tuesday that way. And then it was\non Wednesday, which was April 11 when we began \u2014 I si\u2014 remember seeing a\nsign in gothic print, Attendorn, a-t-t-e-n-d-o-r-n, three k-ms ahead. And that was\nwhen we began really approaching Attendorn and that\u2019s \u2014 that was our first major\ncombat.",
        "Q: And you \u2014",
        "A: We were on the reverse, or south side of a hill, in strength, meaning we were \u2014\nwe were \u2014 we were actually well reinforced, the whole thing. We \u2014 A company at\nthat time was the \u2014 was in the lead. To explain, I am the lead. Normally in a\nbattalion, if the battalion, for example is committed, two companies would be side\nby side, the third in reserve. And the same with two bi \u2014 there might be two ba \u2014\nbattalions there, and the third in reserve. At that time A company then, we \u2014 we\nwere leading in the attack into this town called Attendorn. And the result was, up\nthe hillside, I remember then around the c \u2014 as we made the curve on a roadway\nand began working through the trees, we looked across and there was a treeburst\nApril 6, 1999\non the distant hill. Let me explain treeburst. Artillery shells are so constructed,\neither number one, they\u2019re solid shells, or secondly explosive shells. Explosive\nshells are ones that have a very sensitive tip on the end. And the minute that even\ntouches any object, even a twig, it would explode. Very sen \u2014 and in a fa \u2014 in an\nartillery barrage, if the barrage is going into wooded area, as it would hit the trees,\nit\u2019d break and that\u2019s called a treeburst. Very, very dangerous because of the \u2014 the\nshell \u2014 shrapnel just spins right down. That was at a distance though, but \u2014 I\u2019m\nspeaking to you. Then we came around the top of the hill and then ahead of us, red\ntile roof and so on, was this very sizable town, which was Attendorn. We came\nup through \u2014 I si \u2014 the company, I mean basically, I remember we\u2019re coming past\nsome of the units of our cannon company, the cannon company and \u2014 the cannon\ncompany is a large, self propelled, it\u2019s a one-oh-five. Lieutenant Greenburg(ph)\nof our company at that particular time, was our assistant company commander, but\nhe also has some direction and control over the fourth platoon, the weapons\nplatoon, he was helping on that too. Weapons platoon then began setting up\nmachine gun for so-called covering fire because then we got the order and our\nplatoon, third platoon began going down a rather steep hill on the run, on the\ndouble, rifles up well, ther-there ha \u2014 we call porter, to attack the town. And then\nwe began getting a lot of fire from the Germans 88s. We learned afterwards that\nApril 6, 1999\nthe entire Ruhr was so much attacked by allied aircraft that they had a tremendous\namount, the Germans, of anti-aircraft material. 88s and 20-20s. When there were\nno longer these air attacks because the stage the war, they would simply level\nthose and use against the aca \u2014 ca\u2014 oncoming Americans. So we had a lot of \u2014 a\nlot of 88s coming in, artillery. There was a 20 millimeter ak-ak, and as we started\ndown the hill, 3\" platoon began taking casualties. We had a sergeant who was\nkilled, our lieutenant was injured. Several others were injured down the late \u2014 way,\ntoo, basically. This was, as I said, our first real experience of combat. And it\u2019s a\nstrange thing. You\u2019re there, it\u2019s happening to you, and yet fortunately, because of\nthe discipline you\u2019ve had, you \u2014 you\u2019re scared, right down in the pit of your\nstomach, but \u2014 but y-y-you do it, you go on. Then into this house right nearby \u2014 I\nsa \u2014I say, then, a number of us. And then Dave Sargent(ph) \u2014 Sergeant Dave, a\nsergeant, I remember, was outside, he said okay, because then the next thing we\nhad to do out of the house, Dave directed us down the hill, we went on down the\nhill to cross a river, a small stream, waist high. Cold, though. Up the other side\nbasically and I\u2014 I\u2014I\u2019d had \u2014 I forgot, basically, but my sergeant says, Pete,\nyou\u2019re the first one across. So I crossed the river, up onto the other side, cold,\nrifles held high to keep them dry, and there was sniper fire coming in over the\nrailroad. Then across the railroad, we got across okay, but you get \u2014 for the first\nApril 6, 1999\ntime you\u2019re getting some vicious snapping \u2014 you know, th-the \u2014 or sniping,\naround. Then it seems that the Germans must have pulled out. We learned\nhowever, later on, that one of our men, fourth platoon was asked and did, because\nhe had good German, go in with a white flag and their at \u2014 their \u2014 see if they\nsurrender. The company man who thought they might. They wouldn\u2019t. The name\nwas Bob Oelke, o-e-I-k-e. The Germans ignored the white flag, grabbed him,\ntossed him in the cellar. With presence of mind he went into the next room,\nbecause they tossed in some grenades after him, he was alright, he later escaped.\nBut that we learned later. Into the town and then we began moving through. We,\nmeaning the third platoon, we were still there. Now, at that time, as we moved\nalong, by this time it\u2019s probably three, four in the afternoon. Cobblestone streets,\nrifles on the ready, covering each other. This is called a mopping up operation. But\nthe Germans seemed to have pulled out \u2014 I mean, I don\u2019t remember anything more\nat that time. And it was then, as we were going up this cobblestone street\n[indecipherable] that we approached a factory area. Obviously there was some \u2014\nand then behind this barbed wire fence were these people, unkempt, dirty,\nemaciated and Mac \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, MacGilvery(ph), in charge, I was behind him,\nwent up and opened the gate. Now, at this point I must explain that for some\nreason, for some reason, I do not personally recall Mac opening the gate, but I\nApril 6, 1999\nhave talked to him, I say Mac is Sergeant MacGilvery(ph) of Dallas, Texas. He \u2014\nhe had detail \u2014 details I'd forgotten. Strange about memory, some things you \u2014 but\nMac is very explicit that he\u2019d opened the gate. The people were in there. They\nrealized apparently we\u2019re Americans, uniforms ra \u2014 they began crowding out and\n\u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and trying to embrace us, and \u2014 and \u2014 and kiss us apparently. I\ndon\u2019t recall that. But one thing that was pervasive apparently, and this was\nconfirmed by \u2014 by sar \u2014 Dave Sargent, there at the time, sergeant and later on by\nLieutenant \u2014 then Lieutenant, now Captain Greenburg(ph), horrible, heavy, heavy\nstench and odor. Again, I \u2014 this I didn\u2019t recall and I\u2019m surprised because I\u2019m\nnormally pretty aware of olfactory things. But 1t was there, amb \u2014 obviously. What\nI do recall though now, very clearly, myself. We had gone into a nearby building,\nbecause Mac\u2019s determination was we gotta \u2014 gotta watch out for whate \u2014 there\nmight be krauts around. Kraut being the derogative name for German. There\nmight be krauts here, they gotta check it out. And I remember stepping into the\nbuilding now, and I think it \u2014 it was a large room, maybe 50 by 50 or so. And I do\nremember there were \u2014 there were some bodies lying around and I remember Mac\nstarted to walk over across the room. Now, 1n his detail, Sergeant\nMacGilvery(ph), Mac said that there was a skull that he recognized, it \u2014 he \u2014 he\u2019s\nfrom Texas. It was horse\u2019s skeleton. And walked over. This I remember too, beca\nApril 6, 1999\n\u2014 he walked over and there was an old \u2014 to me appeared to be an old woman,\ncrouched down, holding something. And \u2014 and Mac was over there, paused for a\nmoment, came back, fury in his eyes and said, now I\u2019m being explicit. Those\ngoddamn fucking krauts, look how they treat these poor sons of bitches. The lady\nis scraping out that horse\u2019s skull for food and eating it. Gee, well. He also said,\nforget about the goddamn horse, they\u2019ve scraped all the meat off that too. There\nwas a heavy \u2014 I remember it now, this at \u2014 there was a heavy odor and \u2014 and we\nwalked past and \u2014 and there was a body. I\u2019m not sure dead or alive, but \u2014 but \u2014 but\nMac pointed out the face and he \u2014 he \u2014 look at that poor son of a bitch\u2019s legs, they\nwere \u2014 they were apparently gangrenous and this heavy odor must have been\nputrid-putri-putrefaction, I\u2019m guessing. Back out into the street, fresh air thank\nGod, because all the other \u2014 and on back out and I remember we got back out in\nthe street and as our patrol got back out there, somebody behind me was throwing\nup, one of our guys be \u2014 just \u2014 just the impact of it. And Mac said, and I did\nremember this, that a lot of \u2014 they were laborers mostly, whatever, you know\n[indecipherable] people were out in the street, they just kind of wandered out, the\ngate was open. A \u2014 an officer came along and advised that we had to get them\nback inside because they needed attention, whatever. And they could not be\nwandering the street by themselves, so somehow, and I don\u2019t recall, they must\nApril 6, 1999\nhave been herded back in, because after that then we \u2014 we moved ahead and we\nwere on our way after that.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk a little bit more about that experience before we move ahead.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you try to talk to any of these prisoners?",
        "A: Not \u2014 not that I remember. Now, in my \u2014 in \u2014 in my notes \u2014 and I mention\nnotes because \u2014 I-I must go ahead, I\u2019ll fast \u2014 fast forward a moment. When we had\ngotten back from Europe, we had a 30 day \u2014 a 30 day furlough. We were the first\ndivision back from Europe, big welcome, but we have 30 days. And during that\ntime I sat down and typed out my \u2014 a log. Now in \u2014 in that log that I have \u2014 I-I got\nit \u2014 well, of course, it was so fresh then. I c \u2014 I could do it day by day and the\ntowns, the names of towns and guys names. I showed basically in that \u2014 and if I\nmay refer for a moment to this. This \u2014 this isn\u2019t my original log. And turning now\non it to April 11\", and here we are at Attendorn. I am showing here things that\nI\u2019ve touched upon quite a bit before, some other details that don\u2019t relate to this, but\nas to this particular matter, through the houses, as we\u2019re going up the street, into\nthe town. Pillbox warehouses, first platoon to our right flank, went through houses,\ncapture of a German ak-ak crew in the photo shop. West and south along the\n[indecipherable] past the bridge to the left, with an 88 covering, okay. Through\nApril 6, 1999\nthe factory into \u2014 I [indecipherable] a Russian prisoner enclosure. Now, whether\nwe were told they were Russians, I have no recollection o-of the \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t\nknow Russian probably, well if I\u2014 you know, I could guess, but \u2014 when I\u2019d heard\nit basically. And I don\u2019t recall any conversation with the people.",
        "Q: Did any of them try to touch you?",
        "A: I don\u2019t \u2014I don\u2019t recall that, but Mac in his recitation says that they were trying\nto grab us and so forth. We probably pushed them off. Again, this heavy, terrible\nodor, and \u2014 and \u2014 and Lieutenant Greenburg(ph) who was there at the time, and I\nhadn\u2019t realized this, he said it was caused probably, mostly from lot of \u2014 the\nlatrines. The latrines were only ditches dug there, said captain, about 30 - 40 feet\nlong, full of excrement and \u2014 an-and \u2014 and other elimination that caused this\nterribly heavy odor that was there. But as far as \u2014 I don\u2019t recall the touching, but\nMac says that they were trying to grab us.",
        "Q: Were they wearing civilian clothes?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Th-These were not \u2014 these were not prison type uniforms\nat all. They just seemed to be, as I remember, just civilian clothes, but rags \u2014\nragged, torn and so forth.",
        "Q: These were men and women. Were there any young people, or mostly \u2014",
        "A: I do not recall \u2014\nApril 6, 1999",
        "Q: \u2014 age-wise?",
        "A: \u2014 seeing any young people. Now Mac mentions that there was an episode, a\npart of that we left there, said he that there was a woman who apparently it was a \u2014\nhad been a prisoner, who \u2014 who apparently was \u2014 was getting at and be-beating up\na German woman who may have been a guard. Now, as near as \u2014 apparently there\nwere both men and women there. Whether they were housed together, I-I have no\nidea.",
        "Q: How long were you there?",
        "A: Not long. My own recollection was that \u2014 that our \u2014 our going into the room\nwhere the \u2014 the horse\u2019s skeleton was, probably three, maybe five minutes at the\noutside, because it was, as I said, Mac got right over, saw what it was, and we just\nleft pretty quickly. There were no German soldiers at all to run \u2014 there \u2014 there \u2014\nthere \u2014 the Germans had pulled out apparently \u2014 apparently. So we were out of\nthere within oh, I\u2019d say probably five minutes. A little longer, then probably get\nout of the compound, back out on the street again.",
        "Q: Did you try to feed any of them? Give them any food?",
        "A: Not too my knowledge. Not to my knowledge. The situation has been really\ndefined by Lieutenant, now Captain Greenburg(ph) quite well. When, as we look\nat it in the context of that whole day, we had had a drastic experience coming in. I\nApril 6, 1999\nmean, the \u2014 we \u2014 th-the fighting and so forth, and the weaponry. And \u2014 and \u2014 and\nthis was just one other part of it, and \u2014 and it did not really assume any great\nimportance until a more recent time, when we realize now, seeing what was\nhappening elsewhere in Germany, the scenes we\u2019ve seen of the death camps.\nNow, there were \u2014 I\u2019m told \u2014 historians \u2014 a good friend who\u2019s an historian says\nthat there were no death camps up in the Ruhr. Slave labor camps only, which \u2014\nwhich apparently the Germans had established the industry to set little satellite\nareas where prisoners would be required that th \u2014 th-the labors to build parts or\nsomething of that type, which would then be taken in and used by the German\nindustry in the major cities of Diisseldorf, whatever. But that was a part of \u2014 of the\nwhole program. But, backing into their appearance, there was emaciation basically\nand \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 but the \u2014 but the \u2014 that the clothes, they were wearing\nrags, tags, but they were not uniforms, as I recall. Just not uniform types.",
        "Q: Was it a frightening experience for you to see people in this kind of condition?",
        "A: Very different. Different. I don\u2019t know that it was any more frightening than\nwhat we\u2019d already had, I mean in the combat side of it, you know, from the firing\nand so forth. I-I think \u2014 I think it was just, we accepted it, but without really\npaying a great deal of attention to it at the time. I mean, it was there, we saw, it\nwas there basically it was bad, it was horrible.\nApril 6, 1999",
        "Q: Did it make a difference to you that these were civilians?",
        "A: It was different in the sense that the \u2014 the \u2014 these were not combatants, not\ncombatants, and how they could be used that way, later on upon reflection, you\nrealize, yeah. At the time, that\u2019s the way it was, but then you begin to think about\nit afterwards and yeah, there\u2019s a part of the \u2014 the incongruity of it, I mean, the fact\nthat they were simply civilians, I would say.",
        "Q: You said when you walked out, one of your fellow soldiers got nauseous. Did\nyou all talk about what you had just seen? Did anybody say anything to the other\nperson?",
        "A: Oh, the usual. The usual oaths and so forth and expressions of you know, to put\nit bluntly, Jesus Christ, what the hell are we seeing, what was \u2014 well, all \u2014 all \u2014 all\n\u2014 all \u2014 without going \u2014 becoming too explicit, but you get the idea, I mean, gee, I\nmean, my God, it \u2014 1t was \u2014 it was an incredible thing, yeah. I suppose the \u2014 the\npassage of years puts a \u2014 puts a different complexion on it. I know that \u2014 that as\nfar as other parts of combat, guys were killed, we recognized it, accepted it. And I\nrealized, it wasn\u2019t until maybe after getting home, the 30 day span of time, it really\nbegan to come back of what we had been through and seen. I wonder if probably\nin that situation you \u2014 you \u2014 you develop a sort of an inurement to that. I-I know\nthat was our discipline, held us together despite the fear, the terror. And \u2014 and \u2014\nApril 6, 1999\nand \u2014 and \u2014 and to be, for example in a \u2014 1n a -- an artillery barrage is a \u2014 1s \u2014 1s \u2014\nis \u2014 1s a gut grinding \u2014 you know, experience. But we were there, and \u2014 and \u2014 and\nit was a part of it. Some guys \u2014 we had a few that \u2014 that chickened out, that\ncouldn't handle it. My sergeant \u2014 not \u2014 not \u2014 well, not \u2014 not Mac, he was fine, but\nmy own squad sergeant, we got through Attendorn, if this is a part of what you\nwant, we were talking about, we got through Attendorn to the other side, came\nback on the same railroad again, dropped down to take a few minutes break\nbasically, and then Sergeant Markson(ph) from Iowa, good chap, and my own\nsergeant, George Evans just flopped down. George was ashen. He said, I can\u2019t\ntake this shit, he says, I\u2014 I can\u2019t do it. Bud came down pretty \u2014 he said, George,\nGod damnit, you got the stripes, this is our job. And maybe that did it, but \u2014 but \u2014\nbut \u2014 but he \u2014 geor \u2014 he was out of it. Now, I think he got put back together\nhimself a lit \u2014 later on. But \u2014 but at the time, he couldn\u2019t. It happened, and you\ncouldn\u2019t \u2014 from unexpected persons, it ha-happened. You would have expected\nsome others, who you think might be washouts, did well. It \u2014 it \u2014 1t \u2014 th-there\u2019s no\nrule of thumb. But that was a particular experience at that time. You speak about\nthe matter of what we had seen and so forth. I-I don\u2019t know, there wasn\u2019t a lot of\ndiscussion afterwards, we went through it, that was it. Other things were taking\nApril 6, 1999\npriority. I mean, you know, your own safety and your own welfare and what was\ngoing to happen next.",
        "Q: And then what did happen next? You left the town of Attendorn and then\nwhat?",
        "A: We stayed there that night. We finished through the town probably by six,\nseven o\u2019clock. We were assigned there and the next thing that they \u2014 that the \u2014\nCaptain Mitchell did was to establish a guard perimeter around the hills around\nthe town. So the nor \u2014 the north hilltop. And Sergeant Evans and myself and\nFrank Horn went up to one hilltop and were there that night. And that-that was\nthe night later on that we got machine gun fire in the black of the night and \u2014 and\nin the topography of it, on the hilltop, George above me and to the north, Frank\nHorn above me a bit and to the south, and I was down. Machine gun fire, George\nwas \u2014 was killed almost immediately and Frank so badly shot up in the back, he \u2014\ntha-that \u2014 that \u2014 back to battalion aid and died several days later, I guess. All I got,\na \u2014 incredibly fortunate, just a flesh wound in my \u2014 in the \u2014 my \u2014 in my left leg.",
        "Q: You are 19 years old, how did you feel \u2014 how old did you feel after that day\nand that night?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t realize what had happened about getting a \u2014 th-th-the [indecipherable]\nmy leg, until the next morning. We came off the hilltop that night. Our \u2014 our \u2014 our\nApril 6, 1999\nmedic Hank Billskey(ph) was right there, I see him now, he was right there,\namazing, after this happened. My captain, Captain Greenburg(ph), who is here in\nWashington with me, we\u2019ve had [indecipherable] we talked about that this\nmorning. He was describing some of the things that happened to him, so \u2014 these\nclose calls. Friend he had been in OCS with was killed with a treeburst about\nthree or four feet away from him. And as I told him, I said, Captain, I can \u2014 I can\nsit here and right now, I ca \u2014 I can hear \u2014 I can hear George gurgling as he was\ndying. I can hear \u2014 I can hear Frank \u2014 when Billskey(ph) got there he said, I need\na sa\u2014I need a syrette. That \u2014 that was a morphine syrette. An-And Hank says\nmy God, he said, good for you. In \u2014 in it \u2014 he \u2014 he co \u2014 he could name it\n[indecipherable] right there. So, it could come right back, I don\u2019t know that there\nwas any particular sign of aging at the time. I-It doesn\u2019t \u2014 it doesn\u2019t come that\nperemptorily. You realize after you\u2019ve gone all through these things that \u2014 that \u2014\nyou know, you had them. Bur as far as an immediate recognition, it\u2019s just a part of\nthe whole damn thing.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B\nApril 6, 1999",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Richard Peterson. This is tape number two,\nside B. And you were talking about your reaction to the \u2014 that day and night.",
        "A: A-As commented, I think \u2014 I think that at the time there is a \u2014 there \u2014 there 1s\nan insulation, I suppose, that is given you by your \u2014 your discipline that you have,\nto a degree. Other things become so drastic that you \u2014 something I suppose, maybe\nmentally helps block them out. To get through them you have to. Maybe, as I\nsuggested, it was only after getting back in a peacetime setting like the \u2014 our har \u2014\nour months furlough. And I remember it happened when I was home, after we\u2019d\ngotten back from Europe, th-the month between, we went back several times, I ca\n\u2014 I kind of \u2014 and I-I-I know that the death of a couple guys swept back. George,\nFrank\u2019s did, some others we had then too, the \u2014 just the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the\nimmensity of it. After those experiences, you\u2019re do \u2014 you do have dreams and\nnightmares. I had \u2014 it\u2019s diminished greatly over the years, but after first getting out\nof the service, an-and let me just finish perhaps by the German experience, we had\nthat then. Then we also had some more drastic experience. We were the second\ncompany, the second American company in the whole army to cross the Danube\nfarther south. A company from the 103\" division to the southwest, crossed in the\nmorning of the 26\", and we crossed the night of the 26\", so by \u2014 by an English\nApril 6, 1999\n[indecipherable]. And we lost a number of people there, and a lot of \u2014 quite a few\nwounded. Some wounded. But it\u2019s after then as I discovered, getting back over\nthere, I would have occasional dreams that would be quite frightening. I\u2019d wake.\nThey\u2019ve diminished. And yet even now I do have a recurrent dream which is that \u2014\neither \u2014 I\u2019m either going to be going into the army again, or I\u2019m in the army again.\nAnd I find that I have a feeling of concern, of fear, if you please. And terribly glad\nto wake up to realize that it is not happening again. That 1 \u2014 that has come\nsometimes. The most drastic thing recently was to have seen the movie \u201cSaving\nPrivate Ryan.\u201d Now, I\u2019ve talked to my company \u2014 Captain Greenburg(ph), he\u2019s\nseen it too. Every \u2014 every combat veteran I\u2019ve talked to has had a similar\nexperience, some more, some less, but I remember, to see it, the first oh, five\nminutes is in the cemetery, but then \u2014 then you begin \u2014 then one begins seeing the\nbeginning of D-Day with the small craft, the landing craft coming in. Now, we\nwere not D-Day of course, but we did have the training in amphibious. And it was\na remarkable thing because as I watched that in the darkened theater \u2014 my sa \u2014 Pat\nwa \u2014 wife Pat did not go. As I watched that and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and the camera, for\nthose who will see it recall that you saw the boats from the side and then that\nmoved over and panned right into the boat itself, and you\u2019re looking at the men.\nHanks, the captain and the ca \u2014 played the part of the captain. I was there again. It\nApril 6, 1999\nwas like it was our platoon going in. The \u2014 the roar of the motors, the spray of the\nspray coming over the top. Guys being \u2014 throwing up around you. The gear all just\nthe same, basically. And I began to cry, just this weeps and then when, in the\npicture, the craft hit the shore, the ramp went down, typical training, and then the\nGerman artillery, the mortars opened up, machine gunning the whole \u2014 I found\nmyself audibly crying, I couldn\u2019t help it. And I\u2014 ve \u2014I\u2014I-\u2014I have a free\nsample, Captain Greenburg(ph) who you [indecipherable] have met said he had\nthe same experience. That he \u2014 he had that happen. He \u2014 he w \u2014 he was weeping.\nAnd to drop back to our experience, the lieutenant who had taken the platoon\nacross the Rhine that I spoke of earlier, who had both the command responsibility\nof that group, a terrible burden to take back. After our first reunion of our\ncompany, he attended, it was back in \u2014 okay, it was Council Bluffs, my home. We\nhad them there in 90 \u2014 \u201995 and 97. In \u201995 for the first time, cap \u2014 Lieutenant\nHenry came. Now a doctor in Dallas, a \u2014 a very, very fine, but rather sensitive.\nAnd we visit a lot and he talked about that experience, the patrol across the Rhine.\nI had for Lieutenant Henry, after he got back home, a very gracious letter\nthanking us for \u2014 my wife and I. But he went on to say, the value it was to him to\nvisit with comrades-in-arms of years ago, to just hear about, that \u2014 that it \u2014 he\nunderstood things better and that it relieved from his should \u2014 from his shoulders\nApril 6, 1999\nthe burden of guilt that he\u2019d felt all these years. One good thing about reunions,\nthey helped. I talked to him, we were at ak \u2014 our division reunion in newy \u2014\nLouisville last September and he\u2019d seen the movie and he said it \u2014 I shouldn\u2019t\nhave, he said, it put me back again. So I think seeing the par \u2014 again, after all these\nyears, it comes back. And you wonder \u2014 what little I read of psychology on it, they\n\u2014 we\u2019re told in psychology that \u2014 that these memories are latent, that certain things\ncan trigger them off. Example, the \u2014 the \u2014 the smell, the odor. I can stand on a\nstreet corner today, pass those \u2014 a diesel bus and the diesel fumes take me right\nback to our training days when the \u2014 the diesel of the outfit. And yet on the other\nhand, come back to it, I don\u2019t remember anything about the terrible stench at\nAttendorn. Strange. And I don\u2019t know. My one thought, it might be that \u2014 who\ncan tell about these things? It may have been a reaction to what \u2014 that night, later\non when we were close to death, or the others were close to death and sa \u2014 I \u2014I\ndon\u2019t know. I-I \u2014 I-I do not have the wisdom to answer that.",
        "Q: Your \u2014 you\u2019re saying that one may have superseded the \u2014 the following?",
        "A: I\u2014I- yeah, I\u2014I\u2014I-I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Where were you when President Roosevelt died?",
        "A: Very interesting question because we learned about it, 1t was the day after the\n12\" of course, after the night the bad \u2014 we were \u2014 we were in \u2014 we were in \u2014 in\nApril 6, 1999\nreserve at that time in Attendorn. And I remember that they \u2014 they kind of got us\nall together basically and we had the \u2014 had this word that \u2014 that he died, and I\nremember it was, who the hell is Harry Truman? I didn\u2019t ta \u2014 he\u2019s our new\npresident is who he is. We know \u2014 we didn\u2019t know much about him basically, but\nit was \u2014 it was \u2014 you know, it \u2014 it was \u2014 it was different. Of course you \u2014 I\u2019ve seen\n\u2014 we\u2019ve all seen the pictures of, in this country when all the \u2014 all the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014\nthe \u2014 the weeping, I mean, and then \u2014 and the \u2014 and the sorrow and so forth. I\ndon\u2019t think, frankly, it made a lot of differ \u2014 I mean, he \u2014 so be it, I mean, it\nhappened \u2014",
        "Q: Wasn\u2019t a sense that you had lost your commander in chief?",
        "A: No, I\u2014 no, no, no. Things were gonna go on, you know.",
        "Q: And then what \u2014 what did happen to finish up your experience?",
        "A: We had passed that in Duren and then as I said, we were transferred then, the\npocket was finished, closed. We went by motor march at night. We were\ntransferred from the first army to the third. And the first night going down in the\nblack of the night, one of the trucks went off the road, not ours. We had several\nmen killed quite a few injured on the [indecipherable] down and then we went to\n\u2014 in the area called Franconia. Went through Wurzburg in Franconia. We\u2019re\nthere and then we \u2014 then we jumped off in the attack again. By this time we were\nApril 6, 1999\nin Patton\u2019s third army, transferred. Went down through the area, cities of\nEichstatt, to Ingolstadt. Ingolstadt was more trouble, was difficult. The back \u2014",

        "A: DPs as well, too. As we moved farther down and got into Bavaria, we saw\nquite a few more civilians. And saw quite a few displaced persons, as you\nmentioned. On the roads, moving, traveling, wherever they might be going. At the\ncity, the town of Eichstatt, different because our company commander Captain\nMitchell was ill, and then Lieutenant not Captain Greenburg(ph), then age 22\ntook over the company, and he had the responsibility of 200 men there were\n[indecipherable]. And we had \u2014 we had it \u2014 a\u2014 a bad time at Ingolstadt \u2014 I take it\nback, at Eichstatt. Got \u2014 got quite a bit of \u2014 of resistance there. Then on down\ntowards the major city of Ingolstadt, which we were told was the hometown of\nHeinrich Himmler, expect defense. Well, it \u2014 I\u2019m not sure if it was with\nHimmler or not, but there was a \u2014 going into Ingolstadt was not the bad, but\nthat\u2019s the night we crossed the Danube. There was resistance there and that was a\nApril 6, 1999\n\u2014a pretty drastic night, to get in and get across basically, cross the river. As I said,\nwe were th \u2014 we were the \u2014 we were the second company of the Americans to go\ncro \u2014 I mean, a \u2014 the whole American army to cross, apparently. We got a\ncounterattack that night, got some \u2014 oh, we had a number who were killed, two or\nthree killed, I think, and quite a few wounded. And that\u2019s one of the nights one\nrealizes how thin is the veneer of civilization, by which I mean this. I remember\nthat I was the \u2014 I was the platoon runner by that time, sort of ran messages\nbetween the company command posts, CP and our \u2014 where we were, some \u2014 oh,\nsome blocks away. In the black of the night the Germans had come in, and the ka\n\u2014 and then several were wounded. And I remember going past and this \u2014 this\nGerman was crying, he says, I am bless\u00e9, well, French for woun \u2014 well, be \u2014 any \u2014\nand I remember I \u2014 I said \u2014 I just \u2014 I said, [speaks German] shut up. I mean, I \u2014\nno compassion at all on my part, huh? Yeah, I mean, you know, just \u2014 that was it.\nAnd you realize that yeah, I suppose that\u2019s our training and to \u2014 basically we \u2014 we\ncouldn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t take a chance, that kind of a thing. Maybe he was \u2014 maybe he\nwas just a \u2014 faking it, who knows? I couldn\u2019t take a chance. That was Ingolstadt\nand then we were there brief, and then after that really, the war was really finish\nup because by that time we were just on the move in \u2014 in \u2014 or sometimes \u2014\nsometimes we were riding tanks and going out ahead, other times mostly in trucks.\nApril 6, 1999\nThen, within a matter of a week we were down in Austria, we crossed into\nAustria. We \u2014 we stopped, oh we were pro \u2014 at a small town called Perwang,\nwhich 1s about 20 \u2014 p-e \u2014 p-e-r-w-a-n-g, about 20 kilometers north of Salzburg,\nwe were in Austria. And there \u2014 we were there when the word that the \u2014 it was\nMay seventh or May eighth, take your choice, the war was over. And immediately\nrumors began coming, okay you guys, you\u2019re already \u2014 there \u2014 you\u2019re going to the\nPacific. My God. Well, the thought was bad, but in the meantime we realized we\nwere gonna have some time at home. So indeed that\u2019s what happened. We came\nback by truck back to Mannheim. We were there in Mannheim for a time,\nprobably just a few days only in Feudenheim then truck again back across France\nto the same tents we were 1n when we first came, in Old Gold. And then \u2014 then we\ngot new uniforms, got the combat jackets. Pretty spiffy stuff, we thought. And\nnow getting ready for home. Trucks down to LaHavre. I was mentioning to\nCaptain Greenburg(ph) when we talked today, as we were leaving LaHavre now,\nsome romantic soul put on the loudspeaker system Debussy\u2019s Clair de Lune.\nThat was a nice departure. A week back to cross the Atlantic and then came this\ntumultuous arrival at home, because we were the first division back from Europe\nand we had the grand welcome. Blimps in the sky, fireboats in the \u2014 in New York\nharbor. Great big, huge banner across a hill, well done, welcome home. And off \u2014\nApril 6, 1999\noff the ships. Our ship had on a great big panel, ETO to Tokyo. Well. But we got\nin and my captain, Captain Reed(ph), we were still [indecipherable] tell me that\nhe \u2014 his home was Hoboken. His parents had learned of our return and his father\nwas able to get around over to the Manhattan\u2019s ri \u2014 we \u2014 I think he s \u2014 I the\ncaptain said pier 77 or something. 57. Got off and his father was right out there.\nFather shoved and pushed, he \u2014 right past and he bay \u2014 they kissed. Marvelous,\nhuh. And even the rest of us, it \u2014 1t was tremendous to come back, our own\ncountry again. Amazingly \u2014 I have it here, but amazingly there were \u2014 we had\ndignitaries and well wishers, but a lot of media. Reporter \u2014 a reporter from the\n\u201cDes Moines Register\u201d was there and we had a great big feature, which I still\nsaved at home basically, the \u2014 the Blackhawks back again and they had the \u2014 the\nname of every Iowan who was coming back and \u2014 and so there were many, many\nhappy families. We knew from the Register at home they knew we\u2019d been in\ncombat, that\u2019s the first word, because that had a little feature, what they\u2019ve done.\nAnd they had in the Register, toward the end of April that the 86\" was in combat.\nCourse, folks were just terribly tied up, terribly tied up. An amazing thing\nhappened, a tragic thing. When I \u2014 we got back to Mannheim, got our mail for the\nfirst ttme. My mother had written that she met a good high school friend of hers of\nCouncil Bluffs, now in Omaha, they got talking and her son was in the 86\",\nApril 6, 1999\n[indecipherable] together, his name was \u2014 was Captain Bruce McAllister, of our\nK company [indecipherable] in our regiment. And I remember as clearly sitting\nas we\u2019re sitting here. I remember saying to one of our \u2014 I said, my gosh, Wes, I \u2014\nI\u2019ve got to look up this Captain McAllister. He says, Pete, you\u2019re too late. He was\nkilled two weeks ago, down on the \u2014 on the [indecipherable] down the Danube.\nSo those things happen. That was \u2014 now \u2014",
        "Q: When you were leaving Europe and you were going towards LaHavre and\nyou were \u2014",
        "A: Leaving LaHavre, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah, no, but on your way.",
        "A: Oh, way in, yeah.",
        "Q: On \u2014 on \u2014 on those weeks getting back there and you saw civilians and again\nDPs, and \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 were you aware of the extent of the damage of the war at that point, or were\nyou \u2014",
        "A: Well, LaHavre \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 or again \u2014 or again aware of the camps? Were you ex \u2014 aware of the \u2014",
        "A: Oh, LaHavre was badly smashed, badly smashed.\nApril 6, 1999",
        "Q: But even on the way to there, you know, as you were going through other cities\nto get there.",
        "A: You mean ye \u2014 on the way back, you mean \u2014",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: \u2014 from \u2014 yeah. Mannheim \u2014 well, let me back up. War finished we were it \u2014\nwe were north of Salzburg. Back then by the autobahn, from Salzburg up to\nMunich \u2014 Munich was badly smashed. I remember driving and we\u2019d go over in\nthe trucks and \u2014 and we \u2014 in \u2014 in Munich, just \u2014",
        "Q: I\u2014I mean the terrible human toll.",
        "A: Oh, I see, yeah. We were \u2014 a lot of people \u2014 you feel particularly sorry for the\nold people and children, who are the \u2014 the innocent, I \u2014 truth is, much as it can be,\nbut the children [indecipherable]. And yet interestingly as we\u2019d drive \u2014 I\nremember driving along in the trucks, there would be children watching us and\nthey would be giving the Nazi salute. They were taught \u2014 we were sold \u2014 they\ndidn\u2019t know, we were soldiers, and that was enough. But to the civilians we would\ntalk. Now when we came back to Feudenheim, a suburb of Mannheim, where we\nwere billeted, the Germans were there and they \u2014 they \u2014 they were all right. I\nmean, they were very sub \u2014 subservient. Get along basically, and of course, what\nlittle was that there were \u2014 you never \u2014 you never met any who were ever Nazis.\nApril 6, 1999\nDown the street, I heard [indecipherable] but we were not \u2014 w-we were not\npolitical, huh? Typical, typical. Whatever \u2014 how did Hitler ev \u2014 ever come to\npower, you\u2019re thinking. None of them, none of them. But it was there, you know, I\ns \u2014 you know.",
        "Q: Okay \u2014",
        "A: O-Other \u2014 other people \u2014 let me back up, if I may. Another experience that I\nremember that was such a remarkable thing. I remember we were on trucks after\nwe'd gone through Ackstatt \u2014 Eichstatt, heading toward, and suddenly realized\nthat \u2014 that the trucks were being surrounded practically by this wild horde of\npersons in green uniforms. They\u2019re Russian \u2014 Russian. They were Russian,\nreleased Russian \u2014 Russian appar \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, Russian prisoners of war. And my\nfirst rec \u2014 these are like Chinese. Mongolians, the whole thing. My \u2014 my first\nrealization, I mean, you read of \u2014 of what Russia was, I mean, all this \u2014 this\nvariegated population, in appearance, I mean, the-these were Orientals, basically,\nhuh. Then they moved on back basically, we go to the \u2014 we would see again \u2014 a-\nagain also \u2014 we came across a number in Bavaria of allied prisoners, British, who\nwere out of ba \u2014 sent to work on farms, huh. Course you know, th-they \u2014 they\nwere \u2014 they were lucky to be in the country so they had food, you know. Others\nApril 6, 1999\ndidn\u2019t. I don\u2019t remember though \u2014 there were quite a few displaced persons\nmoving back. It\u2019s hard to get a count, basically.",
        "Q: Did you see anybody in prison camp you \u2014 concentration camp uniforms?",
        "A: No. The on \u2014 th-they were just civilian clothing, basically, that we saw. Now,\nto back \u2014 go back to the death camp side, though. After we \u2014 our division, 86\",\nwas in \u2014 we were down in Austria, our engineer battalion, I understand, was sent\nover to Dachau. And I had a friend in it, and he \u2014 he \u2014 he said he \u2014 again, he\u2019d\nnever such terror in his \u2014 that\u2019s where you had that \u2014 of course, the slave was bad\nenough, but of course there were others where you\u2019ve seen the pictures of, they are\njust incredible, incredible.",
        "Q: By May of \u201945, June of \u201945, had you heard of a place called Auschwitz?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think that we got the names until later. None of them, to my\nrecollection, none of them. That seemed to come later. But then of course, by \u2014 we\nlearned more of it during the fall. By that time we had been back home, furlough,\ntrained again briefly at Gruber(ph) then came to Baums(ph) and we were sent out\nto the Philippines. We were in the Philippines now when the war trials, the\nJapanese were going on. General Hawla(ph) for example, was being tried there.\nWe saw a lot of the \u2014 of the \u2014 the tales of atrocities committed by \u2014 and they were\n\u2014 by the Japanese, as they were leaving the Philippines and that was really \u2014 that\nApril 6, 1999\nwas bad. And \u2014 and of course the same time, I\u2019m not exactly sure, I think the\nNuremberg trials were in October November, maybe, of \u201945, right? And so we\nbegan seeing more of \u2014 1n just general, news about the information coming out.\nTh-That \u2014 so much was new that I \u2014 incredible. But I don\u2019t recall prior to that time\nany of the names, basically.",
        "Q: How long were you in the Philippines?",
        "A: We got to the Philippines, we \u2014 we \u2014 to draw back. We were at Camp\nGruber(ph) for a couple weeks, and then the bombs, what was it, like August 6\",\nAugust whatever it was. And naga \u2014 fi-first of course Hiroshima, then Nagasaki.\nWe were on \u2014 we were on the train shortly after that by order. We got to San\nFrancisco. We sailed to San Francisco about the last week \u2014 next to last week in\nAugust. Got to the Philippines about three weeks later and we were there from\nlate in September. And the program was this, that as you were in longer, there was\na point system, so many points for so many months. Combat infantry badge gave\nyou 10 extra points, a Purple Heart gave you fi \u2014 by the point system then, you\nsee, our particular group was ready to come back, and we did, we left in March\nfrom Manila to come back, March o-of \u201946. We were home a month later.",
        "Q: And then what did you do?\nApril 6, 1999",
        "A: First of all bought a suit of clothes. No, beyond that it was fla \u2014 great to be back\nhome again, of course. Planned to go, and I did then begin school. My\nsummertime was open. Began school at the University of Iowa in \u2014 in September\nof \u201946, right away. And I finished my schooling there.",
        "Q: So you went four years of university?",
        "A: I had to go \u2014 yes \u2014 es \u2014 I\u2014 I had \u2014 well, I had a little bit of a credit from \u2014 from\nKansas, in Drake, not much. But result was that I \u2014 I took what is called a\ncombined schedule of liberal arts and law. Your first \u2014 your first three years are all\nliberal arts. Then your first year law, combined with \u2014 with the other. So you\nactually had the whole thing six years.",
        "Q: Six years.",
        "A: I had \u2014 I went through the summertime basically [indecipherable] so I \u2014 then I\nfinished \u2014 I finished my \u2014 the law s \u2014 law school in June 51 and took the bar.\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: Then what did you do?",
        "A: [indecipherable] I went home to Council Bluffs, I entered my father\u2019s firm.\nDad was still practicing at the time. And practiced with the firm then following\nthat time. Met my wife at Iowa, Pat and I were married in \u2014 mustn\u2019t forget this,\nAugust 14\" of \u2014 of \u2014 of 1949. So we has the last two years of school together and\nApril 6, 1999\nthen came back home and our first child was born October of \u201951, and been\npracticing law since that time. In October \u2014 November of 1955, Dad, my father\nwas appointed to the lowa Supreme Court. After which time then, I was in the\nfirm, of course, continued that basically. And then I made some career changes\nover the years, but I practiced law ever since that time. All \u2014 all \u2014 practice of law\nall the time.",
        "Q: And you are currently still working?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: In a private firm, or \u2014",
        "A: No, no, I \u2014 well, yeah. I, for a variety of reasons left the \u2014 Dad\u2019s law firm, he \u2014\nhe was long since gone, in 70 \u2014 \u201975, and then I was a trust officer of \u2014 of a bank\nfor two years. Then back in the practice, I practiced since that time. First on my\nown, and now with another firm which is Telpner, Peterson, Smith and Ruesch\nin Council Bluffs.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re also a magistrate judge?",
        "A: I'ma part ti \u20141-it\u2019s called United States Magistrate Judge exactly, it\u2019s a part\ntime position. And have \u2014 and a-actually, interesting because I\u2019m \u2014 last June I\nfinished 40 years of federal service, long. And I think probably my position 1s\nApril 6, 1999\ngoing to be fazed out. The picture changes. Quite alright, but it\u2019s been \u2014 it\u2019s been\nfine, so \u2014 yeah.",
        "Q: And how many children do you have?",
        "A: Three. Daughter in the 40\u2019s, married of course. And then they have \u2014 they have\nthree children. The older son, married and they have three children and the\nyounger son, married with one child. So I have seven grandchildren.",
        "Q: Can we now talk a little bit about some of your feelings and reflections about\nwhat you went through, though you have alluded \u2014 you have talked about some of\nit already. Do you think you are a different person today because of what you\nexperienced during the war?",
        "A: Oh yes, no question.",
        "Q: And if so, in what way?",
        "A: As I mentioned before, I think my \u2014 I do not ha \u2014 had had a rather sheltered\nlife, even through high school. I was the \u2014 the so \u2014 the youngest in the family\nbasically and so forth, and I \u2014 I think probably looking back, indulged to a degree.\nBut I was typical growing up. There is no question though, that being in the\nmilitary, you\u2019re on the common denominator with a lot of other people of all\ndifferent backgrounds, sizes, shapes, tempers, the whole thing. It\u2019s a very \u2014 to me\na very valuable experience. Require a lot of self confidence about it, but you get to\nApril 6, 1999\nassume much \u2014 realize so much more about people and understanding people\nhopefully. And having served as we had in the military, too, it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s a source of\nsatisfaction, and \u2014 and \u2014 and not to be nostalgic or sentimental about it, but I think\nto me there is a \u2014 there is a great \u2014 a great value and a great importance of serving\none\u2019s country. And I think all of us felt that, at least the World War II people\npretty much. I can\u2019t speak for the other \u2014 in Vietnam, different things basically.\nBut I think for us it was a source of gratification, satisfaction. I \u2014 I\u2014 I know, in\nanswer t \u2014 to answer to the question presented that it \u2014 that it was a very valuable\nexperience for me.",
        "Q: When your children were 19 and 20, the age \u2014 19, th-the age that you were\nwhen you experienced such life threatening ex \u2014 you know, moments.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Did that bring back to you in those years, when your children were that age,\nwhat you went through? Did it trigger memories or thoughts of those times? When\nyou looked at your son and he was 19.",
        "A: Yeah. I didn\u2019t think that much about it. When sons were that age we were\nfussing around with rebel without cause kids. We were fussing around with\nmusical colleges, what to do. And \u2014 and at that time too, concerns about what life\nwas doing to them, with exposure to drugs and so forth. Fortunately that \u2014 not, but\nApril 6, 1999\nit-it\u2019s a concern for parents. That wasn\u2019t happening then, I \u2014 and I never really \u2014 I\nnever really equated them with my experience very much. And I knew \u2014 I talked\nto a degree military, the importance of my \u2014 of my experience basic \u2014 we never\ntalked very much about it, though, I mean as far as what had happened.",
        "Q: That was going to be my next question. Did you share with them those \u2014",
        "A: Wife [indecipherable] she would make occasional references to it, but I \u2014 all\nto a degree they knew about it, but not until several years ago, which was the 50\"\nyear after Attendorn, the rite of peace, which I call \u2014 and then only because I felt\nthe time had \u2014 some \u2014 generally speaking these are things you visit only with your\nbuddy \u2014 your \u2014 your \u2014 your \u2014 your immediate friends about. Other veterans to a\ndegree too, yeah, but you can really share with those that you served with. You\nhave your own lingua franca that you can go back and forth with. And you \u2014 you\ncan share with them, say a certain thing and a whole picture comes back. One of\nour \u2014 one of our A company people, James McRandall(ph) later got his doctorate\nin history. And \u2014 and Jim is a brilliant fellow. Wrote a marvelous book called,\n\u201cThe Antique Drums of War,\u201d in which he \u2014 1n which he profiled quite a bit our\n\u2014 our military experience and ha \u2014 its affect upon us. Does a \u2014 a marvelous job in\nmy judgment of \u2014 of \u2014 of describing, as best one can, combat, put into words, but\n\u2014 but as he would say, to get together to re \u2014 renew recollections at a \u2014 a reunion 1s\nApril 6, 1999\nlike watching a broken mirror, in the sense that the mirror is broken and there are\ncertain shards of memory that come back. Shards of memory like I\u2019ve talked about\nhere. Sometimes incomplete. We see \u2014 we see this broken mirror, each of us in a\ndifferent way, because in our combat experience, some of what \u2014 had the things \u2014\nsome, for example, what Sergeant Mac in great detail, hm, things that \u2014 that for\nsome reason or another, now whether \u2014 whether they\u2019re still latently \u2014 latent up\nhere, that need to be triggered, I don\u2019t know. But \u2014 yes Ma\u2019am\u2019?\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nApril 6, 1999\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Richard Peterson. This is tape three, side A.",
        "A: We have spoken about my friend Jim McRandall\u2019s(ph) analogy of the \u2014 of \u2014\nof \u2014 of the broken mirror and the shards of memory, and \u2014 and says Jim, just as\nyou cannot effectively reconstruct that mirror with the broken shards, some pieces\nare missing, some pieces are quite sharp, to carry on the \u2014 the \u2014 the metaphor of it.\nBut to all of us, to all of us, we can go back, and in our experience, in this \u2014 in the\nworld in which we live, the \u2014 the \u2014 1-in my terms, the crucible of contra \u2014 of\ncombat, you can see and remember the expression a certain fellow had, one of\nyour \u2014 one of your G.I. buddies on the street corner at a certain time. You can \u2014\nyou can see or visualize a hillside, or a certain setting where you were and what\nwas happening at the time. You can still recall the thunk of a mortar in the\ndistance or the rattle of machine gun fire. And they bring back \u2014 they \u2014 they can\nbring back these things, 1n some bizarre, strange way, but can never be fully \u2014\nnever fully reconstructed, just as \u2014 as a broken mirror can not be. And what you\u2019re\nseeing in the broken mirror also many times is \u2014 and results of being distorted in\nsome ways, you know, th-th-the \u2014 the different angles you\u2019re seeing of it. And \u2014\nand \u2014 and that\u2019s why you get with different veterans different views of things. The\nApril 6, 1999\n\u2014 the famous story of \u2014 of the \u2014 of the four blind men blindfolded with the\nelephant. One, the one leg and the trunk and so forth. And you \u2014 then that\u2019s very\nmuch the way it is. And \u2014 and in \u2014 in a combat situation, the first thing you realize\nis there\u2019s begin \u2014 it-it\u2019s confusion. I have here our division history. And as I read it\nthrough there are many areas \u2014 history is hard \u2014 is hard to recover accurately and I\nfind many things that I \u2014 I ca \u2014 I describe as being garbled in this. It depends who\none talks to, it depends how it\u2019s reconstructed, and it \u2014 wh-while there\u2019s a lot of\ngood work, at the same time there are things that do come off wrong. But so be it,\nI mean, tha-that\u2019s a part of the problem of reconstructing history.",
        "Q: Speaking about different perspectives, do you think it \u2014 it was an advantage\nthat you were so young when you went through this, or \u2014 or would it have been \u2014\nbeen better to be older?",
        "A: I think \u2014 I think better to be young because we were young, impressionable, but\nwe learned. We did not have intense, deep preconceptions of things and we would\naccept discipline better as younger people, I think, basically and could be trained\nbetter, seems to me. And \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and war is not a thing for anybody, but less\nI think older persons than younger. I think you maybe adjusted better. There was\nso many descriptions of it. One of the best, of course, is course the old original, the\nwa \u2014 the time honored one of \u2014 of Sherman. Another one too that \u2014 that to \u2014 to be\nApril 6, 1999\nin combat is looking like \u2014 you are looking like in a window into hell. A variety of\nthings, the base \u2014 I think maybe as young people we can hopefully, maybe accept\nthem more easily than we can a-as older \u2014 I\u2019m not \u2014 I\u2019ve not followed that too, too\nmuch, but certainly it \u2014 it \u2014 1t\u2019s for young people.

        "Q: Have your \u2014 or do you think your religious views are \u2014 or were influenced by\nyour brush with death and what you saw, the sights you saw during the war years?",
        "A: I\u2014I will say this, I mean, we were \u2014 we \u2014 we had religious training in the\nbackground basically, but you have the imponderable question, in our experiences.\nYou\u2019ve got people killed right beside you, the \u2014 the \u2014 the question, why them and\nnot me? It\u2019s an unanswerable question and \u2014 an-and still after all these years, I\npuzzle. An-And th-there is no solution to that, no answer. I-I think maybe the\nreligious faith, you know, faith in God, of course, in the hereafter if we\u2019re going to\naccept that, is important. S \u2014 but apropos of the matter of \u2014 of how to reason it out,\nit ca \u2014 it cannot be reasoned out. You see too many things where there is no reason\nof why things happen or shouldn\u2019t happen in combat. You see brutality where it\nshouldn\u2019t be. You see incredible cruelty. You see some of the best guys are \u2014 are\ntaken, killed, and other dunderheads, pardon the expression, seem to skin through.\nTh-There \u2014 there i \u2014 there is no logic to it. And yet, and yet there is an incredible\nApril 6, 1999\nattraction to it. Strange, isn\u2019t it? We \u2014 we\u2019ve seen the movie \u201cPatton\u201d\n[indecipherable] well, we don\u2019t love him, but \u2014 but it\u2019s undeniable and many,\nmany, many people feel this, that there 1s an incredible thrill in that situation, if\nyou come through. If you come through. We can look back and see things, there 1s\n\u2014 there can be \u2014 there can be, strangely, a great exhilaration in \u2014 in \u2014 in a firefight,\nit\u2019s strange. People inflicting death on others, and here again, the veneer of\ncivilization, the old tradition that when you get your blood up and so forth, it\u2019s the\nstrangest thing. You \u2014 you want to deny it to yourself, and yet contradictorily it\u2019s\nstill there. Strange. Not often, but \u2014 but more often it \u2014 more often 1s a \u2014 come \u2014\ncomes the feeling of \u2014 of the futility of 1t and the \u2014 and th \u2014 and the \u2014 I remem-\nmember coming home in my furlough and \u2014 and during that time, I remember we\nlost some of these guys, tha-that \u2014 that brought me to tears. I think\n[indecipherable] good guys, wonderful guys. Why, why, why, huh? Huh? My\ngood friend Sergeant Smith, Smitty was our re \u2014 machine gun section. They were\njust laying down field of fire as we were heading down into Attendorn. An 88\nround came in right through the center of the house they were in, took them all out\nand they were all badly injured. Smitty partic \u2014 badly bu \u2014 very badly injured.\nAnd of course he later on learned of our \u2014 my experience at night. Smitty, in\nRochester M-Minnesota now, a great, wonderful guy, very devout Catholic, go \u2014\nApril 6, 1999\ngoes to mass daily. Has had \u2014 has had some bouts with cancer, we\u2019re in close\ntouch. We always talk and we will talk next Monday on Attendorn day, the 11\",\nwe're there. It\u2019s kind of a contest who calls who first. I-I \u2014 I catch him before\nmass, his morning mass, but we talk about it a bit and I\u2014 and I recently said last\ntime, I said, Smitty, how you doing with the cancer? He says Pete, doing fine, but\nhe says every day, every day you \u2014 you \u2014 you and I have after Attendorn is a plus.\nThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s right.",

        "Q: You also had mentioned that you do think about what had happened more\nfrequently now. Is that true as you\u2019re getting older?",
        "A: I\u2014I\u2014I-\u2014I-I think so, yeah. I think that \u2014 oh, I suppose we get older, maybe\nwe begin reflecting more about it. Hate to call them the twilight years for gosh\nsakes, but \u2014 no, but maybe \u2014 and then you re \u2014 go back and reflect upon these\nthings and \u2014 and \u2014 and recognize what a full life a person\u2019s had, but \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014\nand interestingly enough too, Oliver Wendell Holmes, the justice, a Civil War\nveteran, combat veteran, injured three times in the war, in the 1890\u2019s was asked to\ngive a Memorial Day talk. And in that \u2014 and in that he touched upon \u2014 made this\nApril 6, 1999\ncomment, may \u2014 maybe you\u2019ve read it before, [indecipherable].

        "A: \u2014 answer yes. I-I think the comment made by \u2014 by Captain Greenburg(ph), we\ntouched upon earlier that at the time it was just a part of the whole thing. Now,\nhaving seen the unfolding history, and we see here is about the \u2014 the death camps\nas well as the slave labor camp, it assumes a different importance basically, an \u2014\nan importance, because it \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 it\u2019s a \u2014 war itself is bad, but that \u2014 that, to\nevidence the cold bloodedness, and the \u2014 and \u2014 a-a-and th-the depravity of what\nthis \u2014 this remarkable nation Germany \u2014 I say remarkable, it\u2019s \u2014 has a \u2014 of\nApril 6, 1999\nculture, of art and beauty and [indecipherable] all pluses, had sunk to.

And they have a long difficult\njob ahead with the reunification to blend it together, but I think it can be an\nApril 6, 1999\ninteresting country, and yet \u2014 and yet \u2014 and yet there are still people that have the\nfeeling should they reunite it because of in the past what Germany has done. The\nold saying, forgot who it was, Germans are either at your feet or at your throat. I \u2014\nI can\u2019t answer \u2014 generalizations are always a little bit dangerous, I mean, you\nknow, you can\u2019t follow it that much, but we\u2019ve been in Germany a number of\ntimes, enjoy it, beautiful country, good friends. And yet, and yet. Captain\nGreenburg(ph), ther \u2014 they\u2019re both Jewish and his wife Phyllis will not go to\nGermany. Will not go to Germany.

I wonder sometimes what their fate was, if they were ru \u2014 were\nRussian, probably a bad fate. What we read, at least about the prisoners of war, the\nRussians, they were not accepted back or they were, if they were taken back they\nwere \u2014 brutal thing. As far as the civilians, I \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2019ve \u2014 I sometimes wonder what\nApril 6, 1999\nhappened to those people, a-again, you know. Didn\u2019t think at the time, but after\nthe pass of years you wonder about it, basically. Interestingly also, I did some\nchecking out \u2014 I had occasion to read \u2014 check back in to the records of the\nNuremberg \u2014 Nuremberg. November, it began. One of the major cases was that\nof a Field Marshal Milch m-i-n-l \u2014 m-i-l-c-h, Milch, who was a subordinate of\nAlbert Speer, and that was the [indecipherable]. He was one was responsible for\nthe \u2014 the so-called forced labor, alright? And in the exhibits presented at\nNuremberg in his behalf were requirements by the Reich supposedly that these\npeople would be adequately fed and cared for. Not humanitarianly-wise, but to\ninsure the fact they could do the work they were going to do, huh. The other was \u2014\nsimply seemed secondary, basically. And of course in the case of these poor\npeople, in ha \u2014 admittedly now, probably the logistical system had broken down, I\nmean as far as food, but that does not still explain in a \u2014 in any way excuse the\nway they were being held. Read, as we have, Manchester\u2019s book, \u201cThe Arms of\nKrupp,\u201d and the \u2014 and the \u2014 and th-the treatment to which the Kruppianer\nsubjected all their force people, huh. It\u2019s an incredible thing, incredible living in it.\nAnd \u2014 and what we saw that afternoon, I mean, the way these that \u2014 the way these\npeople were.

        "Q: The Danish experience, as opposed to the German.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s quite inters \u2014 it\u2019s quite interesting. Number one, there had been a\ngreat \u2014 a great tradition, history of tolerance in Denmark. Smaller countries\n[indecipherable] also. But early enlightenment, which began in Denmark in the\n1820\u2019s - 30\u2019s, they had \u2014 they had left the monarchy, I mean the \u2014 the actual\nabsolute monarchy and into more of a constitutional monarchy, th-that helped. A\nsmaller country, as I mentioned again, and beyond that, I\u2019m not sure, except that\nthere was \u2014 it was indeed a safe haven. Now, as to how the wonderful escape took\nplace in October, several things I \u2014 I read \u2014 as we read it. Number one, there had\nbeen the great feeling of the Danish people. The-The-These are not Danish Jews,\nApril 6, 1999\nit\u2019s Jewish Danes. A subtle distinction, but it\u2019s interesting. Secondly the war\nsituation was turning against Germany. Allies were in north Africa by that time.\nStalingrad had been completed. The general feeling was \u2014 was different. The\nproximity \u2014 the proximity of Sweden now, made it possible, which might, in a\nlandlocked country not have happened, huh. And the willingness of the Swedes to\naccept it. There\u2019s a wonderful story told apropos of that, about the Swedish side of\nit now. When the time came that was realized the Germans were going to move, to\ntake the Danish Jews, time was short. It was a matter of days, but they had to\nsomehow \u2014 they meaning the Danish people under their leadership and the\nresistance get them out. But they had to have the agreement of Sweden to take\nthem. They could not deal with Germany and say \u2014 because that would tip it off.\nSo what was determined, from what I read, was this, they realized that the Danish\nleadership, they had to get the agreement of the Swedish crown. The arrangement\nwas made that they, the Danish people would select, hopefully, that \u2014 a leader of\nthe Danish Jewish community to hopefully visit with the King of Sweden. It was\narranged. And the person selected was Niels Bohr, the great atomic\n[indecipherable]. The story goes on to say that in \u2014 1n Bohr\u2019s words he said \u2014 he\nsaid, I\u2019m a scientist, not an advocate, he said, why \u2014 well, they said you have th-\nthe standing, the name, the King will \u2014 all right. It was arranged remarkably\nApril 6, 1999\n[indecipherable]. Then, in just a matter of hours they set this up and apparently\nthen, either \u2014 either by boat \u2014 they\u2019re not \u2014 they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re still \u2014\nthey\u2019re c-careful, or possibly by a British aircraft, the Mosquito coming, take him\nover, Bohr was taken to Stockholm, to probably Drottningholm and the palace,\nthe story is told. He said, in I went, to this massive palace. Re-Realized what was\non my shoulders to try and get this done, to persuade the king. I was shown into\nthe room. Had a room and th-th-th-the king\u2019s attendant was there, basically very\nfine, he said Dr. Bohr, please wait. Then he said the moment came, he said\n[indecipherable] here \u2014 here \u2014 here I am just becoming more tense by the\nmoment. The door opened and they said, Dr. Bohr, the king will see you now. He\nsaid, I stepped in and here was this very pleasant looking gentleman, it was the\nking, King Gustav. Gustav Aroff(ph) I think it was. And he said, I-I have some\nSwedish. And he said, I explained in [indecipherable] as best I could the plight of\nour people, what was going to happen and \u2014 and that we desperately pled for help.\nHe said, the king, very courteous, stood up. He said, of course I stood up too. The\nking walked to the window, looked out. He said that \u2014 I can [indecipherable] it\nwas probably all of maybe 10 seconds, but he came back and said, Dr. Bohr, your\npeople will be welcome in Sweden. And that was it, laid the foundation. So, a\ncombination of things put together, you see, and of course the \u2014 it was not all \u2014 I\nApril 6, 1999\nmean there were \u2014 there were some problems to getting them \u2014 getting the Danes\nacross or getting the \u2014 the \u2014 the Jews across, the Jewish people. Some \u2014 some boat\npeople did charge, others did not, back and forth, but it still was a remarkable,\nremarkable thing, huh? Incredible.",

        "Answer: Richard William Peterson.",
        "A: In [indecipherable] Iowa on September 29\", 1925.",
        "A: My father, Henry K. Peterson was a lawyer. Mother, Laura May Peterson. I\nhad two \u2014 two others, my older sister Josephine, who was 11 years older than I,\nand my brother Robert, nine years older than I.",
        "A: Exactly, yes.",
        "A: Thad, oh I think a variety of things. One thing I think Mother and Dad\nencouraged a lot of reading, we did a lot of reading at home. The usual childhood\nsports, I think. I think beyond that also Mother and Dad encouraged collections of\nApril 6, 1999\nthings. Stamp collections, that sort of thing basically that was of interest. Music\nwas always a part of our home. Mother sang beautifully and she played the piano,\nwe had that sort of thing. Interestingly too at home, I think though, we had quite a\nbit \u2014 because on my father\u2019s side, Danish background, as the name indicates. On\nmy mother\u2019s side the family went way back from New England Yankee people.\nSo on Dad\u2019s side we would have my grandparents who lived just a block away,\nwe'd be often times in their home. We learned little bit of Danish, used some\nDanish in the home place, and my father had not spoken English until he was five.\nOn Mother\u2019s side we had a lot of Civil War background because she had three\nuncles who were in the Civil War. We had a lot of Civil War songs and a lot of\nthat sort of thing basically. So there was a kind of a developing interest of history\nas well too, during that time.",
        "A: Yes, yeah. Oh I had the usual, I think, childhood diseases basically and the\nscrapes and bruises, that kind of thing. But no, nothing unusual. It was \u2014 it was a\ngood \u2014 good childhood, healthy-wise, you bet.",
        "A: Right about average I would think, yeah. I think average.\nApril 6, 1999",
        "A: We were Baptists. The Baptist persuasion is that there is no baptism until you\nreach what 1s called the age of believer. I was baptized when I was nine years old\nafter some instruction, basically. And of course in the Baptist church that\u2019s by\nimmersion. Mother \u2014 D-Dad was very active. Not only his profession but in\ncommunity life and religious life as well too. He\u2019d been the past president of the\nIowa Baptist Association. Mother was even a stronger Baptist than he was. She\nwas what was called a deep water, loud shouting Baptist and she enjoyed the reli \u2014\nso we had \u2014 we had a\u2014 a good \u2014 good \u2014 good religious background.",
        "A: Yes, I think so. Neighborhood friends, quite a few of those. The neighborhood\nquote gangs, end quote, I suppose. Then farther along in school we lived just\nwithin a \u2014 oh, a block or so of [indecipherable] school where I attended, and we\nhad a lot of friends at school, I \u2014 I think so, yes.",
        "A: There was never direct lect \u2014 any \u2014 any limitation of \u2014 of showing emotion.\nDad was quite serious just by his demeanor basically. Mother \u2014 Mother had more\nexpression I think basically and she enjoyed things more. She was a\u2014a-\u2014a\ndelightfully humorous person, a lot of fun to be around. Dad, as I say, was more\nApril 6, 1999\nserious, but he was a very, very, very fine person. And looking back, too, in the\nhome, as I said, it was a lot of encouragement of reading and a lot of\nencouragement of motivation to do things. Dad was very active community-wise\nand he urged all of us to \u2014 to be involved in high school activities, other activities\nas well. An interesting thing about the family, though, you see, we\u2019re almost rather\nlike two families. My \u2014 1n the sense that my sister was 11 years older, my brother\nnine, and I, as Mother said, the side dish that came on orders was that much\nyounger, you see. So I\u2014 they were up and growing, my \u2014 my sister Josephine,\nbrother Robert, they were kind of on a different level by the time I was \u2014 I came\nalong. So I was home quite a bit myself, in those later years.",
        "A: I think because of the interest in reading we had, we were really quite young,\nbecause Mother\u2019s two spinster sisters had both been to Europe. Quite unusual at\nthat particular time is these young women, they were teachers, basically, they had\nboth been in Europe. My Aunt Agnes had \u2014 had been in Germany a number of\ntimes and studied there. Aunt Belle had been with her also. But we would have,\nwhen Aunt Belle and Aunt \u2014 Aunt Agnes were there, talks about Europe and\nvisiting about Europe. So really as younger people we were aware of at least\nEurope. Not the rest of the world, but Europe, certainly. And I\u2019m speaking now\nApril 6, 1999\nof \u2014 of ages probably of 10 and 12, maybe eight, we were aware of Europe.\nNews-wise, later though, because it wasn\u2019t of course until I was getting into later\ngrade school that the world news became more and more important.",
        "A: We were aware because first of all we had the \u201cDes Moines Register,\u201d the\nstate paper that the folks read avidly, they would discuss it. We had radio news\nbasically as well, too. So I think probably as \u2014 as things were beginning to\ndevelop, I remember discussions of the Spanish Civil War, that would be what, in\nthe late 1930\u2019s. And then of course when the war itself began in the first or second\nof September 1939, why, we were much, much aware of it.",
        "A: Yes, I remember quite clearly because that morning, I remember coming into\nthe kitchen, the paper was there and Dad was very disturbed, having read the \u2014 the\nwar that \u2014 the word had come that \u2014 that of course as we remember, Germany had\nmoved into the \u2014 in-into \u2014 into Danzig, and then that the British gave the\nultimatum and I remember the talk, we all heard Neville Chamberlain saying that\nthey were given ultimatum, we have rece \u2014 [indecipherable] undertaking, so\nApril 6, 1999\nwe\u2019re therefore at war.

        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Correct, correct, but the real \u2014 the real change came in April of 1940, the next\nspring, during the first [indecipherable] of course it was the so-called static war,\nnothing happening basically. But it was in April, the next April, when Germany\nmoved into first Denmark and then the Scandinavian countries, and that was very\n\u2014 very meaningful because I remember so well of going over that morning to\nGrandma and Grandpa\u2019s, they\u2019re still living. This time they were in \u2014 1n the 80\u2019s.\nBut I can picture just as we talk right now, Grandpa Peterson sitting there in the\nsun in the early morning as if he were stunned. The war did come. And I said in\nApril 6, 1999\nDanish, Bedstefar [Danish]. Yeah, da \u2014 I'll put it sa \u2014 put it in Danish again.\n[Speaks Danish here] The Germans have Denmark. And then in English he says,\npoor little Denmark, she couldn\u2019t do a thing. She couldn\u2019t do a thing. And he just\n\u2014he\u2019d been in the German army, you se \u2014 oh, I\u2019m sorry, the \u2014 the Danish army.\nAnd of course it was a great history in the 1860\u2019s when Grandpa was in Denmark\ngrowing up, of the first \u2014 you know, th-the first war with Germany. And then of\ncourse the World War II is \u2014 World War \u2014 war was there also, but this was a really\ntraumatic thing for them. And we \u2014 we sensed that, we could see that in \u2014 in \u2014 in\ntheir \u2014 in their make-up, what was happening.",
        "A: Oh, I think \u2014 I think not too much at that time. We knew things of course were\ngetting much more so because following that of course we recall Norway fell, and\nthen of course Germany moved into \u2014 in to the low countries and on and then of\ncourse there was a lot of awareness when the German [indecipherable] went\nthrough the Ardennes, to the great \u2014 the great shock and surprise of the French\nand British. And then of course the \u2014 the escape of the British at Dunkirk to get\nacross, we \u2014 that was a lot in the news, we were very, very aware of that.\nApril 6, 1999",

But we\nwere quite aware of it, yeah.\nfamilies living in your town?",
        "A: Yes. Yes. Polish friends as a matter of fact. I was in grade school with Marvin\nRichards, with Stanley Krazney(ph), both of Jewish \u2014 and some \u2014 and some\ngirls, too. So we \u2014 we \u2014 we had good friends that were, yes.

And finally as they left, the first group left, Dad\u2019s client remained, leaned\nover and says, can you blame Hitler? Can you blame Hitler? But that \u2014 that was a\nkind of a \u2014 of a joke sort of thing.

        "A: We got the word, of course, that Sunday afternoon at home. They\u2019re saying, we\ninterrupt this news [indecipherable] and so forth. A great \u2014 a great shocking\nthing. At this time, age 16, realized that not fully as yet, but it was going to affect\nus. The next morning in the \u201cDes Moines Register\u201d there appeared a \u2014 a \u2014 the\nname was Ding Darling, he was one of the leading cartoonists in the country, and\nhere was this \u2014 this drawing. It was of Uncle Sam kneeling, holding in his arms a\nsailor with a knife in his back. And Uncle Sam was looking up in fury and anger,\nshaking his fist at the departing Japanese aircraft. Powerful thing. I remem-mem-\nmember very well, and that\u2019s one of the first times I ever remember seeing Dad in\ntears, at that. And that was now Monday morning at home. At school, Abraham\nLincoln High School, our principal Mr. Kern, Gerald Kern, a \u2014 a very fine\neducator and he ran a tight school. He called the entire school body together, we\nwere in the \u2014 the big, large auditortum. He perceived in his wisdom how he\u2019Il be\naffecting us, and he had brought \u2014 he brought in a large floor model radio which\nwas up on the stage. And I can see him yet. The auditorium, large but couldn\u2019t\ntake all of them, so there were other students in the aisles, the balcony, the whole\nthing. And we sat there in dead silence, and Mr. Kern turned on President\nRoosevelt\u2019s war message. And how interesting. I thought about it over the years.\nOver \u2014 over the \u2014 the \u2014 the stage, on the proscenium of the stage, in large gothic\nApril 6, 1999\nletters in high school were, ye come to learn, go forth to serve. How rather\nprophetic looking back, huh, at those times. That was Monday and then of course\nduring the week, difficult. To drop back a bit though, the week before had been a\ntense week because I remember th-the \u2014 the \u2014 the [indecipherable] this country as\nwe recall, as the special en \u2014 envoys, emissaries and there were big pictures of\nthem in the paper, them smiling and very \u2014 you know. And then came the word\nabout it. But I remember when, during the end of the week as we\u2019re reaching \u2014 it\nwould have been in probably December fourth or fifth \u2014 third, fourth or fifth, that\nthe word came that they were re-reaching some kind of an accord, they thought \u2014 I\nremember saying to Dad, Dad, how lucky \u2014 a war with Japan would be terrible,\nwouldn\u2019t it? And then of course, came the events of Sunday and then Monday, of\ncourse, war was declared.",
        "A: To a degree, but it was changing, because we realized things were indeed\nhappening, and they already had, to this extent. The National Guard had been\nalready brought into federal service by that time. I thi \u2014 I think that our local unit,\nwhich was the 168\" infantry of the na \u2014 34\" division had been mustered in in\nJanuary the year before. And we were aware of it because a number of the high\nschool student seniors were in the National Guard and they were gone. And I\nApril 6, 1999\nremember then, it was in the \u2014 May of that year, which would have been 1941,\nbefore the war, but here they made arrangements and I remember being in \u2014 I was\nin the band and orchestra, and it was always typical that we would play, the\norchestra, we would play \u2014 our \u2014 our school march was \u201cThe Pilgrim\u2019s Chorus\u201d\nfrom Tannhauser. And \u2014 and Mr. Kern liked it, 1t was very good. Much better\nthan \u201cPomp and Circumstance.\u201d But I remember being th \u2014 we were practicing\nand in came the high school seniors and I remember I was so, as a youngster,\nmoved, because here were four, five or six of the high school students now on\nactive duty, they were there in uniform, they came back to graduate. So that was \u2014\nSO We were very much aware of it. And to drop back to your other question, how\ndid it change? We were much aware, the \u2014 the high school paper, \u201cThe Echoes\u201d\nbegan having items more and more of classmates we had, or students who were\nnow in the service, in the military, back and forth. As well, at our high school we\nhad ROTC, junior ROTC, we were all in it, even band \u2014 band people had a\nmilitary band and the whole thing. So there was more emphasis all the time. I\nmean that things are going to happen, young people and you\u2019ve got training that\u2019s\ngoing on here, it\u2019s going to be helpful to you. So the \u2014 the high school paper as I\nsaid, was carrying more and more news about people who graduated, and where\nthey were training and so forth, so we\u2019re very much aware of it. And, may I add,\nApril 6, 1999\nthe school activities began to be directed. Junior Red Cross, for example, was\nhaving more projects. As \u2014 as youngsters, I was involved with the Boy Scouts, the\nBoy Scout project even at that time was collecting aluminum, s-scrap aluminum to\nget for the war effort. So we \u2014 were doing, things were happening.",
        "A: Not immediately. You suddenly began realizing, as the senior class ahead of us\ngraduating, they were going in, that this was going to be happening to you. So\ngradually we recog \u2014 it was a part of it, and we were expected to do it and we\nknew it was coming by that time.",
        "A: No. I\u2014I think at that time there was so much \u2014 so much patriotism. You know,\nremember Pearl Harbor and so forth, and of course Germany declared war right\naway too on this, as you recall \u2014 as one recalls. So, I don\u2019t think \u2014 I don\u2019t think wa\n\u2014 it was a fearful project. Our feeling was everybody\u2019s in it, we will be too, and\nit\u2019s a part of party responsibility. It\u2019s a gr \u2014 a gr \u2014 a great sense of patriotism at that\ntime.\nApril 6, 1999",
        "A: I think fairly so. [indecipherable] to this. I had been the quote baby unquote at\nhome. Josephine and Robert were up, they were in college and so forth. And of\ncourse, you touch upon them actual \u2014 the war touching us, brother Robert was\nfinishing University of Iowa in law. He had finished in 1940. He went into the\nFBI initially, for a time, and then because he had an ROTC commission from\nIowa, he got a deferment and had a special service with the FBI overseas, but we\nwere aware of the war going on, very much indeed. So \u2014 and \u2014 but I, in my\nsituation, Mother always \u2014 she was very candid about it, she said that I needed to\nget out more and so forth. And it \u2014 I-I was, I think, a little bit sheltered at the time.",
        "A: Yeah. We \u2014 we did quite a bit. To drop back now, we\u2019re talking now 41, you\nsee the first real involvement that we knew about, was when the Marines landed in\nGuadalcanal in August of 1942. That was the first real, as I recall, over action by\nthe nation as far as being on the attack, that I remember offhand. So we were much\naware of that basically. Things were happening then too. And of course, as well,\nthe National Guard unit that I spoke of, the 168\" regiment, 34\" division was at\nCamp Claiborne, Louisiana and they were one of the first to go overseas, which\nwas a \u2014 yeah, they went over, went to north Ireland, I think it was in January of\n\"42. So the result is that all the hometown people were aware of their \u2014 their \u2014\nApril 6, 1999\ntheir sons, their husbands, brothers were \u2014 in the National Guard now \u2014 now were\noverseas now, so you began to feel it much more locally, that here were local\nhometown boys that had already gone over.",
        "A: Not a bit.",
        "A: Not a bit. As I recall \u2014 it\u2019s hard to loo \u2014 think back on that, and I don\u2019t think\nno-no-not a word about labor camps.",
        "A: And even about concentration camps, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t recall any awareness of\nthat.",
        "A: Ghettos, yes, because of our history study basically that we knew \u2014 we knew\nhistorically, I mean, of the \u2014 the existence of the \u2014 the older \u2014 the European cities\nof \u2014 of ghettos, oh, I \u2014 I think particularly in \u2014 in Germany, the German ghettos.\nThe Rothschilds, it was a wonderful, interesting, th-the Rothschild family. The\nfilm, George Arliss was in it. They \u2014 we\u2019re talking the mid 30\u2019s now. And that\nbegan in the story of a \u2014 in \u2014 in, I think a ghetto in Frankfurt, I\u2019m not sure, but it\nApril 6, 1999\nwas new then, but we began reading about it, so we were aware of it on the matter\nof \u2014 matter of what it was, what they were.",
        "A: Junior, I mean basically then, I would have been, you see, a junior \u2014 yeah, I\nwould have been a senior, you\u2019re right in 1942, because then, all into the rest of\nthe year and then graduated 1943. I became \u2014 yeah, 17 in September of \u201942, that\u2019s\nright.",
        "A: We were getting closer to graduation obviously. I think, looking back, the\ncourses that we had, there was a real awareness of maybe boning up on your\nmathematics and so forth, that kind of thing basically because you might have\nmilitary. In the ROTC units, as I recall having a lot \u2014 a lot of training. If nothing\nelse, we learned at least close order drill and the manual of arms, if nothing else.\nSo that was it. And also, in school we were getting recruiting requests from the\nnavy, the army and so forth to get signed up to take tests basically, see if you \u2014 if\nyou could qualify maybe for some kind of a \u2014 of a \u2014 of a military education\nprogram, which there was a number of them. The navy had them, the army had\nApril 6, 1999\nthem and so forth. So we took tests now during that year to see 1f you could\nqualify for that. So we were heading 1n that direction.",
        "A: Yes, the way it worked, graduated in June of 1943. We\u2019d heard nothing back\nfrom the tests at that particular time. Some of our class, for example had already\ndone \u2014 signed up for submarine officer training and so forth, some for the air\nforce. I did not. I went to Drake University in June, just after graduation for about\n\u2014 it was about a month, six weeks. Drake, because it had been Dad\u2019s school, it\nwas a good school in Des Moines, and Dad\u2019s thought was, get as much education\nas you can before the military, which was exactly right. And then, after about six\nweeks there, I got word that I would be eligible for the Army Specialized Training\nReserve Program, ASTRP. Reserve being for those who had not yet attained age\n18 and you could go into the enlisted reserve, start off. And then, after finishing\none\u2019s first term, and when you reached your 18\" birthday or past it, then that term\nwould stop in school, you would be s \u2014 be \u2014 you would become a part of the army\nitself, be sworn in, have your basic training, then the program would come back to\nschool afterwards. All right, to drop back now, my particular group that I qualified\nfor, we were \u2014 I was still in Des Moines, Drake University. Down, I remember\ngoing downtown at the direction, and I had all the papers and so forth, I \u2014 in \u2014\nApril 6, 1999\nwent into the enlisted reserve, took the oath basically and so forth. And then\nterminated my work at Drake, went home and oh then two or three weeks\nafterwards reported to then Fort Crook for induction into the actual \u2014 the actual\nservice itself. Our group went to Kansas University at Lawrence, Kansas. And\nwe began our first tour of ASTRP, all reservists, we had \u2014 we had uniforms,\nROTC uniforms basically, the first part of August and we were there then with the\nfirst term of just basic engineering beginning supposedly, until we\u2019d accomplished\nour 18\" birthday. Mine was September 29\", you see. So I finished the first term,\nand then those of us that had reached age 18 then went home for a brief furlough,\nwe reported to Camp Dodge in Iowa, then sworn into the army itself, huh, and\nthen began our real army experience, because after the initial beginning in the\narmy you have just your uniform, your shots, your medical, the whole thing,\n[indecipherable] orientation, then you are sent to a basic training camp. And that\nwould have been then \u2014 that was just about the middle of November of 1943.",
        "A: Fort Benning, Georgia. That was the training \u2014 th-the training camp. First of\nall, that was the so called infantry school for the United States, th-th-the \u2014 for\nhistorically that had been the \u2014 the headquarters of infantry training basically and\nGeneral Patton had been there basically, earlier years, quite well known. We went\nApril 6, 1999\nthere and began our basic training then, that would have been the first part of\nDecember of 1943.",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall it at all, no. That was in the spring of \u201943? No, I don\u2019t recall.",
        "A: Yes, ma\u2019am. Yes.",
        "A: It was cold and damp, I recall that quite a bit. But it was something else\nbecause now we were in uniform full time. We began our actual basic training\nwhich at that time was a 17 year \u2014 a 17 week course. You begin the whole thing\nagain. Now, we\u2019d already had, to a degree we\u2019d had some military training at \u2014 in\nhigh school we had some, w-we had \u2014 we\u2019d had some at Kansas, KU, at\nLawrence. So we had the basic, we had alr \u2014 been through close order drill, we\nhad the manual of arms degree, but then you go through the whole thing and now\nfor the thirst \u2014 the first time you\u2019re in the barracks and so forth. Non-coms were\nokay, we were learn \u2014 our training company was in the area called the Harmony\nChurch area, which was the training area that we had for the AST people.

And then the next \u2014 the next program was that we would hike\nout to, call it Caramouche, c-a-r-a-m-o-u-c-h-e range. It was a \u2014 oh, about a 10\nmile hike. We hiked out and we had a week tha \u2014 actually I think a week on the\nrange itself. And we had just finished \u2014 a week or 10 days \u2014 we had just finished\nthe last exercise, which was the infiltration course, where you crawl, you know,\nunder the \u2014 the firing machine gun bullets and so forth.

        "A: Into the hospital, a fairly high fever, but I made it by about four days okay,\nback in, but because of technicality I had \u2014 I was told I would have to go back into\nan earlier cycle. I was devastated. Here I was, I\u2019d been with these \u2014 most of them\nmy friends from Kansas and all fellows I\u2019d known basically now \u2014 in basic,\nliterally, for over the last 10 weeks or so. And it was very \u2014 a really tough growing\nup process because these are the folks I\u2019d come to know and so forth, that I was\ntaken aback. But anyway, transferred back into another \u2014 another group basically,\nand we completed it. But then, the next thing that happened was this, we were just\nbarely finishing it up, word came from Washington that the AST prog \u2014 P\nprogram was being eliminated. They needed people carrying guns, not books and\nthe result was that not only the ASP \u2014 TP was being washed out, but also a\nnumber of Air Force cadets that had only gotten to a certain level, were also into\nthe infantry. Result was then that we were much \u2014 a lot of turmoil what\u2019s going to\nhappen. Mother learned about it, she was terribly upset, she wrote the\ncongressman and so forth, as if anything could be done. But that\u2019s the way it was\nApril 6, 1999\nand so we got packed up, we had finished pretty much of our training and we were\nthen shipped to the 86\" Blackhawk division, then training at Camp Livingston,\nLouisiana. So the trip then was from Fort Benning to Camp Livingston. There\nwe were met and greeted basically and then \u2014 and then began our training with the\n86\" division.\ntime?",

My really\nsecond language if I have it was Spanish. Because I\u2019d had \u2014 well, first of all, I had\ntwo years of Latin, wonderful background and then two more years of Spanish in\nhigh school. So I could get along to a degree. My \u2014 and my Danish, I \u2014 I was\nrapidly forgetting, because that drifts away.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Infantry. We were assigned to A company 342\" infantry. We were a \u2014 wh-\nwhich 1s \u2014 which, as I should add, a rifle company. To explain a bit further, in a\ndivision, infantry, about 15,000 men, one-half of those are infantry themselves, in\nApril 6, 1999\nthe form of three regiments. We were in 342\". The Blackhawk had regiments\n341\", second and third. And every regiment then would have three battalions. A\nbattalion would be composed of a headquarters company of the colonel, lieutenant\ncolonel ba \u2014 of the lieutenant colonel basically, of the \u2014 of the battalion. The\nheadquarters company had staff and there was a reconnaissance patrol and some\nother service. Then, in each \u2014 in each battalion beyond that, there were three rifle\ncompanies and a weapons company. And I \u2014 and I give this because it gives a\nbetter background for the future I think, too. A rifle company had approximately,\nin what was called the table of organization, TO, about 180 men commanded by,\nnormally, a captain. And then there would be a lieutenant, who is called the\nplatoon leader, for each of the four platoons. The \u2014 the three rifle platoons and the\nweapons platoon. And sometimes there would be another \u2014 another officer who 1s\n\u2014 be assistant \u2014 the assistant company commander. In our company it was Captain\nMitchell, and then we had the \u2014 th-the \u2014 the four lieutenants. Basically \u2014 trying to\nrecall base \u2014 the names we had ba \u2014 there was Lieutenant Hess, Lieutenant\nBudman(ph), Lieutenant Greenburg(ph). And those were basically the officers\nthat we had. Each platoon, rifle platoon was composed of three squads of 12 men\neach. Was the platoon sergeant, a platoon guy, like an assistant, the assistant\nperson. And then, for each squad, the squad leader was a staff sergeant, which is\nApril 6, 1999\nthe three chevrons and then the rocker underneath, an assistant squad \u2014 squad\nleader, who\u2019d be regular [indecipherable] and then the balance of the men will be\n12 [indecipherable]. Be two scouts, two patro \u2014 two [indecipherable] of two\nsquad scouts, a Browning automatic rifleman basically and other riflemen down\nthe line, too. So therefore each \u2014 each rifle platoon had those people. In the\nweapons platoon. separate, those \u2014 those were the light machine guns, and there\nwere two sections of those basically, with machine guns each and also mortars,\nwhich is 60 millimeter weapon, the tubes that fire the rockets, those thi \u2014 that\nwould be a rifle company. There was also each ra \u2014 in each battalion, a heavy\nweapons company, which would be the \u2014 would be the \u2014 the \u2014 the water cooled\nheavy machine guns, and the 81 millimeter mortars. And so that was basically the\nstructure of \u2014 of a regiment. And then we were A company of that, and I was in\nthe first squad, third platoon. I was a scout, okay.",
        "A: Exactly, we finished training, provisional training in February, March. Picture\nchanged because all of us recognized there were more people. Air Force people\ncoming in that had been washed out of \u2014 ne \u2014 not wa \u2014 that\u2019s the wrong te \u2014 but\nthey \u2014 they\u2019ve been transferred out of the infantry. So we began getting a lot more\nApril 6, 1999\npeople in and really the company was pretty much complete, the way it stayed\npretty much through, by probably May, June. We were then Louisiana, Camp\n[indecipherable] until \u2014 through July, went on maneuvers for the month of\nAugust and then the word came down that we were going to be transferred\nprobably out to California, the whole division for amphibious training, and that\u2019s\nwhat happened.",
        "A: To California in September, we had about \u2014 been probably a span of two\nmonths of amphibious training, which was getting us ready for the south \u2014 the\nPacific. There\u2019s the small landing craft you see in the pictures of basically, you\nknow, like fre \u2014 quite a bit more. So we had a training camp, complete amphibious\ntraining. We finished that training at San Luis Obispo by mid-November.",
        "A: 1944, exactly. Waited and then back after San Luis Obispo, we\u2019ve been in\nsouthern California, basically in San Diego, December 17\" began the Battle of\nthe Bulge, which changed the picture tremendously. Word came down we were\ngoing to probably be going to the east coast, going to Europe. The requirement\nwas they needed more troops in Europe because of the impact of the bulge.\nApril 6, 1999",
        "A: Yes. Important because at that time you had to be 19 to be qualified for\noverseas training. And interestingly enough, back in June, those who\u2019d already\nattained age 19 of our group, privates, wer-were transferred out, more people\nbrought in. But that was the rule at the time. So we were 19 at the time, exactly.\nThe division got the information, we were put on a \u2014 on an emergency basis of\npacking. We were put on special details, cutting wood and so forth to get all the\ncrates together, to get all the material crap together, put together. That was\nfinished up by probably about mid-January and we were on the troop trains headed\neast to our division the end of January of 1945.",
        "A: And then we went east, and we \u2014 our particu \u2014 all \u2014 all of our regiment,\nbasically, went to Camp Miles Standish, which is about 30 miles \u2014 was about 30\nmiles south of Boston. Coming from California, bright, pleasant, into the snow of\nMassachusetts, quite a change. New equipment, we got some new uniforms, more\nadditional equipment than we had basically. We were there probably staging for\nabout a week, 10 days, and then early in February, onto the trains, down to the port\nof Boston and we sailed from Boston in about \u2014 oh, th \u2014 maybe the second week\nof February.\nApril 6, 1999",
        "A: Nota bit.",
        "A: Not a bit. On the matter of orientation, we all received from time to time, all of\nus have, the so-called why we fight series. That was a Walter Huston, as I recall,\nwas involved very much in that. And they were \u2014 they were \u2014 the first was why we\nfight generally and the whole history basically of the rise of Germany and Nazism\nand so forth. And then they would take it country by country, go into it. These\nwould be a series of documentary films we\u2019d have, as well as other films we were\nhaving on training, gas training and so forth, and f\u2014 and firing. But this was an\norientation series as I read it now, that really had been acted by Walter Huston,\ndirected by Capra, Frank Capra, he developed the whole series for the army, as I\nremember. So we learned why we were with England fighting, why we were\nbasically the free French, the Chinese [indecipherable] and the Russian. And\nthese were all good guys. And then the bad guys, of course, were the Japs. The\nmilitarism of the Japanese, and Pearl Harbor all over again and then of course in\nGermany the rise of Hitler and all the \u2014 the nasty Nazis and so forth.\nApril 6, 1999",
        "A: I don\u2019t know about eager. We were ready. We had trained completely and the\ntime had come. And I don\u2019t think that there was any question of eagerness. It was\na part of it. Maybe in the sense that we had friends and relatives and my \u2014 my\nsituation. My brother was by that time in military intelligence in South America.\nHe had acquired marvelous Spanish and so he became military intelligence,\nhowever \u2014 in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in the army. So we were ready, let me \u2014 let me put it\nthat way. And maybe the time had come, I \u2014 I\u2019m not sure. There was a lot of \u2014 get\na lot of \u2014 of patriotism about \u2014 to \u2014 to a modified degree. We \u2014 we were still in the\narmy, we complained and bitched, pardon the expression, but that was a part of it.\nBut our friends were over there, brothers, relatives overseas, so 1t was a part of it,\nit was expected.",
        "A: I felt \u2014 I felt more mature. I was no longer the baby of the family. I was one of\nmany, many people by that time, others of my \u2014 my \u2014 my peers, huh, and I was ar\n\u2014 I think probably more self c \u2014 more self confidence in myself and I know\nlooking back that the army made all the difference in the world to my growing up.\nBy that time, we\u2019re talking now, as I said, February of \u2014 of 1945, I\u2014 we had our\nfriends in our unit, good buddies and so forth. There was a lot of togetherness\nabout the whole thing.\nApril 6, 1999",
        "A: Our trip over was about 10 day \u2014 about 10 days, we \u2014 right at LaHavre. By\nthat time it had been secured, you see. Earlier it had to be brought in by\n[indecipherable] but this was right \u2014 right in LaHavre itself.",
        "A: We arrived \u2014 we debarked late at night, I recall, down onto the dock into great\nbig \u2014 big, huge trucks, large trucks. And I recall very well as we came down,\nwe're getting in. I went past the truck we were getting into. It happened to be the\none where our company commander, then Captain Mitchell was seated. And I\nrecall seeing Captain Mitchell looking up at the windshield, there was a bullet\nhole right through the windshield of the truck. Introduction. Before we had\ndebarked also, the guys, very juv \u2014 some are throwing candy bars over, and the\nsoldiers on [indecipherable] said, keep your candy, you\u2019re going to be dead in\nthree days. Well, ah \u2014 okay. All the trucks black at night, we drove over some \u2014\nthis is now LaHavre. We went, as I recall [indecipherable] and then on north to\nthe area called Old Gold. Now there were staging areas in France named for \u2014 for\n\u2014 for cigarettes. Old Gold, Lucky Strike, not as \u2014 but a large area. We were in the\nOld Gold area, which was right up \u2014 it was north of the town of Yvetot, y-v-e-t-o-\nt. The home of Madame Bovary in the novel, hm. Not \u2014 not Proust, but anyway \u2014\nApril 6, 1999\nMadame bo \u2014 however, we were about oh, eight or 10 miles north of \u2014 of Yvetot\nand as \u2014 right near a small French village called Normanville, n-o-r-m-a-n-v-i-l-\nl-e in large tents, large, large squad tents, cold and chilling. And we were located\nthere, staging for probably 10 days, two weeks, getting ready to go up to the front.\nSome more equipment, some more training. As is \u2014 as a\u2014 as a Squad scout I was\nsent with my fellow scouts up to so called mine, m-i-n-e school, up at Sassentot,\nS-a-S-S-e-n-t-0-t to learn about German mines. The teller, t-l-e \u2014 t-e-]-l-e-r mine,\nthat was like a plate [indecipherable] plate. The shoe mine, that\u2019s what you have\na \u2014 a variety of them. German explosives, Primacord, tetracord. Not th \u2014 we\nwould have much, but at \u2014 we theoretically, the scouts, you see, go out in front of\nthe squad to study the terrain and so forth and then the squad leader in charge\nbehind you controls your actions. So we had that, we were finishing that up and\nwe got the word, okay men, fold up your tents, we\u2019re going back, we\u2019re going to\nbe moving out, you\u2019re up tomorrow to the front. Back we went, down to\nNormanville and got ready to leave.",
        "A: Beg your pardon?\nApril 6, 1999",
        "A: We left, of all things, down to Yvetot, loaded onto 40 and eights, the old World\nWar I style 40 and eights, 40 men or eight horses, yeah. Quarante hommes ou\nhuit chevaux. In the boxcars, they were [indecipherable] small, strewn with\nstraw, wonderful, because you could sleep on the straw, but there we were. So we\nleft by this \u2014 by the train. Some units I guess went by truck, but we went by train,\nup through Amien, on up to Namur. Now by this time we\u2019re up in \u2014 getting up\ntoward Belgium. This \u2014 this took two or three days, long time. Namur, Li\u00e9ge. We\nwent through just a very small part of \u2014 of the Netherlands at Maastricht, m-\ndouble a-s-t-r-i-c-h-t. And then I remember we got really, really something to\nthink about because boy I remember going through Li\u00e9ge, I-i \u2014 ]-e-i-g, I think, | or\nI-i, whichever. There on a \u2014 on a fencepost was a German helmet, just stuck on\ntop. Hm, first evidence. Then we began seeing signs of \u2014 of a lot of damage, either\nartillery or \u2014 or bombing damage of the city. There was \u2014 of course, Li\u00e9ge was one\nof the early areas where f \u2014 where fighting took place. And then really, because\nthat particular day twilight was falling, we had already gone through Maastricht,\nand were there stopped when there was a \u2014 a \u2014 at least a false alarm, they thought\nof a German, an air attack, because our anti-aircraft guns, which were out near the\n\u2014 near the \u2014 near the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the train yard \u2014 railroad yards, began go \u2014\nin an action getting \u2014 nothing happened, but they \u2014 we \u2014 we saw they were there.\nApril 6, 1999\nBut then at \u2014 twilight came and then it became dark and we went through Aachen,\nwhich had been terribly destroyed. The moonlight, I remember driving on \u2014 riding\non the train basically, looking out and seeing all of these ghostly white buildings\nout there, just \u2014 just the ruins, huh, of th-the \u2014 the destruction of Aachen. We \u2014",
        "A: You \u2014 it\u2019s pretty spooky. That was our first major di \u2014 war damage we\u2019d seen.\nIt was pretty spooky. I think we were getting pretty silent by that time, watching\nwhat was going past. I was on guard that night, which meant that you \u2014 the sentry\nseated there on the \u2014 tha-that open doorway, basically. And I saw a lot of it as we\nwent through and I think we had two hours basically and \u2014 but you watched and\nwent through. Still awake and I think it was probably mid-morning, black of the\nmorn \u2014 I mean, by \u2014 by two or three in the morning. We arrived at the city of\nDuren, d-u-r-e-n in Germany, we were in Germany now. Off the trains and on\nthe big trucks, which we call six by sixes. Six wheels and all six [indecipherable],\nth \u2014 we call them six by sixes. Out of the trucks and heading then \u2014 we left Duren.\nAnd they pointed out to us as we went through \u2014 went through a \u2014 a city square, I\ndon\u2019t know who pointed out to us, a statue there of a \u2014 of \u2014 I don\u2019t know what it\nwas. But earlier bombardment had been so intense that the statue, the bronze\nstatue had completely turned around. It had been facing one direction and now it\nApril 6, 1999\nwas facing the other direction. [phone ringing, tape break] On the statue, which\nwas of a bro-bronze, as near as we could tell, it\u2019s s-still dark in the morning, but\nthere \u2014 there were \u2014 there \u2014 there were truck lights. They pointed out the fact that\nit had apparently originally been facing on \u2014 to \u2014 t-to the west, but the \u2014 the\narterial bombardment they had had in Duren was so intense that it had just shifted,\nthe statue was facing east. Weird, weird. So here was dark, middle of the morning,\ncold, chilly. We \u2014 we were \u2014 we were course 1n \u2014 1n-1n-in March now. And out of\nDuren we drove, heading east toward Cologne.",
        "A: One had a -\u2014 one had a different feeling. We were there first time again on re \u2014\nyou know, on \u2014 on \u2014 on\u2014 on enemy soil. Lot of curiosity what it looked like\nStrangely, in my situation I kind of \u2014 could kind of relate back because of the tales\nof my Aunt Agnes and being in Germany and so forth and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and what\nlittle German she had, there were the signs and so forth we would see, you know,\nthe directional signs. I didn\u2019t know much German at all. I have a little more now,\nbut not that much. Then, of course, in the morning it began getting lighter, you\nknow, eerily morning. And began reli \u2014 we were driving through an area now\nheading east on the \u2014 a main, a fairly main roadway toward Cologne, which I\nApril 6, 1999\nthink probably was about, I\u2019m guessing 30 - 40 miles east of Duren. But here we\nwere, of course, basically in a truck going on east. We had seen, oh, forests to one\nside and then buildings. Then began to see a lot of bomb damage or some kind of\ndamage to buildings, basically. And then we probably got into Cologne, I\u2019m\nguessing, in the con \u2014 with the truck convoy by \u2014 by seven, eight o\u2019clock in the\nmorning, I\u2019m guessing. And that was something else. The \u2014 Cologne had been\nbadly damaged, and yet, way up ahead were the two huge spires of the Cologne\ncathedral. Some damage, but they were standing, they were still there. And then\noff \u2014 truck stopped off into the house, and then in \u2014 into houses, apartments where\nwe were being billeted. So then we were there in Cologne. Now, at that point\nsomething different happened. These were apartment houses, people\u2019s belongings,\nI mean their furniture and so forth. And somebody, strangely enough, began\ntossing the contents out of the windows into the central courtyard, just\nindiscriminately. And, was it the result of being in a foreign country, the enemy\ncountry? A strange thing but it just seemed to catch on and \u2014 and on just a \u2014 still I\nlook back and why in the world that was done, but a \u2014 just tossed to get rid of it, I\nguess, stuff out of the \u2014 out of the rooms, into the courtyard tha \u2014 then emptied the\nrooms out and we cou \u2014 we slept in them. A strange thing. I \u2014 I still wonder why it\nwas done.\nApril 6, 1999",
        "A: In Cologne, people were all, I presume had been evicted or gotten out of \u2014\nbefore we came in. I don\u2019t remember seeing a lot of civilians in ca \u2014 where we\nwere in Cologne itself. Later, yes, bu-but not in Cologne itself.",
        "A: We were there, I\u2019d say oh, maybe oh, a couple days. I remember of that that we\nwere begin getting \u2014 we getting broadcasts from the BBC because their signal \u2014\nwell, we had \u2014 some guys had radios, I vi \u2014 it was that the \u2014 that tune about Bow\nBells, bum bum bum bum bum, buddle um bum, bum bum bum. That was the\nsignal of the BBC. [indecipherable] the Bow Bell, whatever, yeah. And we \u2014 then\nwe got the news from England, British accents and everything, oh yeah. Getting\nthings ready, I remember basically we were told we\u2019d be there a few days. I\nremember the day before we left, they took us all up, we went up to the \u2014 the attic\narea, huh. It was a la \u2014 fairly large area. And there we were briefed in. We had\nbeen designated as taper red able. Taper red able, code word. Taper was the 86\"\ndivision. Red, the 342\u2122, able, A company, hm. So that was the designation and\nthey told us what to expect. They meaning, I think it was Captain Mitchell and na\n\u2014 cap-captain \u2014 then Lieutenant Greenburg(ph), who we met. We were going to\nbe assigned, said they, up on the Rhine river, in of all things, the Ford factory.\nApril 6, 1999\nWas a major factory before the war that Ford had built and we were gonna be sent\nthere as our \u2014 as our location up on the Rhine, okay. Left fairly \u2014 as I remember\nwe \u2014 we left fairly early because we went in at nighttime and we relieved the eight\ninfantry division, which was already there, the men were there. And I remember\ngoing into the bunkers and we \u2014 and \u2014 and with \u2014 was \u2014 was rather wide-eyed\nbecause here were their old veterans, I mean you \u2014 they\u2019d been \u2014 th-the eighth had\nbeen in combat quite awhile. And different. They were a pretty rough, tough\noutfit. And amazingly, the first real eye opener when we got there, one of the\nmedics was there. Now, the medics, every platoon had a \u2014 had a \u2014 had a medic,\nhm, and they were not armed, their helmets had great big red \u2014 white circles with\nred cross. The medic that was with that particular group, in the \u2014 in the bunker\n[indecipherable] with eight \u2014 eighth \u2014 with the eighth \u2014 of the eighth division,\nstrange guys. Projecting out of his aid kit was \u2014 was a bone. Whether it was an\nanimal bone, but you know, that \u2014 that \u2014 well, really, where are we, what are we\ndoing here? Any event, the eighth then \u2014 the eighth \u2014 the men of the eighth\ndivision pulled out and we were then in place in the Ford factory. And that\u2019s\nwhere we saw our first \u2014 the first beginning evidence that we\u2019re having and that\nwe\u2019re in combat.\nApril 6, 1999",
        "A: A \u2014 hadn\u2019t seen what, I\u2019m sorry?",
        "A: No. Some, but not \u2014 not \u2014 not \u2014 oh, maybe some people walking on the street,\nthat kind of a thing, but no-nothing \u2014 nothing to get tha \u2014 no, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: We were in the Ford factory, I\u2019m guessing probably about a week. That\u2019s\nwhen we first began to realize we were there because the Germans were our \u2014 on\nthe opposite side of the Rhine. Now we \u2014 we\u2019re now on the left or th-the \u2014 the \u2014\nthe west bank, all right. Germans on the east side. And the Rhine at that point,\nvery sizeable. I\u2019d say the Rhine was probably maybe a half a mile wide. It was\nwide. And we could look over and see there was a village over there. And we\nwould go up in the \u2014 in the \u2014 1n the \u2014 in the structure of the Ford factory. It was\njust as if the workers had walked away, there were big \u2014 there were rather big\nassembly lines, there were engines on the assembly lines being put together, but\nthey were all gone, but \u2014 and walked in, there was a great big [indecipherable]\ninside. Cologne, thanks to the second armored division, they\u2019d already bi \u2014\nsomebody painted it up there [indecipherable]. We were there, I\u2019d say, about that\nlength of time, but from time to time we were getting artillery coming in, just\nnuisance that the Germans had put across. Our fir \u2014 introduction to the 88, which\nApril 6, 1999\nwas the 88 millimeter ca \u2014 a remarkable weapon the Germans had. First of all, it\nwas \u2014 it was began, it was ta \u2014 it was tested in the Spanish Civil War by the\nGermans. It was anti-aircraft, could reach way up [indecipherable]. It could also\nbe a Howitzer, which is a \u2014 and a flat trajectory. And I remember that\u2019s the first\nexperience, I remember we would \u2014 the flat traje \u2014 that was really spooky because\nthe Germans would fire in and this sharp crack and that\u2019s the first you knew it\u2019s \u2014\nit was there. And it was \u2014 it was \u2014 it was frightening. That was our first\n[indecipherable] mm-hm. Okay.",
        "A: Yeah. We were there for about a week. Then we were told we\u2019re gonna be\npulled out and indeed we were. We were replaced by the 82\" airborne division,\nnow that had had experience already during the war. And as we \u2014 I remember as\nwe were walking out, marching out past the \u2014 past the cut \u2014 en-entry kiosk they\nhave there, in were coming men of the 824, we were on the outside, yes. And I\nremember walking past, looking up and there was this great big, tall, tall soldier,\ntwo big stars. It was General Gavin \u2014 Gavin. We saw him. Then we were pulled\nout into trucks and dropped, taken back into a German town some distance back.\nNow there we did see civilians for the first ttme. We were moved into the house,\nwe were supposed to be there for a day or so, something, til we\u2019re moved on\nApril 6, 1999\nfarther. But there was the conversation, what little German I had with \u2014 with one\nof the ladies there, because she \u2014 she was very upset, very unhappy. This 1s\n[indecipherable] this is your war, this is nicht unsere. This is not our war, this is\nzine(ph) war, this 1s your war, she was saying. But she wa \u2014 she was very, very\nupset about things. We didn\u2019t accept it of course, but that\u2019s the way it was. We\nwere there a limited time only and then we were take \u2014 put \u2014 back on the buses \u2014\non the bus \u2014 on the trucks again, six by sixes, and this was the long trip we had.\nThis was really, now will take us into Germany itself, okay. We left that suburb\no-of Cologne, but not until after we became aware of the first fatality we\u2019d had in\nour company. We had some injuries because as the Germans were dropping these\nshells across, one shell I recall, an 88 fell right into th \u2014 into the kitchen area and\ninjured, didn\u2019t \u2014 not badly, some of the cooks, shrapnel. And \u2014 an-and you had to\nwatch it because you could sometimes hear the shells coming in and you\u2019d duck.\nAnd that was pretty unnerving for \u2014 this was our first [indecipherable]. But then\nwe had learned and got the whole story, it was a \u2014 it was a bad situation, unhappy.\nSomebody, an officer had determined it was necessary to have an reconnaissance\npatrol across the Rhine. Why, I\u2019m not sure, but there \u2014 maybe to make a record or\nsomething, but they saw a set up and A company supplied \u2014 I was not in\u2014 A\ncompany supplied a number of the men, and went off at nighttime, boats, rubber\nApril 6, 1999\nboats across the Rhine. Lieutenant Henry, who \u2014 fine, he was a good man, of the\nfirst platoon, was in charge. The patrol was probably about \u2014 I\u2019m guessing\nprobably, I understand about 15 or 20, two boats. They got across and as\nreconstructed later they came back. Tell \u2014 the story came back and we were told\nthat they got over to the other shore, dark. Apparently there was \u2014 there had been a\nlot of firing and there was smoke drifting back and forth. And \u2014 and what\nhappened was \u2014 was one of those drastic, terrible things that happens in combat.\nThe two scouts moved out ahead. They were probably, as we get, maybe 10 or 15\nyards ahead of the patrol itself.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nApril 6, 1999\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: The scouts had gotten out ahead, maybe 10 or 15 yards or so, and as we get the\nstory, the main patrol was behind them. The main patrol saw then, two figures\ncoming at them in the dark. They gave the password. The challenged party is\nsupposed to answer. The parties did not answer. Somebody in the patrol opened\nfire, only to discover afterwards it was the scouts coming back, our own people.\nAnd Corny Rippons was killed, he was one of them, the other I\u2019m not sure. They\ntried, apparently then, to carry Corny\u2019s body back. They couldn't get it all the way\nback and they had to leave him over there, basically, back they came. But that was\nour first \u2014 one of \u2014 one of those terrible thi \u2014 I mean, you know, the matter of the\nso-called friendly fire. As I think General Schwarzkopf said once, once the\nmissile leaves the barrel, it\u2019s no longer friendly. But it was a bad thing, so we \u2014 on\nthat \u2014 on that note then, we learned about that basically. And then \u2014 then after that,\nthe next day or so came our continuing trip on into Germany farther. To go and\npick that up, we left during the day, six by sixes again, the same trucks, parallel\ndown through Cologne itself and then on south to Bonn. And we\u2019re going through\nApril 6, 1999\nBonn, later of course, the capitol of the west \u2014 West Germany, a ba \u2014 interesting\nold town. I remember from Aunt Agnes\u2019 [indecipherable] that was the birthplace\nof Beethoven, here are these things coming back. We wound up someth \u2014 south of\nBonn and then onto a pontoon bridge to cross the Rhine. We crossed the Rhine\nthen at a pontoon bridge. We could see to the south what were called the\nDrachenfels, that\u2019s part of that \u2014 tha \u2014 of the other Wagnerian business. And there\nwere \u2014 there were \u2014 there were barrage balloons farther south. We learned later\nthat\u2019s the point where the first bridge had been captured across the Rhine at\nRemagen, it\u2019s quite a way south, but we saw the balloons. Then \u2014 now by this\ntime we were really now on the east side of the Rhine and moving deeper into\nGermany. We crossed several remarkably interesting roads, because they were\nautobahns that had built, you know, by the Reich in \u2014 and the Germans in the\n1930\u2019s as \u2014 as big work projects. We crossed them. So we got the ti \u2014 we got the\nword autobahn right away. But farther into Germany we began seeing more\nsigns of combat. There were destroyed tanks, American tanks and\n[indecipherable] tanks, too. We went through, oh I would say some 60 miles or\nso east, a major town called Siegen, s-i-e-g-e-n, and then we turned north up into\nwhat was called the Ruhr pocket, called that because about a week or 10 days\nbefore, two major American armored thrusts, armored divisions had moved east\nApril 6, 1999\nparallel to each other, about 60 - 70 miles apart, between them being the German\nRuhr, which was the great industrial area, and 1s, actually. Dusseldorf, Duren,\nEssen and so forth. Then, as these two armored thrusts went east, they began to\ncome together in out at area called Paderborn, p-a-d-e-r-b-o-r-n-e. They joined.\nThat became within that, what was called the Ruhr pocket. Then the plan\napparently was that they would \u2014 Americans, we would bring in reinforcing\ndivisions along where those two big pincers \u2014 p-i-n-c-e-r-s had come together.\nThe divisions would then, on the south side turn to the north, on the north side turn\nto the south and gradually converge to come together to eliminate the pocket. We\nwere one of those divisions. Other divisions were the 78\", the men of the eighth\ndivision, I\u2019Il come back that, that we had re-reinforced \u2014 replaced, they come into\nthe pocket. The 97\" division was there, on the south side. We were taken to a\nsmall town called Zimmersbach(ph) z-i-m-e-r-s-b-a-c-h \u2014 z-i-m-m-e-r-b-a-c-h.\nSmall, tiny, tiny town. We were billeted in a house, a great, huge manure pile out\nin front, typically of \u2014 of a \u2014 of a\u2014 of a German peasant area. A comfortable\nhouse, so we \u2014 we \u2014 it was good because we \u2014 the guys could find eggs and we\nfried eggs and so we were there a matter of two or three days getting final\ntogetherness and getting things ready. I remember nearby, it was a Sunday, we\nattended church, and one of the medics we had was a \u2014 a very accomplished\nApril 6, 1999\norganist who played the German organ there. I remember seeing in the front\ncemetery of the church there was some \u2014 some \u2014 some graves which had been\nobviously German soldiers buried there, I mean they [indecipherable] where they\nwere buried. Then \u2014 then we left that area, April eighth of 1945, we were taken by\nour six by sixes 1n the final \u2014 the final stretch \u2014 or we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re hiking, we\u2019re \u2014\nwe are on foot, into a wooded area, because we\u2019re getting ready to take off, as we\nsay, if we jump off in the attack the next day. So we\u2019re rowt \u2014 right up \u2014 right\npractically at the front. And spent the night there in bivouac, not tents, we just s-\nslept outside, basically. And then early the next morning we \u2014 we jumped off in\nthe attack. That would have been April ninth now, of 1945. To the north \u2014 nor-\nnorthwest actually, into the pocket. Then, next several days, our first major\nincursion into the area, the area was called Sauerland, s-a-u-e-r-l-a-n-d.\nSauerland, one word, I-a-n-d, because apparently the soil was \u2014 was \u2014 of all\nstrange things to know \u2014 but it was very rugged country, wooded. I-I-In the\ninfantry we say, excellent defensive terrain for the defender, huh. We moved\nthrough it. Not much was happening, however. The Germans were pulling back,\nthere was some occasional firefights there, not much. And I remember several\ntimes there, we \u2014 we did experience German mortars coming in as they were\ndefending, but not \u2014 not a great deal. It was a fast push, because we would be on\nApril 6, 1999\nthe way most of the time. We \u2014 at nighttime we\u2019d grab a few hours sleep if we\ncould, maybe in a \u2014 1n a\u20141n a\u2014I remember sleeping one night on the \u2014 on the \u2014\non the \u2014 on the kitchen floor. Another night we were \u2014 and that was lucky, we\nwere in a barn, and they had some straw. But pretty much we were pushing. And\nthat would have been Monday we jumped off, Tuesday that way. And then it was\non Wednesday, which was April 11 when we began \u2014 I si\u2014 remember seeing a\nsign in gothic print, Attendorn, a-t-t-e-n-d-o-r-n, three k-ms ahead. And that was\nwhen we began really approaching Attendorn and that\u2019s \u2014 that was our first major\ncombat.",
        "A: We were on the reverse, or south side of a hill, in strength, meaning we were \u2014\nwe were \u2014 we were actually well reinforced, the whole thing. We \u2014 A company at\nthat time was the \u2014 was in the lead. To explain, I am the lead. Normally in a\nbattalion, if the battalion, for example is committed, two companies would be side\nby side, the third in reserve. And the same with two bi \u2014 there might be two ba \u2014\nbattalions there, and the third in reserve. At that time A company then, we \u2014 we\nwere leading in the attack into this town called Attendorn. And the result was, up\nthe hillside, I remember then around the c \u2014 as we made the curve on a roadway\nand began working through the trees, we looked across and there was a treeburst\nApril 6, 1999\non the distant hill. Let me explain treeburst. Artillery shells are so constructed,\neither number one, they\u2019re solid shells, or secondly explosive shells. Explosive\nshells are ones that have a very sensitive tip on the end. And the minute that even\ntouches any object, even a twig, it would explode. Very sen \u2014 and in a fa \u2014 in an\nartillery barrage, if the barrage is going into wooded area, as it would hit the trees,\nit\u2019d break and that\u2019s called a treeburst. Very, very dangerous because of the \u2014 the\nshell \u2014 shrapnel just spins right down. That was at a distance though, but \u2014 I\u2019m\nspeaking to you. Then we came around the top of the hill and then ahead of us, red\ntile roof and so on, was this very sizable town, which was Attendorn. We came\nup through \u2014 I si \u2014 the company, I mean basically, I remember we\u2019re coming past\nsome of the units of our cannon company, the cannon company and \u2014 the cannon\ncompany is a large, self propelled, it\u2019s a one-oh-five. Lieutenant Greenburg(ph)\nof our company at that particular time, was our assistant company commander, but\nhe also has some direction and control over the fourth platoon, the weapons\nplatoon, he was helping on that too. Weapons platoon then began setting up\nmachine gun for so-called covering fire because then we got the order and our\nplatoon, third platoon began going down a rather steep hill on the run, on the\ndouble, rifles up well, ther-there ha \u2014 we call porter, to attack the town. And then\nwe began getting a lot of fire from the Germans 88s. We learned afterwards that\nApril 6, 1999\nthe entire Ruhr was so much attacked by allied aircraft that they had a tremendous\namount, the Germans, of anti-aircraft material. 88s and 20-20s. When there were\nno longer these air attacks because the stage the war, they would simply level\nthose and use against the aca \u2014 ca\u2014 oncoming Americans. So we had a lot of \u2014 a\nlot of 88s coming in, artillery. There was a 20 millimeter ak-ak, and as we started\ndown the hill, 3\" platoon began taking casualties. We had a sergeant who was\nkilled, our lieutenant was injured. Several others were injured down the late \u2014 way,\ntoo, basically. This was, as I said, our first real experience of combat. And it\u2019s a\nstrange thing. You\u2019re there, it\u2019s happening to you, and yet fortunately, because of\nthe discipline you\u2019ve had, you \u2014 you\u2019re scared, right down in the pit of your\nstomach, but \u2014 but y-y-you do it, you go on. Then into this house right nearby \u2014 I\nsa \u2014I say, then, a number of us. And then Dave Sargent(ph) \u2014 Sergeant Dave, a\nsergeant, I remember, was outside, he said okay, because then the next thing we\nhad to do out of the house, Dave directed us down the hill, we went on down the\nhill to cross a river, a small stream, waist high. Cold, though. Up the other side\nbasically and I\u2014 I\u2014I\u2019d had \u2014 I forgot, basically, but my sergeant says, Pete,\nyou\u2019re the first one across. So I crossed the river, up onto the other side, cold,\nrifles held high to keep them dry, and there was sniper fire coming in over the\nrailroad. Then across the railroad, we got across okay, but you get \u2014 for the first\nApril 6, 1999\ntime you\u2019re getting some vicious snapping \u2014 you know, th-the \u2014 or sniping,\naround. Then it seems that the Germans must have pulled out. We learned\nhowever, later on, that one of our men, fourth platoon was asked and did, because\nhe had good German, go in with a white flag and their at \u2014 their \u2014 see if they\nsurrender. The company man who thought they might. They wouldn\u2019t. The name\nwas Bob Oelke, o-e-I-k-e. The Germans ignored the white flag, grabbed him,\ntossed him in the cellar. With presence of mind he went into the next room,\nbecause they tossed in some grenades after him, he was alright, he later escaped.\nBut that we learned later. Into the town and then we began moving through. We,\nmeaning the third platoon, we were still there. Now, at that time, as we moved\nalong, by this time it\u2019s probably three, four in the afternoon. Cobblestone streets,\nrifles on the ready, covering each other. This is called a mopping up operation. But\nthe Germans seemed to have pulled out \u2014 I mean, I don\u2019t remember anything more\nat that time. And it was then, as we were going up this cobblestone street\n[indecipherable] that we approached a factory area. Obviously there was some \u2014\nand then behind this barbed wire fence were these people, unkempt, dirty,\nemaciated and Mac \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, MacGilvery(ph), in charge, I was behind him,\nwent up and opened the gate. Now, at this point I must explain that for some\nreason, for some reason, I do not personally recall Mac opening the gate, but I\nApril 6, 1999\nhave talked to him, I say Mac is Sergeant MacGilvery(ph) of Dallas, Texas. He \u2014\nhe had detail \u2014 details I'd forgotten. Strange about memory, some things you \u2014 but\nMac is very explicit that he\u2019d opened the gate. The people were in there. They\nrealized apparently we\u2019re Americans, uniforms ra \u2014 they began crowding out and\n\u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and trying to embrace us, and \u2014 and \u2014 and kiss us apparently. I\ndon\u2019t recall that. But one thing that was pervasive apparently, and this was\nconfirmed by \u2014 by sar \u2014 Dave Sargent, there at the time, sergeant and later on by\nLieutenant \u2014 then Lieutenant, now Captain Greenburg(ph), horrible, heavy, heavy\nstench and odor. Again, I \u2014 this I didn\u2019t recall and I\u2019m surprised because I\u2019m\nnormally pretty aware of olfactory things. But 1t was there, amb \u2014 obviously. What\nI do recall though now, very clearly, myself. We had gone into a nearby building,\nbecause Mac\u2019s determination was we gotta \u2014 gotta watch out for whate \u2014 there\nmight be krauts around. Kraut being the derogative name for German. There\nmight be krauts here, they gotta check it out. And I remember stepping into the\nbuilding now, and I think it \u2014 it was a large room, maybe 50 by 50 or so. And I do\nremember there were \u2014 there were some bodies lying around and I remember Mac\nstarted to walk over across the room. Now, 1n his detail, Sergeant\nMacGilvery(ph), Mac said that there was a skull that he recognized, it \u2014 he \u2014 he\u2019s\nfrom Texas. It was horse\u2019s skeleton. And walked over. This I remember too, beca\nApril 6, 1999\n\u2014 he walked over and there was an old \u2014 to me appeared to be an old woman,\ncrouched down, holding something. And \u2014 and Mac was over there, paused for a\nmoment, came back, fury in his eyes and said, now I\u2019m being explicit. Those\ngoddamn fucking krauts, look how they treat these poor sons of bitches. The lady\nis scraping out that horse\u2019s skull for food and eating it. Gee, well. He also said,\nforget about the goddamn horse, they\u2019ve scraped all the meat off that too. There\nwas a heavy \u2014 I remember it now, this at \u2014 there was a heavy odor and \u2014 and we\nwalked past and \u2014 and there was a body. I\u2019m not sure dead or alive, but \u2014 but \u2014 but\nMac pointed out the face and he \u2014 he \u2014 look at that poor son of a bitch\u2019s legs, they\nwere \u2014 they were apparently gangrenous and this heavy odor must have been\nputrid-putri-putrefaction, I\u2019m guessing. Back out into the street, fresh air thank\nGod, because all the other \u2014 and on back out and I remember we got back out in\nthe street and as our patrol got back out there, somebody behind me was throwing\nup, one of our guys be \u2014 just \u2014 just the impact of it. And Mac said, and I did\nremember this, that a lot of \u2014 they were laborers mostly, whatever, you know\n[indecipherable] people were out in the street, they just kind of wandered out, the\ngate was open. A \u2014 an officer came along and advised that we had to get them\nback inside because they needed attention, whatever. And they could not be\nwandering the street by themselves, so somehow, and I don\u2019t recall, they must\nApril 6, 1999\nhave been herded back in, because after that then we \u2014 we moved ahead and we\nwere on our way after that.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Not \u2014 not that I remember. Now, in my \u2014 in \u2014 in my notes \u2014 and I mention\nnotes because \u2014 I-I must go ahead, I\u2019ll fast \u2014 fast forward a moment. When we had\ngotten back from Europe, we had a 30 day \u2014 a 30 day furlough. We were the first\ndivision back from Europe, big welcome, but we have 30 days. And during that\ntime I sat down and typed out my \u2014 a log. Now in \u2014 in that log that I have \u2014 I-I got\nit \u2014 well, of course, it was so fresh then. I c \u2014 I could do it day by day and the\ntowns, the names of towns and guys names. I showed basically in that \u2014 and if I\nmay refer for a moment to this. This \u2014 this isn\u2019t my original log. And turning now\non it to April 11\", and here we are at Attendorn. I am showing here things that\nI\u2019ve touched upon quite a bit before, some other details that don\u2019t relate to this, but\nas to this particular matter, through the houses, as we\u2019re going up the street, into\nthe town. Pillbox warehouses, first platoon to our right flank, went through houses,\ncapture of a German ak-ak crew in the photo shop. West and south along the\n[indecipherable] past the bridge to the left, with an 88 covering, okay. Through\nApril 6, 1999\nthe factory into \u2014 I [indecipherable] a Russian prisoner enclosure. Now, whether\nwe were told they were Russians, I have no recollection o-of the \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t\nknow Russian probably, well if I\u2014 you know, I could guess, but \u2014 when I\u2019d heard\nit basically. And I don\u2019t recall any conversation with the people.",
        "A: I don\u2019t \u2014I don\u2019t recall that, but Mac in his recitation says that they were trying\nto grab us and so forth. We probably pushed them off. Again, this heavy, terrible\nodor, and \u2014 and \u2014 and Lieutenant Greenburg(ph) who was there at the time, and I\nhadn\u2019t realized this, he said it was caused probably, mostly from lot of \u2014 the\nlatrines. The latrines were only ditches dug there, said captain, about 30 - 40 feet\nlong, full of excrement and \u2014 an-and \u2014 and other elimination that caused this\nterribly heavy odor that was there. But as far as \u2014 I don\u2019t recall the touching, but\nMac says that they were trying to grab us.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Th-These were not \u2014 these were not prison type uniforms\nat all. They just seemed to be, as I remember, just civilian clothes, but rags \u2014\nragged, torn and so forth.",
        "A: I do not recall \u2014\nApril 6, 1999",
        "A: \u2014 seeing any young people. Now Mac mentions that there was an episode, a\npart of that we left there, said he that there was a woman who apparently it was a \u2014\nhad been a prisoner, who \u2014 who apparently was \u2014 was getting at and be-beating up\na German woman who may have been a guard. Now, as near as \u2014 apparently there\nwere both men and women there. Whether they were housed together, I-I have no\nidea.",
        "A: Not long. My own recollection was that \u2014 that our \u2014 our going into the room\nwhere the \u2014 the horse\u2019s skeleton was, probably three, maybe five minutes at the\noutside, because it was, as I said, Mac got right over, saw what it was, and we just\nleft pretty quickly. There were no German soldiers at all to run \u2014 there \u2014 there \u2014\nthere \u2014 the Germans had pulled out apparently \u2014 apparently. So we were out of\nthere within oh, I\u2019d say probably five minutes. A little longer, then probably get\nout of the compound, back out on the street again.",
        "A: Not too my knowledge. Not to my knowledge. The situation has been really\ndefined by Lieutenant, now Captain Greenburg(ph) quite well. When, as we look\nat it in the context of that whole day, we had had a drastic experience coming in. I\nApril 6, 1999\nmean, the \u2014 we \u2014 th-the fighting and so forth, and the weaponry. And \u2014 and \u2014 and\nthis was just one other part of it, and \u2014 and it did not really assume any great\nimportance until a more recent time, when we realize now, seeing what was\nhappening elsewhere in Germany, the scenes we\u2019ve seen of the death camps.\nNow, there were \u2014 I\u2019m told \u2014 historians \u2014 a good friend who\u2019s an historian says\nthat there were no death camps up in the Ruhr. Slave labor camps only, which \u2014\nwhich apparently the Germans had established the industry to set little satellite\nareas where prisoners would be required that th \u2014 th-the labors to build parts or\nsomething of that type, which would then be taken in and used by the German\nindustry in the major cities of Diisseldorf, whatever. But that was a part of \u2014 of the\nwhole program. But, backing into their appearance, there was emaciation basically\nand \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 but the \u2014 but the \u2014 that the clothes, they were wearing\nrags, tags, but they were not uniforms, as I recall. Just not uniform types.",
        "A: Very different. Different. I don\u2019t know that it was any more frightening than\nwhat we\u2019d already had, I mean in the combat side of it, you know, from the firing\nand so forth. I-I think \u2014 I think it was just, we accepted it, but without really\npaying a great deal of attention to it at the time. I mean, it was there, we saw, it\nwas there basically it was bad, it was horrible.\nApril 6, 1999",
        "A: It was different in the sense that the \u2014 the \u2014 these were not combatants, not\ncombatants, and how they could be used that way, later on upon reflection, you\nrealize, yeah. At the time, that\u2019s the way it was, but then you begin to think about\nit afterwards and yeah, there\u2019s a part of the \u2014 the incongruity of it, I mean, the fact\nthat they were simply civilians, I would say.",
        "A: Oh, the usual. The usual oaths and so forth and expressions of you know, to put\nit bluntly, Jesus Christ, what the hell are we seeing, what was \u2014 well, all \u2014 all \u2014 all\n\u2014 all \u2014 without going \u2014 becoming too explicit, but you get the idea, I mean, gee, I\nmean, my God, it \u2014 1t was \u2014 it was an incredible thing, yeah. I suppose the \u2014 the\npassage of years puts a \u2014 puts a different complexion on it. I know that \u2014 that as\nfar as other parts of combat, guys were killed, we recognized it, accepted it. And I\nrealized, it wasn\u2019t until maybe after getting home, the 30 day span of time, it really\nbegan to come back of what we had been through and seen. I wonder if probably\nin that situation you \u2014 you \u2014 you develop a sort of an inurement to that. I-I know\nthat was our discipline, held us together despite the fear, the terror. And \u2014 and \u2014\nApril 6, 1999\nand \u2014 and \u2014 and to be, for example in a \u2014 1n a -- an artillery barrage is a \u2014 1s \u2014 1s \u2014\nis \u2014 1s a gut grinding \u2014 you know, experience. But we were there, and \u2014 and \u2014 and\nit was a part of it. Some guys \u2014 we had a few that \u2014 that chickened out, that\ncouldn't handle it. My sergeant \u2014 not \u2014 not \u2014 well, not \u2014 not Mac, he was fine, but\nmy own squad sergeant, we got through Attendorn, if this is a part of what you\nwant, we were talking about, we got through Attendorn to the other side, came\nback on the same railroad again, dropped down to take a few minutes break\nbasically, and then Sergeant Markson(ph) from Iowa, good chap, and my own\nsergeant, George Evans just flopped down. George was ashen. He said, I can\u2019t\ntake this shit, he says, I\u2014 I can\u2019t do it. Bud came down pretty \u2014 he said, George,\nGod damnit, you got the stripes, this is our job. And maybe that did it, but \u2014 but \u2014\nbut \u2014 but he \u2014 geor \u2014 he was out of it. Now, I think he got put back together\nhimself a lit \u2014 later on. But \u2014 but at the time, he couldn\u2019t. It happened, and you\ncouldn\u2019t \u2014 from unexpected persons, it ha-happened. You would have expected\nsome others, who you think might be washouts, did well. It \u2014 it \u2014 1t \u2014 th-there\u2019s no\nrule of thumb. But that was a particular experience at that time. You speak about\nthe matter of what we had seen and so forth. I-I don\u2019t know, there wasn\u2019t a lot of\ndiscussion afterwards, we went through it, that was it. Other things were taking\nApril 6, 1999\npriority. I mean, you know, your own safety and your own welfare and what was\ngoing to happen next.\nwhat?",
        "A: We stayed there that night. We finished through the town probably by six,\nseven o\u2019clock. We were assigned there and the next thing that they \u2014 that the \u2014\nCaptain Mitchell did was to establish a guard perimeter around the hills around\nthe town. So the nor \u2014 the north hilltop. And Sergeant Evans and myself and\nFrank Horn went up to one hilltop and were there that night. And that-that was\nthe night later on that we got machine gun fire in the black of the night and \u2014 and\nin the topography of it, on the hilltop, George above me and to the north, Frank\nHorn above me a bit and to the south, and I was down. Machine gun fire, George\nwas \u2014 was killed almost immediately and Frank so badly shot up in the back, he \u2014\ntha-that \u2014 that \u2014 back to battalion aid and died several days later, I guess. All I got,\na \u2014 incredibly fortunate, just a flesh wound in my \u2014 in the \u2014 my \u2014 in my left leg.\nand that night?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t realize what had happened about getting a \u2014 th-th-the [indecipherable]\nmy leg, until the next morning. We came off the hilltop that night. Our \u2014 our \u2014 our\nApril 6, 1999\nmedic Hank Billskey(ph) was right there, I see him now, he was right there,\namazing, after this happened. My captain, Captain Greenburg(ph), who is here in\nWashington with me, we\u2019ve had [indecipherable] we talked about that this\nmorning. He was describing some of the things that happened to him, so \u2014 these\nclose calls. Friend he had been in OCS with was killed with a treeburst about\nthree or four feet away from him. And as I told him, I said, Captain, I can \u2014 I can\nsit here and right now, I ca \u2014 I can hear \u2014 I can hear George gurgling as he was\ndying. I can hear \u2014 I can hear Frank \u2014 when Billskey(ph) got there he said, I need\na sa\u2014I need a syrette. That \u2014 that was a morphine syrette. An-And Hank says\nmy God, he said, good for you. In \u2014 in it \u2014 he \u2014 he co \u2014 he could name it\n[indecipherable] right there. So, it could come right back, I don\u2019t know that there\nwas any particular sign of aging at the time. I-It doesn\u2019t \u2014 it doesn\u2019t come that\nperemptorily. You realize after you\u2019ve gone all through these things that \u2014 that \u2014\nyou know, you had them. Bur as far as an immediate recognition, it\u2019s just a part of\nthe whole damn thing.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B\nApril 6, 1999",
        "A: A-As commented, I think \u2014 I think that at the time there is a \u2014 there \u2014 there 1s\nan insulation, I suppose, that is given you by your \u2014 your discipline that you have,\nto a degree. Other things become so drastic that you \u2014 something I suppose, maybe\nmentally helps block them out. To get through them you have to. Maybe, as I\nsuggested, it was only after getting back in a peacetime setting like the \u2014 our har \u2014\nour months furlough. And I remember it happened when I was home, after we\u2019d\ngotten back from Europe, th-the month between, we went back several times, I ca\n\u2014 I kind of \u2014 and I-I-I know that the death of a couple guys swept back. George,\nFrank\u2019s did, some others we had then too, the \u2014 just the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the\nimmensity of it. After those experiences, you\u2019re do \u2014 you do have dreams and\nnightmares. I had \u2014 it\u2019s diminished greatly over the years, but after first getting out\nof the service, an-and let me just finish perhaps by the German experience, we had\nthat then. Then we also had some more drastic experience. We were the second\ncompany, the second American company in the whole army to cross the Danube\nfarther south. A company from the 103\" division to the southwest, crossed in the\nmorning of the 26\", and we crossed the night of the 26\", so by \u2014 by an English\nApril 6, 1999\n[indecipherable]. And we lost a number of people there, and a lot of \u2014 quite a few\nwounded. Some wounded. But it\u2019s after then as I discovered, getting back over\nthere, I would have occasional dreams that would be quite frightening. I\u2019d wake.\nThey\u2019ve diminished. And yet even now I do have a recurrent dream which is that \u2014\neither \u2014 I\u2019m either going to be going into the army again, or I\u2019m in the army again.\nAnd I find that I have a feeling of concern, of fear, if you please. And terribly glad\nto wake up to realize that it is not happening again. That 1 \u2014 that has come\nsometimes. The most drastic thing recently was to have seen the movie \u201cSaving\nPrivate Ryan.\u201d Now, I\u2019ve talked to my company \u2014 Captain Greenburg(ph), he\u2019s\nseen it too. Every \u2014 every combat veteran I\u2019ve talked to has had a similar\nexperience, some more, some less, but I remember, to see it, the first oh, five\nminutes is in the cemetery, but then \u2014 then you begin \u2014 then one begins seeing the\nbeginning of D-Day with the small craft, the landing craft coming in. Now, we\nwere not D-Day of course, but we did have the training in amphibious. And it was\na remarkable thing because as I watched that in the darkened theater \u2014 my sa \u2014 Pat\nwa \u2014 wife Pat did not go. As I watched that and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and the camera, for\nthose who will see it recall that you saw the boats from the side and then that\nmoved over and panned right into the boat itself, and you\u2019re looking at the men.\nHanks, the captain and the ca \u2014 played the part of the captain. I was there again. It\nApril 6, 1999\nwas like it was our platoon going in. The \u2014 the roar of the motors, the spray of the\nspray coming over the top. Guys being \u2014 throwing up around you. The gear all just\nthe same, basically. And I began to cry, just this weeps and then when, in the\npicture, the craft hit the shore, the ramp went down, typical training, and then the\nGerman artillery, the mortars opened up, machine gunning the whole \u2014 I found\nmyself audibly crying, I couldn\u2019t help it. And I\u2014 ve \u2014I\u2014I-\u2014I have a free\nsample, Captain Greenburg(ph) who you [indecipherable] have met said he had\nthe same experience. That he \u2014 he had that happen. He \u2014 he w \u2014 he was weeping.\nAnd to drop back to our experience, the lieutenant who had taken the platoon\nacross the Rhine that I spoke of earlier, who had both the command responsibility\nof that group, a terrible burden to take back. After our first reunion of our\ncompany, he attended, it was back in \u2014 okay, it was Council Bluffs, my home. We\nhad them there in 90 \u2014 \u201995 and 97. In \u201995 for the first time, cap \u2014 Lieutenant\nHenry came. Now a doctor in Dallas, a \u2014 a very, very fine, but rather sensitive.\nAnd we visit a lot and he talked about that experience, the patrol across the Rhine.\nI had for Lieutenant Henry, after he got back home, a very gracious letter\nthanking us for \u2014 my wife and I. But he went on to say, the value it was to him to\nvisit with comrades-in-arms of years ago, to just hear about, that \u2014 that it \u2014 he\nunderstood things better and that it relieved from his should \u2014 from his shoulders\nApril 6, 1999\nthe burden of guilt that he\u2019d felt all these years. One good thing about reunions,\nthey helped. I talked to him, we were at ak \u2014 our division reunion in newy \u2014\nLouisville last September and he\u2019d seen the movie and he said it \u2014 I shouldn\u2019t\nhave, he said, it put me back again. So I think seeing the par \u2014 again, after all these\nyears, it comes back. And you wonder \u2014 what little I read of psychology on it, they\n\u2014 we\u2019re told in psychology that \u2014 that these memories are latent, that certain things\ncan trigger them off. Example, the \u2014 the \u2014 the smell, the odor. I can stand on a\nstreet corner today, pass those \u2014 a diesel bus and the diesel fumes take me right\nback to our training days when the \u2014 the diesel of the outfit. And yet on the other\nhand, come back to it, I don\u2019t remember anything about the terrible stench at\nAttendorn. Strange. And I don\u2019t know. My one thought, it might be that \u2014 who\ncan tell about these things? It may have been a reaction to what \u2014 that night, later\non when we were close to death, or the others were close to death and sa \u2014 I \u2014I\ndon\u2019t know. I-I \u2014 I-I do not have the wisdom to answer that.",
        "A: I\u2014I- yeah, I\u2014I\u2014I-I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Very interesting question because we learned about it, 1t was the day after the\n12\" of course, after the night the bad \u2014 we were \u2014 we were in \u2014 we were in \u2014 in\nApril 6, 1999\nreserve at that time in Attendorn. And I remember that they \u2014 they kind of got us\nall together basically and we had the \u2014 had this word that \u2014 that he died, and I\nremember it was, who the hell is Harry Truman? I didn\u2019t ta \u2014 he\u2019s our new\npresident is who he is. We know \u2014 we didn\u2019t know much about him basically, but\nit was \u2014 it was \u2014 you know, it \u2014 it was \u2014 it was different. Of course you \u2014 I\u2019ve seen\n\u2014 we\u2019ve all seen the pictures of, in this country when all the \u2014 all the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014\nthe \u2014 the weeping, I mean, and then \u2014 and the \u2014 and the sorrow and so forth. I\ndon\u2019t think, frankly, it made a lot of differ \u2014 I mean, he \u2014 so be it, I mean, it\nhappened \u2014",
        "A: No, I\u2014 no, no, no. Things were gonna go on, you know.",
        "A: We had passed that in Duren and then as I said, we were transferred then, the\npocket was finished, closed. We went by motor march at night. We were\ntransferred from the first army to the third. And the first night going down in the\nblack of the night, one of the trucks went off the road, not ours. We had several\nmen killed quite a few injured on the [indecipherable] down and then we went to\n\u2014 in the area called Franconia. Went through Wurzburg in Franconia. We\u2019re\nthere and then we \u2014 then we jumped off in the attack again. By this time we were\nApril 6, 1999\nin Patton\u2019s third army, transferred. Went down through the area, cities of\nEichstatt, to Ingolstadt. Ingolstadt was more trouble, was difficult. The back \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Quite a bit.",
        "A: DPs as well, too. As we moved farther down and got into Bavaria, we saw\nquite a few more civilians. And saw quite a few displaced persons, as you\nmentioned. On the roads, moving, traveling, wherever they might be going. At the\ncity, the town of Eichstatt, different because our company commander Captain\nMitchell was ill, and then Lieutenant not Captain Greenburg(ph), then age 22\ntook over the company, and he had the responsibility of 200 men there were\n[indecipherable]. And we had \u2014 we had it \u2014 a\u2014 a bad time at Ingolstadt \u2014 I take it\nback, at Eichstatt. Got \u2014 got quite a bit of \u2014 of resistance there. Then on down\ntowards the major city of Ingolstadt, which we were told was the hometown of\nHeinrich Himmler, expect defense. Well, it \u2014 I\u2019m not sure if it was with\nHimmler or not, but there was a \u2014 going into Ingolstadt was not the bad, but\nthat\u2019s the night we crossed the Danube. There was resistance there and that was a\nApril 6, 1999\n\u2014a pretty drastic night, to get in and get across basically, cross the river. As I said,\nwe were th \u2014 we were the \u2014 we were the second company of the Americans to go\ncro \u2014 I mean, a \u2014 the whole American army to cross, apparently. We got a\ncounterattack that night, got some \u2014 oh, we had a number who were killed, two or\nthree killed, I think, and quite a few wounded. And that\u2019s one of the nights one\nrealizes how thin is the veneer of civilization, by which I mean this. I remember\nthat I was the \u2014 I was the platoon runner by that time, sort of ran messages\nbetween the company command posts, CP and our \u2014 where we were, some \u2014 oh,\nsome blocks away. In the black of the night the Germans had come in, and the ka\n\u2014 and then several were wounded. And I remember going past and this \u2014 this\nGerman was crying, he says, I am bless\u00e9, well, French for woun \u2014 well, be \u2014 any \u2014\nand I remember I \u2014 I said \u2014 I just \u2014 I said, [speaks German] shut up. I mean, I \u2014\nno compassion at all on my part, huh? Yeah, I mean, you know, just \u2014 that was it.\nAnd you realize that yeah, I suppose that\u2019s our training and to \u2014 basically we \u2014 we\ncouldn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t take a chance, that kind of a thing. Maybe he was \u2014 maybe he\nwas just a \u2014 faking it, who knows? I couldn\u2019t take a chance. That was Ingolstadt\nand then we were there brief, and then after that really, the war was really finish\nup because by that time we were just on the move in \u2014 in \u2014 or sometimes \u2014\nsometimes we were riding tanks and going out ahead, other times mostly in trucks.\nApril 6, 1999\nThen, within a matter of a week we were down in Austria, we crossed into\nAustria. We \u2014 we stopped, oh we were pro \u2014 at a small town called Perwang,\nwhich 1s about 20 \u2014 p-e \u2014 p-e-r-w-a-n-g, about 20 kilometers north of Salzburg,\nwe were in Austria. And there \u2014 we were there when the word that the \u2014 it was\nMay seventh or May eighth, take your choice, the war was over. And immediately\nrumors began coming, okay you guys, you\u2019re already \u2014 there \u2014 you\u2019re going to the\nPacific. My God. Well, the thought was bad, but in the meantime we realized we\nwere gonna have some time at home. So indeed that\u2019s what happened. We came\nback by truck back to Mannheim. We were there in Mannheim for a time,\nprobably just a few days only in Feudenheim then truck again back across France\nto the same tents we were 1n when we first came, in Old Gold. And then \u2014 then we\ngot new uniforms, got the combat jackets. Pretty spiffy stuff, we thought. And\nnow getting ready for home. Trucks down to LaHavre. I was mentioning to\nCaptain Greenburg(ph) when we talked today, as we were leaving LaHavre now,\nsome romantic soul put on the loudspeaker system Debussy\u2019s Clair de Lune.\nThat was a nice departure. A week back to cross the Atlantic and then came this\ntumultuous arrival at home, because we were the first division back from Europe\nand we had the grand welcome. Blimps in the sky, fireboats in the \u2014 in New York\nharbor. Great big, huge banner across a hill, well done, welcome home. And off \u2014\nApril 6, 1999\noff the ships. Our ship had on a great big panel, ETO to Tokyo. Well. But we got\nin and my captain, Captain Reed(ph), we were still [indecipherable] tell me that\nhe \u2014 his home was Hoboken. His parents had learned of our return and his father\nwas able to get around over to the Manhattan\u2019s ri \u2014 we \u2014 I think he s \u2014 I the\ncaptain said pier 77 or something. 57. Got off and his father was right out there.\nFather shoved and pushed, he \u2014 right past and he bay \u2014 they kissed. Marvelous,\nhuh. And even the rest of us, it \u2014 1t was tremendous to come back, our own\ncountry again. Amazingly \u2014 I have it here, but amazingly there were \u2014 we had\ndignitaries and well wishers, but a lot of media. Reporter \u2014 a reporter from the\n\u201cDes Moines Register\u201d was there and we had a great big feature, which I still\nsaved at home basically, the \u2014 the Blackhawks back again and they had the \u2014 the\nname of every Iowan who was coming back and \u2014 and so there were many, many\nhappy families. We knew from the Register at home they knew we\u2019d been in\ncombat, that\u2019s the first word, because that had a little feature, what they\u2019ve done.\nAnd they had in the Register, toward the end of April that the 86\" was in combat.\nCourse, folks were just terribly tied up, terribly tied up. An amazing thing\nhappened, a tragic thing. When I \u2014 we got back to Mannheim, got our mail for the\nfirst ttme. My mother had written that she met a good high school friend of hers of\nCouncil Bluffs, now in Omaha, they got talking and her son was in the 86\",\nApril 6, 1999\n[indecipherable] together, his name was \u2014 was Captain Bruce McAllister, of our\nK company [indecipherable] in our regiment. And I remember as clearly sitting\nas we\u2019re sitting here. I remember saying to one of our \u2014 I said, my gosh, Wes, I \u2014\nI\u2019ve got to look up this Captain McAllister. He says, Pete, you\u2019re too late. He was\nkilled two weeks ago, down on the \u2014 on the [indecipherable] down the Danube.\nSo those things happen. That was \u2014 now \u2014",
        "A: Leaving LaHavre, yeah.",
        "A: Oh, way in, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, LaHavre \u2014",
        "A: Oh, LaHavre was badly smashed, badly smashed.\nApril 6, 1999",
        "A: You mean ye \u2014 on the way back, you mean \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 from \u2014 yeah. Mannheim \u2014 well, let me back up. War finished we were it \u2014\nwe were north of Salzburg. Back then by the autobahn, from Salzburg up to\nMunich \u2014 Munich was badly smashed. I remember driving and we\u2019d go over in\nthe trucks and \u2014 and we \u2014 in \u2014 in Munich, just \u2014",
        "A: Oh, I see, yeah. We were \u2014 a lot of people \u2014 you feel particularly sorry for the\nold people and children, who are the \u2014 the innocent, I \u2014 truth is, much as it can be,\nbut the children [indecipherable]. And yet interestingly as we\u2019d drive \u2014 I\nremember driving along in the trucks, there would be children watching us and\nthey would be giving the Nazi salute. They were taught \u2014 we were sold \u2014 they\ndidn\u2019t know, we were soldiers, and that was enough. But to the civilians we would\ntalk. Now when we came back to Feudenheim, a suburb of Mannheim, where we\nwere billeted, the Germans were there and they \u2014 they \u2014 they were all right. I\nmean, they were very sub \u2014 subservient. Get along basically, and of course, what\nlittle was that there were \u2014 you never \u2014 you never met any who were ever Nazis.\nApril 6, 1999\nDown the street, I heard [indecipherable] but we were not \u2014 w-we were not\npolitical, huh? Typical, typical. Whatever \u2014 how did Hitler ev \u2014 ever come to\npower, you\u2019re thinking. None of them, none of them. But it was there, you know, I\ns \u2014 you know.",
        "A: O-Other \u2014 other people \u2014 let me back up, if I may. Another experience that I\nremember that was such a remarkable thing. I remember we were on trucks after\nwe'd gone through Ackstatt \u2014 Eichstatt, heading toward, and suddenly realized\nthat \u2014 that the trucks were being surrounded practically by this wild horde of\npersons in green uniforms. They\u2019re Russian \u2014 Russian. They were Russian,\nreleased Russian \u2014 Russian appar \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, Russian prisoners of war. And my\nfirst rec \u2014 these are like Chinese. Mongolians, the whole thing. My \u2014 my first\nrealization, I mean, you read of \u2014 of what Russia was, I mean, all this \u2014 this\nvariegated population, in appearance, I mean, the-these were Orientals, basically,\nhuh. Then they moved on back basically, we go to the \u2014 we would see again \u2014 a-\nagain also \u2014 we came across a number in Bavaria of allied prisoners, British, who\nwere out of ba \u2014 sent to work on farms, huh. Course you know, th-they \u2014 they\nwere \u2014 they were lucky to be in the country so they had food, you know. Others\nApril 6, 1999\ndidn\u2019t. I don\u2019t remember though \u2014 there were quite a few displaced persons\nmoving back. It\u2019s hard to get a count, basically.",
        "A: No. The on \u2014 th-they were just civilian clothing, basically, that we saw. Now,\nto back \u2014 go back to the death camp side, though. After we \u2014 our division, 86\",\nwas in \u2014 we were down in Austria, our engineer battalion, I understand, was sent\nover to Dachau. And I had a friend in it, and he \u2014 he \u2014 he said he \u2014 again, he\u2019d\nnever such terror in his \u2014 that\u2019s where you had that \u2014 of course, the slave was bad\nenough, but of course there were others where you\u2019ve seen the pictures of, they are\njust incredible, incredible.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think that we got the names until later. None of them, to my\nrecollection, none of them. That seemed to come later. But then of course, by \u2014 we\nlearned more of it during the fall. By that time we had been back home, furlough,\ntrained again briefly at Gruber(ph) then came to Baums(ph) and we were sent out\nto the Philippines. We were in the Philippines now when the war trials, the\nJapanese were going on. General Hawla(ph) for example, was being tried there.\nWe saw a lot of the \u2014 of the \u2014 the tales of atrocities committed by \u2014 and they were\n\u2014 by the Japanese, as they were leaving the Philippines and that was really \u2014 that\nApril 6, 1999\nwas bad. And \u2014 and of course the same time, I\u2019m not exactly sure, I think the\nNuremberg trials were in October November, maybe, of \u201945, right? And so we\nbegan seeing more of \u2014 1n just general, news about the information coming out.\nTh-That \u2014 so much was new that I \u2014 incredible. But I don\u2019t recall prior to that time\nany of the names, basically.",
        "A: We got to the Philippines, we \u2014 we \u2014 to draw back. We were at Camp\nGruber(ph) for a couple weeks, and then the bombs, what was it, like August 6\",\nAugust whatever it was. And naga \u2014 fi-first of course Hiroshima, then Nagasaki.\nWe were on \u2014 we were on the train shortly after that by order. We got to San\nFrancisco. We sailed to San Francisco about the last week \u2014 next to last week in\nAugust. Got to the Philippines about three weeks later and we were there from\nlate in September. And the program was this, that as you were in longer, there was\na point system, so many points for so many months. Combat infantry badge gave\nyou 10 extra points, a Purple Heart gave you fi \u2014 by the point system then, you\nsee, our particular group was ready to come back, and we did, we left in March\nfrom Manila to come back, March o-of \u201946. We were home a month later.\nApril 6, 1999",
        "A: First of all bought a suit of clothes. No, beyond that it was fla \u2014 great to be back\nhome again, of course. Planned to go, and I did then begin school. My\nsummertime was open. Began school at the University of Iowa in \u2014 in September\nof \u201946, right away. And I finished my schooling there.",
        "A: I had to go \u2014 yes \u2014 es \u2014 I\u2014 I had \u2014 well, I had a little bit of a credit from \u2014 from\nKansas, in Drake, not much. But result was that I \u2014 I took what is called a\ncombined schedule of liberal arts and law. Your first \u2014 your first three years are all\nliberal arts.

Shards of memory like I\u2019ve talked about\nhere. Sometimes incomplete. We see \u2014 we see this broken mirror, each of us in a\ndifferent way, because in our combat experience, some of what \u2014 had the things \u2014\nsome, for example, what Sergeant Mac in great detail, hm, things that \u2014 that for\nsome reason or another, now whether \u2014 whether they\u2019re still latently \u2014 latent up\nhere, that need to be triggered, I don\u2019t know.

You can \u2014\nyou can see or visualize a hillside, or a certain setting where you were and what\nwas happening at the time. You can still recall the thunk of a mortar in the\ndistance or the rattle of machine gun fire. And they bring back \u2014 they \u2014 they can\nbring back these things, 1n some bizarre, strange way, but can never be fully \u2014\nnever fully reconstructed, just as \u2014 as a broken mirror can not be. And what you\u2019re\nseeing in the broken mirror also many times is \u2014 and results of being distorted in\nsome ways, you know, th-th-the \u2014 the different angles you\u2019re seeing of it. And \u2014\nand \u2014 and that\u2019s why you get with different veterans different views of things. The\nApril 6, 1999\n\u2014 the famous story of \u2014 of the \u2014 of the four blind men blindfolded with the\nelephant. One, the one leg and the trunk and so forth. And you \u2014 then that\u2019s very\nmuch the way it is. And \u2014 and in \u2014 in a combat situation, the first thing you realize\nis there\u2019s begin \u2014 it-it\u2019s confusion. I have here our division history. And as I read it\nthrough there are many areas \u2014 history is hard \u2014 is hard to recover accurately and I\nfind many things that I \u2014 I ca \u2014 I describe as being garbled in this. It depends who\none talks to, it depends how it\u2019s reconstructed, and it \u2014 wh-while there\u2019s a lot of\ngood work, at the same time there are things that do come off wrong. But so be it,\nI mean, tha-that\u2019s a part of the problem of reconstructing history.",
        "A: I think \u2014 I think better to be young because we were young, impressionable, but\nwe learned.

And \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and war is not a thing for anybody, but less\nI think older persons than younger. I think you maybe adjusted better. There was\nso many descriptions of it.

Another one too that \u2014 that to \u2014 to be\nApril 6, 1999\nin combat is looking like \u2014 you are looking like in a window into hell.

        "A: I\u2014I will say this, I mean, we were \u2014 we \u2014 we had religious training in the\nbackground basically, but you have the imponderable question, in our experiences.\nYou\u2019ve got people killed right beside you, the \u2014 the \u2014 the question, why them and\nnot me? It\u2019s an unanswerable question and \u2014 an-and still after all these years, I\npuzzle. An-And th-there is no solution to that, no answer. I-I think maybe the\nreligious faith, you know, faith in God, of course, in the hereafter if we\u2019re going to\naccept that, is important. S \u2014 but apropos of the matter of \u2014 of how to reason it out,\nit ca \u2014 it cannot be reasoned out. You see too many things where there is no reason\nof why things happen or shouldn\u2019t happen in combat. You see brutality where it\nshouldn\u2019t be. You see incredible cruelty. You see some of the best guys are \u2014 are\ntaken, killed, and other dunderheads, pardon the expression, seem to skin through.\nTh-There \u2014 there i \u2014 there is no logic to it. And yet, and yet there is an incredible\nApril 6, 1999\nattraction to it. Strange, isn\u2019t it? We \u2014 we\u2019ve seen the movie \u201cPatton\u201d\n[indecipherable] well, we don\u2019t love him, but \u2014 but it\u2019s undeniable and many,\nmany, many people feel this, that there 1s an incredible thrill in that situation, if\nyou come through. If you come through. We can look back and see things, there 1s\n\u2014 there can be \u2014 there can be, strangely, a great exhilaration in \u2014 in \u2014 in a firefight,\nit\u2019s strange. People inflicting death on others, and here again, the veneer of\ncivilization, the old tradition that when you get your blood up and so forth, it\u2019s the\nstrangest thing. You \u2014 you want to deny it to yourself, and yet contradictorily it\u2019s\nstill there. Strange. Not often, but \u2014 but more often it \u2014 more often 1s a \u2014 come \u2014\ncomes the feeling of \u2014 of the futility of 1t and the \u2014 and th \u2014 and the \u2014 I remem-\nmember coming home in my furlough and \u2014 and during that time, I remember we\nlost some of these guys, tha-that \u2014 that brought me to tears. I think\n[indecipherable] good guys, wonderful guys. Why, why, why, huh? Huh? My\ngood friend Sergeant Smith, Smitty was our re \u2014 machine gun section. They were\njust laying down field of fire as we were heading down into Attendorn. An 88\nround came in right through the center of the house they were in, took them all out\nand they were all badly injured. Smitty partic \u2014 badly bu \u2014 very badly injured.\nAnd of course he later on learned of our \u2014 my experience at night.

It\u2019s kind of a contest who calls who first. I-I \u2014 I catch him before\nmass, his morning mass, but we talk about it a bit and I\u2014 and I recently said last\ntime, I said, Smitty, how you doing with the cancer? He says Pete, doing fine, but\nhe says every day, every day you \u2014 you \u2014 you and I have after Attendorn is a plus.\nThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s right.",

        "A: Well, in \u2014",
        "A: \u2014I\u2014I-it\u2019s \u2014it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s been very, very, very, very well asked, very, very well\ndone. I-I think basically that \u2014 that would cover it. I mean, le-let \u2014 to review ... I-I-\nI pause because \u2014 because I\u2019m trying to \u2014 to think base \u2014 basically of what else\ncould be contributed on the matter of the \u2014 of the individuals that \u2014 that were\nreleased that day. I wonder sometimes what their fate was, if they were ru \u2014 were\nRussian, probably a bad fate. What we read, at least about the prisoners of war, the\nRussians, they were not accepted back or they were, if they were taken back they\nwere \u2014 brutal thing. As far as the civilians, I \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2019ve \u2014 I sometimes wonder what\nApril 6, 1999\nhappened to those people, a-again, you know. Didn\u2019t think at the time, but after\nthe pass of years you wonder about it, basically. Interestingly also, I did some\nchecking out \u2014 I had occasion to read \u2014 check back in to the records of the\nNuremberg \u2014 Nuremberg. November, it began. One of the major cases was that\nof a Field Marshal Milch m-i-n-l \u2014 m-i-l-c-h, Milch, who was a subordinate of\nAlbert Speer, and that was the [indecipherable]. He was one was responsible for\nthe \u2014 the so-called forced labor, alright? And in the exhibits presented at\nNuremberg in his behalf were requirements by the Reich supposedly that these\npeople would be adequately fed and cared for. Not humanitarianly-wise, but to\ninsure the fact they could do the work they were going to do, huh. The other was \u2014\nsimply seemed secondary, basically. And of course in the case of these poor\npeople, in ha \u2014 admittedly now, probably the logistical system had broken down, I\nmean as far as food, but that does not still explain in a \u2014 in any way excuse the\nway they were being held. Read, as we have, Manchester\u2019s book, \u201cThe Arms of\nKrupp,\u201d and the \u2014 and the \u2014 and th-the treatment to which the Kruppianer\nsubjected all their force people, huh. It\u2019s an incredible thing, incredible living in it.\nAnd \u2014 and what we saw that afternoon, I mean, the way these that \u2014 the way these\npeople were. As Mac said, look what these fucking German \u2014 terrible.\nApril 6, 1999",
        "A: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: The Danish experience?",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s quite inters \u2014 it\u2019s quite interesting. Number one, there had been a\ngreat \u2014 a great tradition, history of tolerance in Denmark. Smaller countries\n[indecipherable] also. But early enlightenment, which began in Denmark in the\n1820\u2019s - 30\u2019s, they had \u2014 they had left the monarchy, I mean the \u2014 the actual\nabsolute monarchy and into more of a constitutional monarchy, th-that helped. A\nsmaller country, as I mentioned again, and beyond that, I\u2019m not sure, except that\nthere was \u2014 it was indeed a safe haven. Now, as to how the wonderful escape took\nplace in October, several things I \u2014 I read \u2014 as we read it. Number one, there had\nbeen the great feeling of the Danish people. The-The-These are not Danish Jews,\nApril 6, 1999\nit\u2019s Jewish Danes. A subtle distinction, but it\u2019s interesting. Secondly the war\nsituation was turning against Germany. Allies were in north Africa by that time.\nStalingrad had been completed. The general feeling was \u2014 was different. The\nproximity \u2014 the proximity of Sweden now, made it possible, which might, in a\nlandlocked country not have happened, huh. And the willingness of the Swedes to\naccept it. There\u2019s a wonderful story told apropos of that, about the Swedish side of\nit now. When the time came that was realized the Germans were going to move, to\ntake the Danish Jews, time was short. It was a matter of days, but they had to\nsomehow \u2014 they meaning the Danish people under their leadership and the\nresistance get them out. But they had to have the agreement of Sweden to take\nthem. They could not deal with Germany and say \u2014 because that would tip it off.\nSo what was determined, from what I read, was this, they realized that the Danish\nleadership, they had to get the agreement of the Swedish crown. The arrangement\nwas made that they, the Danish people would select, hopefully, that \u2014 a leader of\nthe Danish Jewish community to hopefully visit with the King of Sweden. It was\narranged. And the person selected was Niels Bohr, the great atomic\n[indecipherable]. The story goes on to say that in \u2014 1n Bohr\u2019s words he said \u2014 he\nsaid, I\u2019m a scientist, not an advocate, he said, why \u2014 well, they said you have th-\nthe standing, the name, the King will \u2014 all right. It was arranged remarkably\nApril 6, 1999\n[indecipherable]. Then, in just a matter of hours they set this up and apparently\nthen, either \u2014 either by boat \u2014 they\u2019re not \u2014 they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re still \u2014\nthey\u2019re c-careful, or possibly by a British aircraft, the Mosquito coming, take him\nover, Bohr was taken to Stockholm, to probably Drottningholm and the palace,\nthe story is told. He said, in I went, to this massive palace. Re-Realized what was\non my shoulders to try and get this done, to persuade the king. I was shown into\nthe room. Had a room and th-th-th-the king\u2019s attendant was there, basically very\nfine, he said Dr. Bohr, please wait. Then he said the moment came, he said\n[indecipherable] here \u2014 here \u2014 here I am just becoming more tense by the\nmoment. The door opened and they said, Dr. Bohr, the king will see you now. He\nsaid, I stepped in and here was this very pleasant looking gentleman, it was the\nking, King Gustav. Gustav Aroff(ph) I think it was. And he said, I-I have some\nSwedish. And he said, I explained in [indecipherable] as best I could the plight of\nour people, what was going to happen and \u2014 and that we desperately pled for help.\nHe said, the king, very courteous, stood up. He said, of course I stood up too. The\nking walked to the window, looked out. He said that \u2014 I can [indecipherable] it\nwas probably all of maybe 10 seconds, but he came back and said, Dr. Bohr, your\npeople will be welcome in Sweden. And that was it, laid the foundation. So, a\ncombination of things put together, you see, and of course the \u2014 it was not all \u2014 I\nApril 6, 1999\nmean there were \u2014 there were some problems to getting them \u2014 getting the Danes\nacross or getting the \u2014 the \u2014 the Jews across, the Jewish people. Some \u2014 some boat\npeople did charge, others did not, back and forth, but it still was a remarkable,\nremarkable thing, huh? Incredible.",
        "A: I-I-I-",
        "A: Beg your pardon?",
        "A: Keep the faith. No, oh I\u2014 I \u2014 no, th-the \u2014 the kids are doing fine. And I have\none of my \u2014 my good Jewish friend who 1-1-1s very \u2014 is very much involved in his\npersuasion, which 1s fine. But he often repeats the fact, he says, how fortunate we\nare a-a-as Jews to live in this country, this is \u2014 to be a part of this great country.\nThat\u2019s very true for all of us. Apologize, I didn\u2019t mean to get all \u2014 but \u2014 but it\u2019s \u2014\nit\u2019s a\u2014 you know, I come to Washington, this tremendous country and \u2014 and \u2014\nand I still \u2014 don\u2019t we all \u2014 get a look, you see our great flag, great flag. And\nspeaking to this \u2014 this\u2019II be the final thing, I \u2014 we \u2014 it\u2019s been \u2014 I \u2014 it\u2019s been a ri \u2014\nfine experience. I gave a talk, I think you have it here, when I die, don\u2019t play\n\u201cTaps,\u201d \u201cTaps\u201d makes me cry. I cry for \u2014 cause I \u2014 if I may go on, I cry for all the\nApril 6, 1999\nyoung men, my friends that I couldn\u2019t save and tried to. So don\u2019t play \u201cTaps\u201d but\nwhen the time comes, I see I\u2019Il join on gree \u2014 on a \u2014 on a grassy knoll, they\u2019Il be a\nbunch of G.I.s there in well pressed uniforms, they\u2019Il be a lieutenant with a piece\nof grass and they\u2019ll say to me, where you been? You got any cigarettes? We\u2019 ll fall\nin, and \u2014 in two lines, basically, put on our packs, grab up our MIs basically and\nmove off, and right, left, easy cadence. No ice, no mud, no snow. No 88s or\nmortars coming in, or 88s. And then we will move off, my \u2014 my buddies and I,\npast the moon, Jupiter on our left, the sun on our right, following our glorious\nflag to God\u2019s peaceful eternity. Isn\u2019t that good? Marvelous, huh? Well, I1\u2014I-\u2014I-I\nthink of nothing else, thank you.",
