        "Q: In what instances, do you know what instances there was a...?",
        "A: There was a lot of differences that they had and she spoke up, she wasn\u2019t afraid of him. You had\nto know Rum-cof-ski (ph), he admired somebody very feisty, somebody that gave him back and he\nadmired people like that.

        "A: Until they liquidated everybody out of the hospital.",
        "A: Excuse me, this is very important. He was a very important member of the family, Baa-roo-flas-\nker (ph). And it\u2019s not written either here and he\u2019s so physical here. He was a protege\u2019 of Rum-cof-\nski (ph). He survived and died in Israel a few years ago.",

        "A: I don\u2019t know, they had some connections, I can\u2019t remember now. I knew it but I don\u2019t know. As\nI said, people that he knew Rum-cof-ski(ph) and people that supported his orphanage before the\nwar, when they came to the ghetto he was very generous to these people.",
        "Q: What was the occasion here?",
        "A: I have no idea.",

        "A: [Still answering in foreign language]. Excuse me, I don\u2019t want you to get so tired of me because\nI told you this a few times, but Rum-cof-ski (ph) said he\u2019s going to send me to clean the streets.",
        "Q: So actually the order was that everybody who worked for the Counsel had to participate, had to\nstand there and do what?",

        "Q: Were you asked to be?",
        "A: No. I always finagled somehow to get out of it and She-nis-kee (ph) took care of it. I must say I\nhave sometimes people that took them out like a friend of Irene, you know?",
        "Q: How would you do it?",
        "A: I just took him out, I just let him go. I told the people to let him go. I told the people, listen I had\nsome weight, I carried some weight in the ghetto so if I go there and I said, release him, they had no\nchoice but to release him.",
        "Q: So you would go to where they were gathered and you would say...?",
        "A: I would tell, Eisman, not Eisman, who was in charge of this thing? It must be in the book there.\nI would call him and would say, let him out.",
        "Q: On the phone?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How different was the deportations in \u201842? In the beginning I understand all the Western Jews\nwere...?",
        "A: No, you have to understand. The first transport as I mentioned in my interview were the three\n\u201cF\u2019s\u201d, the Flesch-man (ph), the For-man (ph) and the Fisherman (ph). These three categories of\npeople were sent by order of Rum-cof-ski (ph) as the first transport to go to work. And most of\nthem survived because they were characters who are...",
        "Q: If you will allow me, I will show you the picture because I think I have a photograph of these\nyoung men being deported probably to work. The first transport, that was Winter time, right?",
        "A: No, it went on all the time. It was just specifically in Winter, you had in Winter transport, yet in\nSummer transport. I saw in Spring and Fall, however, there were a lot of volunteers, don\u2019t forget\nwho voluntarily registered themselves to be sent out to a working camp as has been told.",

        "A: They were all people.",
        "A: Not necessarily.",

        "A: Well, we had people from Austria, we had people from Czechoslovakia but also from the small,\nlittle villages and towns around Lodz. Pab-nein-leet-sa (ph) and...",
        "Q: But that was earlier?",
        "A: This was in the beginning, right in the beginning.",
        "A: Was until \u201842. We had people coming into Lodz.",
        "A: This I didn\u2019t know. You know, when we went there...",
        "A: No, they also came in \u201842.",
        "Q: Tell me about the Gay-sphel (ph)?",
        "A: The Gay-sphel (ph)? Well, it was a poster that we had posted all over the ghettos that from this\nand this date, from this and this time nobody\u2019s allowed to be on the street. And the reason for it was\nthat they wanted to have an easy job going to the houses and collect whom they wanted to collect.",
        "Q: This was a fairly unusual activity in that the Germans themselves came in, right?",
        "A: No, they always came in.",
        "A: They never asked our permission.",
        "A: You see, Na-ba-loskie (ph) is where you had the central office, okay? You had the ghetto far-va-\ndoonk (ph) which was Bebof (ph) and cohorts and you had our people, Rum-cof-ski (ph) and Aaron\nYakovobitch had his office there and from there everything was, that was the central point of all the\nactivities within the ghetto. And what the transports are concerned they went on until actually even\nin \u201843, we still got transports into the ghetto. They called people and brought them in the ghetto.\nThey brought some people, put them in the cemetery and shot them. And they hung people and\nthey shot them, but it was outside, not within. Within we had also shootings, like for instance, in the\nKrim-a-nall Po-da-sigh (ph), Gooby Oben-stein-er (ph) who was the big shot there was sitting,\nwhen he was drunk he was sitting at the window and there was like a sniper, shooting. Whether he\nkilled someone or not, he just started to shoot, that\u2019s all.",
        "Q: I understood, and if you know, in all the pictures of the, whether they are arrivals or deportations,\nthis is so difficult for me and I will ask you to show me the...",
        "A: Well, whatever I can help you with we are here.",
        "Q: The only ones that we recognize as Gay-sphel (ph) the Germans, we can see the German soldiers\nas opposed to others that you don\u2019t, that you see Jewish police, ghetto police?",
        "A: The ghetto police had to go with them in all actions. They were forced to. In other words, the\nSS would come in with trucks and the Jewish police had to work with them.",
        "Q: And I understand that.",
        "A: Because they had to interpret.",
        "Q: And I see these columns walking. Like 5,000 people walking to Mechelen and I don\u2019t see any\nGermans in the picture. Except for the Gay-schel (ph), would they actually come and grab people\nfrom the hospital and from the old peoples home and...?",
        "A: The Germans, when the transport went out, you wouldn\u2019t see them but you would see them at\nthe tracks. There they would be. They would do the loading into the cattle cars. So you would not\nsee any escorts at Rather-gorch (ph). You would not see them on the way to Rather-gorch (ph).\nThere you would see only our own police.",
        "Q: In the Chronicle it says at a point in \u201842 one of the people who, for instance he writes, a very\ncurious thing is happening, he writes. The trains leave with people for labor and their luggage is\ncoming back. And he doesn\u2019t go into, he doesn\u2019t draw any conclusions that it means these people\nwent to death, but he kind of writes, it 1s very strange that their clothes should come back and we\nshould have to clean them and sort them.",
        "A: Well, this leaves yourself to various interpretations. Because normally when you come into a\ncamp you had to get rid of everything, or your clothing and you get fresh clothing.",
        "A: You know what happened?",
        "Q: So that was the rationalization?",
        "A: All right.",
        "A: I will tell you what happened. My sister-in-law, my brother\u2019s widow, she built Auschwitz. She\nlived in Ka-to-beet-sa (ph), it\u2019s very close to Auschwitz, and they grabbed her, she was 14 years old.\nHer family was shot, everybody of her family was shot. She was left 14 years, a girl before the war\nin Europe was very sheltered. And she was taken to Auschwitz, they were building the barracks at\nthat time, she told us. And then, they put her to the Prin-ya (ph), laundry. Every piece of Jewish\nclothing was checked out and you wouldn\u2019t believe the stuff that they found in this, in buttons,\ndiamonds, there was a lot of dollars and paper money was found and some people, when they were\nin Auschwitz they collected it, they had connections and when they came out after the war they\nhad...",
        "Q: Do you mean Auschwitz or do you mean Bruckenau?",
        "A: I am talking about Auschwitz. I don\u2019t know the distinction between Bruckenau and Auschwitz, I\nknow this was the center of point when people heard this.",
        "A: We know that Bruckenau was where the crematoriums and where the gassing took place. Not in\nAuschwitz but in Bruckenau.",
        "A: [Inaudible] We were in Auschwitz. We were a few years ago, three years ago. We went, we\ntook a pilgrimage to Auschwitz.",
        "A: The working camp was Auschwitz and the final solution took place in Bruckenau.",
        "Q: When I look at you and I try to think in the standards of war time. You look good, I mean you\nare a beautiful woman today, but you looked good, you looked airy and you looked, you know, blue\neyes, and, did it occur to you to run away and hide?",
        "A: Yes. I got married 1n order to survive. Not to him, I was married for three months and later on I\ngota . He was my father\u2019s age, or maybe a little bit older, but my parents told me I was...",
        "Q: Polish man, or?",
        "A: He was a Jew. [inaudible]",
        "A: The police. We call them the OD man. ;",
        "A: And this is why I wanted to run away, but my parents, the factory was still going full swing and\nmy mother was telling me in the First World War they were having a paradise in Poland. They\nwere working for the Kaiser you know and they were making money and they didn\u2019t want to, my\nmother didn\u2019t want to leave. My father wanted to leave. And then, my mother said to me, your\ngoing away and we are left behind. This is when I changed my mind.",
        "Q: So you married this man in order to, how would it help you to run away if you were married?",
        "A: Because I would have somebody to take care of me. I was a spoiled young girl.",
        "Q: When the ghetto was already closed was there a possibility, were there some individuals that\ncould get away?",
        "A: A lot of them fled and went to Russia.",
        "Q: After the closing of the ghetto?",
        "A: They could get out, some of them.",
        "A: Before and after. If you realize, people smuggled them out but most of them, most of the, they\nfled in \u201839 when the war broke out.",
        "A: They survived in Russia.",
        "A: Then they fled, okay? And went East. And they wound up and they survived in Siberia.",
        "A: I bet you know that in Poland the family ties were very close so you couldn\u2019t do anything. You\nwould live all your life with a guilt complex. It\u2019s true! You couldn\u2019t just do whatever was good for\nyou.",
        "Q: It\u2019s a long story?",
        "A: Yes, everybody has long stories to tell.",
        "Q: When it became scary in the ghetto and you understood that people are taken away. Did you\nthink of leaving and, you know?",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t. I had a big package. I had my parents and my brother and my aunts and my uncles\nand the whole families. We didn\u2019t live for ourselves, we shared our lives.",
        "Q: Your parents, they had a factory here? Were they able to have some gold or some material or?",
        "A: Of course, we had a lot of jewelry. But we exchanged it for the last supper before they took us\naway. We gave away to a person that is alive, I don\u2019t know if you heard about She-mek-fel-don\n(ph). He was working the with the Germans and he had connections.",
        "Q: And he would give it to the Germans and get something?",
        "A: He exchanged it and he brought us the food and he was left to clean the ghetto also.",
        "Q: One of the 600?",
        "A: No, it was close to thousands in the ghetto to clean. Officially I think it was 800 but there were a\nlot of people hidden. And he sort of with the whole family, a few brothers and his sister and\nparents. And after the war they went to Israel. He\u2019s now in Sal-o Pal-o (ph).",

        "A: Yes, because my brother-in-law, we gave it to him and he probably gave it to his, one thing I\nknow that they hid things, so this 1s how this survived I guess. We gave it to Dora\u2019s husband and he\ngave it to his brother. But the bridge as you see is taken so we suspect that they have it.",

        "A: I think I still would be able to read it, to make it out. I have to take it and I have to record it.",
        "A: If you would have a forensic department I think they would be able to do something about it, but\nit\u2019s fading. It\u2019s so faded.",
        "Q: I was just wondering if we should get it copied so that at least there is a permanent record of it?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think I would make it public because it\u2019s all personal. My life, my feelings, you know,\nand happenings if there were something.",
        "Q: Do you think at some point you might want to make it available, even 100 years from now?",

        "A: I would tape record it.",
        "A: have been coaxing him for years to do it.",
        "Q: Well somebody should just come to the house with a tape recorded, who doesn\u2019t know German\nso they don\u2019t understand what your doing, and you just read it out in German and at least there is a\nrecord because it\u2019s important to have something like that.",
        "A: I will try to do that.",
        "A: He can do it by himself, he doesn\u2019t need anybody to do it...",
        "Q: Well, but sometimes you need someone to just come and say, okay, now we are going to do...",
        "A: I have two tape recorders, but both are in need of repair.",
        "Q: I could have Jodie, Jodie doesn\u2019t understand any German so whatever your saying is safe.",

        "Q: And were you looking for particular things, were you looking to see...",
        "A: No, just what the conditions were. What I could do to improve it or when I criticize. I had quite\na task. I pulled quite some weight in that sense because even if he was a director of the factory he\nstill had to, if I said something, it was that word. It had to be done. And on the other end I also\npatted him on the shoulder if he did something well so 1t went both ways. Yes, I did go around. But\nI always had one with me, one of my OD men.",
        "Q: When you would go to the places would people run up to you and talk to you or would they stay\nworking?",
        "A: They would come. Ask me for favors or something.",
        "A: He was very accessible, Bert.",
        "Q: And the other workers, you had 40 or 50 other people working for you, were they mainly in the\noffice or did they also walk around so they could report to you?",
        "A: No, they were mainly in the office because to keep up the data, we didn\u2019t have computers\nnaturally so everything had to be done by hand so we kept pretty busy.",
        "Q: Did you have to make labor charts about who was working where?",
        "A: No, but we had to register definitely all the personnel to which we are, and somebody got a\ndelegation to that factory it was put onto the index cards.",
        "Q: So you could trail where the people, they had gone from this factory to that factory so you knew\nexactly?",
        "A: Yes, absolutely.",
        "Q: Are those cards still available?",
        "A: Well that depends on...",

        "A: To the Vi-vel (ph).",
        "A: And he told us that he saved, he was left with the crew to clean up and then the Russians came\nand liberated them. This is how he kept everything intact. All his papers, everything what was\nRum-cof-ski (ph) he has, he had. I don\u2019t know what, but I know he donated it a lot.",
        "Q: Now I know in Lodz, what?",
        "Q: In some cases, here but I\u2019m not sure if it was...",
        "A: Not On-zone-o-vitch (ph). I know he told us that he donated an awful lot here.",
        "Q: There are cards in Lodz now, that I know, with the names of a lot of people. Where they were\nliving. Which is something else I wanted to ask you. I wanted to show you the map. We have a list\nof the ghetto inhabitants and your listed here. As living in Belzar (ph).",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Now, where was that?",
        "A: Belzar-nacht (ph). Let\u2019s see that.",
        "A: It was next to Rib-now (ph), Bert.",
        "A: One moment.",
        "A: You have to go by Lud-no-mier-skein (ph), it\u2019s a side street.",
        "A: Yes, right here. Bazarro (ph), Bazar Plats, it\u2019s right here.",
        "Q: And what\u2019s this other street, Huntz, what does that mean?",
        "A: Hundrea-auten (ph)? I have no idea.",
        "Q: So you were Bezar (ph) Seven?",
        "A: Yeah. I don\u2019t know what this Handrea-auten (ph) means here.",
        "Q: Unless it means we\u2019re in or near that street? I didn\u2019t see it anywhere.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t even know Hundrea-auten (ph) street.",
        "Q: Maybe it\u2019s one of the closest main streets?",
        "A: Like Aud-nitz-ka (ph), Hundrea-auten (ph) 1s like...",
        "Q: Yes, so it\u2019s over there. I don\u2019t know why, it\u2019s very strange.",
        "A: Here was the bridge, you see?",
        "Q: That\u2019s where the bridge...",
        "A: That\u2019s the bridge we are talking about. There were two bridges and gates. There were some\ngates here. They are not marked, the gates are not marked. Only the bridges are marked here.\nThere was a hospital.",
        "Q: There was an Aryan street?",
        "A: So, what they meant here Huandy-aut-en-schtaz (ph), what they meant covered the Huandy-aut-\nen-schtaz (ph) so that they had to go from there to here, you know? Should have said humble-aut-\nen-schtaz (ph) rather than Huandy-aut-en-schtaz (ph).",
        "Q: Right, because that\u2019s much closer?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And this is the train tracks, the trolley tracks?",
        "A: The trolley. The trolley went there.\n<<<<Inquiring about lunch, what to eat>>>>",
        "A: So you are not disappointed? Getting enough information?",
        "Q: Yes. (inaudible), but I\u2019m getting more. How did you feel about it?",
        "A: [had a very restless night. I don\u2019t know, I tried to knock it out.",
        "A: And you were talking I want you to know, but I couldn\u2019t understand about what.",
        "A: I was mumbling?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you have dreams last night?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t dream last night too.",
        "A: Yeah, at one time you were saying something too and I touched you and you stopped.",
        "Q: Did you have particular things that were bothering you last night?",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall. I know I was very restless and I looked at the clock almost every hour.",
        "A: I know we wanted to walk and get something to eat. We walked, we couldn\u2019t find it, so we went\nback to the hotel and we ate downstairs. They should close the place, but they served people, it\u2019s\nunbelievable. And the prices! A cup of soup, watery soup, five dollars!",
        "Q: I think we have to change the hotel.",
        "A: Yes, you should.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to tell Chris.",
        "A: Oh, it\u2019s a depressing place, very depressing.",
        "Q: Where are you staying?",
        "A: In the Holiday Inn on Franklin Square.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t like the area. So, you couldn\u2019t find the restaurant I told you about?",
        "A: No we didn\u2019t.",
        "A: I went to \u201cK\u201d\u2019 and...",
        "Q: \u201cK\u201d and 17th, I think.",
        "A: Oh, we went to 16th and then we went back. So, what are you going to do with this?",
        "A: It\u2019s a beautiful piece, isn\u2019t it?",
        "Q: Yes, it\u2019s interesting. I think this is something that\u2019s easy for us to just put into the permanent\nexhibition because we have that case with all the currency. I mean, I would ask Yatz-ka (ph) if we\ncould contribute that because it\u2019s so small. And it\u2019s in great condition.",
        "A: It\u2019s in good condition, isn\u2019t it?",
        "Q: But this 1s such a , | would hope we would have an opportunity to exhibit it, but\nalso to be very clear in the text what it was. Especially because it\u2019s really very significant because\nof the odyssey or, it made it really something that is connected with the Jewish people. It\u2019s been\nvery lovely meeting you. I hope the rest of your stay here 1s .",
        "A: We leaving tomorrow morning. Nice meeting you.",
        "Q: I am trying to think 1f we should move into my office and they can have some lunch because if\nthey are going to come in here. Are there other things that we want to do, do a few more things\nwith photographs now?",
        "A: There were some photographs...",
        "Q: We could do it after lunch.",
        "A: We can continue, but I think it\u2019s pretty awkward if she looks at one and I look at one and...",
        "Q: Your right. We probably should do one at a time.",
        "A: Maybe, the ten more minutes that we have. If you could sit here.",
        "A: Shall I take it over there, or should I just, oh, finish this one? Do you want us to finish this one?\nBecause there are not too many left as I can see.",
        "Q: I very much want to show you the deportation photos, for you to tell me what is what, what is\ncoming and what is going.",
        "A: Women! and . All right. This is Rum-cof-ski-key\u2019s (ph)wife,\nRegina. No, I don\u2019t know her name.",

        "Q: And this is?",
        "A: This is Mrs. Dabby-dovich (ph), Dr. Klausenburg\u2019s daughter. And this is Aaron Yakovobitch\n(ph), that had my, that we gave for...",
        "Q: Brother of Bolack (ph)?",

        "Q: I think he is a bit younger and he wrote an article that he heard that there was a sports figure, or\nlike maybe like underworld, a little criminal...",
        "A: This is who clubbed Rum-cof-ski (ph), the criminal. When the Germans came to Lodz, they\nopened the jails and the criminals were the bosses of us. They were like the Mafia and with the first\ntransport, he tried to send these people away...",
        "A: He collected the first transport to leave the ghetto. There were the three \u201cF\u2019s\u201d: Fleischer (ph),\nForeman (ph) and Fisherman (ph). These were the lowest elements and they were the ones who\nwere in Auschwitz waiting for him. And they clubbed him to death.",

        "Q: But, did Giertler (ph) see these people killing him?",
        "A: Yeah. He saw everything. He took all their Auschwitz when he came, he had a lot of, they\ncalled him \u201cBee-alg-da-varta\u201d (ph), \u201cThe White Brigade\u201d. Because they were the people that\nwere...",
        "A: This was Rum-cof-ski\u2019s (ph) wife.",
        "A: No way, Bertie. This was Mrs. Dabby-dovich (ph). Rum-cof-ski\u2019s (ph) wife doesn\u2019t figure\nanywhere else.",

        "A: Yeah, she was obnoxious anyhow.",
        "A: I said first of all the people in Warsaw ghettos they had with the outside. So they were\nable to exchange something for weapons and ammunition. We had absolutely no contact with the\noutside world. We were absolutely isolated and what could we do? To fight the Germans with bare\nfingers? It would have been suicide!",

        "Q: Wasn\u2019t it nght away announced?",

        "A: At that time we did not know that already are other people like Alan Yakovobitch (ph) knew that\nwe would not be staying in Sachsenhausen. That we will be going somewhere else to work, in other\nwords, it\u2019s like slaves, like going into slave labor, okay? But we didn\u2019t know that, only when we\ncame to Sachsenhausen we were told we are not staying here. After two weeks we went to Kern-es-\nwoo-sen-hausen (ph) because the barracks were not ready. But in the meantime when we came in\nthey were just about ready to be occupied. And then we got the straw mattresses and stuff like this.",

One day, later on, I realized why he had sent me out. Because when I\ncame back late that afternoon seventy people had left.",

        "A: Sure. It was like a ken-car-ta (ph) and this ken-car-ta (ph) they were getting their rations every\nweek.",
        "A: The ID they get later on from the archives, from Shun-dul-dom (ph), no, from Nef-tall-en (ph)\nwho was in charge of it too, for ID cards. So he made out the ID cards afterwards but the people\nhad to be delegated to the various factories.",
        "Q: And how did you make the decision about the, were the factories already set up?",
        "A: No, they were in the process of setting up. And we had to select the people to go there.",
        "Q: And did you know how many people could go into each factory or you made an approximate?",
        "A: Well, they gave me a demand. I can take now twenty, I can take now fifty, I can take now a\nhundred, I can take now five. So, whatever the demand was.",
        "A: He\u2019s head of the workers or the factory...",
        "A: They had to come to me and tell me of what they wanted.",
        "A: A paper assault, we can have a hundred people working there.",
        "Q: But, three days and three nights that you were registering people, are you at the same time as you\nregistering them designating them for a particular factory?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So how long from the time that Rum-cof-ski (ph) hired you for this until you began to actually\nregister people? A week? Two weeks? I mean, it had to take you some time to figure it out?",
        "A: It took me about 10 days, if I remember right.",
        "Q: To organize, to figure out how to organize?",
        "A: Yeah, to organize my office.",
        "Q: And your talking about 1940?",
        "A: 1940, yes.",
        "Q: And then, when people started there were demands for deportations and some of the people were\nyour workers from factories, right?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And then people came and said, I hear there is a free space in the comb factory, or paper assault\nor...?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: There was no choice, they were assigned to where ever there was an opening and if they fit in,\nyou had to know something.",
        "A: You see, don\u2019t forget that a lot of people volunteered to go out of the ghetto. Forty-one, forty-\ntwo, their still volunteers. And then came the demands. We want 1500 people, we want 1000\npeople, whatever. And then, where were the people? Everybody had to work so naturally we had\ngiven, like old people, I had made out maybe 500 or 600 papers to go to the straw resort, for\ninstance. They were sitting there, there was nothing to do because there was that much work and\nthat much places but people had, that they were delegated to the straw aut-tie-lum (ph) where we\nhad old people, sick people. I must have made a few thousand people like this, you know. So, to\nanswer your question, it took me about ten days to organize the staff and I added as we went along\nand naturally after we were not through with the registries because, but three days and three nights it\ntook to get the bulk into paperwork so they could get to the kitchen to get some food or get some, or\nwhere ever the food was distributed.",
        "Q: So you registered over 100,000 people in three days and three night?",
        "A: Yes. You cannot image what it was like.",
        "Q: I think \u2019'm right. 120,000 at that time? In the beginning, in 1940?",
        "A: Oh no, it was more.",
        "A: When the ghetto was closed we had over 200,000.",
        "A: Over 200,000, almost a quarter of a million people we had in the ghetto.",
        "A: But then, very shortly the first transport was organized. Where the rough element was sent out\nfirst. And then a lot of volunteers came to be out of the ghetto.",
        "Q: Did they send a lot of very, very poor people?",
        "A: By what do you mean, very poor people? Everybody was poor!",
        "Q: What I am wondering is, was their a hierarchy in the ghetto in terms of the population? Some\npeople came in wealthy, right? Some people came in with things, other people came...",
        "A: But they had to give everything away. There was a special place. Jewelry first...",
        "Q: But did everybody give everything away?",
        "A: No, no, you are absolutely right. Some people came in with some valuables. Then they started\nlater on if they needed, and everybody was trading some valuables for food.",
        "A: Bertie, we didn\u2019t turn in our jewelry until the last day.",
        "Q: But that\u2019s what I mean.",
        "A: That\u2019s what I just said. That everybody who had something could bring it in because nobody,\nthey didn\u2019t have to undress, like when they went to the camp in Auschwitz, they had to completely\nstrip and everything was taken away from them. So, naturally, people came into the ghetto with\nwhatever valuables they had. But they did not hide.",
        "Q: Right, but there would be some people who might not have had anything?",
        "A: Absolutely. Most of them. Because let\u2019s not forget that there were a lot of poor Jews in Poland.",
        "Q: Were they more vulnerable?",
        "A: Vulnerable in what sense?",
        "Q: Well, vulnerable in terms of the amount of food they would get, their inability to barter or...?",
        "A: No. They were better equipped to withstand these environments than the higher class of people\nbecause they were poor people. They were always in need for something so they could adjust to\nthese bad circumstances and conditions much easier than like, people like my father-in-law who\nwas a very affluent man. He had everything he wanted because he was a big owner of a big factory,\nokay? So naturally, he suffered much, much more and had much more trouble adjusting to these\nconditions than the guy who was poor.",
        "A: When you see the picture from my wedding, he looked like a skeleton.",
        "A: So also, on the survivor list, when you look at the survivors today, I would say that about 80% of\nthe surviving class were poor people.",
        "A: Bert, be careful.",
        "A: Today, if you talk to them, everybody was a big man with their factories and had a big working\nstaff for themselves and everybody was rich and we know that they were eaten up by the lice. So\nyou find that the element, or the class of people who were in that conditions before the war adjusted\neasier to the bad conditions in the ghetto than the better class of people, if we want to classify them.",
        "Q: Was that true for you? You didn\u2019t come from a poor background.",
        "Q: For me I would say that since I became right away in an upper position where I would get a little\nbit more than others I could easier adjust to the condition than most of them because as I said I was\nin terrific physical condition. Because I was a sportsman all the way through. I think that because\nof my physical condition I was able to survive and adjust to the conditions.",
        "Q: In terms of your work, what was the hardest thing you had to do?",
        "A: The hardest thing I had to do? That is a tough question.",
        "Q: We talked about that yesterday.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What was it at that time that made you say, I don\u2019t want to be doing this anymore? Was there a\nspecific incident or was it a set of incidents that happened to you?",
        "A: No, the demands which were set forth to the , to the department of labor, which I could\nnot combine with any of my philosophy and my characters. And when we actually were forced to\nsupport the committee who had to make lists of deportations, I just couldn\u2019t digest that. And that\u2019s\nwhy, also with the influence of Irene, that I finagled myself out of that and let my other partner do\nthis job. That was the time I would not, I would have loved to get out of it, out of the position I was\nin.",
        "Q: And why do you thing, I know that Rum-cof-ski (ph) threatened you, but that was different.\nWhy didn\u2019t he say to you, you\u2019ve got to do it? This is part of the job, you can\u2019t do part of the job\nand not the other part of the job? Do you have any idea?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Was there ever any talk between Rum-cof-ski (ph) or just other heads of departments\nquestioning or thinking about philosophy and moral aspects of the work and the choosing and...?",
        "A: Iam sure such conditions, such conferences and discussion took place.",
        "Q: Do you recall any sense of, more theoretical conversations?",
        "A: Certain occasions, yes. We could discuss personal things and personal ideas.",
        "A: When the Rabbi came, he was playing chess with the Rabbi. It was then that they had some\ndiscussions. Because Bert had a dilemma you know. There was a lot of nepotism going on, there\nwas a lot of, like, my own cousin. They came in, they wanted to bribe you and Bert would take\nthem by the neck and throw them out. He was the heavy one. But he just couldn\u2019t believe that you\ncould put a price on a human life.",
        "Q: So what did you talk about with the Rabbi when you played chess?",
        "A: Various things of what his experiences because he had much more contact with the people than I\nhad. To him they came with all their complaints and all their headaches and conditions while they\ndid not have, my door was not open to the general population because they had to go through\nvarious instances before they could come to my office. You could not just walk into my office\nbecause otherwise I would have never been able to do anything.",
        "Q: What extent did you feel as tools?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: As tools, used by the Germans by how impossible your situation and position, yours and Rum-\ncof-ski (ph) and others?",
        "A: Well, I must say thank heaven that I never had anything to deal with the Germans. My dealing\nwas directly with Rum-cof-ski (ph).",
        "Q: But in general, they built a certain structure in which the Jews in the ghetto had to do things that\notherwise maybe they had to do, the Germans?",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t think of anything they asked us to do what they should do because they just...",
        "Q: Well, like they assign people to factories and produce thing for them?",
        "A: For themselves, for them personally?",
        "Q: No, not personally. For the good of the Reich?",
        "A: Well, that was the purpose of our existence in the ghetto.",
        "A: Of our survival.",
        "A: We survived because of that.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t see yourselves as being manipulated by them in some sense, you thought, Rum-\ncof-ski (ph) in some way felt he was manipulating them in order to save people?",
        "A: No, we were just doing what was in that condition, we were put in that condition by the elders of\nthe Jew in prolonging our lives by working for them. This doesn\u2019t make any near collaboration.",
        "Q: No, no that\u2019s not what I meant. What I meant is to what extent you felt that the Germans forced\nyou to be in a position which felt so uncomfortable as to the point to say to Rum-cof-ski (ph), Ok, I\ndon\u2019t want to do that anymore.",
        "A: The Germans did not put any demands on myself.",
        "Q: Not personally, but in general?",
        "A: The put demands on their own...",
        "A: They put demands on the ghetto. And the spokesman was Rum-cof-ski (ph). Rum-cof-ski (ph)\nand Yakovobitch (ph), these two people. These two people were the liaison people between the\nghetto and the German ghetto fo-vert (ph). They got the demands and they had to give the orders on\ndown to the other people of what has to be done.",
        "Q: I mean, one instance of it 1s the Germans could have said, we are going into the ghetto and we\nare going to take 1500 healthy people...",
        "A: They did it.",
        "Q: No, I know. But they also said, you choose them.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You bring the, you make the deportation decision.",
        "A: First they did. First they said. And if the demand was not met, then they came in and did it\nthemselves.",
        "Q: So, one could have made the choice, we\u2019re not going to do it? That is a choice, that it could have\nbeen made, I don\u2019t know what that would have meant?",
        "A: Yes. The result was that they did it themselves.",
        "Q: There is a description in the chronicle again, maybe in the Polish book, in which there was a\ndemand for 1500 healthy men in February of 1944.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: In which Rum-cof-ski (ph) asked for the heads of the departments to come and...",
        "A: Yes, and they had to be healthy people and they had to be examined by the doctors, you know,\nthat they are healthy.",
        "Q: And people tried to get out of this meeting and he said, if we don\u2019t do it then they will do it.",
        "A: Right. And they did, they did.",
        "Q: Now you, in the chronicle\u2019s description of that meeting, it starts saying he asked you to do\nsomething but for better or worse Clinger or some other man did it, but it doesn\u2019t say you refused.\nBut from your description of yourselves...",
        "A: Bert did not refuse.",
        "Q: You refused and then it says, for better or worse this other man did it.",
        "A: Your talking about Bert, he didn\u2019t refuse, he just manipulated Rum-cof-ski (ph) because he was\nsick. He couldn\u2019t go sick...",
        "Q: No, because there\u2019s an empty space in this report where it goes from you being asked to do\nsomething and it\u2019s saying, for better or worse, so-in-so did it, it doesn\u2019t say anything about how it\nhappened.",
        "A: okay.",
        "A: No, because, are you talking about Lut-sek (ph) in Lut-sek\u2019s (ph) book, Dr. W. Lut-sek-ies (ph)?",
        "Q: Yes, the chronicles of that meeting. But he didn\u2019t write the chronicles, he translated what had\nbeen written before.",
        "A: No, he collected all the data from the Archives.",
        "A: Now, but, I was able to get out of it.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: okay. It wasn\u2019t easy. It was not easy to get out of it. And people still thought that I was\ninvolved.",
        "Q: To what extent were you aware that there was hatred towards Rum-cof-ski (ph) and the whole\nJewish Counsel and to what extent was their admiration that, yes, you saved our lives by giving us\nwork\u2019?",
        "A: There were I think a much smaller percentage of the ghetto people who felt favorable towards\nRum-cof-ski (ph). Why, the mass, the bulk of the people hated Rum-cof-ski (ph) and put him in,\nthought of him in such a way that he was a demagogue, that he was a tyrant and that he did mean\nwell for the ghetto. We know better. We who saw everything and were involved in almost\neverything know better. That he was the man who really manipulated the Germans at that time and\nwas able to convince them to let us do what we had to do so that we can survive.",
        "Q: So what did he have to offer that 1t was so valuable to the Germans?",
        "A: The work.",
        "Q: That was so valuable to them?",
        "A: We had tremendous talents. Yes, we had talents in every phase of the human being, whatever\nthere is to do. We had the intelligence, we had the workmen for it, we had the architects.",
        "A: We had the brains.",
        "A: We had everything. We had everything in the ghetto.",
        "Q: But you also have Bebof who wanted this, right?",
        "A: Bebof? Well, he felt that he has something, a force which he can use.",
        "Q: Right. So, it was...",
        "A: And he was able to convince all the leading people to have the ghetto provide , SO what\nthey intended to do.",
        "Q: Because certainly you had talented people in the Warsaw ghetto and they had work shops, that\nthey ran quite differently.",
        "A: Absolutely, but the only thing is that they were able to communicate with our sites, able to buy\nweapons and arm themselves.",
        "Q: Their work was not that valuable, it was the same work they were doing now in Warsaw or in\nKov-now (ph)?",
        "A: Yes. But what finished it? The riot. The uprising.",
        "A: No, Bertie, before that they weren\u2019t as organized as the Lodz ghetto.",
        "Q: No, the deportations are before the uprising.",
        "Q: In 1942, there were 330,000 people deported.",
        "A: So they could not satisfy the Germans as we could.",
        "Q: So you think that it was the quality of their work or?",
        "A: Probably. Because if they would have satisfied the Germans as we had, they probably would\nhave also been left alive.",
        "Q: That\u2019s very interesting.",
        "Q: But, of course, Warsaw is not in the Reich, it\u2019s in the general government and was in a different\nsituation.",
        "A: It was the symbol of Poland and the Germans hated the Poles. Do you realize that we had\nfactories, you name it and we had it. Metal, everything.",
        "Q: Would you like to look at some of them?",
        "A: This is the comb factory. I don\u2019t know this one.",
        "A: The comb factory?",
        "Q: Was there a comb factory?",
        "A: Not that I know.",
        "A: Not that I know of. And this is indubitably the comb because he has a Bunsen burner,\nwhat we call the Bunsen burner and he has some metal here too.",
        "Q: Do what do you think it is?",
        "A: This definitely will be the metal resort.",
        "A: They had a fake metal resort.",
        "Q: How did they get combs from this?",
        "A: You made combs in concentration camps. The Lodz ghetto paper resort is what it was, so it\nwasn\u2019t a comb factory, it was a paper resort.",
        "A: These are grinding tools, grinding and sharpening the tools.",
        "Q: So you think it was all metal resort, right?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The same thing here.",
        "A: Here they have, you know, combs is very easy to make.",
        "A: Iron horns at the comb factory again, comb factory.",
        "A: Here you see combs.",
        "Q: Did these factories have names other than the name of the kind of work?",
        "A: Only the kind of work, like metal resorts, clothes resorts, shoe resorts...",
        "A: I don\u2019t even know that we had a comb factory.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: And you were head of the labor department?",
        "A: That\u2019s news to me!",
        "A: Yeah, to me too.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t have a comb factory.",
        "A: Yeah, mother did my combs. Combs are very easily made, you know that?",
        "A: Here they are grinding them, but...",
        "A: Yeah. Jack-o-vich (ph) made for me in the concentration camp a comb from metal. He made it,\nit was easy.",
        "Q: Well maybe there were metal combs to be made?",
        "A: okay. It has to be metal comb because there was no plastic at that time.",
        "Q: Of course. So, maybe part of a metal factory was making combs?",
        "A: It had to be that, it had to be that because they had to be metal combs.",
        "A: , he was in charge of the metal department, he lives in Cleveland.",
        "Q: How big were these factories?",
        "A: Big.",
        "A: The metal factory was big.",
        "Q: But some of them would be smaller than others?",
        "A: Yeah. The hat factory was small.",
        "Q: The hat factory?",
        "A: Hat factory. They had a hat factory and lingerie and...",
        "Q: Did people come asking for protection?",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah a lot.",
        "Q: What did you do?",
        "A: What Bert did? He \u2014 \u2014 , and he made enemies.",
        "Q: They come to you to ask for protection to come back to your boyfriend or husband at that time?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: How did it make you feel?",
        "A: Awful, awful. But I had an influence on him and he always made the right judgment because he\nis a very honorable man, I have to say it in front of him. He had integrity, this is what drew me to\nhim.",
        "Q: And me, God forbid you shouldn\u2019t say it in front of him. [Laughter]",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: The rubber factory where you were working?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Was that large? There were two hundred women working with you. That was large?",
        "A: Yes, it was large.",
        "Q: Was there more going on in that factory than just the coats you were making?",
        "A: No, coats. Rain coats, rubber coats.",
        "A: This here, it was metal, pots and pans.",
        "A: The same here. No, here they could dress, or tailoring.",
        "Q: Pots and pan was part of the metal factory?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: What is this?",
        "A: Shoeing workshop. Yes. That\u2019s correct.",
        "A: Yeah, this is manufacturing.",
        "A: Pop-e-nich (ph). Says there Pop-e-nich (ph). That\u2019s the scale.",
        "A: Yeah, they weigh something.",
        "A: Feather resort.",
        "A: Oh, no, you know where we were collecting the feathers? In the church were I was working.",
        "A: That\u2019s a scale and the feather resort.",
        "A: We had the whole church, 1t was piled with feathers and we had to put it in containers. And it\nwent to Germany, you know.",
        "Q: Did everything the factories make go to Germany?",
        "A: Everything.",
        "Q: So nothing was made...?",
        "A: Some was left over for the people. Like, for instance, my leather case for the ID card. Raw\nmaterial from the Germans and, you know, the cigarette case.",
        "A: There was a lot of pilfering, a lot of people, whoever was sitting by the Shisel (ph), Off-gee-\ngessen (ph), you know what I am talking about? Everybody helped himself like an asha (ph), you\nhad to organize.",
        "Q: Their stuffing, I think, there...",
        "A: Their stuffing cushions.",
        "A: Oh, this looks like the church we worked in!",
        "A: That is the church.",
        "A: Yeah? The last one when we were...",
        "Q: The church was outside?",
        "A: No, the church was right 1n center...",
        "A: Mon-ee-nas-ka (ph)?",
        "A: No, Sche-dos-ka (ph), Mon-sad-nee-marinko (ph), Sadi-e-rin-neck (ph).",
        "A: But it says here located on Mon-ee-nas-ka (ph).",
        "A: No, Sadi-e-rin-neck (ph), number four.",
        "A: You must know.",
        "A: Oh year, I know.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s exactly the place?",
        "A: Yeah. A church, I was working there for a few weeks before the transport was sent out, they had\nus going every day to the church and to fill these feathers in containers. I don\u2019t know what\nhappened.",
        "Q: The feathers came from, what, from villages?",
        "A: From, probably. Probably from people\u2019s, I don\u2019t know, from people\u2019s cushions or whatever, or\ncomforters probably. And they cleaned it and then they sent it to Germany.",
        "Q: Everything went to Germany.",
        "A: Oh, there\u2019s so much Jewish wealth in Germany still.",
        "Q: Did Bebof make a lot of money?",
        "A: Oh! His daughter 1s rich.",
        "A: He made himself a millionaire.",
        "A: His daughter, he has two daughters, I think they live in Bremen, no? Bebof\u2019s children, Bert?\nWhere did Bebof\u2019s daughter live, in Bremen?",

Bertie threw people out when they came with bribery and stuff like that because he\nbelieved that everybody has to have the same right to survive. And he couldn\u2019t believe that you can\ndie, your death time in ghetto where we were all together. But, this is unbelievable!",
        "Q: Listen, this is half a sentence in a book of 600 pages...",
        "A: I don\u2019t care!",
        "Q: But then we don\u2019t know what\u2019s on the other 600 pages!",
        "A: Teresa, don\u2019t forget one thing. Me. I am being with him almost 53 years old. He\u2019s the biggest\npush over and he is such a softie.",

        "A: And we are in touch with all the Lodz survivors.",
        "Q: They would have gotten you?",
        "A: We are belonging to the Mes-ada (ph) which is a Zionist organization of only survivors. We\nmeet twice a year.",

        "Q: No.",
        "A: He just heard he was a shish-ka! You know what a shish-ka is? A big shot!",
        "Q: Yes, but he was accusing Bert not of what, being Jewish in the ghetto, but he was accusing him\nof being the Nazi, right? That\u2019s who they thought he was.",
        "A: They thought that he was the Chief of the Gestapo, I guess, I don\u2019t know! As it happened, by\ncoincidence...",
        "Q: The same name.",
        "A: But you have it in the chronicle so you know tt.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t do anything derogatory, they didn\u2019t write about Bert because what they say...",
        "Q: No, no, no. But if this man thought that Bert, that was obviously what the government thought.\nThat he was going, that he changed his first name, right?",
        "A: He didn\u2019t change his first name.",
        "Q: No. Fuchs, the Gestapo, the SS...",
        "A: Was Glinther (ph).",

        "A: He started to beat up people in the face with a horse whip. I have to laugh! He was from Lodz,\nbut for many years he was in Germany and he was deported in \u201839 and by profession he was a\nGigolo. The same day that he came, Bebof sent him a nomination on this position with four weeks\nauck-ses-brun-dna (ph).",

        "A: I can\u2019t believe that.",
        "A: Unbelievable.",
        "A: And that Bebof gave him an order to exchange everybody that worked for him over forty years\nfor younger people. He had old people, he had all kinds of people working there.",
        "A: The whole thing is unbelievable.",
        "Q: When you said, the Eidelson (ph) film, that you didn\u2019t like it at all, either one of you. What did\nyou find troubling about his film?",
        "A: A lot of discrepancies. I told him. He was very upset with me.",

        "A: Absolutely!",
        "A: By the same token they waited for Rum-cof-ski (ph).",
        "A: Don\u2019t forget there was a lot of jealousy in the ghetto.",
        "Q: Go on.",
        "A: Well, you see, because in my position people didn\u2019t understand and they, first of all, a lot of\npeople thought that I am the Gestapo Fuchs. When I arrived in this country I had this in my\ninterview that, when I arrived, before, when I asked for my first papers to be able to work they\ndenied me the first papers and I was interrogated every single week for a year and a half.",
        "Q: Oh my God!",

        "Q: And who wants to serve Fuchs, the Gestapo man?",
        "A: Commissioner Fuchs.",
        "A: They got him on the street in Hannover a few years ago, after so many years, somebody caught\nhim. Who caught him, Bertie?",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall.",
        "A: What is the fellow, that en-ropa (ph) en-ropa (ph), his brother told you that.",
        "Q: Harold? Solomon Carroll?",
        "A: Yeah. Pearl told us when we were in Israel three years ago. He was telling us that they caught\nhim in Hannover. That Pearl caught him in Hannover.",

        "Q: They didn\u2019t have to change their initials.\n[Laughter]",
        "A: So Bernard Fuchs became Bert Fleming.",
        "A: And we had other incidents like that. Like this woman in Fairfield. She didn\u2019t know us in\nghetto...",
        "A: She was a child.",
        "A: Yes. And I said, how do you know somebody? After her father told her. What did he tell?\nWhen he had to lecture at the Masons, they called him, this and this happened. What was she\ntelling them? That Bert sent, my first name was Yakovobitch (ph), my first husband. That he sent\nhim to and let, get rid of him so he could marry me, first of all. He lived and he was in a\nconcentration camp and he, then, what was the other one? That we changed the names because we\nwere hiding out. You see how we hide out? And what else was the third one?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, three things.",
        "A: Three things like that. And then she calls me up and tell me...",
        "Q: Very .",
        "A: Absolutely. I went immediately to my Rabbi.",
        "A: He wanted to sue.",
        "A: And I wanted in Torah.",
        "A: So the Rabbi said, sue...",
        "A: The Rabbi investigated. He even called Europe and he called the Lodz Society, the Lodz\nsurvivors, and they called a meeting and they talked. Is there somebody to talk against him? So\nthey came back to the Rabbi and said, no, absolutely not. He is not the war criminal and he didn\u2019t\ndo any atrocities.",
        "A: They said if many people would be like Bert more people would have survived.",
        "A: So, if the Rabbi called that woman and said, you better keep your mouth shut because he can sue\nyou for everything you have. And that was it.",
        "A: This was two weeks before my daughter\u2019s wedding. This is when Lud-zig (ph) was here, that\nSunday, and two weeks later was the wedding. Then, the woman had the nerve to call me and say,\noh, you have such a lovely mother. You are so lucky. I said to her, Fren-ia (ph), how could you do\nsuch a thing?",
        "Q: Did you know her before?",
        "A: Yes, I was working in a Department store and she was friendly with our friends. She played\ncards with them so once I came to her house to meet our friends and then she was calling and she\nwanted to be friendly and I had nothing in common with her. So, she would call me, you know, I\nshould buy her this and that. Bert was away. I had on my lunch time to take care of my shopping\nand then run home to cook his. I didn\u2019t have the chance to buy for her, she wanted to be friendly. I\nhad nothing in common with her. She passed away a year later.",
        "Q: What did she say to you when you asked her why, what were you doing?",
        "A: She heard it from her father. That Bert, I don\u2019t, three things. Now it\u2019s really slipped my mind\nwhat the third, it\u2019s going to bug me.",
        "Q: But if she was...",
        "A: She was working, going around to a lot of people and bad mouthing Bert. So we wanted to sue\nand the Rabbi said, a Jewish person, to sue a Jewish person and so on and he says, I want to find out\non my own and he, we didn\u2019t give him names of people where to go. He went right away to the\nJewish, to the Lodz Jewish Survivor and they had an emergency meeting, they discussed this matter.",
        "Q: Was there any statement that they wrote, the survivors of Lodz?",
        "A: No, the Rabbi Stein, our Rabbi talked to the President at that time and he was, as a matter of fact,\nin Florida, he specially flew in from Florida to make an emergency meeting. And the people said it\nwas nonsense.",
        "Q: Has this happened to you, I mean, where other people have come up to you and accused you of\nthings?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So their isolated incidences?",
        "A: Yes, their isolated but painful...",
        "A: As I said, we are belonging to the Mes-ada (ph) which are only survivors and a lot of them from\nLodz, who went through the Lodz ghetto, and the best of friends and they would never have\naccepted me if I had been that brutal floor dancer, gigolo.",
        "Q: Well, life is tough, huh?",
        "A: It\u2019s very, very painful you know, to know that you have to fight such lies. And this is for\nposterity, it\u2019s a book, it\u2019s a printed book.",
        "A: He writes here on Herman Gering, on two, four, six, eight, maybe twenty pages. He writes about\nGunter Fuchs.",
        "A: What does he know about him? Most of the people in ghetto they didn\u2019t know a thing. Only a\nfew people that were close knew, nobody knew anything that was going on.",
        "A: Gerber Josef in two, four, six, in eight pages. What has Gerber to do with Jews after the...?",

        "Q: It would be interesting maybe to...",
        "A: Herschel Greenspan, he write about Herschel Greenspan.",
        "Q: To get a written statement, you know, and publish it?",
        "A: You know, we should have done that right after the war. To have statements from people that\nBert saved them.",
        "Q: Well, it didn\u2019t occur to you.",
        "A: What for?",
        "A: Bert always felt very strong about it. He said...",
        "A: What did I do?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t do anything, I know Iam fine. So this is why we never reached out.",
        "A: Hannah Hovich.",
        "A: You know who that 1s?",
        "A: She ,",
        "A: Gi-za (ph) is Hannah Hovich.",
        "Q: But this is also why I think your diary is important. Even if you primarily want your daughter...",
        "A: No, this is the diary from the concentration camp...",
        "Q: No, no, no, I understand that. I am sure it\u2019s...",
        "A: Rudolph Hess.",
        "A: Let\u2019s forget about it, all right?",
        "A: Heinriech Himler. Look at it.",
        "A: What do you care?",
        "Q: This is just a name index, you know, whom he mentions.",
        "A: Adolf Hitler. Look how many pages!",
        "Q: But I am sure he\u2019s talking about policy, German policy so he has to mention the people who\ncreated policy. He\u2019s not, I mean, we don\u2019t even know if he was in the Lodz ghettos. If you doing a\nhistory...",
        "A: I will tell you all frankly I wouldn\u2019t even attempt to read the book. It\u2019s garbage.",
        "A: I am surprised, I would like to know whether he was in the ghetto or not.",
        "Q: I will go and skim it now...",
        "Q: But this may not be his name.",
        "Q: I will skim the book which maybe he says, do you have his phone number?",
        "A: Who\u2019s number?",
        "Q: Nat-tik\u2019s (ph).",
        "A: Nat-tik\u2019s? At home, yeah.",

        "Q: No, no, no, it\u2019s just the phone number for and we could, you know, call. Maybe he\ncould, maybe he knows him or something.",
        "A: Maybe, probably! He knows the whole world.",
        "Q: And especially since it\u2019s in Sweden.",
        "A: You know, Nat-kit (ph), he knows everybody. He was a good guy. He is a good guy.",
        "Q: Did your sister write anything down?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Dora never wrote anything down afterwards?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did she talk much to you after the war or did you just not speak very much about it? I mean, I\ndon\u2019t want to know about the situation...",
        "A: No, she was with me in the Cannes, she never, never. She avoided the situation because I asked\nher many times very intimate questions and she, we never, she would start crying. Burst out crying.",
        "A: [Speaking in foreign language]",
        "A: This is the same thing as before. [Speaking in foreign language].",
        "Q: What is nien-ya-kego (ph)?",

        "A: Oh, that would be nice. No, they say that he came, that Bebof came to the liaisons offices, there\nwas a no-man\u2019s zone on a market...",
        "A: The central office.",
        "A: And there were German officers and the Jewish officers.",
        "Q: They were 1n the same area?",
        "A: No. Bert was someplace else.",
        "A: No, the central office. They were special [marketplace], all right? And it was completely, you\ncouldn\u2019t go, anybody couldn\u2019t go in there, you had to go through procedures.",
        "A: I can\u2019t believe it!",
        "Q: So that Rum-cof-sk1\u2019s (ph) offices and your sister Dora...",
        "A: They were in my office and in the ghetto, the ghetto also had their own office also.",

        "A: No, separate building.",
        "Q: But in the same marketplace?",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And she never...",
        "A: This is why we assume that she had very personal bad experience.",
        "Q: With Bebof, your talking about?",
        "A: Yes, with Bebof. Right, Bertie?",
        "A: I mean, she could have written a book, you know, with all this information, but she didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Oh, absolutely!",
        "A: She wanted to forget I guess.",
        "Q: Yeah. And no one came to try to interview her?",
        "A: No. She passed away in \u201862.",
        "Q: Yes, I know that.",
        "A: Nobody spoke about anything until the last few years.",
        "Q: Did she talk to you about, I keep thinking of Churn-yok-of (ph), Rum-cof-ski (ph). Did she\nspeak to you about him?",
        "A: She knew that he knows me.",
        "Q: I know, but did she speak to you about what she was doing? Forget the Bebof thing because\nclearly there may have been some incident that was very uncomfortable.",
        "A: No. She never said a word about her work or the conditions in which she was working. No, she\nnever mentioned it. Even after the war, she was clamming up, she wouldn\u2019t talk.",
        "A: It\u2019s amazing.",
        "A: It is amazing. Because every little word here was a page, was a horse whip that he was, who had\nin the ghetto a horse whip and who would dare to horse whip anybody!",
        "Q: No, I thought at least you\u2019d want to know...",
        "A: Well, yes.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, absolutely. It\u2019s just, I don\u2019t understand.",

        "A: I think I even have her address. Her sister gave it to me, Rosa.",
        "Q: Do you think she might, I mean for all I know she\u2019s been interviewed in Israel, we\u2019ve had a\nproject there, had a project, but it would be very nice if that was the case to get...",
        "A: It\u2019s so painful, it\u2019s painful!",
        "Q: Well, of course, it\u2019s painful but it\u2019s also really important historically because those women\nprobably knew more than a lot of other people did.",
        "A: Absolutely!",
        "Q: Secretaries always know a lot.",
        "A: Oh yeah. And so did Schel-mek-bertie-feldon (ph), he was on the Bous-kein-e-neck (ph).",
        "A: Schel-mek-bertie (ph)? No he was not. No, he was in the no? What did Schel-\nmek do, I don\u2019t know what he did in the ghetto?",
        "A: How did he have the connection when we gave him the jewelry to exchange, how did he have\nthe connection with the Germans?",
        "A: He isn\u2019t over the hill from the Germans, I don\u2019t know where he got the stuff, but where was he\nworking? Wasn\u2019t he working at ?",
        "A: Nat-tik (ph). Nat-tik (ph) was giving us the meat for the dog, don\u2019t you remember?",
        "Q: You had a dog in the ghetto?",
        "A: Yeah. I got it from the head of the fire department. A puppy. And then we had to give him\naway, I don\u2019t know what happened, Bert? With the dog?",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall.",
        "Q: That\u2019s the second dog you had to...",
        "A: No, we had one dog. This is the one, the first one in my house.",
        "A: And then at my home town I had a German Shepherd, from the border police. Very sharp dog.\nBut he was one man dog.",
        "A: He didn\u2019t like me.",
        "A: When I was away, he wouldn\u2019t take food from Irene. I had to give him away when we left for\nthe...",
        "A: No Bertie, he became vicious when he jumped on me...",
        "A: Wait a second, I am just going to point out. I had him until the last days since when we left on\nour foot to go to When-toff (ph), to the camp, before we came to this United States. So I gave him\nto Is-peski (ph) on the Oar-stousch (ph).",
        "A: No, to Tren-ka (ph) you gave him...",
        "A: To Tren-ka (ph). And when we came to say good-bye, Tren-ka\u2019s (ph) son had the dog, and we\ncame to say good-bye and so...",
        "A: The dog jumped me.",
        "A: I said good-bye and we left. And then he came back and ripped her fur coat.",
        "A: On my neck.",
        "A: He was mad that we, he felt that we are leaving him, you know?",
        "A: Jumped on my back.",
        "Q: Now this is the dog you had when you...",
        "A: In Hannover, in Germany after the war. A beautiful dog.",
        "Q: Did you have dogs in the United States too?",
        "A: Always.",
        "A: But since I started traveling so we could not have a puppy because, every time to give it to a\nkennel, you know...",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if I should be sad that we came or not because this really was the last straw, you\nknow? Because it\u2019s such a lie. I wish you would meet the people...",
        "A: If I would have really, that guy that he describes here. We are living now in 1996. Liberated in\n1945. That means 50 years. You would think somebody wouldn\u2019t have come and would have done\nsomething to me?",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: If I would have really...",
        "Q: No, of course you are right.",
        "A: I would like to know where that guy 1s.",
        "A: Nat-tik (ph) will tell you if you call him.",
        "Q: I mean, I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s saying about other people. Apparently he\u2019s supportive of Rum-\ncof-ski (ph) but I haven\u2019t read it so. It sounds a little strange.",
        "A: I don\u2019t, why? I mean, Rum-cof-ski (ph), I told you, I was objective.",
        "Q: Yes, but in writing this way of Bert, why is he writing...?",
        "A: There was a lot of jealousy about Bert. He was a young man, 24 years old and in such a\npowerful position.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But he didn\u2019t exploit it. It\u2019s not him.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: You know, I know so much about him I don\u2019t want to convince you...",
        "Q: Well you don\u2019t have to, I believe you.",
        "A: [Speaking in foreign language].",
        "A: He was from Lodz but...",
        "A: He was a Lodzer, but lived a long time in Germany and then was in 1939 deported.",
        "Q: Which is not true.",
        "A: First of all I was born in, and I was not deported in 1939 only in 1938.",
        "A: He writes and he takes a lot of freedom here with the writing because he doesn\u2019t know! How\ndoes he know? Nobody knew his background. I was his wife and I didn\u2019t know his background.",
        "A: It was for . Iwas a gigolo.",
        "Q: Yeah, right.",
        "A: That\u2019s something. Nobody called me that.",
        "A: So. I called you a Casanova but...",
        "Q: That\u2019s different. That\u2019s better than a gigolo.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s sad. Very, very sad.",
        "Q: Now tell me, when your children have asked you, I mean, you\u2019ve said at least your older\ndaughter has wanted more information. When she asked you questions you didn\u2019t want to speak\nwith her or?",
        "A: No, we did, if she asked we answered.",
        "Q: Was she hesitant to ask you? So that\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t know so much do you think?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t talk much about it. Such things that happened, two weeks before my daughter\u2019s\nwedding. Naturally they both knew it. And they know their father.",
        "Q: No, I understand that, but you said that they didn\u2019t know the story in detail. Right?",
        "A: Details? Nobody knows. You are the only one that knows. We never told anybody anything.",
        "Q: But what I\u2019m wondering about 1s, is 1t because sometimes people don\u2019t want to talk. Other times\nthey want to talk and their waiting for someone to ask them a question. And I\u2019m just wondering if\nyour children, because often children with their parents, no matter what the past is, you know...",
        "A: She never came with direct questions.",
        "Q: That\u2019s what I mean. I think children...",
        "A: Oh, but Bert. You know mother told her plenty. My mother was very vocal.",
        "A: She might have talked, she might have discussed it with her grandmother.",
        "A: And they were very, very close with their granddaughter.",
        "A: But she never asked me direct questions about it.",
        "Q: Was your mother more vocal about it without somebody asking questions?",
        "A: My mother...",
        "A: My mother lived in the past. Mother-in-law, she lived in the past.",
        "Q: And so she would...",
        "A: And she was telling her feelings and her thoughts she was telling my daughters. They were very,\nvery close, very close. And they knew a lot from my mother and my mother knew a lot and she told\nthem as it is and they looked up to her.",
        "Q: That\u2019s interesting that children don\u2019t often, there is a shyness about asking their parents about\ntheir past. No matter what...",
        "A: Well, you see when they were young growing up we had our life to live, she had a hard time.\nBecause we always went somewhere else or she never had really to be able to socialize and have a\ncircle of friends.",
        "A: Not because we were hiding out, it\u2019s because his job took him.",
        "A: In my profession, traveled. And at that time we did not have a chance, or it never came to an\noccasion that she came to ask about this. Later on when she grew up and knows and she has her\nown child, she came around to be interested, more interested in what happened. And some she\nknows, some we told her, but she would like to know more. And when we get this tape now with\nyour interview...",
        "A: When she didn\u2019t know everything.",
        "A: She will know a little bit more.",
        "Q: Has she read about the Lodz ghetto? Did she read the chronicle?",
        "A: Yes. She has and she also has the film.",
        "A: And you wrote your observation on the margin, remember, in the chronicle?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Because there were a lot of discrepancies also and Bert wrote...",
        "A: Why does the chronicle of the Lodz ghetto in which I appear, why didn\u2019t they write about this\nlike this?",
        "Q: Bert, they don\u2019t at all.",
        "A: They would, if it was true, they would!",
        "A: And they researched everything, I think very carefully because this is all documented what they\nhave in the chronicle of the Lodz ghetto, is it not?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So 1s this really, if this would be the case, it definitely would have been written.",
        "Q: No, it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s not...right, no question.",
        "A: Somewhere.",
        "Q: Right. Can I ask you something? Today, in some ways, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because we\nwere going through the pictures, that you were more, and maybe Teresa\u2019s questions were better than\nmine, that you were able to talk more about some things? Or is it because we\u2019ve now been doing it\nfor two days?",
        "A: No. Because it was laying still for such a long time and today we were faced with the facts, we\nsaw the pictures so...",
        "A: If you have orange juice from the concentrate and you let it stay. If you have everything down\nthere and the water is up with things, and you have to shake it. And we now stirred everything up,\nokay? So now everything is again...",
        "Q: Going?",
        "A: Going, and it\u2019s full. It\u2019s all, it\u2019s not any more separated. It\u2019s solid from the shaking.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s possible that it would have been better if we had known this, to come to the museum first\nand look at the pictures and then do the interview and on video? I don\u2019t know, I am trying to figure\nout...",
        "A: Maybe yes, maybe no.",
        "Q: We don\u2019t know?",
        "A: We don\u2019t know, we don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: I mean, I\u2019m very glad that I decided that we would tape the conversation today because...",
        "A: Yeah, I wanted to have it out of the way. This is the purpose we came.",
        "Q: Because you were able, I mean, it seems that the more we talk the more comes out. But I think\nthe pictures are very helpful because they trigger...",
        "A: Yes, well, we were able to identify for them quite a few people.",
        "Q: Right. Absolutely. Are you glad you did this?",
        "A: In a way yes, 1n a way no.",
        "A: Yes and no. I\u2019m glad because we can live with ourselves. We are not the kind of people we, we\nwould never benefit from somebody\u2019s misery. This is not the type, listen! If we went to the flast-\nen-tralen (ph), the ghetto, and you had a witness, and Nat-kit (ph) who was working there and he\nwas giving us portion of meat that the dog should be having and we shared it with the dog. And I\nhad a witness. But you see, we didn\u2019t tell the Rabbi Stein to call him, we didn\u2019t tell him to call\nanybody. He went to the Lodzer people and they gave him names and he spoke to some people.\nBut, boy do we have already people that I know will really cheer us. But we never gave names.\nBut the two survivor girls we told you about it, I want you to talk to them. They are very sharp\nwomen. Very nice.",
        "Q: But when I was asking you about whether you are glad you came here and talked about your, is\nit difficult to live with 1t because now we\u2019ve shaken up the glass?",
        "A: This is difficult to live with because it\u2019s a big lie.",
        "A: Well, first of all, as I said I had a very restless night and...",
        "A: Eight o\u2019clock, quarter after eight we were in bed already. We were so shook up.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I was exhausted. Mentally. And for some reason I was very restless and I couldn\u2019t sleep well. I\nnapped then I was awake and I napped.",
        "A: Cat napping. I don\u2019t know, I feel so much shame that such a thing can surface now. I can\u2019t\nbelieve it.",
        "A: Somebody says something, is something different but written down in a book and, I don\u2019t know\nwhat kind of, how many books are printed or in how many books were sold and how many books\nwere read, right?",
        "A: Anybody that reads it, it\u2019s just awful.",
        "A: Somebody who really doesn\u2019t know reads this. My God, what kind of monster was this guy?\nsays you become such a powerful guy.",
        "Q: But does it become important to you even in light of that, that you were able to tell part of your\nstory? And that it is documented?",
        "A: Certainly, certainly it\u2019s important.",
        "A: But listen, when we talk about ourselves, we want to smell like roses, right?",
        "A: Yeah but we still state only facts.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t a thing that we wanted to defend ourselves because there is nothing to defend.",
        "Q: No, I didn\u2019t bring you here to defend yourselves. I brought you here to tell your story.",
        "A: But we said it as it is and there are still living people that can witness.",
        "A: Mmmm, interesting.",
        "A: Yeah. So many should have taken testimonies from all these people but this should be\ngoing back 40 years ago when everybody was alive because Bert had a lot of people that called him\nand thanked him. That they are alive. He\u2019s responsible for it.",
        "A: Well. You know that I mentioned it to you that I made an enemy and a friend at the same time.",
        "A: Maybe he\u2019s one of them?",
        "Q: No, but you were in a situation where you couldn\u2019t do for everybody. It was impossible.\nNobody could. So, there\u2019s...",
        "A: Nobody could. I am only human.",
        "A: Do you think if he could do something, he wouldn\u2019t do it for my father? That my father would\nbe alive if he would have the power?",
        "Q: Right. But what I\u2019m saying 1s that in situations of, even not situations of distress. All kinds of\nsituations where people have some power, some authority. They can\u2019t do everything for everybody.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So, you cannot ever satisfy people.",
        "A: I\u2019m guilty.",
        "Q: And in this situation it\u2019s particularly difficult. It was difficult for you. You didn\u2019t even want to\ndo it in some ways but it...",
        "A: okay. Then you can say I wanted something from him and he denied it. He didn\u2019t do it. okay?\nAll right, so he disappointed me. But bring up lies? Make such statements?",
        "A: Bertie, do you remember a fellow that use to be your family some distant relation and you were\nso helpful to him?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: He was always in your office whenever I came.",
        "A: A cousin.",
        "A: Some distant cousin and he had a wife.",
        "A: No, you remind me, yes.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know his name anymore. And whenever I came to, happen to come over to his office this\nwas, he was always asking Bert for something and I said to Bert, my God, he\u2019s always asking you\nfor things. He survived and his wife survived. And you know where we met him? After the war in\nHamburg it was a Schmelling match, boxing match. And he said to him, yes you are a good guy.\nAnd turned away. A fellow that had always, always asked for things and always, whenever Bert\ncould he always did it. Probably once he had to deny him, he couldn\u2019t.",
        "Q: You know it can also be people sometimes get very angry at people who have control.",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: Even if they do good things for them. Because it means...",
        "A: Jealousy.",
        "Q: Well it\u2019s not, I don\u2019t, it\u2019s sometimes more complicated than jealousy. Sometimes it\u2019s because\nyou don\u2019t have power yourself. And you have to rely on someone else. And that\u2019s not an easy,\nhuman situation.",
        "A: But still to make such statements.",
        "Q: Well this is different. We don\u2019t know what, you know.",
        "A: And you know, now it dawns on me. When I started to read 1t I remember that Nat-tik (ph) told\nus somebody\u2019s bad mouthing him. But we didn\u2019t pay any attention. We did not ask who it is and\nwhere it is. Now...",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t care less.",
        "A: Now it came to...",
        "Q: You mean you think this 1s it?",
        "A: Could be. Because he lives in Queens and in Sweden too. And Stockholm.",
        "A: Probably.",
        "Q: Well, we'll see what Teresa comes up with.",
        "A: It\u2019s unbelievable.",
        "Q: Well, it\u2019s a very complicated set of circumstances. And it brings out the best and it brings out\nthe worst, right? I mean, I\u2019m sure you saw it there?",
        "A: Yeah. But I just, I just, can\u2019t digest it. Can I have this?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Thank you. Put it together with the envelope. Is the Federal Express, does it have room in the\nenvelope. No? In there. Try it now.",
        "Q: Now, do you want to go and see the permanent exhibition for a little bit or are you too tired?",
        "A: 1am tired. I\u2019m tired and I\u2019m exhausted mentally. Very upset.",
        "Q: That\u2019s what I thought, that if you didn\u2019t go earlier.",
        "A: I\u2019m very upset because this is unbelievable.",
        "Q: Well, now I feel terrible, I...",
        "A: No, don\u2019t feel terrible. I\u2019m glad that I learned something.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t have an inkling about it.",
        "Q: Well I had no idea yesterday. Amy said that somebody had found this just this morning so, I\nthought, you know, that we would show it to you.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it\u2019s very interesting because otherwise how would I know that something\nlike this exists. All right. You will excuse me?",
        "Q: Absolutely. You want more water?",
        "A: No, that\u2019s why I take the candy now so, I get a little bit more saliva action.",
        "A: I\u2019m just, right now it bugs me what fry-ana (ph), you know, the third thing that she said to the\nRabbi.",
        "A: Yeah. One was that I sent Men-tak (ph), that I sent him on to the ghetto so that I can marry you?",
        "A: No, that you got rid of him.",
        "A: Oh yeah. That I got rid of him. So that I could marry you.",
        "A: Then we changed our names because we were hiding out.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And the third one, I don\u2019t know. It was three things, I remember.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Did...",
        "A: Yes?",
        "Q: I was just thinking about your temper and I was wondering if you thought that, in a way it\u2019s a\nstupid question. If you had every had to have dealings with the Germans that you actually could\nhave survived? Would you have been furious with them?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t understand the question.",
        "A: I don\u2019t either.",
        "Q: Because it\u2019s a conditional question, it has no reality. I was wondering that if you could have,\nremember we talked about your being a hot head?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And that with Rum-cof-ski (ph), you held your temper because he was also a hot head so it\nwould have been impossible.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And I was wondering if you had dealing with the Germans whether you could have, not that nice\nguy, but Bebof.",
        "A: No, the nice guy had nothing to do with it.",
        "Q: Right. Whether you could have kept your temper?",
        "A: He would have to control his temper I guess. Because he never blew his top with Rum-cof-ski\n(ph) just out of respect for an old man. Bert knew when to loose his temper...",
        "Q: Did you every loose your temper? Either alone or with someone, I mean, out of frustration?",
        "A: I\u2019m sure I did.",
        "A: I know with Sche-bit-ski (ph) when they came and wanted...",
        "A: Lalmost killed the guy.",
        "Q: What? When they wanted to bribe you?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Nobody buys me.",
        "A: Then I wish Abrom-ic Kud-meric (ph) would be available, Bert?",
        "A: Well, Eddie Kline?",
        "A: No, Eddie was living with Dora so he doesn\u2019t know how it conditions.",
        "A: He came, every time he came to me he played something on his harp.",
        "A: You want to call him? He\u2019s the adopted son of his sister. Whenever he had problems, he was a\nlittle boy, he would come to me...",
        "Q: It would be very interesting to talk with him, sure.",
        "A: He always came to me, he said, you are the only one I could talk to.",
        "Q: How old was he then?",
        "A: He was a boy of 14.",
        "A: No, 12 or 13.",
        "A: Or something like this.",
        "A: I know about, a young boy. Very lovely young boy.",
        "A: Today he\u2019s in his fifties, close to sixty, huh?",
        "A: Yeah, I think that he must be in his sixties, Bert.",
        "A: In his sixties, yes.",
        "Q: Do you see him?",
        "A: Oh yeah, whenever we have a chance.",
        "A: Yes, oh yes.",
        "Q: And where does he live?",
        "A: In Montreal.",
        "A: Yeah. I told you that his daughter is an international lawyer and his son 1s a professor.",
        "A: And he himself made himself a fortune by inventing and customizing sanding machines, like for\npig pens? The automatic assembly machines where certain parts are coming together and out comes\nthe end, the fixed product, the finished product. So, he made a lot of money with that. And he is an\nardent surfer rider. And he lived now for four month...",
        "A: A surfer.",
        "A: A surfer for four month or five months in a lot.",
        "A: So he can surf. A few years ago he was surfing in Australia, on a surfing trip.",
        "Q: Do you think he remembers a good deal about the ghetto?",
        "A: I\u2019m sure he did, I\u2019m sure he did.",

        "A: Nobody ever talked anymore about it. It was a chapter in your life that you didn\u2019t want to talk\nabout it.",
        "A: It was like a pack or an agreement amongst the people not to discuss it for one or another reason.\nIt was a period you really liked to forget. The only reason you talked about it is to give the message\nto the children.",
        "A: But lately when we get together, lately, we always wind up talking about it. Before we never\ndid.",
        "A: Because we are so much involved in teaching the young people not to forget because, after all,\nslowly we are leaving. Nobody left to be a witness for it. So now we have to take the last few years\nwe have to live to make sure that it is being spread out.",

        "Q: These things you put in the violin case?",
        "Q: Were you in hiding?",
        "Q: But, I guess my question is how did the violin survive once you...?",
        "Q: And what camp were you in?",
        "Q: And you were, the camp was?",
        "Q: And the whole time your violin went with you?",
        "Q: When you went to slave labor and the did not, they still did not confiscate it, which 1s a little\nunusual.",
        "Q: They took it away and then they...",
        "Q: You know we are wanting to get names from you so we can interview...",
        "Q: And do you want to go ahead and give us the calendar and then...?",
        "Q: And this, Teresa actually picked it up before I saw what it was, but it\u2019s a case?",
        "Q: This was not a typical case?",
        "Q: This was a present given to Bert from...",
        "Q: And his name then was Bernard Fuchs.",
        "Q: And when did you meet Mr. Fuchs?",
        "Q: That information we have on tape. They married in \u201843, right?",
        "Q: Ten months after you had met.",
        "Q: They were married by Rum-cof-ski (ph) right?",

        "Q: Do you want to tell me a little bit about the cigarette case?",
        "Q: And who gave you the case?",
        "Q: This is of the cigarette case.",
        "Q: Do you think they might have things from...",
        "Q: That he has the golden bridge taken off the back?",
        "Q: And there was a bridge made like this?",
        "Q: The Lodz bridge on the back, but it\u2019s not there.",
        "Q: So, it was, the case was something that was not carried with you?",
        "Q: Could you have entrusted it with somebody else?",
        "Q: To people that weren\u2019t hiding or?",
        "Q: Was he one of the last group to stay in Lodz?",
        "Q: So then, how was this found?",
        "Q: This isn\u2019t saying that it\u2019s Yakovobitch that made that case, is it? The three brothers who lived in\nLodz that are Lee and Yakovobitch and his two brothers?",

        "Q: Can you read it now?",
        "Q: I was just wondering if we should get it copied so that at least there is a permanent record of it?",
        "Q: Do you think at some point you might want to make it available, even 100 years from now?",
        "Q: We could tape record it...",
        "Q: Well somebody should just come to the house with a tape recorded, who doesn\u2019t know German\nso they don\u2019t understand what your doing, and you just read it out in German and at least there is a\nrecord because it\u2019s important to have something like that.",
        "Q: Well, but sometimes you need someone to just come and say, okay, now we are going to do...",
        "Q: I could have Jodie, Jodie doesn\u2019t understand any German so whatever your saying is safe.",

        "Q: One you can read this better and the other you can see this better, so you have both.",
        "Q: And if you need more copies we can always make more.",
        "Q: Or we can photograph the for you.",
        "Q: We can have them photograph the whole collection and then we can give you copies and we will\nalways have copies. Can I ask what your address is in Connecticut?",
        "Q: Would you like, for instance, if somebody comes in from the outside world and they want to\nlook up your collection, would it be clearer for them to look under \u2018Fuchs\u2019 or would it be clearer to\nlook under \u2018Fleming\u2019?",
        "Q: It\u2019s F-U-C-H-GS.",
        "Q: okay.",

        "Q: And was it personally from these two or?",
        "Q: The top one or the bottom one? What is this one, the one on the top right?",
        "Q: I see. So each one paid for the separate plaque?",
        "Q: And they presented it to you as a whole?",
        "Q: They presented it to you as a whole, complete, as it is now with the rest?",
        "Q: Is your birthday actually on the 17th of September?",
        "Q: Because one year says 29th of May? What is that?",
        "Q: Why is that?",
        "Q: I see, I see.",
        "Q: Why did they add that on?",
        "Q: So when it was first given to you did it look like this or they added something later?",
        "Q: I see. I may take this photo as well. Do you mind if I do that too?",
        "Q: You had metal works, right? There were engravers in the?",
        "Q: And where did such material come from for this kind of thing? Do you know?",
        "Q: So the bridge that was on the back, when it was taken, are you just assuming somebody didn\u2019t\ntake the whole thing and take away the whole case they just wanted it, just took off the back?",
        "Q: When did you recover this object?",
        "Q: Did you get it when you were back in Hannover?",

        "Q: When you found your brother, when your brother came? No, you found your brother before?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: What was your brother\u2019s name?",
        "Q: He was the one who told you about Irene?",
        "Q: Yes, but I think what we\u2019ll do is we will take a break and you can either go to the cafe and eat\nsomething or you can go to the permanent exhibition and see who you can see and then you can\ncome back and help them out with more photographs.",
        "Q: Well, the closest place is the cafe. We can bring you back lunch, if you want. We can go to the\ncafe and get lunch and you can come and eat in my office, if you want? Or you can go to the cafe\nyourselves and sit there?",
        "Q: okay. We can get things for you.",

        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: With a calendar like that, how many might be printed? Would thousands be printed or?",
        "Q: Where would you get it from?",
        "Q: No, I mean, where would you get something like that?",
        "Q: And given out to just a few people?",
        "Q: Did you walk around in the course of the day, going to the different factories and talking with\npeople or did you mainly stay in your office?",
        "Q: And were you looking for particular things, were you looking to see...",
        "Q: When you would go to the places would people run up to you and talk to you or would they stay\nworking?",
        "Q: And the other workers, you had 40 or 50 other people working for you, were they mainly in the\noffice or did they also walk around so they could report to you?",
        "Q: Did you have to make labor charts about who was working where?",
        "Q: So you could trail where the people, they had gone from this factory to that factory so you knew\nexactly?",
        "Q: Are those cards still available?",
        "Q: Now I know in Lodz, what?",
        "Q: In some cases, here but I\u2019m not sure if it was...",
        "Q: There are cards in Lodz now, that I know, with the names of a lot of people. Where they were\nliving. Which is something else I wanted to ask you. I wanted to show you the map. We have a list\nof the ghetto inhabitants and your listed here. As living in Belzar (ph).",
        "Q: Now, where was that?",
        "Q: And what\u2019s this other street, Huntz, what does that mean?",
        "Q: So you were Bezar (ph) Seven?",
        "Q: Unless it means we\u2019re in or near that street? I didn\u2019t see it anywhere.",
        "Q: Maybe it\u2019s one of the closest main streets?",
        "Q: Yes, so it\u2019s over there. I don\u2019t know why, it\u2019s very strange.",
        "Q: That\u2019s where the bridge...",
        "Q: There was an Aryan street?",
        "Q: Right, because that\u2019s much closer?",
        "Q: And this is the train tracks, the trolley tracks?",
        "Q: Yes. (inaudible), but I\u2019m getting more. How did you feel about it?",
        "Q: Did you have dreams last night?",
        "Q: Did you have particular things that were bothering you last night?",
        "Q: I think we have to change the hotel.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to tell Chris.",
        "Q: Where are you staying?",
        "Q: I don\u2019t like the area. So, you couldn\u2019t find the restaurant I told you about?",
        "Q: \u201cK\u201d and 17th, I think.",
        "Q: Yes, it\u2019s interesting. I think this is something that\u2019s easy for us to just put into the permanent\nexhibition because we have that case with all the currency. I mean, I would ask Yatz-ka (ph) if we\ncould contribute that because it\u2019s so small. And it\u2019s in great condition.",
        "Q: But this 1s such a , | would hope we would have an opportunity to exhibit it, but\nalso to be very clear in the text what it was. Especially because it\u2019s really very significant because\nof the odyssey or, it made it really something that is connected with the Jewish people. It\u2019s been\nvery lovely meeting you. I hope the rest of your stay here 1s .",
        "Q: I am trying to think 1f we should move into my office and they can have some lunch because if\nthey are going to come in here. Are there other things that we want to do, do a few more things\nwith photographs now?",
        "Q: We could do it after lunch.",
        "Q: Your right. We probably should do one at a time.",
        "Q: I very much want to show you the deportation photos, for you to tell me what is what, what is\ncoming and what is going.",
        "Q: When did they marry?",

        "Q: And you heard it from?",
        "Q: Yes, I understand but...",
        "Q: Do you think that everybody who had any function in the Jewish Counsel was subject to...?",
        "Q: You said that you met people that actually saw Rum-cof-ski (ph) being killed? Not just heard\nthat he had been killed?",
        "Q: Giertler (ph)?",
        "Q: Who?",
        "Q: And he told you about Rum-cof-ski (ph)?",

        "Q: Do you know her name?",
        "Q: Who is that?",
        "Q: How observant was Rum-cof-ski (ph) of the whole administration? Like on the calendar, all the\nHebrew dates are written and all the holidays are written and he was...?",
        "Q: Was he religious?",
        "Q: Was tradition important for him?",
        "Q: Is that in the ghetto or was that before the ghetto?",
        "Q: But, in the ghetto, was there observance of the holidays?",
        "Q: This 1s, well, heavy stuff!",
        "Q: I would like to go back to the Gish-telv (ph)...",
        "Q: And what is this, here?",

        "Q: So you never heard about this speech...?",
        "Q: Did you know about the official chronicle being written?",
        "Q: No, he didn\u2019t write this, this was written in the Ghetto.",
        "Q: Yes, because it was an official kind of diary of the activities.",
        "Q: But there\u2019s personal things there.",

        "Q: But did you go first to Dresden?",
        "Q: Directly?",
        "Q: How did you know that you were suppose to be going to Auschwitz and somebody changed their\nmind? Because you just said that.",
        "Q: When are you starting, soon? okay, let\u2019s take this stuff out. Mark that.",
        "Q: You shouldn\u2019t feel defensive, it\u2019s ummm...",
        "Q: To what extent at that time, not today, but at that time were you aware that the Lodz ghetto is so\ndifferent from others?",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t know?",
        "Q: I hear that people in Lodz before the ghetto was sealed...",
        "Q: Closed. They figured that it\u2019s better to go to Warsaw because this is not going to be annexed to\nthe Reich as opposed to Lodz which became part of the Reich and so they were afraid...",
        "Q: Wasn\u2019t it nght away announced?",

        "Q: No, no, no. I am saying that you felt that Alan Yakovobitch...?",
        "Q: How did Yakovobitch know that they are going to be sent on this march?",
        "Q: Had he worked with Bebof before?",
        "Q: Right. So he would possibly know, people would tell him things?",
        "Q: He didn\u2019t know who it was?",
        "Q: So he was simply trying to protect you?",

        "Q: Was there any talk, any...?",
        "Q: Did you think you were going to die>",

        "Q: But did you still believe this was a real possibility?",
        "Q: No body talked about the specifics?",
        "Q: When Teresa asked you whether you felt privileged about being on the last transport, did you\nfeel privileged in terms of your whole ghetto experience, given the position that you had in the\nghetto?",
        "Q: Did you get more food?",
        "Q: Did they other heads of the departments have a barber? They were all men, right?",
        "Q: Yes, I know that. Did they all have a barber?",

        "Q: When you were a kid? I mean, once you got a beard or when you grew up?",
        "Q: I\u2019m curious because it\u2019s not something one necessarily sees today.",
        "Q: So this really had nothing to do with your positions in life, this was what one would expect for\nthe male population.",
        "Q: Did your sister have a hairdresser?",
        "Q: I was wondering if the women had an equivalent?",
        "Q: Did you ever get your hair cut?",
        "Q: But then you said before you left together you shaved your head?",
        "Q: To have your hair cut?",
        "Q: Did you have a lot of meeting with your staff, these forty or fifty people who were...?",
        "Q: All of them together?",
        "Q: Parts of them?",

        "Q: Like what?",
        "Q: Did you have quotas for what people had to produce in each of these...?",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t. So when you would go to a factory and look around and talk to people and, if you\nwould criticize something, what would you criticize if something was going wrong? What would\nbe the kind of thing that would be going wrong?",
        "Q: You mean if they were stealing food?",
        "Q: Did I understand correctly that you were in the first period, one of the two people that were in\ncharge of employment or labor?",
        "Q: And then you became the head of the labor?",
        "Q: No, it was the other way around.",
        "Q: That was in the beginning or...?",
        "Q: I will copy it, I will only copy tt.",
        "Q: That was November, right, of \u201842, of \u201840?",
        "Q: But there was another person, right, that was like a co-director?",
        "Q: And then, in the beginning of \u201844 it changed again, that you were the only one in charge of...?",
        "Q: I want to know about that, that\u2019s later, tell me about the ,",

        "Q: So people stood in line?",
        "Q: To get their ken-car-ta (ph) or ous-vise (ph) or what?",
        "Q: And how did you make the decision about the, were the factories already set up?",
        "Q: And did you know how many people could go into each factory or you made an approximate?",
        "Q: But, three days and three nights that you were registering people, are you at the same time as you\nregistering them designating them for a particular factory?",
        "Q: So how long from the time that Rum-cof-ski (ph) hired you for this until you began to actually\nregister people? A week? Two weeks? I mean, it had to take you some time to figure it out?",
        "Q: To organize, to figure out how to organize?",
        "Q: And your talking about 1940?",
        "Q: And then, when people started there were demands for deportations and some of the people were\nyour workers from factories, right?",
        "Q: And then people came and said, I hear there is a free space in the comb factory, or paper assault\nor...?",
        "Q: So you registered over 100,000 people in three days and three night?",
        "Q: I think \u2019'm right. 120,000 at that time? In the beginning, in 1940?",
        "Q: Did they send a lot of very, very poor people?",
        "Q: What I am wondering is, was their a hierarchy in the ghetto in terms of the population? Some\npeople came in wealthy, right? Some people came in with things, other people came...",
        "Q: But did everybody give everything away?",
        "Q: But that\u2019s what I mean.",
        "Q: Right, but there would be some people who might not have had anything?",
        "Q: Were they more vulnerable?",
        "Q: Well, vulnerable in terms of the amount of food they would get, their inability to barter or...?",
        "Q: Was that true for you? You didn\u2019t come from a poor background.",
        "Q: For me I would say that since I became right away in an upper position where I would get a little\nbit more than others I could easier adjust to the condition than most of them because as I said I was\nin terrific physical condition. Because I was a sportsman all the way through. I think that because\nof my physical condition I was able to survive and adjust to the conditions.",
        "Q: In terms of your work, what was the hardest thing you had to do?",
        "Q: We talked about that yesterday.",
        "Q: What was it at that time that made you say, I don\u2019t want to be doing this anymore? Was there a\nspecific incident or was it a set of incidents that happened to you?",
        "Q: And why do you thing, I know that Rum-cof-ski (ph) threatened you, but that was different.\nWhy didn\u2019t he say to you, you\u2019ve got to do it? This is part of the job, you can\u2019t do part of the job\nand not the other part of the job? Do you have any idea?",
        "Q: Was there ever any talk between Rum-cof-ski (ph) or just other heads of departments\nquestioning or thinking about philosophy and moral aspects of the work and the choosing and...?",
        "Q: Do you recall any sense of, more theoretical conversations?",
        "Q: So what did you talk about with the Rabbi when you played chess?",
        "Q: What extent did you feel as tools?",
        "Q: As tools, used by the Germans by how impossible your situation and position, yours and Rum-\ncof-ski (ph) and others?",
        "Q: But in general, they built a certain structure in which the Jews in the ghetto had to do things that\notherwise maybe they had to do, the Germans?",
        "Q: Well, like they assign people to factories and produce thing for them?",
        "Q: No, not personally. For the good of the Reich?",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t see yourselves as being manipulated by them in some sense, you thought, Rum-\ncof-ski (ph) in some way felt he was manipulating them in order to save people?",
        "Q: No, no that\u2019s not what I meant. What I meant is to what extent you felt that the Germans forced\nyou to be in a position which felt so uncomfortable as to the point to say to Rum-cof-ski (ph), Ok, I\ndon\u2019t want to do that anymore.",
        "Q: Not personally, but in general?",
        "Q: I mean, one instance of it 1s the Germans could have said, we are going into the ghetto and we\nare going to take 1500 healthy people...",
        "Q: No, I know. But they also said, you choose them.",
        "Q: You bring the, you make the deportation decision.",
        "Q: So, one could have made the choice, we\u2019re not going to do it? That is a choice, that it could have\nbeen made, I don\u2019t know what that would have meant?",
        "Q: There is a description in the chronicle again, maybe in the Polish book, in which there was a\ndemand for 1500 healthy men in February of 1944.",
        "Q: In which Rum-cof-ski (ph) asked for the heads of the departments to come and...",
        "Q: And people tried to get out of this meeting and he said, if we don\u2019t do it then they will do it.",
        "Q: Now you, in the chronicle\u2019s description of that meeting, it starts saying he asked you to do\nsomething but for better or worse Clinger or some other man did it, but it doesn\u2019t say you refused.\nBut from your description of yourselves...",
        "Q: You refused and then it says, for better or worse this other man did it.",
        "Q: No, because there\u2019s an empty space in this report where it goes from you being asked to do\nsomething and it\u2019s saying, for better or worse, so-in-so did it, it doesn\u2019t say anything about how it\nhappened.",
        "Q: Yes, the chronicles of that meeting. But he didn\u2019t write the chronicles, he translated what had\nbeen written before.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "Q: To what extent were you aware that there was hatred towards Rum-cof-ski (ph) and the whole\nJewish Counsel and to what extent was their admiration that, yes, you saved our lives by giving us\nwork\u2019?",
        "Q: So what did he have to offer that 1t was so valuable to the Germans?",
        "Q: That was so valuable to them?",
        "Q: But you also have Bebof who wanted this, right?",
        "Q: Right. So, it was...",
        "Q: Because certainly you had talented people in the Warsaw ghetto and they had work shops, that\nthey ran quite differently.",
        "Q: Their work was not that valuable, it was the same work they were doing now in Warsaw or in\nKov-now (ph)?",
        "Q: No, the deportations are before the uprising.",
        "Q: In 1942, there were 330,000 people deported.",
        "Q: So you think that it was the quality of their work or?",
        "Q: That\u2019s very interesting.",
        "Q: But, of course, Warsaw is not in the Reich, it\u2019s in the general government and was in a different\nsituation.",
        "Q: Would you like to look at some of them?",
        "Q: Was there a comb factory?",
        "Q: Do what do you think it is?",
        "Q: How did they get combs from this?",
        "Q: So you think it was all metal resort, right?",
        "Q: Did these factories have names other than the name of the kind of work?",
        "Q: And you were head of the labor department?",
        "Q: Well maybe there were metal combs to be made?",
        "Q: Of course. So, maybe part of a metal factory was making combs?",
        "Q: How big were these factories?",
        "Q: But some of them would be smaller than others?",
        "Q: The hat factory?",
        "Q: Did people come asking for protection?",
        "Q: What did you do?",
        "Q: They come to you to ask for protection to come back to your boyfriend or husband at that time?",
        "Q: How did it make you feel?",
        "Q: And me, God forbid you shouldn\u2019t say it in front of him. [Laughter]",
        "Q: The rubber factory where you were working?",
        "Q: Was that large? There were two hundred women working with you. That was large?",
        "Q: Was there more going on in that factory than just the coats you were making?",
        "Q: Pots and pan was part of the metal factory?",
        "Q: Did everything the factories make go to Germany?",
        "Q: So nothing was made...?",
        "Q: Their stuffing, I think, there...",
        "Q: The church was outside?",
        "Q: And that\u2019s exactly the place?",
        "Q: The feathers came from, what, from villages?",
        "Q: Everything went to Germany.",
        "Q: Did Bebof make a lot of money?",
        "Q: Venhem and Celia Greenburg, they gave these photographs to...",
        "Q: Is it a familiar name?",
        "Q: Do we have the originals of these?",
        "Q: No, just Xerox copies.",
        "Q: Yeah, where is it?",
        "Q: That\u2019s a paper I found.",
        "Q: They called it \u2018resort\u2019?",
        "Q: How do you spell it?",
        "Q: This one is Fol-fo-vich (ph).",
        "Q: This is Ibo-schitz (ph)?",
        "Q: In what?",
        "Q: Your a gold mine!",
        "Q: This is Ibo-schitz (ph)? The one with the mustache?",
        "Q: Would they be in the chronicle?",
        "Q: How many people survived from the Lodz ghetto?",
        "Q: Do you know the number?",
        "Q: Yesterday, you thought the numbers might be 20,000, is that just a guess?",
        "Q: If that was right, that would mean , the original , but who knows?",
        "Q: But nobody has a census?",
        "Q: This one?",
        "Q: okay. [Il learn how to recognize him now.",
        "Q: Your father lives in Israel, after...?",
        "Q: Now, I know how to recognize him now.",

        "Q: The same side, right on both sides?",
        "Q: This was one of the two photographers either Grossman or Rost that would go...?",
        "Q: That would go and, this was an assignment from like a public relations department or?",
        "Q: Of the gypsy transport?",
        "Q: And where did they get the film from? From the Germans?",
        "Q: And doing all the factories.",
        "Q: Have you seen this picture before?",
        "Q: What is his first name?",
        "Q: Would you like a copy of that?",
        "Q: Do you have any other pictures of him?",
        "Q: Now, most of Grossman\u2019s photographs were lost because his sister took it from Lodz and\nbrought it to Palestine at the time.",
        "Q: Yes. And she had it in Ka-butz-ya-no-ga-high (ph), which was taken by the Egyptians in during\nthe Independence War and they took the negatives from Ka-butz-ya-no-ga-high (ph) to Egypt and\nthen they published in Egyptian papers during the six days war actually showing that there are lines\nof people for bread and water and Stars of David.",

        "Q: But what I\u2019m wondering about 1s, is 1t because sometimes people don\u2019t want to talk. Other times\nthey want to talk and their waiting for someone to ask them a question.

        "Q: Right. Absolutely. Are you glad you did this?",
        "Q: But when I was asking you about whether you are glad you came here and talked about your, is\nit difficult to live with 1t because now we\u2019ve shaken up the glass?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: But does it become important to you even in light of that, that you were able to tell part of your\nstory? And that it is documented?",
        "Q: No, I didn\u2019t bring you here to defend yourselves. I brought you here to tell your story.",

        "Q: Right. But what I\u2019m saying 1s that in situations of, even not situations of distress. All kinds of\nsituations where people have some power, some authority. They can\u2019t do everything for everybody.",
        "Q: So, you cannot ever satisfy people.",

        "Q: Well it\u2019s not, I don\u2019t, it\u2019s sometimes more complicated than jealousy. Sometimes it\u2019s because\nyou don\u2019t have power yourself. And you have to rely on someone else. And that\u2019s not an easy,\nhuman situation.",
        "Q: Well this is different. We don\u2019t know what, you know.",
        "Q: You mean you think this 1s it?",
        "Q: Well, we'll see what Teresa comes up with.",
        "Q: Well, it\u2019s a very complicated set of circumstances. And it brings out the best and it brings out\nthe worst, right? I mean, I\u2019m sure you saw it there?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Now, do you want to go and see the permanent exhibition for a little bit or are you too tired?",

        "Q: I was just thinking about your temper and I was wondering if you thought that, in a way it\u2019s a\nstupid question. If you had every had to have dealings with the Germans that you actually could\nhave survived? Would you have been furious with them?",
        "Q: Because it\u2019s a conditional question, it has no reality. I was wondering that if you could have,\nremember we talked about your being a hot head?",
        "Q: And that with Rum-cof-ski (ph), you held your temper because he was also a hot head so it\nwould have been impossible.",
        "Q: And I was wondering if you had dealing with the Germans whether you could have, not that nice\nguy, but Bebof.",
        "Q: Right. Whether you could have kept your temper?",
        "Q: Did you every loose your temper? Either alone or with someone, I mean, out of frustration?",

        "Q: Yeah, but you learn a great deal from having, when a friend of mine did interviews with four or\nfive women who were in the hospital in Auschwitz...",

        "Q: No one has survived, no one 1s alive. So, it\u2019s a very special set of understanding that we can get\nfrom you. And to then have people who knew you, and also talk about their own lives and their\nrelationship with you, it simply makes the story, it\u2019s like talking with all members of the family not\njust with one member of the family.",

        "Q: From those 1942 transports?",
        "Q: As far as I know it was later. It was very late from Lodz to Auschwitz.",

        "Q: Did he ever write notes about what he was doing or was he ever interviewed, do you think, by\nanybody\u201d?",
        "Q: Right. But for that reason...",
        "Q: Then why do you think he went back to Germany? He lived in Germany after the war the whole\ntime?",

        "A: No. He was registered as a man who lived in Hannover.",
        "A: No, we were just all collected. Put into a concert hall and we lived there for a whole day until we\nwere transported to the station and into cattle cars.",
        "A: No. The Poles wouldn\u2019t let us in. We were in Normansland for forty-eight hours before they let\nus In.",
        "A: No. It was a boundary with wires and they didn\u2019t let us in. The Poles didn\u2019t want to let us in so\nwe had the SS standing on one side with the bayonets in our eyes, on the other side were the Poles\nwith bayonets on their rifles. But then, for some intervention, they opened up and let us into that\nsmall little village in As-bon-shee (ph).",
        "A: No, I wouldn\u2019t. Doesn\u2019t ring a bell.",

        "A: Very bright and very pleasant man.",
        "A: Well, his picture was in every office.",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t his order but it was like, you have here the President hanging everywhere so he was\nthe President so his picture was hanging everywhere.",
        "A: You must understand that the ghetto was an independent state with their own money, with their\nministers of all the departments and it was really a .",
        "A: But the Lodz ghetto was a model ghetto.",

        "A: I think that, Bebof (ph) had a crush on her.",
        "A: First of all, we weren\u2019t allowed to marry officially.",
        "A: And Jews weren\u2019t really allowed to marry so when you saw these people getting married like 19-\n20 couples with a handkerchief and it was an inside affair. Jews weren\u2019t suppose to have children\nOr...",
        "A: No, no, she, I know every time she had a meeting or something she was sick. She got ulcers.\nShe was so petrified. We knew she was scared but she would never tell us it. When we asked she\nnever said anything. Even after the worst. We wouldn\u2019t talk about it at all. But we saw that she\nwas scared and we saw her reaction. She would come from a meeting, she would lock herself in her\nroom and we didn\u2019t see her until the next day. She was boiling over and couldn\u2019t say anything,\ncouldn\u2019t do anything. She was afraid.",

        "A: And he spoke Yiddish to Dora too and she knew Yiddish well?",
        "A: But he could not speak Polish to us because we didn\u2019t speak Polish. We spoke English, my wife,\nI courted her in English. That was the only common language we had. So he spoke Yiddish.",
        "A: You know, when she talks I come to think about it. All the people, the liaisons that were\nworking around Dora, a few secretaries, they were all German speaking girls from Germany or from\nFrance.",
        "A: A-move-na (ph). What was the other one?",
        "A: Shift-ling-ger (ph). And then...",

        "A: They were fighting all the time I know. She was telling him off.",
        "A: She was holding her own. When she was against it, she was against it. She fought him.",
        "A: There was a lot of differences that they had and she spoke up, she wasn\u2019t afraid of him. You had\nto know Rum-cof-ski (ph), he admired somebody very feisty, somebody that gave him back and he\nadmired people like that. Especially women, he was a terrific womanizer, I don\u2019t know if you heard\nabout it, but he was.",
        "A: Yes he was. He was a widower and he was married and he was very active in this...",
        "A: I need that book again to identify him. This was Reingold (ph) he was a police...",
        "A: No, Reingold (ph) was, where they had food, he was in charge of that, Bert.",
        "A: Yes, but he wore a police uniform.",
        "A: Yes, he did.",
        "A: No. Police were everywhere. He was a commander, they called him Commander Reingold (ph).\nBut you find his biography or whatever in the chronicle of the Lodz ghettos. You find him. This is\nShane Shivik (ph). You find his also.",
        "A: Somebody screwed up here in this picture. They did screw up.",
        "A: Oh, I see him, I hear him talk. What\u2019s his name, Tula?",
        "A: What?",
        "A: Here is Rinegold (ph) again. Do you remember him? He was on the ;",
        "A: Oh, this is Lies-a-row-vich (ph). The two brothers Lies-a-row-vich (ph), he was in charge of\nbakeries. And he passed away in Los Angeles a few years ago. Everywhere they put Dora\u2019s name\nshe doesn\u2019t even figure in here. I know who that is. That is Dabby-dovich (ph), Dr. Klousenberg\u2019s\ndaughter.",
        "A: The hat! It\u2019s because of the hat.",
        "A: This is Mrs. Dabby-dovich (ph) was her name. She was married to an architect, but he wasn\u2019t\nwith her in the ghetto and she was the daughter of Dr. Klousenberg. She was the aristocracy of the\nghetto. She was a very lovely lady.",
        "A: Was a psychiatrist. The other one is his brother, younger brother.",
        "A: He wasn\u2019t, he was connected with the health department because I think he was in charge of the\nhospital.",
        "A: Until the last day. Until we left.",
        "A: So when we were there, they didn\u2019t have any doctors or anything. I\nremember where I was sleeping?",
        "A: Yes, 44,",
        "A: Outside in the corridor.",
        "A: In \u201844 we went into the hospital in September. Until then 1t was working as a hospital.",
        "A: When we came in the last transport there was nothing anymore.",
        "A: But the ghetto was finished basically at that time. But it was in full swing until September or\nAugust of 1944.",
        "A: Until they liquidated everybody out of the hospital.",
        "A: Excuse me, this is very important. He was a very important member of the family, Baa-roo-flas-\nker (ph). And it\u2019s not written either here and he\u2019s so physical here. He was a protege\u2019 of Rum-cof-\nski (ph). He survived and died in Israel a few years ago.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, they had some connections, I can\u2019t remember now. I knew it but I don\u2019t know. As\nI said, people that he knew Rum-cof-ski(ph) and people that supported his orphanage before the\nwar, when they came to the ghetto he was very generous to these people.",
        "A: I have no idea.",
        "A: No I don\u2019t.",
        "A: This is Rosenblatt, here. I don\u2019t know. As I told you, Joanne, I was very low, laying very low. I\ndidn\u2019t go anywhere, we didn\u2019t participate in anything. You won\u2019t see me on the picture anywhere\nbecause I didn\u2019t want to mix. And I told you that Rum-cof-ski (ph) wanted to send me with a\nbroom [responded in foreign language at this point].",
        "A: [Still answering in foreign language]. Excuse me, I don\u2019t want you to get so tired of me because\nI told you this a few times, but Rum-cof-ski (ph) said he\u2019s going to send me to clean the streets.",
        "A: Whoever was called to this meeting, you just didn\u2019t come in to Rum-cof-ski (ph), you couldn\u2019t\ncome in uninvited.",
        "A: This was when there was a deportation.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how it worked, Bertie. When there was, like for instance, they were taking people\naway. I don\u2019t know how it worked.",
        "A: Oh, the Chronicle ?",
        "A: They were collected there.",
        "A: They brought them to Mechelen, I think.",
        "A: Mechelen 1s by the city in the Trecin, 1n the prison.",
        "A: ,",
        "A: They had to make a list, yes.",
        "A: To the commission, the committee, the committee took it and then they took the people and\ngathered the people together.",
        "A: No, I think that they went through the list.",
        "A: They went through the list and there was always somebody who was taken out or it was put back\nin or added to it. It all depends.",
        "A: Because I remember . They took him too, remember? And then they let him go.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. I always finagled somehow to get out of it and She-nis-kee (ph) took care of it. I must say I\nhave sometimes people that took them out like a friend of Irene, you know?",
        "A: I just took him out, I just let him go. I told the people to let him go. I told the people, listen I had\nsome weight, I carried some weight in the ghetto so if I go there and I said, release him, they had no\nchoice but to release him.",
        "A: I would tell, Eisman, not Eisman, who was in charge of this thing? It must be in the book there.\nI would call him and would say, let him out.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, you have to understand. The first transport as I mentioned in my interview were the three\n\u201cF\u2019s\u201d, the Flesch-man (ph), the For-man (ph) and the Fisherman (ph). These three categories of\npeople were sent by order of Rum-cof-ski (ph) as the first transport to go to work. And most of\nthem survived because they were characters who are...",
        "A: No, it went on all the time. It was just specifically in Winter, you had in Winter transport, yet in\nSummer transport. I saw in Spring and Fall, however, there were a lot of volunteers, don\u2019t forget\nwho voluntarily registered themselves to be sent out to a working camp as has been told.",
        "A: Yes, and there was this young, attractive woman, Alla Kol-a-nos-ka (ph), she went\nhere and then she came back to the ghetto, she survived. She lives now in Fairlong\nand her married name is now Mee-gees (ph), she married Lola\u2019s brother.",
        "A: And I remember one girl volunteered, went out, came back and went out again. I forgot her\nname, a blond girl, I can see her.",
        "A: Alla Ko-la-nos-ka (ph) was her name. She was the sister of , you know, of a young\ndancer. She married ;",
        "A: Yako-stoputzki (ph) and Yatsek Denser (ph), they survived. They live Miami Beach.",
        "A: There are a few, there was a big family who survived like five brothers, they all survived.",
        "A: But I know the fellows, what was his name? Brow-may-kee (ph) was the one that saved my life,\nI told you he brought me to the Mechelen, he was one of them.",
        "A: You cannot tell.",
        "A: In general I can tell you.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: When they came in. When they left they didn\u2019t have any tags. The didn\u2019t have any tags, when\nthey came in they had tags.",
        "A: Came in.",
        "A: They were all people.",
        "A: Not necessarily.",
        "A: They were people and Viennese people, very well dressed people, everywhere...",
        "A: Well, we had people from Austria, we had people from Czechoslovakia but also from the small,\nlittle villages and towns around Lodz. Pab-nein-leet-sa (ph) and...",
        "A: This was in the beginning, right in the beginning.",
        "A: Was until \u201842. We had people coming into Lodz.",
        "A: This I didn\u2019t know. You know, when we went there...",
        "A: No, they also came in \u201842.",
        "A: The Gay-sphel (ph)? Well, it was a poster that we had posted all over the ghettos that from this\nand this date, from this and this time nobody\u2019s allowed to be on the street. And the reason for it was\nthat they wanted to have an easy job going to the houses and collect whom they wanted to collect.",
        "A: No, they always came in.",
        "A: They never asked our permission.",
        "A: You see, Na-ba-loskie (ph) is where you had the central office, okay? You had the ghetto far-va-\ndoonk (ph) which was Bebof (ph) and cohorts and you had our people, Rum-cof-ski (ph) and Aaron\nYakovobitch had his office there and from there everything was, that was the central point of all the\nactivities within the ghetto. And what the transports are concerned they went on until actually even\nin \u201843, we still got transports into the ghetto. They called people and brought them in the ghetto.\nThey brought some people, put them in the cemetery and shot them. And they hung people and\nthey shot them, but it was outside, not within. Within we had also shootings, like for instance, in the\nKrim-a-nall Po-da-sigh (ph), Gooby Oben-stein-er (ph) who was the big shot there was sitting,\nwhen he was drunk he was sitting at the window and there was like a sniper, shooting. Whether he\nkilled someone or not, he just started to shoot, that\u2019s all.",
        "A: Well, whatever I can help you with we are here.",
        "A: The ghetto police had to go with them in all actions. They were forced to. In other words, the\nSS would come in with trucks and the Jewish police had to work with them.",
        "A: Because they had to interpret.",
        "A: The Germans, when the transport went out, you wouldn\u2019t see them but you would see them at\nthe tracks. There they would be. They would do the loading into the cattle cars. So you would not\nsee any escorts at Rather-gorch (ph). You would not see them on the way to Rather-gorch (ph).\nThere you would see only our own police.",
        "A: Well, this leaves yourself to various interpretations. Because normally when you come into a\ncamp you had to get rid of everything, or your clothing and you get fresh clothing.",
        "A: You know what happened?",
        "A: All right.",
        "A: I will tell you what happened. My sister-in-law, my brother\u2019s widow, she built Auschwitz. She\nlived in Ka-to-beet-sa (ph), it\u2019s very close to Auschwitz, and they grabbed her, she was 14 years old.\nHer family was shot, everybody of her family was shot. She was left 14 years, a girl before the war\nin Europe was very sheltered. And she was taken to Auschwitz, they were building the barracks at\nthat time, she told us. And then, they put her to the Prin-ya (ph), laundry. Every piece of Jewish\nclothing was checked out and you wouldn\u2019t believe the stuff that they found in this, in buttons,\ndiamonds, there was a lot of dollars and paper money was found and some people, when they were\nin Auschwitz they collected it, they had connections and when they came out after the war they\nhad...",
        "A: I am talking about Auschwitz. I don\u2019t know the distinction between Bruckenau and Auschwitz, I\nknow this was the center of point when people heard this.",
        "A: We know that Bruckenau was where the crematoriums and where the gassing took place. Not in\nAuschwitz but in Bruckenau.",
        "A: [Inaudible] We were in Auschwitz. We were a few years ago, three years ago. We went, we\ntook a pilgrimage to Auschwitz.",
        "A: The working camp was Auschwitz and the final solution took place in Bruckenau.",
        "A: Yes. I got married 1n order to survive. Not to him, I was married for three months and later on I\ngota . He was my father\u2019s age, or maybe a little bit older, but my parents told me I was...",
        "A: He was a Jew. [inaudible]",
        "A: The police. We call them the OD man. ;",
        "A: And this is why I wanted to run away, but my parents, the factory was still going full swing and\nmy mother was telling me in the First World War they were having a paradise in Poland. They\nwere working for the Kaiser you know and they were making money and they didn\u2019t want to, my\nmother didn\u2019t want to leave. My father wanted to leave. And then, my mother said to me, your\ngoing away and we are left behind. This is when I changed my mind.",
        "A: Because I would have somebody to take care of me. I was a spoiled young girl.",
        "A: A lot of them fled and went to Russia.",
        "A: They could get out, some of them.",
        "A: Before and after. If you realize, people smuggled them out but most of them, most of the, they\nfled in \u201839 when the war broke out.",
        "A: They survived in Russia.",
        "A: Then they fled, okay? And went East. And they wound up and they survived in Siberia.",
        "A: I bet you know that in Poland the family ties were very close so you couldn\u2019t do anything. You\nwould live all your life with a guilt complex. It\u2019s true! You couldn\u2019t just do whatever was good for\nyou.",
        "A: Yes, everybody has long stories to tell.",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t. I had a big package. I had my parents and my brother and my aunts and my uncles\nand the whole families. We didn\u2019t live for ourselves, we shared our lives.",
        "A: Of course, we had a lot of jewelry. But we exchanged it for the last supper before they took us\naway. We gave away to a person that is alive, I don\u2019t know if you heard about She-mek-fel-don\n(ph). He was working the with the Germans and he had connections.",
        "A: He exchanged it and he brought us the food and he was left to clean the ghetto also.",
        "A: No, it was close to thousands in the ghetto to clean. Officially I think it was 800 but there were a\nlot of people hidden. And he sort of with the whole family, a few brothers and his sister and\nparents. And after the war they went to Israel. He\u2019s now in Sal-o Pal-o (ph).",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "A: My mother. My father was killed three days after the initial civil war. 3rd of May. He was on\nthe march and he couldn\u2019t walk. He was with my brother, so they shot him and we tried to find out\nwhere, what. We never found anything.\n. I think she wants to take information now about the artifacts which I think will be an\ninteresting experience.",
        "A: Who get\u2019s this, ah...?",
        "A: So should I give it to her now?",
        "A: I wanted you to know that it\u2019s our most private possession. It survived everything.",
        "A: This is how this survived. In a casing in, also the violin, that somebody else had it. This is a\ncalendar, the last calendar of the ghetto. With Rum-cof-ski (ph) on the front page. This is the way I\ngot it and this is the way I put it, I don\u2019t know what made me put this away instead of jewelry. I\ndidn\u2019t put any jewelry in the case.",
        "A: Let me see. I never looked inside.",
        "A: You told me, but I never opened it.",
        "A: Yeah, it was done outside ,",
        "A: That has to be polished, I didn\u2019t have a chance to polish it.",

        "A: They are sick of us, I know!",
        "A: My husband has. We gave it to our grandson, a violin. So we took, we take the lining of the\nviolin, it was a lining and he opened the lining and put in this two, the watch I had and the budda.\nThe budda was in it. I put a little china budda that my father gave to my mother. And this was my\nmascot. Where ever I went I had it with me. And we put this in the lining, it survived. And I have\nit at home. One day you will see it.",

It\u2019s a medication that stops\nbleeding and we didn\u2019t have it in the ghetto and these people that I mentions to this lady before they\nhad connections. They were smuggling, so I went to him, he\u2019s alive, he\u2019s in Miami, and I told him\nwhat I needed. He got it for me, he was a good friend of mine, and my cousin, her father was my\nfather\u2019s partner in the business, wanted to give me a lot of diamonds.

        "A: Or for the gold.",
        "A: After the war, after the liberation, we got that from my brother-in-law.",
        "A: We were in Hannover.",
        "A: Yes.",

I was half asleep and I went and opened the door and he said, I heard\non the radio that your sister is looking for you and I answered it, and I took him and almost killed\nhim. I said, don\u2019t make such a joke, take me out of sleep, so he went on his knees and said,\neverything that is holy, I am telling the truth! Sure enough, about ten days later she came.",

        "A: No, just what the conditions were. What I could do to improve it or when I criticize. I had quite\na task. I pulled quite some weight in that sense because even if he was a director of the factory he\nstill had to, if I said something, it was that word. It had to be done. And on the other end I also\npatted him on the shoulder if he did something well so 1t went both ways. Yes, I did go around. But\nI always had one with me, one of my OD men.",

        "A: What do you mean? He never came back to the ghetto.",
        "A: Who? David Giertler (ph)?",
        "A: Yes. He never came back. When they took him, he went to Auschwitz and all his guards was\nwaiting for him.",
        "A: They took him once and he came back.",
        "A: Yeah, but the second time when they took him, he did come back. And after the war, we found\nout he\u2019s alive so we went to Munich to visit him. He was doing great.",
        "A: He told us everything we know because we didn\u2019t circulate. We were very withdrawn, Bert had\nenough with his job when he came to, when we came after work we were so exhausted. Life was\ntough.",
        "A: Yeah. He saw everything. He took all their Auschwitz when he came, he had a lot of, they\ncalled him \u201cBee-alg-da-varta\u201d (ph), \u201cThe White Brigade\u201d. Because they were the people that\nwere...",
        "A: This was Rum-cof-ski\u2019s (ph) wife.",
        "A: No way, Bertie. This was Mrs. Dabby-dovich (ph). Rum-cof-ski\u2019s (ph) wife doesn\u2019t figure\nanywhere else.",
        "A: Josef, not Heim.",
        "A: I know! This is Heim\u2019s wife.",
        "A: This was...",
        "A: No, this was Dabby-dovich (ph), Bert. I don\u2019t see Joseph Rum-cof-ski\u2019s (ph) wife anywhere.\nAnd here, I made the sign that there was something wrong here...",

        "A: This is Mrs. Dabby-dovich(ph).",
        "A: Josef Rum-cof-ski\u2019s (ph) wife.",
        "A: Well, maybe you are right. But this is the same, what did they write here? They should know if\nthis was his wife.",

        "A: I don\u2019t think so.",
        "A: Yes, oh yes.",
        "A: Very much so. I will tell you, every holiday like Rush-sha-shana (ph), the New Year, he would\nsend us a gift that the kids made. They use to make beautiful baskets, handiwork, beautiful stuff\nthey learned in the orphanage and every contributor, everybody supporting him and all his friends\nhe sent gifts that the kids made.",

        "A: Yeah, his younger brother.",
        "A: He was in charge of the health department of the hospital. Wasn\u2019t he the chief of the hospital in\nNwad-ya-gin-skie (ph)?",
        "A: I think so.",
        "A: Stefan would know, Bertie.",
        "A: Never heard it.",
        "A: No, the first time I saw...",

        "A: He came to us and spent a whole Sunday with us.",
        "A: Oh, I thought you were talking about the Lodz ghetto, the Chronicle. No I didn\u2019t know about a\nbook written in the ghetto.",
        "A: Every activity was posted.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I never heard or saw it. I thought it was Dubra-shizkies (ph) book. This I have at\nhome.",
        "A: This is Rabbi Fine.",
        "A: This is very important because he was a wonderful guy, this Rabbi.",
        "A: Shick-a (ph).",
        "A: Throw up the boards, the rods, because they had from all walks of life people from every,\ndoctors and the Rabbi was here.",

        "A: And there\u2019s Josef again.",
        "A: No. There were so many people.",
        "A: As I said, if you could go to Israel and Tel Aviv there are people that lived together with Rum-\ncof-ski (ph). Dr. Vee-der (ph), he\u2019s still alive, Dr. Kin-la-roos (ph) is the head of the Survivor\u2019s...",
        "A: This is not Bebof (ph). It says here that he talks with Bebof (ph), that\u2019s not Bebof (ph). Sorry.",
        "A: Bebof (ph) was a handsome man.",
        "A: Yes. We identified that yesterday. Yeah, they are identified. Getler (ph) is identified,\nYakovobitch (ph)...[named many inaudible names]",
        "A: And this was that policeman, I forgot his name.",
        "A: He was a very quiet...",
        "A: A very nice boy.",
        "A: We were the last transport.",
        "A: They were one transport before us.",
        "A: We were suppose to be going to Auschwitz but somehow they turned around and I went to\nRegensburg and he went to Reichshof.",
        "A: No. We went to Sachsenhausen Regensburg.",
        "A: Directly.",
        "A: Yes, so they let the men go.",
        "A: Yes, we were separated. All men out.",
        "A: Yes, but I don\u2019t know how we know it because everything was rumors.",
        "A: [Inaudible]...and she was with me at the table to be interviewed. And they were talking about\nwhat she said to for instance. Why couldn\u2019t they do in Lodz the same as in Warsaw,\nthe uprising. So I said I\u2019m sorry you are complaining.",
        "A: Yeah, she was obnoxious anyhow.",
        "A: I said first of all the people in Warsaw ghettos they had with the outside. So they were\nable to exchange something for weapons and ammunition. We had absolutely no contact with the\noutside world. We were absolutely isolated and what could we do? To fight the Germans with bare\nfingers? It would have been suicide!",
        "A: Yeah, but I mean, she said it in front of the camera.",
        "A: She was so arrogant. She said something that I was very, very up in arms, what was it? And this\nyoung editor from the For-vert (ph)...",
        "A: There was a Jonathon Rosen. So, he asked me, tell us what or how did you feel at that time\nwhen you had to collaborate with the Germans?",
        "A: I could have killed him.",
        "A: So I told him, we had to work to eat and if Rum-cof-ski (ph) would have been not able to\nnegotiate with the Germans, to give us materials, raw materials, and we would manufacture and\nwould deliver the completed goods to them in exchange for money and food. Whatever we needed\nin the ghetto and if he would have been successful in that negotiation the Lodz cater (ph) would\nhave been liquidated in 1943 completely.",
        "A: 1942 already...",
        "A: In 1942, I\u2019m sorry. I meant \u201842. Completely. No body would have left at that time alive. They\nwould have had to find a solution at that time.",
        "A: There was a young man, an editor of the For-vitz (ph), Jonathon Rosen. Very lovely young man.\nSo he said, who are we to judge if we didn\u2019t live there?",
        "A: And everybody had their individual experiences so who are we to tell them or to judge of what\nwas good and what was bad.",
        "A: No. We didn\u2019t have any knowledge of that.",
        "A: We found out after the war. We didn\u2019t know it.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t even know that there exists other ghettos in Warsaw.",
        "A: No. Because all from this, from the little villages and surrounding towns, they sent it into the\nLodz ghetto. What was the two brothers that came from the Warsaw ghetto to us?",
        "A: Cone (ph).",
        "A: The brothers Cone (ph). They came from Warsaw to the Lodz ghetto and they told us about the\nWarsaw ghetto.",
        "A: And this is when we found out. This was towards the end. And she could tell them, one of the\ndaughters is alive in Fairlong, New Jersey.",
        "A: Closed.",
        "A: Who knew that they would annex the Lodz city...?",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry. I have to butt in because I lived through it. My father, when the Germans started to\ninvade, to come into Lodz, my father and my brother went to Warsaw because every patriotic Pole\nwent to defend the City of Warsaw. And my father came back must be a week later, his feet were\nbleeding and he looked, he was a shadow of a person, they tried to walk towards Warsaw.\nEnd of Tape 2.\nTape 3",
        "A: We were privileged. We were definitely privileged 1n the last transport.",
        "A: You were only around 300 people?",
        "A: Because they were already...",
        "A: There were a few young doctors, a few doctors and people that use to work close in the\nadministration.",
        "A: At that time we did not know that already are other people like Alan Yakovobitch (ph) knew that\nwe would not be staying in Sachsenhausen. That we will be going somewhere else to work, in other\nwords, it\u2019s like slaves, like going into slave labor, okay? But we didn\u2019t know that, only when we\ncame to Sachsenhausen we were told we are not staying here. After two weeks we went to Kern-es-\nwoo-sen-hausen (ph) because the barracks were not ready. But in the meantime when we came in\nthey were just about ready to be occupied. And then we got the straw mattresses and stuff like this.",
        "A: Wasn\u2019t Stefan Vee-ter (ph) with you?",
        "A: Sure he was with me.",
        "A: Was he working in his profession there or what?",
        "A: He was a doctor, but...",
        "A: This is the Dr. Vee-ter (ph) I told you lives in Tel Aviv. He was with him on the transport.",
        "A: He was with us and there was another doctor with us and he was also on the circus saw and he\nlost...",
        "A: Oh, I know who it was. Dr. Tennenbaum.",
        "A: Tennenbaum. He lost three fingers. He also was the same as what I did with these big plywood\nplates on a circus saw. And he did the same thing and he got his hand too close, the right hand, got\nto close to the circus saw and cut off three fingers. And he was a surgeon! So afterwards he could\nnot operate anymore because he had lost those three fingers on his right hand.",
        "A: Which transport?",
        "A: Well, until we came to Sachsenhausen we were together with our women in the cattle cars.",
        "A: Cattle cars, strangers, I don\u2019t know how many people in one, couldn\u2019t sit down.",
        "A: Everybody knows already how the transport took us 1n the cattle cars.",
        "A: No, not everybody, no. I don\u2019t know how many people but I know we couldn\u2019t sit down.",
        "A: Wall to wall. Shoulder on shoulder.",
        "A: I know they put with us a pail. You had to do something in front of everybody, you did it,\nstrangers. Men and women.",
        "A: It was a long trip.",
        "A: I think it was a day and a night.",
        "A: I think it was more like two days and we didn\u2019t have windows to look out.",
        "A: I think two days and one night, something like this. And then the train stopped. All men out!",
        "A: I will never forget this moment, this was the worst moment in my life.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t even say good-bye to her.",
        "A: Here was my father...",
        "A: My father, her father, her brother...",
        "A: My brother! He left the train when they took them out of the train, he never looked back. He\nnever said good-bye to me, he never looked. This picture...",
        "A: Iremember! I didn\u2019t want to say good-bye because I didn\u2019t want to break down. I had to be\nstrong. I knew I had to be strong.",
        "A: [had to be strong because...",
        "A: We separated, that was all we knew.",
        "A: This was the only possibility because we were separated. We were only married...",
        "A: Few months.",
        "A: No, we were married...",
        "A: We married in \u201843 Bert and this was \u201844.",
        "A: Yes, we married in June and this was \u201844...",
        "A: About a year later.",
        "A: Yes, a little over a year. So we basically were still on our honeymoon. If you can call that, you\nknow. First of all, I was frustrated. Not knowing what happened next, okay? And second of all, I\ndidn\u2019t want to see that I had tears in my eyes, I didn\u2019t want her to see that, so I just left out with the\ntransport.",
        "A: And this is when I saw the last time my father.",
        "A: And we lost her father because...",
        "A: He was about 40 years, not even 40 years old.",
        "A: And I was met at Alan Yakovobitch (ph) because he was the numbero uno on this transport.\nAnd one day, I was told to go outside, the outside commando, because they were always building\ntank traps because the Hitler youth comes always with the tanks over there were shooting against\nthe Russian over our camp. One day, later on, I realized why he had sent me out. Because when I\ncame back late that afternoon seventy people had left.",
        "A: My brother and my father.",
        "A: From our camp and amongst them her father and her brother. They were amongst the seventy\nthat were sent out and Alan Yakovobitch (ph) knew that if I would be in the camp I would never let\nthem go because I would have told them that if they go, I go too.",
        "A: But he liked you and he wouldn\u2019t...",
        "A: Well, he was like family because my sister was married, well, no, they were not married, but\nthey went together, they were a pair. So, they were very close to each other. Aaron was ever close\nto Dora anyhow.",
        "A: No, they were married after the war.",
        "A: They married in \u201845.",
        "A: But he knew, Aaron knew, that I would never, ever have allowed my father-in-law and brother-\nin-law to go.",
        "A: They went on a march to the North Sea to be put on a boat and bound out. It\u2019s Final Solution.\nAnd he couldn\u2019t walk anymore. So they shot him, all right? Was on May the 3rd, while my brother\nwas able to escape.",
        "A: They told my brother, too, run for his life, not to hang around. And my brother survived.",
        "A: Since then, I was very, very mad. And as you say in Turkish, broy-gus-with-in (ph).",
        "A: But we are in touch with his son, would you believe it?",
        "A: His son called me. They lived in Brooklyn and he called me at that time to tell me that his father\nhad passed away.",
        "A: And he wanted us to go to the funeral.",
        "A: And were we in Scranton or were we already in...",
        "A: We were in Connecticut and the next thing we left for Europe.",
        "A: I had to leave for Europe so I told him, I\u2019m sorry I cannot come to the funeral. And every\nChristmas I get a post card...",
        "A: Not a post card a regular letter!",
        "A: Yeah, with their family printed on it with a long letter of what had transpired during the year of\nwhat they had done and what they had accomplished and where they go.",
        "A: He didn\u2019t ask forgiveness, no.",
        "A: No, this young man, it wasn\u2019t his fault. He\u2019s not responsible for his father.",
        "A: I absolutely, absolutely. He sent me out that day because he knew that I would never allow my\nfather-in-law and brother-in-law to leave!",
        "A: He must have known because he was in touch with the German camp, with the Germans.",
        "A: Sure! On the . Absolutely. Even very close, I must say.",
        "A: Oh, sure, sure!",
        "A: He would know because, as I mentioned to you, Zi-fed (ph) from the ghetto Fuf-eitel (ph), he\nwas also with us in Kernet-woo-sure-hausen (ph), in that factory. As a German .\nAnd they were very close and I was very close with Zi-fed (ph). He was a nice guy. But, he did not\nknow that that was my father or my brother-in-law.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: But he didn\u2019t have to protect me. Because I was working and I was, you know.",
        "A: So was David and Dad.",
        "A: Yes, but I mean, I was working inside the factory on a circus saw. And this day I was told to go\naway, Okay? And then later on it happened that I got the rifle in my back, that I told you, on one of\nthese outside commandos.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It was frustration. You were so embarrassed, you know.",
        "A: You tried to comfort each other for once. Saying to all, what will happen to us? Where will we\ngo?",
        "A: We had to accommodate ourselves because you have to get along in this place.",
        "A: And you were actually occupied with yourself.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know what to think.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know. The possibility existed everyday.",
        "A: We were sure that...",
        "A: The train was stopped by the, bombs were falling. So we could have died right there. Not from\nthe German end but from the Allied bombs. So, we didn\u2019t know whether we would survive or not.",
        "A: They told us were are going to be working.",
        "A: But they told us we were going into...",
        "A: No, no, we doubted it. We didn\u2019t know what to believe.",
        "A: No!",
        "A: No, because nobody knew!",
        "A: That was one part. In another part, that I was Dora\u2019s brother. This definitely was a privileged.",
        "A: We got a little bit extra, yes.",
        "A: When we were getting, I told you, the of food, it was a small portion of meat, but Bert\nsent it to my parents. We never saw a thing of it! My father looked like a skeleton.",
        "A: And he was a tall man.",
        "A: Over six feet tall, six-four.",
        "A: Tall and, he needed it, definitely more than I did.",
        "A: Thad my barber.",
        "A: Everybody had this, this fellow, this barber, he made the rounds.",
        "A: He went, he went, he had quite...",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "A: To all, I wouldn\u2019t say, but he had quite the amount of privileged people to go around and shave\nand cut their hair.",
        "A: You couldn\u2019t shave yourself. You went to the barber to be shaved.",
        "A: I went everyday to the barber.",
        "A: No, no. Before, I am talking about the general life without, I am not talking about the ghetto.",
        "A: Everyone went to a barber.",
        "A: Yeah. They couldn\u2019t do it, cut their hair. They went to the barber everyday to shave.",
        "A: When father had this after we came back, we had a barber come here. Father and I\nto shave us.",
        "A: No, no, no. But he had this circle of people around him.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I don\u2019t even know.",
        "A: You know, I couldn\u2019t even answer that question because I really don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have a hairdresser, I can assure you! We didn\u2019t take advantage...",
        "A: No. In ghetto, I had long hair.",
        "A: You started off with short hair, like now.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I shaved. This is what happened. After we left the ghetto, I had the shorter hair than you, very\ncrew cut. This is why they didn\u2019t actually...",
        "A: I forgot to mention to you. I was honored by the SS in the camp. The little caps we wore, the\ncappies, right? And every time we passed a German...",
        "A: You had to salute him!",
        "A: We had to take our cappies off. And this guy, he was one who was in charge of us, so called,\nokay? And he liked the way I saluted him when I took off the cap. So he took me out, turned me\naround so I faced our people and he said, show them how to salute! So I took my cap off, and he\nsaid, that\u2019s the way you have to do it! And he allowed me to let my hair grow.",
        "A: No, he was bald like now.",
        "A: My twenty-two and a half hair, I had, you couldn\u2019t know if I had a haircut or not because there\nwas nothing left. So he allowed me to have my hair cut, that was my reward.",
        "A: Not cut! Everybody had shaved their hair off.",
        "A: Inthe camp. They didn\u2019t want to have the lice growing all over the place.",
        "A: And I was allowed to let my hair grow because I knew how to salute him.",
        "A: Yeah, there were funny moments too.",
        "A: Almost every morning.",
        "A: No, not all of them.",
        "A: The ones who are very important to me.",
        "A: Bel-laf-sky (ph) was one. Then that girl from Hamburg. The German girl.",
        "A: Would you believe my governess was working for him? She was with us for the...",
        "A: Sorry, Darling, I don\u2019t remember their names.",
        "A: Whatever was, had to be done.",
        "A: Like a program. There were different occasions which I couldn\u2019t tell you the details, no. But,\nthere was always something which we had to do. They had to report to me.",
        "A: There were so many factories, resorts they called them.",
        "A: They had to give a report of what they did and how it was done and so on. There was always\nsomething going on.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: The cleanliness. The way, their conditions at the working places.",
        "A: He would go to the kitchen and try the food. If they don\u2019t cheat, the workers of the food.",
        "A: I would go to the kitchen and look at the soup, which the workers would receive, okay? Then I\nwould make my comments, whether it was good or not good or whether there 1s somebody and if I\nfound somebody, he was finished with the kitchen.",
        "A: They were stealing.",
        "A: And we went to the factory, all right? And somebody from the factory needing a little bit repair,\nwould send in his place to the kitchen.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I was called and I was told to organize the department of labor because all people had to be\nregistered to receive an ID card and without the ID card, nobody would get the food coupons.",
        "A: That was when I came into the ghetto.",
        "A: I have the papers still. Little pieces of paper when he was nominated to start the department.\nYou want it? I have the original. It was lying 1n the little calendar.",
        "A: Yes. That was 1940. And I interviewed a lot of people for the job, for the office.",
        "A: I went with David to you, too, and I was staying in line with Dr. Kin-ee-roos (ph), he took me to\nyou.",
        "A: Well, in any case, to answer your question, I wasn\u2019t nominated to organize and run the\ndepartment of labor, which I did.",
        "A: Later on. Not originally.",
        "A: No, no, Shin-nit-skie (ph) was with me the whole time until the end and we got in 1943 from\nCzechoslovakia a transport was...",
        "A: Andres was his name.",
        "A: A 100% gentleman.",
        "A: Professor Cas-par-ee (ph) was, this is a proverb.",
        "A: He was a micro-biologist.",
        "A: And he wanted the favor of Rum-cof-sky (ph) and he was given to my office to be the third man.",
        "A: No, it was Andres, A-N-D-R E-S. And he was with me also until the end.",
        "A: With Andres I shared the office. Shin-nit-skie (ph) had his own office. But I put Andres in my\noffice.",
        "A: Yes, oh yes.",
        "A: Yes. To Rum-cof-ski (ph). Directly to him.",
        "A: Well, naturally, but in general he was satisfied with the way I handled it because in the beginning\nsince it had to be organized we were three days and three nights, I got maybe two or three hours\nsleep, because I want to be with the people. I have to work sixteen and eighteen hours and then I let\nthem go and I meet them, somebody else would work, so we registered day and night. Three days\nand three nights.",
        "A: Yes, stood in line.",
        "A: There were crowds of people.",
        "A: Sure. It was like a ken-car-ta (ph) and this ken-car-ta (ph) they were getting their rations every\nweek.",
        "A: The ID they get later on from the archives, from Shun-dul-dom (ph), no, from Nef-tall-en (ph)\nwho was in charge of it too, for ID cards. So he made out the ID cards afterwards but the people\nhad to be delegated to the various factories.",
        "A: No, they were in the process of setting up. And we had to select the people to go there.",
        "A: Well, they gave me a demand. I can take now twenty, I can take now fifty, I can take now a\nhundred, I can take now five. So, whatever the demand was.",
        "A: He\u2019s head of the workers or the factory...",
        "A: They had to come to me and tell me of what they wanted.",
        "A: A paper assault, we can have a hundred people working there.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It took me about 10 days, if I remember right.",
        "A: Yeah, to organize my office.",
        "A: 1940, yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: There was no choice, they were assigned to where ever there was an opening and if they fit in,\nyou had to know something.",
        "A: You see, don\u2019t forget that a lot of people volunteered to go out of the ghetto. Forty-one, forty-\ntwo, their still volunteers. And then came the demands. We want 1500 people, we want 1000\npeople, whatever. And then, where were the people? Everybody had to work so naturally we had\ngiven, like old people, I had made out maybe 500 or 600 papers to go to the straw resort, for\ninstance. They were sitting there, there was nothing to do because there was that much work and\nthat much places but people had, that they were delegated to the straw aut-tie-lum (ph) where we\nhad old people, sick people. I must have made a few thousand people like this, you know. So, to\nanswer your question, it took me about ten days to organize the staff and I added as we went along\nand naturally after we were not through with the registries because, but three days and three nights it\ntook to get the bulk into paperwork so they could get to the kitchen to get some food or get some, or\nwhere ever the food was distributed.",
        "A: Yes. You cannot image what it was like.",
        "A: Oh no, it was more.",
        "A: When the ghetto was closed we had over 200,000.",
        "A: Over 200,000, almost a quarter of a million people we had in the ghetto.",
        "A: But then, very shortly the first transport was organized. Where the rough element was sent out\nfirst. And then a lot of volunteers came to be out of the ghetto.",
        "A: By what do you mean, very poor people? Everybody was poor!",
        "A: But they had to give everything away. There was a special place. Jewelry first...",
        "A: No, no, you are absolutely right. Some people came in with some valuables. Then they started\nlater on if they needed, and everybody was trading some valuables for food.",
        "A: Bertie, we didn\u2019t turn in our jewelry until the last day.",
        "A: That\u2019s what I just said. That everybody who had something could bring it in because nobody,\nthey didn\u2019t have to undress, like when they went to the camp in Auschwitz, they had to completely\nstrip and everything was taken away from them. So, naturally, people came into the ghetto with\nwhatever valuables they had. But they did not hide.",
        "A: Absolutely. Most of them. Because let\u2019s not forget that there were a lot of poor Jews in Poland.",
        "A: Vulnerable in what sense?",
        "A: No. They were better equipped to withstand these environments than the higher class of people\nbecause they were poor people. They were always in need for something so they could adjust to\nthese bad circumstances and conditions much easier than like, people like my father-in-law who\nwas a very affluent man. He had everything he wanted because he was a big owner of a big factory,\nokay? So naturally, he suffered much, much more and had much more trouble adjusting to these\nconditions than the guy who was poor.",
        "A: When you see the picture from my wedding, he looked like a skeleton.",
        "A: So also, on the survivor list, when you look at the survivors today, I would say that about 80% of\nthe surviving class were poor people.",
        "A: Bert, be careful.",
        "A: Today, if you talk to them, everybody was a big man with their factories and had a big working\nstaff for themselves and everybody was rich and we know that they were eaten up by the lice. So\nyou find that the element, or the class of people who were in that conditions before the war adjusted\neasier to the bad conditions in the ghetto than the better class of people, if we want to classify them.",
        "A: The hardest thing I had to do? That is a tough question.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, the demands which were set forth to the , to the department of labor, which I could\nnot combine with any of my philosophy and my characters. And when we actually were forced to\nsupport the committee who had to make lists of deportations, I just couldn\u2019t digest that. And that\u2019s\nwhy, also with the influence of Irene, that I finagled myself out of that and let my other partner do\nthis job. That was the time I would not, I would have loved to get out of it, out of the position I was\nin.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Iam sure such conditions, such conferences and discussion took place.",
        "A: Certain occasions, yes. We could discuss personal things and personal ideas.",
        "A: When the Rabbi came, he was playing chess with the Rabbi. It was then that they had some\ndiscussions. Because Bert had a dilemma you know. There was a lot of nepotism going on, there\nwas a lot of, like, my own cousin. They came in, they wanted to bribe you and Bert would take\nthem by the neck and throw them out. He was the heavy one. But he just couldn\u2019t believe that you\ncould put a price on a human life.",
        "A: Various things of what his experiences because he had much more contact with the people than I\nhad. To him they came with all their complaints and all their headaches and conditions while they\ndid not have, my door was not open to the general population because they had to go through\nvarious instances before they could come to my office. You could not just walk into my office\nbecause otherwise I would have never been able to do anything.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: Well, I must say thank heaven that I never had anything to deal with the Germans. My dealing\nwas directly with Rum-cof-ski (ph).",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t think of anything they asked us to do what they should do because they just...",
        "A: For themselves, for them personally?",
        "A: Well, that was the purpose of our existence in the ghetto.",
        "A: Of our survival.",
        "A: We survived because of that.",
        "A: No, we were just doing what was in that condition, we were put in that condition by the elders of\nthe Jew in prolonging our lives by working for them. This doesn\u2019t make any near collaboration.",
        "A: The Germans did not put any demands on myself.",
        "A: The put demands on their own...",
        "A: They put demands on the ghetto. And the spokesman was Rum-cof-ski (ph). Rum-cof-ski (ph)\nand Yakovobitch (ph), these two people. These two people were the liaison people between the\nghetto and the German ghetto fo-vert (ph). They got the demands and they had to give the orders on\ndown to the other people of what has to be done.",
        "A: They did it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: First they did. First they said. And if the demand was not met, then they came in and did it\nthemselves.",
        "A: Yes. The result was that they did it themselves.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, and they had to be healthy people and they had to be examined by the doctors, you know,\nthat they are healthy.",
        "A: Right. And they did, they did.",
        "A: Bert did not refuse.",
        "A: Your talking about Bert, he didn\u2019t refuse, he just manipulated Rum-cof-ski (ph) because he was\nsick. He couldn\u2019t go sick...",
        "A: okay.",
        "A: No, because, are you talking about Lut-sek (ph) in Lut-sek\u2019s (ph) book, Dr. W. Lut-sek-ies (ph)?",
        "A: No, he collected all the data from the Archives.",
        "A: Now, but, I was able to get out of it.",
        "A: okay. It wasn\u2019t easy. It was not easy to get out of it. And people still thought that I was\ninvolved.",
        "A: There were I think a much smaller percentage of the ghetto people who felt favorable towards\nRum-cof-ski (ph). Why, the mass, the bulk of the people hated Rum-cof-ski (ph) and put him in,\nthought of him in such a way that he was a demagogue, that he was a tyrant and that he did mean\nwell for the ghetto. We know better. We who saw everything and were involved in almost\neverything know better. That he was the man who really manipulated the Germans at that time and\nwas able to convince them to let us do what we had to do so that we can survive.",
        "A: The work.",
        "A: We had tremendous talents. Yes, we had talents in every phase of the human being, whatever\nthere is to do. We had the intelligence, we had the workmen for it, we had the architects.",
        "A: We had the brains.",
        "A: We had everything. We had everything in the ghetto.",
        "A: Bebof? Well, he felt that he has something, a force which he can use.",
        "A: And he was able to convince all the leading people to have the ghetto provide , SO what\nthey intended to do.",
        "A: Absolutely, but the only thing is that they were able to communicate with our sites, able to buy\nweapons and arm themselves.",
        "A: Yes. But what finished it? The riot. The uprising.",
        "A: No, Bertie, before that they weren\u2019t as organized as the Lodz ghetto.",
        "A: So they could not satisfy the Germans as we could.",
        "A: Probably. Because if they would have satisfied the Germans as we had, they probably would\nhave also been left alive.",
        "A: It was the symbol of Poland and the Germans hated the Poles. Do you realize that we had\nfactories, you name it and we had it. Metal, everything.",
        "A: This is the comb factory. I don\u2019t know this one.",
        "A: The comb factory?",
        "A: Not that I know.",
        "A: Not that I know of. And this is indubitably the comb because he has a Bunsen burner,\nwhat we call the Bunsen burner and he has some metal here too.",
        "A: This definitely will be the metal resort.",
        "A: They had a fake metal resort.",
        "A: You made combs in concentration camps. The Lodz ghetto paper resort is what it was, so it\nwasn\u2019t a comb factory, it was a paper resort.",
        "A: These are grinding tools, grinding and sharpening the tools.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The same thing here.",
        "A: Here they have, you know, combs is very easy to make.",
        "A: Iron horns at the comb factory again, comb factory.",
        "A: Here you see combs.",
        "A: Only the kind of work, like metal resorts, clothes resorts, shoe resorts...",
        "A: I don\u2019t even know that we had a comb factory.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: That\u2019s news to me!",
        "A: Yeah, to me too.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t have a comb factory.",
        "A: Yeah, mother did my combs. Combs are very easily made, you know that?",
        "A: Here they are grinding them, but...",
        "A: Yeah. Jack-o-vich (ph) made for me in the concentration camp a comb from metal. He made it,\nit was easy.",
        "A: okay. It has to be metal comb because there was no plastic at that time.",
        "A: It had to be that, it had to be that because they had to be metal combs.",
        "A: , he was in charge of the metal department, he lives in Cleveland.",
        "A: Big.",
        "A: The metal factory was big.",
        "A: Yeah. The hat factory was small.",
        "A: Hat factory. They had a hat factory and lingerie and...",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah a lot.",
        "A: What Bert did? He \u2014 \u2014 , and he made enemies.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "A: Awful, awful. But I had an influence on him and he always made the right judgment because he\nis a very honorable man, I have to say it in front of him. He had integrity, this is what drew me to\nhim.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, it was large.",
        "A: No, coats. Rain coats, rubber coats.",
        "A: This here, it was metal, pots and pans.",
        "A: The same here. No, here they could dress, or tailoring.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: What is this?",
        "A: Shoeing workshop. Yes. That\u2019s correct.",
        "A: Yeah, this is manufacturing.",
        "A: Pop-e-nich (ph). Says there Pop-e-nich (ph). That\u2019s the scale.",
        "A: Yeah, they weigh something.",
        "A: Feather resort.",
        "A: Oh, no, you know where we were collecting the feathers? In the church were I was working.",
        "A: That\u2019s a scale and the feather resort.",
        "A: We had the whole church, 1t was piled with feathers and we had to put it in containers. And it\nwent to Germany, you know.",
        "A: Everything.",
        "A: Some was left over for the people. Like, for instance, my leather case for the ID card. Raw\nmaterial from the Germans and, you know, the cigarette case.",
        "A: There was a lot of pilfering, a lot of people, whoever was sitting by the Shisel (ph), Off-gee-\ngessen (ph), you know what I am talking about? Everybody helped himself like an asha (ph), you\nhad to organize.",
        "A: Their stuffing cushions.",
        "A: Oh, this looks like the church we worked in!",
        "A: That is the church.",
        "A: Yeah? The last one when we were...",
        "A: No, the church was right 1n center...",
        "A: Mon-ee-nas-ka (ph)?",
        "A: No, Sche-dos-ka (ph), Mon-sad-nee-marinko (ph), Sadi-e-rin-neck (ph).",
        "A: But it says here located on Mon-ee-nas-ka (ph).",
        "A: No, Sadi-e-rin-neck (ph), number four.",
        "A: You must know.",
        "A: Oh year, I know.",
        "A: Yeah. A church, I was working there for a few weeks before the transport was sent out, they had\nus going every day to the church and to fill these feathers in containers. I don\u2019t know what\nhappened.",
        "A: From, probably. Probably from people\u2019s, I don\u2019t know, from people\u2019s cushions or whatever, or\ncomforters probably. And they cleaned it and then they sent it to Germany.",
        "A: Oh, there\u2019s so much Jewish wealth in Germany still.",
        "A: Oh! His daughter 1s rich.",
        "A: He made himself a millionaire.",
        "A: His daughter, he has two daughters, I think they live in Bremen, no? Bebof\u2019s children, Bert?\nWhere did Bebof\u2019s daughter live, in Bremen?",
        "A: No, that was Ribia.",
        "A: Where does Bebof\u2019s...?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. [Looking at photograph] It\u2019s hard to determine it\u2019s so dark.",
        "A: Yes, I read this.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: They probably the people that were left behind to clean the ghetto.",
        "A: It could be. It 1s very hard today to identify but they probably know what their talking about. I\ncould not, that is also a hat factory, so they must have known the Goldbergs.",
        "A: This looks familiar.",
        "A: A house in the ghetto Lodz converted by Rum-cof-ski (ph) into a workshop for hat\nmanufacturing.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know anybody.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know anybody. But where\u2019s Bi-gill-man (ph)?",
        "A: A group of [inaudible].",
        "A: This is where my little cousin was working.",
        "A: Da-doff-ska (ph).",
        "A: A resort. Not factory, resort.",
        "A: This is Da-jorst-ska (ph).",
        "A: Mort-ray-gob-ska (ph).",
        "A: In Yiddish, they called 1t Mort-ray-gar-bess (ph).",
        "A: Number 10.",
        "A: And we lived number 13. I lived with my parents in these place.",
        "A: These houses, see all the balconies had to be taken down because they were so deteriorated.",
        "A: We were a few years ago in Poland and they were taking off the balconies because they were\ndropping on people. I don\u2019t know who that is, what 1s that?",
        "A: They are waiting for distribution of some sort.",
        "A: This looks like Let-no-meska-chin-nash-ta (ph) but your office was like that located.",
        "A: No, that\u2019s not my, no, no, I didn\u2019t have this here.",
        "A: Oh, Ibo-shitz (ph). You know who, do you have Ibo-shitz Sov-na (ph)? She was the head of\nthe...",
        "A: Yes, I saw a picture, she\u2019s on...",
        "A: E-Y-B-U-S-Z-I-T-Z, I guess, but the spelling is in the chronicle.",
        "A: You know, it\u2019s funny, look at this pictures. They don\u2019t look like Jews. They don\u2019t have that\nspecific look. And the German were digging us out.",
        "A: In the bindery, paper resort.",
        "A: Yeah, also the same pictures.",
        "A: Storing rolls of paper. The same. The same. Rolls of papers.",
        "A: Fol-fo-vich (ph)? Bertie?",
        "A: Yeah. Ibo-schitz (ph). Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, he was the head of the housing department.",
        "A: This one here. His sister was a big shot.",
        "A: She was giving out a buy-a-rot (ph), you know the special. She had stores where people that\nwere getting their certificate from a doctor, they needed this or that, food or, all kinds of food, milk\nand stuff like that. This was her.",
        "A: Eh, what\u2019s his name? He was Klo-ver (ph).",
        "A: By-gil-man! (ph) He was the head of the paper department.",
        "A: Yeah. I know so many people, but, wait a second, wait a second, wait a second! No, Ibo-schitz\n(ph). Him I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yes. He survived. There were four brothers and a sister.",
        "A: Yeah, probably. She had survived, their sister. She was a beautiful woman and met her fiancee\nfrom before the war in Tel Aviv and they got married but she passed away a few years ago.",
        "A: Oh, a lot of people.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: It\u2019s very hard to get because they are spewed all over the globe. You think of people there and\nwhen we find somebody...",
        "A: We met people in the most outlandish places that survived the Holocaust.",
        "A: It\u2019s a guess.",
        "A: It\u2019s a small number, small guess.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t know these people.",
        "A: This is the same picture as the other one.",
        "A: No, it\u2019s not the same, but the same office.",
        "A: No, how could you?",
        "A: Here again is Ibo-schitz (ph).",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: He\u2019s a handsome guy.",
        "A: Yeah, in 1962 to 1971. He passed away in 1971. He didn\u2019t want to, this is Bi-gel-man (ph).\nThese other people I don\u2019t know. And this is Ibo-schitz (ph).",
        "A: Cutting papers.",
        "A: On both sides. Here and there, but on the right side and on the back left side.",
        "A: No, the same side.",
        "A: Right, right, right. They have all these big pictures here from the paper factory.",
        "A: Only two, yeah.",
        "A: I know Henry Gross, he was a very close friend of ours, he was working for Professor\nRosenstein, the paper publisher.

        "A: You know, I know so much about him I don\u2019t want to convince you...",
        "A: [Speaking in foreign language].",
        "A: He was from Lodz but...",
        "A: He was a Lodzer, but lived a long time in Germany and then was in 1939 deported.",
        "A: First of all I was born in, and I was not deported in 1939 only in 1938.",
        "A: He writes and he takes a lot of freedom here with the writing because he doesn\u2019t know! How\ndoes he know? Nobody knew his background. I was his wife and I didn\u2019t know his background.",
        "A: It was for . Iwas a gigolo.",
        "A: That\u2019s something. Nobody called me that.",
        "A: So. I called you a Casanova but...",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s sad. Very, very sad.",
        "A: No, we did, if she asked we answered.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t talk much about it. Such things that happened, two weeks before my daughter\u2019s\nwedding. Naturally they both knew it. And they know their father.",
        "A: Details? Nobody knows. You are the only one that knows. We never told anybody anything.",
        "A: She never came with direct questions.",
        "A: Oh, but Bert. You know mother told her plenty. My mother was very vocal.",
        "A: She might have talked, she might have discussed it with her grandmother.",
        "A: And they were very, very close with their granddaughter.",
        "A: But she never asked me direct questions about it.",
        "A: My mother...",
        "A: My mother lived in the past. Mother-in-law, she lived in the past.",
        "A: And she was telling her feelings and her thoughts she was telling my daughters. They were very,\nvery close, very close. And they knew a lot from my mother and my mother knew a lot and she told\nthem as it is and they looked up to her.",
        "A: Well, you see when they were young growing up we had our life to live, she had a hard time.\nBecause we always went somewhere else or she never had really to be able to socialize and have a\ncircle of friends.",
        "A: Not because we were hiding out, it\u2019s because his job took him.",
        "A: In my profession, traveled. And at that time we did not have a chance, or it never came to an\noccasion that she came to ask about this. Later on when she grew up and knows and she has her\nown child, she came around to be interested, more interested in what happened. And some she\nknows, some we told her, but she would like to know more. And when we get this tape now with\nyour interview...",
        "A: When she didn\u2019t know everything.",
        "A: She will know a little bit more.",
        "A: Yes. She has and she also has the film.",
        "A: And you wrote your observation on the margin, remember, in the chronicle?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Because there were a lot of discrepancies also and Bert wrote...",
        "A: Why does the chronicle of the Lodz ghetto in which I appear, why didn\u2019t they write about this\nlike this?",
        "A: They would, if it was true, they would!",
        "A: And they researched everything, I think very carefully because this is all documented what they\nhave in the chronicle of the Lodz ghetto, is it not?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: So 1s this really, if this would be the case, it definitely would have been written.",
        "A: Somewhere.",
        "A: No. Because it was laying still for such a long time and today we were faced with the facts, we\nsaw the pictures so...",
        "A: If you have orange juice from the concentrate and you let it stay. If you have everything down\nthere and the water is up with things, and you have to shake it. And we now stirred everything up,\nokay? So now everything is again...",
        "A: Going, and it\u2019s full. It\u2019s all, it\u2019s not any more separated. It\u2019s solid from the shaking.",
        "A: Maybe yes, maybe no.",
        "A: We don\u2019t know, we don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yeah, I wanted to have it out of the way. This is the purpose we came.",
        "A: Yes, well, we were able to identify for them quite a few people.",
        "A: In a way yes, 1n a way no.",
        "A: Yes and no. I\u2019m glad because we can live with ourselves. We are not the kind of people we, we\nwould never benefit from somebody\u2019s misery. This is not the type, listen! If we went to the flast-\nen-tralen (ph), the ghetto, and you had a witness, and Nat-kit (ph) who was working there and he\nwas giving us portion of meat that the dog should be having and we shared it with the dog. And I\nhad a witness. But you see, we didn\u2019t tell the Rabbi Stein to call him, we didn\u2019t tell him to call\nanybody. He went to the Lodzer people and they gave him names and he spoke to some people.\nBut, boy do we have already people that I know will really cheer us. But we never gave names.\nBut the two survivor girls we told you about it, I want you to talk to them. They are very sharp\nwomen. Very nice.",
        "A: This is difficult to live with because it\u2019s a big lie.",
        "A: Well, first of all, as I said I had a very restless night and...",
        "A: Eight o\u2019clock, quarter after eight we were in bed already. We were so shook up.",
        "A: I was exhausted. Mentally. And for some reason I was very restless and I couldn\u2019t sleep well. I\nnapped then I was awake and I napped.",
        "A: Cat napping. I don\u2019t know, I feel so much shame that such a thing can surface now. I can\u2019t\nbelieve it.",
        "A: Somebody says something, is something different but written down in a book and, I don\u2019t know\nwhat kind of, how many books are printed or in how many books were sold and how many books\nwere read, right?",
        "A: Anybody that reads it, it\u2019s just awful.",
        "A: Somebody who really doesn\u2019t know reads this. My God, what kind of monster was this guy?\nsays you become such a powerful guy.",
        "A: Certainly, certainly it\u2019s important.",
        "A: But listen, when we talk about ourselves, we want to smell like roses, right?",
        "A: Yeah but we still state only facts.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t a thing that we wanted to defend ourselves because there is nothing to defend.",
        "A: But we said it as it is and there are still living people that can witness.",
        "A: Mmmm, interesting.",
        "A: Yeah. So many should have taken testimonies from all these people but this should be\ngoing back 40 years ago when everybody was alive because Bert had a lot of people that called him\nand thanked him. That they are alive. He\u2019s responsible for it.",
        "A: Well. You know that I mentioned it to you that I made an enemy and a friend at the same time.",
        "A: Maybe he\u2019s one of them?",
        "A: Nobody could. I am only human.",
        "A: Do you think if he could do something, he wouldn\u2019t do it for my father? That my father would\nbe alive if he would have the power?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I\u2019m guilty.",
        "A: okay. Then you can say I wanted something from him and he denied it. He didn\u2019t do it. okay?\nAll right, so he disappointed me. But bring up lies? Make such statements?",
        "A: Bertie, do you remember a fellow that use to be your family some distant relation and you were\nso helpful to him?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: He was always in your office whenever I came.",
        "A: A cousin.",
        "A: Some distant cousin and he had a wife.",
        "A: No, you remind me, yes.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know his name anymore. And whenever I came to, happen to come over to his office this\nwas, he was always asking Bert for something and I said to Bert, my God, he\u2019s always asking you\nfor things. He survived and his wife survived. And you know where we met him? After the war in\nHamburg it was a Schmelling match, boxing match. And he said to him, yes you are a good guy.\nAnd turned away. A fellow that had always, always asked for things and always, whenever Bert\ncould he always did it. Probably once he had to deny him, he couldn\u2019t.",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "A: Jealousy.",
        "A: But still to make such statements.",
        "A: And you know, now it dawns on me. When I started to read 1t I remember that Nat-tik (ph) told\nus somebody\u2019s bad mouthing him. But we didn\u2019t pay any attention. We did not ask who it is and\nwhere it is. Now...",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t care less.",
        "A: Now it came to...",
        "A: Could be. Because he lives in Queens and in Sweden too. And Stockholm.",
        "A: Probably.",
        "A: It\u2019s unbelievable.",
        "A: Yeah. But I just, I just, can\u2019t digest it. Can I have this?",
        "A: Thank you. Put it together with the envelope. Is the Federal Express, does it have room in the\nenvelope. No? In there. Try it now.",
        "A: 1am tired. I\u2019m tired and I\u2019m exhausted mentally. Very upset.",
        "A: I\u2019m very upset because this is unbelievable.",
        "A: No, don\u2019t feel terrible. I\u2019m glad that I learned something.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t have an inkling about it.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it\u2019s very interesting because otherwise how would I know that something\nlike this exists. All right. You will excuse me?",
        "A: No, that\u2019s why I take the candy now so, I get a little bit more saliva action.",
        "A: I\u2019m just, right now it bugs me what fry-ana (ph), you know, the third thing that she said to the\nRabbi.",
        "A: Yeah. One was that I sent Men-tak (ph), that I sent him on to the ghetto so that I can marry you?",
        "A: No, that you got rid of him.",
        "A: Oh yeah. That I got rid of him. So that I could marry you.",
        "A: Then we changed our names because we were hiding out.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And the third one, I don\u2019t know. It was three things, I remember.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yes?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t understand the question.",
        "A: I don\u2019t either.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, the nice guy had nothing to do with it.",
        "A: He would have to control his temper I guess. Because he never blew his top with Rum-cof-ski\n(ph) just out of respect for an old man. Bert knew when to loose his temper...",
        "A: I\u2019m sure I did.",
        "A: I know with Sche-bit-ski (ph) when they came and wanted...",
        "A: Lalmost killed the guy.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Nobody buys me.",
        "A: Then I wish Abrom-ic Kud-meric (ph) would be available, Bert?",
        "A: Well, Eddie Kline?",
        "A: No, Eddie was living with Dora so he doesn\u2019t know how it conditions.",
        "A: He came, every time he came to me he played something on his harp.",
        "A: You want to call him? He\u2019s the adopted son of his sister. Whenever he had problems, he was a\nlittle boy, he would come to me...",
        "A: He always came to me, he said, you are the only one I could talk to.",
        "A: He was a boy of 14.",
        "A: No, 12 or 13.",
        "A: Or something like this.",
        "A: I know about, a young boy. Very lovely young boy.",
        "A: Today he\u2019s in his fifties, close to sixty, huh?",
        "A: Yeah, I think that he must be in his sixties, Bert.",
        "A: In his sixties, yes.",
        "A: Oh yeah, whenever we have a chance.",
        "A: Yes, oh yes.",
        "A: In Montreal.",
        "A: Yeah. I told you that his daughter is an international lawyer and his son 1s a professor.",
        "A: And he himself made himself a fortune by inventing and customizing sanding machines, like for\npig pens? The automatic assembly machines where certain parts are coming together and out comes\nthe end, the fixed product, the finished product. So, he made a lot of money with that. And he is an\nardent surfer rider. And he lived now for four month...",
        "A: A surfer.",
        "A: A surfer for four month or five months in a lot.",
        "A: So he can surf. A few years ago he was surfing in Australia, on a surfing trip.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure he did, I\u2019m sure he did.",
        "A: He lives next to Pierre Trudeau. Your looking from his window your looking to...",
        "A: On the balcony of Trudeau. Not that I need witnesses, okay?",
        "A: I\u2019m just saying.",
        "A: To hear two sides?",
        "A: You can average it out.",
        "A: Talking about this Rabbi Stein, he even called Kin-roos (ph) in Israel.",
        "A: Dr. Kin-roos (ph) was the president of the Lodz survivors.",
        "A: And he wrote us a letter telling us.",
        "A: Yeah, I too write the letter.",
        "A: Yeah but I mean, he wrote us a letter telling us that Robert Stein contacted him. So, he met, not\njust throughout Europe but he went to Israel.",
        "A: He called Israel, he didn\u2019t go there.",
        "A: Well, no one else is alive.",
        "A: Bertie, let Joan call Mala Ordner (ph). She knew a lot. She was a doctor in one of the resorts, in\none of the factories. She lives in Spring Valley.",
        "A: No, what for.",
        "A: Dr. Ved-ger (ph) in Tel Aviv. Dr. Kin-e-roos (ph).",
        "A: Oh, no, he wasn\u2019t in ghetto. Dr. Jin-ski (ph), he wasn\u2019t in ghetto, no?",
        "A: He wasn\u2019t in ghetto.",
        "A: They killed her too.",
        "A: They finished in Auschwitz too.",
        "A: The whole family.",
        "A: They went to the gas chamber.",
        "A: No, Bertie, they were killed when they arrived in Auschwitz.",
        "A: Heim and Josef, but I don\u2019t think the women.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t tell you because...",
        "A: I don\u2019t think the women.",
        "A: This is what we heard, we don\u2019t know details.",
        "A: We don\u2019t know details.",
        "A: Many people told me that they know that there was a girl...",
        "A: Oh, your talking about Lucia Szymanowicz.",
        "A: She went to so many men from hand to hand.",
        "A: She was working 1n Bert\u2019s office.",
        "A: And she couldn\u2019t, you couldn\u2019t stand it, that I did not, that I ignored her. That I didn\u2019t make a\npass at her or something like this.",
        "A: Bertie, but she was stealing cards. She was stealing people\u2019s food cards.",
        "A: She was 1n his office. And Rum-cof-ski (ph) sent her out, they caught her and he sent her out on\na transport. She went to Auschwitz and became a madam there. She was walking, while others\nwere working, she was walking around in neglig\u00e9es and robes and stuff like that.",
        "A: And she was waiting for me.",
        "A: And we found out.",
        "A: Yeah. She had a lot of pull, she had a lot of men that she had, she survived. But nobody knows\nwhere she is, where she lives.",
        "A: She had something to give.",
        "A: And she said it.",
        "A: Yeah. She didn\u2019t make anything of it, on the contrary.",
        "A: Oh yeah. In Auschwitz? There was a lot of 1t going on. What are you talking about.",
        "A: She was there. People did what she wanted to do. What she wanted them to do. And I was told\nshe was waiting for me.",
        "A: To kill me. Or to have me killed.",
        "A: Yeah. She was a very vindictive person and Bert had nothing...",
        "A: Lucia Szymanowicz.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know the date.",
        "A: 1942, 1943? 1942.",
        "A: S-z-y-m-a-n-0-w-1-C-Z.",
        "A: They said she was a kappo, you know what a kappo is?",
        "A: Not all. Maybe this was afterwards, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know where they went. I really don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know when they started to send the troops to, the transport to Hel-no and I remember...",
        "A: I doubt that.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, so how could he survive...",
        "A: There were people that went to working camps.",
        "A: And they live. They are alive.",
        "A: And they live. From that period.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: So not all of them went to Hel-no (ph). And I don\u2019t know when they started transporting them to\nAuschwitz.",
        "A: We don\u2019t know because we had no contact.",
        "A: I have no idea.",
        "A: Was. He died in Munich a few years ago.",
        "A: He died in Munich.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think he would divulge anything because he was a little bit shady. He was working with\nthe Gestapo.",
        "A: And what he did with them I don\u2019t know but that was not kosher that he would admit to it in an\ninterview.",
        "A: But he had a big following of people that really would do anything for him. He was a good guy\nby nature.",
        "A: He helped a lot of people.",
        "A: Munich.",
        "A: He never was in Germany before he was...",
        "A: After the war.",
        "A: After the war he went to Germany.",
        "A: He married. A very nice woman and has a child, a son with her. He\u2019s a lawyer. We saw him a\nfew times when we came to Munich.",
        "A: Nobody ever talked anymore about it. It was a chapter in your life that you didn\u2019t want to talk\nabout it.",
        "A: It was like a pack or an agreement amongst the people not to discuss it for one or another reason.\nIt was a period you really liked to forget. The only reason you talked about it is to give the message\nto the children.",
        "A: But lately when we get together, lately, we always wind up talking about it. Before we never\ndid.",
        "A: Because we are so much involved in teaching the young people not to forget because, after all,\nslowly we are leaving. Nobody left to be a witness for it. So now we have to take the last few years\nwe have to live to make sure that it is being spread out.",
        "A: I want to tell about it to Rabbi Stein. To show him that, to read it to him.",
        "A: No, I will translate it for him.",
        "A: Don\u2019t we want to wait on what Teresa comes up with?\n"
