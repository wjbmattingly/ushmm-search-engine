It was\none of our first experiences. We didn\u2019t know how bad it was going to be but everybody tried to\nescape. Only Jewish people went to escape elsewhere. And everybody tried another way. And\nmy brother gave me advice and told me, why don\u2019t you look in the phone book and write to\nsome people and they will sponsor us because no country would let you in anymore. We could\nleave Vienna if anybody would let you in but no country wanted to leave the refugees in. So we\ntook a English phone book and I wrote five names from the alphabet. The first five names. I\nwrote to Abbot was his name Abbot and four more names and my sister wrote to a few B\u2019s and\nher name was Bell. And a few weeks later, I got an answer from a man named Abbot and my\nsister from the name Benn and he said he would sponsor us and be able to help a human life.\nAnd he wrote all the documents and this is the way I came to England. And he was a complete\nstranger. It was in 1939. And when I came to England, he was a furrier and right in the heart of\nOldgate he was situated. And I went to thank him and we were not allowed to take any money,\nof course, only 30 shillings we were allowed to take from Vienna and we were not supposed\nto in England because he guaranteed for us but he asked me and\nasked of course, because no money or nothing, and asked, can you keep a\nneedle in your hand. And are you good at sewing and I say of course. So he gave me a job off\nthe books. He paid me in cash and I was sewing and I was happy and I had a job there in his\nfactory.

And the district where my job\nwas where Mr. Abbot was, it was all bombed with incendiary bombs and overnight and over\nweekends, everything was on fire, it was right in the heart of London.

But the Austrian quota was\nvery small and when all this happened with the Jews in Austria, everybody wanted to go to\nAmerica but it was too late to be registered because the quota was so small but my brother was\nlucky. He stayed in Vienna two years after Hitler occupied Vienna and in the meantime his\nquota was ready to go to America and on the last boat what came from Austria to America he\nwas on it and he came to America.

And they are very nice Jewish people,\nwhat do you want from them. Leave them alone\u2019. A neighbor said that. And they walked\naway. But it was first week when the Nazis occupied.

        "Q: Do you remember your parents talking about the Nazis before they came in, when they were in\npower in Germany in 1933?",
        "A: Oh yes. They said it\u2019s terrible. But as terrible as it was, they didn\u2019t realize that that mad man\nwould take the Jews and kill them like that. Nobody realized what really could happen because\nthat never happened before in our time, if you remember. So nobody knew he was sending\nthem to the gas chambers when we were living there. He kept it a secret too. I don\u2019t know if\nyou ever saw in the movies, when he takes all those Jewish people and puts them 1n those trains\nand the women, they were so vain, they wanted to look nice, they took the suitcase and\neverything, they didn\u2019t know where they were going.

And I\nhad an uncle, my father\u2019s brother, he was very wealthy in Vienna. He had a big warehouse, like\nMacy\u2019s. These people, they went first to those people because they had most money. He was\nvery, very organized. First, he went to all the rich people and they took everything away. And\nthen he went to the people who were not that rich. But everybody got it in the end.

        "A: When I was a teenager, I worked in the store and my sister worked there too. We were selling\nthings. And it was a very busy street. The reason I tell you this because when the Nazis came to\nVienna, when they marched in, all the soldiers they marched on the street and they came to our\nstore, a few of the German soldiers came to our store and they wanted to buy razor blades and\nthey looked at my sister, they looked at me and they said \u201care you Jewish?\u201d and we said yes.\nAnd they screamed at us \u201cdon\u2019t you know we aren\u2019t allowed to buy by Jews\u201d and they walked\nout.",

It was\none of our first experiences. We didn\u2019t know how bad it was going to be but everybody tried to\nescape. Only Jewish people went to escape elsewhere. And everybody tried another way. And\nmy brother gave me advice and told me, why don\u2019t you look in the phone book and write to\nsome people and they will sponsor us because no country would let you in anymore. We could\nleave Vienna if anybody would let you in but no country wanted to leave the refugees in. So we\ntook a English phone book and I wrote five names from the alphabet. The first five names. I\nwrote to Abbot was his name Abbot and four more names and my sister wrote to a few B\u2019s and\nher name was Bell. And a few weeks later, I got an answer from a man named Abbot and my\nsister from the name Benn and he said he would sponsor us and be able to help a human life.\nAnd he wrote all the documents and this is the way I came to England. And he was a complete\nstranger. It was in 1939. And when I came to England, he was a furrier and right in the heart of\nOldgate he was situated. And I went to thank him and we were not allowed to take any money,\nof course, only 30 shillings we were allowed to take from Vienna and we were not supposed\nto in England because he guaranteed for us but he asked me and\nasked of course, because no money or nothing, and asked, can you keep a\nneedle in your hand. And are you good at sewing and I say of course. So he gave me a job off\nthe books. He paid me in cash and I was sewing and I was happy and I had a job there in his\nfactory. I was sewing lining in fur coats and he was very nice. He save my life. And my sister.\nShe was married at that time.",

They had a beautiful house there in Scotland\nand with butlers and they treated them wonderful. But after a few months, the war broke out in\nthe meantime, my sister and her husband went to London. And after the war, it was easier. You\ngot a permit. My brother in law got a job with something, officer, he was a lawyer\nin Vienna and when the Nazis came to Vienna, he had a car and in the first week they took away\nhis car. And they took away everything from the Jews.",

        "A: During the war.",
        "A: In London, it was very bad when the war broke out. Bombs were falling and everybody was\nrunning to the shelters. And everybody tried to save your life. And the district where my job\nwas where Mr. Abbot was, it was all bombed with incendiary bombs and overnight and over\nweekends, everything was on fire, it was right in the heart of London. And I went to the\ncountry to escape, you know. I was working in a factory and was sewing goggles for the army.",

But the Austrian quota was\nvery small and when all this happened with the Jews in Austria, everybody wanted to go to\nAmerica but it was too late to be registered because the quota was so small but my brother was\nlucky. He stayed in Vienna two years after Hitler occupied Vienna and in the meantime his\nquota was ready to go to America and on the last boat what came from Austria to America he\nwas on it and he came to America. When we were living in England, my sister and I, my\nbrother wrote to us, of course, he said what are you doing in England. America is the best\ncountry in the world so you better come to America.

        "A: Before the war? Oh, it was beautiful there, before the war. But the people got anti-Semitic, all\nthis stuff, anti-Semitic, there, but you didn\u2019t feel it.

And when the Nazis came and they knocked at our door and it was an\napartment building and they wanted to take my brother and my father. And we didn\u2019t open the\ndoor and a neighbor from the same floor, she came out, she was not Jewish. And she said \u201cwhat\ndo you want from those people, they\u2019re not at home. And they are very nice Jewish people,\nwhat do you want from them. Leave them alone\u2019. A neighbor said that. And they walked\naway. But it was first week when the Nazis occupied. But they, of course, didn\u2019t leave the\nJewish people alone.",
        "A: Oh, yes. My cousins. They took my cousins away. They took them first to Dachau. But, they\nlet them go. In the beginning they let some of them go, but later on it was worse. They\nwouldn\u2019t let any Jewish people survive. It was terrible. But the worst part was you had no\nrights anymore. You couldn\u2019t go anywhere to complain. You couldn\u2019t go to the police or to\nanywhere. They took all your rights away and there was not place you could go to fight for\nyour rights. This is the worst thing of all.",
        "A: I had a German passport and it was written as Margaret Sarah. All the Jewish women they\ncalled Sarah.",
        "A: Israel.\non your passport?",

It was terrible the propaganda. Hitler, the speeches, I thought screaming\nlike a mad man.",
        "A: Oh yes. They said it\u2019s terrible. But as terrible as it was, they didn\u2019t realize that that mad man\nwould take the Jews and kill them like that. Nobody realized what really could happen because\nthat never happened before in our time, if you remember. So nobody knew he was sending\nthem to the gas chambers when we were living there. He kept it a secret too. I don\u2019t know if\nyou ever saw in the movies, when he takes all those Jewish people and puts them 1n those trains\nand the women, they were so vain, they wanted to look nice, they took the suitcase and\neverything, they didn\u2019t know where they were going. You saw the movies. And as soon as they\nwent, as soon as the trains arrived in the concentration camps, they took their luggage away and\nthey were sorted out who was going to live a little longer and who was going to the gas\nchambers. As soon as the train arrived. You saw the movies, those things. Terrible.",

And I\nhad an uncle, my father\u2019s brother, he was very wealthy in Vienna. He had a big warehouse, like\nMacy\u2019s. These people, they went first to those people because they had most money. He was\nvery, very organized. First, he went to all the rich people and they took everything away. And\nthen he went to the people who were not that rich. But everybody got it in the end. You\ncouldn\u2019t keep anything.",
        "A: No, my mother, she always said he would leave, he would realize it. She always was optimistic\nand she said, he would leave the old people, what can old people do for him, he would leave the\nold people alone. It was very hard for young people to escape so old people it was much harder\nto escape because nobody would sponsor them because they are getting sick and old. So it was\nvery hard to get out.",
        "A: She wanted to leave.",
        "A: She wanted to leave but she was optimistic. She thought he would leave the old people alone.\nBut there was no chance she could leave. Nowhere to go. The only country where we could go\nwas Shanghai and I\u2019ve got a few friends who escaped to Shanghai. And to Israel was also very\nbad to go. I had a cousin she went on a boat to Israel and the English people, they were just\nfighting with Israel. They sunk her boat and she was killed by the British. Her mother was on\nthe boat and her husband and the baby. And they all got killed. The boat was bombed by the\nBritish. It was near Israel and it was sunk by the British. Did you know that?",

And\nmet those two cousins accidentally and they told me what happened to their sister. They were\nkilled on the boat to Israel.",
        "A: When I went back to Vienna, I wanted to find out about my parents. So, I had a good friend, a\nfamily friend, and he was blind. I looked him up and he told me he was together with my\nparents in Theresientadt with his wife and he was together and one day they took my parents\naway from Theresienstadt and his wife too but the Nazis left him alone because he was blind.\nAnd this is the way he survived. And after the war he went back to Vienna.",
        "A: He told me that they were together, all together. One day, they didn\u2019t come back anymore.\nThey disappeared. They sent them to the gas chamber.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: They were heartbroken, of course. We had no contact anymore. As soon as I left, we couldn\u2019t\nwrite a letter or anything anymore because the war was on and nothing went smooth anymore.",
        "A: They were heartbroken but they were happy we saved our lives. These two men they saved our\nlives. I wouldn\u2019t be here. My whole family wouldn\u2019t be here. I would be caught in that\nholocaust. And a lot of people weren\u2019t that lucky. Other people who tried to escape to different\ncountries, my mother\u2019s sister, one of my mother\u2019s sister, she had a friend in Yugoslavia. When\nHitler came, she went to her friend in Yugoslavia and a few months later she was caught in\nYugoslavia with the friends of Hitler.",
        "A: When the Germans came. So there was no escape. The only country where really the Jews\ncould escape but they couldn\u2019t get in was England. Because Hitler never came to England.\nAnd Switzerland was too.",
        "A: Yes. Everything was difficult. Or Italy or France but later they got caught in these other\ncountries. There was no escape for the Jews.",
        "A: There was chaos, of course. Nobody could make a living anymore. I don\u2019t know what they\nwere living on, what they were eating.",
        "A: Oh, no, for Jews, work? Oh, no.",

        "A: Yes, they were healthy people.",
        "A: Well, the blind man, first of all. But then, I wasn\u2019t sure because he didn\u2019t know where they\nwere sent. He only was in Theresienstadt with them. And the reason that Hitler left him alone\nwas he would have been a headache for them. He was blind and they ordered to go there and\ngo there to the chambers, you know.",
        "A: To different tents.",
        "A: Oh, no. They didn\u2019t know they were going to a death camp.",
        "A: No, they didn\u2019t say, oh no. They people up to the end, they what\u2019s going to\nhappen to them. Was in the movie.",
        "A: Yes. And then, just after 50 years, I saw an ad in the local paper and there was a phone number\nfrom the Red Cross and they say they could find some Holocaust victims and you could call a\nnumber. When I called the number from the Red Cross and they sent me a form because I was\nalways wondering what really happened. It never left my mind. I sent out the application and a\nfew months later they say they have an answer, they found my parents. I was so surprised. I\nthought \u201chow could they find two names from so many million people.\u201d I guess when they\nreally found out when and where they died and what happened.",

        "A: And my mother always said that it was right for Maria Theresa because she hated Jews so\nmuch. And in her time the Jewish people had to go to a certain district in Vienna and all of the\nJewish people lived in a certain district in Vienna, the Leiberstein. That\u2019s where I was brought\nup too.",
        "A: Yes. But after Kaiser Josef came in Austria, he was very good to the Jews. He made no\nextinguishing against Jews and non-Jews, they had all the jobs they could have and they all\nloved him. Kiser Franz Josef of Hapsburg. And she always said if he would have still been in\nthe government, Hitler would never have come to Austria.",
        "A: Then was there, that was in my time already. He was the last Kaiser of Hapsburg\nand then came the republic.",
        "A: They thought it was all right. They were anti-Semitic but not openly. They left the Jews alone,\nyou know.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I think as you must know that in Poland was also always anti-Semitic. My father\u2019s parents,\nthey left Poland because of the anti-Semitic. That\u2019s why they settled down in Vienna. His\nparents settled down in Vienna too.",

        "A: No, they died before. They were very old.",
        "A: Oh, no. When Hitler came, it was open up. It was a big difference. But the Jews had all the\nrights that the other people had. You could go to the police, you could go anywhere. But as\nsoon as Hitler came, all this disappeared. But to most of the people, I think it was welcome.",

They went to Israel, a lot of them and a lot of\nthem went to South America. At first he wasn\u2019t that bad. He let them go with their money. But\na few years later, he got worse and worse. He got crazier and crazier. He took everything away\nfrom them, including their lives.",
        "A: No, they didn\u2019t know that. When you live there, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening the next day.\nYou don\u2019t know. He is such a sick man . Who would think of them, that he wants to",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh, yes, But he was sick, sick like nobody else. And he had an easy field because Germany\nwas so bad there and people couldn\u2019t find any work so he blamed everything on the Jews.",
        "A: Not very good. The people were not rich in Vienna, the Jewish people. Very few of them. We\nall could make a living but nothing like in America, 1t was much easier.",

        "A: It wasn\u2019t really a depression. But what I remember it, the money overnight, when I was a child,\nit was worthless. One day you could buy a house and the next day for the same money you\ncould buy a loaf of bread. If you didn\u2019t have a house or property, you better beg of it one day.\nOvernight it happened. It was after the First World War when I was a small child. The money\nwas worthless.",

And my\nuncle and aunt in Eisenstadt, they had vineyards. Took all the vineyards and the house. The\nmoney, you lost. The more you had, you lost everything, the more you lost. All your rights,\nyour property and your money, everything. You\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t lose your life. Some people\nwere lucky not to lose their life.",
