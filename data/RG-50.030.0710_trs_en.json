What year?\n[AG] Oh God, now you got me now, a minute, 19... Early 1942\n[DL] 1942? Okay and what actually happened to you when you were fighting in\nEgypt?\n[AG] Well we were a company on water supply, and we were maintaining the water\nsupply, and digging out what was called a \u2018beers\u2019, that the Romans had dug, to store\ncorn in, cause they filled up with ha... and we was out out out in the wilds, finding\nthese places, we then went to Tobruk,\n[00:05:00]\n[AG] and the company, was split up into sections, there doing various water supply\njobs. And | was was, my, my er, section was looking after an Italian made pumping\nstation, and | sent out to look after a reservoir, on me own, and one morning the, it\nwas miles away from anywhere and some officers came on, and an English officer\nin, he, in South African Army, said to me \u201ccould | blow the reservoir?\u201d\nWell everything was there except the detonators, and | told him | wanted dets, he got\nthem up for me, with a, er, South African sergeant, and we made it blowable.",
        "And then, a couple or three days later, Jerry made a big push, I\u2019d got told to blow the\nreservoir, and when | got outside, and there was a Major there, old gentleman crying\nhis eyes out, an English one in the South African Army, and he said to me \u201cI would\nnever have believed it, look down there\u2019, and somebody had a white flag up.\nAnyway, | was living in a little foxhole myself, | went, he gives me this, South African\n[LAUGHS] gave me a, bottle of South African brandy. So | was sozzled actually\nwhen | got to prisoner, but he come out and, er [LAUGHS], there was a big tank\nthere with a officer wiggling a forty-five around \u201ccome mate\u201d \u2014 | said \u201cyes I\u2019m coming\nmate\u201d, and if went down into brook and joined the column\n[DL] So that\u2019s when you were...\n[AG] Yeah\n[DL] ... captured by the Germans? And what happened to you once you had been\ncaptured by the Germans?\n[AG] We marched a long way and we got into Bengasi, and in the Bengasi..., sure\nhanded, as old as the Italians, and we were put in cages, in big compounds, and the,\ner, Sansui tribe, was firing at us.\n[DL] This is when you're still in, in Africa?\n[AG] Yeah, and this was Bengasi, and anyway we had the barest rations, and er,\nwell we didn\u2019t have any rations, and er, the water we had, you had to put your hand\nout through the wire, and you know, so drink, anyway, the Sansui were\nsh...sh...shooting at us, trying to stop us.\nFrom there they shipped us over to, lord, Italy, | forget where it was we landed, and\nwhen we landed, the old people, pretty near the sea we landed, the old people were\ncrying, and the youngsters were throwing stones at us.\nAnyway we got put in huts, for a while. And er, didn\u2019t have anything to do, then all of\na sudden, they just shift us out in tents\n[DL] And whereabouts in Italy was this?\n[AG] In Italy, I'll tell ye in a minute. Erm, oh god, | should think | went, a minute,\nanyway, we were in tents, on a side of a hill, which gradually became a mud heap,\nand er was there one day, and everybody it was, when the er,\n[00:10:00]\n[AG] Allies had landed in Italy, we, instead of being told to get out and find them, we\nwere told to stay, but that gave the gentlemen time to round us all up. We were put\non trains and shifted into Germany. At a place called Lamsdorf, which actually |\nthink, is in Poland. Well from there which was a huge camp we was moved out to\nAuschwitz.\n[DL] Before you went to Auschwitz, and you were sent in trucks to Lamsdorf, when\nwas this? Do you remember roughly which year, which month it was?\n[AG] Oh, 19, end of 1942 | think",
        "[DL] So it was 1942 you were sent from...\n[AG] Yeah\n[DL] ...erm, from Italy to Germany...\n[AG] Yeah, it was\n[DL] ...and what were conditions like for the duration of your transport to Germany?\n[AG] Oh like cattle trucks. Cattle trucks, | don\u2019t know how many men was in there but\ner, the only food the Italians give us was a tin of so called corned beef, which we\nwere told was made of donkeys [LAUGHS], and er, er, thing a bread all the time, we\nwas travelling all the time in the trucks.\n[DL] And how long did the journey last for?\n[AG] | think it was about a week if that\u2019s right with my memory\n[DL] And were there any stops on the journey?\n[AG] We had to go up through Brenner Pass, so that way. And er, all the stops and\nstarts as the Air Force came over like\n[DL] But did they actually stop and allow you out of the trucks?\n[AG] No.\n[DL] And were there and stops in terms of replenishing water or supplies...?\n[AG] No no no, no.\n[DL] How did you, in terms of water, how did you actually survive, did you have any\nwater?\n[AG] Luck [LAUGHS], luck and well, we were doing our damnedest to upset the Jerry\nactually. But we didnt, we _ didnt  upset...we got to  Lamsdorf.\nSo right, that was a huge camp that was the central camp in Poland where they sent\nout the work parties to Auschwitz and various other places.\n[DL] And how were the cattle trucks to Auschwitz, what were conditions like for you\nin those trucks?\n[AG] Same. Cattle trucks. | can remember passing a label with Auschwitz on, and of\ncourse we never knew what it was, never knew what was happening, and just after\nAuschwitz, we stopped, and we got out, the, this was about midnight, and we\nmarched down to a brand new camp, hutted camp. So thought this is going to be\nalright. Well about three weeks later we all got moved out of the camp to nearer the\nfactory that was, what was being built. And then they put us in huts what was alright,\nthey were alright there was nothing wrong with them\n[DL] And when you arrived at Auschwitz, what was your recollections when you\nactually arrived, when the cattle trucks came into Auschwitz?",
        "[AG] Well we didn\u2019t see Auschwitz cause we was held in the camp they give us, for\nabout three weeks, we didn\u2019t see nothing happening until we got up by the wire on\nthis big factory. And then we saw the Jews and everything else, what was happening\n[DL] And that\u2019s IG Farben\n[AG] Yeah\n[DL] And what did you witness when you got, when you got up towards IG Farben?\n[AG] Well we were watching these, couldn't hardly believe it, all these poor people in\nwhat we used to call pyjama suits, and the way the Germans were treating them. To\nthe Germans\n[00:15:00]\n[AG] they were just dirt, they...if the German wanted to kill one he would, [COUGH],\nand they were split up into parties, and each party had a chap on, which was also a\nJew, and if they thought the gang wasn't working hard enough he thrashed him.\n[COUGH], excuse me, erm, and er we couldn't make it out to see Jews at times\nkilling Jews. So if they didn\u2019t work hard enough, they were thrashed and | seem them\nkilled. And they were left. They were picked up at night, taken back, put in the boiler.\n[DL] Sorry they were taken back and put where?\n[AG] They were put in the actual Auschwitz, German, German Auschwitz, and er,\nthey er, sometimes you saw, but as regards to Jerry in our camp, he was mainly the\nolder generation of Jerries that had fought at the end of the 1914 1918 war\n[DL] You're talking about your guards...\n[AG] Yeah\n[DL] ...so the men who guarded you?\n[AG] Our guards. You had, there was some, well the Jews had SS guards, and they\nwould try to intimidate us but they couldn't\n[DL] The SS would try to intimidate you?\n[AG] They had a, we did have one boy shot. He was in the, when we had to go in the\nfactories to work in small parties, he was one of a small party, that was painting\npylons. You know, pylons, and he couldn't go up, which is feasible. He was a minor.\nHe told the Jerry, the Jerry man the gaffer | think was there, he said \u201cI can\u2019t go up\u2019.\nWell there was an SS bloke there, and this SS bloke, oh yes he\u2019s got to go up, he\u2019s\ngot to go up and all this, and he turned around and shot. Immediately we were all\ntaken back into the camp. Everybody.\n[DL] And you witnessed the shooting of Corporate Reynolds?\n[AG] Pardon?\n[DL] Did you witness yourself?",
        "[AG] No, no no | didn\u2019t, that er that was the old in case of nine all, it was happened\nthere, but in the end if an SS came round the corner, and we were there, he turned\nhis back and went back where he come from\n[DL] Why did he do that?\n[AG] Cause he know damned well we should get him if we wanted to\n[DL] And were there cases where British...\n[AG] Jerry put a, in our camp, the Jerry put a spy in our camp, we found out. He was\ndisposed of, and Jerry never put another one in there\n[DL] So what actually happened to this man? How did you know or why did you\nsuspect that he wasn't what he said he was?\n[AG] Well, they found out he was supposed to be in the Yorkshire Yeomanry unit, he\nhad the badges and all of it, but how they found out | don\u2019t know. But when they\nfound out, he wasn't no more.\n| don't, | Know where he was but I\u2019m not saying.\n[00:20:00]\n[AG] But with that, the SS and that, was looked very careful what they done to us.\n[DL] And in terms of other resistance, or passive resistance or sabotage...\n[AG] O yeah they, when, | think it was the Canadians, they, they, er put a boat on\nshore and blew them up on the coast, or anyway, Jerry said, to, we put some of their\nmen in iron, in chains you know, and they had the bright idea of putting our hands in\nrope. So we had to line up, and they tied around the rope with string, and while they\nwere doing that, the one he done before went to the back of the queue, and took off,\ntook off the string, and they were going round in circles, like this. And in the end,\nJerry he got fed up with it, he didn't bother no more\n[DL] So this was a punishment in retaliation to what the Allies had done during the\nwar\n[AG] Yeah, yer...\n[DL] And, and this was just a random punishment...\n[AG] Yeah\n[DL] ...without purpose?\n[AG] That's right\n[DL] And other acts of sabotage that happened \u2014 what other acts of...?\n[AG] Oh, er when one was walking about the factory, it was also a railway, parcelling\nyard. You change the tickets on the trucks, on the trains that were made up, so\nperhaps the Russians that were waiting for ammunition, all they got were loads of\npaint. Take one card out and swap them all over",
        "[DL] You mean the Germans on the Russian front if they were waiting for\nammunition...\n[AG] Yeah, yeah we used to swap them over. Swap the cards over no matter where\nit was, take that card and put it on another train see\n[DL] So the train would then change direction, and end up at the Russian front with\npaint instead of bullets?\n[AG] That\u2019s right. Then one day, two boys had a bright idea, they were railway\nengineers, they pinched a train, pinched an engine. Went for a ride, Jerry didn\u2019t know\nwhere his engine was till it came back down the line ooh...ohhh..oooh! [LAUGHS],\nsmall stuff\n[DL] Weren't they afraid? When | was speaking with Ron Jones he mentioned that\nthere was fear, or at least fear for him of the gas chambers. Was there a fear for\nother men as well that such acts of defiance...\n[AG] No\n[DL] ...could result in...\n[AG] No they didn\u2019t do, we had no fear of the gas chambers at all. Only punishment\nwe got here was put in the cooler for perhaps two days or three days \u2014 that was all.\n[DL] Did you ever end up in the cooler?\n[AG] No\n[DL] And when did you actually find out about the gas chambers?\n[AG] Well, we found out within about two days of being there, cause you could smell\nit, you could smell it in the air. And the Jews that we managed to talk to told us,\ncause if they were caught talking to us, that was the end of them. That\u2019s the end of\nthem, they went back to their camp, and murdered.\n[DL] So did you talk to any of the Jews, or did you manage to talk to any of the Jews,\nor communicate with them?\n[AG] Well, you could, but you had to be very careful, you had to be very careful\nbecause of the SS saw you talking to them they tried to wallop, they'd kill the Jew\n[DL] In front of you?\n[AG] In front of us\n[DL] So when you were working at the IG Farben factory,\n[00:25:00]\n[DL] how many people would you see, would you say on a day to day basis did you\nsee being murdered?\n[AG] Oh | expect to see two or three at least\n[DL] And for what reason",
        "[AG] Just because the Germans didn\u2019t like them. And the Capos, they got a bit more\nto eat that the others, what it amounted to\n[DL] What happened to you at the IG Farben factory? \u2014 You became injured?\n[AG] Yes, | got these fingers squashed loading pipes\n[DL] And so what, what did you do when you were injured, how did you...\n[AG] | went back to the camp hospital, cause we had a doctor, and he got them right,\nthen | stopped in the camp then for a few months, but it was the doctor that'd keep\nthat hospital full, if you understand what | mean. You only have to have a cold oh,\nyou went in hospital. You wasn\u2019t working for the Jerry, then Jerry, er um, have a blitz,\nand kick you all out of the hospital, and by the next morning, you\u2019re all back in again\n[DL] What were conditions like in the hospital?\n[AG] Pardon?\n[DL] What were conditions like in your hospital?\n[AG] Good, good, got nothing to grumble about\n[DL] And when you were convalescing from your injury, you made a garden?\n[AG] No, er yeah | had a garden\n[DL] So could you talk a little about the garden which you made?\n[AG] Yeah well that was funny, | was there one day, and | got myself, found a spade,\nfind out what the soil was like you know, so | made a little garden between us and er,\n| asked permission from Charlie Coward, the camp, camp officer, and he said yeah,\nand then | got some tomato plants, he got me some tomato plants cause he was,\nwhat they called a man of confidence, he was allowed to go to Auschwitz to, and\npick up the mail and things like that, and er, | give him a bar of chocolate, and he\ngives us a dozen tomato plans, quite lovely. Then of course, this Saturday night we\ngave a concert, as we used to do things like that in the camp, and er, we're clearing\nSunday morning, we were, we had the stage and that outside, it was clear that way,\nand the Yanks come over bombing.\n| went into my little foxhole, and er, | didn't like the Jerry shelter, of course one came\ndown, hit the end of the shelter, ah let's see what, how many was killed there, well |\nknow there was twenty odd, killed there. | got out of my little hole, went down there,\nand the first bloke | pulled out was my friend.\n| was still there working, and the doctor said \u201cyou want my tea\u2019, \u201cI\u2019m alright\u201d | said,\nand he said \u201cyou want my _\u00a7 tea\u2019, and that\u2019s = an _\u2014 order.\nSo after things quietened down and that, | said, why did you order me up there, and\nhe said \u201cIf you hadn't have pulled a friend out, you\u2019d have been alright, because I\u2019d\nseen it in your eyes you'd be the next one to go down\n[DL] To go down?\n[AG] To go down on the floor you know? Faint, pass out",
        "[DL] Was that because you'd been injured by the blast?\n[AG] No, it's because I\u2019d pulled my mate out first \u2014 if | didn\u2019t know the bloke it\nwouldn't have affected me.\n[00:30:00]\n[DL] When you'd had your garden, before it was destroyed, what did you witness,\nerm from the nearby concentration camp, how close were you to, to the\nconcentration camp?\n[AG] Well actually, we were about, | should suppose, about a quarter mile, it was,\nseeing the, maps, | had the maps of them but I\u2019ve lost them, we was about a quarter\nof a mile. We were next door to the boundary, the boundary wire of the factory,\nthere\u2019s only road between us, but the actual, | suppose about a quarter of a mile\naway from us.\n[DL] And, when you were working on your garden, did you witness atrocities at that\npoint as well?\n[AG] No, | couldn't because | was in between huts.\n[DL] The radio set in the British camp, er, how did that actually work?\n[AG] Don\u2019t ask me cause nobody knows, they were working it\n[DL] And what about, we\u2019ve touched on some of the sabotage acts which were\ncarried out, erm, were there other sabotage acts in terms of what, what was the\nmantra, the British mantra in |G Farben?\n[AG] No, everything was done, how can | put, sort of automatic, you were going to\nhelp the Jerries as hard as you could\n[DL] And what did you do to try to help the Jews in terms of...\n[AG] If we could, used to pass them food, what we could spare, pass them bits... But,\nthat\u2019s all we could do\n[DL] And how many Jewish people, how many concentration camp victims would you\nestimate were working at IG Farben at that point?\n[AG] | should, | should imagine there be a couple of thousand. Cause it was a huge\nplace. It were going to be fifteen square mile when it were finished\n[DL] And the number of British POWs there?\n[AG] About six hundred\n[DL] And you were witnessing everyday what was happening?\n[AG] Oh yes\n[DL] And what was the average day like for yourself at |G Farben?\n[AG] Well you were stood up to, and nothing to the Jerry [COUGH / LAUGH], you\ndidn\u2019t work if you didn\u2019t want to, but if a Jerry come along he see you be doing",
        "something even if you be doing nothing. They put, our boys dug a trench, and they\nput a big cable in there, electric cable [LAUGHS], but while they were doing it, the\npick axes slipped, went through this cable two or three times, come to some big top\nnotch Jerry, so he pulls the handle down and nothing happens [LAUGHS], that\u2019s the\nsort of thing we was doing\n[DL] In terms of away from the factory, erm, what sort of entertainment did you out\non? You touched upon the stage plays earlier...\n[AG] Yeah we had stage plays, had erm, a little sort of jazz band effort there you\nknow cause there wasn't very much else there you see, play cards, talking amongst\nyourselves\n[DL] Did you ever discuss what was happening with the Jews?\n[AG] Oh yeah, yeah\n[DL] And what did you, when you discussed what was happening to the Jews, what\nwas the discussion?\n[AG] well the discussion was seeing and talking if there was a way we could help any\nof them, you see, actually, | don\u2019t think, anybody tried to get out from ours where we\nwere, because it was in the middle of a swamp, our camp.\n[00:35:00]\n[AG] And without you know the roads you lose yourself\n[DL] You took part in stage plays with POWs who were in Sweeny Todd alongside\nRon Jones. What are you recollections of those shows, and rehearsals leading up\nto...\n[AG] Fun, fun. It was awful fun. When we actually put the play on, Jerry always put a\nman in the hut, and he was in the centre seat in front the stage. We weren't allowed\nto sing God save the King, so we sang the Land of Hope and Glory. But when we\nstood up, we made sure that bloody Jerry stood up with us, we squashed him till he\nstood up\n[DL] And that German was a censor?\n[AG] He was an, he was an armoured Jerry, sergeants see that we didn\u2019t make fun\nof Adolf Hitler. Another what used to happen, they used to give us pep talks, all lined\nup and this little Jerry officer, he about four foot six, he come in, strutting in all his lot,\nand he'd start \u201cwe sunk four of your battleships yesterday - hooray\u201d, cause they\ncheered like that, and in the end, you've heard of man jumping, jumping with rage, |\nseen him actually jumping up and down. You take no notice of them, cause we had a\nrough idea of what was happening with the couple of radios we had in there see\n[DL] Was this man an SS officer or was he...\n[AG] He was a normal German officer, cause when our boys landed in France, Jerry\nused to put on a \u2018music while you work on\u2019 in hospital you know, you used to have\nmusic while you were working in the hospital, and they forgot to switch it off, and",
        "they said \u201cthe allies have landed on the coasts this morning. In France we have\nresisted it\u2019. We all, they called us all in, in the camp, house had the biggest bonfire of\ntheir life when that happened [LAUGHS]\n[DL] And this was just in the hospital where the music was played?\n[AG] Yeah\n[DL] And this was just in the British POW hospital?\n[AG] Yeah\n[DL] And how many people would you say roughly worked in that hospital, or were\npatients in that hospital at any one time?\n[AG] Well it varied, it could be a dozen patients in there all the time, and half a dozen\nhelping | suppose\n[DL] In terms of just going back to to to what was going on around you with the Jews,\nwhat's your, looking back on it now, what\u2019s your recollection? What stands in your\nmemory now as to the treatment which you witnessed at that point in your life?\n[AG] what was, what stands in my life was the dead, the dead left out in the factory\nafter the bombing. You see this big factory had concrete cellars and things like that,\nyou know, and when the bombing come, the Jews went in there, and they were left\nwhen the bombs hit them, left there for a couple of days\n[DL] And how many roughly would you say were in the cellars?\n[AG] | couldn't tell ye | don\u2019t know\n[DL] At the start of 1945, you were, you were ordered to leave the camp...\n[AG] Yep\n[DL] ...what was your memory of the walk from Auschwitz?\n[AG] Bloody cold [LAUGHS], and a lack of food, they never fed us if they couldn't\n[00:40:00]\n[DL] And what did you see on, on the march as you walked away from Auschwitz?\n[AG] A lot of dead Jews beside the road, cause they marched out before us, some of\nthem\n[DL] And what happened to you during the course of the march?\n[AG] Well personally, myself, during the march | went down with, | didn\u2019t know it at\nthe time, with pneumonia, but there was two dentists, dentist officers, there was six\nof us put in a big mansion, and they were given, Jerry give them some pills, | don\u2019t\nknow what they were. Anyway can\u2019t remember that bit all that much, but they saved\nus, saved our lives. And from then, they put us on a train to Pilson, and I\u2019ve never\nmoved on a train so fast in all my life. Was in Pilson station, and the engine\u2019s on our\ncarriage, there\u2019s only one coach on each end and they come over bombing, and |",
        "don't think wheels of that truck touched the rails into a tunnel, so as to keep the\nengines from getting blasted\n[DL] When you arrived, erm at Pilson, what happened to you after that point?\n[AG] Well, | joined up with another column, and just marched\n[DL] And the other column, was that made up of other prisoners of war, or was the\nconcentration camp victims...\n[AG] No, there was no concentration camps that | knew moved out, these were all\nprisoners\n[DL] And how were you treated during the course of your march?\n[AG] We were treated alright \u2014 they couldn't give us no food, we had a scrounge\neverything, but | didn\u2019t see any, how can | put it, cruelty, cause they were the same\nas us see, mainly old war people, they were not too bad at all. But then, we were put\nin three barns on the side of the hill, and what the Red Cross done, and Jerry agreed\nto it, sent some wagons to the Swiss border, they were loaded up with parcels, Red\nCross parcels, and told to find the columns. Then, we had three of these wagons hit\nus, SO we were alright for food then. And then we stopped in there for a fortnight |\nsuppose\n[DL] When about was this now?\n[AG] Eh?\n[DL] What date would you say roughly this happened, and roughly where about were\nyou at this point?\n[AG] | can\u2019t tell you where it was, it was somewhere in, in Germany, making towards\nthe coast, | don\u2019t know, | don\u2019t know the name of the place\n[DL] And which month would you say this was?\n[AG] Er May, this was April time\n[DL] And so at what point were you then freed from German captivity?\n[AG] What happened was we let one night, evening, we decided two or three of us,\nwe was on the village at the bottom of the hill, we\u2019d go and have a pint. So we all\nmarched down the village, and | went away in the pub, | said we wanted beer, and\nthe Jerry said we're not serving you, so two of us jumped over the bar and got our\nown.\n[00:45:00]\n[AG] We had some money we could pay, you know camp money, and at the end of\nthis room, you know, there was a load of old hatcheries you know, signs, course they\nlooked black as ink, well we had them all singing before we left. Well next night, we\nlooked out and down in the valley there was some vehicles with yellow, yellow\nsheets on them. Well we didn\u2019t know what that meant; it was identification, American\nidentification. And the next things we knew was a jeep coming up, and the silly",
        "blighters loaded with fags, all they had on them, fags. So they said, right don\u2019t go out\ntonight, we're going to mortar the woods, alright, and the next morning we\u2019d made\nfriends with the farmer, two or three of us, made friends with the farmer cause the\nJerry couldn't feed us we had to go out, get food where we _ could.\nAnd er, we thought we wonder what\u2019s happened to our friends. It was mother and\nfather and three little kiddies\n[DL] These were your farmers?\n[AG] The farmers this was see, so me and my mate, the other mate stopped, with\nthe gear what we had because if the gear was left, it wasn\u2019t there when you got back\n[DL] And the gear being?\n[AG] Well what you was carrying you know, what, could make what you got, see that,\nnothing much might be over a coat, or something like that see, we got there, went in,\ncouldn't see nobody, all the chickens were in their pens, and all the cows and the\nrest of it, and | happened to look up, and they were in the corner in the attic. | said\ncome on, get out \u201cNo, the Americans will kill us\u201d. | said \u201cwhat the hell are you talking\nabout?\u201d, \u201cwell the SS will be back, will be through presently\u201d, well | said \u201cthere ain't\nno SS, they're all gone\u201d, they were that scared of their own people. Anyway, they\ncome down and we'd give them tea, one thing or another, and the kids the bit of\nchocolate we had, and we come on\n[DL] And that\u2019s when you met up with the Americans?\n[AG] Yeah\n[DL] And then what happened? You were taken where?\n[AG] The Americans, don\u2019t put this down, rotten buggers the lot, they got no\ndiscipline\n[DL] We are recording this\n[AG] Oh bugger\n[DL] So what happened when you were then freed by the Americans? What\nhappened to you?\n[AG] We had to jump the wagons, cause they couldn't provide wagons, we landed in\na town, and er, the er, there was an American military sergeant there, and we got off\nthe wagon and he took us in this beautiful new, new, barracks, opened the door and\nsaid \u201cwhat do | do with these Bill?\u201d, and that was a Brigadier. You don't call a\nBrigadier \u201cBill!\u201d\n[DL] But what happened to you at that point?\n[AG] They gradually ferried us, we got back to, er, it was an aerodrome we got back,\nand erm, we wanted somewhere to sleep and we found a guesthouse with a poor old\nlady in the, got in there and couldn't find her.\n[00:50:00]",
        "[AG] Anyway, she did come in and | explained we was waiting and she said that was\nalright, and the poor lady, we found an SS store full of food, so she had a big table\nyou, she could sit fifteen, so we found two boilers, got thee going, and in walks two\nboys with six cockerels. So | says to her can you see to these, she says \u201cwhere did\nyou get them?\u201d Oh, we said we found them walking, killed em, everything went in the\nboiler. So we laid everything out properly, you know planes and what have you, and\nthen, couple of boys had found an SS store, full of tinned fruit, cream and all that, so\nwe had a good afters as well, with pudding as well. But the old lady who was there, |\nsaid \u201ccome on ma\u2019am, your house, we're using your stuff, top of the table\u201d. Oh and\nshe was dribbling, she said no, she said \u201cno | can't\u201d \u2014 \u201cwhy?\u201d, she said the SS, the\nSS will kill you, | said no.\n[DL] So what actually happened at that point, when did you then fly from where you\nwere back into Britain?\n[AG] | landed back in Britain the 8\" May, forty...forty-four, | suppose it was?\n[DL] Forty-five?\n[AG] Forty-five, and er, the er, Aylesbury, somewhere around Aylesbury, jumped out\nthe plane and er, had to get deloused, the powder in there, this big hut being\ndeloused, all the women, Army making tea for us\n[DL] And at this point, did you, were you having nightmares of your time at\nAuschwitz?\n[AG] Not until | actually got home. When | got home, after about a week, a plane\ncame over and | was under the bed. But that gradually faded\n[DL] And was that because of the air raids that actually happened...\n[AG] Yeah\n[DL] In terms of what you witnessed, er with the Jews and how the SS treated the\nJews, did that haunt you after the war?\n[AG] No, no\n[DL] Even though you had witnessed firsthand...\n[AG] No it didn't\n[DL] Is there a reason why it didn't?\n[AG] Yes, because I\u2019m a hard man, a really hard man, what | seen, nobody would\nbelieve, I'm a hard man. I\u2019d never want counselling for nothing I\u2019ve done, and I\u2019ve\nbeen with the police, I\u2019ve been helping undertakers, but I\u2019ve never wanted\ncounselling, and I\u2019ve scraped them off the floor\n[DL] And this was in your civilian role after the war?\n[AG] Yes",
        "[DL] And during the war did you feel that you, your attitudes towards what you were\nwitnessing, at IG Farben, did you feel your attitudes harden?\n[AG] You had to be hard, you had to be hard, it\u2019s no good. | was lucky; | was in a unit\nwhich wasn't a fighting unit.\n[00:55:00]\n[AG] We could fight if we had to, but we weren't front line troops\n[DL] Would you say that the British POW troops at Auschwitz, at E175 Auschwitz,\ndid they empathise with the Jews, or, or was there this hardness which you talk\nabout?\n[AG] No, you, how can | put it, you do what you could for the Jews, but you had to be\nhard in case you got shot. You get what | mean? If the SS saw you talking to Jews or\ntrying to help Jews, they'd just as likely shoot ye\n[DL] So there was a real fear of...\n[AG] Oh yeah, you stuck to your own discipline\n[DL] Because earlier we talked about Ron Jones, and Ron Jones being scared of the\ngas chambers and you were saying the British on the whole weren't scared of the\ngas chambers\n[AG] Yeah we weren't scared of them\n[DL] But, you\u2019re saying that you were potentially scared of being shot if you were\nseen talking with the Jews\n[AG] Well yeah, they do, they would do, until they killed one of our boys, then in the\nend we had the SS running\n[DL] What makes you say that?\n[AG] Well, a twelve pound sledge hammer from scaffolding makes a lovely hitter\nmind\n[DL] Are you referring to the plan which the British were going to put into effect for, er\nthe murder of Corporate Reynolds?\n[AG] Well, it\u2019s part Corporate Reynolds, although in the end, same as | say, the SS\ngot wary of us\n[DL] And was the plan ever put into effect of dropping weight onto those you\nconsidered to be responsible?\n[AG] We did a couple\n[DL] Would you like to elaborate?\n[AG] No\n[DL] So were they SS that the British POWs er attacked on that occasion?",
        "[AG] No they, they were, the SS were great men of their own ideas, but they\u2019d never\ncome up against proper fighting Englishmen. If you were ordered to be there you\nwere there. And you stopped there. You either stopped there on the floor, or pulled\nout when you was told to. You never ran.\n[DL] So what you're saying is the British did attack erm SS, at some point?\n[AG] Yeah\n[DL] So when did the British attack and how many did they attack?\n[AG] | don\u2019t know, I\u2019m talking about in the general war now mind\n[DL] Oh okay so not in Auschwitz, not in...\n[AG] No, we couldn't, couldn't do it in Auschwitz\n[DL] Okay. After the war, you gave evidence to er, to the trials, the IG Farben trial in\nNuremberg. What evidence did you actually give?\n[AG] Well more or less what I\u2019m telling you\n[DL] And your feelings looking back on the evidence which you gave?\n[AG] Was right, yeah\n[DL] Looking back at your time at er, er, er E175 Auschwitz, what are your feelings\nabout what you witnessed there?\n[AG] My feelings are that it was how can | put it? Greed that caused a lot of this,\ngreed, | got to be better than everyone else, greed, to hell with everyone else\n[DL] Greed by the Nazis?\n[AG] Yeah, yeah, when you get ordinary German people, German people I\u2019m talking\nabout like this, cowed, looking turning around, looking behind them all the time...\n[DL] When you returned to this country, how did people react to you, to your return,\nhow did people actually react to you being a POW at Auschwitz?\n[01:00:00]\n[AG] They didn\u2019t know. | can tell you a story, | wanted to go home, go down\nCornwall, | got on a train, here with another boy, ex POW at Auschwitz, | didn\u2019t know\nhim but there were two women on the train, on the carriage, they didn\u2019t know him but\nthey just showed their pictures and the papers, and they wouldn't believe it, and we\nstuck it, as long as we could then we exploded. They didn't believe it.\nAnd, I\u2019m going to tell you this, there\u2019s a lot of English people today who don't believe\nit\n[DL] Having witnessed it yourself, having been there, how does that make you feel?\n[AG] Angry. They never told the history at school about Auschwitz, you see, they hid\nit",
        "[DL] And how long did it take for you to be able to talk about your experiences at\nAuschwitz?\n[AG] Oh, two, three years\n[DL] Why did it take you so long, and who did you tell?\n[AG] Well, in general conversation that\u2019s all\n[DL] And what reaction did you get from the people you told?\n[AG] People that had been in the services were alright, they understood but the\nmajority of people wouldn't believe it [SNEEZE]\n[DL] The majority of people wouldn't believe you were in E175 Auschwitz, or wouldn't\nbelieve what you had seen?\n[AG] They would, they wouldn't believe what the Germans had been doing\n[DL] And did you try to explain to them?\n[AG] Yeah we tried [SNEEZE], we tried to\n[DL] And did eventually, did you give up trying to explain?\n[AG] Well, it faded\n[DL] Would you say there wasn\u2019t very much interest?\n[AG] Yeah\n[DL] What did you do after the war, as a job and did you actually finally retire?\n[AG] O | was, | er, went to a factory here down at Yatonfordhigh, they got declared\nbankrupt, then | went back on the building, | joined the constabulary, went on for a\nbit, then | became a civilian member of the constabulary\n[DL] Did you ever return to Auschwitz?\n[AG] No\n[DL] There\u2019s been an international bestseller published, entitled \u2018The Man who broke\ninto Auschwitz\u2019, it\u2019s er, the story of Dennis Avey\n[AG] Yes\n[DL] What's your view?\n[AG] My view is it could happen, but maybe I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s a liar but...\n[DL] Do you believe it to be true?\n[AG] Could be, could be, cause our Charlie Coward, we heard there was an\nEnglishman in Auschwitz, a Naval Officer, Sea Officer, Charlie Coward, that\u2019s what\nwe was told changed uniform. He put on a, what we called a stripy uniform, and the\nJew he put on, put on his uniform, he said we couldn't find the bloke.\n[01:05:00]",
        "[DL] Do you believe Charlie Coward's story?\n[AG] What from knowing the bloke, | do. He was a damned good bloke to me, to the\ncamp, he done everything for us\n[DL] A lot of people don\u2019t believe Charlie Coward's story, and a lot of people don't\nbelieve Dennis Avey\u2019s story...\n[AG] A lot of people jealous. There\u2019s a lot of people thought Charlie could do, like a\nlittle god, but he was hammered down just as we were\n[DL] When you look back at this period of your life, how big an effect did Auschwitz\nactually have on you as a, as an individual?\n[AG] Well, to a certain extent out of it, but not very much\n[DL] Even though you witnessed as you said...\n[AG] Yeah, yeah\n[DL] ...the killing of Jews in the factory\n[AG] yeah, | know, I\u2019m hard bloke, you had to be, tis no good lying down\n[DL] And were you ever left with any memories of, of those killings, or of the gas\nchambers, or the knowledge of the gas chambers?\n[AG] No, you can, how can | put it, you could smell it all the time, but it didn\u2019t settle\nsort of on me anyway\n[DL] Is there anything else you want to add?\n[AG] No\n[DL] Thank you\n[01:07:21]\nENDS",
