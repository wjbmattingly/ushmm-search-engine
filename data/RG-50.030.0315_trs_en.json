        "JOEL ELKES and AVRAHAM TORY\nSeptember 26, 1991",
        "E: Avraham, we are here to recollect and to reconnect. To connect the parents, my parents\nwhich whom you knew with the parents whom I remember. And I think we should\nperhaps begin by recalling the way I remember my parents briefly and then give you the\nopportunity to tell us, all of us, how you saw them and how you experienced them. It is\nvery important, I think, to establish this connection because you are a witness and I am\nonly a witness once or twice removed. I have experienced it through your writings and in\nmy imagination. You actually were there. And our object is in this conversation is to\nconnect what I remember and what I knew with what you saw and you experienced. Does\nthat seem a very good way of going about this discussion?",
        "T: Anything you say.",
        "E: Well, L...",
        "T: You made a very nice introduction and I you. So please start and then I will come in. I'll\nstep at the right moment.",
        "E: I'll be very brief.",
        "T: Yes.",
        "E: I'll be very brief. As you know, we both were in Lithuanian. You're in my employee. I am\nKovno. You and I went to Hebrew schools where everything was taught in Hebrew. A\nunique experience for both of us. My father helped to found in Kovno which is known as\nthe. And I am just going to ramble along a little because it will give you...us both the\nfeeling or give whoever wants to see it, the feeling of our experience, growing up in\nLithuanian at the time before World War II. The extraordinary experience of being\neducated in Hebrew about the world, not just about Judaism. I remember in my school,\nbeing taught in Hebrew about Voltaire and Gerter, by the same teacher who taught me\nalso and Hebrew history. The same man was Voltaire on Tuesday's and was on Friday's.\nAnd father had a lot to do with that kind of spirit and...and....bringing the school into\nbeing. I remember my grandparents, and Sarah Elkes, my father's parents, living in a little\nsteetle in Kovia where my father was born in 1879. I remember who was sitting in a little\nback of his shop reading the Talmud where he was selling herring and to the peasants,\nsaying, \"You want to know something about your father? I'll tell you.\" When he was 10\nhe was redheaded and he started reading the Russian encyclopedia, volume one, and\nsimply when on with.\" That's all I remember. Nobody knew where he got his first\neducation. But what they did know is that he was a from beginning to end. He learned by\nhimself. He was self prepared. He went and studied medicine in Kernicksburg. How the\nHell he got (pardon the expression) got into medicine school to this day I do not know,\nwith his qualifications, but he got in. And he studied medicine in Kernicksburg and then\ntutored Hebrew to make a living, to keep body and soul together and then met \u2019Miriam",
        "Muldune who began his wife, who was his pupil and became his wife. When he returned,\nhe became a officer in the Russian army, and he traveled from to the and back again. But\none thing I remember of which will keep in...in history books, I think you are going to\nsay about him is this. He told me that in his regiment he was the only Jewish officer.",
        "T: Right.",
        "E: And there were always anti-semitic, anti-semites around and there were anti-semitic\nremarks made. And he is on record as saying, \"In my presence there will be no scurrilous\nremarks about my people,\" and getting up and walking out. And...and he....the other\nofficers knew that you do not engage in this kind of conversation in the presence of this\nman, Elkes. You just don't take him on.",
        "T: This is exactly what he told me while we were in ghetto.",
        "E: He did?",
        "T: About this service in the army, and they called him. They didn't call him. They just...",
        "E: Talked about Judaism.",
        "T: And the Jews should go out, that they don't belong here, so he immediately said, \"I will\nnever dine...it was in the... in the dining room...",
        "E: In the mess...the mess room.",
        "T: In the mess room... So he said...he came to his officer, to his superior, and he said, \"I will\nnever again step in in this mess room because I don't want to hear such expressions.\"\nAnd...uh...and to the greatest surprise of Dr. Elkes, his superior just ordered as Dr. Elkes\nsaid he would want it...it to be. That the word is not only a...a translation into Russian\nfrom the word Jew in ...in is much more than this.",
        "E: The human.",
        "T: The humanization.",
        "E: Yes. Yes.",
        "T: Degradation. Jid is this everything bad. Whatever... And he...and he spoke to me about it.",
        "E: And that is...that is really in a sense a of things to come.",
        "T: Yes, of course.",
        "E: Because that really is a...an instance of the world...",
        "T: He told me about me about it in a contact after his very serious and very dangerous\nconversation with one of the top people of the Gestapo in Kovno.",
        "E: Yes. Yes. That is the connection which I want to make.",
        "T: Exactly.",
        "E: Exactly. Exactly. And then as you remember, he settled in Lithuania and rapidly became\nthe leading physician of the town and the country. He helped to found the Jewish hospital\nin. He helped to found the Jewish school, a number of other institutions, but he. He\nrefused to serve on committees, councils, anything, of any kind. He was just very much a\nprivate person. And in this his wife, Miriam, supported him. And I remember that ours\nwas...myself, my sister, Sarah's, was a quiet life. It was a very private life. Not many\nparties. Not many...uh...official functions. Nothing of the high life that usually\naccompanies the desperation of the country. Not at all. Very, very quiet and private and\nconfused. It is important in view of the fact that later on, when you came to mind, he took\non such hugh...hugh public responsibilities.",
        "T: He didn't want it.",
        "E: He didn't want it? Both people were talking at once at this time, and I could not make out\ntheir conversation.",
        "T: He... Yes.",
        "E: And then he became a very well known as a physician, very well accepted by the whole\ndiplomatic corps, the Russian and the German ambassador, and the Swedish ambassador\nand the British ambassador and the American ambassador, they were all his patients.",
        "T: And the Japanese council.",
        "E: And the Japanese council which we will come to in a moment.",
        "T: Yes. Very important.",
        "E: And they became very important too. And he became physician to the Prime Minister and\nhis wife. And I remember one instance which again speaks to the same kind of\ncharacteristic. It was Saturday and I answered the telephone and on the telephone was the\nsecretary of the wife of the Prime MInister.",
        "T: wee",
        "E: wee",
        "T: wee",
        "E: And then she came on the telephone phone and and I passed the telephone to father. And\nhe said....this was a Saturday, Sabbath. And she said, \"May I see you.\" He said, \"Yes.\u201d Is\nit urgent?\" She said, \"It's not very urgent.\" And he said in his nice, polite quiet way he\nsaid, It is my Saturday. Perhaps we can meet tomorrow or the day after? Would that be\nconvenient?\" And she said, \"Thank you, I will be very glad.\" He stressed that not only\nthat he was not available, but it is my Saturday and unless it is very urgent, I prefer to see\nyou when I am working and not on my Saturday. This is the kind of reserve and...and\nrespect which he...he treated all his patients, and by contrast I understood something else.\nBecause he was enormously generous in his services, his waiting room was always full of\npoor people. Poor folks he saw for free, and mixed with...with some of the high society\npeople. They waited in the same waiting room, and there was never any give or take,\nany...any privileges. He was extraordinary generous with his time. Uh...He made house\ncalls continuously again to poor homes. No compensation. Just because he remembered\nthat patient and that patient and that patient.\u201d* So he was...he had this enormous presence\nabout him when he dealt with people who ...of standing and warmth and kindness which\nemanated from him when he was with patients, any patient, which became legendary and\nwhich I am sure Dr. Brauns' father, who was his assistant, commented on.",
        "E: The Interior Department of the Hospital of which your father was the head.",
        "T: Yes. Yes. So these are some of the things which...which I recall so vividly\nabout..uh...about Dr. Elkes. The extraordinary sense of presence, generosity, kindness,\nand also a deep philosophical bent which viewed the Jewish ethic which we lived and\nbreathed as the ethic of man. I can give you an instance. On his desk, there stood a little\ntablet taken from the grave from a Emmanuel. Emmanuel was buried in, and on his grave\nthere is a little tablet which is known as the... And it recalls the saying of which my father\nused to repeat to Sarah and me. And it goes translated something like this. \"Two things\noccupy, continue to occupy the mind and fill it with ever growing astonishment and more\nthan mind occupying itself really. One is a the starry sky above me, and the other is the\nmorale law within me.\" And Elhanan Elkes really lived these...these simple, these two.\nDay by Day. And in some way he combined them with a deep sense of Jewish identity.",
        "E: Because these emanates from his education, which he got a very religious education at\nhis time, where was not even schools and not even modern schools. It was a seder so\ncalled, and a\u201d which if you didn't comply with what he gave you, also with a bite you\nknow. \u201d",
        "T: Yes. Yes.",
        "E: But this is what was the very basic of his Jewish education and it kept him...and he kept it\nwith him all the years until he was the heritage, the Jewish heritage and the Jewish\nmorales.",
        "T: Yeah.",
        "E: Jewish morales. Because he always spoke about it in the ghetto with me, even in the\ncouncil. There is a morale...and...and when I talk about...about your father when he was\nin the ghetto, I'll come back to it why in the very crucial day before the 28th of October,\nwhen the great selection of 10,000 inmates of the ghetto were taken out, he didn't want to\ncomply with the order of the Gestapo that the Jewish Council should order...should not\npublish...should order all the inmates of the ghetto...then the population of 30,000, to\nreport at the 28th of October at 6 in the morning at the...at the Seventh square. And when\nthe...the opinion of the men of the Jewish committee were, he asked...the chief rabbi, who\nwas a great scholar of all faiths, was a...he was a candidate to be chief rabbi\u201d ethen to\nconsult him on this matter. This stems all from his Jewish education which was deep and\nrooted in his heart and mind.",
        "T: Yes...I...] really want to...I'm so glad to bring that out in this context...1n your context\nbecause that again makes...uh...the connection which is the purpose of this conversation.\nUh...The other and related aspect. Growing...the same tree growing from a different\ngroup is to bring the reality....day to day reality, the day to day reality of Arab's Israel\nlong before because to him the day to day reality and to which he conveyed to us as\nchildren, which he conveyed to his school which we took part.",
        "E: Well, this is why he was one of the 3 trustees of the pioneer farm, the Jewish...there were\npioneer farm....the Jewish...there were pioneer movements in the...in the...in Lithuanian,\nand there were pioneer movements of the so-called social, social Zionists and general\nZionists. He didn't care. But they bought a farm from a Lithuanian in order to train...to\ntrain their...those pioneers from the Zionist movement in order to bring...to train them\nin... in agricultural work to be...to be ripe for the...for the life in...pioneer life in Israel.",
        "T: In days to come. In days to come.",
        "E: And this was...and he...this was a non-political...it was a general farm of training in\nEnglish trade.",
        "T: Preparation.",
        "E: Yeah. And this is was near a little steetle.",
        "T: And he and I stayed there and what is more, every Friday there there was a to dinner with\nus.",
        "E: Of course.",
        "T: Every Friday, and he...the the young people came to us and my mother would talk to\nthem. And I remember the vivid, very, very well and the tremendous enthusiasm which\nhe had for this enterprise. You see he, bring brought up in Kovia in a little town. He lived\nnear a farm. He knew what...what a pumpkin, and a...an onion and a potato looked and\nsmelled like. I mean he had done it.",
        "E: The main purpose. Education....educating a new a generation of Jews who were mostly\ncitizens...of the citizens. They had no profession. They had no linkage to...to the farm, to\nland, to agriculture. And not only was he the...a trustee...but 1n a...1n a public function,\nbut he was also the physician of all the and they were treated by him...it 1s...1t 1s...\u201d \u00a2free\nof charge. No question about it. But in serious cases, he used to go there to them and call\nthem on the spot and give to them.",
        "T: Yes. I remember that. I went with him.",
        "E: And this, bear in mind, is a physician of...of outstanding qualifications who was the\nphysician of the prime minister of the president of the state, of the ambassadors as you\nsaid. But in first place he was the...the physician of the humble, of the popular.",
        "T: Yes. Yes.",
        "E: And I want to say another word. I was...it is...there was a near Godless state where no\nbefore you",
        "T: Yes. We had...we had an old apartment.",
        "E: The old apartment. I was there because my father was ill and I was there. So you could\nalways find a food pack. And not only people with very, as you said, well dressed and\npeople who came very, very poorly. Very poorly.",
        "T: Yes. Yes.",
        "E: And I want to say not only Jews.",
        "T: No. No. No.",
        "E: Not only Jews.",
        "T: No. No. He had...",
        "E: Because his door was open for every needy and for every man or woman who needed and\ncould not afford to pay.",
        "T: Yes. Yes. Yes. I remember him. And then we are now coming to a time when he\nconsulted the priest of the British Ambassador and he said, \"What shall I do for my son?\"\nHe said, \"Send him to English. I've been to...I graduated my school in...in Lithuanian,\nHebrew school. And then for good measure, I went to a German school in Kernicksburg\nwhich turned out to be a in 1929, 30, which was already was feeling the tremor of\nNazism, and I felt it very much there. I was the only Jew there. And then he went to the\nFrench Ambassador and said, \"Is there a possibility.\" And he said, \"Yes, of course.\" And\nhe wrote a letter and that 1s how I went to England and then where Sarah followed me in",
        "1937. And then he and I corresponded in my throughout the years. I went to the Zionist\nCongress in",
        "E: In 30...1n 39.",
        "T: 39.",
        "E: But it was not a 39 was 1n...39 was in Geneva. Perhaps you were a Congress before.",
        "T: The congress before. In Basil. I remember it was in Basil.",
        "E: This is a Basil. It was the 20th Congress. I was 20th Congress which was the last Zionist\nWorld Congress, before the war.",
        "T: Before the war.",
        "E: At the end...at the end actually, the congress were closed immediately because the\ndeclaration, the German declared war against Poland.",
        "T: August Ist. August Ist. Yes.",
        "E: Yeah. August first, in 1939.",
        "T: Well, I saw him the last time in 1938. He had come and visit me in...in the...England and\nbrought...and Sarah accompanied him. Your parents came. And I saw him last time in\n1943. And...uh...I still remember....",
        "T: 36?",
        "E: 38. Fine.",
        "T: Uh. ... had just been occupied, and he had consulted the German ambassador whether it's\nsafe for me to travel to Germany. And the German ambassador told him never had our\nrelations between them been bette . And that is when I saw him last at the railway station\nwhen my mother and I were...my mother and he seen me off. And then, of course, there\nwas recollects again and then the letters stopped. And the letters stopped coming and\nthere was the Russian occupation of Lithuanian where I heard only indirectly of his\nactivities and the ways he was handling the situation toward his family and above of all\nfor his colleagues and himself. And you served with him at that time. You knew...I had\nalready lost contact with him in 1838.",
        "E: But then I started my contact with him. So there is a some continuation, not a...",
        "T: Entirely continuity with him, and this is really what I wanted by way of introduction to\nyou...bring you to the point where you saw him and I only learned about him through you\nand other friends, but mainly through you and ... So let me ask you now, When the",
        "Russians came and they...and they were, of course, very suspicious of...of...people who\nwere well placed economically and socially and so on, what can you recall of that period?",
        "E: Well, first of all, the fate of your father wouldn't be much better than the fate of those\nZionists and well to do Jews in Lithuanian. They would have simply exiled him to\nSiberia. And in fact they came to do so. They came to do so in the middle....in the middle\nof the night. So he when they came to take him from his home, he said that he wants\nto...to see the...the Soviet Ambassador in...in Lithuanian. This was entirely a very, very\nexceptional case because most of the Jews when they came to took, they didn't speak to\nthem at all because they didn't have to say. They didn't have anything to...to...to...to call\nupon while Dr. Elkes was the...the private doctor physician of the Soviet Ambassador as\nwell as many other ambassadors, so he told them, \"Wait, a minute. I want to talk to...you\nmust wait until the morning.\" They don't want to wait. So he said, \"You...you....1f you\ndon't want to wait, let me call them right now.\" And he called in the middle of the night\nto the...to the Soviet Ambassador and this is thanks to his innovation, they...they didn't\ntake him and his wife like the houses right on the truck and right you go to the train and\nthis is how he was rescued from the exile to Siberia, which was the fate of thousands of\nJews which was supposed to have been my fate too but they didn't like very much the\nidea of being exiled to Siberia. So...uh...But this is what he told me when we were in the\nghetto. But....uh...to... to ...the first encounter of...of me with Dr. Elkes was in the...when\nthe order was published that Jews should be expuls...to the ...should be the expulsion of\nJews from Kovno to the ghetto...",
        "E: That was after the...after the....when the German...after the German occupation?",
        "T: After the...the...the Soviet occupation lasted for 1 year.",
        "E: Yes.",
        "T: June 40 to June 41.",
        "E: Yes.",
        "T: I mention this exile because I...I followed you...",
        "E: Yes. Yes.",
        "T: But also you see, Dr. Elkes with me, told me not only about his...his danger...his being\nalmost expelled. The same happened to the former Prime Minister of Lithuanian who was\nthe last prime minister of Lithuania, who was great pride, with great esteem we were the\nguest of honor in Moscow several months ago.",
        "E: Yes.",
        "T: They tried to get his signature on a ...on a agreement. They call it...in Lithuania. Asked\nthe Soviet Union to be...to be one of the 60th Republics, and he...and he...and he didn't",
        "want to do it. So then when the Soviets occupied Lithuanian with military bases, they\ncame in one of those nights where they called upon your father so. They called the the\nprime minister was visited his \u2019*home and he claimed he was very sick and he cannot...he\nhe...he cannot be move...shouldn't be moved from his bed. And they didn't hear...listen to\nthem, so he said, \"Here, call my doctor.\" So they said, \"Who is my doctor?\" He said, \"Dr.\nElkes is my doctor. I cannot move. I'm...If you move...if you take me from the bed,\nI'll... ..1L...1'll die.\" So the...the...uh...the Secret Police at that time went immediately to\nthe...to your father's home and they took him out from his bed. They said the prime\nminister, the former prime minister is sick, very sick, and they didn't tell him what for\nthey're taking him. So he said, \"Can't it wait until the morning? It's the middle of the\nnight. It's 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock.\" \"No, it's urgent. He's very sick. You must go. And they\ntook him out from his bed and they brought him to the...to the...to the apartment of the\nprime minister and there Dr. Elkes just... uh....just made it...he gave me a...a picture of\nthis scene that he witnessed. He came into the house. Of course, led by three secret\npolice, and they find the prime...prime minister in pajamas 1n his bed, and he...and he\ncries out, \"Lord, I am sick. I am going to die.\" And...and all kinds of...and he jumps like a\nclown. So...so he went and he says...so when he saw...when the the Prime Minister saw\nElkes, he says, \"Doctor, rescue me. Rescue me. They want to take me. They want to take\nme out of my bed. Rescue me. Tell them. Tell them that I'm so sick.\" So the...the...Dr.\nElkes in his very way, calm way, says, Mr. calm down just a minute. I want to check you.\nAnd he said to the...the secret police. They didn't move from the room. He said, \"If I have\nto check my patient you cannot stay in the room.\" So they said, \"Under no circumstances.\nUnder no circumstances. We have orders to take him.\" So Dr. Elkes said, \"You cannot\ntake him away. The man is sick. You can see the man is sick. I have to calm him down.\nYou can't...I, as a physician, don't...cannot take that responsibility. If I have to treat him\nyou have to leave the room and I want to have a private checking of the prime minister\nand not because he's a prime minister but every patient. This is the alfa and the omega of\na...of a physician. And I want to tell you to the greatest surprise of himself, they just...he\nmade them respect him. This was the inner strength, morale strength. He speaks\nto...to...to...to intelligence, secret intelligence. This is the most degraded people you can\never meet under...under the Heavens. And they had no way out but they had to leave the\nroom and leave him. And then he told him, \"Look, \u201d you cannot play around with these\npeople. Tell me what...what...what do you feel? What is the...the trouble?\" He said, \"I\njust...just don't want to go, and you must help me.\" \"He said, \"Be quiet. Speak quietly.\nBecause if they hear that, they'll arrest you. They'll arrest me.\" To cut a long story short,\nhe...they came in. They couldn't wait so...as long as Dr. Elkes because Dr. Elkes wouldn't\ninvite them at all. So they entered the room and they say...Dr. Elkes said, \"The man is\nsick. Can't it for a couple of days, 2 or 3 days? I'll take care of him and then you'll do\nwith him.\" \"No, we have orders. We must immediately report it to...no he didn't say\nwhere or what. He said, \"We must immediately take him under arrest.\" So he said, \"I...I,\nas physician, cannot allow to do this...so because he needs medical care of a physician.\"\nSo he says, \"You come with me...you come...you come with us.\" So he said, \"I cannot go.\nI am head of the department in the hospital in and patients are waiting for me. I have a\nwhole schedule for the morning, the next day and I cannot just leave the patients along.\u201d\nSo he said...and besides... \"No, you go with me immediately. \"How can I go with you.\n[...[...[ have to get dressed.\" And they said, \"We have...you have to accompany him until",
        "the border with the Soviet Union, with Russia.\" So he says, \"If I have to go I have to get\ndressed.\" So they took him back to his apartment and they took a...1t was a...",
        "T: Heavy coat?",
        "E: Coat and some...some medicine. I don't know what...",
        "T: And he accompanied the prime minister to the ...",
        "E: No. They took him and the prime minister and they wrapped in the...in the, you know in\nthe...",
        "E: In the blankets.",
        "T: In the blankets and with the pajamas you know, they...they bound him like a...like a rope,\nyou know, you see, like you take a ...a bundle, a bundle of...of clothes or something. They\nthrew him in...1n...1n their car and Dr. Elkes aside him. And they came to the train and\nthen there was a special a special compartment where it was for the prime minister and\nDr. Elkes and he...they said, \"Doctor, you are responsible for...for this \u201d that he shouldn't\njump out of the...through the window.\" So he said, \"I am...can only take care of him as a\nphysician. I have no idea and I have no tools and ways to safeguard him what you do.\" So\nthis is your duty actually. You are the security people. You are the main people of\nsecurity. And...and then this is how he went all the night long until they...they came to the\nfrontier and then they let him off and he could come back.\u201d",
        "T: Well that again 1s...",
        "E: This is what he told me when we were in the ghetto because in the ghetto it was not only\na relationship started, of course, when I was...when he was elected of....... But we\ndeveloped a very, very close personal relationship that I never before experienced in\nall...in all my young life that time. Because after all Dr. Elkes was a man of over 60 and I\nwas a young man, spokesman, and student whatever it is and what not.\nAnd...uh...nevertheless, it...1t developed such a relationship that we used to go out ina\nlater time.

And when I came back it was a\nterrible thing and then...and then I heard that the house of the chief Rabbi there are\ngathering the leaders of the Jewish community. And I was always, you know, had a\ninterest in... in...1n life of the students in the Youth Movement, sports movement so I\nwent there to listen what's...what's going on. And then...then...uh...then...uh...the\nGermans, the...the...the Committee, the Jewish Committee was formed to transfer...to",
        "arrange for the transfer of the regular, normal, as far as possible transfer of the Jews from\nKovno to the ghetto. And then there was an order in the...in the Ist of August, I think.",
        "T: Yes.",
        "E: There was an order that the Jews should nomination...nominate an Oberjude.",

        "E: Yes. But this was after the... Can I interrupt for 5 minutes. I must go in a certain place\nwhere the King goes by foot. (Long Pause.)",
        "E: So we were about...the Germans ordered we...that the Jews nominate a Oberjude, a chief\nJew, and we...uh...the...and it should be done in...in a matter of days. So on the 4th of\nAugust 1941, uh... the...the activist of the Jewish community in Kovno called an\nassembly which was the last assembly of the Jewish community in Kovno at the 4th of\nAugust 1941 at the school, and the...on the agenda was an election...election of a\nOberjude, and this was the most dramatic and the most...uh... the most historic assembly\nin the history of Jews in Lithuania. Headed the assembly was the veteran community\nleader, Wolf, and he introduced the people with the situation that 1t was never such a\nhorrible situation, that Jews are being killed in the streets, they are in masses being\ndragged from the houses and stores to the...to the prisons or to the forts. Jewish women\nare being publicly raped in front of their husbands and so far and it is a situation\nthat...uh...we are on brink of perdition, never was such a situation in Kovno, and in this\nsituation, we are called to elect, they say nominate, but we say we will elect, not an\nOberjude, not a chief Jew, but the head of the Jewish community and...uh...nobody of the\nassembly...there were dignitaries, people who were members of the parliament, of the\nLithuanian parliament, of heads of the Jewish institutions, long standing community\nleaders, not one of them wanted to get the nomination of a a Oberjude, because we had\nalready the experience of the day of the Jewish Oberjude, Dr., who was a community\nleader of standing, of high standing, and he didn't want to fulfill the task to being a tool in\nthe hands of the Germans and he committed suicide. So not one and they still make the\nassembly.... So then stood up an unknown Rabbi at that time from a... and he stood up\nand he said everybody wanted Dr. Elkes to be the...to be head of the community. But he\ndidn't want to do it because he said he had no municipal experience. He had no\nexperience. He is a physician all his lifetime, and he would not take the responsibility for\nleadership of the community which the Germans said it would be a municipality in the\nghetto that the Jews would be able t manage the all things. But Dr. Elkes said he has\n\u2019eno...never had the experience of a municipal position. But everything thought that Dr.\nElkes would be the most appropriate because of his being the private physician of the\nGerman ambassador like of many other ambassadors. And we thought that this\nrelationship, special relationship between Dr. Elkes as the private physical of the\nAmerican...of the German ambassador would be helpful in perhaps making\ncertain...uh....certain verdicts or certain edicts more...more humane. Of course, it...it\nturned out as we all know but Dr. Elkes flatly refused to become the...the Oberjude and\nthen said for them you'll be a Oberjude. For us, you will be the respected head of the",
        "Jewish community and you will with God's help we'll all go with you hand in hand. And\nthis . Those who are going in a mission can never be helped, and with God's help we'll go\nwith you. You will lead us and bring us out from the ghetto which 1s a and to bring us to\nthe home of Israel and the spirit in the...1n the whole was such tension and the\nhopelessness that the people just expected that the deadlock that came should\nsome...come out and then after the speech, the most moving speech of Rabbi everybody\nwas in tears. And then he stood up, Dr. Elkes, and he said, \"If you all think that 1t must be\nI, I am here. I am here.\" That means I am the victim. This is exactly the words, this 1s\nexactly what we...what we assumed this. And then there was a relief and each one stood\nup and...and shook hands with Dr. Elkes and greeted him and...and wished him...uh...and\nthen three young lawyers, Dr. and myself, stood up and we went to Dr. Elkes and we told\nthem we are young lawyers and now we place ourself to your disposition, and will be at\nany time whatever you may think we can do, we will do and will go. We help to you\nservice. And he thanked us very much and he was pale like... like the wall. He was very\nmuch moved but he...everybody was sure that he's...here is a man that...uh...placed\nhimself to the...the disposal of the devil actually. And then his deputy was elected,\nGarfunkel who was a member of the parliament and \u201d \u00ab was elected as the chief of the\npolice. Now this was the first meeting with Dr. Elkes. The next day then...from then\nthey...you already used to come to the offices of the commission for the transfer\ncommittee, where they transferred the Jews to the ghetto which was in the...in the\nmunicipality building 4or 5 kilometers I say 3 miles away from Dr. Elkes's house and\nstreet. And...uh...a day after, one of the three lawyers of us that we volunteered to help,\nhe was killed on the streets while going from his home to...to the and we were...and then\nthere also thousand men were killed in one day in the street of the 6th of August. It is 2\ndays after the election and also the thing was community did a...also was killed and\nwe...we were very much impressed and undet...under...scared of what's going on. So\nwhen Dr. Elkes, when he finished the work...the day he worked in the community in the\ncommittee for the transfer, I felt I cannot let Dr. Elkes go himself to his home. Because\nsomething can happen at the...at the street because the Lithuanian department didn't make\nany distinction. Dr. Elkes or no Dr. Elkes. A Jew! So I offered him to accompany, to\nescort him to...to his home. He said, \"Under no circumstances. It's dangerous. Go...go to\nyour home.\" I said, \"Dr. Elkes, I am a spokesman and I will escort you to your home.\nYou are now the chairman of the committee. I am one of the secretaries and I am duty\nbound to accompany you...to accompany you.\" But he didn't want. I nevertheless escorted\nhim. And I came, you know, I thought if something happens we...I could signal to of\nsomething happen that the partisans arrest, they can arrest Dr. Elkes. And luckily we\ncame...we came to the home of Dr. ELkes and there we saw on the sidewalk stood\na truck with German Weirmacht officer...officers and soldiers, so Dr. Elkes told me,\n\"Thank you very much. You can go.\" I said, \"No, I want to....I don't like this...this truck. I\nwant to go up and see what is in your...in your apartment.\" And we went up on the\nsecond floor...I think 1t was the third floor...the second floor, the apartment of your\nparents and there we saw German high officers are going around the rooms and\nlooking...looking on the...on the paintings in the...1n the ...between us the...the vases or\ncrystal and so on and...and Dr. Elkes in his wisdom...I couldn't understand, but later I\nunderstood. He went...he went and he says to the officer, \" Gentlemen...Officer, You like\nthis painting, take it. You like this one? Please have it. You like this...uh....this set of",
        "porcelain\u201d have it? Take it. And they didn't... he didn't have to say twice. Then he ordered\nme I should take it and I should bring it down to the truck. So I went up and\ndown...uh...brought the paintings, all kinds. They ...they...they took all the best things out\nof the apartment, and then...uh...when I went down the last time Dr. Elkes accompanied\nme and he asked them to let me go home. So they said, \"No, I should load the truck and\naccompany them to their place where the German...at their apartment and I should reload,\nyou know, from the truck to the apartment. And it didn't help Elkes's said he has a wife,\nhe has a family. Let him go. He worked all the day. He's the secretary of the committee.\nNothing! Anyhow, I... went until I brought...I went with the truck with the officers to\ntheir apartment, took it off, and I asked them they should give me a certificate that I\nworked that day for them so I can have a free passage to my home, that the Lithuanian\npartisans, should not take me under arrest, but they didn't. So anyhow I came safe home\nand I called immediately. Dr. Elkes said thank you and thank God I'm back home. And\nyour mother was so nervous and she's so upset that because of them I had to be in trouble.\nAnyhow, this was the first time that I met and I made acquaintance in a certain very\nsystematic special circumstances of that time. \u201d I used to meet him every day in the\nCouncil. And then...uh...I used to write the diary and next day I used to give to Dr. Elkes\nto read it. Now I knew of all these encounters meeting were...there was a...a...and the first\ntime 3 days after we went into the ghetto. Went into the ghetto the 15th of August. On the\n18th of October...of August, they ordered that 500 academics, doctors, so they worked for\nthem in the archive. So he said of 500 came 534 and the very same day they took them\nout of the ghetto and they killed them. Dr. Elkes didn't let one stone unturned, and he\nwent to Jordon who was the of the... He went to the chief of the Gestapo, and he insist\nthat he as chairman of the Jewish Committee must know where are these 534 who didn't\ncome...they took them from the ghetto for archives one day and they didn't come back.\nAnd he...for weeks and weeks, he went from one top Gestapo to the other until the came\nto the chief of the Gestapo, Yeager, and they told him always told him tomorrow,\ntomorrow and tomorrow never came and until they said that the Jews make the sabotage.\nThey walked with sugar and they put the gasoline in the sugar. That's why they were\nkilled. This was the first encounter, and then there's the second one was in the ghetto.\nThere were two...uh...gynecologists Dr. who was the head of the gynecology department\nin the ghetto and Dr....uh...Dr. Borshen. Both succeeded in escaping from the ghetto and\nthey found some hiding in the cities. But you know not all the Lithuanians were kin and\nwere...and they were...to cut a long story, so they were...they were the Lithuanians gave\nthem... disclosed them to the Gestapo and they were arrested. And then Dr. Elkes started\nhis...his emergency actions. In all directions as I said before, and then he came to the...to\nthe chief of the Gestapo, Yeager, and they told them they arrested the two Jews, the two\ndoctors, and they arrested also the Lithuanian who gave them refuge. And he went to the\nchief of Gestapo, and he told them, \"These are the two doctors that are mostly needed in\nthe ghetto because there is an order from the Gestapo that...uh...pregnancies should be\nforbidden. It 1s forbidden. And they exactly had to act as gynecologists to cut off\ntheir...and make abortions. And they are so needed in order to comply with the order of\nthe Gestapo, this is what...what...what he...he convinced the Gestapo because they did it\nnot because they are doctors to...to the good of the inmates of the ghetto because to fulfill\nthe order of Gestapo that forbidden pregnancy. And he says, \"I assure you that this was a\none-time people in stress.\" And they said, \"Alright, they should go...first of all, they said",
        "Dr. should go. He said, \"He himself wouldn't do. There are 30,000 people in the ghetto.\nThey needed too. Alright and said...when they stood up, Yeager, and they thought they're\nfinished with him. So Dr. Elkes said, \"No, you are chief. \u201d I have another. I cannot leave\nyou before I ask you also for the release of the Lithuanian. The Lithuanian who was held.\nHe said, \"What have you to do with the Lithuanian? You are a Jew? The Lithuanian\ndidn't take any money and he has done it for humanitarian grounds and it would be for us\na very permanent \u201d blow, morale blow on the whole Jewish that a Lithuanian who gave\nrefuge to Jewish...to Jews from the ghetto should be arrested or should be humiliated to\nthat because of the Jews. And he influenced the chief of the Gestapo, Yeager, you see,\n\"It is not good. You have him also. Let him out.\" So the Lithuanian...so the Lithuanian\nthen came to Dr. Elkes and he kissed his hands, said to do so. But the... the...the all the\nLithuanians in the city spoke about it that a Jew in the ghetto brought about the release of\na Lithuanian who kept...this is most remarkable incident. And another very important\nday, terrible day, the selection of 10,000 people out of the ghetto on the 28th of October.\nFirst of all, Dr. Elkes didn't want the...as I said before, Dr. Elkes didn't want to publish\nthe announcement that Jews...the inmates should report on the on the 28th of October.\nBecause the people will understand that the Jews...the Jewish committee, he is guilty of\nwhat may happen that we didn't know what was to happen that day. But nevertheless it\nmust not be...shouldn't be a very good thing. So... uh...then...uh...Dr. Elkes and others\ndecided they shall go and ask the chief rabbi of Kovno and then went\nGarfunkel...Garfunkel and they went...uh....and myself. And they waked the chief rabbi\nlate in the evening approximately at 10:00 was too late in the evening. There was a\ncurfew in the ghetto. And when we came to...to the ...uh... no, Rabbi the one who asked\nDr. Elkes, and he...when we came and and told them what...what this is about and he\nsaid, \"Should we...in the Jewish Committee...should the Jewish Committee publish\nthis...this order?\" And we already elaborated the formulas, saying that the Jewish\nCommittee announces the order of the Gestapo that was given by the Gestapo and not in\nthe name of the committee but nevertheless it was not still...uh...so the Rabbi was\nawaken. He was an old man, a sick man. He was in bed. He says, \"I have to think about\nit. Come to...next morning.\" And we...when he came the next morning, he was not yet\nready. It was \u201d *, and somebody looked around and... To cut a long story short, in the\nvery end, he came to the conclusion and he said he found that there was...it's too short a\ntime, to cut a long story short, he said, \"If a community, a Jewish community is in\ndanger, and there 1s a possibility that part of the community can be rescued, can be...part\nof the community and not all the community, the Jewish leadership is bound to do\neverything in order to rescue the part.\" And...uh...uh... that's why the order he says in his\nopinion, the Jewish Committee should...should publish the order, more so that it says\nclearly that they are publishing the order of Gestapo, that the Jewish...the Jews should\nreport. This was a great thing. And then on the 28th of October at 6:00, there was a\nmarch. The march I...I write in my...in my diary in my opinion it was the march, a funeral\nthat they...those the victims are ...are themselves participated in their own funeral. That is\nhow it looked like. In the morning 6:00 it was dark, and Dr. Elkes stood...oh yeah, the\nstood on some hill and looked around and could see all the scene and with his fingers\nlifted left, right, left right, Jews were sure that the right 1s the good sign. So they...they\nturned to the right and they even sometimes say...say, \"Thank you. Thank you deeply for\nyour graciousness.\" And to the left was the good sign. He stood up and Dr. Elkes stood",
        "and close, not far away from him and when there was a special hardship for a family to\nbe...to be apart...torn apart or some...or for reasons, there was a man like who was a\nveteran Zionist leader and so on, so he asked this man 1s needed...we needed a carpenter\nfor the...for the building of the airport and so on, and he could rescue maybe 10, maybe\n15, maybe 20, but he stood on his legs. He didn't sit down. We brought him a chair and\nhe didn't sit down. It's a terrible thing that they...why did I have to live up...my...over this,\nto see this...this sin. And all the day-long from 6:00 in the morning til 7:00 in the evening\nwhen everything was gone and 10,000 were taken out of the election, of the selection\nand...uh... this was a great...the greatness of a man who stood in the hardest day in the\nghetto and he tried to do his utmost to ...to ...to rescue whom he could. That was\nanother...",
        "E: I may just ask you. Then he went to the small ghetto to try to rescue a 100 people too, and\nthen he was beaten up.",
        "T: It...at night, people came to his home and said my...my...my wife was taken, my husband\nwas taken, my son was taken. So he didn't...uh...he asked to go to and asked him to\nget...allow a permission to go into this small part of the ghetto where the 10,000\nwere...were...were concentrated and this permission to take out very hard cases. And he\nhad the permission and so he went the next morning to that small ghetto. He and\n...uh...we escorted him, and myself, but we didn't...we are not allowed to go...to pass\nthe...the small ghetto. Only himself. And then only he went in... in to the mess. They\nwere all already in rows on their way to the Ninth fortress, which is the fortress of death\nwhere they are finally executed and when they saw Dr. Elkes one took him by his sleeve.\nThe other one took him by his coat. The other one took him by his...by this head. \u201d \u00ab\nRescue us. Rescue us, Dr. Elkes. He had the...the...the list of the people, but then the...the\nLithuanian partisans were escorted this groups of 100s. They didn't let him, and they told\nhim that he should leave immediately. It was a...there was a disorder of all the\nmarch...was disorder, and they told him that you should get out. Otherwise, they'll take\nhim to the Ninth fortress. But he didn't move. So they gave him...they hit him on the\nhead, and he fell and fainted and gently we run back from the other side of the ghetto and\nwe took him to a closed home ...uh... on the other side, and there he stayed for 2 days\nbecause he was beaten all terribly beaten and blood, and it was a terrible situation and\nto...to...to the great...to the great mourning of 10,000 victims, we had thought that Dr.\nElkes got from it should not...should not come up on his feet again and to go on the\nleadership. Another one was....",
        "E: Yes. Yes. You may want to talk about other conversations to with, particularly with\nGerker.",
        "T: Yes. Now when the ghetto was about to be liquidated, Elkes always tried to talk first of\nall with Giding. There was a General Giding, who was the head of the greatest slave work\nsite, the building of a military airport . Five thousand Jews from the ghetto went day in,\nday out, 24 hours an day there, and there was a terrible, terrible situation for the people.\nSlavery where people couldn't stand it, and it was the head of this big enterprise\nconstruction was a General Giding, to whom Dr. Elkes went. He...he...he finally...Dr.",
        "Giding respected very high Dr. Elkes and from time to time he used to get to free to\nrelease a group. Not only one, a group of people, and he said, \"I'll send employees from\nthe Jewish Committee to replace them so they cannot work all the time.\" And this\nrelationship was also a special relationship with Armond, the German...the German...the\nGerman director of the labor exchange in ghetto. He was and he...he was not a Hitler man\nand he used to speak with Elkes in private. Come to him at home and tell him, \"Listen,\nDr. Elkes don't do this. Don't do that or they're expecting so, and this was the man that we\nwrote after the...after the war, let us to the German courts that they should not shoot him.\nAnd finally he dared to talk to a chief of the Gestapo or the chief of the or to a chief of\nany chief of the Germans. And he dared. This was his strength. He said, \"I have my\n60...over 65 years behind me, and nothing can happen to me. He kept in his small pocket\nalways poison and he said if worse comes to worse, I will not fall in their hands and I'll\ntake...I'll take poison in the last moment.\" And this is exactly what happened. It could\nhave happened when they took Dr. Elkes to the 9th fortress.\nBefore...when...uh...when...before the liquidation of the ghetto, the Germans arrested all\nthe members of the Altestenrat. And they brought him to the Ninth fortress. It was in July\n1944. And they...Dr. Elkes was released immediately the first, but he didn't want to be\nreleased until the Garfunkel, and Goldberg, and the others be released. But it didn't help.\nThey took him out. But when they let him go, when they brought him back into the\nghetto, he immediately went to the chief of the Gestapo, Yeager and he\nsaid...uh...command them please I warn you. This 1s what he said. I warn you. Garfunkel,\nmy assistant, my deputy, and Goldberg, the member of the Altestenrat, they gave them\nportions of portion before they went to the Ninth fortress. He divided. He took his portion\nof poison and gave one part to himself, one part he gave Garfunkel and Goldberg, and he\nsaid, \"If they will torture, you...you have the...the way out. And he said, \"I am afraid\nwhen they continue talking them on the Ninth fortress my closest friend, the most\nrespected former member of parliament, Garfunkel, can commit suicide, and you have to\nrescue him. You cannot keep him there. I order...I'Il commit you at your place. And this\nis how he got the release of...of Garfunkel and of Goldberg and all of the rest. This\nis...and...and then before the liquidation, he had a...dared to speak to was a mass\nmurderer. He was the liquidator of many ghettos in Poland. When he came to...to the\nghetto of Kovno, first of all he...he converted it to a concentration camp. And then\nhe...he...uh...he...uh... actually took all the rights and all the...the...what the ghetto\ncommunity had to do, the Committee was absolutely powerless. They had no right to do\nanything. They were not permitted anymore to give...have contacts with the civil\nauthorities. And then it went...and the had to...to...and here the Red Army was already\ncome closer every day to Lithuanian, and it was expected that everyday they might come\nto Kovno, but Gerker had a order that he should...the remnants of the ghetto,\napproximately 7,000 Jewish...Jews, that they should be brought, transferred to Dachau, to\nthe concentration camp in Germany. Dr. Elkes commandant. You know like I know that\nthe Germans lost the war. It's now only a matter or days or weeks. You can save your\nown honor and your own life by postponing the transfer of the remnants of the ghetto\nKovno to Germany 4 days. And this will be not a rescue of your own life and your own\nhonor, but this will be also a gesture for the...for your people ...for your German people.\nAnd...uh...we will see to it that after the war, you will not be brought to...to punishment\nand so on. If it...there was not any single man, not in the Kovno ghetto, not in any other",
        "ghetto in...1n Lithuania or in Poland that dare speak to a liquidator of the ghetto the way\nhe spoke because they could just with one...with one finger on his...on...on...on his\nbayonet it would kill him. But Elkes dared. And then he said to him, \"For the first time a\nGerman approached a Jew saying, \"Herr...Mr....Dr. Elkes. I understand you well. But I\nam...I know... agree that we lost the war. But I am a German officer, and I am duty\nbound to fulfill orders. And it may what happen I must do my...fulfill my task. But I'll see\nto it that you'll brought to a special...special train. This is secondary. But the very\napproach of Dr. Elkes showed only a very more strength that not one in any Jewish\ncommunity of the ghetto dared, and that's why Dr. Elkes is the only Jewish leader whose\nname was praised after the... after the liberation by the First Zionist World Congress in\nBasil that convened in December 1946 and it was from a very great honor to hear from\nthe podium of the World Congress that was dedicated totally to the Holocaust to...that Dr.\nElkes was the only one of Jewish leaders of the ghetto that he was praised for his\nbehavior, for his courage for his...for his...for all what he has done and for all that he\nstood for. Now there was also...I must....before anything, I must say my last...my last...\nmy last...my last meeting with Dr. Elkes at a tiny house of Miriam and Dr. Elkes in the\nghetto before my escape from the ghetto. It happened so that un...unexpected at all, I had\nto escape from the ghetto and Pnina, my present wife, arranged it without even telling\nme. And when I got word that a wagon will come to take me out from Kovno to a farm\n50, 40 kilometers far away, of course, I came to Dr. Elkes and I told him this and we sat\nat his home from let's say 8:00 1n the evening....there was present Dr....Dr. Elkes and\nMiriam Elkes and Garfunkel, the very high respected deputy and they were great friends.\nAnd when I told them about my plans to go to...to run away from the ghetto, which was\nas I said before already concentration camp, they said...Garfunkel said, \"Go? What do\nyou think? It's a concentration camp. How do you go out? Who'll let you go out? They\nkill you on the moment when any part of the ...the barbed wire you'll try to squeeze\nthrough, they'll kill you.\" And we had the...the example of who was head in the ghetto\nwhen he was caught in the... Don't do it. You are going to do a...a suicide. It's absolutely\nsuicide. I beg of you. You have a wife. You have family. Don't do it.
