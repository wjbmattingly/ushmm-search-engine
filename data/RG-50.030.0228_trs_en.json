        "A: My name is Martin Strauss.",
        "Q: Where and when were you born?",
        "A: I was born in Germany, Leipzig, on the 14th of July, 1923.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about your family, when you were growing up.",
        "A: My family were German as far as we can research it back into the 1800s in the even\nbefore 1800. We were all Germans. My mother came from a little town named\nLuthenbeck, which is on the River Main. Uh...I know that my grandfather dealt in\ncollecting fat to make soap. We're going back into the 1800s. And my father, named\nLeopold...uh...was born near, which 1s a little town...uh...the area is called. And his father\ndealt in animals. He was a trader of animals. My father...uh...grew up and was sent into\nan apprenticeship... uh...at a merchant, and he became a merchant, eventually specializing\nin the sale of specialty oils. He had a very interesting patent as a matter of fact, a patent\nwhere he...he was the sole distributor of that particular oil, made it possible to wash out\nlubricating oils which would spill from the weaving looms from bearings where it should\nlubricate, on to the fabric. And that made secondhand fabric which the cloth\nmanufacturers could not sell. And his oil was the only oil in all of Germany that could be\nwashed out, a washable lubricant. And with it, he became extremely successful. Uh...My\nfather at age 19 lost his right leg in World War I, and because of that he had received one\nof the early automobiles as a war veteran. There was no anti-Semitism. He was just a\nveteran and he very proudly all these years until the...1936-38 wore his...you know the\niron cross on his lapel with great pride every day. He wouldn't go out without his\ndecorations because he was very, very German. We were...like I am an American today\nwith knowing what I have, we...our family, including myself, were very German. We\nrouted for the German team to win in the Olympics except maybe I'm jumping the gun a\nlittle bit, but it's interesting because in 1936 when Jesse Owens, the American sprinter,\nwon several races. I don't know exactly. At that time I was 13 years old. Uh...Germany\nsaid the black man is not a human being. They're more...or closer to animals and that's\nwhy he win and that's why he beat the Germans. That gave me an awful shock even\nthough I knew what anti-Semitism was but...uh...but the fact that Hitler declared the\nblack people animals, even as a young kid already, I smelled something that was very\ndistasteful, and I stopped routing for the Germans and when I stopped routing for the\nAmericans...Germans, and I started routing for the Americans. An interesting\npsychological thing that happened in 36. Well..uh...my",
        "Q: Tell me...tell me.. tell me a little bit about your siblings.",
        "A: Okay. Uh...I had a sister, Marion, which is 8 years younger than I am....uh...born in\nLeipzig also. We had a very comfortable income. My father was one of the highest tax\npayers connected to you name it from the highest officials in the city down to...uh...being\na...uh..executive...not executive director...on the executive board of the, which later came\nto haunt him because when he was arrested in 1939, he was arrested because his name\nwas on this roster. Uh...My sister, Marion, and I went to school in the 30s. Went to\npublic school until...I am not totally sure about the date, but I think 1933, 1934, all Jews\nwere expelled from public schools. We felt fairly comfortable in the public schools\nexcept, and that is interesting that the Jewish kids automatically sat together. Don't ask\nme how we found each other. Now we were...we were 6, 7, 8, 10 year olds. The Jewish\nkids automatically felt they ought to protect themselves. They ought to sit together. We\nalways sit together. And nobody told me who was Jewish and who was not. But until 33,\n34, public school was fairly comfortable. My father and my mother, like all Jewish\nparents, tried to shield the kids from the reality. Uh...We knew that certain things were\ngoing on. I know that and I remember distinctly where there were shops and store where\nsaid, Juden. That means 'No Jews. Don't buy here.' And I know there were often signs on\nwindows, bands on stores, 'Don't. You Jews cannot buy here\u2019. There were\ndiscriminations, but our parents didn't want us kids to know or suffer from it. So we\nbought our clothes some other places. There were Jewish warehouses, and we went and\nbought there. But as times went on...until 1936, things were fairly under cover. I mean\nthey happened, but I know that more from historical facts than from personal experience.\nBut after the Olympics, and after Hitler put on a good show and because the world came\nto the Olympics in 36...after 36 things drastically changed. Whether that was or the\nNuremberg laws or whatever that was...you couldn't go to a dentist or any other doctor\nany more, and...uh...Jewish professionals were prohibited from practicing and from\noccupying certain... uh...occupations, certain...uh...trades. We felt that 1t was becoming\nincreasingly difficult.",
        "Q: How...how do you...how did the Nuremberg laws affect you personally?",
        "A: Uh...Me personally, directly, they only affected us because...I'm not sure whether it was\nthe Nuremberg law or not, but we had to call ourselves...the boys...Martin Israel Strauss,\nadd the name Israel and my sister and my mother Sarah. I remember one incident\nprobably about 1938 or 1939 where I was on my bicycle and I made a wrong turn of\nsome kind and a policeman came and said, \"Who are you?\" And I said, \"Martin Strauss.\"\nAnd he said, \"Martin Israel Strauss.\" And I said, \"Yes, Sir.\" The identification by saying\nIsrael (coughing...excuse me please) was...uh...it didn't say Israel, it said Jew Strauss.\nMartin Jew Strauss. That's what Israel said. And of course I was guilty and I got a...a...a\nfine payable at the police station and...uh...I'm sure everybody else would have gotten\naway with it, but the minute it was Martin Israel Strauss, you were guilty no matter what.\nUh...And of course, then in 38...let's go back to 36...I'm sorry. Uh...Schools no longer\nadmitted us, or we were thrown out of schools. So the Jewish community created Jewish\nschools, Jewish teachers, Jewish learning. And we found that very comfortable, us kids,\nsimply because we were not harassed. We were not exposed to the...to the gentiles. We\nplayed football with them and me being a good football at one time created a Hell of a\nfight. Because one party wanted me as a good football player, and the other party said,\n\"We're not playing with any Jews.\" So a big fight erupted between the two football teams\nbecause the Jew Strauss was going to be on that team and they didn't want him on that\nteam. Uh...These things as kids...13, 14, 15 years...leave an impression, but they don't\nbother you. It was more important to play football, than it was the racial incident. And\nthat's how we slowly became accustomed to being...let's say...inferior people but living\nwith it. It's a system. But then many of my father's friends, Thank God, lost their\noccupation and couldn't practice any more and that gave them an impetus to leave\nGermany, thusly saving their lives. But my father and many others was quite wealthy,\nvery wealthy indeed, and he said, \"Hitler is going to go away. We're going to wait. Even\nif I cannot sell...sell my oil to many people who would not buy from me, there is still\nsome big concerns who want to buy from me because I have something very special.\"\nAnd he said, \"We will overcome and we will last longer than this nut, Hitler, will.\" And\nthusly we stayed. My father being the patriot of the family....he had 8 brothers and sisters,\nfollowed his example even though they were not that well off, but they were in the\ncountry and they were farmers and they were animal...uh...breeders. They had enough to\neat, and they were living off the farm, and they didn't need much. They said, \"If Leopold\nStrauss doesn't leave, I don't have to leave either.\" And I am ashamed and with great\nsorrow, I must say that my father to his dying day had nightmares of guilt of not having\nsent his 8 brothers and sisters, their families and their children out of the country.\nMeaning they all perished. There are 24, maybe 26. We are not totally sure. But 24\nconfirmed people who died in the Holocaust because they could not leave after it was too\nlate, meaning 1939. Uh...We have confirmation of various concentration camps where\nthey perished. They were 8 brothers and sisters, their respective spouses, and their\nchildren amounting to a minimum of 24 people. They are all confirmed. That's on my\nfather's side. On my mother's side, many of them escaped because they were smart\nenough to leave. From 36 to 39, which is a...uh...period of strengthening, growing anti-\nSemitism, growing laws, growing persecution...uh...they took away automobiles. You\ncould not own a car anymore even though I will admit my father was the only one in\nLeipzig who had permission to have an automobile because (a) he had lost his leg in\nWorld War I. He was a decorated veteran. He had connections to city hall, and he was\npermitted to keep an automobile, the only one 1n a city of large proportions. Everybody\nelse had to take the street car, provided he stands up. You could not sit down in a street\ncar. Of course, that leads to little shoving matches, shouting matches...uh...but we got\nused to it. It's a condition that...that's so unbelievable where the human dignity has been\ntaken away from each individual. A little chip at a time until the time came that you had\nto walk on the side walk and you couldn't walk on the...on the...you had to walk in the\ngutter because you couldn't walk on the side...sidewalk. And...uh...a little chip at a time\nuntil you're just totally dehumanized and become nothing. But it happens step by step. It\nisn't a process that happens over night, and if I may inject a little bit of personal thoughts\non this, the German people also were conditioned toward the anti-Semitism, toward\nhitting the people, and they weren't all anti-Semites at the beginning. They were taught to\nbe anti-Semites. There were newspapers, the Sturmer, which 1s...1 am sure we still have\nrecords of these, that had propaganda that even we, as children, laughed about. But many\ngrownups took it as...as the truth. And I...I still remember about Passover where they\naccused Jews of slaughtering little Gentiles...kids...excuse me a second please. You can\nedit it out. Uh...Where the the Sturmer, the newspaper showed Jews killing kids for\nPass...for Passover. We laughed about it. But I am sure that many other people took it\nserious and accepted it. So life was tolerable because we had enough funds, and lucky\nwe...those that didn't have any funds tried to get out. All ended up in concentration\ncamps. And we're getting...I'm sure there...there are many other periods in between, but\nright now I go to Kristallnacht which...uh...I want to retrench then for a second. Uh...We\nhad our Jewish schools and we felt very comfortable because we were together and\nnobody harassed us when we went to school, and we had a lot of Jewish teachers and we\nstudied religion where we could, but we also had a lot of Polish Jewish teachers. And\nthere came a day...I don't know the exact date...where suddenly all Polish Jews were\nrounded up by Hitler and his associates, put on trains or on trucks and shoved back into\nPoland. That day I remember quite clearly. We lost many of our teachers. One thing we\nlost our English teacher. I remember we lost our Math teacher, the two\nprimary...uh...sources of knowledge, and I remember distinctly the day when it happened.\nThe teachers were rounded up, put on trucks and shoved out. My teacher...uh...asked me\nto please go to her house and fetch a little suitcase. We were very close to the teacher.\nShe was often at our house, which is the custom you know. The teacher is the honored\nperson in a...was the honored person, was always taken in Friday night dinners and so\nforth. Any how...uh...I ran to the teacher's house and got a little suitcase and threw it over\na fence to her prior to her getting on to a truck. And I was school yard. I fetched her little\nvalise with some stuff that she told me to bring, threw it over the fence, and she had it.\nWhatever it meant. It was totally meaningless, but one of those acts of desperation\nand...uh...she went off to Poland. Somehow, it is interesting to note she escaped...uh...out\nof Poland, went to England, became teacher in England, and now lives in Israel. It was a\nmiracle happened. How she got out I... don't remember. In any event, we lost a great\ndeal of our teaching staff, and the school after that was not any more because there were\nsubstitute teachers. They were lay...lay teachers. The school didn't function like it should.\nUh...Things got worse and...and harassment was...were on the increase, but our parents\nshielded us.",
        "Q: You mentioned that before...you told me...why don't you tell me a little bit about your\nBar Mitzvah, and your Jewish education.",
        "A: Okay. Uh...Of course, like most German Jews (coughing) Forgive me...uh...we came\nfrom a fairly orthodox house. Uh...When Hitler decreed in 1934 or thereabouts...the date\nmay not be accurate...that no more kosher slaughtering was allowed, my mother had to\nmake a choice. Either we eat non-kosher food or we don't eat meat, and of course, the\ndecision was made 'no more meat in the house.\u2019 And my mother would keep it absolutely.\nNothing doing. No meat. So we became vegetarians. Again one of those conditions steps.\nIt's not difficult to...to forego meat when it is not available, but you have enough to eat. It\nwas just one more of those steps that...but with the proper resolve, my mother insisted\nthat we do not break the laws of kosher. And the reason I remember this...because of my\nBar Mitzvah in 1936...uh...we invited a number of friends. My father was still well\nknown in the city, and one of the biggest events of that Bar Mitzvah was that the menu\nincluded kosher meat. Where do you get kosher meat? You fly...not fly it, you truck it. I\nguess they...they didn't fly it...from Poland where there was kosher slaughtering, and they\ntrucked the meat for the Bar Mitzvah at tremendous cost because of freezing refrigeration\nwas almost not heard of in those days. That means it had to be slaughtered today, trucked\ntomorrow, to Leipzig to the Bar Mitzvah and a big...I'm not sure that the kosher meat\nwasn't more of an attraction than my Bar Mitzvah, but it was one of those memorable\naffairs where we had one up on the...uh...on the...let's day...Nazis who would not allow us\nto have kosher meat. And the Bar Mitzvah, of course, was well attended by all the Jewish\npeople. Many of our Gentile friends in the upper echelon would not attend, but would\nsend gifts. Again, one of those conditioning affairs. We understand you cannot attend for\npolitical reasons, but we accept that. Uh...Going back to 1939, school was very difficult\nand one day, the school is burning. I go to school in the morning. The school is burning,\nand I didn't understand it because there were no fire engines and people were standing\naround. No explanation. My father is looking for me, and my mother 1s looking for me\nand when I walked into the house, they are delighted that I'm okay. What I didn't know is\nthat Kristallnacht was about to happen. It didn't happen yet. Uh...During Kristallnacht, of\ncourse, we are aware that all the synagogues, including ours, the Reform Synagogue and\nthe Orthodox Synagogue, were burned. Some people who went in to save some of the\nscrolls were killed. Uh...Furniture came flying...during the night came flying out\nwindows, that the word Kristallnacht. Uh..People, not in uniform, but in civilian\nclothes...I remember that distinctly because normally the SR, SS were proud to wear the\nuniforms...but when when it came to looting stores and when it came to throwing\nfurniture out and robbing households and beating up people, most of these...as a matter of\nfact, I don't remember any incident where they were in...they were in uniform. They were\nall in civilian clothes. And...uh...we went home and closed ourselves in, meaning we\nwouldn't open the door for anybody. We would just wait it out sort of. Well, at...at night\naround midnight, maybe 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, a knock on the door. Solid knock\non the door. And three people, civilian clothes again, pressed pass my mother into the\napartment, and said, \"Where is Mr. Strauss?\" \"Mr. Strauss was in bed.\" And we then\nknew that all Hell had broken loose because for one reason or another...and we, to this\nday, don't know, somebody called us on the telephone and shouted into the telephone,\nThat means 'Run Away.\u2019 So some nut called us. We didn't know how real this was, but\nwe know something was up. Uh...They go to my father and say, \"You're coming with us.\"\nMy father said, \"Give me some time. I have to put on my artificial leg.\" So they were\nstanding around while my father strapped on his artificial leg, and my mother took me out\nof my little bedroom on the other side of the house and said, \"Up, under the rafters you\ngo.\" She had enough presence of mind to hide me. I was 16 years old then. And I\nimmediately went up to the roof under the rafters, kept very quiet. Uh... They took my\nfather, left my mother, left my sister. And he went to the city jail. For 3 days we didn't\nknow what was happening, what was going on. We knew the city was burning. We knew\nthe synagogues were burning...synagogues were burning. Fire engines standing by doing\nnothing. We then knew that this was an official sanctioned, government. It wasn't\nsomething that happened by coincident on a local level. We knew then that it was a\nnational scheme. I have to go back now a little bit and tell you about my father's business\nwhere we had something like 10 Gentile employees. Of course, most of these, if not\neveryone of them were members of the SR...uh...of the party, and some SS which was\nthe...like God. Uh...They were all members of the Nazi party. Nevertheless, since my\nfather was a good employer, paid tremendous wages...when I reflect upon the size of his\noperation, he had his own railroad...uh...uh...approach. You know where...where the tank\ncars would come to his yard where the oil was pumped into his tanks directly from\nrailroad cars. He had a substan...very substantial business, and he paid employees\nextremely well. Being an amputee, of course, he had a driver, and the driver...uh...also\nbeing a party member, liked my father, was beholden to him. Uh...He was a party man,\nbut not a Jew hater because he had experienced a Jew who was decent to him, who paid\nhim better than average wages. And that was the salvation and maybe the reason we are\nstill alive and we are here to talk about it. After 3 days, which is the time that they\nassembled Jews either in the city jail or down a river bank because there was so many\nJews that they couldn't have them all in...in city jails. They drove them down into a river\nbank where they could control that you couldn't run away. One side was water. The other\nside was two bridges, and they...they were hemmed in there prior to transportation to\nconcentration camps. Back to the chauffeur, the driver of my father's, he went to the city\njail and said, \"I need to extract the Jew Strauss.\" I don't know whether you know German\nmentality...uh...but in my opinion, there is a superior and there is a follower, and there is\nnothing in between. And if a superior, an officer, says, \"I want the Jew Strauss,\" and what\nwas the life of a Jew. \"I want him,\" and he took him out. He was able to extract my father\nfrom jail and bring him home, and I will never...never ever, as long as I live, forget my\nfather's face after he came out of 3...only 3 days of jail. We're talking about people who\nhave been in jail for years and years. My father after 3 days had become a skeleton. His\nface...he was unshaven, of course, and that added to...to the impression. Well, the\nchauffeur took him, brought him to our house, and he said, \"Mr. Strauss, it's time to get\nout. You have a few days. Try and get out. I'll take you to the train and we'll see what we\ncan do.\" Because the chauffeur had our car, and he kept the car. So for a number of days,\nwe...the kids...my daughter...my sister and myself, were home. And my mother and my\nfather went out, looked for visas to get out. That's very interesting because the Jews were\nhunting for visas, and the Nazis were hunting for Jews, so unless they were recognized as\nJews, they could travel on a street car or go to the Consulate and stand in line and look\nfor visas. And we said, \"We will go anywhere in the world. Just let us get out.\" There\nwas, of course, no way to find out what brothers and sisters were doing. Telephones were\ndisrupted, disconnected, were listened too. We couldn't make any calls that amounted to\nanything. And we decided we will go anywhere where we can get a visa. But no visas\nwere to be had. Who wanted us? The Swiss didn't want us. Europeans didn't want us.\nAmerica...and I bow my head in shame...history will show that America had 8,000 visas\nfor Germany in 1939, but not one single, extra visa was ever issued to accommodate any\nJews. And I don't have to go into the history of ships arriving to the States and were\nturned back where most of the people lost their lives after they were turned away from\nthe American shores. No visas for America. No visas anywhere. The only opportunities\nwere either Shanghai, which you could buy. For marks, you could buy visas for Shanghai\nand many people went to Shanghai. History will show you. Then there was Israel. A\nlimited amount of visas on the British mandate were available. And then there was\nEngland, and we were waiting for either one of Shanghai, Israel, or England visas to give\nus permission to leave. And the Israel visa came first. Two days later, the England visa\ncame, but fate wanted us to go to Israel or Palestine at that time. Uh...the chauffeur took\nus to the railroad, dumped us into a car, got us to Italy where, at the border line, the\nGermans knowing we had the passports, knowing that we were immigrating took us\napart. But taking us apart, I mean literally. They took my father's wooden leg off and\nsearched it for money, contraband. But we knew better than that, because by that time we\nalready had learned our lesson. Uh...They took and stripped my mother, totally naked,\nand checked in places you wouldn't dream of checking, and they took my little sister who\nat that time was an 8 year old kid, and stripped her. I don't know exactly how much they\nchecked her, but I know my mother told me that she was totally and utterly checked. And\nthen they put us back together again, our luggage and so forth, and we got to Italy. From\nItaly, we got to then Palestine. And, of course,...uh...that shaped my life and my attitude\nand my...my total thinking. We did not know what happened to our relatives. The fact\nthat they perished we only found out after the war. My father and I went to concentration\ncamps, Buchenwald, Dachau. We looked up records and so forth. Uh...I don't know\nwhether the following is relevant, but it is interesting because I had changed in my total\nattitude in life, and in Israel I became so aware of the fact...we're talking about 1940, 41,\n42...there were hundreds and thousands of refugees trying to get out of Europe, trying to\nleave concentration camps. Old people that had been...had escaped, especially after the\nwar ended in 44. There were thousands of Jews trying to leave Europe and get to Israel.\nThe British mandate blocked Israel and I became a volunteer, a social worker, a\nphotographer, a radio operator...you name it, trying to help in bringing in illegal\nimmigrants in addition to the fabulous training and schooling that I got in Haifa. And in\n1947, I got caught by the British again, and for 3 months I went into a British camp\ncalled, and...uh...I stayed there because I was a trouble maker, and they told me, \"We will\neither take you to Cyprus or you can go back to Germany or you can go anywhere you\nwant, but we will not let you back into Palestine.\" So...uh...as fate would have it, I had an\nuncle on my mother's side in New York who gave us a visa, and the German quota was\ntotally unused. And here I end again as a refugee in New York, welcomed with open\narms, immediately found a job, and again I became not only a...a fairly successful\nbusinessman. In other words, I earned a lot more than I ever thought and hoped I would\nearn. And I become again a social worker and...uh...1 am amongst other things, Chairman\nof the Russian Resettlement Committee of the Jewish Social Services agency here in\nWashington, and I have been active there for 25 years. And it's a privilege to be in the\nUnited States because I am...and this is what I, Iam a better American or as good as an\nAmerica as my parents. May they rest in peace. We're Germans because we had the\nopportunity to flourish. We had the opportunity to become citizens. And this is what\nhappened to me in this country, and I appreciate what this country's done for and I\nappreciate the freedom and the freedom of the press which was really the...the most\ndevastating vehicle with which Hitler was able to brainwash the German population. You\nsee it in print, you believe it. It's...it's...uh...hard to define, hard to understand, but I think\nit was propaganda machine was the vehicle to convince the Germans to do what they did.",
        "Q: Did your family come to the United States with you?",
        "A: No. My...my family. This is another... Can I interrupt for a second here. An interesting of\nthe entire story was the fact that my father found it very difficult temperature heat-wise,\nmentality-wise to make it in Israel and he became very, very poor. We had...we literally\nsold some of the belongings from my father to buy a ticket back to Germany. And he\nwent in 1950 back to Germany. He said, \"I have a lot...lot that this country owes me.\"\nAnd he had documentation like any...uh...good businessman, he had certain records\nand...uh...I have for instance the penalty...the photograph of the penalties that were\nimposed when Rath was killed by Grynzspan...uh...and there was a substantial penalty\nimposed on the Jewish people in all of Germany. Everybody had to pay 20 percent of\nwhatever he owned. House, cars...uh...not only cash, but 20 percent of what you own as\npayable as a penalty to the German government because the Ambassador in France was\nkilled by Grynzspan. He had those papers and he went back and he said, \"Not only do\nyou people owe me the pension that you promised me when I lost...and I gave my leg for\nthe Fatherland...uh..., I think I'm entitled to my pensions and...uh...we had a house,\netcetera, etcetera. And I believe and a little more research has to be done, that the law of\nrestitution was created after my father went back and demanded and had a lawyer pursue\nthe restitution. Uh...He went back to Germany. He passed away in Germany, and my\nmother passed away in Germany. My mother followed my father. Uh...My sister stayed\nin Israel for a long time. Then she joined me in the United States because I didn't want to\nlive alone. And she came to the United States. And I'm blessed with two lovely kids and\ngrandsons, and it's been a very good country to me.",
        "Q: Let me just ask a couple more questions. Back...uh...back in Germany, when you were\ngrowing up and becoming...you were still in the school, a regular public school, did you\nhave non-Jewish friends?",
        "A: Very few. Very few. An interesting thing happened during that time. Uh...In class, there\nwas a class given by some German educator who was teaching the kids how to recognize\nJewish features. Of course, that was all a bunch of garbage, but somehow or other darker\nhair and...and bigger noise and stuff like this. Anyhow, this is...I remember this\nvividly...uh...I was in a German class and he called me up and says, \"Strauss, Come up\nfront.\" He did not know I was Jewish. Okay? And I came up front and he said, \"This man\neven though he is not Jewish has very Jewish features.\" And he pointed to my noise and\nmy chin and my...etcetera, etcetera. I turned around to him. I said, \"I'm sorry to contradict\nyou Sir, but your diagnosis of me being a Jew is correct. Iam a Jew.\" And he was terribly\nembarrassed in front of the class. I was taken out of the class immediately because a Jew\nwasn't supposed to attend that class in the first place. But that was another one of those\nlittle steps that...uh...for a 14, 15 year old kid, it's embarrassing, but it doesn't really tell\nyou that...uh...some day I'm out to kill you. So in the German schools until, I would say,\n1933, 1934, we were fairly well tolerated,...uh...but as I said before, some how or other,\nthe Jewish kids always sat together. And...uh...I think I had one Gentile friend. The rest\nwere all Jewish. All the time. Maybe it's a defense mechanism. Maybe it's distinctively\nsome how...uh...and we always helped each other.",
        "Q: After school, were you involved in...in the afternoons, were you involved in scouting or\nJewish youth groups or summer camps, those kinds of things.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. We went to summer camps. We went to Hebrew school. We had sports...\nuh...which was...I... I don't think we ever tried even into any Gentile environment. It was\nthe sheltered environment that our parents built for us. Uh...We had a summer camp. We\nhad the sports camp. We had...uh...Hebrew classes. We were a...a small entity always\nwell protected. The Jewish community efforts were always tremendous. And, of course,\nefforts were made...uh...to...to give us strength to overcome the insults because as kids we\nonly had two mechanisms to defend ourselves. Run or fight. And I think we were better\nat running than fighting, which leads me to another story that...uh...might be interesting.\nIn 19...the Nuremberg laws I think came out in 1936. Uh...They decreed that every Jew\nhas to turn in every weapon in his or her possession. There was a law. And...uh...of\ncourse, many people had from World War I weapons that they brought home, souvenirs,\nsabers, a long saber they carried these tremendous sabers, and some had guns and many\nhad knives and a law was passed, \u201cNo Jew is allowed to have any weapons, any knife\nover a certain length, etcetera, etcetera. Turn them in.\u201d The regulation was if you don't\nturn it in, you can be punished by death. And if my memories serves me right...I have to\nbe very careful whether it is memory or whether it's written documentation that I\nread...some people were punished. Not only the person that didn't turn in the weapon, but\nalso the rest of the...of his family. When that happened, we all turned in knives and guns,\nwhat few guns the Jews had, including my father. That, of course, led to a...led to a\nanother disaster many years later. When people asked many years later and people says,\n\"Why didn't Jews defend himself...didn't defend themselves.\" I say, \"With what?\" We\nturned in everything we had, and...and besides the fact that we were brought up as\npeaceful people, the arguments today with the National Rifle Association vis-a-vis the\nright to be armed 1s...has much more depth to it than meets the eye. This is what\nhappened in Germany. And a free press and laws passed by a ruler rather than by\ndemocratic government, all this step by step, led to the deterioration and eventual\ndownfall and eventual murder of 6 million Jews and others.",
        "Q: When you were in Israel...uh...at the height of the Holocaust, how much...how aware\nwere you of what was going on and what...since there wasn't a lot of immigration at that\ntime, what kind of...what were you doing, if anything, that did concern the Holocaust.",
        "A: Well, the only thing we knew in 44 really, during the war years Israel did not know...or I\ndid not know...I don't know whether the powers to be in Israel knew very much, but we\nwere very concerned in Israel about our own survival. Don't forget. Rommel was within\n400 miles of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Uh...We saw the flashes of the fighting on the\nhorizon. Literally at night we saw the guns blazing. Uh...We were very much concerned\nwith where do we go from here? We were much concerned with the Arab problems. The\nArabs were pursuing the Jews and we were running around with the Haganah and the\nUnderground and...uh...defense mechanisms and trying to build things and...uh...and we\nhad the air attacks some air attacks of German and Italian aircraft...uh...uh...on Israel. The\nHaifa refinery was set ablaze and we were living 5 miles from or 10 miles from tanks that\nburned so bright that you could read the newspapers...uh... refineries were ablaze.\nUh...We were concerned with...with Arabs whether they were friendly or not. Uh...We\nhad to...uh...I remember when I helped but screens on so the stones wouldn't go through\nthe windows, we...uh...we were very much concerned with our own survival in Israel\nfighting both the Arabs who had declared loyalty to...to Germany...uh...being concerned\nabout the invasion from the West...uh...and maybe the news didn't filter up. But in 44, we\nknew immigrants were at the shores and in 44 we knew people coming...practically\nswimming across the Mediterranean on...on boats that I wouldn't cross the Potomac with.\nUh...They were boats that were loaded so they were practically capsized. Uh...I\nremember one ship, the Patria, which was a French liner, with three or four smoke stacks\nthat was loaded with immigrants that the British had captured at the...1n the\nMediterranean open sea and had...uh...brought to Haifa, and they wanted to deport the\nship...the passengers to Cyprus. And the ship was scuttled in Haifa Harbor.\nUnfortunately, it wasn't a very good job because the ship instead of sinking and going\ndown slowly...uh...tipped over on its side. It turned turtle, and when it fell over to the\nsides, we had many immigrants they drowned. Others came out over the side, and they\nslid down over the hull of the ship, which was encrusted with barnacles, and the\nbarnacles cut their flesh open while they were going into the water. At that time, I was a\nstudent at the...uh...Naval Academy in Haifa and we had passes to get to the Harbor. And\nwe went into the Harbor, and we tried to rescue some of the people that had gone\noverboard and into the water. And if you don't think that leaves any...uh... specks in your\nmind or any...uh...memories that change your life, that affect my attitude toward\npeople...my relationship with the rest of the world...uh...believe me, it does change you.\nBut the...the early indications are indeed that we did not know during 42, 3 and...42, 43,\nwe did not know what happened to the people. 44 we were keenly aware. The news came\nacross.",
        "Q: Now, from what you said before, I understand that you mentioned that you...you\nhelped...uh...when...when the ship's illegal immigrants came ashore, you helped the\npeople. Can you describe one of those events.",
        "A: Uh...Well, I will describe one of the events. Uh...Ships came and...uh...tried to...if they\nmanaged to pass the British ship blockade, they tried to come ashore at night, simply by\nbeaching the ship. And then everybody helped. Ropes, little boats. The infirmed, the\nelderly, the kids had to be carried ashore through the water, and...uh...one of the last\noccasions was a ship that landed not far from Tel Aviv, and the people crawled ashore\nand you just have to help. There isn't...there isn't any question of do I or do I not do it. In\naddition to that, I was a photographer. I wanted to document these events, and I took\nsome pictures and then suddenly out of nowhere, the British showed up from both sides\nand captured all of those who were involved in the landing, including me and my camera\nand on a truck we went and off we went to...and they took us...at that time...now it's the\nWest Bank. At that time, it was the. It was called, which was a British camp. In the\nmiddle of the desert, all it had was some tents. It didn't have any fence around it because\nyou couldn't escape. It was all desert and the only way to escape was along the railroad\nline so anybody that tried to escape would wonder around the railroad line. In the\nmorning, the British would take a little Piper Cub, fly around the railroad line, and find\nout whoever was trying to escape and run them back. Uh...So nobody ever escaped. And\nmany people did not know where we were. My parents didn't...uh...for a period of 8\nweeks, I think, had no idea where the Hell I was cause the British didn't publish...publish\nanything. And then Jewish Agency got a hold of all the prisoners list. We were better\nthan 300 at one time, and my mother read in the paper where her son was in the British\nprison camp, and she went to my father and said, \"Now, we know where our son is.\"\nSo...uh...",
        "Q: Were you a member of the Haganah at the time?",
        "A: Uh...No, I was not a member of the Haganah. I was a helper. Whether you...uh...In those\ndays, let me explain to you. Even if you are a member of the Haganah, you not necessary\nknow who or where you...you just try to do the right thing, and I was not...I was neither\nleader nor...nor...uh...officer. I was the guy that was helping. And, of course, it was a\norganized help. It wasn't...uh...but...uh...we tried to do the right thing. I was never\nUnderground. I was never. I was never or anything of that kind. I was a humanitarian\nthat needed to help because I knew my relatives could be on that boat. Unfortunately, it\nwasn't so.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you'd like to add?",
        "A: Yeah. As soon as we finish, I'll probably think of something.",
        "Q: Linda had...had a couple of questions. She wanted you to talk a little bit about...uh...what\nit was like for you when you first come to the United States and your...",
        "A: Okay. Good question. (clearing throat) Uh... You know the things that...that shape you for\nlife are your experiences obviously. I came to the United States. I had a small box of\ntools and 46 cents. I arrived in New York, and my aunt on a very rainy day picked me up\nand...uh...took me in. I slept on the living room floor, but I was welcome. I was home. I\nwas safe. Two days later, I had a job at Columbia University Medical at night and a\ndaytime job downtown in the photographic industry. I built photographic equipment, both\nfor the medical center as well as in New York for the...uh...at that time Time-Life, Time\nand Life magazine, New York Times, did all the camera repairs, etcetera, etcetera. But\nthe opportunity to come to a country...and there's one of the things I will never forget.\nThere was this little immigrant coming off the boat, has to go through customs and\nimmigration, and the immigration officer said...after he opened my passport I had a\nwhich 1s not a passport, but 1s a piece of paper that means, \"Let him pass,\" translated.\nUh...It's a travel document. And the immigration officer opening the travel document\nread my name and he said, \"Welcome to America, Mr. Strauss.\" Those were actually the\nfirst words I heard in the United States from a... It made such a profound impression. It is\nnow...this was in 1947, so that is 40...",
        "Q: 44 years.",
        "A: 44 years ago, but I can still see the man's face, just as much as I can see the faces of these\nNazi officers that came to get my father. I remember this officer who said, \"Welcome,\nMr. Strauss.\" Used my name and said, \"Welcome to America, Mr. Strauss.\" Fantastic.\nAnd quite frankly, it's been going up ever since. And...and therefore I have become an\nAmerican who... who is politically involved to a certain extent. Uh...Let us say, I am not\npolitically involved. I am involved with humanitarian efforts. An immigrant...you know,\nthis is an interesting thing. A Russian Jew and a German Jew, we're so far apart because\nthe German Jews were...were very prejudice, solid, integrated people. They were more\nGerman than they were Jews. And Russian Jews were second...second-class citizens,\nwhich was, of course, all craziness. But today if I can find a Russian Jew that I can take\nby the hand and give him part of my America and return him to self-sufficiency as a way\nof life, that justifies all the efforts and all the hours because it gives you love in return. It\ngives you...uh...dignity. You give away dignity to others. The dignity that Hitler robbed\nus, the dignity that we didn't have extended to us by the British. And here welcome to\nAmerica. This is the country where we...we simply we have to do everything we can to\ndefend this democracy to make it a better democracy. Surely, many things that are wrong.",
        "Q: No. No. That's fine. I think we're out of tape.",
        "A: Good. We're through.",
        "Q: I think they're going to put another tape if there's anything else that you want to say.",
        "A: Don't you want to show some of the pictures that I have.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: How does that work?",
        "Q: You described how these three men burst into your house and ordered your father to fix\nup...uh...his leg. You know we know your father had his leg on and your mother was\nhiding you up in the rafters. Can you describe if you can what your...what your feelings\nwere at that time and what was going through your head?",
        "A: Okay. Uh...When they burst through the door, it's like a burglar coming into your house.\nYour house is violated. Everybody is terribly, terribly scared, and I must admit my\nmother had more wits about her. They were not taking any women that particular... On\nKristallnacht, they were hunting men. Men and young men. Uh...And while my father\nput on his leg which was a big procedure. It was a wooden leg with straps around the\nshoulders and so forth, my mother left the bedroom. The three people were watching my\nfather, but didn't care about my mother. Whether they knew about my existence or\nwhether they were not paying attention in the confusion, one doesn't know. Uh...My\nmother immediately took me to the roof rafters and said, \"You stay there. Don't do\nanything. Be very quiet.\" Whether they ever asked my mother for me, I doubt it because\nmy mother would have told me. They probably did not ask her. But the feeling inside of\nme being hunted like an animal is a fear that settles in your stomach and a fear for your\nfather. We knew then that all these little steps that were taken...the Jews...to discriminate,\nthe Jews are bad; the Jews are murderers, had come to a...to an explosion. It finally\nerupted. We knew that, and...uh...the...the feeling in your stomach almost to a point of\nthrowing up the...the being scared feeling is one that you will never forget. You\nforget...I...I have a feeling that you may forget pain. Pain is something that goes away,\nbut mental...being afraid doesn't go away. It stays and I...I still remember that. And of\ncourse my mother was fairly cool and composed and I...she told me the following story\namongst other things. Uh...In order to determine whether we had played with any funds\nand taken any money illegally out of the country, they interrogated my father in one room\nand took my mother into another room and asked them, \"What money do you spend for\nhousehold budget every week?\" And, of course, my parents had all these years tried to\nsave money and get it Switzerland and get it out. That was my mother's insistence. So my\nfather when asked in his mind doubled the amount in order to account for missing money\nwhich was a good presence of mind. And in order to find out whether he spoke the truth\nthese SS officers took my mother into another room and asked her the same questions.\nAnd I don't know whether God guided her or something. She also doubled the amount.\nThe two answers, which was not prepared, never spoken before...in the interrogation, the\ntwo answers absolutely agreed.",
        "Q: Had your parents succeeded in getting money out?",
        "A: Yes, my parents had gotten money to Switzerland in...in...from 33 to 39, they were able\nto get at great losses...there were couriers that took money to Switzerland. Many of the\ncouriers vanished and never showed up again. But it was a amount of money that my\nfather being quite wealthy was able to get out and it really helped us to live on it for quite\nawhile. But then it eventually all vanished and blew up with the devaluation and etcetera,\netcetera. But he became from a very rich man, he became a very poor man and part\nof...let me...let me sing praise of my mother's...uh...was an extraordinary woman. We had\nin Germany in the \"good old days\" we had servants. I don't mean one. We had a number\nof servants. And we had a chauffeur and we had a car, we had houseman. We had a\nhousemaid, etcetera, etcetera, and my mother went to Palestine and within | week from\nGermany she scrubbed floors in Palestine and she never complained. And she never had\nany compunction about...uh...saying she's unhappy. We were alive. We had escaped. We\nwere grateful for what we had. We were satisfied. And...uh..it so happens that Israel was\nable to give me a first class education at the in Haifi and I was very privileged and this is\nwhy, again, I support Israel with everything that I have. Another story that may interest\nyou 1s...uh...when in 1948 Israel was declared a state and the war broke out with the\nArabs, there was a Legation in New York. Israel didn't have a embassy then, and I told\nthem I am willing to go back to Israel and fight for Israel because I had just arrived in the\nUnited States. And he said, \"Well, we don't have any planes...any place on a...on a plane\nto take you back. You're not important right now. But as soon as we have space, we will\nnotify you.\" I'm still waiting for them to notify me. (laughing) I'm still here. So this is\nreally how it happened, and I met a lovely young lady in Washington, got married,\netcetera, etcetera.",
        "Q: Just a couple more questions. When you were at Kristallnacht and your father came home\nand you were able to get the visas, you mentioned...you described the search at the\nborder. Can you describe the...what you remember from the train ride from Leipzig to the\nborder and then also what happened in Italy and...and your feelings about running away\nfrom Germany and going to Palestine.",
        "A: Uh...When my father got out of jail, he again was a free man to a certain extent. Business\nwas finished. He called up...it's an interesting sideline...he called up some of the...uh...big\nfactories which were really German Aryan factories that, \"I have oil...[ have a tank car\nfull of this and that. I'm willing to give it to you at half price.\" And a number of these big\nfactories says...said to my father, \"Mr. Strauss, we do not want to take advantage of your\nmisfortune.\" The misfortune of being Jew and having to leave. \"We will pay you the\ngoing rate.\" And it so happens that they bought an awful lot of o1l which they didn't need\nand they put it in tanks and it turned out that during the war, they couldn't get any oil and\nthey were the lucky...they had helped the Jew, but they were the lucky ones, because they\nhad oil for many years to come. So that's one of those...uh...quirky fates that happen in\nlife. Uh...I lost my tread.",
        "Q: The leaving...the trying to leave home.",
        "A: Yeah. The departure itself was very dramatic because when we got to the train and the\ntrain moved, my father had never cried. I had never seen my father cry in his life. My\nfather cried because...because we knew that it was the end of a total existence. A man\nwho...who was an officer who was a leading citizen, a man who was respected left with a\nsuitcase even though we had some money in Switzerland. We wasn't in immediate danger\nof...of starving. There wasn't. Uh...but we knew it was the end of an era and my father\nand my mother held each other and cried, but they're very lucky because they got away.\nMany others never had a chance to cry. Many others were separated and had to wave to\neach other, including...we have some reports...there was one uncle who picked berries in\nGermany in the woods to feed himself and allegedly either was shot there or went to a\nconcentration camp and was killed there for picking berries. Any excuse will do. So my\nfamily, particular family, was extremely lucky to have had the means. Now you will ask\nhow come you had the means? And I will tell you many did not have the means to escape\nand pay and buy their way out. My father had a big apartment house which he had to sell\nunder duress, but that apartment house was paid for and that gave us after he paid Hitler\nhis 20 percent of everything he had, gave us still enough money to buy a ticket to get out.\nMany people perished because they could not afford the train fare to get out. And once\nwe were in Italy...uh...we were able to pay for our hotel room. We got on a ship...on the\nship legally. The ship called the S.S. Jerusalem which was an Italian ship, took us to\nHaifa Harbor where we were welcomed by an uncle who took us in, who had rented from\nan Arab an apartment for us. True, we did not have any lights and electricity and it was\nvery bare. I wired the house. It was one of those little miracles that a 17, 16...17 year old\nwas able to wire the whole house with electricity, and when the inspector came, he said,\n\"That's not done by a professional. We were absolutely worried he would cut us down.\nHe said, \"It's too neat.\" So we survived the electrical inspection. Uh...But the...the\nshaping of a man's dignity, of a man's humanitarian attitude toward his fellow man is\nwhat the Holocaust is all about. If you...1f we don't learn and pass on to our children what\nwe have learned, what I have learned and...because I am very lucky. I'm here to talk\nabout it. Those that have learned the bitterest lesson of them all are not here to talk about\nit. We have to take what we can and convey and...and make sure that the next generation\nreally understands...uh...what inhumanity to man by man can be.",
        "Q: One last...uh...one last question. You mentioned...uh...you mentioned the chauffeur\nwho...uh...who helped your father and got your father out of...out of the jail and",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And then helped get them...take the train station. Do you remember his name?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What is it?",
        "A: The chauffeurs name was Berma, and...uh...he was a professional driver who from what\nwe hear became a tank or some other driver in the German army. He perished on the\nRussian front. We know that from other fellow employees that we later on spoke in\nGermany to. As a matter of fact, I will be going to Germany in July, and I expect to visit\nmy German nanny who is now in her 90s. She is still alive. I am still keeping touch with\nher. I expect to see her in July to visit her for a couple of hours. Of course, they were\nunder Russian occupation for many, many years, but we kept touch, and we kept greeting\neach other.",
        "Q: So this is the first time you've seen here.",
        "A: First time I going back to my house which 1s still...still there. Uh... The house to the left is\nbombed out. The house to the left...to the right is bombed out. Our house 1s still standing,\nand from photographs I have seen there, this is interesting. There's a carved door, with\nlion heads, wooden carved door. Tremendous door, and I remember it as a kid because of\nI was afraid of these lions' heads on the door. Would you believe they're still there? The\nsame doors 60 years later? They're still there, and I'm going to see them in July.\nBut...uh...[...1 want to say to you Germany was poisoned and Germans are guilty\n(coughing) and Germans are guilty, but not all of them. There are human beings out there\nthat still have retained their righteousness. And thank God for these. Otherwise, the world\nwould just not have any hope. So we kept in touch with most of the employees or many\nof the employees. Most of them are dead by now anyway.",

        "A: I was born in Germany, Leipzig, on the 14th of July, 1923.",
        "A: My family were German as far as we can research it back into the 1800s in the even\nbefore 1800. We were all Germans. My mother came from a little town named\nLuthenbeck, which is on the River Main. Uh...I know that my grandfather dealt in\ncollecting fat to make soap. We're going back into the 1800s. And my father, named\nLeopold...uh...was born near, which 1s a little town...uh...the area is called. And his father\ndealt in animals. He was a trader of animals. My father...uh...grew up and was sent into\nan apprenticeship... uh...at a merchant, and he became a merchant, eventually specializing\nin the sale of specialty oils. He had a very interesting patent as a matter of fact, a patent\nwhere he...he was the sole distributor of that particular oil, made it possible to wash out\nlubricating oils which would spill from the weaving looms from bearings where it should\nlubricate, on to the fabric. And that made secondhand fabric which the cloth\nmanufacturers could not sell. And his oil was the only oil in all of Germany that could be\nwashed out, a washable lubricant. And with it, he became extremely successful. Uh...My\nfather at age 19 lost his right leg in World War I, and because of that he had received one\nof the early automobiles as a war veteran. There was no anti-Semitism. He was just a\nveteran and he very proudly all these years until the...1936-38 wore his...you know the\niron cross on his lapel with great pride every day. He wouldn't go out without his\ndecorations because he was very, very German. We were...like I am an American today\nwith knowing what I have, we...our family, including myself, were very German. We\nrouted for the German team to win in the Olympics except maybe I'm jumping the gun a\nlittle bit, but it's interesting because in 1936 when Jesse Owens, the American sprinter,\nwon several races. I don't know exactly. At that time I was 13 years old. Uh...Germany\nsaid the black man is not a human being. They're more...or closer to animals and that's\nwhy he win and that's why he beat the Germans. That gave me an awful shock even\nthough I knew what anti-Semitism was but...uh...but the fact that Hitler declared the\nblack people animals, even as a young kid already, I smelled something that was very\ndistasteful, and I stopped routing for the Germans and when I stopped routing for the\nAmericans...Germans, and I started routing for the Americans. An interesting\npsychological thing that happened in 36. Well..uh...my",

My father was one of the highest tax\npayers connected to you name it from the highest officials in the city down to...uh...being\na...uh..executive...not executive director...on the executive board of the, which later came\nto haunt him because when he was arrested in 1939, he was arrested because his name\nwas on this roster. Uh...My sister, Marion, and I went to school in the 30s. Went to\npublic school until...I am not totally sure about the date, but I think 1933, 1934, all Jews\nwere expelled from public schools. We felt fairly comfortable in the public schools\nexcept, and that is interesting that the Jewish kids automatically sat together. Don't ask\nme how we found each other. Now we were...we were 6, 7, 8, 10 year olds. The Jewish\nkids automatically felt they ought to protect themselves. They ought to sit together. We\nalways sit together. And nobody told me who was Jewish and who was not. But until 33,\n34, public school was fairly comfortable. My father and my mother, like all Jewish\nparents, tried to shield the kids from the reality. Uh...We knew that certain things were\ngoing on. I know that and I remember distinctly where there were shops and store where\nsaid, Juden. That means 'No Jews. Don't buy here.' And I know there were often signs on\nwindows, bands on stores, 'Don't. You Jews cannot buy here\u2019. There were\ndiscriminations, but our parents didn't want us kids to know or suffer from it. So we\nbought our clothes some other places. There were Jewish warehouses, and we went and\nbought there. But as times went on...until 1936, things were fairly under cover. I mean\nthey happened, but I know that more from historical facts than from personal experience.\nBut after the Olympics, and after Hitler put on a good show and because the world came\nto the Olympics in 36...after 36 things drastically changed. Whether that was or the\nNuremberg laws or whatever that was...you couldn't go to a dentist or any other doctor\nany more, and...uh...Jewish professionals were prohibited from practicing and from\noccupying certain... uh...occupations, certain...uh...trades. We felt that 1t was becoming\nincreasingly difficult.",
        "A: Uh...Me personally, directly, they only affected us because...I'm not sure whether it was\nthe Nuremberg law or not, but we had to call ourselves...the boys...Martin Israel Strauss,\nadd the name Israel and my sister and my mother Sarah. I remember one incident\nprobably about 1938 or 1939 where I was on my bicycle and I made a wrong turn of\nsome kind and a policeman came and said, \"Who are you?\" And I said, \"Martin Strauss.\"\nAnd he said, \"Martin Israel Strauss.\" And I said, \"Yes, Sir.\" The identification by saying\nIsrael (coughing...excuse me please) was...uh...it didn't say Israel, it said Jew Strauss.\nMartin Jew Strauss. That's what Israel said. And of course I was guilty and I got a...a...a\nfine payable at the police station and...uh...I'm sure everybody else would have gotten\naway with it, but the minute it was Martin Israel Strauss, you were guilty no matter what.\nUh...And of course, then in 38...let's go back to 36...I'm sorry. Uh...Schools no longer\nadmitted us, or we were thrown out of schools. So the Jewish community created Jewish\nschools, Jewish teachers, Jewish learning. And we found that very comfortable, us kids,\nsimply because we were not harassed. We were not exposed to the...to the gentiles. We\nplayed football with them and me being a good football at one time created a Hell of a\nfight. Because one party wanted me as a good football player, and the other party said,\n\"We're not playing with any Jews.\" So a big fight erupted between the two football teams\nbecause the Jew Strauss was going to be on that team and they didn't want him on that\nteam. Uh...These things as kids...13, 14, 15 years...leave an impression, but they don't\nbother you. It was more important to play football, than it was the racial incident. And\nthat's how we slowly became accustomed to being...let's say...inferior people but living\nwith it. It's a system. But then many of my father's friends, Thank God, lost their\noccupation and couldn't practice any more and that gave them an impetus to leave\nGermany, thusly saving their lives. But my father and many others was quite wealthy,\nvery wealthy indeed, and he said, \"Hitler is going to go away. We're going to wait. Even\nif I cannot sell...sell my oil to many people who would not buy from me, there is still\nsome big concerns who want to buy from me because I have something very special.\"\nAnd he said, \"We will overcome and we will last longer than this nut, Hitler, will.\" And\nthusly we stayed. My father being the patriot of the family....he had 8 brothers and sisters,\nfollowed his example even though they were not that well off, but they were in the\ncountry and they were farmers and they were animal...uh...breeders. They had enough to\neat, and they were living off the farm, and they didn't need much. They said, \"If Leopold\nStrauss doesn't leave, I don't have to leave either.\" And I am ashamed and with great\nsorrow, I must say that my father to his dying day had nightmares of guilt of not having\nsent his 8 brothers and sisters, their families and their children out of the country.\nMeaning they all perished. There are 24, maybe 26. We are not totally sure. But 24\nconfirmed people who died in the Holocaust because they could not leave after it was too\nlate, meaning 1939. Uh...We have confirmation of various concentration camps where\nthey perished. They were 8 brothers and sisters, their respective spouses, and their\nchildren amounting to a minimum of 24 people. They are all confirmed. That's on my\nfather's side. On my mother's side, many of them escaped because they were smart\nenough to leave. From 36 to 39, which is a...uh...period of strengthening, growing anti-\nSemitism, growing laws, growing persecution...uh...they took away automobiles. You\ncould not own a car anymore even though I will admit my father was the only one in\nLeipzig who had permission to have an automobile because (a) he had lost his leg in\nWorld War I. He was a decorated veteran. He had connections to city hall, and he was\npermitted to keep an automobile, the only one 1n a city of large proportions. Everybody\nelse had to take the street car, provided he stands up. You could not sit down in a street\ncar. Of course, that leads to little shoving matches, shouting matches...uh...but we got\nused to it. It's a condition that...that's so unbelievable where the human dignity has been\ntaken away from each individual. A little chip at a time until the time came that you had\nto walk on the side walk and you couldn't walk on the...on the...you had to walk in the\ngutter because you couldn't walk on the side...sidewalk. And...uh...a little chip at a time\nuntil you're just totally dehumanized and become nothing. But it happens step by step. It\nisn't a process that happens over night, and if I may inject a little bit of personal thoughts\non this, the German people also were conditioned toward the anti-Semitism, toward\nhitting the people, and they weren't all anti-Semites at the beginning. They were taught to\nbe anti-Semites. There were newspapers, the Sturmer, which 1s...1 am sure we still have\nrecords of these, that had propaganda that even we, as children, laughed about. But many\ngrownups took it as...as the truth. And I...I still remember about Passover where they\naccused Jews of slaughtering little Gentiles...kids...excuse me a second please. You can\nedit it out. Uh...Where the the Sturmer, the newspaper showed Jews killing kids for\nPass...for Passover. We laughed about it. But I am sure that many other people took it\nserious and accepted it. So life was tolerable because we had enough funds, and lucky\nwe...those that didn't have any funds tried to get out. All ended up in concentration\ncamps. And we're getting...I'm sure there...there are many other periods in between, but\nright now I go to Kristallnacht which...uh...I want to retrench then for a second. Uh...We\nhad our Jewish schools and we felt very comfortable because we were together and\nnobody harassed us when we went to school, and we had a lot of Jewish teachers and we\nstudied religion where we could, but we also had a lot of Polish Jewish teachers. And\nthere came a day...I don't know the exact date...where suddenly all Polish Jews were\nrounded up by Hitler and his associates, put on trains or on trucks and shoved back into\nPoland. That day I remember quite clearly. We lost many of our teachers. One thing we\nlost our English teacher. I remember we lost our Math teacher, the two\nprimary...uh...sources of knowledge, and I remember distinctly the day when it happened.\nThe teachers were rounded up, put on trucks and shoved out. My teacher...uh...asked me\nto please go to her house and fetch a little suitcase. We were very close to the teacher.\nShe was often at our house, which is the custom you know. The teacher is the honored\nperson in a...was the honored person, was always taken in Friday night dinners and so\nforth. Any how...uh...I ran to the teacher's house and got a little suitcase and threw it over\na fence to her prior to her getting on to a truck. And I was school yard. I fetched her little\nvalise with some stuff that she told me to bring, threw it over the fence, and she had it.\nWhatever it meant. It was totally meaningless, but one of those acts of desperation\nand...uh...she went off to Poland. Somehow, it is interesting to note she escaped...uh...out\nof Poland, went to England, became teacher in England, and now lives in Israel. It was a\nmiracle happened. How she got out I... don't remember. In any event, we lost a great\ndeal of our teaching staff, and the school after that was not any more because there were\nsubstitute teachers. They were lay...lay teachers. The school didn't function like it should.\nUh...Things got worse and...and harassment was...were on the increase, but our parents\nshielded us.",
        "A: Okay. Uh...Of course, like most German Jews (coughing) Forgive me...uh...we came\nfrom a fairly orthodox house. Uh...When Hitler decreed in 1934 or thereabouts...the date\nmay not be accurate...that no more kosher slaughtering was allowed, my mother had to\nmake a choice. Either we eat non-kosher food or we don't eat meat, and of course, the\ndecision was made 'no more meat in the house.\u2019 And my mother would keep it absolutely.\nNothing doing. No meat. So we became vegetarians. Again one of those conditions steps.\nIt's not difficult to...to forego meat when it is not available, but you have enough to eat. It\nwas just one more of those steps that...but with the proper resolve, my mother insisted\nthat we do not break the laws of kosher. And the reason I remember this...because of my\nBar Mitzvah in 1936...uh...we invited a number of friends. My father was still well\nknown in the city, and one of the biggest events of that Bar Mitzvah was that the menu\nincluded kosher meat. Where do you get kosher meat? You fly...not fly it, you truck it. I\nguess they...they didn't fly it...from Poland where there was kosher slaughtering, and they\ntrucked the meat for the Bar Mitzvah at tremendous cost because of freezing refrigeration\nwas almost not heard of in those days. That means it had to be slaughtered today, trucked\ntomorrow, to Leipzig to the Bar Mitzvah and a big...I'm not sure that the kosher meat\nwasn't more of an attraction than my Bar Mitzvah, but it was one of those memorable\naffairs where we had one up on the...uh...on the...let's day...Nazis who would not allow us\nto have kosher meat. And the Bar Mitzvah, of course, was well attended by all the Jewish\npeople. Many of our Gentile friends in the upper echelon would not attend, but would\nsend gifts. Again, one of those conditioning affairs. We understand you cannot attend for\npolitical reasons, but we accept that. Uh...Going back to 1939, school was very difficult\nand one day, the school is burning. I go to school in the morning. The school is burning,\nand I didn't understand it because there were no fire engines and people were standing\naround. No explanation. My father is looking for me, and my mother 1s looking for me\nand when I walked into the house, they are delighted that I'm okay. What I didn't know is\nthat Kristallnacht was about to happen. It didn't happen yet. Uh...During Kristallnacht, of\ncourse, we are aware that all the synagogues, including ours, the Reform Synagogue and\nthe Orthodox Synagogue, were burned. Some people who went in to save some of the\nscrolls were killed. Uh...Furniture came flying...during the night came flying out\nwindows, that the word Kristallnacht. Uh..People, not in uniform, but in civilian\nclothes...I remember that distinctly because normally the SR, SS were proud to wear the\nuniforms...but when when it came to looting stores and when it came to throwing\nfurniture out and robbing households and beating up people, most of these...as a matter of\nfact, I don't remember any incident where they were in...they were in uniform. They were\nall in civilian clothes. And...uh...we went home and closed ourselves in, meaning we\nwouldn't open the door for anybody. We would just wait it out sort of. Well, at...at night\naround midnight, maybe 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, a knock on the door. Solid knock\non the door. And three people, civilian clothes again, pressed pass my mother into the\napartment, and said, \"Where is Mr. Strauss?\" \"Mr. Strauss was in bed.\" And we then\nknew that all Hell had broken loose because for one reason or another...and we, to this\nday, don't know, somebody called us on the telephone and shouted into the telephone,\nThat means 'Run Away.\u2019 So some nut called us. We didn't know how real this was, but\nwe know something was up. Uh...They go to my father and say, \"You're coming with us.\"\nMy father said, \"Give me some time. I have to put on my artificial leg.\" So they were\nstanding around while my father strapped on his artificial leg, and my mother took me out\nof my little bedroom on the other side of the house and said, \"Up, under the rafters you\ngo.\" She had enough presence of mind to hide me. I was 16 years old then. And I\nimmediately went up to the roof under the rafters, kept very quiet. Uh... They took my\nfather, left my mother, left my sister. And he went to the city jail. For 3 days we didn't\nknow what was happening, what was going on. We knew the city was burning. We knew\nthe synagogues were burning...synagogues were burning. Fire engines standing by doing\nnothing. We then knew that this was an official sanctioned, government. It wasn't\nsomething that happened by coincident on a local level. We knew then that it was a\nnational scheme. I have to go back now a little bit and tell you about my father's business\nwhere we had something like 10 Gentile employees. Of course, most of these, if not\neveryone of them were members of the SR...uh...of the party, and some SS which was\nthe...like God. Uh...They were all members of the Nazi party. Nevertheless, since my\nfather was a good employer, paid tremendous wages...when I reflect upon the size of his\noperation, he had his own railroad...uh...uh...approach. You know where...where the tank\ncars would come to his yard where the oil was pumped into his tanks directly from\nrailroad cars. He had a substan...very substantial business, and he paid employees\nextremely well. Being an amputee, of course, he had a driver, and the driver...uh...also\nbeing a party member, liked my father, was beholden to him. Uh...He was a party man,\nbut not a Jew hater because he had experienced a Jew who was decent to him, who paid\nhim better than average wages. And that was the salvation and maybe the reason we are\nstill alive and we are here to talk about it. After 3 days, which is the time that they\nassembled Jews either in the city jail or down a river bank because there was so many\nJews that they couldn't have them all in...in city jails. They drove them down into a river\nbank where they could control that you couldn't run away. One side was water. The other\nside was two bridges, and they...they were hemmed in there prior to transportation to\nconcentration camps. Back to the chauffeur, the driver of my father's, he went to the city\njail and said, \"I need to extract the Jew Strauss.\" I don't know whether you know German\nmentality...uh...but in my opinion, there is a superior and there is a follower, and there is\nnothing in between. And if a superior, an officer, says, \"I want the Jew Strauss,\" and what\nwas the life of a Jew. \"I want him,\" and he took him out. He was able to extract my father\nfrom jail and bring him home, and I will never...never ever, as long as I live, forget my\nfather's face after he came out of 3...only 3 days of jail. We're talking about people who\nhave been in jail for years and years. My father after 3 days had become a skeleton. His\nface...he was unshaven, of course, and that added to...to the impression. Well, the\nchauffeur took him, brought him to our house, and he said, \"Mr. Strauss, it's time to get\nout. You have a few days. Try and get out. I'll take you to the train and we'll see what we\ncan do.\" Because the chauffeur had our car, and he kept the car. So for a number of days,\nwe...the kids...my daughter...my sister and myself, were home. And my mother and my\nfather went out, looked for visas to get out. That's very interesting because the Jews were\nhunting for visas, and the Nazis were hunting for Jews, so unless they were recognized as\nJews, they could travel on a street car or go to the Consulate and stand in line and look\nfor visas. And we said, \"We will go anywhere in the world. Just let us get out.\" There\nwas, of course, no way to find out what brothers and sisters were doing. Telephones were\ndisrupted, disconnected, were listened too. We couldn't make any calls that amounted to\nanything. And we decided we will go anywhere where we can get a visa. But no visas\nwere to be had. Who wanted us? The Swiss didn't want us. Europeans didn't want us.\nAmerica...and I bow my head in shame...history will show that America had 8,000 visas\nfor Germany in 1939, but not one single, extra visa was ever issued to accommodate any\nJews. And I don't have to go into the history of ships arriving to the States and were\nturned back where most of the people lost their lives after they were turned away from\nthe American shores. No visas for America. No visas anywhere. The only opportunities\nwere either Shanghai, which you could buy. For marks, you could buy visas for Shanghai\nand many people went to Shanghai. History will show you. Then there was Israel. A\nlimited amount of visas on the British mandate were available. And then there was\nEngland, and we were waiting for either one of Shanghai, Israel, or England visas to give\nus permission to leave. And the Israel visa came first. Two days later, the England visa\ncame, but fate wanted us to go to Israel or Palestine at that time. Uh...the chauffeur took\nus to the railroad, dumped us into a car, got us to Italy where, at the border line, the\nGermans knowing we had the passports, knowing that we were immigrating took us\napart. But taking us apart, I mean literally. They took my father's wooden leg off and\nsearched it for money, contraband. But we knew better than that, because by that time we\nalready had learned our lesson. Uh...They took and stripped my mother, totally naked,\nand checked in places you wouldn't dream of checking, and they took my little sister who\nat that time was an 8 year old kid, and stripped her. I don't know exactly how much they\nchecked her, but I know my mother told me that she was totally and utterly checked. And\nthen they put us back together again, our luggage and so forth, and we got to Italy. From\nItaly, we got to then Palestine. And, of course,...uh...that shaped my life and my attitude\nand my...my total thinking. We did not know what happened to our relatives. The fact\nthat they perished we only found out after the war. My father and I went to concentration\ncamps, Buchenwald, Dachau. We looked up records and so forth. Uh...I don't know\nwhether the following is relevant, but it is interesting because I had changed in my total\nattitude in life, and in Israel I became so aware of the fact...we're talking about 1940, 41,\n42...there were hundreds and thousands of refugees trying to get out of Europe, trying to\nleave concentration camps. Old people that had been...had escaped, especially after the\nwar ended in 44. There were thousands of Jews trying to leave Europe and get to Israel.\nThe British mandate blocked Israel and I became a volunteer, a social worker, a\nphotographer, a radio operator...you name it, trying to help in bringing in illegal\nimmigrants in addition to the fabulous training and schooling that I got in Haifa. And in\n1947, I got caught by the British again, and for 3 months I went into a British camp\ncalled, and...uh...I stayed there because I was a trouble maker, and they told me, \"We will\neither take you to Cyprus or you can go back to Germany or you can go anywhere you\nwant, but we will not let you back into Palestine.\" So...uh...as fate would have it, I had an\nuncle on my mother's side in New York who gave us a visa, and the German quota was\ntotally unused. And here I end again as a refugee in New York, welcomed with open\narms, immediately found a job, and again I became not only a...a fairly successful\nbusinessman. In other words, I earned a lot more than I ever thought and hoped I would\nearn. And I become again a social worker and...uh...1 am amongst other things, Chairman\nof the Russian Resettlement Committee of the Jewish Social Services agency here in\nWashington, and I have been active there for 25 years. And it's a privilege to be in the\nUnited States because I am...and this is what I, Iam a better American or as good as an\nAmerica as my parents. May they rest in peace. We're Germans because we had the\nopportunity to flourish. We had the opportunity to become citizens. And this is what\nhappened to me in this country, and I appreciate what this country's done for and I\nappreciate the freedom and the freedom of the press which was really the...the most\ndevastating vehicle with which Hitler was able to brainwash the German population. You\nsee it in print, you believe it. It's...it's...uh...hard to define, hard to understand, but I think\nit was propaganda machine was the vehicle to convince the Germans to do what they did.",
        "A: No. My...my family. This is another... Can I interrupt for a second here. An interesting of\nthe entire story was the fact that my father found it very difficult temperature heat-wise,\nmentality-wise to make it in Israel and he became very, very poor. We had...we literally\nsold some of the belongings from my father to buy a ticket back to Germany. And he\nwent in 1950 back to Germany. He said, \"I have a lot...lot that this country owes me.\"\nAnd he had documentation like any...uh...good businessman, he had certain records\nand...uh...I have for instance the penalty...the photograph of the penalties that were\nimposed when Rath was killed by Grynzspan...uh...and there was a substantial penalty\nimposed on the Jewish people in all of Germany. Everybody had to pay 20 percent of\nwhatever he owned. House, cars...uh...not only cash, but 20 percent of what you own as\npayable as a penalty to the German government because the Ambassador in France was\nkilled by Grynzspan. He had those papers and he went back and he said, \"Not only do\nyou people owe me the pension that you promised me when I lost...and I gave my leg for\nthe Fatherland...uh..., I think I'm entitled to my pensions and...uh...we had a house,\netcetera, etcetera. And I believe and a little more research has to be done, that the law of\nrestitution was created after my father went back and demanded and had a lawyer pursue\nthe restitution. Uh...He went back to Germany. He passed away in Germany, and my\nmother passed away in Germany. My mother followed my father. Uh...My sister stayed\nin Israel for a long time. Then she joined me in the United States because I didn't want to\nlive alone. And she came to the United States. And I'm blessed with two lovely kids and\ngrandsons, and it's been a very good country to me.",
        "A: Very few. Very few. An interesting thing happened during that time. Uh...In class, there\nwas a class given by some German educator who was teaching the kids how to recognize\nJewish features. Of course, that was all a bunch of garbage, but somehow or other darker\nhair and...and bigger noise and stuff like this. Anyhow, this is...I remember this\nvividly...uh...I was in a German class and he called me up and says, \"Strauss, Come up\nfront.\" He did not know I was Jewish. Okay? And I came up front and he said, \"This man\neven though he is not Jewish has very Jewish features.\" And he pointed to my noise and\nmy chin and my...etcetera, etcetera. I turned around to him. I said, \"I'm sorry to contradict\nyou Sir, but your diagnosis of me being a Jew is correct. Iam a Jew.\" And he was terribly\nembarrassed in front of the class. I was taken out of the class immediately because a Jew\nwasn't supposed to attend that class in the first place. But that was another one of those\nlittle steps that...uh...for a 14, 15 year old kid, it's embarrassing, but it doesn't really tell\nyou that...uh...some day I'm out to kill you. So in the German schools until, I would say,\n1933, 1934, we were fairly well tolerated,...uh...but as I said before, some how or other,\nthe Jewish kids always sat together. And...uh...I think I had one Gentile friend. The rest\nwere all Jewish. All the time. Maybe it's a defense mechanism. Maybe it's distinctively\nsome how...uh...and we always helped each other.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. We went to summer camps. We went to Hebrew school. We had sports...\nuh...which was...I... I don't think we ever tried even into any Gentile environment. It was\nthe sheltered environment that our parents built for us. Uh...We had a summer camp. We\nhad the sports camp. We had...uh...Hebrew classes. We were a...a small entity always\nwell protected. The Jewish community efforts were always tremendous. And, of course,\nefforts were made...uh...to...to give us strength to overcome the insults because as kids we\nonly had two mechanisms to defend ourselves. Run or fight. And I think we were better\nat running than fighting, which leads me to another story that...uh...might be interesting.\nIn 19...the Nuremberg laws I think came out in 1936. Uh...They decreed that every Jew\nhas to turn in every weapon in his or her possession. There was a law. And...uh...of\ncourse, many people had from World War I weapons that they brought home, souvenirs,\nsabers, a long saber they carried these tremendous sabers, and some had guns and many\nhad knives and a law was passed, \u201cNo Jew is allowed to have any weapons, any knife\nover a certain length, etcetera, etcetera. Turn them in.\u201d The regulation was if you don't\nturn it in, you can be punished by death. And if my memories serves me right...I have to\nbe very careful whether it is memory or whether it's written documentation that I\nread...some people were punished. Not only the person that didn't turn in the weapon, but\nalso the rest of the...of his family. When that happened, we all turned in knives and guns,\nwhat few guns the Jews had, including my father. That, of course, led to a...led to a\nanother disaster many years later. When people asked many years later and people says,\n\"Why didn't Jews defend himself...didn't defend themselves.\" I say, \"With what?\" We\nturned in everything we had, and...and besides the fact that we were brought up as\npeaceful people, the arguments today with the National Rifle Association vis-a-vis the\nright to be armed 1s...has much more depth to it than meets the eye. This is what\nhappened in Germany. And a free press and laws passed by a ruler rather than by\ndemocratic government, all this step by step, led to the deterioration and eventual\ndownfall and eventual murder of 6 million Jews and others.",
        "A: Well, the only thing we knew in 44 really, during the war years Israel did not know...or I\ndid not know...I don't know whether the powers to be in Israel knew very much, but we\nwere very concerned in Israel about our own survival. Don't forget. Rommel was within\n400 miles of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Uh...We saw the flashes of the fighting on the\nhorizon. Literally at night we saw the guns blazing. Uh...We were very much concerned\nwith where do we go from here? We were much concerned with the Arab problems. The\nArabs were pursuing the Jews and we were running around with the Haganah and the\nUnderground and...uh...defense mechanisms and trying to build things and...uh...and we\nhad the air attacks some air attacks of German and Italian aircraft...uh...uh...on Israel. The\nHaifa refinery was set ablaze and we were living 5 miles from or 10 miles from tanks that\nburned so bright that you could read the newspapers...uh... refineries were ablaze.\nUh...We were concerned with...with Arabs whether they were friendly or not. Uh...We\nhad to...uh...I remember when I helped but screens on so the stones wouldn't go through\nthe windows, we...uh...we were very much concerned with our own survival in Israel\nfighting both the Arabs who had declared loyalty to...to Germany...uh...being concerned\nabout the invasion from the West...uh...and maybe the news didn't filter up. But in 44, we\nknew immigrants were at the shores and in 44 we knew people coming...practically\nswimming across the Mediterranean on...on boats that I wouldn't cross the Potomac with.\nUh...They were boats that were loaded so they were practically capsized. Uh...I\nremember one ship, the Patria, which was a French liner, with three or four smoke stacks\nthat was loaded with immigrants that the British had captured at the...1n the\nMediterranean open sea and had...uh...brought to Haifa, and they wanted to deport the\nship...the passengers to Cyprus. And the ship was scuttled in Haifa Harbor.\nUnfortunately, it wasn't a very good job because the ship instead of sinking and going\ndown slowly...uh...tipped over on its side. It turned turtle, and when it fell over to the\nsides, we had many immigrants they drowned. Others came out over the side, and they\nslid down over the hull of the ship, which was encrusted with barnacles, and the\nbarnacles cut their flesh open while they were going into the water. At that time, I was a\nstudent at the...uh...Naval Academy in Haifa and we had passes to get to the Harbor. And\nwe went into the Harbor, and we tried to rescue some of the people that had gone\noverboard and into the water. And if you don't think that leaves any...uh... specks in your\nmind or any...uh...memories that change your life, that affect my attitude toward\npeople...my relationship with the rest of the world...uh...believe me, it does change you.\nBut the...the early indications are indeed that we did not know during 42, 3 and...42, 43,\nwe did not know what happened to the people. 44 we were keenly aware. The news came\nacross.",
        "A: Uh...Well, I will describe one of the events. Uh...Ships came and...uh...tried to...if they\nmanaged to pass the British ship blockade, they tried to come ashore at night, simply by\nbeaching the ship. And then everybody helped. Ropes, little boats. The infirmed, the\nelderly, the kids had to be carried ashore through the water, and...uh...one of the last\noccasions was a ship that landed not far from Tel Aviv, and the people crawled ashore\nand you just have to help. There isn't...there isn't any question of do I or do I not do it. In\naddition to that, I was a photographer. I wanted to document these events, and I took\nsome pictures and then suddenly out of nowhere, the British showed up from both sides\nand captured all of those who were involved in the landing, including me and my camera\nand on a truck we went and off we went to...and they took us...at that time...now it's the\nWest Bank. At that time, it was the. It was called, which was a British camp. In the\nmiddle of the desert, all it had was some tents. It didn't have any fence around it because\nyou couldn't escape. It was all desert and the only way to escape was along the railroad\nline so anybody that tried to escape would wonder around the railroad line. In the\nmorning, the British would take a little Piper Cub, fly around the railroad line, and find\nout whoever was trying to escape and run them back. Uh...So nobody ever escaped. And\nmany people did not know where we were. My parents didn't...uh...for a period of 8\nweeks, I think, had no idea where the Hell I was cause the British didn't publish...publish\nanything. And then Jewish Agency got a hold of all the prisoners list. We were better\nthan 300 at one time, and my mother read in the paper where her son was in the British\nprison camp, and she went to my father and said, \"Now, we know where our son is.\"\nSo...uh...",
        "A: Uh...No, I was not a member of the Haganah. I was a helper. Whether you...uh...In those\ndays, let me explain to you. Even if you are a member of the Haganah, you not necessary\nknow who or where you...you just try to do the right thing, and I was not...I was neither\nleader nor...nor...uh...officer. I was the guy that was helping. And, of course, it was a\norganized help. It wasn't...uh...but...uh...we tried to do the right thing. I was never\nUnderground. I was never. I was never or anything of that kind. I was a humanitarian\nthat needed to help because I knew my relatives could be on that boat. Unfortunately, it\nwasn't so.",
        "A: Yeah. As soon as we finish, I'll probably think of something.",
        "A: Okay. Good question. (clearing throat) Uh... You know the things that...that shape you for\nlife are your experiences obviously. I came to the United States. I had a small box of\ntools and 46 cents. I arrived in New York, and my aunt on a very rainy day picked me up\nand...uh...took me in. I slept on the living room floor, but I was welcome. I was home. I\nwas safe. Two days later, I had a job at Columbia University Medical at night and a\ndaytime job downtown in the photographic industry. I built photographic equipment, both\nfor the medical center as well as in New York for the...uh...at that time Time-Life, Time\nand Life magazine, New York Times, did all the camera repairs, etcetera, etcetera. But\nthe opportunity to come to a country...and there's one of the things I will never forget.\nThere was this little immigrant coming off the boat, has to go through customs and\nimmigration, and the immigration officer said...after he opened my passport I had a\nwhich 1s not a passport, but 1s a piece of paper that means, \"Let him pass,\" translated.\nUh...It's a travel document. And the immigration officer opening the travel document\nread my name and he said, \"Welcome to America, Mr. Strauss.\" Those were actually the\nfirst words I heard in the United States from a... It made such a profound impression. It is\nnow...this was in 1947, so that is 40...",
        "A: 44 years ago, but I can still see the man's face, just as much as I can see the faces of these\nNazi officers that came to get my father. I remember this officer who said, \"Welcome,\nMr. Strauss.\" Used my name and said, \"Welcome to America, Mr. Strauss.\" Fantastic.\nAnd quite frankly, it's been going up ever since. And...and therefore I have become an\nAmerican who... who is politically involved to a certain extent. Uh...Let us say, I am not\npolitically involved. I am involved with humanitarian efforts. An immigrant...you know,\nthis is an interesting thing. A Russian Jew and a German Jew, we're so far apart because\nthe German Jews were...were very prejudice, solid, integrated people. They were more\nGerman than they were Jews. And Russian Jews were second...second-class citizens,\nwhich was, of course, all craziness. But today if I can find a Russian Jew that I can take\nby the hand and give him part of my America and return him to self-sufficiency as a way\nof life, that justifies all the efforts and all the hours because it gives you love in return. It\ngives you...uh...dignity. You give away dignity to others. The dignity that Hitler robbed\nus, the dignity that we didn't have extended to us by the British. And here welcome to\nAmerica. This is the country where we...we simply we have to do everything we can to\ndefend this democracy to make it a better democracy. Surely, many things that are wrong.",
        "A: Good. We're through.",
        "A: Don't you want to show some of the pictures that I have.",
        "A: How does that work?",
        "A: Okay. Uh...When they burst through the door, it's like a burglar coming into your house.\nYour house is violated. Everybody is terribly, terribly scared, and I must admit my\nmother had more wits about her. They were not taking any women that particular... On\nKristallnacht, they were hunting men. Men and young men. Uh...And while my father\nput on his leg which was a big procedure. It was a wooden leg with straps around the\nshoulders and so forth, my mother left the bedroom. The three people were watching my\nfather, but didn't care about my mother. Whether they knew about my existence or\nwhether they were not paying attention in the confusion, one doesn't know. Uh...My\nmother immediately took me to the roof rafters and said, \"You stay there. Don't do\nanything. Be very quiet.\" Whether they ever asked my mother for me, I doubt it because\nmy mother would have told me. They probably did not ask her. But the feeling inside of\nme being hunted like an animal is a fear that settles in your stomach and a fear for your\nfather. We knew then that all these little steps that were taken...the Jews...to discriminate,\nthe Jews are bad; the Jews are murderers, had come to a...to an explosion. It finally\nerupted. We knew that, and...uh...the...the feeling in your stomach almost to a point of\nthrowing up the...the being scared feeling is one that you will never forget. You\nforget...I...I have a feeling that you may forget pain. Pain is something that goes away,\nbut mental...being afraid doesn't go away. It stays and I...I still remember that. And of\ncourse my mother was fairly cool and composed and I...she told me the following story\namongst other things. Uh...In order to determine whether we had played with any funds\nand taken any money illegally out of the country, they interrogated my father in one room\nand took my mother into another room and asked them, \"What money do you spend for\nhousehold budget every week?\" And, of course, my parents had all these years tried to\nsave money and get it Switzerland and get it out. That was my mother's insistence. So my\nfather when asked in his mind doubled the amount in order to account for missing money\nwhich was a good presence of mind. And in order to find out whether he spoke the truth\nthese SS officers took my mother into another room and asked her the same questions.\nAnd I don't know whether God guided her or something. She also doubled the amount.\nThe two answers, which was not prepared, never spoken before...in the interrogation, the\ntwo answers absolutely agreed.",
        "A: Yes, my parents had gotten money to Switzerland in...in...from 33 to 39, they were able\nto get at great losses...there were couriers that took money to Switzerland. Many of the\ncouriers vanished and never showed up again. But it was a amount of money that my\nfather being quite wealthy was able to get out and it really helped us to live on it for quite\nawhile. But then it eventually all vanished and blew up with the devaluation and etcetera,\netcetera. But he became from a very rich man, he became a very poor man and part\nof...let me...let me sing praise of my mother's...uh...was an extraordinary woman. We had\nin Germany in the \"good old days\" we had servants. I don't mean one. We had a number\nof servants. And we had a chauffeur and we had a car, we had houseman. We had a\nhousemaid, etcetera, etcetera, and my mother went to Palestine and within | week from\nGermany she scrubbed floors in Palestine and she never complained. And she never had\nany compunction about...uh...saying she's unhappy. We were alive. We had escaped. We\nwere grateful for what we had. We were satisfied. And...uh..it so happens that Israel was\nable to give me a first class education at the in Haifi and I was very privileged and this is\nwhy, again, I support Israel with everything that I have. Another story that may interest\nyou 1s...uh...when in 1948 Israel was declared a state and the war broke out with the\nArabs, there was a Legation in New York. Israel didn't have a embassy then, and I told\nthem I am willing to go back to Israel and fight for Israel because I had just arrived in the\nUnited States. And he said, \"Well, we don't have any planes...any place on a...on a plane\nto take you back. You're not important right now. But as soon as we have space, we will\nnotify you.\" I'm still waiting for them to notify me. (laughing) I'm still here. So this is\nreally how it happened, and I met a lovely young lady in Washington, got married,\netcetera, etcetera.",
        "A: Uh...When my father got out of jail, he again was a free man to a certain extent. Business\nwas finished. He called up...it's an interesting sideline...he called up some of the...uh...big\nfactories which were really German Aryan factories that, \"I have oil...[ have a tank car\nfull of this and that. I'm willing to give it to you at half price.\" And a number of these big\nfactories says...said to my father, \"Mr. Strauss, we do not want to take advantage of your\nmisfortune.\" The misfortune of being Jew and having to leave. \"We will pay you the\ngoing rate.\" And it so happens that they bought an awful lot of o1l which they didn't need\nand they put it in tanks and it turned out that during the war, they couldn't get any oil and\nthey were the lucky...they had helped the Jew, but they were the lucky ones, because they\nhad oil for many years to come. So that's one of those...uh...quirky fates that happen in\nlife. Uh...I lost my tread.",
        "A: Yeah. The departure itself was very dramatic because when we got to the train and the\ntrain moved, my father had never cried. I had never seen my father cry in his life. My\nfather cried because...because we knew that it was the end of a total existence. A man\nwho...who was an officer who was a leading citizen, a man who was respected left with a\nsuitcase even though we had some money in Switzerland. We wasn't in immediate danger\nof...of starving. There wasn't. Uh...but we knew it was the end of an era and my father\nand my mother held each other and cried, but they're very lucky because they got away.\nMany others never had a chance to cry. Many others were separated and had to wave to\neach other, including...we have some reports...there was one uncle who picked berries in\nGermany in the woods to feed himself and allegedly either was shot there or went to a\nconcentration camp and was killed there for picking berries. Any excuse will do. So my\nfamily, particular family, was extremely lucky to have had the means. Now you will ask\nhow come you had the means? And I will tell you many did not have the means to escape\nand pay and buy their way out. My father had a big apartment house which he had to sell\nunder duress, but that apartment house was paid for and that gave us after he paid Hitler\nhis 20 percent of everything he had, gave us still enough money to buy a ticket to get out.\nMany people perished because they could not afford the train fare to get out. And once\nwe were in Italy...uh...we were able to pay for our hotel room. We got on a ship...on the\nship legally. The ship called the S.S. Jerusalem which was an Italian ship, took us to\nHaifa Harbor where we were welcomed by an uncle who took us in, who had rented from\nan Arab an apartment for us. True, we did not have any lights and electricity and it was\nvery bare. I wired the house. It was one of those little miracles that a 17, 16...17 year old\nwas able to wire the whole house with electricity, and when the inspector came, he said,\n\"That's not done by a professional. We were absolutely worried he would cut us down.\nHe said, \"It's too neat.\" So we survived the electrical inspection. Uh...But the...the\nshaping of a man's dignity, of a man's humanitarian attitude toward his fellow man is\nwhat the Holocaust is all about. If you...1f we don't learn and pass on to our children what\nwe have learned, what I have learned and...because I am very lucky. I'm here to talk\nabout it. Those that have learned the bitterest lesson of them all are not here to talk about\nit. We have to take what we can and convey and...and make sure that the next generation\nreally understands...uh...what inhumanity to man by man can be.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The chauffeurs name was Berma, and...uh...he was a professional driver who from what\nwe hear became a tank or some other driver in the German army. He perished on the\nRussian front. We know that from other fellow employees that we later on spoke in\nGermany to. As a matter of fact, I will be going to Germany in July, and I expect to visit\nmy German nanny who is now in her 90s. She is still alive. I am still keeping touch with\nher. I expect to see her in July to visit her for a couple of hours. Of course, they were\nunder Russian occupation for many, many years, but we kept touch, and we kept greeting\neach other.",
        "A: First time I going back to my house which 1s still...still there. Uh... The house to the left is\nbombed out. The house to the left...to the right is bombed out. Our house 1s still standing,\nand from photographs I have seen there, this is interesting. There's a carved door, with\nlion heads, wooden carved door. Tremendous door, and I remember it as a kid because of\nI was afraid of these lions' heads on the door. Would you believe they're still there? The\nsame doors 60 years later? They're still there, and I'm going to see them in July.\nBut...uh...[...1 want to say to you Germany was poisoned and Germans are guilty\n(coughing) and Germans are guilty, but not all of them. There are human beings out there\nthat still have retained their righteousness. And thank God for these. Otherwise, the world\nwould just not have any hope. So we kept in touch with most of the employees or many\nof the employees. Most of them are dead by now anyway.",
        "A: This is a photograph of my father, Leopold Strauss. The interesting thing 1s (coughing)\nthe picture hasn't been taken in...roughly 1933. You will see the iron cross wearing in his\nlapel. He would never leave the house, never go anywhere unless he would show with\npride the iron cross he had received in World War I, where he also had lost his leg for the\nFatherland.\nConclusion of Interview\n"
