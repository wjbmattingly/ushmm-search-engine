        "Q: Okay, Mr. Gruber would you please tell us your name?",
        "A: Yes, My name is Samuel Gruber.",
        "Q: And what was the name that you used in Poland, during the time of the story that you are\ngoing to be sharing with us today?",
        "A: In the story they called me Mietek, it was a Polish name, it was a first name from Mietek,\nbut Gruber. Mietek Gruber. But before the war they called me Munyo. I was known \u2014 in\nmy town I was called \u2014 named Munyo Gruber. They called me that.",
        "Q: And which town was that, that you\u2014?",
        "A: My town is a small town in Galicia, named Podhajce, not far from Lemberg. I went to\nschool public there. Had my family, five people in the family, with my mother and father\nwas seven. We \u2014 one of my sisters in 1928 married an American \u2014 came from America \u2014\nAmerican, and she come over to America with him and she was here. And I remembered\nher \u2014 his number here, address and being in a \u2014 as a prisoner of war, I wrote to her and\nshe wrote to me and we contacted each other. She was here in America. The rest of the\nfamily disappeared.",
        "Q: Okay. Let's go back then to the period of time before the war. Tell us a little about what\nlife was like in the town in which you were born.",
        "A: Podhajce was a small town. It was maybe 4,000 Jews and around, around the town were\nPolish people, Ukrainians. There was a difference from the Pollacks. And I went to\nschool there, to the public school, for seven years we went. And the town was a very,\nvery nice town. It was Podhajce \u2014 that mean, they had a lot of trees and water and people\ncame from all over Poland almost for like a recreation. It was a very nice place. And I\ndon't remember poor people there because usually in the towns, in the shtetel you call,\nthere was a lot of poor people. I don't remember poor people there. Everybody had some\nkind of store or a business, a small one. My father was a builder. He came from another\ntown and he was building in Podhajce, and he met my mother. My mother was a farmer's\ndaughter, they had land, and he married her and I'm \u2014 all my life I was till 26 years, the\nwar start \u2014 I was with my mother's family. I hardly knew my father's family. They were\nin another town, so it wasn't so easy to go from town to town like it is today. But still\nwhen I was 14 years old, I went away to Lemberg \u2014 Lwow, they called it \u2014 to a bigger\ntown, and I went to high school there and I finished school.",
        "Q: And after you finished high school?",
        "A: Oh, I came back. Not directly. I came maybe one or two years later because I had a job in\nLemberg. I got some \u2014 I helped out some with teaching little bit, I did odd jobs. And then\nI came back to Podhajce, to my family. And I had a job, was a bookkeeper, I worked in a\nbig company from a farmer\u2019s equipment and bicycles, this kind of thing. I was a\nbookkeeper, there. I worked \u2014 till the war started, I worked there. I had a girlfriend. I\nwent out with her for years before the war. And in 19\u2014I was a soldier before, too.",
        "Q: Tell us about that. In what way were you a soldier?",
        "A: They took \u2014 they drafted. After 18 years \u2014 19 years, they drafted, and you had to go. And\nI was physically fit and they took me. Usually they didn't took Jews. Very, few Jews they\ntook to the army, but I was fitting and I had school, and they took me to the army. And I\nwas one and a half years in Tarnopol in the army and I finished the army I came home\nagain and I was working back again in the job. And in \u201839 before the war started, maybe\na month, the town was small and we knew each other. A lot of friends. We were always\ntalking politics on the streets and what will be, what will be, about Hitler came in \u201833 and\nwe knew what was going on. The Pollacks were already showing their faces too. They\ndidn't \u2014 so much the Pollacks like the Ukraine, there were very few Pollacks there. But\nthe Ukrainians there, they showed us that we are Jews, and they are \u2014 we had fights with\nthem. Not big ones, not killings, but fists fights and all kind of \u2014 I remember one Purim\nwhere we made some kind of a party and a Pollack came and he wanted to disturb this.\nAnd I had a big fight with him and he almost killed me because he was very big. I didn't\ngive him an inch, I just gave him back. But he never forgot me this guy. He came after a\nfew days after me. He almost killed me. Around the house he was waiting for me. At\nleast, we had our share with this antisemitism. We did not feel so much in with Podhajce,\nlike we felt in Lemberg. We felt it more in the bigger towns. They were they called it\nEndeks!. There was a group of Pollacks, the right wing and they were completely against\nthe Jews and they were even killing before the war break. We had a big\nfight with them on the streets in the gardens and whatever \u2014 it was a street like in\nAkademicka. That remind me today somebody. Jews couldn't walk there. And there was\nthe biggest houses belonged to Jews and there was a guy \u2014 Stricher(ph) was his name \u2014\nhe had this biggest house like on Akademicka street. He couldn't even collect the rent\nthere. He couldn't go over because the antisemitism was so big and they couldn't \u2014 they\nwere almost sitting in the streets daring, waiting for Jews to come and to beat them up.\nThe situation before the war was already ripe for this, but like a like \u2014 the churchman said\n' National Democrats (Polish); abbreviated from \u201cEndecja.\u201d\nin Poland, \u201cBoycotting is all right, the Jews. Beating them up, 1s alright. But not killing.\nKilling is not our aim,\u201d the Catholic church.",
        "Q: When we get back to the story that you're telling us about your completing the army\nactivity, returning to work, the war began, where were you when the war began? What\nwere you doing?",
        "A: That's right. Before the war, they called me over on the reserves. Maybe two or three\nweeks before the war started. They called me to Nowy Sacz, a town not far from the\nborders of Germany. It is not far from Przemysl and Tarnow. And they \u2014 I went to the\narmy. They, they put us in uniforms and we started to exercise. And maybe two weeks\nafter, nobody new about this. Nobody \u2014 the people around there was surrounded there.\nZakopane was a place where people came there for a cure. And nobody knew that the war\nstarted and all of a sudden during the night they starting shooting and they left us behind,\nthe Germans, and they moved in. It was a Blitzkrieg. They moved in before we even\nknew what happen. We were in the army. We were sitting in the mountains because there\nwas a lot of mountains, the Carpathian Mountains. And we were sitting there and waiting\nfor the Germans and they were around us already, deep in, in Poland and we didn't know\nthey were around us. But after a time they started with us too because they did it in\npockets like, and they start fighting with us and I was wounded in my right arm. I was\nshot and I fell, and but they didn't see me, and I walked over to a house there to a Polish\nwoman and I begged her to let me in because I was bleeding and she saw me and she was\ncrying. She was afraid, but she took me in and she start helping me and she bandaged my\nwound and I was laying \u2014 when I was laying there for five minutes the Germans came in.\nAnd screaming and looking, and the one with the pistol came over to me and I spoke\nfluently German. I told him, \u201cI'm a soldier and I, I'm wounded.\u201d He said, \"Okay, don't\nworry. We will take you back to the hospital.\u201d And they gave me something to eat even\nthere because they took from the farm woman and gave it to me and they brought me\nback to the hospital.",
        "Q: So you were a prisoner of war?",
        "A: And I became a prisoner of war. But I was in the hospital. I didn't feel it so much because\nI was still a prisoner of war, a Polish prisoner of war. Nobody bothered me specially as a\nJew. Nobody said nothing to me. But the Polish people and the woman that worked there,\nthey knew about it that I am Jewish, but they didn't make a special\u2014",
        "Q: How did they know?",
        "A: Face and the, the manners. They knew a Jew. They recognize. Pollacks recognize a Jew\neven we didn't look like one. They knew. And I was lying there maybe a month in the\nhospital until I could move my right hand. I couldn't move it, but they helped me out a\nlittle bit and I'm, I'm moving it. I still till today is \u2014 I cannot pick my hand that's all. And\nafter a month and a half, they took us, whoever was in the hospital left, and they took us\nto Germany. In a train, they brought me over to Germany. And they brought me into\nStalag 13 \u20141n the film you will see, Stalag 13 \u2014 as a prisoner of war. The second day I\ncame in, they put us 1n a line up, all the Polish prisoners and they asked, \u201cJuden\nraustreten\u2019.\u201d \"Jews report.\u201d I was hesitating for a minute, I admit and two friends of\nmine, Pollacks, they were standing in my side both of them and they pushed me out and\nthey said, \"Here is a Jew.\u201d",
        "Q: Must have been nice friends.",
        "A: Two friends of mine. A day before we, we shared bread because on the way we came,\nthey throw bread to us to the, to the train. And I always \u2014 they always give me I should\ndivide it and I was, I was always a leader between them. And all of a sudden, they\ndecided, \u201chere's a Jew.\u201d Then I came out. I had no, no choice, and they put a separate\nbarracks but to the same place they kept us. They took us to all kinds of work, heavy\nwork during this. We were cleaning after even Hitler when he spoke in Nuremberg. That\nwas \u2014 I was around Nur\u2014Langwasser, Stalag 13 was there. Nuremberg, we were\ncleaning after Hitler. He spoke once. And I was a little bit more home in the barracks\nbecause I couldn't work so hard with my hand and they knew about it the Germans. They\nhad their report. And in fact, the Red Cross came to us and my number's 30,189. I still\nremember. And they have the record of me when I was born, where I was born, and\nwhere I fell \u2014 the 8th of October I think, and when I was in prison.",
        "Q: This is a good chance to go back for a moment to think about your family. You have told\nus about the war beginning, your involvement in the war. Where was your family?",
        "A: That's a very interesting. My family was on the other side of the border. The Russians\ntook over one side of Poland. The Germans took over the other. They had made pact,\nRibbentrop\u00ae and Molotov\u2019, and they divided Poland. My family was in Galicia, and then\nbelonged to Russian and I was on the other side by the Germans and they were by the\nRussians. So 1941 they were under the Russian. It wasn't too good, but still my father\nwas working. He was a builder and he built houses for them, and he built this. And he \u2014\nthey made a living. Nobody killed him there. They knew what is going on the other side,\nbecause I was corresponding with them. As a prisoner of war, I had the right to write \u2014 to\nsend letters and they were receiving the letters and they were answering me. And one was\nan interesting that I sent a letter that went from one camp to the other when they took me.\nI was in a few camps. But they cut my hair. I had very nice bushy hair and I didn't like it\nthat they cut my hair. I looked like a muselman\u2019. I looked very bad. Then I wrote to my\n* Jews step out! (German)\n3 Joachim von Ribbentrop\n* Vyacheslav Molotov\n> Muslim (German); camp term used to refer to prisoners who had lost the will to live and were near death.\nparents that they cut my hair again and my sister answers me, \"Watch that they shouldn't\ncut your head. The hair will grow back.\u201d And that was the truth. I had to watch my head.",
        "Q: So during this time while you were prisoner of war, you did keep contact with your\nfamily?",
        "A: I kept contact with my family and I kept contact even with my sister in America. I was\nsending her letters, and she even sent me a package \u2014 she was sending me a package. I\nhad this sweater \u2014 I can never forget \u2014 a green sweater. She sent me and I put it on, and\nwhen I run away to the, to the woods, I had this sweater on. And after a time, there were\nSO many insects in this that when I took it over, the sweater walked away by itself. That's\na joke, that's the truth. That's the way it was. I mean I had contact with my sister and I\nhad contact with my family.",
        "Q: Okay. Now, let's get back to where you were. You were taken into Stalag and you were\ngiven a particular work assignment?",
        "A: I was assigned to the kitchen more or less because in the beginning, they did some other\nworks and later on they put me in the kitchen. In the kitchen, I was making coffee and I\nwas making lunch. And I once I made coffee and I didn't know what sugar is. They gave\nme the salt and sugar was for me the same. I never saw it before. And you had to \u2014 sugar\nwas in lumps not loose. And I put in ..instead of sugar, I put in salt in the coffee in the\nmorning, the group went to work, was Pollacks also, they were eating from this kitchen.\nThey wanted to kill me because the coffee was salted and they figured \u2014 they called me in\nthe Germans right away and they said it's sabotage and usually when \u2014 if I would be\nunder the SS, I wouldn't live. They would kill me. But this was Wehrmacht\u00ae there. And\nsome of them are still people today you could talk to. And I understand. told him this\nstory that I didn't know what it is and I put in salt. And he let me go. But he gave me a\nlesson. I think he took me, he put me to work, but he was somehow lenient to me because\nI helped him out after a time in his office too. I write German fluently, and I was helping\nin the office to write it. And from \u2014 this was in Ludwigsburg, I think, yes. I was in\nNuremberg, and then I was in Ludwigsburg and then I was in what the name? Munzinger.\nThey were taking us from one place to the other. And then Munzinger, all of a sudden\nthey decided or it's not \u2014 they, I mean, the headquarters \u2014 decided that all Jews have to be\nsent back to Poland. How\u201d? They said they don't want prisoners now. The Pollacks \u2014 the\nPolish war was finished. Why should they keep prisoners? \u201cYou are Jews, and no, no\nprisoners and we send you home.\u201d And they suppose to change, to change us over with\nthe Russians. That was in \u201841, and after a time they took us \u2014 they put us in trains and\nthey brought us to Gleiwitz and from Gleiwitz, they brought us to Lublin in a camp\nLipowa Seven. There was from horses from a camp before. And this Lipowa, right away\nby the train, when they took us over, they showed us, right away, who they are. They\n\u00b0 General title of German armed forces from 1935 to 1945.\nwere SS. They came with, with the dogs, peitsches\u2019, sticks and all kinds of this, and they\nwere beating us right all the way to the camp. And they told, \"You are no more prisoners\nof war. You are Jews and we will be treated as Jews.\u201d But still they kept us separate.\nThey didn't put us together with the ghetto. There was a ghetto. In Lublin there was a\nghetto already then. And they did not put us in the ghetto.\nBut there was an interesting story. Before I came there was maybe a thousand prisoners.\nThey were all Jews also, what came and they \u2014 the Germans brought them over to the\nJews from the ghetto and they told them, \"You feed them. That's your Jews. You feed\nthem.\u201d And they, they didn't have what to eat themselves in Lublin. The people, the\npopulation was very bad for the ghetto. And they said, \"We don't have food.\u201d They said,\n\"Good.\u201d They took them out and they killed all the prisoners of war, the whole thousand.\nMaybe \u2014 maybe a tenth was left over by the end. They brought them on the way to\nLubartow, a small town, and then to Parczew. Maybe there was left maybe 10, maybe 20.\nI don't \u2014 I cannot tell exactly and there the people \u2014 the population, the Jewish population\nput them in right away and gave them food and they kept. I came after this and they felt\nthat the Jews \u2014 they felt they had to do something. They made a kitchen for us in the\ncamp. They brought over and they was cooking for us meals, and they kept us there. The\nleadership there was from the SS. There was Riedel\u00ae was the leader, and there was Dolp\u2019\nwas a small officer. He was the terror of all Lublin and the terror from all over in Poland.\nDolp was known all over. Dolp came in on a horse to the camp and if he saw somebody\nlaying in the bed sick or somebody didn't get up so fast in the morning, he shot him right\non the spot. And we had a lot of problems there in the camp. I was still on the, on the care\nof this hospital whatever because I was shot and I had always showed this paper I had\nfrom the Germans that I cannot work so hard. Others were working out and in the\nbeginning also I went out to work and we built the known Majdanek camp, Majdanek\nconcentration camp. They built from the prisoners of war. We built it. And after this was\nready, we were still there. They brought in the first prisoners of war from Russia. The\nwar with Russia started in 1941. I think in July, June. I don't remember exactly the date.\nAnd when the war started the first prisoners of war in Majdanek were Russians and they\nsaid \u2014 the Germans said that they are not Russians \u2014 just prisoners, but they are\ncommissars. They are officers something like communists real, and they have to die. And\nthey were dying like flies. I don't know if they gave them poison or whatever they gave\nthem, they were dying. They had typhus there and they were dying. And we got \u2014 we\ncaught from them typhus from the Russians. Me too. I got sick. I got the typhus. And\nthey brought \u2014 they didn't want to give us any care because they were afraid that we will\n\u2014 they will get sick to the Germans, and they took us out and they put us in a synagogue.\nIn the synagogue they put on the floor nothing to cover. Nothing. We just stayed there.\nWe were about 400 sick people and I think 300 died. And the strongest one, somehow \u2014 I\ncannot believe it, but the stronger ones died. And I had some help from the town\n7 Whips (German)\n* Unterscharf Horst Riedel\n? Sturmbannfihrer Hermann Dolp\nsomehow. A doctor came in once, and he knew me from before. And he gave me a needle\nand he ran out fast because he was afraid that everybody want and he didn't have the help\nfor everybody. And he gave me a needle and somehow it helped me, and I lived too.",
        "Q: Mr. Gruber?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You mentioned before that you were taken into a synagogue? Could you describe what\nthat synagogue looked like?",
        "A: The synagogue was a very, very big building. It was the biggest synagogue in Lublin.\nLublin was a very known town from Jews. The Jews lived there for hundreds of years,\nhistorical. The biggest Rabbi for the yeshiva there was in Lublin, and they had the\nbiggest synagogue was there in Lublin, too. And they took out everything. It was bare\nwalls there, and we were, were laying there 400 people on the floor. Plain on the floor.\nNobody was taking care of us. Nobody talked to us. Nothing! But the people of Lublin\nonce in awhile were daring. They came in and they brought us food a little bit. They\nhelped us out a little bit in that synagogue.",
        "Q: These people from Lublin they were in the ghetto?",
        "A: In the ghetto.",
        "Q: And they managed to get out of the ghetto?",
        "A: No. No. The synagogue was in the ghetto. This was in the ghetto.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: They didn't have to go out. They came there. They came women and the ladies. I had a\ngirlfriend there what I knew and she came to help me out and had friends they came in to\nme to see me there.",
        "Q: So you were actually able to see what was going on in the ghetto?",
        "A: I was in the ghetto. Lots of times. Because I was working so hard in the outside, then I\nwas inside working for self help. People when they went out they were getting some\nfoods, some bread. They brought it into the camp and they were bringing it over to me\nand I concentrated and I was going over there. There was a hospital. I would bring over\nfood for them. I was given out for people what ever was poor. They couldn't work. I was\ngiving out bread. It was self help. I was working with another one. Goldberg(ph) was his\nname. We both worked in this in the camp.",
        "Q: How did it come to pass that you were doing these activities?",
        "A: I don't know. I was maybe brought up like this from home. I was always in the\norganizations. I was belonged to Shomer ha-Za\u2019ir!? when I was a youngster for the \u2014 for\nthe organization for Israel. In fact, before the war I went also to a Hachshara!'. I was\npreparing to go to Israel and I was maybe a year and a half in that Hachshara working.\nAnd I was always on the side of the poor. I don't know \u2014 .somehow I \u2014 that was my\nnature. And I liked to do it, and I \u2014 I was helping people.",
        "Q: But you were more than helping? You were the leader of these activities?",
        "A: I've always \u2014 somehow they \u2014 they gave me the leadership. Always as I remember there\nwas a moment in the camp. There was a lot of doctors, intelligentsia was there. He came\ninto the camp already when it was Jew. And one of the doctor, the Germans wanted him\nto be the leader of the camps, he came over to me and he said, \"Gruber, you are the man\nfor us. We want \u2014 I want you to do it.\u201d I said, \"No. Not for the Germans I wouldn't do it.\u201d\nAnd I didn't want to take it. Another guy took it. But still they felt something from him\nthat I was doing the right thing and they always gave me the leadership.",
        "Q: How did you feel about taking the leadership?",
        "A: I was brought up like that because when I was in the organizations I was always there. I\nwas talking to people. I had speeches. But my main subject was antisemitism. I remember\ntoday that I was always digging in into this, why there is antisemitism all around. Why\nthe church? Why this? Why they're doing this? And I was always working on this. And\npeople were asking me always the questions about this. Why there is antisemitism? And I\ntold once a story and I don't know why it came to me the story. I was reading it or\nsomething that men \u2014 a priest asked a man to come into his church. He didn't see him a\nlong time in the church. He said, \"Why should I go to the church. You always talk\nnonsense?\" He said, \"No, no. Come over. I will have a very nice sermon. Come over.\u201d\nThe man came out. The churchman talks as a sermon about Jews. He said that the Jews\nkilled Christ. The Jews need blood for matzos and all the bad things in the world comes\nfrom the Jews. He heard a sermon against the Jews. The Pollack walked out and he\ngrabbed a Jew on the street. They start beating him up. Then the church man came out,\nthe priest came out and said, \"Why do you beat this Jew?\" He said, \"What do you mean\nwhy I am beating?\" You just told me what the Jews did. They killed Christ and, and all\nkinds of things.\u201d He said, \"Wait a second. That was 2000 years ago. That was a long time\nago.\u201d He said, \"No, \" to the priest. \"You told it to me today and while you talking about\nthis, we are listening.\u201d And that's what it was. They were listening to the priest. The\npriest were always talking about this, that Jews are a menace. \u201cThe Jews killed Christ.\u201d\nBut they never told them that Christ was a Jew himself. In Poland if you would tell a\n'0'Youth guard (Hebrew); Zionist youth organization.\n'l Training (Hebrew); Zionist program to prepare youth for emigration to Israel.\nPollack that Jesus was a Jew, he would kill you it. Because how can it be? He was God.\nAnd that came from the churches. It came this hate for the Jews. Next the economic\nsituation in Poland was so that Jews were working for the big farmers. Jews were\nworking for the kings. Jews were working, collecting taxes. That was their function. And\nby doing this they came in contact with the nation, with the people.",
        "Q: You had a lot of this experience?",
        "A: Experience. Built up in me.",
        "Q: Let's come back then to where you were when you were put into the synagogue with\nthese 400 people, sick people.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: These were all Jews, all workers.",
        "A: Yes. All Jews. Workers.",
        "Q: And this had been men who had been working on the Majdanek Camp?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay. And you were lying there and the doctor gave you an injection?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And then he left?",
        "A: Yes. And the others like I told you, 300 of them died. The rest of them was brought back\nto the camp, to the camp to.... When I came back also, and I was a little \u2014 felt a little\nbetter, I still sit down and didn't work. And I had a friend of mine, his name was Henryk\nSzengut. He was a very good friend of me, and he was always with me and he was\nwatching me all the time. And after a time was the leader of the camp was a Jewish\nfellow was named Fiszer'*. We had the whole camp. There was 12 camps \u2014 like 12\ncamps \u2014 like 12, and I was in the sixth.",
        "Q: Okay. Let's think about the camp itself. You say there are 12.",
        "A: Twelve camps and there was barracks.",
        "Q: Could you describe them? Twelve barracks?\n'2 Roman Fiszer",
        "A: Yes, that's what I want to tell. Barracks were there. And in every barrack were maybe\n100 \u2014 120 Jews there, and every barrack had his own leader there was watching, and he\nwas reporting to the main leader, to the Jewish official. Official is the leader for the\ncamp. And there was two Jews there, Germans, Kapos!\u2019. They were working for the\nGermans and one was Simon and the other one is \u2014 I don't remember his name. And they\nwere German Jews, and they were doing whatever the Germans told them. And the\nGermans \u2014 they came to us.",
        "Q: And all of the others were Polish Jews?",
        "A: Polish Jews.",
        "Q: And essentially all former prisoners?",
        "A: Essentially former the prisoners, essentially from the side of the Russian side because the\nones what were on the side where the Germans took over, they let them go home. They\nlet them go home and they wind up in ghettos and camps and all this. But the group that\nremained there in this was from the Russian side because they don\u2019t \u2014 they didn't have\nwhere to go. We supposed to be changed for prisoner of wars from Russia to Germany,\nbut the war broke out and it stopped it. They were changing some in the beginning, but\nthen it stopped and we were stuck in Lublin in Lipowa Seven. Now, I saw what's going\non there and \u2014",
        "Q: What was going on there that you saw?",
        "A: I mean they were killing people for the \u2014 for the smallest thing. They were \u2014 a lot of\nthose people went out to work. When they came back, they brought a piece of bread or\nthey brought some shoes sometimes. Some a piece of clothing or something from the\nPollacks. They were \u2014 they were dealing in \u2014 with them. They give money what they had\n\u2014 dealing with them. And when they caught them \u2014 the Germans, they were watching by\nthe entrance \u2014they caught them, they were hanging, killing. Just for a piece of bread.",
        "Q: Who were they hanging and killing?",
        "A: The prisoners \u2014 us. The prisoners. When they came from work and they had a piece of\nbread and they found it and they killed you for this. They just \u2014 they had a hanging place\nand they were hanging. Especially they were killing if somebody run away.",
        "Q: What happened if somebody run away.\n'3 Forman (colloquial German); term used for inmates appointed by the SS to head a labor Kommando of prisoners.",
        "A: If somebody run away, they caught him. Usually they caught. They caught two of them\nand they took out the whole camp there one night and they were hanging him publicly\nlike everybody should see. They woke us up in the middle of the night and everybody\ncame out naked almost and it wasn't even \u2014 they told them to take off. Everybody was\nhalf naked outside and was February, I think \u2014 the beginning of March cold. Terribly.\nAnd a lot of us got pneumonia. We caught cold. And on top of this when they told us to\ngo back to the barrack, they was standing in the door and whoever walked in they beat\nthem how much they could. Every one of us, we all got beating. I was just behind a man\nwho start crying, \"Don't hit me. I have \u2014 I have home children, a wife. Don't hit me.\u201d The\nGermans said, \"Yes, I have a child \u2014 wife and children too, and I have to stay here with\nyou and watch you, you stinking Jew.\u201d And he hit him more even. When he hit him the\nmore, I jumped over and he didn't touch me. He came in and I went in first. But my luck\nwas that they send me over to work in a special hospital. In a hospital, they had there a\nbarrack from the prisoners of war, about 20 of us or 24 \u2014 I don't remember. And we were\nworking for the Germans, not SS, for the Wehrmacht. And usually every night we went\nto the \u2014 back to the barracks normal but then they built for us barracks and we was\nsleeping there and getting food there and we were working there. And I worked in a\nmagazine.",
        "Q: Go back to a point you made. You said, \"My luck.\u201d",
        "A: My luck was I meant the Fisher remember me. He knew that I am \u2014 that I cannot work\nhard. And he sent me out there, there I was sitting like a office, and I was writing down \u2014\nif somebody came from the front, Germans came from the front and they needed or they\nhave to give back uniforms, rifles, pistols, everything \u2014 I was registering this.\nEverything! And I had maybe 10 of my prisoners of war prisoners. They took it away\nfrom me and they were sorting it and keeping it. When the people went back to the front,\nthey gave it back. But most of them didn't. And while they had their pistols and rifles, I\nstart stealing rifles and pistols there from them.",
        "Q: How 1s it possible that you were able to steal rifles?",
        "A: I was more or less left alone in the office. I don't know if he had some kind of\nconfidences. German was the head of this. He was like a Volksdeutsche'*. He spoke\nPolish and he spoke German, and I think he was doing \u2014 and now as I think, I'm sure he\nwas dealing with my people, not with me. Me, he told I should write down that I gave out\nto the Germans more than they took. Let's say I gave them a pair of shoes. I put I gave the\nman shoes and pants and a jacket and all this. And he took away the difference what I\nwrote down. I gave out shoes. I put down the shoes, and the difference he took away the\njacket and the pants and he was dealing with \u2014 with my people and they were selling\nthem to the population somehow. Because being in the hospital the Pollacks had entrance\n'4 Ethnic German (German)\nto us more. We were not in a ghetto no more. We had open doors there. We could go in\nand out. Then they were dealing.",
        "Q: You could go in and out of the hospital?",
        "A: Of the hospital. Yes. We were watched more or less, but it's \u2014 1t was easier. In fact, every\nday I went back to the camp to collect food for the group because I was like the leader of\nthe group there. I remained like a leader. I was, I was going for food. I went to the camp\nwith a German with a wagon. He brought me over there. We collected food for the\npeople. We didn't need it. In fact, once I gave it away. To the camp I left it. And one of\nthe Germans saw it, and he called me over to the head of the camp there, was Mohwinkel\nHe said, \"What do you mean? You stealing bread from your comrades and you give it\naway to the others.\u201d And he beat me up over the head with peitsche. This guy Fisher saw\n\u2014 came just then, and he saw that he is beating me, and he said, \"Leave him alone. I will\ntake care of it. I will give him a beating. You leave him alone.\u201d And Fisher just kicked\nme and threw me away you know and he said, \u201cJust go back to the camp.\u201d He did that\nspecial, you know, to this. And in the camp I had contact with Pollacks. I worked with\nPolish prisoners of war. I worked with the Germans there. I worked with women there. It\nwas a big hospital there.",
        "Q: What do you mean when you say you worked with these people?",
        "A: Let say, I worked there and they \u2014 they worked \u2014 they \u2014 they and let's say something was\nripped or something, they were sewing or they were in the kitchen working. They was an\nadministration there from Polish people and the Germans. The Germans were on top and\nthe Pollacks were working there. And I was talking to them. We were more free there.\nInside we were talking. And then came over to me a man. His name was Paul. Paul. I\ndon't remember the second name, and he said to me, \"What are you doing here?,\" he said,\n\u201cWhy don't you run away?\"",
        "Q: What kind of a man was this Paul?",
        "A: That's it. I didn't \u2014 I was afraid of the Pollacks altogether, you know, and especially a\nman comes over to me and tells me a story I should run away and he knew when I will\nrun away that they will kill 20 people. The whole group will be killed because for that |\nman \u2014 they told the Germans that. \u201cIf one man runs away, we kill 20, we kill 50 whatever\nwe feel like we will kill because one man runs away.\u201d And I told them the story. Said,\n\"Listen, they will kill a lot of people if I run away.\u201d He said, \"Try to get out how many\nyou can because everyone of you will be killed. In the camp, in the ghettos they will kill\neverybody.\u201d I said, \"How do you know it?\" He said, \"I am a partisan. I'm a fighter.\u201d \"I\nsit here,\" he said, \"to work, but I have connection with the woods. I know a lot of people\nalready out in the woods and they're fighting the Germans and I know some Jews and\neven from your camps, they run away. And I knew that's two or three run away, and they\nare in the woods. They have horses already there. They have rifles.\u201d He said, \"There is a\narmy,\" he said. I couldn't believe it in the beginning and I decided to stay, but still it was\nvery important. And like I told you before, I was a believer. I believed that Hitler will kill\neverybody. I believed. I was reading before the war even what he was doing to people,\nand I believed that he will kill. And I went out. When I came every Saturday or Sunday \u2014\nI can't remember when I went for the food \u2014 I connect myself with the people, the people\nwhom I knew and I was talking to them, \"People, Let's run away. They will kill us, all of\nus.\u201d A lot of them were listening to me. And a lot of them said, \"Forget it. Who? The\nGermans? People like the Germans. They are cultural people. The biggest culture in the\nworld. They will kill people \u2014 prisoners of war, especially. Forget it? Anyway, where will\nyou go? In the woods there. The Pollacks are not so keen to see us, and here 1s at least\nthey give us some food. They gave us some cover to sleep in the night. We will live\nthrough the war like this.\u201d And I was very sorry for one man specially. He was a very\ngood friend. He was a lawyer and I was begging him, plain begging him, \"Come with me.\nRun away.\u201d He said, \u201cNo, no, no. I can't.\u201d But I persuaded 22 people and told them that I\nam running away, and I came over to this Pollack and \u2014 after a few months. It wasn't\nright away. I was finding out if he tells the truth and how he behaves and all this. I was\nwatching very carefully. And we made a meeting in town. I had a meeting with him and\ntwo real partisans. People from the woods came over and in a restaurant, a Jewish\nrestaurant \u2014 it was still a Jewish restaurant in the ghetto, and he gave me a compass. He\ngave me a map, and he gave me directions and where to run and how to run and where to\nmeet. And we run away on October the 28th, 1942. We decided to run away. We talked\nto these 22 people. Everyone of them knew their locations, where he was to go. In\nseparate places there everybody had to go. The going was still good. That means we\ncould get out somehow. We could persuade the Germans we have to go out because later\non I know after this nobody could get out. But it was still a possibility to get out of at\nleast to town you know, to\u2014",
        "Q: Well, let's take for example how you got out.",
        "A: That's what I mean. I still \u2014 I went out. I said, \u201cI'm going to camp for food.\u201d I told the\nGerman I am going to the camp. And I was the leader and I had the right to go. I had a\nwhite band, band there, I was Kolonnefiihrer\u2019> and I had the right to go out. And instead\nto go over there to the camp I \u2014 I started to go in the direction where he told me to the\nwoods.",
        "Q: That was walking where?",
        "A: Walking through Lublin to the town and on the outskirts of Lublin, and one thing I didn't\nmention in my book that I \u2014 when I walked came in two gendarmes, two police on\nhorses, and I saluted them and they didn't say nothing to me and I was shaking like a leaf.\nI was sure this is it. And somehow they let \u2014 they let me through and I \u2014 I went through\n'S Column leader (German)\ntown and walked straight by myself to the woods where I knew my two people were\nwaiting for me.",
        "Q: Okay. Let's slow down again. I'd like to go back for a minute to something you said\nearlier. You said that while you were in the hospital, you were taking rifles and guns.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit more about what you were doing with these rifles and guns.",
        "A: Right. We had there a man, today he is in Israel, his name is Weingarten!\u00ae. He had some\nkind of connection outside with Jewish people, with Pollacks. He was selling. I don't\nknow really. I was always giving him the rifles. I myself kept one pistol and ammunition.\nI kept myself.",
        "Q: Where did you keep it?",
        "A: I kept it behind my bed. I kept it \u2014 I didn't keep it a long time, but almost by the end.\nAbout three, four days before, and \u2014",
        "Q: What did you think was happening with all of these rifles?",
        "A: They wind up in the hands of the Polish partisans. They came there. But I \u2014 I don't know.\nHe told me he made some money on this too I think through this Weingarten. He gave\naway a few pistols and rifles. But I myself before I went away \u2014 came to me \u2014 I had one\nman, Jegier\u2019\u2019. He was later the leader and he said to me, \"We wanted to buy by the\nPollacks some rifles and ammunition to buy and we had money for this.\u201d And the last\nminute they refused and we don't have. Not one rifle, not one pistol, nothing. And they\ntook our money too. And he said, this Jegier said, \"What shall we do now? I don't think I\nwill run away now. Without nothing, what will we do now in the woods without.\u201d I said,\n\"Jegier, you do whatever what you want. I am going. I decided and you please tell your\npeople they should go because I am going.\u201d And somehow Jegier and 22 of them, they all\ncame on time. Six o'clock, like a clock or was it seven o'clock because it was darkness\nalready on October the 28th, and we met all of us we met by the two Pollacks and there\nstart a new other odyssey, started new chapter in my life.",
        "Q: Okay. Let's take a minute before we go onto the new chapter to think about another\naspect of your life in the camp for you. You were maintaining your contact with your\nfamily all through this time?",
        "A: Right.\n'6 David Weingarten\n'7 Shmuel Jegier",
        "Q: Right up to that point?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: How \u2014 did you have any thoughts about where you're going to be a, a year from then, a\nmonth from then? Did you have any thoughts about your future?",
        "A: Who could think about a future there? You lived day by day. We saw what is going on,\nand every one of us was feeling that after tomorrow he will not be there. Nobody could\nthink. But I remember one thing what I did. It was not legal. I sent a letter through a girl\nthere. All the mail what we sent home or wherever went through a censor and my letter I\ngave to a Polish girl and she took it with her, and somehow, they caught the Polish girl\nwith my letter. In this letter \u2014 I remember like today \u2014 I said, \"I'm running away,\u201d and I\ntold my family, \"Run away. Nobody will live. Run, because the Germans will kill\neverybody.\u201d And the Germans caught this letter and I'm lucky, lucky it was a\nWehrmacht, not SS, and this guy beat me up and beat up this girl and didn't gave the\nletter to the SS. Otherwise I wouldn't live till then to run away. This was \u2014 that \u2014 and\nthat's the circumstances we were living. Day by day we didn't know if today is one killed\nor another. But it was an interesting story there. When we were building the Majdanek,\nthat this Dolp. I said, in the beginning, the officer, he was supervising the work there, and\none of our Jewish boys \u2014 .he was from Tarnopol, I don't remember his name, and he\ndidn't like his work. The \u2014 Dolp didn't like how he worked and they started beating him\nup. This Jewish boy threw himself on this Dolp and start fighting with him, fist fighting.\nHe fought with him, but he had a pistol or something and he hit him, the Jewish boy. And\nhe started bleeding and they took him, and interesting, they didn't kill him. They took him\naway to a hospital, and they kept him there. The Germans kept him there for a long time\nuntil he healed. When he was healed, they took him out and Dolp said, \"He's mine.\u201d He\ntold him, \"Run away now in the field.\u201d He told him, \"Run.\u201d He ran and, and he killed\nhim. That was this, but he was a hero this guy. He fought with him. In the beginning, he\nwas really fighting. I don't remember his name. I'm sorry I don't.",
        "Q: It's not usual for prisoners \u2014",
        "A: It was impossible. Not prisoners \u2014 nobody, nobody dared to, to fight with the German\nbecause they were killing. Right away, before you even start \u2014 before \u2014 but somehow he\nwas fighting him. He didn't kill him right away. But then he hit him. He didn't shoot him.\nHe hit him hard. That was interesting. But then he shot him when he told him to run\naway.",
        "Q: You mentioned partisans before. How did you learn about partisan activities?",
        "A: Partisan activities I told you this man \u2014 this Pole told me what is going on. They're\nrunning away. Pollacks and Jews are running away and they form an army. I didn't know.\nIn, in my mind, it was a army again because I was in the army before I was in Hachshara.\nI was always like in a scout and this was in my mind, it will be like the army. It is not a\npartisans, I have no idea what it is. And when we came these two guys start leading us,\nstarting showing us what to do, how to do. And the first thing we went through a water.\nWe had to , a Small river and we had to take off the shoes and they showed us\nhow to cross and by one by one we crossed the water and we came on the other side. And\nthen they brought us over to a place in the woods, deep in the woods and he said \u2014 there\nwas not far a river \u2014 and he said, \"Here we will make a camp. In the night \u2014 we will go\nevery night,\u201d we were 22 people, \u201cOn \u2014 11 under your leadership and the other 11 going\nwith...,\u201d Kaganowicz was the other guy \u2014 he was a leader too. \u201cWe will go \u2014 11 people\nwe will go into the farmers in the night.\u201d I had the map, I had the compass and every\nnight we went to another village there around the woods. Not far. And we walked in, and\nthe Pollack went with us, one of them and one went with the other. And they knocked on\nthe window in the night and they said, \"We are fighters for Poland,\" into the windows\nbecause people were scared. They woke up in the middle of the night and there's people\nwith \u2014 with rifles or whatever. Nobody had a rifle. Nobody nothing. You know what we\ndid. We took some wood and we put it on, on a string and I had a pistol. And I speak very\ngood Polish and I was always the speaker for them and I came over and I said \u2014 because\nmost of our Jews, they didn't speak a good Polish. They spoke Yiddish most of them and\nhalf Russian because their guys were the other side, but I spoke Polish, I went to school.\nAnd I came over and I said, \"I'm fighting for Poland for, for your freedom. We don't want\nnothing from you. Just give us some food and we will go away. Some milk, bread.\u201d We\nwere always taking some bread for the people for another 11 people back. And that was\nhappening every night we were going to another village and until we exhausted already\naround this, we said, \"Let's go somewhere else.\u201d And we start moving. And then Pollacks\nthen too said, \"Listen, you cannot walk around like this, rifles without on you. They will\nkill us. Any day the \u2014 the farmers will tell the Nazis or somebody and they will kill us\nall.\u201d \"Give us \u2014 you have some money. You have some money or something? Give it to\nme and we will go out back to Lublin and we will buy some rifles or get some pistols or\nwhatever.\u201d And they walked \u2014 they took everything what we had and they walked away\nfrom us. And I don't see them till today. I don't know what really happened. If they were\ncaught or something like that, but we never heard from them. And then we were on our\nown. And then we start moving.",
        "Q: Okay, before we start moving on again, we're going to take a minute now and relax and\nchange the tape and start up again. So you've done beautifully.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Thank you.",
        "A: So far, alright?",
        "Q: So far, better than alright. My camera man is just fascinated.",
        "A: What does he say? Interesting or not?\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #2",
        "Q: Okay, Mr. Gruber, you brought us to the point where there were 22 of you, who had gone\ninto the forest with the two Polish partisans. You told us that the partisans then took your\nmoney, your belongings, left, went back into the city and \u2014 never to be seen again. This\nleft you with 21 other men. Could you tell us about what your thoughts were when you\nsaw yourself there with 22 \u2014 21 other men, facing an unknown situation?",
        "A: It was a very, very hard situation, we \u2014 also we were already on the last few days in the\nwoods. But still we relied more or less on the Polish two guys, when they came over to\nthe farmers, they helped with this. Because the farmers, we knew, didn\u2019t like Jews\nspecifically. That\u2019s why I changed my name to Mietek, this is a real Polish \u2014 Mieczyslaw\nand short is Mietek. And almost every one of our group took a Polish name, that they\nshouldn\u2019t \u2014 also we talked Yiddish between ourself and we, we were a Jewish group,\nalmost everybody knew, but we didn\u2019t want to be so obvious in dealings with the farmers\nto say that Jews. And they always had that imagination that a Jews is not a soldier, a Jew\ndoesn\u2019t know what a rifle is, a Jew doesn\u2019t \u2014 he\u2019s different than all of them. The\ndifference what meant a lot, that they, they \u2014 some of them they didn\u2019t see a Jew, but they\ntold them the story about this. Then, this reminds me when I was in Germany. One day\nthey took me to a farmer to work in the farm and when they came time to lunch they took\nme home and I was sitting by the table and there was a young girl, a German girl. And I\nwas talking fluently German, I spoke to her, and she spoke to me, and I saw she likes me,\nshe\u2019s talks to me. Then she starts talking about Jews, \u201cBecause of the Jews the war broke\nout. Because of the Jews the \u2014 this, this, this.\u201d I asked her a plain question, \u201cDid you ever\nsaw a Jew?\u201d She said, \u201cNo, I never saw.\u201d I said, \u201cHow you know what it 1s?\u201d She said\n\u201cHitler said that they are killer, that they are this, this, this. And they have horns,\u201d she\nsaid, \u201cthey have horns. Jews have horns.\u201d I said, \u201cListen darling, I am a Jews and I have\nno horns.\u201d She almost died. I couldn't believe it, what kind of faces she made then and\nshe \u2014 she ran out from the house and she was so excited and so this \u2014 and she came back\nand said, \"You are lying to me. That's impossible,\" she said. \u201cYou couldn't be it.\u201d I was a\ngood looking young fellow in a uniform and she couldn't believe it. And that was the, the\nimage of the Jews. It was only \u2014 they didn't know even, who a Jew is. But the image of a\nJew was, for them, something that \u2014 terrific, was with horns or some devil or something a\nJew is not a normal person. That is what they \u2014",
        "Q: That's a interesting story. We will get to that later.",
        "A: That's why I came to the farmers when we came. The Pollacks helped us out and they,\nthey were the front, and now we had to be the front and I was the front always because I\nspoke very good Polish and I always came in and like I told before, I was introducing\nmyself and I told them why I was here. Then, when we exhausted the neighborhood, we\nstarted moving away from there. But before we moved, we had a problem. We had a boy\nwith us from Majdanek, and this boy run away from Majdanek in a special way. He\njumped in \u2014 they took out the, the \u2014 I don't know how to tell it in English, from the, from\nthe horses, the, the\u2014",
        "Q: Manure.",
        "A: Manure. And he jumped in into this. And the farmer didn't see him and he was almost\nchoked to death there but he \u2014 he came out from there with a horse manure from\nMajdanek. It was almost impossible to get out from that. He came out from there. And\nsomehow the Pollacks from the Underground, they brought him over to me. And he got\ntyphus. He became sick in the woods. We put him in, in our \u2014 1n a hole somewhere. They\ncovered him up because it was cold already in October. And we kept him like this and\nfrom himself, he got better and we were waiting for him to get better. In meantime, we\nwere 22 people, and three of our people said, \"That's enough.\u201d They don't want to go run\nlike this. \u201cIt is no use. They will kill all of us, and it's very hard life. I'd rather go in a\ncamp where I have a soup and they gave me some work to do. The Germans will not\nkill.\u201d And three of our people went back to the camp.",
        "Q: How do you feel about their leaving?",
        "A: It was a terrible shock to me. I couldn't believe it because we went through so much by\nrunning away, and they jeopardized other people and all this, and they, they knew about\nthis, but you can't judge people. You don't know. Everybody has his own mind, and it\nwas very hard. The beginning was so hard it's unbelievable. I was really scared. I didn't\nknow where I am. When I came in, I saw the woods. It, it was a special wind blowing\nfrom the woods with a noise, the Pollack said, \"Here, this will be your home now.\u201d To\nwalk in into this, and it was dark when we walked in into the woods and in the woods, it\nwas \u2014 the animals were making a lot of noise and it \u2014 and I came from a, from a town,\nnothing \u2014 a village and it was scary. And one of them trees was something broken. It\nmade so much noise that we didn't know that it was a wounded animal or something like\nthat or a human being or something and one of our people jumped up to the tree and he\ncut it off and he showed that was only a tree making the noise. But we were really scared.\nWe didn't know what, what to expect there. You don't know where you are. In fact, we\nreally didn't know where we were because not far from us maybe a mile or two, were\nGermans living. There they had a garrison. They lived there, and they were watching\ntheir mill. There was there a big one. But we didn't know. We didn't know for nothing.\nWe were just came in there and, and we were doing our job, going every night and back\nand forth. And it's good that we decided to go away because the farmers start talking and\nthe Germans would find out fast, and they would kill us.\nThen we went away and after a night, or two nights\u2014 I don't remember exactly how it was\n\u2014 by walking from one place to the other, only by map. Only by a compass and a map.\nWe didn't ask nobody. In the night all of a sudden we hear noises in the woods and we\nstopped, and start looking, what kind of noises, voices. We heard something like Yiddish,\nspoken and I said, \"This is something.\u201d And we over near one or two of us, the rest was\nstanding on the side, and we start screaming, \"amkha'*.\" Means \u201cyour people.\u201d And right\naway from the other side answered voice, \"amkha.\u201d And to our amazing we found a\nwhole group of people who had run away from a village. This was maybe \u2014 they called a\ntown Markuszow, what they called it, a village Markuszow. The whole town of there was\nmaybe 100 people or whatever run away from this camp. And they all came to the woods.\nAnd there were ladies and men and children, a camp. And between them were two\nRussian prisoners of war who had run away also from a camp, from a prisoners of war\ncamp. They run away from a Russian camp. They run away. One was Kolka \u2014 one was\nMikoi\u2014 Tolka, Tolka, and Mikoi, was the two men there. One was a officer and the\nother was a sergeant or something from the Russian army. And when they saw us\u2014 we\ncame in uniforms, we were all in uniforms from the prisoner of war \u2014 oh, he got so\nexcited and he \u2014 they took us over and he start talking and we looked around and we saw\nthey were building bunkers. You know what a bunker is? They were building in the land\n\u2014 they were building some hiding places there, and they put up trees or grass. They\ncovered everything and they were living down in this hiding place.",
        "Q: Why don't you take a minute and tell us about what these bunkers really did look like?",
        "A: They are bunker, bunker was interesting this. I, I can't shake it from me because I hated\nthe bunkers, as to me it looked like a grave. You go in a graveyard right there, cause they\nhad a door in the front where you walked in from the side, and the top it was like grass.\nYou didn't see nothing on top. It was woods there around and trees and everything and\ndug. They dig into the, into the earth.",
        "Q: How far down did they go?",
        "A: Far. There was for a 20 people here. And one, one bunker was for 40 people. Far, big\nand it was two entrances. One for them to walk in and one to walk out. Far away to walk\nout. Took a long, long time and when they built, they built 1t open you know. Then they\ntake woods. They put on top and they covered it. And when it was raining, rain came in \u2014\nstill not all the way, but 1t came in still someway. When I saw this, I said, \"No, not for\nme. I didn't come in here to, to, to lay in \u2014 then the Germans will come in, and it's very\neasy to get all of us.\u201d And I said, \"No. I will not stay here.\u201d And I told this Tolka and\nsaid, \"It's not for me.\u201d He said, \"If you want to stay.\u201d He said, \"I have children and I have\nwomen. I have people. Where will \u2014 what will I do with them?\" They have to be placed\nsomewhere and hidden. They said, \"Okay, we will be around you and we will work with\nyou.\u201d But then he says, \"Please, give me somebody what is a soldier and discipline he\nknows because all of them come from towns and they're children and they don't know\nwhat army is, what soldiers is, what it is. Give me a few people of yours.\u201d And they will\n'8 Your people (Hebrew)\nteach, start learning them the skill of the army. And I said, \"Okay.\u201d And I left Jegier,\nCygan, I remember the name, and the woman Gottlieb(ph) her name, three or four I left\nwith Tolka. And they were, they were starting working with him. I went away. But we\nkept contact all the time. We \u2014 through other farmers \u2014 how it happened, Tolka had\nalready connections.\nHe came to a town, Garbow and in this town was a man. His name was Kaminski, Genek\nKaminski. This was a known and this Genek was something what we have to thank a lot.\nHe was \u2014 I think he was a communist before he war or at least a socialist, I don't know\nwhat \u2014 and he belonged to a group of people and he had some people there working\nagainst the Germans. And this Tolka brought me over to him. He introduced me to him.\nAnd we start working from this, this was our like headquarters. This Tolka had\nconnections with the real partisans \u2014 not partisans special, but with the heads of the\npartisans. He had connections with the A.L.'\u2019. This was army in Armia Ludowa. There\nwas a Gomulka\u201d\u2019 and there was a Moczar\u2019', and there was Zymierski\u201d\u201d and there were all\nthe heads of Poland which were later on the Polish government, and he had some\nconnections with these people. And little by little he almost gave his orders, instead of\nthem, too. But we lost \u2014 we became appointed with Genek. In the nights we came to him,\nand he was taking care of us now. He was sending us out for special work. He told us\nwhich farmers have rifles or ammunition or something and he said, \"Go to this farmer\nand tell him he should give you a rifle. If he doesn't, you do whatever you feel like\nbecause he has it.\u201d\u201d And we did. And with the help \u2014",
        "Q: When you say, you did \u2014 could you describe one such action?",
        "A: We came, we came \u2014 first of all, we needed always help now from this Markuszow\npeople. We were in touch with them. They had Jegier with them and he was teaching.\nAnd we were taking out some of them people like Sever Rubinstein and others, and they\nwere going with us also. First of all, they knew the terrain. They know where to go. And\nwe were strangers. We were not from this neighborhood, and this was very, very\nimportant. They knew every piece, every house, every farmer, every \u2014 they, they knew\neverything around there, and it was very, very helpful for us. Especially was one of them\nguys a young fellow was Franek Bleichman. He came from another town. We met also.\nHe wasn't from this town from\u2014 what's name \u2014 Markuszow. He was from Kamionka, a\nsmall town. And he came out with a small group of his people, of Jewish people\u2014 young,\nyoungsters. He was maybe 18, 19 years. He wasn't a army man too, but he was very\nshrewd and he was \u2014 he knew the neighborhood. His father, I think, was dealing with\nfarmers or something and he was taking him with him, and he knew around the\n'9 Armia Ludowa\n0 Wladyslaw Gomulka\n*1 Mieczyslaw \u201cMietek\u201d Moczar\n*2 Michal \u201cRola\u201d Zymierski\nneighborhood. And this Bleichman became very handy to us and he was always helping\nus, going when we needed in the night for a \u2014 certain things. Because this Tolka \u2014 no,\nGenek Kaminski, he gave us orders now already. He told us, \"Go in this and this place\nand there is \u2014 a train going through.\u201d And we took axes and very primitive things,\nshovels and all this, and take away a piece of rail, of rail. A train will come. It will fell off\nfrom this. And the first action was \u2014 the train was right in the beginning. And we came\noff \u2014 I remember I had a very strong man. Zelazny\u201d was his name, zelazny~* means iron.\nAnd we called him \u201cZelazny,\u201d because he was so strong, and he, he ripped out with those\n\u2014 almost with his hand, he ripped out a piece of the rail and but we still \u2014 he ripped it out\nbut it was staying still. He didn't \u2014 he didn't take it away. And with axes, we were\nworking there for hours until we heard a train coming. A train coming, and we stay away\nand the train stopped. It stopped there because when the train saw that something was\nmissing or something later, the train stopped. But it disrupt already maybe a whole night\nand a whole day the communication because they, they were dragging who knows what \u2014\nsome ammunition to the front. It was on the way from Lublin to Warsaw. This, this was\nthe spot. And we disrupted already this. Its \u2014 but we couldn't stay there too long, because\nwe were afraid and we came back and we told this Tolka, reported to him that we did this\nand this. He was very happy, and this gave us some kind of a lift. \u201cOh, we can do\nthings!\u201d\nThen he sent us out on the highways. We put up a metal string to the highways. When a\ncar came, it had to stop. We stopped them and we were on the sides waiting for them. We\nhad a few rifles already from the farmers what we took. But interesting was this. One of\nour man \u2014 his name was Finkel\u2019? \u2014 went back to the camp where I was working and there\nwas another hospital too, and there were rifles and there were pistols and they were \u2014\nwhat's the name \u2014 other things, what do you need? Coats, because when I ran out I\ncouldn't take nothing with me. It was still warm. Nobody has a \u2014 nobody had a coat with\nhim. It was cold. It start to be cold, so we were shivering cold. And we sent out this\nFinkel. He did \u2014 didn't look like a Jew completely. He was looking like a Pollack. And he\nwent back to the camp and he organized there another 20 people. But this time they took\na German and they told him \u2014 they were dealing with him, like I told you, the Jews were\nhelp \u2014 dealing with them Germans there. They told him, \"You see and look. Don't say\nnothing.\u201d And they put on the rifles and uniforms and what's the name \u2014 covers and bed\nspreads and all kinds of things, a full truck, and he was dealing with them before \u2014\nrobbing them to sell things, but he didn't know what is going on and we had \u2014 Finkel\nknew where we will be there in the woods. He made a an appointment with him, and he\nbrought over the whole truck with maybe about 20 rifles. New ones, German ones.\nCompletely new ones! And he brought it over to us on the spot. The German, that was\none of the guy who was the leader from the Dworecki was his name. He said to the\nGerman, \"You go back and shut up. Don't say one word, you know us. You saw nothing,\n3 \u201cZelazny\u201d Eisenberg\n74 Tron (Polish)\n*\u00b0 Stefan Finkel\nbecause they will kill you, or we will kill you. Then just don't say nothing.\u201d \"No, I will\nnot say nothing,\" and let him go.",
        "Q: That's an incredible story. How, in fact, did Finkel arrange to\u2014",
        "A: Finkel went back too, because he knew the place. He was living there before, and he\nknew how to get in. And he walked into the people there in the hospital there and he\ncontacted himself with this group, and the people Dworecki was there like a Mikoi the\nwhole group, about 20 people. And he talked to them. He was there two, three days. We\nknew what is it \u2014 we will be like this two, three days and we had a appointment with him\nto come back on this and this spot. And he \u2014 they knew \u2014 he knew that they are dealing\nwith this German too. He knew always, of course, because he was dealing with this\nGerman, too. And they took out whatever they wanted.",
        "Q: But to deal, you needed money?",
        "A: No. You needed money if you would buy it, but they didn't. They told them \u2014 they took\nout a pistol from the \u2014 and they said to this German, \"You go back. No money for you.\nYou just thank God for your life and get back and don't say nothing to nobody.\u201d And he\nwent back and we had the rifles. I received \u2014 I remember a German coat I put on and a\nhat \u2014 the German I put on.",
        "Q: How did you feel?",
        "A: And I felt, I felt in two ways. First of all, I got warmer because it was very, very cold, but\nI felt very bad that I have to wear a uniform from a German. That was always\ninconceivable. This was something what \u2014 goodness! But we felt proud for the whole\nsituation what we did because this was nobody could accomplish a thing like this. This\nwas a big accomplishment to bring 20 rifles, new ones, on the spot.",
        "Q: Now, you had a small army.",
        "A: We had a small army. We had already this and we told this Tolka all of them. We told\nthem what we have now and what is. Everybody was happy. We start doing real work.\nWe start going out for the Germans on the highways. Then we start the towns. Every\ntown had a town house, and in this town house they were registering everybody and\nwhen you were registering the people, the Germans were using it. One second, I have to\ndrink. The Germans registered almost every young Pollack. They registered even the\nJews, whatever the registration in the \u2014 in the town house. We got our order to recover\nthis, to fight and to burn it out, ruin it that they shouldn't have the registrations from the\npeople there because they took it away to Germany. They took it away to work. They\nhave a register. They came up home, and they took up the kids and we start burning up\nthe towns. Every town house there, and Markuszow was the first we knew where to go.\nWe always used the people what were from there from this town, say from Markuszow\nsay from \u201d \u00a2 and other towns where they have \u2014 we had the people what run\naway from them villages. And they were together with us then.",
        "Q: But now, how was it possible for you and your small army to burn down a building.",
        "A: It was, 1t was very easy. We took some straw and we threw in straw and made a fire.",
        "Q: Nobody saw you enter?",
        "A: They saw, and they didn't say. Some people \u2014 the Pollacks they saw, they were afraid of\nus because we came with rifles and then they \u2014 it was night. Always in the night we were\ndoing it. And we were burning. It was very, very easy for us. We would \u2014 except once we\nhad in Markuszow we had some going over. The Germans were there, and \u2014 but before,\nbefore we came in the Germans were there. And by accident, they saw our people and we\nhad to fight with them. And we still burned down. It was a whole story. Is a very long\nstory. And we still burned down the village. But we had losses there. One was killed, and\none was Zelazny the strongest guy what we had had still today, still today had a piece of\niron from the bullet was in him, staying there. Didn't come out.",
        "Q: During this action as you described, what was your responsibility?",
        "A: I was the leader. As I was going with them, people, first of all, this not like in other\narmies. A partisan, the leader had to go front. That was our \u2014 I don't know why, but we\ntook over the \u2014 a leader was in the front, and the soldiers were behind. Here I think is the\nother way around. I remember in the army it was the other, other way. The officer was in\nthe back and the soldiers were going in the front. I remember in the war, the old officers\nwere in the back and the soldiers were in the front. Then here we changed it. I was\nalways in the lead. I had to go in the front. Wherever you went, I had always with me let's\nsay a Bleichman or another one, what knew the terrain and I was in the front, going and\nthey were after me. That's what we was scared stiff. Every night when you go, you don't\nknow what will happen. Who will shoot or who will do something to you, you\nunderstand? You didn't know if you will meet Pollacks what are against you \u2014 I'm sorry.\nOne second. I don't know what happen. All of a sudden, some food or whatever. But you\nhad to do it. You cannot tell the people that you are afraid. You had to go. You had to\nlead. And it was like a army. We got orders, you know, to burn down this and this\nvillage. And we did it. Next, we had this group of our people went out for food one night,\na separate group, small, and on the way back some Polish people called over two of them\nwhat they knew them by name. Morel, and the other one I don't remember. Morel and the\nPollacks, young boys from the same town where this Jew was, called him over, said,\n\u201cMorel, come over here.\u201d And he had a machine gun this guy and they called him over. It\ndidn't took long and they killed them, both of them. The Pollacks. And the rest of this\ngroup, was maybe four or five came running to us in the middle of the night. Running,\nand they left everything because they had some food something, and they left everything\nand said, \"You know, they killed Morel, and the killed the other one. Two guys.\u201d We\nmade a meeting from a few people there and we could talk to this Genek Kaminski came\nover to him because we wanted to find out exactly who did it because we didn't know\nwho killed him. We knew the village where it happened. Then after meeting is an end, we\ndecided to burn down the, the whole village. And we burned down the whole village.\nCame over at night from one corner to the other. But one thing we didn't, we didn't kill\nthe people. We told them to run out before we went from one place to the other. We had\nstraw and as we had other, I think gasoline a little, I think, we took, too, petroleum or\nsomething we had. We pour a little bit match and burned the whole village. It was a very\n\u2014 one of the, one of the richest villages there around.",
        "Q: How did that make you feel?",
        "A: This was \u2014 it didn't feel good altogether because we had to live with them Pollacks. We\ndidn't come to fight with the Pollacks, and we left them and I remember I wrote myself a\npiece of paper in Polish. I was \u2014 by the way, I was writing almost everything what I went\nthrough by the day. I had a paper, a book with me, paper and a pencil and I was writing\ndown almost everything what happened. But I will tell you later what happened to it. And\nI wrote them a leaflet like that said, \"You see what you're doing. You kill our people. We\nhave to kill you. We didn't come to fight with you. We want to fight the Germans, and I\nthink you supposed to help us and not going against us and on top of this to kill our\npeople.\u201d I left notes and left this. Then we had a case like this. We were in a farm house.\nAnd a Polish man there which lived there went to the Germans, and he told them. The\nGermans came and somehow we, we were always soldiers. That's what's good for us\nbecause we were watching. We had a watch outside, a watch inside. If we were sleeping,\nwas still was a watch. One or two was watching. I was on the watch there outside and I\nsee a lineup of Germans coming. It was on a hill. We were in a house and downstairs,\ndown below the Germans are coming. I woke up everyone of us, put on \u2014 we had to \u2014 we\nstart running out from the house because when they came to a house near that's it.\nNobody could get out because they threw like we did. Straw or something and they start\nshooting with fire, ammunition, and they burned down the houses and they burned down\nthe people there. We ran out and we run away a whole day, we had to fight with the\nGermans. We ran, shoot back, run and shoot back. No one of our people was killed there\nin this skirmish. In the night, the Germans disappeared. They left us alone. We went back\nto this village, and we went to the house where this happened where we left, left the\nhouse and we said, \"What's going on?\" The man wasn't there already and the son wasn't\nthere and we start asking people. They said, \"The son went to the Germans and he told\nthem that we are there.\u201d So, \"Good. We will stay there and watching.\u201d And all of a\nsudden I see there a young, a youngster walks and I called him over, say, \"Who are you?\"\nHe said, \"Oh, I didn't want to. I\u2014 They \u2014 My father told me to go.\u201d It was the guy what\nwe slept there, and he said his father told him to go to report to the Germans, you know,\nthis. \"I will work with you. I will be with you and please don't kill me. Don't.\u201d We took\nhim away. We really didn't want to kill him. Just want to beat him there, you know, a\ngood beating, but I saw him. Of course, a man like this if he goes report the Germans,\nhe's a spy already against us. This is nothing. Then we took him out in the outskirts and\nstart beating him up. He was screaming there. Then one of our people saw that he\nscreams too loud, took out the rifle and they killed him. I was sorry that they killed him,\nbut still it was coming to him. When he killed him \u2014 he shot him it made a noise. The\nshot and the Germans were not far, and they start shooting at us and they started, but it\nwas night and we just got away. The next day they buried this boy, the Pollacks or two\ndays in the churchman. What is the name? The Pope. What is the name?",
        "Q: Priest.",
        "A: The priest said to the congregation, \u201cListen, people, you see what's going on. When a\ngroup of people come in...\u201d",
        "Q: It's okay. Take your time.",
        "A: This will come out there too.",
        "Q: Why don't you pick it up then when you were talking about how the priest.",
        "A: Yes, exactly. That's what I'm going to bring out, because it was very important. And the\npriest came over and said, \"Listen people. You see what's going on. We have the\nGermans on one side. We have the partisans on the other side \u2014 the Jews, the Pollacks or\nwhatever it is. The Jew \u2014 the Germans are our \u2014 is our enemy number one. This group 1s\ncoming to you. They want some food in the night and they're going away. They don't stay\nwith you. Don't report them. Don't tell nothing because you will be squeezed in both\nsides. They will kill you. See here is a boy killed for nothing,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause he, he\nwent to the Germans and he told.\u201d He said, \"Don't do it any more.\u201d The priest said that.\nThis helped a lot. Like I say, the priest \u2014",
        "Q: How did you know that the priest gave this sermon?",
        "A: Oh, the Pollack, they told me. The farmer's group. When I went to the farmers, I came in.\nI was home because I repeat the places. When I went over to a farmer and he was nice to\nus. You know, the farmer. Because some of them, they were not too nice. They just gave\nus what we wanted and get out. Some of them were really nice. They kept us. They told\nus to stay with them. Then we came to them back, and they told us what is going on.\nThey told me the priests spoke like this, and the priest told them and knew he told them\nalso. He said, \"Why do you have to go to call the Germans? The Germans are far away.\nThey don't know what is going \u2014 coming in the, in the woods. If you told them, they\nknow.\u201d And this made a big difference. Big, because people stop, stopped bothering us.\nThey stopped, except they let us go. We came in. We did our work. We did never, never\nabuse them people because there were groups like robbers or something people came in\nthey run away. They were on the German's hands or whatever, and they formed also, not\npartisans groups \u2014 bandits from this, and they came in usually and they took away\nwhatever the farmer had. But we came in like gentlemen you know. We came in with a\nspeech. I said \u2014 I told them, \u201cWe're fighting for freedom. We don't want nothing from\nyou. We just want to eat something and we want to relax or to sleep a few hours.\u201d And\nthis one farmer told the other, and they knew what's going on. Now \u2014",
        "Q: Were your \u2014 did your group have it's own identify?",
        "A: \u201cThe Mietek,\u201d \u201cthe Mietek Grupa\u201d\u00b0,\u201d \u201cGroup of Mietek,\u201d \u201cthe Group of Mietek.\u201d The\ngroup \u2014 lots of things later on: \u201cThe Group of Jegier,\u201d names the people knew.",
        "Q: This was your group.",
        "A: My group, \u201cMietek.\u201d Everybody knew about it and they knew \u2014 the farmers knew about\nme, and they knew about this recommend. In fact, there was a, a landowner, very rich\none, and he always gave us money when we came. And he gave us a cow or whatever,\nwhatever we wanted. Horses we needed to go from one place to another. He always gave\nus. Then he gave it when I was there. If the group came in without me, he wouldn't give.\nHe wouldn't give. Nothing.",
        "Q: Why was that?",
        "A: I don't know. He had a mind something, and I think he was right after this. After the war,\nthis landowner was arrested for helping the Germans like because he had Germans there\nalso in the landowners house. And he called me as a witness that I should tell the court\nhow he helped, how he gave money you know. And he said, said \u201cI didn't gave no money\nto nobody, only you. You should be the witness. You should know about it.\u201d And he used\nit after the war. He gave money only to me. We used the money for all kinds of things we\ngave the farmers.",
        "Q: How, how much time had you spent in the woods with your group of men before you\nreached the point where you were confident about your leadership?",
        "A: It took time to be 100 percent confident in this. It was very, very hard. I will tell you\nstraight. With Jewish people, it is very, very hard to be a leader. Every one of our Jewish\npeople were a leader himself. They knew a lot you know. They are not dummies.\nEveryone of them, and to be a leader by Jews, you really have to have guts and you have\nto have patience and you have to have \u2014 I don't know what \u2014 to be a leader, but this is no\njokes. This is I tell you at this \u2014 what's the Ben-Gurion?\u2019 said it was, \u201cI am a president of\nmillion presidents.\u201d And that was very, very hard for Jewish people this. But there was a\nnecessity. I have the upper hand because I spoke fluent Polish. When I came to a farm or\n6 Group (Yiddish)\n7 David Ben-Gurion\nsomething I had \u2014 I had to speak because most of them spoke Yiddish and the language\nwas difficult. Only Szengut was the guy what \u2014 but he looked so Jewish and so Yiddish\nhe couldn't, he couldn't represent us you know. It was \u2014 we had to push him a little bit on\nthe side. Now, we established our presence in the neighborhood, but we felt we couldn't\nstay too long in the neighborhood. They told us not to stay, and we didn't. We felt \u2014\nbecause we exhausted \u2014 I came twice \u2014 three times to the same farmer. He didn't have\nwhat to eat himself to watch this, and we had to go farther. Then I decided to go with the\ngroup of 10 people to find out \u2014 because they were talking about other groups on the\nother side of the Bug. We were \u2014 there was \u2014 when you see the map, there was a, a \u2014 this\nriver, Wieprz, is the name \u2014 Wieprz and the next was the Bug. The Bug was the border\nfrom Poland and Russia already later. But we were between the Wieprz and the Bug\nlater. In the beginning, we were on the other side of the Wieprz. We had to cross. And we\ncrossed over the Wieprz and we knew that between the Wieprz and Bug 1s a group \u2014 1s\ngroups, partisans there that we heard about. You know they told us, the farmers. There\nwas no telephones, but we heard that.\nWe had connections all the time. This Genek, his connections was saving us always. We\nknew when the Germans going out from Lublin with a expedition of something, we knew\nabout it. They told us. The farmers, one told the other and they told us. We had the\nconnections. We had this. And only with connections we could live through. We were\nlaughing already there when I was going sometimes in the night. I laughed and said what\ngroup 1s going again that meetings to get a connection then. I felt that is the way to be\nbecause when you are a group, you live by yourself, and you don't know \u2014 no telephones,\nnothing. You don't know what's going to come next, and they were spying. You have to\nhave this. You have to know what your neighbor's doing. You have to know what's going\non, and you have to know the other groups. You have to know what's in the, what's going\non in the country or in Russia. We knew about politics. We knew everything was in the\nfront. This in the front. This we knew everything what's going on. I was reading papers. I\nwas seeing everything clearly. Otherwise, we couldn't live. It was impossible. Of course,\na lot of groups were \u2014 a lot of Jews run away, and they didn't have the organization. They\ndidn't have the connections and they disappeared. They disappeared. The Pollacks killed\nthem themselves or somehow the Germans \u2014 they told the Germans. They disappeared.\nDisappeared group by group disappeared. And I went through this Wieprz. There was a\nwhole story how we went through that. And we came over on the other side, and I was so\ntired. Unbelievably tired. And I was sorry that I brought them people on the other side\nbecause we were walking two days and two nights. We didn't know where we are going.\nCompletely! We were \u2014 like I say, I didn't have the connection. I didn't have the people\naround me. The neighborhood there I knew already. I knew where I'm going. And here I\ndidn't know nothing. And we walked over to a farm, and we woke up a woman there and\nshe start screaming and crying, \"Please don't do this.\u201d I said, \"Don't worry. We will not\ndo nothing to you. Just let us in.\u201d She said, \"No, I can't because I have a child 1s sick.\nVery sick. He had typhus or something and you will catch it too. Don't go in.\u201d Said,\n\"Okay, we will go in the barn.\u201d We went in the barn. We were dead. We were so tired of\nwalking. I think it will start snowing or something later and there was a real night, I felt\nhalf, half dying. And I lay down in the, the barn and all our people. We always kept one\nmen to watch and all of a sudden maybe it was day already. I wake up and I see nobody's\nwatching. Nobody! I woke up, and I was a very sleeper \u2014 I, I could hear everything\nalways when sleep. I don't know why. This was nature or something. I could hear\neverything. Whatever happened in sleep always, I could hear it. Then I walked over \u2014 I\nwoked up, I went over to the door to the barn and I see, all of a sudden, I see Germans,\nPolish uniforms, the police, and farmers and the whole posse but still forming, still going.\nAnd I woke up my people very fast. And we walked out with the front and shooting at\nthem. They were not still organized. They were still starting something then, and we start\nshooting at them. And walked around the barn, and we start running away. Because they\nwere an army there. Who knows how many? I didn't know. And we start running,\nrunning and we \u2014 I see very bad. There's no trees, nothing. We are only a few houses\nthere, and it is a field. They have a good field for us to shoot us when we running. They\ncan shoot everybody. And little by little we start moving away, moving away and all of a\nsudden, I see one guy fall beside and then I see another one fall. They were not dead. Just\none was shot in the foot, and one was somewhere else shot and he said, \"Please take my\nrifle. I am dead. They will kill me anyway.\u201d I said, \"I don't need your rifle. I have mine.\u201d\nI couldn't do nothing. Then all of a sudden I feel a shot. It was my finger here. I have still\nthe finger here like this, shot here right here. I squeezed my hand. I see blood. Yes, I took\nout, I don't know, a handkerchief or something. I put it on. I didn't make a big deal of it. I\nwas walking, walking. All of a sudden I feel a shot in my foot, in my leg. Yeah, right\nhere. Through. And I cannot walk no more. I cannot walk. I was trying you know.\nSzengut right behind me, and he start pulling me. He said, \"You have to walk.\u201d In the\nmeantime, the rest of the people \u2014 we were about 10 or 12 \u2014 start moving. You know,\nthey cannot wait for me. They see this one 1s laying, another is laying, and he, he didn't\nleave me alone. He starts pulling me, and I start walking and walking. I see I still can\nwalk. The bone wasn't touched. And this was luck. It was just the meat here that was shot\nhere. And I could walk. It was bleeding a little bit, but I still walked.\nAnd we run over to a house there and we told the farmer, \"Fast put on a horse and\nwagon,\u2019 Szengut said, \u201cand we will put on \u2014 I will put you down on this on the wagon\nand we will start running away with this.\u201d Then all of a sudden I see the Germans right\nby the border there when I was, I was there. They came out. And one starts talking\nPolish to me. And he says in Polish, \"You're a Jew, bastard?\" or something, this. And he\naimed with a rifle this, and he didn't, I don't know, he didn't hit me. I got up and Szengut\ngrabbed me and left the horse with the wagon, and I start screaming with my people. I\nstart screaming with my people, they rest, \"Stop and start shooting back. Start shooting\nback because otherwise nobody will live.\u201d And I remember like today this one of them\nguys, it was Andrejew. He was the first one. He turned around, took out the rifle, he was\naiming at the Germans. The Germans stopped. They stopped. Right away they fell\nthrough the floor. And when he took out a few of our people. There was a Finkel there\nwas a few four or five. They took out the rifles and they start shooting back. When they\nstopped the Germans, I had time to with Szengut to run away to come over and we went\nover to a woods somewhere there around not far, and the Germans stopped a little bit\nbehind and they had three of our people and I think they, they killed there because I know\n\u2014 don't know what happened to them again. And between them was this Majdanek, this\nguy what run away from Majdanek. He was killed there right away in this skirmish. And\nI run away to the woods. In the meantime, Szengut and another one, Finkel, they both\nwent back to look. Maybe they can help somebody to \u2014 they came to a farmhouse and\nthey opened the door there, and when they opened the door Germans was sitting there. A\nwhole bunch of them was sitting there, and they were singing or eating something. You\nknow they, they had that trophy. They took away \u2014 I think they took away some money\nfrom these three guys too. They had maybe a few \u2014 I don't know what kind money. And\nFinkel closed the door and Szengut had hand grenade and they threw in there the hand\ngrenade into this, and they don't know what happened there. Then they run away, and\nthey found me. I was still waiting.\nAnd we took a farmer, stopped with a horse and wagon on this \u2014 put me on this and they\nsat down and I was with Szengut and another one and they had another \u2014 they stopped\nother farmers when they \u2014 on the way and we start moving. And on the way I asked the\nfarmer, \"Maybe you will take me home because I am shot and I cannot \u2014 my finger start\nbothering me very much, more than the foot.\u201d I said, \"I cannot walk and I cannot, I\ncannot function.\u201d He said, \"You have to be helped.\u201d I said, \"Oh no, my wife is sick and\nthere's a \u2014 I'm afraid, but I will bring you over. I have a farm and I have a man what\nworks for me, and he will keep you. He will keep you there.\u201d I said, \"Alright, whatever\nhe wanted to do.\u201d And he brought me over to another farmer and the farmer was very\nnice to me. They, they took a Band-Aid and they, they took some water. I don't know\nwhat kind of water. They washed it and they cleaned it very, very nice. They, they helped\nme out. It took almost a half a day, something, I was there sitting. All of a sudden,\nshooting again. I was with Szengut, and another Piasecki was another guy. We were there\nin the partition there. The rest of the group was in another house. Start shooting in the\nhouse. Like a thunder. Shoot directly in the house. And the farmer showed me the way\nout in the back and me and Piasecki. I got up and I said, \"Where is Henryk?\u201d I said,\n\"Where is Finkel?\u201d And I start looking back and I don't see him. And the farmer said,\n\"You cannot wait a second. Run. Run.\u201d And from the back of the farm it was already\nstart to be a little darkish and I run away with Piasecki, this guy. We run away both of us.\nAnd with my wounded foot then I had to walk a whole night. I was walking in the woods.\nWalking, walking, walking. It was day almost. I went over. I had no, no choice already. I\ndidn't know what to do myself. I walked over to a farmer. \u201cYou should help me\nsomething or give me a piece of bread or something.\u201d And I came over to the farm. The\nfarmer boy standing there came out and said, \"God, what are you doing here?\" He said,\n\"The Germans were here last night here. And they killed one of your people,\" he said.\nAnd I figure out that that was Szengut. \u201cOne of you people was killed. And they took off\neven his boots they took off because he wore new boots. He said, \"They took off his\nboots and they took him away. And you are here! How does it happen?\" I walked a\nwhole night in the woods and I came back to the same spot. You know in the night, you\ndon't know where you're going and there's a woods. You don't know it that way.\nI came back to this house. Then in the day time, what I found out, the Germans are still\nthere. They said, \"No. No. They went away. But they still come back or whatever.\u201d They\nsaid, \u201cThey knew that the partisans here, the group 1s here.\u201d I said, \"I have no choice. In\nthe daytime with this Piasecki, we were both of us we start moving back from where I\ncame. I came back and I came over to the Wieprz, to the river. There's a big river and you\nstay here a night. Cannot walk. Then all of a sudden came in a bunch, a bunch of Polish\nkids from school. They went there and they start screaming, \"Jew. Jew.\u201d I was so\ndisgusted. At least I had something in my hand like glass. I will throw this as a bomb I\nsaid, \u201cif you don't go away, if you don't stop this screaming. \u201cThey shut up and then came\nin a man. I don't know, it looked like a school teacher. He was dressed up nice. He said,\n\"What happened? You are \u2014 you have a problem here?\" I said \u2014I said, \"Yes. I want to go\nthrough the Wieprz.\u201d I said, \"How can I go?\" He said, \"Don't worry. I will show you\nwhere.\u201d He brought me over to a small house there, and there 1t was a guy with his \u2014 he\nhad this \u2014 a boat, a small boat, and he was bringing over people on other side. That was\nhis \u2014 he said, \"You have money?\" Said, \"No, I don't have no money, but I have a\nlighter.\u201d I remember a very nice lighter. I had it from Kaganowicz, I forgot to tell the\nstory. Kaganowicz was killed. And I took away a watch and some lighter and I think he\nhad some money, and I took it away from him, and I had it with me. And this lighter I\ntook out. \"Show me it works.\u201d I showed him it works. \"Okay.\u201d For this lighter, he took\nme over on the other side with Piasecki. We came over to the other side. The other side I\nknew already where farmers are and this I came over and I see a light, some a farmer. I\nsee a light. I say I was afraid. You know this? I start looking near this and I came over\nand see the rest of my people are there. And they went \u2014 the Wieprz, then they came back\nto this farmer. They knew also the farmer from before because we knew when we left.\nWe met and they said, \"Oh, you still alive. Somebody said that you are killed.\u201d They\ndidn't know. Szengut was killed because they said somebody was wounded and he was\nkilled. They knew already. Oh, they was so happy that I am alive, that \u2014 and I went back\nwith this group. I remained maybe a day or something like a whole day without them too.\nThey went for food or something and I was staying with them. It was also very, very bad.\nI was feeling very bad, but they left me and they went. But they came for me, and we\nwent together. We went back to the place that we knew before. And they came over to a\nplace where there was a bunker where I told them bunkers, and this Tolka had a bunker\nthere before, before with his Markuszow people and Jegier and all those people.\nAnd I came over. There's nobody there. They disappeared. And all of a sudden came over\na \u2014a father and daughter. Said, \"No, Tolka is no more here. He's somewhere else. They\nbuilt another bunker because he was afraid to stay here. He built for 40 people, he built a\nbunker somewhere else. I said, \"Can I meet him.\u201d The guy said, \"Wait, maybe he has to\ncome in here. Tolka has to come in here.\u201d I said, \"Alright.\u201d And it didn't take long. This\nTolka came over with Nam\u2014 with somebody else. They said, \"Look. Look here, I am\nwounded,\u201d and they said, \"I haven't got where to take you. It's full there.\" \"It's 40\npeople,\" he said, \"We have no food there. It's impossible that we should take you. No.\u201d\nWhat can I do? Then I remind myself I met a guy, Drop was his name, like a farmer, a\nPollack, what was nice to us. And I went back to him. I came back to him and he was, he\nwas so fond of me. He start kissing me. He was so, so happy to see me, and he saw me in\nthis condition and he kept me maybe a few weeks, a few weeks and all 10 of our people\nwere there. Ten \u2014 two or three was killed \u2014 about nine people. We were there in his home\nby this Drop. He went to a drug store. He bought for me some, something to cover with\nand he helped me a lot. This finger gave me a lot of trouble. I got gangrene in this finger,\nand the whole hand was so we will have to cut this hand, but I had a very strong\nconstitution and I felt good or whatever and it helped and it went away, but I have this till\ntoday. It's crooked. I can do nothing about it. I don't want to do nothing. The foot didn't\ngave me too much trouble. It was a time until it healed and I could walk and I was\nstaying there. till February 14, 1943, I was by farm \u2014 Drop\u2019s farm.",
        "Q: We're going to stop at this point and allow for another change of the tape and give you a\nchance to have another drink of water.",
        "A: Yes.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "Q: As you were telling us, you were able to work your way through the first difficult\nencounter. You were wounded and you got some help. Now, we are at the point where\nyou going to tell us about some of the experiences you had with some of the other\npartisan leaders, heroes, who had \u2014 whose names you had mentioned earlier.",
        "A: Like I said before, that in February *43, Drop, the farmer, came over to our place in the\nbarn and we were there a few weeks already. And he says, \"Listen, boys, I cannot keep\nyou no \u2014 any longer. There is a problem.\u201d I said, \"What happened.\u201d He said, \"The\nbunker, from 40 people in the bunker with Jegier , they were all killed. And I am afraid\nnow. It's not far from here,\" he said, \u201cIt was Amelin, was the name of the town there,\nvillage, and it's not far from my place and I am afraid the Germans will kill me and kill\nyou. Just tonight start walking.\u201d And we went out. We start going to farmers in the night.\nWe came over to one place, they kept us very nicely and we had a very good experience\nwith her in the night a farm woman there with a family, and they were very nice to us.\nAnd she told us that she heard also what was going on there and that they killed 40\npeople there in the bunker what Jegier and Tolka had the Russia. This was a lot of my\nfriends. I felt very, very bad and it was upsetting and we were afraid too because now the\nGermans will go after us, because we see the end. It's no way out. But we come to a farm\nlike this and we got in touch back again with Genek Kaminski and we start telling him\nthe story what happened. Then he knew too. He knew what's going on. After maybe two\ndays, we walked around. All of a sudden in the night, we see a group is walking. Who\nknows? During the night we had our things. We called \"amkha,\" we called out. That was\nour \u2014 what do you call it?",
        "Q: Code.",
        "A: Code. And we called out \"Amkha,\" and they answered \"Amkha.\u201d We said, \"Who is this?\"\n\u201cJegier.\u201d Jegier with a group of people. Of course, it was Rubinstein, there \u2014 Sever \u2014 and\nother people. \"Oh, my God, What happened?\" They said, \"They killed you.\u201d Said,\n\"Happened that we went out \u2014 14 people \u2014 we went out to forage there, to bring some\nfood for the whole group and just at this night, when we walked out the Germans came\nin. Somebody told them. The farmers told them where we are located, and they killed\nevery \u2014 they threw in hand grenades and they killed everybody in this.\u201d Tolka and Mikoi\nand these friends of mine from Markuszow \u2014 all killed. But 14 of them somehow got out.\nWe were very happy to see them and we start moving together with. But still to go\naround with a bigger group was very dangerous and not practical. When we come to a\nfarm, \"We can give you food for 10, eight people.\u201d But to feed a group for 30, 40 was\nalready a big deal. They didn't have even food for themselves. Then we divided, and\nJegier took his group, the Markuszow and others, whatever was left, and I had the\nprisoners of war I was with, but we kept very close touch. We was almost two, three\nnights we had some spots where we met. We made in advance, \u201cyou will be there and\nthere,\u201d or we knew what's going always a few days.",
        "Q: I'd like to interrupt a moment because you mentioned again you had the prisoners of war\nwith you. At any time, did you find that it was appropriate to involve women in any of\nyour activities?",
        "A: We didn't think about then about women or not women. It was very, very hard for a man\nand if a woman, it was almost impossible, but if a woman would come along, we would\nnot send her away.",
        "Q: That was our way. But after a time, we had this experience and a woman came along.\nStill we didn't take her with us, but she was near us. She went \u2014 whenever we went, she\nwas walking with us all night, and then when we stayed in a place so we had to do\nsomething. They were staying in another place. There was a woman with three men.\nWhere they came? They came from Warsaw, she and another one. Her name was, her\nname was Hanka. Her friend was Halpern, the name Halpern. They both jumped from a\ntrain what went from Warsaw to Treblinka. After the Warsaw, they had the, the fight\nthere. They run. They caught them, and they were bringing them to Treblinka. They\njumped out through the train. And when they came from the train, the farmers told them\nthat we are out. She just jumped out \u2014 this luck \u2014 she jumped on the spot but where we\nwere. But after a few days, it was just some time when we knew we had a big job with a\nlot of people there. Came in some Polish \u2014 a group of Polish people were there, and they\nand us went for a big train, and we stopped the train and we burned down ammunition\nand oil and gas and \u2014 and we took away a few Germans there. And we were not used to\nshoot people there but there was some of them, officers from the Polish group said,\n\"What are you waiting, you Jews? You are afraid to kill?\" They killed right away the\nGermans there. But we little by little we got used to this blood, but still it wasn't my, my\ngenes to kill people. I, I couldn't do it, but I want to talk to you now about helping them.\nWhen I met this Hanka, she was completely out. She was hungry and barefoot. It was\nunbelievable. One thing she has, she has a big hat. She covered her hair that they\nshouldn't see that she is a girl. She was afraid because girls was a problem. They didn't\nwant that, so she put on a hat and covered her hair. She had short hair, covered. And she\nwas in a blouse something, very, very bad shape. and I started talking to her. She told me\nthe story about Warsaw ghetto. I didn't know what happened there.\nThat's why I say through communication we find out what's going on, we found out what,\nwhat's going on, and happened she was her family or something from this leader\nAnielewicz\u201d*, and she knew what's going on there. She told us the whole story how the\nfight was going on. A lot of people run away, and they are looking for partisans to fight,\nto go somewhere. And I kept her around me. She was officially like my girl, you know,\nbecause I took care of her and I watched her, but she couldn't be with us to do some work\n*8 Mordechai Anielewicz\nor to live together in the quarters. They lived separately. And walking around there, I\ncame to a farmer and there's like a small child three, four years, a girl, laying there dirty.\nShe had \u2014 full of rats, she was \u2014 terrible situation she looked. And I took \u2014 I told \u2014 I said,\n\"Who is this child.\u201d He doesn't know, the farmer. He doesn't know. He found her on the\nstreet. I figured right away, it's a Jewish girl. And I cleaned her up and I brushed her and I\nstayed already and they special for her and I told the farmer, in no two ways, \"This girl\nhas to live and this girl you will feed and you will watch her.\u201d He said, \"I am afraid the\nother farmers will tell on me.\u201d I said, \"Good.\u201d I went out. The whole village was not too\nbig. It was a small one. And I knocked on the doors and the windows at night and I said,\n\"Listen, there will be in two weeks a young girl coming to you to live with you. You keep\nher. And this girl, if something will happen to her, you will all be burned down.\u201d \"You\nremember we burned down a place, I said to them. That will happen to you people.\u201d \"No.\nNo. I will take care of it.\u201d Thank God, they took care of this kid. It did live through the\nwar. She's today a teacher in Israel in the high school and I met her there when I was on\n81, I met her, and she's healthy. She's married, and she has a nice family and I was very,\nvery happy. She was happy to see me too. And she, she thanked me very well for this.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sure. If we think back to the actual experience of having a woman join \u2014 Hanka join\nthe group, you continued on in your military activities for some time.",
        "A: Absolutely. It had nothing to do with her. She was on the side, but I want to bring out, if\nyou talk about women, we will talk about this later. We got a order that we cannot stay in\nthis neighborhood no more. It was very dangerous there. A lot of Germans came in there.\nIn the neighborhood",
        "Q: Where did your orders come from?",
        "A: Through this Kaminski, everything goes there. We had a \u2014 name by the name: Mietek\nMoczar, he came to us. He looked a little bit like you. Tall and yes, handsome man. He\nwas, he was in a uniform for a major in the Polish army. Eloquent. The man could speak\nnice and also he came to us to pep us up, to talk to us, and he was a few weeks with us.\nMaybe two weeks, he was working with us. He took part in our actions, whatever that\u2019s\nsupposed to be done. And he was very close with me. Somehow we got friendly, and we\nkept this friendship until he died now. Later, he died in Poland. And there was another\none with the name \u201cBolek Alef,\u201d Bolkowiak\u2019\u2019. He was after the war a general in Poland.\nHe stayed in Poland. This man was also from Warsaw. He was in action in Warsaw, in\nthe ghetto and he ran away from the ghetto and he came to the woods. But he was like an\nactivist. He went, he didn't stay in one place. He was going from one group to the other,\nfrom one place to the other Polish groups and other groups. Whatever it was group he\nwas talking to as a speaker, a good one, and he was a \u2014 I think he was a lawyer for the\nwar too. Bolek Alef, he\u2019s now \u2014 he died also two years ago in Poland. And they were all\n\u2014 others they came to us. You say, \u201cWho?\u201d The people, they had the connections through\n2\u00b0 Gustaw \u201cBolek Alef\u2019 Bolkowiak\nthis Genek, he was arranging this and they came. They knew where we are, and in the\nnight we were in this and this village. We met, and this one thing when Moczar \u2014 when\nhe came, we ordered the whole village \u2014 a few villages together, and he spoke to them.\nAnd he spoke to them, he made a political \u2014 told them, \"Listen. Those partisans, they are\nfighters. They are Jews. They are doing their job and we are working together and help\nthem and work with them.\u201d It was very, very important for us because, you know, we\nwere not alone. That's what I said all the time. We were with an organization. We worked\nwith them. And this helped. All the time came in, there was a Polish group there what\nthey were fighting as partisans but they were home more. When they are needed, they\ncame out. When we did something \u2014 there's a train or something, they came with us and\nthey helped us. Was a Franek \u2014 was a guy, Przybyszowka was a village. It was a very\nimportant group because they helped us a lot. And they had some connections with\nRussia, too, and Moczar had a connection with Russia. And an order came that we should\ngo away from this.",
        "Q: Again, I'm interested in the fact that you had an order that you were following.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Your organization. How would you describe it to us?",
        "A: We were a very loose organization. We did whatever we had to do. When it came \u2014 the\nGermans came in the middle of night. When they caught us by surprise or something, we\ndidn't have to ask somebody what to do. We were on our \u2014 on our \u2014 on our own. And\nwhen Jegier said \u2014 let's say he was working with this group, he was on his own. And I\nwith my group I was on my own. And then we met and we talked together you know.\nAnd we said what we will do, where we will go, how we will do things everything\nbecause the connections what they gave us was a big help to us. First, of course, before\nthey said, they have to wait for the Russians, and this was a big thing already because\nRussia start sending material, ammunitions and this, and food even they was end people.\nThey were ending up to the back \u2014 front they came, they was partisans and they came to\nus. Everybody came to us. But we, as Jews, didn't have the, the force but together we\nwere a big group and we had a paper. We gave out a paper. It was \u2014 every action we was\ntaken is still today written down. Maybe we will be in Poland, check. If they have the\nactions of their group from Emilia Plater was the name of my group, Emilia Plater.",
        "Q: What does the name Emilia Plater stand for?",
        "A: Emilia Plater was the leader from the freedom of Poland before Poland was under Russia,\nunder Germany and Austria, years ago in the 17s. And this Emilia Plater was a fighter\nlike Kosciuszko*\u2019, Pulaski?!. She was one of them fighters against tyranny of the Czar\n3\u00b0 Tadeusz Bonawentura Kosciuszko\n3! Kazimierz Pulaski\nand we took the name, Emilia Plater. She was a woman fighter then. I had another goes \u2014\nthe first time was Kozietulski** but not too long. She was also a fighter for freedom.",
        "Q: You had mentioned earlier the relationship with the A.L..",
        "A: Yeah. That was the relationship with A.L.. The other group was the A.K., Armia\nKrajowa. Then people were \u2014 it was like here, the Republicans and the Democrats. The\ndemocrat was more to the left, they was more to the right. The A.K. wasn't \u2014 wasn't 100\npercent antisemitic, but they didn't like Jews. But they didn't let's say kill directly. They\nwere not friendly to us. But we met once in while because we caught \u2014 a guy came from\nLondon. He was thrown down by a parachute, to help the partisans, whatever. And he\nwas from the A.K. He told us right away. We caught him. He fell into our hands. And he\nstart talking to us, and he showed us how to make hand grenades, a big one he was\nmaking. And he was with us a few days. Then we brought him over. He said he wants to\ngo. He has contacts and he wants to go immediately. And you shouldn't bring him. We\nwere very careful, but we brought him over there, and they made a party for us. They\ngave us food because they knew the guy. Nothing happened to us and we were very\ncareful. We were standing outside. The whole group. We were two or three people only\nworking. Jegier and me worked, and the rest were standing outside to watch. But we\ndidn't feel comfortable with them let's say put it this way. If they \u2014 they caught a Jew\nseparately on his own, they will kill. You know, as a group, they couldn't start with us.\nThey, they \u2014 they knew that what could happen to them. They didn't want to start with us.\nBut individuals, if they caught somebody, they \u2014 they caught the Morel, I told. That was\nalso from the A.K. We burned down the whole village because of this, that\u2019s why.",
        "Q: Let's bring you toward the conclusion.",
        "A: Yeah. Then the order came we should go the other side. And when we came to the\nWieprz, then they divided us. Jegier with a group, and my group was divided Jegier went\naway with \u2014 some parachutes came down. Some Russian groups came down and he had\nto bring him over to some \u2014 kind of place. He was to stay with them. And I went over to\nthe other side of the Wieprz, between Wieprz and Bug. There were other groups there,\nand we have to unite because we cannot stay there. First of all, the terrain \u2014 the place\nwhere we were, were very antisemitic. They, they were known. We lived there from day\nto day because we had pistols, we had rifles. When we came to a farmer, he couldn't say\nnothing because he was afraid of us. But we didn't have the work with them you know.\nYou couldn't work with them. The other side were, were the White Russians. They \u2014 I\ndon't know \u2014 somehow they were better to us and they were nicer people. And then they\nhelped us and they told us to go there on the other side. And on the way, there a very big\nfight by the Wieprz, by crossing the Wieprz. The Germans were there and waiting for us\n>? Jan Leon Hipolit Kozietulski\nand we almost didn't make it to Wieprz. They, they, they made a ring around us, and they\nwere shooting and somehow someway we run through this one guy helped us with a boat,\nfrom our people other side and no one was killed. Nobody. And we came out on the other\nside, and the other side, they were shoot \u2014 the Pollacks, the A.K. were shooting on us.\nThey didn't know who this was, was all mixed up there. And the Germans pinned down a\ngroup of very, very important men from Russia that came to Janowski>\u2019, he was a writer\nfrom a main paper in Poland after the war. And they pinned them down. They couldn't \u2014\nthey couldn't move. They couldn't walk through the Wieprz, they couldn't. They stayed\non the other side. We went through again. Then again an order came back say, \"Go and\nrescue him.\u201d We went back. About four, or five people, was Bleichman, Finkel, and other\nZelazny. We went back and we took a boat, some wires, something \u2014 I don't remember\nexactly what it was. We brought over the whole group \u2014 20 people. We brought those\nwhole \u2014 oh, he said this Janowski came from Russia. He was a big shot from there\nalready. And he said, \"You will get medals for this. You, you did a job like.\u201d He was\nwounded, too. We was carrying on our hands. I remember, Zelazny, he was very strong\nman, we carried with his hands.\nWe carried him over. And we came to another place, another group, and after a few days,\nwe met Chiel Grynszpan**. Chiel Grynszpan had a group already from 40, 50 people\nthere. And then people were from the neighborhood people. He himself was a soldier. He\nwas a \u2014 whatever it is \u2014 cavalry men, on horses. He always liked to be on a horse and he\nfelt good with this. And he, he was a very plain man, a good man, and a good soldier. He\nhad a discipline with them people. We needed it because nobody knew how to keep a\nrifle, nothing. He was the only one there that knew something. There was another one\nlater on. But he \u2014 he managed. He was there immediately. When we came down, he was\nhappy. They really loved us, because we became soldiers. We became some kind of a\narmy and together right away, we started on trains. This is how highways, trains,\ncommunications lines cut and we together. Big train, but river and it was a bridge.\nThunder. We broke down the whole bridge, you know. It was on the border, the train.\nAnd the same time I was with another group, maybe a hundred people. There was\nchildren and women and all kinds of this there, and I found there. And I had to carry\nthem too. And on the way, like I say, we were the first one always to go. I walked straight\non a German with a rifle. And I walked them into the rifle. Imagine how that \u2014 how I felt.\nI stand still like a, like a dummy. I didn't know what to do. And all my people \u2014 was\nmaybe a 100 of them \u2014 all disappeared. In a second, I didn't see nobody. Myself I stand\non the highway.",
        "Q: Let's just make sure we understand. You came upon this large group of people.",
        "A: This was Chiel\u2019s people.\n3 Leon \u201cJanowski\u201d Kasman\n4 Jechiel Grynszpan",
        "Q: Chiel\u2019s people. And then you were walking with them.",
        "A: Walking with them.",
        "Q: You're in the lead.",
        "A: In the lead.",
        "Q: And then again as you were walking the lead, what happened?",
        "A: A German was standing with a rifle and I stopped. It was dark, pitch dark. A moment ago\nI was on a horse, a white horse I remember, and I had enough of the horse and I gave it to\nanother one and I was walking. In from right there. He saw us and he heard us because\nwe were talking. In Yiddish we talked, and everything was loud. Then he was by himself\nthere standing. And I came over and I saw a German. I said \u2014 I start talking German to\nhim \u2014 I said, \"Was machen Sie hier?*\u00b0\u201d \u201cWhat are you doing here in the night?\" He said,\n\"Look behind me.\u201d I looked. There's a dark like this, there's a truck, a whole truck. I said,\n\"There's more Germans?\" He said, \"Yes. There's in the truck sleeping people, and two of\nthem walked out for help.\u201d \u201cWhat happened?\u201d \u201cWe are stuck. We was \u2014 a whole column\nwent through here, and I am stuck with a few people stuck here on a truck.\u201d So, \u201cyou are\nours,\u201d we took him down.",
        "Q: Let's slow down. You were standing there.",
        "A: Yeah. Rifle \u2014 I start talk to him \u2014 he gave me the rifle. He gave me the rifle, just like\nthat. I couldn't believe it. He just handed over to me. And then all my people came up \u2014\nget up, took over the women, and he walked up. I said, \"There's somebody in.\u201d He said,\n\"Yes.\u201d \"Wake him up.\u201d We woke up two guys. One was a black uniform from SS like,\nand the other one was in a plain uniform. And he said, \u201cTwo went away, but I don't know\nwhere they are, but two are here.\u201d And all three we took away and the, the truck we\ndestroyed completely, and we took out a lot of rifles there, ammunition, and some\ncommunications they had, wire, some radio something. We destroyed everything\ncompletely. It took us almost a whole night to work on this and it was daylight almost in\nthe morning, and in the summer it gets six \u2014 five o'clock was there, and said, \"Let's\ndisappear from there,\" and we went.",
        "Q: It must have been an incredible experience to find three\u2014",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: German who so easily allowed themselves to be\u2014\n35 What are you doing here? (German)",
        "A: Easily.",
        "Q: How do you explain that?",
        "A: They were regular army. They weren't in a column there. They didn't know what\npartisans is. They didn't know what's going on here altogether. They didn't have an idea.\nHere comes over a man talks to him in German, and he didn't know what happened to\nhim. You know, he didn't realize that, that I am the enemy. You know?",
        "Q: You were in a German uniform at that time?",
        "A: I had a coat. I had a German coat, and I spoke German, and he didn't realize what\nhappened, and the others simply got up. And the other two simply got up. They had no\nchoice. The others had no choice because we saw them waking up. They were sleeping.\nThey were told to come out, and we were start dragging them around with me.",
        "Q: Then what happened to them.",
        "A: Then we were maybe a week maybe. Somehow we couldn't get nobody. The line of\ncommunication was very, very bad. It was times that the Germans were all over.\nWherever we moved, the Germans were there. And we had to stay still, to wait, to go\nlater. He was, was with, with his people, and I was with my people there. And I, I had\nwomen and children and everybody. This wasn't the regular group. It was just a put\ntogether. Just for one day suddenly. \u2018Cause \u2014 I will tell you how it happened. We had the\nchildren with us, and we start dragging them around and the Pollacks start screaming at\nus, \"The Germans will look for them,\" and you have to do something. I didn't want to kill\nthem. I had pity special on this one what gave me the rifle. I, I didn't feel like killing him.\nTill today, I am sorry because the man was decent you know. He, he was a soldier and he\ngave me the rifle and didn't nothing. He could shoot me like nothing. He was in \u2014 he saw\nme and he gave it, and I didn't know. And we kept him maybe a week or two until we met\nwith Chiel back again and there's another group come over there, Russians and all this,\nand we made a meeting with three or four officers. And we talked it over and said, \"They\nhave to be killed. What they doing with us, they caught \u2014 they catch us? They \u2014 not only\nthey kill us, but they torture us. They cut pieces from us.\u201d In fact, they cut one of my\npeople. They caught once. They cut pieces from him. They put to a tree and they cut \u2014\nwith a knife they cut pieces from him. Lapides(ph) was his name. And that's what they\nwere doing with the partisans when they catch them. And they said, \"What shall we do\nwith them?\u201d I said, \u201cMaybe you should wait.\u201d I wanted \u2014 and there was already\nheadquarters there. We had in one place headquarters already from Moczar there, and one\nwith Zymierski there and all the big shots were there sitting \u2014 Bolek Alef and Zemsta*\u00ae\ncame also, the guy. And I said, \"Maybe we should.\u201d And they said, \"No, we will not drag\nthem out. We don't know how to get there. It's very hard now to go and communicate.\u201d\n3\u00b0 Major Aleksander \u201c\u201cZemsta\u201d Skotnicki\nBut that time week or two, we got to \u2014 to the headquarters. We came there. First thing I\nreported to him \u2014 to Moczar, that I caught three Germans and I had all the documents\nfrom there. I took away all the documents. I had their names and everything. Then one of\nthe Polish guys was, was something. I don't know what it was mad at me, jealous or what\nit is because he didn't want to give a rifle, something from there that we took away. And\nhe went over to, to Moczar and he told them that we killed innocent people, three guys,\nGermans. And Moczar said to me, \"What do you mean you killed three Germans? You\nhave no right to kill nobody.\u201d And he start screaming at me and all this, and I had already\n\u2014I was a officer already. I took off my \u2014 I was a lieutenant \u2014 he took off. He said, \"you're\ndismissed,\u201d and all this. And in a day after Chiel came back and all this, he start talking\nand he said, \"I have everything what I wanted to know.\u201d He gave me go back. He said to\nme not to do it no more because they have to have some kind of an army. It's not \u2014 you\ncannot do whatever you want.",
        "Q: So in fact the three soldiers were killed.",
        "A: Killed.",
        "Q: Who killed them?",
        "A: Our people. Three people. I know even exactly. I don't want to tell the names. Our\nfriends, they are today \u2014 one of them is in Florida, one is in Israel. Out right, yeah.",
        "Q: During the experiences that you describe \u2014 and we\u2019ll pick that up \u2014 but you raised the\npoint, other people killing Germans, can you recall your own experiences killing\nGermans?",
        "A: We had a lot of fights with Germans. We were shooting to them and they shot at them. I\ndon't know if they were killed. I assumed that they were killed also. When they were\nshooting the rifle the bullet goes to, to them like they go to us. And they were all going\nfrom us open, they were not afraid Jews, they're not afraid. They go. And they were\nshooting back. I'm sure they were killed, but directly to shoot. You had only three guys\nwhen you shot \u2014 went into a train, but we didn't shot. The Pollacks shot them. But it's\ndifferent. It was our group that shot them, and then three were shot directly from us. We\nhad later on more, but this was till then. And we \u2014 I told you straight, us Jews we had\nonce affect, we had a guy what was a Pollack and he was with us, and he denounced us.\nHe was with us, fighting with us, going with us and he had a chance. He just disappeared\nfor a few minutes and he told somebody. He had contact where we were going and what\nwe are doing. And we, we found out very fast that he's doing this. When we find out that,\nthe man cannot live with us. Then who will kill him? Nobody wants to kill him. And they\ncame the Polish guys what I told you, they helped us out they were kids. They were kids,\nthat one Franek, he said, \u201cHere, you shoot the man like this.\u201d And he took out a pistol\nand he shot him. We didn't have the guts to shoot somehow. I was a military man, but\nstill directly to shoot in a fight it's different. Directly to shoot wasn\u2019t to easy. Okay now,\nwe went in a, in a village. The name was Bojki, and in Bojki we were staying two and a\nhalf months, in one spot. And there we formed a real army. We formed groups. You\nknow we made groups, small ones. Every one group had a leader and we made a military\nestablishment. And people were going out, out just to big farms we went out. We\ncollected cows and food, swine, whatever it is, whatever we needed for food, and we\nbrought it over, and we had a base. We was staying there. The Germans knew that we are\nthere. The Pollacks knew we are there. Nobody bothered us. We are staying there. We\nwent out every night, for trains or whatever you had to do. We walked away from there.\nAnd they were not doing nothing. In fact, they had on the woods \u2014 we were \u2014 not too far\nwas woods \u2014 was a sign, \"Here Partisans,\" and they shouldn't go in \u2014 individual Germans,\nor something like that.",
        "Q: You have to explain to us. Why do you think or why is it in fact that the Germans did not\ncome?",
        "A: It was in *44 already. This was \u201844. The Germans had full hands on the fronts all over.\nWe knew what's going on. We had the leaders, from the group. You had \u2014 what's his\nname? Moczar. And what's their name? Bolek Alef and Zemsta came from all over\nRussia was helping \u2014 started to help already. And we were an army already. We knew\nthat we are not \u2014 we will not just give up and they knew that need a lot of military men to\ncope with us. They need airplanes. They need artillery. They cannot just come in just to\nfight with us right then. They knew that.",
        "Q: What size force did you have?",
        "A: We had a few hundred people. And then was a group of Russians there. Chorny\u2019\u2019,\nBiely(ph), a lot of Partisans were there in these woods there. A lot! Thousands already.\nAnd they \u2014 the Russians knew \u2014 the Germans knew that they are there, and they didn't\ncome. For a long, for a long time they didn't touch us. Then the front start coming near,\nand May First, came Rola Zymierski, to us. He was the leader of the whole army. He was\na general before the war, a very fine man, a older man. And he spoke to the whole\npopulation. He called over everybody and he spoke to them and he talked to them about\nthe partisans. It wasn't only Jews then. It was Pollacks, Russians, everybody. And he said,\n\"The Russian front is very near, and these days we will be taken over by the Russians and\nwe will take over Poland back again.\u201d Talked openly. He already was sure of himself.\nAnd then he came over to me and to Chiel Grynszpan, because Chiel and I worked\ntogether then. Jegier, by the way, before when we divided, was killed. In a skirmish with\nGermans, he was killed. And there was no more Jegier and I was with Chiel. I had my\ngroup. He had his group but we kept together. And what I want to say is\u2014\n37 Lieutenant Colonel Ivan \u201c\u201cChorny\u201d Banov",
        "A: The Germans?",
        "Q: The Germans, yeah. They were all, all over already. They were \u2014 the Russians were \u2014 the\ncontact with the Russians was so near. In fact they had a whole delegation came to us in\nthe woods, and they came to me and said, \"Listen, we have confidence in you, your\ngroup. Give me 10 people, whatever, to bring over the government, the future\ngovernment of Poland to Russia. We have them right here. And I want you to give us\nsome people.\u201d And I gave Morel, Bleichman, a nice group of 10 people. I gave them to\nthem and they carried over the main delegation from the Polish government to Russia, to\nMoscow. And they made it. They brought them over to airplane. They had a skirmish\nthere with some Hungarians that were fighting for \u2014 with the Germans. Hungarians were\nfighting with the Germans \u2014 Rumanians were fighting with the Germans, there, on their\nside. And somehow they brought them over. They brought them over. They brought them\nand they went to Russia, and they formed a government. But it was our group that carried\nthem through there. And they remembered this. Moczar \u2014 when I was there latest with\nMoczar he remembered this, the we took over \u2014 the group that took over the government.",
        "Q: The front was quickly moving to your area.",
        "A: The front was moving very rapidly. It was almost we could hear, already, the katyushas*\u00ae\nthis, this, the\u2014",
        "Q: Rockets?",
        "A: Rockets. And we hear artillery. We can hear airplanes too. And almost every few days\nthe Russians came down to us and threw down ammunition, rifles, people. They came in\n\u2014 one group came in 70 people. We called them \u201cskoczki*\u2019.\u201d That means they jump \u2014\njumpers. They came in 70 people. Most of them were Jews, officers, trained in Russia or\nsomewhere, and they came to us. And women came over and now the story about ladies,\nwomen. Hanka was the only one women what I knew that she is around like this. And I\ndidn't know. When I came to Chiel, I find there a whole group of people, old, young,\nchildren. There were a few hundred hidden in a wood, in a very, very strange pieces of\nland there. It was water and you couldn't get there. No German, nobody could get there.\nAnd they pushed them there on this land, and they put them there. And then they were\nbring to them food, something once in awhile. Not too much. They were hungry. And\nwhen I came, she said to me, \"This is people what I know. They are almost from my\nvillages there. I know most of them people.\" Pollacks came over to me and they said they\nwill kill all of them if they wouldn't stop grabbing the chickens and the food in the night.\nAnd they didn't have what to eat, and they ran out in the night. They were going to the\nfarmer. And the farmers were ours, because we were standing \u2014 they knew us. We had a\nbase, and they came to Chiel and they told him \u2014 they said they will kill all the children\n38 Lorry mounted multiple rocket launcher (Russian)\n\u00b0 Jumpers (Polish)\nand women. Then he call over, \u201c\u201cMietek,\u201d he said, \u201cI cannot go to them people because\nwe have to do something. To kill somebody there or to do something.\u201d He said,\n\"Otherwise, they will kill all of us too. Not only them, but they will\u2014 Farmers you\ncannot stop because they are our bread and butter. We have to work with them.\u201d Then I\nwent there with three people. I remember Rabinowitz(ph), from Warsaw, guy on horse,\notherwise, you couldn't walk through there, water was there. You know, the horses went\nthrough everything. And I came to the place.\nI came to the place. I couldn't believe it. When I remind myself, I want to cry now. It was\nmy job. People naked, half naked. Ladies! Men! Children! Everybody, they had some\nkind of covers they had. They made. They built. Not on the ground. On top. And they\nwere cooking, making food, something for the family.. When I saw this group, I couldn't\n\u2014I couldn't believe. I see people. It's like from the old times. You see in the \u2014 from the\nhistory books. You see people like this. And in between I looked down and I see a\nwoman. She looks like my mother. Imagine! And here I came in this in to kill them. I\nhave to kill somebody or I have to do something. I see my mother there. I went over to\nher and I talked to her and I said, \"Where you come from?\" And I talked to others. And\nthen I put them together, and lined up and I said, \"Listen people. You want to live. You\nhave to behave. You have to do something else. You cannot just go to the farmers, rob\nthem. Wait for us. Organize something. There should be some organization because\notherwise, they will \u2014 you will perish and we will perish altogether. And they told me\nthat a few youngsters there what were really no good. They were robbing. I said, \"You\nthree will come with me.\u201d They, they had some mothers there. They had two sisters, and\nthey thought I'm going to kill them. And that was the, the, the order to kill them. And I\nsaid, \"Oh no, I will not kill nobody here. They depend on me absolutely. I'm not killing\nnobody.\u201d After going through a thing like this, and I took them away and I brought them\nover to the group, them three and they were very, very good soldiers there. One is still\ntoday my best friend. Whenever he sees me, he doesn't know what to do with me. All\nthree left with me and they are \u2014 they were with me. But the group \u2014 the women, it was at\na time the Pollacks still didn't give up. They have to be feeded. I said, \u201cThis is no good.\nWe have to take them away.\u201d And we brought the whole group, little by little, not in one\nshot, into the group, into the village there nobody should know. Not even the\nheadquarters didn't know, nobody didn't know. And we brought over \u2014 and every group \u2014\nwe had maybe a 100, 120 people there, and every group we took in one or two women\nand they were cooking for us because we were standing in one place. They were cooking,\nthey were washing. We had shirts to wash or something. Then the women start working\nfor us and they were doing group \u2014 some of them were very brave, and they said, \"What\ndo you mean washing this? We want to have a rifle too.\u201d And have a Dora and another\none there, Roska, and this, and they, they picked up rifles. They put on rifles and they\nwent out to work with us, the women you know, after a time that everything calmed\ndown.",
        "Q: How did they function?",
        "A: They did \u2014 were very, very, very good because they have a group had to \u2014 then they had\n\u2014 they had to behave. You know they were soldiers. Everybody was a soldier. Hanka had\nthe worse time she had than everybody else. She came from Warsaw. She came \u2014 she was\na very, very delicate women \u2014 she was from a good home. She had maids home, and she\ndidn't know what to do with herself. Others were from farms, from villages. They, they,\nthey coped. They knew how to cook. They knew how to do something for us, and some\nof them baked for us. We had a good time. But she, she was lost. Completely lost! She\ncouldn't \u2014 she was \u2014 it was so dirty here. She, she couldn't \u2014 she didn't keep herself good.\nI had a very, very hard time with her really to keep her alive and to keep her around\nthere. Also, she was very small and beautiful. She was a beautiful women, with dark hair.\nShe was very, very nice. I liked her very much, and she liked me. But I couldn't even\ncome near her. She was so \u2014 I knew she was dirty, and after a time she was assigned to\nwatch for a guy what was wounded in a fight. She, she went away from me, and she was\nstaying with this guy until the war ended. I didn't see her no more. But before we divided\ntwo the groups divided to. What happened. When Rola Zymierski came First of May, and\ntold us that near \u2014 the front is near. He said, \"You have to disappear from this terrain,\nfrom this land. We have to go deeper and fight other Germans, deeper, deeper to the\nWeichsel to go deeper into the country, to the west. The Bug was east, and we have to go\nto the west. Then I remember I went, \u201cChiel,\u201d I said, \u201cListen, what shall we do?\" I was\nafraid of these Pollacks there on the other side. They were not too friendly to us, and here\nwe had no freedom. We were staying in one place for so many months. We knew the\npeople already, and they knew us. We lived. Then I said, \"Maybe we shouldn't go.\u201d And\nChiel said the same thing, \"I know the people here, they knew me.\u201d They know Chiel.\nBig shot he came with his horse. They all \u2014 they, they respect. And he liked to drink, he\nliked women. He was a good leader, you know, a real one, a partisan. I was more the\nintelligent type you know. It was \u2014 when they needed something, they came to me, and I\nhave \u2014 I took care of everything. But he was a soldier. And I said, \"We will not go.\u201d And\nI went over to Rola Zymierski and I said, \"You're going away, and this piece of land\nstays empty. Nobody from, from the partisans, nobody will be here. Let us be the guard.\nWhen the Russian front come near, we will go come \u2014 we will go back. But in the\nmeantime, we will need 100 people here just to cover your retreat when you go back to\nthem.\u201d\nHe said, \"It's a idea. Stay.\u201d\u201d And we remained here, and I remained there with 100 people\nwe remained on the site of the Wieprz \u2014 between the Wieprz and the Bug. And they went\n\u2014 the Wieprz, they went through, and they went to the terrain where I was before.\nGarbow, Lubartow, and other towns there. It didn't take too long. The Pollacks, the A.K.,\nthey came over to me, and he said, \"You want to live. You want to live the group \u2014 a\ngroup nice there. You have to belong to us. You have to get with us together and work\ntogether. You cannot be on your own because everybody left \u2014 not you, not the Russians,\nnot the Pollacks, everybody already. Only here you are, you are group. You have to\nbelong to us.\u201d I said, \"Oh, oh, this is, this is death.\u201d Meantime \u2014 the same time\nBaranovskiy *\u00b0 a general from Russia came down with airplanes, and the whole group of\nreal army. I'm telling you soldiers one by one. They were really equipped. Everything\ntoo. And this Baranovskiy we found out through channels he's a Jew too, but he didn't\ngive it up. He didn't. He never said that he's a Jew. And after a few days, we said, \u201cWhat\ndo we have to do the A.K.?\u201d We said, \u201cWe will go over to Baranovskiy and want to meet\nhim. They say he came over on the terrain there.\u201d And we went to help him and how he\ncan help us. We came over to him. He had a wife with him, and he had a pirate, a pirate,\nthat\u2019s a pir\u2014 that is a big bird, and he had caviar and he took us in like a \u2014 and it was\nsomething else. We were dressed military dressed, very nice \u2014 I think was good looking\nthen \u2014 and he start talking to me right way in Russia because I understood Russia, the\nPolish Russia. And he said, \"What you, what you have to go by yourselves?\u201d He\nproposed us until I\u2014 we didn't even say nothing. He said, \"Come to me. Come to us. We\nwill form one group. We have a few hundred people and you be there. I see you are\nsoldiers. You are in that group. You come to us.\u201d And that's what we were waiting for.\nAnd we came, the whole group came to Baranovskiy. And when we came to\nBaranovskiy, he took us in, he divided with us right away. \u201cNo more Jews,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou cannot be Jews. By a group you have to be separate. Every group, Russian, Polish,\nUkrainian, whatever it is. You cannot be Jews by themselves. This is our policy. And this\nis it. You can do that otherwise. Whatever you want, you have to be divided.\u201d In the\nmeantime, he made me \u2014 and he made a group in Russian \u2014 Russian kept separate, and he\nmade from Polish people, A.L. he called them. The are Armia Ludowa. He made a group,\nand I was \u2014 he made me the leader. From Pollacks and from Jews and I was the leader of\nthem. Not Chiel, Chiel stayed.\nThen one night he calls me, Chiel, he calls out, \"Listen you two. I want you to leave. I am\nsending you to Moscow, you two.\u201d I said, \"What do you mean? we'll leave the people,\" I\nsaid. \"Never mind, you two. I have very important papers. I have to send them over.\u201d\n\u201cHow you will do?\u201d \u201cI make a conference from all officers, Russian, Polish, anyone, and\nwhen I will say I have a mission and I need volunteers. Then you two get up fast because\nyou knew already what to do. You get up, you two. When you are up that's it. I have to\nsend you two.\u201d And we came to the meeting and sat and meantime at the meeting, there\ncame a guy from Warsaw ghetto. He run away. He was a politician. He was \u2014 I think he\nwas a communist, something like that. He was the political figure there. He said, \"I'm\ngoing, too, at this meeting.\u201d He goes to the meeting too. And he knows about us that have\nto get up and we're together and we sit three of us together and all of sudden, this General\nBaranovskiy says, \"I have to send out some people with papers and all this. Who\nvolunteers?\" Well, he gets up the first, Rubinstein*! he and Chiel after him, and I\nremained. Only two. And I remained there.",
        "Q: I am going to ask you in the few minutes we have left to focus on the closing days of the\nwar.\n\u201c\u00a9 General Semyon Baranovskiy\n\u201c! Dudkin Rubenstein",
        "A: Yeah. That's what will come.",
        "Q: Where you are now.",
        "A: That's it. Then, then I remained myself here with Chiel away and they had very important\npapers and then they went together to the border to the river that they have to cross.\nThere's a Pollack what knows where to cross, and he is the first one. He walks them into\nthe river. He fells into the river. After him goes Rubinstein. The \u2014 Politruk, they called.\nHe walks in. He fell in the water. And Rubinstein made a \u201cgevalt*\u2019,\u201d starts screaming. He\nfell in the water with the uniform whatever, and he start screaming and the water was\nhigh over him and the Germans were not too far and they start shooting him already. We\nhad to retreat completely. We came back. And this day when he retreated we had a big,\nbig fight. The biggest one in the partisans. We had there one of the partisans. If the\nGermans find out that Baranovskiy is there, the group, he lives openly, you know they\nfind out, they came with artillery. Like I said they didn't come from soldier. They came\nartillery, airplanes and \u2014 what's the name? And the tanks and all this came over.",
        "Q: Just one big battle.",
        "A: Big, big battle. Big battle! And the same day the other group what went the other side to\nmy end was a part of my group too went to show the way there because was \u2014 what was\nthe names? What was his name? Morel, Zelazny, Bleichman \u2014 you will hear a lot because\nhe will I think he will be also there. And they \u2014 he went back with this group, and they\nhad the biggest fight also in the war. Because the Germans want to clean up the partisans.\nThey knew what's going on. The knew that the army's coming back. When the army\ncomes back, they will hinder us whatever. They were afraid. Then they had a order to\nclean us up.",
        "Q: What did they do?",
        "A: And they had a very big fight there. Bigger than ours, maybe, with this and they had a lot\nof people. A lot of people! But in the night, they disappeared.",
        "Q: The Germans disappeared?",
        "A: No, the Germans was staying there, but our people disappeared in the night. Most of\nthem came back to us. They had our base already. They came back to us. And our fight\nwith Wola Wereszczynska we went into the woods. And I don't think somebody was\nkilled. I know one airplane was shot down. I know a few Germans were killed right what\nI saw in the, in the fight because we went into the woods and he was standing there.\nThere was a very big flash was in front of me. I was behind a, a tree, a big one, and there\n\u201c2 Emergency (Yiddish); a cry for help.\nwas some water there in the front of this. All of sudden, a splash there in front of this.\nArtillery hit there, and it didn't, it didn't explode. And then Baranovsk1y was not too far. I\nsaid to him, \"Look here, I almost got killed.\u201d He said, \"Jews don't get killed. You are a\nJew.\" Just like that. He made a joke.",
        "Q: So you went through scot-free?",
        "A: I went through scot-free. After this, it took a few days, a few days after, the Russians start\ncoming. Started coming. It was the worst part in our life cause the Germans were all over\nbecause they came from the front. And there was tanks and the small vehicles and all\nover the field all over. We didn't have where to hide. We didn't have where to hide. It's\nimpossible. Then I don't know, we had no choice. It was some kind of a wooden area,\nsmall woods, small woods and we went into this. Lucky we didn't go into the fields\nbecause they went through the fields. The Germans went through the fields. And we\nwere, were there in this, and we laid down still sitting there. I remember one of the\nwomen got up and she had a red, and red this \u2014 a handkerchief or something like that she\nripped it off her head and I pushed her down. And we were laid down, that the Germans\ncame with airplanes with all this, we were laying there. Somehow, they had their minds\nwith something else, and they went through us.",
        "Q: With one minute left, I want you to tell us how the Russians came in and actually\nliberated your area.",
        "A: The Russians came in, and we were like an organized group, it came in a Pollack with a\nbeard \u2014 he looked like Messiah. He came over to us, he said, \u201cWhat are you doing here in\nthe woods? You know the Russians are here in this village. Right next to you, in this\nvillage the Russians are here.\u201d Said, \u201cWhat?\u201d Said, \u201cCome with me.\u201d And we start\nwalking with \u2014 marching a group, like soldiers, you know. We going \u2014 we\u2019re proud. All\nof a sudden the Russians start shooting. The Russians, on us! Because they knew \u2014 didn\u2019t\nknow who this 1s. They thought it\u2019s Germans. A column of people going?!? And we laid\ndown and we sent out two or three guys with white \u2014 this handkerchiefs and all this. And\nthey went over to them and they told them it is a group of partisans and this, and they\nsaid, \u201cJews on top of this, what?\u201d Here this \u2014 a Russian general came over, a Jew. And\nthen another officer, a Jew. There\u2019s a lot of Jewish officers there, between the Russians.\nAnd they were happy to see us, and they hugged us. And they said, \u201cBut we have no\ntime. We are at war to go. There is a place, there, not too far, what the SS staying and we\nhave a big fight with them. You stay here and then you \u2014 we took over Lublin already.\nWe took over Lubartow and all other towns are taken over already from us. And you go\nback and you are free.\u201d\u2019 And this free was, was very, very sad, very sad. Then we start\nfeeling how alone we are. Everybody start looking for family. Everybody start looking\nfor, for somebody to, to, to share his problems, share this. I couldn\u2019t \u2014 with my family I\nwas cut off, I didn\u2019t know what happen there. Then it takes \u2014 took time a little bit, they\nstart coming from the other side, they told me that my family was killed, all of them in\none day, they took them out, they killed everybody. My brother was killed in a, in a\ncamp. And everybody, what remained there, from, from millions of millions of people,\nremained 150,000 people remained in Poland. Why I know, because after this I organized\nregistration and I was working with Dr. Sommerstein**. Maybe you heard about him? He\nwas a big leader for the war, he our leader from \u2014 in war for the area government and I\nwas working with him, yes. I had a very big job in Poland too, they gave me a job right\naway, and I registering all the Jews, everybody what lived through, came to me and they\nregistered their child and this. And I found what is going on, how many people and where\nthey lived\u2014\n[Conclusion of interview]\n3 Dr. Emil Sommerstein\n"

There was a woman with three men.\nWhere they came? They came from Warsaw, she and another one. Her name was, her\nname was Hanka. Her friend was Halpern, the name Halpern. They both jumped from a\ntrain what went from Warsaw to Treblinka. After the Warsaw, they had the, the fight\nthere. They run. They caught them, and they were bringing them to Treblinka. They\njumped out through the train. And when they came from the train, the farmers told them\nthat we are out. She just jumped out \u2014 this luck \u2014 she jumped on the spot but where we\nwere. But after a few days, it was just some time when we knew we had a big job with a\nlot of people there. Came in some Polish \u2014 a group of Polish people were there, and they\nand us went for a big train, and we stopped the train and we burned down ammunition\nand oil and gas and \u2014 and we took away a few Germans there. And we were not used to\nshoot people there but there was some of them, officers from the Polish group said,\n\"What are you waiting, you Jews? You are afraid to kill?\" They killed right away the\nGermans there. But we little by little we got used to this blood, but still it wasn't my, my\ngenes to kill people. I, I couldn't do it, but I want to talk to you now about helping them.\nWhen I met this Hanka, she was completely out. She was hungry and barefoot. It was\nunbelievable. One thing she has, she has a big hat. She covered her hair that they\nshouldn't see that she is a girl. She was afraid because girls was a problem.

        "A: My town is a small town in Galicia, named Podhajce, not far from Lemberg. I went to\nschool public there. Had my family, five people in the family, with my mother and father\nwas seven. We \u2014 one of my sisters in 1928 married an American \u2014 came from America \u2014\nAmerican, and she come over to America with him and she was here. And I remembered\nher \u2014 his number here, address and being in a \u2014 as a prisoner of war, I wrote to her and\nshe wrote to me and we contacted each other. She was here in America. The rest of the\nfamily disappeared.",
        "A: Podhajce was a small town. It was maybe 4,000 Jews and around, around the town were\nPolish people, Ukrainians. There was a difference from the Pollacks. And I went to\nschool there, to the public school, for seven years we went. And the town was a very,\nvery nice town. It was Podhajce \u2014 that mean, they had a lot of trees and water and people\ncame from all over Poland almost for like a recreation. It was a very nice place. And I\ndon't remember poor people there because usually in the towns, in the shtetel you call,\nthere was a lot of poor people. I don't remember poor people there. Everybody had some\nkind of store or a business, a small one. My father was a builder. He came from another\ntown and he was building in Podhajce, and he met my mother. My mother was a farmer's\ndaughter, they had land, and he married her and I'm \u2014 all my life I was till 26 years, the\nwar start \u2014 I was with my mother's family. I hardly knew my father's family. They were\nin another town, so it wasn't so easy to go from town to town like it is today. But still\nwhen I was 14 years old, I went away to Lemberg \u2014 Lwow, they called it \u2014 to a bigger\ntown, and I went to high school there and I finished school.",
        "A: Oh, I came back. Not directly. I came maybe one or two years later because I had a job in\nLemberg. I got some \u2014 I helped out some with teaching little bit, I did odd jobs. And then\nI came back to Podhajce, to my family. And I had a job, was a bookkeeper, I worked in a\nbig company from a farmer\u2019s equipment and bicycles, this kind of thing. I was a\nbookkeeper, there. I worked \u2014 till the war started, I worked there. I had a girlfriend. I\nwent out with her for years before the war. And in 19\u2014I was a soldier before, too.",
        "A: They took \u2014 they drafted. After 18 years \u2014 19 years, they drafted, and you had to go. And\nI was physically fit and they took me. Usually they didn't took Jews. Very, few Jews they\ntook to the army, but I was fitting and I had school, and they took me to the army. And I\nwas one and a half years in Tarnopol in the army and I finished the army I came home\nagain and I was working back again in the job. And in \u201839 before the war started, maybe\na month, the town was small and we knew each other. A lot of friends. We were always\ntalking politics on the streets and what will be, what will be, about Hitler came in \u201833 and\nwe knew what was going on. The Pollacks were already showing their faces too. They\ndidn't \u2014 so much the Pollacks like the Ukraine, there were very few Pollacks there. But\nthe Ukrainians there, they showed us that we are Jews, and they are \u2014 we had fights with\nthem. Not big ones, not killings, but fists fights and all kind of \u2014 I remember one Purim\nwhere we made some kind of a party and a Pollack came and he wanted to disturb this.\nAnd I had a big fight with him and he almost killed me because he was very big. I didn't\ngive him an inch, I just gave him back. But he never forgot me this guy. He came after a\nfew days after me. He almost killed me. Around the house he was waiting for me. At\nleast, we had our share with this antisemitism. We did not feel so much in with Podhajce,\nlike we felt in Lemberg. We felt it more in the bigger towns. They were they called it\nEndeks!. There was a group of Pollacks, the right wing and they were completely against\nthe Jews and they were even killing before the war break. We had a big\nfight with them on the streets in the gardens and whatever \u2014 it was a street like in\nAkademicka. That remind me today somebody. Jews couldn't walk there. And there was\nthe biggest houses belonged to Jews and there was a guy \u2014 Stricher(ph) was his name \u2014\nhe had this biggest house like on Akademicka street. He couldn't even collect the rent\nthere. He couldn't go over because the antisemitism was so big and they couldn't \u2014 they\nwere almost sitting in the streets daring, waiting for Jews to come and to beat them up.\nThe situation before the war was already ripe for this, but like a like \u2014 the churchman said\n' National Democrats (Polish); abbreviated from \u201cEndecja.\u201d\nin Poland, \u201cBoycotting is all right, the Jews. Beating them up, 1s alright. But not killing.\nKilling is not our aim,\u201d the Catholic church.",
        "A: That's right. Before the war, they called me over on the reserves. Maybe two or three\nweeks before the war started. They called me to Nowy Sacz, a town not far from the\nborders of Germany. It is not far from Przemysl and Tarnow. And they \u2014 I went to the\narmy. They, they put us in uniforms and we started to exercise. And maybe two weeks\nafter, nobody new about this. Nobody \u2014 the people around there was surrounded there.\nZakopane was a place where people came there for a cure. And nobody knew that the war\nstarted and all of a sudden during the night they starting shooting and they left us behind,\nthe Germans, and they moved in. It was a Blitzkrieg. They moved in before we even\nknew what happen. We were in the army. We were sitting in the mountains because there\nwas a lot of mountains, the Carpathian Mountains. And we were sitting there and waiting\nfor the Germans and they were around us already, deep in, in Poland and we didn't know\nthey were around us. But after a time they started with us too because they did it in\npockets like, and they start fighting with us and I was wounded in my right arm. I was\nshot and I fell, and but they didn't see me, and I walked over to a house there to a Polish\nwoman and I begged her to let me in because I was bleeding and she saw me and she was\ncrying. She was afraid, but she took me in and she start helping me and she bandaged my\nwound and I was laying \u2014 when I was laying there for five minutes the Germans came in.\nAnd screaming and looking, and the one with the pistol came over to me and I spoke\nfluently German. I told him, \u201cI'm a soldier and I, I'm wounded.\u201d He said, \"Okay, don't\nworry. We will take you back to the hospital.\u201d And they gave me something to eat even\nthere because they took from the farm woman and gave it to me and they brought me\nback to the hospital.",
        "A: And I became a prisoner of war. But I was in the hospital. I didn't feel it so much because\nI was still a prisoner of war, a Polish prisoner of war. Nobody bothered me specially as a\nJew. Nobody said nothing to me. But the Polish people and the woman that worked there,\nthey knew about it that I am Jewish, but they didn't make a special\u2014",
        "A: Face and the, the manners. They knew a Jew. They recognize. Pollacks recognize a Jew\neven we didn't look like one. They knew. And I was lying there maybe a month in the\nhospital until I could move my right hand. I couldn't move it, but they helped me out a\nlittle bit and I'm, I'm moving it. I still till today is \u2014 I cannot pick my hand that's all. And\nafter a month and a half, they took us, whoever was in the hospital left, and they took us\nto Germany. In a train, they brought me over to Germany. And they brought me into\nStalag 13 \u20141n the film you will see, Stalag 13 \u2014 as a prisoner of war. The second day I\ncame in, they put us 1n a line up, all the Polish prisoners and they asked, \u201cJuden\nraustreten\u2019.\u201d \"Jews report.\u201d I was hesitating for a minute, I admit and two friends of\nmine, Pollacks, they were standing in my side both of them and they pushed me out and\nthey said, \"Here is a Jew.\u201d",
        "A: Two friends of mine. A day before we, we shared bread because on the way we came,\nthey throw bread to us to the, to the train. And I always \u2014 they always give me I should\ndivide it and I was, I was always a leader between them. And all of a sudden, they\ndecided, \u201chere's a Jew.\u201d Then I came out. I had no, no choice, and they put a separate\nbarracks but to the same place they kept us. They took us to all kinds of work, heavy\nwork during this. We were cleaning after even Hitler when he spoke in Nuremberg. That\nwas \u2014 I was around Nur\u2014Langwasser, Stalag 13 was there. Nuremberg, we were\ncleaning after Hitler. He spoke once. And I was a little bit more home in the barracks\nbecause I couldn't work so hard with my hand and they knew about it the Germans. They\nhad their report. And in fact, the Red Cross came to us and my number's 30,189. I still\nremember. And they have the record of me when I was born, where I was born, and\nwhere I fell \u2014 the 8th of October I think, and when I was in prison.",
        "A: That's a very interesting. My family was on the other side of the border. The Russians\ntook over one side of Poland. The Germans took over the other. They had made pact,\nRibbentrop\u00ae and Molotov\u2019, and they divided Poland. My family was in Galicia, and then\nbelonged to Russian and I was on the other side by the Germans and they were by the\nRussians. So 1941 they were under the Russian. It wasn't too good, but still my father\nwas working. He was a builder and he built houses for them, and he built this. And he \u2014\nthey made a living. Nobody killed him there. They knew what is going on the other side,\nbecause I was corresponding with them. As a prisoner of war, I had the right to write \u2014 to\nsend letters and they were receiving the letters and they were answering me. And one was\nan interesting that I sent a letter that went from one camp to the other when they took me.\nI was in a few camps. But they cut my hair. I had very nice bushy hair and I didn't like it\nthat they cut my hair. I looked like a muselman\u2019. I looked very bad. Then I wrote to my\n* Jews step out! (German)\n3 Joachim von Ribbentrop\n* Vyacheslav Molotov\n> Muslim (German); camp term used to refer to prisoners who had lost the will to live and were near death.\nparents that they cut my hair again and my sister answers me, \"Watch that they shouldn't\ncut your head. The hair will grow back.\u201d And that was the truth. I had to watch my head.",
        "A: I kept contact with my family and I kept contact even with my sister in America. I was\nsending her letters, and she even sent me a package \u2014 she was sending me a package. I\nhad this sweater \u2014 I can never forget \u2014 a green sweater. She sent me and I put it on, and\nwhen I run away to the, to the woods, I had this sweater on. And after a time, there were\nSO many insects in this that when I took it over, the sweater walked away by itself. That's\na joke, that's the truth. That's the way it was. I mean I had contact with my sister and I\nhad contact with my family.",
        "A: I was assigned to the kitchen more or less because in the beginning, they did some other\nworks and later on they put me in the kitchen. In the kitchen, I was making coffee and I\nwas making lunch. And I once I made coffee and I didn't know what sugar is. They gave\nme the salt and sugar was for me the same. I never saw it before. And you had to \u2014 sugar\nwas in lumps not loose. And I put in ..instead of sugar, I put in salt in the coffee in the\nmorning, the group went to work, was Pollacks also, they were eating from this kitchen.\nThey wanted to kill me because the coffee was salted and they figured \u2014 they called me in\nthe Germans right away and they said it's sabotage and usually when \u2014 if I would be\nunder the SS, I wouldn't live. They would kill me. But this was Wehrmacht\u00ae there. And\nsome of them are still people today you could talk to. And I understand. told him this\nstory that I didn't know what it is and I put in salt. And he let me go. But he gave me a\nlesson. I think he took me, he put me to work, but he was somehow lenient to me because\nI helped him out after a time in his office too. I write German fluently, and I was helping\nin the office to write it. And from \u2014 this was in Ludwigsburg, I think, yes. I was in\nNuremberg, and then I was in Ludwigsburg and then I was in what the name? Munzinger.\nThey were taking us from one place to the other. And then Munzinger, all of a sudden\nthey decided or it's not \u2014 they, I mean, the headquarters \u2014 decided that all Jews have to be\nsent back to Poland. How\u201d? They said they don't want prisoners now. The Pollacks \u2014 the\nPolish war was finished. Why should they keep prisoners? \u201cYou are Jews, and no, no\nprisoners and we send you home.\u201d And they suppose to change, to change us over with\nthe Russians. That was in \u201841, and after a time they took us \u2014 they put us in trains and\nthey brought us to Gleiwitz and from Gleiwitz, they brought us to Lublin in a camp\nLipowa Seven. There was from horses from a camp before. And this Lipowa, right away\nby the train, when they took us over, they showed us, right away, who they are. They\n\u00b0 General title of German armed forces from 1935 to 1945.\nwere SS. They came with, with the dogs, peitsches\u2019, sticks and all kinds of this, and they\nwere beating us right all the way to the camp. And they told, \"You are no more prisoners\nof war. You are Jews and we will be treated as Jews.\u201d But still they kept us separate.\nThey didn't put us together with the ghetto. There was a ghetto. In Lublin there was a\nghetto already then. And they did not put us in the ghetto.\nBut there was an interesting story. Before I came there was maybe a thousand prisoners.\nThey were all Jews also, what came and they \u2014 the Germans brought them over to the\nJews from the ghetto and they told them, \"You feed them. That's your Jews. You feed\nthem.\u201d And they, they didn't have what to eat themselves in Lublin. The people, the\npopulation was very bad for the ghetto. And they said, \"We don't have food.\u201d They said,\n\"Good.\u201d They took them out and they killed all the prisoners of war, the whole thousand.\nMaybe \u2014 maybe a tenth was left over by the end. They brought them on the way to\nLubartow, a small town, and then to Parczew. Maybe there was left maybe 10, maybe 20.\nI don't \u2014 I cannot tell exactly and there the people \u2014 the population, the Jewish population\nput them in right away and gave them food and they kept. I came after this and they felt\nthat the Jews \u2014 they felt they had to do something. They made a kitchen for us in the\ncamp. They brought over and they was cooking for us meals, and they kept us there. The\nleadership there was from the SS. There was Riedel\u00ae was the leader, and there was Dolp\u2019\nwas a small officer. He was the terror of all Lublin and the terror from all over in Poland.\nDolp was known all over. Dolp came in on a horse to the camp and if he saw somebody\nlaying in the bed sick or somebody didn't get up so fast in the morning, he shot him right\non the spot. And we had a lot of problems there in the camp. I was still on the, on the care\nof this hospital whatever because I was shot and I had always showed this paper I had\nfrom the Germans that I cannot work so hard. Others were working out and in the\nbeginning also I went out to work and we built the known Majdanek camp, Majdanek\nconcentration camp. They built from the prisoners of war. We built it. And after this was\nready, we were still there. They brought in the first prisoners of war from Russia. The\nwar with Russia started in 1941. I think in July, June. I don't remember exactly the date.\nAnd when the war started the first prisoners of war in Majdanek were Russians and they\nsaid \u2014 the Germans said that they are not Russians \u2014 just prisoners, but they are\ncommissars. They are officers something like communists real, and they have to die. And\nthey were dying like flies. I don't know if they gave them poison or whatever they gave\nthem, they were dying. They had typhus there and they were dying. And we got \u2014 we\ncaught from them typhus from the Russians. Me too. I got sick. I got the typhus. And\nthey brought \u2014 they didn't want to give us any care because they were afraid that we will\n\u2014 they will get sick to the Germans, and they took us out and they put us in a synagogue.\nIn the synagogue they put on the floor nothing to cover. Nothing. We just stayed there.\nWe were about 400 sick people and I think 300 died. And the strongest one, somehow \u2014 I\ncannot believe it, but the stronger ones died. And I had some help from the town\n7 Whips (German)\n* Unterscharf Horst Riedel\n? Sturmbannfihrer Hermann Dolp\nsomehow. A doctor came in once, and he knew me from before. And he gave me a needle\nand he ran out fast because he was afraid that everybody want and he didn't have the help\nfor everybody. And he gave me a needle and somehow it helped me, and I lived too.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: The synagogue was a very, very big building. It was the biggest synagogue in Lublin.\nLublin was a very known town from Jews. The Jews lived there for hundreds of years,\nhistorical. The biggest Rabbi for the yeshiva there was in Lublin, and they had the\nbiggest synagogue was there in Lublin, too. And they took out everything. It was bare\nwalls there, and we were, were laying there 400 people on the floor. Plain on the floor.\nNobody was taking care of us. Nobody talked to us. Nothing! But the people of Lublin\nonce in awhile were daring. They came in and they brought us food a little bit. They\nhelped us out a little bit in that synagogue.",
        "A: In the ghetto.",
        "A: No. No. The synagogue was in the ghetto. This was in the ghetto.",
        "A: They didn't have to go out. They came there. They came women and the ladies. I had a\ngirlfriend there what I knew and she came to help me out and had friends they came in to\nme to see me there.",
        "A: I was in the ghetto. Lots of times. Because I was working so hard in the outside, then I\nwas inside working for self help. People when they went out they were getting some\nfoods, some bread. They brought it into the camp and they were bringing it over to me\nand I concentrated and I was going over there. There was a hospital. I would bring over\nfood for them. I was given out for people what ever was poor. They couldn't work. I was\ngiving out bread. It was self help. I was working with another one. Goldberg(ph) was his\nname. We both worked in this in the camp.",
        "A: I don't know. I was maybe brought up like this from home. I was always in the\norganizations. I was belonged to Shomer ha-Za\u2019ir!? when I was a youngster for the \u2014 for\nthe organization for Israel. In fact, before the war I went also to a Hachshara!'. I was\npreparing to go to Israel and I was maybe a year and a half in that Hachshara working.\nAnd I was always on the side of the poor. I don't know \u2014 .somehow I \u2014 that was my\nnature. And I liked to do it, and I \u2014 I was helping people.",
        "A: I've always \u2014 somehow they \u2014 they gave me the leadership. Always as I remember there\nwas a moment in the camp. There was a lot of doctors, intelligentsia was there. He came\ninto the camp already when it was Jew. And one of the doctor, the Germans wanted him\nto be the leader of the camps, he came over to me and he said, \"Gruber, you are the man\nfor us. We want \u2014 I want you to do it.\u201d I said, \"No. Not for the Germans I wouldn't do it.\u201d\nAnd I didn't want to take it. Another guy took it. But still they felt something from him\nthat I was doing the right thing and they always gave me the leadership.",
        "A: I was brought up like that because when I was in the organizations I was always there. I\nwas talking to people. I had speeches. But my main subject was antisemitism. I remember\ntoday that I was always digging in into this, why there is antisemitism all around. Why\nthe church? Why this? Why they're doing this? And I was always working on this. And\npeople were asking me always the questions about this. Why there is antisemitism? And I\ntold once a story and I don't know why it came to me the story. I was reading it or\nsomething that men \u2014 a priest asked a man to come into his church. He didn't see him a\nlong time in the church. He said, \"Why should I go to the church. You always talk\nnonsense?\" He said, \"No, no. Come over. I will have a very nice sermon. Come over.\u201d\nThe man came out. The churchman talks as a sermon about Jews. He said that the Jews\nkilled Christ. The Jews need blood for matzos and all the bad things in the world comes\nfrom the Jews. He heard a sermon against the Jews. The Pollack walked out and he\ngrabbed a Jew on the street. They start beating him up. Then the church man came out,\nthe priest came out and said, \"Why do you beat this Jew?\" He said, \"What do you mean\nwhy I am beating?\" You just told me what the Jews did. They killed Christ and, and all\nkinds of things.\u201d He said, \"Wait a second. That was 2000 years ago. That was a long time\nago.\u201d He said, \"No, \" to the priest. \"You told it to me today and while you talking about\nthis, we are listening.\u201d And that's what it was. They were listening to the priest. The\npriest were always talking about this, that Jews are a menace. \u201cThe Jews killed Christ.\u201d\nBut they never told them that Christ was a Jew himself. In Poland if you would tell a\n'0'Youth guard (Hebrew); Zionist youth organization.\n'l Training (Hebrew); Zionist program to prepare youth for emigration to Israel.\nPollack that Jesus was a Jew, he would kill you it. Because how can it be? He was God.\nAnd that came from the churches. It came this hate for the Jews. Next the economic\nsituation in Poland was so that Jews were working for the big farmers. Jews were\nworking for the kings. Jews were working, collecting taxes. That was their function. And\nby doing this they came in contact with the nation, with the people.",
        "A: Experience. Built up in me.",

        "A: Yes. And the others like I told you, 300 of them died. The rest of them was brought back\nto the camp, to the camp to.... When I came back also, and I was a little \u2014 felt a little\nbetter, I still sit down and didn't work. And I had a friend of mine, his name was Henryk\nSzengut. He was a very good friend of me, and he was always with me and he was\nwatching me all the time. And after a time was the leader of the camp was a Jewish\nfellow was named Fiszer'*. We had the whole camp. There was 12 camps \u2014 like 12\ncamps \u2014 like 12, and I was in the sixth.",
        "A: Twelve camps and there was barracks.\n'2 Roman Fiszer",
        "A: Yes, that's what I want to tell. Barracks were there. And in every barrack were maybe\n100 \u2014 120 Jews there, and every barrack had his own leader there was watching, and he\nwas reporting to the main leader, to the Jewish official. Official is the leader for the\ncamp. And there was two Jews there, Germans, Kapos!\u2019. They were working for the\nGermans and one was Simon and the other one is \u2014 I don't remember his name. And they\nwere German Jews, and they were doing whatever the Germans told them. And the\nGermans \u2014 they came to us.",
        "A: Polish Jews.",
        "A: Essentially former the prisoners, essentially from the side of the Russian side because the\nones what were on the side where the Germans took over, they let them go home. They\nlet them go home and they wind up in ghettos and camps and all this. But the group that\nremained there in this was from the Russian side because they don\u2019t \u2014 they didn't have\nwhere to go. We supposed to be changed for prisoner of wars from Russia to Germany,\nbut the war broke out and it stopped it. They were changing some in the beginning, but\nthen it stopped and we were stuck in Lublin in Lipowa Seven. Now, I saw what's going\non there and \u2014",
        "A: I mean they were killing people for the \u2014 for the smallest thing. They were \u2014 a lot of\nthose people went out to work. When they came back, they brought a piece of bread or\nthey brought some shoes sometimes. Some a piece of clothing or something from the\nPollacks. They were \u2014 they were dealing in \u2014 with them. They give money what they had\n\u2014 dealing with them. And when they caught them \u2014 the Germans, they were watching by\nthe entrance \u2014they caught them, they were hanging, killing. Just for a piece of bread.",
        "A: The prisoners \u2014 us. The prisoners. When they came from work and they had a piece of\nbread and they found it and they killed you for this. They just \u2014 they had a hanging place\nand they were hanging. Especially they were killing if somebody run away.\n'3 Forman (colloquial German); term used for inmates appointed by the SS to head a labor Kommando of prisoners.",
        "A: If somebody run away, they caught him. Usually they caught. They caught two of them\nand they took out the whole camp there one night and they were hanging him publicly\nlike everybody should see. They woke us up in the middle of the night and everybody\ncame out naked almost and it wasn't even \u2014 they told them to take off. Everybody was\nhalf naked outside and was February, I think \u2014 the beginning of March cold. Terribly.\nAnd a lot of us got pneumonia. We caught cold. And on top of this when they told us to\ngo back to the barrack, they was standing in the door and whoever walked in they beat\nthem how much they could. Every one of us, we all got beating. I was just behind a man\nwho start crying, \"Don't hit me. I have \u2014 I have home children, a wife. Don't hit me.\u201d The\nGermans said, \"Yes, I have a child \u2014 wife and children too, and I have to stay here with\nyou and watch you, you stinking Jew.\u201d And he hit him more even. When he hit him the\nmore, I jumped over and he didn't touch me. He came in and I went in first. But my luck\nwas that they send me over to work in a special hospital. In a hospital, they had there a\nbarrack from the prisoners of war, about 20 of us or 24 \u2014 I don't remember. And we were\nworking for the Germans, not SS, for the Wehrmacht. And usually every night we went\nto the \u2014 back to the barracks normal but then they built for us barracks and we was\nsleeping there and getting food there and we were working there. And I worked in a\nmagazine.",
        "A: My luck was I meant the Fisher remember me. He knew that I am \u2014 that I cannot work\nhard. And he sent me out there, there I was sitting like a office, and I was writing down \u2014\nif somebody came from the front, Germans came from the front and they needed or they\nhave to give back uniforms, rifles, pistols, everything \u2014 I was registering this.\nEverything! And I had maybe 10 of my prisoners of war prisoners. They took it away\nfrom me and they were sorting it and keeping it. When the people went back to the front,\nthey gave it back. But most of them didn't. And while they had their pistols and rifles, I\nstart stealing rifles and pistols there from them.",
        "A: I was more or less left alone in the office. I don't know if he had some kind of\nconfidences. German was the head of this. He was like a Volksdeutsche'*. He spoke\nPolish and he spoke German, and I think he was doing \u2014 and now as I think, I'm sure he\nwas dealing with my people, not with me. Me, he told I should write down that I gave out\nto the Germans more than they took. Let's say I gave them a pair of shoes. I put I gave the\nman shoes and pants and a jacket and all this. And he took away the difference what I\nwrote down. I gave out shoes. I put down the shoes, and the difference he took away the\njacket and the pants and he was dealing with \u2014 with my people and they were selling\nthem to the population somehow. Because being in the hospital the Pollacks had entrance\n'4 Ethnic German (German)\nto us more. We were not in a ghetto no more. We had open doors there. We could go in\nand out. Then they were dealing.",
        "A: Of the hospital. Yes. We were watched more or less, but it's \u2014 1t was easier. In fact, every\nday I went back to the camp to collect food for the group because I was like the leader of\nthe group there. I remained like a leader. I was, I was going for food. I went to the camp\nwith a German with a wagon. He brought me over there. We collected food for the\npeople. We didn't need it. In fact, once I gave it away. To the camp I left it. And one of\nthe Germans saw it, and he called me over to the head of the camp there, was Mohwinkel\nHe said, \"What do you mean? You stealing bread from your comrades and you give it\naway to the others.\u201d And he beat me up over the head with peitsche. This guy Fisher saw\n\u2014 came just then, and he saw that he is beating me, and he said, \"Leave him alone. I will\ntake care of it. I will give him a beating. You leave him alone.\u201d And Fisher just kicked\nme and threw me away you know and he said, \u201cJust go back to the camp.\u201d He did that\nspecial, you know, to this. And in the camp I had contact with Pollacks. I worked with\nPolish prisoners of war. I worked with the Germans there. I worked with women there. It\nwas a big hospital there.",
        "A: Let say, I worked there and they \u2014 they worked \u2014 they \u2014 they and let's say something was\nripped or something, they were sewing or they were in the kitchen working. They was an\nadministration there from Polish people and the Germans. The Germans were on top and\nthe Pollacks were working there. And I was talking to them. We were more free there.\nInside we were talking. And then came over to me a man. His name was Paul. Paul. I\ndon't remember the second name, and he said to me, \"What are you doing here?,\" he said,\n\u201cWhy don't you run away?\"",
        "A: That's it. I didn't \u2014 I was afraid of the Pollacks altogether, you know, and especially a\nman comes over to me and tells me a story I should run away and he knew when I will\nrun away that they will kill 20 people. The whole group will be killed because for that |\nman \u2014 they told the Germans that. \u201cIf one man runs away, we kill 20, we kill 50 whatever\nwe feel like we will kill because one man runs away.\u201d And I told them the story. Said,\n\"Listen, they will kill a lot of people if I run away.\u201d He said, \"Try to get out how many\nyou can because everyone of you will be killed. In the camp, in the ghettos they will kill\neverybody.\u201d I said, \"How do you know it?\" He said, \"I am a partisan. I'm a fighter.\u201d \"I\nsit here,\" he said, \"to work, but I have connection with the woods. I know a lot of people\nalready out in the woods and they're fighting the Germans and I know some Jews and\neven from your camps, they run away. And I knew that's two or three run away, and they\nare in the woods. They have horses already there. They have rifles.\u201d He said, \"There is a\narmy,\" he said. I couldn't believe it in the beginning and I decided to stay, but still it was\nvery important. And like I told you before, I was a believer. I believed that Hitler will kill\neverybody. I believed. I was reading before the war even what he was doing to people,\nand I believed that he will kill. And I went out. When I came every Saturday or Sunday \u2014\nI can't remember when I went for the food \u2014 I connect myself with the people, the people\nwhom I knew and I was talking to them, \"People, Let's run away. They will kill us, all of\nus.\u201d A lot of them were listening to me. And a lot of them said, \"Forget it. Who? The\nGermans? People like the Germans. They are cultural people. The biggest culture in the\nworld. They will kill people \u2014 prisoners of war, especially. Forget it? Anyway, where will\nyou go? In the woods there. The Pollacks are not so keen to see us, and here 1s at least\nthey give us some food. They gave us some cover to sleep in the night. We will live\nthrough the war like this.\u201d And I was very sorry for one man specially. He was a very\ngood friend. He was a lawyer and I was begging him, plain begging him, \"Come with me.\nRun away.\u201d He said, \u201cNo, no, no. I can't.\u201d But I persuaded 22 people and told them that I\nam running away, and I came over to this Pollack and \u2014 after a few months. It wasn't\nright away. I was finding out if he tells the truth and how he behaves and all this. I was\nwatching very carefully. And we made a meeting in town. I had a meeting with him and\ntwo real partisans. People from the woods came over and in a restaurant, a Jewish\nrestaurant \u2014 it was still a Jewish restaurant in the ghetto, and he gave me a compass. He\ngave me a map, and he gave me directions and where to run and how to run and where to\nmeet. And we run away on October the 28th, 1942. We decided to run away. We talked\nto these 22 people. Everyone of them knew their locations, where he was to go. In\nseparate places there everybody had to go. The going was still good. That means we\ncould get out somehow. We could persuade the Germans we have to go out because later\non I know after this nobody could get out. But it was still a possibility to get out of at\nleast to town you know, to\u2014",
        "A: That's what I mean. I still \u2014 I went out. I said, \u201cI'm going to camp for food.\u201d I told the\nGerman I am going to the camp. And I was the leader and I had the right to go. I had a\nwhite band, band there, I was Kolonnefiihrer\u2019> and I had the right to go out. And instead\nto go over there to the camp I \u2014 I started to go in the direction where he told me to the\nwoods.",
        "A: Walking through Lublin to the town and on the outskirts of Lublin, and one thing I didn't\nmention in my book that I \u2014 when I walked came in two gendarmes, two police on\nhorses, and I saluted them and they didn't say nothing to me and I was shaking like a leaf.\nI was sure this is it. And somehow they let \u2014 they let me through and I \u2014 I went through\n'S Column leader (German)\ntown and walked straight by myself to the woods where I knew my two people were\nwaiting for me.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right. We had there a man, today he is in Israel, his name is Weingarten!\u00ae. He had some\nkind of connection outside with Jewish people, with Pollacks. He was selling. I don't\nknow really. I was always giving him the rifles. I myself kept one pistol and ammunition.\nI kept myself.",
        "A: I kept it behind my bed. I kept it \u2014 I didn't keep it a long time, but almost by the end.\nAbout three, four days before, and \u2014",
        "A: They wind up in the hands of the Polish partisans. They came there. But I \u2014 I don't know.\nHe told me he made some money on this too I think through this Weingarten. He gave\naway a few pistols and rifles. But I myself before I went away \u2014 came to me \u2014 I had one\nman, Jegier\u2019\u2019. He was later the leader and he said to me, \"We wanted to buy by the\nPollacks some rifles and ammunition to buy and we had money for this.\u201d And the last\nminute they refused and we don't have. Not one rifle, not one pistol, nothing. And they\ntook our money too. And he said, this Jegier said, \"What shall we do now? I don't think I\nwill run away now. Without nothing, what will we do now in the woods without.\u201d I said,\n\"Jegier, you do whatever what you want. I am going. I decided and you please tell your\npeople they should go because I am going.\u201d And somehow Jegier and 22 of them, they all\ncame on time. Six o'clock, like a clock or was it seven o'clock because it was darkness\nalready on October the 28th, and we met all of us we met by the two Pollacks and there\nstart a new other odyssey, started new chapter in my life.",
        "A: Right.\n'6 David Weingarten\n'7 Shmuel Jegier",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Who could think about a future there? You lived day by day. We saw what is going on,\nand every one of us was feeling that after tomorrow he will not be there. Nobody could\nthink. But I remember one thing what I did. It was not legal. I sent a letter through a girl\nthere. All the mail what we sent home or wherever went through a censor and my letter I\ngave to a Polish girl and she took it with her, and somehow, they caught the Polish girl\nwith my letter. In this letter \u2014 I remember like today \u2014 I said, \"I'm running away,\u201d and I\ntold my family, \"Run away. Nobody will live. Run, because the Germans will kill\neverybody.\u201d And the Germans caught this letter and I'm lucky, lucky it was a\nWehrmacht, not SS, and this guy beat me up and beat up this girl and didn't gave the\nletter to the SS. Otherwise I wouldn't live till then to run away. This was \u2014 that \u2014 and\nthat's the circumstances we were living. Day by day we didn't know if today is one killed\nor another. But it was an interesting story there. When we were building the Majdanek,\nthat this Dolp. I said, in the beginning, the officer, he was supervising the work there, and\none of our Jewish boys \u2014 .he was from Tarnopol, I don't remember his name, and he\ndidn't like his work. The \u2014 Dolp didn't like how he worked and they started beating him\nup. This Jewish boy threw himself on this Dolp and start fighting with him, fist fighting.\nHe fought with him, but he had a pistol or something and he hit him, the Jewish boy. And\nhe started bleeding and they took him, and interesting, they didn't kill him. They took him\naway to a hospital, and they kept him there. The Germans kept him there for a long time\nuntil he healed. When he was healed, they took him out and Dolp said, \"He's mine.\u201d He\ntold him, \"Run away now in the field.\u201d He told him, \"Run.\u201d He ran and, and he killed\nhim. That was this, but he was a hero this guy. He fought with him. In the beginning, he\nwas really fighting. I don't remember his name. I'm sorry I don't.",
        "A: It was impossible. Not prisoners \u2014 nobody, nobody dared to, to fight with the German\nbecause they were killing. Right away, before you even start \u2014 before \u2014 but somehow he\nwas fighting him. He didn't kill him right away. But then he hit him. He didn't shoot him.\nHe hit him hard. That was interesting. But then he shot him when he told him to run\naway.",
        "A: Partisan activities I told you this man \u2014 this Pole told me what is going on. They're\nrunning away. Pollacks and Jews are running away and they form an army. I didn't know.\nIn, in my mind, it was a army again because I was in the army before I was in Hachshara.\nI was always like in a scout and this was in my mind, it will be like the army. It is not a\npartisans, I have no idea what it is. And when we came these two guys start leading us,\nstarting showing us what to do, how to do. And the first thing we went through a water.\nWe had to , a Small river and we had to take off the shoes and they showed us\nhow to cross and by one by one we crossed the water and we came on the other side. And\nthen they brought us over to a place in the woods, deep in the woods and he said \u2014 there\nwas not far a river \u2014 and he said, \"Here we will make a camp. In the night \u2014 we will go\nevery night,\u201d we were 22 people, \u201cOn \u2014 11 under your leadership and the other 11 going\nwith...,\u201d Kaganowicz was the other guy \u2014 he was a leader too. \u201cWe will go \u2014 11 people\nwe will go into the farmers in the night.\u201d I had the map, I had the compass and every\nnight we went to another village there around the woods. Not far. And we walked in, and\nthe Pollack went with us, one of them and one went with the other. And they knocked on\nthe window in the night and they said, \"We are fighters for Poland,\" into the windows\nbecause people were scared. They woke up in the middle of the night and there's people\nwith \u2014 with rifles or whatever. Nobody had a rifle. Nobody nothing. You know what we\ndid. We took some wood and we put it on, on a string and I had a pistol. And I speak very\ngood Polish and I was always the speaker for them and I came over and I said \u2014 because\nmost of our Jews, they didn't speak a good Polish. They spoke Yiddish most of them and\nhalf Russian because their guys were the other side, but I spoke Polish, I went to school.\nAnd I came over and I said, \"I'm fighting for Poland for, for your freedom. We don't want\nnothing from you. Just give us some food and we will go away. Some milk, bread.\u201d We\nwere always taking some bread for the people for another 11 people back. And that was\nhappening every night we were going to another village and until we exhausted already\naround this, we said, \"Let's go somewhere else.\u201d And we start moving. And then Pollacks\nthen too said, \"Listen, you cannot walk around like this, rifles without on you. They will\nkill us. Any day the \u2014 the farmers will tell the Nazis or somebody and they will kill us\nall.\u201d \"Give us \u2014 you have some money. You have some money or something? Give it to\nme and we will go out back to Lublin and we will buy some rifles or get some pistols or\nwhatever.\u201d And they walked \u2014 they took everything what we had and they walked away\nfrom us. And I don't see them till today. I don't know what really happened. If they were\ncaught or something like that, but we never heard from them. And then we were on our\nown. And then we start moving.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: So far, alright?",
        "A: What does he say? Interesting or not?\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #2",
        "A: It was a very, very hard situation, we \u2014 also we were already on the last few days in the\nwoods. But still we relied more or less on the Polish two guys, when they came over to\nthe farmers, they helped with this. Because the farmers, we knew, didn\u2019t like Jews\nspecifically. That\u2019s why I changed my name to Mietek, this is a real Polish \u2014 Mieczyslaw\nand short is Mietek. And almost every one of our group took a Polish name, that they\nshouldn\u2019t \u2014 also we talked Yiddish between ourself and we, we were a Jewish group,\nalmost everybody knew, but we didn\u2019t want to be so obvious in dealings with the farmers\nto say that Jews. And they always had that imagination that a Jews is not a soldier, a Jew\ndoesn\u2019t know what a rifle is, a Jew doesn\u2019t \u2014 he\u2019s different than all of them. The\ndifference what meant a lot, that they, they \u2014 some of them they didn\u2019t see a Jew, but they\ntold them the story about this. Then, this reminds me when I was in Germany. One day\nthey took me to a farmer to work in the farm and when they came time to lunch they took\nme home and I was sitting by the table and there was a young girl, a German girl. And I\nwas talking fluently German, I spoke to her, and she spoke to me, and I saw she likes me,\nshe\u2019s talks to me. Then she starts talking about Jews, \u201cBecause of the Jews the war broke\nout. Because of the Jews the \u2014 this, this, this.\u201d I asked her a plain question, \u201cDid you ever\nsaw a Jew?\u201d She said, \u201cNo, I never saw.\u201d I said, \u201cHow you know what it 1s?\u201d She said\n\u201cHitler said that they are killer, that they are this, this, this. And they have horns,\u201d she\nsaid, \u201cthey have horns. Jews have horns.\u201d I said, \u201cListen darling, I am a Jews and I have\nno horns.\u201d She almost died. I couldn't believe it, what kind of faces she made then and\nshe \u2014 she ran out from the house and she was so excited and so this \u2014 and she came back\nand said, \"You are lying to me. That's impossible,\" she said. \u201cYou couldn't be it.\u201d I was a\ngood looking young fellow in a uniform and she couldn't believe it. And that was the, the\nimage of the Jews. It was only \u2014 they didn't know even, who a Jew is. But the image of a\nJew was, for them, something that \u2014 terrific, was with horns or some devil or something a\nJew is not a normal person. That is what they \u2014",
        "A: That's why I came to the farmers when we came. The Pollacks helped us out and they,\nthey were the front, and now we had to be the front and I was the front always because I\nspoke very good Polish and I always came in and like I told before, I was introducing\nmyself and I told them why I was here. Then, when we exhausted the neighborhood, we\nstarted moving away from there. But before we moved, we had a problem. We had a boy\nwith us from Majdanek, and this boy run away from Majdanek in a special way. He\njumped in \u2014 they took out the, the \u2014 I don't know how to tell it in English, from the, from\nthe horses, the, the\u2014",
        "A: Manure. And he jumped in into this. And the farmer didn't see him and he was almost\nchoked to death there but he \u2014 he came out from there with a horse manure from\nMajdanek. It was almost impossible to get out from that. He came out from there. And\nsomehow the Pollacks from the Underground, they brought him over to me. And he got\ntyphus. He became sick in the woods. We put him in, in our \u2014 1n a hole somewhere. They\ncovered him up because it was cold already in October. And we kept him like this and\nfrom himself, he got better and we were waiting for him to get better. In meantime, we\nwere 22 people, and three of our people said, \"That's enough.\u201d They don't want to go run\nlike this. \u201cIt is no use. They will kill all of us, and it's very hard life. I'd rather go in a\ncamp where I have a soup and they gave me some work to do. The Germans will not\nkill.\u201d And three of our people went back to the camp.",
        "A: It was a terrible shock to me. I couldn't believe it because we went through so much by\nrunning away, and they jeopardized other people and all this, and they, they knew about\nthis, but you can't judge people. You don't know. Everybody has his own mind, and it\nwas very hard. The beginning was so hard it's unbelievable. I was really scared. I didn't\nknow where I am. When I came in, I saw the woods. It, it was a special wind blowing\nfrom the woods with a noise, the Pollack said, \"Here, this will be your home now.\u201d To\nwalk in into this, and it was dark when we walked in into the woods and in the woods, it\nwas \u2014 the animals were making a lot of noise and it \u2014 and I came from a, from a town,\nnothing \u2014 a village and it was scary. And one of them trees was something broken. It\nmade so much noise that we didn't know that it was a wounded animal or something like\nthat or a human being or something and one of our people jumped up to the tree and he\ncut it off and he showed that was only a tree making the noise. But we were really scared.\nWe didn't know what, what to expect there. You don't know where you are. In fact, we\nreally didn't know where we were because not far from us maybe a mile or two, were\nGermans living. There they had a garrison. They lived there, and they were watching\ntheir mill. There was there a big one. But we didn't know. We didn't know for nothing.\nWe were just came in there and, and we were doing our job, going every night and back\nand forth. And it's good that we decided to go away because the farmers start talking and\nthe Germans would find out fast, and they would kill us.\nThen we went away and after a night, or two nights\u2014 I don't remember exactly how it was\n\u2014 by walking from one place to the other, only by map. Only by a compass and a map.\nWe didn't ask nobody. In the night all of a sudden we hear noises in the woods and we\nstopped, and start looking, what kind of noises, voices. We heard something like Yiddish,\nspoken and I said, \"This is something.\u201d And we over near one or two of us, the rest was\nstanding on the side, and we start screaming, \"amkha'*.\" Means \u201cyour people.\u201d And right\naway from the other side answered voice, \"amkha.\u201d And to our amazing we found a\nwhole group of people who had run away from a village. This was maybe \u2014 they called a\ntown Markuszow, what they called it, a village Markuszow. The whole town of there was\nmaybe 100 people or whatever run away from this camp. And they all came to the woods.\nAnd there were ladies and men and children, a camp. And between them were two\nRussian prisoners of war who had run away also from a camp, from a prisoners of war\ncamp. They run away from a Russian camp. They run away. One was Kolka \u2014 one was\nMikoi\u2014 Tolka, Tolka, and Mikoi, was the two men there. One was a officer and the\nother was a sergeant or something from the Russian army. And when they saw us\u2014 we\ncame in uniforms, we were all in uniforms from the prisoner of war \u2014 oh, he got so\nexcited and he \u2014 they took us over and he start talking and we looked around and we saw\nthey were building bunkers. You know what a bunker is? They were building in the land\n\u2014 they were building some hiding places there, and they put up trees or grass. They\ncovered everything and they were living down in this hiding place.",
        "A: They are bunker, bunker was interesting this. I, I can't shake it from me because I hated\nthe bunkers, as to me it looked like a grave. You go in a graveyard right there, cause they\nhad a door in the front where you walked in from the side, and the top it was like grass.\nYou didn't see nothing on top. It was woods there around and trees and everything and\ndug. They dig into the, into the earth.",
        "A: Far. There was for a 20 people here. And one, one bunker was for 40 people. Far, big\nand it was two entrances. One for them to walk in and one to walk out. Far away to walk\nout. Took a long, long time and when they built, they built 1t open you know. Then they\ntake woods. They put on top and they covered it. And when it was raining, rain came in \u2014\nstill not all the way, but 1t came in still someway. When I saw this, I said, \"No, not for\nme. I didn't come in here to, to, to lay in \u2014 then the Germans will come in, and it's very\neasy to get all of us.\u201d And I said, \"No. I will not stay here.\u201d And I told this Tolka and\nsaid, \"It's not for me.\u201d He said, \"If you want to stay.\u201d He said, \"I have children and I have\nwomen. I have people. Where will \u2014 what will I do with them?\" They have to be placed\nsomewhere and hidden. They said, \"Okay, we will be around you and we will work with\nyou.\u201d But then he says, \"Please, give me somebody what is a soldier and discipline he\nknows because all of them come from towns and they're children and they don't know\nwhat army is, what soldiers is, what it is. Give me a few people of yours.\u201d And they will\n'8 Your people (Hebrew)\nteach, start learning them the skill of the army. And I said, \"Okay.\u201d And I left Jegier,\nCygan, I remember the name, and the woman Gottlieb(ph) her name, three or four I left\nwith Tolka. And they were, they were starting working with him. I went away. But we\nkept contact all the time. We \u2014 through other farmers \u2014 how it happened, Tolka had\nalready connections.\nHe came to a town, Garbow and in this town was a man. His name was Kaminski, Genek\nKaminski. This was a known and this Genek was something what we have to thank a lot.\nHe was \u2014 I think he was a communist before he war or at least a socialist, I don't know\nwhat \u2014 and he belonged to a group of people and he had some people there working\nagainst the Germans. And this Tolka brought me over to him. He introduced me to him.\nAnd we start working from this, this was our like headquarters. This Tolka had\nconnections with the real partisans \u2014 not partisans special, but with the heads of the\npartisans. He had connections with the A.L.'\u2019. This was army in Armia Ludowa. There\nwas a Gomulka\u201d\u2019 and there was a Moczar\u2019', and there was Zymierski\u201d\u201d and there were all\nthe heads of Poland which were later on the Polish government, and he had some\nconnections with these people. And little by little he almost gave his orders, instead of\nthem, too. But we lost \u2014 we became appointed with Genek. In the nights we came to him,\nand he was taking care of us now. He was sending us out for special work. He told us\nwhich farmers have rifles or ammunition or something and he said, \"Go to this farmer\nand tell him he should give you a rifle. If he doesn't, you do whatever you feel like\nbecause he has it.\u201d\u201d And we did. And with the help \u2014",
        "A: We came, we came \u2014 first of all, we needed always help now from this Markuszow\npeople. We were in touch with them. They had Jegier with them and he was teaching.\nAnd we were taking out some of them people like Sever Rubinstein and others, and they\nwere going with us also. First of all, they knew the terrain. They know where to go. And\nwe were strangers. We were not from this neighborhood, and this was very, very\nimportant. They knew every piece, every house, every farmer, every \u2014 they, they knew\neverything around there, and it was very, very helpful for us. Especially was one of them\nguys a young fellow was Franek Bleichman. He came from another town. We met also.\nHe wasn't from this town from\u2014 what's name \u2014 Markuszow. He was from Kamionka, a\nsmall town. And he came out with a small group of his people, of Jewish people\u2014 young,\nyoungsters. He was maybe 18, 19 years. He wasn't a army man too, but he was very\nshrewd and he was \u2014 he knew the neighborhood. His father, I think, was dealing with\nfarmers or something and he was taking him with him, and he knew around the\n'9 Armia Ludowa\n0 Wladyslaw Gomulka\n*1 Mieczyslaw \u201cMietek\u201d Moczar\n*2 Michal \u201cRola\u201d Zymierski\nneighborhood. And this Bleichman became very handy to us and he was always helping\nus, going when we needed in the night for a \u2014 certain things. Because this Tolka \u2014 no,\nGenek Kaminski, he gave us orders now already. He told us, \"Go in this and this place\nand there is \u2014 a train going through.\u201d And we took axes and very primitive things,\nshovels and all this, and take away a piece of rail, of rail. A train will come. It will fell off\nfrom this. And the first action was \u2014 the train was right in the beginning. And we came\noff \u2014 I remember I had a very strong man. Zelazny\u201d was his name, zelazny~* means iron.\nAnd we called him \u201cZelazny,\u201d because he was so strong, and he, he ripped out with those\n\u2014 almost with his hand, he ripped out a piece of the rail and but we still \u2014 he ripped it out\nbut it was staying still. He didn't \u2014 he didn't take it away. And with axes, we were\nworking there for hours until we heard a train coming. A train coming, and we stay away\nand the train stopped. It stopped there because when the train saw that something was\nmissing or something later, the train stopped. But it disrupt already maybe a whole night\nand a whole day the communication because they, they were dragging who knows what \u2014\nsome ammunition to the front. It was on the way from Lublin to Warsaw. This, this was\nthe spot. And we disrupted already this. Its \u2014 but we couldn't stay there too long, because\nwe were afraid and we came back and we told this Tolka, reported to him that we did this\nand this. He was very happy, and this gave us some kind of a lift. \u201cOh, we can do\nthings!\u201d\nThen he sent us out on the highways. We put up a metal string to the highways. When a\ncar came, it had to stop. We stopped them and we were on the sides waiting for them. We\nhad a few rifles already from the farmers what we took. But interesting was this. One of\nour man \u2014 his name was Finkel\u2019? \u2014 went back to the camp where I was working and there\nwas another hospital too, and there were rifles and there were pistols and they were \u2014\nwhat's the name \u2014 other things, what do you need? Coats, because when I ran out I\ncouldn't take nothing with me. It was still warm. Nobody has a \u2014 nobody had a coat with\nhim. It was cold. It start to be cold, so we were shivering cold. And we sent out this\nFinkel. He did \u2014 didn't look like a Jew completely. He was looking like a Pollack. And he\nwent back to the camp and he organized there another 20 people. But this time they took\na German and they told him \u2014 they were dealing with him, like I told you, the Jews were\nhelp \u2014 dealing with them Germans there. They told him, \"You see and look. Don't say\nnothing.\u201d And they put on the rifles and uniforms and what's the name \u2014 covers and bed\nspreads and all kinds of things, a full truck, and he was dealing with them before \u2014\nrobbing them to sell things, but he didn't know what is going on and we had \u2014 Finkel\nknew where we will be there in the woods. He made a an appointment with him, and he\nbrought over the whole truck with maybe about 20 rifles. New ones, German ones.\nCompletely new ones! And he brought it over to us on the spot. The German, that was\none of the guy who was the leader from the Dworecki was his name. He said to the\nGerman, \"You go back and shut up. Don't say one word, you know us. You saw nothing,\n3 \u201cZelazny\u201d Eisenberg\n74 Tron (Polish)\n*\u00b0 Stefan Finkel\nbecause they will kill you, or we will kill you. Then just don't say nothing.\u201d \"No, I will\nnot say nothing,\" and let him go.",
        "A: Finkel went back too, because he knew the place. He was living there before, and he\nknew how to get in. And he walked into the people there in the hospital there and he\ncontacted himself with this group, and the people Dworecki was there like a Mikoi the\nwhole group, about 20 people. And he talked to them. He was there two, three days. We\nknew what is it \u2014 we will be like this two, three days and we had a appointment with him\nto come back on this and this spot. And he \u2014 they knew \u2014 he knew that they are dealing\nwith this German too. He knew always, of course, because he was dealing with this\nGerman, too. And they took out whatever they wanted.",
        "A: No. You needed money if you would buy it, but they didn't. They told them \u2014 they took\nout a pistol from the \u2014 and they said to this German, \"You go back. No money for you.\nYou just thank God for your life and get back and don't say nothing to nobody.\u201d And he\nwent back and we had the rifles. I received \u2014 I remember a German coat I put on and a\nhat \u2014 the German I put on.",
        "A: And I felt, I felt in two ways. First of all, I got warmer because it was very, very cold, but\nI felt very bad that I have to wear a uniform from a German. That was always\ninconceivable. This was something what \u2014 goodness! But we felt proud for the whole\nsituation what we did because this was nobody could accomplish a thing like this. This\nwas a big accomplishment to bring 20 rifles, new ones, on the spot.",
        "A: We had a small army. We had already this and we told this Tolka all of them. We told\nthem what we have now and what is. Everybody was happy. We start doing real work.\nWe start going out for the Germans on the highways. Then we start the towns. Every\ntown had a town house, and in this town house they were registering everybody and\nwhen you were registering the people, the Germans were using it. One second, I have to\ndrink. The Germans registered almost every young Pollack. They registered even the\nJews, whatever the registration in the \u2014 in the town house. We got our order to recover\nthis, to fight and to burn it out, ruin it that they shouldn't have the registrations from the\npeople there because they took it away to Germany. They took it away to work. They\nhave a register. They came up home, and they took up the kids and we start burning up\nthe towns. Every town house there, and Markuszow was the first we knew where to go.\nWe always used the people what were from there from this town, say from Markuszow\nsay from \u201d \u00a2 and other towns where they have \u2014 we had the people what run\naway from them villages. And they were together with us then.",
        "A: It was, 1t was very easy. We took some straw and we threw in straw and made a fire.",
        "A: They saw, and they didn't say. Some people \u2014 the Pollacks they saw, they were afraid of\nus because we came with rifles and then they \u2014 it was night. Always in the night we were\ndoing it. And we were burning. It was very, very easy for us. We would \u2014 except once we\nhad in Markuszow we had some going over. The Germans were there, and \u2014 but before,\nbefore we came in the Germans were there. And by accident, they saw our people and we\nhad to fight with them. And we still burned down. It was a whole story. Is a very long\nstory. And we still burned down the village. But we had losses there. One was killed, and\none was Zelazny the strongest guy what we had had still today, still today had a piece of\niron from the bullet was in him, staying there. Didn't come out.",
        "A: I was the leader. As I was going with them, people, first of all, this not like in other\narmies. A partisan, the leader had to go front. That was our \u2014 I don't know why, but we\ntook over the \u2014 a leader was in the front, and the soldiers were behind. Here I think is the\nother way around. I remember in the army it was the other, other way. The officer was in\nthe back and the soldiers were going in the front. I remember in the war, the old officers\nwere in the back and the soldiers were in the front. Then here we changed it. I was\nalways in the lead. I had to go in the front. Wherever you went, I had always with me let's\nsay a Bleichman or another one, what knew the terrain and I was in the front, going and\nthey were after me. That's what we was scared stiff. Every night when you go, you don't\nknow what will happen. Who will shoot or who will do something to you, you\nunderstand? You didn't know if you will meet Pollacks what are against you \u2014 I'm sorry.\nOne second. I don't know what happen. All of a sudden, some food or whatever. But you\nhad to do it. You cannot tell the people that you are afraid. You had to go. You had to\nlead. And it was like a army. We got orders, you know, to burn down this and this\nvillage. And we did it. Next, we had this group of our people went out for food one night,\na separate group, small, and on the way back some Polish people called over two of them\nwhat they knew them by name. Morel, and the other one I don't remember. Morel and the\nPollacks, young boys from the same town where this Jew was, called him over, said,\n\u201cMorel, come over here.\u201d And he had a machine gun this guy and they called him over. It\ndidn't took long and they killed them, both of them. The Pollacks. And the rest of this\ngroup, was maybe four or five came running to us in the middle of the night. Running,\nand they left everything because they had some food something, and they left everything\nand said, \"You know, they killed Morel, and the killed the other one. Two guys.\u201d We\nmade a meeting from a few people there and we could talk to this Genek Kaminski came\nover to him because we wanted to find out exactly who did it because we didn't know\nwho killed him. We knew the village where it happened. Then after meeting is an end, we\ndecided to burn down the, the whole village. And we burned down the whole village.\nCame over at night from one corner to the other. But one thing we didn't, we didn't kill\nthe people. We told them to run out before we went from one place to the other. We had\nstraw and as we had other, I think gasoline a little, I think, we took, too, petroleum or\nsomething we had. We pour a little bit match and burned the whole village. It was a very\n\u2014 one of the, one of the richest villages there around.",
        "A: This was \u2014 it didn't feel good altogether because we had to live with them Pollacks. We\ndidn't come to fight with the Pollacks, and we left them and I remember I wrote myself a\npiece of paper in Polish. I was \u2014 by the way, I was writing almost everything what I went\nthrough by the day. I had a paper, a book with me, paper and a pencil and I was writing\ndown almost everything what happened. But I will tell you later what happened to it. And\nI wrote them a leaflet like that said, \"You see what you're doing. You kill our people. We\nhave to kill you. We didn't come to fight with you. We want to fight the Germans, and I\nthink you supposed to help us and not going against us and on top of this to kill our\npeople.\u201d I left notes and left this. Then we had a case like this. We were in a farm house.\nAnd a Polish man there which lived there went to the Germans, and he told them. The\nGermans came and somehow we, we were always soldiers. That's what's good for us\nbecause we were watching. We had a watch outside, a watch inside. If we were sleeping,\nwas still was a watch. One or two was watching. I was on the watch there outside and I\nsee a lineup of Germans coming. It was on a hill. We were in a house and downstairs,\ndown below the Germans are coming. I woke up everyone of us, put on \u2014 we had to \u2014 we\nstart running out from the house because when they came to a house near that's it.\nNobody could get out because they threw like we did. Straw or something and they start\nshooting with fire, ammunition, and they burned down the houses and they burned down\nthe people there. We ran out and we run away a whole day, we had to fight with the\nGermans. We ran, shoot back, run and shoot back. No one of our people was killed there\nin this skirmish. In the night, the Germans disappeared. They left us alone. We went back\nto this village, and we went to the house where this happened where we left, left the\nhouse and we said, \"What's going on?\" The man wasn't there already and the son wasn't\nthere and we start asking people. They said, \"The son went to the Germans and he told\nthem that we are there.\u201d So, \"Good. We will stay there and watching.\u201d And all of a\nsudden I see there a young, a youngster walks and I called him over, say, \"Who are you?\"\nHe said, \"Oh, I didn't want to. I\u2014 They \u2014 My father told me to go.\u201d It was the guy what\nwe slept there, and he said his father told him to go to report to the Germans, you know,\nthis. \"I will work with you. I will be with you and please don't kill me. Don't.\u201d We took\nhim away. We really didn't want to kill him. Just want to beat him there, you know, a\ngood beating, but I saw him. Of course, a man like this if he goes report the Germans,\nhe's a spy already against us. This is nothing. Then we took him out in the outskirts and\nstart beating him up. He was screaming there. Then one of our people saw that he\nscreams too loud, took out the rifle and they killed him. I was sorry that they killed him,\nbut still it was coming to him. When he killed him \u2014 he shot him it made a noise. The\nshot and the Germans were not far, and they start shooting at us and they started, but it\nwas night and we just got away. The next day they buried this boy, the Pollacks or two\ndays in the churchman. What is the name? The Pope. What is the name?",
        "A: The priest said to the congregation, \u201cListen, people, you see what's going on. When a\ngroup of people come in...\u201d",
        "A: This will come out there too.",
        "A: Yes, exactly. That's what I'm going to bring out, because it was very important. And the\npriest came over and said, \"Listen people. You see what's going on. We have the\nGermans on one side. We have the partisans on the other side \u2014 the Jews, the Pollacks or\nwhatever it is. The Jew \u2014 the Germans are our \u2014 is our enemy number one. This group 1s\ncoming to you. They want some food in the night and they're going away. They don't stay\nwith you. Don't report them. Don't tell nothing because you will be squeezed in both\nsides. They will kill you. See here is a boy killed for nothing,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause he, he\nwent to the Germans and he told.\u201d He said, \"Don't do it any more.\u201d The priest said that.\nThis helped a lot. Like I say, the priest \u2014",
        "A: Oh, the Pollack, they told me. The farmer's group. When I went to the farmers, I came in.\nI was home because I repeat the places. When I went over to a farmer and he was nice to\nus. You know, the farmer. Because some of them, they were not too nice. They just gave\nus what we wanted and get out. Some of them were really nice. They kept us. They told\nus to stay with them. Then we came to them back, and they told us what is going on.\nThey told me the priests spoke like this, and the priest told them and knew he told them\nalso. He said, \"Why do you have to go to call the Germans? The Germans are far away.\nThey don't know what is going \u2014 coming in the, in the woods. If you told them, they\nknow.\u201d And this made a big difference. Big, because people stop, stopped bothering us.\nThey stopped, except they let us go. We came in. We did our work. We did never, never\nabuse them people because there were groups like robbers or something people came in\nthey run away. They were on the German's hands or whatever, and they formed also, not\npartisans groups \u2014 bandits from this, and they came in usually and they took away\nwhatever the farmer had. But we came in like gentlemen you know. We came in with a\nspeech. I said \u2014 I told them, \u201cWe're fighting for freedom. We don't want nothing from\nyou. We just want to eat something and we want to relax or to sleep a few hours.\u201d And\nthis one farmer told the other, and they knew what's going on. Now \u2014",
        "A: \u201cThe Mietek,\u201d \u201cthe Mietek Grupa\u201d\u00b0,\u201d \u201cGroup of Mietek,\u201d \u201cthe Group of Mietek.\u201d The\ngroup \u2014 lots of things later on: \u201cThe Group of Jegier,\u201d names the people knew.",
        "A: My group, \u201cMietek.\u201d Everybody knew about it and they knew \u2014 the farmers knew about\nme, and they knew about this recommend. In fact, there was a, a landowner, very rich\none, and he always gave us money when we came. And he gave us a cow or whatever,\nwhatever we wanted. Horses we needed to go from one place to another. He always gave\nus. Then he gave it when I was there. If the group came in without me, he wouldn't give.\nHe wouldn't give. Nothing.",
        "A: I don't know. He had a mind something, and I think he was right after this. After the war,\nthis landowner was arrested for helping the Germans like because he had Germans there\nalso in the landowners house. And he called me as a witness that I should tell the court\nhow he helped, how he gave money you know. And he said, said \u201cI didn't gave no money\nto nobody, only you. You should be the witness. You should know about it.\u201d And he used\nit after the war. He gave money only to me. We used the money for all kinds of things we\ngave the farmers.",
        "A: It took time to be 100 percent confident in this. It was very, very hard. I will tell you\nstraight. With Jewish people, it is very, very hard to be a leader. Every one of our Jewish\npeople were a leader himself. They knew a lot you know. They are not dummies.\nEveryone of them, and to be a leader by Jews, you really have to have guts and you have\nto have patience and you have to have \u2014 I don't know what \u2014 to be a leader, but this is no\njokes. This is I tell you at this \u2014 what's the Ben-Gurion?\u2019 said it was, \u201cI am a president of\nmillion presidents.\u201d And that was very, very hard for Jewish people this. But there was a\nnecessity. I have the upper hand because I spoke fluent Polish. When I came to a farm or\n6 Group (Yiddish)\n7 David Ben-Gurion\nsomething I had \u2014 I had to speak because most of them spoke Yiddish and the language\nwas difficult. Only Szengut was the guy what \u2014 but he looked so Jewish and so Yiddish\nhe couldn't, he couldn't represent us you know. It was \u2014 we had to push him a little bit on\nthe side. Now, we established our presence in the neighborhood, but we felt we couldn't\nstay too long in the neighborhood. They told us not to stay, and we didn't. We felt \u2014\nbecause we exhausted \u2014 I came twice \u2014 three times to the same farmer. He didn't have\nwhat to eat himself to watch this, and we had to go farther. Then I decided to go with the\ngroup of 10 people to find out \u2014 because they were talking about other groups on the\nother side of the Bug. We were \u2014 there was \u2014 when you see the map, there was a, a \u2014 this\nriver, Wieprz, is the name \u2014 Wieprz and the next was the Bug. The Bug was the border\nfrom Poland and Russia already later. But we were between the Wieprz and the Bug\nlater. In the beginning, we were on the other side of the Wieprz. We had to cross. And we\ncrossed over the Wieprz and we knew that between the Wieprz and Bug 1s a group \u2014 1s\ngroups, partisans there that we heard about. You know they told us, the farmers. There\nwas no telephones, but we heard that.\nWe had connections all the time. This Genek, his connections was saving us always. We\nknew when the Germans going out from Lublin with a expedition of something, we knew\nabout it. They told us. The farmers, one told the other and they told us. We had the\nconnections. We had this. And only with connections we could live through. We were\nlaughing already there when I was going sometimes in the night. I laughed and said what\ngroup 1s going again that meetings to get a connection then. I felt that is the way to be\nbecause when you are a group, you live by yourself, and you don't know \u2014 no telephones,\nnothing. You don't know what's going to come next, and they were spying. You have to\nhave this. You have to know what your neighbor's doing. You have to know what's going\non, and you have to know the other groups. You have to know what's in the, what's going\non in the country or in Russia. We knew about politics. We knew everything was in the\nfront. This in the front. This we knew everything what's going on. I was reading papers. I\nwas seeing everything clearly. Otherwise, we couldn't live. It was impossible. Of course,\na lot of groups were \u2014 a lot of Jews run away, and they didn't have the organization. They\ndidn't have the connections and they disappeared. They disappeared. The Pollacks killed\nthem themselves or somehow the Germans \u2014 they told the Germans. They disappeared.\nDisappeared group by group disappeared. And I went through this Wieprz. There was a\nwhole story how we went through that. And we came over on the other side, and I was so\ntired. Unbelievably tired. And I was sorry that I brought them people on the other side\nbecause we were walking two days and two nights. We didn't know where we are going.\nCompletely! We were \u2014 like I say, I didn't have the connection. I didn't have the people\naround me. The neighborhood there I knew already. I knew where I'm going. And here I\ndidn't know nothing. And we walked over to a farm, and we woke up a woman there and\nshe start screaming and crying, \"Please don't do this.\u201d I said, \"Don't worry. We will not\ndo nothing to you. Just let us in.\u201d She said, \"No, I can't because I have a child 1s sick.\nVery sick. He had typhus or something and you will catch it too. Don't go in.\u201d Said,\n\"Okay, we will go in the barn.\u201d We went in the barn. We were dead. We were so tired of\nwalking. I think it will start snowing or something later and there was a real night, I felt\nhalf, half dying. And I lay down in the, the barn and all our people. We always kept one\nmen to watch and all of a sudden maybe it was day already. I wake up and I see nobody's\nwatching. Nobody! I woke up, and I was a very sleeper \u2014 I, I could hear everything\nalways when sleep. I don't know why. This was nature or something. I could hear\neverything. Whatever happened in sleep always, I could hear it. Then I walked over \u2014 I\nwoked up, I went over to the door to the barn and I see, all of a sudden, I see Germans,\nPolish uniforms, the police, and farmers and the whole posse but still forming, still going.\nAnd I woke up my people very fast. And we walked out with the front and shooting at\nthem. They were not still organized. They were still starting something then, and we start\nshooting at them. And walked around the barn, and we start running away. Because they\nwere an army there. Who knows how many? I didn't know. And we start running,\nrunning and we \u2014 I see very bad. There's no trees, nothing. We are only a few houses\nthere, and it is a field. They have a good field for us to shoot us when we running. They\ncan shoot everybody. And little by little we start moving away, moving away and all of a\nsudden, I see one guy fall beside and then I see another one fall. They were not dead. Just\none was shot in the foot, and one was somewhere else shot and he said, \"Please take my\nrifle. I am dead. They will kill me anyway.\u201d I said, \"I don't need your rifle. I have mine.\u201d\nI couldn't do nothing. Then all of a sudden I feel a shot. It was my finger here. I have still\nthe finger here like this, shot here right here. I squeezed my hand. I see blood. Yes, I took\nout, I don't know, a handkerchief or something. I put it on. I didn't make a big deal of it. I\nwas walking, walking. All of a sudden I feel a shot in my foot, in my leg. Yeah, right\nhere. Through. And I cannot walk no more. I cannot walk. I was trying you know.\nSzengut right behind me, and he start pulling me. He said, \"You have to walk.\u201d In the\nmeantime, the rest of the people \u2014 we were about 10 or 12 \u2014 start moving. You know,\nthey cannot wait for me. They see this one 1s laying, another is laying, and he, he didn't\nleave me alone. He starts pulling me, and I start walking and walking. I see I still can\nwalk. The bone wasn't touched. And this was luck. It was just the meat here that was shot\nhere. And I could walk. It was bleeding a little bit, but I still walked.\nAnd we run over to a house there and we told the farmer, \"Fast put on a horse and\nwagon,\u2019 Szengut said, \u201cand we will put on \u2014 I will put you down on this on the wagon\nand we will start running away with this.\u201d Then all of a sudden I see the Germans right\nby the border there when I was, I was there. They came out. And one starts talking\nPolish to me. And he says in Polish, \"You're a Jew, bastard?\" or something, this. And he\naimed with a rifle this, and he didn't, I don't know, he didn't hit me. I got up and Szengut\ngrabbed me and left the horse with the wagon, and I start screaming with my people. I\nstart screaming with my people, they rest, \"Stop and start shooting back. Start shooting\nback because otherwise nobody will live.\u201d And I remember like today this one of them\nguys, it was Andrejew. He was the first one. He turned around, took out the rifle, he was\naiming at the Germans. The Germans stopped. They stopped. Right away they fell\nthrough the floor. And when he took out a few of our people. There was a Finkel there\nwas a few four or five. They took out the rifles and they start shooting back. When they\nstopped the Germans, I had time to with Szengut to run away to come over and we went\nover to a woods somewhere there around not far, and the Germans stopped a little bit\nbehind and they had three of our people and I think they, they killed there because I know\n\u2014 don't know what happened to them again. And between them was this Majdanek, this\nguy what run away from Majdanek. He was killed there right away in this skirmish. And\nI run away to the woods. In the meantime, Szengut and another one, Finkel, they both\nwent back to look. Maybe they can help somebody to \u2014 they came to a farmhouse and\nthey opened the door there, and when they opened the door Germans was sitting there. A\nwhole bunch of them was sitting there, and they were singing or eating something. You\nknow they, they had that trophy. They took away \u2014 I think they took away some money\nfrom these three guys too. They had maybe a few \u2014 I don't know what kind money. And\nFinkel closed the door and Szengut had hand grenade and they threw in there the hand\ngrenade into this, and they don't know what happened there. Then they run away, and\nthey found me. I was still waiting.\nAnd we took a farmer, stopped with a horse and wagon on this \u2014 put me on this and they\nsat down and I was with Szengut and another one and they had another \u2014 they stopped\nother farmers when they \u2014 on the way and we start moving. And on the way I asked the\nfarmer, \"Maybe you will take me home because I am shot and I cannot \u2014 my finger start\nbothering me very much, more than the foot.\u201d I said, \"I cannot walk and I cannot, I\ncannot function.\u201d He said, \"You have to be helped.\u201d I said, \"Oh no, my wife is sick and\nthere's a \u2014 I'm afraid, but I will bring you over. I have a farm and I have a man what\nworks for me, and he will keep you. He will keep you there.\u201d I said, \"Alright, whatever\nhe wanted to do.\u201d And he brought me over to another farmer and the farmer was very\nnice to me. They, they took a Band-Aid and they, they took some water. I don't know\nwhat kind of water. They washed it and they cleaned it very, very nice. They, they helped\nme out. It took almost a half a day, something, I was there sitting. All of a sudden,\nshooting again. I was with Szengut, and another Piasecki was another guy. We were there\nin the partition there. The rest of the group was in another house. Start shooting in the\nhouse. Like a thunder. Shoot directly in the house. And the farmer showed me the way\nout in the back and me and Piasecki. I got up and I said, \"Where is Henryk?\u201d I said,\n\"Where is Finkel?\u201d And I start looking back and I don't see him. And the farmer said,\n\"You cannot wait a second. Run. Run.\u201d And from the back of the farm it was already\nstart to be a little darkish and I run away with Piasecki, this guy. We run away both of us.\nAnd with my wounded foot then I had to walk a whole night. I was walking in the woods.\nWalking, walking, walking. It was day almost. I went over. I had no, no choice already. I\ndidn't know what to do myself. I walked over to a farmer. \u201cYou should help me\nsomething or give me a piece of bread or something.\u201d And I came over to the farm. The\nfarmer boy standing there came out and said, \"God, what are you doing here?\" He said,\n\"The Germans were here last night here. And they killed one of your people,\" he said.\nAnd I figure out that that was Szengut. \u201cOne of you people was killed. And they took off\neven his boots they took off because he wore new boots. He said, \"They took off his\nboots and they took him away. And you are here! How does it happen?\" I walked a\nwhole night in the woods and I came back to the same spot. You know in the night, you\ndon't know where you're going and there's a woods. You don't know it that way.\nI came back to this house. Then in the day time, what I found out, the Germans are still\nthere. They said, \"No. No. They went away. But they still come back or whatever.\u201d They\nsaid, \u201cThey knew that the partisans here, the group 1s here.\u201d I said, \"I have no choice. In\nthe daytime with this Piasecki, we were both of us we start moving back from where I\ncame. I came back and I came over to the Wieprz, to the river. There's a big river and you\nstay here a night. Cannot walk. Then all of a sudden came in a bunch, a bunch of Polish\nkids from school. They went there and they start screaming, \"Jew. Jew.\u201d I was so\ndisgusted. At least I had something in my hand like glass. I will throw this as a bomb I\nsaid, \u201cif you don't go away, if you don't stop this screaming. \u201cThey shut up and then came\nin a man. I don't know, it looked like a school teacher. He was dressed up nice. He said,\n\"What happened? You are \u2014 you have a problem here?\" I said \u2014I said, \"Yes. I want to go\nthrough the Wieprz.\u201d I said, \"How can I go?\" He said, \"Don't worry. I will show you\nwhere.\u201d He brought me over to a small house there, and there 1t was a guy with his \u2014 he\nhad this \u2014 a boat, a small boat, and he was bringing over people on other side. That was\nhis \u2014 he said, \"You have money?\" Said, \"No, I don't have no money, but I have a\nlighter.\u201d I remember a very nice lighter. I had it from Kaganowicz, I forgot to tell the\nstory. Kaganowicz was killed. And I took away a watch and some lighter and I think he\nhad some money, and I took it away from him, and I had it with me. And this lighter I\ntook out. \"Show me it works.\u201d I showed him it works. \"Okay.\u201d For this lighter, he took\nme over on the other side with Piasecki. We came over to the other side. The other side I\nknew already where farmers are and this I came over and I see a light, some a farmer. I\nsee a light. I say I was afraid. You know this? I start looking near this and I came over\nand see the rest of my people are there. And they went \u2014 the Wieprz, then they came back\nto this farmer. They knew also the farmer from before because we knew when we left.\nWe met and they said, \"Oh, you still alive. Somebody said that you are killed.\u201d They\ndidn't know. Szengut was killed because they said somebody was wounded and he was\nkilled. They knew already. Oh, they was so happy that I am alive, that \u2014 and I went back\nwith this group. I remained maybe a day or something like a whole day without them too.\nThey went for food or something and I was staying with them. It was also very, very bad.\nI was feeling very bad, but they left me and they went. But they came for me, and we\nwent together. We went back to the place that we knew before. And they came over to a\nplace where there was a bunker where I told them bunkers, and this Tolka had a bunker\nthere before, before with his Markuszow people and Jegier and all those people.\nAnd I came over. There's nobody there. They disappeared. And all of a sudden came over\na \u2014a father and daughter. Said, \"No, Tolka is no more here. He's somewhere else. They\nbuilt another bunker because he was afraid to stay here. He built for 40 people, he built a\nbunker somewhere else. I said, \"Can I meet him.\u201d The guy said, \"Wait, maybe he has to\ncome in here. Tolka has to come in here.\u201d I said, \"Alright.\u201d And it didn't take long. This\nTolka came over with Nam\u2014 with somebody else. They said, \"Look. Look here, I am\nwounded,\u201d and they said, \"I haven't got where to take you. It's full there.\" \"It's 40\npeople,\" he said, \"We have no food there. It's impossible that we should take you. No.\u201d\nWhat can I do? Then I remind myself I met a guy, Drop was his name, like a farmer, a\nPollack, what was nice to us. And I went back to him. I came back to him and he was, he\nwas so fond of me. He start kissing me. He was so, so happy to see me, and he saw me in\nthis condition and he kept me maybe a few weeks, a few weeks and all 10 of our people\nwere there. Ten \u2014 two or three was killed \u2014 about nine people. We were there in his home\nby this Drop. He went to a drug store. He bought for me some, something to cover with\nand he helped me a lot. This finger gave me a lot of trouble. I got gangrene in this finger,\nand the whole hand was so we will have to cut this hand, but I had a very strong\nconstitution and I felt good or whatever and it helped and it went away, but I have this till\ntoday. It's crooked. I can do nothing about it. I don't want to do nothing. The foot didn't\ngave me too much trouble. It was a time until it healed and I could walk and I was\nstaying there. till February 14, 1943, I was by farm \u2014 Drop\u2019s farm.",
        "A: Yes.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "A: Like I said before, that in February *43, Drop, the farmer, came over to our place in the\nbarn and we were there a few weeks already. And he says, \"Listen, boys, I cannot keep\nyou no \u2014 any longer. There is a problem.\u201d I said, \"What happened.\u201d He said, \"The\nbunker, from 40 people in the bunker with Jegier , they were all killed. And I am afraid\nnow. It's not far from here,\" he said, \u201cIt was Amelin, was the name of the town there,\nvillage, and it's not far from my place and I am afraid the Germans will kill me and kill\nyou. Just tonight start walking.\u201d And we went out. We start going to farmers in the night.\nWe came over to one place, they kept us very nicely and we had a very good experience\nwith her in the night a farm woman there with a family, and they were very nice to us.\nAnd she told us that she heard also what was going on there and that they killed 40\npeople there in the bunker what Jegier and Tolka had the Russia. This was a lot of my\nfriends. I felt very, very bad and it was upsetting and we were afraid too because now the\nGermans will go after us, because we see the end. It's no way out. But we come to a farm\nlike this and we got in touch back again with Genek Kaminski and we start telling him\nthe story what happened. Then he knew too. He knew what's going on. After maybe two\ndays, we walked around. All of a sudden in the night, we see a group is walking. Who\nknows? During the night we had our things. We called \"amkha,\" we called out. That was\nour \u2014 what do you call it?",
        "A: Code. And we called out \"Amkha,\" and they answered \"Amkha.\u201d We said, \"Who is this?\"\n\u201cJegier.\u201d Jegier with a group of people. Of course, it was Rubinstein, there \u2014 Sever \u2014 and\nother people. \"Oh, my God, What happened?\" They said, \"They killed you.\u201d Said,\n\"Happened that we went out \u2014 14 people \u2014 we went out to forage there, to bring some\nfood for the whole group and just at this night, when we walked out the Germans came\nin. Somebody told them. The farmers told them where we are located, and they killed\nevery \u2014 they threw in hand grenades and they killed everybody in this.\u201d Tolka and Mikoi\nand these friends of mine from Markuszow \u2014 all killed. But 14 of them somehow got out.\nWe were very happy to see them and we start moving together with. But still to go\naround with a bigger group was very dangerous and not practical. When we come to a\nfarm, \"We can give you food for 10, eight people.\u201d But to feed a group for 30, 40 was\nalready a big deal. They didn't have even food for themselves. Then we divided, and\nJegier took his group, the Markuszow and others, whatever was left, and I had the\nprisoners of war I was with, but we kept very close touch. We was almost two, three\nnights we had some spots where we met. We made in advance, \u201cyou will be there and\nthere,\u201d or we knew what's going always a few days.",
        "A: We didn't think about then about women or not women. It was very, very hard for a man\nand if a woman, it was almost impossible, but if a woman would come along, we would\nnot send her away.\nThat's why I say through communication we find out what's going on, we found out what,\nwhat's going on, and happened she was her family or something from this leader\nAnielewicz\u201d*, and she knew what's going on there. She told us the whole story how the\nfight was going on. A lot of people run away, and they are looking for partisans to fight,\nto go somewhere. And I kept her around me. She was officially like my girl, you know,\nbecause I took care of her and I watched her, but she couldn't be with us to do some work\n*8 Mordechai Anielewicz\nor to live together in the quarters. They lived separately. And walking around there, I\ncame to a farmer and there's like a small child three, four years, a girl, laying there dirty.\nShe had \u2014 full of rats, she was \u2014 terrible situation she looked. And I took \u2014 I told \u2014 I said,\n\"Who is this child.\u201d He doesn't know, the farmer. He doesn't know. He found her on the\nstreet. I figured right away, it's a Jewish girl. And I cleaned her up and I brushed her and I\nstayed already and they special for her and I told the farmer, in no two ways, \"This girl\nhas to live and this girl you will feed and you will watch her.\u201d He said, \"I am afraid the\nother farmers will tell on me.\u201d I said, \"Good.\u201d I went out. The whole village was not too\nbig. It was a small one. And I knocked on the doors and the windows at night and I said,\n\"Listen, there will be in two weeks a young girl coming to you to live with you. You keep\nher. And this girl, if something will happen to her, you will all be burned down.\u201d \"You\nremember we burned down a place, I said to them. That will happen to you people.\u201d \"No.\nNo. I will take care of it.\u201d Thank God, they took care of this kid. It did live through the\nwar. She's today a teacher in Israel in the high school and I met her there when I was on\n81, I met her, and she's healthy. She's married, and she has a nice family and I was very,\nvery happy. She was happy to see me too. And she, she thanked me very well for this.",
        "A: Absolutely. It had nothing to do with her. She was on the side, but I want to bring out, if\nyou talk about women, we will talk about this later. We got a order that we cannot stay in\nthis neighborhood no more. It was very dangerous there. A lot of Germans came in there.\nIn the neighborhood",
        "A: Through this Kaminski, everything goes there. We had a \u2014 name by the name: Mietek\nMoczar, he came to us. He looked a little bit like you. Tall and yes, handsome man. He\nwas, he was in a uniform for a major in the Polish army. Eloquent. The man could speak\nnice and also he came to us to pep us up, to talk to us, and he was a few weeks with us.\nMaybe two weeks, he was working with us. He took part in our actions, whatever that\u2019s\nsupposed to be done. And he was very close with me. Somehow we got friendly, and we\nkept this friendship until he died now. Later, he died in Poland. And there was another\none with the name \u201cBolek Alef,\u201d Bolkowiak\u2019\u2019. He was after the war a general in Poland.\nHe stayed in Poland. This man was also from Warsaw. He was in action in Warsaw, in\nthe ghetto and he ran away from the ghetto and he came to the woods. But he was like an\nactivist. He went, he didn't stay in one place. He was going from one group to the other,\nfrom one place to the other Polish groups and other groups. Whatever it was group he\nwas talking to as a speaker, a good one, and he was a \u2014 I think he was a lawyer for the\nwar too. Bolek Alef, he\u2019s now \u2014 he died also two years ago in Poland. And they were all\n\u2014 others they came to us. You say, \u201cWho?\u201d The people, they had the connections through\n2\u00b0 Gustaw \u201cBolek Alef\u2019 Bolkowiak\nthis Genek, he was arranging this and they came. They knew where we are, and in the\nnight we were in this and this village. We met, and this one thing when Moczar \u2014 when\nhe came, we ordered the whole village \u2014 a few villages together, and he spoke to them.\nAnd he spoke to them, he made a political \u2014 told them, \"Listen. Those partisans, they are\nfighters. They are Jews. They are doing their job and we are working together and help\nthem and work with them.\u201d It was very, very important for us because, you know, we\nwere not alone. That's what I said all the time. We were with an organization. We worked\nwith them. And this helped. All the time came in, there was a Polish group there what\nthey were fighting as partisans but they were home more. When they are needed, they\ncame out. When we did something \u2014 there's a train or something, they came with us and\nthey helped us. Was a Franek \u2014 was a guy, Przybyszowka was a village. It was a very\nimportant group because they helped us a lot. And they had some connections with\nRussia, too, and Moczar had a connection with Russia. And an order came that we should\ngo away from this.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: We were a very loose organization. We did whatever we had to do. When it came \u2014 the\nGermans came in the middle of night. When they caught us by surprise or something, we\ndidn't have to ask somebody what to do. We were on our \u2014 on our \u2014 on our own. And\nwhen Jegier said \u2014 let's say he was working with this group, he was on his own. And I\nwith my group I was on my own. And then we met and we talked together you know.\nAnd we said what we will do, where we will go, how we will do things everything\nbecause the connections what they gave us was a big help to us. First, of course, before\nthey said, they have to wait for the Russians, and this was a big thing already because\nRussia start sending material, ammunitions and this, and food even they was end people.\nThey were ending up to the back \u2014 front they came, they was partisans and they came to\nus. Everybody came to us. But we, as Jews, didn't have the, the force but together we\nwere a big group and we had a paper. We gave out a paper. It was \u2014 every action we was\ntaken is still today written down. Maybe we will be in Poland, check. If they have the\nactions of their group from Emilia Plater was the name of my group, Emilia Plater.",
        "A: Emilia Plater was the leader from the freedom of Poland before Poland was under Russia,\nunder Germany and Austria, years ago in the 17s. And this Emilia Plater was a fighter\nlike Kosciuszko*\u2019, Pulaski?!. She was one of them fighters against tyranny of the Czar\n3\u00b0 Tadeusz Bonawentura Kosciuszko\n3! Kazimierz Pulaski\nand we took the name, Emilia Plater. She was a woman fighter then. I had another goes \u2014\nthe first time was Kozietulski** but not too long. She was also a fighter for freedom.",
        "A: Yeah. That was the relationship with A.L.. The other group was the A.K., Armia\nKrajowa. Then people were \u2014 it was like here, the Republicans and the Democrats. The\ndemocrat was more to the left, they was more to the right. The A.K. wasn't \u2014 wasn't 100\npercent antisemitic, but they didn't like Jews. But they didn't let's say kill directly. They\nwere not friendly to us. But we met once in while because we caught \u2014 a guy came from\nLondon. He was thrown down by a parachute, to help the partisans, whatever. And he\nwas from the A.K. He told us right away. We caught him. He fell into our hands. And he\nstart talking to us, and he showed us how to make hand grenades, a big one he was\nmaking. And he was with us a few days. Then we brought him over. He said he wants to\ngo. He has contacts and he wants to go immediately. And you shouldn't bring him. We\nwere very careful, but we brought him over there, and they made a party for us. They\ngave us food because they knew the guy. Nothing happened to us and we were very\ncareful. We were standing outside. The whole group. We were two or three people only\nworking. Jegier and me worked, and the rest were standing outside to watch. But we\ndidn't feel comfortable with them let's say put it this way. If they \u2014 they caught a Jew\nseparately on his own, they will kill. You know, as a group, they couldn't start with us.\nThey, they \u2014 they knew that what could happen to them. They didn't want to start with us.\nBut individuals, if they caught somebody, they \u2014 they caught the Morel, I told. That was\nalso from the A.K. We burned down the whole village because of this, that\u2019s why.",
        "A: Yeah. Then the order came we should go the other side. And when we came to the\nWieprz, then they divided us. Jegier with a group, and my group was divided Jegier went\naway with \u2014 some parachutes came down. Some Russian groups came down and he had\nto bring him over to some \u2014 kind of place. He was to stay with them. And I went over to\nthe other side of the Wieprz, between Wieprz and Bug. There were other groups there,\nand we have to unite because we cannot stay there. First of all, the terrain \u2014 the place\nwhere we were, were very antisemitic. They, they were known. We lived there from day\nto day because we had pistols, we had rifles. When we came to a farmer, he couldn't say\nnothing because he was afraid of us. But we didn't have the work with them you know.\nYou couldn't work with them. The other side were, were the White Russians. They \u2014 I\ndon't know \u2014 somehow they were better to us and they were nicer people. And then they\nhelped us and they told us to go there on the other side. And on the way, there a very big\nfight by the Wieprz, by crossing the Wieprz. The Germans were there and waiting for us\n>? Jan Leon Hipolit Kozietulski\nand we almost didn't make it to Wieprz. They, they, they made a ring around us, and they\nwere shooting and somehow someway we run through this one guy helped us with a boat,\nfrom our people other side and no one was killed. Nobody. And we came out on the other\nside, and the other side, they were shoot \u2014 the Pollacks, the A.K. were shooting on us.\nThey didn't know who this was, was all mixed up there. And the Germans pinned down a\ngroup of very, very important men from Russia that came to Janowski>\u2019, he was a writer\nfrom a main paper in Poland after the war. And they pinned them down. They couldn't \u2014\nthey couldn't move. They couldn't walk through the Wieprz, they couldn't. They stayed\non the other side. We went through again. Then again an order came back say, \"Go and\nrescue him.\u201d We went back. About four, or five people, was Bleichman, Finkel, and other\nZelazny. We went back and we took a boat, some wires, something \u2014 I don't remember\nexactly what it was. We brought over the whole group \u2014 20 people. We brought those\nwhole \u2014 oh, he said this Janowski came from Russia. He was a big shot from there\nalready. And he said, \"You will get medals for this. You, you did a job like.\u201d He was\nwounded, too. We was carrying on our hands. I remember, Zelazny, he was very strong\nman, we carried with his hands.\nWe carried him over. And we came to another place, another group, and after a few days,\nwe met Chiel Grynszpan**. Chiel Grynszpan had a group already from 40, 50 people\nthere. And then people were from the neighborhood people. He himself was a soldier. He\nwas a \u2014 whatever it is \u2014 cavalry men, on horses. He always liked to be on a horse and he\nfelt good with this. And he, he was a very plain man, a good man, and a good soldier. He\nhad a discipline with them people. We needed it because nobody knew how to keep a\nrifle, nothing. He was the only one there that knew something. There was another one\nlater on. But he \u2014 he managed. He was there immediately. When we came down, he was\nhappy. They really loved us, because we became soldiers. We became some kind of a\narmy and together right away, we started on trains. This is how highways, trains,\ncommunications lines cut and we together. Big train, but river and it was a bridge.\nThunder. We broke down the whole bridge, you know. It was on the border, the train.\nAnd the same time I was with another group, maybe a hundred people. There was\nchildren and women and all kinds of this there, and I found there. And I had to carry\nthem too. And on the way, like I say, we were the first one always to go. I walked straight\non a German with a rifle. And I walked them into the rifle. Imagine how that \u2014 how I felt.\nI stand still like a, like a dummy. I didn't know what to do. And all my people \u2014 was\nmaybe a 100 of them \u2014 all disappeared. In a second, I didn't see nobody. Myself I stand\non the highway.",
        "A: This was Chiel\u2019s people.\n3 Leon \u201cJanowski\u201d Kasman\n4 Jechiel Grynszpan",
        "A: Walking with them.",
        "A: In the lead.",
        "A: A German was standing with a rifle and I stopped. It was dark, pitch dark. A moment ago\nI was on a horse, a white horse I remember, and I had enough of the horse and I gave it to\nanother one and I was walking. In from right there. He saw us and he heard us because\nwe were talking. In Yiddish we talked, and everything was loud. Then he was by himself\nthere standing. And I came over and I saw a German. I said \u2014 I start talking German to\nhim \u2014 I said, \"Was machen Sie hier?*\u00b0\u201d \u201cWhat are you doing here in the night?\" He said,\n\"Look behind me.\u201d I looked. There's a dark like this, there's a truck, a whole truck. I said,\n\"There's more Germans?\" He said, \"Yes. There's in the truck sleeping people, and two of\nthem walked out for help.\u201d \u201cWhat happened?\u201d \u201cWe are stuck. We was \u2014 a whole column\nwent through here, and I am stuck with a few people stuck here on a truck.\u201d So, \u201cyou are\nours,\u201d we took him down.",
        "A: Yeah. Rifle \u2014 I start talk to him \u2014 he gave me the rifle. He gave me the rifle, just like\nthat. I couldn't believe it. He just handed over to me. And then all my people came up \u2014\nget up, took over the women, and he walked up. I said, \"There's somebody in.\u201d He said,\n\"Yes.\u201d \"Wake him up.\u201d We woke up two guys. One was a black uniform from SS like,\nand the other one was in a plain uniform. And he said, \u201cTwo went away, but I don't know\nwhere they are, but two are here.\u201d And all three we took away and the, the truck we\ndestroyed completely, and we took out a lot of rifles there, ammunition, and some\ncommunications they had, wire, some radio something. We destroyed everything\ncompletely. It took us almost a whole night to work on this and it was daylight almost in\nthe morning, and in the summer it gets six \u2014 five o'clock was there, and said, \"Let's\ndisappear from there,\" and we went.",
        "A: Oh, yes.\n35 What are you doing here? (German)",
        "A: Easily.",
        "A: They were regular army. They weren't in a column there. They didn't know what\npartisans is. They didn't know what's going on here altogether. They didn't have an idea.\nHere comes over a man talks to him in German, and he didn't know what happened to\nhim. You know, he didn't realize that, that I am the enemy. You know?",
        "A: I had a coat. I had a German coat, and I spoke German, and he didn't realize what\nhappened, and the others simply got up. And the other two simply got up. They had no\nchoice. The others had no choice because we saw them waking up. They were sleeping.\nThey were told to come out, and we were start dragging them around with me.",
        "A: Then we were maybe a week maybe. Somehow we couldn't get nobody. The line of\ncommunication was very, very bad. It was times that the Germans were all over.\nWherever we moved, the Germans were there. And we had to stay still, to wait, to go\nlater. He was, was with, with his people, and I was with my people there. And I, I had\nwomen and children and everybody. This wasn't the regular group. It was just a put\ntogether. Just for one day suddenly. \u2018Cause \u2014 I will tell you how it happened. We had the\nchildren with us, and we start dragging them around and the Pollacks start screaming at\nus, \"The Germans will look for them,\" and you have to do something. I didn't want to kill\nthem. I had pity special on this one what gave me the rifle. I, I didn't feel like killing him.\nTill today, I am sorry because the man was decent you know. He, he was a soldier and he\ngave me the rifle and didn't nothing. He could shoot me like nothing. He was in \u2014 he saw\nme and he gave it, and I didn't know. And we kept him maybe a week or two until we met\nwith Chiel back again and there's another group come over there, Russians and all this,\nand we made a meeting with three or four officers. And we talked it over and said, \"They\nhave to be killed. What they doing with us, they caught \u2014 they catch us? They \u2014 not only\nthey kill us, but they torture us. They cut pieces from us.\u201d In fact, they cut one of my\npeople. They caught once. They cut pieces from him. They put to a tree and they cut \u2014\nwith a knife they cut pieces from him. Lapides(ph) was his name. And that's what they\nwere doing with the partisans when they catch them. And they said, \"What shall we do\nwith them?\u201d I said, \u201cMaybe you should wait.\u201d I wanted \u2014 and there was already\nheadquarters there. We had in one place headquarters already from Moczar there, and one\nwith Zymierski there and all the big shots were there sitting \u2014 Bolek Alef and Zemsta*\u00ae\ncame also, the guy. And I said, \"Maybe we should.\u201d And they said, \"No, we will not drag\nthem out. We don't know how to get there. It's very hard now to go and communicate.\u201d\n3\u00b0 Major Aleksander \u201c\u201cZemsta\u201d Skotnicki\nBut that time week or two, we got to \u2014 to the headquarters. We came there. First thing I\nreported to him \u2014 to Moczar, that I caught three Germans and I had all the documents\nfrom there. I took away all the documents. I had their names and everything. Then one of\nthe Polish guys was, was something. I don't know what it was mad at me, jealous or what\nit is because he didn't want to give a rifle, something from there that we took away. And\nhe went over to, to Moczar and he told them that we killed innocent people, three guys,\nGermans. And Moczar said to me, \"What do you mean you killed three Germans? You\nhave no right to kill nobody.\u201d And he start screaming at me and all this, and I had already\n\u2014I was a officer already. I took off my \u2014 I was a lieutenant \u2014 he took off. He said, \"you're\ndismissed,\u201d and all this. And in a day after Chiel came back and all this, he start talking\nand he said, \"I have everything what I wanted to know.\u201d He gave me go back. He said to\nme not to do it no more because they have to have some kind of an army. It's not \u2014 you\ncannot do whatever you want.",
        "A: Killed.",
        "A: Our people. Three people. I know even exactly. I don't want to tell the names. Our\nfriends, they are today \u2014 one of them is in Florida, one is in Israel. Out right, yeah.",
        "A: We had a lot of fights with Germans. We were shooting to them and they shot at them. I\ndon't know if they were killed. I assumed that they were killed also. When they were\nshooting the rifle the bullet goes to, to them like they go to us. And they were all going\nfrom us open, they were not afraid Jews, they're not afraid. They go. And they were\nshooting back. I'm sure they were killed, but directly to shoot. You had only three guys\nwhen you shot \u2014 went into a train, but we didn't shot. The Pollacks shot them. But it's\ndifferent. It was our group that shot them, and then three were shot directly from us. We\nhad later on more, but this was till then. And we \u2014 I told you straight, us Jews we had\nonce affect, we had a guy what was a Pollack and he was with us, and he denounced us.\nHe was with us, fighting with us, going with us and he had a chance. He just disappeared\nfor a few minutes and he told somebody. He had contact where we were going and what\nwe are doing. And we, we found out very fast that he's doing this. When we find out that,\nthe man cannot live with us. Then who will kill him? Nobody wants to kill him. And they\ncame the Polish guys what I told you, they helped us out they were kids. They were kids,\nthat one Franek, he said, \u201cHere, you shoot the man like this.\u201d And he took out a pistol\nand he shot him. We didn't have the guts to shoot somehow. I was a military man, but\nstill directly to shoot in a fight it's different. Directly to shoot wasn\u2019t to easy. Okay now,\nwe went in a, in a village. The name was Bojki, and in Bojki we were staying two and a\nhalf months, in one spot. And there we formed a real army. We formed groups. You\nknow we made groups, small ones. Every one group had a leader and we made a military\nestablishment. And people were going out, out just to big farms we went out. We\ncollected cows and food, swine, whatever it is, whatever we needed for food, and we\nbrought it over, and we had a base. We was staying there. The Germans knew that we are\nthere. The Pollacks knew we are there. Nobody bothered us. We are staying there. We\nwent out every night, for trains or whatever you had to do. We walked away from there.\nAnd they were not doing nothing. In fact, they had on the woods \u2014 we were \u2014 not too far\nwas woods \u2014 was a sign, \"Here Partisans,\" and they shouldn't go in \u2014 individual Germans,\nor something like that.",
        "A: It was in *44 already. This was \u201844. The Germans had full hands on the fronts all over.\nWe knew what's going on. We had the leaders, from the group. You had \u2014 what's his\nname? Moczar. And what's their name? Bolek Alef and Zemsta came from all over\nRussia was helping \u2014 started to help already. And we were an army already. We knew\nthat we are not \u2014 we will not just give up and they knew that need a lot of military men to\ncope with us. They need airplanes. They need artillery. They cannot just come in just to\nfight with us right then. They knew that.",
        "A: We had a few hundred people. And then was a group of Russians there. Chorny\u2019\u2019,\nBiely(ph), a lot of Partisans were there in these woods there. A lot! Thousands already.\nAnd they \u2014 the Russians knew \u2014 the Germans knew that they are there, and they didn't\ncome. For a long, for a long time they didn't touch us. Then the front start coming near,\nand May First, came Rola Zymierski, to us. He was the leader of the whole army. He was\na general before the war, a very fine man, a older man. And he spoke to the whole\npopulation. He called over everybody and he spoke to them and he talked to them about\nthe partisans. It wasn't only Jews then. It was Pollacks, Russians, everybody. And he said,\n\"The Russian front is very near, and these days we will be taken over by the Russians and\nwe will take over Poland back again.\u201d Talked openly. He already was sure of himself.\nAnd then he came over to me and to Chiel Grynszpan, because Chiel and I worked\ntogether then. Jegier, by the way, before when we divided, was killed. In a skirmish with\nGermans, he was killed. And there was no more Jegier and I was with Chiel. I had my\ngroup. He had his group but we kept together. And what I want to say is\u2014\n37 Lieutenant Colonel Ivan \u201c\u201cChorny\u201d Banov",
        "A: The Germans?",
        "A: The front was moving very rapidly. It was almost we could hear, already, the katyushas*\u00ae\nthis, this, the\u2014",
        "A: Rockets. And we hear artillery. We can hear airplanes too. And almost every few days\nthe Russians came down to us and threw down ammunition, rifles, people. They came in\n\u2014 one group came in 70 people. We called them \u201cskoczki*\u2019.\u201d That means they jump \u2014\njumpers. They came in 70 people. Most of them were Jews, officers, trained in Russia or\nsomewhere, and they came to us. And women came over and now the story about ladies,\nwomen. Hanka was the only one women what I knew that she is around like this. And I\ndidn't know. When I came to Chiel, I find there a whole group of people, old, young,\nchildren. There were a few hundred hidden in a wood, in a very, very strange pieces of\nland there. It was water and you couldn't get there. No German, nobody could get there.\nAnd they pushed them there on this land, and they put them there. And then they were\nbring to them food, something once in awhile. Not too much. They were hungry. And\nwhen I came, she said to me, \"This is people what I know. They are almost from my\nvillages there. I know most of them people.\" Pollacks came over to me and they said they\nwill kill all of them if they wouldn't stop grabbing the chickens and the food in the night.\nAnd they didn't have what to eat, and they ran out in the night. They were going to the\nfarmer. And the farmers were ours, because we were standing \u2014 they knew us. We had a\nbase, and they came to Chiel and they told him \u2014 they said they will kill all the children\n38 Lorry mounted multiple rocket launcher (Russian)\n\u00b0 Jumpers (Polish)\nand women. Then he call over, \u201c\u201cMietek,\u201d he said, \u201cI cannot go to them people because\nwe have to do something. To kill somebody there or to do something.\u201d He said,\n\"Otherwise, they will kill all of us too. Not only them, but they will\u2014 Farmers you\ncannot stop because they are our bread and butter. We have to work with them.\u201d Then I\nwent there with three people. I remember Rabinowitz(ph), from Warsaw, guy on horse,\notherwise, you couldn't walk through there, water was there. You know, the horses went\nthrough everything. And I came to the place.\nI came to the place. I couldn't believe it. When I remind myself, I want to cry now. It was\nmy job. People naked, half naked. Ladies! Men! Children! Everybody, they had some\nkind of covers they had. They made. They built. Not on the ground. On top. And they\nwere cooking, making food, something for the family.. When I saw this group, I couldn't\n\u2014I couldn't believe. I see people. It's like from the old times. You see in the \u2014 from the\nhistory books. You see people like this. And in between I looked down and I see a\nwoman. She looks like my mother. Imagine! And here I came in this in to kill them. I\nhave to kill somebody or I have to do something. I see my mother there. I went over to\nher and I talked to her and I said, \"Where you come from?\" And I talked to others. And\nthen I put them together, and lined up and I said, \"Listen people. You want to live. You\nhave to behave. You have to do something else. You cannot just go to the farmers, rob\nthem. Wait for us. Organize something. There should be some organization because\notherwise, they will \u2014 you will perish and we will perish altogether. And they told me\nthat a few youngsters there what were really no good. They were robbing. I said, \"You\nthree will come with me.\u201d They, they had some mothers there. They had two sisters, and\nthey thought I'm going to kill them. And that was the, the, the order to kill them. And I\nsaid, \"Oh no, I will not kill nobody here. They depend on me absolutely. I'm not killing\nnobody.\u201d After going through a thing like this, and I took them away and I brought them\nover to the group, them three and they were very, very good soldiers there. One is still\ntoday my best friend. Whenever he sees me, he doesn't know what to do with me. All\nthree left with me and they are \u2014 they were with me. But the group \u2014 the women, it was at\na time the Pollacks still didn't give up. They have to be feeded. I said, \u201cThis is no good.\nWe have to take them away.\u201d And we brought the whole group, little by little, not in one\nshot, into the group, into the village there nobody should know. Not even the\nheadquarters didn't know, nobody didn't know. And we brought over \u2014 and every group \u2014\nwe had maybe a 100, 120 people there, and every group we took in one or two women\nand they were cooking for us because we were standing in one place. They were cooking,\nthey were washing. We had shirts to wash or something. Then the women start working\nfor us and they were doing group \u2014 some of them were very brave, and they said, \"What\ndo you mean washing this? We want to have a rifle too.\u201d And have a Dora and another\none there, Roska, and this, and they, they picked up rifles. They put on rifles and they\nwent out to work with us, the women you know, after a time that everything calmed\ndown.",
        "A: They did \u2014 were very, very, very good because they have a group had to \u2014 then they had\n\u2014 they had to behave. You know they were soldiers. Everybody was a soldier. Hanka had\nthe worse time she had than everybody else. She came from Warsaw. She came \u2014 she was\na very, very delicate women \u2014 she was from a good home. She had maids home, and she\ndidn't know what to do with herself. Others were from farms, from villages. They, they,\nthey coped. They knew how to cook. They knew how to do something for us, and some\nof them baked for us. We had a good time. But she, she was lost. Completely lost! She\ncouldn't \u2014 she was \u2014 it was so dirty here. She, she couldn't \u2014 she didn't keep herself good.\nI had a very, very hard time with her really to keep her alive and to keep her around\nthere. Also, she was very small and beautiful. She was a beautiful women, with dark hair.\nShe was very, very nice. I liked her very much, and she liked me. But I couldn't even\ncome near her. She was so \u2014 I knew she was dirty, and after a time she was assigned to\nwatch for a guy what was wounded in a fight. She, she went away from me, and she was\nstaying with this guy until the war ended. I didn't see her no more. But before we divided\ntwo the groups divided to. What happened. When Rola Zymierski came First of May, and\ntold us that near \u2014 the front is near. He said, \"You have to disappear from this terrain,\nfrom this land. We have to go deeper and fight other Germans, deeper, deeper to the\nWeichsel to go deeper into the country, to the west. The Bug was east, and we have to go\nto the west. Then I remember I went, \u201cChiel,\u201d I said, \u201cListen, what shall we do?\" I was\nafraid of these Pollacks there on the other side. They were not too friendly to us, and here\nwe had no freedom. We were staying in one place for so many months. We knew the\npeople already, and they knew us. We lived. Then I said, \"Maybe we shouldn't go.\u201d And\nChiel said the same thing, \"I know the people here, they knew me.\u201d They know Chiel.\nBig shot he came with his horse. They all \u2014 they, they respect. And he liked to drink, he\nliked women. He was a good leader, you know, a real one, a partisan. I was more the\nintelligent type you know. It was \u2014 when they needed something, they came to me, and I\nhave \u2014 I took care of everything. But he was a soldier. And I said, \"We will not go.\u201d And\nI went over to Rola Zymierski and I said, \"You're going away, and this piece of land\nstays empty. Nobody from, from the partisans, nobody will be here. Let us be the guard.\nWhen the Russian front come near, we will go come \u2014 we will go back. But in the\nmeantime, we will need 100 people here just to cover your retreat when you go back to\nthem.\u201d\nHe said, \"It's a idea. Stay.\u201d\u201d And we remained here, and I remained there with 100 people\nwe remained on the site of the Wieprz \u2014 between the Wieprz and the Bug. And they went\n\u2014 the Wieprz, they went through, and they went to the terrain where I was before.\nGarbow, Lubartow, and other towns there. It didn't take too long. The Pollacks, the A.K.,\nthey came over to me, and he said, \"You want to live. You want to live the group \u2014 a\ngroup nice there. You have to belong to us. You have to get with us together and work\ntogether. You cannot be on your own because everybody left \u2014 not you, not the Russians,\nnot the Pollacks, everybody already. Only here you are, you are group. You have to\nbelong to us.\u201d I said, \"Oh, oh, this is, this is death.\u201d Meantime \u2014 the same time\nBaranovskiy *\u00b0 a general from Russia came down with airplanes, and the whole group of\nreal army. I'm telling you soldiers one by one. They were really equipped. Everything\ntoo. And this Baranovskiy we found out through channels he's a Jew too, but he didn't\ngive it up. He didn't. He never said that he's a Jew. And after a few days, we said, \u201cWhat\ndo we have to do the A.K.?\u201d We said, \u201cWe will go over to Baranovskiy and want to meet\nhim. They say he came over on the terrain there.\u201d And we went to help him and how he\ncan help us. We came over to him. He had a wife with him, and he had a pirate, a pirate,\nthat\u2019s a pir\u2014 that is a big bird, and he had caviar and he took us in like a \u2014 and it was\nsomething else. We were dressed military dressed, very nice \u2014 I think was good looking\nthen \u2014 and he start talking to me right way in Russia because I understood Russia, the\nPolish Russia. And he said, \"What you, what you have to go by yourselves?\u201d He\nproposed us until I\u2014 we didn't even say nothing. He said, \"Come to me. Come to us. We\nwill form one group. We have a few hundred people and you be there. I see you are\nsoldiers. You are in that group. You come to us.\u201d And that's what we were waiting for.\nAnd we came, the whole group came to Baranovskiy. And when we came to\nBaranovskiy, he took us in, he divided with us right away. \u201cNo more Jews,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou cannot be Jews. By a group you have to be separate. Every group, Russian, Polish,\nUkrainian, whatever it is. You cannot be Jews by themselves. This is our policy. And this\nis it. You can do that otherwise. Whatever you want, you have to be divided.\u201d In the\nmeantime, he made me \u2014 and he made a group in Russian \u2014 Russian kept separate, and he\nmade from Polish people, A.L. he called them. The are Armia Ludowa. He made a group,\nand I was \u2014 he made me the leader. From Pollacks and from Jews and I was the leader of\nthem. Not Chiel, Chiel stayed.\nThen one night he calls me, Chiel, he calls out, \"Listen you two. I want you to leave. I am\nsending you to Moscow, you two.\u201d I said, \"What do you mean? we'll leave the people,\" I\nsaid. \"Never mind, you two. I have very important papers. I have to send them over.\u201d\n\u201cHow you will do?\u201d \u201cI make a conference from all officers, Russian, Polish, anyone, and\nwhen I will say I have a mission and I need volunteers. Then you two get up fast because\nyou knew already what to do. You get up, you two. When you are up that's it. I have to\nsend you two.\u201d And we came to the meeting and sat and meantime at the meeting, there\ncame a guy from Warsaw ghetto. He run away. He was a politician. He was \u2014 I think he\nwas a communist, something like that. He was the political figure there. He said, \"I'm\ngoing, too, at this meeting.\u201d He goes to the meeting too. And he knows about us that have\nto get up and we're together and we sit three of us together and all of sudden, this General\nBaranovskiy says, \"I have to send out some people with papers and all this. Who\nvolunteers?\" Well, he gets up the first, Rubinstein*! he and Chiel after him, and I\nremained. Only two. And I remained there.\n\u201c\u00a9 General Semyon Baranovskiy\n\u201c! Dudkin Rubenstein",
        "A: Yeah. That's what will come.",
        "A: That's it. Then, then I remained myself here with Chiel away and they had very important\npapers and then they went together to the border to the river that they have to cross.\nThere's a Pollack what knows where to cross, and he is the first one. He walks them into\nthe river. He fells into the river. After him goes Rubinstein. The \u2014 Politruk, they called.\nHe walks in. He fell in the water. And Rubinstein made a \u201cgevalt*\u2019,\u201d starts screaming. He\nfell in the water with the uniform whatever, and he start screaming and the water was\nhigh over him and the Germans were not too far and they start shooting him already. We\nhad to retreat completely. We came back. And this day when he retreated we had a big,\nbig fight. The biggest one in the partisans. We had there one of the partisans. If the\nGermans find out that Baranovskiy is there, the group, he lives openly, you know they\nfind out, they came with artillery. Like I said they didn't come from soldier. They came\nartillery, airplanes and \u2014 what's the name? And the tanks and all this came over.",
        "A: Big, big battle. Big battle! And the same day the other group what went the other side to\nmy end was a part of my group too went to show the way there because was \u2014 what was\nthe names? What was his name? Morel, Zelazny, Bleichman \u2014 you will hear a lot because\nhe will I think he will be also there. And they \u2014 he went back with this group, and they\nhad the biggest fight also in the war. Because the Germans want to clean up the partisans.\nThey knew what's going on. The knew that the army's coming back. When the army\ncomes back, they will hinder us whatever. They were afraid. Then they had a order to\nclean us up.",
        "A: And they had a very big fight there. Bigger than ours, maybe, with this and they had a lot\nof people. A lot of people! But in the night, they disappeared.",
        "A: No, the Germans was staying there, but our people disappeared in the night. Most of\nthem came back to us. They had our base already. They came back to us. And our fight\nwith Wola Wereszczynska we went into the woods. And I don't think somebody was\nkilled. I know one airplane was shot down. I know a few Germans were killed right what\nI saw in the, in the fight because we went into the woods and he was standing there.\nThere was a very big flash was in front of me. I was behind a, a tree, a big one, and there\n\u201c2 Emergency (Yiddish); a cry for help.\nwas some water there in the front of this. All of sudden, a splash there in front of this.\nArtillery hit there, and it didn't, it didn't explode. And then Baranovsk1y was not too far. I\nsaid to him, \"Look here, I almost got killed.\u201d He said, \"Jews don't get killed. You are a\nJew.\" Just like that. He made a joke.",
        "A: I went through scot-free. After this, it took a few days, a few days after, the Russians start\ncoming. Started coming. It was the worst part in our life cause the Germans were all over\nbecause they came from the front. And there was tanks and the small vehicles and all\nover the field all over. We didn't have where to hide. We didn't have where to hide. It's\nimpossible. Then I don't know, we had no choice. It was some kind of a wooden area,\nsmall woods, small woods and we went into this. Lucky we didn't go into the fields\nbecause they went through the fields. The Germans went through the fields. And we\nwere, were there in this, and we laid down still sitting there. I remember one of the\nwomen got up and she had a red, and red this \u2014 a handkerchief or something like that she\nripped it off her head and I pushed her down. And we were laid down, that the Germans\ncame with airplanes with all this, we were laying there. Somehow, they had their minds\nwith something else, and they went through us.",
        "A: The Russians came in, and we were like an organized group, it came in a Pollack with a\nbeard \u2014 he looked like Messiah. He came over to us, he said, \u201cWhat are you doing here in\nthe woods? You know the Russians are here in this village. Right next to you, in this\nvillage the Russians are here.\u201d Said, \u201cWhat?\u201d Said, \u201cCome with me.\u201d And we start\nwalking with \u2014 marching a group, like soldiers, you know. We going \u2014 we\u2019re proud. All\nof a sudden the Russians start shooting. The Russians, on us! Because they knew \u2014 didn\u2019t\nknow who this 1s. They thought it\u2019s Germans. A column of people going?!? And we laid\ndown and we sent out two or three guys with white \u2014 this handkerchiefs and all this. And\nthey went over to them and they told them it is a group of partisans and this, and they\nsaid, \u201cJews on top of this, what?\u201d Here this \u2014 a Russian general came over, a Jew. And\nthen another officer, a Jew. There\u2019s a lot of Jewish officers there, between the Russians.\nAnd they were happy to see us, and they hugged us. And they said, \u201cBut we have no\ntime. We are at war to go. There is a place, there, not too far, what the SS staying and we\nhave a big fight with them. You stay here and then you \u2014 we took over Lublin already.\nWe took over Lubartow and all other towns are taken over already from us. And you go\nback and you are free.\u201d\u2019 And this free was, was very, very sad, very sad. Then we start\nfeeling how alone we are. Everybody start looking for family. Everybody start looking\nfor, for somebody to, to, to share his problems, share this. I couldn\u2019t \u2014 with my family I\nwas cut off, I didn\u2019t know what happen there. Then it takes \u2014 took time a little bit, they\nstart coming from the other side, they told me that my family was killed, all of them in\none day, they took them out, they killed everybody. My brother was killed in a, in a\ncamp. And everybody, what remained there, from, from millions of millions of people,\nremained 150,000 people remained in Poland.

I had a very big job in Poland too, they gave me a job right\naway, and I registering all the Jews, everybody what lived through, came to me and they\nregistered their child and this. And I found what is going on, how many people and where\nthey lived\u2014\n[Conclusion of interview]\n3 Dr. Emil Sommerstein\n"
