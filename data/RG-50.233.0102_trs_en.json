        "Q: We are interviewing Mrs. Polak about her parents. Let\u2019s start with your father. Would you tell\nme your father\u2019s full name and his date of birth and where he was born, and anything you might\nknow about his family.",
        "A: My father\u2019s name was Abraham Soep, the Dutch word for soup, which was not a nice name to\ngo out with as a child, as you can imagine. He was born on April 17, 1892.",
        "Q: Anything else? Do you know anything about his childhood, about his family?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know too much about his childhood. I know that his mother was very young when she\nmarried. His father started a diamond factory which was built, I guess with money from his\nfather. Before that as far as I know, they were cigar makers. They were out of poor Ashkenazi\nbackground. But the diamond factory was a success and they became well to do later. My\ngrandmother I remember very well. She was a very wise person but very uneducated. She had\nan inner wisdom but she didn\u2019t know much about anything. My grandfather died when I was\nfour so I don\u2019t remember him too well. I think he was quite a bit more intelligent. My father\nwas the oldest. He was born ten years after his parents were married. They couldn\u2019t have\nchildren. They adopted or took in a niece, a sister of my grandfather had one child after the\nother and did not know how to take care of them, so they took one of those children as a child,\nwho I consider my aunt and my father who was born after ten years of marriage after the\nadoption, considered her his sister. She was quite a bit older. Then they had four other children\nwho all died before age one for different reasons. One had diphtheria, another was dropped by\nsomebody else and horrible stories that never really was talked about because in those days a lot\nof people lost a lot of children. And then my uncle was born who was ten years younger than\nmy father. His name was Hans Soep and he was a very sickly child. They thought they were\ngoing to lose him, but they didn\u2019t. Where my father was this tall, broad heavy person. My uncle\nwas the opposite. He was small and very small boned and small build. They got along well.\nMy uncle looked up to my father a lot and really was always a little bit in the shadow. He went\ninto business, after schooling he went into business with my father, as a partner, or a junior\npartner. My father had three years of high school, which at that time was really quite a bit. It\nwas an official three-year course high school and after he finished he went into business with\nhis father. His father died at the age of 64 and his mother died in the beginning of the war in\n1942, I think. What else do you want to know about them?",
        "Q: I think we have most of the story.\nA My mother was from a family of six children. She was born on December 8, 1895, her name is\nToni Fredrika Kauffman was her maiden name. Everybody called her Toni. She came from a\nvery liberal family. My father came from an orthodox family, but when he married my father,\nshe became a dutiful kosher housewife and later on took an interest in Hebrew. She took\nHebrew lessons conversation lessons to learn the language. Her parents were German but they\nhad moved to Holland in the 1880\u2019s and the six children were all born in Holland. The oldest\none, I think, in \u201987, and there was a span of twenty years between the oldest and the youngest.\nOne of my aunts is still alive and lives in Israel, the youngest one who 1s going to be 85 1n May.\nAnd we are all going to Israel, all the nieces and nephews that are still there for a reunion.. She\nwas a dutiful housewife, it was a very good marriage, but my father was a very dominant\nperson, not of many words but his whole being was a little authoritarian. But my mother was\nperfectly happy in her role and not until after he died, which was in 1953, and she lived until\n1980, not until a few years after he died did she become her own person and showed a lot more\npersonality and initiative and everything than I had ever seen before. We were on very good\nterms all the time.",
        "Q: How was she as a mother when you were growing up?",
        "A: Well, when we were growing up she was, you know, like a mother should be. Very nurturing,\nbut we lived in a fairly big house and we had two maids and one of them was more or less what\nthey call a \u201ckinder fraulein.\u201d They all came from Germany. They took care of the children.\nAnd there was a cleaning woman and there was a seamstress. There were a lot of people to take\ncare of us. My father traveled a lot because in the diamond business he went every other week\nto Belgium to sell. Once a month to England, to London, to buy. He was on lots of\ncommittees, so my mother was often alone with us. But she was kind of a, she doesn\u2019t stand\nout in my mind as a child. I always used to say as a child, I\u2019m not being brought up I\u2019m just\ngrowing up by myself. I felt kind of independent, I guess, from my young years on. But not\nrealizing it I probably wasn\u2019t, but 1t seemed that way. But she was very sweet. Everybody\nloved her. She was a real lady. She looked like a lady, and she was cultured. She came from a\ncultured background than my father. She was fond of music, she played the piano quite nicely.\nShe spoke beautifully French. My father took an interest later in music and became very\nmusically inclined. I think he played the violin when he was a young boy so there must have\nbeen something there already. They traveled quite a bit without us, which we resented when we\nwere children. When we used to complain, my mother used to say in a German expression\nwhich her mother used to say to her, you just travel with your own husband. That\u2019s about all I\ncan say about my mother from the early years. About my sister, she 1s still alive.",
        "Q: In that case, I need to talk to her.",
        "A: Do it yourself. She has lots and lots of problems. I don\u2019t think they relate to the war. She\u2019s\nbeen a problem her whole life. She doesn\u2019t have a very happy present life. She lives in Los\nAngeles. She\u2019s a very strong, determined person, but it\u2019s lots of problems.",
        "Q: Can we go on a talk about these two friends?",
        "A: Yes, let\u2019s talk about these two friends. One of them Rudi Acohen who was really my boyfriend.\nI met him when he was 13 and I was 12. We lived next to each other during the summer at the\nsummer resort. Our parents had rented homes.",
        "Q: What was the name of that resort?",
        "A: Zandvoort and it\u2019s very close to Amsterdam. My father commuted every day from business by\ncar, because the chauffeur came and picked him up and brought him. That\u2019s what was done in\nthose days. He also went to Montessori High School, but a different one from mine, and I\nremember hearing his name when in June \u201935 we went to visit our Montessori High School for\nthe first time just for orientation and everybody\u2019s name was mentioned. I thought what a strange\nname this boy has. And then we went a few weeks later to Zandvoort and who lives next door,\nthe boy with the strange name, and we were very crazy about each other, even when that young,\nand you know, like children are we played together. We played ball, we went to the dunes, we\nwent swimming and then he was in my class for several years and then he was transferred to\nanother school. He wasn\u2019t entirely a good student and couldn\u2019t stay in our school. But I stayed\nvery friendly with him. Actually \u2018til he was arrested also in a raid. Again a reprisal raid in July\n\u201942, just before the deportation started. Also a German soldier had been killed and they emptied\nthat whole street of all the Jews. One very long street, very nice residential street, went in every\nhome where there were Jews and arrested them.",
        "Q: Do you know what year Rudi was born?",
        "A: Yes. His birthday was June 4, and he was born in 1922.",
        "Q: Did he have any other interests, did he have musical interests?",
        "A: No. He also played tennis and he played the violin, he had violin lessons. He liked popular\nmusic, records.",
        "Q: Do you remember any in particular, or anything like that?",
        "A: Well, we listened a lot to French songs, like Charles Trunet (?) You probably don\u2019t even know\nthat name. He was very popular then, and also Austrian songs like Marta Keller, I think that\nwas her name. No, that was not her name. We listened to American songs. Frank Sinatra was\nbig. We played a lot of classical records. We had an old fashioned player. For his Bar Mitzvah\nhe got a record player, you know, that you turned a handle to play, and we played a lot of\nclassical music. What else? I don\u2019t know. We did what young people do. We went on trips,\nbike trips and stuff like that. He was caught in one of those raids and that was the end of him.\nThe day after he was arrested, he was sent on o Auschwitz or wherever. I never heard from\nhim. With his parents and his brother. I even went in a day or two after because I worked for\nthe Jewish Council in that department that was called Aids to Departing People and I was able\nto send some stuff to Westerbork because most people stayed. But later on I heard they weren\u2019t\neven there. And, of course, he never came back. And I didn\u2019t know that at the time during all\nthose years, all of the sudden he might be back. He was young and everything, of course we\nrealized that he probably didn\u2019t live three days afterwards.",
        "Q: What month was that?",
        "A: It was June 1942 and it was just after his birthday. It was a Sunday. And I am trying to look\nback, his birthday was on June 4, 1942 and whatever the Sunday was after that; I think it was\nJune 9\"\", it was that date. He had just turned 20. He had a younger brother who was very, very\nbright and very, very musical, was about three or four years younger than him. Of course, he\nwent, his parents, everybody. And then, after that I had some sort of a boyfriend, his name was\nHans Rudelshim, and he was born in Kampen, which was near , . I\ndon\u2019t know when his birthday was. He was very interesting. He went into hiding a lot. His\nfather was a tailor, and he was a good tailor too. AS a matter of fact he remodeled some sports\nclothes of my father for my sister and me into skirts and little top and he was also a very gifted\npianist and he took some piano lessons from a blind Hungarian pianist who lived in Holland.\nWas also caught in Holland and who used to practice when he couldn\u2019t play concerts anymore.\nHe used to give house concerts of the piano and he practiced at my parents\u2019 house. We had a\ngrand piano. And he got to know this friend of mine and he taught and gave him lessons",
        "Q: Do you know what year Hans was born?",
        "A: I think probably also in 1922, it may have been \u201921. He may have been a year older, and he had\nto leave Kampen , like all the people from the Provinces were sent. He looked very\nJewish. He dyed his hair blond and went into hiding and did all kinds of reckless things,\ntraveled and went everywhere. And, of course, they were betrayed.",
        "Q: Do you know when that was?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know exactly when that was. We were still in our house and we left there in May \u201943, so\nit must have been February or March \u201943. I don\u2019t know what happened to him. Never heard a\nword. He was sent away. And then this other picture here is of a young man named Gideon, we\ncalled him in Dutch, it\u2019s called \u201cChideon\u2019\u201d\u2019, and we called him \u201cChi.\u201d He was from a very\nprominent Dutch gentile family. They were originally Huguenots, therefore the French name.\nWe were very good friends. We were in the same grade. He was a very good friend of my\nboyfriend, Rudi . In the very beginning I hear of the Dutch National Socialist Movement in the\nearly \u201830\u2019s, a lot of people became members of this Nazi group. Even Jews, because they\nthought, you know, it was a good system and very orderly and everything. Before we knew all\nthe stuff that was going to happen, but his family eventually, of course, totally abandoned this\nand they were very, very good and had many Jewish friends. He went into the Resistance and\nhid Jews. His father was sent away and died in, I think it was Buchenwald or Dachau, one of\nthe two. His mother was in Ravensbruck, survived, came back a wreck and lived for quite a\nfew years as a wreck, and never really got over all of this.",
        "Q: Can you tell us anything about either Gideon or Hans, or both, and Rudi, what were they like?\nWhat was their personalities like?",
        "A: Well, you know when you grow up together as children you don\u2019t delve that much in the\npersonalities or whatever. He was just also not the greatest of students, but a very sweet guy\nand fun. We had a lot of fun together. We were young, we had parties. We organized our own\nparties. We decided whether we would go formal to this party or should we go another way.\nEverybody brought their best records and we played and we danced. We had very happy\nteenage years. It was mostly for fun. Although I do remember though once we were in high\nschool that we had very deep conversation subject about the incarnation or vivisection, you\nknow, experiments on animals. Who was for and who was against. You know, like teenagers\nwho go to a decent school do. But it was mostly just friends together all the time. I spent really\nall my years in high school with my friends rather than with my family. We did our homework,\nbut it had to be done quick because then we would get together and play records and talk and\nhave fun. Of course girls were involved. He had a girlfriend too.",
        "Q: Hans, how did he fit in with the circle?",
        "A: No, Hans really didn\u2019t move to Amsterdam until the war was already on, and his uncle was a\nphysician in Amsterdam and they were the best friends of Rudi\u2019s parents. So I knew him really\nthrough Rudi. And then Rudi was deported, you know, he went after me, because he liked me\nfrom the beginning. So somehow that\u2019s how all these people fit in. I mean these are just three\nof them. I showed you a little tennis picture, there were several more we were always together\nwith. These were really after school friends.",
        "Q: What was Rudi like?",
        "A: Rudi was a very nice down to earth, rather simple kind of guy, I think. You don\u2019t know. I\nsometimes wonder what would he have been or become. He was as I said he didn\u2019t have very\ngood head for learning, but his father was a stockbroker and I think he could have become that\ntoo. He was interested in business and everything. But there wasn\u2019t much time for\ndevelopment yet. You know, we were both 16 when the war broke out in Europe and 17 when\nHolland was invaded. We were kids. I mean even today 16 and 17 years old, and they are\nmuch more sophisticated than we were, but even they are little kids, while they know more of\nwhat goes on in the world, you know, with television. We didn\u2019t have television, of course. We\ndidn\u2019t have a radio in the house until I was 14. If I wanted to hear children\u2019s programs on the\nradio, I walked 25 minutes to my grandmother\u2019s every Tuesday afternoon to hear children\u2019s\nprograms. We were not really spoiled kids. It wasn\u2019t that much.",
        "Q: Is there anything else? I know I\u2019ve picked your brain and put you through the wringer. Is there\nanything else you would like to add?",
        "A: There\u2019s probably a million things I can add, you have to stop somewhere.",
        "Q: Thank you very, very much.",
        "A: You\u2019re very welcome.\n"

        "A: I don\u2019t know exactly when that was. We were still in our house and we left there in May \u201943, so\nit must have been February or March \u201943. I don\u2019t know what happened to him. Never heard a\nword. He was sent away. And then this other picture here is of a young man named Gideon, we\ncalled him in Dutch, it\u2019s called \u201cChideon\u2019\u201d\u2019, and we called him \u201cChi.\u201d He was from a very\nprominent Dutch gentile family. They were originally Huguenots, therefore the French name.\nWe were very good friends. We were in the same grade. He was a very good friend of my\nboyfriend, Rudi . In the very beginning I hear of the Dutch National Socialist Movement in the\nearly \u201830\u2019s, a lot of people became members of this Nazi group. Even Jews, because they\nthought, you know, it was a good system and very orderly and everything. Before we knew all\nthe stuff that was going to happen, but his family eventually, of course, totally abandoned this\nand they were very, very good and had many Jewish friends. He went into the Resistance and\nhid Jews. His father was sent away and died in, I think it was Buchenwald or Dachau, one of\nthe two. His mother was in Ravensbruck, survived, came back a wreck and lived for quite a\nfew years as a wreck, and never really got over all of this.",
        "A: Well, you know when you grow up together as children you don\u2019t delve that much in the\npersonalities or whatever. He was just also not the greatest of students, but a very sweet guy\nand fun. We had a lot of fun together. We were young, we had parties. We organized our own\nparties. We decided whether we would go formal to this party or should we go another way.\nEverybody brought their best records and we played and we danced. We had very happy\nteenage years. It was mostly for fun. Although I do remember though once we were in high\nschool that we had very deep conversation subject about the incarnation or vivisection, you\nknow, experiments on animals. Who was for and who was against. You know, like teenagers\nwho go to a decent school do. But it was mostly just friends together all the time. I spent really\nall my years in high school with my friends rather than with my family. We did our homework,\nbut it had to be done quick because then we would get together and play records and talk and\nhave fun. Of course girls were involved. He had a girlfriend too.",
        "A: No, Hans really didn\u2019t move to Amsterdam until the war was already on, and his uncle was a\nphysician in Amsterdam and they were the best friends of Rudi\u2019s parents. So I knew him really\nthrough Rudi. And then Rudi was deported, you know, he went after me, because he liked me\nfrom the beginning. So somehow that\u2019s how all these people fit in. I mean these are just three\nof them. I showed you a little tennis picture, there were several more we were always together\nwith. These were really after school friends.",
        "A: Rudi was a very nice down to earth, rather simple kind of guy, I think. You don\u2019t know. I\nsometimes wonder what would he have been or become. He was as I said he didn\u2019t have very\ngood head for learning, but his father was a stockbroker and I think he could have become that\ntoo. He was interested in business and everything. But there wasn\u2019t much time for\ndevelopment yet. You know, we were both 16 when the war broke out in Europe and 17 when\nHolland was invaded. We were kids. I mean even today 16 and 17 years old, and they are\nmuch more sophisticated than we were, but even they are little kids, while they know more of\nwhat goes on in the world, you know, with television. We didn\u2019t have television, of course. We\ndidn\u2019t have a radio in the house until I was 14. If I wanted to hear children\u2019s programs on the\nradio, I walked 25 minutes to my grandmother\u2019s every Tuesday afternoon to hear children\u2019s\nprograms. We were not really spoiled kids. It wasn\u2019t that much.",
        "A: There\u2019s probably a million things I can add, you have to stop somewhere.",
        "A: You\u2019re very welcome.\n"
