        "Question: ... get you to state your name and where you were born .",
        "Answer: Okay, Mel London, I was born in New York, I was born in the Bronx, as we used to say, in\nCharlotte Street, which is the famous area that Ronald Reagan stood in and said he was going to\nbring back and never did. I was born in 1923. At this point in 1996, I'll be 73 in August. My\nfather, excuse me, my father and mother were both immigrants, my father was born in Russia,\nactually in Lithuania and came over to the United States when he was 11 years old. He supported\nthe family, they lived on Rivington(ph) Street in the lower east side, he supported the family by\nbeing a professional boxer, something I never knew about until I was older and boxed at college and\nmy father taught me everything I knew and he never bothered to tell me that he had been a\nprofessional boxer until I read about it in a column one time and found out that he was pretty good,\nwhich is why he always was better than I when he taught me to box. He then went into the dress\nbusiness and for the rest of his life, until he was 83 and then retired and had to, because of health, he\nwas in the dress business. My mother was born in England and came over as an infant. So they\nreally came from a, an immigrant, both came from immigrant families. My father's background\nthough, was something that we were never able to really trace back, we don't know why we have\nthe name London, which of course was a taken name, in that coming from Lithuania there was\nanother name, but his mother, being far ahead of her time, ran away from her husband and ran away\nwith a lover. Now, for this happening at the beginning of the century, you realize is quite a rare\noccurrence and so the name was picked up somewhere and nobody ever knew where. I was brought\nup in the Bronx, I went to school in the Bronx, I went to city college and was interrupted by a war. I\nenlisted in the army in September of 1942 and was discharged in the summer, I think it was in\nAugust of 1946. So I spent four years in the army.",
        "Q: If you can, talk a little bit about before the war actually interrupted your studies, what were you\nhearing about what was going on in Europe and how was it a part of your consciousness?",
        "A: Well I can actually remember the day that war was declared in September of 1939. We were still\nin the country, the family was just able, my father was just able to send the family away to the\ncountry so the kids shouldn't have to put up with the city and I can actually remember the, the war\nstarting. At that time I was 16 years old, so that there was a consciousness of a teenager. As with\nmost of the people here at that time, as I recall it, it was a distant thing, we knew the war was going\non, I mean, you, we heard about the bombings, we knew the war was going on, we knew that the\nrefugees were coming here or starting to come here, but very frankly knew very little about the\nnuances of it, we knew very little about the ships that were turned away, the one that went to\nHavana and was turned away. This came later. If I speak of it now, it's because of something that\nI'd read about, but at the time it was a war that was in Europe, you know, the war's in Europe again\nand I guess, particularly at 16 and being involved in track and girls and things like that, I really\nthought very little about the war. We followed it, you couldn't help but follow it, 1t was in the\nheadlines all the time. So we knew about the Magino(ph) line, we knew about the problems of the\nbombings of England and so on and until America entered the war, for us 1t was happening in\nanother place. We were not, at the time, as knowledgeable as we are now about what was\nhappening in the concentration camps and with the Jews. We knew of course, about Kristallnacht,\nwe knew about Hitler. In fact I remember as a child, listening to Hitler, I remember that they\nbroadcast here, in the United States, they broadcast some of the speeches and I remember, whether\nit was from Nuremberg or some other place, the absolute electricity of this man when he spoke and\nI must say I hear the patterns with some of the people we have around the United States now, you\ncan actually hear the patterns, you can hear if you've studied the patterns and the things they were\nsaid, without getting into the politics of the United States, you could begin to hear how he enthralled\nthe people. Later on I was to see Nuremberg, later on I was to see the stadium, later on I was to see\nthe films of all of these, these rallies, but we actually remember them and I can remember to this\nday, sitting in the little foyer that we had in an apartment in the Bronx and listening to this man.",
        "Q: Any other memories about that, perhaps that your father might have had or your mother? Your\nfather might have still had family in Russia or any concern there might have been in the family for\nJews in general or specific people that you knew?",
        "A: Well I think, without being religious Jews, we all, always did have and still do have a feeling of\nbeing Jewish. My father did not have family there. Yeah. So that we have always felt a very deep\nfeeling of Judaism without being religious Jews. My father did speak of other pogroms. He was\nbrought up in area where the Cossacks were very, very active and her remembers the raids in the\nlittle town of Puniaman(ph). I found out much later in life that I was one thirty-second Cossack,\nwhich was something that destroyed my brother when he heard it. We don't know where the great,\ngreat, great, great grandfather was the rapist or whatever it may have been, but we were one thirty-\nsecond Cossack. In terms of Europe, from 1933 say, until the war began and I was much more\ninvolved certainly, in listening, we really had very, as I recall, very little discussion about it. And\nthat may have been very normal in the family, I just don't remember very much.",
        "Q: You enlisted, why did you, what were your reasons? Do you remember speaking to your family\nabout it?",
        "A: Oh yeah. I, as a matter of fact I enlisted because, there was a war, they were beginning to draft\npeople, my father had spent, I guess a year and a half or so in World War | as an infantryman. He\nwas wounded three times. The third time he was wounded they wanted to take his leg off because\nof gangrene. And that's an interesting story in that he then refused to sign the paper. And he\nwouldn't sign the paper and the gangrene receded. He said, \"I came into this world with two legs,\nI'm going out with two legs.\" The gangrene receded. My father, from 1918, never went to a doctor,\nuntil he was 83 years old and hurt himself working in the dress business, a bolt of cloth had fallen\non his wrist and I made him go to the doctor and the doctor said, \"Well Mr. London, when was the\nlast time you visited a doctor?\" He said, \"1918.\" And the doctor said, \"Well, you're none the worse\nfor it.\" My father said to me, \"Don't ever get in the infantry. Do anything to get out of the infantry.\"\nAnd he had gone through three wounds and the trenches and of course, as every soldier he only told\nfunny stories about how his mother sent potato pancakes overseas, you know and they arrived like\nrocks, but he never told about the terror and the horror of it, but he did communicate to me that it\nwas pretty awful. And so I enlisted in, I actually enlisted in the enlisted reserve in May of '43 and\nwas in the signal corps, I enlisted in the signal corps. And that probably, that and also getting\npneumonia when my unit went overseas to go to D-Day, saved my life, I was in the hospital with\npneumonia, so. But that was the basic reason I enlisted was I knew I would be drafted, but I thought\nI might just as well enlist and get some kind of a background and that signal corps background in\nfact, was the thing that created a career for me later on. So I enlisted and I went to, into the army\nwhere several things happened. One, to make me understand more about anti-Semitism, because in\nthe Bronx particularly and I left the Bronx at 17 and pretty much at 19 I enlisted. In the Bronx you\ngot very little of it, the Bronx was very heavily Jewish. I was now coming into the United States\narmy, a democracy of sorts, or fighting for a democracy, where I began to come into anti-Semitism\nin both it's subtle and it's overt forms. It was obvious if you were going to be in the army you were\ngoing to get it. I mean the anti-Semitic jokes that suddenly started to be told around me while\nsomeone turned and says, \"Well, I don't mean you, I don't consider you Jewish,\" when after all, I am\nJewish, is one thing. The second thing was that I, after two years, went to OCS. I had gone all the\nway from...",
        "Q: What's OCS?",
        "A: Officer Candidate School. I had gone from private to PFC and then they busted me back to\nprivate because they didn't have enough room for a PFC you see and I decided I was going nowhere\nafter two years. Luckily I was teaching in school, I was teaching at officer, at officer school as a\nprivate and a PFC, I was teaching colonels and generals and like an idiot I kept volunteering to go\noverseas with them. I wanted to go to New Guinea, I wanted to go to Europe and nobody would let\nme go, I was one of eight people who had a top secret clearance with the United States army,\nteaching this course, so nobody would let me go. I finally decided the only way to get out of this\nwould be to go into Officer Candidate School. So I applied for Officer Candidate School and again\n, In speaking of the, the anti-Semitism in the army, I was in a company, I was first sergeant in a\ncompany of 250 officer candidates. There were 13 Jews and two blacks and I, as first sergeant, was\nallowed to pick my roommate. You see, the barracks were made up and if you've seen barracks,\nthey were made up of 60 beds, double decker and one squad room. The squad room was where\nthere were two beds and the first sergeant and one other non-commissioned officer would be in the\nsquad room, so you had a private room. And so I had to become very friendly with a man from\nWashington D. C. named Bob MacNeil(ph), who happened to be one of the two blacks and having\nbeen brought up on the Bronx, I mean I was on a track team with all kinds of people, it made no\ndifference to me and he was the only guy who seemed to understand inner city thinking and was\ngetting the same kind of battering from the others that I was getting, so in front of a company of 250\nmen, the man was Lieutenant Coyne(ph), Lieutenant Coyne(ph) said, \"Mr. London,\" I said, \"Yes,\nsir.\" He said, \"As first sergeant you can choose anyone you like to spend the next three months in\nthe squad room with you\" and I said, \"Mr. MacNeil(ph) sir,\" so in front of 250 men, I picked one of\nthe two blacks, in 1943 or '44. This was pretty much unheard of. Two things happened, several\nthings happened. Number one, the day before graduation, 12 of the 13 Jews were washed out of\nschool, I always say, quite by accident, 12 of the 13 Jews were washed out and one of the two\nblacks. The only two people left of that entire group starting, were Bob MacNeil(ph) and me. At\nthe dance, at the graduation dance, Cheryl, who is my wife of 50 years now, as you know and I\nknew then, I met her when she was 17 and was still in college, came to Fort Monmouth(ph) to\nattend the dance and Bob had a friend, a woman named Lua(ph), attend the dance and they had\ndance cards in those days, you actually had a dance card so that you signed up for the dance and I\nsigned up for a dance with Lua(ph) and she was black also and I, I went on the dance floor with her\nwhen our turn came and that was fine and then came the time for Bob to dance with Cheryl and as\nshe got on the floor with him, the floor emptied and all the colonels sitting up on the balcony looked\nlike they were getting nauseous and they were leaning over and Bob said, \"Do you want to stop\ndancing?\" You got to remember, this is in the 40's and she said, \"No.\" And they danced. Nothing\never happened, I was then assigned and then came an interesting thing. For two years in the army, I\nwas assigned to black troops. I went down to the south and I trained with black troops, I went\noverseas with 4000 black troops. I went to a black replacement depot. I was then shipped to a\nreplacement company, picking up wire behind Mauclauck's(ph) third army, the 258 signal light\nconstruction company, which is a black company. I said to a black friend of mine, \"I have a feeling\nthat after that incident at, in OCS, they put N on my service record for Negro.\" She said, \"Maybe\nthey put nigger lover on your service record, NL.\" And that was, but it turned out to be one of the\ngreat, great army experiences. I mean, if you had to have a great army experience, this was it. So\nall of this comes as a background of meeting middle America in all of this and being much more\naware of how our own people felt about Jews, about blacks. I mean, being so isolated in the Bronx,\nI guess I, it was another opening experience. Now, then when I went to Europe and I was there\nabout the time of Nuremberg, I did not see combat by the way, I was very lucky on that, for four\nyears in the army, never to have seen combat was very lucky and again I thank my father for having\nbeen in the signal corps and taking, oh there was one funny thing by the way, which may or may not\nhave anything to do with this but when I graduated from Officer Candidate School as a second\nlieutenant, I was sent back to the school again as a student, where I had written the examinations\nand I had taught for several years, which is a typical army thing. I was now a lieutenant taking a\ncourse with examinations I had written. I did very well. In fact on one I think I got one question\nwrong once because I, I sloughed. When I went to Europe with the occupation forces then, I went\nthrough Belgium and then on 40 and eight trains out to, to Graffenau(ph) in\nBavaria, with the 258 signal light construction company. I began to become much more aware of\nseveral things, number one, of course by that time I was aware of what the Germans had been\ndoing, I did see Dachau after the fact, I knew all of this existed. I never met a Nazi except once,\nthough I was firmly convinced that everybody had been. Nobody admitted it, which I think will\ncome to pass when we talk about Albert Speer. The one person who admitted that he had been a\nNazi and a member of the Nazi party I hired as my driver in Berlin. He was the only honest man I\ncould find and therein hangs a tale when you talk about what happened at Nuremberg, what\nhappened to the people who claimed they never knew what had happened. I went back to the\nUnited States in 1946 for what we laughingly call rest and recuperation because I got married and\nCheryl and I spent 60 days here on honeymoon, went to Washington to try to get her over and then\nshe came over as the first of what she laughingly calls the dependents. She then spent two years on\nEurope with me in Salzburg, where I was station manager of a radio station, KOFA on the\nAmerican Forces Network and then went to Berlin with her as Program Manager of American\nForces Network, Berlin. And we spent the two years, we were there during the airlift and the\nRussian blockade. Things, as always happened, it's, when you're in a situation, it seems to be a lot\nless important or a lot less threatening than it is to people who are reading about it in the\nWashington Post or the New York Times. And though we were blockaded and we did have an\nairlift when the Russians turned the power off at 11 o'clock at night, we lit candles, 1t was that\nsimple. We flew out in 1948 on C47 planes, with our German Shepherd on our laps, you see and\nthen came back to the States. So this was the story, essentially condensed, about these years. Do\nyou have any other questions on this?",
        "Q: Mm-hm, if you want to talk a little bit about becoming aware of Nuremberg, you were in\nEurope, particularly what did people say about it, what were your thoughts about it and anything\nabout Albert Speer because after all, you eventually did interview him and we'll get to that, but in\nterms of having a background.",
        "A: Very good question because a lot of what my feeling were with Albert Speer later on and my\nexperience with him had to do with the things that had happened then. I was aware of Nuremberg, I\nknew what was going on at Nuremberg, I followed it very, very closely. So a lot of what I, I felt at\nthat time, or a lot of my experience at that time had a lot to do in turn with my feelings about Speer.\nNow I was not day to day involved in what was going on at Nuremberg. I knew what was going on\nat Nuremberg, I passed through Nuremberg at the time of the trials, I knew the trials were going on,\nI saw the tanks outside, I knew what was going on at Nuremberg, however, at that time an\ninteresting thing happened, I was still in the army and I was in Salzburg and Cheryl was due to\ncome over and we were setting up, we had a , akind of a castle with a moat type\nof thing, where we had eight Americans and 12 German servants, Austrians, I thought it would\nalways, Cheryl said she thought it would always be this way, you see and, and one of my best\nfriends was a man named Dixie Howell. Dixie Howell was a member, is a major, is a member of\nthe engineers and I guess I was angry at what had happened, I realized that if Germany had won the\nwar I would be dead, I___. And so one day, since he was the engineer, he used to build the\nscaffolds to hang the people who were found guilty of massacring unarmed American soldiers. SS\nmen, people like that and I used to spend the morning watching the hangings. That is one of the\nmost interesting things in terms of what it's done to me today, am I for the death penalty or against\nthe death penalty, how could I stand there in the morning, at six o'clock in the morning on the dock\nand watch people hanged, you see, and not care? The eye for an eye, I don't know. But that had a\nlot to do later on, with when I was asked to do the Albert Speer interviews, because if I could spend\nthose mornings, I obviously had a deep seated anger and hostility and a feeling of vengeance, to be\nable to stand and watch people hanged, whom I didn't even know, I mean these are not even like the\ngreat murders that we read about in the United States today, to watch people hanged and to have no\nfeelings while some of the soldiers who were there as honor guards, would faint. And my feelings\nthen, if I could go back to that, in fact I did some drawings and sent them to Cheryl, I went there and\nI would draw the hangings. Sure, I was 21 or 22 years old, it's not an excuse, it's just that that's what\nit was, I've thought about that often and as recently as the last couple of weeks in talking about death\npenalty and eye for an eye and so on and this came __ back to me and said, but if I stood there and I\nwatched this, how do I feel now? So Nuremberg was going on through this time and I know what\nthe, I of course knew even then what the results were, I knew when they were hanged, I knew about\nGoring taking the pills and committing suicide. I knew all about that then, but it was kind of apart\nfrom other things, this was we had won the war, we had the trial, we would hope it would never\nhappen again and look what's happened. And I, Albert Speer I didn't even know. I knew Goring, I\nknew Goebbels, I knew Himmler, I knew all of the names I should have known. Speer was a non-\nentity to me, if you had mentioned Albert Speer to me at that time, I probably would have said,\n\"Yeah, isn't he, isn't he the minister of armaments, maybe.\" And I say that in 20/20 hindsight, I\ndon't know. At 21 or 22 years of age, it's hard for me to tell you now.",
        "Q: If you can go back to the hangings a little bit, set that scene, what about the first time that you\nwent and how often did you go and how many people were hung at a time and how long would you\nstay?",
        "A: I only went to three, maybe four and then, as with everything else, I mean it's, it isn't a, terrible to\nsay, a novelty, but essentially it's, you know, remembering the time, remembering what we had just\nbeen through, it was a part of, a part, death was a part of life and remembering or, I remember there\nwas another thing and you'll be talking to people who were dealing with refugees, Europe was in\nturmoil, this was not the way it 1s now, you did not get on trains, the trains had no windows, people\nwere trying to find other people. If you traveled from one place to another, people were crowding\nonto planes, I saw, I saw, this is something that just came back to me, I remember GI MP's shooting\ninto the air to keep people from getting onto the GI car because the other cars were so crowded\nwhere people were going from Frankfurt to Berlin, from Berlin to Nuremberg to find, to Munich to\nfind their relatives. Remember, everybody was a displaced person, including the Germans. And so\nyou went from, from place to place as an army person and you had your own cars, all of with the\nwindows bombed out. My first time to Vienna I sat, in the middle of the winter, with windows,\nwith four blankets around me. I mean this was the way people traveled. When you look in context\nof what Europe was at that time, where when the train stopped and people got off and relieved\nthemselves at the side of the tracks and got back on the train, these were pretty terrible times, so a\nhanging was part of life in this whole thing. Now, how often did I go, I can remember three, there\nmay have been a fourth and I stopped. I didn't get a kick out of it, I went because it was something\nto go to. There was a courtyard. It was a very, very dimly lit courtyard. There was a scaffold in the\nmiddle and there was always, interestingly enough, whether I call it an honor guard, but a guard of\nGI's who were standing at the side, as I recall there may have been 10 or 12 in two rows and they\nwere the witnesses to it and the, the sentence was read out in both German and English, it must have\nbeen in English too, because I remember what they were and there would be, a typical one would be\nsomebody who had taken two GI's prisoners and had, had killed them, had shot them and was found\nguilty by a court and was hanged. Then the hoods were put over their heads, there were usually two\nat a time, both trap doors were sprung at the same time, there's a priest and then I guess the thing I\nremember always is the bodies being put in the coffin and one person being too log for the coffin\nand I would leave. It took half an hour. And then probably went to breakfast. I mean this is the\nway it was, you see. So in a sense this was as cold blooded as anything else that's ever been done,\nbut it was again taken as part of what the daily life was at that time, you had trials, there were trials\nall over Germany. In Bavaria I went to trials with people who had done, I can barely remember, I\nremember doing drawings of a priest who was brought up on trial and the people pleading for him\nand I used to send these drawing back to Cheryl, I still have the drawings. You went because this\nwas how Europe was coming out from the war.",
        "Q: And your thinking about it in terms of not being disturbed by it was that these people committed\ncrimes and they had to pay for it?",
        "A: Yes and at the same time that you knew that a lot of Americans had committed crimes. I mean\nthey were not the only ones who shot prisoners and I guess the people who say we, you won\ntherefore, do have a point. At the same time we won therefore, thank God, you see. But I guess,\nyou know, I guess that it all came back to me later on, when we started to discuss Nuremberg and\nwhen we started to talk about my going to interview Albert Speer.",
        "Q: Let's talk about that. In the interim, you became a film maker. I don't know if you want to sort\nof just quickly bring us up to that and then to the point where you got an assignment to interview\nAlbert Speer.",
        "A: I became, actually I became very quickly a radio announcer, a sportscaster, learned enough about\nsports and met enough athletes to hate sports and went into disc jockey and then into television and\nthen by accident in 1956, standing on the corner of 69th Street and Madison Avenue, I met my\ncompany commander from World War 2 and he said to me, \"What are you doing?\" I said, \"I'm a\ntelevision director.\" And he said, \"Why are you in television, why don't you do film?\" And I said,\n\"Well, I don't know.\" And he says, \"I own a film company.\" Interestingly enough, during the war\nwe hated one another, now we're in civilian clothes and he offered me a job in his film company,\nthat's how I became a film maker. I teach at NYU and I have told my students that's how you\nbecome a film maker. Can you imagine if I'd been on 70th Street and Madison Avenue, or 68th\nStreet and Madison Avenue, I would not be in film. I became a documentary film maker. I became\ninterested in the documentary, never interested in the feature, mostly because of meeting I guess\npeople you'd call real people. If you do a film on hospitals, you're going to actually be in hospitals,\nyou're not going to build sets. I really, though I did do a lot of dramatic things on television, like\nplay of the week, I really, never really enjoyed working with actors, I always enjoyed working with\nreal people and finding out about them and I have a curiosity and so I became a documentary film\nmaker and in 1963 was nominated for an Academy Award for a film on Parkinsonism and aging\nand then aging has been a subject of mine for a long time, I've done consultations on it, I've done\nseminars and I've been consultant. But basically I've, I've worked in 60 countries, my wife has been\nalong on almost all of them as a part of the company. I have a curiosity, I do have a curiosity and in\n19, I guess in the mid-70's, I don't remember when Speer's book came out but it was in the 70's,\nInside the Third Reich came out and I was called by McMillan, a woman at McMillan by the name\nof Alma Trynor(ph), who also, incidentally was Jewish, which has something to do with it and the\nbook was coming out and she said, \"Let's have lunch\" and we had Chinese lunch and she said we'd\nlike you to go overseas and interview Albert Speer. By this time I knew a lot more about Albert\nSpeer, I mean, not a lot, but a lot more. By this time I was now some years away from the whole\nthing and I had not read the book, she let me read the, I saw it in manuscript, I did not see it in the\nfinal book til later, saw it in manuscript and they had wanted to do a series of films to put Albert\nSpeer on record about a great many of the things that he had written about in the book. I did not\nknow at that time that there had been a lot of changes made from the German edition, I found this\nout much later. And when she asked if I would do it, one would think I would have jumped on itt,\nactually I turned it down. I turned it down and I said, \"I couldn't do it, I can't go back to Germany, I\nhave great problems when I do go back on business.\" And I had been back several times on travel\nfilms and on documentaries. \"I really would prefer not to go to interview Albert Speer.\" And she\nsaid, \"Well when in your life would you have a chance to meet and interview Hitler's number two\nman?\" And I said, \"Well I guess I never would.\" And now the curiosity begins to take over, right,\nyou're a film maker, a documentary film maker and you're going to find out about this and then it\noccurred to me that there's a very weird, almost surreal feeling about going to interview a man who\nwould have had you killed or have worked you to death if he had won or if I had been in Europe.\nAnd I couldn't resist it. I said, \"Yes, I will go.\" And at that point I read the book again, I did all my\nresearch and reading about Nuremberg again, I found that I was going to go and I would have to\nreally set my mind to the right attitude. I could not go there with the attitude that I wished he'd had\nhung, which I had, but if I was going to get anything from him, we would now have to have a kind\nof a hands off, polite attitude. I had no idea what he would be like and so I went back to\nHeidelberg(ph) with Alma and we spent 10 days with Albert Speer.",
        "Q: Talk a little bit more about how you felt when the woman from the publishing house said, \"I'd\nlike you to go\" and you said, \"No.\" I mean, why the automatic no? What was going through your\nhead?",
        "A: Well I probably, I probably laughed when I said no, I mean it was a very strange kind of a\nrequest. I seldom on a job have said no. I have said no on films where my ethics were involved.\nWithout saying what side I'm on, but on some of the great issues of the world, such as abortion, the\nVietnam War and so on, I had refused films. I refused this on an emotional basis, that I really,\nnumber one, did not want to promote his book. Number two, there's the gut feeling that I'm\nuncomfortable in Germany and that's basically it, you know. I guess though, that the, the whole\nidea of, as she said, meeting someone who was Hitler's number two man, overwhelmed everything\nelse and I decided I would go. But basically I think I've always had a feeling that if I sold one more\ncopy of that book, I'm sorry I did. On the other hand, I'm all for people writing what they feel and,\nyou know, and we have that now even with the David Irving book, though Saint Martens(ph) should\nprobably never have taken it in the first place, the, the title, the David Irving book is on Goebbels\nthe one on Goebbels, which is a Holocaust revisionist, he's the great Holocaust revisionist. I have\nno problem with him writing, I can't stand the man, but you see what I'm talking about, no problem\nwith the book coming out, but why am I publicizing the book? At the same time, perhaps I could\nget some of the answers to which I had always felt I would like some answers and understanding\nalso this was going to be a bright man, this was going to be a man who had really thought about\nwhat he was going to say and that can come later, we can talk about that, because I have many\nfeelings about that. So I went.",
        "Q: How did you prepare yourself emotionally to meet him in a somewhat open way? And was that\nyour goal or did you say to yourself, well I'm going to have opinions about this man and I just, I'm\nnot going to get rid of them, I'm just going to put them to the side. How did you prepare yourself to\ndo that?",
        "A: That, it's again, talking to yourself and saying you know, what is your attitude going to be and I\nhad done enough interviews to say, okay, for the moment, though I have an emotional context in\nthis one, I am just not going to ever show hostility and by the way, there is later, we'll talk about his\nreaction to me and my reaction to him, after ten days, because he was very perceptive about how I\nfelt and I was very perceptive about what he was doing. So it was a hands off thing, I mean it was\nno Albert-buddy, Mel-buddy thing, you have to understand that and that too is a part of our\nrelationship that we can talk about. I arrived in Heidelberg(ph) and my client Alma arrived there, I\nthink that day later or the next day, I don't recall, but the first thing we were to do was to meet\nAlbert Speer at the hotel and we were to go to dinner. And I was excited, in a strange way, I mean\nafter all, it's if you'd said you're going to meet Adolf Hitler I would be excited in a strange way.\nThis was not just meeting somebody who was the president of a corporation. I came down from\nthe, from my room, Alma was still up in her room. I came down from my room and I was sitting in\nthe lobby when he came in with his wife Margaretta and I'll never forget the reaction of the staff.\nThey absolutely were enchanted with this man. This is after the war, this 1s after Nuremberg, this is\nafter he got out of Spandau and the greeting of the manager could not have been more effusive. I\nwas introduced to him, we were, shook hands, I met his wife, we shook hands. Alma came down\nand we went to dinner. We went to dinner at a restaurant of his choosing, which again set the\npattern for all the time we were in Heidelberg(ph). Everybody in the restaurant was at least 50 or 60\nyears old. The owners, as I recall were at least 60 years old and therefore were of his generation.\nHe had chosen a restaurant where the greeting would be absolutely the top greeting that he could\nget, it was the great customer coming in of any restaurant, here is one. I, that was the first startling\nthing, was that these people still admired and probably adored this man and that was a little shaky,\ncontrasted with the fact that from that point on, everywhere else we went in Heidelberg(ph),\nwhether it was to have a Coca-Cola in a small bar or in the case of my client Alma, having her hair\ndone one day, every time we walked into a place, the young people walked out. The word got\naround town and this 1s ironic, the word got around town that friends of Albert Speer were there.\nThis Jewish friend from the Bronx was therefore ignored by most of the people who were in their\n20's and 30's. Alma's hairdresser walked right out on her. She had made an appointment, came in,\nthey said, \"That's Albert Speer's friend\" and they walked out. And so there was this incredible\nseparation of the, so there was this incredible separation of generations and very obvious one. Now\nI was there for 10 days and there were several times that we had dinner with him. Most of the time\nwe did have dinner at his home, which was also a strange experience. I met some of his children.\nHe seemed quite distant from the children too. I have a feeling from the short conversations, their\npolitics were quite different from his. I have a feeling also, after 20 years in Spandau, he had a\ngreat, great distance from the children, I think there was an emotional distance. That was a feeling,\nI mean, you never know. His wife Margaretta was the classic, well -meaning, polite German frau.\nShe never was close to any of our crew. She never was close to us, she did what she had to do and\nhe in turn was always polite, always wore a suit or a jacket, which meant I always wore a sult.\nThese days perhaps we'd be in blue jeans, but we always wore a suit and we spent the 10 days,\nalmost entirely, talking and filming and discussing the things we discussed on film. Hitler, Hitler as\nan artist and we did a film also later on, which I'll talk about, on architecture in a totalitarian regime.",
        "Q: And who wrote down the questions and structured the interview? Were you involved in that,\nwas that your client, did you have a sense that there were any subjects that were skirted?",
        "A: I set up the questions basically, with my client, but basically they were, they were based on the\nbook and also on questions that I had had all these years. I mean now, finally, I have a chance to, I\nhave a chance to speak to Hitler's number two man and I'm going to ask him questions, which\nbecomes a difficult thing, because he had spent his 20 years, let's go back to Nuremberg, the man at\nNuremberg and if I may, the question I had, if I go back, if I can just digress for a minute 1s why\nwas Goring sentenced to death, okay? Well, he was a very well known man and VonShurak(ph)\nand all the people there, why were they sentenced to death and why did two or three of them get\naway with 20 years on Spandau? My feeling then, as my feeling now, even after meeting him, is\nthat he should have been hanged too. But a very interesting thing came up, I asked him a question\nthat I think was the key and Gidda Serany(ph) in her book Albert Speer; His Battle with Truth,\nbrings it up, I think it's on page 167 and I would like to read to it to a moment. \"The New York\nTimes, when he died, printed an obituary and an editorial, both of which said Albert Speer was the\nonly man in Nuremberg to say he was guilty. Sitting on a lawn in Heidelberg(ph) I asked them the\nquestion which started, you were the only man at Nuremberg to say you were guilty. He stopped\nme at that point and said, I didn't say I was guilty, I said I was responsible.\" And for all the years I\nhave been going over the nuances between guilt and responsibility and obviously there is a big\ndifference and in Gidda Serany's(ph) book, she tries to, in a sense, come up with the answer as to\nwhy Speer did not get sentenced to death. In Nuremberg the most amazing thing happened and it\nwas a documentary the other night that covered it. Every single one talked about how he did not\nknow this had happened. Every single one said, well, no, yes he was doing his job, but all this was\nhappening beside him. Speer was the only man who admitted he knew something about it. \"Speer\nwas not,\" she says, \"Speer was not, as 1s sometimes claimed, the only one of the accused at\nNuremberg to feel and admit to guilt,\" by the way, she uses the word guilt and I questioned her on\nthat, \"but his admission, even though much too generalized, was remarkable, because he was the\nonly one, who by making it, risked fatally influencing the court's sentence, which for the others who\naccepted guilt, Hans Frank, Alfred Rosenberg, Olendoff(ph) was inevitable.\" He was the only one\nwho said he knew any of this was going on. He knew that slave labor was being used and in a\nsense, he was the only one then who stood apart from all of the others, because if you hear their\nexcuses, I mean this is absolute insanity that these people claimed that nothing went on, when a man\nwho was in charge of the concentration camps didn't know what was going on in the concentration\ncamps, so that, whatever the reasons, he was always quick to say that he had not admitted guilt, but\nresponsibility and I wrote a letter to the New York Times as you know, which covered that and it's\nalways been a very key point in my feelings about Albert Speer.",
        "Q: How did you come to understand how he differentiated between the two? Why did he stop you\nwhen you asked that question, say, \"No, I didn't say guilt.\" I mean, what was the difference to him?",
        "A: The difference to him was that if he had said he was guilty, even at that point, even after the fact,\nthen he was as guilty of doing it, or having a guilt for having done it as all of the others. By saying\nresponsible, he was one of the people who had it happen. And I think there's just that thin level. In\nother words, I see it as very much the same, if you want to know the truth, but 1t was this very thin\nlevel that I think he felt, in his own mind. The problems that I had with Albert Speer and I must\ngive Gidda Serany(ph) for her book is that she spent four years with him, I spent 10 days. When I\nleft, and we'll go back to the other things later, but when I left, he asked my client how she thought\nwe had done and she said, \"Well, Mel's interviewed before and I think we got everything and as you\nknow, we were out to do a series of short films which would be put in the Huntington-Hartford\nmuseum.\" And he said, \"It's a funny thing about Mel,\" he said, \"he hides everything he feels behind\na sense of humor.\" And I said, \"Would you like to feel my feeling about Albert Speer?\" She said,\n\"Yes.\" I said, \"He hides everything he feels behind 20 years in Spandau.\" This man had had 20\nyears to come up with all the answers. You talked about Hitler and the Jews, Hitler hated the Jews,\nyou talked about anything about slave labor, he had all of the answers. He had written his book, I\nsaw the original manuscript, which was written on tiny scraps of paper about three inches wide and\njagged edges. Wherever he could get paper he wrote this entire book. I know also that the book\nwas changed substantially when it came from German to English. He had the 20 years, he knew he\nwould be talked to after he got out and he was difficult. I did, if I, was I able to break him down at\none point? Very interesting time, only once did I ever ...\nEnd of Side 1, Tape 1",
        "A: Yes, was there a time, is this running? Yeah, it's running. Was there a time that I felt I had\ngotten to him? I asked him what I thought was a very offhanded question, I said, \"How often did\nyour wife visit you in Spandau?\" And he said, \"Once a month.\" I said, \"And how often did your\nchildren visit you in Spandau?\" And he said, \"Once every six months.\" And I said, \"What did you\ntalk about?\" And that is the only time I saw emotion on that man, he started to tear, I could actually\nsee an emotional reaction and he said, \"What do you talk about with someone you love,\" and 1t may\nbe on the tapes that I, \"what do you talk about with someone you love when you see them only once\na month for a few hours or once in six months, once a year or six months for a few hours?\" Other\nthan that the man had, he was gracious, he answered all the questions, his English as you know, was\nexcellent and then we had some interesting experiences. We went through the questions and later\nwe cut the little , we had some interesting experiences, one afternoon he said, \"I\nwould like to show you some of my home movies\" and I said, \"Oh, how marvelous Herr Speer, let's\ngo in and look at some home movies.\" And so we went into his living room, it was a rather nice\nhouse by the way, the house was on a hill in Heidelberg(ph), it was a family home and they'd had\nfor I guess many years. The only problem with it was when there was a storm over Frankfurt the\nairplanes used to come over and circle and you couldn't record. But aside from that we sat on the\nlawn with the birds chirping and we went inside and we went to look at the home movies. And he\nshowed me the home movies of Albert Speer and Adolf Hitler inspecting the tiger tanks on the\nRussian front. And I was a little startled be this because I mean home movies are home movies but\nthis 1s watching his trip with Hitler to the Russian front. Later he said, \"Would you like to see some\nof Adolf Hitler's drawings?\" And this was toward the end of the visit, we went to inside and again\nhe took out all these drawings. Hitler was a terrible artist by the way, terrible. The drawings, and a\nfascinating thing happened, which kind of leaps forward, Alma decided that she would take the\ndrawings back to the United States and put them up on the walls during the exhibition at the\nHuntington-Hartford Museum, which was then at 59th Street and Columbus Circle and that we\nwould have a demonstration or an exhibition of Hitler's drawings. So she arrived at Kennedy\nairport, I had gone off without her and she arrived at Kennedy airport, she tells me and customs, she\nwas carrying them under her arm and Customs said to her, \"What do you got there?\" She said,\n\"Adolf Hitler's drawings.\" And they said, \"Oh, we've had enough wiseguys like you,\" you know,\nand they passed her through. But again, the drawings were shown at Huntington-Hartford Museum.\nWe also did a film which was not planned, that I wanted to do and I don't know where those films\nare, possibly McMillan(ph) has them, I don't know if McMillan(ph) still 1s the McMiullan(ph) it was\nthen, but somebody must have those films. But we did one film that for me was the most\nfascinating. His interviews were fine, I mean, I got as much as I thought I could get, but there was\none that we did where he was really in his element. I asked him, as Gidda Serany(ph) asked him, as\nmany reporters asked him, how he could work with this monster, I mean how could you be a\nmember of Hitler's group and work your way up and he came up with a very interesting answer and\nI guess in all fairness, you have to accept it. He said, \"How would you feel if you were a 29 year\nold architect and the head of state had asked you to be his architect?\" He said, \"You're very proud\nof the head of state,\" he said, \"remember, this is...\" And this is all before the war really got under\nway, this was all in the early days and as a 29 year old, if you look at the people who follow the\npresidents, who follow the congresspeople, look at all your young people, some of them are really\nvery arrogant. I've seen people come in to an airport and say, \"Yeah I want a car because I'm with\nJimmy Carter's entourage.\" And they're 22 years old going on eight, you know and you can\nunderstand at 29 this man was suddenly recognized by the head of state. So we went to the\ndrawings that he had done and we did a film on architecture in a totalitarian society and I think the\nthing that amazed me 1s if I was startled by Hitler's drawings, which were so bad, I was even more\nstartled by the scale of everything that goes on in a totalitarian society. Going back to the\ndemonstrations at Nuremberg in the 30's, with the torchlights, and I did see that, that stadium, it's an\nincredible stadium. Going back to the stadium at Nuremberg, going back to everything they ever\nbuilt, which was always larger than the person, everything that Speer designed, which was going to\nbe in Berlin, right after Germany won the war was on a scale that belies imagination. For example,\na dome which would be on the Unterdinlinden(ph) and would hold 100,000 people. Just a dome.\nAnd then the Unterdinlinden(ph) would now be made into a military avenue of about 48 lanes wide,\nwith cannon on each side. Everything he showed me was totalitarian, was fascist. It's what\nMussolini did, it's what Hitler would do and this man involved himself in things that were beyond\nimagination in terms of scale. I mean a skyscraper's a skyscraper, when you talk about a dome,\nunder which 100,000 people can stand comfortably, you're talking about a pretty big dome.",
        "Q: What was he like when he showed you these drawings, did you sense pride or perhaps a bit of\nembarrassment, what was he like?",
        "A: He would not have taken the drawings out if it were embarrassing. He took the drawings out\nwith pride, he showed them with pride. He showed them matter-of-factly. Speer was a very matter-\nof-fact man with someone like me. I remember him smiling occasionally, certainly, I remember\nhim being warm, but he showed pride in that. I mean, to show me Hitler's drawings, then he said\nMel must have a curiosity to see Hitler's drawings, which I did. So I would say there was no\nembarrassment about anything. Which gets back to that whole thing of guilt and responsibility\ndoesn't it? I didn't find any feeling that he was sorry for it. I certainly would love to have had him\nsay he was sorry they lost the war, but you, you'd never get this from him. He was very withdrawn\nin that sense but very bright and all his answers were there. I have not heard the tapes in a lot of\nyears, you have, recently, I sent them down without hearing them and at some point I think I'd like\nto hear them again. And I'm sorry two tapes are missing because I don't know which two tapes are\nmissing. If I find them, they'll go down. But the 10 days went very comfortably, shall I say? I\nremember another thing, I am a hugger, I mean you know, I am a toucher, I'm a hugger. Well, I\ndidn't hug him, but when we left, Margaretta was saying goodbye to the crew and she had really\nbeen a very nice woman, I mean you know, she wasn't, like my mother or my grandmother, she was\na nice woman. She took care of the crew, she fed us, she was at the table with us. She said very\nlittle. And so, impulsively I went to hug her and that's when I realized that this was really a job, I\nwas hugging a rod of steel. This was no woman who was going to hug me back. So whatever her\nfeelings were about this Jewish producer, I don't know, but that was, that, I always remember, I can\nremember it vividly, I can remember where we were because it was kind of a slap in my face that,\nbut I am impulsive that way and I hug people, I hug men I love, I hug women, I hug. Because I like\nto touch. But not there. He and I shook hands.",
        "Q: What about the mood and also the eye contact, what was that like for you and how did you feel\nafter a day, five, six hours of filming, how did you feel afterwards?",
        "A: That's a wonderful question because I think what I did is I think that after the day, I blanked out.\nI did not do, I could not have spoken to you after the interviews as I'm speaking to you now, 20\nsome odd years later. It was a job. I hate to say it that way because you know, it was my job, I did\nit, people use that as an excuse, but it was a job and if I was going to do the job properly, I had to do\nit as a professional. Otherwise I should not have taken the job. And so how did I feel through the\nday? I was interested, I was interested in what he had to say, the relationship was comfortable at\nthat time. At the end of the day I have, we went around Heidelberg(ph), we went to dinners, we\nreally never discussed it or if we discussed it I can't remember having discussed it in any depth now.\nBut all of the, the days were very comfortable days, the weather turned out to be great, it was June\nas I recall, the weather turned out to be great. He was always very, very charming and I thought\nmore about what questions I'd ask the next day but never did I ever feel like Gidda Serany(ph) did\nin four years in being able to break through some of this. The man could not be broken through.\nAnd whether he then eventually said or felt he was guilty as she says, he did not at that time. Did I\nfeel when I left there that they should have hanged him? Yeah. I feel it to this day. I think he got\naway with murder. For whatever reasons, he got away with murder. He was using slave labor. His\nexcuses for that of course, if you've heard the tapes are you know, this was a war effort, he had\nnothing to do with the day to day things in the factories, he had to provide people so they could\nprovide for the war effort. He was a loyal German, which he should have been. I guess probably\neven after this, I'll think of things that will come back now that I didn't think of 20 years ago.",
        "Q: Did you have any sense of him having an inner struggle and perhaps say, being afraid of it\nalmost and saying no, I still have to believe that what I did was okay, or did you have a sense of that\ngoing on inside of Albert Speer?",
        "A: Yeah, I would never know what was going on inside of Albert Speer, he had learned to control\nthat and whether he did or not, I know that in future interviews, like in this latest book, he had\nlearned to back off where he didn't want to answer and even if you pursued it, he would go only so\nfar. Did he have an inner turmoil? I don't know, I don't know. I don't know if the man felt that he\nwas sorry he was ever convicted, he was sorry they had ever lost, I have no idea and I would never\nknow this of Albert Speer. He handled himself very well in those interviews. He did what he was\nsupposed to do, I did what I was supposed to do. If I had to do it all over again, I probably would\ncome up with even more driving questions than I did then because I know a lot more now than I did\nthen and it's very difficult to go into an interview like that as a documentary film maker, having\nstudied everything you can about it and still think that you've covered everything, you can't cover\neverything. There are the old, I should have, I could have.",
        "Q: Why do you think he did the interview, or why did he do, beyond perhaps the obvious reasons, I\nmean the man didn't have to do interviews, but apparently he did them somewhat frequently.",
        "A: I think that they, I think a part of it, well first I think Albert Speer did his interviews partially for\nthe reasons that you kind of touched on a moment ago of being able to justify Albert Speer and his\nbackground and what he did. Partially because I think he was convinced that if you're going to sell\nthe book and, I mean this is a very pragmatic reason, that you're going to sell your book and you're\ngoing to convince people to go buy a book of, the number, several, 600 pages or whatever it was,\nyou have to do media tours, you have to do these interviews. I think his publisher had a lot to do\nwith this. I think the publisher both in Germany and McMillan(ph) here in the United States said if\nyou're going to do this book, you are going to have to do interviews. And he did a series of\ninterviews right after that for television and for radio and did them later on, there was a second\nbook, which I was not involved whit and I know nothing about. I had had just about enough at one\npoint, but I think that was it and I do believe that there was a feeling that he was now being\nrecognized. Remember Albert Speer also, if he'd been hanged, would have gone down with Goring\nand all the rest of them, that would have been it. Albert Speer came out at the end of 20 years in\nprison and had a chance to be rehabilitated, I don't know if it was that, but to at least to a person\nagain, in the society and with enough clout in the society to be interviewed by the press, to ask his\nopinions. I don't think in that sense it's any different from any of the people who came up 1n post\nwar Germany and were interviewed. I think he also was grasping and groping to try to find his way\nback to his family. I mentioned that the impression I got of his six children, all of whom were born\nbefore he went to prison and therefore didn't see him for 20 years except twice a year, were very,\nvery distant and almost isolated from him. I never got the feeling while I was there, in 10 days that\nthere was any great love, the kind of love you see, almost in a physical love, a touching or a kiss, I\nnever saw that. Now that may be only the Germanic thing and he didn't want to show it, so it's hard\nto tell, it's like you never know the inside of a marriage, but that was the impression I got. I got the\nimpression also that the man who came out of one of the worst of the fascist dictatorships in the\nworld had several children who were very left wing. And I'm sure this bothered him.",
        "Q: Did you get any sense of sadness ever from him? We sort of touched on that earlier, but I'd like\nto ask it again, about anything? Perhaps about his family? It was just what you're saying.",
        "A: That's interesting. If I were to put it, that's a marvelous question because I would say there was\nalways a sense of sadness. I don't know whether the sadness was created by 20 years lost without\nthe family, now back to the family. You have lost 20 years, you have come out of Spandau and\nyou've lost 20 years. I never got the feeling of a sense of joy, a sense of freedom, a sense of release.\nBut you're saying that now, if I had to put it in my own word, I think there was, over the 10 days, a\nsense of sadness. Even and a sense of propriety, of a proper human being who, when he went to the\nrestaurants, as I mentioned, was cordial, was pleasant. But was never hi Joe, you know, how, nice\nto see you, ever, always proper. Just as the suits, between the two of us, both of us wearing suits,\nwere always proper. We never called one another by first name. We never touched more than a\nhandshake. I always had the underlying feeling of 1f had won I would be dead, but I pushed it aside,\nI had to. And interestingly enough, on the day to day discussions, it was just like speaking to you, it\nwas fine, it was we talked. I mean he wasn't going to do anything to me and I wasn't going to\nstrangle him and so we put that aside right at the beginning and we were going to try to get to the\nbottom of something to which we really never go to the bottom, bottom and never would and\nnobody ever will, about Albert Speer. The closest one who got to it was Gidda Serany(ph) and even\nthere you get very little of Albert Speer. Course when he wanted, when he was annoyed or upset,\nhe let her know it. And she spent four years with him.",
        "Q: What you've said to me before our interview began, you can't imagine spending four years with\nhim.",
        "A: Oh well, yeah, in speaking of Gidda Serany(ph) spending four years with Albert Speer, I am\nalmost overwhelmed at the professionalism and the bulldog grit 1t must have taken to do this, in four\nyears that, I could not have spent four years with Albert Speer. Well, I'm also type A, so that, you\nknow I, 10 days is quite enough, that's usually... The thing that she did that I could not do and that I\nthink is critical to any, any journalist or any film maker who interviewed Albert Speer, has to realize\nthat none of us could have done what she did, which was to question him and then move to the\npeople he mentioned in his answers to find out if A, they were true, if B these people had seen them\nand remembered them as Albert Speer remembered them and then to go to the archives and find out\nif either one was telling the truth. This takes a lot of time and a lot of, of, of digging and she did it\nand I admire the book as a result. I mean the book is overwhelming and I've written to her as you\nknow and I've gotten an answer and I would like to meet with her, in a shared experience, mine 10\ndays and hers four years. I would like to find out how she could spend four years there, doing it.\nAnd in reading the book and I read it carefully, I'm back in the middle again, reading it carefully, I\njust quoted from page 167. I'm fascinated by the fact, the determination and the fact that she kept\nup with this thing and questioned everything down the line, including the wives and the children of\nsome of the people who had been at Eagle's Nest and Bertasgarten(ph). By the way, I did visit there\nwhen I was stationed in Salzburg and I, Bertasgarten(ph), Hitler's Eagle's Nest home, or his hideout,\nthe Eagle's Nest in Bertasgarten(ph), there they had destroyed the SS barracks right below and the\nEagle's Nest was still there and I remember going through saying, well Hitler was here, you know,\nthis is where Hitler was. That was kind of an unreal experience, this was speaking to the man. But\ngetting back to your, your said, did I see a sadness, I think yes, I think deeply there was, there was a\nsadness, there possibly was a feeling that people didn't quite understand why he had done some of\nthese things. Witnesses saying if you were 29 and the head of state asked you to be his architect, it\nwas, it was an experience I guess that any of us, particularly the Jewish boy from the Bronx would\nalways carry with me and I do. And when I found the tapes, I could not believe, I didn't know what\nhad happened to them and there are still two missing, I'm going to find them. I don't know where\nthe films are, I would like to have them. Actually, what I would like to have is the original, the\nuncut film. The 10 minute cuts are nothing more than 10 minute cuts. I would like to find the\noriginal film somewhere. I don't know if that's possible, it's too far away. Film was probably\ndestroyed.",
        "Q: How did the experience and perhaps not even immediately, but meeting him, spending those 10\ndays with Albert Speer, how did that change your understanding of Nazi Germany? Or perhaps of\none Nazi?",
        "A: Let's put it this way, I've never understood Nazi Germany, just as I have never understood, I have\nnever understood the kind of destruction that went on in Nazi Germany, almost the engineers at\nwork. I can more easily understand Biafra, I can even understand Vietnam, I can understand\nNigeria, I can understand tribal warfare. I don't like it and I think it's horrendous, but I can\nunderstand this because people do react this way. Bosnia is the classic example of the problems of\n100 years back. But when I look at Nazi Germany and I haven't changed my opinion there, I felt\nexactly the same way before and I feel exactly the same way now. The anti-Semitism, anti-\nSemitism in the first place I find difficult to understand. I find anti anything of a group or a race,\ndifficult to understand. But when you look at what Nazi Germany did, with something like, was it\n600 concentration camps or places of death, when you look at the use of slave labor, when you look\nat the deliberate way in which they did this, I still don't understand it. I had known people who left\nGermany, who are not Jewish, because they understood that this was a country they couldn't live in.\nIf it happened in my country, I have often said I probably would have to leave. So has it changed,\ndid it change my feeling about Albert Speer? Before I met Albert Speer, I had no real feeling of\nAlbert Speer. He was a person. I knew he was, in fact I knew him as the Minister of Armaments, I\nhad forgotten that he was an architect, I then, as you begin to read you realize, yes, yes, yes, I know\nhe is. I had no feeling about him before. My feeling about him now 1s a rather distant one. I don't\nfeel any great warmth toward, toward him and that experience. I still can't understand how and why\nhe did it. In terms of Nazism and what happened in Germany, I cannot for the life of me understand\nhow any country, how the people in any country could do what they did and how they did it and the\nmethods in which they did it. This is not meeting someone in war, it's not even the SS man killing\nan unarmed American soldier or an American soldier in Melai(ph). This is something that is\nbeyond my understanding. So in that sense there's been no real change. I still have difficulty when\nI go back to Germany. I still have, I must admit this, I have difficulty in the following way. I've\nhad to go back to Germany on several, and this had nothing to do with the younger Germans\nbecause what happens to me is when I go to a hotel lobby and I see people my age, I'll be 73 in\nAugust, when I see people my age sitting there in suits and drinking and having a great time, I\nmentally put SS on their lapels. And I'm sorry, this is the way it is and I've spent a lot of time there\nand I don't have to like everything and I don't have to like everybody. I'm glad Germany's a\ndemocracy, I'm glad the east and west have gotten together. I don't have to like going back. I find\nmyself very uncomfortable there, I find the German language very uncomfortable. I mean this as\nhonest as I can be with you. I have not forgiven and I certainly don't forget. And what I feel is that\nplaces like the Holocaust Museum must open everywhere and that the younger people particularly,\nmust go there and must see it. Because with the revisionists, remember, those of us who have met\nAlbert Speer, those of us who have been in the concentration camps are going to be dead and then\nthe revisionism is really going to start, how can you believe all those dead people? And this is not\nfar-fetched, this is what will happen. And so all of these places are important because there are\npeople like me who have not forgotten. And it's not a matter of forgiving, I don't have to forgive,\nyou see. I also don't have to forget. So I have not changed my feeling about Nazism and Albert\nSpeer is a story that took place and if I can have offered something to the Holocaust Museum in the\ntapes, so much the better, that's good because I think that these memories have to be kept and I think\nthat people have to be able to go there and hear them.",
        "Q: Can listen to him and decide for themselves 1n part.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "Q: And compare it with the interview with you.",
        "A: Yes. And listen and decide and read the books and thank goodness for the books. And\ninterestingly enough I find that these books are now starting to come out so many years later, I\nwould have expected they would have been 10 or 20 years before. Of the new Goldhagen(ph) book\nwhich talks about the guilt of all of the normal Germans, the people who used to go and watch\nexecutions. But you know, that's interesting, too. Let me not just take off on that because there are\nparallels. _Timmerman(ph) in his book and the torture that he underwent in Argentina has a\nhorrifying discussion with his torturer, who does his torture as a normal job, then says to\nTimmerman(ph) after the torture, \"Listen, my son wants to get into college, do you know somebody\nwho can get him into college?\" So if we talk about the banality of evil, you know, Hannah\nArons(ph) great statement, this happens in a lot of places, there are torturers and was I any different\nwhen I watched the hangman and I went away with no feeling about them? So people are capable\nof this. But nobody has ever done it on the scale of the Germans. Nobody has ever actually built\ngas chambers to put people in, had collected hair and has collected teeth and has collected shoes.\nAnd has had this virulent anti-Semitism, that is bad enough in the world as it is, but has done\nsomething like that that is inconceivable. So I don't have to forgive them. I also don't have to like\nthem.",
        "Q: I hear you talking, it's almost like a visceral thing inside of you, it's not necessarily something\nyou've, I mean obviously you've thought about it, but it's, you're talking about a visceral reaction\nfor instance, when you're in Germany.",
        "A: Absolutely it's visceral, I mean, the intellectual, let me give you an intellectual thing.\nIntellectually I would say, well yes, you know, after all it is that time, there is a new generation,\nwhich there is and there were good people and there were bad people and it's done and gone and I\ncan't do this. Of course it's visceral. It's visceral also because I, I see the stirrings in other areas. I\nsee the stirrings out in, with the Michigan Militia, I see the stirrings with the anti-Semitism that's\ncome up. I see the stirrings with a presidential candidate who is anti-Semitic, whether you like it or\nnot, he can say he's not and he has Jewish people on his staff, he's anti-Semitic. If you see these\nstirrings as a Jew, you always are aware of it. You're always careful, that this is something that can\naffect you, this is something that can kill you. It has happened. And so my only reaction can be\nvisceral. Because we have the antennas out, as the Blacks, the African-Americans have their\nantennas out to everything that's done, whether it's getting, can't get a taxi in New York cause they\npass you by, to the anti-Black statements that are made. You always have your antenna out as an\nAfrican-American. Well you always have your antenna out as a Jew. And so my reaction to an\nAlbert Speer or my reaction to Germany is totally visceral. And I'd be lying if I said that well I, you\nknow I have to be intellectual about it now, I can't. But as I said to someone, I was interviewed on a\ntravel show once, I had done a travel book and I've done a lot of travel films and somebody said to\nme, \"What's your favorite country?\" And I said, \"Italy, I love to go to Italy, I had an office in Italy\nfor five years.\" And he said, \"And which countries don't you like?\" I said, \"Well I don't think it's\nup to me to tell you on this program which countries I don't like.\" And I never did on the program,\nbut the point is, having worked in 60 countries, I can like 59, I don't have to like all 60 countries and\nthat may be very unintellectual, it may be very visceral, that's how I feel and I think I've got to\nremember that and I want the Holocaust Museums to make people remember what these people did,\neven if they're all dead, that it can happen again.",
        "Q: Are you glad you interviewed Albert Speer?",
        "A: Oh, absolutely. Wouldn't have missed it for the world, even though I turned it down the first\ntime, I mean, oh of course, I'm, 1t was another part of the experience you have as a film maker, it's\nanother part of the experience you have as a documentary film maker. It's the kind of thing where\npeople say, \"Oh you've led a very exciting life.\" I say, \"Well it's not over yet, you know.\" And\nwe're going to China and Japan next year on a job. But yes, it's, I'm glad I met Albert Speer. I'm\nglad that I have worked in countries where there have been dictators, not quite as bad as Hitler, but\nwhere I have been able to see first hand what went on. Whether I got anything more out of my\nvisceral feeling since Albert Speer? Not really, but that was a part of the experience and I am very\nglad that I went over there.",
        "Q: Do you think that he had sat across from the table very often with Jews and answered questions?",
        "A: Possibly some reporters, I don't know. He knew I was Jewish, certainly. I mean if he didn't\nknow, somewhere along the line I'm sure I told him about my Bar Mitzvah, you know. But I have a\nway of letting, but he knew and he knew Alma was Jewish, so he had in essence a Jewish client and\na Jewish producer. The rest of the crew were all American and German and Austrian. But yes, I, I,\nI think, I think that he had at some point, I don't think at this point it made any difference to him.\nYou know, we did not come on as Jews if there were other reporters who did interview him, but at\nthe same time, deep in my gut was always the feeling that I am Jewish and this man was number\ntwo in Hitler's staff.",
        "Q: Did you ever feel any responsibility in terms of representing Jews when you were sitting there\nasking questions?",
        "A: No, I don't think I represented Judaism, you know, I, it's a good question, no, no I don't think I\ndid and I don't think it was there, you know, you're, I would say that, at this point I look at it and\nsay, yeah it's kind of interesting that a Jewish producer was sent to interview this man who had used\nslave labor and who would have been dead if he'd won, I, we go back to that whole thing that sent\nme over in the first place. But I never represent, I can't represent Judaism, Judaism is diverse, as\ndiverse as, as any of the religions, so and I'm sure there are Jews, cause I read there are Jews who\nhave forgiven at this point, say we must move on. And whether that's there way of handling it or\nnot, that's fine. My way of handling is that we never forget.",
        "Q: Did you like anything about Albert Speer?",
        "A: Did I like anything about Albert Speer? I, that's a wonderful question in that I can't think of\nanything I liked as a very positive thing, but I can't think of anything I disliked. He was, as I say,\ncomfortable with me, at least outwardly. He was a gentleman. He was a very gracious host. I\nmean we wanted for nothing while we were there. He did take us through the town to the places he\nknew. He answered the questions, he never balked. I didn't dislike anything, he was one of the\neasiest interviews in the sense of a day to day relationship over a period of 10 days. What did I\nlike? I can't think of anything that I would say I really, you know I really liked. No one's ever\nasked me that question.",
        "Q: Do you think you learned anything from him? I mean, 10 days is a long time, you often go away\nfrom an interview with something.",
        "A: What I think I learned is that a great many people in my generation were not at all sorry for what\nhappened. The reaction that these people had. I mean I was fairly aware of it before then, having\nworked in Germany several times and having lived in Germany after the war, that the people of my\ngeneration were not at all sorry that it happened, were not at all guilty about what happened.\nMaintained and retained many of their feelings, probably anti-Semitic and so on, about the Jews,\nabout Germany. I learned also first hand, that the younger generation, for the most part seem to\nreject that. They may not want to hear about it, but they seem to reject it. The fact that the word got\naround that we were quote friends of Albert Speer and they'd walk out, meant that that there was\ntheir visceral reaction to somebody who was there as a quote friend of a Nazi. So that even in my\nmind I have a great division where I go right down the line and say there is a whole group that I\nhave, I may not like listening to their German because it reminds me of that time, but I don't hold\nthem responsible for it. I find that I have difficulty even today, meeting people of my generation in\nGermany or who are Germans and are traveling. I get the gut feeling, over and over again when I\ngo a place like the Algove(ph) or I go to Spain and I see groups of Germans traveling, of my age, I\nget the immediate feeling and I must admit this, that while the Jews lie in their graves, there's a\nJewish term for that, they are out enjoying themselves. I still have that feeling and I resent it. Not\nmy feeling, I resent their enjoying it.",
        "Q: What's the Jewish term?",
        "A: Liktendred(ph), lies in, lies in, in hell. While the Jews liktendred(ph) and I, that's the feeling I\nget, it's the feeling I have wherever I go. I must tell you, in terms of my emotional feeling, if I go to\nGreece and there are groups of German tourists come in to a restaurant, my stomach knots. Now\nthat's, you talk about visceral, I have no intellectual feeling about it any more, I should actually pay\nno attention to it. So I am in that sense very deeply a Jew and very deeply involved with what\nhappened in the Holocaust and very deeply involved with what the Nazi's did and don't ever want to\nsee it happen again to anyone. But I still, if I, I have a job coming up where I may have to go back\nto Germany and I would like, frankly to have that country dropped from the group that we're going\nto and it won't be and I will be a good professional film maker again and I will go. It has nothing to\ndo with boosting Germany or anything, it just happens to be a business thing. But I have that\nfeeling and I make no excuses for it.",
        "Q: It's a powerful feeling.",
        "A: Well it's, 1t comes out as you see.",
        "Q: I mean it's not a feeling that was given particularly by your family, it really came out of your\nexperience as a young man.",
        "A: Yeah, I think it comes deeper than experience as a young man, I think it comes from I am\nconvinced that there is an ethnic depth in people. I'll give you an example. When I hear Middle\nEastern music and this includes Arabic, Israeli, any Middle Eastern music or Russian music,\nsomething deep within me comes to life.",
        "Q: Good?",
        "A: Good. Good feeling. I mean I happen to be one who can't understand why the Arabs and the\nJews fight. There is a very deep, Middle Eastern, ethnic level there so that I think, my wife Cheryl\nhas the same feeling, I'm not the only one. Or she'll look at me and all of a sudden I stiffen with\npleasure because the music gets to me. Now that didn't come from my background as a child and it\ndidn't come from what my parents taught me because except for my Bar Mitzvah, I really was not a\nvery good Jew. But I am a very good Jew as a Jew because that's how I feel. So there is an\ninstinctive Judaism there, don't ask me to explain it.",
        "Q: Okay. I actually haven't asked you anything about this and I think there's probably some things\nyou can say about it. What sense did you get of Speer's relationship with Hitler?",
        "A: Very close, very close. All the photographs, all the photographs that he has, all of the\nmemorabilia, his home movies. I had a feeling that Speer, although I notice Gidda Serany(ph) says\nat the beginning was not part of the inner circle, I got a feeling that he was very close. And I have a\nfeeling that he respected the man as the leader of his country and I believe he always did and I don't\nbelieve he ever changed his mind, through the end of the war.",
        "Q: Even though in your tapes you do talk about that point where Albert Speer gets sick and he\ndoesn't see Hitler for awhile and as he explains it, he's pulled out of his sphere of influence and then\nwhen he sees him again, something has changed. So even after that change, you don't think that he\nfundamentally changed?",
        "A: No, I don't think he fundamentally changed. I think this was the, this was the dynamics and I\ncan't speak too you know, authentically, but I think it's the dynamics of what happened. Remember\nthis whole inner group were always close to Hitler. You move out for awhile like in any corporate\ngroup and then you move in and you've got to work your way back in again. I think he always\nrespected Hitler. I don't know how he felt at the end of the war, I don't know how he felt before he\ndied but my feeling was that he was close.",
        "Q: He says in the interview that you did with him that he feels embarrassed, I think, he might have\neven said shame and he is very halting when he says this, at declaring his admiration for somebody\nwho became such a monster. So what's going on there, he's using the right terms for Hitler, he's\ncalling him a monster, but he's also saying that he really cared deeply about this man.",
        "A: See, this is the point, when anyone interviews a man like Albert Speer. Is he saying this because\nthis is politically correct? That was a term that was not around then. Is this the answer he expects\nme to have? I mean suppose he said to me and this is only instinctive about his feeling about Hitler\nthrough the time. Suppose he said to me, \"Oh this man was a monster, I hated him at the end, I'm\nglad he was dead.\" Do you think I could believe it for one minute? Not when he was involved with\nthe armaments almost right up until the last minute. Not until he was the heir apparent, the heir\napparent to Hitler if Hitler had been killed. No, I have a feeling that we're back to his coming up\nwith the answers of 20 years in Spandau. That's a feeling. But then again, I'm a very prejudiced\nman about that whole thing, so you know, in...",
        "Q: And you were there, you spent 10 days with him, so some of the information that you'd gather\nabout him are feelings and nuances about ways he said things and his body language, that sort of.",
        "A: Well the body language was pretty much the same throughout. Almost rigid, comfortable.\nComfortable in his answers. As I say I think he thought about them through all that time. But in\nterms of body language, look, he was, there was always the gap between us, let's face it, I mean\nremember, always the business suits with the ties. I was doing my job and he was answering the\nbest he had thought about answering through all these years. I think he had come up with the\nanswers to every one of the questions that I asked him and possibly not what Gidda Serany(ph) did\ncause she really went in depth, but that any reporter coming there would have asked him. I found\nno great revelation in anything I read later on.",
        "Q: Did you understand Hitler any better after you'd done this 10 day interview?",
        "A: No. You know, I, it's, if, no I didn't understand Hitler any better and I don't think that I could\nhave gotten that out of this. Probably is one of the world's great monsters, I put with him all the\nother people who were with him as just as monstrous. It was not only Hitler, they had to go along\nwith him, they knew what was happening. I not only don't understand Hitler any better, I don't\nunderstand the virulence of the entire group around him, including Goebbels, including Goring,\nincluding VonShurack(ph), including all of them. No, I said before I would never understand the\nNazi movement. Oh, I understand then, I know, understand what it did, I understand everything for\nafter World War 1, I understand all of the things that happened. I hear a great many of the things\nhappening today. The populist thing about look what they did to you in the war and look what the\ncorporations are doing to you, this was Hitler's whole schtick and I understand it after the war. I\nunderstand also the thing of uniforms and Nuremberg and so on. I can even understand them\nforming the army, I can even understand them having a war. What I can't understand is what they\ndid to 20 million people, deliberately.",
        "Q: Did Albert Speer ever bring up some of the delicate questions himself in a way to sort of pre-\nempt you, perhaps bringing up the issue of what he knew about the Jews, what was happening to the\nJews and when?",
        "A: No, as I recall, now remember this is recalling. As I recall what, the pattern was pretty well set\nin that unless there was a question he never really volunteered anything, except to bring me in to see\nHitler's drawings and the architectural things and the home movies, these were volunteered. In\nterms of the answers to the questions, not really. Now I have not heard the tapes in a while, you'd\nhave to hear that, I really don't remember. I remember it being a pattern, I had my list and this is\npretty much what we went to.",
        "Q: With the things he volunteered, just listening to you just say that right now I'm wondering, was\nhe just trying to show you just another slightly different angle so that perhaps it being more three\ndimensional for you? What's your thoughts on that?",
        "A: Well it's hard to say. Again, I can't remember all the nuances of the time I was there. He was\nprofessional. It's the best I can say.",
        "Q: Did he say anything that surprised you?\nEnd of Tape 1.\nTape 2",
        "Q: Was there a moment in the 10 days that Albert Speer caught you off guard, said something that\nsurprised you, perhaps even did something?",
        "A: Not in terms, I don't remember anything, I'm sure there must have been some times and I'm sure\nthat some of the questions, but you asked the question, the first thing that came to mind was\nsomething that has been made very available at this time and in fact I saw it not too long ago on a,\non a documentary about the war, which had nothing to do with Albert Speer or Adolf Hitler. And it\nhad to do with the problems that came up in armaments during the end of the war. The Germans\nwere the first to develop jet planes, or to develop flyable jet planes, which would have totally\ndestroyed the armada's of the allies, considering everything was a prop plane at the time, the flying\nfortresses and so on and the P38's and Hitler did not trust the jet engine, it had no propeller. And\ntherefore, up until the very end, he refused to let them use it. At the very end he let them use it. By\nthat time though, Speer could not develop enough planes to make any difference. But there was a\nfascinating thing, it's like somebody developing the atomic bomb before us, so of all the things that\nhe mentioned to me, that sticks in my mind as something that I had not heard of and now as I say,\nhas become part of the historians, you know, the historians whole group of books and films and so\non. But that to me, surprised me. Other than that, in terms of the answers, remember I said my\nfeeling was, through the entire time that he had come up, I could not come up with a question except\nasking what he said to his wife and his children, in the visits to Spandau, that he would not have\nthought of before. A very bright man, a very bright man. Under some other form of government\nwould have been a brilliant executive possibly, I can't say architect because I was never very\nimpressed with his architecture as I was not impressed with Hitler's drawings, but was bright\nenough, was presentable enough, was articulate enough. Certainly spoke English quite well. Could\nhave been a really well known, great man in some other country. But he never really, we never\nreally threw one another. He never really threw me, I had my questions, I always had to keep my\ndeep feelings buried, which I did and he in turn had thought of every single one of the answers.",
        "Q: Do you think that, do you think that what you were just mentioning, that he's very bright, he\ncould have, he could have just been such a shining star in another country, another government, do\nyou think that might be part of where his sadness comes from?",
        "A: Possibly, that's something that you know, I can't, if it were me, if I felt that way, yeah, I would, I\nwould say so, look at there but for the grace of God. Just as I say, if he had won, I'd be dead. Or I'd\nbe slave labor, yeah if he'd been, but he wasn't, he was a part of Hitler's entourage and he was very\nmuch, very much in favor with Hitler through most of the time. He was a part of the inner circle, he\nwas for a long time the second in command, if Hitler had died he would have gotten the, the, he\nwould have been head of Germany. It's a remarkable thing for a man who at that time was in his\n30's and then 40's. I asked him about Spandau you know, but basically I got the fairly standard\nanswers, he, it fascinated me also, was I guess one of the other things, surprised I mentioned that he\nhad showed me the original manuscript. If you could take pieces of torn out paper, just take about\n600 pieces of skinny, torn out paper, no more than three inches, with a tiny Germanic hand written\non it, then you'll know what the manuscript is, this whole stack of papers which he got out, I guess\ngot out through Margaretta(ph), but that was the manuscript of his book. So remember this, he was\nwriting that book while he was still in Spandau. The thing that also bothers me, I think, if I think\nabout it, and you say you know, what were my real feelings about him. Remember also that the\nbook changed in context from the German to the American version. The whole section on anti-\nSemitism was toned down. The whole, a whole, no, yes, well no, when you say after I did the\ninterview, no, they, it was being done while I was doing the interview, that book was not out, I only\nsaw the book in manuscript, but I had not seen the German version. But the German version and\nthe English version do not match, in several important places, because for the American audience,\nthey felt they could not be as strong in some of the areas. So now that gives you a kind of a\nsuspicion, both about Albert Speer and the people who controlled the publication of the book.",
        "Q: You talk about how he sort of gave you what he wanted to, he'd thought these answers out and\nyet it seems that in a way, it's like his self portrait and that's revealing too, what he does want to say\nabout himself, Albert Speer and what he doesn't, that while you were, you feel that you weren't able\nto puncture it too much, it's still a self portrait.",
        "A: Of course, this is what he wants you to think, this is what he wants you to feel, he certainly is not\ngoing to come out as a self proclaimed monster, which by the way I don't think he was. You see,\nyes he used slave labor and he may or may not have been anti-Semitic. Interestingly enough, I'm\nnot sure. He may have been one of those, those, apolitical people in terms of his anti-Semitism, I\ndon't know. Certainly he was not one of the virulent ones, certainly he was not a Goebbels. On the\nother hand, he was a part of the hierarchy and you know, the responsibility is there, it's like the\nresponsibility is there. When you have a doctor and the nurse is hostile to you, the doctor is\nresponsible. Well it's the same thing here, he's responsible. I mean he was a top man in this group.\nSo yes, he wanted you to feel, as anyone does, a certain way. He wants to present and to\ncommunicate to you how he, Albert Speer feels about it and come out looking pretty, at least fairly\ngood, not as a monster. Remember also, he was shrewd enough and he was smart enough not to get\nthe death penalty. And he had to maintain that too, he could not be one of the monsters that was put\nto death.",
        "Q: You talk about burying your own feelings. Was there a time after the interview, in the day or\ntwo after, leaving Germany, or even a month or two later, when at some point the feelings surface\nand what was that like or, or did you basically just erase 1t somehow?",
        "A: No, I never erased it and the feeling did surface and after leaving, as with any reporter or film\nmaker, I would like to have had the 10 days again because there were places I think I was too kind.\nThere were places I felt and still feel that my follow up was not strong enough. At the same time,\nit's now 20-20 hindsight, I now know a lot more. In fact if I were to see him again, I don't want to\nsee him, he's dead, but if I were to see him again, I would have a lot more questions and a lot of\nthem would come from research that's been done by people like Gidda Serany(ph). I didn't have it\nat that time. Remember, he had just come out of Spandau a few years before or a year or two\nbefore. That's another thing that we've got to keep in mind, he came out of prison, he was a\nprisoner, he came out, he's now with the family, he's in Heidelberg(ph) where half of the town hates\nhim and the other half of the town puts the red carpet down. He's with his family, he'd not seen\nMargaretta(ph) for, more than once a month for 20 years. He'd not seen these kids who grew up\nwithout him, some of whom as I say I was sure was left, were left of center. And so, coming out of\nprison as any prisoner, aside from the horrendous things that were done by the Nazi regime, coming\nout as any prisoner, he had a lot to get used to. And even getting used to sitting down at a table with\na group of film makers and his wife and his children and having a dinner. Always at the head of the\ntable, very stiff. Very, very stiff.",
        "Q: Definitely, I think you've just used a few words, but that image comes across very clearly, this\nman, who was rigid and his whole body was controlled. You are showing, you're pulling out some\npictures.",
        "A: I, yes, I am pulling out the pictures, look at any of these. Look at me, pointing my finger and\nlook at him answering the questions. Here you have an even better one, this 1s a picture of me with\nAlbert Speer and Alma Trynor(ph) on the lawn. I should call it my Greek period, I had long\nsideburns and a black mustache, I had black hair then you notice.",
        "Q: Describe him __..",
        "A: And if I describe Albert Speer, if you talk about body language, the hand, he's sitting rather\nstiffly in the chair, leaning a little to the right, which is very typical, hands clasped, legs crossed, as\nmy legs were crossed. The difference in the two of us is that I have the whole type A finger up,\npointing a finger and asking a question and he, with almost a little bit of suspicion on the question\nand that was very typical. These pictures are not at all unusual, this was very typical about the\nwhole, well we didn't interview over 10 days, we interviewed I think six or seven days of the 10\ndays, we had to get to know him, we had to get to know the community, we had to talk about what\nwe were going to talk about without giving away the questions and so we were I guess six days or\nseven days out there. And the crew came in and we filmed. But if you look at the photographs of\nhim and if you look at any of the photographs of any of his interviews, the man was never relaxed.",
        "Q: And actually it's different from the photographs you see of him before the end of the war because\nhe looks very relaxed, often when he's with Hitler, if he's walking around showing some piece of\narchitecture.",
        "A: Yes, but if he's going to have an image, if he's going to make this image, remember he no longer\nis Hitler's number two man, he's no longer on the Russian front looking at the tanks, he's no longer\ndoing the architecture or running the armaments program, which was a huge program, the man did a\nremarkable job, considering the fact he had slave labor, but the man did a remarkable job in picking\nGermany up from the ruins of most of the bombing and actually turning out the tanks and the\nplanes. He was a very, very effective bureaucrat.",
        "Q: He clearly was very, very bright, the work he did and then even what he learned and studied\nwhen he was in prison. Were you ever intimidated by him in that sense, in the intellectual sense of\njousting about the truth with a man like that?",
        "A: No, I was never intimidated, but I think I knew all the time I spoke to him that I was going to get\nthe answers that he had well prepared. I was never intimidated because basically you have to\nremember that deep, deep down, there was the anger and the gut feeling that he still was Hitler's\nnumber two man, that it was an experience and it was an experience. I never, never forgot the fact\nthat I was a Jew speaking to Hitler's number two man on a very civilized kind of a lawn, you know,\ngoing in to lunch or dinner in a few minutes. It's a very weird, surrealist feeling. But no, I never felt\nintimidation. Nor was he the kind of man who intimidated. Which is another point. A lot of it had\nto do with him too. He was not arrogant. We think of some, particularly when we see the movies\nwith the Nazi arm bands and you think of the arrogance and the arrogance of the Gestapo and so on,\nthis was not the kind of man he was and he may not have even been that during the war, but I don't\nknow.",
        "Q: Just a moment ago we were talking about the emotion finally coming out, I don't know if it did at\none point and we got sidetracked, I want to just come back to that question.",
        "A: About his emotion?",
        "Q: No, your emotion finally coming out at one point or did it just?",
        "A: No, never. I was very careful never to let that emotion out, I could not.",
        "Q: No, afterwards, afterwards.",
        "A: Afterwards sure, it came out the moment I left. It came out as I discussed it with other film\nmakers, when I discussed how you handle a thing like this, was it handled properly, how do you\nhandle a thing like this where if you set up as we said at the very beginning, the structure of a Jew\nfrom the Bronx going to see Hitler's number two man. And nobody can ever answer it, about the\nonly thing everyone agrees with is that you have to keep your anger deep down, that you really\ncan't, and as he said, I, I, I obviously must have been very funny at some point because if he said I\nhide everything I feel behind a sense of humor, he knows or knew what I felt. I mean let's not kid\none another, he knew I was Jewish, he knew what I felt, he knew what I must have felt. So if he\nsaid a thing like that, just as I said, he hid everything he feels behind 20 years in Spandau. We both\nwere wearing the gloves.",
        "Q: And the mask.",
        "A: And the mask, yeah. Which in a sense is not the best way to get an interview, it's easier to\ninterview a doctor who's a neurosurgeon, ask him about brain surgery.",
        "Q: That's what I wanted to ask, I don't know if there's something we haven't touched on that we\nshould say about the interview, about the tapes.",
        "A: The tapes, there's nothing more I can say about the interview or the tapes, I would like to find the\nother two tapes, remembering that they also were accompanied by film and so it would be\ninteresting to see at this point if one of the questions you asked about came off on film. Was there\nany point where he showed any of this other reaction, emotion or whatever it may be, discomfort. I\nwould have to see the uncut film because even the cut film would only have the correct answers.\nBut in seeing the uncut film you would know because we went on I don't know how many rolls or\nhow many hours we had. In order to do 10, 10 minutes films, plus a film on the architecture in a\ntotalitarian regime, which was 10 minutes, you're talking 100 minutes of finished film. I don't recall\nwhat we shot, we must have had a truckload of film when we went back because we kept rolling\nthrough all these things. Today with videotape, it would be cheaper, but...",
        "Q: Yeah _ didn't you have to stop for the airplanes?",
        "A: Yes, well every time, every, one day when we were out there, we surveyed it for the first couple\nof days, it was perfect, the birds were chirping and the first day we were going to film, there was a\nstorm over Frankfort, we didn't know this, all we knew is a jet came over. Then another jet came\nover, then another and you know that, that's it for tape and I kept stopping the tape and stopping the\nfilm and he said, \"Oh,\" he said, \"whenever there's a storm in Frankfort, the planes circle over\nHeidelberg(ph). So for about two hours we had nothing but jets circling over Heidelberg(ph). Fora\nfilm maker this is death, this is terrible. Overall it's, look, it's been with me this many years, I still\nread about him, I still can't get enough about him. If I see him on television on some film about\nWorld War 2, I still sit up and take notice. Having lived in Berlin nght after the war, I know the\nVonSay(ph) house, I was very involved with that whole area. As a Jew in Germany, there were,\nthere were lots of problems. In fact, to show how it works, when Cheryl first came over and to\nshow my anger, we were living in Max Schmelling's(ph), Max Schmelling(ph) was a boxer, was a\nheavyweight boxer, who was the German champ, who was beaten by Joe Louis and in\nin Berlin and a woman came to the door. We had just received a package from\nthe States to supplement our GI rations, which were plentiful anyhow. And there were lots of\npeople there, there were lots of displaces persons. There were the camps, the DP camps and we did\nknow some DP's and we did go to the camps and we were very involved with them. And in radio, I\nwas involved with the documentaries. And there was a knock on the door and a woman came to the\ndoor and Cheryl came to the door and the woman said, \"I'm hungry, is there something I can have to\neat?\" And I said, \"No.\" And Cheryl said, \"You can't do that to somebody who is hungry.\" And she\nwent in and she got a can of salmon and she gave it to the woman. And we had our first big married\nfight, because I was so angry that they had starved people, that they had put them in gas chambers, I\nmean I don't have to go through the whole litany, they had done all these things and she said you\ncan't turn a woman who is hungry away. So obviously then and obviously even to this day, my gut\nfeeling 1s, I find it difficult to go back. I find it difficult to hear German spoken. I find it difficult to\nmeet someone of my generation who was in Germany in 1940, '41, '42. Can't help it. So in that\nsense I've come away with a very, an even stronger emotional feeling and my speaking to Albert\nSpeer is just one of those little bricks in that whole thing of building how I feel today and I would do\nit again, as I said to you before.",

        "Q: Any other memories about that, perhaps that your father might have had or your mother? Your\nfather might have still had family in Russia or any concern there might have been in the family for\nJews in general or specific people that you knew?",
        "Q: You enlisted, why did you, what were your reasons? Do you remember speaking to your family\nabout it?",
        "Q: What's OCS?",
        "Q: Mm-hm, if you want to talk a little bit about becoming aware of Nuremberg, you were in\nEurope, particularly what did people say about it, what were your thoughts about it and anything\nabout Albert Speer because after all, you eventually did interview him and we'll get to that, but in\nterms of having a background.",
        "Q: If you can go back to the hangings a little bit, set that scene, what about the first time that you\nwent and how often did you go and how many people were hung at a time and how long would you\nstay?",
        "Q: And your thinking about it in terms of not being disturbed by it was that these people committed\ncrimes and they had to pay for it?",
        "Q: Let's talk about that. In the interim, you became a film maker. I don't know if you want to sort\nof just quickly bring us up to that and then to the point where you got an assignment to interview\nAlbert Speer.",
        "Q: Talk a little bit more about how you felt when the woman from the publishing house said, \"I'd\nlike you to go\" and you said, \"No.\" I mean, why the automatic no? What was going through your\nhead?",
        "Q: How did you prepare yourself emotionally to meet him in a somewhat open way? And was that\nyour goal or did you say to yourself, well I'm going to have opinions about this man and I just, I'm\nnot going to get rid of them, I'm just going to put them to the side. How did you prepare yourself to\ndo that?",
        "Q: And who wrote down the questions and structured the interview? Were you involved in that,\nwas that your client, did you have a sense that there were any subjects that were skirted?",
        "Q: How did you come to understand how he differentiated between the two? Why did he stop you\nwhen you asked that question, say, \"No, I didn't say guilt.\" I mean, what was the difference to him?",
        "Q: What was he like when he showed you these drawings, did you sense pride or perhaps a bit of\nembarrassment, what was he like?",
        "Q: What about the mood and also the eye contact, what was that like for you and how did you feel\nafter a day, five, six hours of filming, how did you feel afterwards?",
        "Q: Did you have any sense of him having an inner struggle and perhaps say, being afraid of it\nalmost and saying no, I still have to believe that what I did was okay, or did you have a sense of that\ngoing on inside of Albert Speer?",
        "Q: Why do you think he did the interview, or why did he do, beyond perhaps the obvious reasons, I\nmean the man didn't have to do interviews, but apparently he did them somewhat frequently.",
        "Q: Did you get any sense of sadness ever from him? We sort of touched on that earlier, but I'd like\nto ask it again, about anything? Perhaps about his family? It was just what you're saying.",
        "Q: What you've said to me before our interview began, you can't imagine spending four years with\nhim.",
        "Q: How did the experience and perhaps not even immediately, but meeting him, spending those 10\ndays with Albert Speer, how did that change your understanding of Nazi Germany? Or perhaps of\none Nazi?",
        "Q: Can listen to him and decide for themselves 1n part.",
        "Q: And compare it with the interview with you.",
        "Q: I hear you talking, it's almost like a visceral thing inside of you, it's not necessarily something\nyou've, I mean obviously you've thought about it, but it's, you're talking about a visceral reaction\nfor instance, when you're in Germany.",
        "Q: Are you glad you interviewed Albert Speer?",
        "Q: Do you think that he had sat across from the table very often with Jews and answered questions?",

        "Q: Did you like anything about Albert Speer?",
        "Q: Do you think you learned anything from him? I mean, 10 days is a long time, you often go away\nfrom an interview with something.",
        "Q: What's the Jewish term?",
        "Q: It's a powerful feeling.",
        "Q: I mean it's not a feeling that was given particularly by your family, it really came out of your\nexperience as a young man.",
        "Q: Good?",
        "Q: Okay. I actually haven't asked you anything about this and I think there's probably some things\nyou can say about it. What sense did you get of Speer's relationship with Hitler?",
        "Q: Even though in your tapes you do talk about that point where Albert Speer gets sick and he\ndoesn't see Hitler for awhile and as he explains it, he's pulled out of his sphere of influence and then\nwhen he sees him again, something has changed. So even after that change, you don't think that he\nfundamentally changed?",
        "Q: He says in the interview that you did with him that he feels embarrassed, I think, he might have\neven said shame and he is very halting when he says this, at declaring his admiration for somebody\nwho became such a monster. So what's going on there, he's using the right terms for Hitler, he's\ncalling him a monster, but he's also saying that he really cared deeply about this man.",
        "Q: And you were there, you spent 10 days with him, so some of the information that you'd gather\nabout him are feelings and nuances about ways he said things and his body language, that sort of.",
        "Q: Did you understand Hitler any better after you'd done this 10 day interview?",
        "Q: Did Albert Speer ever bring up some of the delicate questions himself in a way to sort of pre-\nempt you, perhaps bringing up the issue of what he knew about the Jews, what was happening to the\nJews and when?",
        "Q: With the things he volunteered, just listening to you just say that right now I'm wondering, was\nhe just trying to show you just another slightly different angle so that perhaps it being more three\ndimensional for you? What's your thoughts on that?",
        "Q: Did he say anything that surprised you?\nEnd of Tape 1.",
        "Q: Was there a moment in the 10 days that Albert Speer caught you off guard, said something that\nsurprised you, perhaps even did something?",
        "Q: Do you think that, do you think that what you were just mentioning, that he's very bright, he\ncould have, he could have just been such a shining star in another country, another government, do\nyou think that might be part of where his sadness comes from?",
        "Q: You talk about how he sort of gave you what he wanted to, he'd thought these answers out and\nyet it seems that in a way, it's like his self portrait and that's revealing too, what he does want to say\nabout himself, Albert Speer and what he doesn't, that while you were, you feel that you weren't able\nto puncture it too much, it's still a self portrait.",
        "Q: You talk about burying your own feelings. Was there a time after the interview, in the day or\ntwo after, leaving Germany, or even a month or two later, when at some point the feelings surface\nand what was that like or, or did you basically just erase 1t somehow?",
        "Q: Definitely, I think you've just used a few words, but that image comes across very clearly, this\nman, who was rigid and his whole body was controlled. You are showing, you're pulling out some\npictures.",
        "Q: Describe him __..",

    "answers": [
        "Answer: Okay, Mel London, I was born in New York, I was born in the Bronx, as we used to say, in\nCharlotte Street, which is the famous area that Ronald Reagan stood in and said he was going to\nbring back and never did. I was born in 1923. At this point in 1996, I'll be 73 in August. My\nfather, excuse me, my father and mother were both immigrants, my father was born in Russia,\nactually in Lithuania and came over to the United States when he was 11 years old. He supported\nthe family, they lived on Rivington(ph) Street in the lower east side, he supported the family by\nbeing a professional boxer, something I never knew about until I was older and boxed at college and\nmy father taught me everything I knew and he never bothered to tell me that he had been a\nprofessional boxer until I read about it in a column one time and found out that he was pretty good,\nwhich is why he always was better than I when he taught me to box. He then went into the dress\nbusiness and for the rest of his life, until he was 83 and then retired and had to, because of health, he\nwas in the dress business. My mother was born in England and came over as an infant. So they\nreally came from a, an immigrant, both came from immigrant families. My father's background\nthough, was something that we were never able to really trace back, we don't know why we have\nthe name London, which of course was a taken name, in that coming from Lithuania there was\nanother name, but his mother, being far ahead of her time, ran away from her husband and ran away\nwith a lover. Now, for this happening at the beginning of the century, you realize is quite a rare\noccurrence and so the name was picked up somewhere and nobody ever knew where. I was brought\nup in the Bronx, I went to school in the Bronx, I went to city college and was interrupted by a war. I\nenlisted in the army in September of 1942 and was discharged in the summer, I think it was in\nAugust of 1946. So I spent four years in the army.",
        "A: Well I can actually remember the day that war was declared in September of 1939. We were still\nin the country, the family was just able, my father was just able to send the family away to the\ncountry so the kids shouldn't have to put up with the city and I can actually remember the, the war\nstarting. At that time I was 16 years old, so that there was a consciousness of a teenager. As with\nmost of the people here at that time, as I recall it, it was a distant thing, we knew the war was going\non, I mean, you, we heard about the bombings, we knew the war was going on, we knew that the\nrefugees were coming here or starting to come here, but very frankly knew very little about the\nnuances of it, we knew very little about the ships that were turned away, the one that went to\nHavana and was turned away. This came later. If I speak of it now, it's because of something that\nI'd read about, but at the time it was a war that was in Europe, you know, the war's in Europe again\nand I guess, particularly at 16 and being involved in track and girls and things like that, I really\nthought very little about the war. We followed it, you couldn't help but follow it, 1t was in the\nheadlines all the time. So we knew about the Magino(ph) line, we knew about the problems of the\nbombings of England and so on and until America entered the war, for us 1t was happening in\nanother place. We were not, at the time, as knowledgeable as we are now about what was\nhappening in the concentration camps and with the Jews. We knew of course, about Kristallnacht,\nwe knew about Hitler. In fact I remember as a child, listening to Hitler, I remember that they\nbroadcast here, in the United States, they broadcast some of the speeches and I remember, whether\nit was from Nuremberg or some other place, the absolute electricity of this man when he spoke and\nI must say I hear the patterns with some of the people we have around the United States now, you\ncan actually hear the patterns, you can hear if you've studied the patterns and the things they were\nsaid, without getting into the politics of the United States, you could begin to hear how he enthralled\nthe people. Later on I was to see Nuremberg, later on I was to see the stadium, later on I was to see\nthe films of all of these, these rallies, but we actually remember them and I can remember to this\nday, sitting in the little foyer that we had in an apartment in the Bronx and listening to this man.",
        "A: Well I think, without being religious Jews, we all, always did have and still do have a feeling of\nbeing Jewish. My father did not have family there. Yeah. So that we have always felt a very deep\nfeeling of Judaism without being religious Jews. My father did speak of other pogroms. He was\nbrought up in area where the Cossacks were very, very active and her remembers the raids in the\nlittle town of Puniaman(ph). I found out much later in life that I was one thirty-second Cossack,\nwhich was something that destroyed my brother when he heard it. We don't know where the great,\ngreat, great, great grandfather was the rapist or whatever it may have been, but we were one thirty-\nsecond Cossack. In terms of Europe, from 1933 say, until the war began and I was much more\ninvolved certainly, in listening, we really had very, as I recall, very little discussion about it. And\nthat may have been very normal in the family, I just don't remember very much.",
        "A: Oh yeah. I, as a matter of fact I enlisted because, there was a war, they were beginning to draft\npeople, my father had spent, I guess a year and a half or so in World War | as an infantryman. He\nwas wounded three times. The third time he was wounded they wanted to take his leg off because\nof gangrene. And that's an interesting story in that he then refused to sign the paper. And he\nwouldn't sign the paper and the gangrene receded. He said, \"I came into this world with two legs,\nI'm going out with two legs.\" The gangrene receded. My father, from 1918, never went to a doctor,\nuntil he was 83 years old and hurt himself working in the dress business, a bolt of cloth had fallen\non his wrist and I made him go to the doctor and the doctor said, \"Well Mr. London, when was the\nlast time you visited a doctor?\" He said, \"1918.\" And the doctor said, \"Well, you're none the worse\nfor it.\" My father said to me, \"Don't ever get in the infantry. Do anything to get out of the infantry.\"\nAnd he had gone through three wounds and the trenches and of course, as every soldier he only told\nfunny stories about how his mother sent potato pancakes overseas, you know and they arrived like\nrocks, but he never told about the terror and the horror of it, but he did communicate to me that it\nwas pretty awful. And so I enlisted in, I actually enlisted in the enlisted reserve in May of '43 and\nwas in the signal corps, I enlisted in the signal corps. And that probably, that and also getting\npneumonia when my unit went overseas to go to D-Day, saved my life, I was in the hospital with\npneumonia, so. But that was the basic reason I enlisted was I knew I would be drafted, but I thought\nI might just as well enlist and get some kind of a background and that signal corps background in\nfact, was the thing that created a career for me later on. So I enlisted and I went to, into the army\nwhere several things happened. One, to make me understand more about anti-Semitism, because in\nthe Bronx particularly and I left the Bronx at 17 and pretty much at 19 I enlisted. In the Bronx you\ngot very little of it, the Bronx was very heavily Jewish. I was now coming into the United States\narmy, a democracy of sorts, or fighting for a democracy, where I began to come into anti-Semitism\nin both it's subtle and it's overt forms. It was obvious if you were going to be in the army you were\ngoing to get it. I mean the anti-Semitic jokes that suddenly started to be told around me while\nsomeone turned and says, \"Well, I don't mean you, I don't consider you Jewish,\" when after all, I am\nJewish, is one thing. The second thing was that I, after two years, went to OCS. I had gone all the\nway from...",
        "A: Officer Candidate School. I had gone from private to PFC and then they busted me back to\nprivate because they didn't have enough room for a PFC you see and I decided I was going nowhere\nafter two years. Luckily I was teaching in school, I was teaching at officer, at officer school as a\nprivate and a PFC, I was teaching colonels and generals and like an idiot I kept volunteering to go\noverseas with them. I wanted to go to New Guinea, I wanted to go to Europe and nobody would let\nme go, I was one of eight people who had a top secret clearance with the United States army,\nteaching this course, so nobody would let me go. I finally decided the only way to get out of this\nwould be to go into Officer Candidate School. So I applied for Officer Candidate School and again\n, In speaking of the, the anti-Semitism in the army, I was in a company, I was first sergeant in a\ncompany of 250 officer candidates. There were 13 Jews and two blacks and I, as first sergeant, was\nallowed to pick my roommate. You see, the barracks were made up and if you've seen barracks,\nthey were made up of 60 beds, double decker and one squad room. The squad room was where\nthere were two beds and the first sergeant and one other non-commissioned officer would be in the\nsquad room, so you had a private room. And so I had to become very friendly with a man from\nWashington D. C. named Bob MacNeil(ph), who happened to be one of the two blacks and having\nbeen brought up on the Bronx, I mean I was on a track team with all kinds of people, it made no\ndifference to me and he was the only guy who seemed to understand inner city thinking and was\ngetting the same kind of battering from the others that I was getting, so in front of a company of 250\nmen, the man was Lieutenant Coyne(ph), Lieutenant Coyne(ph) said, \"Mr. London,\" I said, \"Yes,\nsir.\" He said, \"As first sergeant you can choose anyone you like to spend the next three months in\nthe squad room with you\" and I said, \"Mr. MacNeil(ph) sir,\" so in front of 250 men, I picked one of\nthe two blacks, in 1943 or '44. This was pretty much unheard of. Two things happened, several\nthings happened. Number one, the day before graduation, 12 of the 13 Jews were washed out of\nschool, I always say, quite by accident, 12 of the 13 Jews were washed out and one of the two\nblacks. The only two people left of that entire group starting, were Bob MacNeil(ph) and me. At\nthe dance, at the graduation dance, Cheryl, who is my wife of 50 years now, as you know and I\nknew then, I met her when she was 17 and was still in college, came to Fort Monmouth(ph) to\nattend the dance and Bob had a friend, a woman named Lua(ph), attend the dance and they had\ndance cards in those days, you actually had a dance card so that you signed up for the dance and I\nsigned up for a dance with Lua(ph) and she was black also and I, I went on the dance floor with her\nwhen our turn came and that was fine and then came the time for Bob to dance with Cheryl and as\nshe got on the floor with him, the floor emptied and all the colonels sitting up on the balcony looked\nlike they were getting nauseous and they were leaning over and Bob said, \"Do you want to stop\ndancing?\" You got to remember, this is in the 40's and she said, \"No.\" And they danced. Nothing\never happened, I was then assigned and then came an interesting thing. For two years in the army, I\nwas assigned to black troops. I went down to the south and I trained with black troops, I went\noverseas with 4000 black troops. I went to a black replacement depot. I was then shipped to a\nreplacement company, picking up wire behind Mauclauck's(ph) third army, the 258 signal light\nconstruction company, which is a black company. I said to a black friend of mine, \"I have a feeling\nthat after that incident at, in OCS, they put N on my service record for Negro.\" She said, \"Maybe\nthey put nigger lover on your service record, NL.\" And that was, but it turned out to be one of the\ngreat, great army experiences. I mean, if you had to have a great army experience, this was it. So\nall of this comes as a background of meeting middle America in all of this and being much more\naware of how our own people felt about Jews, about blacks. I mean, being so isolated in the Bronx,\nI guess I, it was another opening experience. Now, then when I went to Europe and I was there\nabout the time of Nuremberg, I did not see combat by the way, I was very lucky on that, for four\nyears in the army, never to have seen combat was very lucky and again I thank my father for having\nbeen in the signal corps and taking, oh there was one funny thing by the way, which may or may not\nhave anything to do with this but when I graduated from Officer Candidate School as a second\nlieutenant, I was sent back to the school again as a student, where I had written the examinations\nand I had taught for several years, which is a typical army thing. I was now a lieutenant taking a\ncourse with examinations I had written. I did very well. In fact on one I think I got one question\nwrong once because I, I sloughed. When I went to Europe with the occupation forces then, I went\nthrough Belgium and then on 40 and eight trains out to, to Graffenau(ph) in\nBavaria, with the 258 signal light construction company. I began to become much more aware of\nseveral things, number one, of course by that time I was aware of what the Germans had been\ndoing, I did see Dachau after the fact, I knew all of this existed. I never met a Nazi except once,\nthough I was firmly convinced that everybody had been. Nobody admitted it, which I think will\ncome to pass when we talk about Albert Speer. The one person who admitted that he had been a\nNazi and a member of the Nazi party I hired as my driver in Berlin. He was the only honest man I\ncould find and therein hangs a tale when you talk about what happened at Nuremberg, what\nhappened to the people who claimed they never knew what had happened. I went back to the\nUnited States in 1946 for what we laughingly call rest and recuperation because I got married and\nCheryl and I spent 60 days here on honeymoon, went to Washington to try to get her over and then\nshe came over as the first of what she laughingly calls the dependents. She then spent two years on\nEurope with me in Salzburg, where I was station manager of a radio station, KOFA on the\nAmerican Forces Network and then went to Berlin with her as Program Manager of American\nForces Network, Berlin. And we spent the two years, we were there during the airlift and the\nRussian blockade. Things, as always happened, it's, when you're in a situation, it seems to be a lot\nless important or a lot less threatening than it is to people who are reading about it in the\nWashington Post or the New York Times. And though we were blockaded and we did have an\nairlift when the Russians turned the power off at 11 o'clock at night, we lit candles, 1t was that\nsimple. We flew out in 1948 on C47 planes, with our German Shepherd on our laps, you see and\nthen came back to the States. So this was the story, essentially condensed, about these years. Do\nyou have any other questions on this?",
        "A: Very good question because a lot of what my feeling were with Albert Speer later on and my\nexperience with him had to do with the things that had happened then. I was aware of Nuremberg, I\nknew what was going on at Nuremberg, I followed it very, very closely. So a lot of what I, I felt at\nthat time, or a lot of my experience at that time had a lot to do in turn with my feelings about Speer.\nNow I was not day to day involved in what was going on at Nuremberg. I knew what was going on\nat Nuremberg, I passed through Nuremberg at the time of the trials, I knew the trials were going on,\nI saw the tanks outside, I knew what was going on at Nuremberg, however, at that time an\ninteresting thing happened, I was still in the army and I was in Salzburg and Cheryl was due to\ncome over and we were setting up, we had a , akind of a castle with a moat type\nof thing, where we had eight Americans and 12 German servants, Austrians, I thought it would\nalways, Cheryl said she thought it would always be this way, you see and, and one of my best\nfriends was a man named Dixie Howell. Dixie Howell was a member, is a major, is a member of\nthe engineers and I guess I was angry at what had happened, I realized that if Germany had won the\nwar I would be dead, I___. And so one day, since he was the engineer, he used to build the\nscaffolds to hang the people who were found guilty of massacring unarmed American soldiers. SS\nmen, people like that and I used to spend the morning watching the hangings. That is one of the\nmost interesting things in terms of what it's done to me today, am I for the death penalty or against\nthe death penalty, how could I stand there in the morning, at six o'clock in the morning on the dock\nand watch people hanged, you see, and not care? The eye for an eye, I don't know. But that had a\nlot to do later on, with when I was asked to do the Albert Speer interviews, because if I could spend\nthose mornings, I obviously had a deep seated anger and hostility and a feeling of vengeance, to be\nable to stand and watch people hanged, whom I didn't even know, I mean these are not even like the\ngreat murders that we read about in the United States today, to watch people hanged and to have no\nfeelings while some of the soldiers who were there as honor guards, would faint. And my feelings\nthen, if I could go back to that, in fact I did some drawings and sent them to Cheryl, I went there and\nI would draw the hangings. Sure, I was 21 or 22 years old, it's not an excuse, it's just that that's what\nit was, I've thought about that often and as recently as the last couple of weeks in talking about death\npenalty and eye for an eye and so on and this came __ back to me and said, but if I stood there and I\nwatched this, how do I feel now? So Nuremberg was going on through this time and I know what\nthe, I of course knew even then what the results were, I knew when they were hanged, I knew about\nGoring taking the pills and committing suicide. I knew all about that then, but it was kind of apart\nfrom other things, this was we had won the war, we had the trial, we would hope it would never\nhappen again and look what's happened. And I, Albert Speer I didn't even know. I knew Goring, I\nknew Goebbels, I knew Himmler, I knew all of the names I should have known. Speer was a non-\nentity to me, if you had mentioned Albert Speer to me at that time, I probably would have said,\n\"Yeah, isn't he, isn't he the minister of armaments, maybe.\" And I say that in 20/20 hindsight, I\ndon't know. At 21 or 22 years of age, it's hard for me to tell you now.",
        "A: I only went to three, maybe four and then, as with everything else, I mean it's, it isn't a, terrible to\nsay, a novelty, but essentially it's, you know, remembering the time, remembering what we had just\nbeen through, it was a part of, a part, death was a part of life and remembering or, I remember there\nwas another thing and you'll be talking to people who were dealing with refugees, Europe was in\nturmoil, this was not the way it 1s now, you did not get on trains, the trains had no windows, people\nwere trying to find other people. If you traveled from one place to another, people were crowding\nonto planes, I saw, I saw, this is something that just came back to me, I remember GI MP's shooting\ninto the air to keep people from getting onto the GI car because the other cars were so crowded\nwhere people were going from Frankfurt to Berlin, from Berlin to Nuremberg to find, to Munich to\nfind their relatives. Remember, everybody was a displaced person, including the Germans. And so\nyou went from, from place to place as an army person and you had your own cars, all of with the\nwindows bombed out. My first time to Vienna I sat, in the middle of the winter, with windows,\nwith four blankets around me. I mean this was the way people traveled. When you look in context\nof what Europe was at that time, where when the train stopped and people got off and relieved\nthemselves at the side of the tracks and got back on the train, these were pretty terrible times, so a\nhanging was part of life in this whole thing. Now, how often did I go, I can remember three, there\nmay have been a fourth and I stopped. I didn't get a kick out of it, I went because it was something\nto go to. There was a courtyard. It was a very, very dimly lit courtyard. There was a scaffold in the\nmiddle and there was always, interestingly enough, whether I call it an honor guard, but a guard of\nGI's who were standing at the side, as I recall there may have been 10 or 12 in two rows and they\nwere the witnesses to it and the, the sentence was read out in both German and English, it must have\nbeen in English too, because I remember what they were and there would be, a typical one would be\nsomebody who had taken two GI's prisoners and had, had killed them, had shot them and was found\nguilty by a court and was hanged. Then the hoods were put over their heads, there were usually two\nat a time, both trap doors were sprung at the same time, there's a priest and then I guess the thing I\nremember always is the bodies being put in the coffin and one person being too log for the coffin\nand I would leave. It took half an hour. And then probably went to breakfast. I mean this is the\nway it was, you see. So in a sense this was as cold blooded as anything else that's ever been done,\nbut it was again taken as part of what the daily life was at that time, you had trials, there were trials\nall over Germany. In Bavaria I went to trials with people who had done, I can barely remember, I\nremember doing drawings of a priest who was brought up on trial and the people pleading for him\nand I used to send these drawing back to Cheryl, I still have the drawings. You went because this\nwas how Europe was coming out from the war.",
        "A: Yes and at the same time that you knew that a lot of Americans had committed crimes. I mean\nthey were not the only ones who shot prisoners and I guess the people who say we, you won\ntherefore, do have a point. At the same time we won therefore, thank God, you see. But I guess,\nyou know, I guess that it all came back to me later on, when we started to discuss Nuremberg and\nwhen we started to talk about my going to interview Albert Speer.",
        "A: I became, actually I became very quickly a radio announcer, a sportscaster, learned enough about\nsports and met enough athletes to hate sports and went into disc jockey and then into television and\nthen by accident in 1956, standing on the corner of 69th Street and Madison Avenue, I met my\ncompany commander from World War 2 and he said to me, \"What are you doing?\" I said, \"I'm a\ntelevision director.\" And he said, \"Why are you in television, why don't you do film?\" And I said,\n\"Well, I don't know.\" And he says, \"I own a film company.\" Interestingly enough, during the war\nwe hated one another, now we're in civilian clothes and he offered me a job in his film company,\nthat's how I became a film maker. I teach at NYU and I have told my students that's how you\nbecome a film maker. Can you imagine if I'd been on 70th Street and Madison Avenue, or 68th\nStreet and Madison Avenue, I would not be in film. I became a documentary film maker. I became\ninterested in the documentary, never interested in the feature, mostly because of meeting I guess\npeople you'd call real people. If you do a film on hospitals, you're going to actually be in hospitals,\nyou're not going to build sets. I really, though I did do a lot of dramatic things on television, like\nplay of the week, I really, never really enjoyed working with actors, I always enjoyed working with\nreal people and finding out about them and I have a curiosity and so I became a documentary film\nmaker and in 1963 was nominated for an Academy Award for a film on Parkinsonism and aging\nand then aging has been a subject of mine for a long time, I've done consultations on it, I've done\nseminars and I've been consultant. But basically I've, I've worked in 60 countries, my wife has been\nalong on almost all of them as a part of the company. I have a curiosity, I do have a curiosity and in\n19, I guess in the mid-70's, I don't remember when Speer's book came out but it was in the 70's,\nInside the Third Reich came out and I was called by McMillan, a woman at McMillan by the name\nof Alma Trynor(ph), who also, incidentally was Jewish, which has something to do with it and the\nbook was coming out and she said, \"Let's have lunch\" and we had Chinese lunch and she said we'd\nlike you to go overseas and interview Albert Speer. By this time I knew a lot more about Albert\nSpeer, I mean, not a lot, but a lot more. By this time I was now some years away from the whole\nthing and I had not read the book, she let me read the, I saw it in manuscript, I did not see it in the\nfinal book til later, saw it in manuscript and they had wanted to do a series of films to put Albert\nSpeer on record about a great many of the things that he had written about in the book. I did not\nknow at that time that there had been a lot of changes made from the German edition, I found this\nout much later. And when she asked if I would do it, one would think I would have jumped on itt,\nactually I turned it down. I turned it down and I said, \"I couldn't do it, I can't go back to Germany, I\nhave great problems when I do go back on business.\" And I had been back several times on travel\nfilms and on documentaries. \"I really would prefer not to go to interview Albert Speer.\" And she\nsaid, \"Well when in your life would you have a chance to meet and interview Hitler's number two\nman?\" And I said, \"Well I guess I never would.\" And now the curiosity begins to take over, right,\nyou're a film maker, a documentary film maker and you're going to find out about this and then it\noccurred to me that there's a very weird, almost surreal feeling about going to interview a man who\nwould have had you killed or have worked you to death if he had won or if I had been in Europe.\nAnd I couldn't resist it. I said, \"Yes, I will go.\" And at that point I read the book again, I did all my\nresearch and reading about Nuremberg again, I found that I was going to go and I would have to\nreally set my mind to the right attitude. I could not go there with the attitude that I wished he'd had\nhung, which I had, but if I was going to get anything from him, we would now have to have a kind\nof a hands off, polite attitude. I had no idea what he would be like and so I went back to\nHeidelberg(ph) with Alma and we spent 10 days with Albert Speer.",
        "A: Well I probably, I probably laughed when I said no, I mean it was a very strange kind of a\nrequest. I seldom on a job have said no. I have said no on films where my ethics were involved.\nWithout saying what side I'm on, but on some of the great issues of the world, such as abortion, the\nVietnam War and so on, I had refused films. I refused this on an emotional basis, that I really,\nnumber one, did not want to promote his book. Number two, there's the gut feeling that I'm\nuncomfortable in Germany and that's basically it, you know. I guess though, that the, the whole\nidea of, as she said, meeting someone who was Hitler's number two man, overwhelmed everything\nelse and I decided I would go. But basically I think I've always had a feeling that if I sold one more\ncopy of that book, I'm sorry I did. On the other hand, I'm all for people writing what they feel and,\nyou know, and we have that now even with the David Irving book, though Saint Martens(ph) should\nprobably never have taken it in the first place, the, the title, the David Irving book is on Goebbels\nthe one on Goebbels, which is a Holocaust revisionist, he's the great Holocaust revisionist. I have\nno problem with him writing, I can't stand the man, but you see what I'm talking about, no problem\nwith the book coming out, but why am I publicizing the book? At the same time, perhaps I could\nget some of the answers to which I had always felt I would like some answers and understanding\nalso this was going to be a bright man, this was going to be a man who had really thought about\nwhat he was going to say and that can come later, we can talk about that, because I have many\nfeelings about that. So I went.",
        "A: That, it's again, talking to yourself and saying you know, what is your attitude going to be and I\nhad done enough interviews to say, okay, for the moment, though I have an emotional context in\nthis one, I am just not going to ever show hostility and by the way, there is later, we'll talk about his\nreaction to me and my reaction to him, after ten days, because he was very perceptive about how I\nfelt and I was very perceptive about what he was doing. So it was a hands off thing, I mean it was\nno Albert-buddy, Mel-buddy thing, you have to understand that and that too is a part of our\nrelationship that we can talk about. I arrived in Heidelberg(ph) and my client Alma arrived there, I\nthink that day later or the next day, I don't recall, but the first thing we were to do was to meet\nAlbert Speer at the hotel and we were to go to dinner. And I was excited, in a strange way, I mean\nafter all, it's if you'd said you're going to meet Adolf Hitler I would be excited in a strange way.\nThis was not just meeting somebody who was the president of a corporation. I came down from\nthe, from my room, Alma was still up in her room. I came down from my room and I was sitting in\nthe lobby when he came in with his wife Margaretta and I'll never forget the reaction of the staff.\nThey absolutely were enchanted with this man. This is after the war, this 1s after Nuremberg, this is\nafter he got out of Spandau and the greeting of the manager could not have been more effusive. I\nwas introduced to him, we were, shook hands, I met his wife, we shook hands. Alma came down\nand we went to dinner. We went to dinner at a restaurant of his choosing, which again set the\npattern for all the time we were in Heidelberg(ph). Everybody in the restaurant was at least 50 or 60\nyears old. The owners, as I recall were at least 60 years old and therefore were of his generation.\nHe had chosen a restaurant where the greeting would be absolutely the top greeting that he could\nget, it was the great customer coming in of any restaurant, here is one. I, that was the first startling\nthing, was that these people still admired and probably adored this man and that was a little shaky,\ncontrasted with the fact that from that point on, everywhere else we went in Heidelberg(ph),\nwhether it was to have a Coca-Cola in a small bar or in the case of my client Alma, having her hair\ndone one day, every time we walked into a place, the young people walked out. The word got\naround town and this 1s ironic, the word got around town that friends of Albert Speer were there.\nThis Jewish friend from the Bronx was therefore ignored by most of the people who were in their\n20's and 30's. Alma's hairdresser walked right out on her. She had made an appointment, came in,\nthey said, \"That's Albert Speer's friend\" and they walked out. And so there was this incredible\nseparation of the, so there was this incredible separation of generations and very obvious one. Now\nI was there for 10 days and there were several times that we had dinner with him. Most of the time\nwe did have dinner at his home, which was also a strange experience. I met some of his children.\nHe seemed quite distant from the children too. I have a feeling from the short conversations, their\npolitics were quite different from his. I have a feeling also, after 20 years in Spandau, he had a\ngreat, great distance from the children, I think there was an emotional distance. That was a feeling,\nI mean, you never know. His wife Margaretta was the classic, well -meaning, polite German frau.\nShe never was close to any of our crew. She never was close to us, she did what she had to do and\nhe in turn was always polite, always wore a suit or a jacket, which meant I always wore a sult.\nThese days perhaps we'd be in blue jeans, but we always wore a suit and we spent the 10 days,\nalmost entirely, talking and filming and discussing the things we discussed on film. Hitler, Hitler as\nan artist and we did a film also later on, which I'll talk about, on architecture in a totalitarian regime.",
        "A: I set up the questions basically, with my client, but basically they were, they were based on the\nbook and also on questions that I had had all these years. I mean now, finally, I have a chance to, I\nhave a chance to speak to Hitler's number two man and I'm going to ask him questions, which\nbecomes a difficult thing, because he had spent his 20 years, let's go back to Nuremberg, the man at\nNuremberg and if I may, the question I had, if I go back, if I can just digress for a minute 1s why\nwas Goring sentenced to death, okay? Well, he was a very well known man and VonShurak(ph)\nand all the people there, why were they sentenced to death and why did two or three of them get\naway with 20 years on Spandau? My feeling then, as my feeling now, even after meeting him, is\nthat he should have been hanged too. But a very interesting thing came up, I asked him a question\nthat I think was the key and Gidda Serany(ph) in her book Albert Speer; His Battle with Truth,\nbrings it up, I think it's on page 167 and I would like to read to it to a moment. \"The New York\nTimes, when he died, printed an obituary and an editorial, both of which said Albert Speer was the\nonly man in Nuremberg to say he was guilty. Sitting on a lawn in Heidelberg(ph) I asked them the\nquestion which started, you were the only man at Nuremberg to say you were guilty. He stopped\nme at that point and said, I didn't say I was guilty, I said I was responsible.\" And for all the years I\nhave been going over the nuances between guilt and responsibility and obviously there is a big\ndifference and in Gidda Serany's(ph) book, she tries to, in a sense, come up with the answer as to\nwhy Speer did not get sentenced to death. In Nuremberg the most amazing thing happened and it\nwas a documentary the other night that covered it. Every single one talked about how he did not\nknow this had happened. Every single one said, well, no, yes he was doing his job, but all this was\nhappening beside him. Speer was the only man who admitted he knew something about it. \"Speer\nwas not,\" she says, \"Speer was not, as 1s sometimes claimed, the only one of the accused at\nNuremberg to feel and admit to guilt,\" by the way, she uses the word guilt and I questioned her on\nthat, \"but his admission, even though much too generalized, was remarkable, because he was the\nonly one, who by making it, risked fatally influencing the court's sentence, which for the others who\naccepted guilt, Hans Frank, Alfred Rosenberg, Olendoff(ph) was inevitable.\" He was the only one\nwho said he knew any of this was going on. He knew that slave labor was being used and in a\nsense, he was the only one then who stood apart from all of the others, because if you hear their\nexcuses, I mean this is absolute insanity that these people claimed that nothing went on, when a man\nwho was in charge of the concentration camps didn't know what was going on in the concentration\ncamps, so that, whatever the reasons, he was always quick to say that he had not admitted guilt, but\nresponsibility and I wrote a letter to the New York Times as you know, which covered that and it's\nalways been a very key point in my feelings about Albert Speer.",
        "A: The difference to him was that if he had said he was guilty, even at that point, even after the fact,\nthen he was as guilty of doing it, or having a guilt for having done it as all of the others. By saying\nresponsible, he was one of the people who had it happen. And I think there's just that thin level. In\nother words, I see it as very much the same, if you want to know the truth, but 1t was this very thin\nlevel that I think he felt, in his own mind. The problems that I had with Albert Speer and I must\ngive Gidda Serany(ph) for her book is that she spent four years with him, I spent 10 days. When I\nleft, and we'll go back to the other things later, but when I left, he asked my client how she thought\nwe had done and she said, \"Well, Mel's interviewed before and I think we got everything and as you\nknow, we were out to do a series of short films which would be put in the Huntington-Hartford\nmuseum.\" And he said, \"It's a funny thing about Mel,\" he said, \"he hides everything he feels behind\na sense of humor.\" And I said, \"Would you like to feel my feeling about Albert Speer?\" She said,\n\"Yes.\" I said, \"He hides everything he feels behind 20 years in Spandau.\" This man had had 20\nyears to come up with all the answers. You talked about Hitler and the Jews, Hitler hated the Jews,\nyou talked about anything about slave labor, he had all of the answers. He had written his book, I\nsaw the original manuscript, which was written on tiny scraps of paper about three inches wide and\njagged edges. Wherever he could get paper he wrote this entire book. I know also that the book\nwas changed substantially when it came from German to English. He had the 20 years, he knew he\nwould be talked to after he got out and he was difficult. I did, if I, was I able to break him down at\none point? Very interesting time, only once did I ever ...\nEnd of Side 1, Tape 1",
        "A: Yes, was there a time, is this running? Yeah, it's running. Was there a time that I felt I had\ngotten to him? I asked him what I thought was a very offhanded question, I said, \"How often did\nyour wife visit you in Spandau?\" And he said, \"Once a month.\" I said, \"And how often did your\nchildren visit you in Spandau?\" And he said, \"Once every six months.\" And I said, \"What did you\ntalk about?\" And that is the only time I saw emotion on that man, he started to tear, I could actually\nsee an emotional reaction and he said, \"What do you talk about with someone you love,\" and 1t may\nbe on the tapes that I, \"what do you talk about with someone you love when you see them only once\na month for a few hours or once in six months, once a year or six months for a few hours?\" Other\nthan that the man had, he was gracious, he answered all the questions, his English as you know, was\nexcellent and then we had some interesting experiences. We went through the questions and later\nwe cut the little , we had some interesting experiences, one afternoon he said, \"I\nwould like to show you some of my home movies\" and I said, \"Oh, how marvelous Herr Speer, let's\ngo in and look at some home movies.\" And so we went into his living room, it was a rather nice\nhouse by the way, the house was on a hill in Heidelberg(ph), it was a family home and they'd had\nfor I guess many years. The only problem with it was when there was a storm over Frankfurt the\nairplanes used to come over and circle and you couldn't record. But aside from that we sat on the\nlawn with the birds chirping and we went inside and we went to look at the home movies. And he\nshowed me the home movies of Albert Speer and Adolf Hitler inspecting the tiger tanks on the\nRussian front. And I was a little startled be this because I mean home movies are home movies but\nthis 1s watching his trip with Hitler to the Russian front. Later he said, \"Would you like to see some\nof Adolf Hitler's drawings?\" And this was toward the end of the visit, we went to inside and again\nhe took out all these drawings. Hitler was a terrible artist by the way, terrible. The drawings, and a\nfascinating thing happened, which kind of leaps forward, Alma decided that she would take the\ndrawings back to the United States and put them up on the walls during the exhibition at the\nHuntington-Hartford Museum, which was then at 59th Street and Columbus Circle and that we\nwould have a demonstration or an exhibition of Hitler's drawings. So she arrived at Kennedy\nairport, I had gone off without her and she arrived at Kennedy airport, she tells me and customs, she\nwas carrying them under her arm and Customs said to her, \"What do you got there?\" She said,\n\"Adolf Hitler's drawings.\" And they said, \"Oh, we've had enough wiseguys like you,\" you know,\nand they passed her through. But again, the drawings were shown at Huntington-Hartford Museum.\nWe also did a film which was not planned, that I wanted to do and I don't know where those films\nare, possibly McMillan(ph) has them, I don't know if McMillan(ph) still 1s the McMiullan(ph) it was\nthen, but somebody must have those films. But we did one film that for me was the most\nfascinating. His interviews were fine, I mean, I got as much as I thought I could get, but there was\none that we did where he was really in his element. I asked him, as Gidda Serany(ph) asked him, as\nmany reporters asked him, how he could work with this monster, I mean how could you be a\nmember of Hitler's group and work your way up and he came up with a very interesting answer and\nI guess in all fairness, you have to accept it. He said, \"How would you feel if you were a 29 year\nold architect and the head of state had asked you to be his architect?\" He said, \"You're very proud\nof the head of state,\" he said, \"remember, this is...\" And this is all before the war really got under\nway, this was all in the early days and as a 29 year old, if you look at the people who follow the\npresidents, who follow the congresspeople, look at all your young people, some of them are really\nvery arrogant. I've seen people come in to an airport and say, \"Yeah I want a car because I'm with\nJimmy Carter's entourage.\" And they're 22 years old going on eight, you know and you can\nunderstand at 29 this man was suddenly recognized by the head of state. So we went to the\ndrawings that he had done and we did a film on architecture in a totalitarian society and I think the\nthing that amazed me 1s if I was startled by Hitler's drawings, which were so bad, I was even more\nstartled by the scale of everything that goes on in a totalitarian society. Going back to the\ndemonstrations at Nuremberg in the 30's, with the torchlights, and I did see that, that stadium, it's an\nincredible stadium. Going back to the stadium at Nuremberg, going back to everything they ever\nbuilt, which was always larger than the person, everything that Speer designed, which was going to\nbe in Berlin, right after Germany won the war was on a scale that belies imagination. For example,\na dome which would be on the Unterdinlinden(ph) and would hold 100,000 people. Just a dome.\nAnd then the Unterdinlinden(ph) would now be made into a military avenue of about 48 lanes wide,\nwith cannon on each side. Everything he showed me was totalitarian, was fascist. It's what\nMussolini did, it's what Hitler would do and this man involved himself in things that were beyond\nimagination in terms of scale. I mean a skyscraper's a skyscraper, when you talk about a dome,\nunder which 100,000 people can stand comfortably, you're talking about a pretty big dome.",
        "A: He would not have taken the drawings out if it were embarrassing. He took the drawings out\nwith pride, he showed them with pride. He showed them matter-of-factly. Speer was a very matter-\nof-fact man with someone like me. I remember him smiling occasionally, certainly, I remember\nhim being warm, but he showed pride in that. I mean, to show me Hitler's drawings, then he said\nMel must have a curiosity to see Hitler's drawings, which I did. So I would say there was no\nembarrassment about anything. Which gets back to that whole thing of guilt and responsibility\ndoesn't it? I didn't find any feeling that he was sorry for it. I certainly would love to have had him\nsay he was sorry they lost the war, but you, you'd never get this from him. He was very withdrawn\nin that sense but very bright and all his answers were there. I have not heard the tapes in a lot of\nyears, you have, recently, I sent them down without hearing them and at some point I think I'd like\nto hear them again. And I'm sorry two tapes are missing because I don't know which two tapes are\nmissing. If I find them, they'll go down. But the 10 days went very comfortably, shall I say? I\nremember another thing, I am a hugger, I mean you know, I am a toucher, I'm a hugger. Well, I\ndidn't hug him, but when we left, Margaretta was saying goodbye to the crew and she had really\nbeen a very nice woman, I mean you know, she wasn't, like my mother or my grandmother, she was\na nice woman. She took care of the crew, she fed us, she was at the table with us. She said very\nlittle. And so, impulsively I went to hug her and that's when I realized that this was really a job, I\nwas hugging a rod of steel. This was no woman who was going to hug me back. So whatever her\nfeelings were about this Jewish producer, I don't know, but that was, that, I always remember, I can\nremember it vividly, I can remember where we were because it was kind of a slap in my face that,\nbut I am impulsive that way and I hug people, I hug men I love, I hug women, I hug. Because I like\nto touch. But not there. He and I shook hands.",
        "A: That's a wonderful question because I think what I did is I think that after the day, I blanked out.\nI did not do, I could not have spoken to you after the interviews as I'm speaking to you now, 20\nsome odd years later. It was a job. I hate to say it that way because you know, it was my job, I did\nit, people use that as an excuse, but it was a job and if I was going to do the job properly, I had to do\nit as a professional. Otherwise I should not have taken the job. And so how did I feel through the\nday? I was interested, I was interested in what he had to say, the relationship was comfortable at\nthat time. At the end of the day I have, we went around Heidelberg(ph), we went to dinners, we\nreally never discussed it or if we discussed it I can't remember having discussed it in any depth now.\nBut all of the, the days were very comfortable days, the weather turned out to be great, it was June\nas I recall, the weather turned out to be great. He was always very, very charming and I thought\nmore about what questions I'd ask the next day but never did I ever feel like Gidda Serany(ph) did\nin four years in being able to break through some of this. The man could not be broken through.\nAnd whether he then eventually said or felt he was guilty as she says, he did not at that time. Did I\nfeel when I left there that they should have hanged him? Yeah. I feel it to this day. I think he got\naway with murder. For whatever reasons, he got away with murder. He was using slave labor. His\nexcuses for that of course, if you've heard the tapes are you know, this was a war effort, he had\nnothing to do with the day to day things in the factories, he had to provide people so they could\nprovide for the war effort. He was a loyal German, which he should have been. I guess probably\neven after this, I'll think of things that will come back now that I didn't think of 20 years ago.",
        "A: Yeah, I would never know what was going on inside of Albert Speer, he had learned to control\nthat and whether he did or not, I know that in future interviews, like in this latest book, he had\nlearned to back off where he didn't want to answer and even if you pursued it, he would go only so\nfar. Did he have an inner turmoil? I don't know, I don't know. I don't know if the man felt that he\nwas sorry he was ever convicted, he was sorry they had ever lost, I have no idea and I would never\nknow this of Albert Speer. He handled himself very well in those interviews. He did what he was\nsupposed to do, I did what I was supposed to do. If I had to do it all over again, I probably would\ncome up with even more driving questions than I did then because I know a lot more now than I did\nthen and it's very difficult to go into an interview like that as a documentary film maker, having\nstudied everything you can about it and still think that you've covered everything, you can't cover\neverything. There are the old, I should have, I could have.",
        "A: I think that they, I think a part of it, well first I think Albert Speer did his interviews partially for\nthe reasons that you kind of touched on a moment ago of being able to justify Albert Speer and his\nbackground and what he did. Partially because I think he was convinced that if you're going to sell\nthe book and, I mean this is a very pragmatic reason, that you're going to sell your book and you're\ngoing to convince people to go buy a book of, the number, several, 600 pages or whatever it was,\nyou have to do media tours, you have to do these interviews. I think his publisher had a lot to do\nwith this. I think the publisher both in Germany and McMillan(ph) here in the United States said if\nyou're going to do this book, you are going to have to do interviews. And he did a series of\ninterviews right after that for television and for radio and did them later on, there was a second\nbook, which I was not involved whit and I know nothing about. I had had just about enough at one\npoint, but I think that was it and I do believe that there was a feeling that he was now being\nrecognized. Remember Albert Speer also, if he'd been hanged, would have gone down with Goring\nand all the rest of them, that would have been it. Albert Speer came out at the end of 20 years in\nprison and had a chance to be rehabilitated, I don't know if it was that, but to at least to a person\nagain, in the society and with enough clout in the society to be interviewed by the press, to ask his\nopinions. I don't think in that sense it's any different from any of the people who came up 1n post\nwar Germany and were interviewed. I think he also was grasping and groping to try to find his way\nback to his family. I mentioned that the impression I got of his six children, all of whom were born\nbefore he went to prison and therefore didn't see him for 20 years except twice a year, were very,\nvery distant and almost isolated from him. I never got the feeling while I was there, in 10 days that\nthere was any great love, the kind of love you see, almost in a physical love, a touching or a kiss, I\nnever saw that. Now that may be only the Germanic thing and he didn't want to show it, so it's hard\nto tell, it's like you never know the inside of a marriage, but that was the impression I got. I got the\nimpression also that the man who came out of one of the worst of the fascist dictatorships in the\nworld had several children who were very left wing. And I'm sure this bothered him.",
        "A: That's interesting. If I were to put it, that's a marvelous question because I would say there was\nalways a sense of sadness. I don't know whether the sadness was created by 20 years lost without\nthe family, now back to the family. You have lost 20 years, you have come out of Spandau and\nyou've lost 20 years. I never got the feeling of a sense of joy, a sense of freedom, a sense of release.\nBut you're saying that now, if I had to put it in my own word, I think there was, over the 10 days, a\nsense of sadness. Even and a sense of propriety, of a proper human being who, when he went to the\nrestaurants, as I mentioned, was cordial, was pleasant. But was never hi Joe, you know, how, nice\nto see you, ever, always proper. Just as the suits, between the two of us, both of us wearing suits,\nwere always proper. We never called one another by first name. We never touched more than a\nhandshake. I always had the underlying feeling of 1f had won I would be dead, but I pushed it aside,\nI had to. And interestingly enough, on the day to day discussions, it was just like speaking to you, it\nwas fine, it was we talked. I mean he wasn't going to do anything to me and I wasn't going to\nstrangle him and so we put that aside right at the beginning and we were going to try to get to the\nbottom of something to which we really never go to the bottom, bottom and never would and\nnobody ever will, about Albert Speer. The closest one who got to it was Gidda Serany(ph) and even\nthere you get very little of Albert Speer. Course when he wanted, when he was annoyed or upset,\nhe let her know it. And she spent four years with him.",
        "A: Oh well, yeah, in speaking of Gidda Serany(ph) spending four years with Albert Speer, I am\nalmost overwhelmed at the professionalism and the bulldog grit 1t must have taken to do this, in four\nyears that, I could not have spent four years with Albert Speer. Well, I'm also type A, so that, you\nknow I, 10 days is quite enough, that's usually... The thing that she did that I could not do and that I\nthink is critical to any, any journalist or any film maker who interviewed Albert Speer, has to realize\nthat none of us could have done what she did, which was to question him and then move to the\npeople he mentioned in his answers to find out if A, they were true, if B these people had seen them\nand remembered them as Albert Speer remembered them and then to go to the archives and find out\nif either one was telling the truth. This takes a lot of time and a lot of, of, of digging and she did it\nand I admire the book as a result. I mean the book is overwhelming and I've written to her as you\nknow and I've gotten an answer and I would like to meet with her, in a shared experience, mine 10\ndays and hers four years. I would like to find out how she could spend four years there, doing it.\nAnd in reading the book and I read it carefully, I'm back in the middle again, reading it carefully, I\njust quoted from page 167. I'm fascinated by the fact, the determination and the fact that she kept\nup with this thing and questioned everything down the line, including the wives and the children of\nsome of the people who had been at Eagle's Nest and Bertasgarten(ph). By the way, I did visit there\nwhen I was stationed in Salzburg and I, Bertasgarten(ph), Hitler's Eagle's Nest home, or his hideout,\nthe Eagle's Nest in Bertasgarten(ph), there they had destroyed the SS barracks right below and the\nEagle's Nest was still there and I remember going through saying, well Hitler was here, you know,\nthis is where Hitler was. That was kind of an unreal experience, this was speaking to the man. But\ngetting back to your, your said, did I see a sadness, I think yes, I think deeply there was, there was a\nsadness, there possibly was a feeling that people didn't quite understand why he had done some of\nthese things. Witnesses saying if you were 29 and the head of state asked you to be his architect, it\nwas, it was an experience I guess that any of us, particularly the Jewish boy from the Bronx would\nalways carry with me and I do. And when I found the tapes, I could not believe, I didn't know what\nhad happened to them and there are still two missing, I'm going to find them. I don't know where\nthe films are, I would like to have them. Actually, what I would like to have is the original, the\nuncut film. The 10 minute cuts are nothing more than 10 minute cuts. I would like to find the\noriginal film somewhere. I don't know if that's possible, it's too far away. Film was probably\ndestroyed.",
        "A: Let's put it this way, I've never understood Nazi Germany, just as I have never understood, I have\nnever understood the kind of destruction that went on in Nazi Germany, almost the engineers at\nwork. I can more easily understand Biafra, I can even understand Vietnam, I can understand\nNigeria, I can understand tribal warfare. I don't like it and I think it's horrendous, but I can\nunderstand this because people do react this way. Bosnia is the classic example of the problems of\n100 years back. But when I look at Nazi Germany and I haven't changed my opinion there, I felt\nexactly the same way before and I feel exactly the same way now. The anti-Semitism, anti-\nSemitism in the first place I find difficult to understand. I find anti anything of a group or a race,\ndifficult to understand. But when you look at what Nazi Germany did, with something like, was it\n600 concentration camps or places of death, when you look at the use of slave labor, when you look\nat the deliberate way in which they did this, I still don't understand it. I had known people who left\nGermany, who are not Jewish, because they understood that this was a country they couldn't live in.\nIf it happened in my country, I have often said I probably would have to leave. So has it changed,\ndid it change my feeling about Albert Speer? Before I met Albert Speer, I had no real feeling of\nAlbert Speer. He was a person. I knew he was, in fact I knew him as the Minister of Armaments, I\nhad forgotten that he was an architect, I then, as you begin to read you realize, yes, yes, yes, I know\nhe is. I had no feeling about him before. My feeling about him now 1s a rather distant one. I don't\nfeel any great warmth toward, toward him and that experience. I still can't understand how and why\nhe did it. In terms of Nazism and what happened in Germany, I cannot for the life of me understand\nhow any country, how the people in any country could do what they did and how they did it and the\nmethods in which they did it. This is not meeting someone in war, it's not even the SS man killing\nan unarmed American soldier or an American soldier in Melai(ph). This is something that is\nbeyond my understanding. So in that sense there's been no real change. I still have difficulty when\nI go back to Germany. I still have, I must admit this, I have difficulty in the following way. I've\nhad to go back to Germany on several, and this had nothing to do with the younger Germans\nbecause what happens to me is when I go to a hotel lobby and I see people my age, I'll be 73 in\nAugust, when I see people my age sitting there in suits and drinking and having a great time, I\nmentally put SS on their lapels. And I'm sorry, this is the way it is and I've spent a lot of time there\nand I don't have to like everything and I don't have to like everybody. I'm glad Germany's a\ndemocracy, I'm glad the east and west have gotten together. I don't have to like going back. I find\nmyself very uncomfortable there, I find the German language very uncomfortable. I mean this as\nhonest as I can be with you. I have not forgiven and I certainly don't forget. And what I feel is that\nplaces like the Holocaust Museum must open everywhere and that the younger people particularly,\nmust go there and must see it. Because with the revisionists, remember, those of us who have met\nAlbert Speer, those of us who have been in the concentration camps are going to be dead and then\nthe revisionism is really going to start, how can you believe all those dead people? And this is not\nfar-fetched, this is what will happen. And so all of these places are important because there are\npeople like me who have not forgotten. And it's not a matter of forgiving, I don't have to forgive,\nyou see. I also don't have to forget. So I have not changed my feeling about Nazism and Albert\nSpeer is a story that took place and if I can have offered something to the Holocaust Museum in the\ntapes, so much the better, that's good because I think that these memories have to be kept and I think\nthat people have to be able to go there and hear them.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "A: Yes. And listen and decide and read the books and thank goodness for the books. And\ninterestingly enough I find that these books are now starting to come out so many years later, I\nwould have expected they would have been 10 or 20 years before. Of the new Goldhagen(ph) book\nwhich talks about the guilt of all of the normal Germans, the people who used to go and watch\nexecutions. But you know, that's interesting, too. Let me not just take off on that because there are\nparallels. _Timmerman(ph) in his book and the torture that he underwent in Argentina has a\nhorrifying discussion with his torturer, who does his torture as a normal job, then says to\nTimmerman(ph) after the torture, \"Listen, my son wants to get into college, do you know somebody\nwho can get him into college?\" So if we talk about the banality of evil, you know, Hannah\nArons(ph) great statement, this happens in a lot of places, there are torturers and was I any different\nwhen I watched the hangman and I went away with no feeling about them? So people are capable\nof this. But nobody has ever done it on the scale of the Germans. Nobody has ever actually built\ngas chambers to put people in, had collected hair and has collected teeth and has collected shoes.\nAnd has had this virulent anti-Semitism, that is bad enough in the world as it is, but has done\nsomething like that that is inconceivable. So I don't have to forgive them. I also don't have to like\nthem.",
        "A: Absolutely it's visceral, I mean, the intellectual, let me give you an intellectual thing.\nIntellectually I would say, well yes, you know, after all it is that time, there is a new generation,\nwhich there is and there were good people and there were bad people and it's done and gone and I\ncan't do this. Of course it's visceral. It's visceral also because I, I see the stirrings in other areas. I\nsee the stirrings out in, with the Michigan Militia, I see the stirrings with the anti-Semitism that's\ncome up. I see the stirrings with a presidential candidate who is anti-Semitic, whether you like it or\nnot, he can say he's not and he has Jewish people on his staff, he's anti-Semitic. If you see these\nstirrings as a Jew, you always are aware of it. You're always careful, that this is something that can\naffect you, this is something that can kill you. It has happened. And so my only reaction can be\nvisceral. Because we have the antennas out, as the Blacks, the African-Americans have their\nantennas out to everything that's done, whether it's getting, can't get a taxi in New York cause they\npass you by, to the anti-Black statements that are made. You always have your antenna out as an\nAfrican-American. Well you always have your antenna out as a Jew. And so my reaction to an\nAlbert Speer or my reaction to Germany is totally visceral. And I'd be lying if I said that well I, you\nknow I have to be intellectual about it now, I can't. But as I said to someone, I was interviewed on a\ntravel show once, I had done a travel book and I've done a lot of travel films and somebody said to\nme, \"What's your favorite country?\" And I said, \"Italy, I love to go to Italy, I had an office in Italy\nfor five years.\" And he said, \"And which countries don't you like?\" I said, \"Well I don't think it's\nup to me to tell you on this program which countries I don't like.\" And I never did on the program,\nbut the point is, having worked in 60 countries, I can like 59, I don't have to like all 60 countries and\nthat may be very unintellectual, it may be very visceral, that's how I feel and I think I've got to\nremember that and I want the Holocaust Museums to make people remember what these people did,\neven if they're all dead, that it can happen again.",
        "A: Oh, absolutely. Wouldn't have missed it for the world, even though I turned it down the first\ntime, I mean, oh of course, I'm, 1t was another part of the experience you have as a film maker, it's\nanother part of the experience you have as a documentary film maker. It's the kind of thing where\npeople say, \"Oh you've led a very exciting life.\" I say, \"Well it's not over yet, you know.\" And\nwe're going to China and Japan next year on a job. But yes, it's, I'm glad I met Albert Speer. I'm\nglad that I have worked in countries where there have been dictators, not quite as bad as Hitler, but\nwhere I have been able to see first hand what went on. Whether I got anything more out of my\nvisceral feeling since Albert Speer? Not really, but that was a part of the experience and I am very\nglad that I went over there.",
        "A: Possibly some reporters, I don't know. He knew I was Jewish, certainly. I mean if he didn't\nknow, somewhere along the line I'm sure I told him about my Bar Mitzvah, you know. But I have a\nway of letting, but he knew and he knew Alma was Jewish, so he had in essence a Jewish client and\na Jewish producer. The rest of the crew were all American and German and Austrian. But yes, I, I,\nI think, I think that he had at some point, I don't think at this point it made any difference to him.\nYou know, we did not come on as Jews if there were other reporters who did interview him, but at\nthe same time, deep in my gut was always the feeling that I am Jewish and this man was number\ntwo in Hitler's staff.",
        "A: No, I don't think I represented Judaism, you know, I, it's a good question, no, no I don't think I\ndid and I don't think it was there, you know, you're, I would say that, at this point I look at it and\nsay, yeah it's kind of interesting that a Jewish producer was sent to interview this man who had used\nslave labor and who would have been dead if he'd won, I, we go back to that whole thing that sent\nme over in the first place. But I never represent, I can't represent Judaism, Judaism is diverse, as\ndiverse as, as any of the religions, so and I'm sure there are Jews, cause I read there are Jews who\nhave forgiven at this point, say we must move on. And whether that's there way of handling it or\nnot, that's fine. My way of handling is that we never forget.",
        "A: Did I like anything about Albert Speer? I, that's a wonderful question in that I can't think of\nanything I liked as a very positive thing, but I can't think of anything I disliked. He was, as I say,\ncomfortable with me, at least outwardly. He was a gentleman. He was a very gracious host. I\nmean we wanted for nothing while we were there. He did take us through the town to the places he\nknew. He answered the questions, he never balked. I didn't dislike anything, he was one of the\neasiest interviews in the sense of a day to day relationship over a period of 10 days. What did I\nlike? I can't think of anything that I would say I really, you know I really liked. No one's ever\nasked me that question.",
        "A: What I think I learned is that a great many people in my generation were not at all sorry for what\nhappened. The reaction that these people had. I mean I was fairly aware of it before then, having\nworked in Germany several times and having lived in Germany after the war, that the people of my\ngeneration were not at all sorry that it happened, were not at all guilty about what happened.\nMaintained and retained many of their feelings, probably anti-Semitic and so on, about the Jews,\nabout Germany. I learned also first hand, that the younger generation, for the most part seem to\nreject that. They may not want to hear about it, but they seem to reject it. The fact that the word got\naround that we were quote friends of Albert Speer and they'd walk out, meant that that there was\ntheir visceral reaction to somebody who was there as a quote friend of a Nazi. So that even in my\nmind I have a great division where I go right down the line and say there is a whole group that I\nhave, I may not like listening to their German because it reminds me of that time, but I don't hold\nthem responsible for it. I find that I have difficulty even today, meeting people of my generation in\nGermany or who are Germans and are traveling. I get the gut feeling, over and over again when I\ngo a place like the Algove(ph) or I go to Spain and I see groups of Germans traveling, of my age, I\nget the immediate feeling and I must admit this, that while the Jews lie in their graves, there's a\nJewish term for that, they are out enjoying themselves. I still have that feeling and I resent it. Not\nmy feeling, I resent their enjoying it.",
        "A: Liktendred(ph), lies in, lies in, in hell. While the Jews liktendred(ph) and I, that's the feeling I\nget, it's the feeling I have wherever I go. I must tell you, in terms of my emotional feeling, if I go to\nGreece and there are groups of German tourists come in to a restaurant, my stomach knots. Now\nthat's, you talk about visceral, I have no intellectual feeling about it any more, I should actually pay\nno attention to it. So I am in that sense very deeply a Jew and very deeply involved with what\nhappened in the Holocaust and very deeply involved with what the Nazi's did and don't ever want to\nsee it happen again to anyone. But I still, if I, I have a job coming up where I may have to go back\nto Germany and I would like, frankly to have that country dropped from the group that we're going\nto and it won't be and I will be a good professional film maker again and I will go. It has nothing to\ndo with boosting Germany or anything, it just happens to be a business thing. But I have that\nfeeling and I make no excuses for it.",
        "A: Well it's, 1t comes out as you see.",
        "A: Yeah, I think it comes deeper than experience as a young man, I think it comes from I am\nconvinced that there is an ethnic depth in people. I'll give you an example. When I hear Middle\nEastern music and this includes Arabic, Israeli, any Middle Eastern music or Russian music,\nsomething deep within me comes to life.",
        "A: Good. Good feeling. I mean I happen to be one who can't understand why the Arabs and the\nJews fight. There is a very deep, Middle Eastern, ethnic level there so that I think, my wife Cheryl\nhas the same feeling, I'm not the only one. Or she'll look at me and all of a sudden I stiffen with\npleasure because the music gets to me. Now that didn't come from my background as a child and it\ndidn't come from what my parents taught me because except for my Bar Mitzvah, I really was not a\nvery good Jew. But I am a very good Jew as a Jew because that's how I feel. So there is an\ninstinctive Judaism there, don't ask me to explain it.",
        "A: Very close, very close. All the photographs, all the photographs that he has, all of the\nmemorabilia, his home movies. I had a feeling that Speer, although I notice Gidda Serany(ph) says\nat the beginning was not part of the inner circle, I got a feeling that he was very close. And I have a\nfeeling that he respected the man as the leader of his country and I believe he always did and I don't\nbelieve he ever changed his mind, through the end of the war.",
        "A: No, I don't think he fundamentally changed. I think this was the, this was the dynamics and I\ncan't speak too you know, authentically, but I think it's the dynamics of what happened. Remember\nthis whole inner group were always close to Hitler. You move out for awhile like in any corporate\ngroup and then you move in and you've got to work your way back in again. I think he always\nrespected Hitler. I don't know how he felt at the end of the war, I don't know how he felt before he\ndied but my feeling was that he was close.",
        "A: See, this is the point, when anyone interviews a man like Albert Speer. Is he saying this because\nthis is politically correct? That was a term that was not around then. Is this the answer he expects\nme to have? I mean suppose he said to me and this is only instinctive about his feeling about Hitler\nthrough the time. Suppose he said to me, \"Oh this man was a monster, I hated him at the end, I'm\nglad he was dead.\" Do you think I could believe it for one minute? Not when he was involved with\nthe armaments almost right up until the last minute. Not until he was the heir apparent, the heir\napparent to Hitler if Hitler had been killed. No, I have a feeling that we're back to his coming up\nwith the answers of 20 years in Spandau. That's a feeling. But then again, I'm a very prejudiced\nman about that whole thing, so you know, in...",
        "A: Well the body language was pretty much the same throughout. Almost rigid, comfortable.\nComfortable in his answers. As I say I think he thought about them through all that time. But in\nterms of body language, look, he was, there was always the gap between us, let's face it, I mean\nremember, always the business suits with the ties. I was doing my job and he was answering the\nbest he had thought about answering through all these years. I think he had come up with the\nanswers to every one of the questions that I asked him and possibly not what Gidda Serany(ph) did\ncause she really went in depth, but that any reporter coming there would have asked him. I found\nno great revelation in anything I read later on.",
        "A: No. You know, I, it's, if, no I didn't understand Hitler any better and I don't think that I could\nhave gotten that out of this. Probably is one of the world's great monsters, I put with him all the\nother people who were with him as just as monstrous. It was not only Hitler, they had to go along\nwith him, they knew what was happening. I not only don't understand Hitler any better, I don't\nunderstand the virulence of the entire group around him, including Goebbels, including Goring,\nincluding VonShurack(ph), including all of them. No, I said before I would never understand the\nNazi movement. Oh, I understand then, I know, understand what it did, I understand everything for\nafter World War 1, I understand all of the things that happened. I hear a great many of the things\nhappening today. The populist thing about look what they did to you in the war and look what the\ncorporations are doing to you, this was Hitler's whole schtick and I understand it after the war. I\nunderstand also the thing of uniforms and Nuremberg and so on. I can even understand them\nforming the army, I can even understand them having a war. What I can't understand is what they\ndid to 20 million people, deliberately.",
        "A: No, as I recall, now remember this is recalling. As I recall what, the pattern was pretty well set\nin that unless there was a question he never really volunteered anything, except to bring me in to see\nHitler's drawings and the architectural things and the home movies, these were volunteered. In\nterms of the answers to the questions, not really. Now I have not heard the tapes in a while, you'd\nhave to hear that, I really don't remember. I remember it being a pattern, I had my list and this is\npretty much what we went to.",
        "A: Well it's hard to say. Again, I can't remember all the nuances of the time I was there. He was\nprofessional. It's the best I can say.\nTape 2",
        "A: Not in terms, I don't remember anything, I'm sure there must have been some times and I'm sure\nthat some of the questions, but you asked the question, the first thing that came to mind was\nsomething that has been made very available at this time and in fact I saw it not too long ago on a,\non a documentary about the war, which had nothing to do with Albert Speer or Adolf Hitler. And it\nhad to do with the problems that came up in armaments during the end of the war. The Germans\nwere the first to develop jet planes, or to develop flyable jet planes, which would have totally\ndestroyed the armada's of the allies, considering everything was a prop plane at the time, the flying\nfortresses and so on and the P38's and Hitler did not trust the jet engine, it had no propeller. And\ntherefore, up until the very end, he refused to let them use it. At the very end he let them use it. By\nthat time though, Speer could not develop enough planes to make any difference. But there was a\nfascinating thing, it's like somebody developing the atomic bomb before us, so of all the things that\nhe mentioned to me, that sticks in my mind as something that I had not heard of and now as I say,\nhas become part of the historians, you know, the historians whole group of books and films and so\non. But that to me, surprised me. Other than that, in terms of the answers, remember I said my\nfeeling was, through the entire time that he had come up, I could not come up with a question except\nasking what he said to his wife and his children, in the visits to Spandau, that he would not have\nthought of before. A very bright man, a very bright man. Under some other form of government\nwould have been a brilliant executive possibly, I can't say architect because I was never very\nimpressed with his architecture as I was not impressed with Hitler's drawings, but was bright\nenough, was presentable enough, was articulate enough. Certainly spoke English quite well. Could\nhave been a really well known, great man in some other country. But he never really, we never\nreally threw one another. He never really threw me, I had my questions, I always had to keep my\ndeep feelings buried, which I did and he in turn had thought of every single one of the answers.",
        "A: Possibly, that's something that you know, I can't, if it were me, if I felt that way, yeah, I would, I\nwould say so, look at there but for the grace of God. Just as I say, if he had won, I'd be dead. Or I'd\nbe slave labor, yeah if he'd been, but he wasn't, he was a part of Hitler's entourage and he was very\nmuch, very much in favor with Hitler through most of the time. He was a part of the inner circle, he\nwas for a long time the second in command, if Hitler had died he would have gotten the, the, he\nwould have been head of Germany. It's a remarkable thing for a man who at that time was in his\n30's and then 40's. I asked him about Spandau you know, but basically I got the fairly standard\nanswers, he, it fascinated me also, was I guess one of the other things, surprised I mentioned that he\nhad showed me the original manuscript. If you could take pieces of torn out paper, just take about\n600 pieces of skinny, torn out paper, no more than three inches, with a tiny Germanic hand written\non it, then you'll know what the manuscript is, this whole stack of papers which he got out, I guess\ngot out through Margaretta(ph), but that was the manuscript of his book. So remember this, he was\nwriting that book while he was still in Spandau. The thing that also bothers me, I think, if I think\nabout it, and you say you know, what were my real feelings about him. Remember also that the\nbook changed in context from the German to the American version. The whole section on anti-\nSemitism was toned down. The whole, a whole, no, yes, well no, when you say after I did the\ninterview, no, they, it was being done while I was doing the interview, that book was not out, I only\nsaw the book in manuscript, but I had not seen the German version. But the German version and\nthe English version do not match, in several important places, because for the American audience,\nthey felt they could not be as strong in some of the areas. So now that gives you a kind of a\nsuspicion, both about Albert Speer and the people who controlled the publication of the book.",
        "A: Of course, this is what he wants you to think, this is what he wants you to feel, he certainly is not\ngoing to come out as a self proclaimed monster, which by the way I don't think he was. You see,\nyes he used slave labor and he may or may not have been anti-Semitic. Interestingly enough, I'm\nnot sure. He may have been one of those, those, apolitical people in terms of his anti-Semitism, I\ndon't know. Certainly he was not one of the virulent ones, certainly he was not a Goebbels. On the\nother hand, he was a part of the hierarchy and you know, the responsibility is there, it's like the\nresponsibility is there. When you have a doctor and the nurse is hostile to you, the doctor is\nresponsible. Well it's the same thing here, he's responsible. I mean he was a top man in this group.\nSo yes, he wanted you to feel, as anyone does, a certain way. He wants to present and to\ncommunicate to you how he, Albert Speer feels about it and come out looking pretty, at least fairly\ngood, not as a monster. Remember also, he was shrewd enough and he was smart enough not to get\nthe death penalty. And he had to maintain that too, he could not be one of the monsters that was put\nto death.",
        "A: No, I never erased it and the feeling did surface and after leaving, as with any reporter or film\nmaker, I would like to have had the 10 days again because there were places I think I was too kind.\nThere were places I felt and still feel that my follow up was not strong enough. At the same time,\nit's now 20-20 hindsight, I now know a lot more. In fact if I were to see him again, I don't want to\nsee him, he's dead, but if I were to see him again, I would have a lot more questions and a lot of\nthem would come from research that's been done by people like Gidda Serany(ph). I didn't have it\nat that time. Remember, he had just come out of Spandau a few years before or a year or two\nbefore. That's another thing that we've got to keep in mind, he came out of prison, he was a\nprisoner, he came out, he's now with the family, he's in Heidelberg(ph) where half of the town hates\nhim and the other half of the town puts the red carpet down. He's with his family, he'd not seen\nMargaretta(ph) for, more than once a month for 20 years. He'd not seen these kids who grew up\nwithout him, some of whom as I say I was sure was left, were left of center. And so, coming out of\nprison as any prisoner, aside from the horrendous things that were done by the Nazi regime, coming\nout as any prisoner, he had a lot to get used to. And even getting used to sitting down at a table with\na group of film makers and his wife and his children and having a dinner. Always at the head of the\ntable, very stiff. Very, very stiff.",
        "A: I, yes, I am pulling out the pictures, look at any of these. Look at me, pointing my finger and\nlook at him answering the questions. Here you have an even better one, this 1s a picture of me with\nAlbert Speer and Alma Trynor(ph) on the lawn. I should call it my Greek period, I had long\nsideburns and a black mustache, I had black hair then you notice.",
        "A: And if I describe Albert Speer, if you talk about body language, the hand, he's sitting rather\nstiffly in the chair, leaning a little to the right, which is very typical, hands clasped, legs crossed, as\nmy legs were crossed. The difference in the two of us is that I have the whole type A finger up,\npointing a finger and asking a question and he, with almost a little bit of suspicion on the question\nand that was very typical. These pictures are not at all unusual, this was very typical about the\nwhole, well we didn't interview over 10 days, we interviewed I think six or seven days of the 10\ndays, we had to get to know him, we had to get to know the community, we had to talk about what\nwe were going to talk about without giving away the questions and so we were I guess six days or\nseven days out there. And the crew came in and we filmed. But if you look at the photographs of\nhim and if you look at any of the photographs of any of his interviews, the man was never relaxed.",
        "A: Yes, but if he's going to have an image, if he's going to make this image, remember he no longer\nis Hitler's number two man, he's no longer on the Russian front looking at the tanks, he's no longer\ndoing the architecture or running the armaments program, which was a huge program, the man did a\nremarkable job, considering the fact he had slave labor, but the man did a remarkable job in picking\nGermany up from the ruins of most of the bombing and actually turning out the tanks and the\nplanes. He was a very, very effective bureaucrat.",
        "A: No, I was never intimidated, but I think I knew all the time I spoke to him that I was going to get\nthe answers that he had well prepared. I was never intimidated because basically you have to\nremember that deep, deep down, there was the anger and the gut feeling that he still was Hitler's\nnumber two man, that it was an experience and it was an experience. I never, never forgot the fact\nthat I was a Jew speaking to Hitler's number two man on a very civilized kind of a lawn, you know,\ngoing in to lunch or dinner in a few minutes. It's a very weird, surrealist feeling. But no, I never felt\nintimidation. Nor was he the kind of man who intimidated. Which is another point. A lot of it had\nto do with him too. He was not arrogant. We think of some, particularly when we see the movies\nwith the Nazi arm bands and you think of the arrogance and the arrogance of the Gestapo and so on,\nthis was not the kind of man he was and he may not have even been that during the war, but I don't\nknow.",
        "A: About his emotion?",
        "A: No, never. I was very careful never to let that emotion out, I could not.",
        "A: Afterwards sure, it came out the moment I left. It came out as I discussed it with other film\nmakers, when I discussed how you handle a thing like this, was it handled properly, how do you\nhandle a thing like this where if you set up as we said at the very beginning, the structure of a Jew\nfrom the Bronx going to see Hitler's number two man. And nobody can ever answer it, about the\nonly thing everyone agrees with is that you have to keep your anger deep down, that you really\ncan't, and as he said, I, I, I obviously must have been very funny at some point because if he said I\nhide everything I feel behind a sense of humor, he knows or knew what I felt. I mean let's not kid\none another, he knew I was Jewish, he knew what I felt, he knew what I must have felt. So if he\nsaid a thing like that, just as I said, he hid everything he feels behind 20 years in Spandau. We both\nwere wearing the gloves.",
        "A: And the mask, yeah. Which in a sense is not the best way to get an interview, it's easier to\ninterview a doctor who's a neurosurgeon, ask him about brain surgery.",
        "A: The tapes, there's nothing more I can say about the interview or the tapes, I would like to find the\nother two tapes, remembering that they also were accompanied by film and so it would be\ninteresting to see at this point if one of the questions you asked about came off on film. Was there\nany point where he showed any of this other reaction, emotion or whatever it may be, discomfort. I\nwould have to see the uncut film because even the cut film would only have the correct answers.\nBut in seeing the uncut film you would know because we went on I don't know how many rolls or\nhow many hours we had. In order to do 10, 10 minutes films, plus a film on the architecture in a\ntotalitarian regime, which was 10 minutes, you're talking 100 minutes of finished film. I don't recall\nwhat we shot, we must have had a truckload of film when we went back because we kept rolling\nthrough all these things. Today with videotape, it would be cheaper, but...",
        "A: Yes, well every time, every, one day when we were out there, we surveyed it for the first couple\nof days, it was perfect, the birds were chirping and the first day we were going to film, there was a\nstorm over Frankfort, we didn't know this, all we knew is a jet came over. Then another jet came\nover, then another and you know that, that's it for tape and I kept stopping the tape and stopping the\nfilm and he said, \"Oh,\" he said, \"whenever there's a storm in Frankfort, the planes circle over\nHeidelberg(ph). So for about two hours we had nothing but jets circling over Heidelberg(ph). Fora\nfilm maker this is death, this is terrible. Overall it's, look, it's been with me this many years, I still\nread about him, I still can't get enough about him. If I see him on television on some film about\nWorld War 2, I still sit up and take notice. Having lived in Berlin nght after the war, I know the\nVonSay(ph) house, I was very involved with that whole area. As a Jew in Germany, there were,\nthere were lots of problems. In fact, to show how it works, when Cheryl first came over and to\nshow my anger, we were living in Max Schmelling's(ph), Max Schmelling(ph) was a boxer, was a\nheavyweight boxer, who was the German champ, who was beaten by Joe Louis and in\nin Berlin and a woman came to the door. We had just received a package from\nthe States to supplement our GI rations, which were plentiful anyhow. And there were lots of\npeople there, there were lots of displaces persons. There were the camps, the DP camps and we did\nknow some DP's and we did go to the camps and we were very involved with them. And in radio, I\nwas involved with the documentaries. And there was a knock on the door and a woman came to the\ndoor and Cheryl came to the door and the woman said, \"I'm hungry, is there something I can have to\neat?\" And I said, \"No.\" And Cheryl said, \"You can't do that to somebody who is hungry.\" And she\nwent in and she got a can of salmon and she gave it to the woman. And we had our first big married\nfight, because I was so angry that they had starved people, that they had put them in gas chambers, I\nmean I don't have to go through the whole litany, they had done all these things and she said you\ncan't turn a woman who is hungry away. So obviously then and obviously even to this day, my gut\nfeeling 1s, I find it difficult to go back. I find it difficult to hear German spoken. I find it difficult to\nmeet someone of my generation who was in Germany in 1940, '41, '42. Can't help it. So in that\nsense I've come away with a very, an even stronger emotional feeling and my speaking to Albert\nSpeer is just one of those little bricks in that whole thing of building how I feel today and I would do\nit again, as I said to you before.",
