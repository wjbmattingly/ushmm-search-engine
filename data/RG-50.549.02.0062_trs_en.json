        "Question: So, we\u2019ll just have a little conversation so that I can test the level, and you can\ntell me about your neighborhood a little bit, and how long you\u2019ve lived here, and I\u2019Il just\ntest your --",
        "Answer: Okay, I moved in here originally, in January, about two or three, of 1981. And\nI\u2019ve been living here in the same apartment, since. I bought a apartment here before it\nwas built, I bought it off a plan, and that\u2019s where we spent all these years now since,\nwhich it means over 20 years hence. Is coming through good?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: I\u2019m just going to listen to it. Okay, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff\nand Toby Herr collection. This 1s an interview with Mr. Harold Zissman, conducted by\nArwin Donohue, on February 28\", 2000. And this is a follow up interview, it\u2019s a post --\nfocusing on post-Holocaust era -- 1t\u2019s a follow up interview to an interview that we\nconducted with Harold Zissman, in 1995. That was a Holocaust era interview, conducted\non videotape. And we\u2019re going to start by reviewing some -- some things that -- that took\nplace immediately following the war, and then move on to what happened in the United\nStates, which will be our focus today. So, one of the first things that I wanted to know\nwas when you -- in the last interview, that Randy Goldman conducted with you, it wasn\u2019t\nvery clear to me what liberation meant, and whether there was a moment when you were\nactually liberated, when you were recognizing, okay, I\u2019m not responsible for being\nplatoon commander any more, and I\u2019m -- I\u2019m a -- now I have to decide what comes next.\nCan you describe that a little more?",
        "A: Of course. That was a very hard thing at the time, turning the clock back to the era.\nThe forest sort of served as -- as a safety, away from the people who wanted my life, sort\nof -- without a gu -- good reason. Therefore, my separation from the forest was a very\nhard one to do. The commanding officer that particular time, when asked by two of my\nfor -- comrades who were in my platoon, ask me why am I not going out to join them,\nand see where I can enlist myself to do a jo -- to work, well he told them, \u201cWhere do you\nthink Harold is going to go? Is he going to enlist himself to be in the police? No, I don\u2019t\nthink I want him to be there, I want him to be in a more important job.\u201d\u201d\u00bb Whereupon, not\nso long after that, I\u2019m getting an assignment to go to -- and take some people that they\nimmediately drafted, between the ages of 18 through 45, to join the Red Army\u2019s armed\nforces. And be for the fact that the railroad tracks between Grodno and Marstee, were not\nready, because we, the partisans, the yesterday\u2019s destroyers of that, to s -- to not let the\nGermans be able to carry on their war, now had a problem of going back to see that\nthey\u2019ve all repaired, so the Red Army could be able to bring in their supplies, as well as\nmanpower. So, they were drafted and I could -- well, was ordered to organize a -- another\nsquad because I could -- I did not have enough to make a platoon, because everybody\nwas trying to get organized, and they [indecipherable] me to do it. So I must have gone\nabout maybe 10 or 12 guys, and with that I started, and I reported to duty. And with\nbayonets open, we were marching them like they were prisoners, much rather than they\nwere the people who are willing to serve, and go to fight the war, to liberate the rest of\nthem, be the end of Germany. It made a bad impression on me, but an order 1s an order, I\nhad to do it. So, freedom at that particular time to me, I did not even get taste of the\nfreedom yet. I can only explain myself that those same people that I have to guard -- I\nhad to guard at the time to take them, still had in them that anti-Semitism, although I\ndidn\u2019t do anything against those people. They couldn\u2019t accuse me personally, but a\npluralistic way of hate, because I was a Jew, didna -- still was imbedded in them, and I\nfelt the non-safety there. It took us al -- it took us almost until we put them on the train,\nand we go -- and we were able to move, was almost a week before the train could start\noperating. And as soon we reached the old border between the U.S. -- between the Soviet\nUnion, and Poland, the KGB -- the army KGB took over command, and I was getting\npapers to be released with my squad that I had over there, and to go back to our -- well, I\nwas told while living, where the officers are going to be, the local officers. However, I\nwas told by my commanding officers, if I should return, and they will not be there any\nmore. The staff -- the general staff will be in Minsk, which was the capital of Belarus,\nand I am to report to any of those places, after my assignment will be done. Whereupon --",
        "Q: So we got some of that -- that -- we got the information about how you went to Minsk",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: -- in the first interview. I just wanted to clarify a little bit that -- how you knew, okay,\nI\u2019m not beholden to the partisan group any more. Now I have to just make my decision\nabout what comes next, and -- and I was trying to get a sense of what you were thinking\nyou -- you would do next, before you got 1n -- involved with the KGB.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s what it was at that particular time, our returning back to Minsk was used,\nsince I had papers to be housed, and to be fed. So it was sort of used like vacationing.\nAfter all, now we are free birds on ourselves. From my whole squad, I only remained\nthree of -- two of the former guys, which they were Belarus, and I was their command\npor -- before I was their platoon commander, and now they were with me. They were sort\nof more like friends that we knew during the war, and during the partisans, when I would\ncome in their settlement, they parents knew me, and as a matter of fact, I felt relief to be\nin their company, because relieve means secure. I was secure that no foul things could\nhappen towards me in that particular time. So, we all went to that particular time, I\nreceived my medals, well I -- well I already said, being on the train, and all of a sudden, I\nfound myself that I\u2019m going to work for the KGB, which this was the farthest thing of my\nmind that I ever expected to happen. But I am the -- took soldiering before, when I\nescaped the ghetto, and I figured I\u2019m continuing the same way. Besides that, I know the\nconsequences, what it would have been had I refused, and I would not want to become a\nKGB working person. However, when I came to Borontvitch, which that was sort of the\nre-region to where I was going to work, in that office there, and I passed all the tests they\nwanted me to know, I told them that I wanted to go now for a little bit vacation with the\ntwo guys that they enlisted themselves in the militia, and not in the KGB, because their\neducation was below mine, and therefore they wouldn\u2019t pass to go into the KGB. And I\nwanted to go back to their settlement. Besides, I wanted, by any chance of all, maybe\nthere was someone of my family, who by -- by any kind of way, survived, and if\nanything, probably that would be the place to meet them. On the other hand, I was\nseparated from the partisans, the Jewish partisans, who were natives of Darechen -- of\nthat -- of that city where the ghetto was that I escaped to the forest. I had my desire to go\nahead to meet them, because we were separated, since I joined the other part, which it\nwas in arvens, which I mean the paratroopers, with the General kus -- with General\nKustenko. So I was separated from all my past, sort of, in -- in spirit, as well as\nphysically, and I was anxious to go there. So when I put it out that I want to go for two\nweeks, I was granted, and meaning granted at that particular time, you had to have a\npermit, otherwise, without a permit, you could have been arrested easily, and who knows\nwhere to -- you could wind up. So -- and I came to the house of -- Volodya was the guy\u2019s\nname, and his cousin, and I was greeted like I would have been his brother, no | -- no\nless. His mother and sister were there with open arms, and we kissed each other, and\nhugged each other, that we survived, and came not injured. And his mother gave him to\nchange of her clothing, she gave me. And the next thing, we went that evening cut -- in\nthe fi -- in the settlement there. A guy was playing on the harmonica, we were dancing,\nthe boys and the girls, and to me, while we started to drink, 1s the usual way it would\nhave been at the time, and it was -- 1-it was not regular vodka, it was homemade brew,\nsort of, to speak. And I don\u2019t know, no matter what I drank, somehow or other, I didn\u2019t\nget drunk. My mind was so busy think -- to think, where do I go from here? And it\u2019s not\nany other way that I could explain this, I just did not have a resoluting, I want to go and\ndo this, I want to go look to do this. In a way, I felt sorry for myself immediately. Look,\nhere [indecipherable] he had a place to come, he had a mother, he had a sister, he had\ncousins, he had -- what about me? I did not have anyone in -- or anywhere\u2019s to turn, to\nsay to myself, I\u2019m happy. We met, we are good. But everything was sort of like it would\nnot have been real. It just like a fantasy that you dream about, or stuff like this here. So I,\nagain, was very mixed. I worked with him a whole week on the farm. It was potatoes they\ndo, because at the time of year. It\u2019s September when we are talking about, and at that\nparticular time, farmers pick the potatoes there, and so on, because the other grain was\nalready picked. And really, the need for help was in -- in a very bad way, because his\nmother an-and -- and his sister could not attend to it. So in a way, I was a handy helper,\nhel -- helping hand there. And to me at that particular time, a certain fantasy got into my\nmind again, why would I want to continue as a Jew? And immediately I saw a -- a\ndifferent horizon, sort of, in a way of speak. Look at it. We both for the war, he was\nagainst Nazism, he escaped to the partisans because he did not want to be drafted to go to\nGermany, to work with the Nazis. But look what had happened to the two of us. I had no\none to come to, he comes back home. And he going and working, and coming at night,\nbetween meeting up with the boys and the girls. Like I say, a certain fantasy, I -- I call it\nthe fantasy, because real, I was not looking for that. So I must call it a fantasy got into my\nmind, and that\u2019s what I thought, who knows? Maybe I\u2019m going to get lost right now to\nthese new world, and forget about the world that I lived in. And come Friday, the whole\nthing came to a change, whereupon Volodya says to me, \u201cHarold, aren\u2019t you going to go\nto Darechen?\u201d Darechen meaning the city nearby -- not so nearby, but from where the\nghetto was. And he knew these partisans, these same guys from Darechen fought\ntogether. Where he says to me, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to see your Jews, over there?\u201d He all of\na sudden out of nowhere came out, while we were discussing -- I was discussing to\nmyself, what happens Sunday now? Their church was still on over there, 1t was not\ndestroyed, and what if he asks me -- I go with him on the farm, and work with him\ntogether. I associate in the same groups of people. What will it be, how will I feel if I\u2019m\nasked to go to the church with him together? And I did not know at the moment, so when\nhe start talking about, and using that word, you Jews, instead of using the word, aren\u2019t\nyou going go see our friends, the partisans, over in Darechen? You know what I mean, or\nmaybe naming someone? But he said you Jews. So I felt a separation going on, and I --\nall of a sudden I awakened like from a dream, and says, \u201cWait a minute now, I cannot\nhide myself.\u201d Oh, I cannot run away, because each sort of day is something that it isn\u2019t\ntotally open. And I immediately said to him, \u201cOf course I want to see, but you know how\nwe worked every day long hours, and hard work, how was I to disrupt you and me from\nthat work, and ask you about going to Darechen? But since you don\u2019t plan on working\nperhaps tomorrow,\u201d because Saturday -- I did not observe S-Saturday, so anything like\nthat at that time, because under the Soviets, religion was another part of life that you did\nnot practice. So I said to him, \u201cIf time permits you, I will be very happy that you give it\nto me, and I will also ask you to please let me go to the cemetery.\u201d",
        "Q: Before we go on, let me just footnote here that -- that you told this story in the first\ninterview, and -- and I\u2019m -- I\u2019m glad you\u2019re telling 1t again, because you\u2019re giving some\nmore details that are -- that are interesting, and that are helping to -- to clarify what was\ngoing on.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But -- but we should just probably move on from --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: -- from that area, rather than going into telling the whole story. I just wonder if you\nhave any more. I know you -- you went -- well, for one thing, I wondered if you -- you\ntold in the first video how you had -- how you had left, and Volodya.",
        "A: Volodya, yeah.",
        "Q: And did you ever see him again after that?",
        "A: I -- I did since we wound up work -- after all, after the two weeks were up, we were\nback in Boronivitch, he to the militia. We went on the same train, at the same time. But\nfrom Darechen, I did not return back to his farmland. I only told him, I says, when --\nwe'll meet at it -- because I had to go to Zelbo, which is -- was the name, to take the train\nand to go to Boronivitch. So we said we\u2019|l meet approximately the same time. It so\nhappened that we did meet on the station, and we went with the same train to\nBoronivitch, while he went to the militia. His cousin didn\u2019t go -- di -- wa -- didn\u2019t take\nthe job there, so he remained separately. He, as a matter of fact, volunteered coming back\nto the army, you know? And we met back in Boronivitch, but it was not any longer in\nBoronivitch that we met as quickly, or as frequently as we wanted. And another thing I\nwant to point out here, be for what he asked me, pertaining, as a I pointed out to the\nquestion, you Jews. I did not want to carry that as a stick, sort of to punish him with that,\nor asking him why did he say it, because in my mind, I saw the natural thing of it. You\nknow, other words, it\u2019s I and you, and he sort of was not ready to hear from me, or to see\nfrom me, that hey Volodya, what do you mean you, or this, that and the other, we are just\none, and I\u2019m working the same way. So I did not take up any time. So whenever I would\nmeet up with him, we meet -- we would meet again like yesterday\u2019s friends, and not any\ncriticism whatsoever, because I took it in my heart a justifiable way, the way he said it.\nHe didn\u2019t prepare himself to make a speech. He just said about the way he felt. So\ntherefore, I never criticized it, or take -- took it [indecipherable]. So yes they would meet.\nNow, I don\u2019t know whether I told you that I got married, after which -- in January, I don\u2019t\nknow in the previous tape did I mention about it?",
        "Q: Yes, you did.",
        "A: I believe I did.",
        "Q: You did.",
        "A: That on January five we got married --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- and the way I took in my hands, because I still was a reckless type of a person, even\norganized, and working the KGB. But certain instincts from the partisans, that you have\nto make decisions, still were left in me, and it was a hard time for me to get rid of it, that\nI\u2019m constantly under the saluting, and under the command, and -- and th-there 1s a\nprogram that I have to do. So the same thing happen when I get married -- when I wanted\nto go and get married. Three times I applied, and they didn\u2019t let me give, so I decided,\nhey, nobody\u2019s going to hold me back, and -- and later, when I come back they arrest me,\nbut the colonel comes, and releases me within -- and wants to put my commanding\nofficer there in -- in my place in jail, because he says, \u201cHe was legitimately that he three\ntimes asked you, and you answer -- why didn\u2019t you let him go?\u201d He says to him, \u201cI did\nnot have anybody to replace his work, he was doing the work for three people.\u201d So he\nsays, \u201cWhat did you do on those days that he was not here? When he was -- went away to\nget married?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201cit was very hard, you know, but I mean to manage.\u201d He\nsays, \u201cSo you see, you could have managed, you could have said to him, you can only get\nthree days, four days, two days, so therefore you are the guilty, and not Harold,\u201d and he\nasked me at that particular time, as I -- my name at the time was Grigory Grisher, they --\neverybody used to call me Harold, my name became in the USA. So -- and therefore, in\nmy heart, all this here handling, was already a premonition of how I will escape, because\nI -- I appreciated the Soviet Union, that it gave me the opportunity to save my life, as well\nas so many more other Jews, that it could save their life and not be annihilated by the\nNazis. But at the same time, I didn\u2019t think that I owe them my life since I didn\u2019t agree\nwith the Communistic system. Communism was a very strange bedfellow in my mind.\nEven they tried to ingrain me through the school, and so on, but I -- I-I just didn\u2019t --\ndidn\u2019t go follow that. So that particular time, the animosity that I build up in myself, of\nthe way the system works was already -- I was looking for that window, and especially,\nas I aforementioned before, when I went to register, and in the registration I find out that\nit -- being -- working with KGB I sort of -- not that I didn\u2019t think it couldn\u2019t happen, I\ndidn\u2019t believe that it would happen, because it was a -- an official thing, posted\neverywhere, that anybody who was living in Poland before 1939, and they wished to\nreturn back can do it. But all of a sudden, I was called in, and with a locked door, as\nanybody who wrote about authoritarian governments, or Communism the way, and the\nboss kept me from 10 in the morning til five o\u2019clock, and questioning me about every\nlittle detail, which I sense that he wants to find something wrong in me, so he could go\nahead. Although he did not have a good reason, if he wanted to jail me, he could. But\nsomehow or other, he wanted to make a goo -- case for himself, and he couldn\u2019t break me\ndown. That not breaking down gave me a fever. I don\u2019t know what I remembered saying\nthat, about all of that.",
        "Q: Yeah. No, we -- we do have this story on tape, and -- did you have something\nparticular that you wanted -- wanted to say about that, because you -- we did get that\nstory [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, if you have that story, so you know I escaped --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- and I escaped to Bialystok, which it was the first stop to Poland.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I later found out that a -- KGB had sent two guys, which both of them are still alive,\none in Israel, and one is in -- is -- is in the USA, that they were chasing after me to find\nme in Bialystok, and there, one day -- y-you know what I mean, from Bialystok I realized\n-- | met a friend of mine, and I wanted to go into city where -- in 1939, from where I sort\nof -- we -- we were chased out from there, because it became Third Reich, and finding in\nBialystok a friend that we went to school with together, he forewarned me, he says,\n\u201cHarold, please. You survived the war, why do you want to go back and get killed?\u201d\nBecause he mentioned me somebody who went into the city, and he did not hardly live a\nday before they killed him. And I must p-put in a note why that happened the way it\nhappened. After all, somebody took away our homes, somebody took away our business.\nThey did not want to have any witnesses to come back to claim it back. And the fact is\nwa -- I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t receive any money. All this time, while people got money from\nGermany, and I didn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t register til ma -- at the time, when 1952 was the\ndeadline. So therefore, I understood the situation why. I did not want at that particular\ntime, risk my life, and I listen to him, and realizing that -- since that it\u2019s -- what is going\non, I wanted to go deeper. And the reason I wanted to go deeper, I wanted to go a little bit\nmore close, I came there for to Lodz, which it was a big industrial city before the war.\nAnd it was not totally destroyed during the war, it was some left over there, because that\nwas the trend sort of -- some people, I met some more people over there that I knew from\nbefore, and we found out that\u2019s the place to go. While being in Lodz, I meet up the Major\nShpark, which it was his name, and he was the one also, who were after me to look in\nMinsk, because I was distrusted. To straighten up for the record was, that at that\nparticular time when I made my papers, the new papers, I no longer was Zucherman, but\nmy new name was Zissman, as I held to present. So, in other words, I had to change my\nname in order to get the documents from the Polish commission to transfer me. But under\nthe name of Zissman, there was no record for them to go and listen, or ask, so therefore\nthat\u2019s what it helped me. I don\u2019t believe I told it in the first recording, in that particular --",
        "Q: You did mention that too.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And I wondered if you had ever thought of changing your name back from Zissman\nafter you arrived in the States?",
        "A: I -- I was telling -- to tell you the truth, it was a grave mistake at that particular time,\nbecause I was so in -- I became to the United States, already had a child, and it\u2019s sort of,\nwhat is it, we\u2019re going to mix up a whole thing, you know what I mean? So to me it\nwasn\u2019t that far of my name, what -- what good 1s that going to me? And I remained with\nthat name, however, at any time I tell my story, I -- or I file applications, or so, I still refer\nto that my birth name was Zucherman, and -- and my regular name was Zissman, the\nadopted name was Zissman. And it\u2019s -- it became a joke to me. Z-Zissman from German\nmeans sweet, and Zucherman means from sugar. So in other words I always joke the\nsugar became sweeter, that\u2019s why I used the name Zissman, and that was not too far\nfetched, you know what I mean, to do it. So I left it the way it is. So, after, in Lodz,\nmeeting that Shpark, within a couple of days, I was in touched with a for -- with the\nformer fighters of the partisan, and this ma -- people who already had formed the\nZionistic party again, and the option was -- as they -- as it was called, the runners. They\nwere there, tha -- from Hebrew Bricha. Anybody who ran away right now, and looked for\nan identity of where to go, and the -- the -- this -- the whole thing led us, the goal was to\nreach Israel, one way or the other, because we sort of -- no matter how I looked at it,\nEurope was an insecure place, because any country, other than Poland, I found had the\nsame story, Jews were killed. It was only a matter of the percentages. And unfortunately,\nout of the six million, three million were killed in -- in Poland, because they corroborated\nmuch more than the people in other countries did, and -- and that was the results of it. So\nbasically my zeal at that particular time was, end goal, to reach Israel, and I enlisted\nmyself with the illegal party -- not ill -- it\u2019s not the party, it was the part -- the Zionistic\nparty, that they were doing, that helped to help those -- those who ran away, the\nrunaways, sort of, to bring them in this year. And they accepted me, and immediately\nthey made me the head of 10 more guys [indecipherable] and when we came from there,\nwe -- from Lodz, we were sent to Krakow. And from Krakow, which is not too far from\nCzechoslovakia, we came to Czechoslovakia. In Czechoslovakia, the Red Cross, which I\nmet for the first time -- otherwise, during the war, I did not even know that the Red Cross\nexisted, or anything like that. I knew that -- that it existed, but meaning not to speak\nderogatorily about it, there was no such thing wherever the ghettos was, anything to see\nthe sign of a Red Cross, as they should be the -- the -- the people to help the Jews in any\nkind of way. But, so for the first time in Czechoslovakia, I have seen a Red Cross, and\nthey had a kitchen open for many runaways, because people were changing from -- either\nthat they were working in Germany, or they were enslaved for the -- in Germany,\nwhatever it 1s that everybody was returning home. So the traffic back and forth from cu --\nin countries existed, and the Red Cross, at that particular time, was available to give us a\nlittle helping hand. And they made us ID\u2019s, and the destination of that particular time,\nwas to go to Hungary, Budapest, from there. And we were on the train, and I don\u2019t know\nwhat I mentioned that on the train we ran into some drunken Soviet soldiers, you know\nwhat I mean, and that we had -- since we -- I had more partisans with me, so we had to do\nwhat we had to do. And to save our women that we -- were with us, or the whole\noperation, that we were on an illegal way, and we just -- when we were going near a\nriver, we just shoved them down on -- over the -- into the river. I don\u2019t know what it was,\nthe outcome of it, but we were [indecipherable] then the train stopped at Budapest, our\nminds, of the five of us that were there, were really thinking, who knows whether we may\nnot hear a little call, because in Hungary still, the Soviets were occ -- on the occupation at\nthat particular time. But, since 1t was quiet, we went to the community at that time,\nCommunitaes rilita, and there sort of was an encampment for us where to sleep. And for\nthe first time, we organized. The following mor -- day, that a demonstration that we are\ngoing to go to the consulate, which it was over there, British consulate, already in\nexistence, and we made a protest march, declaring that Israel is supposed to become a\nstate, so therefore it could house all it\u2019s refugees, as we were to so many years, driven out\nhistorically from Israel, and is a time of our return to -- back to our homeland, from our\nancestors.",
        "Q: How many people were involved in that march?",
        "A: I give or take, not coming, because on the train, the whole group consisted of -- were\nover a hundred, but people of runaways that were already there in -- in Budapest at the\ntime, ready to go to Bucharest, because the route at that particular time, called for us to\ngo to Bucharest, Romania. And being that they were ca -- boarding near the ocean, from\nthere we would illegally send them on ships, to go illegally to Palestine, as it was called,\nnot Israel, but Palestine at the time, as it -- as it\u2019s -- historically the name of the area was\ncalled Palestine. So -- but they changed on us in the middle. So to tell you approximately,\nthe demonstration had at least about 200 people, at the event, in rows, orderly. Israeli\nflags were gi -- made to us, and we had inscriptions at that time of saying that -- that\nIsrael should become a state. So it became to me, a new era of life, that all of a sudden,\nwhile I was not going where I\u2019m going, I had some -- I had a goal in my life, I had some -\n- of re-establishing myself. And I felt very good about it, you know? And it was -- the\nmarl thing was good, it -- my wife accompanied me, she did not sort of resist all of this, I\nthink. She was in the same mind and mood, as to what I was doing. So, 1-1t sort of -- now\nI\u2019m not by myself any more, I\u2019m the -- we are two, and sort of it made a little bit my life\neasier, because I no longer was that one person like a stone in the desert. I use that word\nbecause that\u2019s my feelings of the way it used to be. So now we -- we were a team. Just for\nthe sake of it, I don\u2019t know whether I told it in the other, we met our rabbi, who married\nus in her hometown, and he was apart over there to, where we were sleeping on bunk\nbeds, and we were on the top, he was at the bottom, the bunk bed broke, and I almost --\nhe got injured from a nail from that, but not badly. But it was like I said, that little fun\nthat we had to [indecipherable] accidents that had happened. And by that day --",
        "Q: It was in Budapest?",
        "A: In Budapest, yeah. When we were in Budapest, let me describe it to you. Over the\nBuda, there was not a single bridge, only pantoon bridges were left from the army, that\n[indecipherable] to cross over. They started already on -- working on restoring bridges,\nbut that\u2019s how it was. It was fresh after the war, and one could see the difference what it\nwas in Poland, the way it -- it looked like -- there we saw shops, all of a sudden, you can\ngo in and shop. So what I didn\u2019t see in Boronivitch, or I didn\u2019t see back in Poland, even --\nyou know what I mean, the whole thing was in markets, outdoor markets, it was in Lddz,\nor in Bialystok in the same way. Here, I saw an organized thing like this here, that wa --\nsure it was destroyed the Buda, you know, but the civilian housing was not damaged as\nbadly to say. And in -- say there were apartments, and people were shoppers, there was\nmarket. All of a sudden, we were given at that particular time, salamis and everything to\ntake with us, after they changed us route not to go to Bucharest, but to go to Gratz. And\nthe fun part was in Gratz was different orders. We were going -- our documents make --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: -- and the -- th-the most -- most likely was to cross over to the English zone, but the\nSoviets still were there. So we told the supplies, the food supplies that were given to us to\ntake to that hotel, we coming to that hotel, we turn it into the kitchen, and then we had to\nworry about food for ourselves to eat. Something else happened in that hotel, which I do\nnot know what I said to the other -- on the other tape, but I -- let\u2019s forget what I said on\nthe other tape, I want to tell it now, because that was very important. We came in there,\nand that was the English zone. We were -- we were told that 1f we ever go through to the\nEnglish zone, we must be very polite and quiet. And as we were going to the hotel, our\norders were we only go in groups of two and three, and nobody is to speak at all, if\npossible. If you do speak, manage to speak German. If you do not speak German, you\nmust speak another language, sort of, because we would be going there as we are\nAustrian Jews. Therefore, Austrian Jews returning back from concentration camp,\ntherefore it would have been no questions asbay cause at the time, the police there, when\nit was, shied away from all of these things, sort of as to wash themselves of all the\natrocities against the Jews they did. Anyways, we came to a hotel, and for the first time, I\nmet there in the hotel, a representative from the American Joint Committee, which they\nwere there to help the refugees. I also met a party faithful over there, and I brem -- I\nremember he -- Pinhaus was his name, he was with red hair. So, between the two of\nthem, that was the command. In other words, the Zionist side, the American aide side,\nand so on.",
        "Q: Excuse me, are you talking about the Joint Distribution Committee?",
        "A: Committee, yeah, that they were, that particular time, already there in that hotel. We\ngo into that hotel, we were housed where we should go, and before long I meet up over\nthere a guy who was a guide, and he was with us in the forest, the partisans. In a way it\nwas aray of sunshine, you know? Lusek, I speak to him -- and I hear that he\u2019s guiding --\nI ask him first, I was -- wanted to go, ready with my group, I still kept the group, sort of\nlike the 10, that we work together, as I said, to begin. I was their leader, or commander, if\nyou want to call it. He says, \u201cHarold, you and Sonia, you got to wait a little while.\nThey\u2019 Il tell you when your turn comes.\u201d And before long, since we made ourselves\nknown that we are former partisans, fighters over there, we get an order that we are going\nto go, and we were told we are going to go to come to the river Moore, which it was a\nfast river, but a narrow one, and we are to cross that river, and on the other side of that\nriver, we will immediately -- immediately enter to the English zone. Myself, being a\nplatoon commander before, and the other guys being partisans, when we hear assignment\nlike this here, we did not ask any questions whatsoever. We were given tickets to take the\ntrain, and we were to go from Gratz to Klagenford. And in Klagenford we were given the\ndirections to go to the river, and there -- but we were told, don\u2019t go like you\u2019re marching,\ngo like normal, two people again together. But when you come to the river, immediately I\nfind out that in my group there were a few guys who could swim, and a few guys who\ncouldn\u2019t swim at all. And we were with women and men together. I decided that once we\ncome there, to form a chain. [Il lead the group first, I was a swimmer, and my wife was\nnext, which she was not a swimmer, and that\u2019s how I made the chain to be. So, by the\ntime we stretch across, even with a little bit of paddling with our hands, we\u2019 ll be able to\nreach almost the other side. So swimming was not to be very far. All of a sudden, a\ngalloping horse is heard, and a commanding officer, was in Soviet gear, comes over, he a\n-- makes [indecipherable] to stop, and of all people, he asks us question what we are\ntrying to do, we are telling him we\u2019re trying to swim in the river. You know what I mean?\nBut of course we did not have any bathing suit on, or anything like that, we are now\ncivilian, and we didn\u2019t have any problems what -- that\u2019Il get wet [indecipherable]. And of\nall the things, he arrests me. He arrests me, now of all things in the world, I\u2019m an escapee\nfrom the Soviet Union, and from the KGB, and now, I finally, at the mement -- the\nmoment of re-liberation, I should fall back? But I had no alternative, he immediately he\nhad two more on horses with him, and -- and he\u2019s already got a little squad, sort of, and I\nhave none to say. Anyway, the rest of the group, with my wife together, go back, and\nthey decided to get in contact, now again with the hotel in there, and telling them of what\nhad transpired, and they just -- and they told that they\u2019re sending out immediately,\nsomebody who is going to handle the case, and take it over. Sure enough, within the nec -\n- by the next day, I immediately am taken to the jail, and in the jail, all the questions and\nanswers that they gave me, was that I wanted to go to Klagenford, and my aim was to go\nfurther away in Italy, and I -- whichever I mentioned the name, they says, \u201cWell, you\ndon\u2019t have to worry about it, we\u2019ll send you there.\u201d But being -- working for the KGB,\nand knowing them from the time that I know before the war, when we were -- were in\ntheir zone, I knew that when the Soviets tell you you gonna go to one place, you may\nwind up in Siberia until you get there. So I did not have my trust in that system, and I was\nreally scared, but what could I do? I was -- no way for me to break out, I did not have in -\n- any money, or anypla -- anything at all. So I figured I got to wait for time, and see what\nis going to be. By the next day, it looks like somebody came from there, a courier, and it\nlooks like they had money, and they knew how to bribe Soviet officials at that particular\ntime, and they paid up, [indecipherable] for my freedom, and they let me out. When we\ncame back to the hotel, I organized my 10 guys, immediately I posted to each door\nexceeding that hotel, I says, \u201cEverybody stay, as the guy told me that nobody\u2019s going to\ngo out. Whoever is going to come in, you\u2019ll know. Because we are not going to let -- be\nmistreated. We, because we were former fighters, are not going to be let into another\nsituation like that. Josef Lusek is the name of the guy. The way he takes the other, we are\ngoing, and they\u2019re going to take us tonight, not tomorrow.\u201d I came in with an ultimatum\nto the office, and I told them, I says, \u201cI have guards in all the exits from my guys,\nnobody\u2019s going to go out.\u201d I says, \u201cYou dealing with former partisans. And remember,\nour ch -- our duty did not finish as yet, we are not in Israel as yet, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re\naiming to be. I\u2019m not going to let you guys play with our lifes any longer. Nobody is\ngoing out of the hotel tonight.\u201d And I spoke -- meanwhile, Lusek comes over, he tried to\ncalm me down, and he says, \u201cHarold, I know your wife from days past, before I knew\nyou. Ill take you,\u201d -- my wife, I says, \u201cNever mind to all of these here things, \u201cMy group\ngoes with you, and you are going to be responsible for all of us. If anything foul plays\n[indecipherable] remember, we are not going to remain silent. You know us from the\nforest.\u201d",
        "Q: Let me ask you something here. Were the other people in the hotel that Lusek was\ntaking across --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- were they involved with the Bricha also, or was this just --",
        "A: They were involved just like we refugees, who looking to go forward to Israel.\nHowever, there were people with money, people who went smuggling while I was\nworking with idealism, and they were mi -- Black Marketeering, and they already got so\nmany -- made money, and about it, and ma -- and you know, it was payola, immediately\nwent into existence at that particular time. And I found it out quickly, and this is where I\nmade a point, I banged the table in the -- in the office, and I told him, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not going\nto go on like that. I speak for my group. I\u2019m their leader, and that\u2019s what 1s gonna be.\nAnd tonight, if any plans you have about leaving any group, I don\u2019t care who the others\nare, we are going,\u201d and Lusek, he was -- I called him into -- be in presence, so I says,\n\u201cYou know. You the leader, and you the guide, but command, I will have. I and my wife\nwill be -- ride next to you and your wife.\u201d She was there, too. And remember, there will\nbe no foul play. So he told us, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to enter a barn. In that barn in the mountains\nover there, 1s where the Soviets [indecipherable] are there, we have to bribe him, we have\nto pay him -- pay him off, and therefore they\u2019 Il let the group go through.\u201d And he warned\nus, \u201cThey will -- they probably may body search you, and if they find anything of value,\nthey might take it away, they may liquidate it. Don\u2019t make a resistance, because\notherwise you\u2019ll spoil the whole operation.\u201d I really did not have much, but at the same\ntime, a ring f -- we had from my father and mother, we had a watch, and so on. So my\nwife, what she did, she had some yarn, you know what I mean, for knitting a sweater, so\non. So she took some of the valuables, made a ball out of it, you know what I mean,\nwrapped it inside, so in a way we figured that what so. Then we came to that barn, like\nyou said, anyways -- I rushed a little bit too fast. They accepted my -- what I dema -- my\ndemands, and my group was going with that -- the whole group together must have been\nabout another 20 people, so we were a big column, and when we came to that barn, like I\nsaid, which he explained that to us, we started -- they started to body search us, you know\nwhat I mean, and so on. So happened that to my group, nobody had any valuables, really,\nto worry about. We did not try to acquired it in that time that we were involved with. But,\nthere were some people who had to pay off, you know, give this, and we became\nknowledgeable before watid. Now, we already on the other side of the barn, and we\u2019re\nane on the English zone, physically. We walked for --",
        "Q: I want to remind you that we do have all of this on the other tape, so we don\u2019t --",
        "A: You still have that?",
        "Q: Yeah, we have --",
        "A: Okay, so not --",
        "Q: -- we have all of th -- we have everything up until when you left for the United States.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: But -- but I ust had a few, focused questions, so we don\u2019t want to go over everything\nagain.",
        "A: Ask me any questions, and I\u2019Il answer them.",
        "Q: One thing was -- well, I did have another question about your march in Budapest, you\nhad mentioned.",
        "A: Yes?",
        "Q: Did anything come -- become of that? You had -- you had a couple hundred people\nmarching.",
        "A: Well, the only thing was it was so new a thing that it never existed before. Later on I\nfound out that these type of marches existed also in Romania, and perhaps in other\nsources. But it was totally new to us, and it was totally new in Budapest for something\nlike that to happen. Absolutely we must say that later on, you know, I\u2019ve told -- we are\ntalking right now about 1945, you know it -- Israel didn\u2019t become a state til 1948, but you\nknow that in the intervening years, of these three years, a lot of demonstrations of that\ntype begin to happen, be in Europe, be in 1s -- be in isra -- not Israel, but Palestine, or in\nthe United States of this same way, until the resolution finally came to pass, that Israel\nwas granted statehood. So I mean, it was -- perhaps it -- I di -- cannot claim that it was --\nwe were the beginners of that, but be -- because later I found out that similar things went\non. So I don\u2019t want to go ahead to take a first eenadida, but it was a first in Budapest,\nwhere it should happen.",
        "Q: Did you -- you were obviously preparing to go to is -- Palestine. Did you have very\nstrong feelings at the time, about going to Palestine?",
        "A: Absolutely, as in my former tape, I said I was -- since childhood, and in the school I\ngraduated, Yaven in Poland, Zionism was imbedded in me. I -- I had to hide it through\nHitlerite times, and I had to hide it in the time of the Soviet\u2019s occupation, which it was --\nI know they called it liberation, but let\u2019s -- let -- let it be for history to judge, whether it\nwas occupational, or it was liberation. But inside, that spark lit up, at that particular time\nin L\u00e9dz. No sooner I met up in -- you know, in found that former shamring, you know\nwhat I mean? Which it was _ that it was shameratsyer, that 1t was a youth organization\nbelonging to the Zionist organization, and that spark kept through me, it was the new\nthing, just like it was the thing for getting out of the ghetto, and become a resister, and\nfight the Nazis, this is how it was, the new fighting that 1t became in me, and I assume in\nthe rest of the guys that are war with me, because when people resorted themselves to go\non train -- to a -- rooftops, and on the steps to go with -- wi-with -- with [indecipherable]\non their shoulders, and speeds of the trains maybe 70 - 80 miles an hour, maybe 60, t-\ntimes 50, doesn\u2019t matter the speed. But it was dangerous, it was a dangerous mission to\ndo. But it was a goal in our hearts imbedded, that we must go to see for freedom and\nliberty for ourselves, someplace where we could be safe from annihilation, and so on.",
        "Q: So, what I didn\u2019t understand from the in -- the video then, was how -- how you a --\ncame to agree to go to the United States, rather than to Palestine.",
        "A: Pll tell you that, because it was deception in the party. While I was working in Italy,\nsending illegals away, and one day I came telling them that my wife became pregnant.\nWhen I told them about the news, they say -- and I want to go with my group, illegals,\nthey says, \u201cNo, Harold, you stay here on the point, you\u2019re doing very good, and we are\nexpecting to get legal passage. We will send you the first thing -- you know what I mean,\nfor legal passage.\u201d I succumbed to that, because to me it sound very real, the words that\nthey were telling me, an-and I was -- what we were doing in the kibbutzim is preparing\nthem for Israel, and so on. However, the day came, and the free passage, as we called\nthem, certificates at that particular time became -- and I come to Rome, to find out what\u2019s\ngoing on, I hear that as they were passing out certificates to some people, but all of a\nsudden, I came and I asked my man in charge, \u201cWhat happened to me, and my wife?\u201d He\nsays, \u201cWell, there wasn\u2019t enough this time, but we expect pretty soon to have more.\u201d And\nat that particular time, you know, it was already -- of course, she was not -- she probably\nmust have been -- give or take at that particular time, maybe in her fifth month, you\nknow, because I\u2019m -- I\u2019m not counting at this time the times. I came the second time to\nRome, when the next batch of certificates came, and all of a sudden, people begin to\nlaugh at me. They s-say, \u201cOh, Harold, you don\u2019t want to go to Israel any more, you trying\nto go to America.\u201d You deceived the Zionist organization. And I felt really, in my heart,\nthat somebody put me down too low, it was too much. So then I said to my commanding\nofficer, \u201cI'll tell you, I\u2019m resigning my post. I am going to register to go for Israel -- for\nUnited States, instead of going to Palestine.\u201d At that particular time, they start pleading\nwith me, \u201cOkay, if you want to go to Palestine, fine, but we still want you to go on a no --\na kibbutz near Rome.\u201d Where -- that story is printed in one of the books that -- for my --\none of my men, who was in my platoon, his name was Kigernovitch, Moshe\nKigernovitch, and he described part of that stor -- that story. He pleaded with me at that\ntime to write the [indecipherable] personal thing that I wrote in my manuscript, but I was\nnot ready and I couldn\u2019t try it. At that particular time I was not ready to sit down and\nwrite my life\u2019s story. That\u2019s why I refused, but h -- I have -- he recorded it with my\npicture, and him, and acknowledging that I was_ the comoon -- platoon commander, or\ncommandeers ruddid, way they say it in -- in Russian. And it\u2019s in his book. Unfortunately\nthe book is only written in Yiddish, and it never been translated, because he is writing not\njust about the forest where we were, he is writing about a lot of other forests, the\npartisans, Jewish partisans existed, because he wanted for historical sake, to acknowledge\nthat Jews did fight in the partisans, and Jews participated in resistance, okay? So, at that\nparticular time, as we are right now which you asking me the question, I had Zionism in\nme, but it was dormant for these years, because I had to, but as soon -- the sooner -- it got\nignited very easily, they -- somebody did not have to sort of hit me, and to say, \u201cHey\nHarold, what are you doing?\u201d I was right there, and I was willing to risk, in those days,\nmy life. So therefore, when he put me down, I says, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to sway things to\nsend others to go illegally,\u201d which it was a lot of hardship with going through illegally.\n\u201cAnd I am going to s -- go to America. So therefore, I\u2019m resigning, and that\u2019s all.\u201d I\ntherefore enlisted myself at that time to come to Florence, Italy, which I joi -- I -- I lived -\n- what you sa -- everything 1s told, until I came to Italy, until the United States. So, you\nprobably know the story, the way we were taken out of the camp there, and we were put\nit into DP camps in Italy, and then I, instead of being in a camp, was then out of the\ncamp, and I worked with the illegal elleah, which it was kibbutzim, and I was the leader\nthere, and train them, and descend them. And like I say, at that time, when I said that,\nthey say, \u201cHarold, you can go the next time with next group we are sid -- we are\nshipping, and you can go with them.\u201d I says, \u201cAre you for real, or you just trying to?\u201d I\nsays, \u201cMy wife entered already the sixth month.\u201d I says, \u201cIn the sixth month of pregnancy\nyou ask me to -- I should go ahead to gamble with the lives of two, my wife and the\nbaby?\u201d I says, \u201cNo, I cannot do that. Therefore, I refuse, and\u201d -- and that\u2019s how I wound\nup in Florence, Italy, and I came in there, and started to write to my family. My mother\nhad a sister here, and three brothers, and I wrote to them, and we started a whole new\nthing about it, because until now, all the letters that I sent to America, never send them a -\n- an address, but [indecipherable] address. I used to drive my aunt crazy. She heard from\nme, and she did not know where she can correspond with me. But at that particular time,\nwhen we came to Florence, we in -- stop -- we established writing through the army post,\nunival, and -- because the regular post was still not operating too much. And -- and this is\nwhere my decision was reached that I\u2019m going to go to the -- to the USA. Being in the\nUSA, my Zionism again did not change, I still remained a Zionist, and as soon we landed,\nI hardly made a living, but I immediately joined -- we had at that particular time, the new\ncitizen club. It was an organization and a club. And we used to meet -- have meetings,\nsometimes to raise money for our cause of existence, people would have dances, or raffle\ntickets or so on, the usual way. And again, it imbued in me anew, I\u2019m a Zionist, even --\nand someday -- I didn\u2019t at that particular time talk about going to Israel, when you\nalready have a child in the United States, and f -- we came in \u201948, March 14. 22 months\nold then my daughter was. And the next year, 1949, in September, my son 1s born. So I\nwas -- looks like too busy with having children instead of talking about operational way\nto go to Israel.",
        "Q: So it -- your family being in the United States, was that the crucial thing that made\nyou come to the United States, rather than going to Israel?",
        "A: No, it was not the crucial, it was the helping point. You must remember the\nimportance. I did not have money, I did not have means. We were living -- after I entered\nin Florence, we were living under the help from the UNRRA, the United Nations Relief\nOrganizations, that they -- but we formed the kibbutz. So, in other words, I want to\nexplain it, as I said a little before. My Zionism was still there. Again, we form a kibbutz,\neven in that, while we\u2019re waiting to go to America. I still have pictures to prove that, with\nthe name of the kibbutz, and in Florence, and I was -- I have the pictures to prove I was\nspeaking about Zionism, and how we must do. Although I was going to America, but the\nsupport for Israel, I never -- it stopped being a -- a dire participant belonging, even\nthough today, and all through the years since 1953, I\u2019m a member of the B\u2019nai Brith. But\nI\u2019m still a Jew who belongs to the Zionist causes and so on. And it\u2019s not just belonging in\nperson, but with my pocket also, you know what I mean? The Israeli bonds that I\u2019m\nbuying, or to charitable events that you know, where you -- you give charity to these\nhere. So, all of these here, because I changed to bad leadership, at that particular time, so\nmy route did change, but inside of me, my heart did not change a little bit, and I remained\nof the same way. So now, when I came to Chicago, and I must make it -- I went to high\nschool -- I went to one of the best high schools at the time that it was, it was in Austin\nHigh. And not to tell you the story, as a fact, it\u2019s not a story, within three semesters I\nmade American high school. At the same time, looks like the principal says to me, how\ncome I\u2019m not going to go to college now, because I was working at night. And I want you\nto understand, I made a point there. At six o\u2019clock in the morning, I used to get up, take a\nstreetcar to go to work -- of course, I did not have a car, as yet. And from s -- from the\nstore I used to go to school, which it was a streetcar, as we called it at that time, going all\nthe way to school. Do my homework at that time, going there. School would start at\nabout eight o\u2019clock, to 10 at night, two hours, and it was regular school. Of course, it was\ngrownups, so you had a lot of homework to be given, and certain thing would be done at\nschool, such as reading, or on the blackboard to the big [indecipherable] like the -- the\nkids [indecipherable] today. And I would come home, the earliest was 11 0\u2019clock at\nnight. My wife and kids were asleep, so my dinner, sort of like I said, was grabbing a bite\nin the store. I was working at that time 1n a grocery store for a brother of my mother\u2019s,\nmy uncle. And that\u2019s what it was, my routine. So between six in the morning, til the 11,\nor 11:30 at times, that was working, and then working with my head, and working so\nhard, but I established -- so like I said to the principal, I says, \u201cI -- by all means, I\u2019d love\nto go further myself in college,\u201d which I never did, unfortunately, but my kids did, so I\u2019m\nhappy that I did -- was a good father to my children. And I didn\u2019t complain or anything\nlike that, and I had wa -- it was a challenging thing that I could achieved, to know how to\nread, and to know how to write, and you know, and that\u2019s what -- and in the meanwhile,\nthis -- we are talking about 1949, where my son is born. By 1953, I mastered all that I had\nin me, to sit down and write my manuscript, which of course, I to -- 1t took me a year, and\n-- and a nervous breakdown afterwards, because when I speak about these things, even\nnow, I am not here with you in the good USA, I\u2019m there, where it was. I\u2019m there time, the\nway it was. And thanks God that I can control my emotions today better than I could in\nthose years past, because it was too fresh an issue, and my thing was record, and to tell\nfor posterity.",
        "Q: Before we go on with that, I wanted to ask you more about your -- I have a couple of\nquestions about Italy. You mentioned you were involved in the camp --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- administration in Modena, and you also mentioned you were involved in organizing\nthe kibbutz, with -- are those two separate things, or the same things?",
        "A: Separate things.",
        "Q: Can you tell me something about the camp administration? What were you doing?",
        "A: I was in the administration, there was no specific titles. We were in Modena, which --\nit was a camp from the former military academy, where we got in one day only from\nMauthausen, Austria, they got in trucks, and unloaded human cargo, just like it was\nregular cargo of something else, because they did not look like humans. And in that big\ncrowd, of all these people, of 5,000, from one truck that they unload them, and we are\nstaying there on the sidewalk. That was -- and please let me correct it for the recod -- it\nwas still in Bolognia, we afterwards came to Modena. We\u2019re standing on the outside, we\nhave nothing more than blankets or anything like that. When my wife points at me, she\nsays, \u201cHarold, look, this man is my uncle\u2019s brother.\u201d I said, \u201cCareful, how -- are you\nsure?\u201d The man was swollen, you know what I mean, and so on. We -- we come near,\nand she says to him, \u201cIsn\u2019t your name,\u201d she says, \u201cyou know, Laserovitchasun?\u201d And he\nlooks, a-and sort of somebody says something to me, he was not talk himself. He says,\n\u201cDon\u2019t you have a brother Misha Mandel, he\u2019s my uncle?\u201d You know, and we got from\nthere. We kept company with him throughout, because from there we were ordered to go\nto Modena, and we were housed in the military academy, that\u2019s\u2019 where they made a\ncamp. People were sleeping on the floors, laying. It was just like sardines. But somehow\nor other, there was no protests. The biggest protest what we had, that we had a camp right\nnext door to us, housing former Nazis, in there -- which it was some SS with them, and so\non. And every day it used to start a rumbling, with stones, bottles, or anything like that to\nthese Nazis. The MP would come -- the American MP would come to quelch it. And we\ntold him, \u201cIf you want it to be quiet, either you move us to another place, or you move\nthem away, because we will not remain,\u201d -- to us, it was a lie that we didn\u2019t care if\nsomebody will be arrested, or anything like that. But to look at a Nazi face on, that was\nsomething that we could not let our minds to say, \u201cOh, it was yesterday, it was a war.\u201d\nBecause we knew the first thing, if these guys would have been on the -- this side of the\nfence, not the other, they would be more than happy to kill the -- us again, you know\nwhat I mean, because it was imbued in their lives. It was not that they seeked revenge\nbecause of some, there was no because. That\u2019s what it was, the training that they got.\nFinally, within a few days, the camp was moved, with the SS, and we remained in that\ncamp. Now, that camp was a mixture of youth, middle aged people, pregnant, sick and\nthe biggest thing being in the administration, what we were seeking for help. The army,\nof course, provided us at that particular time, I must say, with blankets, and so on,\nbecause they couldn\u2019t rebuild it -- the -- the military academy, but they gave us help.",
        "Q: Which -- which army\u201d?",
        "A: The US army. The US army was stationed in Florence, in -- not in -- not Florence, I\nmean in -- in Modena at that particular time. There was also the -- part of the British\narmy, which it was attached to them, which the Israeli part was a part of them, too, and\nthey were the ones, as I mentioned, brought us into Italy from Austria, and it was also\nover there, a part of the Polish -- a -- a Polish -- a part of the Polish army, which it was\nalong with the Britain. So we had at least one thing, since we didn\u2019t speak Italian at that\nparticular time. But we could speak Hebrew to these here, we could speak Polish to the\nother soldiers, and they all were, in a way, I must confess, they were all trying to help us\none way or the other, but when we [indecipherable] on it for anything and everything,\nlooks like the patience va -- to say be patient was not the right answer. And I, being in\nthe administration, had the opportunity to see a person from the jewi -- Joint Distribution\nCommittee, but she was in an English -- a British uniform. How that came about, or what\n-- that she was not with the American army, I don\u2019t know. I cannot go into details. And\nshe came to the -- to our place where we would meet, and she asked us the question, what\ncould we help you? And I asked her at that time, I said, \u201cWhere should I start?\u201d So\ntherefore, I'll start and tell you. We have here young people, at the ages of about 14 - 15 -\n16. You got to remember, these people were taken to the camps, as -- as kids. Now they\nare teenagers. Through the -- through the -- if anybody was 10 years of age, you got to\nimagine he is now -- I says -- we -- we -- we encountered venereal disease in there\nmeans, because it was open prostitution in Italy, you know, on the street. But these kids\ndid not know, you know what I mean, any better, they were not brought -- I says, \u201cSo\ntherefore, I\u20191l make my biggest request to you, let\u2019s take the kids out of the camp.\u201d And\nbefore long, which again I have pictures to prove you -- that point, if at any time you\ninterested, but since we are doing it just for -- on a tape like that, but if you would be\ninterested, I will be more than happy to supply with copies of the pictures, where, at this\nparticular time, the Palestine brigade, or the Jewish brigade, as it was called, which it was\nattached to the British fifth army, came in to help, not the Joint Distribution Committee,\nand with their trucks, which you will see on the pictures, Ill -- Il show them to you\nafterwards, which with their trucks, we took the kids, and we shi-shipped them out to a\nseparate camp to make a camp, where they could be tended to the needs those youngsters\nwere needing, and they were the first ones to be shipped even illegally to Israel, by means\nthat we were not even aware of how, but they shipped them out, and they gave them the\ntreatment that needed. The next thing was we send --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number two, side A, of an interview with Harold Zissman. Okay, go\nahead.",
        "A: All the others, the grownups, who remained on the waiting list, or what it may become\nlater, some of them were integrated through the parties, because I must confess, the party\nsystem immediate -- immediately began ... immediately the parties began, even it was\ncamp life, and there was the Revisionist party, the a -- the Ashumer party, in other words\nmeaning Jharbortinsky\u2019s party to the right, and it was to the middle, and to the left. And it\ncould be visible to those of us who were working in the administration, and to those of us\nwho were organized, that it was immediately my people, your people, and so on. But it\u2019s\none thing I must confess. The harmony for the good of the cause existed. It was not an\nopen bipartisan, it not -- b-but it was bipartisan. Everybody understood the need of the\ntime, and so on. From there, it started to group out, from the big camp there. The\nkibbutzim, it started at that time. I at that particular time joined a seminar which -- it was\nnear Milano, and there were instructions to be taught to us. Professor -- there was a\nprofessor over there, I gotta thi -- I gotta think of his name.",
        "Q: Fir -- Garfinkel?",
        "A: Garfinkel. Oh, you know already [indecipherable]",
        "Q: You -- you did --",
        "A: You know my story about it. \u2019'm glad that you\u2019re aware about my story. Yeah,\nProfessor Garfinkel, he was a light to us, explaining and teaching us, and a lot of these\nthings went into our head very well. Even though, at that particular time, I did not think\nof anything else but Ashumer, meaning the party to the left, as I started in the youth\norganization. I couldn\u2019t help it, I was with them, and I could sense in that seminar, that\nthat seminar was orchestrated by my party, or so -- and I mean -- in other words, the party\nto the left. So --",
        "Q: I have a question about -- y-you talked in the other interview about recruiting -- about\nbeing involved with recruiting the young people to go to Israel, with these groups.",
        "A: Well [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So you did -- you talked about it some, and I wanted to know -- this is kind of a -- a\nquestion that -- that you might have something to say about and you might not, but I\u2019ve\nheard some talk about -- about there being discrimination in Israel against camp\nsurvivors, and that there was some looking down on camp survivors 1n particular because\nof what they had been through. Did you witness any of that?",
        "A: Well, I can tell you that much. Being 1n that -- s -- you can call that a camp, in the\nmilitary academy\u2019s building that we were, that was a camp. To see what Hitler did to our\npeople is -- Pll describe it in plain. There wasn\u2019t a night passing by without 1n the middle\nof the night that it would start almost like a regular riot. Kapo, you heard an outcry kapo,\nmeaning, a kapo is the German name for the leader of a group. And these leaders were\nthe ones who were smiten -- smiting the Jews, and punishing the Jews. The Hitlerites\nalways got a double pleasure, to see when a Jew hits another Jew, you know? And in the\nmeanwhile, those people who recognize it, we had to call in the MP\u2019s, and it was a\nterrible, terrible situation to keep. That\u2019s why we realized we gotta break the camp away\nfrom it, but the entire camp feeling, which you ask me, I did not know this. And to say\nthat in Israel it was a feeling against them, no. If 1t was a feeling against them, it was\namong people -- in other words, between camp leaderships and so on. What per -- say to\ngeneralize that, I couldn\u2019t -- I wouldn\u2019t agree on that part at all.",
        "Q: It was -- I -- I had heard something about how maybe there was some discrimination\nbe -- be -- on the part of -- of some of the people who were interested in building the state\nof Israel because they were looking for people who were strong, and who would fight,\nand there was some discrimination because it was assumed that people who were in\ncamps didn\u2019t resist enough. And I was wondering whether you saw any of that kind of\ndiscrimination. So you didn\u2019t see any -- you\u2019re saying you didn\u2019t see anything.",
        "Q: I -- I didn\u2019t see it, but it\u2019s -- remains a situation of division for always and forever,\nbasically. There is more told what it went on in the camps. All the horror stories are more\nknowledgeable, be in film, be in script, and so on. The resistance story 1s still a novice, in\nmy book. I read quite a few books, but the real stories, and the more the merrier, because\nit needs to be told more no-now. Israel, per se, did not have anything but open arms that\nthey extended to us at that particular time. And we must confess, those people who were\nin the camps, those people who were in the partisans, they were the front lines, who\nimmediately joined from those illegal ships, when the war broke out in Israel, be that it\nwas not fully recognizable, but in 1948, when Israel got status as a state of Israel, at that\nparticular time, you saw yesterday\u2019s camp inmates, yesterday\u2019s people who came from\nhiding, or they were fighting 1n the partisans. As I me -- forementioned before, there was\na bipartisan way, and it was no discrimination going on here. Yes, there was a\ndiscrimination at the time that it happened 1n Israel, bipartisan, with that ship that it blew\nup in ammunition, and so on. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard about it, but that is not my time,\nor my story here to talk about it, that is already recorded. But Esterburg say, you resisted,\nor didn\u2019t resisted, was sort of a question mark 1n a school level, or otherwise, and that\ngoes on til this day. When I come to Israel, I was there only about a year and a half ago,\nand the same thing so many years afterwards, when I wa -- came into the kibbutz what\nthe partisans have over there, and I could find a lot of the -- m-my name is 1n there, and a\nmatter of fact, I\u2019m sending them, I didn\u2019t finish, a -- a biography in short -- my biography\nin short, it will be about 10 pages, so they could record it, but I couldn\u2019t s -- s -- find any\nanimosity, or any criticism. It\u2019s just minds that have -- want to know, to fill in the void\nabout how we resisted. Not -- and the other thing, that 1t was resistance. And I still must\ntell you, I know year after year, when I go to the awareness days, when I come here, I\nwas there last month, and I\u2019m going to go again this year in March again. When I talk to\nthese here high school kids, be -- yo-you find -- last time in -- it was the biggest, curious\nthing happened to me is I had a Israeli -- the parents were Israeli, the kid was born in\nIsrael, but he was over here with -- because they moved here. He knew nothing about the\nHolocaust whatsoever. To him was just a novice thing that he just heard it, and especially\nmy telling him that I was in the partisans. I had 10 students around my table, and I think\nit was the most active table in many tables around, not that the other ones didn\u2019t. But\nsomehow or other, it was a curious thing to those who understand. And after all, I\u2019m\ndealing with kids let\u2019s say 15 - 16 years of age, and they know what it is, resistant to -- in\nthe word, to understand. But they had a general view, story is not known. But as soon you\nopen up your mind, the question always comes up, why weren\u2019t there more? Not that I\nwanted more. There was in every country of Europe, let\u2019s for the fact, be Martial Tito in\nYugoslavia, be the French Resistance in -- in France. No matter which country you want\nto name, where resistance existed, there were Jews in there. Were they in the percentages\nthat it should have been, no. However, the public lacks the understanding. First of all, the\nphysical make-up of those people in the ghettos, if they were longer, were not to be able\nto became fighters and resisters. But the Warsaw ghetto proved it, that they did resist, and\nthey did hold for two weeks, much more than the armies in Poland held the Germans\nfrom entering Poland. So, there was resistance in other ghettos besides Warsaw, too. But\nto resist in the way that we joined the resistance of the partisans, of the Soviet partisans,\nor wherever, in the other countries. That is an understanding that we lacked the\norganization, we lacked the willingness of the people involved in it to say come and join\nus. Because it took me a hard time, almost three weeks to find them, and after I found\nthem, my group of four, we had a hard time explaining to the commander that we could\nnot. How do we obtain weapons? Yes, we went on the ambush with them, and that\u2019s how\nthey got weapons, and that\u2019s when it -- and the -- and the majority were good fighters,\namong the top fighters. And I\u2019m talking about the Jewish fighters, not that I\u2019m trying to\nglamorize the situation, but tell the facts for posterity\u2019s sake, that people should know\nabout it. Because we were a fighter who had nothing to lose. The other fighters had a lot\nto lose. They had families, they didn\u2019t want to go to work 1n Germany. So the Belarus,\nfor instance, or those leftover soldiers who didn\u2019t want to wind up in POW camps, they\nwere -- they had a lot to lose, because they had families and everything. But any Jew who\ncame onto the partisans, or to the resistance, remember, his last -- whatever he had he --\nblood in him, or whatever he had power to resist, he resisted, because it was the last fight.\nEvery day was the last fight of his life that he\u2019d been fighting. So it\u2019s understanding that\nthey -- we could be among the ones to be talked about a lot. And unfortunately, so far, it\nisn\u2019t talked enough. You see how hard I told you I have to go ahead to have my\nmanuscript published. There is no takers. Looks like if I was to wrote a novel, which a lot\nof times people told me -- and maybe they\u2019|l encourage me to do, but how in a novel --\nwhere, in a novel it\u2019s fantasy? You don\u2019t necessarily hear the true story about it, but looks\nlike people in a -- buying a novel is easier to sell, or easier, in other words, to sell it to the\n-- to the people responsible for publishing, as well as the public perhaps reading it. Looks\nlike people do not want to read a lot the horror stories what it went on. And again, it was\ndirectly against just a minority, the Jews, for not giving the reason why. So I suppose\nmaybe that has a reason, but for the sake of history, and for the future generation, this\nstory must be told, be inscript -- be -- what we are doing right now, and just tell our\nstories.",
        "Q: You mentioned your family in the United States, and you also mentioned that in the\nfirst interview, that the aunt who was here in the US, that you were corresponding with --\nwith, was a favorite of yours.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How did you know her? How di -- had she -- when did she come to the States?",
        "A: She came in 1929, at the same time when we -- we moved over to another city from\nwhere I was born. And we moved -- the name of that city was Australenka, and I still\nwith my mother, went to the train to say good-bye to her. And she was favorite with me\nwhen I was a child, up to then. You know, I was only seven years of age in 1929. But the\npoint was, to ever she was go out, leave for picnics, whatever it is, I was -- I -- like she\ntook me like -- she loved me -- not at -- like she loved me, she loved me so much that she\nalways was -- the other part about it, from the other nieces and nephew what they had,\nthey were not there, in Poland they were all -- in America, her brothers were already\nbefore that in America. And so she came to America that time. My mother would keep at\nthat time, sort of a promise that I -- we should be in contact. So while my mother was\nwrite, she would go ahead to ask me to write the address to her. So therefore, in my mind,\nit just imbued that I remembered -- I could not even pronounce good in English in those\nyears, the address. But at that address, where she was living in Chicago was so\nmemorized by me, and my few words that I used to write so we can keep contact. So yes,\nshe remembered me as the child when she left Poland. And when I first got in touch with\nher, 1t was the whole story of our lives, you know what I mean? They had to make papers\nthree times, to bring us in, like I was telling you. So what was the reason? At first she\nthought that I\u2019m still single, because I couldn\u2019t write in the letters through that army that\nI\u2019m telling her that I already am married. So they made out immediately papers for me to\ncome. No sooner we got more in touch, they found out that I\u2019m married. So, at that time\nthey made the second papers. The third papers they made th -- because our baby -- our\ndaughter was already born, so that was the reason I had to make three times the papers.\nSo -- some -- some of the data, I mean, was misconstrued, but that 1s -- that 1s a minor\nsituation, we are not going to go into that, that was -- so our love re-establish our -- itself,\nimmediately. However, the other three brothers that they were here, they were much --\nthey were much -- they were in America probably before I was born. So I therefore\ncouldn\u2019t go ahead to remember them, but the first, in Chicago, for instance, we had the --\none of the -- there was originally four, but one of them was already dead. So in Chicago\nwe -- I had two uncles, and my aunt. In Los Angeles I had a third brother, he was the\noldest, which again, none of them, besides my aunt, remembered me as a child in Poland.\nAnd after all they -- I started working later for my uncle, and that was my mother\u2019s\nbrother, he was in the grocery business. And, as I forementioned with going to school,\nthat was the store I was working for, for him. So I know how much further in the story\nthat I told, I do -- over there. I joined again immediately an organization, we called them\nthe new citizens. So, in Chicago, we dwe -- used to have meetings, and like I\naforementioned, and make money f-for existence, and above all, to help Israel, be that it\nwas already -- when the bonds came in existence to be -- the bond drives. Be otherwise --\nambulances to send to Israel, or any of these -- it was basically -- all what we did was\nraising money, and funds through all means, be that it was a dance, be that it was a\ndinner, be it was membership, but it all was -- the idea about it Israel. And all of us were\na bunch together, but again, the story prevailed with me, there were not that many\nfighters, there was all concentration inmates. And we did not have any misunderstanding\nbecause and how and what. And sooner or later we found out, you know what I mean, the\nway it was. I remember when Israel\u2019s sen -- fifth anniversary came, and we had a guy\nfrom the embassy coming to speak to us, and I was on the committee, I always belonged\nsomeplace, and I always didn\u2019t just remain not to belong, or be on the committee or\nwhatever it is, because I cared for it so much. So that man was a former army colonel, I\nbelieve, or so, and he was in the embassy attached. So he comes in, and he says to me, he\nsays, \u201cExplain me a little bit about your group.\u201d Because he was going to have the\nspeech, and he wanted -- he didn\u2019t have the time before to ask the questions. So I tried to\ntell him we were 95 percent of former survivors of the concentration camps, or resistance\nlike Iam. A few that were -- not even five people that are -- were f -- in the resistance.\nHiding maybe, yes, but not in the resistance. So -- and I tried to tell him it\u2019s a make-up of\nvarious participation. He says, \u201c\u201cWhy don\u2019t we belong to a party,\u201d you see, in other\nwords, the party image or curse, maybe I should say, because it\u2019s a curse. If we wouldn\u2019t\nbe so divided, we would have been a stronger nation through the years. Why don\u2019t you\nbelong to one party? I says, \u201cWhat would that help Israel better? We raise money, we do\nall we can to help Israel. And that party, I wish you\u2019d stop being so party minded in\nIsrael, I believe it\u2019d be an easier life.\u201d In contrary, he didn\u2019t like my comments, of course,\nbecause he said, \u201cWhy do you want to be orphans?\u201d In other words, belonging to a party\nmeant not being an orphan in his mind, and in his view. And he came speaking to us,\nwhich he was not aware enough what had went on during the Holocaust, because my\ncritic to the time and the era was as -- in my writings, I -- I must mention it to you, there\nisn\u2019t a year that I don\u2019t write to the newspaper, at least in a folder about an inch thick, and\nI have all of them of -- of home. And I\u2019m a critic of some of these here things. I will\nalways try to defend Israeli causes, and Jewish causes, of -- of the -- of course, you know\nwhat I mean, like I said, I didn\u2019t want to give up Judaism in spite of Hitler, and I believe\nthat whenever I think about it, I\u2019m -- \u2019'm more for than I was before ba -- myself, even if\nI\u2019m not in Israel. But I visited Israel a number of occasions. I received a medal like\nholmor of the partisans who were there, when we came to Israel in 1983, then we had a\ngathering of all the fighters. And I have over here at har -- at home -- it\u2019s too bad that we\ncannot take another picture. I was honored as a partisan over here, too, 1n -- 1n -- in Fort\nLauderdale, a number of years ago. So, I been a constant participant in all of Jewish\ncauses, no matter what it is. I will always belong somewheres, and I will always speak\nmy mind whenever I can, and whenever I\u2019ve reached out. So like I say, it was born at that\nparticular time, even when I came to the United States, and we formed the organization. I\nwas in the starter, but it already was in existence. We called it the New Citizen\u2019s Club, as\nI aforementioned. We used to have once a month a meeting, and so on and so far. So,\nthen it came out the story, which I don\u2019t know whether I mentioned inforn, where the\nNazis wanted to march in Skokie.",
        "Q: That\u2019s -- that\u2019s a little farther in the future, so let\u2019s stay back a little bit. I wanted to\nask.",
        "A: Okay, so I'll wait for your questions.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask about the -- your journey to the United States, and about what you\nexpected to find when you arrived.",
        "A: Well, my journey in the united -- to the United States, was basically at the time, that I\nhad family, and I thought that they would be of help for me to get organized, and settled.\nAnd I believe it\u2019s a little personal about it, and I do not want to be -- feel that it\u2019s a\npersonal way. I didn\u2019t get the help I expected to help, although the family each other --\nhelped each other when they came, so with me, when they spend the money, and other\nmoney came from my wife\u2019s family that she had in New York. I believed that when I\nwanted to get established to go in business, which I did, I came to \u201948, and in 1953 in\nJanuary, I went to business to open up a grocery store. And I must thank the Almighty,\nwho let my wife\u2019s father -- my father-in-law survive, and he was with us in the forest,\ntoo. And if he wouldn\u2019t lend me that time the money, I would not be in business, you\nknow? So while I came to the family for help, I didn\u2019t get the help I wanted to get. Not\nthat I need -- I wanted the help to give out -- even to loan me the money, I wasn\u2019t --\nbecause you must remember, I had no collateral. I had no -- no way in the world to\nestablish credit, and I wanted to go in business. One of my uncles, may he rest in peace,\nsays, \u201cSince you got off the boat, you wanted to go in business.\u201d I said, \u201cI thought it\u2019s a\ncapitalistic system in the United States, that to go to business 1s okay.\u201d But like I say, I do\nnot wish at this time in my recording to leave the animosity about that, but I seek to come\nhere because of them. The turnout was that I would have been helped with the Joint\nDistribution Committee much more if I would not have been there. The mere fact of\ngoing to school, if I would have been getting help from the Joint Distribution Committee,\nI probably would have been able to maintain to go to college. This way I did not have any\ninsurance, and my son was supposed to be born, beforehand to have some money,\nbecause I did not have insurance for the pregnancy insurance, I had to acquire another\njob. While I was working at my uncle\u2019s store, fi -- six days a week, I had to get a job to\nwork in a tavern, which it was -- he was in partnership with -- with his other part of the\nfamily. So I used to work there Thursday night, or rather, some weeks Thursday night,\nFriday night, Saturday night, because all those days I worked in a store. And Sunday I\nused to come, after closing the store 12 o\u2019clock, I used to go home, rest up, get something\nto eat. At fi -- at six o\u2019clock I would be back to work to work til 12. And this is how I\naccumulated the extra money that I needed for my son to be born in that hospital. I\nwanted here to give a plug to a person who really -- talking about the family. My family\nwent to their gynecologist at that particular time, and asked him to take charge of my\nwife. And then they asked them, \u201cWhy do you ask me to give them a break? You\u2019re the\nfamily, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m a doctor. I took care of all of you.\u201d And he was very feeling low, in\nother words, for them asking, however -- may he rest in peace, he\u2019s no longer around, he\nsaid he\u2019ll do the work free of charge. And he was a renowned gynecologist in Chicago,\non Michigan Avenue, which the price was pretty high. But as a gesture of his own, he\nwent and did -- because my wife had to have Caesarian section, she had a letter with it --\nwith her from the fir -- from my daughter was born, she had by Caesarian section, she\ncouldn\u2019t have it any other way. So he gave -- he only told us, you cannot go through the\nclinic, you must go through the regular channels, because through the clinic they may not\nhave me doing the surgery, and I wanted him to do the surgery at that particular time.\nAnd when I -- after my son was born, when I came to the office with my wife for a visit, I\nbrought a -- a -- a bunch of roses, at that time he yelled at me. \u201cI thought you can\u2019t afford\nit, and that\u2019s why I helped you. Why did you have to spend the money on the flowers?\u201d\nSo he was really a righteous type of a person, which I always remember, and I -- and\nBlumenfeld, I-I think was his name, and -- it is name. And he was not Jewish, he was a\nGentile. So in other words, I like always, for posterity\u2019s sake, to remember that there\nwere always some people in cl -- even if they were not Jews, they were Gentiles, but they\nwere generous. That\u2019s why we have in Israel, the Righteous Gentile\u2019s walk. And\nwhenever I\u2019m in Yad Vashem, I go through that, to read names and so on. At a time\nwhen I was honored here, there was a Righteous Gentile, was honored to the same time, a\nwoman who saved seven Jews. Of course, instead of the whole eyes of the audience\nwould go to my case, as being a platoon commander on the partisans, she was deservedly\nso, which I understand, after all, she saved seven Jews, being a Gentile, and she got, sort\nof the place, much more than me. And so like I say, so many things that happened\nthrough that era, afterwards, even though to some people, it\u2019s a novice story, because\nthey didn\u2019t hear enough of the resistance. But whenever it gets ex-exposed, I can tell --\nsay that much with a full mouth, that people understand it, and they\u2019re eager to hear about\nit more and more. So I can only hope and pray someday that my manuscript should be\npublished, and people should be able to read it in a more detailed way, the way all of that\nhorror went through, and how victory came, that I survived.",
        "Q: I wanted to find out about your journey to the United States. It was by ship, I assume.",
        "A: By ship, yeah.",
        "Q: And do you remember anything about the journey, the name of the ship, your arrival --",
        "A: Yes, yes, I\u2019ll tell you the whole thing. You want me on?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Okay, it was a little problem since usually, when we applied to come, and we had the\nvisa already to go to the United States, the Joint, at that particular time wanted to\nintervene to help some of the people, and I thought Ill go through them, too, while their -\n- my relatives needed help in one way or the other. Anyways, they wanted to give me\npassage, and where did they find the passage? On a Soviet ship. And I refused take him --\nto go with a Soviet ship, because basically, as I aforementioned, I didn\u2019t trust the Soviets,\neven they should have been on a journey taking me to y -- to the United States. So I\nrefused to go passage. And you know, visas have a certain expiration times, I couldn\u2019t\nplay around with much. The passage available until my expiration of the visa was so --\nwas very little choices to be made, besides that Russian ship. So I was told by them that\nthe only way for me to go would be best to meet the visa time that I have to go by air, to\nfly to the United States. And I did not -- I was not at that particular time ready with\nflying. Therefore, we had to -- I had -- I had to -- I could get passage on the Vulcania,\nwhich it was going to meet the date. However, the Vulcania had only opening on second\nclass, as you know, they have always grades of classes. It was normally with third class,\nbut they had second class only open passage for us to go, everything else was booked up.\nSo I had to go to the family, both time [indecipherable] my wife family, and my family to\n-- about the passage. And sure enough, they wired the money, so we could get the\npassage to go on that ship, on the Vulcania. The Vulcania was a luxury vessel, there is no\nquestion about it, and especially riding on second class was another thing that I did not\nknow how to take it, because with all the misery of life that we went through -- in Italy it\nwas better, but it still was not like living in apartment and a -- enjoying, you know what I\nmean they -- everything a human beings are ma -- ine -- are desire -- not only that they\nwant to, but they\u2019re entitled to have. So this was coming in like to a new world on that\nship. My -- be -- when we started to sail from Naples, until they hit the Gibraltar, it was\ngood sailing, because we were told, you know, the first thing you get on the ship, you get\nsick and all of that, and we went out even that night, and then [indecipherable] near the\nGibraltar, I went outside the deck and even bought some -- some liqueur, you know what\nI mean, because for a dollar you could buy a nice bottle of liqueur to bring it to the\nUnited States, I figured for gifts or so on. And no sooner the next morning when we\nstarted sailing, my wife took sick. She couldn\u2019t take this. When we had to cross the\nstorm, to -- they -- when it was crossing, at that particular time, I almost was sick. But my\ndaughter, being 22 months old, like I say, a little child, they usually can withstand it and\nthey don\u2019t get sick. And each time, she would speak -- my daughter -- Yiddish at the\ntime, or Italian, because kids learn fast languages. And each time she would say, \u201cThe\nboat, the boat is,\u201d you know what I mean, turning? Because from the storm, you used be\nthrown away, and be the time. And I had to -- not was -- I could do to my wife, because\nshe was confined and the nurse was giving her injections, whatever it is. And my little\ngirl just kept me busy, because we going with the stairs, up and down. A child is a child.\nShe didn\u2019t care it\u2019s a storm. And each time I had to keep her that sh -- because when the\nship -- that she shouldn\u2019t get hit or hurt. And it was -- we were delayed because of that\nstorm, whole day that we came in later. We were supposed to come in -- in on a Friday,\nwe came in on Saturday, which it was late, and we didn\u2019t disembark on a Sunday. Only\nwhen we saw harbor, that\u2019s when my wife came to, and she was back to herself, so she at\nleast -- otherwise she -- you know, she wasn\u2019t sick, per se, with any special sicknesses,\nbut she was seasick. So once we looking at the lights, and see the harbor, it sort of was,\nnow we looking at the new world, we are about to come and start our new life that we\npromised ourselves to be. So it -- we didn\u2019t mind it once she got well, and we had a big\ngroup of people coming to wit -- to meet us at the border -- at -- I mean there, at the -- to\nsee us from the boat, it was a lot of her family, that she had more than mine. There were\ncousins, like one cousin was my father\u2019s cousin, which I knew the family quite well, and\nthey were also. And then from there we were taken to a house, oh she\u2019s already deceased\nby now, which it was a first cousin of my wife. And they had a little child at home, too.\nAnd after a few days, that cousin of my father, Louie was his name, he came, took us to\nhis place, because he had a home, and there was more room in his home for us to be\ntaken. And of course, I must say at that time, charity began with the family right there.\nThat morning, you know, he took me shopping, his wife took my wife shopping, bought\nus clothing, you know what I mean, because we came -- we made -- I made tailor made\nsuits over there from the money my parents -- my relatives used to send me packages,\nand with the packages used to be chocolate, and it used to be cigarettes. So they helped\nme of all kinds of troubles. When my wife had to have the Caesarian section there, which\nI'd rather leave a whole part of the story, but Pll only inject over here, the cigarettes, and\nthe chocolates --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: -- and I would go to the marketplace and buy a chicken, and chicken soup was the\ngood remedy that we always know about. So I would cook, even. But all of that was\nbecause of the cigarettes, and the nuns would be very friendly. They gave me a cot that I\ncould sleep at night. Because after surgery, for 24 hours, they were primitive in those --\n\u201948, in Italy -- I mean, my daughter was born in \u201946. When I came in \u201948 to the United\nStates, and my son had to be born in 49, I was like a fantasy. It -- to what it take, a whole\nmonth for her to get well, within two -- three days, she was on her feet. And that\u2019s how\nmuch advanced the American medical system was versus what it was in Italy.",
        "Q: Were there any other -- was it just you and your wife, and your daughter that came\ntogether on the ship, or did you come with anyone else you knew?",
        "A: No, we came with other friends that we met on the boat, but they -- their lives --\nsurvival was in the Soviet Union. They escaped to the Soviet Union when four -- 1941\nwhen the Germans attacked, again. So they were living in -- in Jasia. And, I mean, they\nwere suffering, but 1t was normal war suffering, shortages of this, ashu -- but the threat of\nlife did not exist with them. We met them, and as a matter of fact, they remained friends\nwith -- he is gone already, by now, but with his wife, even up to this day that we made\nfriends then, and we still remain friendly, and we had sort of a club together, and the\norganization together, and so on.",
        "Q: They ended up in Chicago as well?",
        "A: Sure. They came to Chicago like we did, so we had a lot in common for starters, you\nsee? They also came to family in Chicago. We went to high school to-together in Austin\nHigh. They were living in Austin, though, while I was living in Chicago, which it made a\ndifference, that\u2019s why my traveling was more. But we graduate school at the same time,\nand he s -- he still has a brother alive that they -- we\u2019ve bi -- was -- with school -- in\nschool with me at the same time.",
        "Q: What were their names, the --",
        "A: Sofferstein is their name. Th-The both -- two brothers, and I -- and the other --they\nboth were married, you know what I mean, and have children, and we got to know them\nthen, and we still, like I say, maintain to be f -- to be friendly together.",
        "Q: What were your first impressions of the United States? When you arrived in New\nYork, what were -- what did you -- what were your impressions of New York?",
        "A: To say the least, I would say, I really saw a world that I haven\u2019t witnessed before. Not\nbecause of the atrocities, but it was so much difference in living, to know that you have a\ntoilet in the same apartment, which -- who would dream about it otherwise than in a\nhotel. In Poland, you know, before the war, to see something like that, running water,\nwhere in 1939, when the war broke out, we still had to ment -- to bring our water in in a\nbucket, from going to -- you know, to a well, or whatever it is outside. So it was just like\nan oasis in the desert would be the easiest description for me to make the comparison, or\nthe analogy at the time, that it was.",
        "Q: How were your spirits at that time?",
        "A: My spirits were very uplifted. I really felt at that time that I survived. Until then, we\ndid not talk each other, oh we survived, or this, that, and the other. And because people\nwere asking, but it\u2019s a cute story that 1t happened in New York with whole family, with\nmy wife\u2019s -- it was an aunt, her mother\u2019s sister, that we were invited for dinner there. And\nof course, everybody was eager to hear how we survived, and what had went on. I kept\ntalking and telling the people til about three in the morning, and afterwards I was\nangered. I was angered because the questions, after I told them all, two guys says over\nthere, \u201cSo how did you survive?\u201d And it\u2019s sort of to say, \u201cI just told you how we\nsurvived. We escaped.\u201d But it was so unbelievable to them to listen. It was so remote\nthat, in other words, that they had to ask me that question, so how did we survive. So, like\nI say, I was anger, but I tried to be understanding. I says, after all, 1f somebody would\nhave told me about a story like that, by me not being there, how would I react? I would\nnot know how to react about a case like that either. I usually make the analogy, if people\ntell you about Vietnam, or they tell you about the My Lai massacre, or anything like that,\nit\u2019s hard to make a judgement for someone who hasn\u2019t been there. But if you talk to a\nsoldier who has been there, and he tells you that, I take it for granted that he told me the\nstory, because I know how my story when I tell people who haven\u2019t witness, or been\naround, it\u2019s very hard to make them see, or believe, above all, believe the story that a b --\nstory was exactly the way it happened. And this is why it\u2019s a commonology about it, that\nwhen you talk to survivors, do not take for granted that the next guy you talk with, had\nhad the same past as the first one you talk, or the third one that you may talk. And it was\nproven in the documentation sent over, they took interviews from so many survivors, that\nhardly could have been two or three stories that you could make, oh it\u2019s the same thing.\nThe only same thing was the German, the Nazis, the beating, you know, perhaps, and so\non. But the way it came all about was totally difference and -- and by now a lot of people\nare aware, more than they were let\u2019s say 1948, when we came to the United States. But it\nwas a total, total strange story. Some of them told us that [indecipherable] in the papers,\nthey didn\u2019t know anything about it, which later on, when I began to find other findings, I\nwas a tremendous critic about it, because there is no way in the world that a ship, the\nSaint Louis, who came and wanted to dock in Florida, right here, that it could have\nhappened. I believe for -- in posterity, a hundred years, 200 years from today, when the\nkids\u2019Il read it in history, it will not come to them. They will say, something 1s not told\naccurately that it could have been that a ship with a hundred people. We know more from\nhistory now that Hitler tried to prove it, that the Jews are not want -- and here America let\nthem plu -- prove it. That\u2019s why, when we talk about books that have been published,\n\u201cThe Secret War Against the Jews,\u201d for instance, by John Loftus, for one, or others,\npeople know more about it today. But at the time, in the era, and it -- when that happened,\nthe event, it\u2019s hard for me, even a survivor, to understand how that could have happened\nwithout demonstrations. How it could have happened without better judgement than the\nAmerican people and the American government had made not to let in that ship.",
        "Q: But people were asking you about your experiences, and were interested?",
        "A: Yes, people are very interested after they ask. But some people are afraid to ask\nbecause they feel like they are hurting us, the survivors, by revealing the past, what had\nhappened. For instance, I want to inject one more time, even if I do it to the other tape.\nTil this day, we never sat down with our kids, or grandchildren, and tell them. I gave\nthem my manuscript to read. In fact, they didn\u2019t read it. Not why they didn\u2019t read it. I\nbelieve they can put themselves together to face us, and say, \u201cLook what our parents, or\ngrandparents went through.\u201d I\u2019m understanding to the fact. So, when we sit down about a\ncertain thing, or when I write to the papers, and they read it -- I have one of my\ngranddaughters that w -- just got married a-about a few weeks ago. And I was writing\npoems, and I have one poem, Dermarterology, when I wrote Dermarterology, and I asked\nin it the question, sort of why did the world have to have a Holocaust? Did-Didn\u2019t the 10\ncommand-mandments that we gave to the world, didn\u2019t all the other things, with so many\nNobel prize winning, and everything, satisfy the world for the good we brought to them?\nWhy did it have to have the Holocaust? And she was always eager to read if a -- an\narticle, and I wanted basically to let her read, much better than tell my daughter. I don\u2019t\nknow why I felt that way, but that what it was. And she said to me more than once about\nmy poems -- because my poems are interjected how I escaped to the forests, some of my\npoe -- I ask in one of my poe -- poems, I ask to God, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you grant me some\nwings, so I could fly from tree to tree, until I will come to freedom?\u201d I mean, the whole\npoem deals with it. And the other one that I have, I -- a dream, like I dreamed that I will\nbe able to escape from all the -- the -- the bad things that it\u2019s going on in the ghetto, and\nso on. So I\u2019m saying in me, it\u2019s imbedded, the whole life. And my granddaughter said to\nme at the time, me -- as a ch -- she must have been a child, probably, that I\n[indecipherable] about it, must have been eight or nine years of age. And she said, \u201cPapa,\nhow come all your poems, or your writing 1s so sad?\u201d I says, \u201cMarissa, I lived a sad life. I\ncannot go out to put in -- in it happy occasions. So when I write about that I,\u201d you know,\nlike I told her the other poem, when I described in it I wish God would give me those\nwings so I could fly, and then I come to the end. \u201cOh God, you didn\u2019t grant me the wings,\nand I will be sitting and cry for always and forever,\u201d you know what I mean, about it. I\ndon\u2019t say I will die. That I don\u2019t bring out. Somehow or other, in all my punishment, I did\nnot use wordings of dying or thinking -- I always was thinking of life. And maybe that\nwas what I needed to survive, is the positive part, to fight if 1t\u2019s necessary, whatever it is.\nSo, all in all to say I was involved with all of these here things, on every occasion\ndaneech, even though, at the time when I raised little children -- I took, in 1953, as I -- I\ndon\u2019t know, I believe I forementioned it, the audacity to go to write a manuscript in\nEnglish. I felt so goo -- sure, I knew how to write, but I did not know literally how to\nwrite, but to me, I didn\u2019t care what\u2019s it\u2019s missing, you know, because I always left it to\nthat literary agent, which I paid for, and didn\u2019t do nothing for me, and who knows\nwhether he\u2019s still alive, or to the other one. But I wanted the story. I would not -- if I\nwould have be locked in in a room today, like we are right now, and say, \u201cHarold, tell me\nthe story, it wa -- in your manuscript,\u201d I probably would not be able to tell it in the way it\nhappened. I probably would not be able to tell -- remember all the names, dates for sure\nnot, you know what I\u2019m saying. Well, but, for these things, there is such thing as\ndocuments, you can always add in things. So that\u2019s what it was, my part. I only wanted to\nput up as good of my memory as I remembered what I went through. It was a party\nbefore they broke out in Poland, which I mention over there. So it\u2019s no use me revealing.\nI live with all of this here history. When I speak to people, for instance, I must say it over\nhere, which I couldn\u2019t say it there, I\u2019m bilingual in eight languages, and I speak them\nfluently. And when I speak to people, and I\u2019Il start turning from Spanish into Hebrew, or\ninto Russian, or into Polish, and that\u2019s in me -- in business it helped me a lot, especially\nin Chicago. There\u2019s a lot of bilingual usage that you could -- being here in Florida, the\nsame thing, we get people from all ur -- of Europe, and when I can turn around in a\nminute -- but I must confess here, I reserve myself in not speaking a language which it\nhappened a few times. When I started to speak German to a German fellow, and all of a\nsudden he removed his shirt, and he wants to try on a shirt. I was working in Galleria\nMall at that particular time, for the -- name of the store was The Forum. And I took a\nlook [indecipherable], here I saw underneath his arm -- the SS used to have this here, that\nwas their code, where it was r -- put over there, underneath there -- or the Gestapo, who\nknows where he could have bi -- when I saw that, I -- I turned colors, I c -- I was -- I was\n-- asked that I want to go to the washroom, just to go away from the man, if not to lose\nmyself. So when I -- like we were in Israel a year and a half ago, and we [indecipherable]\nover there, in that hotel, they were maybe 40 percent of Germans, young, of the ages of\nmy kids, and with their children, I did not feel restricted of myself to speak German to\nthese people. And -- but all in all, I -- I meet people because I am so involved with it, so\nto one I can speak Polish, while in -- two seconds later, 1] switch over to Russian, or\nfrom Russian to Spanish, or to Hebrew, and people always have -- how could I remember\nall of that at one time? And this 1s -- was my own idea, I don\u2019t know how good my\nmemory will serve as I age, you know what I\u2019m saying? So, it was always importance to\nme to bring out in me. I believe someday some student will probably want to make this\nhere a lesson, and to talk about to other children, which is of importance. And I hope that\nthey always get -- that they always can remember when you have a bad times, don\u2019t look\nfor the half empty glass, look for the half full glass. Hope should never be lost. We\u2019Il die\nanyways, we all know that. We cannot preserve that. But hoping to die, you will die\nsooner. Hoping to live, you will live longer. And it\u2019s not just a phraseology of words, it\u2019s\na thing that it\u2019s -- really works. And you talk to prisoners of war -- we did -- we talked to\na man like Mr. McCain, who was in prison with the Vietnamese, or you talk anybody\nwho was in prison, and they survived. They will tell you in the same words that I am\nsaying, they couldn\u2019t overcome their ordeal, be in Iran, be in Vietnam, be in Korea, be\never -- anyplace that a prisoner of war was taken, if hope would not be lost. Because\nwhen hope is lost, that\u2019s what it happens, it\u2019s lost, life 1s lost. So, my message 1s always\nof importance. When I talk about the better deal, not to forget to have that listener hear\nthat hope to live. So when I speak to young kids, high school kids and student -- or\nstudents, or even in colleges which I spoke, I always do not give answer. The hardest\nthing was for me when I spoke to kids in school of years back -- which I have some on\ntape also, and they ask me how many Germans did I kill? And how do you go ahead to\nanswer a child in school when he ask me a raw question like that? And it\u2019s a hard way to\nanswer. I must therefore, instead of giving him an answer to say, \u201cOh, I killed probably\n20, or 30, or 50,\u201d which it would mean I would go ahead to look at a personal thing,\nremember the questioner, remember that he is the child of 14 and 15, and I do not want to\ngive him that answer, that life -- answer is the weapon, and killing is the answer. So I\nalways must bring it to him the idea, that yes, killing is not right, but defending oneself is\nthe right that he must never forget, no matter who it 1s, when your life is threatened, you\nalso have the law of rights for you to go ahead and defend your life. So when I tell that to\nthe kids, they get a bi -- they get a different understanding about weapons, and about\nkilling. And this is usually, when I spoke to kids today, it would not matter where. I\nspoke seven years in a row that I used to be here in Fort Lauderdale, and I used to make\nthe Day of Remembrance -- Remembrance Days, in city hall. And I remember the first\nmayor that time, that adopted for me to do it was Mayor Kaminski. And the biggest\nquestion always used to be, why did I want to chose that I want to speak in city hall? And\nafter I explained it to him, they saw my way 1s right. I say, you must remember that all\nour sufferings, it started in buildings like that. Whether laws were changed, or the laws\nwere taken away. I want to be proud of the idea that I survived, and we have seen a time\nwhere we can come back to these buildings, and salute the freedom we have in America,\nand the freedom that it should be of democracy throughout the world, that yes, there is a -\n- arepayment day to be proud of, that we changed the evil days, and this 1s what it was,\nmy message in the same way when I came to speak in front of the justice depart --\njustices in Springfield, Illinois, when the Nazis wanted to march, so if you\u2019re ever\ninterested, go ahead, get the movie, \u201cSkokie,\u201d and you\u2019ll see Danny Kaye play Harold\nZissman in it. And this is what I said, and I was the last speaker, not expected maybe, to\nspeak at all, and when we get it first at the house, with the congressmen, and it was, at\nthat place, it was the military commander the -- from the Jewish war veterans of the state\nof Illinois. It was the commander of the war veterans -- the Jewish war veterans of\nChicago, it was a few congressmen, and everybody was sort of questioning, what subject\nare you going to talk about, what subject is the other one going to talk about? Because we\ndid not want to use the time, in other words, that shu -- two people who should be talking\nit in the same way. When it came to me, I says, \u201cI? I had no title.\u201d Just as it is in the\nmovie, the true words that he picked up. Who knows, maybe I may not even be called to\nsay anything, but today a surprise. Even I was the last person called, when they called my\nname, I came over, and I says, at the time, which the language 1s still fresh with me,\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen of the justices, and justice\u2019s guests, who are here today, I want\nyou all to rise for one moment of silence, today is D-Day.\u201d With the loudest voice I could\nget out. They all rose, and I tuc -- checked my watch. And I says, \u201cNow, you may be\nseated.\u201d Cameramen started running from all side to me, I became the hero, I became the\none. And a guy from a small town in Illinois comes over to me, he says, \u201cMr. Zissman,\nI'd like an interview.\u201d I said, \u201cll be more than happy to give you an interview, but not\ntoday, not now.\u201d I says, \u201cRabbi Montrose and me are going right now back to Skokie,\nbecause my niece, and the rest of the class of the Hebrew school is going to be graduating\ntoday. However, here is my card,\u201d I was an [indecipherable] salesman at that particular\ntime. I says, \u201cYou can call me to my house, I will give time to you, and I\u2019Il make the time\nfor your convenience. Come and see me and I\u2019Il give you all the interview.\u201d The fact\nremains that he did have a beautiful [indecipherable] in some place, like almost to say my\narchives there. And the man, you know, he was not Jewish, he was Gentile, but I moved\nhim, and that\u2019s why he wanted to hear me. All the other speakers, while they were talking\nabout the march, I didn\u2019t talk just about a march [indecipherable]. I just come with a --\nthat -- the minute of silence, I says, \u201cSo many years ago, our boys and girls went to\nEurope to fight Nazism, so that menace should never be seen nor heard.\u201d The judiciary\ncommittee at that particular time wanted to pass on a law that freedom of speech yes, but\nto go on the paraphernalia, with the swastikas and everything like that, the way the Nazis,\nespecially the SS, and Gestapo were dressed, that is not necessary to do, because\nwhatever we tried at that time, on the jer -- Phil Donohue show, which I forced my way\nthrough, and I repeat something, probably you heard of it. Talked to Goldberger, I wanted\nto make the separation between freedom of speech, and attack on people\u2019s life. And that\u2019s\nbasically what the march was all about. They did not -- if they want to speak, they didn\u2019t\nhave to come to Skokie, they can speak anyway. But they wanted to come to Skokie for\nthe reason that survivors of the Holocaust were living by such multitudes there, and\nthrow the venom that we don\u2019t deserve to be alive. Now, this is a different than free\nspeech, this is a threat to life, and I believe the First Amendment never was intended to\nmake a threat of life. We used to say that hi -- il -- you know, saying fire in a crowded\ntheater is against the law. Okay, but this is another saying. Now, a threat of a life of a\nperson cannot be tolerated, be -- who it may be, be against Jews, be against Asians, be\nagainst Blacks or anybody else. It has no place in a society, of the 20 -- of the millenium\nthat we entering right now to exist. And this has always been my fight about it. And\nthat\u2019s why I -- I -- we tirelessly, no matter I work hard, I still -- I just stopped working for\na little while right now, because my granddaughter\u2019s marriage, but I may go back to work\n[indecipherable], I\u2019ll see how my health will permit me. But it never took away from me\nthe time to sit down behind the typewriter and write an article to the paper. A lot of times\nI\u2019m not published, and they try, perhaps to discourage me, but no one, as long I will live,\nand my mind will be silent -- will be in good shape, and it\u2019ll be sane, will anybody give\nme any problems that I will not be able to speak my mind up against someone. Sure, I\nwrote an article against Haider now in Austria, it was not published, but I spoke up.\nMaybe these words may change the editor, okay? So be whatever situations that has -- 1-1t\nhappens in the United States, of all the years that I\u2019ve been here. I always was vocal, and\nI will remain vocal for as long as I live, to bring the story out. It\u2019s not just to tell about the\nHolocaust, it\u2019s to tell to prevent another Holocaust every to occur, and it doesn\u2019t have to\nbe a Holocaust against the Jews, the Holocaust against anybody else. The Holocaust only\nhappened because too many minds were silent. What it happens right now with Haider, in\nAustria, which openly -- and we will see, with those people who think mine -- that he has\nno place in government. For as long -- because he says I\u2019m sorry I said that, it still lives\nin him. For as long people have in their minds against certain people, which I said it in\nmy article there -- he was against the immigration with comes in. Who made them be\nimmigrants if it wouldn\u2019t be for the Nazis at their time, where Austria was a part. So we\nmust, and understand always, these situations. There\u2019s so many lies came out in print\nbecause they knew somebody. I\u2019Il never forget, I had a fight, and I lost it. I lost the fight.\nAbout thr -- about three years ago, that time when my other daughter was married\n[indecipherable] -- my granddaughter, the first one, and 1t was in West Palm Beach. And\nin West Palm Beach, we have a lot of these haters in there, be that they\u2019re neo-Nazis, Ku\nKlux Klan, you name it. Be from the church, or whatever. They are there, they find they\nare th -- and an article was there, written by a man who 1s a novelist writer, he is not a\nhistorian, and he came saying that the Auschwitz [indecipherable] about Germany has got\nto stop. So he tries to bring out, why not look at the good things? And the man came and\nbrought out that in Berlin, that the Berliners were hidden 10,000 Jewish families. Now,\nwhen I saw that -- I was reading the paper [indecipherable] that morning, and I was all\nshaken up. 10,000 1s a multitude. If he was to say at least a hundred, maybe it would have\nbeen cor -- not questionable, but it would have been believable. But that multitude,\n10,000? And I wrote a -- an article to the paper, and asking them. I says, \u201cDon\u2019t you think\nthat Yad Vashem in Israel would have any knowledge about that, so they would go ahead\nto,\u201d -- they did for single people who saved a Jewish family, planted a tree in his name\nand everything. I said, \u201cThe Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., don\u2019t you think\nthey would have had a record of something like that?\u201d But it falls on deaf minds. I called\nbefore that, because I think maybe I didn\u2019t hear it, but I know, I am pretty much in tune to\nall of these here things that are happening, but my article of rebuttal, never appeared. And\nthis is why we must have more people be outspoken, be in script, be vocal. And we must\nnot remain just to ourselves, \u201cOh, you can\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d That\u2019s the negative\nattitude, which I said. We must look at it positive. When it\u2019s a time to speak out, we must\nspeak out. Otherwise, democracy will never be a democracy, but that\u2019s the whole idea of\ndemocracy, that everybody is entitled to their opinion. So while we guard honor to exist,\nwe must guard of these reactionary forces, that they never should take hold again, to\nwhatever they have in mind. And you know -- we know whatever they have in mind, one\nagainst the other, and that\u2019s what they come, and become -- you know what I mean. To\nsettle -- they kill both of them, and that\u2019s all there is to it.",
        "Q: Let me ask you, y-you\u2019re obviously -- do you want to take a break?\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number three, side A, of an interview with Harold Zissman. I wanted to st-\nstay with the time of your arrival in the United States a little bit more, and get some more\ndetails about what happened. And -- and also, if you could comment on -- y -- obviously\nyou were ver -- you\u2019re very aware of the American judicial system, and -- and the\nimportance of the laws, and how they affect people, and your involvement at Skokie\nspeaks to that, too. So maybe you could talk about how you became a US citizen, and --",
        "A: Okay, that\u2019s -- will be good.",
        "Q: -- and what that meant to you.",
        "A: When I came to United States in 1948, I believe the first thing on my mind was in the\npositive, how do I become a citizen of the United States. I filed my first papers, as we call\nthem, as soon time permitted to be done for it, and -- and at -- when I was called was\nalmost five years later to become a citizen, and I proudly am happy that I was granted the\n-- first of all, that I was granted life again, because I consider that\u2019s -- I was rebor --\nreborn, I, my wife, and my daughter, coming to the United States. We -- some people of\nours, the survivors want to come, that we were reborn, at freedom time when -- when the\nhostilities ended. But to me, I don\u2019t want to call it that it was still life. To me, the\nimpression that I made, the first class, 1n the ship that I thub -- the same thing, even\nthough our apartment, the first apartment was in a basement, and we were there with a\nchild, and a few months later, my brother-in-law came. So even though there was a lot of\nthings to be dissatisfied about, but my satisfaction, like I forementioned, be going to\nschool, be all of the other things, belonging again to an organization. So I can see that my\nlife had started -- I was reborn in 1948 with my wife, and I hope the man above, or the\nperson above, that God remembers that not to account my years before, and that would\nbeen a great favor that I can ask. The United States as a government, I had a lot of\ndissatisfaction in my mind with the Roosevelt era, and at times it was hard on me to go\nahead to throw it away. I know being a history student, and being involved with the\nthings in Italy, I knew n -- quite well about a person from Switzerland who came that he\nwas working, and telling over here, he -- the ordeal of the Jews, what it was on. And it\nwas at a time in \u00b042, when Hitler already had made the dimension of the le -- Final\nSolution, or Judenrein, but the Final Solution, that was image. I know well enough the\nstory where the partisans in Poland, who sent all their messages to England, and it went\nin a safe world. So like I say, 1t was a rebirth for me, coming to see freedom. And I\nsuppose when a person is frees, that\u2019s how your questions become open, because in other\nwords, when I was under the Soviet Union, I couldn\u2019t ask some of the questions that it\ncame up to me in the United States. I couldn\u2019t ask why would the British at that particular\ntime, keep hidden that story that -- that it was told, that the final solution, by Goebbels\nwhen he allows -- that they\u2019Il rid themselves of the Jews of all Europe, why would that\nhave to be in a safe sill? Perhaps the Jewish community in Britain would have maybe\nreact to it, I understand, and that\u2019s why they kept it from them. But in America, under the\nRoosevelt administration, knowing full well at that time that a delegate came, and telling\nall of that, and since the United States, at that particular time, under the Roosevelt\npresidency did not see fit to give any help whatsoever, to stop the menace of destruction\nthat it went on in Auschwitz, and so on, by ohm -- what that means. I know full well at\nthat -- this -- this story of the rabbi from Cleveland, who went at that particular time to\nintervene to the president, and what came out of it. He came out with that message, don\u2019t\nrock the boat. All of these here parts of hate, and what had happened to all of us became\nrenewed follen -- during freedom. But above all, I wanted to become one of the\nAmericans, in spite of all of this. In a way, I thought maybe, speaking as an American\ncitizen, it would help my grief to speak out a little bit better. And therefore, things got, in\n1953, I was -- became a proud citizen, and quiet I did not remain. I was vocal, and\nwhatever I could write -- even I didn\u2019t care that my writing was not as good as that\nAmerican who perhaps was born, and had more schooling in English than I did. I was\nproud about the other thing, that I could speak more languages than the average\nAmerican.",
        "Q: Will you list the languages that you speak?",
        "A: Yes. First of all, I must say, as I said it in the aforementioned tape, I graduated in\nPoland, a school by the name Yavna, which is a Zionist Hebrew school, and it\u2019s a\ntrilingual school. We were taught over there Yiddish, Hebrew, and English. So\nimmediately, I started with three schools. I usually say to people when they ask me, how\ndoes it happen that you speak eight la-languages, I say invention -- I say, if a person\u2019s in\ntrouble, he says, he must invent something. So, the American proverb goes with it, and\nthat\u2019s what it was invention, for me. With three languages, when we crossed the border\non the Russian side, I had to learn Russian. Afterwards, after the war, when we came into\nItaly, I did not know Italian, so I learned Italian. While being under the German yoke, it\nwas not a question learning German because I loved that language, it was a question that\nwhen a German spoke to you, and you didn\u2019t understand what he was saying, the beating\nwas worse. However, even if you did do what he wanted, you still got a beating. But you\nhad to -- so again, it was necessity, was for me to learn another language. So no matter\nhow much I learned German, but I could at least speak, and converse with someone in\nGerman. So we have three, and two is five, and the sixth one, came to Italy again. You\ncome to a country, is strange, beautiful people, I wish it would have been this type of --\nside of the ocean, I don\u2019t ever leave them. They didn\u2019t care to say Jew. To them it was\npolacko. Seeing as I was coming from Poland, I\u2019m Polish. And when you said to them\nthe word Jew, or Hebraio, they did not even know what the meaning of it, especially in a\ncountry like that, where Mussolini, and fa -- fash -- if -- if you call Fascism Fascism,\nstarted it way before Hitler. But the people were not drilled on the hatred. If anybody\nhated a Jew, perhaps he hated somebody else, too, because he was a hater. But I didn\u2019t\nfeel it. The hospitality of these people, what they had to us, is beyond reproach. You ask\nan Italian person, you show him with an address here and there, he wouldn\u2019t tell you it\u2019s\nthere, or down the street, next block. He\u2019d take you there. This, to us, at that particular\ntime, case is need, but I still tried to learn Italian. So, you have -- you have six languages\nby then. When I started making my papers, I did not want to come to America, not be\nable to turn my tongue. So, as dearly as I was living on charity sort of, but going to a\nprivate teacher -- to a tutor, I and another friend of mine, we went away to take up\nEnglish. So, as you see, one after the other, one after the other was means of necessity.\nWhen I had my store, after the riots that I went into, instead of the grocery business, to\nthe men\u2019s business, even the riots, I must make my point, I was totally destroyed, and 20\nyears of labor went on with smoke. But I went on with life, and I restructured it, I went\ninto the men\u2019s clothing. A tailor recom -- is being recommended to me by a neighbor\nbusinessman, a barber, and he\u2019s a good tailor, I tested him, he knew what to do. But I\ncannot speak Spanish. My wife goes out, and buys me a dictionary, I get another little\nbook, and all of a sudden, within a few months -- so there you make the total of all of it,\nand they come to eight all together. And I\u2019m very proud about it, that I can speak to\npeople with other languages. It never happened to me that if I meet someone, and he\u2019s got\na hard time in the li -- speaking English, but I can, through their dialect recognize the --\none of the languages, and I\u2019m right there -- we already friends, within two minutes,\nbecause the person can talk to me, or ask me qu -- the -- so it becames a friendship. So --\nbut writing, like I say, I only write in English. I did not write to write in any other\nlanguage, not that I couldn\u2019t write in Hebrew, or anything like that, I write, but it\u2019s still\ntoday -- in today\u2019s world, that\u2019s the language of the world. When you know English, you\ncan go anyplace in the world and be heard of or -- or know about. So that was the reason\nthat my languages was not a merit -- matter of scholastically, they were a matter of\nnecessity. And this is exactly why I adopted all of these here things.",
        "Q: Just a little footnote, the first -- the first three languages -- I just wanted to mention, I\nthink there -- there was a slight mistake. When you mentioned the first three language, it\nwas Yiddish, Hebrew, and Polish, right?",
        "A: Right, three.",
        "Q: Okay, you had -- you had mentioned English, okay.",
        "A: Russian is four, and German is five, Italian is six, Spanish is seven, and English is\neight, you know. So there you go, you -- my -- my figures are accurately [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And I -- when you became a citizen, or when you started to -- to settle into the United\nStates --",
        "A: \u201953, I went in business, and became a citizen at the same time. In 1953, I became a\ncitizen, and in January of 1953, I went in the grocery business. Thanks God, as I\nforementioned, to my father-in-law, that he helped me with the money, otherwise I\u2019d\nnever be able to get started.",
        "Q: Did you come immediately from New York to Chicago?",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, I was in New York only when I -- when I came about -- it\u2019s immediately\n-- I spent about three weeks in New York. And therefore, we came in March, in April we\nwere here already -- to sh -- in Chicago, I mean. So that\u2019s what it was.",
        "Q: And when did you father-in-law come to the United States?",
        "A: He came in 1950. He was in Germany, while we weren\u2019t -- we were, like I told you\nalready, there were -- we were -- we didn\u2019t touch Germany. My brother-in-law came at\nthe end of 1948, and -- no wait, my father-in-law came probably in 1949, not 1950,\nplease forgive me, 1949 he came.",
        "Q: Let me ask you something. Someone else who we interviewed, who was involved in\nthe resistance said that -- that while they were raising their children in the Chicago area,\nthat -- that sometimes they -- they -- they knew s -- there were some American Jews in\nthe neighborhood who wouldn\u2019t let their children play with the children of Holocaust\nSUIVIVOTS.",
        "A: Very true, very true. III tell you mine -- my story now. And this is a documented si-\nsituation. In 1948 -- \u201948 became -- in 1953, I started a business on my own, and between\n1948 and \u00b053, I worked for my uncle, which I said, my mother\u2019s brother -- brothers. Be\nfor what it\u2019s worth, that in about 1955, I already had saved enough money for a down\npayment of a three flat building that I went in Skokie, and I bought it. One day my uncle\ncomes to visit with me. Next door to us, in the other, was only a two flat, not a three flat.\nOver there, they had a boy of my son\u2019s age, which you usually feel good about it, the two\nchildren of the same ages, they had some -- so their son used to come to our house\nsometimes, my son would go to their house, and the two boys used to be playing\ntogether. And I did not want to inject that [indecipherable] that kid was an adopted, but\nfor the sake of it, l-let it be, 1t would not mean any difference. One day when my uncle\nwants to come to visit with us, to see -- in other words, our new apartment, first of all,\nand the building what we bought, because I no longer -- I -- my -- my employment for\nhim stopped in 1953, in December. So he comes in and while we were waiting, next door\nto us, the guy, who used to be called as a nickname Red. \u201cHey Red, how you doing?\u201d My\nuncle says to him, \u201cOh,\u201d he says, \u201cI came here to visit my nephew, you know the nephew\nI brought from Europe.\u201d He gave the moniker right away. And so on, so how you doing,\nhe talks to him because he knew him that he used to be in the clothing business, so on.\nNot telling you a story, but a fact of life, my son\u2019s relationship with his son had stopped\nwithin a few days, and it never woke up again. I did not want to aggravate a situation like\nthat towards my child, you know what I mean. After all, my son was born in 1949, so\nhere we\u2019re talking about 1954, so you know, he was a little boy of, you know, five years\nold, he understands wa -- so, he\u2019s a very -- a child cannot understand this here. So be it.\nSo in school he met with more kids than that, when he started school, which at five, you\nknow what I mean? He didn\u2019t [indecipherable] yet. So we didn\u2019t worry about it. It hurted\nus, what happened. So, the only disruption it could have been, that this way he didn\u2019t\nknow what we Holocaust survivors, you know? Because first of all, we were working too\nhard, and my wife used to take the kids to s -- to the store to bring them, because at that\nparticular time I tried to save as much as I could on help, you know? And besides, I\nborrowed money. I borrowed money from my father-in-law, borrowed money from my\nbrother-in-law, and I had to repay them, so the only way to repay them when you buy a\nsmall store, is to see that a -- you don\u2019t overdue on expenses, you know\u2019? So that was the\npart, which at that time, that we did. So we did not have, basically, enough association\nwith the neighbors around, you know? Was -- when we came, was late at night, when we\nwent away was early in the morning. The store used to be open from -- from about nine\nin the morning, til about six o\u2019clock at night, so you know, it -- it would take, in those\ndays, I will driv -- I started to drive a car 1949, just as my son was born. I fought for\neverything. I wanted to be, to me to become just a regular person, without a moniker, you\nknow what I mean? So to say a lot of times, I would get, through the years, from\nAmerican people, not just that particular case that I forementioned, \u201cHey, I detect an\naccent on you, where you from?\u201d I says, \u201cI\u2019m from hell, but I made it back.\u201d And people\nwould say -- one time a customer in the store said to me, \u201cYou mean from Hell,\nIndiana?\u201d I says, \u201cNo, I did not know that Indiana has a Hell.\u201d He says, \u201cOh yeah, there\nis a place named Hell, in Indiana.\u201d He says, \u201cMy hell comes much further than that.\u201d So,\nthe cus -- the wife -- the customer says, \u201cYou mean, you come from Europe?\u201d I says,\n\u201cYes, the Holocaust is what I forementioned.\u201d So what I\u2019m saying, I always tried to keep\nthis away. Even as of late, when I worked at Bloomingdale\u2019s in Boca Raton, people\nwould come into me, other ones would say, \u201cHey, I just heard you speak another\nlanguage, you spoke Spanish. Where are you coming from?\u201d And I would say the same\nthing, from hell. \u201cSo what happened you acquired all these languages?\u201d I says,\n\u201cNecessity.\u201d Just like the proverb says, is the mother of invention. Necessity is the\nmother of invention. That was with me the case. But people always sort of have a habit\nthat very few inst -- not all -- not all of them, not there, some people take it in a wrong\nkind of a way. You know how to saying goes, if -- if you are ever bitten by a dog, keep a\nstick handy. You know what I am saying? Because not to be bitten again. And this is -- in\nmost cases, it\u2019s a touchy way when you touch it. You know, it\u2019s like electricity, you get\nthat shock. You get an electric shock with the way some people -- oh I know -- I heard all\nabout it. You know what I\u2019m saying? If you heard all about it, you wouldn\u2019t have to ask\nme, obviously, but you do ask me, so it\u2019s still misunderstood, the whole era, even we are\ntalking about 55 years later. And some people, if I has to vocalize on it, will say, if there\nare Jews, or non-Jews, wouldn\u2019t matter with me. The guilt of the citizens, who were\ncomplacent at the era, and who were not mixed up in the politics -- which American\npeople are not mixed up in politics. I don\u2019t know, I could say thanks God, no, and I s --\ncould say the other way around, there\u2019s always two sides to each story, because we see it\nby the record of ame -- percentages of American people who go to -- to vote. I woke -- by\nthe way, I worked for a polling place, and I go do it for quite a few years. The\npercentages comparing Europe and the United States, who go to the polls to vote, is\nridiculous. So that is the same thing what I say, American people basically, until election\ntime don\u2019t count -- don\u2019t talk about the politics so much as people of other countries. So\nlike I say, there 1s perhaps a plus, and a minus in it. Who knows how the outcome would\nhave been different? But the guilt is a guilt in existence. Nobody -- when somebody just\nas recently started to mention for the millenium, talking about presidents. And I don\u2019t\ncare what category they\u2019re going to put in Roosevelt, he had made at that particular time,\nSocial Security, and anything like that, yes, there were good things. But we have a\nproverb in Hebrew that we say, \u201cWherever there is light, there is always a shadow.\u201d And\nwe know it when we speak scholastically from school. When you put in that little stick in\nthe ground, at 12 o\u2019clock the shadow 1s the smallest, but there is a shadow. So you always\nmust understand it, to be understanding to people. There is always going to be that\nshadow, there\u2019s always going to be some people who do not, or did not know well, or\ndon\u2019t understand the situation well, to opinionize certain ways. However, I would not\nlabel it, if anybody comes to ask me with that question. Do you think -- yes, there are.\nBut I always -- I always give the answer why, as I just said it. Either those people are not\naware, or they are guilty. They are guilty of why the American government, and the\nAmerican people did let it happen the way it happened. And this is always going to be a\nmatter -- how do you going to bring the time back, with those people back, to be judged\nthere.",
        "Q: Let me ask you something, did you talk -- when you first arrived, and you had -- and\nyou were meeting with your family in the United States, and yo -- did you ask them these\nquestions at all, or did you talk about these issues?",
        "A: I was vocal about it right there and then. The majority people gave me an answer, we\ndid not know. And I used to madly answer them, that\u2019s the story I heard with the German\npeople, they say, we didn\u2019t know. But the stench of the concentration camp was in their\nbackyard, and those people came saying they didn\u2019t know. I says, so please, I used to\nchastise tremendously, especially Jewish people, and in my family same way. Please\ndon\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t know. It was publicized everywhere, and you did know. The\npoint was, you were too busy with yourself, because I had gotten answers like these here.\nMy wife used to work in a bakery here, as a clerk, and a lot of times, people would say\nthe same thing. They ask her about accent the first thing, you know, the accent. So,\npolitely you would say, \u201cOh, we\u2019ve -- Holocaust survivor.\u201d \u201cOh, we also had here, we\nhad a depression in here.\u201d So, when a person can go ahead to metaphorize the depression\nwith the Holocaust, I believe that\u2019s a very low tone, and low way of doing it. I wrote, for\ninstance, to the paper, they published it, but they fixed my clock, they put in just a few\nsentences. That editorialist writer tried to take Mozambique, and all the other places, and\ncompare it with the Holocaust. I, a few times wrote it, and the last time I don -- I don\u2019t\nget tired of writing, and I asked, how dare? I says, \u201cThe Jews did not ask for territory.\nThe Jews did not ask for any recognition as far as government, or anything like that. But\nin Mozambique, or in the other place, those are people who are fighting political wars,\nand religious wars. Where do you compare these with the Holocaust? The Holocaust had\nnothing of that nature. The Holocaust was just done, provoked by a government, made up\nlaws in Nuremberg, and for one reason, because you were born Jewish, therefore you\ndeserved to die. Or that\u2019s -- give them the right to kill you, or all kinds of other reasons.\u201d\nWhich, you say how ca -- how can people, in their sane mind, make that comparison, be\nthat it\u2019s Kosovo, be that it\u2019s Mozambique. Yes, it happens there, yes, there are atrocities\nthere. Yes, the Serbs wanted to get -- get rid of the Albanians. Yes, the Catholics don\u2019t\nappreciate the Moslems. Yes, the Moslems maybe don\u2019t like the Jews, or the others. We\nknow that there will be dissatisfaction. But the usage of the word holocaust cannot, and\nshould never be made over such a analogy to interpret it. Because no matter which\ndictionary in the world, be Webster\u2019s or anybody else, they mix in a word of sacrifice,\nburning. Yes, we were the sacrifice for the hungry lions of Germany. I said it in my\nmanuscript. Of course, the rewrite doesn\u2019t bring out these kinds of sentences. But that\u2019s --\nwhat -- I cannot stand that word, that -- that word holocaust, when you read from a\ndictionary, or certain dictionaries to say it\u2019s a burning, it\u2019s a sacrifice. I cannot a-answer\nthat. The Holocaust was a definitely -- meaning by a government from their top level, to\nthe man on the street, that he was ordered, if he didn\u2019t want it -- to do it, that this 1s the\nway he was graded. That was the difference between going to the front lines, or being in\nthe concentration camps, and be a commander there, or whatever it 1s. What they got\nfrom everything, including the gold teeth that they tore out, or the watches and rings that\ntook away, to send to their loved ones, or to accumulate all what they did.",
        "Q: So are you tel -- are you saying you have trouble with the word, the term holocaust, as\nit\u2019s used?",
        "A: I have the trouble for always and forever, when anybody tried to analogize, or\nmetaphorize the word holocaust to anything that 1s going on. I give you an example.\nGhetto is another one that I have a problem with. When Harlem is called a ghetto, I wish\nto the world that they would only be living in these type of ghettos, and believe me there\nwould not have been a such thing. When we define ghettos, we must always define the\nghetto where are we talking about. The ghetto of Rome? The ghetto of Venice, which it\nwas the first? And because of grata, came into ghetto, because it was the steel bars that it\nwas made around there, and it was near a foundry, but that name was fine. So the first\nghetto. Or, do we talk of the ghetto of Rome, that the Jews were put there, and only for\none reason, become Catholic, and you\u2019re free. Those little places are still left today.\nWhere it used to be the Jesuits used to come out to the Jews each time they let them out\nfrom the ghetto, they would say, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you become a Christian, and you wouldn\u2019t\nhave to live in here?\u201d When they came back to return to let them into the ghetto, it was\nstill the same [indecipherable]. How can anybody make that analogy to that word ghetto\nto use when the Black people of America were living in their neighborhoods? They were\nliving in their neighborhoods because they felt good. Jews were living in the Bronx, or in\nSkokie because -- not that anybody put them there, because they felt good. But when a\ngovernment puts you in a place, and they make barbed wire, or any kind of enclosure,\nand you have to have a permit to go in, and you have to have a permit going out, and you\ndenied from all freedoms, you become an inhuman. Are you going to compare this here\nwith a [indecipherable] neighborhood. No, I cannot tolerate that. And I doubt it any\nsurvivor from the Holocaust could tolerate. But we know a lot of writers take the law in\ntheir own hands, and the thing they emphasize, to say if 1t was an airplane who was lost,\nand so many, maybe a few hundred people got killed by that, they say it was a total\nholocaust. I don\u2019t know from where they have the audacity, or the shortage of words in\ntheir command, that they have to use that word holocaust, to make the issue be blown up\nmore out of proportion. We are talking about six million human. Sure, somebody will tell\nme that 25 million is what the Nazis brought over. So we\u2019re talking about 19 -- yes, we\nmust establish the old, famous word, that other people than Jews were killed. But the\nJews were meant to be killed. So the other people maybe could have been killed by way,\nbe that they were criminals, be that they were in the way of them, or whatever it is. But\nthe Jewish people were definitely meant, and put by the laws, executed with armies to do\nthat. So how can you analogize something like this, or metaphorize that word for a\nsituation like that, like that woman did to, say Mozambique? So she fixed my clock. She\ngave me about seven or eight lines, instead of like she had a big spread. And that happens\nall the time. Like I started to tell you that story about that -- with the 10,000 Jews that he\nclaimed Berlin had saved. It\u2019s a lie. But the press will pick up these lies fast, and don\u2019t\ngive you an edge, to let you respond in the proper way. So, that\u2019s democracy, I suppose.\nSo, I cannot say any other way. In democracy everybody gets into these here\n[indecipherable]. There will never be a perfect world, there isn\u2019t a perfect family. You\ndon\u2019t have a family, with the same mother and father, and they have three, four kids, and\nall kids are the same. So my expectation, to have a world of such ideals, history proves\nthat it never happened, and I don\u2019t care to what denomination they belong, or to what\nreligion they adopted. We cannot do it. In order to do that, we woulda have to create a\nnew world from A, to start in an -- in an [indecipherable] here, that you cannot leave any\nother way, but everybody\u2019s the same, and everybody feels the same. But we know we\nwill not achieve it, and history\u2019s not going to change. The least we can do 1s fight for the\nrights. But again, I\u2019ll repeat it. To take any situation of -- a situation in history and\nmetaphorize it for another situation, by that same name, is wrong. Doesn\u2019t have to be just\nHolocaust. Could have been any other usage of the word, like I said the word ghetto.\nWhich ghetto are we talking about? Nazi ghetto? We\u2019re talking about -- or the other\nghettos? There was always the casbah in Africa, when we see it in the film. That was also\na means of a ghetto. But that was a separation of doing certain things. A neighborhood is\nnot a ghetto, and let\u2019s -- let -- let\u2019s understand each other. When you have the freedom\nwhere -- to choose where you want to live, even in a restricted area, even, let\u2019s assume\nthe niggers, as they used to be called, which it\u2019s a -- was, I think because of the Niger\nriver, you know what I mean, it was interpret like that, even at that time, they still had the\nopportunity of living on this street, or on that street, they did not go to ask the\ngovernment. They moved on their own. But the -- when we talk eras with Holocaust,\nwhen we talk about eras from the ghetto, that was restricted, you couldn\u2019t, as I just\naforementioned, with the priests, or the Jesuits who would stay there, and tell them, why\ndon\u2019t you join us? So when you get the choice, how can it be so bad about it. As -- in the\nghetto, I used to have to discuss it with my father\u2019s brother, who was a rabbi, and he was\nreminding the 14\" century Spain, and he would say, with his words, can you imagine,\nbecause he was a religious person, he says, \u201cGod had conference with the Jews of Spain,\u201d\nso he let them have a choice, and those who wanted to remain Jews, remained Jews.\nSome were -- that it -- were caught, wound up with the --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: -- to come from work, and I have seen the killings what they did, of children, of so on,\nI used to be shaken up. I used to be shaken up, and I used to come -- I says, children, they\ndid not have time to sin. Why were they murdered? And that again comes to part of the\nanalogy which I\u2019m talking about, or metaphor to say, when killing children, are you\ngoing to compare this here to other situations? No, there is no comparison to that. That\nwas a unique situation, and it must for history -- historical events, or history for the\nfuture, remain a unique event what it happened. We see a lot of times of atrocities that it\nhappened to people, but for as long governments were involved in these atrocities, it\ndoesn\u2019t become a singled out case, 1t becomes a part. The Holocaust was involved from a\ngovernment, with an army, and everything like this here to carry out. Can you imagine,\npeople were denied to go to the front lines, for as long there were good killers of Jews.\nNow, can you have anything to compare a situation like that with? You cannot.",
        "Q: Okay, we\u2019re talking about being in -- in Chicago in the -- in the early 1950\u2019s, and\nyou\u2019re going to school, and -- and working to establish a business, and you have kids.\nHow aware were you, and how interested were you in -- in political situations that were\ngoing on in -- 1n those years, or in broader social and cultural issues, or were you more\nfocused on just trying to build your own life, and your family, or were you kind of aware\nof some of the -- some of the things like the -- were you following the Korean war, and\nthose issues, or -- or the -- the Civil Rights movement as it started up?",
        "A: I was -- became a democrat, I believe right now, before I even was justified to go to\nwalt, you know, but I was a democrat. President Truman left a very big mark on me, his\ninterpretation of political events. I must say, til this day, although, in the interim of the\nyears being in America as an American, and I didn\u2019t miss an election that I didn\u2019t vote,\neven -- even if it wasn\u2019t a regular election, but it was just a matter of a party election,\nwhich it was, I always voted, because I feel, after what I\u2019ve been through, where voting\nwas denied for me, where citizenryship was denied from me, that this 1s a privilege thing\nthat one could never give up, and I never did, and I never failed to vote. And like I said,\nPresident Truman left a big -- that buck stops here, he left a lot of good things on me, and\nthrough the era, every once in awhile it happened, for instance, I voted for President\nReagan over President Carter, because I was very mad at President Carter\u2019s era that he\nwas the president. I personally [indecipherable] he did not deserve to be a president. He\nmade a good peanut farmer. He will never go in through history as a good president. We\nlost a lot of things that we still haven\u2019t straightened out because of his misyudgment. And\nI believe above all, when we are talking about the prisoners, just look what he did at that\ntime, playing into the hands of Khomeini with Iran. We never -- we never fixed that\nrupture since then. But if he would have invoke at that time, our military might, which we\nhad and we could, because when a country invades an embassy of the next country, that\u2019s\na declaration of war, even if it\u2019s not officially said, the word, but that international law is\nan in -- is immediately, it\u2019s a declaration of war. So therefore, he was justified as\npresident to do a much better job than he did. And I believe the loss -- the horn of Africa\nat that time, and inflation that had gone up to 27 and half percent, sure the retired people\nloved him for that, because they didn\u2019t -- some of them didn\u2019t make as much money on\ntheir jobs as these inflationary dollars, they thought brought it to them, because elderly\npeople, of course, don\u2019t spend as much as young people. So when they got 18 and 20\npercent on their bank books, you know, or even the -- even 18 percent, that was big\nmoney for them, and you know what I mean, they want -- but look at, they would have\nonly turned around to see that the 18 percent that they earned, they have to go out in the\nmarketplace, and pay 22 percent for it, if they were to buy. So in the long run, they lost\nfour percent, not that they gained that much. So I mean, there was a lot of good things,\nand therefore when it came Reagan to go for president, I did vote for him. Not for so\nmuch that it was a vote for him, as it was a vote against President Carter. I believe it\u2019s --\ncertain elections, I\u2019d probably cross the line, because I like one candidate, a cert -- over a\ncertain party, better than the other one. So, in generalizing, or -- or finalizing my\nstatement, I would say, when you come to that little room, and you come behind that\ncurtain to vote your opinion, a person should think about a little bit. And I was always\nthinking about who I vote for. And -- and I have been -- I am encouraging other people\nthe same way. So yes, I became immediately an American by going into politics,\nmeaning supporting the political will. I became a democrat, and I\u2019ve been a registered\ndemocrat all the years since we came to the United States. And hopefully, unless I see the\nRepublican party grown up, and understand that all of us are not millionaires, and all of\nus don\u2019t have inheritance in the oil, and in the others, and we still have to go out to make\na living, so if they want our labor force to turn around and become a labor force of\nMexico, I don\u2019t say they\u2019re justified there. But they live in Mexico, and if they can take\nit, with their livelihood that provided, fine. But here in America, as Americans, we\u2019re\nentitled to have a Social Security, we entitled to have our Medicare, and we also entitled\nto all the goods of life, that is given, like all others. So therefore, when today we see that,\nfor instance, the -- the -- the amount a person can earn, I don\u2019t care that people say he\u2019s a\n-- a youngster from school and goes to work for the minimum wage. The minimum wage\nis understandable that no one can remain forever. But at the same time, we must\nunderstand that sometimes 1n life there are people in between jobs, and when they go 1n,\nand they have to earn this measly few dollars, is not right. Again, we cannot make that\nthis industry belongs just to the kids, to school kids, or so on. That would not be\ndemocratic either. And this is why I cannot be a Republican as yet, because the\ndemocrats still, at least show me the belief of life that every American deserves to get,\nand I supported villa myself, all the time.",
        "Q: In the er -- in the 1950\u2019s, you -- you had come just recently out of a Communist\nsystem, and you were critical of it. How did you feel about McCarthyism,\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: I was terribly disgusted with that era, and all, because here, I saw repetition of\nyesteryears under the Communism, not under Hitler, where people were convicted -- in\nminds you can\u2019t, but in open, to convict them before they even were proven guilty. And\nwe know the old saying in the USA, you\u2019re not guilty until proven. And the McCarthy\nera tried to change all of that around, and thanks God for sane heads, that it existed, that\nthat man was removed, but the laws were not changed to favor him. And I hope that\nlesson serves for always. You prove first that a man 1s guilty, before you make him be\nguilty. And this I believe is the law of humanity, this 1s the law -- a law without justice 1s\nnot -- is not a good law. And this is the j -- this is what it would be, a law without justice,\nyou know what I mean, to let McCarthyism exist. So they just -- you gotta obey the law.\nOf course you\u2019ll have to obey the law, but let us make the laws with justice, so therefore\nthey wouldn\u2019t -- the laws wouldn\u2019t become law under this here circumstance.",
        "Q: You were raising -- I\u2019m still thinking about that -- th-that same era, the decade of the\n1950\u2019s, when you\u2019re getting settled in -- in the United States, and -- and I\u2019m wondering\ndid you -- did you and your wife talk a lot about -- about the Holocaust and what had\nhappened, and did you talk with your children about it when they were young?",
        "A: Okay, okay. I must confess again something. We never sit down per se to discuss that\nera with our kids, because our pain 1s -- is tremendous, and we feel like that we are giving\nanguish and pain to our children, would not be a justified way. As a matter of fact, in a\nJewish way, it\u2019s definitely against that you should not imply anguish on someone else,\nbecause that\u2019s a sin to do. So we never did. But my daughter, for instance, she's a\nprincipal in a school, in a Jewish school for the English parts. She\u2019s got two Masters, and\nshe\u2019s now going for her Ph.D. She learned on -- about the Holocaust scholastically. She\ntakes her schoolchildren to the museum, it used to b -- in Washington, D.C., at least twice\na year, for all the years since. She was also, while her husband was starting law in the\nGeorge Washington University in -- in D.C., she was teaching at Bethesda, Maryland,\nand I had very good accolades about her teaching, from the principal at that time. So I\nmust say, she cared to know, and she found out about it. She rehearsed a lot of times, Elie\nWiesel\u2019s poems and stories, and she is involved in things like that. But on one -- one on\none basis, 1f she would ask us sometimes, would be different, we discussed it, but\notherwise, to say let me tell you how this and that happened, unless they ask, we do not\nmake. With our grandchildren, maybe sometimes, but also in the same way. We would\nnot ahead to get in on the subject. Now, the other part I must tell you 1s, it\u2019s a funny thing\nabout the survivors of the Holocaust, we may come to a party, or we may come to a\nhouse as an invitation for dinner, and maybe it\u2019s baseball season, and you talk about\nwho\u2019s going to be in the pennant, or who\u2019s going to be in the World Series, or it could be\nfootball, and the same conversation at this time. But we will not get in maybe 50 percent\nof the time consumed together, without invoking a part of the Holocaust, without\ninvoking a part of that era. Like, for instance, a lot of our friends are partisans, but it is --\nthat they be -- were in the forest, some hidden in the forest, but some of them are also\nformer concentration camp inmates. We do not make the differentiation. But I noticed\nthat be wherever we come, be to a wedding, or to come to the Days of Remembrance,\nthat past era has never died in us, and we don\u2019t want it to die. I must tell you from the\nstandpoint of doctor, I suffer high blood pressure to this day. And I used to have a doctor\nwho was a Holocaust survivor\u2019s son, and whenever I would come to him to test me, and\nhe would put on the blood pressure on me, so before that, he would go, had -- \u201cSo,\nHarold, did you write to the paper lately?\u201d Or this and that and the other. He sort of\nwould provoke me to the something about this here. All of a sudden he takes my blood\npressure, it\u2019s maybe going to be 190 over 90. \u201cHarold, I want you to lie down, don\u2019t talk\nto anybody, rest up, Ill be back.\u2019 Come back about 10 minutes later, now the blood\npressure would go down. And he\u2019d go with me to -- says, \u201cLook, as a doctor, I must tell\nyou my part, it\u2019s no good for you, because look how much working up you do yourself\nby talking on the issue. However, I would not want you to forget.\u201d So, what I\u2019m trying --\nwhat I\u2019m trying to bring out 1s, the majority of us do not want to forget. We feel it\u2019s a sin\nto forget what we been through, all the atrocities, watching ourselves, our loved ones\nbeing murdered, for no other reason but being born Jewish, which it\u2019s a mark that the\nworld should carry, the new mark of Cain, of the biblical days of Cain and Abel, we\nbelieve biblically that God made a sign on his forehead, and that sign we interpret was to\nbe for people always to remember that he was a people killer. I used to convert this here\ntime through my being in America, before the Holocaust Museum was established, and\nwhile the Holocaust Museum was established, I\u2019d be asking you to give me the time a\nlittle bit more, and I will dwell on it, to make it. Because my analogy was also that the\nmuseums that they were built to -- literally to display all the past what had happened\nduring the Holocaust, is a place of learning for the new people to see about it, that it must\nbe there, because that\u2019s the mark of Cain, that must be to remind those people and tell\nthem, look what it happens at an era where people remain quiet. Where people refused to\ndisagree with bad laws. Where people refused to disagree with bad leaders. That\u2019s the\nera, what you see it happened here. So the museum era, I always make reminission to that\n-- to the mark of Cain, of the same story. I had big fights, on paper. Without being\nprepared to tell you, I cannot tell you the date, but approximately, the date goes back\nabout the number of years, not too many years, where on the newspaper in New York, it\nwas written -- and that was the era of the building of the Holocaust Museum, that there\nwere a group of Jews who were against it, especially the religious part. That rabbi, I don\u2019t\nknow should I mention his name, or not mention his name, I hear him at the same times,\none Sunday on the radio, where he comes out because he was the one of the creators of\nOutreach program, which it means to bring Jewish kids back. But Pll -- Iam not going to\nsay anything other than the facts. His name is Mr. Buchwalt, Ephraim Buchwalt, and he\nand me had for a year\u2019s time, a correspondence, after the article that it appeared in the\nnewspaper in New York, saying the Holocaust is killing the American Jews. Which it\nwas a tremendu -- a tremendous shameful headline to be seen for me, a Holocaust\nsurvivor. I have spoken to Miles Lehrman when he came here to this part, 1n our\nsynagogue, pleading to help about building the -- the museum. I believe every city in the\nworld should have -- not as big, but a little part dedicated to the Holocaust, by way of\nmuseum. That the people should know, and a -- serve as a reminder, every day, what\ncomplacency does to a people. Not to reveal all the rest of the slogans what it is, but\ncomplacency\u2019s what it causes. Fascism, Hitlerism, Nazism, under any schism that you\nwant, complacency happens to do all the bad things, be that it happens in our nearby\ncountries, be that in Haiti for instance, or other countries, where the people are depressed,\nonly because there is a mond of people over there, complacent to what their own has\ndone. So, I carried out a correspondence with this person, and I tried to explain it to him.\nHis article was saying that if this money -- he accused the museum being guilty, or be the\nbuilding, for Jewish pi -- intermarriages, because after all, I gotta take the other side, a\nCatholic child, who is married out of his faith to a Jewish child, the other family feels just\nas broken as this one. So I don\u2019t want to be a one-sided with my analogy what I\u2019m\nmaking over here, but so my answer to him about all the accusations over why this\nmoney should not be spent there, but should be spent on education, was as follows. I said,\nthose people who donated for the building of the museum, were anxious to see the\nmuseum built, for that reason, the mark of Cain. However, if you guys feel like you need\na campaign to raise -- to build more schools, then why don\u2019t you do it? Why do you use\nyour neglect, what you didn\u2019t do yourself, to try to deny a historical event that it must\nexist? I fought with him, one rabbi, for a year. I fought in Chicago with a head man who\nis the publisher of a paper called the Chicago Jewish news, where he came up again,\nwhich it was almost like he read an article, and it came at Yom HaShoah, Remembrance\nDay of the Holocaust, he came out athird of the articles, caught me at a time when I was\nin Chicago, and we were the B\u2019nai Brith, and I was brought -- people know that I write to\nthe papers, people know that I\u2019m vocal, and at the same time, that I will take my time to\nwrite. And I was sended the paper, \u201cHarold, did you see that, he was inter -- to -- they\ninterviewed from the Sun-Times, by this, that, and the other, read it.\u201d I start reading the\nfirst paragraph, I says, \u201cLook, it\u2019s a repetition what I had to do with Rabbi Buchwalt, in --\nwith New York, a few years ago. This man probably got the lesson from him, and he\nmentions in a different form,\u201d after all, thanks God, the American language 1s a very rich\nlanguage with teasers, and so many words that you can use more -- more than one way,\nbut the meaning remains still the same. And I again had to learn -- give him a lesson. Of\ncourse, I saw it Saturday night, and on Monday morning, Harold Zissman, with Sonia his\nwife, were right there, at the office of the printing of that paper, with askening the\nquestions, how dare 1s he to write these kind of words, and so on. Nobody\u2019s asking you to\n-- to donate to that. Nobody\u2019s asking you to come and visit if you don\u2019t want to. So if you\ncannot help anything, don\u2019t knock it at least. And if you knock it, have reasons,\njustifiable, why your side is right. And I had to enter with him with a dialog first, which\nof course the answer was he\u2019s out of town, you can\u2019t see him, Mr. Zissman. I says,\n\u201cOkay, Pll leave my message to him. I\u2019m going to leave tomorrow for Chicago, and I'll\nmail you an article which I hope you print, because I\u2019Il assure you -- I -- I\u2019m preparing\nyou, if you looking for demonstrations, you\u2019re going to have them. Because I, as a\nsurvivor, who fought in the underground, will not live to see the day that Jews will write\nthese kind of things against museums, and against [indecipherable]. If they are bad -- th --\nmasters of their own destiny, how to raise money to build more schools or better schools,\ndon\u2019t blame on somebody else, who did their work diligently, it\u2019s a -- must be done.\u201d\nWell, he printed my article in the paper, no question about it. I had another dialog with\nhim, and another, afterwards there. What I\u2019m trying to say to you, just like the Holocaust\nis not yet understood well, while we are still living, so is the building to prevent the\nfuture from happening definitely still. A lot of people come -- you know what we had\nwith this Holocaust in -- and I was -- I must tell you, although I know him in person, I\nwrote to him, I\u2019m very happy that Miles Lehrman is dismissed. And I hope he doesn\u2019t go\nagainst me with any publications, or anything like that. That man did -- and I wrote to\nhim publicly -- of course, Mr. Birnbaum, he came at that time, to respond to me, which I\nhave it, the letter. Now, another letters, I have a file with letters. And let me explain\nmyself, he did not respond with my question it was, that he had no business mingling in\nwith the Polish government, because he is only the head of this museum, he is not a re --\nhe is not in Madeline\u2019s Albright\u2019s position, he\u2019s not -- you know I mean, the Secretary of\nState, to speak to a foreign about the [indecipherable] 1n Auschwitz, and so on, which it\nwas over there. And the dealings what he started to do. But, it turned up the museum\nalmost to be a political issue, which definitely -- be the Arafat issue, with all of these here\ncases, we must not forget ourselves, as I say, it\u2019s a mark of Abel, it\u2019s a mark of learning,\nbut we cannot let by all means, politicize either the memory, or the place like museums,\nfor any personal use, or personal understanding. Anybody wishes to come to see this\nmuseum is welcome. But to make a dignitary issue, like to make this here because he 1s\n[indecipherable]. I don\u2019t care if the pope would come, and he wants to see Yad Vashem.\nIf he will be there, I assure you, he\u2019s going to be greeted as a pope, yes, but no\npoliticizing issues will ever grow out of that. And the same thing goes for anybody else,\nwhether they are Moslem, whether they are Catholic, or Buddhist, or whatever it is.\nCome and see, what it happened in an era, when people became silent to murder for no\nreason, and no cause, only because by being burn -- born on the wrong side of the street.\nAnd this will be an outspoken thing for me to say when anybody du -- even while it\u2019s a\ngood thing the ma -- the m -- the museum exists. It\u2019s a bad thing of a Mr. Rioch, or any of\nthe other people, over this person. He\u2019s not educated well enough to lead that part -- that\nhe is. But he was a good person politically, to raise money for the party, and so on. And\nthat\u2019s what he got there. I hope, since you\u2019re a young lady, and involved in that, that we\nsee for the future that no politics should ever come between the museum -- the Holocaust\nMuseum, the memorial of these here six million, or if you want to speak for 25 million\nthat were there, to ever let politics take over, and make this a showplace that people\nshould come to politicize. I, as long I can, will always write about it, to whoever the\nparties are, be it Miles Lehrman, be it Rabbi Weiss giving the accolades about it. And I\njust wrote, it\u2019s still not published in the Jewish journal, I wrote to ak -- of course, to give\nhim a kudos for what he tirelessly continued with his campaign, because he exposed all\nthese issues, with a lot of us didn\u2019t know what it was going on. Because you gotta have\nan access, you know what I mean, way to get into that. But in a general term, I must tell\nyou, I was always, and will always be vocal for the rights -- be -- whichever it -- way it\nis. It could be my own brother if -- I wish he would be alive, 1f he would do something\nwrong, I would be vocal about it to say, \u201cYou\u2019re wrong, my brother, you should not have\ndone it, or you di -- shouldn\u2019t have done it that way.\u201d",
        "Q: How is it that you\u2019re finding out all th -- did you just say that it was your rabbi who\nwas giving you all the information about what\u2019s going on?",
        "A: No, Rabbi Weiss writes -- and he 1s in Riverdale if you know, and he carries on -- he\u2019s\nthe head of an organization called Zampa, which it means a folks organization of the\npeople. And he often -- again, I like him, because he was outspoken, all the time. I like\nhim because he went to Auschwitz, although he was accused that he tried to beat the\nnuns, which it was a pure lie. But you see, people like him, like myself, who are not\nafraid to expose your name, or to go to speak out what you really mean, but in the right\nway. That\u2019s the very important thing. I could be right, but I must express it in the right,\nand the proper way, and the same way. He didn\u2019t try to knock anybody down, but he was\nspeaking out for the right. And the rights of those people murdered, laying there, have a\nright at least -- I don\u2019t say it\u2019s gotta be the Magen David, or anything, but they have -- or\nthe eternal light, but have a right not to be converted now, y -- after death, posthumously.\nThere was some Jews who converted, okay, so that\u2019s their business. There are Jews who\nbelieve in Jesus, that\u2019s their business. But let\u2019s not go ahead to make a political issue out\nof an era, as such. We must remember that, and we must fight for it, to see not to let\nothers do. That\u2019s -- that\u2019s always my statement.",
        "Q: Okay, Mr. Zissman is now going to read one of his poems.",
        "A: This poem is headlined, \u201cMy Prayer in Plight of a Dream. The distant forest, with the\nthick bush, swamp, and quicksand, birds chirping, humming to no end, under tall trees\nand trails. Nature\u2019s way to preserve and protect, as everyone\u2019s land. The woodpecker,\nwith his loud noise, building his nest prevails. The crow, with loud, crying flight, as if\ndangerous on the way, to signal the others about the plight in their midst. The robin -- the\nrobins, and b -- and hummingbirds, are all astound to what may, busy with their catch, to\nquench hunger, in view of the beast. A kingdom of their own, all around. How safe could\nit be for me? The fenced ghetto must not be in the way. I must escape now to the forest,\nwith big trees, and bush, birds, beast, insects, danger. Leave family and ghetto behind, a\nplace to fight and hide. Time 1s short, I must decide, the forest is the place to escape. Dear\nGod, grant me those wings of a bird, to fly and be safe, so I could fly from trunk to twig,\nfrom twig to branch. To the forest, to join the fight, not hide, to escape the murder. Oh\nGod, grace me with those wings so I may survive, and be free. Grant me life, to remain\nyour servant, to reveal your grace always. I must be a witness to tell how hell came down\nto earth, to destroy the people of the book. Who\u2019Il be your new children? Must we all\nvanish? We are your children, can\u2019t you grant us life? Why all that murder? No prayer,\nno cry, no plea. Must we all die? Where are you people? Are you going to remain silent\nto murder? I shall fight to survive, tell our sorrow, ask where was man and God?\u201d See, I\nnever speak just to God alone when I\u2019m asking about people coming to tell me, didn\u2019t\nthat bother you to ask the question where was God? And I, my answer has always been\nthe unique answer to say. I don\u2019t know where God is, but I do know where man is, and I\nsee man. So my question was always be, where were man, and then I ask where was God.\nBecause man were visible, and seen. So I cannot unleash my sorrow, and datday to God. I\nstill remain [indecipherable] to man, and his life. To people, and not just to God. So\ntherefore, it could never be misunderstood by my way, the way I see all what had\nhappened, all the sorrow stories to tell, and all the innocent people who were murdered\njust for being born Jewish.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number four, of an interview with Harold Zissman. When you moved to\nthe Chicago area, did you move to Skokie right away?",
        "A: No, I -- at first, we were living like a mansion to you, 1n a basement apartment where\nwe came. Then, when my son was born, and my brother-in-law with us, in 1949, we\ncould no longer live in that apartment, and I had to pay under the table, because\napartments were not available, and it was illegal to charge any higher rent. So that was\nthe means by which way one could get an apartment, is to pay under the table. It was sort\nof like a -- a guy gave that as a donation. That\u2019s what I was asked to say, and to write on\nmy check, that that was a donation, upon this donor, to be given to his famous charity,\nwhatever, he -- he dedicated it to. We moved on Edison Street, which it was more known,\nas about 10 blocks away from Kapp\u2019s park, that we were living there, and there we got on\nthe third floor, a four room apartment, which it was huge by comparison of living in two\nf-- rooms in a b -- in two rooms in a basement apartment. And no air conditioning, of\ncourse, for -- and we had two children. My brother-in-law, at that particular time was no\nlonger with us, because he was drafted to the army. He came to the States late in 48, and\nin \u00b049 with th -- with that outbroke -- break in Korea, he was drafted in the American\narmy, and he, believe it or not, was sent back to Germany, in the same places where he\nwore a -- a -- aS a camp inmate -- I\u2019m meaning as a DP camp inmate, there he was\nserving with the amer -- with the US uniform, as a soldier. Now, when he came back, and\nwe were living still in these four rooms, all of a sudden the four rooms became too small\nfor all of us. So we had to go ahead and try to get another apartment, and times were\nterrible at that time to get another apartment. Each time I looked an apartment with three\nbedrooms, they asked us the question, which it was an infamous item to be asked to\nHolocaust survivors, do you have any kids? That was a painstaking answer. I says, \u201cWhy\nwould I want a six room ap-apartment if I wouldn\u2019t have any kids?\u201d \u201cWell, but we don\u2019t\nwant to rent to little kids that you have with it.\u201d And that I kept on and on til -- I was\nvigorous enough at that time to go ahead and de-decide to buy on my own. I wasn\u2019t ready\nfor a home, so we bought a three flat building, at that particular time, which it was in\nWest Roger\u2019s Park in Chicago, one of the very upcoming, beautiful neighborhoods. And\nwe lived there til our ch -- til my daughter was of the age to go to high school. And at that\nparticular time the run was for Skokie. And in Skokie the high schools were very good,\nand they were upgraded. So my daughter decided that she\u2019d rather go to the high school\nin Skokie, and my son and my daughter both graduated from Skokie High School. And\nwhile in Skokie -- Niles East was the name of the schools. And while in Skokie again, I --\nI became organized in the Jewish community, and I maintained at that time, my\nmembership with the B\u2019nai Brith, and it was the B\u2019nai Brith who really dealt me a bad\ncard at the time, when this -- when the Nazis decided that they want to move in Skokie,\nand being the advice that we got from the B\u2019nai Brith, was very counter to the belief aw -\n- for me as a Survivor, and everybody else. Their advice to us was, \u201cLet them march and\ndo their talking, draw your curtains and don\u2019t mind anything at all. And if they won\u2019t get\nany -- any people to come listening to them, they probable decide not to come.\u201d Our\nadvice was not to listen to these kind of ways, because basically they were not exercising\nFreedom of Speech. They were exercising their hate for one thing, and the threat of our\nlives for the second. Well, we just got freed from all those things, that we had to go\nthrough over again. I already mentioned, I believe, in the former tape, didn\u2019t I? Did I\nmention about the [indecipherable] justice department, I already said it to you on that --\non the tape over here, right?",
        "Q: You mentioned -- you mentioned the -- a little bit about Skokie, and you mentioned\ngetting onto the Phil Donohue show, and you mentioned going to testify.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But -- but tell me a little bit more about the background of it. Were you -- were you\ninvolved with survivor\u2019s groups in Skokie?",
        "A: Okay, PII tell it now. While I belonged, as I said, to the B\u2019nai Brith, in Skokie was the\nfirst chapter we organized to commemorated the name of Janoush Korchuk. Janoush\nKorchuk really was an assimilated Jew, but he was Jewish at heart, and at that particular\ntime, he was living outside of the ghetto, but he moved into the ghetto, and he opened up\norphanage houses, which I believe 1-is -- he\u2019s well documented, even through the United\nNations, and when that Janoush Korchuk, who was a healer, a doctor of philosophy and\neverything, the way he composed those children , who were already orphaned, and he\nwas with them. The day came when they wanted to eliminate the children in the ghetto,\nand it was called upon him to surrender the children from his -- from his home, to the\nNazis. He refused, he says, \u201cWherever my children go, I\u2019m going to go with them.\u201d So\nwhich it means they wanted to grant him life, but he decided rather to face death in the\nsame manner his children. And his way was, \u201cIf I cannot survi -- if my children cannot\nsurvive, there was no use for me to survive.\u201d So that\u2019s a story of importance for everyone\nto remember, and I believe in the realm of B\u2019nai Brith, and Anti-Defamation League, we\nfound the survivors who were living in Skokie, and who were members of B\u2019nai Brith to\nopen up another lodge, and that lodge was named under Janoush Korchuk, which at many\ntimes, on other occasions, I spoke, even on the Days of Remembrance, when I had the\nopportunity to be the spokesman, I mentioned Janoush Korchuk, and his brave actions,\nwhat he did by trying to save the kids, even in the bad days, as it were, to keep them at\nleast human, until the end. And he did not refuse a bit about it. From there on, as I say,\nliving in Skokie and -- and belonging now to this here B\u2019nai Brith lodge, so when the era\ncame about the Nazis wanting to march in Skokie, and threatening our lives, I became\nvery vocal about it. First of all, what I did, it was at city hall on that Monday, which it\nwas a normal meeting, I talked to some guys and told them that we all should gather at\nthe Skokie city hall, and tell them our grievances over why we do not agree to see that the\nNazis come to Skokie. I was the first of the group to be called to speak, and I voiced my\nopinion against it, why we do not have to see and repeat our sufferings to accommodate\nanother group in our society. They could make their venture any time, anyways, I cannot\nstop them from speaking. But why should we allow them to come in our homes, and\ndisobey the law, to go ahead to spill their hate and venom on all of us, against our lives,\nsince we already went through all of that, and became survivors. Must we go through the\nagony again, just to satisfy a segment of people? Why couldn\u2019t they speak on television,\nradio, wherever they want to, but not come and threaten us in our homes, and\nplaygrounds, wherever we live, and raise new children? Words got around, and we got a\nbig crowd at night for the meeting. I was asked a question, from the city hall\ncommissioners, and I was asked, what if we grant them the permit, that -- the meeting\nwas basically to determine whether the city hall will grant a permit to the Nazis to come\nto Skokie. And I was asked what will I do at the time, if the Nazis get the permit, and\nthey come to Skokie. And I politely answered the commissioner at that particular time, I\nsays, \u201cI cannot tell you now what I would do at time of anger. You know, when a person\ngets angry, and an anger of that type, I don\u2019t know, will I grab a stone, will I grab a\nbottle, whatever I will do to throw and disrupt probably, all of that.\u201d He says, \u201cWell, you\nknow, it\u2019s against the law to do it.\u201d I says, \u201cIt\u2019s -- in my ways of life, it\u2019s against the law\nfor me to re-live the agony one more time, Commissioner. So I hope you, as the\nlawmaker and obeyer, can see that we survivors here, and for that matter, anybody we --\nwho is not a survivors, have to go through the agony of being threatened with their lives,\nby these group of mugs, and people, who call themselves the neo-Nazis.\u201d Well, needless\nto say that they did pass the law, the attorneys advised them that it must be -- go ahead\nand granting in the law, with the rights of the Second Amendment of Free Speech. Well,\nnow we had to get re-organized again, we opened up our office, and began to get ads in\nthe paper. Skokie became so public that we -- people from Africa, people from Australia,\nwherever [indecipherable] everybody was granting us the courage for we doing it, and\ngave us the moral support, and even offered financial support, whatever it may take. We\nmastered to come out on the Phil Donohue show, at that particular time, in public. And it\nwas a -- from the Civil Liberties Union, a man, Goldberger, which he was Jewish, who\nwas the one defending them. My question to him was, does his heart allow him -- and his\nconscience, to go, to protect this bloody era of Jewish annihilation? Of course, Phil\nDonohue didn\u2019t let me get close. He didn\u2019t let me. But I, with my persistency, did not s-\nsuccumb to him not letting, and out of place, I yelled long enough til he had to come with\nthe microphone to me, to be heard. My daughter, at that particular time, was living in\nFlorida already, and she called me afterwards, \u201cOh, Daddy, I saw you -- I saw you on\ntelevision. You\u2019re still fighting, looks like to me.\u201d That was her words to me. I says,\n\u201cYes, my dear, my fight did not end, obviously. I didn\u2019t think that I'll have to fight, but I\nmust rise up again and fight again. That menace has got to get done with.\u201d That was my\nanswer to her. Our fight, as I say went on; meeting -- meetings used to take place at\ntimes, evenings to last til one o\u2019clock in the morning. And we had various plans of how\nto start. There was even at one time a plan that we actually wanted to attack their base,\nwhat they had on the south side of Chicago. But after big pleas by attorneys, who were in\ntouch with us, from the establishment of Jewish organizations, and the B\u2019nai Brith kept\nappealing the same thing, draw your curtains and don\u2019t come. That\u2019s the best that they\ncould offer for us, which by all means, I had to tell some B\u2019nai Brith people, \u201cNow I see\nwhy you did not act out against the situation when we were being murdered.\u201d I says,\n\u201cBecause that\u2019s your only solution, draw your curtains, and don\u2019t look. And then the\nsame thing goes, put something in your ears, and you don\u2019t listen, or you don\u2019t hear. We\ncannot succumb to that menace,\u201d I said. And we organize groups all the time, and see\nwhat the plide could do. The Jewish establishment in Chicago, with the lawyers who\nvolunteered to our help, suggested that we are to see 1 -- 1 -- Springfield, Illinois, the state\ncapital, and we must inaugurate another law, that since freedom of speech must be given\nto them -- we tried to fight, that yes they can come, even to Skokie and speak, but they\ncannot wear these Nazi uniforms. We made an appearance there, and my appearance\nunwillingly, was very successful, because I really brought out the call of freedom, I really\nbrought up today meet was exactly on D-Day, where all my compatriots, who were\nspeakers, and former soldiers, and fighters and commanders, did not have the audacity to\nremember the day it was. I, however, the pain was too fresh on me to forget D-Day,\nbecause D-Day meant a big time for us at that particular time to see that. An-And things\nlike that, you just don\u2019t forget, or mete out of the calendar. And I was, after all, became\nrenown -- known. We had a lot of gatherings going on, and at one time, we wanted to\nstate our case, so in the JCC, we were divided in three speakers. We had a speaker from\nthe Holocaust survivors who was an inmate in the concentration camp. I was the one who\nrepresented the partisans, and resistance, and there was --",
        "Q: Say names if you can remember names.",
        "A: Well, Rosensweig was one of the speakers, which he was -- his wife was later\npresident, who she was representing those Jews who were in -- in -- in Russia. Our\npresident\u2019s -- I must say, our late president, at that time, which she was a woman, and she\nwas very vocal about the issues, she was very much in-involved. Her name is Erna\nGense, and she was talking in regard, or rather, representing the inmates of the\nconcentration camp. I, Harold Zissman, was taking part, speaking about resistance in the\npartisans. And we were very successful, the room was filled with people, and questions,\nwhile we only were thinking it\u2019ll be an hour to two hours, it was after three hours that we\nhad to call a halt to the meeting, and call it for continuance of every day. Another thing\nwe organized about, that was all to lightening the situation of [indecipherable]. I had,\nafter that, one student that he was studying in medical school, but he was a Jewish boy,\ninterested in Jewish history, that he asked me if he could come to my house, and I will\ngive him on tape all my story, why and what, when -- no more than we discussed it. He\ncame to my house, and made a few tapes, and afterwards he says, \u201cHarold, I don\u2019t know\nhow you survived, but I cannot listen to it.\u201d He says, \u201cIt was too much.\u201d I says, \u201cThat\u2019s\nthe part of perseverance, and that\u2019s the part of endurance. If you want to go on to live,\nyou cannot surrender easily. You must keep your fight to the bitter end, just like I\ndescribed in some of my poems, as it was.\u201d Anyways, the other organization what we\ndid, we decided on the Sabbath to send various groups to go to synagogues, bring out our\nsituation on the pulpit, over why our dissatisfaction 1s with the Nazis do -- who want to\nmarch. We are trappened, and all of us are trappened. We know that we don\u2019t want to\nhave any -- any bad situation, maybe turning into riots, or whatever it is, where it could\nthreaten the business community. So therefore, for all things concerned, the best thing 1s,\nby which ever way we can derive, that it should be legal and official to stop that march\nfrom coming, because at that particular time, the Jewish Defense League, which it was\nvery famous in New York, joined us, and they wanted to become a party with us, to join\nin the fight against the Nazis. So, when the joish -- the -- the Jewish League came to us,\nthe joining, 1t was a more scare on the merchants in the area, because now they knew\nwith the Jewish Defense League around, that definitely hostilities will ic -- incur in the\nneighborhood. So, we ask what can we do about 1t? Anyways, by that time, the law\npassed in -- in -- in Springfield, and 1t was passed, but it was afterwards challenged, that\nit was illegal that this, in itself, the uniform in itself was declared also part of speech, and\nwe cannot stop it. Well, be that 1t was right, be that it was wrong, maybe the legal heads\nthat we had trying to help us were not the greatest, and the best, but it\u2019s a known factor\nthat American people, including the Jews, do not ever want to see a change in the Second\nAmendment of Free Speech. I perhaps feel the same way, but it\u2019s too hard for me to\nsuccumb to the idea that Free Speech, and threatening of life should be one and the same,\nand therefore granted immunity for that reason. That\u2019s why, until this day outspoken, that\nit was justified for us to stop them. However, be for what it\u2019s worth, that it did occur in\nChicago later, that we were denied our law, and they came out to speak, but we started\nthe same thing, as I said, we were throwing rocks, and eggs, and whatever you wanted,\nand the only thing it lasted for about three -- two minutes, or four, and they were -- had to\nbe run out. The fact remains that later on we found out that those neo-Nazis were\ninvolved in so many lawbreaking things that they did. We found out the head of a Mr.\nCollins, that he was involved with -- with sexual things, involved -- and he was brought\nto court -- o -- justice, and he was jailed later. Which it proves, no more, and no less like\nHitler and his gang, they were all not law abiders, but law breakers, but we granted the\nfreedom. And of course, I was -- 1t was interpreted to us to tell this 1s the democracy in\naction, that a -- that we must be listening to everybody who wants to speak. Yes,\nlistening to whatever we want to speak. But listening to someone who threatens my life,\none day I hope, will be separated from Freedom of Speech, because it\u2019s the same as\nyelling fire in a crowded movie house, which this is not Freedom of Speech. And we\ncontinued our fight later, while I already aforementioned being in the -- speaking for the\njustice committee, and as I said, the law passed, and we again had a fight on our hands.\nNo matter what itch we tried -- we stopped it. It was the fact to show what had happened.\nWe were stopping that we shouldn\u2019t any more tal -- go to let them demonstrate, so the\ncity hall, and it\u2019s legal people advised, and devised an issue [indecipherable] prohibited,\nthose people living in the neighborhood mind you, were prohibited to go out in that area\nwhere the Nazis, if it comes to pass that they will come to speak, so 1t means we were\ntaken the laws of freedom away from us, that we could not go walk in that perimeter,\nwhile they, under the protection of the law, will be guided to let them come in and\nspeech. Well, that\u2019s a good lesson to prove what Freedom of Speech means. I agree with\nit, but I don\u2019t agree at the cost of another part of the public, to be denied the laws. I\nbelieve something over there was not -- acting wrong. And we -- we mustered a lot, and\nsince the Civil Liberties Union were protecting the Nazi so much, we decided we must hit\nthem where it hurts, in their pockets. Our campaign continued, and we broke them\nactually, that they did not have enough contributions, and you know, the legal people are\nvery -- trying to legal, but they wanted money for their time, and looks like they had to\nabandon the whole thing. That\u2019s why, in sko -- in Skokie, they couldn\u2019t muster up and\ncome to march. But in Chicago, around city hall, even if it only lasted for two minutes,\nand the amount of money that it cost the city to allow that to happen, between the police,\nextra time, and extra vigilance that it -- they needed, was ext -- was a tremendous\namount. I\u2019m glad to hear that it never happened, another case like that, over there. In\nFlorida a few times, there were also marches by the neo-Nazis, but they were done in a\ndifferent way. They didn\u2019t go to the height of Collings, and his gang. There were\ndifferent ways with them. And it was on one side the Nazis, and on the other side was the\nanti-Nazis, us. And we protested in loud ways, not to let them be heard, over hel -- and\nthen it was all over. So, the means to say 1s, it happened, but never did it reveal itself to\nbe a case like in Skokie, because over there was the hard core of survivors, and that\u2019s\nwhat they wanted, and they almost -- almost won the battle to come and speak, but we\nprohibited them.",
        "Q: Tell -- tell me, did you -- was there, to your perception, complete unity among\nsurvivors in -- in the Skokie case, or was there any dissension between survivors at all,\nabout what ought to happen?",
        "A: It\u2019s a good question you made, and I\u2019m glad that you asked it in a way, because the\nmovie of Skokie did not bring it out. There was no deception, but before long, it was so\npoliticized, the issue, that it was unbelievable. I had over there, amongst us, as I\nmentioned before, the Jewish Defense League. Before long, it took a lon -- I took a look,\nsome Communists were also trying to join us, and by all means, we did not want to have\na part of no red flag, no this here. So this was the bad part, in part, dissension, no, but\njoiners, of various opinions, which definitely was not in our way, we found to -- to -- to\nbe the case.",
        "Q: And you mentioned a little earlier, Rabbi Montrose?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Were you a member of his congregation?",
        "A: Well, I was a part member of his congregation, because I belonged to another\ncongregation. I always belonged someplace. As a matter of fact, our B\u2019nai Brith\nmeetings, still to this day today, take place on Main Street, in se -- in Skokie central, as\nwe call it, where Rabbi Montrose, still, God willing, presides as the rabbi. The rabbi was\na very vocal helper now, of course, and as I forementioned, we went to synagogues, too,\nand the -- Skokie\u2019s central synagogue was all with the help we needed to be granted.",
        "Q: Did -- did you -- you mentioned feeling angry with the B\u2019nai Brith, because of their\nposition in the -- in the case. Did you -- how did you -- how did that resolve itself? I\nmean, you s -- you just mentioned you -- you continued to be involved with B\u2019nai Brith.",
        "A: They had a letter cam -- writing campaign to B\u2019nai Brith, and our words was, if you\ncannot help us, don\u2019t hurt us. In other words, it\u2019s too bad that you interpret it one way,\nand we see it the other way. To us it\u2019s Freedom of Speech, yes, but however, threatening\nour life is no freedom. So I believe B\u2019nai Brith does -- wouldn\u2019t like to see that way,\neither. And we asked them, just stay neutral and leave us -- leave us alone, because you\nadvised us not -- make us comfort. You make comfort to the enemy instead of making us\ncomfortable about it. And I didn\u2019t resign from being a member of B\u2019nai Brith, because\none bad issue does not make you to turn against Anti-Defamation League, because that\u2019s\nwhat we was trying to claim it. We are being a -- defamed over there, and you -- you\npermission, what you are saying, is let defamation take place, while you trying to say\ndraw your curtains. You know what I mean, or sort of shut your ears, you don\u2019t hear. But\nthat is not the way to handle a situation like that. And thanks God that later on, B\u2019nai\nBrith, I believe, is becoming more mature about some of these situations, and they realize\nthat it was not the right thing to answer to us, just draw your curtain, because as a whole,\nB\u2019nai Brith did lose some members also, in the same way. I didn\u2019t -- you know, our lodge\nstill remained very viable, and everything like that, but you know, a lot of other people\ndid not want to just register the mildness to the resolution, as we did, and they just\nabsolutely resigned, and it was hard to bring them back in there.",
        "Q: Did you feel disillusioned with the American judicial system after the whole case, and\nafter -- after 1t was decided that yes, the -- the First Amendment was going to be upheld\nin the form that it had been?",
        "A: As I said, I\u2019m all for the First Amendment. Ill go to fight, if I have to, to survive -- for\nthe First Amendment to survive. However, we must literally understand, that threatening\nof life is not a First Amendment right to be treated under Freedom of Speech. We must\nmodernize it, if needed, we must amend things in it, but that cannot -- should not be. We\ndon\u2019t know when, tomorrow, when another branch of these hating groups will come up.\nWe know what it happened in Memphis, we know what it happened with all. But the\nJews were on the side to help the Black people, and can you imagine that anybody\u2019s\ngoing to tell me that it was a matter of Free Speech? No, it was not a matter of Free\nSpeech, it was a matter plain, they wanted to kill, they wanted to destroy, and killing and\ndestruction happened. We know just recently, only a year ago, what it happened in\nChicago, with the things that it happened against synagogues. We know the things that it\nhappened there in schools. You see, this is all the outgrowth for people who harbor\nthemselves under the First Amendment right to speak, with right to hate, okay we -- we a\n-- | know the ADL was very helpful in these cases, to pass laws against hate -- law. But\nit\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s a different situation between hated laws, and that causes them to be violent, or\nto come and trap them, openly. Neo-Nazis do not come others -- under any other\nauspices, but threatening the life of the Jews wherever they are. And we must learn how\nto separate, so yes, I am pro-Second -- th-the Amendment, the way it was written,\nFreedom of Speech, but as I said it, and I cannot reveal it again, how many times I say,\nthat threatening of life, must be put -- it will take an extra amendment to it, just like the\nhate law was passed, it must pass this part of the hate law, whatever it is, that people\u2019s\nlives cannot be threatened by any group, by any ways.",
        "Q: Tell me about how that whole event in Skokie, a-and the legal proceedings which took\ns -- took -- took about a year, I think to -- to unfold.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How did that affect your perception of yourself as an American citizen, and -- and the\nAmerican -- did you -- did you feel connected with -- with the country at large, in -- ina\nsense of -- or did you feel a little more isolated afterwards? [indecipherable |",
        "A: No, to the contrary, I felt very much American at the time. I know in the Civil War,\nwe just didn\u2019t throw slogans, and won. It took blood almost, and fighting. Thanks God\nthat we did not have to shed any blood in order to do things like that. So no, never will I\nbe isolated from the American freedom of law. However, in all my life that God gives me\nto live, I will fight for freedom with justice. I cannot afford to let my mind or soul\nseparated one from the other. There is no freedom if there is no justice. So be that justice\nmeans that it was not for -- not letting Jews, or Blacks move into a certain neighborhood,\nor be sitting in the back of a bus. Be to the same thing is, when I am denied certain laws,\nwhatever it has to be, that 1s not justice in these laws. So I hope that we remember the\nimportance. Freedom must be with justice. Freedom without justice is not total freedom.",

        "Q: -- and -- and -- and important for many survivors, as well as just for -- for history of --\nof reckoning with the Holocaust, and that was the Eichmann trial. And I wondered if you\ncan recall whether you -- you watched that carefully, whether you talked about that with\nother people, and whether you felt that that was -- that that was an important event.",
        "A: Okay, I -- first of all, let me touch, before I go to this here, I must put it in, I want to\nthank the people, Mr. -- Mr. Garber, what his name was, the producer of Skokie. Burger,\nMr. Burger was his name of the producer, for producing that movie. I believe, as time\ngoes on, it will remain a vocal part of the history of Skokie. The mayor of Skokie, we\ntook at that time to Israel on a trip, he\u2019s no longer around -- the former mayor that it was\nat the time. But it was a historical event, and I\u2019m gla -- happy and glad, that someone\ntook the time and efforts, even the financial cost, to bring it into light. At the same time, I\nwant at this time, to thank all the other people, 1-including those who pro -- made the\nmovie of \u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\u201d including -- I forgot his name.",
        "Q: Spielberg?",
        "A: Yeah. Including Mr. Spielberg, who gave so much efforts, and money of his cost, to\nbring these programs, even -- even part what he is paying for in the Holocaust museums,\nto bring the story of the survivors of the Holocaust, for posterity, so some students of\ntomorrow can learn what it was done wrong in our time, and in our era, so it shall not\nrepeat itself again. When the Eichmann story, which you asked me, took place, I was\nvery carefully watching it on the TV. And it proved that the bitter end, that instead of him\nasking forgiveness for the injustice that he carried out, much more than the law of\nNuremberg asked him to do, he stand fast to protect the Nazi era, and he\u2019 ll, to the last\nday, and to the last moment of that trial, stood with his opinion that it was right to do\nwhat he does. Which it proves it to you, the freedom, and the democracy, given to a\nmurderer like this here, was given by the state of Israel. And, at the same time, of other\npeople, we know the case what it happened, it proved the case in point, after the case of\nEichmann, then the case of Demjanjuk was brought to Israel. And Israel believed in the\nfairness of the law in judicial way. Even though he was proving that in Trawniki, he was\nserving, in spite that he was not even th-the -- even grossly -- even th-the hater, but he\nwas there in the schools. So seeing as they did not have the total accuracy missing to the\njustice of the Israeli court, to condemn him, or to sue him for whatever it is, they much\nrather for letting him go free instead of condemning perhaps, in the mind of the -- of the\njudges to condemn a s -- a person who was not guilty in the case. Now, here is a big\nimportance for Israel law to be predominant, and all the world to take, that they believe in\nthe old saying -- in the Communist era, as well as the Fascist era through the Nazis,\nthey\u2019d rather kill a hundred people to find one guilty, while this way, when laws arvee\njustice, you\u2019d rather let a hundred people free, instead of condemning one people -- one\nperson who is not fully guilty. That it couldn\u2019t prove the guilt on him. I am proud to hear\nthese things.",
        "Q: Did you think -- were you aware of how the American public was responding to that,\nand that how that -- that things might have changed as far as amir -- American awareness\nof what had happened during the Holocaust after the Eichmann trial was televised in this\ncountry?",
        "A: Well, American people have haters, like all other countries of the world. We know\nBuchanan for instance, who are the defender of Demyjanjuk, and we know the ta -- at the\ntail end of it, that demyjan -- that Buchanan told his way of the war, and everything, that\nhe claims America did wrong, by coming to help diminish the Nazi era. So this question\nis a self centered to understand the -- for every American just to say, look in the mirror\nand see yourself. When we could have a man who was in the era, working with President\nReagan, to come out with a book the way he was written, so it\u2019s a very sordid on the\nAmerican people, because thanks God that we don\u2019t have many Buchanans around, so we\ncan still call ourselves a country of loving freedom, but not with this type of freedom that\nMr. Buchanan would like to see going on in this country. As a whole, I believe the\nAmerican people I never could condemn. I can only say not many American people are\ninvolved in the political systems, and they -- if they don\u2019t take a part in it, it\u2019s basically\nbecause they -- they cannot be participant without knowing cases. And they don\u2019t take\nthe time to learn it, they feel so free that we don\u2019t have to. But to preserve our freedom,\nwe must be participants 1n all these here political eras.",
        "Q: You -- have you experienced any anti-Semitism directly since you\u2019ve been 1n this\ncountry?",
        "A: I had a few cases where I had to send my cases to the Anti-Defamation League. In\nmost cases, when I ever wrote an article dealing with the Holocaust, or for instance when\nthe pope was visiting the USA at that time, and I reminisced in my article to the paper\nthat he was a young pope -- not pope, but he was a young preacher, at that time in Poland,\nand living in that era, he should know what the Hitlerites did to us, and I was speaking\nout against Pope Pius, not against him. I, as a matter of fact, went through in Israel with\nYad Vashem, to make a study of that era, and the whole world knows the secret that the\nVatican helped all these here criminals filter through Spain, and other places like this\nhere. But it\u2019s the funny thing, when you bring it out in the open, some people don\u2019t like\nto hear it, because to them, the word of a holy man, or the pope, is becoming a s -- a\nsacred item, and -- and whatever they say 1s right. That\u2019s how all these problems in the\nworld, through many years, without questions asked, had happened. Because the public\njust wanted to believe one story, and not hear the other side of that story. And I\u2019m afraid\nfor that type of thinking. So when I had to speak out, and it\u2019s not pleasing to others, I\u2019m\nsorry to say that, let him tell them -- let him prove that I\u2019m wrong, and it\u2019s another story.\nBut at any time my articles appeared in letters to the editor, so on, hate mail came to my\ndoors, with threatening, and the same way. And the ADL explained it to me, that because\nthese people are watching those letter writers to the editor, and at any time, they put on\nall this here kind of paraphernalia.",
        "Q: Do you feel safe in this country, or do you feel that the -- this -- that there is the\npotential for the kind of violent anti-Semitism that happened in Europe?",
        "A: I feel safe, for the time being. But as I said, when you become, in a c -- situation like\nthat, that you\u2019re so satisfied and pleased, that you don\u2019t look on the other side, it\u2019s very\ndangerous. So to say, or to foretell what might happen, first of all, I\u2019m not a prophet,\nsecond of all, I\u2019m a believer. I hope the younger people of today make it their business to\nbecome participants, be of the political system which -- what is going on, and become\nvocal. Don\u2019t keep this story to yourself, it\u2019s not a story to be hidden, it\u2019s a story to be\ndiscussed in public. I\u2019m very happy in my days, that I discussed certain things on college\nlevels, and high schools, that I spoke to them, and I\u2019m always open for the invitation\nwhen invited. As a matter of fact, I invited myself a few times to go in colleges where\nthey teach now the Holocaust story, which it became a part of the curriculum to teach,\nwhich I hoped that would have happened so many years ago, Hitler would have never\nbeen able to come. We see what it happens in Austria, with Haider right now. Look how\nit shook up the whole world, you know what I mean, just about letting this party come.\nSo I\u2019m very -- I feel very good that people get awakened these days, by any outbursts of\nthis nature. But to say that I feel safe, yes, but am I secured for the future what it be? I\ncannot foretell the future, I wish I could, and I would be able to answer that in another\nway.",

        "A: From the first day of my life that I survived. I couldn\u2019t speak about it in the ire --\nunder the Iron Curtain, needless for me to say, it would have been a foolish statement,\neven to make. So I will not tell you that I did, but as soon I got away from that curtain,\nmy mind was open, and I spoke about it, and when I came to the USA, like I said, in\n1948, I became a participant right away to organizations, until I did not get my\ncitizenship, I didn\u2019t want to make public some of the things, because let\u2019s just remember\nlike the question you asked me before, the era of McCarthyism, and just think back, \u201948.\nIn 1948, if you were in Soviet Union, you were right away a question mark, you know\nwhat I mean? So to tell you honestly, yes I was watching myself not to get caught in a\nbad web, because to defend oneself is not an easy situation. So, after I became a citizen, I\nbecame vocal immediately, and with every era, whatever time it happened, that I was\nspeaking of. And it didn\u2019t hurt me a bit that I had to disagree with B\u2019nai Brith, you know,\nbecause writing I did. I wrote to Mr. Foxman a few -- on a few occasions, and I became\nknown, looks like, to some papers, that as soon they see my name under the article, they\ndon\u2019t print it at ttmes. And I played a trick on the -- on a few of them, that I used another\nname, with my address, and to prove my point, they printed it. Which it means, it\u2019s not so\nmuch that they care for the story, but they care who writes it. And I wish it would be\ngood they would care for the other writers, who write the opposite, to be watching\nthemselves, but unfortunately, there, they\u2019re afraid maybe they can go ahead to touch on\nthe Free Speech amendment, where refusing me there is always ways, and how do they\nsay? We cannot let you write unless six months elapsed since the lax letters today. Of\ncourse, I\u2019m not a hired hand, I\u2019m just a letters to the editor writer, you know? So, of all\nkinds of ways, that\u2019s one of the items. I was told by the press, for instance, from the --\nfrom West Palm Beach, says, \u201cYou eve -- don\u2019t even live here.\u201d And that was the\npublisher had that. I says, \u201cMust one live over there to write an letter to the editor?\u201d So,\nexperiencing this through the years, I had the opportunity where I pass by, at one time\nwriting to -- in Texas to a paper, responding on something. And I was -- was writing with\na -- with a clergyman of high esteem, that the church didn\u2019t like too well, but we found a\ncertain view, something in common, which it was the billing between Hanukah and\nChristmas, and we corresponded quite awhile. So to me, teaching about hopeful ways,\nabout unifying people, about freedom loving people to be together, will always be a\nsubject to talk about, it does not have to be Nazis, it does not have to be neo-Nazis, or any\nof the -- like that. I love to converse with people, but above all, I will never sacrifice the\nfreedom of democracy for anything else. That\u2019s one thing I cannot live by, or have any\nreason.",
        "Q: You\u2019ve really become American.",
        "A: Yup.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you, you have mentioned that your -- your store was burned down in\n1968. Will you tell me about the -- about tha -- those events, the riots, and how you --\nwhat happened, and how you perceived the issues?",
        "A: I can conceive in a good, open mind, that what had happened to me with the riots, I\ndid not pluralize ever to say Black people, this, that and the other. Because in every\nsituation that it happens, it\u2019s going to be two sides to the story. My side of that story\u2019s a\n[indecipherable]. My store did not have just all Black, but I would say there were two\nbutchers, which they were white, and the other butchers, two of them were Black. The\nrest of the store, all my employees were Black, from management capacity, which at that\nparticular time -- so, in other words, [indecipherable] to the era why the riots broke out in\nChicago, because of the killing of Martin Luther King. My store should not be actually\nsuffering anything like that. But this is again, as I told you, freedom without justice does\nnot work, therefore, because innocent people get hurt. I consider myself that I was not the\nparty that had to get hurt, but maybe to say I was in the wrong neighborhood, and\ntherefore I got hurt because of that. So, many times when I interviewed for jobs, I didn\u2019t\nhesitate telling my background, what I did, and the first question would come, under the\ncircumstances that you\u2019ve been through, you obviously are prejudiced against Black. I\nsays, \u201cNo, I am not prejudiced against Black, I\u2019m prejudiced against wrongdoing.\u201d I\nbelieve in people demonstrate for a cause. Making riots and looting, is wrong. Regardless\nthat I wasn\u2019t the only one hurt, but that is not the way to spread an issue. So be that it\nhappened to me in 1968, with that other issues happened to other people in other times,\ntwo wrongs never made one right, and that\u2019s exactly what it is. While they are trying to\nwrong the wrongs, and trying to make them right, it\u2019s no use to follow in the fli -- same\nfootsteps, to make another wrong. So, to say that I\u2019m prejudiced, no, I do not see a Black\nperson other than I see myself in that regard. I respect him, and I would always hope that\nI'll be respected by them. I didn\u2019t run into any circumstances other than that, or because\nof that, but when you go -- I went another time, and reopened another store, and when\nthings began to change to the bad, when my store began to be broken into, and all of\nthese here things, I saw a repetition of that, yes, I went out. I made a going out of\nbusiness sale, and I went away from that neighborhood all together. Because I cannot be\nwatching times from changing. Times will change whether I watch it or not. So I figured,\nit\u2019s the wrong place for me to be, and I went out of there, that\u2019s all. I became a -- an\noutdoor salesman, I couldn\u2019t re-establish myself back in the retail business, because my\nfortune didn\u2019t go along with me, in other words, at the same time, I lost too much,\ninsurance companies of that era went broke because of that, so I was just an innocent\nvictim. Yes, I feel bad that it happened. Yes, I can ask questions, why did it happen to\nme? Maybe to say I didn\u2019t deserve to happen to me. It affects [indecipherable], it\nhappened. Now, I have two ways of looking at it. Do I look with more hatred? Seems I\u2019m\ntrying to define that I\u2019m against hatred, so it would be the ca -- same thing that I justify\nall the bad things that ever happened to me, that they are right. So that does not let me,\nand that\u2019s why those interviews for jobs, when they ask me that question, realize that I\ncan pass the test, that I am not a hate type of person. I was sitting next to Jesse Jackson,\nnext to me at the time when we worked together about stopping the Nazis from marching.\nWe were joining forces at that time, and I believe they, in many a -- things, what the\nBlack people want to see, any other minority wants to see the same way. And I hope it\u2019s\nclarified. I heard just recently in New York, and the things, what it was pulled out, with\nthe four policemen, please do not make riots, do not make break-ins, and I say Mr.\nSharpton was right, and I was happy to hear him say these words, because ideals cannot\nmix with violence. When you produce violence with ideals, the ideals get lost.",
        "Q: We should say, just for the record, that you\u2019re talking about the Amadou Diallo case\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, so this is the idea about it. I\u2019m a true believer in these things, even if I pay\ndearly for it, but everybody knows that with -- just to speak, and one way, it happens to\nsomeone else, and you speak -- in other words, when it happens to you, it\u2019s not wrong,\nit\u2019s not wrong. It\u2019s not right to be like that, you can\u2019t -- it\u2019s a good saying that it goes\naround. When one\u2019s husband -- when your neighbor\u2019s husband 1s laid off from work, it\u2019s\na recession, but when the husband from this house is laid off, then it\u2019s a depression. And\nthat\u2019s the same thing, I mean, two wrongs, no matter how many times we tried it, will\nnever prove to be right. So, no, I did not remain prejudiced due to the circumstances, it\nhappened to me. And again, even though I\u2019m hateful to the Nazis, I\u2019m not hateful to the\nGermans. As a matter of fact, last time I was in Israel was in June of 1998, and I was in\nthe company near us, 40 percent of the gatherings at [indecipherable] were Germans,\nwell, they were young German people, with the children of the same -- they were the ages\nof my own children. I spoke to them, I didn\u2019t feel threatened, I didn\u2019t feel any animosity\ntowards them. Yes, their parents, their grandparents were involved in all of that, as Mr.\nGoldhagen said, but this is my statement. I can speak German to a young person, and be\nhappy to speak, and that I know how to address them and speak. But I cannot speak to a\nperson who\u2019s older than me, or my age, because that -- that language that\n[indecipherable] all of this here, yelling, and [indecipherable] was only the way to\nconfuse the Jews, and -- and make them -- first strip them from rights, then strip them\nfrom anythings that they could, be that it\u2019s food, and they really -- killed out the\nintelligentsia first, so we were people that it was not enough left of the intelligentsia, nor\nenough left of -- in us, to be able to resist, and that\u2019s why we didn\u2019t resist in as many ---\nmore than it should have been. Besides, the population was not that open to help us, but\nthey would help the others, you know? When their kids were taken to Germany, and they\ndidn\u2019t like it, they helped the partisans, because they ca -- had where to escape. But Jews,\nthey didn\u2019t. Let\u2019s remember, the Germans put a price, to catch a Jew was worth a pig, and\nto catch a partisan was worth a horse, if he was Jewish. So they always had a price.\nThat\u2019s how we -- the -- the way of killing was so glamorized that it wasn\u2019t just the\nkilling. How much they can first give him all kinds of punishment, until he wished to be\ndead, that was the enjoyment to kill them. But they -- but in the partisans, when I caught\nsome Germans, to the police -- from the policeman [indecipherable] from that time, they\nwere begging for mercy. Please don\u2019t kill me. And it was a case, which in my manuscript\nI described. When we caught once that he was from the sondenfuehrer, and a girl that\n[indecipherable], he pulled out from his pocket pictures. He did not know whether we are\nJews, or other things, and he thought he would show us pictures of Jewish girls that he\nhas in his pocket, we do not know how these pictures came to be, and why he took them\nfrom the Jewish girls. Because that was their pleasure place, which they would take good\nlooking girls, take them in there, and use them, you follow me, sexual. So, this girl,\nseeing these pictures what he pulled out, she says, \u201cHarold, step it aside, this is all mine.\u201d\nAnd she didn\u2019t [indecipherable] on him, she smashed his head til he was dead. So I mean,\nit\u2019s a lot of things to understand about an era, be that it\u2019s resistance, be trying to w-w-way\nto resist, which people fail to understand what it was, the era at that time, what an era it\nwas to survive. But one thing I must comment over here, no matter how bad it was, the\nrate of suicides, as history will record, was very little. In other words, people just wanted\nto live, to outlive the enemy, no matter how miserable they lived, while living, it still -- it\nwas very easy, you disobey, and you shot, and you\u2019re dead. Didn\u2019t have to do any\nthreatening things. If you would die -- but people no, they wanted -- that\u2019s what it wa --\nthat was their expression of resistance, which I like to comment over here about the\nresistance. In 1983, in the gathering in Israel was, we got up about 5,000 partisans. The\nSoviet Union let out their partisans to come to Jerusalem to show in the strong -- we\nalmost mustered almost 5,000 people. which the medal that I showed you, that I got from\nthe state of Israel, is hanging over there. Anyways, at that particular time, that we got that\ntogether, one of the spokesman was a lady, a professor, her name was Kattan. The name\nKattan in Hebrew means short, small, and she was short, she was a small lady, but her\nwords were big. And she once told us, and she knows she\u2019s speaking at a gathering of\nfreedom fighters if you want to say, or resisters. She asked the question to us, how would\nyou describe yourself, what you did in the forest as resistance? One picked up his hand\nand he says, \u201cI killed so many Germans.\u201d Another picked up his hand, and he talked\nabout other things, what he did against the Germans. He [indecipherable] down so many\ntrains. The other one was doing -- and doing other diversionary work. She says, \u201cDo you\nconsider all of that, what? Fighting the enemy, or you consider that resistance?\u201d And\neverybody came out, it\u2019s one and [indecipherable]. She says, \u201cNo, resistance means if\nyou resisted the enemy for one more day to live while he wants to annihilate you. For one\nmore hour, for one more longer, that is resistance.\u201d The wire fences round all the camps\nelectrified. You could throw yourself against the fence any time, but few people threw\nthemselves against the fences. That in itself was resistance. Be that you had a machine\ngun, that you went openly in warfare -- ways, to fight and resist the enemy, or that you\nwithstand in that concentration camp, or that labor camp, or in the ghetto, that you\nsurvived an extra day to -- to give the enemy a loss that he didn\u2019t win yet, that is\nresistance. I think I want to inject [indecipherable] in this conversation at the same time,\nwe must learn, and very much be vigilant when we resist certain thing in our democratic\nway, and above all, I\u2019ll say it one more time, we must always fight for freedom, and laws\nwith justice. If you don\u2019t have justice in it, we just don\u2019t have our fulfillment of freedom.",
        "Q: Okay, I just have a few more questions, and --",
        "A: Go ahead.",
        "Q: -- say whatever -- whatever you want. Whose -- one question 1s, we -- did you ever\nreturn to Australenka, or to [indecipherable]",
        "A: I believe, if you remember, I told you the story, when I came to Bialystok, and I met a\nfriend of mine, and he told me that one returned there, and got killed right away. I cannot\nreturn back to Poland, and see that -- the ground there. I must invoke here the story of the\n14\" century [indecipherable] As we all know, the Inquisition [indecipherable] history of\nwhat it was. You -- if you wanted to become Christian, you had life, if you didn\u2019t want,\nthey expelled you. On the ships of expulsion, at that particular time, the rabbis of the era\nwho were there, with all that creation, they created this [indecipherable] which a lot of\nJudaism was created. They put out sort of a restriction order, that forever after, no Jew\nshall dwell in Spain. To me, that evendoor Franco, who let the Jews escape 1n the -- the\nNazis come to Spain, while Hitler bitterly protested it, but Hitler could not afford to go\nand fight Franco, you know, for what he did. A story, I must tell you that story in my\nmanuscript, I would like to show this, now that you mention, but what I wanted to bring\nout is, we did not have enough intellectual people, even including Elie Wiesel, who wrote\na lot of work, and more like Elie Wiesel, that they did not insert that we cannot return\nback to these places of se -- of cemeteries. In Judaic law we provide a saying, that you\ncannot dwell on a cemetery, just like we are told with Egyptian people in Cairo live on\nthe cemeteries, because of shortage of room. The cemeteries are created for dead people,\nand not for leef -- live people to live there. To us, the biggest cemeteries of the world\nwere left in these European countries, and the biggest one in Poland. Therefore, Judaic\npeople are forbidden to dwell there. But we did not have enough of the clergy to dwell on\nthat issue, and to make it public. To people who come back, and everyone who comes\nback, who didn\u2019t live in that era, but lives in today\u2019s era, and they come back, and when\nyou talk to them, they have only one thing to say, the anti-Semitism in Poland is very\nvisible, and it\u2019s very open. Even though Israel is dealing with the Polish people. Even\nthough Israel is letting in Polish people to come to Israel, and everything else. Look, anti-\nSemitism is a disease, and no more like certain diseases are incurable, for the time being,\nwe haven\u2019t found a cure for that anti-Semitism. Should I say that the religion fed into\nthese people is part, if not fully the declaration of anti-Semitism? Perhaps, maybe it\u2019s one\nof it. But anti-Semitism, we must take it as a disease, and cure as a disease, because we\ncannot say, \u201cOh, you shouldn\u2019t say that,\u201d this and that. We see -- I say we -- we see these\nthing -- people in the open, we see what these people are doing, and the anti-Semitism 1s\nstill alive. So, I said I\u2019ll tell you a little story about Spain, what had happened in that era,\nin the [indecipherable], I mentioned that story in my manuscript. At that particular time,\nHitler was tremendously trying to influence the Spanish people, first of all that they\nshould join his armies, then help him defeat the enemy, and above all help him defeat the\nJews. So he used to send them [indecipherable] there, to make speeches, and he tells the\nstory about at one farm area country over there, one of these emissaries came, and\ngathered them together, and trying to say to them, you know we\u2019re losing the war, only\nbecause of the Jews. If it wouldn\u2019t be for the Jews, we would not ho -- have suffered all\nthese losses. And all what it went bad with Germany, he [indecipherable] tried to blame it\non the Jews. And therefore, he says, we must root them out, we must kill them wherever\nwe find them. When he got through with his speech, all these farmers, everybody had --\nthey had tools what they used for farming, grabbed them in their hands, and they went\nchasing to found Jews. So illusion --\nEnd of Tape Four, Side B\nBeginning Tape Five, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number five, side A, of an interview with Harold Zissman.",
        "A: Even though from the 14\" century on, and that we are talking about the year of the\n20\" century, so for 600 years, no Jews were in the areas there. To their dismay, they were\nrunning, and running, and they couldn\u2019t find a Jew, so they should kill him to please the\nspeakers, demand, and desire, and what he told them to do. Even though it\u2019s only a story,\nbut again, I support what I said to the outset, that anti-Semitism 1s a disease. It\u2019s not a\nbecause, because they did this, or because they did that. Because we found them in places\nwhere Jews did not even live there at all. So you\u2019d say why -- wh-wh-why do you got --\nwant to blame them? It\u2019s an inherent disease, like any other diseases we haven\u2019t cured in\nthe world yet, which you have to do, and this disease, apparently, until now, had not been\ncured. And we must hope and strive to cure this disease, until such time will not come --\nwe'll still have to be vigilant, and we will suffer with that same disease.",
        "Q: Okay. What are the names of your children, and I -- I was just thinking, maybe you\ncould tell us something about -- about your kids, and your grandkids.",
        "A: Okay. My oldest daughter\u2019s name is Rosalie, and in Italy, they was a very famous\nname at the time, and we named her Rosalie. So Rosa, Rosa, you find a lot of this here.\nWe are very proud, and she has her name at times, since she\u2019s in a school, in a Hebrew\nschool that she calls it Shoshanna. As a matter of fact, she just became a grandmother,\nand she\u2019s be -- going to be called for her grandchild, Safta, which is the Hebrew word for\ngranny. And that\u2019s what she chose to be. So she\u2019s very much involved in the educational\nfield. As I aforementioned to you before in our conversation, I -- which I didn\u2019t do with\nyou on tape, that she was, after she got married, her husband was still going to law\nschool, and he graduated George Washington University, while she took up over there,\nher Masters, at George Washington University. She had taken up another Masters since,\nand she\u2019s right now studying for her Ph.D. She -- she was teaching at the time in -- ina\nschool over there, which it was dignitaries children, some from ambassadors, and so on.\nAnd when I came to visit with her, there wasn\u2019t enough words th-they -- that I her --\ncould be heard by the man who was the supervisor, to tell me about my daughter, which\nI\u2019m very proud of. She brought me three children, the oldest one\u2019s name is Jennifer, the\nnext one, who just got married -- and Jennifer is married, and that\u2019s was their first child,\nEmily. The next one was Marissa, which she just got married, and her husband\u2019s name is\nBen, and Jennifer\u2019s husband I fe -- don\u2019t want to forget to say, his name is Jeff. So\ntherefore, my son-in-law, we call Jeffrey, or we call him Jeff. And my son-in-law, as I\nmentioned, 1s a graduate at-attorney, and he\u2019s very well a part of the law. He\u2019s involved\nin a variation of businesses, and thanks God he\u2019s doing good for -- for his family. My\nwife, being in love with education, still is t -- like I say, with the education on the school,\nand I\u2019m happy that all the parents from the children, like it used to be before, and the\nchildren, when we come visiting with her, we\u2019ll go to a restaurant, oh daddy, mommy.\nThis is my children from this and this grade, and the mommy\u2019s -- so she not -- not only\nknows the kids well, in a good way, but even the parents of the kids. So I\u2019m proud of it.\nNow, the youngest son of theirs is -- is Jordan, and he is right now in Texas, in college, at\na -- Dallas, which I\u2019m very happy and proud of him, too, and he looks like he\u2019s going for\nbusiness in there. And my son has two sons, just like he was a gymnast throughout\nschool, from Skokie, from Niles East, his kids did not follow exactly his way, but they\nplayed, and we used to come to meet some summertime, to come to Chicago, see them\nplay baseball, and they -- they involved in sports, probably the youngest one likes\nbasketball, what\u2019Il hap -- be outcome. The older one, Scott is his name, the younger one\nis the name Mark. My son\u2019s wife name, Susie, and she 1s also going now for her Ph.D.\nShe\u2019s also principal in a school. So round and ra -- and around, I\u2019m glad.",
        "Q: Thank you.",
        "A: And I\u2019m very happy that education worked, and it was my persuasion to the kids since\nthey were little, to help them. I\u2019m proud of myself that I could help even my\ngrandchildren, not only my kids, with -- scholastically, with their schools, since my\nmemory, thanks God, was good, and I was always a good student in school. So that was\nthe case, that I not only prevailed with me, of telling them, but I\u2019m happy to see the\nfruition of them, that they\u2019re all doing good, and they\u2019re educated very well, thanks God.",
        "Q: I have the impression, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, that -- that it\u2019s been very important to\nyou to carry on the Jewish tradition --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- and I -- I wonder if -- if you -- if they are all -- they have had Bar Mitzvahs, Bat\nMitzvahs [indecipherable]",
        "A: You asked a very good question. I must say that my son married girl who converted to\nJudaism, she was not Jewish. And someone would listen to her on the pulpit, where my\ngrandchildren had Bar Mitzvah, they would not think that she 1s not Jewish. In the\nneighborhood, she is from Skokie, you know what I mean, which it was a lot of Jewish\npeople. And so it worked good. Both of my -- both of their kids are recognizing their\nJewishness. Both of them had Bar Mitzvahs. Then, of course, the oldest one is -- his\nname is Scott, 1s now in the university in Ohio -- in -- no, excuse me, 1n -- let\u2019s see, 1s it\nIowa State College, taking up structural engineering, and we s -- cami -- we -- once 1n a --\nwe talk to each other, like I say. I come once a year at least to Chicago, so we can visit\nwith each other. At times they come here. So depends which way, because to me, I -- I\ncannot put myself in a position to be away from my grandchildren, no more than for my\nchildren. So, all in all, the three grandchildren of my daughter, I had more closer contact,\nsince they were -- the oldest one was born in Chicago, but the other two were born right\nhere. So, they all know about it. My daughter, and my son-in-law, have a good write up\nin the zig -- museum, over here in Miami Beach. They also involved with Jewish causes,\nthey are good donors, like I am. I gave them the example, as you saw in the room, which\nI have the accolades for it. We believe in Jewish hope, we believe in Jewish future, and\nyes, being a survivor from the Holocaust, I did not go to blame God for that, as I said it to\nyou before, I blame man, because man could have helped us, and they didn\u2019t. So it\u2019s no\nuse to me to look for God. In -- 1n some people\u2019s belief, God put us on earth, and he gave\nus the wisdom to decide what to do. So when we do wrong, we can only blame ourselves,\nand not the maker. It\u2019s the same thing like you ri -- raise a child, and you tell him the\ngood things, and then all of a sudden, the child goes to do a bad thing. So, sure,\nsomebody would say -- the outsider would say, \u201cIt\u2019s your fault, you didn\u2019t raise him\nwell.\u201d But you know in your heart that you raised him well, it\u2019s just that it happened to be\nthat way, and you -- and you probably as a parent, accepted that way. But you don\u2019t go to\nblame the parent that they didn\u2019t raise him well. And that is my total belief in that way.\nBut yes, I\u2019m very proud to see -- we, in two different Judaism belonging. Both of my kids\ngo to Reform, they find themselves more comfortable there. I\u2019m a Conservative Jew, and\nI find myself comfortable where I belong, you know? But I never try to interfere with\nthem, I attended services in their synagogues, and whatever it 1s on my side, what\npersuasion I believe should be a personal thing, and what you feel yourself comfortable\nin.",
        "Q: I think I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I think that\u2019s the end of my questions for today. Do you have\nanything that -- that you can think of that I haven\u2019t touched -- asked you, that you\u2019d like\nto talk about?",
        "A: Well, a-as I said to you to begin with, if I was to prepare with question and answers\nfrom you to begin with, I could make it in an orderly way, and I would remor less, but\nsince it was part from the others, and part of the new one, you know what I mean, and I\ndidn\u2019t put it in the order the way it happened, it sometimes could be omitted. So, I believe\nI, at the moment cannot think of anything left out, because I believe I s -- not to praise my\nown self, but participating in so many things, and it doesn\u2019t matter. I was a member also\nthe Holocaust Museum, while I was a member also to the Simon Wiesenthal. As far as\nmy writing, and asking like this here, I was always, like I say -- Pll never forget when the\nmovie was made, from Simon Wiesenthal at that time, and in that movie, it showed a\ncase, where typically, what the -- the inmate of a concentration camp becames pregnant --\ndo you know that movie, what it was, or you don\u2019t -- or you didn\u2019t see it, it was\n[indecipherable]. And she was pregnant by that commanding officer. And later that\nhusband -- oh, the -- in -- in camp, which it was the boyfriend of hers, when later, after so\nmany years absence, because he escaped to the partisans, he didn\u2019t know about her, and\nlater when he discovers her -- so when he discovers where she 1s, he makes so many\nattempts, and somehow or other, she does not want to s -- recognize herself. And the\nstory ends that he makes a trip over there, he builds with his -- sim -- with Simon\nWiesenthal [indecipherable] to make the movie. And then he comes there, she greets him,\nand then he takes a look at the child, and he sees the child s-so much close -- in close\nlook at him, he looks like the commander of that camp from which he escapes. And she\nfinally admits to him what had happened with the rest. And now she tries to tell him why\nshe h -- was in hiding of that whole case, because how she -- she\u2019s still in love with him,\nand that did not happen out of love that she has a baby with the other. And it happened\nthe case is, that she does not want to testify against that particular murderer, from that\ncamp. So she tests -- testifies why, she tells him the story why she cannot do that, because\ntake a look at it, that\u2019s his son. She had -- what is to be told to that child? And that child\nalready was involved with so many good things, pro-Zionism, pro-Israel, and everything\nlike that, while he grew up with. So now -- so this case, and the [indecipherable] in other\nwords, that they sort of -- that came the ending, without a conclusion. I wrote to Simon\nWiesenthal about it, I mean, in -- in the -- in the -- California, and they told me, if you\nwant to, you can write to Simon Wiesenthal your protest, which they gave me the address\nto write to him in Vienna, and everything like that. That was one of my things that I was\nagainst it of the ending of that movie. In other words, you ended the movie with sort of,\nwhat do you think? What do you think it was? Was she justified not to go to answer, or\nwasn\u2019t she not justified? And itll always be a question about it. I personally, as I say, she\nwas justified to go even, she answered the question. He\u2019s a human being, he\u2019s a child, so\nshe got impregnated by -- in a forceful way, and that should not have stop her from\nshowing to be contessing against him. I opposed it tremendously why the mov -- I was\nhappy the movie was shown, but the way it ended, I definitely -- so, which I\u2019m only\ntrying to say, just talking about the Holocaust is not the full satisfaction. In my case,\nwhen something is wrong, if they do it in a visual way, or the other -- \u201cMax and Helen,\u201d\nwas the name of that movie, and it was -- and it was the movie -- you probably -- could\nprobably, maybe find about it, and that\u2019s what the name, \u201cMax and Helen.\u201d And you\u2019d\nfind it -- and basically what I told you in short, 1s what it deals. Like I say, everybody has\ntheir opinion, but my opinion was when you put the name of Simon Wiesenthal on there,\nand he was -- I was -- I\u2019m very happy with the man who discovered so many murderers,\nthat they would have been dome in the cases like this here. But no one is perfect, I\nsuppose, in this world, and that was a goofball by Simon Wiesenthal, not that he planned\nit to work out that way. And it was a thing, 1t was done, it was over. I watched that movie\ntwice that night. I called California because it was three hours, so the guard, looks like,\nwas the Israelite. And I spoke to him in Hebrew, and he gave me even the address to\nwrite directly, and it -- I wrote, and I got a letter from them at the same time responding.\nWell, it\u2019s Simon Wiesenthal is responsible, he was the one producing that. So, what you\ntalk to us over here [indecipherable] or the others, we had nothing to do with the\nproducing it. I merely for the case, so that -- wanted to tell you about it, because for\nalways, and forever, I will remain involved in the cause, or in the fight of justice, because\nthis 1s, again, it was an unjust case. It -- let\u2019s surmise and to say, because she didn\u2019t come\nto be the witness, maybe he didn\u2019t get the proper punishment, or was punished at all.\nNow, I don\u2019t believe that a murderer should be brought -- so somebody who constru --\nwho made that movie should have made that part be a -- sure, all of this, but it should\nhave ended in a different way. It could have perhaps ended that her testimony was not in\na person to person kind of way, but it was in a -- taking a deposition, and therefore he\nwas -- [indecipherable] so much in prison, or whatever it is. At least 1t would have had a\ndecent ending to what it is. Do you follow me what I am saying? But like this here,\nbecause it produced a child, and for her to expose it to this child, sooner or later,\nsomeday, he will know about it. Be that she will tell him, or others will tell him. Max had\nthe -- meanwhile, had to leave that sort of -- he was in love with her, she was in love with\nhim. And that came in the disturbance, you understand? So that\u2019s why they named the\nmovie \u201cMax and Helen.\u201d And, like I say, it\u2019s a hard taken movie, to see all the situation,\nwhat it took, until he must have told her that godsen came to see that, you know. But to\nmy case, what I\u2019m bringing it out, is to prove once more that it\u2019s not just one way or the\nother, I\u2019m still -- you find the same person all the way around, with the same opinions.\nSo, I told you about my children, I told you about myself -- about my wife Ill wait for\nyou find out. She\u2019s been a good wife to me, and a good mother to my grand -- to my\nchildren, and grandchildren. We just celebrated in January, our 55\" wedding anniversary.",
        "Q: Congratulations.",
        "A: Thank you. And I -- we are still in love with each other, which it\u2019s a good sign. When\nour children made our 50\" anniversary, and -- a surprise when we were in Chicago. I told\nthem, you see, always, whenever you have arguments between husband and wife, take\nthe model from us. We also had arguments, but never walked the bedroom door away,\nclose it or stuff like this here, because remember, it could be done, if you want to. We\nhave a good Zionistic saying from -- from Intiered sue, he said -- [indecipherable] said it,\nif you been heroed -- the first proclamation, if you will want to, it will come true. And\nlife is that way. When two people are married, and they want to stay married, they\u2019Il be\nmarried. But if they are looking for a break someplace, e -- they\u2019Il find it, you know? And\nthat\u2019s the idea about it. So I always am happy to say thanks God my daughter celebrated -\n- she got married in 1968 -- \u201969 rather, in si -- \u201968 was the riot, she graduated from school\nin \u201969. So they had already 30 years of marriage, which it\u2019s a good, happy occasion. So\nmy husband -- my son and his wife are in good family standing in the same way, even\nthough he travels, and so on. Hardworking, both of them.

Because on the radio it comes out a different story, anybody could imitate,\nand tell it, but you gotta see the person, too. But I suppose that\u2019s all their budget allowed\nthem to do, and I will re-invigorate myself to become again a member. I already told you,\nwhich I don\u2019t want to go on tape about what it 1s, not that it -- it\u2019s any difference, but I\nbelieve the tape doesn\u2019t need to hear negative stories, I\u2019m not a negative teller. So Ill just\nsay I'll b -- Pll be coming back a supporter of the Holocaust Museum. I already told you\nthe story what I had to go through a few times, with people in the know, that it should not\ncriticize the mus -- Holocaust museums in -- no matter where it\u2019s built -- being built, it\u2019s\nour utmost. We saw what had happened in Germany, they want to build a museum in\nBerlin, and that\u2019s where Holocaust museum belongs. We must help and support the idea\nthat the people of tomorrow, the German people of tomorrow, and any people of the\nworld, who\u2019ll ever come to visit Berlin, they should be able to see of the bad era of\nhistory that it happened, because when you hide yourself behind, you only make that\nbecome a repetition, but when you speak about it, you educate things about it, that\u2019s a\npreservation of not to make the same mistake over again.",

        "Answer: Okay, I moved in here originally, in January, about two or three, of 1981. And\nI\u2019ve been living here in the same apartment, since. I bought a apartment here before it\nwas built, I bought it off a plan, and that\u2019s where we spent all these years now since,\nwhich it means over 20 years hence. Is coming through good?",
        "A: Okay.\nvery clear to me what liberation meant, and whether there was a moment when you were\nactually liberated, when you were recognizing, okay, I\u2019m not responsible for being\nplatoon commander any more, and I\u2019m -- I\u2019m a -- now I have to decide what comes next.\nCan you describe that a little more?",
        "A: Of course. That was a very hard thing at the time, turning the clock back to the era.\nThe forest sort of served as -- as a safety, away from the people who wanted my life, sort\nof -- without a gu -- good reason. Therefore, my separation from the forest was a very\nhard one to do. The commanding officer that particular time, when asked by two of my\nfor -- comrades who were in my platoon, ask me why am I not going out to join them,\nand see where I can enlist myself to do a jo -- to work, well he told them, \u201cWhere do you\nthink Harold is going to go? Is he going to enlist himself to be in the police? No, I don\u2019t\nthink I want him to be there, I want him to be in a more important job.\u201d\u201d\u00bb Whereupon, not\nso long after that, I\u2019m getting an assignment to go to -- and take some people that they\nimmediately drafted, between the ages of 18 through 45, to join the Red Army\u2019s armed\nforces. And be for the fact that the railroad tracks between Grodno and Marstee, were not\nready, because we, the partisans, the yesterday\u2019s destroyers of that, to s -- to not let the\nGermans be able to carry on their war, now had a problem of going back to see that\nthey\u2019ve all repaired, so the Red Army could be able to bring in their supplies, as well as\nmanpower. So, they were drafted and I could -- well, was ordered to organize a -- another\nsquad because I could -- I did not have enough to make a platoon, because everybody\nwas trying to get organized, and they [indecipherable] me to do it. So I must have gone\nabout maybe 10 or 12 guys, and with that I started, and I reported to duty. And with\nbayonets open, we were marching them like they were prisoners, much rather than they\nwere the people who are willing to serve, and go to fight the war, to liberate the rest of\nthem, be the end of Germany. It made a bad impression on me, but an order 1s an order, I\nhad to do it. So, freedom at that particular time to me, I did not even get taste of the\nfreedom yet. I can only explain myself that those same people that I have to guard -- I\nhad to guard at the time to take them, still had in them that anti-Semitism, although I\ndidn\u2019t do anything against those people. They couldn\u2019t accuse me personally, but a\npluralistic way of hate, because I was a Jew, didna -- still was imbedded in them, and I\nfelt the non-safety there. It took us al -- it took us almost until we put them on the train,\nand we go -- and we were able to move, was almost a week before the train could start\noperating. And as soon we reached the old border between the U.S. -- between the Soviet\nUnion, and Poland, the KGB -- the army KGB took over command, and I was getting\npapers to be released with my squad that I had over there, and to go back to our -- well, I\nwas told while living, where the officers are going to be, the local officers. However, I\nwas told by my commanding officers, if I should return, and they will not be there any\nmore. The staff -- the general staff will be in Minsk, which was the capital of Belarus,\nand I am to report to any of those places, after my assignment will be done. Whereupon --",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s what it was at that particular time, our returning back to Minsk was used,\nsince I had papers to be housed, and to be fed. So it was sort of used like vacationing.\nAfter all, now we are free birds on ourselves. From my whole squad, I only remained\nthree of -- two of the former guys, which they were Belarus, and I was their command\npor -- before I was their platoon commander, and now they were with me. They were sort\nof more like friends that we knew during the war, and during the partisans, when I would\ncome in their settlement, they parents knew me, and as a matter of fact, I felt relief to be\nin their company, because relieve means secure. I was secure that no foul things could\nhappen towards me in that particular time. So, we all went to that particular time, I\nreceived my medals, well I -- well I already said, being on the train, and all of a sudden, I\nfound myself that I\u2019m going to work for the KGB, which this was the farthest thing of my\nmind that I ever expected to happen. But I am the -- took soldiering before, when I\nescaped the ghetto, and I figured I\u2019m continuing the same way. Besides that, I know the\nconsequences, what it would have been had I refused, and I would not want to become a\nKGB working person. However, when I came to Borontvitch, which that was sort of the\nre-region to where I was going to work, in that office there, and I passed all the tests they\nwanted me to know, I told them that I wanted to go now for a little bit vacation with the\ntwo guys that they enlisted themselves in the militia, and not in the KGB, because their\neducation was below mine, and therefore they wouldn\u2019t pass to go into the KGB. And I\nwanted to go back to their settlement. Besides, I wanted, by any chance of all, maybe\nthere was someone of my family, who by -- by any kind of way, survived, and if\nanything, probably that would be the place to meet them. On the other hand, I was\nseparated from the partisans, the Jewish partisans, who were natives of Darechen -- of\nthat -- of that city where the ghetto was that I escaped to the forest. I had my desire to go\nahead to meet them, because we were separated, since I joined the other part, which it\nwas in arvens, which I mean the paratroopers, with the General kus -- with General\nKustenko. So I was separated from all my past, sort of, in -- in spirit, as well as\nphysically, and I was anxious to go there. So when I put it out that I want to go for two\nweeks, I was granted, and meaning granted at that particular time, you had to have a\npermit, otherwise, without a permit, you could have been arrested easily, and who knows\nwhere to -- you could wind up. So -- and I came to the house of -- Volodya was the guy\u2019s\nname, and his cousin, and I was greeted like I would have been his brother, no | -- no\nless. His mother and sister were there with open arms, and we kissed each other, and\nhugged each other, that we survived, and came not injured. And his mother gave him to\nchange of her clothing, she gave me. And the next thing, we went that evening cut -- in\nthe fi -- in the settlement there. A guy was playing on the harmonica, we were dancing,\nthe boys and the girls, and to me, while we started to drink, 1s the usual way it would\nhave been at the time, and it was -- 1-it was not regular vodka, it was homemade brew,\nsort of, to speak. And I don\u2019t know, no matter what I drank, somehow or other, I didn\u2019t\nget drunk. My mind was so busy think -- to think, where do I go from here? And it\u2019s not\nany other way that I could explain this, I just did not have a resoluting, I want to go and\ndo this, I want to go look to do this. In a way, I felt sorry for myself immediately. Look,\nhere [indecipherable] he had a place to come, he had a mother, he had a sister, he had\ncousins, he had -- what about me? I did not have anyone in -- or anywhere\u2019s to turn, to\nsay to myself, I\u2019m happy. We met, we are good. But everything was sort of like it would\nnot have been real. It just like a fantasy that you dream about, or stuff like this here. So I,\nagain, was very mixed. I worked with him a whole week on the farm. It was potatoes they\ndo, because at the time of year. It\u2019s September when we are talking about, and at that\nparticular time, farmers pick the potatoes there, and so on, because the other grain was\nalready picked. And really, the need for help was in -- in a very bad way, because his\nmother an-and -- and his sister could not attend to it. So in a way, I was a handy helper,\nhel -- helping hand there. And to me at that particular time, a certain fantasy got into my\nmind again, why would I want to continue as a Jew? And immediately I saw a -- a\ndifferent horizon, sort of, in a way of speak. Look at it. We both for the war, he was\nagainst Nazism, he escaped to the partisans because he did not want to be drafted to go to\nGermany, to work with the Nazis. But look what had happened to the two of us. I had no\none to come to, he comes back home. And he going and working, and coming at night,\nbetween meeting up with the boys and the girls. Like I say, a certain fantasy, I -- I call it\nthe fantasy, because real, I was not looking for that. So I must call it a fantasy got into my\nmind, and that\u2019s what I thought, who knows? Maybe I\u2019m going to get lost right now to\nthese new world, and forget about the world that I lived in. And come Friday, the whole\nthing came to a change, whereupon Volodya says to me, \u201cHarold, aren\u2019t you going to go\nto Darechen?\u201d Darechen meaning the city nearby -- not so nearby, but from where the\nghetto was. And he knew these partisans, these same guys from Darechen fought\ntogether. Where he says to me, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to see your Jews, over there?\u201d He all of\na sudden out of nowhere came out, while we were discussing -- I was discussing to\nmyself, what happens Sunday now? Their church was still on over there, 1t was not\ndestroyed, and what if he asks me -- I go with him on the farm, and work with him\ntogether. I associate in the same groups of people. What will it be, how will I feel if I\u2019m\nasked to go to the church with him together? And I did not know at the moment, so when\nhe start talking about, and using that word, you Jews, instead of using the word, aren\u2019t\nyou going go see our friends, the partisans, over in Darechen? You know what I mean, or\nmaybe naming someone? But he said you Jews. So I felt a separation going on, and I --\nall of a sudden I awakened like from a dream, and says, \u201cWait a minute now, I cannot\nhide myself.\u201d Oh, I cannot run away, because each sort of day is something that it isn\u2019t\ntotally open. And I immediately said to him, \u201cOf course I want to see, but you know how\nwe worked every day long hours, and hard work, how was I to disrupt you and me from\nthat work, and ask you about going to Darechen? But since you don\u2019t plan on working\nperhaps tomorrow,\u201d because Saturday -- I did not observe S-Saturday, so anything like\nthat at that time, because under the Soviets, religion was another part of life that you did\nnot practice. So I said to him, \u201cIf time permits you, I will be very happy that you give it\nto me, and I will also ask you to please let me go to the cemetery.\u201d",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Volodya, yeah.",
        "A: I -- I did since we wound up work -- after all, after the two weeks were up, we were\nback in Boronivitch, he to the militia. We went on the same train, at the same time. But\nfrom Darechen, I did not return back to his farmland. I only told him, I says, when --\nwe'll meet at it -- because I had to go to Zelbo, which is -- was the name, to take the train\nand to go to Boronivitch. So we said we\u2019|l meet approximately the same time. It so\nhappened that we did meet on the station, and we went with the same train to\nBoronivitch, while he went to the militia. His cousin didn\u2019t go -- di -- wa -- didn\u2019t take\nthe job there, so he remained separately. He, as a matter of fact, volunteered coming back\nto the army, you know? And we met back in Boronivitch, but it was not any longer in\nBoronivitch that we met as quickly, or as frequently as we wanted. And another thing I\nwant to point out here, be for what he asked me, pertaining, as a I pointed out to the\nquestion, you Jews. I did not want to carry that as a stick, sort of to punish him with that,\nor asking him why did he say it, because in my mind, I saw the natural thing of it. You\nknow, other words, it\u2019s I and you, and he sort of was not ready to hear from me, or to see\nfrom me, that hey Volodya, what do you mean you, or this, that and the other, we are just\none, and I\u2019m working the same way. So I did not take up any time. So whenever I would\nmeet up with him, we meet -- we would meet again like yesterday\u2019s friends, and not any\ncriticism whatsoever, because I took it in my heart a justifiable way, the way he said it.\nHe didn\u2019t prepare himself to make a speech. He just said about the way he felt. So\ntherefore, I never criticized it, or take -- took it [indecipherable]. So yes they would meet.\nNow, I don\u2019t know whether I told you that I got married, after which -- in January, I don\u2019t\nknow in the previous tape did I mention about it?",
        "A: I believe I did.",
        "A: That on January five we got married --",
        "A: -- and the way I took in my hands, because I still was a reckless type of a person, even\norganized, and working the KGB. But certain instincts from the partisans, that you have\nto make decisions, still were left in me, and it was a hard time for me to get rid of it, that\nI\u2019m constantly under the saluting, and under the command, and -- and th-there 1s a\nprogram that I have to do. So the same thing happen when I get married -- when I wanted\nto go and get married. Three times I applied, and they didn\u2019t let me give, so I decided,\nhey, nobody\u2019s going to hold me back, and -- and later, when I come back they arrest me,\nbut the colonel comes, and releases me within -- and wants to put my commanding\nofficer there in -- in my place in jail, because he says, \u201cHe was legitimately that he three\ntimes asked you, and you answer -- why didn\u2019t you let him go?\u201d He says to him, \u201cI did\nnot have anybody to replace his work, he was doing the work for three people.\u201d So he\nsays, \u201cWhat did you do on those days that he was not here? When he was -- went away to\nget married?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201cit was very hard, you know, but I mean to manage.\u201d He\nsays, \u201cSo you see, you could have managed, you could have said to him, you can only get\nthree days, four days, two days, so therefore you are the guilty, and not Harold,\u201d and he\nasked me at that particular time, as I -- my name at the time was Grigory Grisher, they --\neverybody used to call me Harold, my name became in the USA. So -- and therefore, in\nmy heart, all this here handling, was already a premonition of how I will escape, because\nI -- I appreciated the Soviet Union, that it gave me the opportunity to save my life, as well\nas so many more other Jews, that it could save their life and not be annihilated by the\nNazis. But at the same time, I didn\u2019t think that I owe them my life since I didn\u2019t agree\nwith the Communistic system. Communism was a very strange bedfellow in my mind.\nEven they tried to ingrain me through the school, and so on, but I -- I-I just didn\u2019t --\ndidn\u2019t go follow that. So that particular time, the animosity that I build up in myself, of\nthe way the system works was already -- I was looking for that window, and especially,\nas I aforementioned before, when I went to register, and in the registration I find out that\nit -- being -- working with KGB I sort of -- not that I didn\u2019t think it couldn\u2019t happen, I\ndidn\u2019t believe that it would happen, because it was a -- an official thing, posted\neverywhere, that anybody who was living in Poland before 1939, and they wished to\nreturn back can do it. But all of a sudden, I was called in, and with a locked door, as\nanybody who wrote about authoritarian governments, or Communism the way, and the\nboss kept me from 10 in the morning til five o\u2019clock, and questioning me about every\nlittle detail, which I sense that he wants to find something wrong in me, so he could go\nahead. Although he did not have a good reason, if he wanted to jail me, he could. But\nsomehow or other, he wanted to make a goo -- case for himself, and he couldn\u2019t break me\ndown. That not breaking down gave me a fever. I don\u2019t know what I remembered saying\nthat, about all of that.",
        "A: Well, if you have that story, so you know I escaped --",
        "A: -- and I escaped to Bialystok, which it was the first stop to Poland.",
        "A: I later found out that a -- KGB had sent two guys, which both of them are still alive,\none in Israel, and one is in -- is -- is in the USA, that they were chasing after me to find\nme in Bialystok, and there, one day -- y-you know what I mean, from Bialystok I realized\n-- | met a friend of mine, and I wanted to go into city where -- in 1939, from where I sort\nof -- we -- we were chased out from there, because it became Third Reich, and finding in\nBialystok a friend that we went to school with together, he forewarned me, he says,\n\u201cHarold, please. You survived the war, why do you want to go back and get killed?\u201d\nBecause he mentioned me somebody who went into the city, and he did not hardly live a\nday before they killed him. And I must p-put in a note why that happened the way it\nhappened. After all, somebody took away our homes, somebody took away our business.\nThey did not want to have any witnesses to come back to claim it back. And the fact is\nwa -- I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t receive any money. All this time, while people got money from\nGermany, and I didn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t register til ma -- at the time, when 1952 was the\ndeadline. So therefore, I understood the situation why. I did not want at that particular\ntime, risk my life, and I listen to him, and realizing that -- since that it\u2019s -- what is going\non, I wanted to go deeper. And the reason I wanted to go deeper, I wanted to go a little bit\nmore close, I came there for to Lodz, which it was a big industrial city before the war.\nAnd it was not totally destroyed during the war, it was some left over there, because that\nwas the trend sort of -- some people, I met some more people over there that I knew from\nbefore, and we found out that\u2019s the place to go. While being in Lodz, I meet up the Major\nShpark, which it was his name, and he was the one also, who were after me to look in\nMinsk, because I was distrusted. To straighten up for the record was, that at that\nparticular time when I made my papers, the new papers, I no longer was Zucherman, but\nmy new name was Zissman, as I held to present. So, in other words, I had to change my\nname in order to get the documents from the Polish commission to transfer me. But under\nthe name of Zissman, there was no record for them to go and listen, or ask, so therefore\nthat\u2019s what it helped me. I don\u2019t believe I told it in the first recording, in that particular --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I -- I was telling -- to tell you the truth, it was a grave mistake at that particular time,\nbecause I was so in -- I became to the United States, already had a child, and it\u2019s sort of,\nwhat is it, we\u2019re going to mix up a whole thing, you know what I mean? So to me it\nwasn\u2019t that far of my name, what -- what good 1s that going to me? And I remained with\nthat name, however, at any time I tell my story, I -- or I file applications, or so, I still refer\nto that my birth name was Zucherman, and -- and my regular name was Zissman, the\nadopted name was Zissman. And it\u2019s -- it became a joke to me. Z-Zissman from German\nmeans sweet, and Zucherman means from sugar. So in other words I always joke the\nsugar became sweeter, that\u2019s why I used the name Zissman, and that was not too far\nfetched, you know what I mean, to do it. So I left it the way it is. So, after, in Lodz,\nmeeting that Shpark, within a couple of days, I was in touched with a for -- with the\nformer fighters of the partisan, and this ma -- people who already had formed the\nZionistic party again, and the option was -- as they -- as it was called, the runners. They\nwere there, tha -- from Hebrew Bricha. Anybody who ran away right now, and looked for\nan identity of where to go, and the -- the -- this -- the whole thing led us, the goal was to\nreach Israel, one way or the other, because we sort of -- no matter how I looked at it,\nEurope was an insecure place, because any country, other than Poland, I found had the\nsame story, Jews were killed. It was only a matter of the percentages. And unfortunately,\nout of the six million, three million were killed in -- in Poland, because they corroborated\nmuch more than the people in other countries did, and -- and that was the results of it. So\nbasically my zeal at that particular time was, end goal, to reach Israel, and I enlisted\nmyself with the illegal party -- not ill -- it\u2019s not the party, it was the part -- the Zionistic\nparty, that they were doing, that helped to help those -- those who ran away, the\nrunaways, sort of, to bring them in this year. And they accepted me, and immediately\nthey made me the head of 10 more guys [indecipherable] and when we came from there,\nwe -- from Lodz, we were sent to Krakow. And from Krakow, which is not too far from\nCzechoslovakia, we came to Czechoslovakia. In Czechoslovakia, the Red Cross, which I\nmet for the first time -- otherwise, during the war, I did not even know that the Red Cross\nexisted, or anything like that. I knew that -- that it existed, but meaning not to speak\nderogatorily about it, there was no such thing wherever the ghettos was, anything to see\nthe sign of a Red Cross, as they should be the -- the -- the people to help the Jews in any\nkind of way. But, so for the first time in Czechoslovakia, I have seen a Red Cross, and\nthey had a kitchen open for many runaways, because people were changing from -- either\nthat they were working in Germany, or they were enslaved for the -- in Germany,\nwhatever it 1s that everybody was returning home. So the traffic back and forth from cu --\nin countries existed, and the Red Cross, at that particular time, was available to give us a\nlittle helping hand. And they made us ID\u2019s, and the destination of that particular time,\nwas to go to Hungary, Budapest, from there. And we were on the train, and I don\u2019t know\nwhat I mentioned that on the train we ran into some drunken Soviet soldiers, you know\nwhat I mean, and that we had -- since we -- I had more partisans with me, so we had to do\nwhat we had to do. And to save our women that we -- were with us, or the whole\noperation, that we were on an illegal way, and we just -- when we were going near a\nriver, we just shoved them down on -- over the -- into the river. I don\u2019t know what it was,\nthe outcome of it, but we were [indecipherable] then the train stopped at Budapest, our\nminds, of the five of us that were there, were really thinking, who knows whether we may\nnot hear a little call, because in Hungary still, the Soviets were occ -- on the occupation at\nthat particular time. But, since 1t was quiet, we went to the community at that time,\nCommunitaes rilita, and there sort of was an encampment for us where to sleep. And for\nthe first time, we organized. The following mor -- day, that a demonstration that we are\ngoing to go to the consulate, which it was over there, British consulate, already in\nexistence, and we made a protest march, declaring that Israel is supposed to become a\nstate, so therefore it could house all it\u2019s refugees, as we were to so many years, driven out\nhistorically from Israel, and is a time of our return to -- back to our homeland, from our\nancestors.",
        "A: I give or take, not coming, because on the train, the whole group consisted of -- were\nover a hundred, but people of runaways that were already there in -- in Budapest at the\ntime, ready to go to Bucharest, because the route at that particular time, called for us to\ngo to Bucharest, Romania. And being that they were ca -- boarding near the ocean, from\nthere we would illegally send them on ships, to go illegally to Palestine, as it was called,\nnot Israel, but Palestine at the time, as it -- as it\u2019s -- historically the name of the area was\ncalled Palestine. So -- but they changed on us in the middle. So to tell you approximately,\nthe demonstration had at least about 200 people, at the event, in rows, orderly. Israeli\nflags were gi -- made to us, and we had inscriptions at that time of saying that -- that\nIsrael should become a state. So it became to me, a new era of life, that all of a sudden,\nwhile I was not going where I\u2019m going, I had some -- I had a goal in my life, I had some -\n- of re-establishing myself. And I felt very good about it, you know? And it was -- the\nmarl thing was good, it -- my wife accompanied me, she did not sort of resist all of this, I\nthink. She was in the same mind and mood, as to what I was doing. So, 1-1t sort of -- now\nI\u2019m not by myself any more, I\u2019m the -- we are two, and sort of it made a little bit my life\neasier, because I no longer was that one person like a stone in the desert. I use that word\nbecause that\u2019s my feelings of the way it used to be. So now we -- we were a team. Just for\nthe sake of it, I don\u2019t know whether I told it in the other, we met our rabbi, who married\nus in her hometown, and he was apart over there to, where we were sleeping on bunk\nbeds, and we were on the top, he was at the bottom, the bunk bed broke, and I almost --\nhe got injured from a nail from that, but not badly. But it was like I said, that little fun\nthat we had to [indecipherable] accidents that had happened. And by that day --",
        "A: In Budapest, yeah. When we were in Budapest, let me describe it to you. Over the\nBuda, there was not a single bridge, only pantoon bridges were left from the army, that\n[indecipherable] to cross over. They started already on -- working on restoring bridges,\nbut that\u2019s how it was. It was fresh after the war, and one could see the difference what it\nwas in Poland, the way it -- it looked like -- there we saw shops, all of a sudden, you can\ngo in and shop. So what I didn\u2019t see in Boronivitch, or I didn\u2019t see back in Poland, even --\nyou know what I mean, the whole thing was in markets, outdoor markets, it was in Lddz,\nor in Bialystok in the same way. Here, I saw an organized thing like this here, that wa --\nsure it was destroyed the Buda, you know, but the civilian housing was not damaged as\nbadly to say. And in -- say there were apartments, and people were shoppers, there was\nmarket. All of a sudden, we were given at that particular time, salamis and everything to\ntake with us, after they changed us route not to go to Bucharest, but to go to Gratz. And\nthe fun part was in Gratz was different orders. We were going -- our documents make --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: -- and the -- th-the most -- most likely was to cross over to the English zone, but the\nSoviets still were there. So we told the supplies, the food supplies that were given to us to\ntake to that hotel, we coming to that hotel, we turn it into the kitchen, and then we had to\nworry about food for ourselves to eat. Something else happened in that hotel, which I do\nnot know what I said to the other -- on the other tape, but I -- let\u2019s forget what I said on\nthe other tape, I want to tell it now, because that was very important. We came in there,\nand that was the English zone. We were -- we were told that 1f we ever go through to the\nEnglish zone, we must be very polite and quiet. And as we were going to the hotel, our\norders were we only go in groups of two and three, and nobody is to speak at all, if\npossible. If you do speak, manage to speak German. If you do not speak German, you\nmust speak another language, sort of, because we would be going there as we are\nAustrian Jews. Therefore, Austrian Jews returning back from concentration camp,\ntherefore it would have been no questions asbay cause at the time, the police there, when\nit was, shied away from all of these things, sort of as to wash themselves of all the\natrocities against the Jews they did. Anyways, we came to a hotel, and for the first time, I\nmet there in the hotel, a representative from the American Joint Committee, which they\nwere there to help the refugees. I also met a party faithful over there, and I brem -- I\nremember he -- Pinhaus was his name, he was with red hair. So, between the two of\nthem, that was the command. In other words, the Zionist side, the American aide side,\nand so on.",
        "A: Committee, yeah, that they were, that particular time, already there in that hotel. We\ngo into that hotel, we were housed where we should go, and before long I meet up over\nthere a guy who was a guide, and he was with us in the forest, the partisans. In a way it\nwas aray of sunshine, you know? Lusek, I speak to him -- and I hear that he\u2019s guiding --\nI ask him first, I was -- wanted to go, ready with my group, I still kept the group, sort of\nlike the 10, that we work together, as I said, to begin. I was their leader, or commander, if\nyou want to call it. He says, \u201cHarold, you and Sonia, you got to wait a little while.\nThey\u2019 Il tell you when your turn comes.\u201d And before long, since we made ourselves\nknown that we are former partisans, fighters over there, we get an order that we are going\nto go, and we were told we are going to go to come to the river Moore, which it was a\nfast river, but a narrow one, and we are to cross that river, and on the other side of that\nriver, we will immediately -- immediately enter to the English zone. Myself, being a\nplatoon commander before, and the other guys being partisans, when we hear assignment\nlike this here, we did not ask any questions whatsoever. We were given tickets to take the\ntrain, and we were to go from Gratz to Klagenford. And in Klagenford we were given the\ndirections to go to the river, and there -- but we were told, don\u2019t go like you\u2019re marching,\ngo like normal, two people again together. But when you come to the river, immediately I\nfind out that in my group there were a few guys who could swim, and a few guys who\ncouldn\u2019t swim at all. And we were with women and men together. I decided that once we\ncome there, to form a chain. [Il lead the group first, I was a swimmer, and my wife was\nnext, which she was not a swimmer, and that\u2019s how I made the chain to be. So, by the\ntime we stretch across, even with a little bit of paddling with our hands, we\u2019 ll be able to\nreach almost the other side. So swimming was not to be very far. All of a sudden, a\ngalloping horse is heard, and a commanding officer, was in Soviet gear, comes over, he a\n-- makes [indecipherable] to stop, and of all people, he asks us question what we are\ntrying to do, we are telling him we\u2019re trying to swim in the river. You know what I mean?\nBut of course we did not have any bathing suit on, or anything like that, we are now\ncivilian, and we didn\u2019t have any problems what -- that\u2019Il get wet [indecipherable]. And of\nall the things, he arrests me. He arrests me, now of all things in the world, I\u2019m an escapee\nfrom the Soviet Union, and from the KGB, and now, I finally, at the mement -- the\nmoment of re-liberation, I should fall back? But I had no alternative, he immediately he\nhad two more on horses with him, and -- and he\u2019s already got a little squad, sort of, and I\nhave none to say. Anyway, the rest of the group, with my wife together, go back, and\nthey decided to get in contact, now again with the hotel in there, and telling them of what\nhad transpired, and they just -- and they told that they\u2019re sending out immediately,\nsomebody who is going to handle the case, and take it over. Sure enough, within the nec -\n- by the next day, I immediately am taken to the jail, and in the jail, all the questions and\nanswers that they gave me, was that I wanted to go to Klagenford, and my aim was to go\nfurther away in Italy, and I -- whichever I mentioned the name, they says, \u201cWell, you\ndon\u2019t have to worry about it, we\u2019ll send you there.\u201d But being -- working for the KGB,\nand knowing them from the time that I know before the war, when we were -- were in\ntheir zone, I knew that when the Soviets tell you you gonna go to one place, you may\nwind up in Siberia until you get there. So I did not have my trust in that system, and I was\nreally scared, but what could I do? I was -- no way for me to break out, I did not have in -\n- any money, or anypla -- anything at all. So I figured I got to wait for time, and see what\nis going to be. By the next day, it looks like somebody came from there, a courier, and it\nlooks like they had money, and they knew how to bribe Soviet officials at that particular\ntime, and they paid up, [indecipherable] for my freedom, and they let me out. When we\ncame back to the hotel, I organized my 10 guys, immediately I posted to each door\nexceeding that hotel, I says, \u201cEverybody stay, as the guy told me that nobody\u2019s going to\ngo out. Whoever is going to come in, you\u2019ll know. Because we are not going to let -- be\nmistreated. We, because we were former fighters, are not going to be let into another\nsituation like that. Josef Lusek is the name of the guy. The way he takes the other, we are\ngoing, and they\u2019re going to take us tonight, not tomorrow.\u201d I came in with an ultimatum\nto the office, and I told them, I says, \u201cI have guards in all the exits from my guys,\nnobody\u2019s going to go out.\u201d I says, \u201cYou dealing with former partisans. And remember,\nour ch -- our duty did not finish as yet, we are not in Israel as yet, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re\naiming to be. I\u2019m not going to let you guys play with our lifes any longer. Nobody is\ngoing out of the hotel tonight.\u201d And I spoke -- meanwhile, Lusek comes over, he tried to\ncalm me down, and he says, \u201cHarold, I know your wife from days past, before I knew\nyou. Ill take you,\u201d -- my wife, I says, \u201cNever mind to all of these here things, \u201cMy group\ngoes with you, and you are going to be responsible for all of us. If anything foul plays\n[indecipherable] remember, we are not going to remain silent. You know us from the\nforest.\u201d",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: They were involved just like we refugees, who looking to go forward to Israel.\nHowever, there were people with money, people who went smuggling while I was\nworking with idealism, and they were mi -- Black Marketeering, and they already got so\nmany -- made money, and about it, and ma -- and you know, it was payola, immediately\nwent into existence at that particular time. And I found it out quickly, and this is where I\nmade a point, I banged the table in the -- in the office, and I told him, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not going\nto go on like that. I speak for my group. I\u2019m their leader, and that\u2019s what 1s gonna be.\nAnd tonight, if any plans you have about leaving any group, I don\u2019t care who the others\nare, we are going,\u201d and Lusek, he was -- I called him into -- be in presence, so I says,\n\u201cYou know. You the leader, and you the guide, but command, I will have. I and my wife\nwill be -- ride next to you and your wife.\u201d She was there, too. And remember, there will\nbe no foul play. So he told us, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to enter a barn. In that barn in the mountains\nover there, 1s where the Soviets [indecipherable] are there, we have to bribe him, we have\nto pay him -- pay him off, and therefore they\u2019 Il let the group go through.\u201d And he warned\nus, \u201cThey will -- they probably may body search you, and if they find anything of value,\nthey might take it away, they may liquidate it. Don\u2019t make a resistance, because\notherwise you\u2019ll spoil the whole operation.\u201d I really did not have much, but at the same\ntime, a ring f -- we had from my father and mother, we had a watch, and so on. So my\nwife, what she did, she had some yarn, you know what I mean, for knitting a sweater, so\non. So she took some of the valuables, made a ball out of it, you know what I mean,\nwrapped it inside, so in a way we figured that what so. Then we came to that barn, like\nyou said, anyways -- I rushed a little bit too fast. They accepted my -- what I dema -- my\ndemands, and my group was going with that -- the whole group together must have been\nabout another 20 people, so we were a big column, and when we came to that barn, like I\nsaid, which he explained that to us, we started -- they started to body search us, you know\nwhat I mean, and so on. So happened that to my group, nobody had any valuables, really,\nto worry about. We did not try to acquired it in that time that we were involved with. But,\nthere were some people who had to pay off, you know, give this, and we became\nknowledgeable before watid. Now, we already on the other side of the barn, and we\u2019re\nane on the English zone, physically. We walked for --",
        "A: You still have that?",
        "A: Okay, so not --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Ask me any questions, and I\u2019Il answer them.",
        "A: Yes?",
        "A: Well, the only thing was it was so new a thing that it never existed before. Later on I\nfound out that these type of marches existed also in Romania, and perhaps in other\nsources. But it was totally new to us, and it was totally new in Budapest for something\nlike that to happen. Absolutely we must say that later on, you know, I\u2019ve told -- we are\ntalking right now about 1945, you know it -- Israel didn\u2019t become a state til 1948, but you\nknow that in the intervening years, of these three years, a lot of demonstrations of that\ntype begin to happen, be in Europe, be in 1s -- be in isra -- not Israel, but Palestine, or in\nthe United States of this same way, until the resolution finally came to pass, that Israel\nwas granted statehood. So I mean, it was -- perhaps it -- I di -- cannot claim that it was --\nwe were the beginners of that, but be -- because later I found out that similar things went\non. So I don\u2019t want to go ahead to take a first eenadida, but it was a first in Budapest,\nwhere it should happen.",
        "A: Absolutely, as in my former tape, I said I was -- since childhood, and in the school I\ngraduated, Yaven in Poland, Zionism was imbedded in me. I -- I had to hide it through\nHitlerite times, and I had to hide it in the time of the Soviet\u2019s occupation, which it was --\nI know they called it liberation, but let\u2019s -- let -- let it be for history to judge, whether it\nwas occupational, or it was liberation. But inside, that spark lit up, at that particular time\nin L\u00e9dz. No sooner I met up in -- you know, in found that former shamring, you know\nwhat I mean? Which it was _ that it was shameratsyer, that 1t was a youth organization\nbelonging to the Zionist organization, and that spark kept through me, it was the new\nthing, just like it was the thing for getting out of the ghetto, and become a resister, and\nfight the Nazis, this is how it was, the new fighting that 1t became in me, and I assume in\nthe rest of the guys that are war with me, because when people resorted themselves to go\non train -- to a -- rooftops, and on the steps to go with -- wi-with -- with [indecipherable]\non their shoulders, and speeds of the trains maybe 70 - 80 miles an hour, maybe 60, t-\ntimes 50, doesn\u2019t matter the speed. But it was dangerous, it was a dangerous mission to\ndo. But it was a goal in our hearts imbedded, that we must go to see for freedom and\nliberty for ourselves, someplace where we could be safe from annihilation, and so on.",
        "A: Pll tell you that, because it was deception in the party. While I was working in Italy,\nsending illegals away, and one day I came telling them that my wife became pregnant.\nWhen I told them about the news, they say -- and I want to go with my group, illegals,\nthey says, \u201cNo, Harold, you stay here on the point, you\u2019re doing very good, and we are\nexpecting to get legal passage. We will send you the first thing -- you know what I mean,\nfor legal passage.\u201d I succumbed to that, because to me it sound very real, the words that\nthey were telling me, an-and I was -- what we were doing in the kibbutzim is preparing\nthem for Israel, and so on. However, the day came, and the free passage, as we called\nthem, certificates at that particular time became -- and I come to Rome, to find out what\u2019s\ngoing on, I hear that as they were passing out certificates to some people, but all of a\nsudden, I came and I asked my man in charge, \u201cWhat happened to me, and my wife?\u201d He\nsays, \u201cWell, there wasn\u2019t enough this time, but we expect pretty soon to have more.\u201d And\nat that particular time, you know, it was already -- of course, she was not -- she probably\nmust have been -- give or take at that particular time, maybe in her fifth month, you\nknow, because I\u2019m -- I\u2019m not counting at this time the times. I came the second time to\nRome, when the next batch of certificates came, and all of a sudden, people begin to\nlaugh at me. They s-say, \u201cOh, Harold, you don\u2019t want to go to Israel any more, you trying\nto go to America.\u201d You deceived the Zionist organization. And I felt really, in my heart,\nthat somebody put me down too low, it was too much. So then I said to my commanding\nofficer, \u201cI'll tell you, I\u2019m resigning my post. I am going to register to go for Israel -- for\nUnited States, instead of going to Palestine.\u201d At that particular time, they start pleading\nwith me, \u201cOkay, if you want to go to Palestine, fine, but we still want you to go on a no --\na kibbutz near Rome.\u201d Where -- that story is printed in one of the books that -- for my --\none of my men, who was in my platoon, his name was Kigernovitch, Moshe\nKigernovitch, and he described part of that stor -- that story. He pleaded with me at that\ntime to write the [indecipherable] personal thing that I wrote in my manuscript, but I was\nnot ready and I couldn\u2019t try it. At that particular time I was not ready to sit down and\nwrite my life\u2019s story. That\u2019s why I refused, but h -- I have -- he recorded it with my\npicture, and him, and acknowledging that I was_ the comoon -- platoon commander, or\ncommandeers ruddid, way they say it in -- in Russian. And it\u2019s in his book. Unfortunately\nthe book is only written in Yiddish, and it never been translated, because he is writing not\njust about the forest where we were, he is writing about a lot of other forests, the\npartisans, Jewish partisans existed, because he wanted for historical sake, to acknowledge\nthat Jews did fight in the partisans, and Jews participated in resistance, okay? So, at that\nparticular time, as we are right now which you asking me the question, I had Zionism in\nme, but it was dormant for these years, because I had to, but as soon -- the sooner -- it got\nignited very easily, they -- somebody did not have to sort of hit me, and to say, \u201cHey\nHarold, what are you doing?\u201d I was right there, and I was willing to risk, in those days,\nmy life. So therefore, when he put me down, I says, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to sway things to\nsend others to go illegally,\u201d which it was a lot of hardship with going through illegally.\n\u201cAnd I am going to s -- go to America. So therefore, I\u2019m resigning, and that\u2019s all.\u201d I\ntherefore enlisted myself at that time to come to Florence, Italy, which I joi -- I -- I lived -\n- what you sa -- everything 1s told, until I came to Italy, until the United States. So, you\nprobably know the story, the way we were taken out of the camp there, and we were put\nit into DP camps in Italy, and then I, instead of being in a camp, was then out of the\ncamp, and I worked with the illegal elleah, which it was kibbutzim, and I was the leader\nthere, and train them, and descend them. And like I say, at that time, when I said that,\nthey say, \u201cHarold, you can go the next time with next group we are sid -- we are\nshipping, and you can go with them.\u201d I says, \u201cAre you for real, or you just trying to?\u201d I\nsays, \u201cMy wife entered already the sixth month.\u201d I says, \u201cIn the sixth month of pregnancy\nyou ask me to -- I should go ahead to gamble with the lives of two, my wife and the\nbaby?\u201d I says, \u201cNo, I cannot do that. Therefore, I refuse, and\u201d -- and that\u2019s how I wound\nup in Florence, Italy, and I came in there, and started to write to my family. My mother\nhad a sister here, and three brothers, and I wrote to them, and we started a whole new\nthing about it, because until now, all the letters that I sent to America, never send them a -\n- an address, but [indecipherable] address. I used to drive my aunt crazy. She heard from\nme, and she did not know where she can correspond with me. But at that particular time,\nwhen we came to Florence, we in -- stop -- we established writing through the army post,\nunival, and -- because the regular post was still not operating too much. And -- and this is\nwhere my decision was reached that I\u2019m going to go to the -- to the USA. Being in the\nUSA, my Zionism again did not change, I still remained a Zionist, and as soon we landed,\nI hardly made a living, but I immediately joined -- we had at that particular time, the new\ncitizen club. It was an organization and a club. And we used to meet -- have meetings,\nsometimes to raise money for our cause of existence, people would have dances, or raffle\ntickets or so on, the usual way. And again, it imbued in me anew, I\u2019m a Zionist, even --\nand someday -- I didn\u2019t at that particular time talk about going to Israel, when you\nalready have a child in the United States, and f -- we came in \u201948, March 14. 22 months\nold then my daughter was. And the next year, 1949, in September, my son 1s born. So I\nwas -- looks like too busy with having children instead of talking about operational way\nto go to Israel.",
        "A: No, it was not the crucial, it was the helping point. You must remember the\nimportance. I did not have money, I did not have means. We were living -- after I entered\nin Florence, we were living under the help from the UNRRA, the United Nations Relief\nOrganizations, that they -- but we formed the kibbutz. So, in other words, I want to\nexplain it, as I said a little before. My Zionism was still there. Again, we form a kibbutz,\neven in that, while we\u2019re waiting to go to America. I still have pictures to prove that, with\nthe name of the kibbutz, and in Florence, and I was -- I have the pictures to prove I was\nspeaking about Zionism, and how we must do. Although I was going to America, but the\nsupport for Israel, I never -- it stopped being a -- a dire participant belonging, even\nthough today, and all through the years since 1953, I\u2019m a member of the B\u2019nai Brith. But\nI\u2019m still a Jew who belongs to the Zionist causes and so on. And it\u2019s not just belonging in\nperson, but with my pocket also, you know what I mean? The Israeli bonds that I\u2019m\nbuying, or to charitable events that you know, where you -- you give charity to these\nhere. So, all of these here, because I changed to bad leadership, at that particular time, so\nmy route did change, but inside of me, my heart did not change a little bit, and I remained\nof the same way. So now, when I came to Chicago, and I must make it -- I went to high\nschool -- I went to one of the best high schools at the time that it was, it was in Austin\nHigh. And not to tell you the story, as a fact, it\u2019s not a story, within three semesters I\nmade American high school. At the same time, looks like the principal says to me, how\ncome I\u2019m not going to go to college now, because I was working at night. And I want you\nto understand, I made a point there. At six o\u2019clock in the morning, I used to get up, take a\nstreetcar to go to work -- of course, I did not have a car, as yet. And from s -- from the\nstore I used to go to school, which it was a streetcar, as we called it at that time, going all\nthe way to school. Do my homework at that time, going there. School would start at\nabout eight o\u2019clock, to 10 at night, two hours, and it was regular school. Of course, it was\ngrownups, so you had a lot of homework to be given, and certain thing would be done at\nschool, such as reading, or on the blackboard to the big [indecipherable] like the -- the\nkids [indecipherable] today. And I would come home, the earliest was 11 0\u2019clock at\nnight. My wife and kids were asleep, so my dinner, sort of like I said, was grabbing a bite\nin the store. I was working at that time 1n a grocery store for a brother of my mother\u2019s,\nmy uncle. And that\u2019s what it was, my routine. So between six in the morning, til the 11,\nor 11:30 at times, that was working, and then working with my head, and working so\nhard, but I established -- so like I said to the principal, I says, \u201cI -- by all means, I\u2019d love\nto go further myself in college,\u201d which I never did, unfortunately, but my kids did, so I\u2019m\nhappy that I did -- was a good father to my children. And I didn\u2019t complain or anything\nlike that, and I had wa -- it was a challenging thing that I could achieved, to know how to\nread, and to know how to write, and you know, and that\u2019s what -- and in the meanwhile,\nthis -- we are talking about 1949, where my son is born. By 1953, I mastered all that I had\nin me, to sit down and write my manuscript, which of course, I to -- 1t took me a year, and\n-- and a nervous breakdown afterwards, because when I speak about these things, even\nnow, I am not here with you in the good USA, I\u2019m there, where it was. I\u2019m there time, the\nway it was. And thanks God that I can control my emotions today better than I could in\nthose years past, because it was too fresh an issue, and my thing was record, and to tell\nfor posterity.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Separate things.",
        "A: I was in the administration, there was no specific titles. We were in Modena, which --\nit was a camp from the former military academy, where we got in one day only from\nMauthausen, Austria, they got in trucks, and unloaded human cargo, just like it was\nregular cargo of something else, because they did not look like humans. And in that big\ncrowd, of all these people, of 5,000, from one truck that they unload them, and we are\nstaying there on the sidewalk. That was -- and please let me correct it for the recod -- it\nwas still in Bolognia, we afterwards came to Modena. We\u2019re standing on the outside, we\nhave nothing more than blankets or anything like that. When my wife points at me, she\nsays, \u201cHarold, look, this man is my uncle\u2019s brother.\u201d I said, \u201cCareful, how -- are you\nsure?\u201d The man was swollen, you know what I mean, and so on. We -- we come near,\nand she says to him, \u201cIsn\u2019t your name,\u201d she says, \u201cyou know, Laserovitchasun?\u201d And he\nlooks, a-and sort of somebody says something to me, he was not talk himself. He says,\n\u201cDon\u2019t you have a brother Misha Mandel, he\u2019s my uncle?\u201d You know, and we got from\nthere. We kept company with him throughout, because from there we were ordered to go\nto Modena, and we were housed in the military academy, that\u2019s\u2019 where they made a\ncamp. People were sleeping on the floors, laying. It was just like sardines. But somehow\nor other, there was no protests. The biggest protest what we had, that we had a camp right\nnext door to us, housing former Nazis, in there -- which it was some SS with them, and so\non. And every day it used to start a rumbling, with stones, bottles, or anything like that to\nthese Nazis. The MP would come -- the American MP would come to quelch it. And we\ntold him, \u201cIf you want it to be quiet, either you move us to another place, or you move\nthem away, because we will not remain,\u201d -- to us, it was a lie that we didn\u2019t care if\nsomebody will be arrested, or anything like that. But to look at a Nazi face on, that was\nsomething that we could not let our minds to say, \u201cOh, it was yesterday, it was a war.\u201d\nBecause we knew the first thing, if these guys would have been on the -- this side of the\nfence, not the other, they would be more than happy to kill the -- us again, you know\nwhat I mean, because it was imbued in their lives. It was not that they seeked revenge\nbecause of some, there was no because. That\u2019s what it was, the training that they got.\nFinally, within a few days, the camp was moved, with the SS, and we remained in that\ncamp. Now, that camp was a mixture of youth, middle aged people, pregnant, sick and\nthe biggest thing being in the administration, what we were seeking for help. The army,\nof course, provided us at that particular time, I must say, with blankets, and so on,\nbecause they couldn\u2019t rebuild it -- the -- the military academy, but they gave us help.",
        "A: The US army. The US army was stationed in Florence, in -- not in -- not Florence, I\nmean in -- in Modena at that particular time. There was also the -- part of the British\narmy, which it was attached to them, which the Israeli part was a part of them, too, and\nthey were the ones, as I mentioned, brought us into Italy from Austria, and it was also\nover there, a part of the Polish -- a -- a Polish -- a part of the Polish army, which it was\nalong with the Britain. So we had at least one thing, since we didn\u2019t speak Italian at that\nparticular time. But we could speak Hebrew to these here, we could speak Polish to the\nother soldiers, and they all were, in a way, I must confess, they were all trying to help us\none way or the other, but when we [indecipherable] on it for anything and everything,\nlooks like the patience va -- to say be patient was not the right answer. And I, being in\nthe administration, had the opportunity to see a person from the jewi -- Joint Distribution\nCommittee, but she was in an English -- a British uniform. How that came about, or what\n-- that she was not with the American army, I don\u2019t know. I cannot go into details. And\nshe came to the -- to our place where we would meet, and she asked us the question, what\ncould we help you? And I asked her at that time, I said, \u201cWhere should I start?\u201d So\ntherefore, I'll start and tell you. We have here young people, at the ages of about 14 - 15 -\n16. You got to remember, these people were taken to the camps, as -- as kids. Now they\nare teenagers. Through the -- through the -- if anybody was 10 years of age, you got to\nimagine he is now -- I says -- we -- we -- we encountered venereal disease in there\nmeans, because it was open prostitution in Italy, you know, on the street. But these kids\ndid not know, you know what I mean, any better, they were not brought -- I says, \u201cSo\ntherefore, I\u20191l make my biggest request to you, let\u2019s take the kids out of the camp.\u201d And\nbefore long, which again I have pictures to prove you -- that point, if at any time you\ninterested, but since we are doing it just for -- on a tape like that, but if you would be\ninterested, I will be more than happy to supply with copies of the pictures, where, at this\nparticular time, the Palestine brigade, or the Jewish brigade, as it was called, which it was\nattached to the British fifth army, came in to help, not the Joint Distribution Committee,\nand with their trucks, which you will see on the pictures, Ill -- Il show them to you\nafterwards, which with their trucks, we took the kids, and we shi-shipped them out to a\nseparate camp to make a camp, where they could be tended to the needs those youngsters\nwere needing, and they were the first ones to be shipped even illegally to Israel, by means\nthat we were not even aware of how, but they shipped them out, and they gave them the\ntreatment that needed. The next thing was we send --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: All the others, the grownups, who remained on the waiting list, or what it may become\nlater, some of them were integrated through the parties, because I must confess, the party\nsystem immediate -- immediately began ... immediately the parties began, even it was\ncamp life, and there was the Revisionist party, the a -- the Ashumer party, in other words\nmeaning Jharbortinsky\u2019s party to the right, and it was to the middle, and to the left. And it\ncould be visible to those of us who were working in the administration, and to those of us\nwho were organized, that it was immediately my people, your people, and so on. But it\u2019s\none thing I must confess. The harmony for the good of the cause existed. It was not an\nopen bipartisan, it not -- b-but it was bipartisan. Everybody understood the need of the\ntime, and so on. From there, it started to group out, from the big camp there. The\nkibbutzim, it started at that time. I at that particular time joined a seminar which -- it was\nnear Milano, and there were instructions to be taught to us. Professor -- there was a\nprofessor over there, I gotta thi -- I gotta think of his name.",
        "A: Garfinkel. Oh, you know already [indecipherable]",
        "A: You know my story about it. \u2019'm glad that you\u2019re aware about my story. Yeah,\nProfessor Garfinkel, he was a light to us, explaining and teaching us, and a lot of these\nthings went into our head very well. Even though, at that particular time, I did not think\nof anything else but Ashumer, meaning the party to the left, as I started in the youth\norganization. I couldn\u2019t help it, I was with them, and I could sense in that seminar, that\nthat seminar was orchestrated by my party, or so -- and I mean -- in other words, the party\nto the left. So --",
        "A: Well [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, I can tell you that much. Being 1n that -- s -- you can call that a camp, in the\nmilitary academy\u2019s building that we were, that was a camp. To see what Hitler did to our\npeople is -- Pll describe it in plain. There wasn\u2019t a night passing by without 1n the middle\nof the night that it would start almost like a regular riot. Kapo, you heard an outcry kapo,\nmeaning, a kapo is the German name for the leader of a group. And these leaders were\nthe ones who were smiten -- smiting the Jews, and punishing the Jews. The Hitlerites\nalways got a double pleasure, to see when a Jew hits another Jew, you know? And in the\nmeanwhile, those people who recognize it, we had to call in the MP\u2019s, and it was a\nterrible, terrible situation to keep. That\u2019s why we realized we gotta break the camp away\nfrom it, but the entire camp feeling, which you ask me, I did not know this. And to say\nthat in Israel it was a feeling against them, no. If 1t was a feeling against them, it was\namong people -- in other words, between camp leaderships and so on. What per -- say to\ngeneralize that, I couldn\u2019t -- I wouldn\u2019t agree on that part at all.\nin the camps, those people who were in the partisans, they were the front lines, who\nimmediately joined from those illegal ships, when the war broke out in Israel, be that it\nwas not fully recognizable, but in 1948, when Israel got status as a state of Israel, at that\nparticular time, you saw yesterday\u2019s camp inmates, yesterday\u2019s people who came from\nhiding, or they were fighting 1n the partisans. As I me -- forementioned before, there was\na bipartisan way, and it was no discrimination going on here. Yes, there was a\ndiscrimination at the time that it happened 1n Israel, bipartisan, with that ship that it blew\nup in ammunition, and so on. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard about it, but that is not my time,\nor my story here to talk about it, that is already recorded. But Esterburg say, you resisted,\nor didn\u2019t resisted, was sort of a question mark 1n a school level, or otherwise, and that\ngoes on til this day. When I come to Israel, I was there only about a year and a half ago,\nand the same thing so many years afterwards, when I wa -- came into the kibbutz what\nthe partisans have over there, and I could find a lot of the -- m-my name is 1n there, and a\nmatter of fact, I\u2019m sending them, I didn\u2019t finish, a -- a biography in short -- my biography\nin short, it will be about 10 pages, so they could record it, but I couldn\u2019t s -- s -- find any\nanimosity, or any criticism. It\u2019s just minds that have -- want to know, to fill in the void\nabout how we resisted. Not -- and the other thing, that 1t was resistance. And I still must\ntell you, I know year after year, when I go to the awareness days, when I come here, I\nwas there last month, and I\u2019m going to go again this year in March again. When I talk to\nthese here high school kids, be -- yo-you find -- last time in -- it was the biggest, curious\nthing happened to me is I had a Israeli -- the parents were Israeli, the kid was born in\nIsrael, but he was over here with -- because they moved here. He knew nothing about the\nHolocaust whatsoever. To him was just a novice thing that he just heard it, and especially\nmy telling him that I was in the partisans. I had 10 students around my table, and I think\nit was the most active table in many tables around, not that the other ones didn\u2019t. But\nsomehow or other, it was a curious thing to those who understand. And after all, I\u2019m\ndealing with kids let\u2019s say 15 - 16 years of age, and they know what it is, resistant to -- in\nthe word, to understand. But they had a general view, story is not known. But as soon you\nopen up your mind, the question always comes up, why weren\u2019t there more? Not that I\nwanted more. There was in every country of Europe, let\u2019s for the fact, be Martial Tito in\nYugoslavia, be the French Resistance in -- in France. No matter which country you want\nto name, where resistance existed, there were Jews in there. Were they in the percentages\nthat it should have been, no. However, the public lacks the understanding. First of all, the\nphysical make-up of those people in the ghettos, if they were longer, were not to be able\nto became fighters and resisters. But the Warsaw ghetto proved it, that they did resist, and\nthey did hold for two weeks, much more than the armies in Poland held the Germans\nfrom entering Poland. So, there was resistance in other ghettos besides Warsaw, too. But\nto resist in the way that we joined the resistance of the partisans, of the Soviet partisans,\nor wherever, in the other countries. That is an understanding that we lacked the\norganization, we lacked the willingness of the people involved in it to say come and join\nus. Because it took me a hard time, almost three weeks to find them, and after I found\nthem, my group of four, we had a hard time explaining to the commander that we could\nnot. How do we obtain weapons? Yes, we went on the ambush with them, and that\u2019s how\nthey got weapons, and that\u2019s when it -- and the -- and the majority were good fighters,\namong the top fighters. And I\u2019m talking about the Jewish fighters, not that I\u2019m trying to\nglamorize the situation, but tell the facts for posterity\u2019s sake, that people should know\nabout it. Because we were a fighter who had nothing to lose. The other fighters had a lot\nto lose. They had families, they didn\u2019t want to go to work 1n Germany. So the Belarus,\nfor instance, or those leftover soldiers who didn\u2019t want to wind up in POW camps, they\nwere -- they had a lot to lose, because they had families and everything. But any Jew who\ncame onto the partisans, or to the resistance, remember, his last -- whatever he had he --\nblood in him, or whatever he had power to resist, he resisted, because it was the last fight.\nEvery day was the last fight of his life that he\u2019d been fighting. So it\u2019s understanding that\nthey -- we could be among the ones to be talked about a lot. And unfortunately, so far, it\nisn\u2019t talked enough. You see how hard I told you I have to go ahead to have my\nmanuscript published. There is no takers. Looks like if I was to wrote a novel, which a lot\nof times people told me -- and maybe they\u2019|l encourage me to do, but how in a novel --\nwhere, in a novel it\u2019s fantasy? You don\u2019t necessarily hear the true story about it, but looks\nlike people in a -- buying a novel is easier to sell, or easier, in other words, to sell it to the\n-- to the people responsible for publishing, as well as the public perhaps reading it. Looks\nlike people do not want to read a lot the horror stories what it went on. And again, it was\ndirectly against just a minority, the Jews, for not giving the reason why. So I suppose\nmaybe that has a reason, but for the sake of history, and for the future generation, this\nstory must be told, be inscript -- be -- what we are doing right now, and just tell our\nstories.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: She came in 1929, at the same time when we -- we moved over to another city from\nwhere I was born. And we moved -- the name of that city was Australenka, and I still\nwith my mother, went to the train to say good-bye to her. And she was favorite with me\nwhen I was a child, up to then. You know, I was only seven years of age in 1929. But the\npoint was, to ever she was go out, leave for picnics, whatever it is, I was -- I -- like she\ntook me like -- she loved me -- not at -- like she loved me, she loved me so much that she\nalways was -- the other part about it, from the other nieces and nephew what they had,\nthey were not there, in Poland they were all -- in America, her brothers were already\nbefore that in America. And so she came to America that time. My mother would keep at\nthat time, sort of a promise that I -- we should be in contact. So while my mother was\nwrite, she would go ahead to ask me to write the address to her. So therefore, in my mind,\nit just imbued that I remembered -- I could not even pronounce good in English in those\nyears, the address. But at that address, where she was living in Chicago was so\nmemorized by me, and my few words that I used to write so we can keep contact. So yes,\nshe remembered me as the child when she left Poland. And when I first got in touch with\nher, 1t was the whole story of our lives, you know what I mean? They had to make papers\nthree times, to bring us in, like I was telling you. So what was the reason? At first she\nthought that I\u2019m still single, because I couldn\u2019t write in the letters through that army that\nI\u2019m telling her that I already am married. So they made out immediately papers for me to\ncome. No sooner we got more in touch, they found out that I\u2019m married. So, at that time\nthey made the second papers. The third papers they made th -- because our baby -- our\ndaughter was already born, so that was the reason I had to make three times the papers.\nSo -- some -- some of the data, I mean, was misconstrued, but that 1s -- that 1s a minor\nsituation, we are not going to go into that, that was -- so our love re-establish our -- itself,\nimmediately. However, the other three brothers that they were here, they were much --\nthey were much -- they were in America probably before I was born. So I therefore\ncouldn\u2019t go ahead to remember them, but the first, in Chicago, for instance, we had the --\none of the -- there was originally four, but one of them was already dead. So in Chicago\nwe -- I had two uncles, and my aunt. In Los Angeles I had a third brother, he was the\noldest, which again, none of them, besides my aunt, remembered me as a child in Poland.\nAnd after all they -- I started working later for my uncle, and that was my mother\u2019s\nbrother, he was in the grocery business. And, as I forementioned with going to school,\nthat was the store I was working for, for him. So I know how much further in the story\nthat I told, I do -- over there. I joined again immediately an organization, we called them\nthe new citizens. So, in Chicago, we dwe -- used to have meetings, and like I\naforementioned, and make money f-for existence, and above all, to help Israel, be that it\nwas already -- when the bonds came in existence to be -- the bond drives. Be otherwise --\nambulances to send to Israel, or any of these -- it was basically -- all what we did was\nraising money, and funds through all means, be that it was a dance, be that it was a\ndinner, be it was membership, but it all was -- the idea about it Israel. And all of us were\na bunch together, but again, the story prevailed with me, there were not that many\nfighters, there was all concentration inmates. And we did not have any misunderstanding\nbecause and how and what. And sooner or later we found out, you know what I mean, the\nway it was. I remember when Israel\u2019s sen -- fifth anniversary came, and we had a guy\nfrom the embassy coming to speak to us, and I was on the committee, I always belonged\nsomeplace, and I always didn\u2019t just remain not to belong, or be on the committee or\nwhatever it is, because I cared for it so much. So that man was a former army colonel, I\nbelieve, or so, and he was in the embassy attached. So he comes in, and he says to me, he\nsays, \u201cExplain me a little bit about your group.\u201d Because he was going to have the\nspeech, and he wanted -- he didn\u2019t have the time before to ask the questions. So I tried to\ntell him we were 95 percent of former survivors of the concentration camps, or resistance\nlike Iam. A few that were -- not even five people that are -- were f -- in the resistance.\nHiding maybe, yes, but not in the resistance. So -- and I tried to tell him it\u2019s a make-up of\nvarious participation. He says, \u201c\u201cWhy don\u2019t we belong to a party,\u201d you see, in other\nwords, the party image or curse, maybe I should say, because it\u2019s a curse. If we wouldn\u2019t\nbe so divided, we would have been a stronger nation through the years. Why don\u2019t you\nbelong to one party? I says, \u201cWhat would that help Israel better? We raise money, we do\nall we can to help Israel. And that party, I wish you\u2019d stop being so party minded in\nIsrael, I believe it\u2019d be an easier life.\u201d In contrary, he didn\u2019t like my comments, of course,\nbecause he said, \u201cWhy do you want to be orphans?\u201d In other words, belonging to a party\nmeant not being an orphan in his mind, and in his view. And he came speaking to us,\nwhich he was not aware enough what had went on during the Holocaust, because my\ncritic to the time and the era was as -- in my writings, I -- I must mention it to you, there\nisn\u2019t a year that I don\u2019t write to the newspaper, at least in a folder about an inch thick, and\nI have all of them of -- of home. And I\u2019m a critic of some of these here things. I will\nalways try to defend Israeli causes, and Jewish causes, of -- of the -- of course, you know\nwhat I mean, like I said, I didn\u2019t want to give up Judaism in spite of Hitler, and I believe\nthat whenever I think about it, I\u2019m -- \u2019'm more for than I was before ba -- myself, even if\nI\u2019m not in Israel. But I visited Israel a number of occasions. I received a medal like\nholmor of the partisans who were there, when we came to Israel in 1983, then we had a\ngathering of all the fighters. And I have over here at har -- at home -- it\u2019s too bad that we\ncannot take another picture. I was honored as a partisan over here, too, 1n -- 1n -- in Fort\nLauderdale, a number of years ago. So, I been a constant participant in all of Jewish\ncauses, no matter what it is. I will always belong somewheres, and I will always speak\nmy mind whenever I can, and whenever I\u2019ve reached out. So like I say, it was born at that\nparticular time, even when I came to the United States, and we formed the organization. I\nwas in the starter, but it already was in existence. We called it the New Citizen\u2019s Club, as\nI aforementioned. We used to have once a month a meeting, and so on and so far. So,\nthen it came out the story, which I don\u2019t know whether I mentioned inforn, where the\nNazis wanted to march in Skokie.",
        "A: Okay, so I'll wait for your questions.",
        "A: Well, my journey in the united -- to the United States, was basically at the time, that I\nhad family, and I thought that they would be of help for me to get organized, and settled.\nAnd I believe it\u2019s a little personal about it, and I do not want to be -- feel that it\u2019s a\npersonal way. I didn\u2019t get the help I expected to help, although the family each other --\nhelped each other when they came, so with me, when they spend the money, and other\nmoney came from my wife\u2019s family that she had in New York. I believed that when I\nwanted to get established to go in business, which I did, I came to \u201948, and in 1953 in\nJanuary, I went to business to open up a grocery store. And I must thank the Almighty,\nwho let my wife\u2019s father -- my father-in-law survive, and he was with us in the forest,\ntoo. And if he wouldn\u2019t lend me that time the money, I would not be in business, you\nknow? So while I came to the family for help, I didn\u2019t get the help I wanted to get. Not\nthat I need -- I wanted the help to give out -- even to loan me the money, I wasn\u2019t --\nbecause you must remember, I had no collateral. I had no -- no way in the world to\nestablish credit, and I wanted to go in business. One of my uncles, may he rest in peace,\nsays, \u201cSince you got off the boat, you wanted to go in business.\u201d I said, \u201cI thought it\u2019s a\ncapitalistic system in the United States, that to go to business 1s okay.\u201d But like I say, I do\nnot wish at this time in my recording to leave the animosity about that, but I seek to come\nhere because of them. The turnout was that I would have been helped with the Joint\nDistribution Committee much more if I would not have been there. The mere fact of\ngoing to school, if I would have been getting help from the Joint Distribution Committee,\nI probably would have been able to maintain to go to college. This way I did not have any\ninsurance, and my son was supposed to be born, beforehand to have some money,\nbecause I did not have insurance for the pregnancy insurance, I had to acquire another\njob. While I was working at my uncle\u2019s store, fi -- six days a week, I had to get a job to\nwork in a tavern, which it was -- he was in partnership with -- with his other part of the\nfamily. So I used to work there Thursday night, or rather, some weeks Thursday night,\nFriday night, Saturday night, because all those days I worked in a store. And Sunday I\nused to come, after closing the store 12 o\u2019clock, I used to go home, rest up, get something\nto eat. At fi -- at six o\u2019clock I would be back to work to work til 12. And this is how I\naccumulated the extra money that I needed for my son to be born in that hospital. I\nwanted here to give a plug to a person who really -- talking about the family. My family\nwent to their gynecologist at that particular time, and asked him to take charge of my\nwife. And then they asked them, \u201cWhy do you ask me to give them a break? You\u2019re the\nfamily, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m a doctor. I took care of all of you.\u201d And he was very feeling low, in\nother words, for them asking, however -- may he rest in peace, he\u2019s no longer around, he\nsaid he\u2019ll do the work free of charge. And he was a renowned gynecologist in Chicago,\non Michigan Avenue, which the price was pretty high. But as a gesture of his own, he\nwent and did -- because my wife had to have Caesarian section, she had a letter with it --\nwith her from the fir -- from my daughter was born, she had by Caesarian section, she\ncouldn\u2019t have it any other way. So he gave -- he only told us, you cannot go through the\nclinic, you must go through the regular channels, because through the clinic they may not\nhave me doing the surgery, and I wanted him to do the surgery at that particular time.\nAnd when I -- after my son was born, when I came to the office with my wife for a visit, I\nbrought a -- a -- a bunch of roses, at that time he yelled at me. \u201cI thought you can\u2019t afford\nit, and that\u2019s why I helped you. Why did you have to spend the money on the flowers?\u201d\nSo he was really a righteous type of a person, which I always remember, and I -- and\nBlumenfeld, I-I think was his name, and -- it is name. And he was not Jewish, he was a\nGentile. So in other words, I like always, for posterity\u2019s sake, to remember that there\nwere always some people in cl -- even if they were not Jews, they were Gentiles, but they\nwere generous. That\u2019s why we have in Israel, the Righteous Gentile\u2019s walk. And\nwhenever I\u2019m in Yad Vashem, I go through that, to read names and so on. At a time\nwhen I was honored here, there was a Righteous Gentile, was honored to the same time, a\nwoman who saved seven Jews. Of course, instead of the whole eyes of the audience\nwould go to my case, as being a platoon commander on the partisans, she was deservedly\nso, which I understand, after all, she saved seven Jews, being a Gentile, and she got, sort\nof the place, much more than me. And so like I say, so many things that happened\nthrough that era, afterwards, even though to some people, it\u2019s a novice story, because\nthey didn\u2019t hear enough of the resistance. But whenever it gets ex-exposed, I can tell --\nsay that much with a full mouth, that people understand it, and they\u2019re eager to hear about\nit more and more. So I can only hope and pray someday that my manuscript should be\npublished, and people should be able to read it in a more detailed way, the way all of that\nhorror went through, and how victory came, that I survived.",
        "A: By ship, yeah.",
        "A: Yes, yes, I\u2019ll tell you the whole thing. You want me on?",
        "A: Okay, it was a little problem since usually, when we applied to come, and we had the\nvisa already to go to the United States, the Joint, at that particular time wanted to\nintervene to help some of the people, and I thought Ill go through them, too, while their -\n- my relatives needed help in one way or the other. Anyways, they wanted to give me\npassage, and where did they find the passage? On a Soviet ship. And I refused take him --\nto go with a Soviet ship, because basically, as I aforementioned, I didn\u2019t trust the Soviets,\neven they should have been on a journey taking me to y -- to the United States. So I\nrefused to go passage. And you know, visas have a certain expiration times, I couldn\u2019t\nplay around with much. The passage available until my expiration of the visa was so --\nwas very little choices to be made, besides that Russian ship. So I was told by them that\nthe only way for me to go would be best to meet the visa time that I have to go by air, to\nfly to the United States. And I did not -- I was not at that particular time ready with\nflying. Therefore, we had to -- I had -- I had to -- I could get passage on the Vulcania,\nwhich it was going to meet the date. However, the Vulcania had only opening on second\nclass, as you know, they have always grades of classes. It was normally with third class,\nbut they had second class only open passage for us to go, everything else was booked up.\nSo I had to go to the family, both time [indecipherable] my wife family, and my family to\n-- about the passage. And sure enough, they wired the money, so we could get the\npassage to go on that ship, on the Vulcania. The Vulcania was a luxury vessel, there is no\nquestion about it, and especially riding on second class was another thing that I did not\nknow how to take it, because with all the misery of life that we went through -- in Italy it\nwas better, but it still was not like living in apartment and a -- enjoying, you know what I\nmean they -- everything a human beings are ma -- ine -- are desire -- not only that they\nwant to, but they\u2019re entitled to have. So this was coming in like to a new world on that\nship. My -- be -- when we started to sail from Naples, until they hit the Gibraltar, it was\ngood sailing, because we were told, you know, the first thing you get on the ship, you get\nsick and all of that, and we went out even that night, and then [indecipherable] near the\nGibraltar, I went outside the deck and even bought some -- some liqueur, you know what\nI mean, because for a dollar you could buy a nice bottle of liqueur to bring it to the\nUnited States, I figured for gifts or so on. And no sooner the next morning when we\nstarted sailing, my wife took sick. She couldn\u2019t take this. When we had to cross the\nstorm, to -- they -- when it was crossing, at that particular time, I almost was sick. But my\ndaughter, being 22 months old, like I say, a little child, they usually can withstand it and\nthey don\u2019t get sick. And each time, she would speak -- my daughter -- Yiddish at the\ntime, or Italian, because kids learn fast languages. And each time she would say, \u201cThe\nboat, the boat is,\u201d you know what I mean, turning? Because from the storm, you used be\nthrown away, and be the time. And I had to -- not was -- I could do to my wife, because\nshe was confined and the nurse was giving her injections, whatever it is. And my little\ngirl just kept me busy, because we going with the stairs, up and down. A child is a child.\nShe didn\u2019t care it\u2019s a storm. And each time I had to keep her that sh -- because when the\nship -- that she shouldn\u2019t get hit or hurt. And it was -- we were delayed because of that\nstorm, whole day that we came in later. We were supposed to come in -- in on a Friday,\nwe came in on Saturday, which it was late, and we didn\u2019t disembark on a Sunday. Only\nwhen we saw harbor, that\u2019s when my wife came to, and she was back to herself, so she at\nleast -- otherwise she -- you know, she wasn\u2019t sick, per se, with any special sicknesses,\nbut she was seasick. So once we looking at the lights, and see the harbor, it sort of was,\nnow we looking at the new world, we are about to come and start our new life that we\npromised ourselves to be. So it -- we didn\u2019t mind it once she got well, and we had a big\ngroup of people coming to wit -- to meet us at the border -- at -- I mean there, at the -- to\nsee us from the boat, it was a lot of her family, that she had more than mine. There were\ncousins, like one cousin was my father\u2019s cousin, which I knew the family quite well, and\nthey were also. And then from there we were taken to a house, oh she\u2019s already deceased\nby now, which it was a first cousin of my wife. And they had a little child at home, too.\nAnd after a few days, that cousin of my father, Louie was his name, he came, took us to\nhis place, because he had a home, and there was more room in his home for us to be\ntaken. And of course, I must say at that time, charity began with the family right there.\nThat morning, you know, he took me shopping, his wife took my wife shopping, bought\nus clothing, you know what I mean, because we came -- we made -- I made tailor made\nsuits over there from the money my parents -- my relatives used to send me packages,\nand with the packages used to be chocolate, and it used to be cigarettes. So they helped\nme of all kinds of troubles. When my wife had to have the Caesarian section there, which\nI'd rather leave a whole part of the story, but Pll only inject over here, the cigarettes, and\nthe chocolates --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: -- and I would go to the marketplace and buy a chicken, and chicken soup was the\ngood remedy that we always know about. So I would cook, even. But all of that was\nbecause of the cigarettes, and the nuns would be very friendly. They gave me a cot that I\ncould sleep at night. Because after surgery, for 24 hours, they were primitive in those --\n\u201948, in Italy -- I mean, my daughter was born in \u201946. When I came in \u201948 to the United\nStates, and my son had to be born in 49, I was like a fantasy. It -- to what it take, a whole\nmonth for her to get well, within two -- three days, she was on her feet. And that\u2019s how\nmuch advanced the American medical system was versus what it was in Italy.",
        "A: No, we came with other friends that we met on the boat, but they -- their lives --\nsurvival was in the Soviet Union. They escaped to the Soviet Union when four -- 1941\nwhen the Germans attacked, again. So they were living in -- in Jasia. And, I mean, they\nwere suffering, but 1t was normal war suffering, shortages of this, ashu -- but the threat of\nlife did not exist with them. We met them, and as a matter of fact, they remained friends\nwith -- he is gone already, by now, but with his wife, even up to this day that we made\nfriends then, and we still remain friendly, and we had sort of a club together, and the\norganization together, and so on.",
        "A: Sure. They came to Chicago like we did, so we had a lot in common for starters, you\nsee? They also came to family in Chicago. We went to high school to-together in Austin\nHigh. They were living in Austin, though, while I was living in Chicago, which it made a\ndifference, that\u2019s why my traveling was more. But we graduate school at the same time,\nand he s -- he still has a brother alive that they -- we\u2019ve bi -- was -- with school -- in\nschool with me at the same time.",
        "A: Sofferstein is their name. Th-The both -- two brothers, and I -- and the other --they\nboth were married, you know what I mean, and have children, and we got to know them\nthen, and we still, like I say, maintain to be f -- to be friendly together.",
        "A: To say the least, I would say, I really saw a world that I haven\u2019t witnessed before. Not\nbecause of the atrocities, but it was so much difference in living, to know that you have a\ntoilet in the same apartment, which -- who would dream about it otherwise than in a\nhotel. In Poland, you know, before the war, to see something like that, running water,\nwhere in 1939, when the war broke out, we still had to ment -- to bring our water in in a\nbucket, from going to -- you know, to a well, or whatever it is outside. So it was just like\nan oasis in the desert would be the easiest description for me to make the comparison, or\nthe analogy at the time, that it was.",
        "A: My spirits were very uplifted. I really felt at that time that I survived. Until then, we\ndid not talk each other, oh we survived, or this, that, and the other. And because people\nwere asking, but it\u2019s a cute story that 1t happened in New York with whole family, with\nmy wife\u2019s -- it was an aunt, her mother\u2019s sister, that we were invited for dinner there. And\nof course, everybody was eager to hear how we survived, and what had went on. I kept\ntalking and telling the people til about three in the morning, and afterwards I was\nangered. I was angered because the questions, after I told them all, two guys says over\nthere, \u201cSo how did you survive?\u201d And it\u2019s sort of to say, \u201cI just told you how we\nsurvived. We escaped.\u201d But it was so unbelievable to them to listen. It was so remote\nthat, in other words, that they had to ask me that question, so how did we survive. So, like\nI say, I was anger, but I tried to be understanding. I says, after all, 1f somebody would\nhave told me about a story like that, by me not being there, how would I react? I would\nnot know how to react about a case like that either. I usually make the analogy, if people\ntell you about Vietnam, or they tell you about the My Lai massacre, or anything like that,\nit\u2019s hard to make a judgement for someone who hasn\u2019t been there. But if you talk to a\nsoldier who has been there, and he tells you that, I take it for granted that he told me the\nstory, because I know how my story when I tell people who haven\u2019t witness, or been\naround, it\u2019s very hard to make them see, or believe, above all, believe the story that a b --\nstory was exactly the way it happened. And this is why it\u2019s a commonology about it, that\nwhen you talk to survivors, do not take for granted that the next guy you talk with, had\nhad the same past as the first one you talk, or the third one that you may talk. And it was\nproven in the documentation sent over, they took interviews from so many survivors, that\nhardly could have been two or three stories that you could make, oh it\u2019s the same thing.\nThe only same thing was the German, the Nazis, the beating, you know, perhaps, and so\non. But the way it came all about was totally difference and -- and by now a lot of people\nare aware, more than they were let\u2019s say 1948, when we came to the United States. But it\nwas a total, total strange story. Some of them told us that [indecipherable] in the papers,\nthey didn\u2019t know anything about it, which later on, when I began to find other findings, I\nwas a tremendous critic about it, because there is no way in the world that a ship, the\nSaint Louis, who came and wanted to dock in Florida, right here, that it could have\nhappened. I believe for -- in posterity, a hundred years, 200 years from today, when the\nkids\u2019Il read it in history, it will not come to them. They will say, something 1s not told\naccurately that it could have been that a ship with a hundred people. We know more from\nhistory now that Hitler tried to prove it, that the Jews are not want -- and here America let\nthem plu -- prove it. That\u2019s why, when we talk about books that have been published,\n\u201cThe Secret War Against the Jews,\u201d for instance, by John Loftus, for one, or others,\npeople know more about it today. But at the time, in the era, and it -- when that happened,\nthe event, it\u2019s hard for me, even a survivor, to understand how that could have happened\nwithout demonstrations. How it could have happened without better judgement than the\nAmerican people and the American government had made not to let in that ship.",
        "A: Yes, people are very interested after they ask. But some people are afraid to ask\nbecause they feel like they are hurting us, the survivors, by revealing the past, what had\nhappened. For instance, I want to inject one more time, even if I do it to the other tape.\nTil this day, we never sat down with our kids, or grandchildren, and tell them. I gave\nthem my manuscript to read. In fact, they didn\u2019t read it. Not why they didn\u2019t read it. I\nbelieve they can put themselves together to face us, and say, \u201cLook what our parents, or\ngrandparents went through.\u201d I\u2019m understanding to the fact. So, when we sit down about a\ncertain thing, or when I write to the papers, and they read it -- I have one of my\ngranddaughters that w -- just got married a-about a few weeks ago. And I was writing\npoems, and I have one poem, Dermarterology, when I wrote Dermarterology, and I asked\nin it the question, sort of why did the world have to have a Holocaust? Did-Didn\u2019t the 10\ncommand-mandments that we gave to the world, didn\u2019t all the other things, with so many\nNobel prize winning, and everything, satisfy the world for the good we brought to them?\nWhy did it have to have the Holocaust? And she was always eager to read if a -- an\narticle, and I wanted basically to let her read, much better than tell my daughter. I don\u2019t\nknow why I felt that way, but that what it was. And she said to me more than once about\nmy poems -- because my poems are interjected how I escaped to the forests, some of my\npoe -- I ask in one of my poe -- poems, I ask to God, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you grant me some\nwings, so I could fly from tree to tree, until I will come to freedom?\u201d I mean, the whole\npoem deals with it. And the other one that I have, I -- a dream, like I dreamed that I will\nbe able to escape from all the -- the -- the bad things that it\u2019s going on in the ghetto, and\nso on. So I\u2019m saying in me, it\u2019s imbedded, the whole life. And my granddaughter said to\nme at the time, me -- as a ch -- she must have been a child, probably, that I\n[indecipherable] about it, must have been eight or nine years of age. And she said, \u201cPapa,\nhow come all your poems, or your writing 1s so sad?\u201d I says, \u201cMarissa, I lived a sad life. I\ncannot go out to put in -- in it happy occasions. So when I write about that I,\u201d you know,\nlike I told her the other poem, when I described in it I wish God would give me those\nwings so I could fly, and then I come to the end. \u201cOh God, you didn\u2019t grant me the wings,\nand I will be sitting and cry for always and forever,\u201d you know what I mean, about it. I\ndon\u2019t say I will die. That I don\u2019t bring out. Somehow or other, in all my punishment, I did\nnot use wordings of dying or thinking -- I always was thinking of life. And maybe that\nwas what I needed to survive, is the positive part, to fight if 1t\u2019s necessary, whatever it is.\nSo, all in all to say I was involved with all of these here things, on every occasion\ndaneech, even though, at the time when I raised little children -- I took, in 1953, as I -- I\ndon\u2019t know, I believe I forementioned it, the audacity to go to write a manuscript in\nEnglish. I felt so goo -- sure, I knew how to write, but I did not know literally how to\nwrite, but to me, I didn\u2019t care what\u2019s it\u2019s missing, you know, because I always left it to\nthat literary agent, which I paid for, and didn\u2019t do nothing for me, and who knows\nwhether he\u2019s still alive, or to the other one. But I wanted the story. I would not -- if I\nwould have be locked in in a room today, like we are right now, and say, \u201cHarold, tell me\nthe story, it wa -- in your manuscript,\u201d I probably would not be able to tell it in the way it\nhappened. I probably would not be able to tell -- remember all the names, dates for sure\nnot, you know what I\u2019m saying. Well, but, for these things, there is such thing as\ndocuments, you can always add in things. So that\u2019s what it was, my part. I only wanted to\nput up as good of my memory as I remembered what I went through. It was a party\nbefore they broke out in Poland, which I mention over there. So it\u2019s no use me revealing.\nI live with all of this here history. When I speak to people, for instance, I must say it over\nhere, which I couldn\u2019t say it there, I\u2019m bilingual in eight languages, and I speak them\nfluently. And when I speak to people, and I\u2019Il start turning from Spanish into Hebrew, or\ninto Russian, or into Polish, and that\u2019s in me -- in business it helped me a lot, especially\nin Chicago. There\u2019s a lot of bilingual usage that you could -- being here in Florida, the\nsame thing, we get people from all ur -- of Europe, and when I can turn around in a\nminute -- but I must confess here, I reserve myself in not speaking a language which it\nhappened a few times. When I started to speak German to a German fellow, and all of a\nsudden he removed his shirt, and he wants to try on a shirt. I was working in Galleria\nMall at that particular time, for the -- name of the store was The Forum. And I took a\nlook [indecipherable], here I saw underneath his arm -- the SS used to have this here, that\nwas their code, where it was r -- put over there, underneath there -- or the Gestapo, who\nknows where he could have bi -- when I saw that, I -- I turned colors, I c -- I was -- I was\n-- asked that I want to go to the washroom, just to go away from the man, if not to lose\nmyself. So when I -- like we were in Israel a year and a half ago, and we [indecipherable]\nover there, in that hotel, they were maybe 40 percent of Germans, young, of the ages of\nmy kids, and with their children, I did not feel restricted of myself to speak German to\nthese people. And -- but all in all, I -- I meet people because I am so involved with it, so\nto one I can speak Polish, while in -- two seconds later, 1] switch over to Russian, or\nfrom Russian to Spanish, or to Hebrew, and people always have -- how could I remember\nall of that at one time? And this 1s -- was my own idea, I don\u2019t know how good my\nmemory will serve as I age, you know what I\u2019m saying? So, it was always importance to\nme to bring out in me. I believe someday some student will probably want to make this\nhere a lesson, and to talk about to other children, which is of importance. And I hope that\nthey always get -- that they always can remember when you have a bad times, don\u2019t look\nfor the half empty glass, look for the half full glass. Hope should never be lost. We\u2019Il die\nanyways, we all know that. We cannot preserve that. But hoping to die, you will die\nsooner. Hoping to live, you will live longer. And it\u2019s not just a phraseology of words, it\u2019s\na thing that it\u2019s -- really works. And you talk to prisoners of war -- we did -- we talked to\na man like Mr. McCain, who was in prison with the Vietnamese, or you talk anybody\nwho was in prison, and they survived. They will tell you in the same words that I am\nsaying, they couldn\u2019t overcome their ordeal, be in Iran, be in Vietnam, be in Korea, be\never -- anyplace that a prisoner of war was taken, if hope would not be lost. Because\nwhen hope is lost, that\u2019s what it happens, it\u2019s lost, life 1s lost. So, my message 1s always\nof importance. When I talk about the better deal, not to forget to have that listener hear\nthat hope to live. So when I speak to young kids, high school kids and student -- or\nstudents, or even in colleges which I spoke, I always do not give answer. The hardest\nthing was for me when I spoke to kids in school of years back -- which I have some on\ntape also, and they ask me how many Germans did I kill? And how do you go ahead to\nanswer a child in school when he ask me a raw question like that? And it\u2019s a hard way to\nanswer. I must therefore, instead of giving him an answer to say, \u201cOh, I killed probably\n20, or 30, or 50,\u201d which it would mean I would go ahead to look at a personal thing,\nremember the questioner, remember that he is the child of 14 and 15, and I do not want to\ngive him that answer, that life -- answer is the weapon, and killing is the answer. So I\nalways must bring it to him the idea, that yes, killing is not right, but defending oneself is\nthe right that he must never forget, no matter who it 1s, when your life is threatened, you\nalso have the law of rights for you to go ahead and defend your life. So when I tell that to\nthe kids, they get a bi -- they get a different understanding about weapons, and about\nkilling. And this is usually, when I spoke to kids today, it would not matter where. I\nspoke seven years in a row that I used to be here in Fort Lauderdale, and I used to make\nthe Day of Remembrance -- Remembrance Days, in city hall. And I remember the first\nmayor that time, that adopted for me to do it was Mayor Kaminski. And the biggest\nquestion always used to be, why did I want to chose that I want to speak in city hall? And\nafter I explained it to him, they saw my way 1s right. I say, you must remember that all\nour sufferings, it started in buildings like that. Whether laws were changed, or the laws\nwere taken away. I want to be proud of the idea that I survived, and we have seen a time\nwhere we can come back to these buildings, and salute the freedom we have in America,\nand the freedom that it should be of democracy throughout the world, that yes, there is a -\n- arepayment day to be proud of, that we changed the evil days, and this 1s what it was,\nmy message in the same way when I came to speak in front of the justice depart --\njustices in Springfield, Illinois, when the Nazis wanted to march, so if you\u2019re ever\ninterested, go ahead, get the movie, \u201cSkokie,\u201d and you\u2019ll see Danny Kaye play Harold\nZissman in it. And this is what I said, and I was the last speaker, not expected maybe, to\nspeak at all, and when we get it first at the house, with the congressmen, and it was, at\nthat place, it was the military commander the -- from the Jewish war veterans of the state\nof Illinois. It was the commander of the war veterans -- the Jewish war veterans of\nChicago, it was a few congressmen, and everybody was sort of questioning, what subject\nare you going to talk about, what subject is the other one going to talk about? Because we\ndid not want to use the time, in other words, that shu -- two people who should be talking\nit in the same way. When it came to me, I says, \u201cI? I had no title.\u201d Just as it is in the\nmovie, the true words that he picked up. Who knows, maybe I may not even be called to\nsay anything, but today a surprise. Even I was the last person called, when they called my\nname, I came over, and I says, at the time, which the language 1s still fresh with me,\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen of the justices, and justice\u2019s guests, who are here today, I want\nyou all to rise for one moment of silence, today is D-Day.\u201d With the loudest voice I could\nget out. They all rose, and I tuc -- checked my watch. And I says, \u201cNow, you may be\nseated.\u201d Cameramen started running from all side to me, I became the hero, I became the\none. And a guy from a small town in Illinois comes over to me, he says, \u201cMr. Zissman,\nI'd like an interview.\u201d I said, \u201cll be more than happy to give you an interview, but not\ntoday, not now.\u201d I says, \u201cRabbi Montrose and me are going right now back to Skokie,\nbecause my niece, and the rest of the class of the Hebrew school is going to be graduating\ntoday. However, here is my card,\u201d I was an [indecipherable] salesman at that particular\ntime. I says, \u201cYou can call me to my house, I will give time to you, and I\u2019Il make the time\nfor your convenience. Come and see me and I\u2019Il give you all the interview.\u201d The fact\nremains that he did have a beautiful [indecipherable] in some place, like almost to say my\narchives there. And the man, you know, he was not Jewish, he was Gentile, but I moved\nhim, and that\u2019s why he wanted to hear me. All the other speakers, while they were talking\nabout the march, I didn\u2019t talk just about a march [indecipherable]. I just come with a --\nthat -- the minute of silence, I says, \u201cSo many years ago, our boys and girls went to\nEurope to fight Nazism, so that menace should never be seen nor heard.\u201d The judiciary\ncommittee at that particular time wanted to pass on a law that freedom of speech yes, but\nto go on the paraphernalia, with the swastikas and everything like that, the way the Nazis,\nespecially the SS, and Gestapo were dressed, that is not necessary to do, because\nwhatever we tried at that time, on the jer -- Phil Donohue show, which I forced my way\nthrough, and I repeat something, probably you heard of it. Talked to Goldberger, I wanted\nto make the separation between freedom of speech, and attack on people\u2019s life. And that\u2019s\nbasically what the march was all about. They did not -- if they want to speak, they didn\u2019t\nhave to come to Skokie, they can speak anyway. But they wanted to come to Skokie for\nthe reason that survivors of the Holocaust were living by such multitudes there, and\nthrow the venom that we don\u2019t deserve to be alive. Now, this is a different than free\nspeech, this is a threat to life, and I believe the First Amendment never was intended to\nmake a threat of life. We used to say that hi -- il -- you know, saying fire in a crowded\ntheater is against the law. Okay, but this is another saying. Now, a threat of a life of a\nperson cannot be tolerated, be -- who it may be, be against Jews, be against Asians, be\nagainst Blacks or anybody else. It has no place in a society, of the 20 -- of the millenium\nthat we entering right now to exist. And this has always been my fight about it. And\nthat\u2019s why I -- I -- we tirelessly, no matter I work hard, I still -- I just stopped working for\na little while right now, because my granddaughter\u2019s marriage, but I may go back to work\n[indecipherable], I\u2019ll see how my health will permit me. But it never took away from me\nthe time to sit down behind the typewriter and write an article to the paper. A lot of times\nI\u2019m not published, and they try, perhaps to discourage me, but no one, as long I will live,\nand my mind will be silent -- will be in good shape, and it\u2019ll be sane, will anybody give\nme any problems that I will not be able to speak my mind up against someone. Sure, I\nwrote an article against Haider now in Austria, it was not published, but I spoke up.\nMaybe these words may change the editor, okay? So be whatever situations that has -- 1-1t\nhappens in the United States, of all the years that I\u2019ve been here. I always was vocal, and\nI will remain vocal for as long as I live, to bring the story out. It\u2019s not just to tell about the\nHolocaust, it\u2019s to tell to prevent another Holocaust every to occur, and it doesn\u2019t have to\nbe a Holocaust against the Jews, the Holocaust against anybody else. The Holocaust only\nhappened because too many minds were silent. What it happens right now with Haider, in\nAustria, which openly -- and we will see, with those people who think mine -- that he has\nno place in government. For as long -- because he says I\u2019m sorry I said that, it still lives\nin him. For as long people have in their minds against certain people, which I said it in\nmy article there -- he was against the immigration with comes in. Who made them be\nimmigrants if it wouldn\u2019t be for the Nazis at their time, where Austria was a part. So we\nmust, and understand always, these situations. There\u2019s so many lies came out in print\nbecause they knew somebody. I\u2019Il never forget, I had a fight, and I lost it. I lost the fight.\nAbout thr -- about three years ago, that time when my other daughter was married\n[indecipherable] -- my granddaughter, the first one, and 1t was in West Palm Beach. And\nin West Palm Beach, we have a lot of these haters in there, be that they\u2019re neo-Nazis, Ku\nKlux Klan, you name it. Be from the church, or whatever. They are there, they find they\nare th -- and an article was there, written by a man who 1s a novelist writer, he is not a\nhistorian, and he came saying that the Auschwitz [indecipherable] about Germany has got\nto stop. So he tries to bring out, why not look at the good things? And the man came and\nbrought out that in Berlin, that the Berliners were hidden 10,000 Jewish families. Now,\nwhen I saw that -- I was reading the paper [indecipherable] that morning, and I was all\nshaken up. 10,000 1s a multitude. If he was to say at least a hundred, maybe it would have\nbeen cor -- not questionable, but it would have been believable. But that multitude,\n10,000? And I wrote a -- an article to the paper, and asking them. I says, \u201cDon\u2019t you think\nthat Yad Vashem in Israel would have any knowledge about that, so they would go ahead\nto,\u201d -- they did for single people who saved a Jewish family, planted a tree in his name\nand everything. I said, \u201cThe Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., don\u2019t you think\nthey would have had a record of something like that?\u201d But it falls on deaf minds. I called\nbefore that, because I think maybe I didn\u2019t hear it, but I know, I am pretty much in tune to\nall of these here things that are happening, but my article of rebuttal, never appeared. And\nthis is why we must have more people be outspoken, be in script, be vocal. And we must\nnot remain just to ourselves, \u201cOh, you can\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d That\u2019s the negative\nattitude, which I said. We must look at it positive. When it\u2019s a time to speak out, we must\nspeak out. Otherwise, democracy will never be a democracy, but that\u2019s the whole idea of\ndemocracy, that everybody is entitled to their opinion. So while we guard honor to exist,\nwe must guard of these reactionary forces, that they never should take hold again, to\nwhatever they have in mind. And you know -- we know whatever they have in mind, one\nagainst the other, and that\u2019s what they come, and become -- you know what I mean. To\nsettle -- they kill both of them, and that\u2019s all there is to it.\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: Okay, that\u2019s -- will be good.",
        "A: When I came to United States in 1948, I believe the first thing on my mind was in the\npositive, how do I become a citizen of the United States. I filed my first papers, as we call\nthem, as soon time permitted to be done for it, and -- and at -- when I was called was\nalmost five years later to become a citizen, and I proudly am happy that I was granted the\n-- first of all, that I was granted life again, because I consider that\u2019s -- I was rebor --\nreborn, I, my wife, and my daughter, coming to the United States. We -- some people of\nours, the survivors want to come, that we were reborn, at freedom time when -- when the\nhostilities ended. But to me, I don\u2019t want to call it that it was still life. To me, the\nimpression that I made, the first class, 1n the ship that I thub -- the same thing, even\nthough our apartment, the first apartment was in a basement, and we were there with a\nchild, and a few months later, my brother-in-law came. So even though there was a lot of\nthings to be dissatisfied about, but my satisfaction, like I forementioned, be going to\nschool, be all of the other things, belonging again to an organization. So I can see that my\nlife had started -- I was reborn in 1948 with my wife, and I hope the man above, or the\nperson above, that God remembers that not to account my years before, and that would\nbeen a great favor that I can ask. The United States as a government, I had a lot of\ndissatisfaction in my mind with the Roosevelt era, and at times it was hard on me to go\nahead to throw it away. I know being a history student, and being involved with the\nthings in Italy, I knew n -- quite well about a person from Switzerland who came that he\nwas working, and telling over here, he -- the ordeal of the Jews, what it was on. And it\nwas at a time in \u00b042, when Hitler already had made the dimension of the le -- Final\nSolution, or Judenrein, but the Final Solution, that was image. I know well enough the\nstory where the partisans in Poland, who sent all their messages to England, and it went\nin a safe world. So like I say, 1t was a rebirth for me, coming to see freedom. And I\nsuppose when a person is frees, that\u2019s how your questions become open, because in other\nwords, when I was under the Soviet Union, I couldn\u2019t ask some of the questions that it\ncame up to me in the United States. I couldn\u2019t ask why would the British at that particular\ntime, keep hidden that story that -- that it was told, that the final solution, by Goebbels\nwhen he allows -- that they\u2019Il rid themselves of the Jews of all Europe, why would that\nhave to be in a safe sill? Perhaps the Jewish community in Britain would have maybe\nreact to it, I understand, and that\u2019s why they kept it from them. But in America, under the\nRoosevelt administration, knowing full well at that time that a delegate came, and telling\nall of that, and since the United States, at that particular time, under the Roosevelt\npresidency did not see fit to give any help whatsoever, to stop the menace of destruction\nthat it went on in Auschwitz, and so on, by ohm -- what that means. I know full well at\nthat -- this -- this story of the rabbi from Cleveland, who went at that particular time to\nintervene to the president, and what came out of it. He came out with that message, don\u2019t\nrock the boat. All of these here parts of hate, and what had happened to all of us became\nrenewed follen -- during freedom. But above all, I wanted to become one of the\nAmericans, in spite of all of this. In a way, I thought maybe, speaking as an American\ncitizen, it would help my grief to speak out a little bit better. And therefore, things got, in\n1953, I was -- became a proud citizen, and quiet I did not remain. I was vocal, and\nwhatever I could write -- even I didn\u2019t care that my writing was not as good as that\nAmerican who perhaps was born, and had more schooling in English than I did. I was\nproud about the other thing, that I could speak more languages than the average\nAmerican.",
        "A: Yes. First of all, I must say, as I said it in the aforementioned tape, I graduated in\nPoland, a school by the name Yavna, which is a Zionist Hebrew school, and it\u2019s a\ntrilingual school. We were taught over there Yiddish, Hebrew, and English. So\nimmediately, I started with three schools. I usually say to people when they ask me, how\ndoes it happen that you speak eight la-languages, I say invention -- I say, if a person\u2019s in\ntrouble, he says, he must invent something. So, the American proverb goes with it, and\nthat\u2019s what it was invention, for me. With three languages, when we crossed the border\non the Russian side, I had to learn Russian. Afterwards, after the war, when we came into\nItaly, I did not know Italian, so I learned Italian. While being under the German yoke, it\nwas not a question learning German because I loved that language, it was a question that\nwhen a German spoke to you, and you didn\u2019t understand what he was saying, the beating\nwas worse. However, even if you did do what he wanted, you still got a beating. But you\nhad to -- so again, it was necessity, was for me to learn another language. So no matter\nhow much I learned German, but I could at least speak, and converse with someone in\nGerman. So we have three, and two is five, and the sixth one, came to Italy again. You\ncome to a country, is strange, beautiful people, I wish it would have been this type of --\nside of the ocean, I don\u2019t ever leave them. They didn\u2019t care to say Jew. To them it was\npolacko. Seeing as I was coming from Poland, I\u2019m Polish. And when you said to them\nthe word Jew, or Hebraio, they did not even know what the meaning of it, especially in a\ncountry like that, where Mussolini, and fa -- fash -- if -- if you call Fascism Fascism,\nstarted it way before Hitler. But the people were not drilled on the hatred. If anybody\nhated a Jew, perhaps he hated somebody else, too, because he was a hater. But I didn\u2019t\nfeel it. The hospitality of these people, what they had to us, is beyond reproach. You ask\nan Italian person, you show him with an address here and there, he wouldn\u2019t tell you it\u2019s\nthere, or down the street, next block. He\u2019d take you there. This, to us, at that particular\ntime, case is need, but I still tried to learn Italian. So, you have -- you have six languages\nby then. When I started making my papers, I did not want to come to America, not be\nable to turn my tongue. So, as dearly as I was living on charity sort of, but going to a\nprivate teacher -- to a tutor, I and another friend of mine, we went away to take up\nEnglish. So, as you see, one after the other, one after the other was means of necessity.\nWhen I had my store, after the riots that I went into, instead of the grocery business, to\nthe men\u2019s business, even the riots, I must make my point, I was totally destroyed, and 20\nyears of labor went on with smoke. But I went on with life, and I restructured it, I went\ninto the men\u2019s clothing. A tailor recom -- is being recommended to me by a neighbor\nbusinessman, a barber, and he\u2019s a good tailor, I tested him, he knew what to do. But I\ncannot speak Spanish. My wife goes out, and buys me a dictionary, I get another little\nbook, and all of a sudden, within a few months -- so there you make the total of all of it,\nand they come to eight all together. And I\u2019m very proud about it, that I can speak to\npeople with other languages. It never happened to me that if I meet someone, and he\u2019s got\na hard time in the li -- speaking English, but I can, through their dialect recognize the --\none of the languages, and I\u2019m right there -- we already friends, within two minutes,\nbecause the person can talk to me, or ask me qu -- the -- so it becames a friendship. So --\nbut writing, like I say, I only write in English. I did not write to write in any other\nlanguage, not that I couldn\u2019t write in Hebrew, or anything like that, I write, but it\u2019s still\ntoday -- in today\u2019s world, that\u2019s the language of the world. When you know English, you\ncan go anyplace in the world and be heard of or -- or know about. So that was the reason\nthat my languages was not a merit -- matter of scholastically, they were a matter of\nnecessity. And this is exactly why I adopted all of these here things.",
        "A: Right, three.",
        "A: Russian is four, and German is five, Italian is six, Spanish is seven, and English is\neight, you know. So there you go, you -- my -- my figures are accurately [indecipherable]",
        "A: \u201953, I went in business, and became a citizen at the same time. In 1953, I became a\ncitizen, and in January of 1953, I went in the grocery business. Thanks God, as I\nforementioned, to my father-in-law, that he helped me with the money, otherwise I\u2019d\nnever be able to get started.",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, I was in New York only when I -- when I came about -- it\u2019s immediately\n-- I spent about three weeks in New York. And therefore, we came in March, in April we\nwere here already -- to sh -- in Chicago, I mean. So that\u2019s what it was.",
        "A: He came in 1950. He was in Germany, while we weren\u2019t -- we were, like I told you\nalready, there were -- we were -- we didn\u2019t touch Germany. My brother-in-law came at\nthe end of 1948, and -- no wait, my father-in-law came probably in 1949, not 1950,\nplease forgive me, 1949 he came.",
        "A: Very true, very true. III tell you mine -- my story now. And this is a documented si-\nsituation. In 1948 -- \u201948 became -- in 1953, I started a business on my own, and between\n1948 and \u00b053, I worked for my uncle, which I said, my mother\u2019s brother -- brothers. Be\nfor what it\u2019s worth, that in about 1955, I already had saved enough money for a down\npayment of a three flat building that I went in Skokie, and I bought it. One day my uncle\ncomes to visit with me. Next door to us, in the other, was only a two flat, not a three flat.\nOver there, they had a boy of my son\u2019s age, which you usually feel good about it, the two\nchildren of the same ages, they had some -- so their son used to come to our house\nsometimes, my son would go to their house, and the two boys used to be playing\ntogether. And I did not want to inject that [indecipherable] that kid was an adopted, but\nfor the sake of it, l-let it be, 1t would not mean any difference. One day when my uncle\nwants to come to visit with us, to see -- in other words, our new apartment, first of all,\nand the building what we bought, because I no longer -- I -- my -- my employment for\nhim stopped in 1953, in December. So he comes in and while we were waiting, next door\nto us, the guy, who used to be called as a nickname Red. \u201cHey Red, how you doing?\u201d My\nuncle says to him, \u201cOh,\u201d he says, \u201cI came here to visit my nephew, you know the nephew\nI brought from Europe.\u201d He gave the moniker right away. And so on, so how you doing,\nhe talks to him because he knew him that he used to be in the clothing business, so on.\nNot telling you a story, but a fact of life, my son\u2019s relationship with his son had stopped\nwithin a few days, and it never woke up again. I did not want to aggravate a situation like\nthat towards my child, you know what I mean. After all, my son was born in 1949, so\nhere we\u2019re talking about 1954, so you know, he was a little boy of, you know, five years\nold, he understands wa -- so, he\u2019s a very -- a child cannot understand this here. So be it.\nSo in school he met with more kids than that, when he started school, which at five, you\nknow what I mean? He didn\u2019t [indecipherable] yet. So we didn\u2019t worry about it. It hurted\nus, what happened. So, the only disruption it could have been, that this way he didn\u2019t\nknow what we Holocaust survivors, you know? Because first of all, we were working too\nhard, and my wife used to take the kids to s -- to the store to bring them, because at that\nparticular time I tried to save as much as I could on help, you know? And besides, I\nborrowed money. I borrowed money from my father-in-law, borrowed money from my\nbrother-in-law, and I had to repay them, so the only way to repay them when you buy a\nsmall store, is to see that a -- you don\u2019t overdue on expenses, you know\u2019? So that was the\npart, which at that time, that we did. So we did not have, basically, enough association\nwith the neighbors around, you know? Was -- when we came, was late at night, when we\nwent away was early in the morning. The store used to be open from -- from about nine\nin the morning, til about six o\u2019clock at night, so you know, it -- it would take, in those\ndays, I will driv -- I started to drive a car 1949, just as my son was born. I fought for\neverything. I wanted to be, to me to become just a regular person, without a moniker, you\nknow what I mean? So to say a lot of times, I would get, through the years, from\nAmerican people, not just that particular case that I forementioned, \u201cHey, I detect an\naccent on you, where you from?\u201d I says, \u201cI\u2019m from hell, but I made it back.\u201d And people\nwould say -- one time a customer in the store said to me, \u201cYou mean from Hell,\nIndiana?\u201d I says, \u201cNo, I did not know that Indiana has a Hell.\u201d He says, \u201cOh yeah, there\nis a place named Hell, in Indiana.\u201d He says, \u201cMy hell comes much further than that.\u201d So,\nthe cus -- the wife -- the customer says, \u201cYou mean, you come from Europe?\u201d I says,\n\u201cYes, the Holocaust is what I forementioned.\u201d So what I\u2019m saying, I always tried to keep\nthis away. Even as of late, when I worked at Bloomingdale\u2019s in Boca Raton, people\nwould come into me, other ones would say, \u201cHey, I just heard you speak another\nlanguage, you spoke Spanish. Where are you coming from?\u201d And I would say the same\nthing, from hell. \u201cSo what happened you acquired all these languages?\u201d I says,\n\u201cNecessity.\u201d Just like the proverb says, is the mother of invention. Necessity is the\nmother of invention. That was with me the case. But people always sort of have a habit\nthat very few inst -- not all -- not all of them, not there, some people take it in a wrong\nkind of a way. You know how to saying goes, if -- if you are ever bitten by a dog, keep a\nstick handy. You know what I am saying? Because not to be bitten again. And this is -- in\nmost cases, it\u2019s a touchy way when you touch it. You know, it\u2019s like electricity, you get\nthat shock. You get an electric shock with the way some people -- oh I know -- I heard all\nabout it. You know what I\u2019m saying? If you heard all about it, you wouldn\u2019t have to ask\nme, obviously, but you do ask me, so it\u2019s still misunderstood, the whole era, even we are\ntalking about 55 years later. And some people, if I has to vocalize on it, will say, if there\nare Jews, or non-Jews, wouldn\u2019t matter with me. The guilt of the citizens, who were\ncomplacent at the era, and who were not mixed up in the politics -- which American\npeople are not mixed up in politics. I don\u2019t know, I could say thanks God, no, and I s --\ncould say the other way around, there\u2019s always two sides to each story, because we see it\nby the record of ame -- percentages of American people who go to -- to vote. I woke -- by\nthe way, I worked for a polling place, and I go do it for quite a few years. The\npercentages comparing Europe and the United States, who go to the polls to vote, is\nridiculous. So that is the same thing what I say, American people basically, until election\ntime don\u2019t count -- don\u2019t talk about the politics so much as people of other countries. So\nlike I say, there 1s perhaps a plus, and a minus in it. Who knows how the outcome would\nhave been different? But the guilt is a guilt in existence. Nobody -- when somebody just\nas recently started to mention for the millenium, talking about presidents. And I don\u2019t\ncare what category they\u2019re going to put in Roosevelt, he had made at that particular time,\nSocial Security, and anything like that, yes, there were good things. But we have a\nproverb in Hebrew that we say, \u201cWherever there is light, there is always a shadow.\u201d And\nwe know it when we speak scholastically from school. When you put in that little stick in\nthe ground, at 12 o\u2019clock the shadow 1s the smallest, but there is a shadow. So you always\nmust understand it, to be understanding to people. There is always going to be that\nshadow, there\u2019s always going to be some people who do not, or did not know well, or\ndon\u2019t understand the situation well, to opinionize certain ways. However, I would not\nlabel it, if anybody comes to ask me with that question. Do you think -- yes, there are.\nBut I always -- I always give the answer why, as I just said it. Either those people are not\naware, or they are guilty. They are guilty of why the American government, and the\nAmerican people did let it happen the way it happened. And this is always going to be a\nmatter -- how do you going to bring the time back, with those people back, to be judged\nthere.",
        "A: I was vocal about it right there and then. The majority people gave me an answer, we\ndid not know. And I used to madly answer them, that\u2019s the story I heard with the German\npeople, they say, we didn\u2019t know. But the stench of the concentration camp was in their\nbackyard, and those people came saying they didn\u2019t know. I says, so please, I used to\nchastise tremendously, especially Jewish people, and in my family same way. Please\ndon\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t know. It was publicized everywhere, and you did know. The\npoint was, you were too busy with yourself, because I had gotten answers like these here.\nMy wife used to work in a bakery here, as a clerk, and a lot of times, people would say\nthe same thing. They ask her about accent the first thing, you know, the accent. So,\npolitely you would say, \u201cOh, we\u2019ve -- Holocaust survivor.\u201d \u201cOh, we also had here, we\nhad a depression in here.\u201d So, when a person can go ahead to metaphorize the depression\nwith the Holocaust, I believe that\u2019s a very low tone, and low way of doing it. I wrote, for\ninstance, to the paper, they published it, but they fixed my clock, they put in just a few\nsentences. That editorialist writer tried to take Mozambique, and all the other places, and\ncompare it with the Holocaust. I, a few times wrote it, and the last time I don -- I don\u2019t\nget tired of writing, and I asked, how dare? I says, \u201cThe Jews did not ask for territory.\nThe Jews did not ask for any recognition as far as government, or anything like that. But\nin Mozambique, or in the other place, those are people who are fighting political wars,\nand religious wars. Where do you compare these with the Holocaust? The Holocaust had\nnothing of that nature. The Holocaust was just done, provoked by a government, made up\nlaws in Nuremberg, and for one reason, because you were born Jewish, therefore you\ndeserved to die. Or that\u2019s -- give them the right to kill you, or all kinds of other reasons.\u201d\nWhich, you say how ca -- how can people, in their sane mind, make that comparison, be\nthat it\u2019s Kosovo, be that it\u2019s Mozambique. Yes, it happens there, yes, there are atrocities\nthere. Yes, the Serbs wanted to get -- get rid of the Albanians. Yes, the Catholics don\u2019t\nappreciate the Moslems. Yes, the Moslems maybe don\u2019t like the Jews, or the others. We\nknow that there will be dissatisfaction. But the usage of the word holocaust cannot, and\nshould never be made over such a analogy to interpret it. Because no matter which\ndictionary in the world, be Webster\u2019s or anybody else, they mix in a word of sacrifice,\nburning. Yes, we were the sacrifice for the hungry lions of Germany. I said it in my\nmanuscript. Of course, the rewrite doesn\u2019t bring out these kinds of sentences. But that\u2019s --\nwhat -- I cannot stand that word, that -- that word holocaust, when you read from a\ndictionary, or certain dictionaries to say it\u2019s a burning, it\u2019s a sacrifice. I cannot a-answer\nthat. The Holocaust was a definitely -- meaning by a government from their top level, to\nthe man on the street, that he was ordered, if he didn\u2019t want it -- to do it, that this 1s the\nway he was graded. That was the difference between going to the front lines, or being in\nthe concentration camps, and be a commander there, or whatever it 1s. What they got\nfrom everything, including the gold teeth that they tore out, or the watches and rings that\ntook away, to send to their loved ones, or to accumulate all what they did.",
        "A: I have the trouble for always and forever, when anybody tried to analogize, or\nmetaphorize the word holocaust to anything that 1s going on. I give you an example.\nGhetto is another one that I have a problem with. When Harlem is called a ghetto, I wish\nto the world that they would only be living in these type of ghettos, and believe me there\nwould not have been a such thing. When we define ghettos, we must always define the\nghetto where are we talking about. The ghetto of Rome? The ghetto of Venice, which it\nwas the first? And because of grata, came into ghetto, because it was the steel bars that it\nwas made around there, and it was near a foundry, but that name was fine. So the first\nghetto. Or, do we talk of the ghetto of Rome, that the Jews were put there, and only for\none reason, become Catholic, and you\u2019re free. Those little places are still left today.\nWhere it used to be the Jesuits used to come out to the Jews each time they let them out\nfrom the ghetto, they would say, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you become a Christian, and you wouldn\u2019t\nhave to live in here?\u201d When they came back to return to let them into the ghetto, it was\nstill the same [indecipherable]. How can anybody make that analogy to that word ghetto\nto use when the Black people of America were living in their neighborhoods? They were\nliving in their neighborhoods because they felt good. Jews were living in the Bronx, or in\nSkokie because -- not that anybody put them there, because they felt good. But when a\ngovernment puts you in a place, and they make barbed wire, or any kind of enclosure,\nand you have to have a permit to go in, and you have to have a permit going out, and you\ndenied from all freedoms, you become an inhuman. Are you going to compare this here\nwith a [indecipherable] neighborhood. No, I cannot tolerate that. And I doubt it any\nsurvivor from the Holocaust could tolerate. But we know a lot of writers take the law in\ntheir own hands, and the thing they emphasize, to say if 1t was an airplane who was lost,\nand so many, maybe a few hundred people got killed by that, they say it was a total\nholocaust. I don\u2019t know from where they have the audacity, or the shortage of words in\ntheir command, that they have to use that word holocaust, to make the issue be blown up\nmore out of proportion. We are talking about six million human. Sure, somebody will tell\nme that 25 million is what the Nazis brought over. So we\u2019re talking about 19 -- yes, we\nmust establish the old, famous word, that other people than Jews were killed. But the\nJews were meant to be killed. So the other people maybe could have been killed by way,\nbe that they were criminals, be that they were in the way of them, or whatever it is. But\nthe Jewish people were definitely meant, and put by the laws, executed with armies to do\nthat. So how can you analogize something like this, or metaphorize that word for a\nsituation like that, like that woman did to, say Mozambique? So she fixed my clock. She\ngave me about seven or eight lines, instead of like she had a big spread. And that happens\nall the time. Like I started to tell you that story about that -- with the 10,000 Jews that he\nclaimed Berlin had saved. It\u2019s a lie. But the press will pick up these lies fast, and don\u2019t\ngive you an edge, to let you respond in the proper way. So, that\u2019s democracy, I suppose.\nSo, I cannot say any other way. In democracy everybody gets into these here\n[indecipherable]. There will never be a perfect world, there isn\u2019t a perfect family. You\ndon\u2019t have a family, with the same mother and father, and they have three, four kids, and\nall kids are the same. So my expectation, to have a world of such ideals, history proves\nthat it never happened, and I don\u2019t care to what denomination they belong, or to what\nreligion they adopted. We cannot do it. In order to do that, we woulda have to create a\nnew world from A, to start in an -- in an [indecipherable] here, that you cannot leave any\nother way, but everybody\u2019s the same, and everybody feels the same. But we know we\nwill not achieve it, and history\u2019s not going to change. The least we can do 1s fight for the\nrights. But again, I\u2019ll repeat it. To take any situation of -- a situation in history and\nmetaphorize it for another situation, by that same name, is wrong. Doesn\u2019t have to be just\nHolocaust. Could have been any other usage of the word, like I said the word ghetto.\nWhich ghetto are we talking about? Nazi ghetto? We\u2019re talking about -- or the other\nghettos? There was always the casbah in Africa, when we see it in the film. That was also\na means of a ghetto. But that was a separation of doing certain things. A neighborhood is\nnot a ghetto, and let\u2019s -- let -- let\u2019s understand each other. When you have the freedom\nwhere -- to choose where you want to live, even in a restricted area, even, let\u2019s assume\nthe niggers, as they used to be called, which it\u2019s a -- was, I think because of the Niger\nriver, you know what I mean, it was interpret like that, even at that time, they still had the\nopportunity of living on this street, or on that street, they did not go to ask the\ngovernment. They moved on their own. But the -- when we talk eras with Holocaust,\nwhen we talk about eras from the ghetto, that was restricted, you couldn\u2019t, as I just\naforementioned, with the priests, or the Jesuits who would stay there, and tell them, why\ndon\u2019t you join us? So when you get the choice, how can it be so bad about it. As -- in the\nghetto, I used to have to discuss it with my father\u2019s brother, who was a rabbi, and he was\nreminding the 14\" century Spain, and he would say, with his words, can you imagine,\nbecause he was a religious person, he says, \u201cGod had conference with the Jews of Spain,\u201d\nso he let them have a choice, and those who wanted to remain Jews, remained Jews.\nSome were -- that it -- were caught, wound up with the --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: -- to come from work, and I have seen the killings what they did, of children, of so on,\nI used to be shaken up. I used to be shaken up, and I used to come -- I says, children, they\ndid not have time to sin. Why were they murdered? And that again comes to part of the\nanalogy which I\u2019m talking about, or metaphor to say, when killing children, are you\ngoing to compare this here to other situations? No, there is no comparison to that. That\nwas a unique situation, and it must for history -- historical events, or history for the\nfuture, remain a unique event what it happened. We see a lot of times of atrocities that it\nhappened to people, but for as long governments were involved in these atrocities, it\ndoesn\u2019t become a singled out case, 1t becomes a part. The Holocaust was involved from a\ngovernment, with an army, and everything like this here to carry out. Can you imagine,\npeople were denied to go to the front lines, for as long there were good killers of Jews.\nNow, can you have anything to compare a situation like that with? You cannot.",
        "A: I was -- became a democrat, I believe right now, before I even was justified to go to\nwalt, you know, but I was a democrat. President Truman left a very big mark on me, his\ninterpretation of political events. I must say, til this day, although, in the interim of the\nyears being in America as an American, and I didn\u2019t miss an election that I didn\u2019t vote,\neven -- even if it wasn\u2019t a regular election, but it was just a matter of a party election,\nwhich it was, I always voted, because I feel, after what I\u2019ve been through, where voting\nwas denied for me, where citizenryship was denied from me, that this 1s a privilege thing\nthat one could never give up, and I never did, and I never failed to vote. And like I said,\nPresident Truman left a big -- that buck stops here, he left a lot of good things on me, and\nthrough the era, every once in awhile it happened, for instance, I voted for President\nReagan over President Carter, because I was very mad at President Carter\u2019s era that he\nwas the president. I personally [indecipherable] he did not deserve to be a president. He\nmade a good peanut farmer. He will never go in through history as a good president. We\nlost a lot of things that we still haven\u2019t straightened out because of his misyudgment. And\nI believe above all, when we are talking about the prisoners, just look what he did at that\ntime, playing into the hands of Khomeini with Iran. We never -- we never fixed that\nrupture since then. But if he would have invoke at that time, our military might, which we\nhad and we could, because when a country invades an embassy of the next country, that\u2019s\na declaration of war, even if it\u2019s not officially said, the word, but that international law is\nan in -- is immediately, it\u2019s a declaration of war. So therefore, he was justified as\npresident to do a much better job than he did. And I believe the loss -- the horn of Africa\nat that time, and inflation that had gone up to 27 and half percent, sure the retired people\nloved him for that, because they didn\u2019t -- some of them didn\u2019t make as much money on\ntheir jobs as these inflationary dollars, they thought brought it to them, because elderly\npeople, of course, don\u2019t spend as much as young people. So when they got 18 and 20\npercent on their bank books, you know, or even the -- even 18 percent, that was big\nmoney for them, and you know what I mean, they want -- but look at, they would have\nonly turned around to see that the 18 percent that they earned, they have to go out in the\nmarketplace, and pay 22 percent for it, if they were to buy. So in the long run, they lost\nfour percent, not that they gained that much. So I mean, there was a lot of good things,\nand therefore when it came Reagan to go for president, I did vote for him. Not for so\nmuch that it was a vote for him, as it was a vote against President Carter. I believe it\u2019s --\ncertain elections, I\u2019d probably cross the line, because I like one candidate, a cert -- over a\ncertain party, better than the other one. So, in generalizing, or -- or finalizing my\nstatement, I would say, when you come to that little room, and you come behind that\ncurtain to vote your opinion, a person should think about a little bit. And I was always\nthinking about who I vote for. And -- and I have been -- I am encouraging other people\nthe same way. So yes, I became immediately an American by going into politics,\nmeaning supporting the political will. I became a democrat, and I\u2019ve been a registered\ndemocrat all the years since we came to the United States. And hopefully, unless I see the\nRepublican party grown up, and understand that all of us are not millionaires, and all of\nus don\u2019t have inheritance in the oil, and in the others, and we still have to go out to make\na living, so if they want our labor force to turn around and become a labor force of\nMexico, I don\u2019t say they\u2019re justified there. But they live in Mexico, and if they can take\nit, with their livelihood that provided, fine. But here in America, as Americans, we\u2019re\nentitled to have a Social Security, we entitled to have our Medicare, and we also entitled\nto all the goods of life, that is given, like all others. So therefore, when today we see that,\nfor instance, the -- the -- the amount a person can earn, I don\u2019t care that people say he\u2019s a\n-- a youngster from school and goes to work for the minimum wage. The minimum wage\nis understandable that no one can remain forever. But at the same time, we must\nunderstand that sometimes 1n life there are people in between jobs, and when they go 1n,\nand they have to earn this measly few dollars, is not right. Again, we cannot make that\nthis industry belongs just to the kids, to school kids, or so on. That would not be\ndemocratic either. And this is why I cannot be a Republican as yet, because the\ndemocrats still, at least show me the belief of life that every American deserves to get,\nand I supported villa myself, all the time.",
        "A: I was terribly disgusted with that era, and all, because here, I saw repetition of\nyesteryears under the Communism, not under Hitler, where people were convicted -- in\nminds you can\u2019t, but in open, to convict them before they even were proven guilty. And\nwe know the old saying in the USA, you\u2019re not guilty until proven. And the McCarthy\nera tried to change all of that around, and thanks God for sane heads, that it existed, that\nthat man was removed, but the laws were not changed to favor him. And I hope that\nlesson serves for always. You prove first that a man 1s guilty, before you make him be\nguilty. And this I believe is the law of humanity, this 1s the law -- a law without justice 1s\nnot -- is not a good law. And this is the j -- this is what it would be, a law without justice,\nyou know what I mean, to let McCarthyism exist. So they just -- you gotta obey the law.\nOf course you\u2019ll have to obey the law, but let us make the laws with justice, so therefore\nthey wouldn\u2019t -- the laws wouldn\u2019t become law under this here circumstance.",
        "A: Okay, okay. I must confess again something. We never sit down per se to discuss that\nera with our kids, because our pain 1s -- is tremendous, and we feel like that we are giving\nanguish and pain to our children, would not be a justified way. As a matter of fact, in a\nJewish way, it\u2019s definitely against that you should not imply anguish on someone else,\nbecause that\u2019s a sin to do. So we never did. But my daughter, for instance, she's a\nprincipal in a school, in a Jewish school for the English parts. She\u2019s got two Masters, and\nshe\u2019s now going for her Ph.D. She learned on -- about the Holocaust scholastically. She\ntakes her schoolchildren to the museum, it used to b -- in Washington, D.C., at least twice\na year, for all the years since. She was also, while her husband was starting law in the\nGeorge Washington University in -- in D.C., she was teaching at Bethesda, Maryland,\nand I had very good accolades about her teaching, from the principal at that time. So I\nmust say, she cared to know, and she found out about it. She rehearsed a lot of times, Elie\nWiesel\u2019s poems and stories, and she is involved in things like that. But on one -- one on\none basis, 1f she would ask us sometimes, would be different, we discussed it, but\notherwise, to say let me tell you how this and that happened, unless they ask, we do not\nmake. With our grandchildren, maybe sometimes, but also in the same way. We would\nnot ahead to get in on the subject. Now, the other part I must tell you 1s, it\u2019s a funny thing\nabout the survivors of the Holocaust, we may come to a party, or we may come to a\nhouse as an invitation for dinner, and maybe it\u2019s baseball season, and you talk about\nwho\u2019s going to be in the pennant, or who\u2019s going to be in the World Series, or it could be\nfootball, and the same conversation at this time. But we will not get in maybe 50 percent\nof the time consumed together, without invoking a part of the Holocaust, without\ninvoking a part of that era. Like, for instance, a lot of our friends are partisans, but it is --\nthat they be -- were in the forest, some hidden in the forest, but some of them are also\nformer concentration camp inmates. We do not make the differentiation. But I noticed\nthat be wherever we come, be to a wedding, or to come to the Days of Remembrance,\nthat past era has never died in us, and we don\u2019t want it to die. I must tell you from the\nstandpoint of doctor, I suffer high blood pressure to this day. And I used to have a doctor\nwho was a Holocaust survivor\u2019s son, and whenever I would come to him to test me, and\nhe would put on the blood pressure on me, so before that, he would go, had -- \u201cSo,\nHarold, did you write to the paper lately?\u201d Or this and that and the other. He sort of\nwould provoke me to the something about this here. All of a sudden he takes my blood\npressure, it\u2019s maybe going to be 190 over 90. \u201cHarold, I want you to lie down, don\u2019t talk\nto anybody, rest up, Ill be back.\u2019 Come back about 10 minutes later, now the blood\npressure would go down. And he\u2019d go with me to -- says, \u201cLook, as a doctor, I must tell\nyou my part, it\u2019s no good for you, because look how much working up you do yourself\nby talking on the issue. However, I would not want you to forget.\u201d So, what I\u2019m trying --\nwhat I\u2019m trying to bring out 1s, the majority of us do not want to forget. We feel it\u2019s a sin\nto forget what we been through, all the atrocities, watching ourselves, our loved ones\nbeing murdered, for no other reason but being born Jewish, which it\u2019s a mark that the\nworld should carry, the new mark of Cain, of the biblical days of Cain and Abel, we\nbelieve biblically that God made a sign on his forehead, and that sign we interpret was to\nbe for people always to remember that he was a people killer. I used to convert this here\ntime through my being in America, before the Holocaust Museum was established, and\nwhile the Holocaust Museum was established, I\u2019d be asking you to give me the time a\nlittle bit more, and I will dwell on it, to make it. Because my analogy was also that the\nmuseums that they were built to -- literally to display all the past what had happened\nduring the Holocaust, is a place of learning for the new people to see about it, that it must\nbe there, because that\u2019s the mark of Cain, that must be to remind those people and tell\nthem, look what it happens at an era where people remain quiet. Where people refused to\ndisagree with bad laws. Where people refused to disagree with bad leaders. That\u2019s the\nera, what you see it happened here. So the museum era, I always make reminission to that\n-- to the mark of Cain, of the same story. I had big fights, on paper. Without being\nprepared to tell you, I cannot tell you the date, but approximately, the date goes back\nabout the number of years, not too many years, where on the newspaper in New York, it\nwas written -- and that was the era of the building of the Holocaust Museum, that there\nwere a group of Jews who were against it, especially the religious part. That rabbi, I don\u2019t\nknow should I mention his name, or not mention his name, I hear him at the same times,\none Sunday on the radio, where he comes out because he was the one of the creators of\nOutreach program, which it means to bring Jewish kids back. But Pll -- Iam not going to\nsay anything other than the facts. His name is Mr. Buchwalt, Ephraim Buchwalt, and he\nand me had for a year\u2019s time, a correspondence, after the article that it appeared in the\nnewspaper in New York, saying the Holocaust is killing the American Jews. Which it\nwas a tremendu -- a tremendous shameful headline to be seen for me, a Holocaust\nsurvivor. I have spoken to Miles Lehrman when he came here to this part, 1n our\nsynagogue, pleading to help about building the -- the museum. I believe every city in the\nworld should have -- not as big, but a little part dedicated to the Holocaust, by way of\nmuseum. That the people should know, and a -- serve as a reminder, every day, what\ncomplacency does to a people. Not to reveal all the rest of the slogans what it is, but\ncomplacency\u2019s what it causes. Fascism, Hitlerism, Nazism, under any schism that you\nwant, complacency happens to do all the bad things, be that it happens in our nearby\ncountries, be that in Haiti for instance, or other countries, where the people are depressed,\nonly because there is a mond of people over there, complacent to what their own has\ndone. So, I carried out a correspondence with this person, and I tried to explain it to him.\nHis article was saying that if this money -- he accused the museum being guilty, or be the\nbuilding, for Jewish pi -- intermarriages, because after all, I gotta take the other side, a\nCatholic child, who is married out of his faith to a Jewish child, the other family feels just\nas broken as this one. So I don\u2019t want to be a one-sided with my analogy what I\u2019m\nmaking over here, but so my answer to him about all the accusations over why this\nmoney should not be spent there, but should be spent on education, was as follows. I said,\nthose people who donated for the building of the museum, were anxious to see the\nmuseum built, for that reason, the mark of Cain. However, if you guys feel like you need\na campaign to raise -- to build more schools, then why don\u2019t you do it? Why do you use\nyour neglect, what you didn\u2019t do yourself, to try to deny a historical event that it must\nexist? I fought with him, one rabbi, for a year. I fought in Chicago with a head man who\nis the publisher of a paper called the Chicago Jewish news, where he came up again,\nwhich it was almost like he read an article, and it came at Yom HaShoah, Remembrance\nDay of the Holocaust, he came out athird of the articles, caught me at a time when I was\nin Chicago, and we were the B\u2019nai Brith, and I was brought -- people know that I write to\nthe papers, people know that I\u2019m vocal, and at the same time, that I will take my time to\nwrite. And I was sended the paper, \u201cHarold, did you see that, he was inter -- to -- they\ninterviewed from the Sun-Times, by this, that, and the other, read it.\u201d I start reading the\nfirst paragraph, I says, \u201cLook, it\u2019s a repetition what I had to do with Rabbi Buchwalt, in --\nwith New York, a few years ago. This man probably got the lesson from him, and he\nmentions in a different form,\u201d after all, thanks God, the American language 1s a very rich\nlanguage with teasers, and so many words that you can use more -- more than one way,\nbut the meaning remains still the same. And I again had to learn -- give him a lesson. Of\ncourse, I saw it Saturday night, and on Monday morning, Harold Zissman, with Sonia his\nwife, were right there, at the office of the printing of that paper, with askening the\nquestions, how dare 1s he to write these kind of words, and so on. Nobody\u2019s asking you to\n-- to donate to that. Nobody\u2019s asking you to come and visit if you don\u2019t want to. So if you\ncannot help anything, don\u2019t knock it at least. And if you knock it, have reasons,\njustifiable, why your side is right. And I had to enter with him with a dialog first, which\nof course the answer was he\u2019s out of town, you can\u2019t see him, Mr. Zissman. I says,\n\u201cOkay, Pll leave my message to him. I\u2019m going to leave tomorrow for Chicago, and I'll\nmail you an article which I hope you print, because I\u2019Il assure you -- I -- I\u2019m preparing\nyou, if you looking for demonstrations, you\u2019re going to have them. Because I, as a\nsurvivor, who fought in the underground, will not live to see the day that Jews will write\nthese kind of things against museums, and against [indecipherable]. If they are bad -- th --\nmasters of their own destiny, how to raise money to build more schools or better schools,\ndon\u2019t blame on somebody else, who did their work diligently, it\u2019s a -- must be done.\u201d\nWell, he printed my article in the paper, no question about it. I had another dialog with\nhim, and another, afterwards there. What I\u2019m trying to say to you, just like the Holocaust\nis not yet understood well, while we are still living, so is the building to prevent the\nfuture from happening definitely still. A lot of people come -- you know what we had\nwith this Holocaust in -- and I was -- I must tell you, although I know him in person, I\nwrote to him, I\u2019m very happy that Miles Lehrman is dismissed. And I hope he doesn\u2019t go\nagainst me with any publications, or anything like that. That man did -- and I wrote to\nhim publicly -- of course, Mr. Birnbaum, he came at that time, to respond to me, which I\nhave it, the letter. Now, another letters, I have a file with letters. And let me explain\nmyself, he did not respond with my question it was, that he had no business mingling in\nwith the Polish government, because he is only the head of this museum, he is not a re --\nhe is not in Madeline\u2019s Albright\u2019s position, he\u2019s not -- you know I mean, the Secretary of\nState, to speak to a foreign about the [indecipherable] 1n Auschwitz, and so on, which it\nwas over there. And the dealings what he started to do. But, it turned up the museum\nalmost to be a political issue, which definitely -- be the Arafat issue, with all of these here\ncases, we must not forget ourselves, as I say, it\u2019s a mark of Abel, it\u2019s a mark of learning,\nbut we cannot let by all means, politicize either the memory, or the place like museums,\nfor any personal use, or personal understanding. Anybody wishes to come to see this\nmuseum is welcome. But to make a dignitary issue, like to make this here because he 1s\n[indecipherable]. I don\u2019t care if the pope would come, and he wants to see Yad Vashem.\nIf he will be there, I assure you, he\u2019s going to be greeted as a pope, yes, but no\npoliticizing issues will ever grow out of that. And the same thing goes for anybody else,\nwhether they are Moslem, whether they are Catholic, or Buddhist, or whatever it is.\nCome and see, what it happened in an era, when people became silent to murder for no\nreason, and no cause, only because by being burn -- born on the wrong side of the street.\nAnd this will be an outspoken thing for me to say when anybody du -- even while it\u2019s a\ngood thing the ma -- the m -- the museum exists. It\u2019s a bad thing of a Mr. Rioch, or any of\nthe other people, over this person. He\u2019s not educated well enough to lead that part -- that\nhe is. But he was a good person politically, to raise money for the party, and so on. And\nthat\u2019s what he got there. I hope, since you\u2019re a young lady, and involved in that, that we\nsee for the future that no politics should ever come between the museum -- the Holocaust\nMuseum, the memorial of these here six million, or if you want to speak for 25 million\nthat were there, to ever let politics take over, and make this a showplace that people\nshould come to politicize. I, as long I can, will always write about it, to whoever the\nparties are, be it Miles Lehrman, be it Rabbi Weiss giving the accolades about it. And I\njust wrote, it\u2019s still not published in the Jewish journal, I wrote to ak -- of course, to give\nhim a kudos for what he tirelessly continued with his campaign, because he exposed all\nthese issues, with a lot of us didn\u2019t know what it was going on. Because you gotta have\nan access, you know what I mean, way to get into that. But in a general term, I must tell\nyou, I was always, and will always be vocal for the rights -- be -- whichever it -- way it\nis. It could be my own brother if -- I wish he would be alive, 1f he would do something\nwrong, I would be vocal about it to say, \u201cYou\u2019re wrong, my brother, you should not have\ndone it, or you di -- shouldn\u2019t have done it that way.\u201d",
        "A: No, Rabbi Weiss writes -- and he 1s in Riverdale if you know, and he carries on -- he\u2019s\nthe head of an organization called Zampa, which it means a folks organization of the\npeople. And he often -- again, I like him, because he was outspoken, all the time. I like\nhim because he went to Auschwitz, although he was accused that he tried to beat the\nnuns, which it was a pure lie. But you see, people like him, like myself, who are not\nafraid to expose your name, or to go to speak out what you really mean, but in the right\nway. That\u2019s the very important thing. I could be right, but I must express it in the right,\nand the proper way, and the same way. He didn\u2019t try to knock anybody down, but he was\nspeaking out for the right. And the rights of those people murdered, laying there, have a\nright at least -- I don\u2019t say it\u2019s gotta be the Magen David, or anything, but they have -- or\nthe eternal light, but have a right not to be converted now, y -- after death, posthumously.\nThere was some Jews who converted, okay, so that\u2019s their business. There are Jews who\nbelieve in Jesus, that\u2019s their business. But let\u2019s not go ahead to make a political issue out\nof an era, as such. We must remember that, and we must fight for it, to see not to let\nothers do. That\u2019s -- that\u2019s always my statement.",
        "A: This poem is headlined, \u201cMy Prayer in Plight of a Dream. The distant forest, with the\nthick bush, swamp, and quicksand, birds chirping, humming to no end, under tall trees\nand trails. Nature\u2019s way to preserve and protect, as everyone\u2019s land. The woodpecker,\nwith his loud noise, building his nest prevails. The crow, with loud, crying flight, as if\ndangerous on the way, to signal the others about the plight in their midst. The robin -- the\nrobins, and b -- and hummingbirds, are all astound to what may, busy with their catch, to\nquench hunger, in view of the beast. A kingdom of their own, all around. How safe could\nit be for me? The fenced ghetto must not be in the way. I must escape now to the forest,\nwith big trees, and bush, birds, beast, insects, danger. Leave family and ghetto behind, a\nplace to fight and hide. Time 1s short, I must decide, the forest is the place to escape. Dear\nGod, grant me those wings of a bird, to fly and be safe, so I could fly from trunk to twig,\nfrom twig to branch. To the forest, to join the fight, not hide, to escape the murder. Oh\nGod, grace me with those wings so I may survive, and be free. Grant me life, to remain\nyour servant, to reveal your grace always. I must be a witness to tell how hell came down\nto earth, to destroy the people of the book. Who\u2019Il be your new children? Must we all\nvanish? We are your children, can\u2019t you grant us life? Why all that murder? No prayer,\nno cry, no plea. Must we all die? Where are you people? Are you going to remain silent\nto murder? I shall fight to survive, tell our sorrow, ask where was man and God?\u201d See, I\nnever speak just to God alone when I\u2019m asking about people coming to tell me, didn\u2019t\nthat bother you to ask the question where was God? And I, my answer has always been\nthe unique answer to say. I don\u2019t know where God is, but I do know where man is, and I\nsee man. So my question was always be, where were man, and then I ask where was God.\nBecause man were visible, and seen. So I cannot unleash my sorrow, and datday to God. I\nstill remain [indecipherable] to man, and his life. To people, and not just to God. So\ntherefore, it could never be misunderstood by my way, the way I see all what had\nhappened, all the sorrow stories to tell, and all the innocent people who were murdered\njust for being born Jewish.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "A: No, I -- at first, we were living like a mansion to you, 1n a basement apartment where\nwe came. Then, when my son was born, and my brother-in-law with us, in 1949, we\ncould no longer live in that apartment, and I had to pay under the table, because\napartments were not available, and it was illegal to charge any higher rent. So that was\nthe means by which way one could get an apartment, is to pay under the table. It was sort\nof like a -- a guy gave that as a donation. That\u2019s what I was asked to say, and to write on\nmy check, that that was a donation, upon this donor, to be given to his famous charity,\nwhatever, he -- he dedicated it to. We moved on Edison Street, which it was more known,\nas about 10 blocks away from Kapp\u2019s park, that we were living there, and there we got on\nthe third floor, a four room apartment, which it was huge by comparison of living in two\nf-- rooms in a b -- in two rooms in a basement apartment. And no air conditioning, of\ncourse, for -- and we had two children. My brother-in-law, at that particular time was no\nlonger with us, because he was drafted to the army. He came to the States late in 48, and\nin \u00b049 with th -- with that outbroke -- break in Korea, he was drafted in the American\narmy, and he, believe it or not, was sent back to Germany, in the same places where he\nwore a -- a -- aS a camp inmate -- I\u2019m meaning as a DP camp inmate, there he was\nserving with the amer -- with the US uniform, as a soldier. Now, when he came back, and\nwe were living still in these four rooms, all of a sudden the four rooms became too small\nfor all of us. So we had to go ahead and try to get another apartment, and times were\nterrible at that time to get another apartment. Each time I looked an apartment with three\nbedrooms, they asked us the question, which it was an infamous item to be asked to\nHolocaust survivors, do you have any kids? That was a painstaking answer. I says, \u201cWhy\nwould I want a six room ap-apartment if I wouldn\u2019t have any kids?\u201d \u201cWell, but we don\u2019t\nwant to rent to little kids that you have with it.\u201d And that I kept on and on til -- I was\nvigorous enough at that time to go ahead and de-decide to buy on my own. I wasn\u2019t ready\nfor a home, so we bought a three flat building, at that particular time, which it was in\nWest Roger\u2019s Park in Chicago, one of the very upcoming, beautiful neighborhoods. And\nwe lived there til our ch -- til my daughter was of the age to go to high school. And at that\nparticular time the run was for Skokie. And in Skokie the high schools were very good,\nand they were upgraded. So my daughter decided that she\u2019d rather go to the high school\nin Skokie, and my son and my daughter both graduated from Skokie High School. And\nwhile in Skokie -- Niles East was the name of the schools. And while in Skokie again, I --\nI became organized in the Jewish community, and I maintained at that time, my\nmembership with the B\u2019nai Brith, and it was the B\u2019nai Brith who really dealt me a bad\ncard at the time, when this -- when the Nazis decided that they want to move in Skokie,\nand being the advice that we got from the B\u2019nai Brith, was very counter to the belief aw -\n- for me as a Survivor, and everybody else. Their advice to us was, \u201cLet them march and\ndo their talking, draw your curtains and don\u2019t mind anything at all. And if they won\u2019t get\nany -- any people to come listening to them, they probable decide not to come.\u201d Our\nadvice was not to listen to these kind of ways, because basically they were not exercising\nFreedom of Speech. They were exercising their hate for one thing, and the threat of our\nlives for the second. Well, we just got freed from all those things, that we had to go\nthrough over again. I already mentioned, I believe, in the former tape, didn\u2019t I? Did I\nmention about the [indecipherable] justice department, I already said it to you on that --\non the tape over here, right?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Okay, PII tell it now. While I belonged, as I said, to the B\u2019nai Brith, in Skokie was the\nfirst chapter we organized to commemorated the name of Janoush Korchuk. Janoush\nKorchuk really was an assimilated Jew, but he was Jewish at heart, and at that particular\ntime, he was living outside of the ghetto, but he moved into the ghetto, and he opened up\norphanage houses, which I believe 1-is -- he\u2019s well documented, even through the United\nNations, and when that Janoush Korchuk, who was a healer, a doctor of philosophy and\neverything, the way he composed those children , who were already orphaned, and he\nwas with them. The day came when they wanted to eliminate the children in the ghetto,\nand it was called upon him to surrender the children from his -- from his home, to the\nNazis. He refused, he says, \u201cWherever my children go, I\u2019m going to go with them.\u201d So\nwhich it means they wanted to grant him life, but he decided rather to face death in the\nsame manner his children. And his way was, \u201cIf I cannot survi -- if my children cannot\nsurvive, there was no use for me to survive.\u201d So that\u2019s a story of importance for everyone\nto remember, and I believe in the realm of B\u2019nai Brith, and Anti-Defamation League, we\nfound the survivors who were living in Skokie, and who were members of B\u2019nai Brith to\nopen up another lodge, and that lodge was named under Janoush Korchuk, which at many\ntimes, on other occasions, I spoke, even on the Days of Remembrance, when I had the\nopportunity to be the spokesman, I mentioned Janoush Korchuk, and his brave actions,\nwhat he did by trying to save the kids, even in the bad days, as it were, to keep them at\nleast human, until the end. And he did not refuse a bit about it. From there on, as I say,\nliving in Skokie and -- and belonging now to this here B\u2019nai Brith lodge, so when the era\ncame about the Nazis wanting to march in Skokie, and threatening our lives, I became\nvery vocal about it. First of all, what I did, it was at city hall on that Monday, which it\nwas a normal meeting, I talked to some guys and told them that we all should gather at\nthe Skokie city hall, and tell them our grievances over why we do not agree to see that the\nNazis come to Skokie. I was the first of the group to be called to speak, and I voiced my\nopinion against it, why we do not have to see and repeat our sufferings to accommodate\nanother group in our society. They could make their venture any time, anyways, I cannot\nstop them from speaking. But why should we allow them to come in our homes, and\ndisobey the law, to go ahead to spill their hate and venom on all of us, against our lives,\nsince we already went through all of that, and became survivors. Must we go through the\nagony again, just to satisfy a segment of people? Why couldn\u2019t they speak on television,\nradio, wherever they want to, but not come and threaten us in our homes, and\nplaygrounds, wherever we live, and raise new children? Words got around, and we got a\nbig crowd at night for the meeting. I was asked a question, from the city hall\ncommissioners, and I was asked, what if we grant them the permit, that -- the meeting\nwas basically to determine whether the city hall will grant a permit to the Nazis to come\nto Skokie. And I was asked what will I do at the time, if the Nazis get the permit, and\nthey come to Skokie. And I politely answered the commissioner at that particular time, I\nsays, \u201cI cannot tell you now what I would do at time of anger. You know, when a person\ngets angry, and an anger of that type, I don\u2019t know, will I grab a stone, will I grab a\nbottle, whatever I will do to throw and disrupt probably, all of that.\u201d He says, \u201cWell, you\nknow, it\u2019s against the law to do it.\u201d I says, \u201cIt\u2019s -- in my ways of life, it\u2019s against the law\nfor me to re-live the agony one more time, Commissioner. So I hope you, as the\nlawmaker and obeyer, can see that we survivors here, and for that matter, anybody we --\nwho is not a survivors, have to go through the agony of being threatened with their lives,\nby these group of mugs, and people, who call themselves the neo-Nazis.\u201d Well, needless\nto say that they did pass the law, the attorneys advised them that it must be -- go ahead\nand granting in the law, with the rights of the Second Amendment of Free Speech. Well,\nnow we had to get re-organized again, we opened up our office, and began to get ads in\nthe paper. Skokie became so public that we -- people from Africa, people from Australia,\nwherever [indecipherable] everybody was granting us the courage for we doing it, and\ngave us the moral support, and even offered financial support, whatever it may take. We\nmastered to come out on the Phil Donohue show, at that particular time, in public. And it\nwas a -- from the Civil Liberties Union, a man, Goldberger, which he was Jewish, who\nwas the one defending them. My question to him was, does his heart allow him -- and his\nconscience, to go, to protect this bloody era of Jewish annihilation? Of course, Phil\nDonohue didn\u2019t let me get close. He didn\u2019t let me. But I, with my persistency, did not s-\nsuccumb to him not letting, and out of place, I yelled long enough til he had to come with\nthe microphone to me, to be heard. My daughter, at that particular time, was living in\nFlorida already, and she called me afterwards, \u201cOh, Daddy, I saw you -- I saw you on\ntelevision. You\u2019re still fighting, looks like to me.\u201d That was her words to me. I says,\n\u201cYes, my dear, my fight did not end, obviously. I didn\u2019t think that I'll have to fight, but I\nmust rise up again and fight again. That menace has got to get done with.\u201d That was my\nanswer to her. Our fight, as I say went on; meeting -- meetings used to take place at\ntimes, evenings to last til one o\u2019clock in the morning. And we had various plans of how\nto start. There was even at one time a plan that we actually wanted to attack their base,\nwhat they had on the south side of Chicago. But after big pleas by attorneys, who were in\ntouch with us, from the establishment of Jewish organizations, and the B\u2019nai Brith kept\nappealing the same thing, draw your curtains and don\u2019t come. That\u2019s the best that they\ncould offer for us, which by all means, I had to tell some B\u2019nai Brith people, \u201cNow I see\nwhy you did not act out against the situation when we were being murdered.\u201d I says,\n\u201cBecause that\u2019s your only solution, draw your curtains, and don\u2019t look. And then the\nsame thing goes, put something in your ears, and you don\u2019t listen, or you don\u2019t hear. We\ncannot succumb to that menace,\u201d I said. And we organize groups all the time, and see\nwhat the plide could do. The Jewish establishment in Chicago, with the lawyers who\nvolunteered to our help, suggested that we are to see 1 -- 1 -- Springfield, Illinois, the state\ncapital, and we must inaugurate another law, that since freedom of speech must be given\nto them -- we tried to fight, that yes they can come, even to Skokie and speak, but they\ncannot wear these Nazi uniforms. We made an appearance there, and my appearance\nunwillingly, was very successful, because I really brought out the call of freedom, I really\nbrought up today meet was exactly on D-Day, where all my compatriots, who were\nspeakers, and former soldiers, and fighters and commanders, did not have the audacity to\nremember the day it was. I, however, the pain was too fresh on me to forget D-Day,\nbecause D-Day meant a big time for us at that particular time to see that. An-And things\nlike that, you just don\u2019t forget, or mete out of the calendar. And I was, after all, became\nrenown -- known. We had a lot of gatherings going on, and at one time, we wanted to\nstate our case, so in the JCC, we were divided in three speakers. We had a speaker from\nthe Holocaust survivors who was an inmate in the concentration camp. I was the one who\nrepresented the partisans, and resistance, and there was --",
        "A: Well, Rosensweig was one of the speakers, which he was -- his wife was later\npresident, who she was representing those Jews who were in -- in -- in Russia. Our\npresident\u2019s -- I must say, our late president, at that time, which she was a woman, and she\nwas very vocal about the issues, she was very much in-involved. Her name is Erna\nGense, and she was talking in regard, or rather, representing the inmates of the\nconcentration camp. I, Harold Zissman, was taking part, speaking about resistance in the\npartisans. And we were very successful, the room was filled with people, and questions,\nwhile we only were thinking it\u2019ll be an hour to two hours, it was after three hours that we\nhad to call a halt to the meeting, and call it for continuance of every day. Another thing\nwe organized about, that was all to lightening the situation of [indecipherable]. I had,\nafter that, one student that he was studying in medical school, but he was a Jewish boy,\ninterested in Jewish history, that he asked me if he could come to my house, and I will\ngive him on tape all my story, why and what, when -- no more than we discussed it. He\ncame to my house, and made a few tapes, and afterwards he says, \u201cHarold, I don\u2019t know\nhow you survived, but I cannot listen to it.\u201d He says, \u201cIt was too much.\u201d I says, \u201cThat\u2019s\nthe part of perseverance, and that\u2019s the part of endurance. If you want to go on to live,\nyou cannot surrender easily. You must keep your fight to the bitter end, just like I\ndescribed in some of my poems, as it was.\u201d Anyways, the other organization what we\ndid, we decided on the Sabbath to send various groups to go to synagogues, bring out our\nsituation on the pulpit, over why our dissatisfaction 1s with the Nazis do -- who want to\nmarch. We are trappened, and all of us are trappened. We know that we don\u2019t want to\nhave any -- any bad situation, maybe turning into riots, or whatever it is, where it could\nthreaten the business community. So therefore, for all things concerned, the best thing 1s,\nby which ever way we can derive, that it should be legal and official to stop that march\nfrom coming, because at that particular time, the Jewish Defense League, which it was\nvery famous in New York, joined us, and they wanted to become a party with us, to join\nin the fight against the Nazis. So, when the joish -- the -- the Jewish League came to us,\nthe joining, 1t was a more scare on the merchants in the area, because now they knew\nwith the Jewish Defense League around, that definitely hostilities will ic -- incur in the\nneighborhood. So, we ask what can we do about 1t? Anyways, by that time, the law\npassed in -- in -- in Springfield, and 1t was passed, but it was afterwards challenged, that\nit was illegal that this, in itself, the uniform in itself was declared also part of speech, and\nwe cannot stop it. Well, be that 1t was right, be that it was wrong, maybe the legal heads\nthat we had trying to help us were not the greatest, and the best, but it\u2019s a known factor\nthat American people, including the Jews, do not ever want to see a change in the Second\nAmendment of Free Speech. I perhaps feel the same way, but it\u2019s too hard for me to\nsuccumb to the idea that Free Speech, and threatening of life should be one and the same,\nand therefore granted immunity for that reason. That\u2019s why, until this day outspoken, that\nit was justified for us to stop them. However, be for what it\u2019s worth, that it did occur in\nChicago later, that we were denied our law, and they came out to speak, but we started\nthe same thing, as I said, we were throwing rocks, and eggs, and whatever you wanted,\nand the only thing it lasted for about three -- two minutes, or four, and they were -- had to\nbe run out. The fact remains that later on we found out that those neo-Nazis were\ninvolved in so many lawbreaking things that they did. We found out the head of a Mr.\nCollins, that he was involved with -- with sexual things, involved -- and he was brought\nto court -- o -- justice, and he was jailed later. Which it proves, no more, and no less like\nHitler and his gang, they were all not law abiders, but law breakers, but we granted the\nfreedom. And of course, I was -- 1t was interpreted to us to tell this 1s the democracy in\naction, that a -- that we must be listening to everybody who wants to speak. Yes,\nlistening to whatever we want to speak. But listening to someone who threatens my life,\none day I hope, will be separated from Freedom of Speech, because it\u2019s the same as\nyelling fire in a crowded movie house, which this is not Freedom of Speech. And we\ncontinued our fight later, while I already aforementioned being in the -- speaking for the\njustice committee, and as I said, the law passed, and we again had a fight on our hands.\nNo matter what itch we tried -- we stopped it. It was the fact to show what had happened.\nWe were stopping that we shouldn\u2019t any more tal -- go to let them demonstrate, so the\ncity hall, and it\u2019s legal people advised, and devised an issue [indecipherable] prohibited,\nthose people living in the neighborhood mind you, were prohibited to go out in that area\nwhere the Nazis, if it comes to pass that they will come to speak, so 1t means we were\ntaken the laws of freedom away from us, that we could not go walk in that perimeter,\nwhile they, under the protection of the law, will be guided to let them come in and\nspeech. Well, that\u2019s a good lesson to prove what Freedom of Speech means. I agree with\nit, but I don\u2019t agree at the cost of another part of the public, to be denied the laws. I\nbelieve something over there was not -- acting wrong. And we -- we mustered a lot, and\nsince the Civil Liberties Union were protecting the Nazi so much, we decided we must hit\nthem where it hurts, in their pockets. Our campaign continued, and we broke them\nactually, that they did not have enough contributions, and you know, the legal people are\nvery -- trying to legal, but they wanted money for their time, and looks like they had to\nabandon the whole thing. That\u2019s why, in sko -- in Skokie, they couldn\u2019t muster up and\ncome to march. But in Chicago, around city hall, even if it only lasted for two minutes,\nand the amount of money that it cost the city to allow that to happen, between the police,\nextra time, and extra vigilance that it -- they needed, was ext -- was a tremendous\namount. I\u2019m glad to hear that it never happened, another case like that, over there. In\nFlorida a few times, there were also marches by the neo-Nazis, but they were done in a\ndifferent way. They didn\u2019t go to the height of Collings, and his gang. There were\ndifferent ways with them. And it was on one side the Nazis, and on the other side was the\nanti-Nazis, us. And we protested in loud ways, not to let them be heard, over hel -- and\nthen it was all over. So, the means to say 1s, it happened, but never did it reveal itself to\nbe a case like in Skokie, because over there was the hard core of survivors, and that\u2019s\nwhat they wanted, and they almost -- almost won the battle to come and speak, but we\nprohibited them.",
        "A: It\u2019s a good question you made, and I\u2019m glad that you asked it in a way, because the\nmovie of Skokie did not bring it out. There was no deception, but before long, it was so\npoliticized, the issue, that it was unbelievable. I had over there, amongst us, as I\nmentioned before, the Jewish Defense League. Before long, it took a lon -- I took a look,\nsome Communists were also trying to join us, and by all means, we did not want to have\na part of no red flag, no this here. So this was the bad part, in part, dissension, no, but\njoiners, of various opinions, which definitely was not in our way, we found to -- to -- to\nbe the case.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, I was a part member of his congregation, because I belonged to another\ncongregation. I always belonged someplace. As a matter of fact, our B\u2019nai Brith\nmeetings, still to this day today, take place on Main Street, in se -- in Skokie central, as\nwe call it, where Rabbi Montrose, still, God willing, presides as the rabbi. The rabbi was\na very vocal helper now, of course, and as I forementioned, we went to synagogues, too,\nand the -- Skokie\u2019s central synagogue was all with the help we needed to be granted.",
        "A: They had a letter cam -- writing campaign to B\u2019nai Brith, and our words was, if you\ncannot help us, don\u2019t hurt us. In other words, it\u2019s too bad that you interpret it one way,\nand we see it the other way. To us it\u2019s Freedom of Speech, yes, but however, threatening\nour life is no freedom. So I believe B\u2019nai Brith does -- wouldn\u2019t like to see that way,\neither. And we asked them, just stay neutral and leave us -- leave us alone, because you\nadvised us not -- make us comfort. You make comfort to the enemy instead of making us\ncomfortable about it. And I didn\u2019t resign from being a member of B\u2019nai Brith, because\none bad issue does not make you to turn against Anti-Defamation League, because that\u2019s\nwhat we was trying to claim it. We are being a -- defamed over there, and you -- you\npermission, what you are saying, is let defamation take place, while you trying to say\ndraw your curtains. You know what I mean, or sort of shut your ears, you don\u2019t hear. But\nthat is not the way to handle a situation like that. And thanks God that later on, B\u2019nai\nBrith, I believe, is becoming more mature about some of these situations, and they realize\nthat it was not the right thing to answer to us, just draw your curtain, because as a whole,\nB\u2019nai Brith did lose some members also, in the same way. I didn\u2019t -- you know, our lodge\nstill remained very viable, and everything like that, but you know, a lot of other people\ndid not want to just register the mildness to the resolution, as we did, and they just\nabsolutely resigned, and it was hard to bring them back in there.",
        "A: As I said, I\u2019m all for the First Amendment. Ill go to fight, if I have to, to survive -- for\nthe First Amendment to survive. However, we must literally understand, that threatening\nof life is not a First Amendment right to be treated under Freedom of Speech. We must\nmodernize it, if needed, we must amend things in it, but that cannot -- should not be. We\ndon\u2019t know when, tomorrow, when another branch of these hating groups will come up.\nWe know what it happened in Memphis, we know what it happened with all. But the\nJews were on the side to help the Black people, and can you imagine that anybody\u2019s\ngoing to tell me that it was a matter of Free Speech? No, it was not a matter of Free\nSpeech, it was a matter plain, they wanted to kill, they wanted to destroy, and killing and\ndestruction happened. We know just recently, only a year ago, what it happened in\nChicago, with the things that it happened against synagogues. We know the things that it\nhappened there in schools. You see, this is all the outgrowth for people who harbor\nthemselves under the First Amendment right to speak, with right to hate, okay we -- we a\n-- | know the ADL was very helpful in these cases, to pass laws against hate -- law. But\nit\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s a different situation between hated laws, and that causes them to be violent, or\nto come and trap them, openly. Neo-Nazis do not come others -- under any other\nauspices, but threatening the life of the Jews wherever they are. And we must learn how\nto separate, so yes, I am pro-Second -- th-the Amendment, the way it was written,\nFreedom of Speech, but as I said it, and I cannot reveal it again, how many times I say,\nthat threatening of life, must be put -- it will take an extra amendment to it, just like the\nhate law was passed, it must pass this part of the hate law, whatever it is, that people\u2019s\nlives cannot be threatened by any group, by any ways.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, to the contrary, I felt very much American at the time. I know in the Civil War,\nwe just didn\u2019t throw slogans, and won. It took blood almost, and fighting. Thanks God\nthat we did not have to shed any blood in order to do things like that. So no, never will I\nbe isolated from the American freedom of law. However, in all my life that God gives me\nto live, I will fight for freedom with justice. I cannot afford to let my mind or soul\nseparated one from the other. There is no freedom if there is no justice. So be that justice\nmeans that it was not for -- not letting Jews, or Blacks move into a certain neighborhood,\nor be sitting in the back of a bus. Be to the same thing is, when I am denied certain laws,\nwhatever it has to be, that 1s not justice in these laws. So I hope that we remember the\nimportance. Freedom must be with justice. Freedom without justice is not total freedom.",
        "A: Okay, I -- first of all, let me touch, before I go to this here, I must put it in, I want to\nthank the people, Mr. -- Mr. Garber, what his name was, the producer of Skokie. Burger,\nMr. Burger was his name of the producer, for producing that movie. I believe, as time\ngoes on, it will remain a vocal part of the history of Skokie. The mayor of Skokie, we\ntook at that time to Israel on a trip, he\u2019s no longer around -- the former mayor that it was\nat the time. But it was a historical event, and I\u2019m gla -- happy and glad, that someone\ntook the time and efforts, even the financial cost, to bring it into light. At the same time, I\nwant at this time, to thank all the other people, 1-including those who pro -- made the\nmovie of \u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\u201d including -- I forgot his name.",
        "A: Yeah. Including Mr. Spielberg, who gave so much efforts, and money of his cost, to\nbring these programs, even -- even part what he is paying for in the Holocaust museums,\nto bring the story of the survivors of the Holocaust, for posterity, so some students of\ntomorrow can learn what it was done wrong in our time, and in our era, so it shall not\nrepeat itself again. When the Eichmann story, which you asked me, took place, I was\nvery carefully watching it on the TV. And it proved that the bitter end, that instead of him\nasking forgiveness for the injustice that he carried out, much more than the law of\nNuremberg asked him to do, he stand fast to protect the Nazi era, and he\u2019 ll, to the last\nday, and to the last moment of that trial, stood with his opinion that it was right to do\nwhat he does. Which it proves it to you, the freedom, and the democracy, given to a\nmurderer like this here, was given by the state of Israel. And, at the same time, of other\npeople, we know the case what it happened, it proved the case in point, after the case of\nEichmann, then the case of Demjanjuk was brought to Israel. And Israel believed in the\nfairness of the law in judicial way. Even though he was proving that in Trawniki, he was\nserving, in spite that he was not even th-the -- even grossly -- even th-the hater, but he\nwas there in the schools. So seeing as they did not have the total accuracy missing to the\njustice of the Israeli court, to condemn him, or to sue him for whatever it is, they much\nrather for letting him go free instead of condemning perhaps, in the mind of the -- of the\njudges to condemn a s -- a person who was not guilty in the case. Now, here is a big\nimportance for Israel law to be predominant, and all the world to take, that they believe in\nthe old saying -- in the Communist era, as well as the Fascist era through the Nazis,\nthey\u2019d rather kill a hundred people to find one guilty, while this way, when laws arvee\njustice, you\u2019d rather let a hundred people free, instead of condemning one people -- one\nperson who is not fully guilty. That it couldn\u2019t prove the guilt on him. I am proud to hear\nthese things.",
        "A: Well, American people have haters, like all other countries of the world. We know\nBuchanan for instance, who are the defender of Demyjanjuk, and we know the ta -- at the\ntail end of it, that demyjan -- that Buchanan told his way of the war, and everything, that\nhe claims America did wrong, by coming to help diminish the Nazi era. So this question\nis a self centered to understand the -- for every American just to say, look in the mirror\nand see yourself. When we could have a man who was in the era, working with President\nReagan, to come out with a book the way he was written, so it\u2019s a very sordid on the\nAmerican people, because thanks God that we don\u2019t have many Buchanans around, so we\ncan still call ourselves a country of loving freedom, but not with this type of freedom that\nMr. Buchanan would like to see going on in this country. As a whole, I believe the\nAmerican people I never could condemn. I can only say not many American people are\ninvolved in the political systems, and they -- if they don\u2019t take a part in it, it\u2019s basically\nbecause they -- they cannot be participant without knowing cases. And they don\u2019t take\nthe time to learn it, they feel so free that we don\u2019t have to. But to preserve our freedom,\nwe must be participants 1n all these here political eras.",
        "A: I had a few cases where I had to send my cases to the Anti-Defamation League. In\nmost cases, when I ever wrote an article dealing with the Holocaust, or for instance when\nthe pope was visiting the USA at that time, and I reminisced in my article to the paper\nthat he was a young pope -- not pope, but he was a young preacher, at that time in Poland,\nand living in that era, he should know what the Hitlerites did to us, and I was speaking\nout against Pope Pius, not against him. I, as a matter of fact, went through in Israel with\nYad Vashem, to make a study of that era, and the whole world knows the secret that the\nVatican helped all these here criminals filter through Spain, and other places like this\nhere. But it\u2019s the funny thing, when you bring it out in the open, some people don\u2019t like\nto hear it, because to them, the word of a holy man, or the pope, is becoming a s -- a\nsacred item, and -- and whatever they say 1s right. That\u2019s how all these problems in the\nworld, through many years, without questions asked, had happened. Because the public\njust wanted to believe one story, and not hear the other side of that story. And I\u2019m afraid\nfor that type of thinking. So when I had to speak out, and it\u2019s not pleasing to others, I\u2019m\nsorry to say that, let him tell them -- let him prove that I\u2019m wrong, and it\u2019s another story.\nBut at any time my articles appeared in letters to the editor, so on, hate mail came to my\ndoors, with threatening, and the same way. And the ADL explained it to me, that because\nthese people are watching those letter writers to the editor, and at any time, they put on\nall this here kind of paraphernalia.",
        "A: I feel safe, for the time being. But as I said, when you become, in a c -- situation like\nthat, that you\u2019re so satisfied and pleased, that you don\u2019t look on the other side, it\u2019s very\ndangerous. So to say, or to foretell what might happen, first of all, I\u2019m not a prophet,\nsecond of all, I\u2019m a believer. I hope the younger people of today make it their business to\nbecome participants, be of the political system which -- what is going on, and become\nvocal. Don\u2019t keep this story to yourself, it\u2019s not a story to be hidden, it\u2019s a story to be\ndiscussed in public. I\u2019m very happy in my days, that I discussed certain things on college\nlevels, and high schools, that I spoke to them, and I\u2019m always open for the invitation\nwhen invited. As a matter of fact, I invited myself a few times to go in colleges where\nthey teach now the Holocaust story, which it became a part of the curriculum to teach,\nwhich I hoped that would have happened so many years ago, Hitler would have never\nbeen able to come. We see what it happens in Austria, with Haider right now. Look how\nit shook up the whole world, you know what I mean, just about letting this party come.\nSo I\u2019m very -- I feel very good that people get awakened these days, by any outbursts of\nthis nature. But to say that I feel safe, yes, but am I secured for the future what it be? I\ncannot foretell the future, I wish I could, and I would be able to answer that in another\nway.",
        "A: And vigilant, and vigilant --",
        "A: That was my --",
        "A: From the first day of my life that I survived. I couldn\u2019t speak about it in the ire --\nunder the Iron Curtain, needless for me to say, it would have been a foolish statement,\neven to make. So I will not tell you that I did, but as soon I got away from that curtain,\nmy mind was open, and I spoke about it, and when I came to the USA, like I said, in\n1948, I became a participant right away to organizations, until I did not get my\ncitizenship, I didn\u2019t want to make public some of the things, because let\u2019s just remember\nlike the question you asked me before, the era of McCarthyism, and just think back, \u201948.\nIn 1948, if you were in Soviet Union, you were right away a question mark, you know\nwhat I mean? So to tell you honestly, yes I was watching myself not to get caught in a\nbad web, because to defend oneself is not an easy situation. So, after I became a citizen, I\nbecame vocal immediately, and with every era, whatever time it happened, that I was\nspeaking of. And it didn\u2019t hurt me a bit that I had to disagree with B\u2019nai Brith, you know,\nbecause writing I did. I wrote to Mr. Foxman a few -- on a few occasions, and I became\nknown, looks like, to some papers, that as soon they see my name under the article, they\ndon\u2019t print it at ttmes. And I played a trick on the -- on a few of them, that I used another\nname, with my address, and to prove my point, they printed it. Which it means, it\u2019s not so\nmuch that they care for the story, but they care who writes it. And I wish it would be\ngood they would care for the other writers, who write the opposite, to be watching\nthemselves, but unfortunately, there, they\u2019re afraid maybe they can go ahead to touch on\nthe Free Speech amendment, where refusing me there is always ways, and how do they\nsay? We cannot let you write unless six months elapsed since the lax letters today. Of\ncourse, I\u2019m not a hired hand, I\u2019m just a letters to the editor writer, you know? So, of all\nkinds of ways, that\u2019s one of the items. I was told by the press, for instance, from the --\nfrom West Palm Beach, says, \u201cYou eve -- don\u2019t even live here.\u201d And that was the\npublisher had that. I says, \u201cMust one live over there to write an letter to the editor?\u201d So,\nexperiencing this through the years, I had the opportunity where I pass by, at one time\nwriting to -- in Texas to a paper, responding on something. And I was -- was writing with\na -- with a clergyman of high esteem, that the church didn\u2019t like too well, but we found a\ncertain view, something in common, which it was the billing between Hanukah and\nChristmas, and we corresponded quite awhile. So to me, teaching about hopeful ways,\nabout unifying people, about freedom loving people to be together, will always be a\nsubject to talk about, it does not have to be Nazis, it does not have to be neo-Nazis, or any\nof the -- like that. I love to converse with people, but above all, I will never sacrifice the\nfreedom of democracy for anything else. That\u2019s one thing I cannot live by, or have any\nreason.",
        "A: Yup.",
        "A: I can conceive in a good, open mind, that what had happened to me with the riots, I\ndid not pluralize ever to say Black people, this, that and the other. Because in every\nsituation that it happens, it\u2019s going to be two sides to the story. My side of that story\u2019s a\n[indecipherable]. My store did not have just all Black, but I would say there were two\nbutchers, which they were white, and the other butchers, two of them were Black. The\nrest of the store, all my employees were Black, from management capacity, which at that\nparticular time -- so, in other words, [indecipherable] to the era why the riots broke out in\nChicago, because of the killing of Martin Luther King. My store should not be actually\nsuffering anything like that. But this is again, as I told you, freedom without justice does\nnot work, therefore, because innocent people get hurt. I consider myself that I was not the\nparty that had to get hurt, but maybe to say I was in the wrong neighborhood, and\ntherefore I got hurt because of that. So, many times when I interviewed for jobs, I didn\u2019t\nhesitate telling my background, what I did, and the first question would come, under the\ncircumstances that you\u2019ve been through, you obviously are prejudiced against Black. I\nsays, \u201cNo, I am not prejudiced against Black, I\u2019m prejudiced against wrongdoing.\u201d I\nbelieve in people demonstrate for a cause. Making riots and looting, is wrong. Regardless\nthat I wasn\u2019t the only one hurt, but that is not the way to spread an issue. So be that it\nhappened to me in 1968, with that other issues happened to other people in other times,\ntwo wrongs never made one right, and that\u2019s exactly what it is. While they are trying to\nwrong the wrongs, and trying to make them right, it\u2019s no use to follow in the fli -- same\nfootsteps, to make another wrong. So, to say that I\u2019m prejudiced, no, I do not see a Black\nperson other than I see myself in that regard. I respect him, and I would always hope that\nI'll be respected by them. I didn\u2019t run into any circumstances other than that, or because\nof that, but when you go -- I went another time, and reopened another store, and when\nthings began to change to the bad, when my store began to be broken into, and all of\nthese here things, I saw a repetition of that, yes, I went out. I made a going out of\nbusiness sale, and I went away from that neighborhood all together. Because I cannot be\nwatching times from changing. Times will change whether I watch it or not. So I figured,\nit\u2019s the wrong place for me to be, and I went out of there, that\u2019s all. I became a -- an\noutdoor salesman, I couldn\u2019t re-establish myself back in the retail business, because my\nfortune didn\u2019t go along with me, in other words, at the same time, I lost too much,\ninsurance companies of that era went broke because of that, so I was just an innocent\nvictim. Yes, I feel bad that it happened. Yes, I can ask questions, why did it happen to\nme? Maybe to say I didn\u2019t deserve to happen to me. It affects [indecipherable], it\nhappened. Now, I have two ways of looking at it. Do I look with more hatred? Seems I\u2019m\ntrying to define that I\u2019m against hatred, so it would be the ca -- same thing that I justify\nall the bad things that ever happened to me, that they are right. So that does not let me,\nand that\u2019s why those interviews for jobs, when they ask me that question, realize that I\ncan pass the test, that I am not a hate type of person. I was sitting next to Jesse Jackson,\nnext to me at the time when we worked together about stopping the Nazis from marching.\nWe were joining forces at that time, and I believe they, in many a -- things, what the\nBlack people want to see, any other minority wants to see the same way. And I hope it\u2019s\nclarified. I heard just recently in New York, and the things, what it was pulled out, with\nthe four policemen, please do not make riots, do not make break-ins, and I say Mr.\nSharpton was right, and I was happy to hear him say these words, because ideals cannot\nmix with violence. When you produce violence with ideals, the ideals get lost.",
        "A: Yeah, so this is the idea about it. I\u2019m a true believer in these things, even if I pay\ndearly for it, but everybody knows that with -- just to speak, and one way, it happens to\nsomeone else, and you speak -- in other words, when it happens to you, it\u2019s not wrong,\nit\u2019s not wrong. It\u2019s not right to be like that, you can\u2019t -- it\u2019s a good saying that it goes\naround. When one\u2019s husband -- when your neighbor\u2019s husband 1s laid off from work, it\u2019s\na recession, but when the husband from this house is laid off, then it\u2019s a depression. And\nthat\u2019s the same thing, I mean, two wrongs, no matter how many times we tried it, will\nnever prove to be right. So, no, I did not remain prejudiced due to the circumstances, it\nhappened to me. And again, even though I\u2019m hateful to the Nazis, I\u2019m not hateful to the\nGermans. As a matter of fact, last time I was in Israel was in June of 1998, and I was in\nthe company near us, 40 percent of the gatherings at [indecipherable] were Germans,\nwell, they were young German people, with the children of the same -- they were the ages\nof my own children. I spoke to them, I didn\u2019t feel threatened, I didn\u2019t feel any animosity\ntowards them. Yes, their parents, their grandparents were involved in all of that, as Mr.\nGoldhagen said, but this is my statement. I can speak German to a young person, and be\nhappy to speak, and that I know how to address them and speak. But I cannot speak to a\nperson who\u2019s older than me, or my age, because that -- that language that\n[indecipherable] all of this here, yelling, and [indecipherable] was only the way to\nconfuse the Jews, and -- and make them -- first strip them from rights, then strip them\nfrom anythings that they could, be that it\u2019s food, and they really -- killed out the\nintelligentsia first, so we were people that it was not enough left of the intelligentsia, nor\nenough left of -- in us, to be able to resist, and that\u2019s why we didn\u2019t resist in as many ---\nmore than it should have been. Besides, the population was not that open to help us, but\nthey would help the others, you know? When their kids were taken to Germany, and they\ndidn\u2019t like it, they helped the partisans, because they ca -- had where to escape. But Jews,\nthey didn\u2019t. Let\u2019s remember, the Germans put a price, to catch a Jew was worth a pig, and\nto catch a partisan was worth a horse, if he was Jewish. So they always had a price.\nThat\u2019s how we -- the -- the way of killing was so glamorized that it wasn\u2019t just the\nkilling. How much they can first give him all kinds of punishment, until he wished to be\ndead, that was the enjoyment to kill them. But they -- but in the partisans, when I caught\nsome Germans, to the police -- from the policeman [indecipherable] from that time, they\nwere begging for mercy. Please don\u2019t kill me. And it was a case, which in my manuscript\nI described. When we caught once that he was from the sondenfuehrer, and a girl that\n[indecipherable], he pulled out from his pocket pictures. He did not know whether we are\nJews, or other things, and he thought he would show us pictures of Jewish girls that he\nhas in his pocket, we do not know how these pictures came to be, and why he took them\nfrom the Jewish girls. Because that was their pleasure place, which they would take good\nlooking girls, take them in there, and use them, you follow me, sexual. So, this girl,\nseeing these pictures what he pulled out, she says, \u201cHarold, step it aside, this is all mine.\u201d\nAnd she didn\u2019t [indecipherable] on him, she smashed his head til he was dead. So I mean,\nit\u2019s a lot of things to understand about an era, be that it\u2019s resistance, be trying to w-w-way\nto resist, which people fail to understand what it was, the era at that time, what an era it\nwas to survive. But one thing I must comment over here, no matter how bad it was, the\nrate of suicides, as history will record, was very little. In other words, people just wanted\nto live, to outlive the enemy, no matter how miserable they lived, while living, it still -- it\nwas very easy, you disobey, and you shot, and you\u2019re dead. Didn\u2019t have to do any\nthreatening things. If you would die -- but people no, they wanted -- that\u2019s what it wa --\nthat was their expression of resistance, which I like to comment over here about the\nresistance. In 1983, in the gathering in Israel was, we got up about 5,000 partisans. The\nSoviet Union let out their partisans to come to Jerusalem to show in the strong -- we\nalmost mustered almost 5,000 people. which the medal that I showed you, that I got from\nthe state of Israel, is hanging over there. Anyways, at that particular time, that we got that\ntogether, one of the spokesman was a lady, a professor, her name was Kattan. The name\nKattan in Hebrew means short, small, and she was short, she was a small lady, but her\nwords were big. And she once told us, and she knows she\u2019s speaking at a gathering of\nfreedom fighters if you want to say, or resisters. She asked the question to us, how would\nyou describe yourself, what you did in the forest as resistance? One picked up his hand\nand he says, \u201cI killed so many Germans.\u201d Another picked up his hand, and he talked\nabout other things, what he did against the Germans. He [indecipherable] down so many\ntrains. The other one was doing -- and doing other diversionary work. She says, \u201cDo you\nconsider all of that, what? Fighting the enemy, or you consider that resistance?\u201d And\neverybody came out, it\u2019s one and [indecipherable]. She says, \u201cNo, resistance means if\nyou resisted the enemy for one more day to live while he wants to annihilate you. For one\nmore hour, for one more longer, that is resistance.\u201d The wire fences round all the camps\nelectrified. You could throw yourself against the fence any time, but few people threw\nthemselves against the fences. That in itself was resistance. Be that you had a machine\ngun, that you went openly in warfare -- ways, to fight and resist the enemy, or that you\nwithstand in that concentration camp, or that labor camp, or in the ghetto, that you\nsurvived an extra day to -- to give the enemy a loss that he didn\u2019t win yet, that is\nresistance. I think I want to inject [indecipherable] in this conversation at the same time,\nwe must learn, and very much be vigilant when we resist certain thing in our democratic\nway, and above all, I\u2019ll say it one more time, we must always fight for freedom, and laws\nwith justice. If you don\u2019t have justice in it, we just don\u2019t have our fulfillment of freedom.",
        "A: Go ahead.",
        "A: I believe, if you remember, I told you the story, when I came to Bialystok, and I met a\nfriend of mine, and he told me that one returned there, and got killed right away. I cannot\nreturn back to Poland, and see that -- the ground there. I must invoke here the story of the\n14\" century [indecipherable] As we all know, the Inquisition [indecipherable] history of\nwhat it was. You -- if you wanted to become Christian, you had life, if you didn\u2019t want,\nthey expelled you. On the ships of expulsion, at that particular time, the rabbis of the era\nwho were there, with all that creation, they created this [indecipherable] which a lot of\nJudaism was created. They put out sort of a restriction order, that forever after, no Jew\nshall dwell in Spain. To me, that evendoor Franco, who let the Jews escape 1n the -- the\nNazis come to Spain, while Hitler bitterly protested it, but Hitler could not afford to go\nand fight Franco, you know, for what he did. A story, I must tell you that story in my\nmanuscript, I would like to show this, now that you mention, but what I wanted to bring\nout is, we did not have enough intellectual people, even including Elie Wiesel, who wrote\na lot of work, and more like Elie Wiesel, that they did not insert that we cannot return\nback to these places of se -- of cemeteries. In Judaic law we provide a saying, that you\ncannot dwell on a cemetery, just like we are told with Egyptian people in Cairo live on\nthe cemeteries, because of shortage of room. The cemeteries are created for dead people,\nand not for leef -- live people to live there. To us, the biggest cemeteries of the world\nwere left in these European countries, and the biggest one in Poland. Therefore, Judaic\npeople are forbidden to dwell there. But we did not have enough of the clergy to dwell on\nthat issue, and to make it public. To people who come back, and everyone who comes\nback, who didn\u2019t live in that era, but lives in today\u2019s era, and they come back, and when\nyou talk to them, they have only one thing to say, the anti-Semitism in Poland is very\nvisible, and it\u2019s very open. Even though Israel is dealing with the Polish people. Even\nthough Israel is letting in Polish people to come to Israel, and everything else. Look, anti-\nSemitism is a disease, and no more like certain diseases are incurable, for the time being,\nwe haven\u2019t found a cure for that anti-Semitism. Should I say that the religion fed into\nthese people is part, if not fully the declaration of anti-Semitism? Perhaps, maybe it\u2019s one\nof it. But anti-Semitism, we must take it as a disease, and cure as a disease, because we\ncannot say, \u201cOh, you shouldn\u2019t say that,\u201d this and that. We see -- I say we -- we see these\nthing -- people in the open, we see what these people are doing, and the anti-Semitism 1s\nstill alive. So, I said I\u2019ll tell you a little story about Spain, what had happened in that era,\nin the [indecipherable], I mentioned that story in my manuscript. At that particular time,\nHitler was tremendously trying to influence the Spanish people, first of all that they\nshould join his armies, then help him defeat the enemy, and above all help him defeat the\nJews. So he used to send them [indecipherable] there, to make speeches, and he tells the\nstory about at one farm area country over there, one of these emissaries came, and\ngathered them together, and trying to say to them, you know we\u2019re losing the war, only\nbecause of the Jews. If it wouldn\u2019t be for the Jews, we would not ho -- have suffered all\nthese losses. And all what it went bad with Germany, he [indecipherable] tried to blame it\non the Jews. And therefore, he says, we must root them out, we must kill them wherever\nwe find them. When he got through with his speech, all these farmers, everybody had --\nthey had tools what they used for farming, grabbed them in their hands, and they went\nchasing to found Jews. So illusion --\nEnd of Tape Four, Side B\nBeginning Tape Five, Side A",
        "A: Even though from the 14\" century on, and that we are talking about the year of the\n20\" century, so for 600 years, no Jews were in the areas there. To their dismay, they were\nrunning, and running, and they couldn\u2019t find a Jew, so they should kill him to please the\nspeakers, demand, and desire, and what he told them to do. Even though it\u2019s only a story,\nbut again, I support what I said to the outset, that anti-Semitism 1s a disease. It\u2019s not a\nbecause, because they did this, or because they did that. Because we found them in places\nwhere Jews did not even live there at all. So you\u2019d say why -- wh-wh-why do you got --\nwant to blame them? It\u2019s an inherent disease, like any other diseases we haven\u2019t cured in\nthe world yet, which you have to do, and this disease, apparently, until now, had not been\ncured. And we must hope and strive to cure this disease, until such time will not come --\nwe'll still have to be vigilant, and we will suffer with that same disease.",
        "A: Okay. My oldest daughter\u2019s name is Rosalie, and in Italy, they was a very famous\nname at the time, and we named her Rosalie. So Rosa, Rosa, you find a lot of this here.\nWe are very proud, and she has her name at times, since she\u2019s in a school, in a Hebrew\nschool that she calls it Shoshanna. As a matter of fact, she just became a grandmother,\nand she\u2019s be -- going to be called for her grandchild, Safta, which is the Hebrew word for\ngranny. And that\u2019s what she chose to be. So she\u2019s very much involved in the educational\nfield. As I aforementioned to you before in our conversation, I -- which I didn\u2019t do with\nyou on tape, that she was, after she got married, her husband was still going to law\nschool, and he graduated George Washington University, while she took up over there,\nher Masters, at George Washington University. She had taken up another Masters since,\nand she\u2019s right now studying for her Ph.D. She -- she was teaching at the time in -- ina\nschool over there, which it was dignitaries children, some from ambassadors, and so on.\nAnd when I came to visit with her, there wasn\u2019t enough words th-they -- that I her --\ncould be heard by the man who was the supervisor, to tell me about my daughter, which\nI\u2019m very proud of. She brought me three children, the oldest one\u2019s name is Jennifer, the\nnext one, who just got married -- and Jennifer is married, and that\u2019s was their first child,\nEmily. The next one was Marissa, which she just got married, and her husband\u2019s name is\nBen, and Jennifer\u2019s husband I fe -- don\u2019t want to forget to say, his name is Jeff. So\ntherefore, my son-in-law, we call Jeffrey, or we call him Jeff. And my son-in-law, as I\nmentioned, 1s a graduate at-attorney, and he\u2019s very well a part of the law. He\u2019s involved\nin a variation of businesses, and thanks God he\u2019s doing good for -- for his family. My\nwife, being in love with education, still is t -- like I say, with the education on the school,\nand I\u2019m happy that all the parents from the children, like it used to be before, and the\nchildren, when we come visiting with her, we\u2019ll go to a restaurant, oh daddy, mommy.\nThis is my children from this and this grade, and the mommy\u2019s -- so she not -- not only\nknows the kids well, in a good way, but even the parents of the kids. So I\u2019m proud of it.\nNow, the youngest son of theirs is -- is Jordan, and he is right now in Texas, in college, at\na -- Dallas, which I\u2019m very happy and proud of him, too, and he looks like he\u2019s going for\nbusiness in there. And my son has two sons, just like he was a gymnast throughout\nschool, from Skokie, from Niles East, his kids did not follow exactly his way, but they\nplayed, and we used to come to meet some summertime, to come to Chicago, see them\nplay baseball, and they -- they involved in sports, probably the youngest one likes\nbasketball, what\u2019Il hap -- be outcome. The older one, Scott is his name, the younger one\nis the name Mark. My son\u2019s wife name, Susie, and she 1s also going now for her Ph.D.\nShe\u2019s also principal in a school. So round and ra -- and around, I\u2019m glad.",
        "A: And I\u2019m very happy that education worked, and it was my persuasion to the kids since\nthey were little, to help them. I\u2019m proud of myself that I could help even my\ngrandchildren, not only my kids, with -- scholastically, with their schools, since my\nmemory, thanks God, was good, and I was always a good student in school. So that was\nthe case, that I not only prevailed with me, of telling them, but I\u2019m happy to see the\nfruition of them, that they\u2019re all doing good, and they\u2019re educated very well, thanks God.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: You asked a very good question. I must say that my son married girl who converted to\nJudaism, she was not Jewish. And someone would listen to her on the pulpit, where my\ngrandchildren had Bar Mitzvah, they would not think that she 1s not Jewish. In the\nneighborhood, she is from Skokie, you know what I mean, which it was a lot of Jewish\npeople. And so it worked good. Both of my -- both of their kids are recognizing their\nJewishness. Both of them had Bar Mitzvahs. Then, of course, the oldest one is -- his\nname is Scott, 1s now in the university in Ohio -- in -- no, excuse me, 1n -- let\u2019s see, 1s it\nIowa State College, taking up structural engineering, and we s -- cami -- we -- once 1n a --\nwe talk to each other, like I say. I come once a year at least to Chicago, so we can visit\nwith each other. At times they come here. So depends which way, because to me, I -- I\ncannot put myself in a position to be away from my grandchildren, no more than for my\nchildren. So, all in all, the three grandchildren of my daughter, I had more closer contact,\nsince they were -- the oldest one was born in Chicago, but the other two were born right\nhere. So, they all know about it. My daughter, and my son-in-law, have a good write up\nin the zig -- museum, over here in Miami Beach. They also involved with Jewish causes,\nthey are good donors, like I am. I gave them the example, as you saw in the room, which\nI have the accolades for it. We believe in Jewish hope, we believe in Jewish future, and\nyes, being a survivor from the Holocaust, I did not go to blame God for that, as I said it to\nyou before, I blame man, because man could have helped us, and they didn\u2019t. So it\u2019s no\nuse to me to look for God. In -- 1n some people\u2019s belief, God put us on earth, and he gave\nus the wisdom to decide what to do. So when we do wrong, we can only blame ourselves,\nand not the maker. It\u2019s the same thing like you ri -- raise a child, and you tell him the\ngood things, and then all of a sudden, the child goes to do a bad thing. So, sure,\nsomebody would say -- the outsider would say, \u201cIt\u2019s your fault, you didn\u2019t raise him\nwell.\u201d But you know in your heart that you raised him well, it\u2019s just that it happened to be\nthat way, and you -- and you probably as a parent, accepted that way. But you don\u2019t go to\nblame the parent that they didn\u2019t raise him well. And that is my total belief in that way.\nBut yes, I\u2019m very proud to see -- we, in two different Judaism belonging. Both of my kids\ngo to Reform, they find themselves more comfortable there. I\u2019m a Conservative Jew, and\nI find myself comfortable where I belong, you know? But I never try to interfere with\nthem, I attended services in their synagogues, and whatever it 1s on my side, what\npersuasion I believe should be a personal thing, and what you feel yourself comfortable\nin.",
        "A: Well, a-as I said to you to begin with, if I was to prepare with question and answers\nfrom you to begin with, I could make it in an orderly way, and I would remor less, but\nsince it was part from the others, and part of the new one, you know what I mean, and I\ndidn\u2019t put it in the order the way it happened, it sometimes could be omitted. So, I believe\nI, at the moment cannot think of anything left out, because I believe I s -- not to praise my\nown self, but participating in so many things, and it doesn\u2019t matter. I was a member also\nthe Holocaust Museum, while I was a member also to the Simon Wiesenthal. As far as\nmy writing, and asking like this here, I was always, like I say -- Pll never forget when the\nmovie was made, from Simon Wiesenthal at that time, and in that movie, it showed a\ncase, where typically, what the -- the inmate of a concentration camp becames pregnant --\ndo you know that movie, what it was, or you don\u2019t -- or you didn\u2019t see it, it was\n[indecipherable]. And she was pregnant by that commanding officer. And later that\nhusband -- oh, the -- in -- in camp, which it was the boyfriend of hers, when later, after so\nmany years absence, because he escaped to the partisans, he didn\u2019t know about her, and\nlater when he discovers her -- so when he discovers where she 1s, he makes so many\nattempts, and somehow or other, she does not want to s -- recognize herself. And the\nstory ends that he makes a trip over there, he builds with his -- sim -- with Simon\nWiesenthal [indecipherable] to make the movie. And then he comes there, she greets him,\nand then he takes a look at the child, and he sees the child s-so much close -- in close\nlook at him, he looks like the commander of that camp from which he escapes. And she\nfinally admits to him what had happened with the rest. And now she tries to tell him why\nshe h -- was in hiding of that whole case, because how she -- she\u2019s still in love with him,\nand that did not happen out of love that she has a baby with the other. And it happened\nthe case is, that she does not want to testify against that particular murderer, from that\ncamp. So she tests -- testifies why, she tells him the story why she cannot do that, because\ntake a look at it, that\u2019s his son. She had -- what is to be told to that child? And that child\nalready was involved with so many good things, pro-Zionism, pro-Israel, and everything\nlike that, while he grew up with. So now -- so this case, and the [indecipherable] in other\nwords, that they sort of -- that came the ending, without a conclusion. I wrote to Simon\nWiesenthal about it, I mean, in -- in the -- in the -- California, and they told me, if you\nwant to, you can write to Simon Wiesenthal your protest, which they gave me the address\nto write to him in Vienna, and everything like that. That was one of my things that I was\nagainst it of the ending of that movie. In other words, you ended the movie with sort of,\nwhat do you think? What do you think it was? Was she justified not to go to answer, or\nwasn\u2019t she not justified? And itll always be a question about it. I personally, as I say, she\nwas justified to go even, she answered the question. He\u2019s a human being, he\u2019s a child, so\nshe got impregnated by -- in a forceful way, and that should not have stop her from\nshowing to be contessing against him. I opposed it tremendously why the mov -- I was\nhappy the movie was shown, but the way it ended, I definitely -- so, which I\u2019m only\ntrying to say, just talking about the Holocaust is not the full satisfaction. In my case,\nwhen something is wrong, if they do it in a visual way, or the other -- \u201cMax and Helen,\u201d\nwas the name of that movie, and it was -- and it was the movie -- you probably -- could\nprobably, maybe find about it, and that\u2019s what the name, \u201cMax and Helen.\u201d And you\u2019d\nfind it -- and basically what I told you in short, 1s what it deals. Like I say, everybody has\ntheir opinion, but my opinion was when you put the name of Simon Wiesenthal on there,\nand he was -- I was -- I\u2019m very happy with the man who discovered so many murderers,\nthat they would have been dome in the cases like this here. But no one is perfect, I\nsuppose, in this world, and that was a goofball by Simon Wiesenthal, not that he planned\nit to work out that way. And it was a thing, 1t was done, it was over. I watched that movie\ntwice that night. I called California because it was three hours, so the guard, looks like,\nwas the Israelite. And I spoke to him in Hebrew, and he gave me even the address to\nwrite directly, and it -- I wrote, and I got a letter from them at the same time responding.\nWell, it\u2019s Simon Wiesenthal is responsible, he was the one producing that. So, what you\ntalk to us over here [indecipherable] or the others, we had nothing to do with the\nproducing it. I merely for the case, so that -- wanted to tell you about it, because for\nalways, and forever, I will remain involved in the cause, or in the fight of justice, because\nthis 1s, again, it was an unjust case. It -- let\u2019s surmise and to say, because she didn\u2019t come\nto be the witness, maybe he didn\u2019t get the proper punishment, or was punished at all.\nNow, I don\u2019t believe that a murderer should be brought -- so somebody who constru --\nwho made that movie should have made that part be a -- sure, all of this, but it should\nhave ended in a different way. It could have perhaps ended that her testimony was not in\na person to person kind of way, but it was in a -- taking a deposition, and therefore he\nwas -- [indecipherable] so much in prison, or whatever it is. At least 1t would have had a\ndecent ending to what it is. Do you follow me what I am saying? But like this here,\nbecause it produced a child, and for her to expose it to this child, sooner or later,\nsomeday, he will know about it. Be that she will tell him, or others will tell him. Max had\nthe -- meanwhile, had to leave that sort of -- he was in love with her, she was in love with\nhim. And that came in the disturbance, you understand? So that\u2019s why they named the\nmovie \u201cMax and Helen.\u201d And, like I say, it\u2019s a hard taken movie, to see all the situation,\nwhat it took, until he must have told her that godsen came to see that, you know. But to\nmy case, what I\u2019m bringing it out, is to prove once more that it\u2019s not just one way or the\nother, I\u2019m still -- you find the same person all the way around, with the same opinions.\nSo, I told you about my children, I told you about myself -- about my wife Ill wait for\nyou find out. She\u2019s been a good wife to me, and a good mother to my grand -- to my\nchildren, and grandchildren. We just celebrated in January, our 55\" wedding anniversary.",
        "A: Thank you. And I -- we are still in love with each other, which it\u2019s a good sign. When\nour children made our 50\" anniversary, and -- a surprise when we were in Chicago. I told\nthem, you see, always, whenever you have arguments between husband and wife, take\nthe model from us. We also had arguments, but never walked the bedroom door away,\nclose it or stuff like this here, because remember, it could be done, if you want to. We\nhave a good Zionistic saying from -- from Intiered sue, he said -- [indecipherable] said it,\nif you been heroed -- the first proclamation, if you will want to, it will come true. And\nlife is that way. When two people are married, and they want to stay married, they\u2019Il be\nmarried. But if they are looking for a break someplace, e -- they\u2019Il find it, you know? And\nthat\u2019s the idea about it. So I always am happy to say thanks God my daughter celebrated -\n- she got married in 1968 -- \u201969 rather, in si -- \u201968 was the riot, she graduated from school\nin \u201969. So they had already 30 years of marriage, which it\u2019s a good, happy occasion. So\nmy husband -- my son and his wife are in good family standing in the same way, even\nthough he travels, and so on. Hardworking, both of them. She works hard in her way, and\nhe works very hard in his way, he\u2019s a director in automotive, that he travels out of the\ncountry, and so on. But he is also very devoted father, and husband, and I am proud to --\nto speak about it, and to say it whenever I can. If you have more questions, ask them. I'll\ntry and answer them.",
        "A: Okay, Arwin, I must thank the museum for allowing me to express what I did. \u2019'm\nonly sorry, as I said to you at the outset, why the volume of my 16 cassettes could not be\nadded onto that, to make that a fuller volume, and it could be somebody sitting down, and\nsee in person. Because on the radio it comes out a different story, anybody could imitate,\nand tell it, but you gotta see the person, too. But I suppose that\u2019s all their budget allowed\nthem to do, and I will re-invigorate myself to become again a member. I already told you,\nwhich I don\u2019t want to go on tape about what it 1s, not that it -- it\u2019s any difference, but I\nbelieve the tape doesn\u2019t need to hear negative stories, I\u2019m not a negative teller. So Ill just\nsay I'll b -- Pll be coming back a supporter of the Holocaust Museum. I already told you\nthe story what I had to go through a few times, with people in the know, that it should not\ncriticize the mus -- Holocaust museums in -- no matter where it\u2019s built -- being built, it\u2019s\nour utmost. We saw what had happened in Germany, they want to build a museum in\nBerlin, and that\u2019s where Holocaust museum belongs. We must help and support the idea\nthat the people of tomorrow, the German people of tomorrow, and any people of the\nworld, who\u2019ll ever come to visit Berlin, they should be able to see of the bad era of\nhistory that it happened, because when you hide yourself behind, you only make that\nbecome a repetition, but when you speak about it, you educate things about it, that\u2019s a\npreservation of not to make the same mistake over again.",
        "A: Well, thank you Arwin, for taking your time to come to my house, and interviewing\nme, and I hope I gave you satisfaction I\u2019m sure, your interview, if it mets an rating, will\nprobably meet up a good rating on your behalf.",
