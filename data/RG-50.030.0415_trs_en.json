So\nwe have, you know, money to go. And finally we -- he gave us the papers, and we went to\nTrovald. The plan was that we go to the station at night, because we -- we already was\nmandatory to wear the yellow star.",
        "Q: You were hearing -- you were wearing the star?",
        "A: Sure, that time. And we removed the star when we went to the station. But the reason was that\nwe went at night because we want somebody to recognize us, you know, Christian, without a\nstar, walking. Not to mention there was a curfew for the Jews. So --",
        "Q: What time was that?",

        "A: We weren\u2019t worried, but -- worried, but we were very optimistic about the end of the war,\nhow could it happen, you know? Maybe that\u2019s what we had was, you know, to getting -- you\nknow, our survival [indecipherable]. We were sure that, even in Auschwitz, you know, in spite of\nfact my friend didn't come back, we -- we were -- couldn\u2019t imagine that we -- we\u2019ll die over\nthere, you know? We always thought that war will be over, and -- very soon, and we will always\ncome some [indecipherable], you know, that -- especially one time when there was a\n[indecipherable] against Hitler, and they wanted to kill him.

So now we\u2019re back and I -- I want to continue of course, asking you, in terms of the\nchronology of your experiences, but I wanted to take a moment now, before we continue with\nyour experiences, and just ask you about the fact that this is the first time that you\u2019ve been\ninterviewed, right? This is the first time?",
        "A: Yeah, okay, okay.",
        "Q: And just tell me what that\u2019s like for you.",
        "A: It is a -- I -- you can see it\u2019s very emotional. You know, all of my friends have the same --\nbasically the same experience, not exactly the same because all of them was different places.\nEverybody knew about it, but just to say my experience, you know, as it is happen, going all over\nit, you know, it is -- it\u2019s -- it is the first time. We\u2019re talking about episodes, you know, with my\nhusband, and my friend, but not -- not the whole, you know, not -- not all the [indecipherable]. It\nis a little emotional, what can I say?",
        "Q: And you did write about your experiences at one point. Was that emotional, very emotional to\nyou?",
        "A: Yes, but not -- not as telling. You know, I ne -- when I -- ma -- when my daughter was small,\nI always refused to tell her anything, because I wanted to grow -- to her -- to grow up, you know,\nwithout any handicap, how they say it, you know? But I don\u2019t have to tell her because she picked\nup here and there, and she know -- she knew the whole thing. And now when my -- ask my\ngrandmother -- granddaughter to type it for me, you know, and I was dictate it to her, it was the\nfirst time to her, too, to hear it. And I saw, you know, she was -- wasn\u2019t even look up, she just\ntried to, you know, how you say, on the -- you know, it -- it -- I can tell that she was very, you\nknow, affected by it, as my -- you know, in my opinion, later on the day that the second\ngeneration, li-like my daughter, was affected indirectly, I was the same as we [indecipherable]\nwe went through. My daughter is a very smart girl, but she never ask me, and I never tell her\nanything. And now, when it was typed on, I ask her, you want a copy? She said no. Save it for --\nsomewhere, maybe somewheres, I know everything. And she does.",
        "Q: Now why -- why do you think you were ready to talk now?",
        "A: I tell you what, three years ago, as I said, Frank called me up, she saw ma -- you know, when\n-- how could I go from where I started in -- in Debrecen to -- you know, to go that collecting\ncamp, it\u2019s call -- called Sharvar. It\u2019s a big, big distance. And I told him over the phone, you\nknow, just what happened, and he said why don\u2019t you let them, you know, tape it down. I said I\ndo not go through it again. I -- I -- it just too -- it would be too much, and I wasn't even want to\nhear about it. But later on my grandchildren ask -- was asking, you know, me questions. They\nwent to the movie, they read in books, you know, and they were asking me my experience, and\nthen I started to think that it time to tell them. I don\u2019t think, you know, I never saw that movies, I\nnever go to see the movies, not because it\u2019s affecting me, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s -- it\u2019s just a movie.\nThey -- it can\u2019t be the same. It\u2019s no offense [indecipherable] but I don\u2019t think anybody can\nunderstand, only people who was there.",
        "Q: How often do your memories come up of those days? Is it frequent, is it every day? How\noften?",
        "A: You know what, since I mentioned to you we came to -- coming together with people, friends,\nsince [indecipherable] here specially, all of them si -- most of them survivor. Some of them was\nhiding, but most of them survivor. It was unavoidable that w -- you know, is not come up, some\nways, with some -- with -- you know, with -- we always -- some of them [indecipherable] not\nalways the tragic way, you know, just as a fact, that\u2019s what it happened, that\u2019s -- and we went --\nwe went, you know, over it, and so it almost a -- you know what? I think that people who went\nthrough on this, they could be a millionaire, or a worker, or whatever, it\u2019s impossible that their\nlife wasn\u2019t affected if they went through, in some way. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s -- you know, money\ncould make it easier for anybody. And, 1s a tragedy if, you know, people will forget. And they\ndoes, sometimes. I have a problem in my [indecipherable] you know, and I seeing a doctor\nregularly. She\u2019s a -- he\u2019s a real nice man, and a very good doctor, and [indecipherable] he was a\n[indecipherable]. And he -- he knew what we are survivors, so as he is talking about that he is,\nyou know, [indecipherable] and so on, and what terrible thing was it, as it -- unspeakable and so\non. And after the [indecipherable] when, you know, what happened, after that I saw him, and he\nsaid it\u2019s a terrible thing what happened here, which I agree. They just came, they don\u2019t care if\nthey die, and killed -- drive away, 6,000 people is -- is just -- he said, you know, what you went\nthrough, the Holocaust was a terrible thing, but it was worse. I said -- I didn\u2019t say nothing,\nbecause he is a very nice man. But this time they killed 6,000 people, and you know, we are still\nin shock because we like that country. But they -- Hitler killed six million people, and I don\u2019t\nthink it -- if even, you know, they can compare. I don\u2019t know what will happen here in the future.\nAs I said, you know, we -- we like that country, you know? We are -- I must say we have a -- we\nworked -- we let -- they let us work here, they never ask we -- you are Jewish or not. We got job,\nwe let the -- my daughter, you know send to school, and my granddaughters. This is a wonderful\ncountry. And what happened 1s terrible, but I don\u2019t think it -- it\u2019s -- you know, it\u2019s comparable\nwhat happened then.",
        "Q: So now let\u2019s -- let\u2019s try to go back to what we were talking about, you were still telling me\nabout the early moments of German occupation, and I was wondering, just so we make sure and\nget your chronology right, if you could explain how long you lived with your grandmother, and -\n- and where you went after you moved from there.",
        "A: Okay. She passed away 1941, and I went to live with my relatives in Debrecen, so I\u2019m -- the\nother city, so I lived there approximately three years. So it was 1944 when the, you know, when\nthe German came in and changed everything. The -- the -- in that three years I was, you know,\nstudying -- I mean, start to learn cosmetic. It was a relatively very busy place, and it was nice.\nThey were nice people over there.",
        "Q: And how old were you when the Germans came in?",
        "A: I was 17 years old. 17. I became 18 in the camp.",
        "Q: So now, before you left Debrecen, what -- what were you doing, and what was it like with the\nGermans around?",
        "A: Well, I wasn\u2019t with them that time too mu -- too long time, because, as I said, we were\npreparing to leave, and we -- you know, constantly were talking about it at their house, and\nplanning, and we had to wait until the papers are ready, which was supposed to be very good\npapers, but it wasn\u2019t. We -- we don\u2019t have to use it. And we -- we were talking about the -- the\ndistance, I mean, that time, your situation every day new and new, you know, law came out\nagainst, you know, against the Jews, the Jewish business, you know, they take over th-the\nbusiness. And they were planning the -- to, you know [indecipherable] of the ghetto. They said\nwhich -- from which part of the city will, you know, will extended, you know? There was a li --\nha -- the limit there. And happens to be my -- my relative\u2019s house, you know, it was right there.\nSo they had to take different people in their [indecipherable] you know, their -- their place. By\nthat time I wasn\u2019t there already. When I came back from the camp, I went over there. It was\nsome -- nobody was there in the apartment, and I went down the basement, you know, looking\nfor some paper or something she\u2019s left, I find nothing.",
        "Q: That\u2019s in your family\u2019s home?",
        "A: It was, you know, for a few years. The first time when I got back from the camp, I went to\nNyiregyhaza where I came from. I have a very extended family, cousins and aunts and uncles, lot\nof them, you know. Nobody was there, nobody, not a soul. Then I went back to Debrecen\nbecause I heard that time that some of the people went to Austria, so there are more chance to\nmeet, you know, maybe friend or somebody. But in the meantime in Auschwitz, you know -- I\ndon\u2019t know, I\u2019m going back and forth. If you want me to continue, or --",
        "Q: Yeah, well let\u2019s -- let\u2019s go in an -- the order of how things happened. So -- so you were\npreparing to leave with these false papers, and you got these false papers through a friend of\nyours, right?",
        "A: Through that boy who was a -- you know, fleeing from Czechoslovakia. So we went to\nSzeged, to the city, to the second largest city in Hungary. As I said, we rented a room, and we\nmoved there. And for a few weeks we don\u2019t have any problem, the woman was very nice to us,\nyou know, because we said we was -- you know, we came from the bombardment. And -- but\nlater on they started to bombard the Szeged, the big city, and everybody has to go and went down\nto the shelter. And we were afraid to go down, you know, we were afraid to from the\n[indecipherable], we were not ready, you know -- you know, maybe say something, or turn out to\nbe [indecipherable]. And we decided not to go down. We thought it\u2019s less dangerous than go\ndown. But later on they start to tell our landlady why these young girl not coming down and so\non. So we decided that we going [indecipherable] to Budapest. It\u2019s a big city and we, you know,\nsomewhere, get around. And we traveled safely, but when we got down there was a big police\nquota, pick up the Jews, you know? With the yellow star too, was traveling. And they pick u-us\ntoo, and when they saw the paper, you know, it was brand new do -- you know, and we were\nvery nervous probably. They find out, they ask question and yes, so they took a -- took us to the\npolice station with a lo -- with all of the Jews, you know, who were wearing stars or not wearing\nstars. And when we got there, the police -- chief wa -- chief of the police said we will get one\nweek from the -- that place, the [indecipherable], and after that we will go back to the ghetto. But\nafter more than one week, you know, went by, and more and more people came to that place, or\nwas taken to that place. In fact, my friend, her name was Ava, find a lady who was traveling to\nBudapest to her daughter, gave birth to a first grandchild. Her husband was already in forced\nlabor camp. And he was very nice, you know, to a young girl. It was a terrible experience, it was\na [indecipherable] room, a [indecipherable] crowded room with all different kind of people\nbeside the Jews, you know? And I think [indecipherable] the toilet was in the middle of the\nroom, without any wall or nothing. It was the first, you know, demonizing experience. And --",
        "Q: Wa -- what was your -- what was your name on the false papers?",
        "A: Elizabeth [indecipherable]. And Ava was Julia -- Julian [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And so the two of you --",
        "A: It\u2019s a Hungarian --",
        "Q: And the two of you were already very close by now.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Close friends, and --",
        "A: Yeah, close friends, yeah.",
        "Q: And you helped each other a lot during this, right?",
        "A: We tried to help each other, the fact that we were not alone, first of all, we were friend, we\nwere not alone, you know, we belong together. Sp -- and specially came this lady who was a --\nyou know, some friend of her mother, and she was about 45 years old and a very nice lady. In\nfact, that time she told us that we left her place -- she was a [indecipherable], and he said her\ntreasure, how -- how you say that, jewelry and everything, you know, where he get, you know,\nex -- exactly explain it to us in case something happen to her that we tell her daughter whatever -\n- which is happen later on. And we went together too from there, after a few weeks. We were sad\nwe were taken in a different camp. And we were -- we were walking to the ra -- the station and it\nwas a big camp. A kapo was there who was the manager, I don\u2019t know what was there before,\nbut we knew that before that it just -- it was a collecting camp. Not only that one, we know there\nare two more of us in Hungary.",
        "Q: And what was it called?",
        "A: Sharvar. It was very far from my original, you know, city, Nyiregyhaza, other side of the\ncountry. And we were, you know, we have a little -- we felt a little bit better there because we\ncould, you know, put some curtain up and wash ourself, our -- we have the toilet, you know. I\ndon\u2019t know how many people was there, but at least there was a toilet. And we were waiting\nwhat will happen, we -- we thought something will happen, you know, we can\u2019t be here forever.\nAnd aft -- we stayed there at least a month. Oh, and that place, it was under -- the police\n[indecipherable] was standing under the -- it was a so called gerdarmes? You know that?",
        "Q: Gendarmes?",
        "A: Gen -- yeah, that\u2019s right. They are very [indecipherable] you know, they don\u2019t tell us\nanything, you know, whatever we asking.",
        "Q: What kind of confrontations do you remember having, either when the Germans had\noccupied, or the police along the way? Was that very frightening to you? Do you have\nconfrontations directly with these sort of police types, or soldiers, or --",
        "A: Not really personally, no. No. We were a crowd, you know. It was just -- we were no -- when\nwe got to Sharvar already, I -- the -- the camp, we felt like, you know, they were -- we were not\ntreated like a person, just like a number or something, you know? Nobody talked to us, we don\u2019t\nknow what will happen. We can get questioned. At the door was th-this gendares, you know?\nAnd we were there at least a month when they came, the manager, or -- I don\u2019t know how you\ncall him, and told us that we\u2019re taken now for a different camp, and it will take a few days, and\nthere -- there was a counting over there in that -- in Sharvar. Everybody who has money can buy\nsome food for the road. And every time it was some change we were glad, maybe this time we\nwill have a chance to talk to somebody, we know what will happen to us, you know? And when\nwe got to the station -- from that we were walking, and we got -- and we got to the station, there\nwere cattle wagons all over, and there were SS standing at the door. And very fast they put as\nmuch as they can in one wagon. We had hardly any space to sta -- sit like this. We were sitting\non the floor, on the -- our legs. It was really crowded, and they put the two pails in it, you know,\none for toilet, one for we -- water.",
        "Q: They put two what -- pots, you mean, or wa -- or pail, pail.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And naturally the water never was enough. We were not hungry, we were always\nvery, very thirsty. Sometimes when we went, the wagon -- the trains da -- stopped for some\nreason, and peasant women was all around, and gave us some water, and they changed another\nwoman, the SS changed the pails. And we continue. We -- we went through beautiful area. We --\nI heard a place, you know, like a [indecipherable] but I heard a place before, and you know, we\nlooked out with this small window, and somebody recognized the place, it\u2019s called -- I don\u2019t\nknow how you call it English, in Hungarian mogo shtatra.",
        "Q: What did it look like? It was some sort of beautiful scenery, or --",

        "Q: And so you knew a little bit about the direction that the train was going in?",
        "A: Yeah, we -- we went through this one. I just remember this one, you know? This is the\nCzechoslovakia, I think now. There are some area which sometimes belong to Hungary,\nsometimes to Czechoslovakia. This -- this time 1t was Czechoslovakia, and -- and I think still it\nis. And we went a few days when the s -- when the train stopped. And we looked out, and we\nsaw, you know, the barracks, with barbed wires all over it. And when they opened the door, a lot\nof SS soldier, and yelling to us, get out, schnell, schnell, out. And everybody keep the small\nthing what they had, you know, package, because they -- it will send after us. We knew that this\ncan\u2019t happen, there was na -- no name on it, nothing.",
        "Q: What did you have with you?",
        "A: Maybe one sweater, or -- of -- when I was 1n the [indecipherable] house, I had a cousin in\nBudapest, and you cou -- [indecipherable] up and came in, and I gaved her everything. So 1s\neverybody else. This a na -- this lady [indecipherable], who called [indecipherable], she called\nher daughter, they came. She gave her the package, and pocketbook, or whatever. So we left just,\nyou know, what was on us, a sweater, or whatever, not much and some food. But we\n[indecipherable |",
        "Q: And you were wearing a Jewish star again, right? You were forced to, or not?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, no, no. They know we are Jewish now, on that time.",
        "Q: And you were on this transport with now both of the women that you --",

The rest of the people I don\u2019t know, and they were the one who were taken to the\nconcentration camp -- I mean the death camp, the Hungarian camp. And before the\n[indecipherable] you know, we went together, that\u2019s -- as much as they can put that together and\ndeliver it to the station and the wagons. So it -- I didn\u2019t know anybody else beside\n[indecipherable |",
        "Q: How long was the journey?",
        "A: It\u2019s -- I can\u2019t imagine, I\u2019m not sure. It was days, maybe a week, maybe less. Sometimes we\nstopped for different reason, to change the [indecipherable] beside it, I don\u2019t know why they\nstopped the -- stopped the wagon.",
        "Q: What did you -- what did you talk about during that time?",
        "A: It was really sad. It was -- we -- we -- we were very uncomfortable, I don\u2019t have to tell it.

It was a terrible, terrible smell. So, it\nwasn\u2019t a -- I don\u2019t even know where we going. We just think that time it was somehow so\nhopeless.",
        "Q: Did you eat?",
        "A: Not much. We couldn\u2019t eat. We had some food, you know. But as I remember back,\neverybody was very, very thirsty, and a -- we have -- we could -- we were thought that\neverybody can drink only three sip from the pail, you know, that went from one to another. It\nwas -- it was not much, you know, so I don\u2019t know if we can even think, it was just a very sad\nand desperate situation. I remember a baby with a -- excuse me, you want to --",
        "Q: [inaudible]",
        "A: She was a very small baby and she fe -- she [indecipherable] her in the wagon. Sometimes I\nremember faces, but I think I made the remark about that it -- I don\u2019t think anybody could -- a-at\nleast not too many people came back from that wagon. Not the baby with the mother, not the old\nmen. Not the [indecipherable] who we went.",

        "A: He was praying every morning, and when I, you know, thinking back, that\u2019s sad that maybe\nthis affected me that much that I am not religious any more. He was praying to who? And\nhundred percent that he was -- went right away to the gas chamber.",

        "A: He was an older man.",
        "Q: Did religion have a real role for you at that time?",
        "A: No, I -- no, nothing. I don\u2019t think -- even think about religion, neither one of us. We just, you\nknow, couldn\u2019t believe it, especially after that you know, we couldn\u2019t believe it, what happened.\nIt wasn\u2019t real. And when we stopped finally, and the SS soldiers, you know, start yelling us,\neverybody schnell, schnell, everybody get out in one line, one after the other, and I remember the\nfront of us was this Alma, Namey we called her. Namey means Aunt Alma. And then, you know,\nmy friend and me, and the front of the line there was this German so -- not German how you call\n-- officer, Mengele, we didn't know that. And we saw that the younger people go one side, the\noth -- the older people with children go to other side. So that time we thought this the\n[indecipherable] working people and older one on the -- the child -- mother with children, you\nknow. They put in -- in different place. So we were talking about it, as soon -- you know, slowly\nas we went, and ish -- we knew that is better maybe, for us, do -- working for them. And when\nwe reached this [indecipherable] I mean, officer, he was looking on [indecipherable] you know.\nShe wasn\u2019t more than 45, but she has grayish hair and long shoes, you know, for the traveling,\nshe was wearing. And she to -- y-you know, waved her to go this side. And she knew that is not a\ngood thing going with the older, and the ki -- and the kids. And she was speaking in German, and\nshe -- she told him, [indecipherable] I can work, I am able to work. And she look at him, and --\nyou know. She was in that -- he [indecipherable] her again that go that side. I remember I looked\nat her, you know.

        "A: No, it was just, you know, a matter of second. Later on her daughter visited me, came to\nDebrecen, because I-I send a message that I was with her mother, and you know, I told her really\nthat she find a thing what she told us. And after that, her father -- her husband came too. She\nasked me to go to the rabbi and make a statement that I saw her to go to the other side. She\nwanted to get married, it was very shortly after the thing. So I went to the rabbi. He send me a\nbig bucket of flowers, anyway.",

        "Q: So I don\u2019t know if you recognize anything here.",
        "A: You know what? I was spending time almost all the barracks, because as -- you know, the\nselecting of people, Mengele, every day, we always stay behind. We went through -- from\nbarracks to barracks, finding out. This is the -- we have a [indecipherable] there, you know, and\nthe -- it wasn\u2019t regular toilet, 1t was call -- so-called -- I don\u2019t know how to say English, latrina?",

In fact, they called the lager C the\nfarnichtenslager, you know, because everybody either went for work, or the rest of them went to\nthe camp -- I mean, the gas. So -- I don\u2019t know about wa -- oh, when we arrive, I like to go back\nthere. We went in stripe uniform or what -- I don\u2019t know how to call it, men took us over. Then\nwe went for awhile, and ja -- and Polish woman took us over, and I was told get the -- undress,\neverybody. And the men was walking around us, you know? They don\u2019t pay any attention to us\nanyway. They were very, very rude to us.",

        "A: Later --",

        "A: No, they are the ja -- and -- later I understand, you know, because they were there three, four\nyears already in the camp before we got there. Hitler occupied Hungary that -- for the last\ncountry, and they -- we were told several times, the Hungarian ladies, they were, you know, at\nhome in the -- comfortable and nice when we were already here. And as I understand later that\nthese people has to put their own family to the gas chamber and the cremat -- crematorium. So\nwhen we got there already, they were not human being. At first this was shocking you know,\nwhen they yell at us, and sometimes they slapped people on the face, and they very rude. But\nlater on I thought I\u2019m not surprised they -- I\u2019m not human being any more. They were not human\nbeing any more. They were survive -- few, not too many, but they paid the price.",
        "Q: Were there lots of conflicts between one group of prisoners and another group from one\ncountry to the next, you know --",
        "A: Like -- between us?",

        "A: The hu -- no, it wasn\u2019t, no.",
        "Q: From wa -- from Hungarian, you know, [indecipherable]",
        "A: Not only that, you know. When we finally get to C lager, after you know, the certain\nprocedure what they did for us, what we got for -- for -- let\u2019s see, for breakfast, a big plate, was\nblack coffee, which was medicated already. And we constantly sleeping, so it was one reason\nnobody was fighting. The other -- and we realized was we saw me-medication in it, because the\nwomen stopped menstruating, you know? But it was when we got the borax already. Before that,\nyou know, we had to -- you want me to go back? The -- he -- they told us to get undressed, and\none woman cut all the hair on your -- all -- all of the body. And they -- we got some disinfectant\non our body, and everybody got some piece of dress, it wasn\u2019t a dress, sometimes a skirt or a\nblouse, or whatever, it\u2019s fits, not fits. And most of the time it not -- doesn\u2019t fit. And finally we\nwere tol -- we were, you know, put in a line again, but I remember back at that time -- I couldn't\neven think. I was like a -- foggy, you know? It couldn\u2019t happen. I couldn\u2019t believe it, what\nhappening, you know? I -- it was just unreal. So we went to the barracks, and everybody was told\nto climb up, it was wooden barracks, wooden bunk bed. Five people up, five people down. And\nwe climb up and we -- we just [indecipherable] thing to sleep, they were so tired. But the thing\nwas, if somebody want to turn, everybody has to turn. And, you know, like -- like a\n[indecipherable]. And in the morning when we were given coffee, we were told to go and sit\ndown in one line, and the front of us, the first one, got the big dish with black coffee. And he di -\n- he d -- he was told, drink a few, drink and give it back until it went all the way. At first it was\nterrible, you know, drinking after so many people. But it wasn\u2019t later, we don\u2019t care.",
        "Q: How many people were you around at that point?",
        "A: You mean the whole barracks? As I remember correctly, it was 800, a thousand people in one\nbarrack -- barracks. Maybe I\u2019m wrong, but I think that was the number.",
        "Q: Were you still next to your friend, were you able to stay with her?",
        "A: Yes, yeah, I was with my friend, and three other people, and it was little, we thought, maybe\nbetter the other place, so we went -- nobody cared, we went from barracks to barracks to try out.\nBut during the day we were sleeping constantly. That was the only time we could sleep\n[indecipherable] on the floor out -- outside, because on the bunkbed, you know, it was very bad.",
        "Q: What were you eating each day?",
        "A: We got in the morning black coffee and some kind of soup for lunchtime, I think. And at\nnight -- first we -- at the morning, s-standing appelle. You probably heard about it. The\nlageralteste came and counted with her [indecipherable], and then the SS came and counted us,\nand naturally, it n -- it never s -- never was all right, the number never was all right. So they\nstarted again, it takes hours. And we thought, and is probably true, it was one kind of torture.\nYou standing there on the sun, or -- or rain, or whatever. And the same thing happened at night,\ntoo. And when we standing in the appelle at night, we got a piece of bread, and something went\ninto the piece of [indecipherable] it\u2019s cheese or something. Was piece of salami [indecipherable]\nprobably, I don\u2019t know what was it. Most of the people make very small slices, you know? They\nmake it for the whole day, like paper, try to make it. And me and my friend we eat it at -- right\naway. We thought maybe we feel like eat something -- eat something. And then I went to visit\nmy friend I mentioned before on the lager, where the Nyiregyhaza, you know, most of the\npeople, all of the people of -- from Nyiregyhaza. I find a cousin there, and she had a -- about 13 -\n14 years a daughter with her. They survived. They came home. Unfortunately my cousin, after a\nfew years, passed away in cancer. And the girl who was with her, still in Nyiregyhaza, I ha -- I\nnever saw her since then, alone, completely alone. She got married, but she lost her husband and\nsh -- first she lost her mother at home. And she\u2019s completely all alone, and sh-she is not even\nhealthy. She\u2019s a heart trouble, and so on.",
        "Q: How -- how did you -- how did you make it through each of these days there? I mean, what\nwere you thinking and how did you approach that?",
        "A: Every day came Mengele to select people for work, and we always hoping, my Ava and me,\nto go, you know, to -- we were hoping that he select us, because you know, the rumor was that\n[indecipherable] stay here, going to the gas.",
        "Q: How much were you hearing about the crematorium?",
        "A: A lot, almost every day. We can see the smoke, you know, we can see this, you can smell this,\nyou know, odor, [indecipherable]. And we were reminded by the lageralteste this -- you will go\nover there, where to see where your parents and relatives are. They don\u2019t -- they don\u2019t care any\nmore, because you know, they went through. You know, it was first unbelievable for us to -- I\nthought he just -- she just talking, but she wasn\u2019t talking. And we always left behind because\nMengele came every day, we were very, very skinny, both of us. 17 years old, on\n[indecipherable] was hungry and -- and he selected us, you know, send back always. So it\nhappened one time that -- there was a so-called child lager, child oc -- they were put over there, I\ndon\u2019t know what is, and I-later they disappeared. And it was empty, and that day Mengele came\nand selected a group, and for some reason, I never know why, they put the older people in that\nbarrack and we find out that they coming for it the following day. But this time they said, as\nalways, he separated friends, or sisters, or mother and child, or whatever. And they were crying\nand begging her to stay there. They rather stay there than going away and left them. But 0 -- of\ncourse it was nothing to him. So during the night, at least one-third of the people fled\nsomewhere. They were locked in and lageralteste all over, and they somehow got out. Windows,\nand -- you know, they don\u2019t care if they beating them, or what. They get out. And they -- we saw\nthe, you know, the problem what the lageralteste has. They had to have the number to -- the --\nthe right number. So my friend and me, and a lot of other people run in, you know? We were\neven more than it needed, and they li -- they put out -- after they got the -- counted, they put out\nthe -- which are not -- don\u2019t needed, to the [indecipherable] and we s -- we stay inside. Can I stop\n[indecipherable] [tape break]",
        "Q: All right, so we\u2019re back again, and so we\u2019re talking more about Auschwitz and the time you\nspent there, and first can you just tell me the period of time, the length of time you were there?",
        "A: It was probably from May to October. October, it was, you know, four already, and at least\nthree-quarter of the lager, the camp C lager, was out already. We were just the so-called\nleftovers. And for awhile seemed to us it\u2019s hopeless, but as I mention before, it happen that a\nselected group was staying 1n a -- was locked for the night in a former chi -- children barracks.\nAnd you know, some people run out, and we went, you know, we thought, with my friend Ava to\ntry to get in. And we were successful for awhile. It was a following day Mengele came, and --",
        "Q: An-And did you at this time when you were there, did you know his name? Had you --",
        "A: Mengele, yes. Mengele we knew already. Yes.",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t -- 1t wasn\u2019t --",
        "A: He was a very handsome man. Looking back, I wouldn\u2019t recognize him. Very handsome, very\ngood looking. And ha -- very mean. I mean that.",
        "Q: Did you have like direct interaction with him?",
        "A: Not personally, but every selection, almost every day, you know, we saw him -- a saw us, and\nyou know, selected our -- our -- us out.",
        "Q: Did you speak with him at any point?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: So you were saying -- so he -- he came --",
        "A: He came, but that time he was just interested about the numbers, you know, that the number is\nthe same. But my friend Ava has a lot of bug bite on her stomach, and you know, she -- it was\nitchy, and it was bloody. And she hi -- he notice right away, so he put her aside -- put him aside.\nAnd we were taken out very fast, so the [indecipherable] was okay, so we taken off very fast. We\nare taken to the lager B. We didn\u2019t know that time that that is the crematorium or whatever it is.\nAnd we were put in a barrack -- barrack, and later I find out that Ava, -- that was informally in\nthe B lager -- B lager, and she was taken there, too, to [indecipherable]. Later, somebody saw her\nin berge -- Bergen-Belsen, so evidently she was taken from there too. So --",
        "Q: And do you know if she survived?",
        "A: No, she\u2019s not. She\u2019s not. I went back to the city, I met with her parents and I live with them\n[indecipherable] parents, I waited for hi -- her to come back. And she was very friendly before\nwe left with the [indecipherable]. She came back after the liberation looking for her. I was\ncorresponding with him, but he was -- he [indecipherable] find out that he is there or not.\nAnyway, I\u2019m going back to the selection.",
        "Q: So did the two of you get a chance to say good-bye, even?",
        "A: Not good-bye, I met her once more. When we were in that barrack, we were closed in in the\nbay -- B lager, lager B. And this time everybody was very careful, even the haftlings, you know?\nNobody can -- got in or out because everybody want to get out from Auschwitz. We thought --\nand we -- we were told that we going for work. So it was impossible to get in. So some day Ava\nheard about it we are there [indecipherable] and came to the window. And we are talking, and\nright away, you know, that was around us, that -- because I ask, you know, maybe she can come\nin over the window, it was y -- no, they said no, not really, no, they don\u2019t let her in. But it wasn\u2019t\na good-bye because we knew that -- we didn\u2019t know that time which day we are going, maybe\nshe will come back again, but she never did. That was the last time I saw her.",
        "Q: When you -- even -- even before this point when you\u2019ve been -- when you were in Auschwitz,\ndid you have a lot of fear about being sent to the crematorium? Did you think --",
        "A: Not really, no, no. First of all we took -- the first time, and later on, for awhile, we couldn\u2019t\nbelieve it, you know, we couldn\u2019t believe it, but the lageralteste told us. She was very mean, and\nshe was right, you know\u201d? It was -- I didn\u2019t mention we were standing in the appelle, staying up, a\n-- and one of the girls start to saying her favorite recipe, a food, and everybody was listening,\nenjoying it, everybody has different recipe, and we enjoyed it, you know, that we spend time\nwith this cooking. And one time, or more than one time, the lageralteste came, and he said, don\u2019t\nplan, you will go there while your parents [indecipherable] they were -- we were reminded\nconstantly by them. And specially remember a gir -- girl, a lageralteste, he was a Czech origin.\nHer name was Vera Fisher, a large, heavy-set woman with a very bad complexion. She was very\nmean. She was -- she was nothing to sl -- you know, slap somebody on the face or kick her,\nwhatever. And she was speaking Hungarian, you know, because the -- most of the Czech at -- at\nthe border, you know, is Hungarian Czech or Slovakia\u2019s neighbors. So wa -- she was said -- spre\n-- speaking very well Hungarian. She was the meanest. There\u2019s the only one who I remember by\nname and by face, and --",
        "Q: What were some of the things that she did that really bothered you, disturbed you at the time?",
        "A: Nothing really. She was just -- she was just a mean person, you know? She was there for\nyears [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And you felt that she just wasn\u2019t even sensitive any more to --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- to people.",
        "A: No, definitely not. As I said before, they were not human being any more Amy, no, not even\nclose. And I understand why not. It was terrible what they went through. Not just what we went\nthrough, but before us, they were the one who put their parents and -- and families in the\ncrematorium.",
        "Q: So how did you pass time during those days?",
        "A: In -- in the camp?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: First of all we were sleeping during the day, because we couldn\u2019t sleep at night, you know,\nwe were so crowded together, and during the day we just went one spot and lay down and sleep.\nBut we don\u2019t have too much time because we -- at the morning we were standing appelle for\nhours, on the -- around, you know, four, five o\u2019clock, I don\u2019t remember exactly what time, we\nstarted again, you know? So we went to the -- we went to the -- there was a bath over there, we\ncould wash. Not every lager, the C lager happens to be -- has a bath. We have enough water.\nThey mention to me, my friends, one of the B lager, they don\u2019t have enough water, they were\ndelivering the water to them. And yes, I remember once when I was -- Ava and me standing in\nappelle, the other three girls, was three sisters who I know from Nyiregyhaza, we were very good\nfriend one --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Edith\nCsengeri. This is tape number two, side B. So you can continue telling me the story.",
        "A: As I said, there were th-three sisters, and one of my was very good friend who w-we both\nbelong to the same organization, a Zionist organization. Anyway, we later -- they -- we were\nstanding five of us, and always the -- one of the sister get at the front. First we don\u2019t realize what\nhappening, then they -- here was the bread, and the piece of water, what they gave us, to us. They\nalways choosed -- it wasn\u2019t cut exactly the same, but every bite was counted, you know? So we\nrealized finally, all -- we always getting the smaller one. So after awhile we went to somewhere\nto stand, you know? It was a small episode, but I remember back -- didn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t come\nback, either of them.",
        "Q: Do you feel like, you know, the women you were around, was it mostly that you were -- all\nwere helping each other, or was it just too hard to even help each other through each day?",
        "A: You know, that was a new meaning the lag -- lager sisters. And one of -- no, a few groups,\nyou know, went together, especially was working for me at the slave labor camp, were three of\nus, very close, you know, we were helping each other in every way. We watch each other, you\nknow, that he is okay, she is okay. And yes, there was. In Auschwitz, you know, there\nsometimes, by accident, like my cousin and daughter, they took her there, you know, they were\ntogether. Or sisters, like my friends, these sisters. So it means a lot, you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s means\nlife, too, because one of them was, you know, something happening with one of them, that was\nhelping hand right away. If not real sisters, you know, as we called there the lager sisters. It was -\n- yes.",
        "Q: And what did you talk about together during the days?",
        "A: Probably as ever, food. Most of that time. I remember in the slave labor camp, av -- one of the\ngirl was sitting with me who was my lager sister, and she was a married woman, a young married\nwoman, and she was telling me her life story constantly. She has [indecipherable] and I enjoyed\nit, you know? E -- do -- did the work and she was talking, that she was married, but not the real\nlove of her -- his life, a other one, so on. And in the slave labor ca -- I -- slave labor camp, the fa\n-- half of the room was French political prisoners. They were not supposed to talk to us, you\nknow? But some of the girls got even friendly with them, just -- you know, just whatever, during\nno -- sending notes all around. We -- we could hear the -- the news why -- from them, they -- you\nknow, they drop paper or they send letters. And a few of the girls got some food from them.",
        "Q: While you were back in -- in Auschwitz, did you learn more news about the war and what\nwas happening?",
        "A: Just rumors, you know, not -- not too many news. We just know when -- the time when we\ngot there, it was -- always looked like it almost over, you know, even when we got there. It lasted\nabout a year more, but we felt 1t very soon has to be over, if we have just has a opportunity to\nleave from there, because to stay in there, it means, you know, death. We are -- you know, could\nbe safe. Well, wa --we got the slave labor camp, we have to work at least two months to the\nworking place --",
        "Q: Did you know you were going to leave, or how did that happen when you left Auschwitz?",
        "A: Oh, they were told we going for work, everybody happy we got that piece of dress, and a coat\nand shoes, and we got -- everybody got a loaf of bread and a piece of margarine. And we thought\nit will be a long way to get wa -- somewhere. And I did the same thing that -- as usually before,\neat the whole thing at once. I was so sick on that, that I paid for it.",
        "Q: And you were very weak and thin at this point in time?",
        "A: I was very weak and very -- I started to say, when we were walking to the working place,\nwhich was the telephone cam -- factory, I think it still exists. And it was harder and harder. Not\nonly me, for everybody. So we went, you know, arm in arm, having [indecipherable] but I don\u2019t\nthink we could do it too long.",
        "Q: But you weren't worried. As weak and thin as you were, you were not worried before that you\nwould be sent to the crematorium, right? You weren't worried too much about that in Auschwitz?",
        "A: In Auschwitz? Not really, we -- we always hoping that someday we will free, we -- I don\u2019t\nknow, it wasn\u2019t really [indecipherable] believe me, because a lot of people went over there. It\nwas a -- by accident. That\u2019s why I -- sometimes I was asking, why me, when everybody, my\nfamily, my friend, everybody was killed around.",
        "Q: Could you actually smell something from the crematorium?",
        "A: Oh yeah, it was a terrible odor. And you saw the smoke and everything. It wasn\u2019t far from us.\nWe -- one -- you know, at the morning when I stepped out from the barracks -- they already were\nputting out the dead people. I don\u2019t know, I just -- I remember stepping over, you know?",
        "Q: Did you have to get desensitized yourself as well, to make it through? You know, were you --\nit sounds like you somehow kept some kind of optimism.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And at the same times, did you have to lose some of your sensitivity to what you saw, to\nmake it through?",
        "A: I\u2019m sure we did, but we got -- we were medicated, too, you know. That\u2019s why we were\nsleeping constantly. We were medicated. In the meantime, I don\u2019t know, we had -- not some\nhope. For sure we were some hope we would get out from there, especially when -- until my\nfriend was alive. We were -- I don\u2019t know. We saw that a lot of people were taken to work. We\ndidn\u2019t see the people taken to the gas chamber, because they left it there. Finally there wasn\u2019t too\nmany. I mean, relatively too much. But we\u2019ve just heard of what the lageralteste told us, we saw\nthe dead people, and to one side -- we were standing outside, a big van passed by with ma -- with\nnaked bodies, dead bodies. Very shocked.",
        "Q: Were there people -- were there women who died in -- in your barracks, in your area, on a\nregular basis? Around you, right around you, did -- were women dying there from --",
        "A: You know, I wa -- I wasn\u2019t staying in the barracks from Nyiregyhaza. We were st -- I was\nstaying with -- I was staying with my friend, but I don\u2019t know. Not -- for Nyiregyhaza, nobody\nw-went back, except my friend and my cousin, a-as I mentioned. Th -- a -- very, very few\npeople, because the whole [indecipherable] city was sent to Auschwitz. In Debrecen was a\ndifference. A few -- a few -- not a few, this one third of people went -- are sent to Austria. At\nNyiregyhaza everybody went. And when I was going through there, you know, to the cemetery,\nthere is not even one face who I know. No Jewish face, nobody.",
        "Q: So now tell me a little more details w-when you left Auschwitz and how you got to the next\nplace, and where you went.",
        "A: As I told you, we went -- we were told we were going f -- to work, so we went over there, that\nplace. It was a big, large stone barracks. I don\u2019t know what was it before, but we were locked in.\nOn the basement was a kitchen. They were the lucky one, you know, who were working in the\nkitchen, they always have enough food. I remember once I sold one of the women -- I had a coat,\na -- it was a summer coat, actually, but the lining, I take it out. They made a blouse out of\nmaterial for -- on it, and I got I think three or four e-extra plate of soup. And what can I tell, we\nwere walking over there, SS woman -- this time woman was si -- st -- staying with us, and\nescorted us to the working place. We don\u2019t -- we don\u2019t see any more, it was a -- it was supposed\nto ba -- be -- we -- we saw it later on, a beautiful factory, beautiful place, but we saw only one\nroom. We went over there, we got your work, which wasn\u2019t very difficult. We have to check the\n-- how you call it -- part of the airplane [indecipherable] we have to check you know, the -- the\nwire on it, which was nothing. They didn\u2019t use that part [indecipherable] the Germans later on.\nAnd we were talking. We weren\u2019t -- were not supposed to talk while somebody came, you know.\nShe -- we were quiet that. That was -- it was the only entertainment. We thought, you know, she\nwas talking, I was just [indecipherable |",

        "Q: Did you -- did you feel like when you left Auschwitz that you were going to something\nbetter?",
        "A: Bet -- yeah, right. We were very hap -- happy. We were, you know, looking forward to that.\nWe felt maybe we survived. If we going to work for them, you know, they won\u2019t kill us right\naway. But they don\u2019t have a chance. In fact -- and one time I find out that there are people here\nin United States from [indecipherable]. I got these letters, and I called up the registration. I talked\nto Meagan, okay. She told me there are -- oh yes, there are a lot of -- I says, how many\u201d She said\nabout 49. I was shocked. She didn\u2019t tell me any name or nothing. She said, if you want to get\ncontact, send me a letter, and I send back to them, which I did. I get a lot of response, telephone\nand letters and even I find somebody who 1s in Jersey. Unfortunately -- she is about my age, she\ngot a stroke or something, she hardly could speak. A very good looking girl was. Anyway. And\na-all of them was very happy to hear some -- from somebody. They talked, they -- we should\nmeet, and I find out in that place where I thought we were alone, 200 women, we were 200 taken\nfrom Auschwitz, that not far on that area, there was 300 other women. We never saw them, they\nnever saw us. They just heard about it through that people, was taken there to -- in the stone\nbarracks. And I was in contact with them for awhile, and I had the accident where I wa -- we\nused to live in Suffolk, Long Island. Every morning I was walking around about two miles, you\nknow, I had to walk. And I didn't notice [indecipherable] cement block was sunk, and I tripped,\nand I fell. I broke my arm, my face was broken, and I hurt my neck, which was already ma --\ndamaged. So I was in very bad condition, and I stopped the connection. Since then we moved,\nand you know, I -- I always think maybe I should call. I even talked to that girl who 1s in Jersey\nthat we will meet. I invited them to our house. She said why don\u2019t -- we are going because she is\nsick. I just remember her, you know, a very good looking young girl, exactly about my age, and\ngot a stroke about a few years back. She said the only thing which she has no -- hard to si -- talk,\nyou know, damage of talking.",

        "A: At the morning, you know, we got some black coffee and a piece of bread, and we were -- we\nhave to walk over there to the factory. And as I said, it was every day harder and harder. I\nmentioned to you before that letter which came from the city or town [indecipherable], a teacher\nwrote me when they find out, you know, for -- at the registration that I was there. And he -- she\nask me to write it down, my experience, she were a teacher in the school.

And -- oh, I have to mention\ntoo, my last few days after the liberation, it was -- it was just a nice end, you know, the whole\nthing. We\u2019re sitting -- after the Russians were [indecipherable] Russian ha -- soldiers liberated\nus, they went through on the village, and the most of the girls -- as I said, there about 200, a few\nless because they passed away, went to the town to look around, but begging for food, and I\nthink they went to see [indecipherable] later, you know, there is a big town too. And m-myself\nand other five or six girl -- oh -- were sitting outside, this is a very nice -- it was May, very nice\nday. And a German came, a civil, and he ask us about her -- his coat, that somebody stole his\ncoat. Which wasn't impossible because we -- there was a restaurant around the corner, and my f -\n-  -- other girls and myself, we went to where the -- nobody was there, they left -- they fled from\nthe ger -- Russians. So, but [indecipherable] so, we [indecipherable] the top. But she wa -- he\nwas looking for the coat, 1s no wa -- none of us knew about that. And he has a gun, and he said,\nif you don\u2019t give us my coat back, I kill you. And turn to the [indecipherable] and I felt funny,\nyou know. Here is the liberation and we will die now. So he sent somebody oh -- with her -- him\nto the barracks, he will [indecipherable]. So one of the girls runs inside, he -- you know, looked\nevery bed. And naturally he didn\u2019t find nothing. And we thought [indecipherable] he left, but it\nwas a -- it was just a funny finish for that experience.",
        "Q: Was it hard to believe that -- that you were truly liberated, that the war was truly over?",
        "A: No, we are -- we were very happy. We believed it before this happened, or after. Oh yes, we\nknew that. We are very, very happy. We are -- we have only one problem, how we get home. We\ndon\u2019t have money. We tried to get on the train until, you know, the -- the conductor came, we\ndon\u2019t have money, right away he send us down from the train. Sometimes the people, you know,\nwent against him and told him let u-us stay, but most of the time we have to come off. And after\na few days some were walking, and this way I get to Budapest, and we were told where we can\ngo to get some help, Jewish organization and so on. And I had the uncle in Budapest, I went\nlooking for them. And they place was too in the ghetto area and I was told that the -- 1t was\nbombarded, the house was bombarded, and my aunt, and my cousin, who was married, but he\nwas that time alone, her husband was taken away on the forced labor, she had two kids.

We lived -- we used to live one spot, 32 years. We got the\nhouse there finally, and we sold the house, we went to live in Suffolk county, you know? It was a\nvery nice place, actually, we have a very nice place over there, a co-op -- a condo. It was a\nretirement development. The -- as I mentioned, everybody thought this is the end of the world, so\nwe moved here, we sold that place, and we could buy that and move here. We were very happy --\nhappy here, you know, it\u2019s a -- completely -- I don\u2019t know if you heard about it, it\u2019s a very\nJewish neighborhood, a lot of Jewish temple.

        "A: Sure, that time. And we removed the star when we went to the station. But the reason was that\nwe went at night because we want somebody to recognize us, you know, Christian, without a\nstar, walking. Not to mention there was a curfew for the Jews. So --",

We -- what happen --\nwhat will happen now?",

My daughter is a very smart girl, but she never ask me, and I never tell her\nanything. And now, when it was typed on, I ask her, you want a copy? She said no.

And after the [indecipherable] when, you know, what happened, after that I saw him, and he\nsaid it\u2019s a terrible thing what happened here, which I agree. They just came, they don\u2019t care if\nthey die, and killed -- drive away, 6,000 people is -- is just -- he said, you know, what you went\nthrough, the Holocaust was a terrible thing, but it was worse. I said -- I didn\u2019t say nothing,\nbecause he is a very nice man. But this time they killed 6,000 people, and you know, we are still\nin shock because we like that country.

I have a very extended family, cousins and aunts and uncles, lot\nof them, you know. Nobody was there, nobody, not a soul. Then I went back to Debrecen\nbecause I heard that time that some of the people went to Austria, so there are more chance to\nmeet, you know, maybe friend or somebody. But in the meantime in Auschwitz, you know -- I\ndon\u2019t know, I\u2019m going back and forth. If you want me to continue, or --",
        "A: Through that boy who was a -- you know, fleeing from Czechoslovakia. So we went to\nSzeged, to the city, to the second largest city in Hungary. As I said, we rented a room, and we\nmoved there. And for a few weeks we don\u2019t have any problem, the woman was very nice to us,\nyou know, because we said we was -- you know, we came from the bombardment. And -- but\nlater on they started to bombard the Szeged, the big city, and everybody has to go and went down\nto the shelter. And we were afraid to go down, you know, we were afraid to from the\n[indecipherable], we were not ready, you know -- you know, maybe say something, or turn out to\nbe [indecipherable]. And we decided not to go down. We thought it\u2019s less dangerous than go\ndown. But later on they start to tell our landlady why these young girl not coming down and so\non. So we decided that we going [indecipherable] to Budapest. It\u2019s a big city and we, you know,\nsomewhere, get around. And we traveled safely, but when we got down there was a big police\nquota, pick up the Jews, you know? With the yellow star too, was traveling. And they pick u-us\ntoo, and when they saw the paper, you know, it was brand new do -- you know, and we were\nvery nervous probably. They find out, they ask question and yes, so they took a -- took us to the\npolice station with a lo -- with all of the Jews, you know, who were wearing stars or not wearing\nstars. And when we got there, the police -- chief wa -- chief of the police said we will get one\nweek from the -- that place, the [indecipherable], and after that we will go back to the ghetto. But\nafter more than one week, you know, went by, and more and more people came to that place, or\nwas taken to that place. In fact, my friend, her name was Ava, find a lady who was traveling to\nBudapest to her daughter, gave birth to a first grandchild. Her husband was already in forced\nlabor camp. And he was very nice, you know, to a young girl. It was a terrible experience, it was\na [indecipherable] room, a [indecipherable] crowded room with all different kind of people\nbeside the Jews, you know? And I think [indecipherable] the toilet was in the middle of the\nroom, without any wall or nothing. It was the first, you know, demonizing experience. And --",
        "A: Elizabeth [indecipherable]. And Ava was Julia -- Julian [indecipherable]",

        "A: We tried to help each other, the fact that we were not alone, first of all, we were friend, we\nwere not alone, you know, we belong together. Sp -- and specially came this lady who was a --\nyou know, some friend of her mother, and she was about 45 years old and a very nice lady. In\nfact, that time she told us that we left her place -- she was a [indecipherable], and he said her\ntreasure, how -- how you say that, jewelry and everything, you know, where he get, you know,\nex -- exactly explain it to us in case something happen to her that we tell her daughter whatever -\n- which is happen later on. And we went together too from there, after a few weeks. We were sad\nwe were taken in a different camp. And we were -- we were walking to the ra -- the station and it\nwas a big camp. A kapo was there who was the manager, I don\u2019t know what was there before,\nbut we knew that before that it just -- it was a collecting camp. Not only that one, we know there\nare two more of us in Hungary.",
        "A: Sharvar. It was very far from my original, you know, city, Nyiregyhaza, other side of the\ncountry. And we were, you know, we have a little -- we felt a little bit better there because we\ncould, you know, put some curtain up and wash ourself, our -- we have the toilet, you know. I\ndon\u2019t know how many people was there, but at least there was a toilet. And we were waiting\nwhat will happen, we -- we thought something will happen, you know, we can\u2019t be here forever.\nAnd aft -- we stayed there at least a month. Oh, and that place, it was under -- the police\n[indecipherable] was standing under the -- it was a so called gerdarmes? You know that?",
        "A: Gen -- yeah, that\u2019s right. They are very [indecipherable] you know, they don\u2019t tell us\nanything, you know, whatever we asking.",
        "A: Not really personally, no. No. We were a crowd, you know. It was just -- we were no -- when\nwe got to Sharvar already, I -- the -- the camp, we felt like, you know, they were -- we were not\ntreated like a person, just like a number or something, you know? Nobody talked to us, we don\u2019t\nknow what will happen. We can get questioned. At the door was th-this gendares, you know?\nAnd we were there at least a month when they came, the manager, or -- I don\u2019t know how you\ncall him, and told us that we\u2019re taken now for a different camp, and it will take a few days, and\nthere -- there was a counting over there in that -- in Sharvar. Everybody who has money can buy\nsome food for the road. And every time it was some change we were glad, maybe this time we\nwill have a chance to talk to somebody, we know what will happen to us, you know? And when\nwe got to the station -- from that we were walking, and we got -- and we got to the station, there\nwere cattle wagons all over, and there were SS standing at the door. And very fast they put as\nmuch as they can in one wagon. We had hardly any space to sta -- sit like this. We were sitting\non the floor, on the -- our legs. It was really crowded, and they put the two pails in it, you know,\none for toilet, one for we -- water.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And naturally the water never was enough. We were not hungry, we were always\nvery, very thirsty. Sometimes when we went, the wagon -- the trains da -- stopped for some\nreason, and peasant women was all around, and gave us some water, and they changed another\nwoman, the SS changed the pails. And we continue. We -- we went through beautiful area. We --\nI heard a place, you know, like a [indecipherable] but I heard a place before, and you know, we\nlooked out with this small window, and somebody recognized the place, it\u2019s called -- I don\u2019t\nknow how you call it English, in Hungarian mogo shtatra.",
        "A: Beautiful scenery with the mountains. It was a -- a resort area before -- I heard that, you\nknow, it was la-later on, too. It was unbelievable. So we -- we --",
        "A: Yeah, we -- we went through this one. I just remember this one, you know? This is the\nCzechoslovakia, I think now. There are some area which sometimes belong to Hungary,\nsometimes to Czechoslovakia. This -- this time 1t was Czechoslovakia, and -- and I think still it\nis. And we went a few days when the s -- when the train stopped. And we looked out, and we\nsaw, you know, the barracks, with barbed wires all over it. And when they opened the door, a lot\nof SS soldier, and yelling to us, get out, schnell, schnell, out. And everybody keep the small\nthing what they had, you know, package, because they -- it will send after us. We knew that this\ncan\u2019t happen, there was na -- no name on it, nothing.",
        "A: Maybe one sweater, or -- of -- when I was 1n the [indecipherable] house, I had a cousin in\nBudapest, and you cou -- [indecipherable] up and came in, and I gaved her everything. So 1s\neverybody else. This a na -- this lady [indecipherable], who called [indecipherable], she called\nher daughter, they came. She gave her the package, and pocketbook, or whatever. So we left just,\nyou know, what was on us, a sweater, or whatever, not much and some food. But we\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, no, no. They know we are Jewish now, on that time.",

The rest of the people I don\u2019t know, and they were the one who were taken to the\nconcentration camp -- I mean the death camp, the Hungarian camp. And before the\n[indecipherable] you know, we went together, that\u2019s -- as much as they can put that together and\ndeliver it to the station and the wagons. So it -- I didn\u2019t know anybody else beside\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: It\u2019s -- I can\u2019t imagine, I\u2019m not sure. It was days, maybe a week, maybe less. Sometimes we\nstopped for different reason, to change the [indecipherable] beside it, I don\u2019t know why they\nstopped the -- stopped the wagon.",
        "A: It was really sad. It was -- we -- we -- we were very uncomfortable, I don\u2019t have to tell it. We\ncan\u2019t sleep, we can\u2019t eat, we were thirsty and naturally everybody had to use that toilet, very har\n-- it was -- it was terrible smell, terrible smell because of the toilet and because of the people,\nyou know, [indecipherable] you know, putting together. It was a terrible, terrible smell. So, it\nwasn\u2019t a -- I don\u2019t even know where we going. We just think that time it was somehow so\nhopeless.",
        "A: Not much. We couldn\u2019t eat. We had some food, you know. But as I remember back,\neverybody was very, very thirsty, and a -- we have -- we could -- we were thought that\neverybody can drink only three sip from the pail, you know, that went from one to another. It\nwas -- it was not much, you know, so I don\u2019t know if we can even think, it was just a very sad\nand desperate situation. I remember a baby with a -- excuse me, you want to --",
        "A: She was a very small baby and she fe -- she [indecipherable] her in the wagon. Sometimes I\nremember faces, but I think I made the remark about that it -- I don\u2019t think anybody could -- a-at\nleast not too many people came back from that wagon. Not the baby with the mother, not the old\nmen. Not the [indecipherable] who we went.",
        "A: I remember that old man I mentioned, every mor --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: He was praying every morning, and when I, you know, thinking back, that\u2019s sad that maybe\nthis affected me that much that I am not religious any more. He was praying to who? And\nhundred percent that he was -- went right away to the gas chamber.",
        "A: He was an older man.",
        "A: No, I -- no, nothing. I don\u2019t think -- even think about religion, neither one of us. We just, you\nknow, couldn\u2019t believe it, especially after that you know, we couldn\u2019t believe it, what happened.\nIt wasn\u2019t real. And when we stopped finally, and the SS soldiers, you know, start yelling us,\neverybody schnell, schnell, everybody get out in one line, one after the other, and I remember the\nfront of us was this Alma, Namey we called her. Namey means Aunt Alma. And then, you know,\nmy friend and me, and the front of the line there was this German so -- not German how you call\n-- officer, Mengele, we didn't know that. And we saw that the younger people go one side, the\noth -- the older people with children go to other side. So that time we thought this the\n[indecipherable] working people and older one on the -- the child -- mother with children, you\nknow. They put in -- in different place. So we were talking about it, as soon -- you know, slowly\nas we went, and ish -- we knew that is better maybe, for us, do -- working for them. And when\nwe reached this [indecipherable] I mean, officer, he was looking on [indecipherable] you know.\nShe wasn\u2019t more than 45, but she has grayish hair and long shoes, you know, for the traveling,\nshe was wearing. And she to -- y-you know, waved her to go this side. And she knew that is not a\ngood thing going with the older, and the ki -- and the kids. And she was speaking in German, and\nshe -- she told him, [indecipherable] I can work, I am able to work. And she look at him, and --\nyou know. She was in that -- he [indecipherable] her again that go that side. I remember I looked\nat her, you know. He went -- she went like this, like somebody she knew that it doesn\u2019t, you\nknow, it\u2019s not good what will happen to her.",
        "A: No, it was just, you know, a matter of second. Later on her daughter visited me, came to\nDebrecen, because I-I send a message that I was with her mother, and you know, I told her really\nthat she find a thing what she told us. And after that, her father -- her husband came too. She\nasked me to go to the rabbi and make a statement that I saw her to go to the other side. She\nwanted to get married, it was very shortly after the thing. So I went to the rabbi. He send me a\nbig bucket of flowers, anyway.",
        "A: Not really, I si -- I study German in the school, in the high school, you know, but it wasn't\nmuch. It wasn\u2019t much.",
        "A: No, beca -- in the camp? No, because all of the people around me, it was, you know mostly\nJewish -- maybe they spe -- spoke Yiddish. Unfortunately Hungarian Jew very rarely speak\nYiddish.",
        "A: Hungarian. And when I got to the camp finally, [indecipherable] I lefting out some -- how I\ngot there -- anyway, I find out that the people from Nyiregyhaza, my original city where I was\nborn, all of them th -- one lager, in the same -- it was the C lager, in one barracks. So --",

        "A: Exact date? I\u2019m not sure, you know, because we been in Sharv -- we been first at the -- the\n[indecipherable] house, then Sharvar -- about a week, in Sharvar about maybe four weeks. So it\ncould be May, around May.",
        "A: I was in [indecipherable] until October --",
        "A: You know what? I was spending time almost all the barracks, because as -- you know, the\nselecting of people, Mengele, every day, we always stay behind. We went through -- from\nbarracks to barracks, finding out. This is the -- we have a [indecipherable] there, you know, and\nthe -- it wasn\u2019t regular toilet, 1t was call -- so-called -- I don\u2019t know how to say English, latrina?",
        "A: Yeah, okay.",
        "A: That\u2019s the [indecipherable] here. This is the -- which lager is this?",

        "A: The whole --",
        "A: The C?",
        "A: Yeah, I was here. I was here somewhere, la -- lager C. In fact, they called the lager C the\nfarnichtenslager, you know, because everybody either went for work, or the rest of them went to\nthe camp -- I mean, the gas. So -- I don\u2019t know about wa -- oh, when we arrive, I like to go back\nthere. We went in stripe uniform or what -- I don\u2019t know how to call it, men took us over. Then\nwe went for awhile, and ja -- and Polish woman took us over, and I was told get the -- undress,\neverybody. And the men was walking around us, you know? They don\u2019t pay any attention to us\nanyway. They were very, very rude to us.",
        "A: Later --",
        "A: No, they are the ja -- and -- later I understand, you know, because they were there three, four\nyears already in the camp before we got there. Hitler occupied Hungary that -- for the last\ncountry, and they -- we were told several times, the Hungarian ladies, they were, you know, at\nhome in the -- comfortable and nice when we were already here. And as I understand later that\nthese people has to put their own family to the gas chamber and the cremat -- crematorium. So\nwhen we got there already, they were not human being. At first this was shocking you know,\nwhen they yell at us, and sometimes they slapped people on the face, and they very rude. But\nlater on I thought I\u2019m not surprised they -- I\u2019m not human being any more. They were not human\nbeing any more. They were survive -- few, not too many, but they paid the price.",
        "A: Like -- between us?",
        "A: The hu -- no, it wasn\u2019t, no.",
        "A: Not only that, you know. When we finally get to C lager, after you know, the certain\nprocedure what they did for us, what we got for -- for -- let\u2019s see, for breakfast, a big plate, was\nblack coffee, which was medicated already. And we constantly sleeping, so it was one reason\nnobody was fighting. The other -- and we realized was we saw me-medication in it, because the\nwomen stopped menstruating, you know? But it was when we got the borax already. Before that,\nyou know, we had to -- you want me to go back? The -- he -- they told us to get undressed, and\none woman cut all the hair on your -- all -- all of the body. And they -- we got some disinfectant\non our body, and everybody got some piece of dress, it wasn\u2019t a dress, sometimes a skirt or a\nblouse, or whatever, it\u2019s fits, not fits. And most of the time it not -- doesn\u2019t fit. And finally we\nwere tol -- we were, you know, put in a line again, but I remember back at that time -- I couldn't\neven think. I was like a -- foggy, you know? It couldn\u2019t happen. I couldn\u2019t believe it, what\nhappening, you know? I -- it was just unreal. So we went to the barracks, and everybody was told\nto climb up, it was wooden barracks, wooden bunk bed. Five people up, five people down. And\nwe climb up and we -- we just [indecipherable] thing to sleep, they were so tired. But the thing\nwas, if somebody want to turn, everybody has to turn. And, you know, like -- like a\n[indecipherable]. And in the morning when we were given coffee, we were told to go and sit\ndown in one line, and the front of us, the first one, got the big dish with black coffee. And he di -\n- he d -- he was told, drink a few, drink and give it back until it went all the way. At first it was\nterrible, you know, drinking after so many people. But it wasn\u2019t later, we don\u2019t care.",
        "A: You mean the whole barracks? As I remember correctly, it was 800, a thousand people in one\nbarrack -- barracks. Maybe I\u2019m wrong, but I think that was the number.",
        "A: Yes, yeah, I was with my friend, and three other people, and it was little, we thought, maybe\nbetter the other place, so we went -- nobody cared, we went from barracks to barracks to try out.\nBut during the day we were sleeping constantly. That was the only time we could sleep\n[indecipherable] on the floor out -- outside, because on the bunkbed, you know, it was very bad.",
        "A: We got in the morning black coffee and some kind of soup for lunchtime, I think. And at\nnight -- first we -- at the morning, s-standing appelle. You probably heard about it. The\nlageralteste came and counted with her [indecipherable], and then the SS came and counted us,\nand naturally, it n -- it never s -- never was all right, the number never was all right. So they\nstarted again, it takes hours. And we thought, and is probably true, it was one kind of torture.\nYou standing there on the sun, or -- or rain, or whatever. And the same thing happened at night,\ntoo. And when we standing in the appelle at night, we got a piece of bread, and something went\ninto the piece of [indecipherable] it\u2019s cheese or something. Was piece of salami [indecipherable]\nprobably, I don\u2019t know what was it. Most of the people make very small slices, you know? They\nmake it for the whole day, like paper, try to make it. And me and my friend we eat it at -- right\naway. We thought maybe we feel like eat something -- eat something. And then I went to visit\nmy friend I mentioned before on the lager, where the Nyiregyhaza, you know, most of the\npeople, all of the people of -- from Nyiregyhaza. I find a cousin there, and she had a -- about 13 -\n14 years a daughter with her. They survived. They came home. Unfortunately my cousin, after a\nfew years, passed away in cancer. And the girl who was with her, still in Nyiregyhaza, I ha -- I\nnever saw her since then, alone, completely alone. She got married, but she lost her husband and\nsh -- first she lost her mother at home. And she\u2019s completely all alone, and sh-she is not even\nhealthy. She\u2019s a heart trouble, and so on.",
        "A: Every day came Mengele to select people for work, and we always hoping, my Ava and me,\nto go, you know, to -- we were hoping that he select us, because you know, the rumor was that\n[indecipherable] stay here, going to the gas.",
        "A: A lot, almost every day. We can see the smoke, you know, we can see this, you can smell this,\nyou know, odor, [indecipherable]. And we were reminded by the lageralteste this -- you will go\nover there, where to see where your parents and relatives are. They don\u2019t -- they don\u2019t care any\nmore, because you know, they went through. You know, it was first unbelievable for us to -- I\nthought he just -- she just talking, but she wasn\u2019t talking. And we always left behind because\nMengele came every day, we were very, very skinny, both of us. 17 years old, on\n[indecipherable] was hungry and -- and he selected us, you know, send back always. So it\nhappened one time that -- there was a so-called child lager, child oc -- they were put over there, I\ndon\u2019t know what is, and I-later they disappeared. And it was empty, and that day Mengele came\nand selected a group, and for some reason, I never know why, they put the older people in that\nbarrack and we find out that they coming for it the following day. But this time they said, as\nalways, he separated friends, or sisters, or mother and child, or whatever. And they were crying\nand begging her to stay there. They rather stay there than going away and left them. But 0 -- of\ncourse it was nothing to him. So during the night, at least one-third of the people fled\nsomewhere. They were locked in and lageralteste all over, and they somehow got out. Windows,\nand -- you know, they don\u2019t care if they beating them, or what. They get out. And they -- we saw\nthe, you know, the problem what the lageralteste has. They had to have the number to -- the --\nthe right number. So my friend and me, and a lot of other people run in, you know? We were\neven more than it needed, and they li -- they put out -- after they got the -- counted, they put out\nthe -- which are not -- don\u2019t needed, to the [indecipherable] and we s -- we stay inside. Can I stop\n[indecipherable] [tape break]",
        "A: It was probably from May to October. October, it was, you know, four already, and at least\nthree-quarter of the lager, the camp C lager, was out already. We were just the so-called\nleftovers. And for awhile seemed to us it\u2019s hopeless, but as I mention before, it happen that a\nselected group was staying 1n a -- was locked for the night in a former chi -- children barracks.\nAnd you know, some people run out, and we went, you know, we thought, with my friend Ava to\ntry to get in. And we were successful for awhile. It was a following day Mengele came, and --",
        "A: Mengele, yes. Mengele we knew already. Yes.",
        "A: He was a very handsome man. Looking back, I wouldn\u2019t recognize him. Very handsome, very\ngood looking. And ha -- very mean. I mean that.",
        "A: Not personally, but every selection, almost every day, you know, we saw him -- a saw us, and\nyou know, selected our -- our -- us out.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: He came, but that time he was just interested about the numbers, you know, that the number is\nthe same. But my friend Ava has a lot of bug bite on her stomach, and you know, she -- it was\nitchy, and it was bloody. And she hi -- he notice right away, so he put her aside -- put him aside.\nAnd we were taken out very fast, so the [indecipherable] was okay, so we taken off very fast. We\nare taken to the lager B. We didn\u2019t know that time that that is the crematorium or whatever it is.\nAnd we were put in a barrack -- barrack, and later I find out that Ava, -- that was informally in\nthe B lager -- B lager, and she was taken there, too, to [indecipherable]. Later, somebody saw her\nin berge -- Bergen-Belsen, so evidently she was taken from there too. So --",
        "A: No, she\u2019s not. She\u2019s not. I went back to the city, I met with her parents and I live with them\n[indecipherable] parents, I waited for hi -- her to come back. And she was very friendly before\nwe left with the [indecipherable]. She came back after the liberation looking for her. I was\ncorresponding with him, but he was -- he [indecipherable] find out that he is there or not.\nAnyway, I\u2019m going back to the selection.",
        "A: Not good-bye, I met her once more. When we were in that barrack, we were closed in in the\nbay -- B lager, lager B. And this time everybody was very careful, even the haftlings, you know?\nNobody can -- got in or out because everybody want to get out from Auschwitz. We thought --\nand we -- we were told that we going for work. So it was impossible to get in. So some day Ava\nheard about it we are there [indecipherable] and came to the window. And we are talking, and\nright away, you know, that was around us, that -- because I ask, you know, maybe she can come\nin over the window, it was y -- no, they said no, not really, no, they don\u2019t let her in. But it wasn\u2019t\na good-bye because we knew that -- we didn\u2019t know that time which day we are going, maybe\nshe will come back again, but she never did. That was the last time I saw her.",

She was very mean, and\nshe was right, you know\u201d? It was -- I didn\u2019t mention we were standing in the appelle, staying up, a\n-- and one of the girls start to saying her favorite recipe, a food, and everybody was listening,\nenjoying it, everybody has different recipe, and we enjoyed it, you know, that we spend time\nwith this cooking.

And specially remember a gir -- girl, a lageralteste, he was a Czech origin.\nHer name was Vera Fisher, a large, heavy-set woman with a very bad complexion. She was very\nmean. She was -- she was nothing to sl -- you know, slap somebody on the face or kick her,\nwhatever. And she was speaking Hungarian, you know, because the -- most of the Czech at -- at\nthe border, you know, is Hungarian Czech or Slovakia\u2019s neighbors.

So we went to the -- we went to the -- there was a bath over there, we\ncould wash. Not every lager, the C lager happens to be -- has a bath. We have enough water.\nThey mention to me, my friends, one of the B lager, they don\u2019t have enough water, they were\ndelivering the water to them. And yes, I remember once when I was -- Ava and me standing in\nappelle, the other three girls, was three sisters who I know from Nyiregyhaza, we were very good\nfriend one --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: As I said, there were th-three sisters, and one of my was very good friend who w-we both\nbelong to the same organization, a Zionist organization. Anyway, we later -- they -- we were\nstanding five of us, and always the -- one of the sister get at the front. First we don\u2019t realize what\nhappening, then they -- here was the bread, and the piece of water, what they gave us, to us. They\nalways choosed -- it wasn\u2019t cut exactly the same, but every bite was counted, you know? So we\nrealized finally, all -- we always getting the smaller one.

We watch each other, you\nknow, that he is okay, she is okay. And yes, there was. In Auschwitz, you know, there\nsometimes, by accident, like my cousin and daughter, they took her there, you know, they were\ntogether. Or sisters, like my friends, these sisters. So it means a lot, you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s means\nlife, too, because one of them was, you know, something happening with one of them, that was\nhelping hand right away.

She has [indecipherable] and I enjoyed\nit, you know? E -- do -- did the work and she was talking, that she was married, but not the real\nlove of her -- his life, a other one, so on. And in the slave labor ca -- I -- slave labor camp, the fa\n-- half of the room was French political prisoners. They were not supposed to talk to us, you\nknow? But some of the girls got even friendly with them, just -- you know, just whatever, during\nno -- sending notes all around. We -- we could hear the -- the news why -- from them, they -- you\nknow, they drop paper or they send letters. And a few of the girls got some food from them.",

It lasted\nabout a year more, but we felt 1t very soon has to be over, if we have just has a opportunity to\nleave from there, because to stay in there, it means, you know, death.

It\nwas a -- by accident. That\u2019s why I -- sometimes I was asking, why me, when everybody, my\nfamily, my friend, everybody was killed around.",
        "A: Oh yeah, it was a terrible odor. And you saw the smoke and everything. It wasn\u2019t far from us.\nWe -- one -- you know, at the morning when I stepped out from the barracks -- they already were\nputting out the dead people.

We saw that a lot of people were taken to work. We\ndidn\u2019t see the people taken to the gas chamber, because they left it there. Finally there wasn\u2019t too\nmany. I mean, relatively too much.

I remember once I sold one of the women -- I had a coat,\na -- it was a summer coat, actually, but the lining, I take it out. They made a blouse out of\nmaterial for -- on it, and I got I think three or four e-extra plate of soup. And what can I tell, we\nwere walking over there, SS woman -- this time woman was si -- st -- staying with us, and\nescorted us to the working place. We don\u2019t -- we don\u2019t see any more, it was a -- it was supposed\nto ba -- be -- we -- we saw it later on, a beautiful factory, beautiful place, but we saw only one\nroom.

In fact -- and one time I find out that there are people here\nin United States from [indecipherable]. I got these letters, and I called up the registration. I talked\nto Meagan, okay. She told me there are -- oh yes, there are a lot of -- I says, how many\u201d She said\nabout 49. I was shocked. She didn\u2019t tell me any name or nothing.

Unfortunately -- she is about my age, she\ngot a stroke or something, she hardly could speak. A very good looking girl was. Anyway. And\na-all of them was very happy to hear some -- from somebody. They talked, they -- we should\nmeet, and I find out in that place where I thought we were alone, 200 women, we were 200 taken\nfrom Auschwitz, that not far on that area, there was 300 other women. We never saw them, they\nnever saw us. They just heard about it through that people, was taken there to -- in the stone\nbarracks. And I was in contact with them for awhile, and I had the accident where I wa -- we\nused to live in Suffolk, Long Island. Every morning I was walking around about two miles, you\nknow, I had to walk. And I didn't notice [indecipherable] cement block was sunk, and I tripped,\nand I fell. I broke my arm, my face was broken, and I hurt my neck, which was already ma --\ndamaged. So I was in very bad condition, and I stopped the connection. Since then we moved,\nand you know, I -- I always think maybe I should call. I even talked to that girl who 1s in Jersey\nthat we will meet. I invited them to our house. She said why don\u2019t -- we are going because she is\nsick. I just remember her, you know, a very good looking young girl, exactly about my age, and\ngot a stroke about a few years back.

I still have a friend, we talking every day,\nmeeting every week. She\u2019s a widow, and another one who lost her husband, all of them\nsurvivors. We have a few around here. That was one of the reason that we moved here. They not\ndriving, and we said -- they came together once over there, and they said, I should understand it\u2019s\nvery, very far from everybody. My daughter is came every week over there, but it must\n[indecipherable] here, too. And my gr -- one of -- grandson lives here in the neighborhood.",
        "A: Up to -- that time, no. Because you know, they started to go back to old lifestyle, you know?\nThere wasn't enemy, you know. And they were, you know, they started a new -- to make a --\nsorry, it\u2019s a cramp.",
        "A: I\u2019m okay. They started to build a new life, getting married. One of the uncle getting married --\ngot married, he -- his father got married, we got married. So we started a new life, and after\nawhile it was okay.",
        "A: Right after when I got home. Actually, he -- he used to go out before me with a girl who went\nto Auschwitz, for awhile, and you know, didn\u2019t come back. He came -- you know, we went out\ntogether. We got married -- 1956 we started, and \u201957 -- ah, 46, and \u201947 we got married. And we\nlived there for awhile peacefully, until you know, the Communist regime. But there wan --\nwasn\u2019t any way to leave the country that time.",
        "A: 1956 there was a big revolution, and the borders was open [indecipherable] and every kind of\npeople, you know, who were not allowed from the -- from the -- anywhere, th-the most -- lowest\npeople, you know, came around and they hanged people and -- and so on. And they started to\ntalk again -- against the Jews, everything -- the Jews was the reason this happened and so on. So\nmy daughter was about seven years old, and I was thinking it\u2019s just can\u2019t happen to her again,\nwhat happened to me. So it was -- we decided to leave. And this girl I mentioned who was my\nfriend, who was -- came back from Austria with her husband and that was a [indecipherable] and\nthe [indecipherable] my husband, we decided together to leave the country. So we just walked\nout, left everything, and we -- we were traveling to the city, which 1s a -- at the borderline, it\u2019s\ncalled Porshoi, and now it belongs to -- belongs to Czechoslovakia anyway. And we got so-\nsomebody -- lot of people le -- left that time, you know, 1956. So somebody recommended as a\nleader who can\u2019t really let leaders through the border, and you know, we were walking through\nto Austria. And we were staying in Austria at least a month. That was a, you know, Jewish --\nHIAS it\u2019s called, what, you know, arrange the coming. And eventually we got here, 1950. We\nleft n -- Budapest 1956, December 10, and we got here 1957, February, my -- my daughter\nbirthday, February of the fifth, you know? And I have an uncle and auntie in the Long Island, we\ngot the, you know, apartment from them. And we start our life. We didn\u2019t like it here because\nthere wasn\u2019t any -- my husband s -- actually, I was pregnant and I lost the child. I was four\nmonths pregnant. My husband was working and there wasn\u2019t any transportation, only the\nrailroad. And we can\u2019t see our friends, we couldn\u2019t travel anywhere, we were very lonely here.\nSo we moved to the -- to Brooklyn first, and we were -- were living then [indecipherable], we\ncame back to live here in the island. We lived -- we used to live one spot, 32 years. We got the\nhouse there finally, and we sold the house, we went to live in Suffolk county, you know? It was a\nvery nice place, actually, we have a very nice place over there, a co-op -- a condo. It was a\nretirement development. The -- as I mentioned, everybody thought this is the end of the world, so\nwe moved here, we sold that place, and we could buy that and move here. We were very happy --\nhappy here, you know, it\u2019s a -- completely -- I don\u2019t know if you heard about it, it\u2019s a very\nJewish neighborhood, a lot of Jewish temple. It has a reputation everybody\u2019s a millionaire, which\nis not true. At least I didn\u2019t me -- I don\u2019t know nobody -- I don\u2019t see nobody saving account, but\nin this house, I didn\u2019t see anybody who 1s -- actually, there is a lady upstairs who 1s a survivor,\ntoo.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. As I think I mentioned before, I don\u2019t think anybody, whoever it is, or\nshe is -- come to the mind the name George Hirsch -- Hirsch, maybe, he was a survivor. I don\u2019t\nthink anybody could not affected all her lifetime, what happened, in one way or a other, no I\ndon\u2019t think so. It\u2019s always -- still, we\u2019re talking.",
        "A: No. I know some people became sick. No, but I tried to getting over in a way that I raised the\nchild, as I mentioned, and I don\u2019t want her to be affected, which I -- it -- I was mistaken. It could\nnot happen. It could not happen. [indecipherable] She\u2019s a very sensitive girl. She -- she knew\neverything, what happened, how it happened, but some way she doesn\u2019t want to hear my story in\ndetails, you know? She\u2019s very good to us, you know, she know both of us survivors and she try\nto help us. And I don\u2019t mean ma -- financially. We don\u2019t need that, thanks God. You know, we\ngetting from the Germans, and pension and we have enough to -- you know.",
        "A: Yeah. But it was a one time payment, the slave labor, yeah. And we got some money, well not\nthe big money, a thousand, each of us. Actually, my dau -- my husband didn\u2019t even get it yet,\nfrom the Swiss. But we got, every three months, some money from the Germans which, this\nhelps.",
        "A: Specially what happening now? Yes. Yes, I -- I li -- do, because it\u2019s like we coming to the\nwar situation here. Everybody is -- even then, the d -- American people doesn\u2019t know what is the\ndeal, war, you know\u201d? Forget about the Holocaust [indecipherable], you know. We got -- we\ndidn\u2019t have enough food, we don\u2019t have nothing. And we were constant fear from the\nbombardment.

And I still saying 1s a -- this is a beautiful country, this is a wonderful country. Some\npeople not realizing it, believe me. They taking for granted.
