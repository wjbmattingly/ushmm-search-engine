        "A: So I went uh to the school in a normal...what is an elementary school and to mention\nsomething uh I have had a very bad feeling there because in these years when I was six,\nseven years old, it was a big anti...anti-Semitism in Hungary. This was the\ncounter-revolution after uh after a short Communist revolution in Budapest in Hungary\nand it was like...as a little girl I have had always a feeling that I am not in raspberries\n(ph)...that I was a good student but I was always dessert (ph). First and the second must\nhave been...just a young girl and uh grade and everything was a big difference. I was a\nvery still, very frightened as a girl and it was interesting in our family that after the\nelementary school there four years, I asked my mother that I want to go in a private\nJewish school. This was uh it...this was a private school and my mother was very\nastonished why how I am getting in these uh in these \u2014_\u2014_s and I told her I I must go in\nthis school. I am not going farther to the to the normal school, and because I was a good\nstudent, student I get a a (cough) bonus from the from the fees what what was necessary\nto to pay there and in the first time when I was in this in surrounding, I became happy,\nvery 1n a good mood and a quite a different person, so I was at home, and I finished four\nyears in this school. THen I made a one and a half year uh course uh course...",
        "Q:",
        "A: Yeah. And then I went back on to work, like a a young secretary and later I I was\nworking. I have had only two...first place I was one and a half years...like a telephone\n_____and five years in one place and ten years when I was in another uh job where I\nwhere I made everything for import/export firm. At the time I was getting a big prices\nand I was keeping the books and correspondence, yeah, and everything what was uh what\nwas necessary. This was still...see the last time before I became married.",
        "Q: What were uh the young working woman uh just before you married...uh you were in\nBudapest...what was Budapest like at that time?",
        "A: Lovely. (Laughter) ___ was a happy person because I have had the real feeling that it\nvery good to be to be young in Budapest. It was a very very nice uh...it 1s a very nice\ntown and I have had a very interesting uh company, mainly Jewish per...people but not\nonly. Uh my company...I get my company...after my two sisters, because I have had two\nsisters in the company and I was the little one and I went in in this the same company, so\nin general the boys, the company was about eight, nine, ten years older than I. They was\nmainly intellectual persons. They was uh they came back from several universities, from\nParis, Sorbonne, Rome, even Prague because there was such a anti...anti-Semitism in\nHungary that for Jewish people it was very difficult to get a a place or the possibility to\ngo in the university, so a lot of Jewish uh youths went out...mainly Paris, , even\nVienna, Paris, Rome, Prague, to learn, so I have had a very interesting and good\ncompany and it was really a wonderful life. The life, 1t was not necessary how much 1s\nthe money or how few is the money. Mainly if you (laughter) but there was not\ninteresting. It was not depend on the on the money the good life. That was a high cultured\nlife, music, museums, theater and only through strolling from Budapest it was a problem.\nIn the old part, Buda...old buildings and only to sit down near the near the _ and to\nlook the _ and the bridges. It was a wonderful life, and it was really...spent a very\njoyful youth there.",
        "Q: How did you...it sounds lovely...how did you meet your husband and when?",
        "A: We find each other... think it was...one moment...the very early autumn from '39. At\nthose time it was very fashionable for young people to make sport and a very popular\nsport was to rowing onthe _, on the Danube. And in this time...this was I think the first\nuh uh the first groups that the Jewish young people was called in called up to make uh\nlabor service, and there was a weekend when I was honest alone, without my company,\nand I decided I am going alone to rowing on the Danube and I and then I find a lady\nfriend and we went two together and there was a little uh not restaurant...a\nbuffet...accidentally and there we find each other...there my my later husband began to\nspeak to me. I was speaking to him. I was in the...I was sure that he must be Christian\nbecause I was sure that all the Jewish uh the Jewish young people is in the labor camp\nand he was out. I was sure that he was a Christian person. I was speaking very\nshortly...his was the first. Then it was a second rendezvous, as you say, and I wanted to\nbe very sure...I wanted to cut these connections because this was not the time to to make\na connection between a Jewish girl and a Christian boy. Even I told to my mother that I\nhave a rendezvous with a...I will make this very short...and we went sitting in a terrace\nnear the \u2014\u2014_\u2014_s and some way it came out that uh that there was some little group, Nilos\n(ph) group, that this was very beginning from the Nilos movement. They were shouting\nseveral slogans and I thought that I hate these people and Szamosi said I hate too. And it\nwas nothing to say because not every Christian person was like this uh Nilos movement\nand I wanted to make sure and I thought because I am Jewish and he was very uh stonish\n(ph) because I was very uh uptight, blonde and alive and he left, wanted to see every\nGerman in this and and he he told I am I am Jewish too. Then I was very (laughter)\nastonished, because I was sure that he is Christian and then even he told I am religious\nand I was very, very astonished that a young person who is going to export on the on the\nDanube...how can . Uh my company was uh better to say...how you say today\nleftist but there was several persons real communists, idealist communists in those time.\nThat was that was under... underground. That in Buda...in Hungary was not communist\nparty. It was forbidden. So I grew out uh up very lef...uh leftist company and I didn't have\nthe _ to be religious and I was asking how, why. Your father is very uh very strong.\nYou must go in the syna...and I don't know. I am going from my home, and it makes me\nvery furious and I didn't finish with this rendezvous. There was another rendezvous\n(laughter) and saw him out inthe the ___ next (laughter)...(pause)...we had a lot of the\ndiffer....different between us because I was as I told uh a leftist and I I was against any\nformal (ph) things and and uh he was more more...how to say this...middle class...you\nknow, these informal to to go to a five o'clock tea, something like this, and I was heard\nthese things so because going together about one and a half years and there was a lot of\ndiscussion between us, but this was like to to make a stone smoother (laughter) and by\nthe end we decided when we are making so nice discussion we can married and continue\nthis (laughter) and these wars (ph). Never boring.",
        "Q: When did you get married?",
        "A: In uh '41, November.",
        "Q: What was it like for your then, in '41 1n November in Budapest, and you're married?",
        "A: So it was quite a...for a short time it was...we was very happy young couple but it was a\nvery short time because in '41...1t was...was, it was more and more difficult to be free\nfrom the from the labor camp, and my husband was again this way because he\ndecided not to go in uh till '40...'41...'42...1t was not so difficult. A little perfection (ph)\nhere, a little money there...something...1t was...several...I was not involved in this. Only I\nknow that he is not at five to go like a cattle. He was a very indi...individual person. But\n'42...yeah...my son born '42...and uh in '42 began the...life began to be more serious and\nmore pressed and uh my my husband begun to make ___ the possibility through\nphysicians to get some false uh uh paper that he is ill in this illness or other illness, not to\ngo in in the labor camp, but it was always more and more difficult and and dangerous to\nplay this way, and he made some ___ operation like like uh abscess...he got some abscess\nand uh profits were made on the operation then he was was always able through me to\nfind a way to to pay somebody to help us and there was literally illness then I was able to\nspeak with this physician or professor to pay something, give a longer time for for this\nillness to__, but every second or third month he got there uh called up to the military\nservice so he find a way...I don't know somebody give this ID...yes...and get and get their\nID when he he can go in a in a mental hospital. Then the military uh military uh police\ncannot take out these people from there, and we paid for somebody a very big amount. It\nwas...I can't remember...ten thousand penge what made ten months , but you\nknow I will not find out that the professor who was the the head from his hospital, he was\nin this , but my husband went in in this uh uh mental hospital and to make a\nlittle shorter the story, he was able to spend there six months. That was a big, big time in\nin the very very dangerous time. I was every day there from forenoon till evening and\nwhat was quite difficult for me that the the physician...he was the respon...responsible for\nthis for this uh part from the hospital...he never asked my husband, yeah my husband\ndecided we didn't know what what this means to be mentally ill, because we'd never read,\nnever learned it was so imm...immediately and my husband thought I decide not to speak\nwith people. I will speak only with you. And and not with the physician and not others,\nbut I didn't know that this is good or not good, so almost every afternoon, evening when I\nwanted to left the hospital, the physician asked me what I have seen, what was the\nbehavior from my husband and almost day after day I was pressed to find out something\nbut give a picture that he is really not normal. He was living...he had he had a separate\nroom and he was speaking, everything, even playing a little cards, but this was not the\nway to to be mentally ill, so always I find out something that I wanted, that he was very\ndepressed and I thought to play a little cards would be...but he was confused and he didn't\nfind the the way how to play, and each time I have had the feeling I was always\n(laughter)...but I was forced to make always these everyday stories that my husband\nreally could be hold uh so with this way I think it finished. He got the papers that he 1s uh\nmentally ill. This was official. There was a a from the state or uh supervisor, a professor\nto make some questions and everything and temporary he he was uh put in...what 1s to to\nsay...I was the responsible for him, you you know this these...and because he had had\nseveraluh __ or real estate places, this was written in the register book that he is he is\nnot right to sign this uh contract or something I am responsible uh temporary, temporary.\nIt was not for another time when the when the professor or somebody will say that he is\nOK, he is healthy, so this was a very difficult time but on the other side it was very\ndifficult every day to go there and to play this play, but on the other side he was safe in\nthere. It was...and several times I have seen that was coming military police to look. He\nwas not alone in this in this mental hospitals. There was about...later we find out...always\nabout eight, ten, twelve Jewish young people but nobody knows that the other other is\nplaying. That was absolute disgrace and uh when I when I have seen from above that here\nis a guard from the military police, then I went down down there. There was a public\ntelephone like I want to speak to somebody and I was able always to speak with the\npeople, and I take out from the officers...and what is what is the name...who are you\nlooking for. I wanted to be prepared but it was quite good in this place and it was quite\ngood as long...my my husband came out I think in the...'43...'43 autumn. And it\nwas...yeah...yeah...yeah...then we leaved our quite private life in our flat, but very very\noften somebody...what is this...somebody's saying against against another\nperson...yeah...yeah...why he is at home, why he 1s not in the military...in the labor\nservice, and it was...we decided, my husband decided that we will take a a second flat, to\nrent a second flat uh place far from Budapest near near a famous lake that is a summer\nplace but it was autumn and we did take a villa there with with our little boy and uh later\nlived there only to visit there from Budapest that the people will forget. And uh not to\ndenounce. It was our place...yeah...till till December I think, uh end of December...we\nrented this for longer time but uh I was pregnant with Mariam (ph) and I get a very very\nheavy..uh I have had this, this was , and the pregnancy made me position that in\nevening I get a back that I was not able to to move, so the next day we we took a\nambulance, and we ran back to Budapest and we there in our flat. Our flat was\nin which is in Budapest like the Champs d'Elysee in Paris and in January Miriam\nborn. I was I was very ill before birth time. I was very ill after that time. I was not able to\nstand up and very very heavy uh pains, so I was in very ill till March, 19th March when\nwhen the army from Hitler arrived to Budapest and this took me up from the from the\nbed. (Pause - drinking) About this date I'm sure that you have heard a lot and my husband\nwas not working. He was an elected person. He was working with his father together, but\nuh before this time quite a...I think a year earlier or what it was taken the license for\nJewish people to to work in these area, so he was...we find a . You know what\nthis...uh uh Christian person and the it was...then he give the name for the firm, and my\nfather-in...father-in-law and my my husband was working in uh behind these these uh\nChristian men name so to make a life, but it was a quite a illegal way but a very common\nway in those time. It was a absolute common way. A lot of people was living in this uh\nliving with this possibility and this was a big possibility for the Christian people to get a\n____ not to work and to get goods already, so everybody was in this way quite happy, the\nChristian and the Jews, so I will continue. The next day to a week came the order to that\nJews must uh hold a yellow star but earlier there was a very terrible stress within the\nJewish people and aterrible __ the first time, prominent Jews and uh a lot lawyers and\nuh like hostages. They didn't know what will be the fate for for these people. These was\ncalled in immediately, mainly disappeared. This was I think the first uh transport of to\ndeported, and what was the Judenrat and you know, what is this uh....so every day a new\nguard order from the __ to this is forbidden and this is forbidden and how to how to\nbea...behave, how to live, and we when we arrive at this time to go out with the to wear\nthis yellow star. It was a terrible feeling, that people with a sign to go on the street. The\nfirst uh several days mainly women went went out, not to mention that very few younger\nun men was at home. It was...the younger age was in the labor service. That was already\ntaken and there were very respectable people and but the first, second day I went out. I\nhave had something to _ in the office and I decided that I am going out. It was like to\ngo ininacold water.| wasan__ and I was not uh...I was sure that I I will not\nincite...insult...1incite. This was a very risky, very that somebody is going out,\nsomebody can spot or insult oreven __, but I was sure that I am not that type and\nnever I was insulted in my life, and I went out. It was a terrible feeling that somebody\ncame against me, very respectable elderly person...like an aristocrat, with a yellow star,\nand to look each other, you you too. You too. And then please wait to go in the street. It\nwas something about the...1n our age, in our lib...liberated uh youth, after our liberated\nyouth, it was so almost impossible to understand that how can people be back in this way\nand to live in this way, but I made a self-suggestion that it is now my shame. It the\nshame, it is the shame who made this with me. It was a brainwash but I made for me. I\nhave a little uh story about in this office...interesting. I went in and there was a a\nautomatic elevator. It was a two...two person was going in and this went up five _. I\nwent in and nearby was a...well a gentlemen about uh forty, forty-five. He saw star...I\nwas with the star, and this was a little problem, and he was looking at me curious way\nand he was asking uh you must wear these or...and then the question was the the __ that\nI making uh the demonstration near the uh to be sympathetic for the Jewish people but\nnever happen in Budapest, but it was known that someplace, some somebody can make\nsome demonstration. This happened inin __ later. We learned this, so the question was\nthis that you must wear this or , and he was looking and and asked me, have\nhave somebody in your family I understand Christian and I never left to finish the\nquestion. And I told yes, Rabbi. He was astonished. And he was looking, he was not from\nBudapest. I I wanted to make a . [told yes, I am from Transylvania. I born in\nTransylvania...I told him a landlo...landlord family. I told no. A pub-owner family.\n(laugher) Then he was looking at me and I arrived __ and he told me if lif lam if I] am\nable to help you or something, my hand was the paper what I wanted to arrange there and\nI made so thank you. I will arrange alone. This was a sympathetic, but this was the first\nday. He wanted to help me someway. I don't know how. I was not a a dangerous type. I\nwas a very Aryan type so this was a quite a good feeling to hear this sympathy of words,\nbut I was very stressed, so this was the first uh uh experience to wear the yellow star on\nthe street. Then we get the proxies later...these was in this way...and our hands like this,\nhands back...give me something like the hand back. We went from the street. We uh uh\nwomen's hold hands back in this way, and to...not all the time to show the...so a part I\nthink I finished and this part from our life. Then came the order that that uh Jewish\npeople must go in several houses to live, every family in one room which is not\ninteresting how how many person...",
        "Q: Please...we'd like to know about this (?)",
        "A: Yeah. A long, long monologue...so that was...several houses was fined. There was some\nwhich area, which houses will be yellow-starred signed houses. Naturally our our\nhome, it was not in this uh because it was a very unelegant place, a very representative\nstreet. They made this into...many of the back streets and mainly the most, most people\nwas Jews in the house. So not far from our house there was...the corner from our\nhouse...the corner was avery famous uhuh __ house, 60. This was a...\ncannot now remember that before the Nilos which part owned this house. Really I cannot\nnow envision, but this was a famous house. Nex...uh next from this house in the back\nstreet there was a house who in this list that this will be a yellow-stared signed house. I\nwas not...uh we was not running to look. We was a little bit para...paralyzed the first\ntime, but uh somebody was ringing and coming and yelling, so and he began to say that I\nhave flattened this house what will be signed for the Jews and I have heard the\nconceriege that here is a Jewish family maybe that we can change the flag. I was quite\napathetic in this because this was sure that this is not to live. It is only a temporary thing.\nWhat will happen with us if it is not the place where we were living, and I went this\nyoung person. I went in the house. He showed me which uh...attached there is two rooms\nand the kitchen and the maid's room and came out a person from the house, a young man,\ngood looking young man and he asked me uh madame, will you come in in this house\nand I thought I don't want to come in. I must come in. He thought come in...there was a\ngood place. I have here a war factory. Uh I am making uh I am making uh noodle and uh\nmacaroni for the military service. Here the door will always will be opened and I have a\ntelephone. And this was not for me. I was not interested in what is this flat. I come back\nand I told Lotzie (ph)...Lotzie is my husband...I find a place. The main thing there is a\nparticular person. He told me that the door will be always open and there is a telephone,\nand this was very very important and we decided to change the flat. We left this our flat\nwith a lot of belongings there and we take the the minimum bedroom and something that\nwas necessary to this flat and we made a friendship with this uh factory owner. He he\nimmediately take us in like a worker in this in this uh war factory. That was a...that gives\na big difference because...uh I cannot remember what was the order that Jewish people\nfrom the from the signed houses can go out between eleven or...till one...something like\nthis, for a short time to arrange something or buy something or was survival was to buy.\nBut the somebody had these these uh document that he is working in for the military,\nmilitary service. This gives a longer uh time to to to strolling outside in the street, and\nthis was very important. So it was quite a, quite a good life. It was written...I was I uh a\nperson always I was looking the good side. Now we are in one room. The other room is\ntook in uh my husband's uh brother, a physician with a wife and two little children and in\nthe maid's room there was a help for me. She was my cooks and she was looking always\nafter my children, uh a Jewish person, a Jewish woman, an elderly woman and there was\nliving eight, nine, nine or ten person in this two-room flat, but there was living. In uh\nduring this time I think it was May...for that and we got a lot of control. I am not a\nhistorian to to...and we had heard that the...in the...what happened in the countryside\neverywhere and what was the meaning ghetto. That I think there was together and what\nthe meaning deportation. Not exactly...only about. We didn't get any any detail how was\nthis deportation...really mainly I, I wasn't not to think about only the bad things. Always I\nI was looking what is deportation. To take the people another place to work. Maybe\nuncomfortable maybe but this is the maximum what uh what I was able to imagine. But\nwe have heard about the concentra...what what is happening on the country. In the\nmeantime I was not very interested with uh Zionist movement. I have heard sometimes\nfrom my husband that he is a Zionist. OK. It's his business, and he went always out from\nthe house...a lot of telephones and he hold his horse on connection, but I was not very\ninterested as long...he was....I think we had had a feeling during July...it was continued\nthis deportation from the country and we began to get the feeling that now is our turn\nbecause this deportation, this ghetto together...put together the people and put in because\nit came very very close to Budapest, till the suburbs. And it was a a feeling that\ntomorrow, after tomorrow our turn is coming. Then uh I think it may be August...we get\nsome some information that what is stopped uh_\u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014sw you know, ...uh stopped the\ndeportations. And he changed the government and will be another uh solution but uh\nwhat will happen with the Jewish population, so we get a little breathe, and uh to change\nthe government it really means a little more liberal and only to hear the the announced\nthat what is stopped, the deportation, so it was a little bit out from the immediately\ndanger, but I must tell you that I didn't shout that the deportation it is dead. I didn't run to\nunderstand. My husband began to speak about this, that you know these people is going\nto . And I told you are crazy. You are speaking something what is believable.\nWhy? When when people must hear...why not in the press, why not make these\norganization and to take children, old people, and my husband told yes, this 1s the sign\nand when the people is taken for the work, why the children, why the old people, why the\nthe ill people, why everybody? These people will bring the and I thought it is\nimpossible. Don't speak in this way. I wanted not to hear it this way, but...so\nwe get a little breathe, a little better feeling and even we began to very optimist,\nvery...that the war must be finished. I think that uh...as a matter of fact we have heard\nwhat is the situation on the on the front and it was far uh after Stalingrad and we knows\nthat the Russian is coming uh closer and closer to to Hungary and really I know I cannot\nuh mention what was the front situation, but it was a possibility to think that we had a\nlittle uh a little uh future, maybe that we will be the only person in Budapest, the only\nJews to survive this with our , without without to take to deport...to be to be\ndeported. That or dead. So it was a quite a good feeling till 16th of October. This was\na...Jf I can good remember a Sunday, a nice autumn Sunday. We went out, my husband\nand I, a little bit strolling on the on the Buda, to get a little fresh air. We uh carved out\nspot and this was a very nice forenoon only it was interesting to see that a lot of\nmilitary uh vehicles went out from Budapest, German military uh uh cars and trucks. The\ndirection was out from Budapest. We have seen this and it was very quiet in the in the\ntown and we came back to this yellow-starred house and something was in the air. It was\nnot announced anything, but everybody had had a feeling this 1s a strange interesting day.\nSomething will happen. In the same day so in the noontime uh not in the our,\nwith whom we changed the the flat, he came in and he told you know Mr. Szamosi when\nsomething will change, we will change back the flat. We had nothing again...uh against\neach other. You are you are agreed that I didn't made anything against you, and my\nhusband thought OK, OK, OK. It was so in the air even the Christian people had had a\nfeeling something good happened in the very very next future. After noon we have heard\nthe declara...uh declaration from ___ that he finished the the the partnership with uh\nwith the Germans. It was to hear it was something that we finished from our side,\nbut in the same time we was with each other, and my husband thought interesting\nthat they are making such a big change. Where is the Hungarian army? How can, how\ncan we change something for such a drastic way. We was coming through the \u2014__ on\nthe bridge what was always uh uh guarded from the Hungarian and from the German\narmy. There was always guards. When we came back there was no guards. There was no\nHungarian and no no German. It was very strange. It was just so...if somebody's thinking\nabout the the _, it must be something. We hadn't hadn't seen any Hungarian uh\nsoldiers during our our stroll, but it was a fantastic uh several minutes to hear this, but in\nour our heart it was not the feeling . We finished. After a...1t was...as we we had\nheard this declaration twice in the radio or three times. Then the radio began to give\nGerman march music, German. There was no Hungarian. It was German. Then after the\nmusic...always very, very military uh music...we had heard voices, a message for uh\nNilos uh leader people. There I will never forget the name that and there was a voice,\nplease come back. please come back. A very uh prominent Nilos. Then I\nhad un we understand that here happened something, what was in a good way but came\nout in the opposite way. And uh then in the same evening we have heard thatuh |\nthat the declaration for is void and the new govern...government 1s the Nilos\ngovernment. The leader is and several other very uh fraidful (ph) for names, anti-\nSemitic persons, Nilos leaders.",
        "Q: Maybe this is the perfect place to pause and change tapes, give you a moment...\nEnd of Tape # 1\nTape #2",
        "Q: OK. We're starting with the end of October 15, 1943...",
        "A: No. No. Yeah. Fifteen October, yes. And and so this was the big change, all the house, all\nthe population from this house, all the people was on the, on the field. Nobody went to\nsleep. We was waiting what will happen with us. Mainly because our house was the very\nfirst house of the Nilos Nilos government take these sixty, this became the\nheadquarter and we was the very first house in the back street for this corner house, so we\nhad the feeling that when they are making something, then we are the first in that\narea...the yellow-star. Everybody was standing. We was...like a guard closed the the door\nfrom the house. We was looking out in the night, during the night. Even the people\npushed there, there was from this war factory, from this noodle factory a truck. They\npushed this the door, not because this was something that saved the house, only a feeling\nsomething to make. We have seen people on the street, groups, guarded with Nilos uh\npeople with a with a gun. I think it was...they went on the street with hand up, mainly\nmen in the direction to the corner house, this headquarter. Nobody knows why, which\nkind of people, Jewish people, so this was the first night. Nobody was sleeping and\nnobody knows what, what will be the next day. There was order that the...after the |\ndeclaration, a lot of houses...the people went to take down the sign. Naturally their first\norder was to put, to return the sign, the yellow...the yellow star was quite a big star, about\nalmost a meter big on the on the houses, and the cur...curfew... what is the...and the\nnaturally we...that that the Jewish people not allowed to go out from the houses.\nThere was every house there was a conceriege or somebody who was responsible. Every\nhouse was a list with a with a...tenants...how many people is there, who is there, and this\nwas the order that nobody can leave the houses. Uh my husband began to speak about\nleaving...we must run out from this house. This was not a question to go out, because the\nconceriege was sympathetic and that was this...a good friend is factory owner and he was\nable, every every time to open the door and to to make something. This was not a\nquestion of where. Where. And this was the first time that my husband took in his pocket\nour uh second identification what he bought...he bought in the very beginning when when\nthe German army came to to Hungary. He had had a imagination that uh he will be able\nto disappear when we are when we are taking other identification for the family like\nChristian people. When I have heard about this and he bought... cannot remember what\nwas the connection, how he bought this from a Christian family...uh the father and the\nmother about the same age like my husband and I with two children. Accidentally the\nname from the children was Peter and I think my daughter was Mariam... _. It was not\nvery far, about the same age and in those time my husband paid paid a nice sum from this\nbut I wanted what to took in my hand. It was something what normal person cannot\nimagine how I carried with that name and other identification and I thought I will not see\nthese. You must put this someplace. I cannot take inthe hand. IfI__ different name\nand they _ different person and this was the time when my husband took this false\nidentification and he put in his pocket and he told he must walk go out from this house.\nAnd I thought no where. I don't know where. I don't know where. There was Miriam. It\nwas October. She was nine years old...big, uh nine months old. Little baby, and my son\nwas two and a half years old, and I thought I don't know where...I I'm not able to go on\non the street. Where? Where? And he told very very strong, I am going and I will be and\nhe gave me an address, a Christian woman...she was my sister's business companion and\nuh my sister and my sisters was living in the same house before the...and he told I will be\nthere and there's where you...and he went out with uh with my son. I wanted not to go but\nhe was sure that when he is going out with my son I will blind go after him, not to think. I\nwas putting something in the carriage for the baby and something...I I cannot remember\nwhat, diapers...something what I put together and I went with this carriage after my my\nhusband and in this house in a very elegant area from Budapest in the\ndowntown, but the downtown was very elegant and I went in in this flat. The\nwoman was at home...a little flat, neat, very neat, a private flat, an older flat and the\nwoman was occupied to airing the fur coats and everything for the next winter and we\nwas, and I arrived there like in a trance. She was speaking...I don't know...she told\nme...this I remember...she told me you know that you cannot remain here because the\nconcereige knows you, and I said yes, I know. But only I want for a little bit to sit down\nand to think what to make. We went out from the house because there was no place and\nthere was really no place because the concerige was __. I was almost every day there\nin the in the better time when my sister was living there, so we went from the street,\nafternoon, late afternoon, little rain and what an idea what we are making during the\nnight uh during the night and slowly slowly it became dark. Then I find out thata\ngoes in from Transylvania. She married a Christian person and she came several months\nearlier, left Transylvania what was closer to the to the Russian Russian frontier and I\ndon't know how I was able to remember for this address, but I am going this 1s my only\nperson, half Christian...they they was living like Christian because her husband was\nChristian, and I thought this is the only address I can go in. Now I I cannot remember\nwhich direction, which place was this. I find with , and there was a sub-tenant in a\nflat. We went in. The lady from the...the owner from the flat let let us in, come in and I\ntold to my cousin that we had no other way. We must remain below some some roof\nbecause it is raining and dark and there was there was black-out and cur...curfew and uh\nshe was a very lovely person. She told OK. If you have a possibility, you must speak with\nthis lady from the from the flat, and I immediately find out this... went on in the corridor\nand I told that we are living...we are a family and we are living in Buda. I don't know that\nyou get information from Budapest that it is two part...Pest and the Danube and the other\npartis Budaand __ bridges ____ two part, and I told that we are living in Buda. We\nwas in the other part, in the part of Pest, and we wanted to go home but the, all the\nbridges 1s blocked with the with the Nilos soldiers and uh forbid for people to to cross the\nbridges. We are not able to go home. We must spend one night here in this side from\nBudapest. If it's not against this that we remain here in this uh....and she told OK. This\nroom was, I cannot say in feet...1t was five ___ meters. It is a maid...1t was for a maid.\nThere was one bed and maybe another place like one of the half bed. We made some\narrangements for the night. The two men was on the floor, lying on the floor. My cousin\nand I in the bed, and near our feet my two and a half year old boy, and Miriam in the\ncarriage for the for the night, so we spend the night there. To spend the night but not to\nsleep, and this was the second night that I was not sleeping for a minute, only to think\nabout what will be tomorrow. How we are....how we can continue tomorrow. We left this\nhouse on the second of daylight. Then we find out that this uh...I mentioned earlier that\nuh this woman where we find each other before my husband was the business company\nand from my sister. The business was a a lady hat salon. One was in the same house, but\nanother another house after the corner. This was a modern uh shop with toilet and with\ntelephone and my husband decided that he will make his investigation what we can make\nduring that time and he will spend the night in this shop. The woman will close the shop\nand he will be inside and I thought OK and I am going to look after a flat like a refugee\nfrom Transylvania, like a family who was afraid from the Russian and I am a refugee,\nrefugee from Transylvania. I was without any papers. I went with the carriage and near,\nnear the carriages. My son Peter and I went from house to house. I went in to ask the\nconcierge can you find in this house a free room. I am a refugee from Transylvania. It\nwas...I was never afraid that I am suspicious like a Jews because I was very very uh\nAryan type and the two children was blonde Aryan type, like Hitler looking. And I went\nfrom house to house knowing this was no ____ house. The...what can you say that the...it\nis not right here in this house, not free uh free room to to let it, but here, there is a family,\na couple with a child and a very big family and the woman is a very good woman. She 1s\nworking in the Hungary in the Red Cross. It was not the best thing for me because the\nHungarian Red Cross was very anti-Semitic, but she's a very good woman and I am\nalmost sure that if you are asking personally she will give you temporary a room because\nthere is a lot of room. I went up and I was speaking with this woman and she was very\nkind. She give me in in the flat, there was a room with a bed, a big room, a big...very big\nrooms, these old fashioned houses. So I get their roof. This was maybe noontime,\nsomething like this. I was able a little bit to rest but I was not able, not to eat, not to think\nabout to eat something. I...even I can cannot remember what I gave for the children.\nSurely I gave something. Surely I put something in their carriage. It was in early evening\nwhen came back the husband from this woman. They invited us to the uh dinner and I\nwas not able not to eat. It was a little bit maybe suspicious that I am such uh stressed that\nI am not able to speak. I apologize that I have had from my things I hid all of it and II\nwas able to swallow a tea, and this was...and they were speaking that tomorrow you must\nuh go to the to the office where all the all the refugee people will gather identification\nand everything and I put a story that uh I left the same little town in Transylvania from\nfrom where my cousin where spent earlier, earlier what I was not and I told I am, I\nwas living in was the name from the little town and my husband 1s in the\nmilitary service but I don't know...several months I didn't get any message from him. I\ndon't know which place he's in and it came out, this was my story that uh accidentally\nthere that was a a truck, an auto with several people who was facing to Budapest, and\nthey told me well youcan ___ with us to Budapest. We have some place to to pick you\nup, and I decided to get to Budapest with this uh with this uh uh with this...not truck,\ntruck...and I arrived to Budapest and now I am looking for some friend from my husband\nwho is, who will will be able maybe to find me a place to live. This was my story to give\nto this person. And then it was early evening and we were were strolling a little bit in the\nin the big big flat and I don't know how it happened that uh my son came in alone.\nImmediately I have heard that terrible screaming and I ran what happened with my little\nson and a woman saved me. I wanted only to help him to make peepee. I saw that he\nwanted to make peepee and my son was screaming and I| thought oh thank you very\nmuch. Will you the help to the to wash, wash the children and I told thank you. I will\nmake alone. She wanted to see the children, mainly my son. Only she wanted to help me.\nShe wanted to to make a bath, and I thought thank you, I will make it alone. Thank you. I\nleft to her the little bit to Miriam. You understand what I was meaning, so they went to...I\nhad put the children to sleep and I went to the bed and I had a feeling this is not the place\nfor me. I...and this woman is suspicious. She's looking and and asking questions. This 1s\nnot s place to remain. And what what how can I make out every day. And I was under in\nthe bed during all the night, not a five minute to to able to sleep. This was the third night\nwithout to sleep. And I was thinking and thinking what to make, how to make...I must\nescape from this threat, because this is a threat for me. How can I escape not to make\nsuspicious that I am running out from a very good place, a very lovely person. The\nsecond day I was standing near the window. I was looking out. There was opposite\nanother house and I was thinking what to make out to make the woman ____ will you go\nto the office to to arrange your papers. I can help you. I will go with you. And I told\nthank you, very nice, thank you, but maybe I am waiting because now it's raining and and\nI must take the little baby's __a little later, and I was looking out. She was standing\nbehind me. This I don't ever forget, this voice...I was looking out and the opposite house\nwas people was moving and she told me now these people there, and I was\nasking which kind of people is living there. She told Jewish people. I was standing like\nlike I got my eyes in my in my heart and I was able to look. Why can't I...don't really here\nin Budapest still the Jewish people in our place there. Since the summer time is no more\nJewish, not one. I was able to speak...even today I get in my heart a...it was something\nterrible feeling and I told this woman...this was my luck, in those times that every one\nevery flat was a with telephone, and here was no telephone, and I told this woman that uh\nI am going down to look a public telephone. I must find this friend from my husband and\nmaybe that I can get a connection that he will arrange a place for me. And this was quite\na logical way to go out from the house and I took Peter with me and I left Miriam and I\nwent there. A corner I made and someplace a find a public telephone and I find my\nhusband in this in this shop, this salon and I told to my husband that I am not able to\nstand this situation. I must came...I must escape from this house. I am in a terrible\nsituation. You must come and play like you the friend from my husband and you are the\nperson to help me, that you have a place for us and took us away from this house because\nI am not able to stand this situation. I was not eating third day and I was not sleeping the\nthird day. Then when I finished this, I was coming out from the little shop where was this\npublic telephone and I didn't understand how this happened. I told my address to my\nhusband. I came out and I forget the address and I forget that which... what is the name\nfrom this family where I was living and I was standing with the carriage, maybe that I\nwas very wild and I get a panic, that I left my daughter and I don't know where, which\nhouse. I will never find my daughter. I forget the name. I forget the street, which number.\nWhere was this house and I I don't know...never ever I should not more in my lifetime I\nget such a panic. And I went in the middle of the street and I don't know how was my\nface, but one or two persons was coming to me...women...what happened, if you can...can\nwe help you with something. And I began to say I am a refugee from Transylvania, and I\nget aaa room the last uh night, but I have I have forgot the name, the address. Nobody\nwas able to help me and I thought OK, I will find...and they began to ask which way,\nwhich how how looks like this...and I thought that when I went in there was in the middle\nwas the staircase and something I thought and then I thought OK, I will find. I don't\nknow how long I was in this this panic, but I find the house, but I was in a terrible panic\nwhen I went up, and always with my with my son. My son was only near me. This was\nidentification what could be a catastrophe when somebody find out that he is Jewish. I\nwent in in the flat and I told to this woman that uh luckily I find this friend from my\nhusband and he thought that he will come to take us uh to a certain place. Thank you for\nyour hospitality. I'm very happy and thank you, and I went in the room and I began to\nspeak with my son, two and a half years old. And I told Peter , Poppa (ph) will\ncome but you must not make any sign. You cannot cry and you cannot speak. Please not\ncry, not speak. Excuse me. OK. We came back in our home...if you are, if you will not\nmake any sign. Poppa will be here but you will not men...you will not cry and will not\nsay any word. So my husband arrived. He was uh good-looking Christian person and I\nmade ___ this and this. I am happy to see you, and he told OK, I have heard about you\nand I have a place for you, a ticket, and took your children and they are going...I have a\nlittle flat for you, and we escaped from this house. Then on the street I told to my\nhusband that I am not interested in what will be tomorrow. Maybe that we will die.\ntomorrow. I must go home. This home was not the real home, but it was my\nfurniture, my...I thought to be with the best for the children, to go in my bed and to sleep\na night and what will be tomorrow, we will die. I don't know. We will see what will be\ntomorrow. And this was our our way back to this house. In the meantime the population,\nthere were people from the house not happened anything and we went to sleep and the\nnext day to go through in this drama...my husband, early morning he went out but earlier\nthere was a round-up. In the house two Nilos with a gun came in. Every man down to the\ncourtyard till sixty year old with some one day food. They are going to digging uh traps\nfor against tanks, __ in Budapest. My husband went and didn't went uh didn't go down.\nIt was...he was young. He was not in this age to be at home like a Jewish person. And I\nwent out and I went uh I told my husband cannot go, and the Nilos asked why. I told he's\nhe's very ill. What is his illness? I told I told he is mentally ill. They told OK, remain at\nhome. So later my husband went out and arranged with the Zionist organization\nthat beginning from this story and other story that uh they are making several children\nhome and my husband came back and told me and earlier whenever I have heard about\nZionist organization or something only I have heard that uh in the summer time that when\nwill go a group out from Hungary to Palestine through Romania, we are in this list. This\nwas the whole what I had heard earlier I forget about 1t. Then my husband came back and\nhe told that there will be a uh children home for is exist. We are...we get the permission\nto go in with the children and we can work there. And we went. And this was in the\n...1t was a very Jewish surrounding but it was out from the ghetto area, so we\nwent in. There was about forty-six uh children, almost the same number adult people like\nuh like workers is...they are working with the children and the first evening and I take\nsomething from myself and I take my typewriter because this was my like sin my\nhand. If I have heard about to work something, it was always in my mind connected with\nmy typewriter. If I am working, I am working with my typewriter because I was not able\nto make any other work, so I took my typewriter and it was sitting there in an office room\nlike half from this. Zionist people, my husband was uh knows several people from this...I,\nfirst time I have seen these people and uh there was some very peaceful uh discussion\nabout uh when we are taking in in this home the children, which way we will educate the\nchildren. Uh it was a quite a a leftist uh influence. I think it was absolute curious for me\nthat while \u2014_\u2014_\u2014s Zionist Jews, Jews...what is the difference. What can be different they\nleftist or...we will...1 was absolute out from these ____ and my husband was sitting there.\nHe was very tight-lipped, tight-lipped. He was not speaking one word. I have seen on the\nface that something he was not satisfied. Later I learned that this was not the thing what\nwas so interesting to speak about the education, how they are educating the children. So\nthe second day he disappeared and went out and after several hours he came back uh\nsome kind of carriage...carriage uh platform (ph), two wheel and somebody was\npersonally to to pushing this and uh and there was a lot of uh dry noodle from this war\nfactory and uh some some uh margarine, some very important cleaning things, again\nsupplies, games...several very practical things, and he put these in and it was a little bit\ninteresting for the leaders from this group that here is a person...he was not uh saying\nconvert, and he is making what is necessary to make, so to ask the leadership that I have\nright to buy these or to bring these in, so it was quite an effective uh beginning to work in\nthis in this chil...children home. So in a very short time my husband took in his hand to,\nhow to fill up with children these not to be very care...very careful how many children we\ncan give place or what or which kind of children over. With this, in this time outside from\nthis children home, becomes the the to take the Jewish people all in the all that people\ndidn't...certain area what will what will be the ghetto, but the ghetto was already opened.\nThe very old people must go in the in the ghetto. The people till uh sixty must go ina\ncertain place like a horse racing uh area. Women in another area and there was a ina\nblock out on the street. Uh children above sixteen must go with the with the adult people.\nBelow this remain in the house. A woman, women with uh with less than one years old\nbaby can remain with the baby in the Jewish house. So it uh produced a lot of children\nwithout parents in these yellow-starred houses. Their mother went in this way, the father\nthere and there was the concierge to be responsible that all these people went, left the\nhouse and not remained or hidden in the house. So that began to...that meant a lot of\nchildren from one, one and a half year till fifteen, fourteen, fifteen and on without\nwithout parents. This was the __ first to make this children's home, to bring in these\nchildren in a home and this action made by Otto Komo (ph). Have you heard about Otto\nKomo. He was the president of the Zionist uh Hungarian Zionist uh organization and he\nwas a leader who get the leadership to to save the children and the the how to say\numbrella was the uh International Red Cross to give a section and above this was the\nSwiss Embassy. From the Swiss Embassy the the help gave with their . Later we\nlearned that he was an absolute perfect savior during all the time, without any uh bit of\n_____ or or something, but this is another story. I cannot go...yeah...so my, our home\nbecame this children home. The two children was in a room...I don't...I I cannot\nremember exactly because my husband took in almost immediately his brother's wife\nwith two little children and my my sister-in-law, she told you can be occupied in the\noffice. I will occupied with the children, your children together with mine, and I was\noccupied in the office. I wanted immediately to make lists about the names. There was\nchildren and I told who knows who is these children. Must take out if somebody is in the\nage to tell the name is OK or an other from the neighbor knows that this is this younger\nchild, what is the name. I was such a person to make some organization, some order, and\nI began to make some lists who is the children, what is the name, which house they was\ncoming in. If somebody will ask or might be a person, if a person, not a , SO this\nbegan to be my occupation and my husband went mainly out and he goes...he went in the\nheadquarter from this International Red Cross organization, the children from the\nheadquarter was in the or _. This was a very famous uh headquarter for the\nZionist organization and this was the source later for the shutzpasses (ph) and the several\nplaces including uh uh storage where was where was food for the children homes and\neverything and my husband began began to work at on the outside. He was not able to sit\ndown. From place to place and to get frequent information to put that information to to\nlook always a little bit farther what to what to what is necessary to made, what and\nthis...he went to see other children home that there is the food and everything is going\nOK. He was not nominated for this, never. He made this because he has had a feeling that\nsomebody not make this the practically way, and uh so he become to be aa living,\nmoving connection between the several uh several uh I say houses...uh children home or\noffices and these children homes get permission to remain for a certain time outside from\nthe ghetto, and what Komo take is who was the person who was looking after the house,\nseveral houses, empty houses that is good for this for uh , enough place for to make\na contract with the owner to rent and this was Otto Komo's work and uh these homes was\nvery very short time full with children, and the these homes was very uh uh not uh not\ntogether, not in a certain uh part from the town. It was several very, very uh different\nplaces. Then we was living in this house and then began the shutzpass area. Can I take\na...",
        "Q: Please. Take your time. (Pause)",
        "A: Uh lot of uh men who was who was in the labor camp, they came out...there was two way\nto make a little bit easier the life. One way was to...uh these people was naturally without\nany uniform. Everybody was in the in the sport...something what they was able to to get\nand the sign was a yellow band that they are belonging uh belongs to a a labor group.\nThere was a some possibility...you know there was some uh like a like a secret telephone.\nWhen they somebody get some an information that something will occur is the way that\nthese went like a like a fire that...the information that if somebody will be combatted\n(ph), a Christian will not take will not go out from Hungary, will not go to Germany\nbecause this was the frightening this labor group will will be taken to Germany. Then a\nlot of big...it is is not uh not like depor...deportation. Like workers group to work in\nGermany, but not out from the Hungarian borders. That a lot of people was running to the\nnext church to be converted and to get a white band because there was the __ that these\ngroups with the white band, they will remain in Hungary, so it was a a mania to learn\nthe...uh I don't know how to say this, praying some very common praying uh in the\nCatholic uh way and to con...to be converted. And uh when somebody, the men get this\nuh this paper that he's converting Jews to Christian, then he get this white uh band. A lot\nof people made these without the without the holy water. Paid something and get the\npaper and immediately wasinthe _a little bit back uh uh but 1t was not so\nvery interesting, so then came out the new uh possibility that if somebody has a a\nshutzpass, what was a...how to say...a document that the certain person who has a a\npassport from a from a neutral country or a collective passport or something like this, that\nhe get a a document and this name became shutzpass. It is save saving passes, something\nto translate. The first shutzpass we have heard about from about Wallenberg, but this was\na very elegant, very very noble shutzpass. We had heard only that the Swede con...uh\nembassy 1s giving shutzpass for people who have relatives in Sweden or business\nconnection with Sweden, or who has had. Hungarian people was very far from Sweden,\nand it was very when we have heard that somebody is uh have a Swedish shutzpass.\nIt was like a like a letter for the lifetime. We was not thinking about to get uh near to\nSwedish because we hadn't had relatives, haven't had any connection with the...so the the\nSwiss Consulate begans to give shutzpasses for people who was under under uh...how to\nsay...uh on this list two thousand people who was uh taken in in in a group to go to\nPalestine. This this group never was able to left Hungary because uh in the\nmeantime...this was, I think the beginning was August or what July...1n the meantime\nRomania made the...came out from the Axis uh not made but it surren...surrendered and\nuh there was no more possibility to to to make a way through from Hungary through\nRomania to to the seashore to get a to send a quite a big group to Palestine. But there was\nthis list, and that was a collective passport, like a collective passport and this was the\nbasic to from the Swiss Consulate to give out shutzpasses. So we was between the first uh\ngroup to get the shutzpasses because we both , our name, our family was in this\nuh in this list. The headquarter to make this shutzpasses was 1n the . This was a\nhouse uh what uh created from the Swiss Consulate, because the Swiss\nEmb...the Swiss Embassy was not uh...1t was it was a very tumultuous work, very violent\nwork and it was much better to put in a quite separate house and this became the very\nfamous uh glass (ph) house, this uh . There was uh there uh began to work the\nleaders from the from the Zionist organization, several prominent uh Jewish person, later\nmore and more relatives and and they began to work and to give out this shutzpass. This\nwas working in in a certain way that these people who went to the to the horse horse\nracing place, or in other case the women, they was put in a brick (ph) factory. As long\nthey will be uh deport...deported.",
        "Q: Were you to be deported?",
        "A: Waiting for the deportation, not very enthusiastic waiting to go there. And that was\nseveral days that that was a possibility to find people, so at all apart from the family was\ngoing to the street, this glass house to get the the paper and went to the to this\nplace to show up this place piece of paper that this person is saved. He had uh he had a\nright to remain here, and this worked. When a person was still there, naturally it\nwas a possibility that he was sent for another place to work, to make against the tanks or\nsomething, so it was not hundred percent and this was not such an organization but was\nworking like a clock work. It was everything was accidentally, so the _ street began\nto give these shutzpass and several days later we was, we get a a certain amount of papers\nfrom this shutzpass that youinthe __ street, 1f you have somebody in danger, you can\nyou can make this uh shutzpasses for the names what when you know this 1s actually in\nthe danger whoever . We get these papers. It was nice to see and I began to make\nthe shutzpasses. We was asking the last childrens who was coming in in the house, who\nis your...who was taken out from your family, your father, your mother names. We made\nthe shutzpass and we send to the brick factory...",
        "Q: I just want to make something very clear. Were you working in the glass house to make\nshutzpasses...?",
        "A: No. No. No.",
        "Q: Where and how were you making the shutzpass?",
        "A: We get the paper from the glass house, and I was always sitting in the double...in this\nchildren home. There in the little office, there was a desk and there was my my uh\ntypewriter. We get...and we was very happy when we could get fifteen, twenty paper,\nshutzpass and we asked the children, name your father, your mother and to make the\nshutzpass and then we find out that this letter from my my typewriter 1s the same like in\nthe in the glass house, and we was so happy because __. We saw that it will be very\nimportant for the for the Nilos that this is the same source or another source, but\nwe was people grow up (ph) ..1t was still not uh going in that..we sand we can\nlive. It was a big happiness that the same letters, the same same style writer...we saw that\nthe real passport from the from the glass house. And I made these shutzpasses, ten,\ntwenty a day. Uh we find uh young, very intelligent intelligence uh boys that was able to\nrun on the street and to go to the brick uh factory and to ask and these people __.\nNobody knows how many times these was help or not help, because we was not looking\nafter the same person who was coming out from the brick factory, and when he was able\nto go to a Christian friend or some other way to disappear, it was very OK. It was\nnot...we get back only these people who was absolute helpless. Not a or these people who\nknows that my children is in this this home, in this very home. So it was not a control\nhow many times these shutzpass helped people or not helped. We get back several\nshutzpass when we get back that this name was not appear. Nobody appeared in these\nnames. Then we get back the shutzpass. Then we began to work a little bit with my uh\n\u2014__, uh to wri...to wri...",
        "Q: To erase?",
        "A: To write the name...",
        "Q: You're erasing the name? You're taking...you're changing the name?",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah. To use once more this paper. It was a very careful made work to take out\nwith a...with a to write out the name and to put another name, because it was very\nbig value this paper with the stamp from the Swiss Consulate.",
        "Q: OK. This is a good place to pause. We will breathe a minute...",
        "A: Very good. Very good.\nEnd of Tape # 2\nTape #3",
        "Q: We have begun. Will you tell me while, please, while you were typing the shutzpasses,\nwhat was your husband doing? Can you describe it and how you worked together?",
        "A: So I think in this time that I mentioned...we arrived the beginning November...uh my\nhusband was in all the time...I cannot remember that he was sitting in the office from the\nchildren home. He was in and out, in and out. Only the night he spent there and very little\nthere together in the same office, with eight other people. Uh in the same time, my\nhusband began began to work...how to say to work, to influence uh his uh business friend\nfrom the Spanish Consulate who was the the name Dr. Farkas Zolta (ph). I am saying\nHungarian way the name and he was the uh legion adviser in the Spanish Consulate.\nEarlier he was a business client to my husband but they they became so better connected\nlike only business. He bought uh brought from through my husband\u2019 office or something\nsomething from...it is not interesting...this was a a good business connection and he was\nuh for sure he was not an anti-Semite. But for sure he was not a Jew. And my\nhusband...this I didn't heard immediately. I learned this after when happened something\nthat my husband had kept a a idea that there is a neutral consulate, neutral consulate, the\nSpanish Consulate, maybe that they can help like the Swedish or like the Swiss\nConsulate. Naturally my husband began to to work to for our family and uh he asked\nsome paper that uh which kind of paper can (cough) get Dr. Farkash (ph) from the\nSpanish Consulate, what can...what we can use like uh a shutzpass or maybe more,\nmaybe a a passport. But this this uh Farkas _\u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014s was a very careful person. And uh a real\nbureaucrat because he was a lawyer. He was not uh thinking about swindle way what to\nmake. He wanted to make something uh what is a in in the frame of the of the law.\nSomething what is uh what is looks like logical and uh and uh some . But but the\nbeginning I hadn't heard about this. I was occupied in the children home. My husband\nwas occupied around the town, somewhere from morning till afternoon, late afternoon.\nWhat he's doing, which place he went I didn't know in those times. Lately I have heard\nabout the Spanish shutzpass, but this Spa...Spanish shutz...shutzpass, it was coming out in\na very certain way. People who was before the to uh to to be the dep...deported, when the\nfirst ttme when they get...this was the earlier in the and easier way to get a Swiss\nshutzpass...I must finish with the with the Swiss because this was uh...originally it was a\nhigher higher and it was possible for a higher number to give about thirty\n(ph) thousand people to give, and uh some how it began...it was the very very uh good\nstamped paper from the Swiss Consulate, but later several young saviors (ph) find out\nthat another place uh workshop can make the same thing, and to make a made a false uh\nstamp and to made more and more from this, from this shutzpass. This was a very short\ntime help from place to place. Maybe that later it was not interesting, but every half an\nhour, every minute was a was a question of life. The the Swedish...oh the Spanish began\nif I remember...that my husband began to...no...people was caming back from the or\nindividual escaped from the group to put in the brick factory or something...",
        "Q: I don't understand.",
        "A: There was groups to take from the Jewish houses, groups to to bring to to the brick\nfactory. Several people was able to escape from from the group, but it was naturally not a\nlot. Then...now I know the connection...(laughter)...I must make a little order in that...uh\nthere exist already for the for the uh Swede protegees was several houses where out, far\nout from the from the ghetto area, several houses. These houses in the protected area,\nprotected Jewish area...it was a quite a different section from the and there was on\nthe house that this is protected by the by the Swede by the Swedish Embassy. The same\nthing made made after this the Swiss to put the people who was bringing back and who\nwas not able to findin__a place to put in these houses, these protected houses, and\nthere was written this 1s uh the Swedish...this 1s protected by the Swiss Consulate. Later\nwhen more and more people was saved by the Swiss that day my husband and the leaders\nfrom this uh movement in the in the glass house, that we can make other houses like uh\nlike uh saved by the International Red Cross. This was a little bit crazy because Swede 1s\nuh Spain... is aa State of Inter...International Red Cross is not a state, but we was\nalways, we must uh we must think about this ____ with the time went we was connected\nmore and more primitive people from the Nilos. The prominent people was going slowly\nout from from Budapest, not uh not remain as long the Russian will will make something.\nSo it was, it work and then my husband began to work with with uh we we get shutzpass,\nour family. We get the passport, uh Spanish passport. That's mean that there was the law\nif somebody has a a passport from a neutral neutral uh country, he is out from the\ndeportation, from the danger from the deportation. It was nice to get this. But my\nhusband had testing more more possibility to use out after when he made for our family,\nfor the father and the mother...passport they didn't get...only shutzpass, the other part\nfrom the family. Then he has seen more possibility to use out these neutral consulate and\nand to involve in this in this...uh there was some connection between Komo Otto (ph) and\nthe Spanish consulate earlier, but it was uh nothing came out from this and my husband\nmade a a agreement with the Dr. Farkas that if you can influence the charge d'affaires that\nhe will be ready to give out shutzpasses, I will give you a piece of plot, and what a piece\nof plot uh uh what we, what was in our ownership to like a payment uh and he always\nwanted to buy this piece of...this was a little, very quite a valuable little plot. He wanted\nto buy this earlier uh Farkash but there wasn't reason for our way to sell this, but in this,\nin this ttme my husband told if you uh could be able to influence the Swedish Consulate\nto involve this, I will give you this this piece of uh piece of uh building place.",
        "Q: So so he...you were holding...",
        "A: Bribed.",
        "Q: Bribing. You were bribing Farkash with the building lot...",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. It is not it is not a bribing...it is to to make a little bit uh motivated in these\nthings, because uh people is uh was absolute not motivated why I am going to help Jews.\nTo to make a little bit uh and he was he was very very uh fond for this piece of land. It\nwas a gentlemen agreement, not by in ink and after...I don't know...several days,\nweeks...every week was a like a lifetime...he wanted to put down this uh in like a contract\nand we made this contract. I have in my documentation. It was a short contract that uh we\nare like selling this this piece of land for Dr. Farkash and he wanted a little\nbit...yeah...in those times it was uh forbidden to uh Jewish uh uh belongings to to sell,\nand it was impossible to write in the register book so it was uh more than a gentlemen\nagreement, but it was making like in a time when we was in a very strong need. He\nwanted another paper that when we change the situation, every situation we are spending\nin this uh contract, that we are we are ready immediately to to say that we will never\nreturn our worth or to say to leave is that we made this in 1n a such situation that this was\na life, a question of life and death, so there 1s another letter and they have this that we we\nsigned this that no way when change the the situation, we will take back this this, and this\nwas a value about in those time hundred thousand penge but was about eight years\nalready. It was a...but we was thinking about our life and not the not the belongings. And\nthis made the...motivated Farkash to go in and to make something. I must immediately\ntell you that nobody in that area was giving so much because he was in in his soul he was\ninvolved, maybe that he has forget the in the meantime the the sum or the value what he\nget. He was working like a person. He was looking that I am able to help, I am able to\nhelp and it worthwhile to help people and this I must tell you that it is not interesting that\nsomebody by the beginning was bribed or paid. The main thing what he made, and he\nmade the maximum, Farkash. The maximum.",
        "Q: Tell us exactly...",
        "A: So, they began to give uh shutzpass my husband, and other people...there was several\nJewish people uh sheltered in the in the Embassy. They began to make shutzpass with uh\nphotograph, almost the same text like the like the Swiss shutzpass, only it was more\ninteresting with the with the with the photos, that people is uh getting to get a Spanish\ncitizenship. The people...first we give the next uh family friends when he knows where is\nthis and we was not together. My husband make a a list uh the families from this house\nwhere where what we lived before we went in the children home near the near the\nheadquarter from the Nilos. There he get the whole list. I ] mentioned that every uh\nsigned...uh I become to be uh tired...uh every Jewish house with the with the yellow star,\nthere was a list from the name exactly who is there. My hus...my husband get from this\nhouse the com...complete list and he made for everybody a shutzpass and naturally not\nevery every shutzpass was with photo. Only when we find the people, when we find the\npeople then my my husband will give me the photo from the family. He went in the\nConsulate, made the the shutzpass, and gave back to these people. And nobody knows\nwhy. Nobody knows why they get these, because we was...first of all there was not the\n_____ was that people who is connected or people who have relatives in Spain, and this\nwas more uh far to connected with Spain from Buda...from Budapest like uh Sweden, not\na lot of relatives from Budapest was, Hungary, was in in Spain. So the people who get\nthis uh the Spanish uh uh shutzpass, it was quite an exclusive and and elegant shutzpass,\nmuch more respectable than the Swiss because from the the Swiss began to be very\nmuch, and the Nilos began to uh re...realize that uh it is too much and it cannot be and\ncannot be uh respectable and uh they began to turn these and go out when they made a\nroundup, not to accept the...not everywhere but they began to...these these uh tendencies,\n. With the most the more respectable was this the Wallenberg shutzpass, the\nSwedish, but beginning the most was the the Spanish, and that was a a argument what uh\nDr. Farkash used, may maybe some breathe that we are the the...someplace was very\nflexible and it was not a very difficult thing to to make an influence to help to the Jews.\nHe was very helpful. He was not a hard bureaucrat or far not an anti- anti-Semite. So the\nmost res..respectable was the Spanish, because there was an an argument that the Spanish\ngovernment, the only government he accepted the Nilos government. The very\nsimple people on the street didn't understand what is accepted and not accepted. This was\nsomething. Gives gives a . The low end was the Swiss uh Swiss uh\nshutzpass. The next was the Swede and the highest was the was the Spanish shutzpass. It\nwas not a big amount. It began to be more...yeah...it was a certain amount. Naturally\nwhen somebody was sheltered, Jews or even Christian there in the Embassy, and he had\nheard that I had a a neighbor or a friend from my neighbor or somebody use it a\nshutzpass, there was even, but never was uh there a line to to stand before the before the\nembassy like before...before the Swiss Embassy there was every day tumult, uh violent\npeople to go in and to ask and to get these uh shutzpass. Almost the same thing but less\nwas before the uh before the Swede Consulate. Here before the Spanish, there was never\na line because the people don't know what is what is the way to get this. They...if\nsomebody get it, it...they get, not asked. Mainly maybe that there was several people to\nask Farkash or some breathe or I don't know...maybe by luck or can you can you\nget me, can you get a shutzpass. It was always valu...valuable for for people who was\nwho was asking, but not from outside in a line and violent uh tumultuous uh scenes. This\nwent very very discreet. My husband, when he went out and to give for the for for the\npeople the shutzpass, never told that I am Szamosi or who I am. First of all because in the\n____ there's another uh other date because he was...I must here a little bit make order...he\nwas...my husband was in the background and and the key position was for Farkash\n. My husband asked something from Farkash __ and Farkash made this,\nmade the influence to get this from someplace. And this was such a shadow work. It went\nfor a certain time when it was a little bit more and more valuable this uh shutzpass and\nthey made Spanish houses for the for the protected uh people, and it was almost the same\narea...not always. It was it was far from the ghetto, but this was a certain area in Budapest\nuh in quiet a little circle, and this was became the name the protected ghetto. There was\nSwiss, uh Swedish and and uh and Spanish uh protected houses. People went in in these\nhouses. My husband wanted to work more effective and there was there was a lot of\nhandicap in the meantime that they already wanted to bring in the children home in the\nghetto. And to go in to the police uh headquarter to speak in the in this to to get another\nterm, to hold out the children from not to to put in in the ghetto. And so speak with these\npeople and my husband was without any identification, only that he is a worker to the\nInternational Red Cross. There was not written that these Jews or not Jews. It was aa\ncertificate. I get these two who who was working with the International Red Cross. It was\na little uh uh like a booklet, hard uh cover and quite __ inside with the with the picture\nthat this person is help, a worker in the International Red Cross. This was an old\nidentification but he hold but he had had a feeling that this 1s not very much. He can be\nchoosed with this be...like Komo Otto was a head worker for in the International Red\nCross and not and everybody knows that he is a Jew and uh he wanted to get some\nnomination from this uh Spanish Consulate that he is working in the frame from the\nSpanish Consulate. Uh this was not an easy thing but immediately my husband wanted to\nput in Otto Komo (ph) to this position, because he had had an imagination that Otto\nKomo in a very big danger. He said there's known Jews. He he was working always\nagainst the the the the wave to save the Jews, and he was a very prominent person and he\nwas Jewish and all his uh identification like a Jewish leader person. And my husband had\nhad an imagination that he, Komo Otto is in a very big danger. And he was speaking with\nKomo Otto that uh that come in in the Spanish Consulate. You will be in a safe place, in\na neutral in a in a neutral consulate. He wanted not to get these these uh personal uh\nexception or something, because he thought I am I am legal. I am sitting here in my\nposition legal, absolute legal. But it was...he was a little bit , Komo...Komo Otto.\nHe was a little bit uh look in the future that immediately it will be finished and then I can\ncontinue my work and to take the these orphan children and uh poor people to send to to\nPalestine and to make a a make a new home for the Jewish people, but in the meantime\nthere was...the front was closed but to close it was a matter or something,\nsomething like this. Nobody knows how long it is for, and my husband beg...began to\nworry the very very deeply for Komo Otto. Then Farkash often spoke with to to\nprepare these nomination for Szamosi and Komo Otto. Somebody started OK, I am ready\nbut what is there what 1s their rea...what is their basic. I must get a letter from ;\nfrom the International Red Cross, that he asked me to make this this nomination for these\ntwo person. It was not a simple uh thing to influence \u2014__ what was much harder,\na very...how to say, tough bureaucrat. There was...uh Komo Otto has a lot of fighting\nwith the with uh .Bytheenduh ____ was ready to give this letter, to send this\nletter to someplace, to the Spanish Consulate, and they get a letter I have in my my\ndocumentation that the Spanish Consulate nominated uh Szamosi__ and Komo Otto\nlike a a co-worker or officer in the in the frame in the Spanish consulate. It was very\nimportant for my husband because while...have you some question?",
        "Q: Explain what you mean by nominating him as an officer in ?",
        "A: (Cough) When here you don't know this when somebody was...an an inside worker in a\nin a neutral consulate. These people was uh accepted for for any uh inside. They was free\nto go on the street and and to arrange things. This I have forgetted that this this was a\nmadea____ to go in in several office uh police office or ministertum (ph) or something\nto speak in the in the interest for the Jewish people, so they get this uh\nidenti...identification. Komo was not ready to use this. Still he he saw that he will take uh\nseveral several rooms in the Ritz (ph) Hotel. This was not bombarded, that there will be\nthe... immediately after the war there will be the officers to organize the groups and so on\nand so on. And my husband everyday told me but hear this, these several days, what will\nhappen. So this was this was always an like a mania in in the mind for my husband and\nthis and this person is in danger, personally. So when they when they get this\nnomination...this was in mid-...I think after one day, two day the left Budapest.\nAnd this was a very nice day because there was . He get a breathe that I have no\nmore boss. I must look influential and ask and to and to make the whole the whole\nceremony to get something, almost and once more I am I must uh say that he was not a\nheavy person, ...helped, he was helpful. Uh but it was a very nice uh situation.\nWe are here. The Embassy is here. The stamps, the papers, everything is here what we\nwhat we need, and we...and we are free. We can make what we want without control. But\nuh Farkash \u2014_ was a law...a lawyer. A person he was not a partisan. He was\nresponsible to to make something in the Legion forum as it was OK we were free to\nmake, but if somebody will ask that where is the where is this charge d'affaires, then then\nwe cannot be uh Spanish, I the Hungarian Farkash or you the Hungarian Szamosi.\nAnd uh that was like I told I had heard...now I can hear my husband's voice. He told that\nFarkash happily told me that you know in our house there 1s an Italian. He will be good\nlike a like a Spanish. Who knows that he is Italian and not Spanish. The name is quite\ngood...Per...uh Perlasca. He will be the boss and so Perlasca became the boss. His was the\nnomination. This was...and now I must...if I am not going to wait to Perlasca because it 1s\nanother uh but uh when the first interview about...after the when he get in the\n, the writer's gentile and every honor...there was a big interview in the Jerusalem\nPost and I wrote this uh...I was very...at first I was laughing on this on the situation, but I\nbecame a little bit bitter but thisisa__ story and I did speak about this, that I was\nearlier too, so he told in this interview, Perlasca, that the first day I awake...I awake a\nnice day that uh somebody's left Budapest. The first day I didn't know what to make, but\nlater I came in like a fish in the water, so that means that the first day he didn't know\nwhat to make but it was not uh very much to make. My husband was very happy to get\nsomebody who give him a a to to help his uh appearance, and there remains the\ndiplomatic car from the Spanish Consulate. My husband was a chauffeur what in those\ntimes was not every day. Not every people was a chauffeur because in those time was\nvery few car and very few uh gentlemen chauffeur, but he was always work uh working\nwith the car and he was a chauffeur, and he was happily he took the car and put near by\nPerlasca and he went there every day too to look after uh children homes and what need\nand what and which paper, who needs some shutzpass, what is the name, uh where is this\npeople, and it was a big help with the car to make this and not on foot, but earlier he\nmade on almost every day by foot. And he put that Perlasca that too I have a big help\nbecause he was able when when that he went in in a police station that I am here with this\nSpanish uh charge d'affaires and he was able to speak, because earlier once he was uh uh\nmaking a very difficult uh agreement with a police, in a police station for a children home\nwhat was surrounded to put in in the in the uh ghetto...my husband was alone to speak\nwith this person that here I have a paper from a higher officer that this children home can\nremain in the place till 24 in December and this happened uh one week or ten days\nearlier, and this was a uh this uh uh argument between my husband and police uh chief\nthere, and this was the only uh day when the police chief asked who are you. And then he\ntake the paper from the Spanish Consulate that Iam an employee, employed in the\nSpanish Consulate, and to this appearance it was a big help that he was able immediately\nto say that I am here with the Spanish charge d'affaires in this thing to arrange to arrange\nto look after somebody who was disappeared from the house, maybe that he is here in\nthis police station or another. And he went every where in the in the children home and\nthe...and to look the the the protected houses for a certain time with Perlasca, but for a\ncertain time. Later Perlasca was not very much interested to to go out because the the\nwhole situation was more and more dangerous plus the bom..bombs because it was more\nand more closer the front and every day, almost every every hour was uh non-stop\nbom...bombs. So he was not uh...he left out slowly slowly from these these activity to see\nthe and to take uh food or something. It was not his work. My my husband knows where\nis the storage from the International Red Cross, where is the food. The food was mainly\nsome margarine, some mainly milk powder but was like stones what was necessary first\nto to make a powder from this, some uh uh very simple uh medicine and bread. The bread\nwas very important. Naturally it was not in a very hugh amount but uh they made a\nagreement with a bak...a bakery who was ready I think hundred or some amount of bread\nto make every every day for the International Red Cross for the uh what my husband\nparted with the Spanish uh uh protected people to...because these people wanted to get a\ngood paper when will change the regime that they was helpful for for the Jewish people.\nSo it was a...to to be protect, to be protected when the change will come, so there was\na...[ don't remember...I think in the but it is today not interesting that it\nin the memoir that where was the storage and and where and this uh bakery\nwhere where my husband was able uh to get some food. Later...this was the only\nbakery...uh to get some some bread and my husband took into Spanish consulate because\nthere was the storage for food not very very uh luxury food but to to survive but the bread\nwas an every day ration. So...yeah...",
        "Q: Let's pause a minute because I want to be...I know there's a disagreement about Perlasca\nand I just wanted to be clear. Uh you feel that your husband initiated everything and did\neverything and Perlasca was only along...",
        "A: He was a...he gave us support. He gave us support for my husband because he was sitting\nthere and he gaved for my husband appearance that some more and more and more stress\nthat I am here with somebody. Later he was not ready to came out then uh what was often\nbrought in in the house, not . Somebody was asked for for Farkash to to bring\nin in the Spanish Consulate in the building several gendarme. You know what is\ngendarme people? These was the most brutal police people from from the countryside.\nThese people was not working in Budapest, but the most most brutal persons. And uh it\nwas a little bit uh not uh comfortable for my husband and there was several Jewish uh\nJewish person but it...now I get the picture but that in the in the Consulate there was\nanother section for the Christian people. Refugees, Christian refugees like Perlasca,\nItalian and I don't know who others, but this was separated.",
        "Q: Did you know about this at the time?",
        "A: In those time I did not know about this, no.",
        "Q: We need, for this interview, we need to talk about only what you knew at the time. Not\nwhat...",
        "A: Sure. In those time I didn't know this. Only I I I know that that Farkash all time was\nalways very very careful what he is making not to make a big uh a big advertisement that\nwe are giving uh even after when somebody's left the house. He was always always very\ncareful not to make a big a big advertisement we are giving out shutzpasses. This was a\nvery secret, very very very uh bad action. I had heard from my husband about Perlasca\nwhen when they was very happy to...he was very happy that I have somebody to go out\nand then from the residents, from the every day residents, slowly slowly went out the\nname from Perlasca. It was not a...my husband began to be more more uh he get more uh\nmore...he get in more in this in his actions and he went alone. He was not alone.\nNever he was alone. He was putting in the car uh somebody to take from this place from\nanother place, or a Jewish person from the from the Embassy to bring to another to the\nwhere 1s...to the uh uh headquarter to the , or to give several lift to give for\nseveral people and when when uh Perlasca was not ready to co...to came out, then my\nhusband influenced these these uh man from this gendarme to sit near near by, near my\nhusband. This was a very picture that somebody is going with a gentile. This was\nnot . This went in this way, so my...one day my husband came home with a big\nbandage on the on the head that he went out from the...every every uh late evening, early\nafternoon, my husband came home limping...there is not connection. I with the children\nleft the children home in a certain time and sit in the middle of in the middle of\nNovember or late November because the tendency began to be that this there was the\npaper that all child...children home must be in the ghetto uh 24th December. Then it was\na tendency to make less people to remain in the children home, and uh my husband began\nto inform the people who is able to go in to this...well to find some hidden place...go out\nfrom this because this home is no more safe, no more than 24th December. They must put\nin in the ghetto. And a lot of people who was in the meantime...as I am speaking this\nstory...there was some periods about I I think this is written in the memoir because I\nneverImadeaa show many people, children is there. Hundreds and hundreds\nchildren and more adult people who jammed jammed out from the __ and ran back,\nescaped some individual way and was coming in the in this house to get one night shelter\nto or to find the children or to find the the woman or only to find a roof for a night. And\nmy husband began to say to these people it is not a safe place. If somebody has to have\nthe possibility to disappear, then when not with uh Christian paper then there then in the\nprotected ghetto with shutzpasses, uh Swiss or Spanish shutzpasses and only the\nvolunteer people can can remain here with the children who is mainly every woman who\nhas no place to go and not want to be in the pro...protected houses. This\nminimum people will remain here and we will see what will happen after 24th Nove...uh\nNovember and in the same time my husband finds some some somebody who finds for us\na empty flat in an earlier Jew's uh family and we became a...we became to live with this\nuh this second identification what my husband bought in the very beginning and I wanted\nnot to see that I will live with another name, another identification, but this was the time\nwhen this was the only way and we went in in a house in uh near to the to the Danube, a\nflat like a Nilos family, this Christian name and and we get this flat. We was living there\nfor a quite a short time. I don't know exactly the date...1t was Christmas. On Christmas\nDay. He 1s so much lying, so much happening in this very short time that almost I am not\nable...my husband always ask asked me to write down during the all life time I was not\nready to write all this, because I rather not to go in in my head and heart to to live\nthrough this period, and I am not a writer. I am only a typist, so this was 20 20th in\nDecember. In the in the meantime every...this headquarters for children children's\nhomes...the people began to be less and less because this was clear that this is not a\nsolution for the to be saved. All these children home and and headquarters and this must\nmust go in the ghetto and the ghetto will be closed. The ghetto is already crowded,\nterrible uh terrible situation. A lot of...very few uh uh food. To give, to help to to supply\nthese the ghetto was Komo Otto's work and several people who was helping for him and\nthe remains the the children children home only with the children. The little children\nbecause when somebody was fourteen, fifteen years old, these children was able to find\nsome hidden place alone, and this was an interesting period. My husband get a...I think I\nnever write on and I cannot remember which cloister (ph) was this that my husband went\nin and asked papers, Christian origin papers for girls, certificates, born certificate or\nparents uh uh marriage certificate to...some certificate to to make a person Christian. A\nborn certificate. My husband bring these...I can't remember...this was quite a lot of papers\nand he get these from a from a clo...cloister and began to ask uh younger woman who 1s\nabout this age, who can, who can use these. This was born in this age, some similarity\nsome similar age, and this paper was enough to go out and to to be to get a job like a\npostman was not working, postwoman was not working very much in this but the\ntram...tramway, tram, electric tram on the street...this was working and there was to sold\nthe tickets, the women work, and the the new the Nilos regime is very primitive. Woman\nbecame the first persons. There was no more more ready to work in this very simple\nwork. So that was job available, and these Jewish women went to be a conductor on the\ntram. Get a hat and a something what was absolute perfect the uh identification for a\nChristian person so this was a a this was a way to to lower the the the population in these\nvery crowded children home. This was a way the individuals disappearing was another\nway and the and the shutzpass, but already all these protected houses, it was full, full, full\nwith people but it was not a question that people can live under under staircase or\nsomeplace, only inside someplace. Ten person in a room. It was not interesting. It was\nsure that this is not for a long time, but it was sure that this is not a life-saving. It is only a\ntime _. Never I was able to use this that we saved, we saved lives. We helped to\nsurvive from day to day, because somebody went with the good shutzpass, went from one\nplace to another. It was very possible that a gang, a Nilos gang took this, these people and\ntook them to Nilos headquarter or another not very headquarter and to began....where are\nthe Jews, where are Jews and to make the torture and and to make the nice uh \u2014__ what\nwas the only occupation from the Nilos uh uh...I cannot say this was not an army...gangs.\nThis was the only...there was not very much toto _. Only to make the personal hate\nand and to laugh on the...the torture people all the night to hang on the trees and with a\npaper that this is the fate the hidden Jewish people, all people who was hidden Jewish\npeople when...and so and it was every day more and more terror, more and more brutal",
        "Q: Could you tell us what happened to you ?",
        "A: So then remains these that uh my my husband hold the the ...the contact between the\nEmbassy, between the safe houses to bring something, more and more shutzpasses,\nmore...a little food and this was the maximum what in this this situation was\nposs....possible to make. The front was very close. The fight was very intensive. On the\non the street. He he was able to to use the car till uh till a certain day when it is written\nalready that he was was uh get a bomb. Near him was sitting a gentile. In the in the car\nwas earlier a Jewish surgeon, physician. He took this physician for a 1n a first aid place to\nput down. That was another Jewish person. He...my husband wanted to put in another\nplace...I don't remember where...when I get a splinter for a bump. That was a time that\nthese two people was jumping out. The gendarme and this Jewish boy. I am sure that the\ngentlemen was not thought about that this is the Jews, and they was uh uh wounded. That\nwas quite...that was two gentile and one was died. That's not right. There was only one\nand nobody else died. My husband ...yeah....my leaved leaved the gendarme on the street\nbecause he would be and could be able get any any first aid or help because he was a\ngendarme, but he took these wounded Jewish boy, young person, returned to this first aid\nplace to get a a help because he was a Jewish and he was he was hitting 1n the hip. And\nuh my husband was wounded here in a place and the piece from the from the...1t was\nblood and and the auto. \u2014_\u2014smiwaass like a but the motor was still working and he told\nme the story when that he was able to to drive and he was holding his head out from the\ncar to see and the blood was running and there was smoke. It was like a film that and he\nwent to the went to this first aid place with this wounded boy and he get there the\nbandage and everything and he fainted there. And now another story connected with with\nKomo Otto.",
        "Q: OK. We need to pause. We have two minutes left on this tape. Uh it 1s very late. Uh I\nwant to ask you if you want to just...we can change tapes and go do a short, another half\nhour and finish up. Would you like to do that.",
        "A: I think so. Yes. Yeah.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "Q: OK. We're on. You and I were talking before about uh Perlasca. Could you tell me,\nexplain for the interview what we were talking about and how you feel about Perlasca\nand the roles of your husband?",
        "A: Yeah. So I have heard the the name Perlasca when I...I had heard the say we have a\ncharge d'affaires. An Italian. It was...I I think the only humorous part from all the history\nbecause there was not a lot of part to smile or...but this was this was a little bit like a\ncomedy, that an Italian can be can be a Spain. I had heard not much, not very much on\nthis in this time about Perlasca. Only my husband, I went with Perlasca, with Perlasca.\nThis was a like a safety belt for my husband. And naturally Perlasca went because he\ndidn't know what he was not speaking Hungarian, so later, several days...this is the\nwhole period this was quite short, short...[ haven't heard so much about Perlasca, but\nwhen after during the war, my husband wanted from me to write down in his memory,\nthen he he was always very over-joyed with this person in the right time that that was this\nItalian that he was able to use like a Spanish, like a a Spaniard, like a charge d'affaires. It\nwas a Short time, but every short time it was a question of life and and and dying. Later I\nhaven't heard and I today I know that the only person who write down and give gratitude\nPerlasca, my husband, in my husband's memory, because all the other things, it 1s all\ncreated, these...it 1s not not interesting. It 1s a ridiculous, pompous words and and but here\nis the fact, that my husband and Farkash was very very thankful for for the to find\nfor the fate to find a person who was playing this role, and other uh very important thing\nthat after when somebody's left their embassy, the the power went to the . He\nwas their legion adviser for the embassy, the only person to continue something only to\nto be responsible for the building and for everything. This was the Dr. Farkash\nthat...",
        "Q: While your husband was doing what he was doing, Perlasca was doing what he was\ndoing, and ...",
        "A: Perlasca made Perlasca made the in about all the Farkash was told we are making\nthese. We are making these. As long he was ready, but not till the end.",
        "Q: OK. Thank you. Now you had something you wanted to tell us about Otto Komo.",
        "A: In this uh this new beginning or...",
        "Q: In the new beginning, we are now where...at the end of December of '44, early January?",
        "A: Yeah. This is this is the very tragic time. Otto Komo prepared himself. He get a a help\nfrom the earlier early December, November from Switzerland because as I told I am very\nsorry but if I am against the history, but Frederick Bond (ph) was a very heavy person.\nAnd uh they asked from from Switzerland a help with more more uh flexible to help and\nto to take this this uh _ and they arrived in Budapest uh . He was a person...he\nwas he was occupied to be with Komo Otoo and to help to Komo Otto. He was a very\nhelpful per...person, and they made a good friendship, Komo Otto and . Almost\nevery every day they was together. But as the time went closer and closer to the end, my\nhusband was worried more and more for for Komo Otto and he prepared a place in the\nSpanish Embassy for Komo Otto, a nice, comparing nice office building, uh telephone,\neverything because all the building was empty. The people who was uh refuge refugee\nthere, Jews or Christian people was under shelter, because almost non-stop was the\nbomb, bombs. And my husband began to speak very serious with Komo Otto. Come in in\nthe Spanish Consulate. You can continue the same work. You can continue your your\nconnection. There is telephone and and come in because you are in danger in the Ritz\nHotel. It is more and more uh shining that he 1s living such a...he was not a pompous\nperson. He wanted to make in the Ritz Hotel an office for the for the...to send the people\nin after the war in uh in Palestine. And when, and he was always no...I am I am in secure\nhere. [have heres and I am in the in the spotlight from the Wallenberg, ,a\ngeneral come and other neutral uh Portuguese...I don't know the name from the\nPortuguese. He has had a feeling that he is OK. It is absolute legal in this place. Then my\nhusband began to speak the with the with the wife and to influence that bring in in the\nSpanish Consulate, so this was a very from my husband because he was looking\nat Komo Otto like a he take care of, he was. He was. He was able to go in the\nvery beginning with the personal group and leave Budapest and he chose to remain there,\nlike the Jews. Not a very few lived there, Jews lived there. Was able...not quite a few but\nI think no one was ready to make the choice that I I can leave Hungary and I remain\nbecause I have a a work to make this, so it was really in the like a romantic hero, and my\nhusband was very very fond for Komo Otto. So it went this influence as long as he was\nready. The 31st December that my husband will will go there and will bring Komo Otto\nand the wife in the Spanish Consulate with their belongings. This was the very day when\nmy husband earlier went to to make this tour to put this physician to the place and then\nget these bumps and he remains there uh uh un...unconscious, my husband, there in this\nfirst aid place. Several hours he was lying there and then he came back and____ was the\nmotor was still working and he was able to bring the car back to the Spanish consulate.\nHis uh head was full with blood, with a big bandage, and he bring back the auto and and\nthe very place the auto died. No more work. It was a miracle that it was able to bring\nback. I..and the next day my husband...yeah, my husband called from the from the\nembassy Komo Otto that this happened in the mean time. I was not able to bring you\nbecause this and this happened, but tomorrow morning I will find a car and I will go to\nbring, bring you in in the Spanish Consulate, and this was the OK. And this was the very\nevening, 31 uh 31 December evening when there in the hotel was standing Komo Otto\ntogether with the _ and the and the wife...came in two or three Nilos person and they\nwas speaking very polite that we wanted only several question to to ask from you and\nwould you be ready to come in, to come out from and he went out from and he\ndisappeared. He was kidnapped and how he was tortured it is no question and no fantasy\nto think about this. The second day that my husband called that I am ready to bring in\nthe...the woman told my husband he disappeared. And there was no way to...there was no\nway to ask questions. Naturally my husband asked Wallenberg to ask, to look\nsomewhere, someplace, some police station, some Nilos uh uh headquarters. No more.\nAnd this remains in in my husband's life like a a something he was never out from this\nthat he was able to help. He had seen that this that this person in in such a danger, and it\nhappened that he was not able to help. That what he made when he went to Israel. First of\nall, there was not any credit in his behalf on Komo's name. Nobody was interested.\nNobody knows about who was Komo, what, what happened. Most of Hungarian people\nwas not interested because a lot of Hungarian people there in Israel is from country or\nfrom from Transylvania.",
        "Q: Excuse me. I need to...we need to stay with what happened during the war. You need to\ntell us briefly what your husband did in Israel, and then we need to go back and finish.",
        "A: Sure. These these uh this was the most tragic day in our life, when my husband came\nback home even in our home and he told me Komo Otto disappeared, and then was the\nfeeling that every person, every minute, everywhere can disappear. It was not a question\nbefore. No more, no more leader. No more to ask somebody to help. The only person he\nmanaged to help it was Wallenberg, and no more other, because there was uh diplomatic\npersons who was not coming out like it is not a to mention Shalutz (ph). He was\nhelp everything but personally he was not going to to to making...to be uh in touch with\nthe Nilos people. He was not ready for this. . Even not .",
        "Q: You said Wallenberg helped. Uh tell us about Wallenberg.",
        "A: In those time I was not very in...1nformed what he is making, only I knowed and I have\nheard that Wallenberg was ready to go after the people, not only to give a paper and\ngoodbye, you are you are going away with this and help these people, paper .\nThen he was personally ready to to be touched with with the with the brutal uh uh low\nlower ranking people till the ministers and everybody, and to speak with with the whole\nuh possibility to the welfare for the for the Jewish people. He was the only person, he\nwas make he made this personally. Not by letter. Not by uh sign a a piece of paper\npersonally. This I have heard. And this was the uh example uh this was like a a...Miriam,\nhelp me.... (say it in Hungarian)....uh . (Example). Exactly. This was\nthe example how what other persons can can make like (cough) when there in\n...this 1s a other uh other section when when the death march went to\n...he sent his people on the way to help and they helped people. He went...I don't\nknow personally or even his people to at least that these people 1s saved by the\nSwede uh Embassy uh Con...uh Embassy and these people I I have right to to bring back.\nImmediately their the brain-trust in the Swiss Consulate began to make the same thing.\nThen it was and this was the example and to send the the the note and peoples and\npeoples to bring back people and in in the way to help or to bring some uh some people\nwhat is possible from the death march. The ___ was active immediately after is the\nSpanish Consulate. Then we can make a list for our person and my husband gave to to\nWallenberg when your pers...personal personally was somebody from from your help go,\nbring this with. This is another list, and these were these went 1n this way the work. It\nwas a little period when my husband was ready to go personally to , very risky for\na Jewish person, but it was everything was risky, even to live in Budapest was risky. But\nuh when came out that Wallenberg told my husband you remain here and when the\npeople came back, you can you can arrange from the wagon to to bring back some place.\nUh Wallenberg sent his person personnel to bring back the Swedish people but there was\nInternational Red Red Cross, then Swiss and Spanish. This was...this remains for my\nhusband, and my husband took the people when somebody was able to go on the foot it\nwas there was a very very terrible uh uh situation. These people after the death march and\nto back with uh with uh train naturally like a like a cattle...",
        "Q: Let's let's...I need...let's pause a little. Let's tell...bring it back to the end of the . We\nneed to know what happened to you and your husband as the war drew to a close. I need\nto know how the war ended for the two of you.",
        "A: Yeah. The war ended in in last several days, because it was like a . There was the\n15th of January in January, the Spanish Consulate uh 16th of Jan...January when...the last\nweek my husband went, my husband remains there in the in the Embassy. He was living\nthere because there was the front between us and it was impossible to go on the street and\nuh he remains there and I was with my children and in another place in the very middle\nofthe \u2014_, so my husband was uh...I must use this...the get the freedom uh 16th of\nJanuary and it didn't get 18th...two days later. It was not a pompous thing to uh...soldiers\nwas coming in in the house and look after...there was several auto on the courtyard. They\nwas looking and I was looking that the there was some very interesting hats, _ furs,\nand and I went down and I asked because uh my family was not never in the\nshelter. We was always in a flat. I wanted not to go in the shelter because my my\nson...and uh I went down. My sister was...my sister, my hus...my husband, two children\nand I, we was 1n a in a flat. And I went down and I was looking this person and he was\nvery and I am asking Hungarian \u2014 and he told, _. I didn't know what is,\nwhat is the meaning _. This was Hungarian _. I was not very very uh sure that this\nisreal___ and I'm asking Moscow and it was Siberia. Oh, I said. So long ways to go to\ngive our freedom from Siberia...this was real . | was very happy and he took out a\nbox uh a silver box with cigarettes...somewhere I get that, and he took a cigarette out and\nI was a smoker and I was looking the cigarette because I was since a long time without\ncigarette, and he give me a cigarette. I was taking one with my shaking hand and he took\nanother, andI was _, and I run out and I am shouting...here is the Russian. Here 1s\nthe...we are free. We are free. The day after...in this flat we was living together with two\nyoung persons. There was another room that was in uniform Nilos uh persons but to to\nmake short the story, this person was Jewish person with Nilos uniform. My husband find\nout almost immediately that this 1s Polish Nilos and I was fighting a little bit...it is\nimpossible so perfect a good uniform and so on and so on, so my my husband told be\nquiet. This person is with the Nilos and he was a little way uh friendly together but I get\nthis letter from my husband that this person must be Jewish, very elegant, Nilos but\nJewish, and I run up and I open the door and I am shouting at the boys...here is the, here\nis the Russian army. There was coming out immediately told me don't uh call me in this\nway because I am this...don't call me in this way...(laughter)...and my husband told me\nbefore we separated when something happened not to be the first to to say your real\nname. Maybe that the front is a little bit moving back one day. It is enough to kill people.\nI was standing there with my false name and I was not able to say that I am not this.\n(Laughter) And this was the first day.",
        "Q: Because of the time and the tape and it is late, can you just...it's a wonderful story. Can\nyou just tell me please how long you stayed in Hungary and when you went to Israel and\nthen when you came to the United States?",

        "Q: Yes. Keep going. Just",
        "A: When uh...I don't remember which time we get...you hear about Wallenberg disappear. I\nthink we saw that he went back to Sweden and uh we was not uh not thinking about that\nhe is something happened. The last uh time uh that was an agreement between\nWallenberg and my husband to say all this was uh less and less people between\nWallenberg, Komo and Szamosi...it was the people disappeared, voluntary or or\ndisappeared by their hands, from the Nilos. And they remains together and there was the\nvery last time uh Wallenberg and Szamosi was speaking about this and what will happen\nwhen the Russian army arrives our home, then they they was speaking about that about\nthe first thing will be that we are going to the headquarters, to the Russian headquarters\nand to ask help to help uh these people from the ghetto and and the children in the\nchildren home, very very terrible uh...and to ask to to to tell what we was making and to\nget some help from the Russian army. This was a very naive uh program. So Wallenberg\ndisappeared. It was not a...we didn't know immediately. There was no more telephone,\nand very very difficult connection. My husband continued to work with the children\nhome because there was one or two place where immediately when the Russian army\narrived here people was running out and left the children without any help.\nEverybody was thinking about myself, about to see my home, my family, to find my\nbelongings...and there was one or two home where the children any help. My\nhusband asked his uh uh brother who was a physician for children to come with me and\nanother person, an elderly woman...she was a secretary in my husband's place...to help to\ngive the children out and to put in some hospital or something. So he worked with the\nwith the Red...International Red Cross till I think end of August or beginning of\nSeptember, to help these people. We was living and began to live a new life after the war,\nbut my husband always wanted to immigrate but I was one sickness to the other,\noperation and everything, and so when the time till uh '49, and in '49 we left\nHungary...what was another miracle with all the belong...belongings and we went to\nIsrael.",

        "A: So I went uh to the school in a normal...what is an elementary school and to mention\nsomething uh I have had a very bad feeling there because in these years when I was six,\nseven years old, it was a big anti...anti-Semitism in Hungary. This was the\ncounter-revolution after uh after a short Communist revolution in Budapest in Hungary\nand it was like...as a little girl I have had always a feeling that I am not in raspberries\n(ph)...that I was a good student but I was always dessert (ph). First and the second must\nhave been...just a young girl and uh grade and everything was a big difference. I was a\nvery still, very frightened as a girl and it was interesting in our family that after the\nelementary school there four years, I asked my mother that I want to go in a private\nJewish school. This was uh it...this was a private school and my mother was very\nastonished why how I am getting in these uh in these \u2014_\u2014_s and I told her I I must go in\nthis school. I am not going farther to the to the normal school, and because I was a good\nstudent, student I get a a (cough) bonus from the from the fees what what was necessary\nto to pay there and in the first time when I was in this in surrounding, I became happy,\nvery 1n a good mood and a quite a different person, so I was at home, and I finished four\nyears in this school. THen I made a one and a half year uh course uh course...",
        "A: Yeah. And then I went back on to work, like a a young secretary and later I I was\nworking. I have had only two...first place I was one and a half years...like a telephone\n_____and five years in one place and ten years when I was in another uh job where I\nwhere I made everything for import/export firm. At the time I was getting a big prices\nand I was keeping the books and correspondence, yeah, and everything what was uh what\nwas necessary. This was still...see the last time before I became married.",
        "A: Lovely. (Laughter) ___ was a happy person because I have had the real feeling that it\nvery good to be to be young in Budapest. It was a very very nice uh...it 1s a very nice\ntown and I have had a very interesting uh company, mainly Jewish per...people but not\nonly. Uh my company...I get my company...after my two sisters, because I have had two\nsisters in the company and I was the little one and I went in in this the same company, so\nin general the boys, the company was about eight, nine, ten years older than I. They was\nmainly intellectual persons. They was uh they came back from several universities, from\nParis, Sorbonne, Rome, even Prague because there was such a anti...anti-Semitism in\nHungary that for Jewish people it was very difficult to get a a place or the possibility to\ngo in the university, so a lot of Jewish uh youths went out...mainly Paris, , even\nVienna, Paris, Rome, Prague, to learn, so I have had a very interesting and good\ncompany and it was really a wonderful life. The life, 1t was not necessary how much 1s\nthe money or how few is the money. Mainly if you (laughter) but there was not\ninteresting. It was not depend on the on the money the good life. That was a high cultured\nlife, music, museums, theater and only through strolling from Budapest it was a problem.\nIn the old part, Buda...old buildings and only to sit down near the near the _ and to\nlook the _ and the bridges. It was a wonderful life, and it was really...spent a very\njoyful youth there.",
        "A: We find each other... think it was...one moment...the very early autumn from '39. At\nthose time it was very fashionable for young people to make sport and a very popular\nsport was to rowing onthe _, on the Danube. And in this time...this was I think the first\nuh uh the first groups that the Jewish young people was called in called up to make uh\nlabor service, and there was a weekend when I was honest alone, without my company,\nand I decided I am going alone to rowing on the Danube and I and then I find a lady\nfriend and we went two together and there was a little uh not restaurant...a\nbuffet...accidentally and there we find each other...there my my later husband began to\nspeak to me. I was speaking to him. I was in the...I was sure that he must be Christian\nbecause I was sure that all the Jewish uh the Jewish young people is in the labor camp\nand he was out. I was sure that he was a Christian person. I was speaking very\nshortly...his was the first. Then it was a second rendezvous, as you say, and I wanted to\nbe very sure...I wanted to cut these connections because this was not the time to to make\na connection between a Jewish girl and a Christian boy. Even I told to my mother that I\nhave a rendezvous with a...I will make this very short...and we went sitting in a terrace\nnear the \u2014\u2014_\u2014_s and some way it came out that uh that there was some little group, Nilos\n(ph) group, that this was very beginning from the Nilos movement. They were shouting\nseveral slogans and I thought that I hate these people and Szamosi said I hate too. And it\nwas nothing to say because not every Christian person was like this uh Nilos movement\nand I wanted to make sure and I thought because I am Jewish and he was very uh stonish\n(ph) because I was very uh uptight, blonde and alive and he left, wanted to see every\nGerman in this and and he he told I am I am Jewish too. Then I was very (laughter)\nastonished, because I was sure that he is Christian and then even he told I am religious\nand I was very, very astonished that a young person who is going to export on the on the\nDanube...how can . Uh my company was uh better to say...how you say today\nleftist but there was several persons real communists, idealist communists in those time.\nThat was that was under... underground. That in Buda...in Hungary was not communist\nparty. It was forbidden. So I grew out uh up very lef...uh leftist company and I didn't have\nthe _ to be religious and I was asking how, why. Your father is very uh very strong.\nYou must go in the syna...and I don't know. I am going from my home, and it makes me\nvery furious and I didn't finish with this rendezvous. There was another rendezvous\n(laughter) and saw him out inthe the ___ next (laughter)...(pause)...we had a lot of the\ndiffer....different between us because I was as I told uh a leftist and I I was against any\nformal (ph) things and and uh he was more more...how to say this...middle class...you\nknow, these informal to to go to a five o'clock tea, something like this, and I was heard\nthese things so because going together about one and a half years and there was a lot of\ndiscussion between us, but this was like to to make a stone smoother (laughter) and by\nthe end we decided when we are making so nice discussion we can married and continue\nthis (laughter) and these wars (ph). Never boring.",
        "A: In uh '41, November.",
        "A: So it was quite a...for a short time it was...we was very happy young couple but it was a\nvery short time because in '41...1t was...was, it was more and more difficult to be free\nfrom the from the labor camp, and my husband was again this way because he\ndecided not to go in uh till '40...'41...'42...1t was not so difficult. A little perfection (ph)\nhere, a little money there...something...1t was...several...I was not involved in this. Only I\nknow that he is not at five to go like a cattle. He was a very indi...individual person. But\n'42...yeah...my son born '42...and uh in '42 began the...life began to be more serious and\nmore pressed and uh my my husband begun to make ___ the possibility through\nphysicians to get some false uh uh paper that he is ill in this illness or other illness, not to\ngo in in the labor camp, but it was always more and more difficult and and dangerous to\nplay this way, and he made some ___ operation like like uh abscess...he got some abscess\nand uh profits were made on the operation then he was was always able through me to\nfind a way to to pay somebody to help us and there was literally illness then I was able to\nspeak with this physician or professor to pay something, give a longer time for for this\nillness to__, but every second or third month he got there uh called up to the military\nservice so he find a way...I don't know somebody give this ID...yes...and get and get their\nID when he he can go in a in a mental hospital. Then the military uh military uh police\ncannot take out these people from there, and we paid for somebody a very big amount. It\nwas...I can't remember...ten thousand penge what made ten months , but you\nknow I will not find out that the professor who was the the head from his hospital, he was\nin this , but my husband went in in this uh uh mental hospital and to make a\nlittle shorter the story, he was able to spend there six months. That was a big, big time in\nin the very very dangerous time. I was every day there from forenoon till evening and\nwhat was quite difficult for me that the the physician...he was the respon...responsible for\nthis for this uh part from the hospital...he never asked my husband, yeah my husband\ndecided we didn't know what what this means to be mentally ill, because we'd never read,\nnever learned it was so imm...immediately and my husband thought I decide not to speak\nwith people. I will speak only with you. And and not with the physician and not others,\nbut I didn't know that this is good or not good, so almost every afternoon, evening when I\nwanted to left the hospital, the physician asked me what I have seen, what was the\nbehavior from my husband and almost day after day I was pressed to find out something\nbut give a picture that he is really not normal. He was living...he had he had a separate\nroom and he was speaking, everything, even playing a little cards, but this was not the\nway to to be mentally ill, so always I find out something that I wanted, that he was very\ndepressed and I thought to play a little cards would be...but he was confused and he didn't\nfind the the way how to play, and each time I have had the feeling I was always\n(laughter)...but I was forced to make always these everyday stories that my husband\nreally could be hold uh so with this way I think it finished. He got the papers that he 1s uh\nmentally ill. This was official. There was a a from the state or uh supervisor, a professor\nto make some questions and everything and temporary he he was uh put in...what 1s to to\nsay...I was the responsible for him, you you know this these...and because he had had\nseveraluh __ or real estate places, this was written in the register book that he is he is\nnot right to sign this uh contract or something I am responsible uh temporary, temporary.\nIt was not for another time when the when the professor or somebody will say that he is\nOK, he is healthy, so this was a very difficult time but on the other side it was very\ndifficult every day to go there and to play this play, but on the other side he was safe in\nthere. It was...and several times I have seen that was coming military police to look. He\nwas not alone in this in this mental hospitals. There was about...later we find out...always\nabout eight, ten, twelve Jewish young people but nobody knows that the other other is\nplaying. That was absolute disgrace and uh when I when I have seen from above that here\nis a guard from the military police, then I went down down there. There was a public\ntelephone like I want to speak to somebody and I was able always to speak with the\npeople, and I take out from the officers...and what is what is the name...who are you\nlooking for. I wanted to be prepared but it was quite good in this place and it was quite\ngood as long...my my husband came out I think in the...'43...'43 autumn. And it\nwas...yeah...yeah...yeah...then we leaved our quite private life in our flat, but very very\noften somebody...what is this...somebody's saying against against another\nperson...yeah...yeah...why he is at home, why he 1s not in the military...in the labor\nservice, and it was...we decided, my husband decided that we will take a a second flat, to\nrent a second flat uh place far from Budapest near near a famous lake that is a summer\nplace but it was autumn and we did take a villa there with with our little boy and uh later\nlived there only to visit there from Budapest that the people will forget. And uh not to\ndenounce. It was our place...yeah...till till December I think, uh end of December...we\nrented this for longer time but uh I was pregnant with Mariam (ph) and I get a very very\nheavy..uh I have had this, this was , and the pregnancy made me position that in\nevening I get a back that I was not able to to move, so the next day we we took a\nambulance, and we ran back to Budapest and we there in our flat. Our flat was\nin which is in Budapest like the Champs d'Elysee in Paris and in January Miriam\nborn. I was I was very ill before birth time. I was very ill after that time. I was not able to\nstand up and very very heavy uh pains, so I was in very ill till March, 19th March when\nwhen the army from Hitler arrived to Budapest and this took me up from the from the\nbed. (Pause - drinking) About this date I'm sure that you have heard a lot and my husband\nwas not working. He was an elected person. He was working with his father together, but\nuh before this time quite a...I think a year earlier or what it was taken the license for\nJewish people to to work in these area, so he was...we find a . You know what\nthis...uh uh Christian person and the it was...then he give the name for the firm, and my\nfather-in...father-in-law and my my husband was working in uh behind these these uh\nChristian men name so to make a life, but it was a quite a illegal way but a very common\nway in those time. It was a absolute common way. A lot of people was living in this uh\nliving with this possibility and this was a big possibility for the Christian people to get a\n____ not to work and to get goods already, so everybody was in this way quite happy, the\nChristian and the Jews, so I will continue. The next day to a week came the order to that\nJews must uh hold a yellow star but earlier there was a very terrible stress within the\nJewish people and aterrible __ the first time, prominent Jews and uh a lot lawyers and\nuh like hostages. They didn't know what will be the fate for for these people. These was\ncalled in immediately, mainly disappeared. This was I think the first uh transport of to\ndeported, and what was the Judenrat and you know, what is this uh....so every day a new\nguard order from the __ to this is forbidden and this is forbidden and how to how to\nbea...behave, how to live, and we when we arrive at this time to go out with the to wear\nthis yellow star. It was a terrible feeling, that people with a sign to go on the street. The\nfirst uh several days mainly women went went out, not to mention that very few younger\nun men was at home. It was...the younger age was in the labor service. That was already\ntaken and there were very respectable people and but the first, second day I went out. I\nhave had something to _ in the office and I decided that I am going out. It was like to\ngo ininacold water.| wasan__ and I was not uh...I was sure that I I will not\nincite...insult...1incite. This was a very risky, very that somebody is going out,\nsomebody can spot or insult oreven __, but I was sure that I am not that type and\nnever I was insulted in my life, and I went out. It was a terrible feeling that somebody\ncame against me, very respectable elderly person...like an aristocrat, with a yellow star,\nand to look each other, you you too. You too. And then please wait to go in the street. It\nwas something about the...1n our age, in our lib...liberated uh youth, after our liberated\nyouth, it was so almost impossible to understand that how can people be back in this way\nand to live in this way, but I made a self-suggestion that it is now my shame. It the\nshame, it is the shame who made this with me. It was a brainwash but I made for me. I\nhave a little uh story about in this office...interesting. I went in and there was a a\nautomatic elevator. It was a two...two person was going in and this went up five _. I\nwent in and nearby was a...well a gentlemen about uh forty, forty-five. He saw star...I\nwas with the star, and this was a little problem, and he was looking at me curious way\nand he was asking uh you must wear these or...and then the question was the the __ that\nI making uh the demonstration near the uh to be sympathetic for the Jewish people but\nnever happen in Budapest, but it was known that someplace, some somebody can make\nsome demonstration. This happened inin __ later. We learned this, so the question was\nthis that you must wear this or , and he was looking and and asked me, have\nhave somebody in your family I understand Christian and I never left to finish the\nquestion. And I told yes, Rabbi. He was astonished. And he was looking, he was not from\nBudapest. I I wanted to make a . [told yes, I am from Transylvania. I born in\nTransylvania...I told him a landlo...landlord family. I told no. A pub-owner family.\n(laugher) Then he was looking at me and I arrived __ and he told me if lif lam if I] am\nable to help you or something, my hand was the paper what I wanted to arrange there and\nI made so thank you. I will arrange alone. This was a sympathetic, but this was the first\nday. He wanted to help me someway. I don't know how. I was not a a dangerous type. I\nwas a very Aryan type so this was a quite a good feeling to hear this sympathy of words,\nbut I was very stressed, so this was the first uh uh experience to wear the yellow star on\nthe street. Then we get the proxies later...these was in this way...and our hands like this,\nhands back...give me something like the hand back. We went from the street. We uh uh\nwomen's hold hands back in this way, and to...not all the time to show the...so a part I\nthink I finished and this part from our life. Then came the order that that uh Jewish\npeople must go in several houses to live, every family in one room which is not\ninteresting how how many person...",
        "A: Yeah. A long, long monologue...so that was...several houses was fined. There was some\nwhich area, which houses will be yellow-starred signed houses. Naturally our our\nhome, it was not in this uh because it was a very unelegant place, a very representative\nstreet. They made this into...many of the back streets and mainly the most, most people\nwas Jews in the house. So not far from our house there was...the corner from our\nhouse...the corner was avery famous uhuh __ house, 60. This was a...\ncannot now remember that before the Nilos which part owned this house. Really I cannot\nnow envision, but this was a famous house. Nex...uh next from this house in the back\nstreet there was a house who in this list that this will be a yellow-stared signed house. I\nwas not...uh we was not running to look. We was a little bit para...paralyzed the first\ntime, but uh somebody was ringing and coming and yelling, so and he began to say that I\nhave flattened this house what will be signed for the Jews and I have heard the\nconceriege that here is a Jewish family maybe that we can change the flag. I was quite\napathetic in this because this was sure that this is not to live. It is only a temporary thing.\nWhat will happen with us if it is not the place where we were living, and I went this\nyoung person. I went in the house. He showed me which uh...attached there is two rooms\nand the kitchen and the maid's room and came out a person from the house, a young man,\ngood looking young man and he asked me uh madame, will you come in in this house\nand I thought I don't want to come in. I must come in. He thought come in...there was a\ngood place. I have here a war factory. Uh I am making uh I am making uh noodle and uh\nmacaroni for the military service. Here the door will always will be opened and I have a\ntelephone. And this was not for me. I was not interested in what is this flat. I come back\nand I told Lotzie (ph)...Lotzie is my husband...I find a place. The main thing there is a\nparticular person. He told me that the door will be always open and there is a telephone,\nand this was very very important and we decided to change the flat. We left this our flat\nwith a lot of belongings there and we take the the minimum bedroom and something that\nwas necessary to this flat and we made a friendship with this uh factory owner. He he\nimmediately take us in like a worker in this in this uh war factory. That was a...that gives\na big difference because...uh I cannot remember what was the order that Jewish people\nfrom the from the signed houses can go out between eleven or...till one...something like\nthis, for a short time to arrange something or buy something or was survival was to buy.\nBut the somebody had these these uh document that he is working in for the military,\nmilitary service. This gives a longer uh time to to to strolling outside in the street, and\nthis was very important. So it was quite a, quite a good life. It was written...I was I uh a\nperson always I was looking the good side. Now we are in one room. The other room is\ntook in uh my husband's uh brother, a physician with a wife and two little children and in\nthe maid's room there was a help for me. She was my cooks and she was looking always\nafter my children, uh a Jewish person, a Jewish woman, an elderly woman and there was\nliving eight, nine, nine or ten person in this two-room flat, but there was living. In uh\nduring this time I think it was May...for that and we got a lot of control. I am not a\nhistorian to to...and we had heard that the...in the...what happened in the countryside\neverywhere and what was the meaning ghetto. That I think there was together and what\nthe meaning deportation. Not exactly...only about. We didn't get any any detail how was\nthis deportation...really mainly I, I wasn't not to think about only the bad things. Always I\nI was looking what is deportation. To take the people another place to work. Maybe\nuncomfortable maybe but this is the maximum what uh what I was able to imagine. But\nwe have heard about the concentra...what what is happening on the country. In the\nmeantime I was not very interested with uh Zionist movement. I have heard sometimes\nfrom my husband that he is a Zionist. OK. It's his business, and he went always out from\nthe house...a lot of telephones and he hold his horse on connection, but I was not very\ninterested as long...he was....I think we had had a feeling during July...it was continued\nthis deportation from the country and we began to get the feeling that now is our turn\nbecause this deportation, this ghetto together...put together the people and put in because\nit came very very close to Budapest, till the suburbs. And it was a a feeling that\ntomorrow, after tomorrow our turn is coming. Then uh I think it may be August...we get\nsome some information that what is stopped uh_\u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014sw you know, ...uh stopped the\ndeportations. And he changed the government and will be another uh solution but uh\nwhat will happen with the Jewish population, so we get a little breathe, and uh to change\nthe government it really means a little more liberal and only to hear the the announced\nthat what is stopped, the deportation, so it was a little bit out from the immediately\ndanger, but I must tell you that I didn't shout that the deportation it is dead. I didn't run to\nunderstand. My husband began to speak about this, that you know these people is going\nto . And I told you are crazy. You are speaking something what is believable.\nWhy? When when people must hear...why not in the press, why not make these\norganization and to take children, old people, and my husband told yes, this 1s the sign\nand when the people is taken for the work, why the children, why the old people, why the\nthe ill people, why everybody? These people will bring the and I thought it is\nimpossible. Don't speak in this way. I wanted not to hear it this way, but...so\nwe get a little breathe, a little better feeling and even we began to very optimist,\nvery...that the war must be finished. I think that uh...as a matter of fact we have heard\nwhat is the situation on the on the front and it was far uh after Stalingrad and we knows\nthat the Russian is coming uh closer and closer to to Hungary and really I know I cannot\nuh mention what was the front situation, but it was a possibility to think that we had a\nlittle uh a little uh future, maybe that we will be the only person in Budapest, the only\nJews to survive this with our , without without to take to deport...to be to be\ndeported. That or dead. So it was a quite a good feeling till 16th of October. This was\na...Jf I can good remember a Sunday, a nice autumn Sunday. We went out, my husband\nand I, a little bit strolling on the on the Buda, to get a little fresh air. We uh carved out\nspot and this was a very nice forenoon only it was interesting to see that a lot of\nmilitary uh vehicles went out from Budapest, German military uh uh cars and trucks. The\ndirection was out from Budapest. We have seen this and it was very quiet in the in the\ntown and we came back to this yellow-starred house and something was in the air. It was\nnot announced anything, but everybody had had a feeling this 1s a strange interesting day.\nSomething will happen. In the same day so in the noontime uh not in the our,\nwith whom we changed the the flat, he came in and he told you know Mr. Szamosi when\nsomething will change, we will change back the flat. We had nothing again...uh against\neach other. You are you are agreed that I didn't made anything against you, and my\nhusband thought OK, OK, OK. It was so in the air even the Christian people had had a\nfeeling something good happened in the very very next future. After noon we have heard\nthe declara...uh declaration from ___ that he finished the the the partnership with uh\nwith the Germans. It was to hear it was something that we finished from our side,\nbut in the same time we was with each other, and my husband thought interesting\nthat they are making such a big change. Where is the Hungarian army? How can, how\ncan we change something for such a drastic way. We was coming through the \u2014__ on\nthe bridge what was always uh uh guarded from the Hungarian and from the German\narmy. There was always guards. When we came back there was no guards. There was no\nHungarian and no no German. It was very strange. It was just so...if somebody's thinking\nabout the the _, it must be something. We hadn't hadn't seen any Hungarian uh\nsoldiers during our our stroll, but it was a fantastic uh several minutes to hear this, but in\nour our heart it was not the feeling . We finished. After a...1t was...as we we had\nheard this declaration twice in the radio or three times. Then the radio began to give\nGerman march music, German. There was no Hungarian. It was German. Then after the\nmusic...always very, very military uh music...we had heard voices, a message for uh\nNilos uh leader people. There I will never forget the name that and there was a voice,\nplease come back. please come back. A very uh prominent Nilos. Then I\nhad un we understand that here happened something, what was in a good way but came\nout in the opposite way. And uh then in the same evening we have heard thatuh |\nthat the declaration for is void and the new govern...government 1s the Nilos\ngovernment. The leader is and several other very uh fraidful (ph) for names, anti-\nSemitic persons, Nilos leaders.\nEnd of Tape # 1\nTape #2",
        "A: No. No. Yeah. Fifteen October, yes. And and so this was the big change, all the house, all\nthe population from this house, all the people was on the, on the field. Nobody went to\nsleep. We was waiting what will happen with us. Mainly because our house was the very\nfirst house of the Nilos Nilos government take these sixty, this became the\nheadquarter and we was the very first house in the back street for this corner house, so we\nhad the feeling that when they are making something, then we are the first in that\narea...the yellow-star. Everybody was standing. We was...like a guard closed the the door\nfrom the house. We was looking out in the night, during the night. Even the people\npushed there, there was from this war factory, from this noodle factory a truck. They\npushed this the door, not because this was something that saved the house, only a feeling\nsomething to make. We have seen people on the street, groups, guarded with Nilos uh\npeople with a with a gun. I think it was...they went on the street with hand up, mainly\nmen in the direction to the corner house, this headquarter. Nobody knows why, which\nkind of people, Jewish people, so this was the first night. Nobody was sleeping and\nnobody knows what, what will be the next day. There was order that the...after the |\ndeclaration, a lot of houses...the people went to take down the sign. Naturally their first\norder was to put, to return the sign, the yellow...the yellow star was quite a big star, about\nalmost a meter big on the on the houses, and the cur...curfew... what is the...and the\nnaturally we...that that the Jewish people not allowed to go out from the houses.\nThere was every house there was a conceriege or somebody who was responsible. Every\nhouse was a list with a with a...tenants...how many people is there, who is there, and this\nwas the order that nobody can leave the houses. Uh my husband began to speak about\nleaving...we must run out from this house. This was not a question to go out, because the\nconceriege was sympathetic and that was this...a good friend is factory owner and he was\nable, every every time to open the door and to to make something. This was not a\nquestion of where. Where. And this was the first time that my husband took in his pocket\nour uh second identification what he bought...he bought in the very beginning when when\nthe German army came to to Hungary. He had had a imagination that uh he will be able\nto disappear when we are when we are taking other identification for the family like\nChristian people. When I have heard about this and he bought... cannot remember what\nwas the connection, how he bought this from a Christian family...uh the father and the\nmother about the same age like my husband and I with two children. Accidentally the\nname from the children was Peter and I think my daughter was Mariam... _. It was not\nvery far, about the same age and in those time my husband paid paid a nice sum from this\nbut I wanted what to took in my hand. It was something what normal person cannot\nimagine how I carried with that name and other identification and I thought I will not see\nthese. You must put this someplace. I cannot take inthe hand. IfI__ different name\nand they _ different person and this was the time when my husband took this false\nidentification and he put in his pocket and he told he must walk go out from this house.\nAnd I thought no where. I don't know where. I don't know where. There was Miriam. It\nwas October. She was nine years old...big, uh nine months old. Little baby, and my son\nwas two and a half years old, and I thought I don't know where...I I'm not able to go on\non the street. Where? Where? And he told very very strong, I am going and I will be and\nhe gave me an address, a Christian woman...she was my sister's business companion and\nuh my sister and my sisters was living in the same house before the...and he told I will be\nthere and there's where you...and he went out with uh with my son. I wanted not to go but\nhe was sure that when he is going out with my son I will blind go after him, not to think. I\nwas putting something in the carriage for the baby and something...I I cannot remember\nwhat, diapers...something what I put together and I went with this carriage after my my\nhusband and in this house in a very elegant area from Budapest in the\ndowntown, but the downtown was very elegant and I went in in this flat. The\nwoman was at home...a little flat, neat, very neat, a private flat, an older flat and the\nwoman was occupied to airing the fur coats and everything for the next winter and we\nwas, and I arrived there like in a trance. She was speaking...I don't know...she told\nme...this I remember...she told me you know that you cannot remain here because the\nconcereige knows you, and I said yes, I know. But only I want for a little bit to sit down\nand to think what to make. We went out from the house because there was no place and\nthere was really no place because the concerige was __. I was almost every day there\nin the in the better time when my sister was living there, so we went from the street,\nafternoon, late afternoon, little rain and what an idea what we are making during the\nnight uh during the night and slowly slowly it became dark. Then I find out thata\ngoes in from Transylvania. She married a Christian person and she came several months\nearlier, left Transylvania what was closer to the to the Russian Russian frontier and I\ndon't know how I was able to remember for this address, but I am going this 1s my only\nperson, half Christian...they they was living like Christian because her husband was\nChristian, and I thought this is the only address I can go in. Now I I cannot remember\nwhich direction, which place was this. I find with , and there was a sub-tenant in a\nflat. We went in. The lady from the...the owner from the flat let let us in, come in and I\ntold to my cousin that we had no other way. We must remain below some some roof\nbecause it is raining and dark and there was there was black-out and cur...curfew and uh\nshe was a very lovely person. She told OK. If you have a possibility, you must speak with\nthis lady from the from the flat, and I immediately find out this... went on in the corridor\nand I told that we are living...we are a family and we are living in Buda. I don't know that\nyou get information from Budapest that it is two part...Pest and the Danube and the other\npartis Budaand __ bridges ____ two part, and I told that we are living in Buda. We\nwas in the other part, in the part of Pest, and we wanted to go home but the, all the\nbridges 1s blocked with the with the Nilos soldiers and uh forbid for people to to cross the\nbridges. We are not able to go home. We must spend one night here in this side from\nBudapest. If it's not against this that we remain here in this uh....and she told OK. This\nroom was, I cannot say in feet...1t was five ___ meters. It is a maid...1t was for a maid.\nThere was one bed and maybe another place like one of the half bed. We made some\narrangements for the night. The two men was on the floor, lying on the floor. My cousin\nand I in the bed, and near our feet my two and a half year old boy, and Miriam in the\ncarriage for the for the night, so we spend the night there. To spend the night but not to\nsleep, and this was the second night that I was not sleeping for a minute, only to think\nabout what will be tomorrow. How we are....how we can continue tomorrow. We left this\nhouse on the second of daylight. Then we find out that this uh...I mentioned earlier that\nuh this woman where we find each other before my husband was the business company\nand from my sister. The business was a a lady hat salon. One was in the same house, but\nanother another house after the corner. This was a modern uh shop with toilet and with\ntelephone and my husband decided that he will make his investigation what we can make\nduring that time and he will spend the night in this shop. The woman will close the shop\nand he will be inside and I thought OK and I am going to look after a flat like a refugee\nfrom Transylvania, like a family who was afraid from the Russian and I am a refugee,\nrefugee from Transylvania. I was without any papers. I went with the carriage and near,\nnear the carriages. My son Peter and I went from house to house. I went in to ask the\nconcierge can you find in this house a free room. I am a refugee from Transylvania. It\nwas...I was never afraid that I am suspicious like a Jews because I was very very uh\nAryan type and the two children was blonde Aryan type, like Hitler looking. And I went\nfrom house to house knowing this was no ____ house. The...what can you say that the...it\nis not right here in this house, not free uh free room to to let it, but here, there is a family,\na couple with a child and a very big family and the woman is a very good woman. She 1s\nworking in the Hungary in the Red Cross. It was not the best thing for me because the\nHungarian Red Cross was very anti-Semitic, but she's a very good woman and I am\nalmost sure that if you are asking personally she will give you temporary a room because\nthere is a lot of room. I went up and I was speaking with this woman and she was very\nkind. She give me in in the flat, there was a room with a bed, a big room, a big...very big\nrooms, these old fashioned houses. So I get their roof. This was maybe noontime,\nsomething like this. I was able a little bit to rest but I was not able, not to eat, not to think\nabout to eat something. I...even I can cannot remember what I gave for the children.\nSurely I gave something. Surely I put something in their carriage. It was in early evening\nwhen came back the husband from this woman. They invited us to the uh dinner and I\nwas not able not to eat. It was a little bit maybe suspicious that I am such uh stressed that\nI am not able to speak. I apologize that I have had from my things I hid all of it and II\nwas able to swallow a tea, and this was...and they were speaking that tomorrow you must\nuh go to the to the office where all the all the refugee people will gather identification\nand everything and I put a story that uh I left the same little town in Transylvania from\nfrom where my cousin where spent earlier, earlier what I was not and I told I am, I\nwas living in was the name from the little town and my husband 1s in the\nmilitary service but I don't know...several months I didn't get any message from him. I\ndon't know which place he's in and it came out, this was my story that uh accidentally\nthere that was a a truck, an auto with several people who was facing to Budapest, and\nthey told me well youcan ___ with us to Budapest. We have some place to to pick you\nup, and I decided to get to Budapest with this uh with this uh uh with this...not truck,\ntruck...and I arrived to Budapest and now I am looking for some friend from my husband\nwho is, who will will be able maybe to find me a place to live. This was my story to give\nto this person. And then it was early evening and we were were strolling a little bit in the\nin the big big flat and I don't know how it happened that uh my son came in alone.\nImmediately I have heard that terrible screaming and I ran what happened with my little\nson and a woman saved me. I wanted only to help him to make peepee. I saw that he\nwanted to make peepee and my son was screaming and I| thought oh thank you very\nmuch. Will you the help to the to wash, wash the children and I told thank you. I will\nmake alone. She wanted to see the children, mainly my son. Only she wanted to help me.\nShe wanted to to make a bath, and I thought thank you, I will make it alone. Thank you. I\nleft to her the little bit to Miriam. You understand what I was meaning, so they went to...I\nhad put the children to sleep and I went to the bed and I had a feeling this is not the place\nfor me. I...and this woman is suspicious. She's looking and and asking questions. This 1s\nnot s place to remain. And what what how can I make out every day. And I was under in\nthe bed during all the night, not a five minute to to able to sleep. This was the third night\nwithout to sleep. And I was thinking and thinking what to make, how to make...I must\nescape from this threat, because this is a threat for me. How can I escape not to make\nsuspicious that I am running out from a very good place, a very lovely person. The\nsecond day I was standing near the window. I was looking out. There was opposite\nanother house and I was thinking what to make out to make the woman ____ will you go\nto the office to to arrange your papers. I can help you. I will go with you. And I told\nthank you, very nice, thank you, but maybe I am waiting because now it's raining and and\nI must take the little baby's __a little later, and I was looking out. She was standing\nbehind me. This I don't ever forget, this voice...I was looking out and the opposite house\nwas people was moving and she told me now these people there, and I was\nasking which kind of people is living there. She told Jewish people. I was standing like\nlike I got my eyes in my in my heart and I was able to look. Why can't I...don't really here\nin Budapest still the Jewish people in our place there. Since the summer time is no more\nJewish, not one. I was able to speak...even today I get in my heart a...it was something\nterrible feeling and I told this woman...this was my luck, in those times that every one\nevery flat was a with telephone, and here was no telephone, and I told this woman that uh\nI am going down to look a public telephone. I must find this friend from my husband and\nmaybe that I can get a connection that he will arrange a place for me. And this was quite\na logical way to go out from the house and I took Peter with me and I left Miriam and I\nwent there. A corner I made and someplace a find a public telephone and I find my\nhusband in this in this shop, this salon and I told to my husband that I am not able to\nstand this situation. I must came...I must escape from this house. I am in a terrible\nsituation. You must come and play like you the friend from my husband and you are the\nperson to help me, that you have a place for us and took us away from this house because\nI am not able to stand this situation. I was not eating third day and I was not sleeping the\nthird day. Then when I finished this, I was coming out from the little shop where was this\npublic telephone and I didn't understand how this happened. I told my address to my\nhusband. I came out and I forget the address and I forget that which... what is the name\nfrom this family where I was living and I was standing with the carriage, maybe that I\nwas very wild and I get a panic, that I left my daughter and I don't know where, which\nhouse. I will never find my daughter. I forget the name. I forget the street, which number.\nWhere was this house and I I don't know...never ever I should not more in my lifetime I\nget such a panic. And I went in the middle of the street and I don't know how was my\nface, but one or two persons was coming to me...women...what happened, if you can...can\nwe help you with something. And I began to say I am a refugee from Transylvania, and I\nget aaa room the last uh night, but I have I have forgot the name, the address. Nobody\nwas able to help me and I thought OK, I will find...and they began to ask which way,\nwhich how how looks like this...and I thought that when I went in there was in the middle\nwas the staircase and something I thought and then I thought OK, I will find. I don't\nknow how long I was in this this panic, but I find the house, but I was in a terrible panic\nwhen I went up, and always with my with my son. My son was only near me. This was\nidentification what could be a catastrophe when somebody find out that he is Jewish. I\nwent in in the flat and I told to this woman that uh luckily I find this friend from my\nhusband and he thought that he will come to take us uh to a certain place. Thank you for\nyour hospitality. I'm very happy and thank you, and I went in the room and I began to\nspeak with my son, two and a half years old. And I told Peter , Poppa (ph) will\ncome but you must not make any sign. You cannot cry and you cannot speak. Please not\ncry, not speak. Excuse me. OK. We came back in our home...if you are, if you will not\nmake any sign. Poppa will be here but you will not men...you will not cry and will not\nsay any word. So my husband arrived. He was uh good-looking Christian person and I\nmade ___ this and this. I am happy to see you, and he told OK, I have heard about you\nand I have a place for you, a ticket, and took your children and they are going...I have a\nlittle flat for you, and we escaped from this house. Then on the street I told to my\nhusband that I am not interested in what will be tomorrow. Maybe that we will die.\ntomorrow. I must go home. This home was not the real home, but it was my\nfurniture, my...I thought to be with the best for the children, to go in my bed and to sleep\na night and what will be tomorrow, we will die. I don't know. We will see what will be\ntomorrow. And this was our our way back to this house. In the meantime the population,\nthere were people from the house not happened anything and we went to sleep and the\nnext day to go through in this drama...my husband, early morning he went out but earlier\nthere was a round-up. In the house two Nilos with a gun came in. Every man down to the\ncourtyard till sixty year old with some one day food. They are going to digging uh traps\nfor against tanks, __ in Budapest. My husband went and didn't went uh didn't go down.\nIt was...he was young. He was not in this age to be at home like a Jewish person. And I\nwent out and I went uh I told my husband cannot go, and the Nilos asked why. I told he's\nhe's very ill. What is his illness? I told I told he is mentally ill. They told OK, remain at\nhome. So later my husband went out and arranged with the Zionist organization\nthat beginning from this story and other story that uh they are making several children\nhome and my husband came back and told me and earlier whenever I have heard about\nZionist organization or something only I have heard that uh in the summer time that when\nwill go a group out from Hungary to Palestine through Romania, we are in this list. This\nwas the whole what I had heard earlier I forget about 1t. Then my husband came back and\nhe told that there will be a uh children home for is exist. We are...we get the permission\nto go in with the children and we can work there. And we went. And this was in the\n...1t was a very Jewish surrounding but it was out from the ghetto area, so we\nwent in. There was about forty-six uh children, almost the same number adult people like\nuh like workers is...they are working with the children and the first evening and I take\nsomething from myself and I take my typewriter because this was my like sin my\nhand. If I have heard about to work something, it was always in my mind connected with\nmy typewriter. If I am working, I am working with my typewriter because I was not able\nto make any other work, so I took my typewriter and it was sitting there in an office room\nlike half from this. Zionist people, my husband was uh knows several people from this...I,\nfirst time I have seen these people and uh there was some very peaceful uh discussion\nabout uh when we are taking in in this home the children, which way we will educate the\nchildren. Uh it was a quite a a leftist uh influence. I think it was absolute curious for me\nthat while \u2014_\u2014_\u2014s Zionist Jews, Jews...what is the difference. What can be different they\nleftist or...we will...1 was absolute out from these ____ and my husband was sitting there.\nHe was very tight-lipped, tight-lipped. He was not speaking one word. I have seen on the\nface that something he was not satisfied. Later I learned that this was not the thing what\nwas so interesting to speak about the education, how they are educating the children. So\nthe second day he disappeared and went out and after several hours he came back uh\nsome kind of carriage...carriage uh platform (ph), two wheel and somebody was\npersonally to to pushing this and uh and there was a lot of uh dry noodle from this war\nfactory and uh some some uh margarine, some very important cleaning things, again\nsupplies, games...several very practical things, and he put these in and it was a little bit\ninteresting for the leaders from this group that here is a person...he was not uh saying\nconvert, and he is making what is necessary to make, so to ask the leadership that I have\nright to buy these or to bring these in, so it was quite an effective uh beginning to work in\nthis in this chil...children home. So in a very short time my husband took in his hand to,\nhow to fill up with children these not to be very care...very careful how many children we\ncan give place or what or which kind of children over. With this, in this time outside from\nthis children home, becomes the the to take the Jewish people all in the all that people\ndidn't...certain area what will what will be the ghetto, but the ghetto was already opened.\nThe very old people must go in the in the ghetto. The people till uh sixty must go ina\ncertain place like a horse racing uh area. Women in another area and there was a ina\nblock out on the street. Uh children above sixteen must go with the with the adult people.\nBelow this remain in the house. A woman, women with uh with less than one years old\nbaby can remain with the baby in the Jewish house. So it uh produced a lot of children\nwithout parents in these yellow-starred houses. Their mother went in this way, the father\nthere and there was the concierge to be responsible that all these people went, left the\nhouse and not remained or hidden in the house. So that began to...that meant a lot of\nchildren from one, one and a half year till fifteen, fourteen, fifteen and on without\nwithout parents. This was the __ first to make this children's home, to bring in these\nchildren in a home and this action made by Otto Komo (ph). Have you heard about Otto\nKomo. He was the president of the Zionist uh Hungarian Zionist uh organization and he\nwas a leader who get the leadership to to save the children and the the how to say\numbrella was the uh International Red Cross to give a section and above this was the\nSwiss Embassy. From the Swiss Embassy the the help gave with their . Later we\nlearned that he was an absolute perfect savior during all the time, without any uh bit of\n_____ or or something, but this is another story. I cannot go...yeah...so my, our home\nbecame this children home. The two children was in a room...I don't...I I cannot\nremember exactly because my husband took in almost immediately his brother's wife\nwith two little children and my my sister-in-law, she told you can be occupied in the\noffice. I will occupied with the children, your children together with mine, and I was\noccupied in the office. I wanted immediately to make lists about the names. There was\nchildren and I told who knows who is these children. Must take out if somebody is in the\nage to tell the name is OK or an other from the neighbor knows that this is this younger\nchild, what is the name. I was such a person to make some organization, some order, and\nI began to make some lists who is the children, what is the name, which house they was\ncoming in. If somebody will ask or might be a person, if a person, not a , SO this\nbegan to be my occupation and my husband went mainly out and he goes...he went in the\nheadquarter from this International Red Cross organization, the children from the\nheadquarter was in the or _. This was a very famous uh headquarter for the\nZionist organization and this was the source later for the shutzpasses (ph) and the several\nplaces including uh uh storage where was where was food for the children homes and\neverything and my husband began began to work at on the outside. He was not able to sit\ndown. From place to place and to get frequent information to put that information to to\nlook always a little bit farther what to what to what is necessary to made, what and\nthis...he went to see other children home that there is the food and everything is going\nOK. He was not nominated for this, never. He made this because he has had a feeling that\nsomebody not make this the practically way, and uh so he become to be aa living,\nmoving connection between the several uh several uh I say houses...uh children home or\noffices and these children homes get permission to remain for a certain time outside from\nthe ghetto, and what Komo take is who was the person who was looking after the house,\nseveral houses, empty houses that is good for this for uh , enough place for to make\na contract with the owner to rent and this was Otto Komo's work and uh these homes was\nvery very short time full with children, and the these homes was very uh uh not uh not\ntogether, not in a certain uh part from the town. It was several very, very uh different\nplaces. Then we was living in this house and then began the shutzpass area. Can I take\na...",
        "A: Uh lot of uh men who was who was in the labor camp, they came out...there was two way\nto make a little bit easier the life. One way was to...uh these people was naturally without\nany uniform. Everybody was in the in the sport...something what they was able to to get\nand the sign was a yellow band that they are belonging uh belongs to a a labor group.\nThere was a some possibility...you know there was some uh like a like a secret telephone.\nWhen they somebody get some an information that something will occur is the way that\nthese went like a like a fire that...the information that if somebody will be combatted\n(ph), a Christian will not take will not go out from Hungary, will not go to Germany\nbecause this was the frightening this labor group will will be taken to Germany. Then a\nlot of big...it is is not uh not like depor...deportation. Like workers group to work in\nGermany, but not out from the Hungarian borders. That a lot of people was running to the\nnext church to be converted and to get a white band because there was the __ that these\ngroups with the white band, they will remain in Hungary, so it was a a mania to learn\nthe...uh I don't know how to say this, praying some very common praying uh in the\nCatholic uh way and to con...to be converted. And uh when somebody, the men get this\nuh this paper that he's converting Jews to Christian, then he get this white uh band. A lot\nof people made these without the without the holy water. Paid something and get the\npaper and immediately wasinthe _a little bit back uh uh but 1t was not so\nvery interesting, so then came out the new uh possibility that if somebody has a a\nshutzpass, what was a...how to say...a document that the certain person who has a a\npassport from a from a neutral country or a collective passport or something like this, that\nhe get a a document and this name became shutzpass. It is save saving passes, something\nto translate. The first shutzpass we have heard about from about Wallenberg, but this was\na very elegant, very very noble shutzpass. We had heard only that the Swede con...uh\nembassy 1s giving shutzpass for people who have relatives in Sweden or business\nconnection with Sweden, or who has had. Hungarian people was very far from Sweden,\nand it was very when we have heard that somebody is uh have a Swedish shutzpass.\nIt was like a like a letter for the lifetime. We was not thinking about to get uh near to\nSwedish because we hadn't had relatives, haven't had any connection with the...so the the\nSwiss Consulate begans to give shutzpasses for people who was under under uh...how to\nsay...uh on this list two thousand people who was uh taken in in in a group to go to\nPalestine. This this group never was able to left Hungary because uh in the\nmeantime...this was, I think the beginning was August or what July...1n the meantime\nRomania made the...came out from the Axis uh not made but it surren...surrendered and\nuh there was no more possibility to to to make a way through from Hungary through\nRomania to to the seashore to get a to send a quite a big group to Palestine. But there was\nthis list, and that was a collective passport, like a collective passport and this was the\nbasic to from the Swiss Consulate to give out shutzpasses. So we was between the first uh\ngroup to get the shutzpasses because we both , our name, our family was in this\nuh in this list. The headquarter to make this shutzpasses was 1n the . This was a\nhouse uh what uh created from the Swiss Consulate, because the Swiss\nEmb...the Swiss Embassy was not uh...1t was it was a very tumultuous work, very violent\nwork and it was much better to put in a quite separate house and this became the very\nfamous uh glass (ph) house, this uh . There was uh there uh began to work the\nleaders from the from the Zionist organization, several prominent uh Jewish person, later\nmore and more relatives and and they began to work and to give out this shutzpass. This\nwas working in in a certain way that these people who went to the to the horse horse\nracing place, or in other case the women, they was put in a brick (ph) factory. As long\nthey will be uh deport...deported.",
        "A: Waiting for the deportation, not very enthusiastic waiting to go there. And that was\nseveral days that that was a possibility to find people, so at all apart from the family was\ngoing to the street, this glass house to get the the paper and went to the to this\nplace to show up this place piece of paper that this person is saved. He had uh he had a\nright to remain here, and this worked. When a person was still there, naturally it\nwas a possibility that he was sent for another place to work, to make against the tanks or\nsomething, so it was not hundred percent and this was not such an organization but was\nworking like a clock work. It was everything was accidentally, so the _ street began\nto give these shutzpass and several days later we was, we get a a certain amount of papers\nfrom this shutzpass that youinthe __ street, 1f you have somebody in danger, you can\nyou can make this uh shutzpasses for the names what when you know this 1s actually in\nthe danger whoever . We get these papers. It was nice to see and I began to make\nthe shutzpasses. We was asking the last childrens who was coming in in the house, who\nis your...who was taken out from your family, your father, your mother names.

We get...and we was very happy when we could get fifteen, twenty paper,\nshutzpass and we asked the children, name your father, your mother and to make the\nshutzpass and then we find out that this letter from my my typewriter 1s the same like in\nthe in the glass house, and we was so happy because __. We saw that it will be very\nimportant for the for the Nilos that this is the same source or another source, but\nwe was people grow up (ph) ..1t was still not uh going in that..we sand we can\nlive. It was a big happiness that the same letters, the same same style writer...we saw that\nthe real passport from the from the glass house. And I made these shutzpasses, ten,\ntwenty a day. Uh we find uh young, very intelligent intelligence uh boys that was able to\nrun on the street and to go to the brick uh factory and to ask and these people __.\nNobody knows how many times these was help or not help, because we was not looking\nafter the same person who was coming out from the brick factory, and when he was able\nto go to a Christian friend or some other way to disappear, it was very OK.

So it was not a control\nhow many times these shutzpass helped people or not helped. We get back several\nshutzpass when we get back that this name was not appear. Nobody appeared in these\nnames. Then we get back the shutzpass. Then we began to work a little bit with my uh\n\u2014__, uh to wri...to wri...",
        "A: To write the name...",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah. To use once more this paper. It was a very careful made work to take out\nwith a...with a to write out the name and to put another name, because it was very\nbig value this paper with the stamp from the Swiss Consulate.",
        "A: Very good. Very good.\nEnd of Tape # 2\nTape #3",
        "A: So I think in this time that I mentioned...we arrived the beginning November...uh my\nhusband was in all the time...I cannot remember that he was sitting in the office from the\nchildren home. He was in and out, in and out. Only the night he spent there and very little\nthere together in the same office, with eight other people. Uh in the same time, my\nhusband began began to work...how to say to work, to influence uh his uh business friend\nfrom the Spanish Consulate who was the the name Dr. Farkas Zolta (ph). I am saying\nHungarian way the name and he was the uh legion adviser in the Spanish Consulate.\nEarlier he was a business client to my husband but they they became so better connected\nlike only business. He bought uh brought from through my husband\u2019 office or something\nsomething from...it is not interesting...this was a a good business connection and he was\nuh for sure he was not an anti-Semite. But for sure he was not a Jew. And my\nhusband...this I didn't heard immediately. I learned this after when happened something\nthat my husband had kept a a idea that there is a neutral consulate, neutral consulate, the\nSpanish Consulate, maybe that they can help like the Swedish or like the Swiss\nConsulate. Naturally my husband began to to work to for our family and uh he asked\nsome paper that uh which kind of paper can (cough) get Dr. Farkash (ph) from the\nSpanish Consulate, what can...what we can use like uh a shutzpass or maybe more,\nmaybe a a passport. But this this uh Farkas _\u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014s was a very careful person. And uh a real\nbureaucrat because he was a lawyer. He was not uh thinking about swindle way what to\nmake. He wanted to make something uh what is a in in the frame of the of the law.\nSomething what is uh what is looks like logical and uh and uh some . But but the\nbeginning I hadn't heard about this. I was occupied in the children home. My husband\nwas occupied around the town, somewhere from morning till afternoon, late afternoon.\nWhat he's doing, which place he went I didn't know in those times. Lately I have heard\nabout the Spanish shutzpass, but this Spa...Spanish shutz...shutzpass, it was coming out in\na very certain way. People who was before the to uh to to be the dep...deported, when the\nfirst ttme when they get...this was the earlier in the and easier way to get a Swiss\nshutzpass...I must finish with the with the Swiss because this was uh...originally it was a\nhigher higher and it was possible for a higher number to give about thirty\n(ph) thousand people to give, and uh some how it began...it was the very very uh good\nstamped paper from the Swiss Consulate, but later several young saviors (ph) find out\nthat another place uh workshop can make the same thing, and to make a made a false uh\nstamp and to made more and more from this, from this shutzpass. This was a very short\ntime help from place to place. Maybe that later it was not interesting, but every half an\nhour, every minute was a was a question of life. The the Swedish...oh the Spanish began\nif I remember...that my husband began to...no...people was caming back from the or\nindividual escaped from the group to put in the brick factory or something...",
        "A: There was groups to take from the Jewish houses, groups to to bring to to the brick\nfactory. Several people was able to escape from from the group, but it was naturally not a\nlot. Then...now I know the connection...(laughter)...I must make a little order in that...uh\nthere exist already for the for the uh Swede protegees was several houses where out, far\nout from the from the ghetto area, several houses. These houses in the protected area,\nprotected Jewish area...it was a quite a different section from the and there was on\nthe house that this is protected by the by the Swede by the Swedish Embassy. The same\nthing made made after this the Swiss to put the people who was bringing back and who\nwas not able to findin__a place to put in these houses, these protected houses, and\nthere was written this 1s uh the Swedish...this 1s protected by the Swiss Consulate. Later\nwhen more and more people was saved by the Swiss that day my husband and the leaders\nfrom this uh movement in the in the glass house, that we can make other houses like uh\nlike uh saved by the International Red Cross. This was a little bit crazy because Swede 1s\nuh Spain... is aa State of Inter...International Red Cross is not a state, but we was\nalways, we must uh we must think about this ____ with the time went we was connected\nmore and more primitive people from the Nilos. The prominent people was going slowly\nout from from Budapest, not uh not remain as long the Russian will will make something.\nSo it was, it work and then my husband began to work with with uh we we get shutzpass,\nour family. We get the passport, uh Spanish passport. That's mean that there was the law\nif somebody has a a passport from a neutral neutral uh country, he is out from the\ndeportation, from the danger from the deportation. It was nice to get this. But my\nhusband had testing more more possibility to use out after when he made for our family,\nfor the father and the mother...passport they didn't get...only shutzpass, the other part\nfrom the family. Then he has seen more possibility to use out these neutral consulate and\nand to involve in this in this...uh there was some connection between Komo Otto (ph) and\nthe Spanish consulate earlier, but it was uh nothing came out from this and my husband\nmade a a agreement with the Dr. Farkas that if you can influence the charge d'affaires that\nhe will be ready to give out shutzpasses, I will give you a piece of plot, and what a piece\nof plot uh uh what we, what was in our ownership to like a payment uh and he always\nwanted to buy this piece of...this was a little, very quite a valuable little plot. He wanted\nto buy this earlier uh Farkash but there wasn't reason for our way to sell this, but in this,\nin this ttme my husband told if you uh could be able to influence the Swedish Consulate\nto involve this, I will give you this this piece of uh piece of uh building place.",
        "A: Bribed.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. It is not it is not a bribing...it is to to make a little bit uh motivated in these\nthings, because uh people is uh was absolute not motivated why I am going to help Jews.\nTo to make a little bit uh and he was he was very very uh fond for this piece of land. It\nwas a gentlemen agreement, not by in ink and after...I don't know...several days,\nweeks...every week was a like a lifetime...he wanted to put down this uh in like a contract\nand we made this contract. I have in my documentation. It was a short contract that uh we\nare like selling this this piece of land for Dr. Farkash and he wanted a little\nbit...yeah...in those times it was uh forbidden to uh Jewish uh uh belongings to to sell,\nand it was impossible to write in the register book so it was uh more than a gentlemen\nagreement, but it was making like in a time when we was in a very strong need. He\nwanted another paper that when we change the situation, every situation we are spending\nin this uh contract, that we are we are ready immediately to to say that we will never\nreturn our worth or to say to leave is that we made this in 1n a such situation that this was\na life, a question of life and death, so there 1s another letter and they have this that we we\nsigned this that no way when change the the situation, we will take back this this, and this\nwas a value about in those time hundred thousand penge but was about eight years\nalready. It was a...but we was thinking about our life and not the not the belongings. And\nthis made the...motivated Farkash to go in and to make something. I must immediately\ntell you that nobody in that area was giving so much because he was in in his soul he was\ninvolved, maybe that he has forget the in the meantime the the sum or the value what he\nget. He was working like a person. He was looking that I am able to help, I am able to\nhelp and it worthwhile to help people and this I must tell you that it is not interesting that\nsomebody by the beginning was bribed or paid. The main thing what he made, and he\nmade the maximum, Farkash. The maximum.",
        "A: So, they began to give uh shutzpass my husband, and other people...there was several\nJewish people uh sheltered in the in the Embassy. They began to make shutzpass with uh\nphotograph, almost the same text like the like the Swiss shutzpass, only it was more\ninteresting with the with the with the photos, that people is uh getting to get a Spanish\ncitizenship. The people...first we give the next uh family friends when he knows where is\nthis and we was not together. My husband make a a list uh the families from this house\nwhere where what we lived before we went in the children home near the near the\nheadquarter from the Nilos. There he get the whole list. I ] mentioned that every uh\nsigned...uh I become to be uh tired...uh every Jewish house with the with the yellow star,\nthere was a list from the name exactly who is there. My hus...my husband get from this\nhouse the com...complete list and he made for everybody a shutzpass and naturally not\nevery every shutzpass was with photo. Only when we find the people, when we find the\npeople then my my husband will give me the photo from the family. He went in the\nConsulate, made the the shutzpass, and gave back to these people. And nobody knows\nwhy. Nobody knows why they get these, because we was...first of all there was not the\n_____ was that people who is connected or people who have relatives in Spain, and this\nwas more uh far to connected with Spain from Buda...from Budapest like uh Sweden, not\na lot of relatives from Budapest was, Hungary, was in in Spain. So the people who get\nthis uh the Spanish uh uh shutzpass, it was quite an exclusive and and elegant shutzpass,\nmuch more respectable than the Swiss because from the the Swiss began to be very\nmuch, and the Nilos began to uh re...realize that uh it is too much and it cannot be and\ncannot be uh respectable and uh they began to turn these and go out when they made a\nroundup, not to accept the...not everywhere but they began to...these these uh tendencies,\n. With the most the more respectable was this the Wallenberg shutzpass, the\nSwedish, but beginning the most was the the Spanish, and that was a a argument what uh\nDr. Farkash used, may maybe some breathe that we are the the...someplace was very\nflexible and it was not a very difficult thing to to make an influence to help to the Jews.\nHe was very helpful. He was not a hard bureaucrat or far not an anti- anti-Semite. So the\nmost res..respectable was the Spanish, because there was an an argument that the Spanish\ngovernment, the only government he accepted the Nilos government. The very\nsimple people on the street didn't understand what is accepted and not accepted. This was\nsomething. Gives gives a . The low end was the Swiss uh Swiss uh\nshutzpass. The next was the Swede and the highest was the was the Spanish shutzpass. It\nwas not a big amount. It began to be more...yeah...it was a certain amount. Naturally\nwhen somebody was sheltered, Jews or even Christian there in the Embassy, and he had\nheard that I had a a neighbor or a friend from my neighbor or somebody use it a\nshutzpass, there was even, but never was uh there a line to to stand before the before the\nembassy like before...before the Swiss Embassy there was every day tumult, uh violent\npeople to go in and to ask and to get these uh shutzpass. Almost the same thing but less\nwas before the uh before the Swede Consulate. Here before the Spanish, there was never\na line because the people don't know what is what is the way to get this. They...if\nsomebody get it, it...they get, not asked. Mainly maybe that there was several people to\nask Farkash or some breathe or I don't know...maybe by luck or can you can you\nget me, can you get a shutzpass. It was always valu...valuable for for people who was\nwho was asking, but not from outside in a line and violent uh tumultuous uh scenes. This\nwent very very discreet. My husband, when he went out and to give for the for for the\npeople the shutzpass, never told that I am Szamosi or who I am. First of all because in the\n____ there's another uh other date because he was...I must here a little bit make order...he\nwas...my husband was in the background and and the key position was for Farkash\n. My husband asked something from Farkash __ and Farkash made this,\nmade the influence to get this from someplace. And this was such a shadow work. It went\nfor a certain time when it was a little bit more and more valuable this uh shutzpass and\nthey made Spanish houses for the for the protected uh people, and it was almost the same\narea...not always. It was it was far from the ghetto, but this was a certain area in Budapest\nuh in quiet a little circle, and this was became the name the protected ghetto. There was\nSwiss, uh Swedish and and uh and Spanish uh protected houses. People went in in these\nhouses. My husband wanted to work more effective and there was there was a lot of\nhandicap in the meantime that they already wanted to bring in the children home in the\nghetto. And to go in to the police uh headquarter to speak in the in this to to get another\nterm, to hold out the children from not to to put in in the ghetto. And so speak with these\npeople and my husband was without any identification, only that he is a worker to the\nInternational Red Cross. There was not written that these Jews or not Jews. It was aa\ncertificate. I get these two who who was working with the International Red Cross. It was\na little uh uh like a booklet, hard uh cover and quite __ inside with the with the picture\nthat this person is help, a worker in the International Red Cross. This was an old\nidentification but he hold but he had had a feeling that this 1s not very much. He can be\nchoosed with this be...like Komo Otto was a head worker for in the International Red\nCross and not and everybody knows that he is a Jew and uh he wanted to get some\nnomination from this uh Spanish Consulate that he is working in the frame from the\nSpanish Consulate. Uh this was not an easy thing but immediately my husband wanted to\nput in Otto Komo (ph) to this position, because he had had an imagination that Otto\nKomo in a very big danger. He said there's known Jews. He he was working always\nagainst the the the the wave to save the Jews, and he was a very prominent person and he\nwas Jewish and all his uh identification like a Jewish leader person. And my husband had\nhad an imagination that he, Komo Otto is in a very big danger. And he was speaking with\nKomo Otto that uh that come in in the Spanish Consulate. You will be in a safe place, in\na neutral in a in a neutral consulate. He wanted not to get these these uh personal uh\nexception or something, because he thought I am I am legal. I am sitting here in my\nposition legal, absolute legal. But it was...he was a little bit , Komo...Komo Otto.\nHe was a little bit uh look in the future that immediately it will be finished and then I can\ncontinue my work and to take the these orphan children and uh poor people to send to to\nPalestine and to make a a make a new home for the Jewish people, but in the meantime\nthere was...the front was closed but to close it was a matter or something,\nsomething like this. Nobody knows how long it is for, and my husband beg...began to\nworry the very very deeply for Komo Otto. Then Farkash often spoke with to to\nprepare these nomination for Szamosi and Komo Otto. Somebody started OK, I am ready\nbut what is there what 1s their rea...what is their basic. I must get a letter from ;\nfrom the International Red Cross, that he asked me to make this this nomination for these\ntwo person. It was not a simple uh thing to influence \u2014__ what was much harder,\na very...how to say, tough bureaucrat. There was...uh Komo Otto has a lot of fighting\nwith the with uh .Bytheenduh ____ was ready to give this letter, to send this\nletter to someplace, to the Spanish Consulate, and they get a letter I have in my my\ndocumentation that the Spanish Consulate nominated uh Szamosi__ and Komo Otto\nlike a a co-worker or officer in the in the frame in the Spanish consulate. It was very\nimportant for my husband because while...have you some question?",
        "A: (Cough) When here you don't know this when somebody was...an an inside worker in a\nin a neutral consulate. These people was uh accepted for for any uh inside. They was free\nto go on the street and and to arrange things. This I have forgetted that this this was a\nmadea____ to go in in several office uh police office or ministertum (ph) or something\nto speak in the in the interest for the Jewish people, so they get this uh\nidenti...identification. Komo was not ready to use this. Still he he saw that he will take uh\nseveral several rooms in the Ritz (ph) Hotel. This was not bombarded, that there will be\nthe... immediately after the war there will be the officers to organize the groups and so on\nand so on. And my husband everyday told me but hear this, these several days, what will\nhappen. So this was this was always an like a mania in in the mind for my husband and\nthis and this person is in danger, personally. So when they when they get this\nnomination...this was in mid-...I think after one day, two day the left Budapest.\nAnd this was a very nice day because there was . He get a breathe that I have no\nmore boss. I must look influential and ask and to and to make the whole the whole\nceremony to get something, almost and once more I am I must uh say that he was not a\nheavy person, ...helped, he was helpful. Uh but it was a very nice uh situation.\nWe are here. The Embassy is here. The stamps, the papers, everything is here what we\nwhat we need, and we...and we are free. We can make what we want without control. But\nuh Farkash \u2014_ was a law...a lawyer. A person he was not a partisan. He was\nresponsible to to make something in the Legion forum as it was OK we were free to\nmake, but if somebody will ask that where is the where is this charge d'affaires, then then\nwe cannot be uh Spanish, I the Hungarian Farkash or you the Hungarian Szamosi.\nAnd uh that was like I told I had heard...now I can hear my husband's voice. He told that\nFarkash happily told me that you know in our house there 1s an Italian. He will be good\nlike a like a Spanish. Who knows that he is Italian and not Spanish. The name is quite\ngood...Per...uh Perlasca. He will be the boss and so Perlasca became the boss. His was the\nnomination. This was...and now I must...if I am not going to wait to Perlasca because it 1s\nanother uh but uh when the first interview about...after the when he get in the\n, the writer's gentile and every honor...there was a big interview in the Jerusalem\nPost and I wrote this uh...I was very...at first I was laughing on this on the situation, but I\nbecame a little bit bitter but thisisa__ story and I did speak about this, that I was\nearlier too, so he told in this interview, Perlasca, that the first day I awake...I awake a\nnice day that uh somebody's left Budapest. The first day I didn't know what to make, but\nlater I came in like a fish in the water, so that means that the first day he didn't know\nwhat to make but it was not uh very much to make. My husband was very happy to get\nsomebody who give him a a to to help his uh appearance, and there remains the\ndiplomatic car from the Spanish Consulate. My husband was a chauffeur what in those\ntimes was not every day. Not every people was a chauffeur because in those time was\nvery few car and very few uh gentlemen chauffeur, but he was always work uh working\nwith the car and he was a chauffeur, and he was happily he took the car and put near by\nPerlasca and he went there every day too to look after uh children homes and what need\nand what and which paper, who needs some shutzpass, what is the name, uh where is this\npeople, and it was a big help with the car to make this and not on foot, but earlier he\nmade on almost every day by foot. And he put that Perlasca that too I have a big help\nbecause he was able when when that he went in in a police station that I am here with this\nSpanish uh charge d'affaires and he was able to speak, because earlier once he was uh uh\nmaking a very difficult uh agreement with a police, in a police station for a children home\nwhat was surrounded to put in in the in the uh ghetto...my husband was alone to speak\nwith this person that here I have a paper from a higher officer that this children home can\nremain in the place till 24 in December and this happened uh one week or ten days\nearlier, and this was a uh this uh uh argument between my husband and police uh chief\nthere, and this was the only uh day when the police chief asked who are you. And then he\ntake the paper from the Spanish Consulate that Iam an employee, employed in the\nSpanish Consulate, and to this appearance it was a big help that he was able immediately\nto say that I am here with the Spanish charge d'affaires in this thing to arrange to arrange\nto look after somebody who was disappeared from the house, maybe that he is here in\nthis police station or another. And he went every where in the in the children home and\nthe...and to look the the the protected houses for a certain time with Perlasca, but for a\ncertain time. Later Perlasca was not very much interested to to go out because the the\nwhole situation was more and more dangerous plus the bom..bombs because it was more\nand more closer the front and every day, almost every every hour was uh non-stop\nbom...bombs. So he was not uh...he left out slowly slowly from these these activity to see\nthe and to take uh food or something. It was not his work. My my husband knows where\nis the storage from the International Red Cross, where is the food. The food was mainly\nsome margarine, some mainly milk powder but was like stones what was necessary first\nto to make a powder from this, some uh uh very simple uh medicine and bread. The bread\nwas very important. Naturally it was not in a very hugh amount but uh they made a\nagreement with a bak...a bakery who was ready I think hundred or some amount of bread\nto make every every day for the International Red Cross for the uh what my husband\nparted with the Spanish uh uh protected people to...because these people wanted to get a\ngood paper when will change the regime that they was helpful for for the Jewish people.\nSo it was a...to to be protect, to be protected when the change will come, so there was\na...[ don't remember...I think in the but it is today not interesting that it\nin the memoir that where was the storage and and where and this uh bakery\nwhere where my husband was able uh to get some food. Later...this was the only\nbakery...uh to get some some bread and my husband took into Spanish consulate because\nthere was the storage for food not very very uh luxury food but to to survive but the bread\nwas an every day ration. So...yeah...",
        "A: He was a...he gave us support. He gave us support for my husband because he was sitting\nthere and he gaved for my husband appearance that some more and more and more stress\nthat I am here with somebody. Later he was not ready to came out then uh what was often\nbrought in in the house, not . Somebody was asked for for Farkash to to bring\nin in the Spanish Consulate in the building several gendarme. You know what is\ngendarme people? These was the most brutal police people from from the countryside.\nThese people was not working in Budapest, but the most most brutal persons. And uh it\nwas a little bit uh not uh comfortable for my husband and there was several Jewish uh\nJewish person but it...now I get the picture but that in the in the Consulate there was\nanother section for the Christian people. Refugees, Christian refugees like Perlasca,\nItalian and I don't know who others, but this was separated.",
        "A: In those time I did not know about this, no.",
        "A: Sure. In those time I didn't know this. Only I I I know that that Farkash all time was\nalways very very careful what he is making not to make a big uh a big advertisement that\nwe are giving uh even after when somebody's left the house. He was always always very\ncareful not to make a big a big advertisement we are giving out shutzpasses. This was a\nvery secret, very very very uh bad action. I had heard from my husband about Perlasca\nwhen when they was very happy to...he was very happy that I have somebody to go out\nand then from the residents, from the every day residents, slowly slowly went out the\nname from Perlasca. It was not a...my husband began to be more more uh he get more uh\nmore...he get in more in this in his actions and he went alone. He was not alone.\nNever he was alone. He was putting in the car uh somebody to take from this place from\nanother place, or a Jewish person from the from the Embassy to bring to another to the\nwhere 1s...to the uh uh headquarter to the , or to give several lift to give for\nseveral people and when when uh Perlasca was not ready to co...to came out, then my\nhusband influenced these these uh man from this gendarme to sit near near by, near my\nhusband. This was a very picture that somebody is going with a gentile. This was\nnot . This went in this way, so my...one day my husband came home with a big\nbandage on the on the head that he went out from the...every every uh late evening, early\nafternoon, my husband came home limping...there is not connection. I with the children\nleft the children home in a certain time and sit in the middle of in the middle of\nNovember or late November because the tendency began to be that this there was the\npaper that all child...children home must be in the ghetto uh 24th December. Then it was\na tendency to make less people to remain in the children home, and uh my husband began\nto inform the people who is able to go in to this...well to find some hidden place...go out\nfrom this because this home is no more safe, no more than 24th December. They must put\nin in the ghetto. And a lot of people who was in the meantime...as I am speaking this\nstory...there was some periods about I I think this is written in the memoir because I\nneverImadeaa show many people, children is there. Hundreds and hundreds\nchildren and more adult people who jammed jammed out from the __ and ran back,\nescaped some individual way and was coming in the in this house to get one night shelter\nto or to find the children or to find the the woman or only to find a roof for a night. And\nmy husband began to say to these people it is not a safe place. If somebody has to have\nthe possibility to disappear, then when not with uh Christian paper then there then in the\nprotected ghetto with shutzpasses, uh Swiss or Spanish shutzpasses and only the\nvolunteer people can can remain here with the children who is mainly every woman who\nhas no place to go and not want to be in the pro...protected houses. This\nminimum people will remain here and we will see what will happen after 24th Nove...uh\nNovember and in the same time my husband finds some some somebody who finds for us\na empty flat in an earlier Jew's uh family and we became a...we became to live with this\nuh this second identification what my husband bought in the very beginning and I wanted\nnot to see that I will live with another name, another identification, but this was the time\nwhen this was the only way and we went in in a house in uh near to the to the Danube, a\nflat like a Nilos family, this Christian name and and we get this flat. We was living there\nfor a quite a short time. I don't know exactly the date...1t was Christmas. On Christmas\nDay. He 1s so much lying, so much happening in this very short time that almost I am not\nable...my husband always ask asked me to write down during the all life time I was not\nready to write all this, because I rather not to go in in my head and heart to to live\nthrough this period, and I am not a writer. I am only a typist, so this was 20 20th in\nDecember. In the in the meantime every...this headquarters for children children's\nhomes...the people began to be less and less because this was clear that this is not a\nsolution for the to be saved. All these children home and and headquarters and this must\nmust go in the ghetto and the ghetto will be closed. The ghetto is already crowded,\nterrible uh terrible situation. A lot of...very few uh uh food. To give, to help to to supply\nthese the ghetto was Komo Otto's work and several people who was helping for him and\nthe remains the the children children home only with the children. The little children\nbecause when somebody was fourteen, fifteen years old, these children was able to find\nsome hidden place alone, and this was an interesting period. My husband get a...I think I\nnever write on and I cannot remember which cloister (ph) was this that my husband went\nin and asked papers, Christian origin papers for girls, certificates, born certificate or\nparents uh uh marriage certificate to...some certificate to to make a person Christian. A\nborn certificate. My husband bring these...I can't remember...this was quite a lot of papers\nand he get these from a from a clo...cloister and began to ask uh younger woman who 1s\nabout this age, who can, who can use these. This was born in this age, some similarity\nsome similar age, and this paper was enough to go out and to to be to get a job like a\npostman was not working, postwoman was not working very much in this but the\ntram...tramway, tram, electric tram on the street...this was working and there was to sold\nthe tickets, the women work, and the the new the Nilos regime is very primitive. Woman\nbecame the first persons. There was no more more ready to work in this very simple\nwork. So that was job available, and these Jewish women went to be a conductor on the\ntram. Get a hat and a something what was absolute perfect the uh identification for a\nChristian person so this was a a this was a way to to lower the the the population in these\nvery crowded children home. This was a way the individuals disappearing was another\nway and the and the shutzpass, but already all these protected houses, it was full, full, full\nwith people but it was not a question that people can live under under staircase or\nsomeplace, only inside someplace. Ten person in a room. It was not interesting. It was\nsure that this is not for a long time, but it was sure that this is not a life-saving. It is only a\ntime _. Never I was able to use this that we saved, we saved lives. We helped to\nsurvive from day to day, because somebody went with the good shutzpass, went from one\nplace to another. It was very possible that a gang, a Nilos gang took this, these people and\ntook them to Nilos headquarter or another not very headquarter and to began....where are\nthe Jews, where are Jews and to make the torture and and to make the nice uh \u2014__ what\nwas the only occupation from the Nilos uh uh...I cannot say this was not an army...gangs.\nThis was the only...there was not very much toto _. Only to make the personal hate\nand and to laugh on the...the torture people all the night to hang on the trees and with a\npaper that this is the fate the hidden Jewish people, all people who was hidden Jewish\npeople when...and so and it was every day more and more terror, more and more brutal",
        "A: So then remains these that uh my my husband hold the the ...the contact between the\nEmbassy, between the safe houses to bring something, more and more shutzpasses,\nmore...a little food and this was the maximum what in this this situation was\nposs....possible to make. The front was very close. The fight was very intensive. On the\non the street. He he was able to to use the car till uh till a certain day when it is written\nalready that he was was uh get a bomb. Near him was sitting a gentile. In the in the car\nwas earlier a Jewish surgeon, physician. He took this physician for a 1n a first aid place to\nput down. That was another Jewish person. He...my husband wanted to put in another\nplace...I don't remember where...when I get a splinter for a bump. That was a time that\nthese two people was jumping out. The gendarme and this Jewish boy. I am sure that the\ngentlemen was not thought about that this is the Jews, and they was uh uh wounded. That\nwas quite...that was two gentile and one was died. That's not right. There was only one\nand nobody else died. My husband ...yeah....my leaved leaved the gendarme on the street\nbecause he would be and could be able get any any first aid or help because he was a\ngendarme, but he took these wounded Jewish boy, young person, returned to this first aid\nplace to get a a help because he was a Jewish and he was he was hitting 1n the hip. And\nuh my husband was wounded here in a place and the piece from the from the...1t was\nblood and and the auto. \u2014_\u2014smiwaass like a but the motor was still working and he told\nme the story when that he was able to to drive and he was holding his head out from the\ncar to see and the blood was running and there was smoke. It was like a film that and he\nwent to the went to this first aid place with this wounded boy and he get there the\nbandage and everything and he fainted there. And now another story connected with with\nKomo Otto.",
        "A: I think so. Yes. Yeah.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "A: Yeah. So I have heard the the name Perlasca when I...I had heard the say we have a\ncharge d'affaires. An Italian. It was...I I think the only humorous part from all the history\nbecause there was not a lot of part to smile or...but this was this was a little bit like a\ncomedy, that an Italian can be can be a Spain. I had heard not much, not very much on\nthis in this time about Perlasca. Only my husband, I went with Perlasca, with Perlasca.\nThis was a like a safety belt for my husband. And naturally Perlasca went because he\ndidn't know what he was not speaking Hungarian, so later, several days...this is the\nwhole period this was quite short, short...[ haven't heard so much about Perlasca, but\nwhen after during the war, my husband wanted from me to write down in his memory,\nthen he he was always very over-joyed with this person in the right time that that was this\nItalian that he was able to use like a Spanish, like a a Spaniard, like a charge d'affaires. It\nwas a Short time, but every short time it was a question of life and and and dying. Later I\nhaven't heard and I today I know that the only person who write down and give gratitude\nPerlasca, my husband, in my husband's memory, because all the other things, it 1s all\ncreated, these...it 1s not not interesting. It 1s a ridiculous, pompous words and and but here\nis the fact, that my husband and Farkash was very very thankful for for the to find\nfor the fate to find a person who was playing this role, and other uh very important thing\nthat after when somebody's left their embassy, the the power went to the . He\nwas their legion adviser for the embassy, the only person to continue something only to\nto be responsible for the building and for everything. This was the Dr. Farkash\nthat...",
        "A: Perlasca made Perlasca made the in about all the Farkash was told we are making\nthese. We are making these. As long he was ready, but not till the end.",
        "A: In this uh this new beginning or...",
        "A: Yeah. This is this is the very tragic time. Otto Komo prepared himself. He get a a help\nfrom the earlier early December, November from Switzerland because as I told I am very\nsorry but if I am against the history, but Frederick Bond (ph) was a very heavy person.\nAnd uh they asked from from Switzerland a help with more more uh flexible to help and\nto to take this this uh _ and they arrived in Budapest uh . He was a person...he\nwas he was occupied to be with Komo Otoo and to help to Komo Otto. He was a very\nhelpful per...person, and they made a good friendship, Komo Otto and . Almost\nevery every day they was together. But as the time went closer and closer to the end, my\nhusband was worried more and more for for Komo Otto and he prepared a place in the\nSpanish Embassy for Komo Otto, a nice, comparing nice office building, uh telephone,\neverything because all the building was empty. The people who was uh refuge refugee\nthere, Jews or Christian people was under shelter, because almost non-stop was the\nbomb, bombs. And my husband began to speak very serious with Komo Otto. Come in in\nthe Spanish Consulate. You can continue the same work. You can continue your your\nconnection. There is telephone and and come in because you are in danger in the Ritz\nHotel. It is more and more uh shining that he 1s living such a...he was not a pompous\nperson. He wanted to make in the Ritz Hotel an office for the for the...to send the people\nin after the war in uh in Palestine. And when, and he was always no...I am I am in secure\nhere. [have heres and I am in the in the spotlight from the Wallenberg, ,a\ngeneral come and other neutral uh Portuguese...I don't know the name from the\nPortuguese. He has had a feeling that he is OK. It is absolute legal in this place. Then my\nhusband began to speak the with the with the wife and to influence that bring in in the\nSpanish Consulate, so this was a very from my husband because he was looking\nat Komo Otto like a he take care of, he was. He was. He was able to go in the\nvery beginning with the personal group and leave Budapest and he chose to remain there,\nlike the Jews. Not a very few lived there, Jews lived there. Was able...not quite a few but\nI think no one was ready to make the choice that I I can leave Hungary and I remain\nbecause I have a a work to make this, so it was really in the like a romantic hero, and my\nhusband was very very fond for Komo Otto. So it went this influence as long as he was\nready. The 31st December that my husband will will go there and will bring Komo Otto\nand the wife in the Spanish Consulate with their belongings. This was the very day when\nmy husband earlier went to to make this tour to put this physician to the place and then\nget these bumps and he remains there uh uh un...unconscious, my husband, there in this\nfirst aid place. Several hours he was lying there and then he came back and____ was the\nmotor was still working and he was able to bring the car back to the Spanish consulate.\nHis uh head was full with blood, with a big bandage, and he bring back the auto and and\nthe very place the auto died. No more work. It was a miracle that it was able to bring\nback. I..and the next day my husband...yeah, my husband called from the from the\nembassy Komo Otto that this happened in the mean time. I was not able to bring you\nbecause this and this happened, but tomorrow morning I will find a car and I will go to\nbring, bring you in in the Spanish Consulate, and this was the OK. And this was the very\nevening, 31 uh 31 December evening when there in the hotel was standing Komo Otto\ntogether with the _ and the and the wife...came in two or three Nilos person and they\nwas speaking very polite that we wanted only several question to to ask from you and\nwould you be ready to come in, to come out from and he went out from and he\ndisappeared. He was kidnapped and how he was tortured it is no question and no fantasy\nto think about this. The second day that my husband called that I am ready to bring in\nthe...the woman told my husband he disappeared. And there was no way to...there was no\nway to ask questions. Naturally my husband asked Wallenberg to ask, to look\nsomewhere, someplace, some police station, some Nilos uh uh headquarters. No more.\nAnd this remains in in my husband's life like a a something he was never out from this\nthat he was able to help. He had seen that this that this person in in such a danger, and it\nhappened that he was not able to help. That what he made when he went to Israel. First of\nall, there was not any credit in his behalf on Komo's name. Nobody was interested.\nNobody knows about who was Komo, what, what happened. Most of Hungarian people\nwas not interested because a lot of Hungarian people there in Israel is from country or\nfrom from Transylvania.",
        "A: Sure. These these uh this was the most tragic day in our life, when my husband came\nback home even in our home and he told me Komo Otto disappeared, and then was the\nfeeling that every person, every minute, everywhere can disappear. It was not a question\nbefore. No more, no more leader. No more to ask somebody to help. The only person he\nmanaged to help it was Wallenberg, and no more other, because there was uh diplomatic\npersons who was not coming out like it is not a to mention Shalutz (ph). He was\nhelp everything but personally he was not going to to to making...to be uh in touch with\nthe Nilos people. He was not ready for this. . Even not .",
        "A: In those time I was not very in...1nformed what he is making, only I knowed and I have\nheard that Wallenberg was ready to go after the people, not only to give a paper and\ngoodbye, you are you are going away with this and help these people, paper .\nThen he was personally ready to to be touched with with the with the brutal uh uh low\nlower ranking people till the ministers and everybody, and to speak with with the whole\nuh possibility to the welfare for the for the Jewish people. He was the only person, he\nwas make he made this personally. Not by letter. Not by uh sign a a piece of paper\npersonally. This I have heard. And this was the uh example uh this was like a a...Miriam,\nhelp me.... (say it in Hungarian)....uh . (Example). Exactly. This was\nthe example how what other persons can can make like (cough) when there in\n...this 1s a other uh other section when when the death march went to\n...he sent his people on the way to help and they helped people. He went...I don't\nknow personally or even his people to at least that these people 1s saved by the\nSwede uh Embassy uh Con...uh Embassy and these people I I have right to to bring back.\nImmediately their the brain-trust in the Swiss Consulate began to make the same thing.\nThen it was and this was the example and to send the the the note and peoples and\npeoples to bring back people and in in the way to help or to bring some uh some people\nwhat is possible from the death march. The ___ was active immediately after is the\nSpanish Consulate. Then we can make a list for our person and my husband gave to to\nWallenberg when your pers...personal personally was somebody from from your help go,\nbring this with. This is another list, and these were these went 1n this way the work. It\nwas a little period when my husband was ready to go personally to , very risky for\na Jewish person, but it was everything was risky, even to live in Budapest was risky. But\nuh when came out that Wallenberg told my husband you remain here and when the\npeople came back, you can you can arrange from the wagon to to bring back some place.\nUh Wallenberg sent his person personnel to bring back the Swedish people but there was\nInternational Red Red Cross, then Swiss and Spanish. This was...this remains for my\nhusband, and my husband took the people when somebody was able to go on the foot it\nwas there was a very very terrible uh uh situation. These people after the death march and\nto back with uh with uh train naturally like a like a cattle...",
        "A: Yeah. The war ended in in last several days, because it was like a . There was the\n15th of January in January, the Spanish Consulate uh 16th of Jan...January when...the last\nweek my husband went, my husband remains there in the in the Embassy. He was living\nthere because there was the front between us and it was impossible to go on the street and\nuh he remains there and I was with my children and in another place in the very middle\nofthe \u2014_, so my husband was uh...I must use this...the get the freedom uh 16th of\nJanuary and it didn't get 18th...two days later. It was not a pompous thing to uh...soldiers\nwas coming in in the house and look after...there was several auto on the courtyard. They\nwas looking and I was looking that the there was some very interesting hats, _ furs,\nand and I went down and I asked because uh my family was not never in the\nshelter. We was always in a flat. I wanted not to go in the shelter because my my\nson...and uh I went down. My sister was...my sister, my hus...my husband, two children\nand I, we was 1n a in a flat. And I went down and I was looking this person and he was\nvery and I am asking Hungarian \u2014 and he told, _. I didn't know what is,\nwhat is the meaning _. This was Hungarian _. I was not very very uh sure that this\nisreal___ and I'm asking Moscow and it was Siberia. Oh, I said. So long ways to go to\ngive our freedom from Siberia...this was real . | was very happy and he took out a\nbox uh a silver box with cigarettes...somewhere I get that, and he took a cigarette out and\nI was a smoker and I was looking the cigarette because I was since a long time without\ncigarette, and he give me a cigarette. I was taking one with my shaking hand and he took\nanother, andI was _, and I run out and I am shouting...here is the Russian. Here 1s\nthe...we are free. We are free. The day after...in this flat we was living together with two\nyoung persons. There was another room that was in uniform Nilos uh persons but to to\nmake short the story, this person was Jewish person with Nilos uniform. My husband find\nout almost immediately that this 1s Polish Nilos and I was fighting a little bit...it is\nimpossible so perfect a good uniform and so on and so on, so my my husband told be\nquiet. This person is with the Nilos and he was a little way uh friendly together but I get\nthis letter from my husband that this person must be Jewish, very elegant, Nilos but\nJewish, and I run up and I open the door and I am shouting at the boys...here is the, here\nis the Russian army. There was coming out immediately told me don't uh call me in this\nway because I am this...don't call me in this way...(laughter)...and my husband told me\nbefore we separated when something happened not to be the first to to say your real\nname. Maybe that the front is a little bit moving back one day. It is enough to kill people.\nI was standing there with my false name and I was not able to say that I am not this.\n(Laughter) And this was the first day.",
        "A: Yeah. So after the war (cough), my my husband began to speak about to immigrate...\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "A: So after the war we went...we return in our uh uh flat. My husband continued to work\nwith the with the Red Cross, International Red Cross because the two...because the two\ndelegates was not...it is OK?",
        "A: When uh...I don't remember which time we get...you hear about Wallenberg disappear. I\nthink we saw that he went back to Sweden and uh we was not uh not thinking about that\nhe is something happened. The last uh time uh that was an agreement between\nWallenberg and my husband to say all this was uh less and less people between\nWallenberg, Komo and Szamosi...it was the people disappeared, voluntary or or\ndisappeared by their hands, from the Nilos. And they remains together and there was the\nvery last time uh Wallenberg and Szamosi was speaking about this and what will happen\nwhen the Russian army arrives our home, then they they was speaking about that about\nthe first thing will be that we are going to the headquarters, to the Russian headquarters\nand to ask help to help uh these people from the ghetto and and the children in the\nchildren home, very very terrible uh...and to ask to to to tell what we was making and to\nget some help from the Russian army. This was a very naive uh program. So Wallenberg\ndisappeared. It was not a...we didn't know immediately. There was no more telephone,\nand very very difficult connection. My husband continued to work with the children\nhome because there was one or two place where immediately when the Russian army\narrived here people was running out and left the children without any help.\nEverybody was thinking about myself, about to see my home, my family, to find my\nbelongings...and there was one or two home where the children any help. My\nhusband asked his uh uh brother who was a physician for children to come with me and\nanother person, an elderly woman...she was a secretary in my husband's place...to help to\ngive the children out and to put in some hospital or something. So he worked with the\nwith the Red...International Red Cross till I think end of August or beginning of\nSeptember, to help these people. We was living and began to live a new life after the war,\nbut my husband always wanted to immigrate but I was one sickness to the other,\noperation and everything, and so when the time till uh '49, and in '49 we left\nHungary...what was another miracle with all the belong...belongings and we went to\nIsrael.",
