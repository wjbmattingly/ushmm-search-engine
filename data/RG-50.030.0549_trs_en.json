        "Answer: My pleasure.",
        "Q: And as we do with all of our interviews, we\u2019re going to begin at the beginning.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: We\u2019d like to hear \u2014 we\u2019d like to lay the groundwork, and that means where you\nwere born, when you were born, your family, who was your family. So, short\ndescriptions of your father and your mother, if you had any siblings, their names.\nAnd before we start with that, there\u2019s something I see that\u2019s very unusual, with mo\n\u2014 from most of the interviews that we\u2019ve conducted, in that today you are Sonja\nDuBois, and on the day you were born you were Clara van Tyne(ph). That\u2019s quite\na different name.",
        "A: Isn\u2019t it?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: So, ex \u2014",
        "A: And I\u2019ve had a name in between.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "Q: So, it\u2019s all a\u2014 you know, here it is \u2014",
        "A: All right. Yes, I was \u2014",
        "Q: Explain it to us.",
        "A: Yes, I was born October 1994 \u2014 \u2019?90 \u2014 1940, of course, in Rotterdam, The\nNetherlands, or Holland, whichever way you want to put that, to a young Jewish\ncouple named Moshe and Sophie van Tyne(ph). They were \u2014 had been married in\n1939, and I was born in 1940, and their lives ended in 1942, and I was their only\nchild.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: And \u2014",
        "Q: Is van Tyne(ph) a\u2014 a Dutch Jewish name?",
        "A: Yes, it\u2019s a\u2014",
        "Q: So you \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 it\u2019s a dut \u2014 Dutch Jewish name, but I never knew what my name was until\nquite a few \u2014 few years later. To get to the en \u2014 to the initial part of the story, which\nwill \u2014 you will want to \u2014 will want to come back to, is in 1938, a cousin got out of\nThe Netherlands on the last ship, Hospel(ph). Her name \u2014 her \u2014 her new husband\nand her, and her baby girl, went to Australia, cause United States wasn\u2019t accepting\nany more refugees. And these people figured back into my life much later.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "Q: What are their names?",
        "A: Oh boy. Bev Schulster(ph) is the daughter of Aunt Alice. Aunt Alice van\nHilder(ph).",
        "Q: Van Hilder(ph).",
        "A: Yeah, g-e-l, yeah. She and her young husband; he used to travel abroad, and kind\nof saw the handwriting on the wall. And he and his wife and little baby girl, and his\nparents came over. Who turned back up in life way later.",
        "Q: Okay, okay. So, when you were born in 1940, where were you born \u2014 were you\nstill with \u2014 yeah, of course you were with your mother, but were your parents in\ntheir own home? Were they both \u2014",
        "A: You know, I th \u2014 I think I might have been born right after their initial home was\nbombed. They lived in the old city in Rotterdam and I understand that was bombed\nearly on by the Nazi. So, they either lived there or another place in Rotterdam, and\nI know \u2014 I know that address. The initial address is, you know, no longer.",
        "Q: Did you ever see photos of them?",
        "A: I have one precious photo of them. And I didn\u2019t get that until I was 60 years old.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: Which 1s a long time ago, too, you know.",
        "Q: No.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: But I'll tell you how it \u2014",
        "Q: It\u2019s a long time \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s a long time to wonder what your mother looked like, what she smelled\nlike, you know, the intimacy that you \u2014 that surely kids \u2014",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: \u2014 I presume.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: You know, all this I presume they develop with their mother, because I was 21\nmonths old when they were deported to Westerbork. And \u2014",
        "Q: By that time you were in hiding? That mo \u2014 by that time you had been taken\naway from them, or they had \u2014",
        "A: No, the day they got on the \u2014 on the train, on the transport to Westerbork, I was\nhanded over, they handed me over to a friend of theirs. And, you know, I will never\nknow if \u2014 1f this was a \u2014 of course it was agonizing \u2014 if it was a decision that they\nhad made prior to that, or if 1t was just because, as I heard it later, Daddy\u2019s friend\nsaid, you don\u2019t want to take this child with you. I sort of think of the earlier, you\nknow, that they had agonized over it and decided that they didn\u2019t really know where\nthey were going yet in \u201942, except, you know, you haven\u2019t worked in awhile, and\nthey promised people jobs, too, so \u2014\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "Q: Well, what \u2014 what \u2014 do you know what he had been doing, what his job had\nbeen?",
        "A: Yes, yes, as a matter of fact, after the war, I have a few precious papers, and one\nof these was his dismissal letter, which was typed in 1941, just a paragraph. And it\nsaid that they were very sorry, due to circumstances, they had to let him go, but\nwould recommend him to anyone. So when I \u2014 and he \u2014 he worked in a \u2014 he chaired\na linguist department like \u2014 it was an export company, so I guess he knew\nlanguages.",
        "Q: Oh, so it was an export company that had a department of \u2014 of \u2014 of many\nmultilingual people.",
        "A: Probably, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: And he was the head of that department.",
        "A: And so he, you know, he hadn\u2019t worked at \u2014 in awhile, and I tried to look up that\ncompany many years later when I si \u2014 finally started researching and found out they\nwere a Jewish company too, and of course, had been bought for pennies on the\ndollar, or guilden.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Long time before that. So he \u2014\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "Q: At 21 \u2014 at 21 months old, I would be very surprised to think that you\u2019d have any\nmemories of that time.",
        "A: No, Pm\u2014",
        "Q: What are your earliest memories?",
        "A: It\u2019s really strange. An earl \u2014 earliest memory that I have didn\u2019t flash in \u2014 see, my\nlife\u2019s floating puzzle pieces, didn't flash in until maybe a dozen years ago, when my\nhusband and I were in Saint Thomas and they have these little boats that go\nbetween hotels and port. And there was this \u2014 they look like little Thomas the train\ntrains. And I said to Ron, I said, I\u2019ve been on one of those before. And smells are\nalways the strongest memory for me. And I smell that I\u2019ve been on that boat before.\nWell, the person I was given to, after we went [indecipherable] and that was a\ntemporary situation, when Mom came to pick me up, she tells me, she went one\nway, like my tram probably, and came back another way, which was across the\nMass river, you know, not to be traced. And I remember sitting down on a little\nbench, smelling that smoke go over me, and oh, it\u2019s so strange that, you know,\nthings like that still happen. And put \u2014",
        "Q: The little flashes.",
        "A: Yeah, they just \u2014 they\u2019re just little flashes.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "Q: So, what happened to y \u2014 what happened to you before your earliest memories\nkick in, that you were told later, of your road? Your parents are there until they\u2019re\ndeported to Westerbork. At the time of their deportation, they hand you to\nsomebody.",
        "A: Right, to Mr. Dolf Henkes, who became quite a well known artist in Europe.\nAnd that\u2019s an important connection, cause until like the 80s, I couldn\u2019t figure out\nwhy I was given to one person and not to another. He was a friend of Daddy\u2019s, and I\ndid find out later that they were both artists. Daddy\u2019s an art \u2014 was an artist.",
        "Q: Your father in \u2014 when you say daddy, you mean your birth father?",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: There are Mother and Daddy, and Mom and Pop.",
        "Q: Okay. That\u2019s how they\u2019re distinguished.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Okay. And Mom and Pop are the people who raised you?",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So, I was given to Mr. Henkes, he was a single man, always was, and had \u2014 took\nme home \u2014 well, first he took me to farm country, where a lot of kids were hidden,\nNovember 10, 2008\nbut he found \u2014 the conditions he\u2019d found were atrocious. It was behind a chicken\ncoup, there was a family there. And I think it was a mutual decision, they didn\u2019t\nwant me, cause I cried a lot, you know, I would have given them away.",
        "Q: You\u2019re a baby.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You\u2019re a baby.",
        "A: I\u2019m probably missing my mommy. So he took me home, and then through the\nunderground, nobody\u2019 ll ever know where, who, what, because I\u2019ve tried to find out.\nJust within the last two years I was rejected to have them named as Righteous\nGentiles, cause we couldn\u2019t find \u2014 one of the reasons was we couldn\u2019t find enough\nwitnesses.",
        "Q: We can talk \u2014",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: We can talk about that later.",
        "A: Yeah, okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Fine. Enough witnesses. So he took me home, Mom and Pop are \u2014 Mom came to\npick me up. And I think the reason my birthday was celebrated in August, nobody\nknew a thing about me, was that they got me in August, you know. I know when\nNovember 10, 2008\nMother and Daddy went to Westerbork, that was like the 27\" or something, July.\nFigure they futzed around a little bit, finally found somebody. So in August, it was,\nyou know, a new beginning for me. And they couldn\u2019t have children, so you know,\nI was an answer to their prayers as well.",
        "Q: And where did \u2014 where were they \u2014 who are \u2014 what are their names, and where\nwere they from?",
        "A: They\u2019re \u2014 were Elizabeth and wille \u2014 William van der Kaden.",
        "Q: Van der Kagan(ph)?",
        "A: Kaden.",
        "Q: Kaden.",
        "A: Which 1s of the dike, in Holland.",
        "Q: Okay, van der Kaden.",
        "A: And they had always lived in Scheidam, which is a city right next to\nRotterdam. And he \u2014 he was active, Pop was active in the underground, and Mom\nused to volunteer the Red Cross, so it\u2019s \u2014 you know. I\u2019m sure they had \u2014",
        "Q: How old were they? Were they older than your own parents?",
        "A: No, they were \u2014 Mom was born in the same year, 1913, just like Mother and\nDaddy were, and Pop was maybe about five years older.",
        "Q: Okay.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: So \u2014 but I didn\u2019t look like anybody, you know, when \u2014 it\u2019s amazing how many\npeople \u2014 it really did take a village to bring up this child, because they weren\u2019t the\nonly \u2014 you know, they took the biggest risk, but there was the pediatrician they\nfound to examine me, who guessed at my age. Yeah, August sounds good, you\nknow. Two years old, fine. You know, it\u2019s two or three months. There was the food\nstamp office that gave me a s\u2014 a stamp so I could eat.",
        "Q: Eat. So you\u2019d have food rations.",
        "A: Yeah, I had food rations. Let\u2019s see, what else? Oh, there were people that Mom\nknew \u2014 oh, one friend of theirs was a policeman, and from an old coat of his, I got\nthis wonderful navy cape that she sewed. I must have look \u2014 you know, and it had a\nlining, I remember a plaid lining. So I must have, you know, worn. And the \u2014 the\nfirst picture I had was with a little knitted dress that was pulled \u2014 you know, it was\nwarm. Nobody else had anything either. So, they pull that thing on and started over,\nand made this pretty dress for this little girl.",
        "Q: And you \u2014 you had no brothers and sisters in that family, or did you?",
        "A: None. No, I had \u2014 you know, I was first child of my natural family and they\nnever had children either. So, as Mom used to call me when she aged, and could\nremember my name, she\u2019d say, oh, here comes my only one. So, you know, we all \u2014\nalways meant a lot to each other.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "Q: Then let\u2019s go back to your \u2014 your \u2014 you\u2019ve been \u2014 you end up with them, and\nyour earliest memories then, with them. Do you ha \u2014 can you pull those \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, yes. As a matter of fact, I wrote a story about this, because it keeps\nflashing in front of my eyes. And that is the first time I saw a parade, or I thought I\nsaw a parade. We u \u2014 we lived three different places during four years, by the way.",
        "Q: You were with them for four years?",
        "A: No, I was with them all my life, but \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 you know, communication was much slower than it was \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: \u2014 so when people in one end of town started making \u2014 posing questions that they\ncouldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t answer, we\u2019d just move across town. Well, you know, that\ndoesn\u2019t make any sense now, but it did then.",
        "Q: Of course, of course.",
        "A: So, the second place we lived was on the second floor, and in Holland you had\nthese little spy windows at \u2014 at the front of the window, so you could see who was\nat the front door. Well, I was not \u2014 never ne \u2014 knew why, I was never allowed near\nthe window anyhow. Strange rule, I thought, but \u2014",
        "Q: You weren\u2019t allowed, yeah.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Not allowed near the window. Well, what do you do when you\u2019re told you\u2019re not\n\u2014 told you\u2019re not allowed?",
        "Q: Go to the window.",
        "A: Well, you go to the window.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So, I don\u2019t know how old I was, but I know it was at dusk. It was a rainy \u2014 it was\nthat nasty rain they have in Holland, just kind of slithers down and co \u2014",
        "Q: Cold and clammy.",
        "A: Yeah. And there is a \u2014 a parade of men, and I could count, I could count to 10, I\nthink. And there were five men across, and then a row back, and I don\u2019t know how\nmany there were. And they were \u2014 there was a drum in front of them, one drummer.\nAnd these people had strange costumes, to a child\u2019s eye. They were all kind of\nbrown and gray and black. But it wasn\u2019t a happy parade. Just kind of strange, but I\nthought it was a parade, because I had never seen a parade, probably. And some\nwore hats, and some that \u2014 I can remember the glistening of their hair, those that\nweren't \u2014 weren\u2019t wearing hats. They all had carried a roll of some sort, which later\non I figured out were blankets. Where we lived, just around the block was a train\nstation.",
        "Q: Oh.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: And so, they were having their last walk in their city, because you know, when\nthey went to the train station and the door closed \u2014",
        "Q: So these were not soldiers, these were just ordinary people?",
        "A: These were \u2014 these were men that were found, they\u2019re being deported. And of\ncourse, you know, I was being protected from whatever nasty was going on. I didn\u2019t\nknow it was nasty. I couldn\u2019t figure it out. Why would you have a parade on a rainy\nday, why didn't they cancel it? I knew that much. And there wasn\u2019t any happy\nmusic.",
        "Q: And there was a drummer. That\u2019s so strange.",
        "A: Yeah, it was just a \u2014 a single drummer. And then of course, it was much later\nwhen I figured out that their fate was probably sealed when \u2014",
        "Q: They were found.",
        "A: \u2014 they sealed the doors of the train.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: And \u2014 but, you know, Mom and Pop always, always worked hard at protecting\nme from \u2014 from my other life. I\u2014 my life kind of became a conspiracy of silence.\nThere is good and there is bad in that, I\u2019m afraid.",
        "Q: Did you play with other kids during the war years?\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: No, I belonged to \u2014 they tried to make life as normal as possible for me. I\nremember going to a pre-school or kindergarten, or something like that.",
        "Q: Did they look very different than you?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Your parents \u2014 I mean, your \u2014 your adopted parents? They did?",
        "A: Oh yeah. Pop was red haired, kind of bald already, and Mom was a dark blonde.\nSo \u2014 but there were questions all the time, and \u2014 and in another group of people who\n\u2014 who could have \u2014 who became part of the \u2014 the extended family were the teachers\nand the parents that used to pick the kids up. Where\u2019d this little girl come from?\nHow come, you know, she doesn\u2019t look like any of us? I have a picture, you know,\nclass picture, of me. I was short, I was sitting on the bench in the front row, and\nthere\u2019s like a row behind me and a teacher on each side. It\u2019s one redhead, all\ntowheads and me, you know, so you know, my hair is still black. And that had to be\nvery telling, and it was years, years, years later that my girlfriend Welly(ph), who I\nstill correspond with in Holland, told me, we were all sworn to silence. The reason\nwas given that it would just hurt me. It would, you know, upset me to know that I\ndidn\u2019t belong [indecipherable]. Well, of course, kids have that instinct where they\nknow that, or I did, anyhow. By the time I was about five years old I figured out\nthat \u2014\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "Q: Something\u2019s different.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: How\u2019d you figure that out?",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s hard to tell. There again, snippets.",
        "Q: Well, let\u2019s have them, snippets.",
        "A: The most obvious was that towards the end of the war, we used to \u2014 you know,\npeople walk there all the time. I used to walk around the city and meet\nacquaintances and friends. And I\u2019d be standing here holding [indecipherable], and\nthe conversation was always the same. Well, who have you heard from, did\nanybody come back? When \u2014 when\u2019s anybody coming back? That \u2014 and the answer\nwas always negative, no, we don\u2019t know. And I\u2019m standing right there. So\neventually I figure out, they\u2019re talking about Mother and Daddy. And \u2014",
        "Q: Did you always know \u2014",
        "A: \u2014I felt \u2014I felt \u2014 I felt \u2014 I think I felt cheated, cause nobody ever told me\nanything. I was spoken about \u2014 it\u2019s like, even when I was older, but I was never\nspoken to. I wasn\u2019t given the fact that I had an intelligence, that I had ears, you\nknow, that I could hear. People don\u2019t adopt kids that way, not that I was ever\nadopted, but they don\u2019t handle situations like that. Course, during the war they\ndidn\u2019t have much choice.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "Q: Yeah. Were you tol \u2014 do you remember ever being \u2014 did you \u2014 when you came\nto them, were they your mother and father? For all intents and purposes, you had no\n\u2014no other mother and father, or did you always know that you had another one,\nanother set of parents?",
        "A: At that point where we\u2019re putting things together, I knew. I wasn\u2019t told until six\nyears later.",
        "Q: So you were only told when you were like 11 years old.",
        "A: Almost 12, right.",
        "Q: Almost 12. But at that point is when you started suspecting that you had a \u2014 there\nwas something \u2014",
        "A: M-More.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Because of that conversation, always the same.",
        "A: Yeah. You know, I was \u2014",
        "Q: Did you ask them, and they just deflected your answers?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t \u2014 you know, I didn\u2019t begin to ask until after to \u2014 they told me,\nbecause instinctively I think I knew it would hurt their feelings, or I wouldn\u2019t be a\ngood girl, and we were all trying to be very good, and you know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And \u2014\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "Q: Did you have \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 it was kind of cowardly, I guess, you look at it now, but I was a little girl, you\nknow?",

And it\u2019s also \u2014 what a \u2014 what we\u2019ve\nfound in \u2014 1s that there\u2019s a lot of people who had silences in their lives, in their early\nlives. And most of the reasons \u2014 and sometimes they don\u2019t know those reasons, you\ncan only kind of assume, but those who 1-impose the silences, let\u2019s say your \u2014 your\n\u2014 your \u2014",
        "A: Mom and Pop.",
        "Q: \u2014 adopted parents \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. Didn\u2019t want to traumatize the child. They \u2014 they \u2014 they didn\u2019t know \u2014",
        "A: I think they didn\u2019t know how to begin.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right. They didn\u2019t know what to \u2014 how would they handle this, and they\ndidn't know what effect it could have on you. Or \u2014 I mean, I\u2019m assuming too. I\ndon\u2019t know.",
        "A: And on them.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Later on you find, you know \u2014\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 you \u2014 well. Let\u2019s talk a little bit how I was kept alive.",
        "Q: Yes, please.",
        "A: These \u2014 these people \u2014 you know, everybody in Holland was hungry, too. It was\nthe land of, you know, butter and milk and cows, and you know, the \u2014 the soldiers\nwere getting it all, you know, they had to keep the troops alive.",
        "Q: So how were you kept alive?",
        "A: There one \u2014 one day \u2014 one meal a day, a hot meal, was the meal of the day. I\nused to go \u2014 in Holland we have a lot of aunts and uncles, just everybody\u2019s an aunt\nand uncle. They found an aunt and uncle for me who gave me hot meal a day.\nNobody asked where they got the food, or you know, that type of thing. But I went\nto these folks, my little cape on. And it must have been just a couple of blocks,\ncause I went by myself. And \u2014",
        "Q: Why didn\u2019t you eat at home? Didn\u2019t they have the food?",
        "A: Well, they were getting to the s \u2014 going to the soup kitchen and getting this, you\nknow, two slices of bread and this thin soup.",
        "Q: No, no, I\u2019m \u2014 what I \u2014 where my curiosity comes from is that you had a ration\ncard; somebody had colluded and given you a ration card.",
        "A: Yeah, but that food was pretty yuk for a three year old.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "Q: Oh, I see, I see.",
        "A: All right, yeah, yeah, 1t was \u2014",
        "Q: So-",
        "A: \u2014 it wasn\u2019t nourishing. Couldn\u2019t get any milk. I have another story about how I\ngot milk. But, you know, to get a regular, substantial meal, I was told I was a little\nwaif already by the time I came to them. Which is likely because I wasn\u2019t getting\nenough to eat, you know, at Mother and \u2014 and Daddy\u2019s.",
        "Q: And so you went to this aunt and uncle who were probably not their relations\neither, but just \u2014",
        "A: No, no, they weren\u2019t.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And, you know, it was sort of shady, I\u2019m sure, as to where they got their food.\nAnd \u2014 but I had a nice, hot meal, and it was so sweet. I would come home and I\nremember this distinctly, I don\u2019t know why it didn\u2019t \u2014 you know, some things just\ncome to me, and \u2014 and Pop would have the \u2014 they have these little tins, like I think\nprobably Laura Ingalls carried to her \u2014 to lunch for school.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: And the soup would be in there, and he would ask me if I was still hungry. And\nI\u2019m told that nine out of times \u2014 10 times, I ate it, you know.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "Q: Well",
        "A: [indecipherable] you \u2014 you know, I didn\u2019t know, but I didn\u2019t need it, you know,\nand he \u2014 he did.",
        "Q: You \u2014 maybe you were hungry.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Your \u2014 you\u2019re a child and they know that, and they know that, and they loved\nyou.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: That\u2019s what it sounds like because they were \u2014 there could have been a situation\n\u2014 you were with a family which would not have fed you more than they needed to.",
        "A: Right, right. Yeah, it was \u2014 it was fine. So, you know. And Pop used to cook\nsugar beets. And every \u2014 they c \u2014 they cut them in strips, and then they simmer\nthem, and it makes some sort of syrup. And he would cut them, and he was always\nhungry. And he would give me a si \u2014 a little piece of \u2014 half of that, and he says,\ndon\u2019t tell Momma. You know, but he wa \u2014 he was my buddy.",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 did you ever feel, during the \u2014 during the war times, that you were in\ndanger? Did you ever remember such a feeling?",
        "A: Yes. Yeah, I do. I remember \u2014 you know, in Holland the bathrooms are not the\nway they \u2014 ours are. They call them WCs and they were water closets, they really\nNovember 10, 2008\nare. And Mom and I, I\u2014 I do remember sitting there, not knowing why, being held\non her lap, and hearing these high pitched sounds, and those were, of course, the\nbombs, or the bombers flying near, or whatever. But we used to sit in the \u2014",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: \u2014 1n the \u2014 in the toilet there. And another time there was a \u2014 a man raid, and\nsomebody had warned us. Pop had already hidden out with a friend of his, and we\nwere to go there as well. And it was a \u2014 must have been summer, because I\nremember the cobbles \u2014 I had bare feet, and so it was at night and the cobblestones\nwere slick, but not ice cold \u2014 because Mom was carrying a \u2014 a pot of soup or\nsomething like that, and her \u2014 she said to the soldier that she had to go to\nkrankenhaus.",
        "Q: To the hospital.",
        "A: Right. And I guess in those days, whatever you had, you brought. And she told\nme to, you know, go ahead and run ahead. And it\u2019s the black boots that frightened\nme. I don\u2019t own a pair of black boots. There will never be any in my closet.\nBecause, you know, Nazis boots came up, probably to my eye level.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: And that is, you know, that\u2019s just one of those quirks that still exists in my life,\nand \u2014\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 the dane \u2014 the first danger that you mentioned 1s the kind that would\nbe indiscriminate. It \u2014 you know, a bomb falls, it doesn\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 care who it falls on. Was there danger about you?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think there \u2014 I was eve \u2014 Mom and Pop were ever personally, or myself,\nattacked, to \u2014 where we ha \u2014 where we felt \u2014 where I felt I\u2019m safe.",
        "Q: So, the only thing was is that occasionally someone would say something, ask\ntoo many questions about where you came from, and you moved.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: But not to the p \u2014",
        "A: Oh, and what I remember, the man I was given to, Mr. Henkes, I \u2014 to a \u2014 the\nearlier address we lived in, came \u2014 and I think he tried to come and see me.",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay, okay.",
        "A: Okay, all right then.",
        "Q: Yeah, the earlier man, mm-hm.",
        "A: We lived, again, second story, and I remember that someone said that Mr.\nHenkes tried to come see me. I guess to see if I was all right. And I remember, you\nknow, Mom and Pop being very upset about that. And he got a picture of me, and I\nknow the day it was passed to him. I don\u2019t know why I knew that. I was about four\nNovember 10, 2008\nyears old, and there\u2019s this picture of me holding a doll carriage. And one of the\nteachers handed something over the fence. I don\u2019t know why I knew it was my\npicture, and I didn\u2019t think of it again until much later, 1987, but we\u2019re not there yet.",
        "Q: We'll get \u2014 we\u2019ll get there. We\u2019ll get there. But, do you think that he came to\nvisit you close to the end of the war? Is that \u2014 if you were four years old, and it was\n19 \u2014 you were born 1n 1940, so that would take it, you know, half a year a \u2014",
        "A: I know.",
        "Q: \u2014 yeah, half a year away from, you know, liberation.",
        "A: Liberation. No, it must have been earlier than that, because we didn\u2019t live near\nthat railroad yet. The address I came to was the one where I remember \u2014 because\nacross the street, on the ground level, was a \u2014 I guess he was an invalid, he was an\nold man who used to sit in the window and wave at me. I call him Opa, you know.",
        "Q: Yeah. Oh, I just had a thought, what was it?",
        "A: Jot it down.",
        "Q: Went in one ear and out the other. Let me see if I can rece \u2014 recover it. But in the\nmeantime, are there any other memories from the ti \u2014 yes, I remember now what it\nwas. Your Pop, what was his job, what did he do?",
        "A: Carpenter.",
        "Q: He was a carpent \u2014\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Carpenter cabinetmaker, right.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And \u2014",
        "A: And that was \u2014 cause he didn\u2019t have a job over the fren \u2014 over the \u2014 during the\nwar, either, you know, nobody was working doing any construction. And he\ncouldn\u2019t get one after the war in that trade, because all the wood was gone. You\nknow, people chopped down little trees, they used their furniture to burn their f \u2014",
        "Q: To heat.",
        "A: \u2014 you know, to get so \u2014 to heat, yeah, or you know, there \u2014 there were no jobs.",
        "Q: Did they come from large families, your adoptive parents?",
        "A: Pop was one of six, and Mom was one of three. No, I think Pop was one of\nseven, yeah.",
        "Q: And did you meet the aunts and uncles?",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, I became part of the \u2014 the family. As a ma \u2014 ma \u2014 my favorite\ncousin was on \u2014 on Pop\u2019s side, a little boy.",
        "Q: Did you ever feel like you were different, family-wise, that there was something\ndifferent about you, the way you felt, you know, in the general life?",
        "A: Not when I was with them, no. No, I would \u2014 I felt \u2014 as a matter of fact, probably\nI was the happiest when I was with them, because it was a lonely life being an only\nchild and kind of not knowing how to act. Was \u2014 I \u2014\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "Q: What do you mean by that?",
        "A: I never knew if I was being good or not. Not that I ever made any gross\nmistakes, I don\u2019t think, but it\u2019s all part of trying to please, I think. And Mom and\nPop were never dismonstrative, so I didn\u2019t know by touch, or by hug or by atta\ngirl, whether I was measuring up.",
        "Q: But when you were in the larger family you felt \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, I\u2019m just one of the kids, I\u2019m fine, yeah.",
        "Q: Did you feel that they loved you?",
        "A: Mom and Pop?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So, even if they weren't demonstrative, it wasn\u2019t because there \u2014 there was\ncoldness in the home?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. That 1s really hard to say. I think I became their possession. I don\u2019t\never feel like \u2014 like I was nurtured a lot as a child, as a little human who was\nfulfilling \u2014 this is a terrible thing, this \u2014 it\u2019s gonna sound awful \u2014 that was fulfilling\ntheir dreams.",
        "Q: It\u2019s a big burden.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: And I don\u2019t know if it was the \u2014 the age of \u2014 you know, the time, or whether it\nwas a European philosophy, but kids definitely were to be seen and not heard. And I\nalways tried to measure up to that. But I don\u2019t ever remember sitting on Mom\u2019s lap.\nI would have remembered, because my Opa, her dad, used to come over and I loved\nsitting on his lap, and we used to listen to the radio programs, and he was just my\nfavorite person in the world, you know.",
        "Q: What were their dreams that you were fulfilling?",
        "A: Well see, I never really knew. I never knew when \u2014 I knew when I was doing\nwrong, but I guess I never got \u2014 I don\u2019t know, it was kind of cold, I think.",
        "Q: So it was cold.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: It was cold.",
        "A: An-And I don\u2019t mean to si \u2014 you know, negate \u2014",
        "Q: What they did.",
        "A: \u2014 what they did. And it becomes more obvious later on in life when I did start\nasking questions, and I was rebuffed, you know, not to ask questions.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: So.",
        "Q: Okay. Hang on just a second.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: And I was \u2014 I was \u2014 you know, I was trying to be loyal to their \u2014 their wishes.\nYou know, they had wanted a child so badly, they wanted a good child, and where\nwould I have been without them? So I certainly had to be grateful. And it sure \u2014",
        "Q: Those are huge burdens though.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: For a little \u2014 for a child, those are burdens \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 to be goo \u2014 you know. Because the no \u2014",
        "A: We didn\u2019t analyze that until much later, but \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014I don\u2019t \u2014 you know, when people say, was \u2014 did you have a happy childhood?\nPll say, I don\u2019t think so. I had a comfortable childhood. I had food, I was dressed\nwell. Pop and I used to walk by windows, you know, shopping. And I guess I was\nvery clever, because I never asked for anything outright, I \u2014 I knew that wasn\u2019t the\nthing to do, but Pll si \u2014 he says \u2014 I used to say, that\u2019s all [indecipherable] this is\nwhat we\u2019ll buy someday, right? And, you know, likely it showed up, but I knew \u2014 I\nwas polite enough to know that you didn\u2019t ask for things.",
        "Q: Did they get along with one another?",
        "A: Yeah.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "Q: So it wasn\u2019t that \u2014",
        "A: Cause I \u2014 cause, well, you know, and this comes in later on. They would \u2014 they\nmade an agreement not to tell \u2014 ever tell me anything. And I think Pop would have\nbroken that, hadn\u2019t it been for Mom. She was definitely the more dominant person.",
        "Q: Were they religious?",
        "A: Yeah [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Protestant [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, Protestant.",
        "Q: Did you go to church with them?",
        "A: I went to chur \u2014 after the war, we started \u2014 you know, when you could worship\nfreely again, I went to church with them.",
        "Q: Oh, I didn\u2019t realize that Christians wouldn\u2019t have been able to worship during\nthe war.",
        "A: N-No, it\u2019s \u2014 I don\u2019t know. Maybe they didn't want to take me out in the street\nany more than normal. But I remember a minister friend of theirs, their minister, I\nguess, coming to the house and \u2014 and visiting. But I don\u2019t remember going to\nchurch until after the war.",
        "Q: Do you remember how \u2014 when the war ended?",
        "A: Oh yeah.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "Q: What was that like?",
        "A: I remember some flashes, and then later on I was, you know, as I\u2019m listening to\nthe after dinner stories, I\u2019m saying, oh that\u2019s what we\u2019re \u2014 that\u2019s what I saw. May\nfifth, 1t was in the evening, I think, when they finally heard that they\u2019d been\nliberated. And I was taken from bed. I don\u2019t remember being asleep, but I know I\nwas groggy, and they were dancing around the street with me, with all these \u2014 I saw\nall these flags, you know? That was another thing that was confiscated besides bikes\nand radios, you know, also, they had to \u2014 had to give up their flags. Well, you\nknow, you might give up one flag, but they rolled the other one up and hid it in the\nattic. And there was lots of dancing and \u2014 and music, and I remember feeling really\nout of it, you know. But \u2014 but that was \u2014",
        "Q: It was a good mood.",
        "A: \u2014 that was liberation, yeah \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 that was \u2014 yeah. And I don\u2019t know why it was such a big moment until later\non. I knew it was an odd time for me to be out, and we \u2014 you know, people being\nriotous in the street.",
        "Q: Did your life change much after liberation?\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: [had a visitor. The aunt \u2014 did I tell that one of the \u2014 Daddy\u2019s sisters \u2014 grandfa \u2014\nhis grandfather\u2019s level, his younger sister was married to a Christian who was very\nwell-to-do?",
        "Q: No, you didn't tell me about this.",
        "A: Okay, well, Tante Sinke(ph) was married to this man who was a Christian, so\nshe was safe. You know, they didn\u2019t make an issue out of her being a Jew. But they\ncame \u2014 she came to visit, sometime. I don\u2019t know how they found me, but there was",
        "Q: I was just going to say, yeah, they came to this \u2014 so she was your \u2014",
        "A: Here we go again with the underground. You know, underground was\nunderground.",
        "Q: Yeah, exactly. They didn\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: Did a good job.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right, yeah.",
        "A: And I remember as if it were yesterday. I had \u2014 I was still taking naps in the\nafternoon some, and Mom\u2019s getting me up, and there\u2019s this lady in this long cart \u2014\ncoat with the fur collar, and the hat with the feather, that came to us and \u2014 and\nvisited with us. And I\u2019m look \u2014 and we look out the window and she\u2019s \u2014 it looks\nNovember 10, 2008\nlike this big, black car 1s down there. Well, it probably wasn\u2019t, but you know, in a\nchild\u2019s eye.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: And that\u2019s when my life became a conspiracy of silence. I think that \u2014 you know,\nher children are grown, the youngest one was maybe 17 - 18. And so, an agreement\nmust have been made that Mom and Pop would keep me, cause they had a right to\ntake me.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: There were a lot \u2014 there were a lot of court issues about that 1n \u2014 in \u2014 in every\ncountry, I guess. But they probably came to an agreement that I would stay with\nthem, and perhaps never \u2014 nothing would ever be said. Nothing.",
        "Q: Did she \u2014 did she say that she\u2019s your aunt? Did she say \u2014 introduce herself? How\nwas she introduced to you? Or was she?",
        "A: Tante.",
        "Q: Tante.",
        "A: Another \u2014 another aunt and uncle. Look I told you, you have a lot of aunts and\nuncles that aren\u2019t. It\u2019s like the south has mizz and mister.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: We have aunts and uncles, you know, so they could be first cousins, you know,\nfor all \u2014 for all I knew.",
        "Q: Or they could be somebody who, they just liked \u2014",
        "A: Right, there\u2019s a neighbor down the street \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 you go and stay with Aunt Ann when you come from school, you know.",
        "Q: And yet, she stood out in your mind, because she was so well dressed, because\nshe was from a \u2014 a wealthier milieu.",
        "A: Yeah, I think that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s what \u2014 and we used to visit them regularly. In\nHolland kids don\u2019t go to school on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons. And to me\nit seemed like every other week we were getting on the train \u2014 tram after I came\nhome from school and go to Tante Sinke(ph) [indecipherable] and \u2014 and visit with\nthem, and stay until we had dinner, stay will \u2014 until it got dark and come home,\nyeah. And I think the 17 year old was probably the only one still living there. And\ncan you imagine a s-seven year old \u2014 six year, seven year old little girl following\naround a \u2014",

So I kept thinking, I was born in\n1940, why didn\u2019t they name me til 1942? Well, they did, it was in the records, but I\nwould have never known without that document.",

So, when I was 16, I became a naturalized citizen, and officially had a\nname change. The back of my naturalization papers say that this is a name change\nto Sonja Elizabeth van der Kaden from, legally I was still Clara van Tyne(ph).

        "A: Shifra. You know, I \u2014I-\u2014I think it\u2019s lovely, because in the Jewish tradition, had\nmy grandmothers been deceased, I would have automatically been named after her.\nBut Shifra in the Old Testament was one of the midwives that went against the\nrules when the \u2014 was it Herod, said kill all the little boys?

        "Q: Wow. Wow.",
        "A: Yeah, 46 years ago. My baby just turned 40, can you imagine?",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah, Elise(ph) turned 40 this year.",
        "Q: And how did your life change after that?",
        "A: Well, my own \u2014 my \u2014 my Clara, my Shifra life really was moved to the back\nburner. I had family [indecipherable] I had things to do. Thought about it, but had\nno time to do anything. I did one time follow up some through \u2014 through the mail.\nBut just like before when I used to ask Mom and Pop and got no answer, that would\nset me way back to try to do that again. So it \u2014",
        "Q: Did you share this?",
        "A: \u2014 took awhile.",
        "Q: Did you share these kinds of pains with anybody else, that you wanted to know\nmore and \u2014\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Ron. Ron knew.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That\u2019s \u2014 you know, he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s my friend as well as my\nhusband, he\u2019s \u2014",

        "Q: When did \u2014 when \u2014 it sounds like at some point there was a breakthrough, where\nyou found out more information, where you found out more. So let\u2019s bring that\nstory to that point. Can you tell us about that?",
        "A: Well, first we need to talk about 1987.",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s talk about \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s when I received a front page of a newspaper from Holland, from my\ngirlfriend Willy(ph) who I\u2019d been corresponding with all these years. It was a big\npicture of me with that doll carriage. And it had been all over the newspapers in\nHolland. Mr. Henkes had \u2014 had [indecipherable] saying, what happened to Clara?\nHe knew that I went to the States, but didn\u2019t know anything else. Was I happy, was\n\u2014 did I have a family? He was well into his 80s then, and his doctor suggested that,\nNovember 10, 2008\nyou know, bec \u2014 if he\u2019s mental about it, would he get an answer? And sure enough,\nI understand that he, in the follow up article that they have, it says the phone rang\noff the wall for days. And \u2014",
        "Q: You mean there were lots of Claras?",
        "A: No, lots of people who knew about me. Yeah, because van der Kaden\u2019s name\nwas in there.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And so Willy(ph) sent it to me, but other people sent these articles to Mom and\nPop, they didn\u2019t know my address, to pass on. Which, of course, didn\u2019t happen. But\nmy girlfriend Willy(ph) did. And at that time she said, you know, I\u2019ve known your\nsituation from since you were a little girl, but we were sworn to se \u2014 all of us \u2014\nwhoever that means \u2014 were sworn to secrecy, so we never said anything, but we\nthink \u2014 I think this is important enough for you to \u2014 for me to break that vow.",
        "Q: And her \u2014 and she broke the vo \u2014 in \u2014 in sending you that article, and in giving\nyou his name, that\u2019s the vow she was breaking?",
        "A: Right. And so it was within a year that I went to Holland. It happened to be our\n25'\" we-wedding anniversary, so I didn\u2019t need an excuse. But Pop knew. He said,\nyou know, you will never get to the bottom of this. And I don\u2019t know what that\nmeant, but 1t was part of their thinking, you know, the less you know, the better.\nNovember 10, 2008\nYou start digging, you\u2019re never gonna be satisfied. Which I am not, but I\u2019m more\nsatisfied than I was, you know. I always used to call it my other self. That\u2019s not my\nother self, it\u2019s me. It\u2019s also me.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So I went to see him, and Willy(ph) arranged that. And at that time his sister\ngave me a precious gift. It was a necklace, they were Jerusalem beads, like an\nevery day kind of necklace, not the precious jewels that \u2014 not the garnets I have.\nAnd she said, your mother took this from around her neck when she got on the train.\nWell, I can\u2019t even wear it any more, I\u2019m so scared it will break. I had a picture\ntaken over there, just red and black painted beads. And, you know, it is \u2014 it\u2019s just a\ntreasure.",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And what could he \u2014 what did he tell you? What gaps did he start filling in?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t ask.",
        "Q: What did you talk \u2014\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: I was under the cloud of do not ask. I was not there \u2014 and of course I could kick\nmyself, he died about four years later. I never \u2014 we had \u2014 was a very superficial\nvisit. He took me \u2014 my daughter Elise(ph) has a fit over this. He took me up to his\nstudio at \u2014 lined up three paintings, and said choose one. I turned him down. I did,\nhe\u2019s famous. Becau \u2014 I wasn\u2019t thinking. I didn't want to show up \u2014 they knew he\nwas \u2014 Mom and Pop knew he was a painter.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t want to look \u2014",
        "A: I was still cover \u2014 I was still covering. I didn\u2019t want to look like I had visited\nhim.",
        "Q: I see. You didn\u2019t want them to know that you had seen him.",
        "A: You know, I think of myself as pretty cowardly now when I \u2014 when I think back,\nand say \u2014",
        "Q: I wouldn\u2019t \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t call it cowardly. I\u2014 I'd call it like you had been put in\nchains, and you were \u2014 and you had been put in such invisible chains, and you were\ntrying to break free from them, but being invisible, you never know when they\u2019re\nlocked up again. I wouldn\u2019t blame yourself for that.",
        "A: Well, there is a lot that, you know, as I said, Aunt Alice is the only person I ever\nmet that knew Daddy. It turns out that Dolf Henkes and Daddy were close friends\nbecause they both painted.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t know that they were close friends at that time?",
        "A: Oh no, I didn\u2019t find that out until I \u2014 2002 I put it together. I'll get to that.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: All right, so I went back to Holland, and with no painting, but Willy(ph) and I\nthen had a more open communication, because I could ask her questions, she \u2014 she\ndid quite a bit of research for me initially then. Like, I didn't know who else died,\nand that all, you know, [indecipherable] opened up.",
        "Q: So she fu \u2014 so she did some of the research into the family?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Did she re-contact those maiden aunts? Did she talk to \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No. And it\u2019s mainly because it was \u2014 Daddy\u2019s side was more visible, and \u2014",
        "Q: Did he cli \u2014 but no \u2014 the Aunt S-Sinke(ph), what was her name, that you used to\nvisit?",
        "A: Well, she came \u2014 they came to live in the United States.",
        "Q: Oh, that\u2019s right, that\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry, I forgot about that part.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: But I never n \u2014 I could never tell her, or I never knew until after she died. So,\nyeah, all this is \u2014",
        "Q: So how do you take it forward? So you\u2019ve got \u2014 you\u2019re in Holland, you meet\nhim, but you don\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: You go home and you leave it on the back burner again, cause you\u2019re very busy\nand you have children to bring up, and this was an episode that you don\u2019t deal with,\nand I didn\u2019t deal with it until 2000. I had a \u2014",
        "Q: What happened then?",
        "A: Thad a telephone call \u2014 thank God for answering machines. We weren\u2019t home,\nsecond time we weren\u2019t home, third time was a charm. Telephone call said, my\nname is Bev, I think we may be cousins. One of those tremors went through me\nagain. And when we connected, yes we are cousins. She is the younger daughter of\nthe family that left in \u00b038. And of course she came over the following weekend and\nwe Sat up and talked, and \u2014",
        "Q: And did they live in New Jersey?",
        "A: They live in Israel.",
        "Q: They live in Israel?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: So how did you con \u2014\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: So the next year we went to Israel, and it was so funny. I see Jocelyn, whose oh,\nthat\u2019s the one who\u2019s been wearing my clothes. Because they used to \u2014 after the war,\nI got all these wonderful care packages, I was the best dressed kid in elementary\nschool because they used to send Jossy\u2019s(ph) outgrown, hardly worn dresses to\nSonja. And they used to hear, let\u2019s put this in the box for Sonja. Who\u2019s Sonja, you\nknow. But Mom was keeping in touch with them, they were writing letters back and\nforth. So the package comes and I\u2019m wearing these pretty clothes from my cousin.",
        "Q: And you never knew what \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And you never knew.",
        "A: Never knew it until, you know, until Bev tells me all \u2014 all this stuff that\u2019s going\non. And that her grandfather van Helger(ph) was our sponsor. And it\u2019s \u2014 1s it\nconfusing?",
        "Q: Well, it\u2019s perplexing.",
        "A: Okay, may \u2014",
        "Q: It\u2019s extraordinarily \u2014 no, no, no, not confusing as far as who was who \u2014",
        "A: Who fits where.",
        "Q: But it is perplexing in its intensity.",
        "A: It\u2019s a good job, and \u2014\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "Q: To keeping this from you, in the name of protecting you, and it certainly doesn\u2019t\nsound like that. I mean, I can only imagine \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 as I\u2019ve mentioned before, our\njob is to kind of be neutral and let you [indecipherable] talk \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 and \u2014 and so, but the feeling that I get is if it had been me, I would have been\nlivid to the sky that somebody \u2014",
        "A: Good girls don\u2019t get mad. They don\u2019t slam doors, they don\u2019t say anything rude.\nThey don\u2019t even go to their rooms to sulk.",
        "Q: When did Mom and Pop die?",
        "A: Mom died last August two years ago.",
        "Q: So, very recently?",
        "A: Yes. And Pop died about seven years before that. And I brought her to an\u2014a\nnursing home close to where we lived so I could go see her.",
        "Q: Be with her.",
        "A: Yeah. But it\u2019s something we could never talk about, and she went to her grave\nthinking that I didn\u2019t care about my birth family, because by the time 2000 - 2002\ncame around, she wasn\u2019t all that cognizant, so I didn\u2019t have to answer for my\nactions.",
        "Q: But it\u2019s all so \u2014 how could someone not know that that\u2019s important to you?\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. M-May \u2014 you know, early psychology didn\u2019t think that kids had \u2014\nyou know, when I\u2019ve been to the \u2014 the hidden children conference, and we all say\nthe same thing, we heard, oh, you were too young to know anything. So it didn\u2019t\nhappen? They didn\u2019t believe in the subconscious at the time.",
        "Q: Well, it sounds \u2014 even if you don\u2019t have memories of the time, you do have\nmemories of feeling different. And of hearing these voi \u2014 these conversations, over-\noverhearing them when you\u2019re walking down the street and they say to you, or you\nhear the grownups talking, did they come back, no they didn\u2019t come back. Or that\nyou\u2019re different at school. I mean, that\u2019s conscious. That\u2019s where questions could\nstart arising, and a child would want to know, why are these quest \u2014 why 1s this\nsituation there?",
        "A: Well, they were very \u2014 they were suppressed, yeah, very, very much.",
        "Q: When you \u2014 when you got that call from Bev, and she said I think we\u2019re cousins,\nto me it sounds like these \u2014 you know, the past has broken through, finally.",
        "A: Right. And it\u2019s amazing that she got my telephone number, cause she got it from\nMom. Now, Mom didn't know who was calling, I don\u2019t imagine, because that\u2019s\nwhen the yarn started to unwind. We went to Israel, and I spoke to Aunt Alice, her\nmother, who 1s the only person I\u2019ve spoken to who knew Daddy as a person.",
        "Q: So what did she tell you about him?\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Well, she used to tell me what they used to do, they used to go on bike trips\ntogether. And I \u2014 again, put a little piece of the puzzle together, rightly or wrongly,\nthey used to go to Seders together at Grandpa Abe\u2019s. You know, they had the\ncommon grandfather. And she said, we were so bored, we didn\u2019t understand a word\nthey were saying. Was a large family, we kids used to sit on the end. Well, he was\nconducting it in Hebrew. He wore a hat over his yarmulke. That also is either\nConservative \u2014 probably Conservative. So, makes you wonder how far did the apple\nfall from the tree? When Daddy picked Shifra as my name, did he just like it, or did\nhe know the Bible, the Old Testament? Did he attend Torah readings? You know,\nwas he part of a minyan? All those things that I don\u2019t think she would have known,\nbut the \u2014 but all the other people that crossed my path could have asked me\nquestions that I didn\u2019t know I had until I was too late.",
        "Q: It sounds like also, and forgive me, I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth, but\nyou had mentioned something about this before, is that you regained a part of who\nyou are. You talked before about having different selves. Is that what happened in\n2000? Is that some \u2014",
        "A: Oh definitely.",
        "Q: \u2014 moral you have integrated?\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: I allowed integration. There\u2019s not much of it. You know, every year or so I learn\nsome \u2014 I come to the hidden children conference, I might find another distant\ncousin. I did the last \u2014 two years ago.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: When we were in Detroit, and Elise(ph), our youngest daughter came \u2014 came\nwith me, I asked her to attend as a second generation. And she went to a workshop\nand explained why she as there, and she said, you know, this is \u2014 I\u2019m the daughter\nof \u2014 and she mentioned my name and the man in the corner there jumped out of a\nchair, ran up to her and said, oh, yeah, I have that name in my family, you know, a-\nand so, you know, he\u2019s another distant, distant cousin. But we see \u2014 we saw each\nother this weekend [indecipherable]",
        "Q: P\u2019ve come to the point in the interview where I ask, is there anything that we\nhaven\u2019t talked about that you think is important?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I\u2019m very intent on seeing that my grandchildren have a much smoother \u2014 become\nknowledgeable about the Holocaust through me, about the family, not necessarily\nthe horrors of the Holocaust, in a much more gradual and open way. And \u2014 and I\u2019ve\nNovember 10, 2008\nstarted that with my \u2014 our 16 year old granddaughter. Emily is doing a school\nproject where she\u2019s using \u2014",
        "Q: Your story.",
        "A: \u2014my story as an example, and I\u2019ve \u2014 Elise(ph) has been very active in getting\nme involved in the school system where she is. And the first time I spoke to class,\nwhere my eldest grandson is, those chills went through me again. And there I am\nspeaking to children. The kid who shouldn\u2019t be there and his younger brother Seth\nis the one I really \u2014 it suddenly happened. I used to go and take care of him while\nhis mom worked. I\u2019d see him every now and again. And even by the time he was\ntwo years old, he was such a clinger. He just loved his mommy and he \u2014 she used to\nhave to sneak out the door for me to take care of him. And I suddenly realized what\n\u2014 what a sacrifice that must have been. I didn\u2019t get it until I was a grandparent.\nWhat a sacrifice that must have been to turn your child and give \u2014 and give it life\nthat way. Cause [indecipherable] to that extent, but \u2014",
        "Q: But yes.",
        "A: \u2014 yeah, she tried to \u2014",
        "Q: She took it.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Yeah, but she took it. I mean, that\u2019s amazing. And so now, you know, I speak to\nschools not just to tell my story, but to say that everybody can take a stand, and they\nneed to take it for the good.",
        "Q: Did you talk \u2014 did you share with your daughters, as you were going through the\n[indecipherable] steps?",
        "A: [had Mom and Pop tell them. They knew nothing until they were about 10 and\n13 years old, and I said to Mom, giving them another opportunity to open up,\nactually, and it was pretty much the same way, a very \u2014 a snippet \u2014 you know, well,\nwe took care of your mommy, she\u2019s our daughter, during the war \u2014 her parents\ndidn\u2019t come back from concentration camp. That was about it. So when Elise(ph)\nand I went to Detroit and we went to the \u2014 to the Holocaust museum at the end of\nthe \u2014 the session, I went for a book. I said, I\u2019m gonna \u2014 will you be all right if I got\nthis for Riley(ph)? And she was \u2014 her oldest son \u2014 and she was rightly very\nconcerned, and said, you mean you\u2019re gonna hand him a book and tell him about his\nheritage? I said, oh no, this is to help me mature him into it. An \u2014 and I\u2019ve been to\nthe gift shop at the museum and I\u2019m continuing that with \u2014 as the children grow\nolder, so they can take pride in their \u2014",
        "Q: Yes, of course. I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m speechless. Thank you. Thank you very much. I think\nyou\u2019ve had such a tough row to hoe, because the shadows that you have were so\nNovember 10, 2008\ninvisible. You know, when you talk through the Holocaust, you know that there\u2019s a\nconcentration camp. You know that there\u2019s a horror. You know that there\u2019s \u2014 but all\nof these other things were invisible, to try and pull away those veils.",
        "A: You know, in th \u2014 and the Jewish community does not recognize that hidden\nchildren have this emotional invisible burden, that most of us are carrying for one\nreason or the other. If you don\u2019t have a number on your arm, you\u2019re in a different\nclassification. And I think that\u2019s probably going to change as the older folks, you\nknow, pass away, it\u2019s the hidden children that are going to carry on, and perhaps our\nchildren will carry on the tradition of \u2014 of teaching.",
        "Q: Well Shifra, thank you very, very much.",
        "A: Well, you\u2019re welcome. You were easy to talk to, thank you.",

They were \u2014 had been married in\n1939, and I was born in 1940, and their lives ended in 1942, and I was their only\nchild.",

        "A: \u2014 it\u2019s a dut \u2014 Dutch Jewish name, but I never knew what my name was until\nquite a few \u2014 few years later. To get to the en \u2014 to the initial part of the story, which\nwill \u2014 you will want to \u2014 will want to come back to, is in 1938, a cousin got out of\nThe Netherlands on the last ship, Hospel(ph). Her name \u2014 her \u2014 her new husband\nand her, and her baby girl, went to Australia, cause United States wasn\u2019t accepting\nany more refugees.

        "A: You know, I th \u2014 I think I might have been born right after their initial home was\nbombed.

        "A: \u2014 I presume.",
        "A: You know, all this I presume they develop with their mother, because I was 21\nmonths old when they were deported to Westerbork. And \u2014",
        "A: No, the day they got on the \u2014 on the train, on the transport to Westerbork, I was\nhanded over, they handed me over to a friend of theirs. And, you know, I will never\nknow if \u2014 1f this was a \u2014 of course it was agonizing \u2014 if it was a decision that they\nhad made prior to that, or if 1t was just because, as I heard it later, Daddy\u2019s friend\nsaid, you don\u2019t want to take this child with you. I sort of think of the earlier, you\nknow, that they had agonized over it and decided that they didn\u2019t really know where\nthey were going yet in \u201942, except, you know, you haven\u2019t worked in awhile, and\nthey promised people jobs, too, so \u2014\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Yes, yes, as a matter of fact, after the war, I have a few precious papers, and one\nof these was his dismissal letter, which was typed in 1941, just a paragraph. And it\nsaid that they were very sorry, due to circumstances, they had to let him go, but\nwould recommend him to anyone.

An earl \u2014 earliest memory that I have didn\u2019t flash in \u2014 see, my\nlife\u2019s floating puzzle pieces, didn't flash in until maybe a dozen years ago, when my\nhusband and I were in Saint Thomas and they have these little boats that go\nbetween hotels and port. And there was this \u2014 they look like little Thomas the train\ntrains. And I said to Ron, I said, I\u2019ve been on one of those before. And smells are\nalways the strongest memory for me. And I smell that I\u2019ve been on that boat before.\nWell, the person I was given to, after we went [indecipherable] and that was a\ntemporary situation, when Mom came to pick me up, she tells me, she went one\nway, like my tram probably, and came back another way, which was across the\nMass river, you know, not to be traced. And I remember sitting down on a little\nbench, smelling that smoke go over me, and oh, it\u2019s so strange that, you know,\nthings like that still happen. And put \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, they just \u2014 they\u2019re just little flashes.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Right, to Mr. Dolf Henkes, who became quite a well known artist in Europe.\nAnd that\u2019s an important connection, cause until like the 80s, I couldn\u2019t figure out\nwhy I was given to one person and not to another. He was a friend of Daddy\u2019s, and I\ndid find out later that they were both artists. Daddy\u2019s an art \u2014 was an artist.",

        "A: So, I was given to Mr. Henkes, he was a single man, always was, and had \u2014 took\nme home \u2014 well, first he took me to farm country, where a lot of kids were hidden,\nNovember 10, 2008\nbut he found \u2014 the conditions he\u2019d found were atrocious. It was behind a chicken\ncoup, there was a family there. And I think it was a mutual decision, they didn\u2019t\nwant me, cause I cried a lot, you know, I would have given them away.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I\u2019m probably missing my mommy. So he took me home, and then through the\nunderground, nobody\u2019 ll ever know where, who, what, because I\u2019ve tried to find out.\nJust within the last two years I was rejected to have them named as Righteous\nGentiles, cause we couldn\u2019t find \u2014 one of the reasons was we couldn\u2019t find enough\nwitnesses.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah, okay.",
        "A: Fine. Enough witnesses. So he took me home, Mom and Pop are \u2014 Mom came to\npick me up. And I think the reason my birthday was celebrated in August, nobody\nknew a thing about me, was that they got me in August, you know. I know when\nNovember 10, 2008\nMother and Daddy went to Westerbork, that was like the 27\" or something, July.\nFigure they futzed around a little bit, finally found somebody. So in August, it was,\nyou know, a new beginning for me. And they couldn\u2019t have children, so you know,\nI was an answer to their prayers as well.",

        "A: And they had always lived in Scheidam, which is a city right next to\nRotterdam. And he \u2014 he was active, Pop was active in the underground, and Mom\nused to volunteer the Red Cross, so it\u2019s \u2014 you know. I\u2019m sure they had \u2014",
        "A: No, they were \u2014 Mom was born in the same year, 1913, just like Mother and\nDaddy were, and Pop was maybe about five years older.",
        "A: So \u2014 but I didn\u2019t look like anybody, you know, when \u2014 it\u2019s amazing how many\npeople \u2014 it really did take a village to bring up this child, because they weren\u2019t the\nonly \u2014 you know, they took the biggest risk, but there was the pediatrician they\nfound to examine me, who guessed at my age. Yeah, August sounds good, you\nknow. Two years old, fine. You know, it\u2019s two or three months. There was the food\nstamp office that gave me a s\u2014 a stamp so I could eat.",
        "A: Yeah, I had food rations. Let\u2019s see, what else? Oh, there were people that Mom\nknew \u2014 oh, one friend of theirs was a policeman, and from an old coat of his, I got\nthis wonderful navy cape that she sewed. I must have look \u2014 you know, and it had a\nlining, I remember a plaid lining. So I must have, you know, worn. And the \u2014 the\nfirst picture I had was with a little knitted dress that was pulled \u2014 you know, it was\nwarm. Nobody else had anything either. So, they pull that thing on and started over,\nand made this pretty dress for this little girl.",
        "A: None. No, I had \u2014 you know, I was first child of my natural family and they\nnever had children either. So, as Mom used to call me when she aged, and could\nremember my name, she\u2019d say, oh, here comes my only one. So, you know, we all \u2014\nalways meant a lot to each other.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, yes. As a matter of fact, I wrote a story about this, because it keeps\nflashing in front of my eyes. And that is the first time I saw a parade, or I thought I\nsaw a parade. We u \u2014 we lived three different places during four years, by the way.",
        "A: No, I was with them all my life, but \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 you know, communication was much slower than it was \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 so when people in one end of town started making \u2014 posing questions that they\ncouldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t answer, we\u2019d just move across town. Well, you know, that\ndoesn\u2019t make any sense now, but it did then.",
        "A: So, the second place we lived was on the second floor, and in Holland you had\nthese little spy windows at \u2014 at the front of the window, so you could see who was\nat the front door. Well, I was not \u2014 never ne \u2014 knew why, I was never allowed near\nthe window anyhow. Strange rule, I thought, but \u2014\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Not allowed near the window. Well, what do you do when you\u2019re told you\u2019re not\n\u2014 told you\u2019re not allowed?",
        "A: Well, you go to the window.",
        "A: So, I don\u2019t know how old I was, but I know it was at dusk. It was a rainy \u2014 it was\nthat nasty rain they have in Holland, just kind of slithers down and co \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. And there is a \u2014 a parade of men, and I could count, I could count to 10, I\nthink. And there were five men across, and then a row back, and I don\u2019t know how\nmany there were. And they were \u2014 there was a drum in front of them, one drummer.\nAnd these people had strange costumes, to a child\u2019s eye. They were all kind of\nbrown and gray and black. But it wasn\u2019t a happy parade. Just kind of strange, but I\nthought it was a parade, because I had never seen a parade, probably. And some\nwore hats, and some that \u2014 I can remember the glistening of their hair, those that\nweren't \u2014 weren\u2019t wearing hats. They all had carried a roll of some sort, which later\non I figured out were blankets. Where we lived, just around the block was a train\nstation.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: And so, they were having their last walk in their city, because you know, when\nthey went to the train station and the door closed \u2014",
        "A: These were \u2014 these were men that were found, they\u2019re being deported. And of\ncourse, you know, I was being protected from whatever nasty was going on. I didn\u2019t\nknow it was nasty. I couldn\u2019t figure it out. Why would you have a parade on a rainy\nday, why didn't they cancel it? I knew that much. And there wasn\u2019t any happy\nmusic.",
        "A: Yeah, it was just a \u2014 a single drummer. And then of course, it was much later\nwhen I figured out that their fate was probably sealed when \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 they sealed the doors of the train.",
        "A: And \u2014 but, you know, Mom and Pop always, always worked hard at protecting\nme from \u2014 from my other life. I\u2014 my life kind of became a conspiracy of silence.\nThere is good and there is bad in that, I\u2019m afraid.",
        "A: No, I belonged to \u2014 they tried to make life as normal as possible for me. I\nremember going to a pre-school or kindergarten, or something like that.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh yeah. Pop was red haired, kind of bald already, and Mom was a dark blonde.\nSo \u2014 but there were questions all the time, and \u2014 and in another group of people who\n\u2014 who could have \u2014 who became part of the \u2014 the extended family were the teachers\nand the parents that used to pick the kids up. Where\u2019d this little girl come from?\nHow come, you know, she doesn\u2019t look like any of us? I have a picture, you know,\nclass picture, of me. I was short, I was sitting on the bench in the front row, and\nthere\u2019s like a row behind me and a teacher on each side. It\u2019s one redhead, all\ntowheads and me, you know, so you know, my hair is still black. And that had to be\nvery telling, and it was years, years, years later that my girlfriend Welly(ph), who I\nstill correspond with in Holland, told me, we were all sworn to silence. The reason\nwas given that it would just hurt me. It would, you know, upset me to know that I\ndidn\u2019t belong [indecipherable]. Well, of course, kids have that instinct where they\nknow that, or I did, anyhow. By the time I was about five years old I figured out\nthat \u2014\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s hard to tell. There again, snippets.",
        "A: The most obvious was that towards the end of the war, we used to \u2014 you know,\npeople walk there all the time. I used to walk around the city and meet\nacquaintances and friends. And I\u2019d be standing here holding [indecipherable], and\nthe conversation was always the same. Well, who have you heard from, did\nanybody come back? When \u2014 when\u2019s anybody coming back? That \u2014 and the answer\nwas always negative, no, we don\u2019t know. And I\u2019m standing right there. So\neventually I figure out, they\u2019re talking about Mother and Daddy. And \u2014",
        "A: \u2014I felt \u2014I felt \u2014 I felt \u2014 I think I felt cheated, cause nobody ever told me\nanything. I was spoken about \u2014 it\u2019s like, even when I was older, but I was never\nspoken to. I wasn\u2019t given the fact that I had an intelligence, that I had ears, you\nknow, that I could hear. People don\u2019t adopt kids that way, not that I was ever\nadopted, but they don\u2019t handle situations like that. Course, during the war they\ndidn\u2019t have much choice.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: At that point where we\u2019re putting things together, I knew. I wasn\u2019t told until six\nyears later.",

        "A: M-More.",

        "A: No, I didn\u2019t \u2014 you know, I didn\u2019t begin to ask until after to \u2014 they told me,\nbecause instinctively I think I knew it would hurt their feelings, or I wouldn\u2019t be a\ngood girl, and we were all trying to be very good, and you know.",

        "A: These \u2014 these people \u2014 you know, everybody in Holland was hungry, too. It was\nthe land of, you know, butter and milk and cows, and you know, the \u2014 the soldiers\nwere getting it all, you know, they had to keep the troops alive.",
        "A: There one \u2014 one day \u2014 one meal a day, a hot meal, was the meal of the day. I\nused to go \u2014 in Holland we have a lot of aunts and uncles, just everybody\u2019s an aunt\nand uncle. They found an aunt and uncle for me who gave me hot meal a day.\nNobody asked where they got the food, or you know, that type of thing. But I went\nto these folks, my little cape on. And it must have been just a couple of blocks,\ncause I went by myself. And \u2014",
        "A: Well, they were getting to the s \u2014 going to the soup kitchen and getting this, you\nknow, two slices of bread and this thin soup.",
        "A: Yeah, but that food was pretty yuk for a three year old.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: All right, yeah, yeah, 1t was \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 it wasn\u2019t nourishing. Couldn\u2019t get any milk. I have another story about how I\ngot milk. But, you know, to get a regular, substantial meal, I was told I was a little\nwaif already by the time I came to them. Which is likely because I wasn\u2019t getting\nenough to eat, you know, at Mother and \u2014 and Daddy\u2019s.",
        "A: No, no, they weren\u2019t.",
        "A: And, you know, it was sort of shady, I\u2019m sure, as to where they got their food.\nAnd \u2014 but I had a nice, hot meal, and it was so sweet. I would come home and I\nremember this distinctly, I don\u2019t know why it didn\u2019t \u2014 you know, some things just\ncome to me, and \u2014 and Pop would have the \u2014 they have these little tins, like I think\nprobably Laura Ingalls carried to her \u2014 to lunch for school.",
        "A: And the soup would be in there, and he would ask me if I was still hungry. And\nI\u2019m told that nine out of times \u2014 10 times, I ate it, you know.\nNovember 10, 2008",

They call them WCs and they were water closets, they really\nNovember 10, 2008\nare. And Mom and I, I\u2014 I do remember sitting there, not knowing why, being held\non her lap, and hearing these high pitched sounds, and those were, of course, the\nbombs, or the bombers flying near, or whatever.

And it was a \u2014 must have been summer, because I\nremember the cobbles \u2014 I had bare feet, and so it was at night and the cobblestones\nwere slick, but not ice cold \u2014 because Mom was carrying a \u2014 a pot of soup or\nsomething like that, and her \u2014 she said to the soldier that she had to go to\nkrankenhaus.",

And I remember, you\nknow, Mom and Pop being very upset about that. And he got a picture of me, and I\nknow the day it was passed to him. I don\u2019t know why I knew that. I was about four\nNovember 10, 2008\nyears old, and there\u2019s this picture of me holding a doll carriage. And one of the\nteachers handed something over the fence.

That was another thing that was confiscated besides bikes\nand radios, you know, also, they had to \u2014 had to give up their flags.

        "A: That\u2019s when I received a front page of a newspaper from Holland, from my\ngirlfriend Willy(ph) who I\u2019d been corresponding with all these years. It was a big\npicture of me with that doll carriage. And it had been all over the newspapers in\nHolland. Mr. Henkes had \u2014 had [indecipherable] saying, what happened to Clara?\nHe knew that I went to the States, but didn\u2019t know anything else. Was I happy, was\n\u2014 did I have a family?

And sure enough,\nI understand that he, in the follow up article that they have, it says the phone rang\noff the wall for days. And \u2014",
        "A: No, lots of people who knew about me. Yeah, because van der Kaden\u2019s name\nwas in there.",
        "A: And so Willy(ph) sent it to me, but other people sent these articles to Mom and\nPop, they didn\u2019t know my address, to pass on. Which, of course, didn\u2019t happen. But\nmy girlfriend Willy(ph) did. And at that time she said, you know, I\u2019ve known your\nsituation from since you were a little girl, but we were sworn to se \u2014 all of us \u2014\nwhoever that means \u2014 were sworn to secrecy, so we never said anything, but we\nthink \u2014 I think this is important enough for you to \u2014 for me to break that vow.",
        "A: Right. And so it was within a year that I went to Holland. It happened to be our\n25'\" we-wedding anniversary, so I didn\u2019t need an excuse. But Pop knew. He said,\nyou know, you will never get to the bottom of this. And I don\u2019t know what that\nmeant, but 1t was part of their thinking, you know, the less you know, the better.\nNovember 10, 2008\nYou start digging, you\u2019re never gonna be satisfied. Which I am not, but I\u2019m more\nsatisfied than I was, you know. I always used to call it my other self. That\u2019s not my\nother self, it\u2019s me. It\u2019s also me.",
        "A: So I went to see him, and Willy(ph) arranged that. And at that time his sister\ngave me a precious gift. It was a necklace, they were Jerusalem beads, like an\nevery day kind of necklace, not the precious jewels that \u2014 not the garnets I have.\nAnd she said, your mother took this from around her neck when she got on the train.\nWell, I can\u2019t even wear it any more, I\u2019m so scared it will break. I had a picture\ntaken over there, just red and black painted beads. And, you know, it is \u2014 it\u2019s just a\ntreasure.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t ask.",
        "A: I was under the cloud of do not ask. I was not there \u2014 and of course I could kick\nmyself, he died about four years later. I never \u2014 we had \u2014 was a very superficial\nvisit. He took me \u2014 my daughter Elise(ph) has a fit over this. He took me up to his\nstudio at \u2014 lined up three paintings, and said choose one. I turned him down. I did,\nhe\u2019s famous.

        "A: I was still cover \u2014 I was still covering. I didn\u2019t want to look like I had visited\nhim.",
        "A: You know, I think of myself as pretty cowardly now when I \u2014 when I think back,\nand say \u2014",
        "A: Well, there is a lot that, you know, as I said, Aunt Alice is the only person I ever\nmet that knew Daddy. It turns out that Dolf Henkes and Daddy were close friends\nbecause they both painted.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Oh no, I didn\u2019t find that out until I \u2014 2002 I put it together. I'll get to that.",
        "A: All right, so I went back to Holland, and with no painting, but Willy(ph) and I\nthen had a more open communication, because I could ask her questions, she \u2014 she\ndid quite a bit of research for me initially then. Like, I didn't know who else died,\nand that all, you know, [indecipherable] opened up.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. And it\u2019s mainly because it was \u2014 Daddy\u2019s side was more visible, and \u2014",
        "A: Well, she came \u2014 they came to live in the United States.",
        "A: Yeah.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: But I never n \u2014 I could never tell her, or I never knew until after she died. So,\nyeah, all this is \u2014",
        "A: You go home and you leave it on the back burner again, cause you\u2019re very busy\nand you have children to bring up, and this was an episode that you don\u2019t deal with,\nand I didn\u2019t deal with it until 2000. I had a \u2014",
        "A: Thad a telephone call \u2014 thank God for answering machines. We weren\u2019t home,\nsecond time we weren\u2019t home, third time was a charm. Telephone call said, my\nname is Bev, I think we may be cousins. One of those tremors went through me\nagain. And when we connected, yes we are cousins. She is the younger daughter of\nthe family that left in \u00b038. And of course she came over the following weekend and\nwe Sat up and talked, and \u2014",
        "A: They live in Israel.",
        "A: Right.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: So the next year we went to Israel, and it was so funny. I see Jocelyn, whose oh,\nthat\u2019s the one who\u2019s been wearing my clothes. Because they used to \u2014 after the war,\nI got all these wonderful care packages, I was the best dressed kid in elementary\nschool because they used to send Jossy\u2019s(ph) outgrown, hardly worn dresses to\nSonja. And they used to hear, let\u2019s put this in the box for Sonja. Who\u2019s Sonja, you\nknow. But Mom was keeping in touch with them, they were writing letters back and\nforth. So the package comes and I\u2019m wearing these pretty clothes from my cousin.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Never knew it until, you know, until Bev tells me all \u2014 all this stuff that\u2019s going\non. And that her grandfather van Helger(ph) was our sponsor. And it\u2019s \u2014 1s it\nconfusing?",
        "A: Okay, may \u2014",
        "A: Who fits where.",
        "A: It\u2019s a good job, and \u2014\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Good girls don\u2019t get mad. They don\u2019t slam doors, they don\u2019t say anything rude.\nThey don\u2019t even go to their rooms to sulk.",
        "A: Mom died last August two years ago.",
        "A: Yes. And Pop died about seven years before that. And I brought her to an\u2014a\nnursing home close to where we lived so I could go see her.",
        "A: Yeah. But it\u2019s something we could never talk about, and she went to her grave\nthinking that I didn\u2019t care about my birth family, because by the time 2000 - 2002\ncame around, she wasn\u2019t all that cognizant, so I didn\u2019t have to answer for my\nactions.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. M-May \u2014 you know, early psychology didn\u2019t think that kids had \u2014\nyou know, when I\u2019ve been to the \u2014 the hidden children conference, and we all say\nthe same thing, we heard, oh, you were too young to know anything. So it didn\u2019t\nhappen? They didn\u2019t believe in the subconscious at the time.",
        "A: Well, they were very \u2014 they were suppressed, yeah, very, very much.",
        "A: Right. And it\u2019s amazing that she got my telephone number, cause she got it from\nMom. Now, Mom didn't know who was calling, I don\u2019t imagine, because that\u2019s\nwhen the yarn started to unwind. We went to Israel, and I spoke to Aunt Alice, her\nmother, who 1s the only person I\u2019ve spoken to who knew Daddy as a person.",
        "A: Well, she used to tell me what they used to do, they used to go on bike trips\ntogether. And I \u2014 again, put a little piece of the puzzle together, rightly or wrongly,\nthey used to go to Seders together at Grandpa Abe\u2019s. You know, they had the\ncommon grandfather. And she said, we were so bored, we didn\u2019t understand a word\nthey were saying. Was a large family, we kids used to sit on the end. Well, he was\nconducting it in Hebrew. He wore a hat over his yarmulke. That also is either\nConservative \u2014 probably Conservative. So, makes you wonder how far did the apple\nfall from the tree? When Daddy picked Shifra as my name, did he just like it, or did\nhe know the Bible, the Old Testament? Did he attend Torah readings? You know,\nwas he part of a minyan? All those things that I don\u2019t think she would have known,\nbut the \u2014 but all the other people that crossed my path could have asked me\nquestions that I didn\u2019t know I had until I was too late.",
        "A: Oh definitely.\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: I allowed integration. There\u2019s not much of it. You know, every year or so I learn\nsome \u2014 I come to the hidden children conference, I might find another distant\ncousin. I did the last \u2014 two years ago.",
        "A: When we were in Detroit, and Elise(ph), our youngest daughter came \u2014 came\nwith me, I asked her to attend as a second generation. And she went to a workshop\nand explained why she as there, and she said, you know, this is \u2014 I\u2019m the daughter\nof \u2014 and she mentioned my name and the man in the corner there jumped out of a\nchair, ran up to her and said, oh, yeah, I have that name in my family, you know, a-\nand so, you know, he\u2019s another distant, distant cousin. But we see \u2014 we saw each\nother this weekend [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I\u2019m very intent on seeing that my grandchildren have a much smoother \u2014 become\nknowledgeable about the Holocaust through me, about the family, not necessarily\nthe horrors of the Holocaust, in a much more gradual and open way. And \u2014 and I\u2019ve\nNovember 10, 2008\nstarted that with my \u2014 our 16 year old granddaughter. Emily is doing a school\nproject where she\u2019s using \u2014",
        "A: \u2014my story as an example, and I\u2019ve \u2014 Elise(ph) has been very active in getting\nme involved in the school system where she is. And the first time I spoke to class,\nwhere my eldest grandson is, those chills went through me again. And there I am\nspeaking to children. The kid who shouldn\u2019t be there and his younger brother Seth\nis the one I really \u2014 it suddenly happened. I used to go and take care of him while\nhis mom worked. I\u2019d see him every now and again. And even by the time he was\ntwo years old, he was such a clinger. He just loved his mommy and he \u2014 she used to\nhave to sneak out the door for me to take care of him. And I suddenly realized what\n\u2014 what a sacrifice that must have been. I didn\u2019t get it until I was a grandparent.\nWhat a sacrifice that must have been to turn your child and give \u2014 and give it life\nthat way. Cause [indecipherable] to that extent, but \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 yeah, she tried to \u2014\nNovember 10, 2008",
        "A: Yeah, but she took it. I mean, that\u2019s amazing. And so now, you know, I speak to\nschools not just to tell my story, but to say that everybody can take a stand, and they\nneed to take it for the good.",
        "A: [had Mom and Pop tell them. They knew nothing until they were about 10 and\n13 years old, and I said to Mom, giving them another opportunity to open up,\nactually, and it was pretty much the same way, a very \u2014 a snippet \u2014 you know, well,\nwe took care of your mommy, she\u2019s our daughter, during the war \u2014 her parents\ndidn\u2019t come back from concentration camp. That was about it. So when Elise(ph)\nand I went to Detroit and we went to the \u2014 to the Holocaust museum at the end of\nthe \u2014 the session, I went for a book. I said, I\u2019m gonna \u2014 will you be all right if I got\nthis for Riley(ph)? And she was \u2014 her oldest son \u2014 and she was rightly very\nconcerned, and said, you mean you\u2019re gonna hand him a book and tell him about his\nheritage? I said, oh no, this is to help me mature him into it. An \u2014 and I\u2019ve been to\nthe gift shop at the museum and I\u2019m continuing that with \u2014 as the children grow\nolder, so they can take pride in their \u2014\nNovember 10, 2008\ninvisible. You know, when you talk through the Holocaust, you know that there\u2019s a\nconcentration camp. You know that there\u2019s a horror. You know that there\u2019s \u2014 but all\nof these other things were invisible, to try and pull away those veils.",
        "A: You know, in th \u2014 and the Jewish community does not recognize that hidden\nchildren have this emotional invisible burden, that most of us are carrying for one\nreason or the other. If you don\u2019t have a number on your arm, you\u2019re in a different\nclassification. And I think that\u2019s probably going to change as the older folks, you\nknow, pass away, it\u2019s the hidden children that are going to carry on, and perhaps our\nchildren will carry on the tradition of \u2014 of teaching.",
        "A: Well, you\u2019re welcome. You were easy to talk to, thank you.",
