        "Question: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.\nThis is an interview with Estelle Klipp, conducted by Regina Baier, on July 16\", 1999, in\nconducted with Estelle Klipp, on July second, 1995. The United States Holocaust\nMemorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this\ninterview possible. This is tape number one, side A. So I did mention your name already,\nbut it would be nice if you could give us one more time, your full name, and also say\nwhen you were born, and where.",
        "Answer: I\u2019m Estelle Klipp, born Estella Guitla Feingarten, in Lodz, Poland, in 1922. So I\nactually am, if you want to know, I am 77 and a half years young.",
        "Q: And we are both sitting on the floor here. That\u2019s nice. So, I should say that you\nsurvived the ghetto in Lodz. You were transported to Auschwitz, where you stayed for\njust a little while.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: Then you went to a camp -- a working ca -- a concentration working camp in --",
        "A: First --",
        "Q: -- in Germany?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And what was it called again?",
        "A: First I was in Hamburg, and then I was in Zazel.",
        "Q: Oh, Hamburg, and then Zazel, Germany for awhile.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And then you went to Bergen-Belsen death camp, in Germany\u201d?",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: And I would like to ask you, around the time -- and you were liberated from -- from\nBergen-Belsen?",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: Speak a little bit about the time just before liberation. What was it like for you, what\nstate of mind were you in? What was your -- your health at that time? Where were you?\nAnd then, when liberation happened, what was that like?",
        "A: Mm-hm. Actually, when the liberation happened, I didn\u2019t feel any ela-elation, because\nI was still in Bergen-Belsen. I was still lying on the floor of something which looked like\na very big barn. There were still mountains of skeletons around me, and the skeletons\nwere actually people, who were once human being. And then, also, you could see people\nwith diarrhea, with typhus, running aimlessly to the latrine and back. So, nothing\nchanged, in a way, and so what I did, I was lying on this floor. Somehow I got pencil and\npaper, and I did writing, and writing, and writing. I wish I kept those papers, but I didn\u2019t.\nAnyhow, we would --",
        "Q: How did it -- how did it happen though? You were in a barrack?",
        "A: Yeah, it was -- it -- I was in a barrack, and they were saying that the English army is\napproaching, and they -- we should not go to the gate too early, because we might be\nshot. So we -- but -- and they opened the gates, and -- and came in. Probably, when you\nhave been incarcerated for such a long time, you cannot switch. Anyhow, in my case,\nbesides that -- at that moment, actually -- maybe not exactly that moment, I realized that\nI'll never see my parents again, because there was no way for them to survive these\nhorrors. So, in a way, I started thinking about my family, and I started thinking about all\nthese people who perished, and this writing probably was a way to put my feelings into\npapers. Now, I was, all this time, in the -- actually, the ghetto too, but we didn\u2019t have\nmuch of a -- we didn\u2019t see each other quite often, but I was with my cousin, Ren\u00e9\nBerlinska. We met at the place where we were supposed to board the trains for\nAuschwitz, and we stayed -- we were in Auschwitz together, and we were in the camps\ntogether. And we survived together. So I actually, when they took us and -- from Zazel, I\nhad a feeling that we are going to a camp where we won\u2019t come out alive, so I jumped\nout of the train, but fortunately they did -- they picked me up, and I was expecting\nafterwards that I will be punished, but I wasn\u2019t. Probably, among this Nazi girls, there\nwas already awareness that the war is being lost. So, that -- not always stopped them, and\nPll tell you later, for instance, with my husband, who was -- who was liberated in Aren,\nclose to Hanover, the SS loaded them on a truck, and brought them someplace where they\nasked the Wehrmarkt to shoot them. However, the Wehrmarkt say, \u201cWe are soldiers, we\ndon\u2019t shoot people.\u201d And this way, 19 people were saved. Now we -- so we were moved\nto some quarters which -- my cousin believes they were army barracks, in Bergen-Belsen,\nand the -- we had a room, with eight other girls, and they were wonderful girls. We are --\nwe always have been friends with them. Now, I --",
        "Q: Was that after -- was that already liberation, or was that still before liberation\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: No, all what I\u2019m saying now, they -- the Germans wouldn\u2019t have moved us. They -- I\nmean, they wanted to finish us off, you know. But after the liberation, we have been\ntransferred, so probably the very sick ones were, I assume, transferred to some ar -- to\nsome -- something which was a hospital -- maybe a makeshift hospital, but a hospital.\nUnfortunately, in their goodness, the soldiers gave us food like chocolate, which we were\nnot able to digest. I probably -- I don\u2019t know why -- they did not consume any of this, and\nthey -- so it didn\u2019t affect me, but as tragic as it is, some people who already had\nproblems, got very, very sick.",
        "Q: Who liberated you though? We haven\u2019t said that yet.",
        "A: Yeah, woo -- I was liberated by the English army. And the -- so, I mean, as I said\nagain, they wanted to -- they knew that we are starving. Now, they realized it pretty fast,\nthat the food which we\u2019 ll be able to digest is a different food than -- then they fed us the\nright food. Now, when I was in this room with the girls, which -- it\u2019s amazing when I\nthink about it, it seems that they were actually very comfortable quarters, because in\ncomparison what was before, but my energy was coming back, and so I decided to go and\nget clothes, and I found out that there is some distribution point in Hamburg. So I went to\nHamburg, and when I came back, I had a beautiful blue outfit, and I had also a hat, and I\nalso brought some clothes for the girls with whom I was living.",
        "Q: How did you -- how did -- how were you able to go to -- to get to Hamburg?",
        "A: I think it was a train. You know, I tried to -- I tried to think about it, and in fact, when\nI came back, I was -- it was so impressive to some people, they -- there was a younger\nman who wanted to marry me right away, and the -- my resourcefulness was coming back\nto me. So I didn\u2019t -- I f -- I was fortunate in a way that one day when I looked out, I saw\nsomebody approaching, and who was it? It was the venerable Mr. Klipp, and I shouted\nout, \u201cPanya Klipp, Panya Klipp,\u201d\nPanya is mister in Polish, and here he was. He used to be the -- the boss of the food\nsupply in the ghetto. He was very respected, and he -- he was not only the head of the\noffice, but also the head of other departments, and -- however, I remember one thing,\nwhich we -- I shouldn\u2019t maybe say, that I had diarrhea. So I went to him, and wanted\nsome rice. And he somehow refused to give it to me. And what was happening, he was an\n-- he was an unusual person with in -- impeccable integrity, and so he was allowed to\nhave additional rations of food. He didn\u2019t accept that til his -- til his wife\u2019s sister -- no, it\nwas his own sister, his own sister, was sick. So, of course, I was very happy to see him,\nit\u2019s just like seeing somebody from the previous life, and he was -- he was liberated from\nCamp Arlen, as I mentioned before, and he was living in Hanover. I actually was hoping\nthat my brother Hershlite Feingarten, whom we called Lolec, survived. He was only one\nand a half year older than I, and he was extremely capable, and if he would have\nsurvived, he would have been a famous engineer, because as a child, he took apart our\ngrandfather\u2019s clock, and put it together, and since he was missing a part, he used a string,\nand that fa -- gar -- grandfather\u2019s clock was working. Now, I also was hoping that\nAroush, our adopted cousin, when he -- he was 1n the ghetto with his parents -- now, first\nhis father was departed, then his mother was deported, and then we did adopt him, and\nmy mother [indecipherable] from a skin disease, and my father got the skin disease, I\nmust have mentioned it on my other tape.",
        "Q: That was in the ghetto, I think.",
        "A: That was in the ghetto, right. Anyhow, he was, unfortunately -- okay, I never found\nmy brother, and I never found Aroush, but I found out that my brother was in\nBuchenwald, and people actually saw him very shortly before the liberation. However, I\nlooked for him, and I couldn\u2019t find him. Neither did I find Aroush. And Aroush -- I\nremember when Aroush was born, the joy, and the festivities were absolutely wonderful.\nWe were celebrating for a whole week, and the -- the whole family was just elated. Now\nwe -- I mentioned that Dave was in Hamburg when I was in my quest to look for Lolec\nand Aroush, I went to Hanover. In Hanover, I worked afterwards 1n a -- in a dep -- ina\nplace where a -- there was a representation of UNRRA, U-N-N-R -- I think they said W-\nA, which means United Nations relief, and we were distributing food. So I worked there\nfor a time, and there I had the honor to meet Mayor LaGuardia. He was working for\nUNRRA, and he was visiting the distribution centers, so I have a picture of him, and --\nand when we were talking to him, you could see in his expression the horror, and the\nunbelief in his face. He just stopped for awhile, and just looked really very, very\nunpleasantly impressed.",
        "Q: So, he had only limited information of what -- what had happened?",
        "A: Probably, because the -- I will show you the pictures, and you can see from his face\nthat he just couldn\u2019t believe it. I guess, judging from the words of Eisenhower, he says he\nhas to document it, because nobody, but nobody would believe it, what they did to so\nmany people. And the -- so, it is really very difficult to comprehend. Now, as the time\npasses by, to tell you the truth, it\u2019s much more for me to comprehend how all this was\npossible, and the -- in fact, it -- fortunately, I am very busy, but the pictures, let\u2019s say, of\nAuschwitz, they are always -- anyhow, quite frequently, very vividly in my mind. And\nnow, when I was making that tape, I didn\u2019t mention that a person whom I approach to ask\nfor my mother, going on my side of the line, which meant work, I didn\u2019t realize then that\nit meant life, 1t was Mengele, and the -- in my husband\u2019s ta -- tape, it\u2019s mentioned that it\nwas Mengele. Now, we are in Hanover.",
        "Q: Wh-Why was it -- why was it that you went in your search for your family to\nHanover, because there are -- were more resources to find -- wa --",
        "A: No, at that time -- at that time, we did not have a registry yet. You know, it was just by\ntalking to people, which I did, so I was told that they saw him, so my hopes were really\nup, but it -- all the search which I made, was 1n vain.",
        "Q: What -- what time was that now?",
        "A: That was still 1945, because we were liberated in -- I believe it was April. It was still\n19 fa -- it was very shortly after, I just started the search right -- right after. Now, in\nHanover, Dave, shortly after, I don\u2019t know the exact date, Dave realized that the refugees\nare just lost, and h-he contacted the German authorities to -- to organize some facilities\nwhere we can get food rations, where they -- we can get housing, when the -- when we\ncan get directions. And he was quite successful, thanks to his mastery of the German\nlanguage, he was -- til the last minish he was able to write a letter in German, really\nbeautifully, and without mistakes, I was always very impressed with it. And he also had a\nbusinessman\u2019s background. So, he organized that, and it functioned for quite awhile, and\nit was an enormous help. So, I was living -- you know, 1t was much nicer living in\nHanover. There were also many refugees there, many survivors, and they -- of course\nthere was Dave, who was only 17 years older than I was. However, with his energy, and\nhis equanimity, and his wonderful attitude towards people, chronologically there was a\ndifference, but in energy level, and in zest of life, we -- actually was none. So, we did get\nmarried, and we got married on March 16, 1946. Most of the survivors in Hanover were -\n- | would say, were at the wedding, and who officiated over that ceremony was an elderly\nman who was from German origin, and -- and he was really qualified to -- to conduct the\nceremony. And the -- I have, of course, pictures. I have the pictures of the other survivors\nwho attended the wedding. Now what -- of course, we wanted to -- to leave Germany,\nand the destination was very easy for us to decide, because Dave\u2019s -- Dave knew that he\nhas a sister in New York, but Dave was liberated by the Americans, and one of the\nAmerican army personnel promised him to get in touch with his sister, which he did, and\nwe started even receiving letters from her, and of course our destination, because of that,\nwas to go and join his sister, her husband, and they had a -- a son who was going to\ncollege, studying accounting.",
        "Q: Can I ask you two -- two -- two question? What was -- what were the conditions in\nGermany at that time, in -- in Hanover?",
        "A: In the beginning -- now, we -- we actually did not expect much, considering our past.\nNow we were giving food through the UNRRA, then, of course, is a -- many people were\nliving on Oberstrasser. Oberstrasser was the seat of -- before the war, that was the\nYiddish geminda, which means like stat the council -- the council of the -- and, so --",
        "Q: The consulate?",
        "A: No, n-not the consulate, the council. Stat --",
        "Q: The council, right.",
        "A: The council.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And the -- so it was the Yiddish geminda, and the -- well, these quarters were\navailable to the refugees. And then once these facilities were establish, which my\nhusband was happy to establish, then we also were able to get housing with some German\nfamilies. And we also were able to get food rations, and the -- so life became more\nlivable.",
        "Q: Was it difficult though, to live with German people, so shortly after --",
        "A: See, that is a very interesting question. We didn\u2019t want to stay in Germany, because\nwe didn\u2019t know who, of the people in Germany, was instrumental in this horrors.\nHowever, the German people have a way of being very hospitable. And you would never\nbelieve that this people were able to do what they did, or being bystanders, and not relac -\n- react. So1--",
        "Q: So, they were quite nice to you then?",
        "A: Oh, some, some. But we never knew when we spoke to them, or have been with them,\nwhat their background is. So, of course, most of the people -- for instance there was Pater\nDana, who was a German, and became a great friend of my husband\u2019s, and he -- and\nthere were other people who became friends of my husband. I mean, he -- David Klipp\nhad a fantastic personality, and just -- people just loved him. Everybody who -- whom he\ntouched, loved him and respected him. So, there were some German people who -- who\neven used to come later on, when we had a better living he -- headquarters that they are --\nactually came to our house. Now to -- to answer your question, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s why never\noccurred to ask to stay in Germany. And in -- where are we actually? We are -- okay, so\nDave is -- was working, he was very busy in the place, and --",
        "Q: What did you -- what did you do?",
        "A: I was also busy, I was working from yo -- in the other place, and also in the -- our first\nchild, Philip Klipp was born in 19 four -- wait a second, we bus -- he was born in 1947,\noh yeah, that\u2019s right, 1947, June eight. And that was absolutely the greatest joy, because\nit was, in a way, a miracle, because we were suspecting that we were getting something\nin the food which will prevent us from being able to bear children.",
        "Q: In Auschwitz?",
        "A: Yeah, is -- 1-1n the Auschwitz, or maybe -- probably it would have been in Auschwitz.\nS-So we -- now, about the -- we wanted to, of course, emigrate. Now, I used to have in\nthe ghetto, I had pleurisy, which is water -- water on the lungs, and when I went to\nAuschwitz, actually, I had still water on the lungs, I had swollen legs, and I had a blood\ninfection. And, believe it or not, that after we spent the first night in Auschwitz on the\nground, I awoke and I didn\u2019t have the blood infection. I still have the -- had the swollen\nlegs, which was a big handicap when we were in Hamburg, and I had to climb up on the\nwagon which took us to work. The girls had to help me, and the pleurisy also lasted\nawhile. Now, what actually helped -- I moved, did I disturb anything?",
        "Q: That\u2019s fine, don\u2019t worry about it.",
        "A: From Auschwitz, we went to Hamburg, it\u2019s in my tapes, and then from Hamburg, we\nwent to Zazel. Zazel was not far from Hamburg, but it was located in woods. Somehow,\nbeing able to breathe the good air, to which I am very, very sensitive, helped me to get\nover the pleurisy, and also my swelling of my legs disappeared. Now, I have to add,\nwhich is also in my tape, that I was fortunate, I spoke to the doctor who was taking care\nof the health problem of the soo -- of the people in the camp. She was from\nCzechoslovakia if I am not mistaken, and I mentioned to her my qualifications, and that I\nfinished high school, and had my graduation papers, and what my background is, that I\ncould be helpful to her, and she accepted that, and for awhile I was working there, and I\nwas, of course, cleaning and washing the floor from the wrong end. And when the people\ncoming from the camp, I was interviewing either na -- interviewing them, helping the\ndoctor, and keeping the books. Eventually I did -- I did go to work outside, and we were\nbuilding -- we were digging foundations for -- for some buildings. Now, maybe here I\nwill inject something why I survived. Now, if anybody in my family would have been\nasked who is the least likely to survive, I would be the first candidate. But --",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Why? I used to be -- I use s -- I -- I didn\u2019t eat. I actually didn\u2019t eat. I was giving my --\nmy lunch to a beggar, I had my own beggar. I didn\u2019t eat any breakfast. I had some dinner,\nand my mother was very concerned. She used to come to school sometimes when I was a\ns-smaller, and -- to feed me. That could have also helped me to survive, because I wasn\u2019t\nas hungry, and my body did not demand as much food as other -- I -- was demanding\nfrom other people, who had a good diet. Also, I -- it is -- it was a face, it was the spirit. I\nbelieved that we will survive. And on this way going back to -- to this camp in Zazel,\nwhere we were once marching back from work to -- to the camp, we saw houses, lit, with\npeople living their normal life. Usually they kept us away from the population, and my\ncousin asked me, \u201cWill we ever live like that?\u201d And I said, \u201cRania, I am sure we will.\u201d",
        "Q: I\u2019m -- I\u2019m sorry. We have to change the cassette.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: This is the end of tape one, side A, interview with Estelle Klipp. But we will pick up\non that.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation -- well, this was a car coming by, but this is a continuation of a\nUnited States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Estelle Klipp. This is tape\nnumber one, side B. And we have been just interrupted in speaking about why you think\nyou have survived, that had in part to do with not needing as much food as -- as -- as\nothers, but also with a certain kind of spirit, probably.",
        "A: Somehow, even in the ghetto, the mother of Aroush, which I mentioned before, we\nwere not really doing a lot of visiting, there was no time for that, and there was -- it\nwasn\u2019t an atmosphere where you just go visiting. But whenever I came to her house, she\nwas so happy, because I was full of hope. When I went to the krippo -- it\u2019s kriminalpoisi,\nwhere many people didn\u2019t come out alive, I went in, I remember. My mother was there\nalready, my father was there already, and my brother was there already. But when I\nwalked in and there was Souter, who was the head of the ghetto -- of the kriminalpoisi,\nsorry -- I left. I was laughing. And he says, \u201cDas laken vilderkil hafher gaya.\u201d And I\nreally did. However, there was something about it -- also, when in the -- still in Lodz,\nafter the nateez -- Nazis came to Lodz, which they named Litzmanshtadt afterwards, we\nwere supposed to wear a yellow star, and I had a girlfriend, Gernia Finkelstein from\nschool, and she didn\u2019t want to go out. I said, \u201cGernia, look. We have nothing to be\nashamed of. Let the people who do it to us, let them be ashamed of it.\u201d I somehow -- I\nwas also praying. I usually pray in my own words, and as a child, I used to get up in bed -\n- well, I figured that I shouldn\u2019t do it in lying position, and I prayed. And I remember in\nHamburg, where we were in that camp in Hamburg, we had to get up very early, the stars\nwere still on the firmament, and I looked at the stars. We had to line up so that we were\nchosen to go to work, and where to go to work, and I was standing there, and looking at\nthe heavens, and I was praying for myself, for my mother, my father, and my whole\nfamily. And now, it\u2019s likely that prayer 1s very powerful, and it influences the body. So\nthat was -- my spirituality was also a reason, probably, which helped me to survive. Also,\nonce, when I was in Camp Zazel, I brought some food from the place where we were\nworking, and when I came back, I was being punished. And the punishment was that I\nwas supposed to clean the latrines. And somehow, as -- in my recollection, I didn\u2019t mind\nit a bit. Probably I was happy that I didn\u2019t get a much, much more severe punishment. So,\n1-1t -- it was the spirit, also I never, during the whole ordeal, felt inferior. I always felt that\nthey are doing it to us, but that we are not inferior. I -- maybe should we talk now a little\nbit about anti-Semitism, or that\u2019s not -- I\u2019m actually very tolerant. I feel that different\nexpressions of religion, art, language -- are actually very beneficial to the culture of a\ncountry. And teeb -- you f -- you sometimes find people saying that Jews cause anti-\nSemitism. I -- but even among Jews you sometimes hear such a statement. It\u2019s the -- in\nmy mind, it is definitely, but definitely not the truth. Anti-Semitism is caused by other\npeople. Now, it is in the human nature that it\u2019s easy to blame somebody, and it makes it\neasier to handle certain things, and sometimes even governments, in order to put the\nblame, either for some economical disasters or shortcomings, or other shortcomings,\nneeded somebody to blame, and someone who is not protected, or whose rights can be\ntaken away at will, is a -- is a scapegoat. Because, when we look actually at what the\nJewish people contribute to the countries where they were living, they s -- I would say\nthat there is a reason to be anti-Semitic. Also, which 1s quite interesting, there is now\nanti-Semitism in countries where there are no Jews. In Poland, there are actually no Jews\nto be talked about, and they are very anti-Semitic, in spite of Pol -- of the Pope\u2019s powel --\nefforts to change it. So, you -- we talk about the state of Israel, which historically, and\nwhen you look at the archaeology, and when you read the history, it is as -- 1t is the land\nof the Jews. And only having a place where we will be protected, and there will be an\naction if there is anti-Semitism in whatever form, which has been before, like pogroms,\nlike Auschwitz, then there is somebody, we are not unprotected. And by the same token,\nwe might not be so -- such easy targets. And besides that, there's the only place in the\nworld where there is a law of rittem, and people can actually, if they are Jewish -- some\nwho are not Jewish also, can come in, whether it is from Ethiopia, which used to be\nAbyssinia. Whether it is from Iran, whether it 1s from an-any country where -- where the\nconditions are fertile for anti-Semitism, there is a place to go. A-Also, I mean, of course,\nit\u2019s not only si -- some people wish to go there for other reasons, of course the gates are\nalso open.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s -- let\u2019s talk about that a little bit later. I would like to go back to Hanover one\nmore time before we [indecipherable |",
        "A: Yes?",
        "Q: And there are two sort of private questions, if you will. Was it helpful -- was it easier\nfor you to have a survivor as a partner at that time?",
        "A: Definitely. Def -- I mean, the question 1s whether it was easier for me to have a\npartner, a survivor. There are two things. Definitely, because people have so much in\ncommon. I mean, we were -- our make-up was not exactly the same. He was very much a\nextrovert. I am partially extrovert, but partially a introvert. However, having the\nbackground, we could understand what\u2019s happening in our life. We could understand how\nwe think. And actually, many, many -- I would say, the majority of survivors married\neither survivors, or people who were in Russia, and came back, and I have one friend\nwho married a survivor, but unfortunately he passed away, Simaja, and afterwards, she\nmarried American man, a teacher. Now everything is working out fine, so it might have\nworked -- and I know some other people who married not a survivor and it 1s working out\nalright, but I feel -- I feel so much con -- so much more connected. And then I\nremembered Mr. Klipp from the ghetto, he was my boss there, and when I was in -- and\nwhen my mother was in Krippo, he one time was helpful that we got a little bit more\nfood. And besides that, he was a wonderful man, a man of integrity, a man of energy, a\nman of -- unusual man who, as I mentioned before, anybody whom he touched, or who\ntouched him, loved him and respected. So he actually -- when I think abou -- about my\naccomplishments, one of the -- I feel the greatest accomplishment was to keep him\nhealthy. So, he was not -- he -- you couldn\u2019t call him a man who is of poor health,\nhowever, he was very sick in Germany, he had appendectomy. Later he had the phlebitis,\nand then he had the emboli. But he survived. Then, in the United States -- maybe I'll\ncome to that later.",
        "Q: Yeah, let\u2019s wait a little bit, because I have a -- another question with regard to your\nfamily. What kind of hopes and -- and wishes, and plans did you have for your children?\nYou wanted children, you -- you had a boy.",
        "A: Two, two.",
        "Q: In -- in -- in \u00b047, you had one.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So what was -- what was that like? What --",
        "A: Okay. To answer your question what I s -- want for my children. In the Jewish\ntradition, anyhow the tradition in Poland before the war, which I remember, the most\nimportant things was education. You could hear us saying, they can take everything away\nfrom you, but they cannot take away your education. And this really became true,\nbecause even in my case, whatever I learned, I could keep, all else was taken away. So of\ncourse, I guess the tradition is quite a long tradition, because even before children in the r\n-- | mean, many years ago, when there were no public schools for -- available, a child\nwho was three years old, a Jewish child, was going to hadahadel, and he had to learn\nHebrew letters, and -- s-so there was education even at the times when other schools were\nnot available. And [indecipherable] really like to learn more about the Torah, about the\nMishnah, about the other books, because there must be a certain wisdom in it, because\nthere was one survivor, he survived in Italy, a Dr. Noyhaus, who told us that when he was\nin the -- he was on Aryan papers, that when he s -- when he went to the university, what\nhe learned from these books was very helpful, even the medical aspects of that\nknowledge were very helpful. So we -- the question which I am answering now, 1s?",
        "Q: Oh, what -- what plans and hopes you had for [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, so the -- the -- the most important, the priority was that they should be educated,\nand my sons, both sons, are well educated. They have Masters degree. Philip was a very\ngood student in college. In Fairfax High a very -- a -- a -- high school was very famous\n[indecipherable] camp is one of them. And he was so bright, that in the last year of col --\nof high school, he was chosen to attend UCLA. So he attended each simultaneously. He\nwas also very interested in linguistic, so he switched to computers later on, and he got\nhim Masters in the Boise University. Now, my younger son, Charles Klipp, who was\nborn in 1951, on my birthday, he was also -- we were very lucky, he was also very bright,\nand a very good student, and learning came to him [indecipherable] extremely easy,\nwhich he was very much envied by other students who had to study hard. He also got his\nMasters in business administration. And so they both have very good education. They\nalso had violin lessons, and Charlie was playing as a -- in junior high he was playing in\nthe Madame Bloom Orchestra. And we had the good fortune that this orchestra and\nCharlie playing the violin, was playing at the opening of the music center in Los Angeles\na day before Christmas, and of course, all our friends, and our family, went to listen to it.\nI was very much interested, and I was with anticipation looking to opening of the music\ncenter there in Los Angeles.",
        "Q: So we are already in America now, but let\u2019s [indecipherable]",
        "A: But we have to go back.",
        "Q: -- we have to -- we have to -- we have to go back --",
        "A: We have to --",
        "Q: -- to come here again. So when your s -- your second son was born already in\nAmerica, 1951.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So when did it finally happen, when could you go to America, and how did you go?",
        "A: Okay. What -- now, in order to get to America, we had to go to a medical\nexamination, and they were especially concerned that we should not have tuberculosis,\nwhich I can understand, and since I had pleurisy in ghetto, and later also in the camp,\nthere is a scar, which mimics actually a scar of the tuberculosis. So it took many, many\nexam -- medical examination t -- til they decided that it\u2019s not anything which should\nprevent me of getting a permit to go to the United States. And this happened 1 -- the\npermit we received in 1950. And we went to New York with the ship, Captain Macrae,\nand --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: I moved, sorry.",
        "Q: Oh, you have a picture, you have a photograph.",
        "A: I have a picture what I wanted to show to Regina. Also, my husband, sh -- who was\nvery organized, wrote that we left Bremenhaven on April the 12\", and we arrived in\nHalifax on April the 21\u2018', and then we arrived in New York, on April 24\". We also wrote\nwho of the survivors were on our ship, but I don\u2019t know whether I should mention that.\nShould I mention?",
        "Q: If you want to, yes. [indecipherable] be nice.",
        "A: Yeah, there was -- you know, down, it was Mr. Berstin -- Sander Berstin, Abram\nHoover, Aaron Dunst, D-u-n-s-t, Samuel Showser, Shlama Zife, and Mort Kazai. This\ntime, they didn\u2019t seem to have been married, or maybe he just mentioned the men, I don\u2019t\nknow. And we arrived in New York, and the -- our brother-in-law Simon was waiting for\nus, and he fell in love with Philip. Philip had beautiful, blonde, curly hair. And the -- they\nbrought us to their house, and they were very, very hospitable. They gave us their ba -- be\n-- bedroom, and all the family, mostly of course, the family of Simon, because Helen\u2019s --\nHelen, who was the sister of my husband, lost all her family in Europe during the\nHolocaust. And so Simon\u2019s family came over, and they\u2019re very friendly, and made us feel\ngood, and I heard some comments that, \u201cHow is it that Dave has such a beautiful, young\nwife?\u201d Of course, if they would know Dave better, they would not be so surprised. And\nnow, New York has the advantage that we have family there, however, since Dave was\nso sick, which I mentioned, in Germany, the climate affected his health, and he wasn\u2019t\nfeeling well. In the meantime, we received letters from Los Angeles, from people who\nsurvived, and telling us about the wonderful climate, and the wonderful possibilities.\nNow, the decision wasn\u2019t easy, but we hoped that Helen and her family will follow us.\nSo, remember, it wasn\u2019t a easy decision, as I mentioned before, but we decided to go.\nNow Helen was afraid of planes, so we took the train, and on our -- on our way to arrive\nin the unite -- to arrive in Los Angeles. Now, I learned some English in Germany, which\nwas very fortunate, and I thought I knew more than I really knew, but it was really\nhelpful to get through on the train, and arrived here. I --",
        "Q: Okay. I would like to stop for just one second.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: Okay, we are going again. I just wanted to ask you whether, at this point, there was\nanything that you had noticed about America, or that you had seen on the train, for\ninstance, that was different, and -- or interesting, or even disturbing. Did you --",
        "A: No, I actually -- I enjoyed the train ride. I enjoyed being alive. I really enjoy. As much\nas the moment I was liberated, I didn\u2019t feel any elation, later on, I was -- I had some\nelation. I was happy that I am alive. And I remember that once, walking someplace, and I\nsaid -- and looking at the sky, and seeing all the beauty of nature, I was really happy to be\nalive. S -- and the -- some people felt guilty -- that -- I heard that saying, I never met\nsomebody who really -- from whom I heard it. They felt -- they felt guilty that they\nsurvived. But, because we survive, we bear witness. Because we survive, there is a\ncontinuation of -- of the people who lost their lives. Because we survive, we have\nchildren, we have grandchildren, we have a second generation who already 1s a little bit\nactive in trying to remember what happens. And the memory is important for two\nreasons. Once, we owe it to the people who perished, and then, it is quite a lesson for\nhistory, which hopefully, hopefully, will be taken in consideration. What can happen --\nwhat actually can happen when the rights are being taken away, and how important\ndemocratic governments are, and how important that people can have their say. That\nthere is a difference of opinion that\u2019s fine, and hopefully -- so, that\u2019s why it\u2019s good that a\n-- we Survive. If we wouldn\u2019t sur-survive, it -- if it would happen, what Hitler planned,\nthe Final Solution, they would have murdered us all. And even today there are the deniers\nof the Holocaust, which seem to -- they be -- are becoming a little bit quieter. Imagine if\nwe wouldn\u2019t survive.",
        "Q: So, when you arrived in Los Angeles, what was that --",
        "A: Okay, so I -- I -- oh, we arrived in Los Angeles, and the weather was good, and the --\nour family was expecting us. So, it was really -- it was different, it was different. Now,\nwe didn\u2019t have a place to live, really. I mean, we li -- we were living with our -- were --\nmy sister-in-law, and we got along splendidly, and also with my brother-in-law.\nHowever, because they didn\u2019t feel good, we thought not to start our life in New York,\nsince it affected his health, that we should go to Los Angeles, and it was a good idea. We\nonly regret that Helen and Simon, and their son Arnold did not follow us, though they did\ncome to visit, and they liked Los Angeles very much. And so we are --",
        "Q: So how -- how did you establish a life then? So you -- you lived with your sister-in-\nlaw?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: For awhile? And then what -- did you follow education, did you --",
        "A: No, we were not there very long, we were only three weeks. All -- all we were there\nwas three weeks.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So -- because we had to make the decision fast la -- because you know, you have to\nmake a living. You have to make a living. So we came to Los Angeles. And we were\npicked up at the station, and then we stayed by cousin Ren\u00e9, whom I mentioned before,\nwas here living already with her husband, and she was going to school to learn\naccounting, and we stayed with them for awhile, and also there was that Siteling family\nwho -- who were very hospitable to us, and everybody, of course, adored Phil. And then\nwe started looking for a place to live, and we found it, we found the right place in of\ncourse, in Bull Heights, where most of the survivors lived, and we found a lovely place,\nand the school was across the street, and the semi-free medical facilities were down the\nstreet, it was Breed Street. And the elementary school was across the street. So -- and --\nand I could see the sky, which I -- I wa -- we -- I was ela -- elated, and it was a very good\nmove. Now, Dave, before the war, in about \u201832, he started a business, and he was very\nsuccessful, that was in Lodz. And then he was -- then the war broke out, of course, and\nthey took everything away, and he was also ready [indecipherable] it in a way, very\nrespected in -- even in Germany. And all the survivors didn\u2019t called him by his first\nname, they usually said, Panya Klipp. And -- because they respected him so much. And\nwe came here, and he worked in the warehouse, and on the weekend he was selling\nshoes. And he never, but never complained. And s -- now, we lived there, and we had --\nwe were very fortunate, we had Mexican-American neighbors on one side, and the\nchildren were watching television there, we didn\u2019t have a tel -- TV, and they was really\nhelpful. One time, the father of this couple, who didn\u2019t speak -- I don\u2019t know how we\ncommunicated. Anyhow, he took me with the car -- I didn\u2019t drive, I didn\u2019t have a car.\nAnd he took me to see the doctor, which was living on f -- which was -- had his office\nmoved to Fairfax approximately. And it was so natural to do it, but people in this doctor\u2019s\noffice were really surprised. And then, on the other --",
        "Q: Why were they surprised?",
        "A: They were surprised that he would take me all the way, and wait for me, and take me\nback. They were really surprised. I mean, we were so used to, because our friends, you\nknow, who were also survivors, we were always ready to help one another. So then the --\non the other side, the family moved in, also with children, the Gailses, and they were\nsurvive -- they were actually sur-survivors, but they survived in England. And -- so our --\nwe also became friends, and exchanged babysitting. And they -- this girls were appro --\nthis girls and our boys played together, and then we become very friendly with the Lazar\nfamily, whose daughters were also the same age as Philip and Charlie, and this was really\nour extended family, and we used to visit one another on a weekend, and when Sofie had\nsurgery, the girls stayed with us, and we loved it, and they were so thankful for it, but it\nwas really a privilege of ours.",
        "Q: Okay. I think this would be a good time to stop again. This is the end of tape one, side\nB, interview with Estelle Klipp.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nEstelle Klipp. This is tape number two, side A. So, you had a -- a nice support system of -\n- of friends here in the city, and your husband had work, and you were bringing up\nchildren. Did -- di-did you speak to -- to non-Jewish Americans about your experience at\nall? Did they want to know, or was there not a sensitivity to it, or is 1t something that you\ndidn\u2019t talk about?",
        "A: Okay. Now, I failed to mention that in Bull Heights, we lived together in the same\nlittle house with Basha and Max Birnbaum, other survivors. It was really nice, because\nwhen they went to school in the evening, and we prepared something, and they came\nback, and they had refreshments, and it was so -- Max couldn\u2019t stand much noise,\nhowever, we got along splendidly, and it was lovely. And I remember when I -- Basha\nwas sitting on the stairs, on the day I -- I was supposed to go to the hospital because I had\nCaesarian with Charlie, first I took Philip to this medical facility for a check-up. And she\nsaid -- and she just was so -- s -- she was really very surprised that I could do that, and\nthen go to the hospital. And the -- who took me to the hospital was Jerry Sitelin, who\nlives in Los Angeles, and whose family was instrumental in convincing us to come to Los\nAngeles, and he was going to drive me. He was also a survivor from the same camp as\nmy -- as my husband. And here his father\u2019s -- he and his father were in the camp, and he\nwas young, he was one of the youngest one. So he was to -- going to the army, and he\nbrought me to the hospital to give birth to Charles.\nNow --",
        "Q: Do you know whether it was difficult for him to go to the army? I mean, he just\nsurvived a war, and now he had to go to the army, did you talk about that?",
        "A: I talked to him a few days ago, and he was telling me about it. And he took it as a\nmatter of fact. I mean, he did not -- he actually did not complain, or anything. He was\nfortunate, they sent him to Germany, and he\u2019s -- Germany\u2019s really good, because he was\nthere for awhile. And he -- a marvelous son. He was such a devoted son, I think his father\nsurvives thanks -- thanks to him, and he survives thanks to his father, because he has a\ngoal, to keep his father alive. I think that -- that\u2019s also -- was helpful, you -- we have a\ngoal, and then we can take much more.",
        "Q: I did ask you, however, did you speak about your war time experience to -- to non-\nsurvivors, to [indecipherable]",
        "A: Okay, at that time, 1t was not the thing to do. It\u2019s very interesting the progression of\nwhen talking about the Holocaust became proper. There was here a family o -- which, she\nwas a survivor, and he married Eva, a lovely woman, and she was so nice to us. She took\nus -- she was an American. She took us out to Knottsberry Farm, and of course paid for\nit, and took us places, and invited us to her beautiful house, and -- but I don\u2019t think that\nwe really talked about it. It was too grim, it was too -- 1-1-1t was bel -- beyond belief, and\npeople were not ready to talk, and people were not even more, ready to listen. They also\nwent through a war where they, you know, where they\u2019ve lost some loved ones. They\nwere not ready to listen. The change occurred with some -- with some program on\ntelevision, I think, and slowly it -- people started talking about it.",
        "Q: Do you mean perhaps the NBC series \u201cHolocaust,\u201d in 1978, I believe? That was\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: Possible, possible. Possible.",
        "Q: Don\u2019t you think that was -- there was a distinct change [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, there was a d-distinct change was when it was just brought up on television\nthen, and people somehow were ready to talk about it, or to -- or to listen.",
        "Q: Was it difficult for you not to talk about it, or was it --",
        "A: No, I will tell you what, we were just busy living. Making a living, bringing up the\nchildren, thinking of the future. So, the 1939 Club, organization of the survivors, mostly\nfrom Poland, was organized quite early, which wa -- I was active for awhile there, and I\nhave a picture, I will show it to you, where I\u2019m being given a-award for that work. Now,\nmy husband, I will tell you later, was their treasurer for 17 years, and that was very\nhelpful for the survivors, because in the beginning they were meeting in people\u2019s houses.\nThen, when the financial situation of the survivors was better, we were able to meet in a\nrented hall, and finally there were many occasions, and we also had orchestra, and for\nawhile the Jewish Federation in Los Angeles did not actually accept anybody from us as\na member, which ch -- which changed completely right now, and we are very much\nrespected, and they come to our affairs, and the -- that --",
        "Q: What -- why did they not accept anybody as a member?",
        "A: It takes time for people to accept. It takes time, and you have to work for it, you have\nto show what you can do, you have to show what positions you have. You have to show\nhow educated your children are, and many of us, you know, like Mr. Sam Goetz, became\n-- you know, was educated and finished USC, and was active there. His wife has a\nMasters in German, and there are other people who are librarians, and they were quite --\nwere highly educated.",
        "Q: But just -- just to clarify that, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s important, I think. So, there was a certain\nperception of survivors, if I understand you correctly then, even among the -- even with\nthe Jewish Federation?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: So what was -- there was some kind of prejudice, some kind of let\u2019s say perception --\nwhat --",
        "A: I remember the saying that we would like to be on the board, and it took a long time,\nbut the switch is absolutely amazing, because we -- now we are -- they are always\nrepresentative of the Jewish Federation coming to our affairs. We are donating to their\ncauses, and things changed.",
        "Q: But what was the perception?",
        "A: I could not tell. I could not tell. I don\u2019t actually blame them. I think -- I think now, the\nattitude towards the Russian people who came -- of course, they were not in the\nconcentration camps, they were not in Auschwitz, is already different, and they are -- the\nwillingness to -- to help, is also greater, because now, since we are established, and since\nwe are -- most of us anyhow, are doing well, and want to contribute both financially, and\nwith our work, to our -- the Jewish community, and all the others, not Jewish causes, we\nare respected. You have to earn it, probably.",
        "Q: So tell me a little bit more about this club. Do you roughly know when it was -- and it\nwas sort of in the begin -- it was a social club, o-or a --",
        "A: Oh, there is --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: It started, actually, a social club, and there is a whole book about it, about the 1939\nClub. Now, maybe I should tell you now about -- what year was it, let me see. Anyhow,\nmy husband started working for the 1939 Club as a treasurer, when, under the guidance\nand ideas of Dr. Sam Goetz, the chair of Holocaust studies was established at UCLA.\nWhen you are on the UCLA campus, close to Ralbunch building, you will see on a\ncolumn, a plaque with great names, and among them is the name of David and Estelle\nKlipp, and others, all, if I\u2019m not mistaken, members of the 1939 Club, who contributed\nfinancially and otherwise, to the establishment of this chair. Now, Dr. Sam Goetz 1s really\nto be commended very, very highly for his idea, which seemed strange for some people\nwho could not understand the significance of establishing such a chair. Now -- this chair\nnow, actually from the very beginning, had very good professors, some who came from\nIsrael, and then Professor Friedlander, who was just recently awarded the genius re --\ngenius award, and who wrote -- who\u2019s writing many books, and he was teaching in\nSwitzerland, and after awhile -- that was a great accomplishment that he consented to be\nhead of this chair in Los Angeles. But there were previously, also, very, very famous\nprofessors, and the attendance in this classes was absolutely great. One time there were\n300 students. And I don\u2019t know exact number now, and also now there are graduates\nfrom this chair, who teach the Holocaust. And th -- I think, as an -- out of this example,\nthere is now a chair of Holocaust studies at Yale, and many other universities. So my\nhusband realized the importance of it, and he was a very busy man, working, head of a\noffice, a large office, and he consented to be the treasurer, because they needed\nsomebody who can handle it, and my husband had the accounting background, and he --\nand he was in this position for 17 years. Each year they had to change the -- the laws,\nallowing him to become treasurer for another year. And the -- the 1939 Club 1s -- I think\nwas a very wonderful idea. And there is a book about it, and it\u2019s very -- our minutes are\nbeing sent to some archives, yes.",
        "Q: So, what -- when -- when, about, was the as -- when was that chair established, that\nwas in the -- in the 70\u2019s, or in the 80\u2019s, about?",
        "A: Let me see. If -- 1f we -- my husband was there 17 years. I\u2019Il tell you what, I will\nknow, I will think about it. Let\u2019s continue right now, but I will think about it. It\u2019s quite\nawhile.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Because he was -- okay, he was there -- he was 17 years, then when he felt that he\ncannot do it any more, because of -- I mean, he -- he knew something about himself,\nwhich I didn\u2019t even noticed. He said he has to -- and that he has to give it up, and the --\nbecause then, the treasurer, who was another man maybe for two years, and three years,\nSO we were five, six years. Six and 17 would be 21, or something like that. Maybe more. I\nhave a book, I could look it up, and tell you exactly.",
        "Q: Did you stay in that neighborhood for a long time?",
        "A: That\u2019s a good question. I wish we did, but Philip was -- I mean, the neighborhood was\nchanging, that\u2019s for sure. But the most important thing was that the schools, which Philip,\nmy older son, was supposed to enter was much to be desired. An in -- there was -- it was\nnot a school which I would be happy that he goes to, for many reasons. And I am not\nprejudiced, I really -- I mean, I\u2019m normal, but the -- I respect everybody. Now, so we had\nto move. So we moved to a four units, and we lived in one. We bought that place, and\nthen I -- I was managing it, Dave was, of course, very busy 1n his office. I never\nmentioned about his office, but I will. And I was doing everything there, and it -- I had\nmany responsibilities, and life was really not easy, but -- but that there was -- it was\nimportant.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk about that a little bit more, about the office, and what the kind of work was\nthat --",
        "A: Dave did?",
        "Q: Yeah, a-a-and --",
        "A: No, th -- not yet, not yet. He\u2019s not yet in the office.",
        "Q: Oh, okay, okay.",
        "A: He\u2019s not yet in the office. Now there, I decided that I want to become a nutritionist. I\nhave always -- I have always been interested in nutrition. It started actually -- see my --\nmy father had diabetes, and had a kidney stone, and -- in the -- in the ghetto, he didn\u2019t\nhave neither diabetes, nor the kidney stone. And that happened to other people. However,\nwe had pathologic -- these were pathological diseases. The other diseases, of course, are\ntyphus, edema of the legs or the whole body, due to malnutrition, epidemiological\ndiseases were rampant, but these diseases were not. So, after the lib -- not right after the\nliberation, but approximately -- yeah, I was actually conscious of it even when we lived\nin Bull Heights, because I wanted Philip to eat vegetables, and if he didn\u2019t eat the\nvegetables, I would awf -- awfully upset. And he -- but he -- while we were living on\nKenmore, I decided that I want to go to college, and I went to Los Angeles City College\nto become a nutritionist, and I actually enjoyed it very much. And Charlie remembers\nwaiting for me on the campus, and watching the trains turn around. And the -- tho -- we\nhad classes in anatomy, which were very helpful to me, and I -- there were many students\nfrom the nursing department, and I was really able sometimes even to help them.\nHowever, 1n 1960, there was a change. Dave had a massive, very serious heart attack, and\nI gave up college. It was so serious, that the doctors were trying to convince me that he\nwill never survive. But with my optimistic outlook, and knowing Dave, who can\novercome a lot, I -- I told them that they don\u2019t dare telling me that. And this -- this was\nthe same year as President Eisenhower had his heart attack. And Dr. Griffiths, a famous\ncardiologist, was also in -- invited to see Dave. When he looked at his file, he was very\ngrim. But when he walked in and saw Dave, he changed his mind, and he told the other\ndoctors there is a 50 - 50 cha -- chance. Now that was very important, because the\nattitude of the doctors is important. Now, Dave recovered. I -- maybe it 1s not what is\nbeing usually done today when children are concerned, however, I tried to keep up their\nviolin lessons, and I was waiting to tell them, and to bring them to Dave, when Dave was\nable to wear a robe, and be in the waiting room. My feeling, in my case, the children were\nyoung, the father was a big support to them, and I was very much concerned that that will\n-- it will affect them. So, all the friends knew that they don\u2019t dare tell anything. And it\nworked. Anyhow --",
        "Q: It worked so that Dave got better?",
        "A: Dave recovered. It was the -- what was happening actually, he needed a pacemaker,\nbut the pacemaker wasn\u2019t in -- was not yet invented. So, there was a certain medication\nwhich just came out, which he was getting, but he was able to work with pulse of 40, and\nsometimes even 35. I don\u2019t know how this guy did it. I used to feed him vitamin E, which\nour friend, Dr. Horoby gave me permission to do so. Anyhow, when he recovered, he was\nstill working in the same establishment, but now he was the head of the office. He had the\nmastery of the English language, and knowing -- and he ex -- it was explained to the\nadministration what his background is, and believe me, he was working there for 17\nyears. He was admired, and he was respected by -- by the see -- the chairman of the board\nbecame his friends, and other directors became his friends, and the people who work for\nhim loved him. So he was very demanding, much of himself, and much for others. Now,\nlater on -- first it was a Carr shoe store, then there was HRT, and on top of this duties in\nthe office, he also became the director of imports. And -- but he -- when this possibility\nof becoming treasurer for the 1939 Club came upon, he gladly accepted it, and he was\nworking long hours, and really enjoyed doing it, because he believed in that good cause.\nSo we are now -- now we have to move again, because Philip has to enter -- I mean, the\njunior high was fine, it was vigil, and it was alright, and he was doing quite well there,\nbut there was a very good school called Fairfax High School, and we wanted him to go to\nFairfax, and we needed to be in the district. So now -- by the way, after Dave\u2019s heart\nattack, I decided that I better have a profession, so I went to a real estate school, passed\nthe examination and got a real estate license. And I was able to find a place where we are\nnow, a 16 unit, quite nice building, and the down payment was low, and I figured out that\nif I had to finance -- we finance the four units and -- and I\u2019Il be able to buy it. And I\nremember when Dave asked me, \u201cHow will you buy it?\u201d I said, \u201cDave, I will have the\nmoney.\u201d And I came here, looked at it, and Dave only had five minutes time. He came\nfrom work, and left. Just -- he introduced himself to the previous owner, and I made the\ndecision very quickly, and we bought the building. Now, we -- people were asking me,\n\u201cWeren\u2019t you afraid?\u201d There was -- at times, there were many vacancies. I said, \u201cI\u2019m not\nafraid of hard work, and I am afraid, however, of having financials problems,\u201d but of\nhard work -- and I worked very, very hard. I -- there are still the -- many kitchens there is\nlinoleum, I put -- I was putting up squares. In many places they still -- they\u2019re wallpaper,\nwhich I put on. I learned to change washers. I -- even today, I -- when garbage disposal 1s\nblocked, I can unblock it very well. And I still do many things, not as many things as I\ndid before. Now, Dave -- I was doing everything, and -- and when I had a vacancy, I\ndidn\u2019t even tell Dave. He was just too busy, and I didn\u2019t want to bother him. However, he\ndid the paperwork, which was very helpful. Well, when Dave passed -- about half a year\nbefore he passed away, I started doing the accounting, the paperwork, and Dave was so\nimpressed that I can do it, and believe me, it was a big relief to him, because he was\nalways worried, how will I be able to do it, and I think that was much easier than to take\ncare of his health. Anyhow --",
        "Q: Estelle, let\u2019s put -- let\u2019s go back just a little bit, because I do want to ask you, when\ndid you s -- did you ever talk to your children about both your war experiences, and if\nyou did, when did you start?",
        "A: This is a very good question, and it\u2019s easier now to answer it, because I talked to\nPhilip just recently, and I told him certain things from the camps, and he says, \u201cDo you\nknow you never talked to me about it?\u201d And -- But Dave did. I think maybe he talked to -\n- | -- I\u2019m not sure. But, it depends -- the reaction of children is different. Now, Philip\nknew already everything from Dave, and he --",
        "Q: By what age, sort of --",
        "A: Young.",
        "Q: Young.",
        "A: He was -- he was fairly young. They used to take walks, they had a marvelous\nrelationship. Both boys had very good relationship with Dave. And the -- so, he knew\neverything, and -- and he was angry about it. And he -- it influenced him, definitely.",
        "Q: Why -- why angry?",
        "A: That it happened, and also that God permitted it to happen. See, I never blamed God.\nSomehow I never blamed God. Maybe my philosophy about God is different. Maybe I\nreally believe that we get a certain energy, or we get influence, or we get guidance, but in\nmy philosophy about God was -- is such, probably, that I never blamed God for what\nhappened. But anyhow -- but was -- Charlie was different. Charlie figured that if we\ncould survive it, he can survive everything. So, he depends on the personality. Now, I\nmight have talked to Charlie more. I have to check it with him, but he -- not really -- I\nwas so busy about that they eat right, and that they do their homework, and that of course,\nwas the [indecipherable]. It wasn\u2019t the lack of time. I would have found the time to talk to\nthem, but probably I didn\u2019t feel like talking, and since my husband did all the talking,\nthen -- then I -- I was surprised when my -- when Philip just recently told me that I --\nwhen I talked to him about it, that I never talked to him about it. So --",
        "Q: Did you -- did you ever go back to Poland?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t. I -- I couldn\u2019t, I couldn\u2019t see what happened in Poland. I was going to a\nschool where all national holidays were celebrated, and the -- but we knew about an --\nanti-Semitism, specially in the -- in the year before the outbreak of the war, it was also\nthe influence of that folksdeutschen. I mean the German who were living in Poland, and\ncus --",
        "Q: Ethnic Germans.",
        "A: Ethnic Germans. And the -- but that -- that -- that would not be the -- th-that wouldn\u2019t\nhave influenced me so much. I speak Polish very well, and I finish high school in Poland,\nand I loved hearing music of Chopin, and the -- we were good citizen, I\u2019m sure we were\ngood citizen. Now, what influenced me? When the Germans -- it\u2019s unbelievable -- when\nthe Nazis came into Poland, and the Nazis were actually the -- the invaders, the Nazis\ncould not really differentiate on a street, who is Jewish, and who is not. But there were\nPolish children, and Polish youngsters, who are pointing out to their invaders who is a\nJew. Now, this is something which I really -- which is very bothersome to me. And you\nknow there was -- there was one occurrence that when survivors came back, they were\nkilled by the Poles. I would still be tolerant of them, because we all make mistakes,\nhowever, there is anti-Semitism now in Poland. Now, of course, we left everything. I\nhave property in Poland, and some is actually I think in -- in -- in my name now, but\npeople who tried to -- to become owners of their property have big difficulties, big\ndifficulty. And -- okay, we left them everything. We left them the family jewel, we left\nthem -- the store was taking away by the Germans. One day, they came to my father, we\nhad like a department store, not as big --",
        "Q: Estelle, I\u2019m sorry. I think we should probably stop here. This is the end of tape two,\nside A, interview with Estelle Klipp. Pl just switch it over.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nEstelle Klipp. This is tape number two, side B. So we were just talking about why you\ndid not want to go back to Poland, and maybe you can say a little bit more about that, but\nalso then say how you feel about Polish people in Poland today.",
        "A: Okay. Believe it or not, that I actually like when I have opportunity to speak Polish.\nAnd recently I needed to write a letter to someone, and it was amazing, I wrote it very\nwell, and the trick is actually to think in Polish, not to think English, and really I was\namazed how well I did, autographically, and otherwise. Now, I don\u2019t have any hate in my\nheart, amazing as it is, and I wish that Polish people well. I wish that they develop a good\neconomy, that they have a democratic government. However, I just wish very, very\nmuch, that they understand that being anti-Semitic actually doesn\u2019t make sense, and that\nthere is no reason to hate us. And it is not helpful to them at all. Now, I wish they\nfollowed the teaching of the present Pope, Pole, who went to the synagogue in Rome, and\nwho claims, rightly so, that actually the Jews contributed a lot to Christianity. That they\ngave Jesus, who was, of course, Jewish, to -- to the Christians. Now, let\u2019s be optimistic\nagain, and let\u2019s hope that the time will come, that maybe if their economic situation\nimproves, that they will start thinking in these terms, so the tradition of anti-Semitism is\nso long, and so much imbedded in their -- a-actually even the fathers in chur -- in the\nchurches, that it will take some great influence to change their minds, but hopefully --\nhopefully they will, and I really wish them well.",
        "Q: So, you don\u2019t have hate in your heart.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t have hate.",
        "Q: But it would have been too difficult for you psychologically, and emotionally, to go\nback?",
        "A: It would be like taking a wound, and opening it, and maybe even putting -- putting\nacid over it. I mean, I just always see the pictures, especially the picture where we arrived\n-- arrived in Auschwitz. We were lucky there was -- my whole family was there. I -- I see\nother pictures. I know what happened. I just hope -- which I mentioned in my tape, that\nthe deaths of my parents wasn\u2019t pa -- was not painful. I -- I just couldn\u2019t go there, I just\ncould not go there. And ti -- unless, of course, let\u2019s say my children would insist, I might\nhave changed my mind. But for myself, it will be devastating, and I really need my\nhealth. I needed my health to take care of my husband, I needed the health to -- to be the\nmanager here, I need my health for myself. And it won\u2019t be really constructive, because if\nI would know that I am achieving something, then it might influence me. But I would not\nachieve absolutely anything. The property which we have there, I will try to do\nsomething about it, but the likelihood is not very great that I would be compensated in\nany way.",
        "Q: Did you ever go to Israel?",
        "A: Oh, that\u2019s a good question. We -- I am very much concerned about Israel. I -- we have\nthe Jerusalem Post, and I -- when I get the Jerusalem Post, I read it from the first page to\nthe last. So sometimes they were already in the paper, which I\u2019m getting every day, the\nLos Angeles Times, there are also some information. I am -- I\u2019m very concerned about\nIsrael, and the -- very, very concerned, and -- however, and sometimes really I wish,\nspecially now, to be able to visit, but I have now -- now somebody who does it for me,\nand it is my granddaughter Rachel, and she\u2019s -- right now she is hiking in the desert, saw\nAngetti, saw the Wailing Wall, and when she saw the Wailing Wall, the girl started\ncrying, from emotions. So, when she will come back, she will give me some impression\nof her own. Both my sons were in Israel, and visited it, and --",
        "Q: Was there a special reason why you didn\u2019t go? Why you never went, the two of you?",
        "A: That\u2019s a very good question. Dave was really very concerned about Israel, and --\nhowever, Dave, when the pa -- first pacemaker came out, Dr. Griffiths made the decision\nthat it\u2019s time for Dave to have it, because his heart was very large, and the first surgery\nwas actually open heart surgery, and thanks to my vigilance, I notice after a few months,\nquite a short time, that he\u2019s not well. And I -- I had a very hard time impressing it abou --\nupon the people who had -- in the hospital, which was Dr. Kaper from the surgery, and it\nwas the Saint Vincent Hospital, Dr. Kay was away, there was remodeling going on. And\nfinally, when I told them that if Dr. Kay comes back, how will they be able to face him if\nthey don\u2019t check on Dave? Finally they did. So I and Charlie went with Dave there, and\nthe minute they saw him, they took him to the operating room, and at this time, they\ninserted a -- the pacemakers which are -- which are being inserted now, which don\u2019t --\ndon\u2019t require open heart surgery, but 1t\u2019s done through the arm. Now, Dave had the\nmisfortune that anything which can go wrong with the pacemaker, including a runaway\npacemaker, where the pulse was over 200, happened to him. Now, he had about 10\nsurgeries to change the pacemaker, so I have to compliment the medical profession\nbecause the last 12 years, the pacemaker lasts like eight years or more. Anyhow,\nconsidered all of this, I felt that it\u2019s not safe for us to go on a journey. First, we were\nalways afraid the pacemaker will fail, and that\u2019s why we did not go to see Israel, so I\nreally wish, for my husband, and also for myself, but where I am concerned, there is\nalways possibilit -- a possibility that I still can do it.",
        "Q: Did you, either one of you, ever testify in front of turbunal -- tribunal?",
        "A: Yes, Dave. It is in his tape. He was testi -- his testimony was there -- they took the\ntestimony here, and yeah, he testified. And he did -- testimony was taken here and sent to\nGermany.",
        "Q: But you nev -- you were never asked?",
        "A: No, I was never asked to testify. He -- you know, when he testified, they ask him\nwhether he\u2019s a lawyer, the way he testified, yeah.",
        "Q: Would you have done it?",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: Had you -- had you ever been asked?",
        "A: If I -- what -- see, he had a tremendous memory, Dave. Of course, if I would s -- if I\nwould know of some people whom I know what crimes have penetrated, and if I would\nhave, I definitely would testify, this my duty. Just as I feel about this interview, that it is\nmy duty to bear witness.",
        "Q: I only ask -- I only ask that because I bil -- I seem to remember from your videotape\nthat you said that you would have had butterflies doing it, and especially testifying about\nthe ghetto, and I just meant to ask you what that meant.",
        "A: Iam very so -- you know, that\u2019s interesting. I am -- you know, I am following a lot of\nalternative medicine. So I really am grateful, and I appreciate the regular medicine\nbecause -- and I want to maybe here have the opportunity to say thanks to Dr. Horlumby,\nwho was our friend and doctor, and helped Dave enormously. And to Dr. Griffiths, and to\nDr. Shakman, who helped Dave really to live a long life. However, I also added, to this\nmedical approach, a -- the alternative medicine approach, like homeopathy, and herbs,\nand also a certain treatment by a chiropractor, which was very helpful -- which was very\nhelpful to David, and also to me. Now, Regina told me that I mentioned in my tape that I\nwould have butterflies in my stomach, probably, if I would have to testify. Now, I\nbecame stronger through this treatment, and I just wanted to mention here that I realize --\nand I also go to a regular doctor, and I realize their contribution to medicine. It\u2019s only a-at\n-- a -- addition to my regular -- to my regular medical treatment. So, fortunately, I am\npretty good health. Now, this treatment which I am receiving, made me stronger\nemotionally. And if this question would have been asked from me today, I would have\nsaid I would gladly face them, and I would gladly testify. It is my duty to do so. So, we\ngrow. We never stop growing.",
        "Q: Well, you also just learned Spanish, I heard, so you definitely don\u2019t stop --",
        "A: Yes, yes, that\u2019s true, you know, where we\u2019re talking about the tradition, about\nlearning. I ust recently learned Spanish, and I can communicate, and it\u2019s a big help to\nme, and I -- I enjoy and probably I'll still learn another language, in the future.",
        "Q: Estelle, let me ask you something -- well, I\u2019m asking you something all the time, but\nit\u2019s just when you mentioned that your granddaughter had a very special experience,\nemotional experience in Israel.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I want to ask you first of all, how many grandchildren you have, their names, when\nthey were born, and then I take it from there.",
        "A: Okay. I\u2019m very fortunate. I -- Philip, my older son, and Ellen, his lovely wife, have a\ndaughter, Roneet, of course Klipp, and she\u2019s quite a girl. She just finish -- she just finish,\nand got her Masters in Tessle, which teaching English to people with other languages.\nRight now she\u2019s in Guatemala to improve her Spanish, and also she was teaching\nEnglish. I will meet her on July 29\", when she\u2019s coming back from there, and she needs\nto go to Seattle. So, she\u2019s quite, quite a girl. Now, her brother, Dan Klipp, I -- 1s also an\namazing guy. First, he just loves books, and he\u2019s a vivid reader, just like his father. And\nhe is lost in the bookstore. One time he called me, \u201c\u201cGrandma, I\u2019m so sorry I\u2019m so late,\nbut I didn\u2019t see the time, because I was reading.\u201d Now he\u2019s -- he also is graduated from\ncollege, Evergreen College. He\u2019s -- he masters the language of Spanish, o-of French. He\nspeaks that -- one of the Chinese languages, and he -- he keeps learning, and he loves to\ntravel. So he was already in Africa, and climbed the Mount Kilimanjaro, not r --\nnaturally, not from the bottom. He was in Asia, he was teaching English in Korea. He\nwas in Morocco, he was in Spain, and the -- he\u2019s still traveling, and -- but he also realizes\nthe importance of education, and he keeps learning, and he -- in many places where he\nvisit, he -- he either teaches English, or finds other ways to -- to pay for his travels. And I\n-- | have very optimistic -- I\u2019m very optimistic about his -- his future, and of course he\nwants to have a family, he told me, which -- which I am very happy about. Now there is\nRachel, whom I already introduced to you, because she went to Israel. She\u2019s a wonderful\ngirl. She takes singing lessons, and she\u2019s -- in school she was the stage manager for plays.\nAnd she probably, anyhow, from what she shared with me, she would like to go in that\ndirection, and -- when she enters college. There is another guy, wonderful Benjamin, and\nhe\u2019s extremely smart, and I have great hopes for his good future, specially since his\nparents are such absolutely wonderful parents, and he -- her mo -- his mother and my son\nalso, really have a special ability to deal with children, and oh well, we mention my\ndaughter-in-law now, Margo, she also uses alternative medicine, 0-o-of course, when\nnecessary, also the medical approach, and she was -- in her search, which she is very\ngood at, she found a doctor who is the MD, but he also uses alternative medicine. So,\nwhen we get together, we have much to talk about, and she was actually very helpful in\nfinding some homeopathic doctor in Los Angeles for me. Now, there are all the four, and\nI don\u2019t expect there\u2019Il be more. Maybe the next generation.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s -- let\u2019s talk about -- I don\u2019t want to make it a question, I\u2019ll just say let\u2019s talk --\ntalk a little bit about your Jewish identity.",
        "A: Okay. I would like to also say something about -- let\u2019s say, I don\u2019t consider it such a\nbig accomplishment, but this -- what -- I can talk first by -- about my Jewish identity.\nNow I, my family was actually Orthodox, so my father was great in mathematics, and he\nalso spoke some French and German. But it was a rather Orthodox house, so I was going\nto a secular school, a private gymnasium. The gymnasium named after the owner, which\nwas Mrs. Hockstein, and we had only some Hebrew instruction, not too much of it,\nunfortunately, and all the girls in school were Jewish. Now, my experience with Judaism\nwas very positive. In the -- in our home, I was told -- and I heard it quite frequently that\nnot only it\u2019s important to give, but it\u2019s important how you give, not to make the oth -- the\nreceiver uncomfortable. Every Friday night, from the house of prayer, my hus -- my\nfather -- my father was bringing what was called the orech, which means a guest, and the\nguest was really treated like a guest. And he wasn\u2019t asked any questions about his\nwhereabouts, he was just -- there was a lot hospitality about how we treated him. And a\nbag with food was prepared at the time when he was leaving. And that was done every\nsingle Friday night, and also for holidays. So, I knew about sedaka. Also, when there was\na family which was less fortunate that we were, I know that they were supported. Then I\nsaw a great respect for my grandparents. My parents respected the grandparents. Also, the\nbrothers of my mother not only respected them, but really, well, just extremely,\nextremely generous. So my -- this experience was very positive where Judaism is\nconcerned. Then my father studied on Saturday, he used the time to study the Talmud,\nand the -- and then other books. And so I heard [indecipherable] many expression, I heard\nabout Rushy, which I would like to know more about right now. Then, in the ghetto, it\nwas very interesting, because, for instance, for a time we were allowed to do some\nplanting in the backyard, it wasn\u2019t a big backyard, but everything was helpful. And no\none, but no one stole somebody\u2019s else\u2019s tomatoes, or whatever was growing. Then, when\nmy brother was so sick in the ghetto, I -- I was sometimes spending the night at the\nneighbors. There was another neighbor who -- who told us about Dr. Yawkish, and she\nwas extremely helpful. So, all my experiences, living among Jews, were very positive.\nSo, also I am -- of course I observe holidays, and for an -- for the high holidays and Yom\nKippur, I am in the temple. I pray in my own way, in general, and so I know that the\ntradition is very important, let\u2019s say when my grandchildren come, because that\u2019s how,\nactually, religion is being introduced to children, and it\u2019s very, very important. So, not\nbeing really observant, I am still very Jewish, and I -- I\u2019m happy that I\u2019m Jewish, in spi --\nin spite of what I had to suffer because of the [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Was it different with your husband, or did you -- did you agree on those -- on those --",
        "A: My husband was -- he -- I -- I -- I read Hebrew. For instance, when I am at temple, I\ncan follow. I don\u2019t understand most of it, but I can follow. My husband knew prayers by\nheart. Even when he was very, very sick, and we had Passover in our house, we were all\namazed, he remembered by heart, so many prayers. So he\u2019s -- he really -- and he\nremembered so many melodies, and so many prayers. But he was a man of the -- you\nknow, of the wide world. And him -- I wish, actually -- so, for instance, for easker, which\nis a prayer for the dead, he was always in the temple, he always was going to the temple.\nSo, actually, we were able, with our -- I-I -- maybe he would have liked even a little more\nobservance, because like, I like havdallah, which is -- which is said at the end of Shabbat,\nto make a -- a distinction between the beginning of the week, and the ending of Shabbat.\nSo, I guess if I would have asked him very much, he would have done it. But otherwise,\nwe -- we did not have any problems about observance. And it\u2019s -- definitely was a Jewish\nhome, when the children were small, there was -- we st -- sta -- stuck to that observance\nmore than I do right now.",
        "Q: It sounds as you have had a good marriage. That you have nice children and\ngrandchildren, everything. And a comfortable living. However, are there still memories\nthat haunted you and your husband? Was it not always that easy?",
        "A: It\u2019s still not easy. I just -- see, my husband passed away.",
        "Q: When?",
        "A: August second, 1997. I will go back -- he was 92, and this, I believe that he lived so\nlong, considering that he had this massive heart attack in 1960, and that he was working\nso hard, and so many hours, which he enjoyed, I feel that I have a certain contri -- that I\nmade a contribution to his health. So, it wasn\u2019t so easy in the beginning to convince him,\nbut after awhile, he admitted to my son that he follows my instructions, especially when\nfood is concerned, he does feel better. So he changed his way of eating. Then, I used\nherbs, which he -- then I juiced celery and other vegetables, because he would not\notherwise eat them. I was very, very -- how can -- inventive in making certain things out\nof vegetables, which he didn\u2019t realize they are vegetables. And also, we were using a\nchiropractor who was extremely good, and thanks to that, he -- he had water on the lungs\nfor awhile, but thanks to this treatment, he actually did not have it any more. He did not\nhave -- the water subsided. And so he had 10 surgeries for his pacemaker, and he has\nother surgeries, each time he bounced back, with his iron will, and his equanimity, and\nwent back to work, and -- and was doing a great job, so I, of course, was --",

        "A: So, the reason I answer it this way, was that I was so busy doing something which had\n-- see, he\u2019s the father of my children, he is my husband. He is himself. And if I can\nprolong his wi -- life, and I can keep him healthy, I thought this would be my greatest\nachievement, and it was really, really the -- the aim of my life. I have a friend, she used to\nalways say, \u201cOkay, David, but where is Estelle?\u201d I just -- just -- even un -- didn\u2019t\nunderstand what she said. Now, on top of it, I -- I am -- I was taking care of the 16 units.\nWhen I had a vacancy, I didn\u2019t even tell him. Now, since he passed away, I am the\nowner, I am the manager, I clean up a little bit. I do all the paperwork, I prepare the taxes.\nSo, I am actually very busy. And I was even -- I was just as busy before, to a certain\ndegree. And i -- so to tell you the truth, right now, I -- the memories haunt me more than\nbefore. Before, I was even busier, probably. I have some memories. Sometimes I dream\nthat why I\u2019m not going to our store, I would be very good at it. And I -- I -- one time I\nhad a very destructive dream, but I don\u2019t have them too frequently. This picture of -- of\nthe day in August, where we came out of the trains, and had to leave everything, and\nsuddenly we were separated. So I didn\u2019t know for a long time what actually happened.\nThis -- this scene just lives with me. I live with this scene. I -- this -- na -- it -- it really\nnever parts. Also, what haunts me was when they took my father, and specially my\nmother to the krippo, because I -- it\u2019s in my tapes, when she tame -- came back, she was\njust emotionally destroyed, and I was happy when they took me also, so -- not that I was\nbig help, but -- so this -- this was very traumatic. My --",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry. We have to stop now, and use another tape.",
        "A: Good.",
        "Q: This is the end of tape two, side B, interview with Estelle Klipp.",
        "A: Thank you.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Estelle Klipp. This is tape number three, side A. And you were just talking about --",
        "A: No, you don\u2019t want to talk to the microphone?",
        "Q: It\u2019s -- it\u2019s all right, I can -- \u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I can hear myself, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m fine on tape.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Now, I just want to say, you just talked about two memories, or two images that -- that\nhaunt you, and I was just wondering whether you had -- whether you want to conclude\nthis with another one.",
        "A: Very often I think -- we had a -- it\u2019s mentioned the tape, we had a cellar in our room,\nand [indecipherable] in the ghetto, and we were hiding there whenever there was\ndeportation, pretty successfully, and very often I think, maybe if we wouldn\u2019t have gone\nto Auschwitz, maybe if we would have been hiding there, but then I think, where would\nwe get food? And of course, we didn\u2019t know, because there were actually graves prepared\nfor the people who were designated to clean the ghetto. So, we didn\u2019t know that the\nRussian were -- at -- Russians will enter so soon. Lodz, which was Litzmanshtadt, so\neven the Rukoski went to Auschwitz. They were so deceiving, the Nazis, that they were\nable to convince us that we are going to a better place. Anyhow, that haunts me so very\noften, because I figured maybe -- then maybe we would been able to -- to survive. Then, I\noften see the picture of my brother. He became rather -- rather religious. And in the\nghetto he used to lay the tefillin, which they something you put on your head, and you\nwrap your arm, and he was extremely handsome. And, so it\u2019s a great pain that he didn\u2019t\nsurvive. Then, of course, I often think of my mother, she was an exceptional woman,\nnever complained either. And -- and w-which other memories? Course I remember, yeah,\nthere was -- but that is in my tape, this -- when we were walking with this wooden shoes,\nand the -- it was the -- ice was growing under our shoes, and they did not permit us to\nstop and clear it, and I also -- also it was very often on my mind, there was one Mrs.\nCohen. She was a mother of a girl maybe a little bit younger than me. She was very often\nwhipped and punished, and -- but, going back to the alternative medicine, in connection\neven with that, and to the yoga, which I practice religiously every day, and I feel that I\ncan stretch better, really, as time progresses. I became stronger, emotionally. So, when\nthese memories come, I still could realize that I cannot allow them to take over, because\nthere is still so much I have to do right now. And the -- for instance, I learned yoga\nactually, when I was quite young, from Indra Davy, and she was from India. And then for\nabout 20 years, I couldn\u2019t do it, because I had a pain in my back, lower back, which\ndidn\u2019t nutch -- nothing -- nothing wrong showed up on MRI, but I had this pain. Now,\nwhen my chiropractor learned to do -- she used to helped me, but it was coming back.\nThen she learned a certain method, which is developed by doctor -- Dr. Donald Epstein\nfrom New York, which was called networking, which 1s actually they just touch certain\npoints, and miraculously, it sounds strange, but Il tell you anyhow about it. One time,\nshort -- maybe two weeks after she was practicing it with me -- on me, my arm started --\nstarted moving in yoga positions. And the -- since then -- of course, I tried to -- it\u2019s\ngetting better, and better, but I do not have the problem with my back now, and I started\ndoing yoga. And actually my yoga is improving as I -- I don\u2019t know whether I mentioned\nit before. And I can do -- I can stretch better as the time progresses, and it gives me\nawfully good feeling. Besides that, there are seven postures, specially the ones which\nstretch the neck, which have a big, relaxing influence over the emotions. And I guess also\nthe nutrition which I practice. Now, there is s -- something called he -- hemio --\nhemiopathy -- homeopathy. And it was actually discovered in Germany, about more than\n200 years ago. And these remedies are also very helpful. Now, in order to know which\nvitamin is good for us, which is not, or [indecipherable] food, there is a method used by\nchiropractors, and also other practitioners of alternative medicine, called muscle testing.\nThe people who do it are kinesthiologists. That\u2019s how they call themself. Now, one\nchiropractor taught me how to do it, and I w -- I\u2019m trying to teach others, but I don\u2019t\nknow why, I am not successful. I only was able to teach my grandson. He just was so\nimpressed, because the idea of this muscle testing is such. If we put into our bodies,\nwhether it\u2019s a [indecipherable] vitamin or food, which is good for us, it strengthens our\nmuscles. And the opposite if it\u2019s not good for us, it weakens our muscles. So, the method\nis, after the certain, let\u2019s say food or vitamin, is put on the body, usually close to the\nsimus, which is on the chest, and one checks the arm by having the arm extended, and\ntrying to push it down. If the remedy is not good for the body, the arm will go down. If\nit\u2019s good for the body, it won\u2019t go. And the same can be used with the fingers, which I --\nwhich I use, and I\u2019m pretty accurate at 1t. Now this was helping me very much with my\nhusband, because I was able to determine whether things are good for him or not, and it\u2019s\na great help to me, because I am able to resist what is not good for me, since I know it.\nNow, I know of a doctor who used to be a doctor of alter -- of emergency medicine, and\nhe -- he is now doing alternative medicine, and he uses -- he has a machine which he\nuses, but where I went to him one time, and I show him that I can do muscle testing, he\nsays, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to come to me any more.\u201d And I don\u2019t.",
        "Q: So you are still trying to, or you are still growing, all the time? Not just stretching, but",
        "A: Yes, and so -- that was extremely helpful because it was very important to help my\nhusband in all ways -- I mean, in all possibly ways, so that he could live long. And the --\n[ -- it just -- I spoke to my cousin, he\u2019s in Australia, I mean, actually his son, he says, do\nyou know -- and that was maybe in \u00b085 or so, \u201cDo you remember -- now he\u2019s doing so\nwell, and do you remember how it was in -- in 1970 when I talked to you, how worried\nyou were about him?\u201d So I\u2019m very -- so he\u2019s not here, but he had a good life, and we\nkeeped him healthy, and the -- I don\u2019t want to give myself more credit than I deserve, but\nI hear from all kinds of quarters, friends, doctors and others, that I was quite helpful in\nkeeping him healthy. Now, what would you like me to a -- what would you like to ask\nme?",
        "Q: I would -- you could see in my face I have another question.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Well, something slightly different. We did talk about your Jewish identity.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Before.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember when you began to feel comfortable with an identity as an\nAmerican? Assuming that -- that --",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, I feel very --",
        "Q: -- and what -- and what [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- okay, I will tell you what -- I will tell you what. That I first -- I\u2019m really very\ngrateful to the United States for giving me the opportunity, and giving me my citizenship,\nand I think it\u2019s an absolutely great country. I mean, great country. And I am very much\ninterested in politics. When the children were small, and Adlai Stevenson was running for\npresident, I took them to the Roosevelt Hotel, and to the rally, and we were cheering him\nup. Then, I have a picture, I will show it to you, with Senator Scoop Jackson, and the --\nwhich wa -- it was my husband and myself, and I\u2019m very proud of it, and I\u2019m very, very\nsorry that he passed away so soon, and so unexpectedly. I wish -- I shouldn\u2019t say it, but I\nwish I instructed him in healthy living, but I didn\u2019t have a chance. And -- and he put -- he\nput -- on his ice cream, he put cream. Of course, many people do it, and live a long life,\nbut I really wish he lived longer. An absolutely marvelous senator, a marvelous man. I\nvote all the -- I don\u2019t miss any possibility of voting, I always vote. Of course, I follow\nwhat\u2019s happening with great interest.",
        "Q: Do you -- are more inclined to one party than another? You mentioned Stevenson, so I\ngather --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: But --",
        "A: Yes. However, I also admired Goldwater -- Goldwasser, because I thought there was a\nlot of integrity, and there are some Republicans which I really admire, so you never\nknow. It depends who the candidate will be, because I actually would vote according o-of\nthe qualities of the candidate as I see them. And so --",
        "Q: Now you -- so you have said that you\u2019re very grateful and proud to be here, and that\nyou do --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- feel American.",
        "A: I feel American, I do.",
        "Q: What -- what does that mean? C-Can you say the --",
        "A: What I -- what does it mean? Considering that they opened the gates for us,\nconsidering all the laws -- laws. Considering that people -- I mean, I went to Washington,\nof course, I went to -- I saw the -- the House of Representative. I -- I talked to my\nsenators. We also -- we -- we visited the Pentagon, I mean from the outside, and it was a\nwonderful experience, I wouldn\u2019t miss it for -- not for -- I wouldn\u2019t miss it, that\u2019s all. And\nthe -- I\u2019m concerned about our elected officials. You just -- I respect the president no\nmatter whether he\u2019s a Republican, or whether he\u2019s a Democrat, when he\u2019s our president,\nhe\u2019s our president. I feel comfortable here, but I also realize that -- that -- that Democracy\nis something which has to be constantly watched. And I remember the time of melcar --\nMcCarthy\u2019s. So I realized at that time that -- that 1t\u2019s a witch hunt. I did realize at that\ntime, and I was very happy when it was over. I worry when there is a war, of course. I\nworry about the soldiers, I respect the veterans. Oh, it\u2019s a great country to live in, and\nGod bless America.",
        "Q: Now it\u2019s almost heresy to ask you whether there is something that you find\nworrisome, or did you see something that you find difficult? You mentioned McCarthy,\nthat was -- the McCarthy era, that was -- you -- you were critical when you saw that.\nWere there other incidents, or [indecipherable]",
        "A: There is always -- there is always room to improvement. Even to just take care of the\nfamily, there are many problems, which you have to overcome. Now, if you have a\nbusiness, there are many problems. There are different people you have to deal with,\nwhom you have to instruct, or who do better, or do worse. Now imagine a country of the\nsize of the United States of America. Of course there are problems. Of course, but y --\nthere being wor-worked at. I am concerned about education. I was -- I wasn\u2019t happy\nwhen arts have been taken away from schools, and now it\u2019s a tendency to put them back\ninto schools, which I am very happy about. I am concerned about the environment. And\nthe -- it\u2019s a fine line between business and environment. I am very happy to see what the\ndifference in the -- in the attitude towards tobacco, when in the beginning all the actresses\nwere smoking, and -- to be able, I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s such a great achievement, to be able to\ncome to the point now where there is no advertising on television, and all the advertising\nused to be for tobacco, for cigarettes. I think that is enormous achievement. There are\nmany enormous achievements. And even in the race relations. So it\u2019s not perfect, but the\nachievements are absolutely great. So I have great hopes that the -- the country will\nflourish in all respects, and I think the education will also improve, because they are now.\nAnd if I can help in any way, I\u2019Il be very great to do it.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a positive outlook again. Is there -- do you speak often -- do you give\ninterviews or public talks about -- about where you come from often, or is it an -- a rare\nthing?",
        "A: On the Bar Mitzvah of my granddaughter, I had to get up and thank people for\nsomething, and they told me that I am pretty good public speaker. I mean, I didn\u2019t have to\nsay too mu -- and I probably, if I have to get up and talk, I would be able to. However, I\ndidn\u2019t do much of it. I have a friend, Celine Drack, who goes to schools, who speaks, and\nreceives many letters, she is very goo -- letters. She is very good at it. She also went to\nprison and talked to the prisoners. And she\u2019s also involved in Anti-Defamation League,\nand in the club, and so on, and I admire her for it, and it\u2019s a very worthwhile endeavor. I\nwas never -- there are many -- she also is the head of a teacher\u2019s group. She teaches\nteachers how to teach Holocaust in schools. I have a better opinion about myself now\nthan I used to, I think. And -- and if there would be really a need for me to speak -- I\nwould do some studying, of course, because it\u2019s nice to -- you know, it\u2019s nice to be able\nto answer many questions which the students have. But it\u2019s a very worthwhile endeavor,\nbecause if you meet a survivor, and you hear him talk, it has a good influence.",
        "Q: You know, I was just about to ask you, h-h-how do you think the impact of survivor\ntestimony has been on -- on -- in understanding of the Holocaust, in general? Tell me, do\nyou have any --",
        "A: We are very fortunate, very fortunate, that after the hiatus of time, when people didn\u2019t\ndare -- people didn\u2019t want to know, and there were so many deniers of the Holocaust, that\nafter this time, thanks to the TV, and thanks to the movies, we became -- it became\npublic. Not everybody s-still knows about it, but many people do, and it\u2019s a big relief for\nthe survivors. Anyhow, I feel this way, because you know, in our home, was a saying that\nthe worst curse actually in our home was mishamime visacrone. And I didn\u2019t know what\nit means. It means erase from memory. So being erased from memory, even you know,\nthere were no many -- many curses in my ho-home, where -- with my parents, but even\nabout Hitler, they say -- they say he should be erased from memory. So this points how\nimportant it is, that the people who perished should be remembered. I mean, it\u2019s\nmindboggling, it\u2019s -- because if you say six million, you cannot imagine it, but if you talk\nabout a few, like Anne Frank, or others, then you could realize it. Now, I very grateful for\n-- for it being now recognized, and taught, that\u2019s why I really commend Dr. S-Sam Goetz\nfor establishing this chair of Holocaust studies, and I hope -- and I have a feeling that the\ndeniers of the ho -- of the Holocaust, are quieting down, cause we don\u2019t hear so much\nabout them.",
        "Q: I\u2019m just curious [indecipherable] are you following sort, of some of the controversies\naround Holocaust studies? I mean some people would say that the discussion there has\nbecome very, very academic, and is taking away from the -- from the human experience\nin that way. Or that too much emphasis is being put on -- on -- on -- on the Holocaust, as\nover against other aspects of Jewish culture. How do you --",
        "A: They say if you forget history, it repeats itself. So, a base of this, it\u2019s very important\nnot to forget. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much, I do not think it\u2019s too much, because it\u2019s -- it\u2019s\nlike Wiesel, the -- who got a Nobel prize, says, you have to talk about it. I mean, because\notherwise it will repeat itself. It\u2019s not only for the Jewish people, it\u2019s for -- for the world.\nIn order that something like that can happen. So, it didn\u2019t happen overnight, the signs\nwere there. But we have to learn to watch for the signs, and to do ab -- something about it\nbefore it becomes a Holocaust. So, it\u2019s not egoistic in any way, to talk about it. And there\nwill be different aspect of the Holocaust, but all aspects should be as -- should be talked\nabout it, because we are dying out. There will be no -- I mean, I can see among our\nfriends, I looked at the telephone book, and it\u2019s amazing how many people already passed\naway. Now, once we passed away, if we don\u2019t leave the legacy, because as much as you\ntalk, you don\u2019t cover everything. It\u2019s impossible. So, for the benefit of mankind, not only\nof the Jewish people, it\u2019s important to study it, and to know what it happen, because I\ndon\u2019t think there were prog -- pogroms, other people were persecuted, but the dimension\nof this persecution, and the planning of the Final Solution, is actually, in a way unique. I\nwish it isn\u2019t -- 1t wasn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Do you think the world is learning from what can be learned from the Holocaust?",
        "A: You know, when I think about Kosovo, this is the first time -- I mean, nothing 1s\nperfect, but considering what Milosevitch was doing to these people, he was burying\nthem, he was murdering them. And I -- and it\u2019s fortunate that NATO, with the baking of -\n- backing of the United State, had the guts to do something about it, and I am not\nqualified to say it, but there is likely a likelihood, that the Holocaust of the -- of the\npeople during World War Two, had some influence of -- of this engagement. So we\nwon\u2019t eradicate hatred, but we might work towards eradication of hatred.",
        "Q: You did say just a -- just about two minutes ago, that Holocaust survivors are passing\naway.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That\u2019s true, but on the phone when we talked before I came here, you also said that\nyou -- you referred to a spirit of the survivors, when you go to gatherings --",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: Maybe you could --",
        "A: Meanin -- well, the question is why certain people survived. May -- maybe some of\nthe answer is to see them gathered together. We have this 1939 Club, who does a lot of\ncharitable work, but we also gather together, and we combine some worthwhile\nendeavors with a dance. And I actually -- it boggles my mind to see the e-enthusiasm,\nand the way these people dance. Everybody dances. People who don\u2019t feel good, dance.\nEverybody dances, and I never saw anything like it, even between much younger people.\nSo there is something special about the spirit of the survivors.",
        "Q: When y-you also said a little earlier that you don\u2019t speak publicly, you\u2019re not the kind\nto talk publicly very much. But, you -- you thought it was very important to do this\ninterview.",
        "A: Yes, definitely. I said once that I\u2019m -- I didn\u2019t feel guilty that I survive. But I would\nfeel very guilty if I would not make the video when I had a chance. I would feel very\nguilty if | would not make this interview. So I thought maybe other people have more to\nsay, but even if other people have more to say, what I have to say could be -- it\u2019s also\nhistory. So, I have the obligation, and I\u2019m going to -- I have some pictures of my family\nwhich were saved by somebody who came from Russia, and I\u2019m going to go to the\nHolocaust office, which is in Los Angeles. I had it all prepared. And I\u2019m going to get a\nlittle bit more involved, too, so that the memory of -- of the people like -- the photos\nwhich I have, what I know about it, and maybe I could mention here I appreciate the\nopportunity about my husband\u2019s brother, because that was something which he was so\nhurt and sad about. He was -- he went to Kovno, his brother Solomon, and -- in the hope\nto go to the United States. And in Kovno, what was happening, it was under the Russian\noccupation, and then under -- under German occupation. Finally, when the Nazis won,\nthey just murdered him. I mean, not only him, there was a Mr. Frumkin, who was, I\nunderstand, also murdered. And this Solomon had such potentials. He spoke a beautiful\nEnglish, and there was a English club, and when the speaker didn\u2019t come, he spoke. And\nthere was such a pain for David, my husband, his whole life, that his brother didn\u2019t\nsurvive.",

        "A: Now, you also asked me, when I look back at all this years --",
        "Q: That\u2019s the -- that\u2019s the next question.",
        "A: Ah, can we reverse it?",
        "Q: [indecipherable] you can reverse it. So, the question would be when -- I do what you\ntell me to.",
        "A: How nice, thank you very much, Regina.",
        "Q: You never wait for [indecipherable]",
        "A: You are a very lovely interpre -- interviewer.",
        "Q: Okay, well, thank you very much. I-I\u2019m blushing. But let me get -- let me get to the\nquestion. So the question would be then, when you look back at your life, of -- of 55\nyears, of the last 55 years, your life here in America, what -- how would you t -- how\nwould you speak about it? How would you -- how would you describe it?",
        "A: It\u2019s a very interesting question, and a few days ago I said, you know, since liberation,\nthere\u2019s actually -- 1t was 1945, so are -- 55 years, right? So there are 55 years. I have to\ntalk about 55 years. And -- but it doesn\u2019t seem so lo -- it wasn\u2019t easy. It was not easy.\nNow, the reason -- one of the reason it wasn\u2019t easy was that my husband so -- he was\nalways active, and had a lot of energy. His mind was fantastic, even nearly to the very\nlast minute, so he was at home. And I am very proud and happy about it, that I kept him\nat home til the last minute. And I was present at his death, and I could tell that there was a\n-- his body was like a shell, but he still was there. And then, since we lived so long in this\napartment, I just feel his presence, and I told him about this interview, and I -- believe it\nor not, I still pray for him, that wherever he 1s, he\u2019s -- he\u2019s at peace, and that everything 1s\nalright. So there was always a feeling, even when I was at home, there was always a\nfeeling of responsibility. And so the life was not easy. However, it helped me -- oh,\nespecially in -- in the later years, it helped me. Yoga, nutrition, homeopathy, herbs, all\nthese helped me to feel healthy, be healthy, and being able to function in spite of the\nmemories, and in spite of whatever difficulties I have to face. However, it wa -- a big\naspect -- I was very fortunate with the children. They were good students, they didn\u2019t\ngive me any trouble. I don\u2019t -- when I didn\u2019t have a car, we used to go with the bus,\neverywhere, and I didn\u2019t have any problems. I understand they were fighting very\nfrequently in the house, but that\u2019s -- that\u2019s normal. Now, for instance, Philip is very\nbright. I mentioned, I guess before, that he went to UCLA while still at Fairfax High. And\nhe is the avid reader, he always learns. He speaks perfect Hebrew, and perfect Spanish,\nand he also speaks man -- not speaks, but he knows many computer languages. And he\u2019s\nalso very good at composing software. That\u2019s something which is very much sought\nafter, and the -- and he happens to be extremely good at it. Now, I was also fortunate 1n --\nhe just, this year, he was celebrating his 30\" weddings anniversary. He has a very lovely\nwife. She has teacher\u2019s credentials. She\u2019s extremely talented. There is a picture here, I\nwill show it to Regina, which she painted. It was a desk at -- at UCLA, dormitory of my\nson, with all his books, and she printed the Hebrew text, which is -- you can see when\nyou look at the picture. She also can work with wood, she can do gardening. I don\u2019t know\nwhether there is anything this girl cannot do.

And Charlie was celebrating his 20\" weddings anniversary, and the -- during\nthe Olympics, he was associated with ABC, and he was the directors of systems, and he,\nwith others, devised a systems for the payroll, and other things, and his name was on the\ncredits, on television, after the Olym -- when the credits were shown. He -- he also has\nthis personality that people like to work for him, and the people who are working for him\n-- and it was very strenuous work, told him that whenever he wants to, they will always\nwork for him. His wife has also teacher\u2019s credentials, and also, as I mentioned before, she\nalso is interested in alternative medicine. I mentioned that, and she is a wonderful mother,\nand so I have actually two sons, and two very wonderful girls.",
        "Q: I -- I forgot whether I asked you that before, but in the case I haven\u2019t, I just want to\nknow, what about Jewish tradition, and Jewish faith, is that perpetuated in them, in both\nfamilies?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Charlie, Friday night, there is time to be at home, and there are no\nother arrangements being made, and there is -- there\u2019s Shabbat dinner with the challah,\nand with candles being lit, and with the prayers, and all the children know the prayers,\nand they go to the synagogue, they [indecipherable] they live in Sebastapal, in northern\nCalifornia. They used to live in Los Angeles, but they found there a very good place for\nthe children to go to religious school, and they are practicing -- they are definitely\npracticing Judaism, and the -- Rachel was very anxious to go to Israel, she went to Israel\nin a group called Young Judea, which is under the auspices of the Hadassah. And so --",
        "Q: Did you talk to your grandchildren about -- do they know about your experience\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes, they definitely know. They -- they know, and they -- I have a little tag, it\u2019s\nactually a tin tag with a number, there\u2019s two or three -- I\u2019ll have to look for the other\nnumbers. And when my granddaughter saw this tag, she says, \u201cPlease don\u2019t give it to\nanybody, I want to have it.\u201d And what was happening, they had a play of Anne Frank in\nher school. And that reminds me, I was being asked by Regina whether I ever spoke. I did\nspeak. What happened, I was visiting Sebastapal, and the -- my granddaughter Rachel\nasked me whether I would talk to the cast. And Is -- I was hesitating, but she says she\nknows there is another grandfather, but his English is not good, so I said, \u201cOkay, I will\nspeak.\u201d You should see the letters I got from that cast. It changed their complete attitude.\nThey -- they was -- it inspired them to play better, or maybe little bit different. I spoke for\nquite awhile, and I wa --",
        "Q: What did you talk about?",
        "A: About my experiences, and also, you see, I have a uncle in Poland, who perished. He\nwas taken from Amsterdam to Auschwitz, and strangely enough, my mother had at that\ntime a dream, that she is meeting him in a awful place. And so I told them about my\nuncle, who came from the same time -- from the same town as Anne Frank. And I kept\ntalking, and they listened, and you know what they did? The program had -- had a line\nthat they are -- that -- in my honor -- the program is in my honor. And then, when I was\nthere, when the play, at the last act, I was called to the stage, and I was given flowers.\nAnd I embraced, of course, everyone in the cast. So I did talk, and 1t was -- 1t was very,\nvery easy for me to talk, now, because I -- cause I had a wonderful audience, and I could\nmake the connection between -- you know, between Anne Frank, and my -- and my uncle\nin Amsterdam, and also I told them about, that even the father of Anne Frank, after the\nwar, he married. See, they were young people, you have to give them hope. You cannot --\nyou cannot devastate them. So I told them that I\u2019m no hating anybody, which is true, I\nwouldn\u2019t have said it otherwise. But I also told them that Anne Frank\u2019s father married\nagain, and has a family. So, I think was important for me to tell them that. So -- but this\nplay could have been played on Broadway. It was done so wonderful, and I -- I will show\nyou later, I had letters and letters thanking me for talking to them. Because then they\nunderstood what -- what the play is all about.",
        "Q: You had tears in your eyes when you s -- when you talked about it, why?",
        "A: Because it was very touching. It\u2019s difficult to talk about it. It\u2019s difficult to talk about it,\nbut I see all these young people sitting in front of me, and attentively listening to me. I --\nwhat a gift to me, that -- that I could talk about it, and they were -- they were so\nimpressed, and they were so, so, so grateful. And so, I did talk.",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I\u2019m gra -- I am grateful to be alive. I try always to find something to be grateful for.\nSo, I am grateful that we were able to bring up the boys so well, that we gave them music\nlessons, that we -- maybe we were fortunate also that they did so well, and are doing so\nwell. And my greatest achievement is that Dave lived to be 95, and quite happy. Happy\nwith what he was doing, happy with his family. And so 1-it wasn\u2019t an easy life for my,\nyou know, because I remember that when others went to swimming pool -- to the\nswimming pool, or on a weekend, I was watering the -- the patio, so -- to cool it off. I\nalways had the responsibilities, there were always some kind of a problems which I had\nto solve, but I really -- so it wasn\u2019t easy, but I didn\u2019t mind it, because I -- I always felt\nthat I rather work hard, than have problems which I wouldn\u2019t be able to solve. So, thank\nyou very much for interviewing me. It was a real gift to me, and a gift to my family who\nperished. Thank you.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "A: Mm-hm. Actually, when the liberation happened, I didn\u2019t feel any ela-elation, because\nI was still in Bergen-Belsen. I was still lying on the floor of something which looked like\na very big barn. There were still mountains of skeletons around me, and the skeletons\nwere actually people, who were once human being. And then, also, you could see people\nwith diarrhea, with typhus, running aimlessly to the latrine and back. So, nothing\nchanged, in a way, and so what I did, I was lying on this floor. Somehow I got pencil and\npaper, and I did writing, and writing, and writing. I wish I kept those papers, but I didn\u2019t.\nAnyhow, we would --",
        "A: Yeah, it was -- it -- I was in a barrack, and they were saying that the English army is\napproaching, and they -- we should not go to the gate too early, because we might be\nshot. So we -- but -- and they opened the gates, and -- and came in. Probably, when you\nhave been incarcerated for such a long time, you cannot switch. Anyhow, in my case,\nbesides that -- at that moment, actually -- maybe not exactly that moment, I realized that\nI'll never see my parents again, because there was no way for them to survive these\nhorrors. So, in a way, I started thinking about my family, and I started thinking about all\nthese people who perished, and this writing probably was a way to put my feelings into\npapers. Now, I was, all this time, in the -- actually, the ghetto too, but we didn\u2019t have\nmuch of a -- we didn\u2019t see each other quite often, but I was with my cousin, Ren\u00e9\nBerlinska. We met at the place where we were supposed to board the trains for\nAuschwitz, and we stayed -- we were in Auschwitz together, and we were in the camps\ntogether. And we survived together. So I actually, when they took us and -- from Zazel, I\nhad a feeling that we are going to a camp where we won\u2019t come out alive, so I jumped\nout of the train, but fortunately they did -- they picked me up, and I was expecting\nafterwards that I will be punished, but I wasn\u2019t. Probably, among this Nazi girls, there\nwas already awareness that the war is being lost. So, that -- not always stopped them, and\nPll tell you later, for instance, with my husband, who was -- who was liberated in Aren,\nclose to Hanover, the SS loaded them on a truck, and brought them someplace where they\nasked the Wehrmarkt to shoot them. However, the Wehrmarkt say, \u201cWe are soldiers, we\ndon\u2019t shoot people.\u201d And this way, 19 people were saved. Now we -- so we were moved\nto some quarters which -- my cousin believes they were army barracks, in Bergen-Belsen,\nand the -- we had a room, with eight other girls, and they were wonderful girls. We are --\nwe always have been friends with them. Now, I --",
        "A: No, all what I\u2019m saying now, they -- the Germans wouldn\u2019t have moved us. They -- I\nmean, they wanted to finish us off, you know. But after the liberation, we have been\ntransferred, so probably the very sick ones were, I assume, transferred to some ar -- to\nsome -- something which was a hospital -- maybe a makeshift hospital, but a hospital.\nUnfortunately, in their goodness, the soldiers gave us food like chocolate, which we were\nnot able to digest. I probably -- I don\u2019t know why -- they did not consume any of this, and\nthey -- so it didn\u2019t affect me, but as tragic as it is, some people who already had\nproblems, got very, very sick.",
        "A: Yeah, woo -- I was liberated by the English army. And the -- so, I mean, as I said\nagain, they wanted to -- they knew that we are starving. Now, they realized it pretty fast,\nthat the food which we\u2019 ll be able to digest is a different food than -- then they fed us the\nright food. Now, when I was in this room with the girls, which -- it\u2019s amazing when I\nthink about it, it seems that they were actually very comfortable quarters, because in\ncomparison what was before, but my energy was coming back, and so I decided to go and\nget clothes, and I found out that there is some distribution point in Hamburg. So I went to\nHamburg, and when I came back, I had a beautiful blue outfit, and I had also a hat, and I\nalso brought some clothes for the girls with whom I was living.",
        "A: I think it was a train. You know, I tried to -- I tried to think about it, and in fact, when\nI came back, I was -- it was so impressive to some people, they -- there was a younger\nman who wanted to marry me right away, and the -- my resourcefulness was coming back\nto me. So I didn\u2019t -- I f -- I was fortunate in a way that one day when I looked out, I saw\nsomebody approaching, and who was it? It was the venerable Mr. Klipp, and I shouted\nout, \u201cPanya Klipp, Panya Klipp,\u201d\nPanya is mister in Polish, and here he was. He used to be the -- the boss of the food\nsupply in the ghetto. He was very respected, and he -- he was not only the head of the\noffice, but also the head of other departments, and -- however, I remember one thing,\nwhich we -- I shouldn\u2019t maybe say, that I had diarrhea. So I went to him, and wanted\nsome rice. And he somehow refused to give it to me. And what was happening, he was an\n-- he was an unusual person with in -- impeccable integrity, and so he was allowed to\nhave additional rations of food. He didn\u2019t accept that til his -- til his wife\u2019s sister -- no, it\nwas his own sister, his own sister, was sick. So, of course, I was very happy to see him,\nit\u2019s just like seeing somebody from the previous life, and he was -- he was liberated from\nCamp Arlen, as I mentioned before, and he was living in Hanover. I actually was hoping\nthat my brother Hershlite Feingarten, whom we called Lolec, survived. He was only one\nand a half year older than I, and he was extremely capable, and if he would have\nsurvived, he would have been a famous engineer, because as a child, he took apart our\ngrandfather\u2019s clock, and put it together, and since he was missing a part, he used a string,\nand that fa -- gar -- grandfather\u2019s clock was working. Now, I also was hoping that\nAroush, our adopted cousin, when he -- he was 1n the ghetto with his parents -- now, first\nhis father was departed, then his mother was deported, and then we did adopt him, and\nmy mother [indecipherable] from a skin disease, and my father got the skin disease, I\nmust have mentioned it on my other tape.",
        "A: That was in the ghetto, right. Anyhow, he was, unfortunately -- okay, I never found\nmy brother, and I never found Aroush, but I found out that my brother was in\nBuchenwald, and people actually saw him very shortly before the liberation. However, I\nlooked for him, and I couldn\u2019t find him. Neither did I find Aroush. And Aroush -- I\nremember when Aroush was born, the joy, and the festivities were absolutely wonderful.\nWe were celebrating for a whole week, and the -- the whole family was just elated. Now\nwe -- I mentioned that Dave was in Hamburg when I was in my quest to look for Lolec\nand Aroush, I went to Hanover. In Hanover, I worked afterwards 1n a -- in a dep -- ina\nplace where a -- there was a representation of UNRRA, U-N-N-R -- I think they said W-\nA, which means United Nations relief, and we were distributing food. So I worked there\nfor a time, and there I had the honor to meet Mayor LaGuardia. He was working for\nUNRRA, and he was visiting the distribution centers, so I have a picture of him, and --\nand when we were talking to him, you could see in his expression the horror, and the\nunbelief in his face. He just stopped for awhile, and just looked really very, very\nunpleasantly impressed.",
        "A: Probably, because the -- I will show you the pictures, and you can see from his face\nthat he just couldn\u2019t believe it. I guess, judging from the words of Eisenhower, he says he\nhas to document it, because nobody, but nobody would believe it, what they did to so\nmany people. And the -- so, it is really very difficult to comprehend. Now, as the time\npasses by, to tell you the truth, it\u2019s much more for me to comprehend how all this was\npossible, and the -- in fact, it -- fortunately, I am very busy, but the pictures, let\u2019s say, of\nAuschwitz, they are always -- anyhow, quite frequently, very vividly in my mind. And\nnow, when I was making that tape, I didn\u2019t mention that a person whom I approach to ask\nfor my mother, going on my side of the line, which meant work, I didn\u2019t realize then that\nit meant life, 1t was Mengele, and the -- in my husband\u2019s ta -- tape, it\u2019s mentioned that it\nwas Mengele. Now, we are in Hanover.",
        "A: No, at that time -- at that time, we did not have a registry yet. You know, it was just by\ntalking to people, which I did, so I was told that they saw him, so my hopes were really\nup, but it -- all the search which I made, was 1n vain.",
        "A: That was still 1945, because we were liberated in -- I believe it was April. It was still\n19 fa -- it was very shortly after, I just started the search right -- right after. Now, in\nHanover, Dave, shortly after, I don\u2019t know the exact date, Dave realized that the refugees\nare just lost, and h-he contacted the German authorities to -- to organize some facilities\nwhere we can get food rations, where they -- we can get housing, when the -- when we\ncan get directions. And he was quite successful, thanks to his mastery of the German\nlanguage, he was -- til the last minish he was able to write a letter in German, really\nbeautifully, and without mistakes, I was always very impressed with it. And he also had a\nbusinessman\u2019s background. So, he organized that, and it functioned for quite awhile, and\nit was an enormous help. So, I was living -- you know, 1t was much nicer living in\nHanover. There were also many refugees there, many survivors, and they -- of course\nthere was Dave, who was only 17 years older than I was. However, with his energy, and\nhis equanimity, and his wonderful attitude towards people, chronologically there was a\ndifference, but in energy level, and in zest of life, we -- actually was none. So, we did get\nmarried, and we got married on March 16, 1946. Most of the survivors in Hanover were -\n- | would say, were at the wedding, and who officiated over that ceremony was an elderly\nman who was from German origin, and -- and he was really qualified to -- to conduct the\nceremony. And the -- I have, of course, pictures. I have the pictures of the other survivors\nwho attended the wedding. Now what -- of course, we wanted to -- to leave Germany,\nand the destination was very easy for us to decide, because Dave\u2019s -- Dave knew that he\nhas a sister in New York, but Dave was liberated by the Americans, and one of the\nAmerican army personnel promised him to get in touch with his sister, which he did, and\nwe started even receiving letters from her, and of course our destination, because of that,\nwas to go and join his sister, her husband, and they had a -- a son who was going to\ncollege, studying accounting.",
        "A: In the beginning -- now, we -- we actually did not expect much, considering our past.\nNow we were giving food through the UNRRA, then, of course, is a -- many people were\nliving on Oberstrasser. Oberstrasser was the seat of -- before the war, that was the\nYiddish geminda, which means like stat the council -- the council of the -- and, so --",
        "A: No, n-not the consulate, the council. Stat --",
        "A: The council.",
        "A: And the -- so it was the Yiddish geminda, and the -- well, these quarters were\navailable to the refugees. And then once these facilities were establish, which my\nhusband was happy to establish, then we also were able to get housing with some German\nfamilies. And we also were able to get food rations, and the -- so life became more\nlivable.",
        "A: See, that is a very interesting question. We didn\u2019t want to stay in Germany, because\nwe didn\u2019t know who, of the people in Germany, was instrumental in this horrors.\nHowever, the German people have a way of being very hospitable. And you would never\nbelieve that this people were able to do what they did, or being bystanders, and not relac -\n- react. So1--",
        "A: Oh, some, some. But we never knew when we spoke to them, or have been with them,\nwhat their background is. So, of course, most of the people -- for instance there was Pater\nDana, who was a German, and became a great friend of my husband\u2019s, and he -- and\nthere were other people who became friends of my husband. I mean, he -- David Klipp\nhad a fantastic personality, and just -- people just loved him. Everybody who -- whom he\ntouched, loved him and respected him. So, there were some German people who -- who\neven used to come later on, when we had a better living he -- headquarters that they are --\nactually came to our house. Now to -- to answer your question, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s why never\noccurred to ask to stay in Germany. And in -- where are we actually? We are -- okay, so\nDave is -- was working, he was very busy in the place, and --",
        "A: I was also busy, I was working from yo -- in the other place, and also in the -- our first\nchild, Philip Klipp was born in 19 four -- wait a second, we bus -- he was born in 1947,\noh yeah, that\u2019s right, 1947, June eight. And that was absolutely the greatest joy, because\nit was, in a way, a miracle, because we were suspecting that we were getting something\nin the food which will prevent us from being able to bear children.",
        "A: Yeah, is -- 1-1n the Auschwitz, or maybe -- probably it would have been in Auschwitz.\nS-So we -- now, about the -- we wanted to, of course, emigrate. Now, I used to have in\nthe ghetto, I had pleurisy, which is water -- water on the lungs, and when I went to\nAuschwitz, actually, I had still water on the lungs, I had swollen legs, and I had a blood\ninfection. And, believe it or not, that after we spent the first night in Auschwitz on the\nground, I awoke and I didn\u2019t have the blood infection. I still have the -- had the swollen\nlegs, which was a big handicap when we were in Hamburg, and I had to climb up on the\nwagon which took us to work. The girls had to help me, and the pleurisy also lasted\nawhile. Now, what actually helped -- I moved, did I disturb anything?",
        "A: From Auschwitz, we went to Hamburg, it\u2019s in my tapes, and then from Hamburg, we\nwent to Zazel. Zazel was not far from Hamburg, but it was located in woods. Somehow,\nbeing able to breathe the good air, to which I am very, very sensitive, helped me to get\nover the pleurisy, and also my swelling of my legs disappeared. Now, I have to add,\nwhich is also in my tape, that I was fortunate, I spoke to the doctor who was taking care\nof the health problem of the soo -- of the people in the camp. She was from\nCzechoslovakia if I am not mistaken, and I mentioned to her my qualifications, and that I\nfinished high school, and had my graduation papers, and what my background is, that I\ncould be helpful to her, and she accepted that, and for awhile I was working there, and I\nwas, of course, cleaning and washing the floor from the wrong end. And when the people\ncoming from the camp, I was interviewing either na -- interviewing them, helping the\ndoctor, and keeping the books. Eventually I did -- I did go to work outside, and we were\nbuilding -- we were digging foundations for -- for some buildings. Now, maybe here I\nwill inject something why I survived. Now, if anybody in my family would have been\nasked who is the least likely to survive, I would be the first candidate. But --",
        "A: Why? I used to be -- I use s -- I -- I didn\u2019t eat. I actually didn\u2019t eat. I was giving my --\nmy lunch to a beggar, I had my own beggar. I didn\u2019t eat any breakfast. I had some dinner,\nand my mother was very concerned. She used to come to school sometimes when I was a\ns-smaller, and -- to feed me. That could have also helped me to survive, because I wasn\u2019t\nas hungry, and my body did not demand as much food as other -- I -- was demanding\nfrom other people, who had a good diet. Also, I -- it is -- it was a face, it was the spirit. I\nbelieved that we will survive. And on this way going back to -- to this camp in Zazel,\nwhere we were once marching back from work to -- to the camp, we saw houses, lit, with\npeople living their normal life. Usually they kept us away from the population, and my\ncousin asked me, \u201cWill we ever live like that?\u201d And I said, \u201cRania, I am sure we will.\u201d",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: Somehow, even in the ghetto, the mother of Aroush, which I mentioned before, we\nwere not really doing a lot of visiting, there was no time for that, and there was -- it\nwasn\u2019t an atmosphere where you just go visiting. But whenever I came to her house, she\nwas so happy, because I was full of hope. When I went to the krippo -- it\u2019s kriminalpoisi,\nwhere many people didn\u2019t come out alive, I went in, I remember. My mother was there\nalready, my father was there already, and my brother was there already. But when I\nwalked in and there was Souter, who was the head of the ghetto -- of the kriminalpoisi,\nsorry -- I left. I was laughing. And he says, \u201cDas laken vilderkil hafher gaya.\u201d And I\nreally did. However, there was something about it -- also, when in the -- still in Lodz,\nafter the nateez -- Nazis came to Lodz, which they named Litzmanshtadt afterwards, we\nwere supposed to wear a yellow star, and I had a girlfriend, Gernia Finkelstein from\nschool, and she didn\u2019t want to go out. I said, \u201cGernia, look. We have nothing to be\nashamed of. Let the people who do it to us, let them be ashamed of it.\u201d I somehow -- I\nwas also praying. I usually pray in my own words, and as a child, I used to get up in bed -\n- well, I figured that I shouldn\u2019t do it in lying position, and I prayed. And I remember in\nHamburg, where we were in that camp in Hamburg, we had to get up very early, the stars\nwere still on the firmament, and I looked at the stars. We had to line up so that we were\nchosen to go to work, and where to go to work, and I was standing there, and looking at\nthe heavens, and I was praying for myself, for my mother, my father, and my whole\nfamily. And now, it\u2019s likely that prayer 1s very powerful, and it influences the body. So\nthat was -- my spirituality was also a reason, probably, which helped me to survive. Also,\nonce, when I was in Camp Zazel, I brought some food from the place where we were\nworking, and when I came back, I was being punished. And the punishment was that I\nwas supposed to clean the latrines. And somehow, as -- in my recollection, I didn\u2019t mind\nit a bit. Probably I was happy that I didn\u2019t get a much, much more severe punishment. So,\n1-1t -- it was the spirit, also I never, during the whole ordeal, felt inferior. I always felt that\nthey are doing it to us, but that we are not inferior. I -- maybe should we talk now a little\nbit about anti-Semitism, or that\u2019s not -- I\u2019m actually very tolerant. I feel that different\nexpressions of religion, art, language -- are actually very beneficial to the culture of a\ncountry. And teeb -- you f -- you sometimes find people saying that Jews cause anti-\nSemitism. I -- but even among Jews you sometimes hear such a statement. It\u2019s the -- in\nmy mind, it is definitely, but definitely not the truth. Anti-Semitism is caused by other\npeople. Now, it is in the human nature that it\u2019s easy to blame somebody, and it makes it\neasier to handle certain things, and sometimes even governments, in order to put the\nblame, either for some economical disasters or shortcomings, or other shortcomings,\nneeded somebody to blame, and someone who is not protected, or whose rights can be\ntaken away at will, is a -- is a scapegoat. Because, when we look actually at what the\nJewish people contribute to the countries where they were living, they s -- I would say\nthat there is a reason to be anti-Semitic. Also, which 1s quite interesting, there is now\nanti-Semitism in countries where there are no Jews. In Poland, there are actually no Jews\nto be talked about, and they are very anti-Semitic, in spite of Pol -- of the Pope\u2019s powel --\nefforts to change it. So, you -- we talk about the state of Israel, which historically, and\nwhen you look at the archaeology, and when you read the history, it is as -- 1t is the land\nof the Jews. And only having a place where we will be protected, and there will be an\naction if there is anti-Semitism in whatever form, which has been before, like pogroms,\nlike Auschwitz, then there is somebody, we are not unprotected. And by the same token,\nwe might not be so -- such easy targets. And besides that, there's the only place in the\nworld where there is a law of rittem, and people can actually, if they are Jewish -- some\nwho are not Jewish also, can come in, whether it is from Ethiopia, which used to be\nAbyssinia. Whether it is from Iran, whether it 1s from an-any country where -- where the\nconditions are fertile for anti-Semitism, there is a place to go. A-Also, I mean, of course,\nit\u2019s not only si -- some people wish to go there for other reasons, of course the gates are\nalso open.",
        "A: Yes?",
        "A: Definitely. Def -- I mean, the question 1s whether it was easier for me to have a\npartner, a survivor. There are two things. Definitely, because people have so much in\ncommon. I mean, we were -- our make-up was not exactly the same. He was very much a\nextrovert. I am partially extrovert, but partially a introvert. However, having the\nbackground, we could understand what\u2019s happening in our life. We could understand how\nwe think. And actually, many, many -- I would say, the majority of survivors married\neither survivors, or people who were in Russia, and came back, and I have one friend\nwho married a survivor, but unfortunately he passed away, Simaja, and afterwards, she\nmarried American man, a teacher. Now everything is working out fine, so it might have\nworked -- and I know some other people who married not a survivor and it 1s working out\nalright, but I feel -- I feel so much con -- so much more connected. And then I\nremembered Mr. Klipp from the ghetto, he was my boss there, and when I was in -- and\nwhen my mother was in Krippo, he one time was helpful that we got a little bit more\nfood. And besides that, he was a wonderful man, a man of integrity, a man of energy, a\nman of -- unusual man who, as I mentioned before, anybody whom he touched, or who\ntouched him, loved him and respected. So he actually -- when I think abou -- about my\naccomplishments, one of the -- I feel the greatest accomplishment was to keep him\nhealthy. So, he was not -- he -- you couldn\u2019t call him a man who is of poor health,\nhowever, he was very sick in Germany, he had appendectomy. Later he had the phlebitis,\nand then he had the emboli. But he survived. Then, in the United States -- maybe I'll\ncome to that later.",
        "A: Two, two.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Okay. To answer your question what I s -- want for my children. In the Jewish\ntradition, anyhow the tradition in Poland before the war, which I remember, the most\nimportant things was education. You could hear us saying, they can take everything away\nfrom you, but they cannot take away your education. And this really became true,\nbecause even in my case, whatever I learned, I could keep, all else was taken away. So of\ncourse, I guess the tradition is quite a long tradition, because even before children in the r\n-- | mean, many years ago, when there were no public schools for -- available, a child\nwho was three years old, a Jewish child, was going to hadahadel, and he had to learn\nHebrew letters, and -- s-so there was education even at the times when other schools were\nnot available. And [indecipherable] really like to learn more about the Torah, about the\nMishnah, about the other books, because there must be a certain wisdom in it, because\nthere was one survivor, he survived in Italy, a Dr. Noyhaus, who told us that when he was\nin the -- he was on Aryan papers, that when he s -- when he went to the university, what\nhe learned from these books was very helpful, even the medical aspects of that\nknowledge were very helpful. So we -- the question which I am answering now, 1s?",
        "A: Yeah, so the -- the -- the most important, the priority was that they should be educated,\nand my sons, both sons, are well educated. They have Masters degree. Philip was a very\ngood student in college. In Fairfax High a very -- a -- a -- high school was very famous\n[indecipherable] camp is one of them. And he was so bright, that in the last year of col --\nof high school, he was chosen to attend UCLA. So he attended each simultaneously. He\nwas also very interested in linguistic, so he switched to computers later on, and he got\nhim Masters in the Boise University. Now, my younger son, Charles Klipp, who was\nborn in 1951, on my birthday, he was also -- we were very lucky, he was also very bright,\nand a very good student, and learning came to him [indecipherable] extremely easy,\nwhich he was very much envied by other students who had to study hard. He also got his\nMasters in business administration. And so they both have very good education. They\nalso had violin lessons, and Charlie was playing as a -- in junior high he was playing in\nthe Madame Bloom Orchestra. And we had the good fortune that this orchestra and\nCharlie playing the violin, was playing at the opening of the music center in Los Angeles\na day before Christmas, and of course, all our friends, and our family, went to listen to it.\nI was very much interested, and I was with anticipation looking to opening of the music\ncenter there in Los Angeles.",
        "A: But we have to go back.",
        "A: We have to --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Okay. What -- now, in order to get to America, we had to go to a medical\nexamination, and they were especially concerned that we should not have tuberculosis,\nwhich I can understand, and since I had pleurisy in ghetto, and later also in the camp,\nthere is a scar, which mimics actually a scar of the tuberculosis. So it took many, many\nexam -- medical examination t -- til they decided that it\u2019s not anything which should\nprevent me of getting a permit to go to the United States. And this happened 1 -- the\npermit we received in 1950. And we went to New York with the ship, Captain Macrae,\nand --",
        "A: I moved, sorry.",
        "A: I have a picture what I wanted to show to Regina. Also, my husband, sh -- who was\nvery organized, wrote that we left Bremenhaven on April the 12\", and we arrived in\nHalifax on April the 21\u2018', and then we arrived in New York, on April 24\". We also wrote\nwho of the survivors were on our ship, but I don\u2019t know whether I should mention that.\nShould I mention?",
        "A: Yeah, there was -- you know, down, it was Mr. Berstin -- Sander Berstin, Abram\nHoover, Aaron Dunst, D-u-n-s-t, Samuel Showser, Shlama Zife, and Mort Kazai. This\ntime, they didn\u2019t seem to have been married, or maybe he just mentioned the men, I don\u2019t\nknow. And we arrived in New York, and the -- our brother-in-law Simon was waiting for\nus, and he fell in love with Philip. Philip had beautiful, blonde, curly hair. And the -- they\nbrought us to their house, and they were very, very hospitable. They gave us their ba -- be\n-- bedroom, and all the family, mostly of course, the family of Simon, because Helen\u2019s --\nHelen, who was the sister of my husband, lost all her family in Europe during the\nHolocaust. And so Simon\u2019s family came over, and they\u2019re very friendly, and made us feel\ngood, and I heard some comments that, \u201cHow is it that Dave has such a beautiful, young\nwife?\u201d Of course, if they would know Dave better, they would not be so surprised. And\nnow, New York has the advantage that we have family there, however, since Dave was\nso sick, which I mentioned, in Germany, the climate affected his health, and he wasn\u2019t\nfeeling well. In the meantime, we received letters from Los Angeles, from people who\nsurvived, and telling us about the wonderful climate, and the wonderful possibilities.\nNow, the decision wasn\u2019t easy, but we hoped that Helen and her family will follow us.\nSo, remember, it wasn\u2019t a easy decision, as I mentioned before, but we decided to go.\nNow Helen was afraid of planes, so we took the train, and on our -- on our way to arrive\nin the unite -- to arrive in Los Angeles. Now, I learned some English in Germany, which\nwas very fortunate, and I thought I knew more than I really knew, but it was really\nhelpful to get through on the train, and arrived here. I --",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: No, I actually -- I enjoyed the train ride. I enjoyed being alive. I really enjoy. As much\nas the moment I was liberated, I didn\u2019t feel any elation, later on, I was -- I had some\nelation. I was happy that I am alive. And I remember that once, walking someplace, and I\nsaid -- and looking at the sky, and seeing all the beauty of nature, I was really happy to be\nalive. S -- and the -- some people felt guilty -- that -- I heard that saying, I never met\nsomebody who really -- from whom I heard it. They felt -- they felt guilty that they\nsurvived. But, because we survive, we bear witness. Because we survive, there is a\ncontinuation of -- of the people who lost their lives. Because we survive, we have\nchildren, we have grandchildren, we have a second generation who already 1s a little bit\nactive in trying to remember what happens. And the memory is important for two\nreasons. Once, we owe it to the people who perished, and then, it is quite a lesson for\nhistory, which hopefully, hopefully, will be taken in consideration. What can happen --\nwhat actually can happen when the rights are being taken away, and how important\ndemocratic governments are, and how important that people can have their say. That\nthere is a difference of opinion that\u2019s fine, and hopefully -- so, that\u2019s why it\u2019s good that a\n-- we Survive. If we wouldn\u2019t sur-survive, it -- if it would happen, what Hitler planned,\nthe Final Solution, they would have murdered us all. And even today there are the deniers\nof the Holocaust, which seem to -- they be -- are becoming a little bit quieter. Imagine if\nwe wouldn\u2019t survive.",
        "A: Okay, so I -- I -- oh, we arrived in Los Angeles, and the weather was good, and the --\nour family was expecting us. So, it was really -- it was different, it was different. Now,\nwe didn\u2019t have a place to live, really. I mean, we li -- we were living with our -- were --\nmy sister-in-law, and we got along splendidly, and also with my brother-in-law.\nHowever, because they didn\u2019t feel good, we thought not to start our life in New York,\nsince it affected his health, that we should go to Los Angeles, and it was a good idea. We\nonly regret that Helen and Simon, and their son Arnold did not follow us, though they did\ncome to visit, and they liked Los Angeles very much. And so we are --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, we were not there very long, we were only three weeks. All -- all we were there\nwas three weeks.",
        "A: So -- because we had to make the decision fast la -- because you know, you have to\nmake a living. You have to make a living. So we came to Los Angeles. And we were\npicked up at the station, and then we stayed by cousin Ren\u00e9, whom I mentioned before,\nwas here living already with her husband, and she was going to school to learn\naccounting, and we stayed with them for awhile, and also there was that Siteling family\nwho -- who were very hospitable to us, and everybody, of course, adored Phil. And then\nwe started looking for a place to live, and we found it, we found the right place in of\ncourse, in Bull Heights, where most of the survivors lived, and we found a lovely place,\nand the school was across the street, and the semi-free medical facilities were down the\nstreet, it was Breed Street. And the elementary school was across the street. So -- and --\nand I could see the sky, which I -- I wa -- we -- I was ela -- elated, and it was a very good\nmove. Now, Dave, before the war, in about \u201832, he started a business, and he was very\nsuccessful, that was in Lodz. And then he was -- then the war broke out, of course, and\nthey took everything away, and he was also ready [indecipherable] it in a way, very\nrespected in -- even in Germany. And all the survivors didn\u2019t called him by his first\nname, they usually said, Panya Klipp. And -- because they respected him so much. And\nwe came here, and he worked in the warehouse, and on the weekend he was selling\nshoes. And he never, but never complained. And s -- now, we lived there, and we had --\nwe were very fortunate, we had Mexican-American neighbors on one side, and the\nchildren were watching television there, we didn\u2019t have a tel -- TV, and they was really\nhelpful. One time, the father of this couple, who didn\u2019t speak -- I don\u2019t know how we\ncommunicated. Anyhow, he took me with the car -- I didn\u2019t drive, I didn\u2019t have a car.\nAnd he took me to see the doctor, which was living on f -- which was -- had his office\nmoved to Fairfax approximately. And it was so natural to do it, but people in this doctor\u2019s\noffice were really surprised. And then, on the other --",
        "A: They were surprised that he would take me all the way, and wait for me, and take me\nback. They were really surprised. I mean, we were so used to, because our friends, you\nknow, who were also survivors, we were always ready to help one another. So then the --\non the other side, the family moved in, also with children, the Gailses, and they were\nsurvive -- they were actually sur-survivors, but they survived in England. And -- so our --\nwe also became friends, and exchanged babysitting. And they -- this girls were appro --\nthis girls and our boys played together, and then we become very friendly with the Lazar\nfamily, whose daughters were also the same age as Philip and Charlie, and this was really\nour extended family, and we used to visit one another on a weekend, and when Sofie had\nsurgery, the girls stayed with us, and we loved it, and they were so thankful for it, but it\nwas really a privilege of ours.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Okay. Now, I failed to mention that in Bull Heights, we lived together in the same\nlittle house with Basha and Max Birnbaum, other survivors. It was really nice, because\nwhen they went to school in the evening, and we prepared something, and they came\nback, and they had refreshments, and it was so -- Max couldn\u2019t stand much noise,\nhowever, we got along splendidly, and it was lovely. And I remember when I -- Basha\nwas sitting on the stairs, on the day I -- I was supposed to go to the hospital because I had\nCaesarian with Charlie, first I took Philip to this medical facility for a check-up. And she\nsaid -- and she just was so -- s -- she was really very surprised that I could do that, and\nthen go to the hospital. And the -- who took me to the hospital was Jerry Sitelin, who\nlives in Los Angeles, and whose family was instrumental in convincing us to come to Los\nAngeles, and he was going to drive me. He was also a survivor from the same camp as\nmy -- as my husband. And here his father\u2019s -- he and his father were in the camp, and he\nwas young, he was one of the youngest one. So he was to -- going to the army, and he\nbrought me to the hospital to give birth to Charles.\nNow --",
        "A: I talked to him a few days ago, and he was telling me about it. And he took it as a\nmatter of fact. I mean, he did not -- he actually did not complain, or anything. He was\nfortunate, they sent him to Germany, and he\u2019s -- Germany\u2019s really good, because he was\nthere for awhile. And he -- a marvelous son. He was such a devoted son, I think his father\nsurvives thanks -- thanks to him, and he survives thanks to his father, because he has a\ngoal, to keep his father alive. I think that -- that\u2019s also -- was helpful, you -- we have a\ngoal, and then we can take much more.",
        "A: Okay, at that time, 1t was not the thing to do. It\u2019s very interesting the progression of\nwhen talking about the Holocaust became proper. There was here a family o -- which, she\nwas a survivor, and he married Eva, a lovely woman, and she was so nice to us. She took\nus -- she was an American. She took us out to Knottsberry Farm, and of course paid for\nit, and took us places, and invited us to her beautiful house, and -- but I don\u2019t think that\nwe really talked about it. It was too grim, it was too -- 1-1-1t was bel -- beyond belief, and\npeople were not ready to talk, and people were not even more, ready to listen. They also\nwent through a war where they, you know, where they\u2019ve lost some loved ones. They\nwere not ready to listen. The change occurred with some -- with some program on\ntelevision, I think, and slowly it -- people started talking about it.",
        "A: Possible, possible. Possible.",
        "A: Yeah, there was a d-distinct change was when it was just brought up on television\nthen, and people somehow were ready to talk about it, or to -- or to listen.",
        "A: No, I will tell you what, we were just busy living. Making a living, bringing up the\nchildren, thinking of the future. So, the 1939 Club, organization of the survivors, mostly\nfrom Poland, was organized quite early, which wa -- I was active for awhile there, and I\nhave a picture, I will show it to you, where I\u2019m being given a-award for that work. Now,\nmy husband, I will tell you later, was their treasurer for 17 years, and that was very\nhelpful for the survivors, because in the beginning they were meeting in people\u2019s houses.\nThen, when the financial situation of the survivors was better, we were able to meet in a\nrented hall, and finally there were many occasions, and we also had orchestra, and for\nawhile the Jewish Federation in Los Angeles did not actually accept anybody from us as\na member, which ch -- which changed completely right now, and we are very much\nrespected, and they come to our affairs, and the -- that --",
        "A: It takes time for people to accept. It takes time, and you have to work for it, you have\nto show what you can do, you have to show what positions you have. You have to show\nhow educated your children are, and many of us, you know, like Mr. Sam Goetz, became\n-- you know, was educated and finished USC, and was active there. His wife has a\nMasters in German, and there are other people who are librarians, and they were quite --\nwere highly educated.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes.",
        "A: I remember the saying that we would like to be on the board, and it took a long time,\nbut the switch is absolutely amazing, because we -- now we are -- they are always\nrepresentative of the Jewish Federation coming to our affairs. We are donating to their\ncauses, and things changed.",
        "A: I could not tell. I could not tell. I don\u2019t actually blame them. I think -- I think now, the\nattitude towards the Russian people who came -- of course, they were not in the\nconcentration camps, they were not in Auschwitz, is already different, and they are -- the\nwillingness to -- to help, is also greater, because now, since we are established, and since\nwe are -- most of us anyhow, are doing well, and want to contribute both financially, and\nwith our work, to our -- the Jewish community, and all the others, not Jewish causes, we\nare respected. You have to earn it, probably.",
        "A: Oh, there is --",
        "A: It started, actually, a social club, and there is a whole book about it, about the 1939\nClub. Now, maybe I should tell you now about -- what year was it, let me see. Anyhow,\nmy husband started working for the 1939 Club as a treasurer, when, under the guidance\nand ideas of Dr. Sam Goetz, the chair of Holocaust studies was established at UCLA.\nWhen you are on the UCLA campus, close to Ralbunch building, you will see on a\ncolumn, a plaque with great names, and among them is the name of David and Estelle\nKlipp, and others, all, if I\u2019m not mistaken, members of the 1939 Club, who contributed\nfinancially and otherwise, to the establishment of this chair. Now, Dr. Sam Goetz 1s really\nto be commended very, very highly for his idea, which seemed strange for some people\nwho could not understand the significance of establishing such a chair. Now -- this chair\nnow, actually from the very beginning, had very good professors, some who came from\nIsrael, and then Professor Friedlander, who was just recently awarded the genius re --\ngenius award, and who wrote -- who\u2019s writing many books, and he was teaching in\nSwitzerland, and after awhile -- that was a great accomplishment that he consented to be\nhead of this chair in Los Angeles. But there were previously, also, very, very famous\nprofessors, and the attendance in this classes was absolutely great. One time there were\n300 students. And I don\u2019t know exact number now, and also now there are graduates\nfrom this chair, who teach the Holocaust. And th -- I think, as an -- out of this example,\nthere is now a chair of Holocaust studies at Yale, and many other universities. So my\nhusband realized the importance of it, and he was a very busy man, working, head of a\noffice, a large office, and he consented to be the treasurer, because they needed\nsomebody who can handle it, and my husband had the accounting background, and he --\nand he was in this position for 17 years. Each year they had to change the -- the laws,\nallowing him to become treasurer for another year. And the -- the 1939 Club 1s -- I think\nwas a very wonderful idea. And there is a book about it, and it\u2019s very -- our minutes are\nbeing sent to some archives, yes.",
        "A: Let me see. If -- 1f we -- my husband was there 17 years. I\u2019Il tell you what, I will\nknow, I will think about it. Let\u2019s continue right now, but I will think about it. It\u2019s quite\nawhile.",
        "A: Because he was -- okay, he was there -- he was 17 years, then when he felt that he\ncannot do it any more, because of -- I mean, he -- he knew something about himself,\nwhich I didn\u2019t even noticed. He said he has to -- and that he has to give it up, and the --\nbecause then, the treasurer, who was another man maybe for two years, and three years,\nSO we were five, six years. Six and 17 would be 21, or something like that. Maybe more. I\nhave a book, I could look it up, and tell you exactly.",
        "A: That\u2019s a good question. I wish we did, but Philip was -- I mean, the neighborhood was\nchanging, that\u2019s for sure. But the most important thing was that the schools, which Philip,\nmy older son, was supposed to enter was much to be desired. An in -- there was -- it was\nnot a school which I would be happy that he goes to, for many reasons. And I am not\nprejudiced, I really -- I mean, I\u2019m normal, but the -- I respect everybody. Now, so we had\nto move. So we moved to a four units, and we lived in one. We bought that place, and\nthen I -- I was managing it, Dave was, of course, very busy 1n his office. I never\nmentioned about his office, but I will. And I was doing everything there, and it -- I had\nmany responsibilities, and life was really not easy, but -- but that there was -- it was\nimportant.",
        "A: Dave did?",
        "A: No, th -- not yet, not yet. He\u2019s not yet in the office.",
        "A: He\u2019s not yet in the office. Now there, I decided that I want to become a nutritionist. I\nhave always -- I have always been interested in nutrition. It started actually -- see my --\nmy father had diabetes, and had a kidney stone, and -- in the -- in the ghetto, he didn\u2019t\nhave neither diabetes, nor the kidney stone. And that happened to other people. However,\nwe had pathologic -- these were pathological diseases. The other diseases, of course, are\ntyphus, edema of the legs or the whole body, due to malnutrition, epidemiological\ndiseases were rampant, but these diseases were not. So, after the lib -- not right after the\nliberation, but approximately -- yeah, I was actually conscious of it even when we lived\nin Bull Heights, because I wanted Philip to eat vegetables, and if he didn\u2019t eat the\nvegetables, I would awf -- awfully upset. And he -- but he -- while we were living on\nKenmore, I decided that I want to go to college, and I went to Los Angeles City College\nto become a nutritionist, and I actually enjoyed it very much. And Charlie remembers\nwaiting for me on the campus, and watching the trains turn around. And the -- tho -- we\nhad classes in anatomy, which were very helpful to me, and I -- there were many students\nfrom the nursing department, and I was really able sometimes even to help them.\nHowever, 1n 1960, there was a change. Dave had a massive, very serious heart attack, and\nI gave up college. It was so serious, that the doctors were trying to convince me that he\nwill never survive. But with my optimistic outlook, and knowing Dave, who can\novercome a lot, I -- I told them that they don\u2019t dare telling me that. And this -- this was\nthe same year as President Eisenhower had his heart attack. And Dr. Griffiths, a famous\ncardiologist, was also in -- invited to see Dave. When he looked at his file, he was very\ngrim. But when he walked in and saw Dave, he changed his mind, and he told the other\ndoctors there is a 50 - 50 cha -- chance. Now that was very important, because the\nattitude of the doctors is important. Now, Dave recovered. I -- maybe it 1s not what is\nbeing usually done today when children are concerned, however, I tried to keep up their\nviolin lessons, and I was waiting to tell them, and to bring them to Dave, when Dave was\nable to wear a robe, and be in the waiting room. My feeling, in my case, the children were\nyoung, the father was a big support to them, and I was very much concerned that that will\n-- it will affect them. So, all the friends knew that they don\u2019t dare tell anything. And it\nworked. Anyhow --",
        "A: Dave recovered. It was the -- what was happening actually, he needed a pacemaker,\nbut the pacemaker wasn\u2019t in -- was not yet invented. So, there was a certain medication\nwhich just came out, which he was getting, but he was able to work with pulse of 40, and\nsometimes even 35. I don\u2019t know how this guy did it. I used to feed him vitamin E, which\nour friend, Dr. Horoby gave me permission to do so. Anyhow, when he recovered, he was\nstill working in the same establishment, but now he was the head of the office. He had the\nmastery of the English language, and knowing -- and he ex -- it was explained to the\nadministration what his background is, and believe me, he was working there for 17\nyears. He was admired, and he was respected by -- by the see -- the chairman of the board\nbecame his friends, and other directors became his friends, and the people who work for\nhim loved him. So he was very demanding, much of himself, and much for others. Now,\nlater on -- first it was a Carr shoe store, then there was HRT, and on top of this duties in\nthe office, he also became the director of imports. And -- but he -- when this possibility\nof becoming treasurer for the 1939 Club came upon, he gladly accepted it, and he was\nworking long hours, and really enjoyed doing it, because he believed in that good cause.\nSo we are now -- now we have to move again, because Philip has to enter -- I mean, the\njunior high was fine, it was vigil, and it was alright, and he was doing quite well there,\nbut there was a very good school called Fairfax High School, and we wanted him to go to\nFairfax, and we needed to be in the district. So now -- by the way, after Dave\u2019s heart\nattack, I decided that I better have a profession, so I went to a real estate school, passed\nthe examination and got a real estate license. And I was able to find a place where we are\nnow, a 16 unit, quite nice building, and the down payment was low, and I figured out that\nif I had to finance -- we finance the four units and -- and I\u2019Il be able to buy it. And I\nremember when Dave asked me, \u201cHow will you buy it?\u201d I said, \u201cDave, I will have the\nmoney.\u201d And I came here, looked at it, and Dave only had five minutes time. He came\nfrom work, and left. Just -- he introduced himself to the previous owner, and I made the\ndecision very quickly, and we bought the building. Now, we -- people were asking me,\n\u201cWeren\u2019t you afraid?\u201d There was -- at times, there were many vacancies. I said, \u201cI\u2019m not\nafraid of hard work, and I am afraid, however, of having financials problems,\u201d but of\nhard work -- and I worked very, very hard. I -- there are still the -- many kitchens there is\nlinoleum, I put -- I was putting up squares. In many places they still -- they\u2019re wallpaper,\nwhich I put on. I learned to change washers. I -- even today, I -- when garbage disposal 1s\nblocked, I can unblock it very well. And I still do many things, not as many things as I\ndid before. Now, Dave -- I was doing everything, and -- and when I had a vacancy, I\ndidn\u2019t even tell Dave. He was just too busy, and I didn\u2019t want to bother him. However, he\ndid the paperwork, which was very helpful. Well, when Dave passed -- about half a year\nbefore he passed away, I started doing the accounting, the paperwork, and Dave was so\nimpressed that I can do it, and believe me, it was a big relief to him, because he was\nalways worried, how will I be able to do it, and I think that was much easier than to take\ncare of his health. Anyhow --",
        "A: This is a very good question, and it\u2019s easier now to answer it, because I talked to\nPhilip just recently, and I told him certain things from the camps, and he says, \u201cDo you\nknow you never talked to me about it?\u201d And -- But Dave did. I think maybe he talked to -\n- | -- I\u2019m not sure. But, it depends -- the reaction of children is different. Now, Philip\nknew already everything from Dave, and he --",
        "A: Young.",
        "A: He was -- he was fairly young. They used to take walks, they had a marvelous\nrelationship. Both boys had very good relationship with Dave. And the -- so, he knew\neverything, and -- and he was angry about it. And he -- it influenced him, definitely.",
        "A: That it happened, and also that God permitted it to happen. See, I never blamed God.\nSomehow I never blamed God. Maybe my philosophy about God is different. Maybe I\nreally believe that we get a certain energy, or we get influence, or we get guidance, but in\nmy philosophy about God was -- is such, probably, that I never blamed God for what\nhappened. But anyhow -- but was -- Charlie was different. Charlie figured that if we\ncould survive it, he can survive everything. So, he depends on the personality. Now, I\nmight have talked to Charlie more. I have to check it with him, but he -- not really -- I\nwas so busy about that they eat right, and that they do their homework, and that of course,\nwas the [indecipherable]. It wasn\u2019t the lack of time. I would have found the time to talk to\nthem, but probably I didn\u2019t feel like talking, and since my husband did all the talking,\nthen -- then I -- I was surprised when my -- when Philip just recently told me that I --\nwhen I talked to him about it, that I never talked to him about it. So --",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t. I -- I couldn\u2019t, I couldn\u2019t see what happened in Poland. I was going to a\nschool where all national holidays were celebrated, and the -- but we knew about an --\nanti-Semitism, specially in the -- in the year before the outbreak of the war, it was also\nthe influence of that folksdeutschen. I mean the German who were living in Poland, and\ncus --",
        "A: Ethnic Germans. And the -- but that -- that -- that would not be the -- th-that wouldn\u2019t\nhave influenced me so much. I speak Polish very well, and I finish high school in Poland,\nand I loved hearing music of Chopin, and the -- we were good citizen, I\u2019m sure we were\ngood citizen. Now, what influenced me? When the Germans -- it\u2019s unbelievable -- when\nthe Nazis came into Poland, and the Nazis were actually the -- the invaders, the Nazis\ncould not really differentiate on a street, who is Jewish, and who is not. But there were\nPolish children, and Polish youngsters, who are pointing out to their invaders who is a\nJew. Now, this is something which I really -- which is very bothersome to me. And you\nknow there was -- there was one occurrence that when survivors came back, they were\nkilled by the Poles. I would still be tolerant of them, because we all make mistakes,\nhowever, there is anti-Semitism now in Poland. Now, of course, we left everything. I\nhave property in Poland, and some is actually I think in -- in -- in my name now, but\npeople who tried to -- to become owners of their property have big difficulties, big\ndifficulty. And -- okay, we left them everything. We left them the family jewel, we left\nthem -- the store was taking away by the Germans. One day, they came to my father, we\nhad like a department store, not as big --",

        "A: Okay. Believe it or not, that I actually like when I have opportunity to speak Polish.\nAnd recently I needed to write a letter to someone, and it was amazing, I wrote it very\nwell, and the trick is actually to think in Polish, not to think English, and really I was\namazed how well I did, autographically, and otherwise. Now, I don\u2019t have any hate in my\nheart, amazing as it is, and I wish that Polish people well. I wish that they develop a good\neconomy, that they have a democratic government. However, I just wish very, very\nmuch, that they understand that being anti-Semitic actually doesn\u2019t make sense, and that\nthere is no reason to hate us. And it is not helpful to them at all. Now, I wish they\nfollowed the teaching of the present Pope, Pole, who went to the synagogue in Rome, and\nwho claims, rightly so, that actually the Jews contributed a lot to Christianity. That they\ngave Jesus, who was, of course, Jewish, to -- to the Christians. Now, let\u2019s be optimistic\nagain, and let\u2019s hope that the time will come, that maybe if their economic situation\nimproves, that they will start thinking in these terms, so the tradition of anti-Semitism is\nso long, and so much imbedded in their -- a-actually even the fathers in chur -- in the\nchurches, that it will take some great influence to change their minds, but hopefully --\nhopefully they will, and I really wish them well.",

I mean, I just always see the pictures, especially the picture where we arrived\n-- arrived in Auschwitz. We were lucky there was -- my whole family was there. I -- I see\nother pictures. I know what happened. I just hope -- which I mentioned in my tape, that\nthe deaths of my parents wasn\u2019t pa -- was not painful. I -- I just couldn\u2019t go there, I just\ncould not go there.

I needed my health to take care of my husband, I needed the health to -- to be the\nmanager here, I need my health for myself. And it won\u2019t be really constructive, because if\nI would know that I am achieving something, then it might influence me. But I would not\nachieve absolutely anything.

Dave was really very concerned about Israel, and --\nhowever, Dave, when the pa -- first pacemaker came out, Dr. Griffiths made the decision\nthat it\u2019s time for Dave to have it, because his heart was very large, and the first surgery\nwas actually open heart surgery, and thanks to my vigilance, I notice after a few months,\nquite a short time, that he\u2019s not well. And I -- I had a very hard time impressing it abou --\nupon the people who had -- in the hospital, which was Dr. Kaper from the surgery, and it\nwas the Saint Vincent Hospital, Dr. Kay was away, there was remodeling going on. And\nfinally, when I told them that if Dr. Kay comes back, how will they be able to face him if\nthey don\u2019t check on Dave? Finally they did. So I and Charlie went with Dave there, and\nthe minute they saw him, they took him to the operating room, and at this time, they\ninserted a -- the pacemakers which are -- which are being inserted now, which don\u2019t --\ndon\u2019t require open heart surgery, but 1t\u2019s done through the arm. Now, Dave had the\nmisfortune that anything which can go wrong with the pacemaker, including a runaway\npacemaker, where the pulse was over 200, happened to him. Now, he had about 10\nsurgeries to change the pacemaker, so I have to compliment the medical profession\nbecause the last 12 years, the pacemaker lasts like eight years or more. Anyhow,\nconsidered all of this, I felt that it\u2019s not safe for us to go on a journey. First, we were\nalways afraid the pacemaker will fail, and that\u2019s why we did not go to see Israel, so I\nreally wish, for my husband, and also for myself, but where I am concerned, there is\nalways possibilit -- a possibility that I still can do it.",
        "A: Yes, Dave. It is in his tape. He was testi -- his testimony was there -- they took the\ntestimony here, and yeah, he testified. And he did -- testimony was taken here and sent to\nGermany.",
        "A: No, I was never asked to testify. He -- you know, when he testified, they ask him\nwhether he\u2019s a lawyer, the way he testified, yeah.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "A: If I -- what -- see, he had a tremendous memory, Dave. Of course, if I would s -- if I\nwould know of some people whom I know what crimes have penetrated, and if I would\nhave, I definitely would testify, this my duty. Just as I feel about this interview, that it is\nmy duty to bear witness.",
        "A: Iam very so -- you know, that\u2019s interesting. I am -- you know, I am following a lot of\nalternative medicine. So I really am grateful, and I appreciate the regular medicine\nbecause -- and I want to maybe here have the opportunity to say thanks to Dr. Horlumby,\nwho was our friend and doctor, and helped Dave enormously. And to Dr. Griffiths, and to\nDr. Shakman, who helped Dave really to live a long life. However, I also added, to this\nmedical approach, a -- the alternative medicine approach, like homeopathy, and herbs,\nand also a certain treatment by a chiropractor, which was very helpful -- which was very\nhelpful to David, and also to me. Now, Regina told me that I mentioned in my tape that I\nwould have butterflies in my stomach, probably, if I would have to testify. Now, I\nbecame stronger through this treatment, and I just wanted to mention here that I realize --\nand I also go to a regular doctor, and I realize their contribution to medicine. It\u2019s only a-at\n-- a -- addition to my regular -- to my regular medical treatment. So, fortunately, I am\npretty good health. Now, this treatment which I am receiving, made me stronger\nemotionally. And if this question would have been asked from me today, I would have\nsaid I would gladly face them, and I would gladly testify. It is my duty to do so. So, we\ngrow. We never stop growing.",
        "A: Yes, yes, that\u2019s true, you know, where we\u2019re talking about the tradition, about\nlearning. I ust recently learned Spanish, and I can communicate, and it\u2019s a big help to\nme, and I -- I enjoy and probably I'll still learn another language, in the future.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Okay. I\u2019m very fortunate. I -- Philip, my older son, and Ellen, his lovely wife, have a\ndaughter, Roneet, of course Klipp, and she\u2019s quite a girl. She just finish -- she just finish,\nand got her Masters in Tessle, which teaching English to people with other languages.\nRight now she\u2019s in Guatemala to improve her Spanish, and also she was teaching\nEnglish. I will meet her on July 29\", when she\u2019s coming back from there, and she needs\nto go to Seattle. So, she\u2019s quite, quite a girl. Now, her brother, Dan Klipp, I -- 1s also an\namazing guy. First, he just loves books, and he\u2019s a vivid reader, just like his father. And\nhe is lost in the bookstore. One time he called me, \u201c\u201cGrandma, I\u2019m so sorry I\u2019m so late,\nbut I didn\u2019t see the time, because I was reading.\u201d Now he\u2019s -- he also is graduated from\ncollege, Evergreen College. He\u2019s -- he masters the language of Spanish, o-of French. He\nspeaks that -- one of the Chinese languages, and he -- he keeps learning, and he loves to\ntravel. So he was already in Africa, and climbed the Mount Kilimanjaro, not r --\nnaturally, not from the bottom. He was in Asia, he was teaching English in Korea. He\nwas in Morocco, he was in Spain, and the -- he\u2019s still traveling, and -- but he also realizes\nthe importance of education, and he keeps learning, and he -- in many places where he\nvisit, he -- he either teaches English, or finds other ways to -- to pay for his travels. And I\n-- | have very optimistic -- I\u2019m very optimistic about his -- his future, and of course he\nwants to have a family, he told me, which -- which I am very happy about. Now there is\nRachel, whom I already introduced to you, because she went to Israel. She\u2019s a wonderful\ngirl. She takes singing lessons, and she\u2019s -- in school she was the stage manager for plays.\nAnd she probably, anyhow, from what she shared with me, she would like to go in that\ndirection, and -- when she enters college. There is another guy, wonderful Benjamin, and\nhe\u2019s extremely smart, and I have great hopes for his good future, specially since his\nparents are such absolutely wonderful parents, and he -- her mo -- his mother and my son\nalso, really have a special ability to deal with children, and oh well, we mention my\ndaughter-in-law now, Margo, she also uses alternative medicine, 0-o-of course, when\nnecessary, also the medical approach, and she was -- in her search, which she is very\ngood at, she found a doctor who is the MD, but he also uses alternative medicine. So,\nwhen we get together, we have much to talk about, and she was actually very helpful in\nfinding some homeopathic doctor in Los Angeles for me. Now, there are all the four, and\nI don\u2019t expect there\u2019Il be more. Maybe the next generation.",
        "A: Okay. I would like to also say something about -- let\u2019s say, I don\u2019t consider it such a\nbig accomplishment, but this -- what -- I can talk first by -- about my Jewish identity.\nNow I, my family was actually Orthodox, so my father was great in mathematics, and he\nalso spoke some French and German. But it was a rather Orthodox house, so I was going\nto a secular school, a private gymnasium. The gymnasium named after the owner, which\nwas Mrs. Hockstein, and we had only some Hebrew instruction, not too much of it,\nunfortunately, and all the girls in school were Jewish. Now, my experience with Judaism\nwas very positive. In the -- in our home, I was told -- and I heard it quite frequently that\nnot only it\u2019s important to give, but it\u2019s important how you give, not to make the oth -- the\nreceiver uncomfortable. Every Friday night, from the house of prayer, my hus -- my\nfather -- my father was bringing what was called the orech, which means a guest, and the\nguest was really treated like a guest. And he wasn\u2019t asked any questions about his\nwhereabouts, he was just -- there was a lot hospitality about how we treated him. And a\nbag with food was prepared at the time when he was leaving. And that was done every\nsingle Friday night, and also for holidays. So, I knew about sedaka. Also, when there was\na family which was less fortunate that we were, I know that they were supported. Then I\nsaw a great respect for my grandparents. My parents respected the grandparents. Also, the\nbrothers of my mother not only respected them, but really, well, just extremely,\nextremely generous. So my -- this experience was very positive where Judaism is\nconcerned. Then my father studied on Saturday, he used the time to study the Talmud,\nand the -- and then other books. And so I heard [indecipherable] many expression, I heard\nabout Rushy, which I would like to know more about right now. Then, in the ghetto, it\nwas very interesting, because, for instance, for a time we were allowed to do some\nplanting in the backyard, it wasn\u2019t a big backyard, but everything was helpful. And no\none, but no one stole somebody\u2019s else\u2019s tomatoes, or whatever was growing. Then, when\nmy brother was so sick in the ghetto, I -- I was sometimes spending the night at the\nneighbors. There was another neighbor who -- who told us about Dr. Yawkish, and she\nwas extremely helpful. So, all my experiences, living among Jews, were very positive.\nSo, also I am -- of course I observe holidays, and for an -- for the high holidays and Yom\nKippur, I am in the temple. I pray in my own way, in general, and so I know that the\ntradition is very important, let\u2019s say when my grandchildren come, because that\u2019s how,\nactually, religion is being introduced to children, and it\u2019s very, very important. So, not\nbeing really observant, I am still very Jewish, and I -- I\u2019m happy that I\u2019m Jewish, in spi --\nin spite of what I had to suffer because of the [indecipherable]",
        "A: My husband was -- he -- I -- I -- I read Hebrew. For instance, when I am at temple, I\ncan follow. I don\u2019t understand most of it, but I can follow. My husband knew prayers by\nheart. Even when he was very, very sick, and we had Passover in our house, we were all\namazed, he remembered by heart, so many prayers. So he\u2019s -- he really -- and he\nremembered so many melodies, and so many prayers. But he was a man of the -- you\nknow, of the wide world. And him -- I wish, actually -- so, for instance, for easker, which\nis a prayer for the dead, he was always in the temple, he always was going to the temple.\nSo, actually, we were able, with our -- I-I -- maybe he would have liked even a little more\nobservance, because like, I like havdallah, which is -- which is said at the end of Shabbat,\nto make a -- a distinction between the beginning of the week, and the ending of Shabbat.\nSo, I guess if I would have asked him very much, he would have done it. But otherwise,\nwe -- we did not have any problems about observance. And it\u2019s -- definitely was a Jewish\nhome, when the children were small, there was -- we st -- sta -- stuck to that observance\nmore than I do right now.",
        "A: It\u2019s still not easy. I just -- see, my husband passed away.",
        "A: August second, 1997. I will go back -- he was 92, and this, I believe that he lived so\nlong, considering that he had this massive heart attack in 1960, and that he was working\nso hard, and so many hours, which he enjoyed, I feel that I have a certain contri -- that I\nmade a contribution to his health. So, it wasn\u2019t so easy in the beginning to convince him,\nbut after awhile, he admitted to my son that he follows my instructions, especially when\nfood is concerned, he does feel better. So he changed his way of eating. Then, I used\nherbs, which he -- then I juiced celery and other vegetables, because he would not\notherwise eat them. I was very, very -- how can -- inventive in making certain things out\nof vegetables, which he didn\u2019t realize they are vegetables. And also, we were using a\nchiropractor who was extremely good, and thanks to that, he -- he had water on the lungs\nfor awhile, but thanks to this treatment, he actually did not have it any more. He did not\nhave -- the water subsided. And so he had 10 surgeries for his pacemaker, and he has\nother surgeries, each time he bounced back, with his iron will, and his equanimity, and\nwent back to work, and -- and was doing a great job, so I, of course, was --",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: So, the reason I answer it this way, was that I was so busy doing something which had\n-- see, he\u2019s the father of my children, he is my husband. He is himself. And if I can\nprolong his wi -- life, and I can keep him healthy, I thought this would be my greatest\nachievement, and it was really, really the -- the aim of my life. I have a friend, she used to\nalways say, \u201cOkay, David, but where is Estelle?\u201d I just -- just -- even un -- didn\u2019t\nunderstand what she said. Now, on top of it, I -- I am -- I was taking care of the 16 units.\nWhen I had a vacancy, I didn\u2019t even tell him. Now, since he passed away, I am the\nowner, I am the manager, I clean up a little bit. I do all the paperwork, I prepare the taxes.\nSo, I am actually very busy. And I was even -- I was just as busy before, to a certain\ndegree. And i -- so to tell you the truth, right now, I -- the memories haunt me more than\nbefore. Before, I was even busier, probably. I have some memories. Sometimes I dream\nthat why I\u2019m not going to our store, I would be very good at it. And I -- I -- one time I\nhad a very destructive dream, but I don\u2019t have them too frequently. This picture of -- of\nthe day in August, where we came out of the trains, and had to leave everything, and\nsuddenly we were separated. So I didn\u2019t know for a long time what actually happened.\nThis -- this scene just lives with me. I live with this scene. I -- this -- na -- it -- it really\nnever parts. Also, what haunts me was when they took my father, and specially my\nmother to the krippo, because I -- it\u2019s in my tapes, when she tame -- came back, she was\njust emotionally destroyed, and I was happy when they took me also, so -- not that I was\nbig help, but -- so this -- this was very traumatic. My --",
        "A: Good.",
        "A: Thank you.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: No, you don\u2019t want to talk to the microphone?",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Very often I think -- we had a -- it\u2019s mentioned the tape, we had a cellar in our room,\nand [indecipherable] in the ghetto, and we were hiding there whenever there was\ndeportation, pretty successfully, and very often I think, maybe if we wouldn\u2019t have gone\nto Auschwitz, maybe if we would have been hiding there, but then I think, where would\nwe get food? And of course, we didn\u2019t know, because there were actually graves prepared\nfor the people who were designated to clean the ghetto. So, we didn\u2019t know that the\nRussian were -- at -- Russians will enter so soon. Lodz, which was Litzmanshtadt, so\neven the Rukoski went to Auschwitz. They were so deceiving, the Nazis, that they were\nable to convince us that we are going to a better place. Anyhow, that haunts me so very\noften, because I figured maybe -- then maybe we would been able to -- to survive. Then, I\noften see the picture of my brother. He became rather -- rather religious. And in the\nghetto he used to lay the tefillin, which they something you put on your head, and you\nwrap your arm, and he was extremely handsome. And, so it\u2019s a great pain that he didn\u2019t\nsurvive. Then, of course, I often think of my mother, she was an exceptional woman,\nnever complained either. And -- and w-which other memories? Course I remember, yeah,\nthere was -- but that is in my tape, this -- when we were walking with this wooden shoes,\nand the -- it was the -- ice was growing under our shoes, and they did not permit us to\nstop and clear it, and I also -- also it was very often on my mind, there was one Mrs.\nCohen. She was a mother of a girl maybe a little bit younger than me. She was very often\nwhipped and punished, and -- but, going back to the alternative medicine, in connection\neven with that, and to the yoga, which I practice religiously every day, and I feel that I\ncan stretch better, really, as time progresses. I became stronger, emotionally. So, when\nthese memories come, I still could realize that I cannot allow them to take over, because\nthere is still so much I have to do right now. And the -- for instance, I learned yoga\nactually, when I was quite young, from Indra Davy, and she was from India. And then for\nabout 20 years, I couldn\u2019t do it, because I had a pain in my back, lower back, which\ndidn\u2019t nutch -- nothing -- nothing wrong showed up on MRI, but I had this pain. Now,\nwhen my chiropractor learned to do -- she used to helped me, but it was coming back.\nThen she learned a certain method, which is developed by doctor -- Dr. Donald Epstein\nfrom New York, which was called networking, which 1s actually they just touch certain\npoints, and miraculously, it sounds strange, but Il tell you anyhow about it. One time,\nshort -- maybe two weeks after she was practicing it with me -- on me, my arm started --\nstarted moving in yoga positions. And the -- since then -- of course, I tried to -- it\u2019s\ngetting better, and better, but I do not have the problem with my back now, and I started\ndoing yoga. And actually my yoga is improving as I -- I don\u2019t know whether I mentioned\nit before. And I can do -- I can stretch better as the time progresses, and it gives me\nawfully good feeling. Besides that, there are seven postures, specially the ones which\nstretch the neck, which have a big, relaxing influence over the emotions. And I guess also\nthe nutrition which I practice. Now, there is s -- something called he -- hemio --\nhemiopathy -- homeopathy. And it was actually discovered in Germany, about more than\n200 years ago. And these remedies are also very helpful. Now, in order to know which\nvitamin is good for us, which is not, or [indecipherable] food, there is a method used by\nchiropractors, and also other practitioners of alternative medicine, called muscle testing.\nThe people who do it are kinesthiologists. That\u2019s how they call themself. Now, one\nchiropractor taught me how to do it, and I w -- I\u2019m trying to teach others, but I don\u2019t\nknow why, I am not successful. I only was able to teach my grandson. He just was so\nimpressed, because the idea of this muscle testing is such. If we put into our bodies,\nwhether it\u2019s a [indecipherable] vitamin or food, which is good for us, it strengthens our\nmuscles. And the opposite if it\u2019s not good for us, it weakens our muscles. So, the method\nis, after the certain, let\u2019s say food or vitamin, is put on the body, usually close to the\nsimus, which is on the chest, and one checks the arm by having the arm extended, and\ntrying to push it down. If the remedy is not good for the body, the arm will go down. If\nit\u2019s good for the body, it won\u2019t go. And the same can be used with the fingers, which I --\nwhich I use, and I\u2019m pretty accurate at 1t. Now this was helping me very much with my\nhusband, because I was able to determine whether things are good for him or not, and it\u2019s\na great help to me, because I am able to resist what is not good for me, since I know it.\nNow, I know of a doctor who used to be a doctor of alter -- of emergency medicine, and\nhe -- he is now doing alternative medicine, and he uses -- he has a machine which he\nuses, but where I went to him one time, and I show him that I can do muscle testing, he\nsays, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to come to me any more.\u201d And I don\u2019t.",
        "A: Yes, and so -- that was extremely helpful because it was very important to help my\nhusband in all ways -- I mean, in all possibly ways, so that he could live long. And the --\n[ -- it just -- I spoke to my cousin, he\u2019s in Australia, I mean, actually his son, he says, do\nyou know -- and that was maybe in \u00b085 or so, \u201cDo you remember -- now he\u2019s doing so\nwell, and do you remember how it was in -- in 1970 when I talked to you, how worried\nyou were about him?\u201d So I\u2019m very -- so he\u2019s not here, but he had a good life, and we\nkeeped him healthy, and the -- I don\u2019t want to give myself more credit than I deserve, but\nI hear from all kinds of quarters, friends, doctors and others, that I was quite helpful in\nkeeping him healthy. Now, what would you like me to a -- what would you like to ask\nme?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, I feel very --",
        "A: -- okay, I will tell you what -- I will tell you what. That I first -- I\u2019m really very\ngrateful to the United States for giving me the opportunity, and giving me my citizenship,\nand I think it\u2019s an absolutely great country. I mean, great country. And I am very much\ninterested in politics. When the children were small, and Adlai Stevenson was running for\npresident, I took them to the Roosevelt Hotel, and to the rally, and we were cheering him\nup. Then, I have a picture, I will show it to you, with Senator Scoop Jackson, and the --\nwhich wa -- it was my husband and myself, and I\u2019m very proud of it, and I\u2019m very, very\nsorry that he passed away so soon, and so unexpectedly. I wish -- I shouldn\u2019t say it, but I\nwish I instructed him in healthy living, but I didn\u2019t have a chance. And -- and he put -- he\nput -- on his ice cream, he put cream. Of course, many people do it, and live a long life,\nbut I really wish he lived longer. An absolutely marvelous senator, a marvelous man. I\nvote all the -- I don\u2019t miss any possibility of voting, I always vote. Of course, I follow\nwhat\u2019s happening with great interest.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. However, I also admired Goldwater -- Goldwasser, because I thought there was a\nlot of integrity, and there are some Republicans which I really admire, so you never\nknow. It depends who the candidate will be, because I actually would vote according o-of\nthe qualities of the candidate as I see them. And so --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I feel American, I do.",
        "A: What I -- what does it mean? Considering that they opened the gates for us,\nconsidering all the laws -- laws. Considering that people -- I mean, I went to Washington,\nof course, I went to -- I saw the -- the House of Representative. I -- I talked to my\nsenators. We also -- we -- we visited the Pentagon, I mean from the outside, and it was a\nwonderful experience, I wouldn\u2019t miss it for -- not for -- I wouldn\u2019t miss it, that\u2019s all. And\nthe -- I\u2019m concerned about our elected officials. You just -- I respect the president no\nmatter whether he\u2019s a Republican, or whether he\u2019s a Democrat, when he\u2019s our president,\nhe\u2019s our president. I feel comfortable here, but I also realize that -- that -- that Democracy\nis something which has to be constantly watched. And I remember the time of melcar --\nMcCarthy\u2019s. So I realized at that time that -- that 1t\u2019s a witch hunt. I did realize at that\ntime, and I was very happy when it was over. I worry when there is a war, of course. I\nworry about the soldiers, I respect the veterans. Oh, it\u2019s a great country to live in, and\nGod bless America.",
        "A: There is always -- there is always room to improvement. Even to just take care of the\nfamily, there are many problems, which you have to overcome. Now, if you have a\nbusiness, there are many problems. There are different people you have to deal with,\nwhom you have to instruct, or who do better, or do worse. Now imagine a country of the\nsize of the United States of America. Of course there are problems. Of course, but y --\nthere being wor-worked at. I am concerned about education. I was -- I wasn\u2019t happy\nwhen arts have been taken away from schools, and now it\u2019s a tendency to put them back\ninto schools, which I am very happy about. I am concerned about the environment. And\nthe -- it\u2019s a fine line between business and environment. I am very happy to see what the\ndifference in the -- in the attitude towards tobacco, when in the beginning all the actresses\nwere smoking, and -- to be able, I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s such a great achievement, to be able to\ncome to the point now where there is no advertising on television, and all the advertising\nused to be for tobacco, for cigarettes. I think that is enormous achievement. There are\nmany enormous achievements. And even in the race relations. So it\u2019s not perfect, but the\nachievements are absolutely great. So I have great hopes that the -- the country will\nflourish in all respects, and I think the education will also improve, because they are now.\nAnd if I can help in any way, I\u2019Il be very great to do it.",
        "A: On the Bar Mitzvah of my granddaughter, I had to get up and thank people for\nsomething, and they told me that I am pretty good public speaker. I mean, I didn\u2019t have to\nsay too mu -- and I probably, if I have to get up and talk, I would be able to. However, I\ndidn\u2019t do much of it. I have a friend, Celine Drack, who goes to schools, who speaks, and\nreceives many letters, she is very goo -- letters. She is very good at it. She also went to\nprison and talked to the prisoners. And she\u2019s also involved in Anti-Defamation League,\nand in the club, and so on, and I admire her for it, and it\u2019s a very worthwhile endeavor. I\nwas never -- there are many -- she also is the head of a teacher\u2019s group. She teaches\nteachers how to teach Holocaust in schools. I have a better opinion about myself now\nthan I used to, I think. And -- and if there would be really a need for me to speak -- I\nwould do some studying, of course, because it\u2019s nice to -- you know, it\u2019s nice to be able\nto answer many questions which the students have. But it\u2019s a very worthwhile endeavor,\nbecause if you meet a survivor, and you hear him talk, it has a good influence.",
        "A: We are very fortunate, very fortunate, that after the hiatus of time, when people didn\u2019t\ndare -- people didn\u2019t want to know, and there were so many deniers of the Holocaust, that\nafter this time, thanks to the TV, and thanks to the movies, we became -- it became\npublic. Not everybody s-still knows about it, but many people do, and it\u2019s a big relief for\nthe survivors. Anyhow, I feel this way, because you know, in our home, was a saying that\nthe worst curse actually in our home was mishamime visacrone. And I didn\u2019t know what\nit means. It means erase from memory. So being erased from memory, even you know,\nthere were no many -- many curses in my ho-home, where -- with my parents, but even\nabout Hitler, they say -- they say he should be erased from memory. So this points how\nimportant it is, that the people who perished should be remembered. I mean, it\u2019s\nmindboggling, it\u2019s -- because if you say six million, you cannot imagine it, but if you talk\nabout a few, like Anne Frank, or others, then you could realize it. Now, I very grateful for\n-- for it being now recognized, and taught, that\u2019s why I really commend Dr. S-Sam Goetz\nfor establishing this chair of Holocaust studies, and I hope -- and I have a feeling that the\ndeniers of the ho -- of the Holocaust, are quieting down, cause we don\u2019t hear so much\nabout them.",
        "A: They say if you forget history, it repeats itself. So, a base of this, it\u2019s very important\nnot to forget. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much, I do not think it\u2019s too much, because it\u2019s -- it\u2019s\nlike Wiesel, the -- who got a Nobel prize, says, you have to talk about it. I mean, because\notherwise it will repeat itself. It\u2019s not only for the Jewish people, it\u2019s for -- for the world.\nIn order that something like that can happen. So, it didn\u2019t happen overnight, the signs\nwere there. But we have to learn to watch for the signs, and to do ab -- something about it\nbefore it becomes a Holocaust. So, it\u2019s not egoistic in any way, to talk about it. And there\nwill be different aspect of the Holocaust, but all aspects should be as -- should be talked\nabout it, because we are dying out. There will be no -- I mean, I can see among our\nfriends, I looked at the telephone book, and it\u2019s amazing how many people already passed\naway. Now, once we passed away, if we don\u2019t leave the legacy, because as much as you\ntalk, you don\u2019t cover everything. It\u2019s impossible. So, for the benefit of mankind, not only\nof the Jewish people, it\u2019s important to study it, and to know what it happen, because I\ndon\u2019t think there were prog -- pogroms, other people were persecuted, but the dimension\nof this persecution, and the planning of the Final Solution, is actually, in a way unique. I\nwish it isn\u2019t -- 1t wasn\u2019t.",
        "A: You know, when I think about Kosovo, this is the first time -- I mean, nothing 1s\nperfect, but considering what Milosevitch was doing to these people, he was burying\nthem, he was murdering them. And I -- and it\u2019s fortunate that NATO, with the baking of -\n- backing of the United State, had the guts to do something about it, and I am not\nqualified to say it, but there is likely a likelihood, that the Holocaust of the -- of the\npeople during World War Two, had some influence of -- of this engagement. So we\nwon\u2019t eradicate hatred, but we might work towards eradication of hatred.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, yes, yes.",
        "A: Meanin -- well, the question is why certain people survived. May -- maybe some of\nthe answer is to see them gathered together. We have this 1939 Club, who does a lot of\ncharitable work, but we also gather together, and we combine some worthwhile\nendeavors with a dance. And I actually -- it boggles my mind to see the e-enthusiasm,\nand the way these people dance. Everybody dances. People who don\u2019t feel good, dance.\nEverybody dances, and I never saw anything like it, even between much younger people.\nSo there is something special about the spirit of the survivors.",
        "A: Yes, definitely. I said once that I\u2019m -- I didn\u2019t feel guilty that I survive. But I would\nfeel very guilty if I would not make the video when I had a chance. I would feel very\nguilty if | would not make this interview. So I thought maybe other people have more to\nsay, but even if other people have more to say, what I have to say could be -- it\u2019s also\nhistory. So, I have the obligation, and I\u2019m going to -- I have some pictures of my family\nwhich were saved by somebody who came from Russia, and I\u2019m going to go to the\nHolocaust office, which is in Los Angeles. I had it all prepared. And I\u2019m going to get a\nlittle bit more involved, too, so that the memory of -- of the people like -- the photos\nwhich I have, what I know about it, and maybe I could mention here I appreciate the\nopportunity about my husband\u2019s brother, because that was something which he was so\nhurt and sad about. He was -- he went to Kovno, his brother Solomon, and -- in the hope\nto go to the United States. And in Kovno, what was happening, it was under the Russian\noccupation, and then under -- under German occupation. Finally, when the Nazis won,\nthey just murdered him. I mean, not only him, there was a Mr. Frumkin, who was, I\nunderstand, also murdered. And this Solomon had such potentials. He spoke a beautiful\nEnglish, and there was a English club, and when the speaker didn\u2019t come, he spoke. And\nthere was such a pain for David, my husband, his whole life, that his brother didn\u2019t\nsurvive.",
        "A: Now, you also asked me, when I look back at all this years --",
        "A: Ah, can we reverse it?",
        "A: How nice, thank you very much, Regina.",
        "A: You are a very lovely interpre -- interviewer.",
        "A: It\u2019s a very interesting question, and a few days ago I said, you know, since liberation,\nthere\u2019s actually -- 1t was 1945, so are -- 55 years, right? So there are 55 years. I have to\ntalk about 55 years. And -- but it doesn\u2019t seem so lo -- it wasn\u2019t easy. It was not easy.\nNow, the reason -- one of the reason it wasn\u2019t easy was that my husband so -- he was\nalways active, and had a lot of energy. His mind was fantastic, even nearly to the very\nlast minute, so he was at home. And I am very proud and happy about it, that I kept him\nat home til the last minute. And I was present at his death, and I could tell that there was a\n-- his body was like a shell, but he still was there. And then, since we lived so long in this\napartment, I just feel his presence, and I told him about this interview, and I -- believe it\nor not, I still pray for him, that wherever he 1s, he\u2019s -- he\u2019s at peace, and that everything 1s\nalright. So there was always a feeling, even when I was at home, there was always a\nfeeling of responsibility. And so the life was not easy. However, it helped me -- oh,\nespecially in -- in the later years, it helped me. Yoga, nutrition, homeopathy, herbs, all\nthese helped me to feel healthy, be healthy, and being able to function in spite of the\nmemories, and in spite of whatever difficulties I have to face. However, it wa -- a big\naspect -- I was very fortunate with the children. They were good students, they didn\u2019t\ngive me any trouble. I don\u2019t -- when I didn\u2019t have a car, we used to go with the bus,\neverywhere, and I didn\u2019t have any problems. I understand they were fighting very\nfrequently in the house, but that\u2019s -- that\u2019s normal. Now, for instance, Philip is very\nbright. I mentioned, I guess before, that he went to UCLA while still at Fairfax High. And\nhe is the avid reader, he always learns. He speaks perfect Hebrew, and perfect Spanish,\nand he also speaks man -- not speaks, but he knows many computer languages. And he\u2019s\nalso very good at composing software. That\u2019s something which is very much sought\nafter, and the -- and he happens to be extremely good at it. Now, I was also fortunate 1n --\nhe just, this year, he was celebrating his 30\" weddings anniversary. He has a very lovely\nwife. She has teacher\u2019s credentials. She\u2019s extremely talented. There is a picture here, I\nwill show it to Regina, which she painted. It was a desk at -- at UCLA, dormitory of my\nson, with all his books, and she printed the Hebrew text, which is -- you can see when\nyou look at the picture. She also can work with wood, she can do gardening. I don\u2019t know\nwhether there is anything this girl cannot do. And then, in nine -- then, I told you about\nthe birth of Charlie in 1951, and ha -- he has very much my husband\u2019s personality, and\nwhen I -- it was -- I\u2019m really grateful, these two boys 1s like a great gift to me, and their\nwives also. And Charlie was celebrating his 20\" weddings anniversary, and the -- during\nthe Olympics, he was associated with ABC, and he was the directors of systems, and he,\nwith others, devised a systems for the payroll, and other things, and his name was on the\ncredits, on television, after the Olym -- when the credits were shown. He -- he also has\nthis personality that people like to work for him, and the people who are working for him\n-- and it was very strenuous work, told him that whenever he wants to, they will always\nwork for him. His wife has also teacher\u2019s credentials, and also, as I mentioned before, she\nalso is interested in alternative medicine. I mentioned that, and she is a wonderful mother,\nand so I have actually two sons, and two very wonderful girls.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Charlie, Friday night, there is time to be at home, and there are no\nother arrangements being made, and there is -- there\u2019s Shabbat dinner with the challah,\nand with candles being lit, and with the prayers, and all the children know the prayers,\nand they go to the synagogue, they [indecipherable] they live in Sebastapal, in northern\nCalifornia. They used to live in Los Angeles, but they found there a very good place for\nthe children to go to religious school, and they are practicing -- they are definitely\npracticing Judaism, and the -- Rachel was very anxious to go to Israel, she went to Israel\nin a group called Young Judea, which is under the auspices of the Hadassah. And so --",
        "A: Yes, they definitely know. They -- they know, and they -- I have a little tag, it\u2019s\nactually a tin tag with a number, there\u2019s two or three -- I\u2019ll have to look for the other\nnumbers. And when my granddaughter saw this tag, she says, \u201cPlease don\u2019t give it to\nanybody, I want to have it.\u201d And what was happening, they had a play of Anne Frank in\nher school. And that reminds me, I was being asked by Regina whether I ever spoke. I did\nspeak. What happened, I was visiting Sebastapal, and the -- my granddaughter Rachel\nasked me whether I would talk to the cast. And Is -- I was hesitating, but she says she\nknows there is another grandfather, but his English is not good, so I said, \u201cOkay, I will\nspeak.\u201d You should see the letters I got from that cast. It changed their complete attitude.\nThey -- they was -- it inspired them to play better, or maybe little bit different. I spoke for\nquite awhile, and I wa --",
        "A: About my experiences, and also, you see, I have a uncle in Poland, who perished. He\nwas taken from Amsterdam to Auschwitz, and strangely enough, my mother had at that\ntime a dream, that she is meeting him in a awful place. And so I told them about my\nuncle, who came from the same time -- from the same town as Anne Frank. And I kept\ntalking, and they listened, and you know what they did? The program had -- had a line\nthat they are -- that -- in my honor -- the program is in my honor. And then, when I was\nthere, when the play, at the last act, I was called to the stage, and I was given flowers.\nAnd I embraced, of course, everyone in the cast. So I did talk, and 1t was -- 1t was very,\nvery easy for me to talk, now, because I -- cause I had a wonderful audience, and I could\nmake the connection between -- you know, between Anne Frank, and my -- and my uncle\nin Amsterdam, and also I told them about, that even the father of Anne Frank, after the\nwar, he married. See, they were young people, you have to give them hope. You cannot --\nyou cannot devastate them. So I told them that I\u2019m no hating anybody, which is true, I\nwouldn\u2019t have said it otherwise. But I also told them that Anne Frank\u2019s father married\nagain, and has a family. So, I think was important for me to tell them that. So -- but this\nplay could have been played on Broadway. It was done so wonderful, and I -- I will show\nyou later, I had letters and letters thanking me for talking to them. Because then they\nunderstood what -- what the play is all about.",
        "A: Because it was very touching. It\u2019s difficult to talk about it. It\u2019s difficult to talk about it,\nbut I see all these young people sitting in front of me, and attentively listening to me. I --\nwhat a gift to me, that -- that I could talk about it, and they were -- they were so\nimpressed, and they were so, so, so grateful. And so, I did talk.",
        "A: Oh, you asked me --",
        "A: -- the second question was, when I look back at my life.",
        "A: I\u2019m gra -- I am grateful to be alive. I try always to find something to be grateful for.\nSo, I am grateful that we were able to bring up the boys so well, that we gave them music\nlessons, that we -- maybe we were fortunate also that they did so well, and are doing so\nwell. And my greatest achievement is that Dave lived to be 95, and quite happy. Happy\nwith what he was doing, happy with his family. And so 1-it wasn\u2019t an easy life for my,\nyou know, because I remember that when others went to swimming pool -- to the\nswimming pool, or on a weekend, I was watering the -- the patio, so -- to cool it off. I\nalways had the responsibilities, there were always some kind of a problems which I had\nto solve, but I really -- so it wasn\u2019t easy, but I didn\u2019t mind it, because I -- I always felt\nthat I rather work hard, than have problems which I wouldn\u2019t be able to solve. So, thank\nyou very much for interviewing me. It was a real gift to me, and a gift to my family who\nperished. Thank you.",
        "A: Okay.",
