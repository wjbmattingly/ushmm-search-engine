        "Question: Could you please tell us your full name.",
        "Answer: My name is Doris Rauch.",
        "Q: And where were you born?",
        "A: | was born in Berdenau (ph), Czechoslovakia on August 26, 1920.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s begin about talking about the town that you -- the city that you grew up in.\nCan you describe it in any way?",
        "A: It had about 350,000 inhabitants. I\u2019ve no idea how many Jews, but | suppose it\ncan be looked up. And it was bilingual, both Czech and German. We spoke German\nat home because my parents were born in Austria, Hungary, and were brought up\nspeaking German and going to German schools. And the same happened to me.",
        "Q: What kind of neighborhood did you live in? Was it a mixed neighborhood of Jews\nand non-Jews?",
        "A: Yes. It was a mixed neighborhood. Can one hear your questions?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: There was no ghetto as such at all.",
        "Q: Did you live right in town? In the downtown area? Or centrally located?",
        "A: Yes. Centrally located.",
        "Q: Now did you live in a house or an apartment?",
        "A: In an apartment.",
        "Q: How would you describe your family? Were you middle class?",
        "A: Yes, we were middle class.",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s now talk about your parents. What kind of work did your father do?\nDoris Rauch 2\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 2",
        "A: My father had a wholesale leather business which he inherited from his father. He\nwas not really a businessman. But he couldn't help it. He had to become the owner\nof the wholesale leather business, which meant that he had to travel a lot to various\nmanufacturers all over Czechoslovakia to sell leather from which they made shoes\nand gloves and things like that.",
        "Q: And your mother, did she work?",
        "A: No, my mother didn\u2019t work until when my father\u2019s business became very bad, in\nthe Depression. We had the Depression too, in the thirties. She filled in as his\nsecretary or answering the telephone and so on.",
        "Q: How religious was your family?",
        "A: Not very religious. We went to the synagogue on the high holy days, which was\nNew Year's and Yom Kippur. And we all met in my grandmother's house, when Yom\nKippur was over, to break the fast with cake and -- all sorts of cakes -- and coffee.\nAnd the whole family congregated there.",
        "Q: Any other holidays that you celebrated? or were those the only ones?",
        "A: We also, not in our house, but every August went to my mother\u2019s\noldest brother and there.",
        "Q: Did you have any brothers or sisters?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: And did you have any religious training as a child yourself?",
        "A: Yes. We had an hour of so-called religion, both in grade school and then later in\nthe gymnasium, which is a classical high school. But | am afraid we were not very\ngood students. It was just something you had to go through.\nDoris Rauch 3\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 3",
        "Q: Now you said you lived in a mixed neighborhood of non-Jews and Jews as a child\ngrowing up. Were there any problems when you were young with any of your\nneighbors?",
        "A: No problems at all. We never -- | personally never knew about the Semitism.\nMaybe it was kept from me, | don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: And the school that you went to, was it a public school or --",
        "A: It was public. Both schools were public schools, yes.",
        "Q: So your schoolmates were also non-Jews and Jews.",
        "A: Yes. And in addition, there were Germans and belonged to the so-called Sudatin\n(ph) German where became the worst Nazis there were. So | have very mixed\nfeelings about my former classmates. Sentimentally, | feel very attached to them, but\non the other hand, | attended a couple of meetings with them in Europe. But | broke\nup with them completely because they behaved as if they didn\u2019t know about the\nHolocaust.",
        "Q: When you were in elementary school, as a child, did you have any other interests\noutside of school? Any hobbies? Did you do anything else besides go to school?",
        "A: Well, we went on hikes. And skiing.",
        "Q: Did you belong to any youth groups?",
        "A: No, | did not. | had quite a few cousins my own age, so we very often played\ntogether and did things together.",
        "Q: Did your relatives live nearby? Your extended family live nearby?",
        "A: Yes. Everything was -- almost all of them were reachable on foot, or at the most\nby bus or streetcar.\nDoris Rauch 4\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 4",
        "Q: Then you went on to gymnasium, you said. And did you have any other outside\ninterest at that time? At high school age?",
        "A: Well, | took French lessons and English lessons -- no, English -- yes, the last two\nyears of the -- My high school didn\u2019t have any modern languages except Czech. You\ntalked -- | mean the language -- the instruction was in German, but you had Czech\nas a foreign language. And in addition to that, | was very often sent to Czech-\nspeaking towns in the summer so that my Czech would become perfect.",
        "Q: Was this your family went away? or you went away by yourself?",
        "A: | went away by myself to friends or relatives where the main language was Czech.\nAnd we had no other modern languages, only Latin and Greek in school. So | had\nprivate lessons, first in French for many years. And | was sent to Switzerland to speak\nFrench fluently. And | also had English lessons later on which really stuck with me\nbecause the teacher was wonderful. With French, I\u2019ve totally forgotten, almost. And\n| even learned Spanish one year, when Hitler was already occupying us. Occupied\nmyself, | guess. Or for possible immigration.",
        "Q: Were you interested in music? Dance? Any of the arts?",
        "A: | took piano for | don\u2019t know how many years and was absolutely unmusical. And\none of the happiest days of my life was when the teacher said, \u201cNo.\u201d She doesn't\nthink it had any use for me to learn piano anymore. That is as far as my musicality is\nconcerned. . We had, what you call it, gymnastics and dance lessons from\na very good teacher whom we adored. And that was something very pleasant in my\nyouth, going twice a week to those lessons.\nDoris Rauch 9)\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 5",
        "Q: So you said that your friends, some of your friends, and your teachers were not\nJewish, but you don\u2019t recall any anti-Semitic incidents. It was a very pleasant\nchildhood growing up.",
        "A: Yes. Well, pleasant, perhaps. But you know, when my father had all his business\ndifficulties, a child fears that even if they didn\u2019t talk in front of me, but | knew there\nwas something going on. And | had to inherit the 10,000 Czech crowns from a great\nuncle of mine. And so, | knew that my father needed money, so | offered him my\n10,000 crowns, which I\u2019m sure would have been a drop in the bucket. So, you know,\n| remembered this. But he lost his business and my mother\u2019s brothers took him into\ntheir business, which was a wholesale fur business.",
        "Q: What year was this?",
        "A: That was in the early thirties; | don\u2019t Know exactly which year. So | was, | don\u2019t\nknow, ten years old or twelve years old.",
        "Q: But you still were able to do other activities.",
        "A: Yeah. | didn't curtail my activities at all.",
        "Q: Okay. When did you start noticing, then, a change in your life? When did\nconditions --",
        "A: You mean as far -- well, when | was, | think, 17 years old because --",
        "Q: This is 1937 we\u2019re in now.",
        "A: 1937, yeah. For instance, one of my fellow students told me | had remonstrated\nwith him, that he didn't do so well in school anymore and he was a very\nintelligent guy. And he told me that he was very tired because every night he went\nacross the borders to Austria to train for Hitler's coming. | didn\u2019t even believe it. |\nDoris Rauch 6\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 6\nthought he was just bragging in front of me. But today | know it was true. So -- and\ndo you know then in 1938, Hitler occupied the Sudatin (ph) line? And | felt very\nstrongly that my parents had done the wrong thing, that they sent me to a German\nschool. And | wore a Czech flag on my lapel in that year after Hitler really occupied\nthe entire state and we had to wear a star instead of a flag. But | still feel that today\nthat it was a great mistake that | did not go to a Czech school. So of course, the\noutcome would have been the same.",
        "Q: But there was a choice when you were younger to go to a Czech school or a\nGerman school?",
        "A: Well, the choice was not up to me. | mean, the way we go to our -- yes, | could\nhave gone.",
        "Q: Yes, | mean, your parents had the choice, but they decided to send you to a\nGerman school",
        "A: Yes. | went to the same school that my father graduated from.",
        "Q: Alright, so it\u2019s now 1938.",
        "A: Yes, but there\u2019s a big event before that. My father had lung cancer. And he died\nin 1936, when | was 16 years old. And that was very hard on me because | was very\nclose to my father, much more so than to my mother.",
        "Q: And how did that change your life and your mother\u2019s life?",
        "A: Well, my mother tried to make a living by renting out a room to two girl students.\nShe did all sorts of things. She had a representation -- no, you don\u2019t say that. Anyhow,\nshe sewed, knit woolen materials to friends and got a commission on that. And then\nshe sent all her friends to certain coffee shop in the town. And there they had to say\nDoris Rauch 7\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 7\nthat they were sent by my mother and she got a percentage from that. So my mother\nwas very capable, although she never really worked. But she was very intelligent and\nvery practical. And although there probably was some money, my father hadn't left\nanything because we just lived on his salary. But | think my mother inherited money\nfrom her mother. And | know she had stocks in the bank because | used to go with\nher to collect the coupons. But she always made an effort to earn some money\nherself.",
        "Q: So that was 1936. Anything in 1937 that you recall?",
        "A: Well, | was -- you mean as far as anti-Semitism?",
        "Q: Or personally?",
        "A: Well, | was sent to Switzerland that summer, into a French-speaking family.",
        "Q: What did you know about Hitler at that point?",
        "A: Well, we knew quite a bit. Perhaps not |, but my mother had a very close friend in\nGermany, in Oldham (ph). And this woman came to us once a year, usually, and my\nmother went to visit her. And she smuggled out some money from Germany before\nthey immigrated to Argentina. So we knew what was going on there. And then, also,\nHitler occupied Austria in 1938 and one of my mother\u2019s brothers lived in Vienna. So\nthey all immigrated first to Czechoslovakia to Berdenau (ph) before they attempted\nto get a visa to someplace else. And they did eventually go to France and from\nFrance to unoccupied France. And they got to America maybe 1940, 1939 or \u201840.",
        "Q: Do you remember being particularly frightened in 1938?",
        "A: Not really. But that was perhaps because | was so naive, you know? | grew up in\na very protected way. And | was rather childish at that age. And my mother used to\nDoris Rauch 8\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 8\nsay, \u201cNothing will happen to us. I\u2019m happy here as long as | have a roof over my\nhead.\u201d That was her constant saying. | would have liked to immigrate, but it wasn't\neasy because we didn\u2019t have any money out anywhere. And it was very difficult to\nget a visa to anyplace. But some of my friends succeeded, but we didn't.",
        "Q: Alright. And now it\u2019s 1938. Any other changes that you can recall?",
        "A: Yes. Of course, | graduated from gymnasium in 1938. But | could no longer go to\na university. That was 193--. You know, | don\u2019t remember how that was. Anyhow, |\ncould not study. And my mother said --",
        "Q: Why could you not study?",
        "A: Because they didn\u2019t admit Jews.",
        "Q: How did that make you feel? Here you\u2019re a young, 18-year-old young woman.",
        "A: | don\u2019t remember. Probably not very well. But | was not -- as | said, | was very\nnaive. And all this didn't touch me somehow. And my mother decided | should attend\na Class in a Czech -- that\u2019s what it was. We were not admitted to German-speaking\nuniversities. Maybe still to Czech, | don\u2019t know. But | went to a Czech, you would call\nit maybe post-graduate textile school because Berdenau was full of textile factories.\nAnd the so-called English cloth that was so famous really came from Berdenau and\nwas treated in England. You know, they had a special process they treated it with.\nBut it was woven in Berdenau. So she send me to a textile school which did not\ninterest me at all. | mean, we had to learn all about textile machinery and -- well, there\nwas a possibility that perhaps | could become a designer. My mother still saw that\nwe could live a normal life. But it was a wasted year so far as my future --",
        "Q: So you did go and study textiles.\nDoris Rauch 9\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 9",
        "A: | did go. | graduated from there. It was a lot of fun because we were only two girls\nand the rest were all young boys. So we had a good time, not knowing what was\nwaiting for us. So | graduated from there in June of 1939 and we were already\noccupied by Hitler.",
        "Q: How had your life changed when you became occupied.",
        "A: Well, it all came very gradually. First, we had to wear yellow stars. And then we\nhad a curfew. We couldn't go into the street | think it was seven or eight o'clock in the\nevening. We had to stay at home. Then we were concentrated into certain streets of\nthe city, which meant that my mother -- because we lived on such a street, we got,\nso to speak, renters into the apartment. There were several -- there were two families\nin addition to us in the apartment that was only a three-room apartment with one\nbathroom.",
        "Q: What did it feel like to wear the star?",
        "A: Well, it was, what is the English word? It was not pleasant.",
        "Q: Upsetting?",
        "A: It was upsetting and it was -- what is the word? -- It was -- well, you know. It made\nyou feel that people were looking down on you.",
        "Q: Demeaning?",
        "A: Demeaning. That was the word | was looking for. So we had all those people in\nthe apartment, which -- for me, it was not so bad because | liked all the people. And\n| don\u2019t know how it was for my mother. But there was nothing we could do against it.\nAnd my favorite aunt, who was the only one of her family that left behind, had to move\nDoris Rauch 10\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 10\nto -- had a villa in the suburbs, but her husband was gone. Her three daughters were\ngone. And she had to move into our neighborhood. That made me very happy.",
        "Q: Were these restrictions frightening to you?",
        "A: Yes. And it became more frightening as time went on. But in the meantime, after\ngraduating from the textile school, | got a job, an unpaid job, in a textile factory out in\nthe country. And | lived there five and a half days of the week and came home for the\nweekend. And | worked then all phases of the textile industry. The factory still\nbelonged to a Jewish firm. That\u2019s, | suppose, how | got the job, although it was\nunpaid. But it was good training for me had | ever gone into that field, which | don't\nthink | would have under normal circumstances. So | was home only over the\nweekend.",
        "Q: Were there any anti-Semitic incidents that you were aware of, particular to you, at\nthat time besides the general restrictions? The non-Jews that you came in contact\nwith were still pleasant to you?",
        "A: No, they were nothing at all. You know, they did not -- they were not in touch with\nme. Like my school friends. | never heard from them. And we were forbidden to have\ntelephones, so we could telephone only from a neighboring store that had a\ntelephone, but only at certain hours. Because Jews were not allowed to go into those\nshops, except from 2:00 to 3:00, or whatever it was. So if you had to make a\ntelephone call, you had to make it during those certain hours. And | remember\nmeeting one of my classmates in such a store and being afraid what she would do\nor say. But she didn\u2019t do or say anything. She just make-believe she didn\u2019t see me.",
        "Q: When you were working at the textile factory, were there non-Jews with you?\nDoris Rauch 11\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 11",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And what were--",
        "A: Mostly non-Jews. They were very nice. They were Czech peasants. Moravian\npeasants. There was no -- | didn\u2019t feel any anti-Semitism. In fact, some of those\npeople came to town on weekends and came to visit us in the apartment and brought\nfood from the country for us. So no, | didn\u2019t suffer there.",
        "Q: Were you on food rationing at that point?",
        "A: | think so, yes. But | don't really remember -- yes, | think we were. Because |\nremember, you know, going shopping to those stores during certain hours and having\nthose ration cards with me.",
        "Q: So what did you do on the weekend when you would come home from the textile\nfactory?",
        "A: See my friends. Or my uncle, my mother\u2019s brother, who will figure a lot in this\ninterview, | think --",
        "Q: What is his name?",
        "A: Norbert Troller (ph). He and | were the only ones who survived the war. And he\nwas in Auschwitz. He was but he made it. My uncle had a\nweekend house in the country. So we sometimes went there. We still could go hiding,\nyou know. As long as we kept within the hours allowed to us.",
        "Q: Did you have a radio?",
        "A: Yes, we had a radio. We had a radio when, | think we rented a radio when my\nfather was so sick for a whole year. But then we had a radio when Hitler was already\noccupying us, which we inherited from a relative who immigrated. And | remember\nDoris Rauch 12\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 12\nsitting in front of it and hearing about in our time. But it didn't get to me. |\nwas SO --",
        "Q: Were you aware of the invasion of Poland in September of 1939?",
        "A: Yes, of course. And their outbreak of the war. Yes, naturally.",
        "Q: Now, you were a young woman of 19.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you recall any thoughts that you had at that point? Was it a very fearful time\nfor you?",
        "A: Yes it was because one was always afraid what was coming next. You see, and\nwe knew about things in Germany and in Austria. But there it went much slower. It\ntook some time after this or that. Whereas with us, it all came pretty fast. All the\n, all the restriction, all came very fast.",
        "Q: What was the next change then? You had finished the work in the textile factory\nand then --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What was the next development?",
        "A: That was the end, | think. | worked. That\u2019s about all that was left to me. | went to\ntake care in the afternoon, after, of a group of children who were, | don\u2019t know, maybe\nfour children. And | went hiking with them. | did their schoolwork.",
        "Q: Are we talking about 1939?",
        "A: Yeah. And long -- | don\u2019t know how long | did that -- as long as it was possible.\nThey were a family of several sisters and only two husbands, | think. They all had\nchildren and | did the schoolwork with them and | went sledding with them.\nDoris Rauch 13\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 13",
        "Q: These were Jewish children?",
        "A: Jewish children. They all went to Theresienstadt, too, but | don\u2019t know that any of\nthem survived.",
        "Q: So 1939 continued on. Now it\u2019s winter, 1940. Any particular --",
        "A: | can't really say exactly what happened in winter 1940. | know in December 1941.",
        "Q: So your life went on, in a sense, in the same way. And_ -- how was your health at\nthat time? 1940, 1941.",
        "A: Oh, health was okay.",
        "Q: And the food situation?",
        "A: Was not so good. But my mother, and | think most people were able to get things\non the black market, like coffee for instance. There was no real coffee. But we were\nable to get some black coffee. Um cigarettes. | was smoking by then unfortunately.",
        "Q: And you were still soeaking German with your mother?",
        "A: | was still speaking German with my mother. In fact, my mother -- you know, her\nCzech was, it was called , which means Kitchen Czech. She just could\ntalk Czech with the maids -- with the maid, we had only one.",
        "Q: You've been talking about 1940 and \u201841 and how did conditions change even\nmore?",
        "A: There was less food to be had. And | guess, the hours were shorter and we were\n-- the hours we could shop were shorter. And you couldn't sit on the park bench\nbecause it said there, \u201cNot for Jews.\u201d You couldn't go to a coffee house or a\nrestaurant. It was all forbidden to Jews. So you\u2019d spend most of your time doing your\nDoris Rauch 14\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 14\nchores and being at home and shopping when you could or visiting friends when you\ncould.",
        "Q: What did you and your friends talk about during this time of terrible restriction?",
        "A: | don\u2019t remember. | know we couldn't go -- we loved movies; we couldn't go to\nmovies anymore. But we could read. | remember reading Gone with the Wind, day\nand night.",
        "Q: In what language?",
        "A: In German, of course. And, | guess we talked about boys. Oh, | never talked about\nTom Shtunda (ph), that was a very important part of our life in normal times, you\nknow. We had so-called dancing lessons, but what it really was was -- we didn't learn\nto dance. Somehow, we knew how to dance and that\u2019s where you met boys. Get\ndates with boys.",
        "Q: Did that continue on in 1940?",
        "A: The dates as far as people and young men were still there continued, but not the\ndancing classes.",
        "Q: Well now, it\u2019s 1941.",
        "A: And then the deportation started. And we had -- | remember we had a poor Jewish\nlady who came to us for the midday meal, which was the main meal, every week. It\nwas sort of immensurate (ph), if you Know what | mean. And she was one of the first\nwho had to go because she was not a Czech citizen. Maybe she was from Germany\nor Austria, | don\u2019t know. She had to -- she went to Poland with the first transport.\nThen, | don\u2019t Know, but it was in the same transport and a cousin of my mother\u2019s,\none of the owners of the fur business, where my father later worked, he and his two\nDoris Rauch 15\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 15\ndaughters -- the mother was no longer alive -- were also sent to Poland, which was\nunheard of because he was very well-to-do. And why they had to go, | don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You knew that they were being taken to Poland?",
        "A: That's what they said; that\u2019s what we were told. And then, Theresienstadt was\nfounded and my mother\u2019s oldest brother, the one where we used to have our\n, and his family, which consisted of his wife and three children -- no, no.\nThe youngest son had immigrated to England, but the two older sons were still at\nhome. They were sent away, we didn't know where.",
        "Q: What month in \u201841 was the first transport in Berdenau.",
        "A: | think in November. But December came and it was our turn. And we had no idea\nwhere we were going. But we went to Theresienstadct.",
        "Q: Okay. Let's talk a little bit about that. How did you know? How were you called\nup?",
        "A: Some time before that, we had to register at the Jewish Community. All Jews had\nto register. | don\u2019t know ff all did, but we did. Most Jews did. And the way we learned\nabout it was that you got some sort of printed paper under the door where you were\ncalled for a certain day to a school. That\u2019s where we all were assembled. And they\ntaught you exactly how much, what you can take. | think it was 50 kilos if I\u2019m not\nmistaken. And you were allowed to take blankets, you know, feather blankets. And a\npail, | guess for washing the floor, but that\u2019s what we were allowed to. And | remember\nmy mother packing for this trip and putting a whole little pail again of jam into that pail\nand covering it up with other things. And | was very upset about it. | thought they\nwould catch her with that and we would be punished. It was very cowardly. But\nDoris Rauch 16\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 16\nfortunately, my mother wasn't and it was a very good thing that she brought the pail\nof jam. And you know, friends who rested (ph) in here came to help us. And |\nremember a class-- a Jewish classmate of mine who had learned to be a -- what is\nit? It\u2019s my age; | can\u2019t think of what -- a pollster. He came and sewed for us something\nto cover those feather beds. We each had something -- it was a handle so that we\ncould carry. And the housekeeper and someone else came to -- you must know that\nin our bathroom, you had to heat a huge stove. Stove?",
        "Q: A heater of water? A water heater?",
        "A: But it wasn't gas. You had to use a____ in coal | guess. And she came and\nattended to the stove so that we all could take a bath, the ones who had to go. And\nthe people were very kind and helped out. You know, things that you could possibly\nuse were immediately sold out, like flashlights. You know, we all wanted to take\nflashlights, so it was very hard to get them. Things like that that you could possibly\nuse. And so we ran this in the school -- Well, first of all, | have to say that -- not\ntransport -- that we had to walk to the school at night, when it was dark, so that the\npopulation wouldn't see it. And then we spent | think three days in the school, where\nwe were registered and the SS was already in there, or the Gestapo, | don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: What was the name of the school? Do you remember?",
        "A: Yes. No, the name | don't know. But the street (ph), it was Merhout.",
        "Q: And about how many people?",
        "A: You know, | don't remember, but probably a thousand. Transports usually were a\nthousand, but I\u2019m really not sure about that.",
        "Q: So you stayed there for three days.\nDoris Rauch 17\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 17",
        "A: We stayed there --",
        "Q: Where did you sleep?",
        "A: On the floor. And we young ones helped with the luggage, you know, to get it up\nthe stairs because | think it was a three-story school.",
        "Q: What about food?",
        "A: You know, | don\u2019t remember anything about it, whether they fed us or not. | don\u2019t\nknow. | just remember then, on the third day, early in the morning, we had to stand\nat attention in the courtyard there. It was still dark. And then, again, we walked to the\ntrain, which left from the usual station. | don\u2019t know how the -- well, it was night. And\n| guess no other trains left.",
        "Q: These were regular train cars?",
        "A: These were regular train cars, yes. And on the way, we somehow learned that we\nwere going to Theresienstadt.",
        "Q: Did you know what that meant then?",
        "A: | don't think so. Of course, my mother\u2019s older brother was already there. But they\nwere not allowed to write. So | don't think we knew it.",
        "Q: How long a trip was it?",
        "A: | think it took days, if I\u2019m not mistaken. | don\u2019t know why. Maybe it didn\u2019t. | really\ndon't remember. But we were really one of the earliest transports, so we left behind\neverything we had left. The furniture, the --",
        "Q: Were people calm on this train ride to Theresienstadt?",
        "A: | have no recollection. | think | was calm. But only because | was young, you know.\n| didn\u2019t -- we had no idea what was in store for us. And | mean almost also of those\nDoris Rauch 18\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 18\nthree and a half years when | was in Persna (ph), | always thought it would be better\nin the next place. So optimism helps, | think, but it\u2019s the optimism of youth.",
        "Q: So you arrived at Theresienstadt.",
        "A: We arrived at Theresienstadt and were put into barracks, you know.",
        "Q: You and your mother were still together.",
        "A: Yes. We were still together. And first, we were in the smaller room. | think we were\nthe first people in this particular barracks.",
        "Q: Did the barrack have a number or--",
        "A: A name. They called it , which was a spelling for -- in English, it\u2019s\nThe Raisin, isn\u2019t it? So it was called Dresdner Barracks. And this was strictly women\u2019s\nbarracks. The men lived in the Sudatin barracks.",
        "Q: And about how many women were in your barrack with you?",
        "A: Well, really, | think we were the first -- no, we couldn't have been the first transport\nbecause my aunt was already there, the wife of my mother\u2019s oldest brother. | don't\nknow -- | think there was room for 3,000 people. There were 3,000 when the barracks\nwere filled. But in the beginning, there were not many people. And we picked the\nsmaller room. There were maybe ten people in there.",
        "Q: Now when you came there, you were with your mother. Were you with any other\nrelatives or friends? Or was it just the two of you?",
        "A: | think it was just the two of us. And of course we came to know all the others who\nwere there.",
        "Q: And what did you do in the beginning?\nDoris Rauch 19\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 19",
        "A: Nothing, | think. We just made it as comfortable as possible with our blankets and\nwe slept on the floor, of course. And I'll tell you a typical story for me. One day, things\nstarted to disappear from our luggage. And we couldn't understand it -- or | certainly\ncouldn't understand it. And | remember asking my mother, \u201cMother, do you think that\nJews steal?\u201d | couldn't imagine that Jews would steal one from the other. | learned\nmuch better later on. But | eventually worked in the post office. You will laugh about\nthe post office. It was like that in the first few months at Theresienstadt. The Czechs\nbelieved in the town. And we were in the barracks and were not allowed out. But\nthere were some people who were allowed out, like the guard -- not guards. They\nwere the ghetto policemen who watched over each barracks. And they could go to\ntheir administration | think. There were certain people who were allowed out. But |\nthink June 1942, the Czechs still lived in their houses there. Then they were\nevacuated and then the ghetto was opened, you know. Then we could go out. But\nwe left soon after that so | didn\u2019t experience that. But as long as we were confined to\nthe barracks, | worked. Every barracks had a post office, which was a room. And\nsince the men were separated from their wives and children, they wrote letters to\neach other. Or the husbands sent dirty laundry to their wives to wash.",
        "Q: From the men\u2019s barrack to the women\u2019s barrack.",
        "A: To the women\u2019s barrack. Or the women sent the clean laundry back. And if\nsomeone had two extra potatoes, he could send it to his wife or his children and so\non. And that was -- that kept me busy. And | met a lot of people that way because |\nhad to go and distribute. | had to put the room numbers on the letters and then\ndistribute them. And my mother worked -- | just saw that, I\u2019d forgotten it, but when |\nDoris Rauch 20\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 20\nstarted reading the letter, she worked in the office of the -- each barracks had a\nJewish commander. And she worked in the office for him. And we later on moved to\na different room where his wife was also in that room. So maybe that\u2019s how she got\nthe job. | don\u2019t remember that. And of course, there was not much food. And they\ngave us soup made from -- | don\u2019t know what that is. You know, it\u2019s like -- it\u2019s a\nvegetable and it\u2019s big.",
        "Q: Turnips?",
        "A: Turnips. Yeah. They were orange. Everything was made with turnips, which in\nCzechoslovakia they were used to feed the cattle, the pigs. You must have learned\nabout turnips in your other interviews. And we got a piece of bread and sometimes\nmargarine, sometimes jam.",
        "Q: Whatever happened with the jam that your mother put in the pail.",
        "A: | guess we ate it in the course of time.",
        "Q: And so you stayed in Theresienstadt for six months.",
        "A: No, then | still went. | voluntarily went to a place in Bohemia where they needed\npeople to plant trees.",
        "Q: Now when was this?",
        "A: This was from Theresienstadt, maybe in May. May of \u201842. I\u2019m not sure it was May,\nbut | think so. And | didn't tell my mother, but when she heard this and | told her\neventually, she volunteered to go along on the transport because she felt we\nshouldn't be separated, which we later were.",
        "Q: So the two of you left in May.\nDoris Rauch 21\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 21",
        "A: We left in May and we were there for maybe six weeks. And in a way, it was a\nvery fortunate thing because we wrote to some of our friends who were still there --",
        "Q: Still in Theresienstadt?",
        "A: No, still in Czechoslovakia, not yet in Theresienstadt. You see, it took some time\nafter they got all the Jews in Czechoslovakia to Theresienstadt. And we did this so,\nyou know, everyday we went for supper to an inn in the country. There were various\nplaces in Bohemia where we did this work. But in that place where | was with my\nmother, we went to supper everyday to a certain inn. And there we talk to the owner\nof the inn and asked him whether it would be alright if we had a package sent to him,\nto his address. And we always told the people to whom we wrote what name to write\nus, to send a -- by then, we recognized which was for us, you know? Because other\npeople did the same thing. And so we collected quite a bit of food, which we brought\nback to Theresienstadt.",
        "Q: Okay, now what kind of work did you do for six weeks? You planted trees?",
        "A: Trees, yeah.",
        "Q: Was that hard work?",
        "A: For us, it wasn't so hard, for the young people, you know. But for my mother it was\nvery hard. And the man in charge of us was very nasty to her and kept talking about\nthe old can't do her work and so on. So that was hard. But she took it in\nher stride. And so, we came back to Theresienstadt. In the meantime, my uncle\nNorbert Troller had arrived there. And | don\u2019t know if he was there when we left or\nnot, | don\u2019t know. But anyhow, he had lost so much weight. He had always been a\nDoris Rauch 22\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 22\nroly poly, you know. And he was terribly thin and of course, we were very happy to\nhave brought that food in to contribute to his subsistence. He became stronger again.",
        "Q: Now your back at Theresienstadt.",
        "A: Now we are back at Theresienstadt in June. As | said, the Czechs were evacuated\nand then, in the meantime, there were more and more people coming of course.\nThere was, for instance, a transport from Vienna where a sister of my grandmother's\nwas in there. And it was just terrible for the old people. There was no room anymore\nand they put them in the cellars and--",
        "Q: Did you know that she was there?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You did know.",
        "A: Yes, we did know she was there.",
        "Q: How did you know this? How did you find out? Word of mouth?",
        "A: Probably word of mouth, yeah. By that time, we were allowed to go out, and so\nwe went to visit her. She died soon after that, fortunately. But by that time,\nTheresienstadt was full, full of people from everywhere. Germany, and also, | don\u2019t\nremember that, but | remember this old aunt, Tanta Fritzen (ph). Also, my favorite\naunt, you know, the one | told you about who was left in Berdenau, and all her family\nwas gone. She came to Theresienstadt, too, and she became a nurse there.",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: Amie (ph) Weiner. And | loved her almost as much as my father, much more than\nmy mother. So | was very happy she was there.",
        "Q: So this was your father\u2019s sister.\nDoris Rauch 23\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 23",
        "A: My father\u2019s older sister.",
        "Q: What else do you remember about the summer of 1942 at Theresienstadt?",
        "A: Transports left for the East all the time. We had no idea where they were going. It\nwas a rumor it was to Poland, but we didn't really Know. And the most important thing\nin Theresienstadt laws, to have connections to get out of a transport, not to have to\ngo. Because there at least, we knew what we had. And we did not know what was\nwaiting for us. So mother and | got into transport twice, | think. And once, | had a\nboyfriend there who was a ghetto policeman. And he said that we were engaged,\nwhich we were not. And ghetto policemen could save people. So he saved us that\ntime, or at least, | think it was him. We don't really know. And then, | think there was\na second time where possibly my uncle, Norry (ph) is his name, saved us because\nhe was in the technical department. He was an architect. And the technical\ndepartment had a lot of clout. And so he said that my mother was his sister and we\ncouldn't possibly go. And so we didn't go. But the third time, it didn\u2019t work anymore,\nand... You want me to tell you something about Theresienstadt?",
        "Q: Well, did you do any work over the summer?",
        "A: Yes, | was again in the post office.",
        "Q: Oh, you went back to the post office.",
        "A: Back to the post office, yes.",
        "Q: And a minimal amount of food.",
        "A: Minimal amount of food. One unusual thing in Theresienstadt was that they made\ndumplings, Czech dumplings, which I\u2019m sure did not exist in any other concentration\nDoris Rauch 24\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 24\ncamp. And that was always day of joy when they made dumplings. They were so big,\nyou know, and inside was jam. And of course, we were very happy about that.",
        "Q: Did you go back to your -- did you live in the same room?",
        "A: In the same room. Well no. Maybe, you know. Maybe it was in between the first\nroom and the second room. | really don\u2019t remember, but altogether we were only in\ntwo rooms, my mother and I.",
        "Q: Did people eat in a central location?",
        "A: No, no. You ate in your room.",
        "Q: In your room.",
        "A: You sat on your mattress on the floor, and that\u2019s where you -- you had to stand in\nline to get your food. Each barracks had a kitchen. And that\u2019s where you stood in line\nto get your food or to get your bread, whatever you got.",
        "Q: What was a typical breakfast in Theresienstadt?",
        "A: It was something they called coffee, but it was just brown water, and a piece of\nbread which had to last you all day long.",
        "Q: And then lunch was. . .",
        "A: Lunch was | think -- lunch was the main meal, so it must have been that horrible\nsoup. What is the name of the vegetable?",
        "Q: Turnip.",
        "A: Yeah, turnip soup. And bread again.",
        "Q: And then dinner?",
        "A: And then dinner? It was again turnip soup and bread, and maybe that\u2019s when we\ngot the dumpling, or maybe it was at lunch, | don\u2019t know.\nDoris Rauch 25\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 25",
        "Q: How often was dumpling day? Once a week?",
        "A: Once a week perhaps.",
        "Q: And what was the sanitary facilities like in your barracks?",
        "A: Well, there was a big sort of washroom. Since it was the barracks for soldiers,\nthere were maybe 20 spigots there where you washed with cold water. And you\nknow, | don\u2019t remember anything about the toilets. They must have had lots of toilets.\nAnyhow, | don\u2019t remember any hardship with toilets there. And at least we had plenty\nof cold water. The funny thing was that, you know in Europe, people put their bedding\ninto the windows to air out. Everyone does, all over Europe. And we did it, even in\nTheresienstadt because there were sort of, what do you call them?",
        "Q: Archway?",
        "A: Yes. Arches. There was a walkway to the various rooms and then those archways.\nAnd we put our bedding out there to air every morning. Maybe that\u2019s why we didn't\nhave ___ or lice. Because later, we had that too.",
        "Q: You said your health was okay, still, at that point.",
        "A: Yes. Our health was okay.",
        "Q: Alright. And so the summer is over and now it\u2019s September 1st.",
        "A: Yeah, or a few days before then. We got the summons that we had to go. And my\nboss in the post office, he was the head over all administration post office. And he\nsaid that he knew the man who was the guy, the top man on the transport. And he\nwould tell him about me, that if he needed any help, a secretary or whatever, that he\nrecommended me. And then we were put into a separate barracks, those who went\non the transport, and where they, again, | think for three days. And my mother met\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nDoris Rauch 26\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 26\nsome distant relative whom she hadn't seen for years and years, who had a\ndaughter. And she introduced us. And then that also prompted a boyfriend there with\nwhom | thought | fell in love. But | think it was just leaning on someone, you know.\nAnd then we started. We were loaded into the train. | have no recollection how we\ngot to the train. We must have walked, but | can\u2019t imagine that we carried all the\nluggage.\nEnd of Tape One\nDoris Rauch 27\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 27\nTape Two",
        "Q: We were talking about your being called up in September 1942. And you were\ntaken out of your barracks, and for three days, in a different location, with your\nmother.",
        "A: And then we were loaded on the train and travelled northeast, | guess. We had no\nidea where we were because the train, in the beginning, never stopped, or maybe |\nwas too involved with my boyfriend to pay attention where we were going. But |\nremember we stopped in Riga which is the capitol of Latvia.",
        "Q: Was this a regular train?",
        "A: This was a regular train, not a freight train -- not that other persons were on the --\nno. What do you mean by regular --?",
        "Q: Yeah, you were sitting on benches?",
        "A: Yes. We were sitting on benches. And we stopped here and there and they\ndistributed some food and water which we had gotten along from Theresienstadt.\nAnd so that we had something to eat and we had something to drink. And | remember\nat one of those stops, | saw a woman in a white nursing uniform with a red cross on\nher cap, distributing water. And she was blonde and blue-eyed and | thought, \u201cThat\nmust be someone from the Swedish Red Cross.\u201d As it turned out later, | was with her\nin camp for a long time and she was from my home town. | had never seen her\nbefore. She had a very Scandinavian name; her name was Inga (ph) Sylten. But she\nwas Jewish. And so, yes, my mother, who as | told you was a very smart, wrote a\npostcard to someone at home and threw it out of the window, hoping someone would\nDoris Rauch 28\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 28\nget it. Whether someone got it, | don\u2019t know. And even-- as | told you, we stopped in\nRiga, and word got around that they wanted us to get out there. But we did not.",
        "Q: Were you ever allowed off the train during the journey?",
        "A: No, no. | guess there were toilets. | don\u2019t remember. No, were never allowed off\nthe train except for the people who came around with the food and the water and so\non. They went outside train. And so we went on from Riga. And the whole thing took\nfive days and five nights, that | know. And finally we came to a small station, which\nas it turned out later was in Estonia. Estonia is the northern-most of the three bounty\ncountries (ph). And there were some SS men out there and we all got out of the train-\n- No, before we got out of the train, they came in and they distributed postcards. And\nthey said that we could write home; that we were working in agricultural environment,\nand that we are fine. So we all did this. Whether they ever sent it, | don\u2019t know. But\njust imagine that they think up something like that just for shame, you know.",
        "Q: Do you remember who you addressed it to?",
        "A: No. No idea. My mother did it, I\u2019m sure. Maybe | did it too. | don\u2019t remember. So\nthen, we got out of the train. And those SS men were standing there telling some to\ngo where blue, light blue buses were standing. They told them to go there. And some\nthey picked out, mostly young people, and said that they should help unload the\nluggage.",
        "Q: Now what city is this? Where are you?",
        "A: It\u2019s not even a city. It's a small place called Raasiku.",
        "Q: This is in Estonia?\nDoris Rauch 29\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 29",
        "A: In Estonia, yeah. And the men were, | think, mostly Estonian SS because we saw\nthem later. They were Estonian. But there were some Germans there too. And so |\nwas picked out to help with the luggage. And my mother was sent on ahead. And we\neach had in our hand a pillow, a pillowcase, to which was folded the fur from our--we\ncame to Theresienstadt with a cold and the fur lining, which could be buttoned in. So\nthis was summer, so the fur lining was out, and it was in those two pillows. And my\nmother went ahead, and then | ran after her and gave her my pillow and said, \u201cLook,\n| will have to work and we'll meet later. You take both.\u201d And they told us that they\nwould meet those people who go in buses later on in the camp. So we helped\nunloading the luggage, which | don\u2019t remember having done, but | must have done\nit. And then they put the luggage and us on trucks. And we drove and came into the\nwoods; and there was like a camp there, wooden barracks. About five wooden\nbarracks with the -- you should have come five years earlier when | still could think\nof words.",
        "Q: It will come to you later. That\u2019s fine.",
        "A: Yeah. Surrounded by barbed wire and towers with soldiers up there with guns.\nAnd | had some hand luggage. And | went into -- | saw that there was a line of people\nlined up in front of one of those barracks. But | went to another barrack and put my\nhand luggage there.",
        "Q: What the transport made up of men and women?",
        "A: Men and women, yes.",
        "Q: Were there any young children?\nDoris Rauch 30\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 30",
        "A: Yes. There were children. And they picked out about -- | would say about 50\nwomen and 50 men. Only the men did not come with us. | don\u2019t know what -- they\ncame into a different camp, but around there too because once, we were allowed to\nsee them. So | left my hand luggage in the barrack, but | myself, stupid as | am, |\nwent into the line where the other people stood in line to get into this one barrack. |\nhad no idea what that was. And when my turn came, it was pitch dark in the barrack.\nAnd there those SS men who made us undress and do all sorts of gymnastics. They\nwent through what -- | probably had a purse, you know, and they found various things\nin there that they wanted to have. Took them out. Then we had to exercise so if we\nhad anything in our vagina that it would fall out. And it was pretty awful, you Know, to\nundress completely in front of those men. But there was nothing we could do. So\nthen, when we got through, we just walked out -- got dressed and walked out and\nwent into the barrack where | had left my luggage. You know, if | had just stayed\nthere, | probably wouldn't have had to go through all that. But that\u2019s how naive | was.\nSo then they unloaded all the luggage and put it in another barrack. And then we\nlived in this barrack -- yeah, our families were not there. So we asked them, \u201cYou\nsaid we would meet our families here.\u201d And they said, \u201cWell, we sent them to a camp\nthat is heatable\u201d (It was September, you know.) \u201cso they wouldn't freeze in winter.\u201d",
        "Q: Were you with anybody you knew at that point?",
        "A: No. Only this one young girl -- remember, my mother had met a relative in the\nseparate barracks there? She was only 15 or 16 years old. | was 22. Not yet 22. No,\nyes, just 22. She was the only one. And there were some girls there -- there were\nmostly young girls -- who cried terribly because they were separated from their\nDoris Rauch 31\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 31\nfamilies. And most of us couldn't understand that. Why were they sent there and the\ncamp had deceived them? We were going to see them again. So we lived for | don't\nknow how many years, two years or more, thinking we would see our families again.\nWe never heard about gassing or shooting. We had never heard about anything like\nthat. So we spent our time unpacking the luggage. You know that it didn\u2019t occur to\nus, \u201cHow come-- what do the other people wear whose luggage it is?\u201d It didn\u2019t occur\nto -- or at least not to me. And of course, we had the advantage that if we found\nsomething we could use, we took it. But there was also from the luggage jewelry that\nwe gave to the Germans, and money. You know | told you, in the dark barrack how\nhe took things out of my pocketbook. For instance, | had -- it was a pencil, you know\nlike an automatic pencil? But it was a much thicker pencil which my uncle had given\nme. He used it in his work as and architect. And he had given me that with rolled up\nmoney in there. They took it. So they must have known that people hide things. So\nthen, you know, the clothes had to be sorted into, | don\u2019t know, dresses and shoes\nand whatever. And those SS people took them away by and by. But we found food\nthere, too, so we cooked for ourselves, you know, we found alcohol stoves on which\nwe could cook. And we just used them. And we found our own things, of course,\nwhich came in very handy later on because we exchanged them for food with the\npeasants and other people in Estonia so that we were not as starved as most people.",
        "Q: So you lived in this first barrack that you came and put your --",
        "A: where | had put my bag down.",
        "Q: How big a barrack was it?\nDoris Rauch 32\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 32",
        "A: Mmm. | don\u2019t know. There were about 50 of us. And you know, there were two\nwooden platforms -- downstairs and upstairs -- and we lived --",
        "Q: That's where you slept, on the platform.",
        "A: That\u2019s where we lived, that\u2019s where we cooked. We just did all of it there. That was\nlike our home. And people formed group. And | formed a group, | think, with this 16-\nyear-old girl.",
        "Q: What was the youngest age there? Do you remember?",
        "A: That was the youngest.",
        "Q: She was the youngest.",
        "A: She was the youngest and we christened her \u201cBaby,\u201d Baby Nada (ph) we called\nher. She still had the name. She lives in Israel. Her husband doesn't like it at all that\nwe call her that. So you know, gradually, friendships developed and certain people\nmoved in together and cooked together and shared everything.",
        "Q: Did you do any work?",
        "A: Only the sorting -- unpacking and sorting --",
        "Q: Was your work.",
        "A: Was our work, yes.",
        "Q: And you said you were there for two years?",
        "A: No, no. Not in that camp.",
        "Q: Oh, oh, okay.",
        "A: No. We were -- | then was -- of course the Germans, or the SS elected -- not\nelected, but stipulated a leader of the group of us. And she happened to be a\nschizophrenic individual, | think. And for instance, she picked -- there was to go a\nDoris Rauch 33\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 33\ntransport for work to an acre place, and | was picked because | spoke\nGerman. So she was against German speakers. There were about 25 or 30 of us\nwho were sent on the transport. The others stayed in the barracks and still worked\nwith the luggage, you know? And that was pretty tough because we didn\u2019t get enough\nto eat and we had to work very hard.",
        "Q: Where were you sent to?",
        "A: It was in the coun-- you want to know the name? | can find it if you want.",
        "Q: But was this a permanent move or just a temporary move?",
        "A: No, it was just a temporary one.",
        "Q: Oh, to go and work and then come back.",
        "A: Yeah, but we took everything we had, which wasn\u2019t much, along. And it was sort\nof --",
        "Q: What kind of work did you do there?",
        "A: We harvested potatoes and carrots. And there was a man who supervised us who\nhad a --",
        "Q: Whip?",
        "A: A whip, yes.",
        "Q: The clothes you were wearing were the clothes that you brought from home\noriginally?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That\u2019s what you were wearing.",
        "A: That's what we were wearing.",
        "Q: Were you still wearing a scarf?\nDoris Rauch 34\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 34",
        "A: | don\u2019t know if we did there or not. | don\u2019t think so. | know that when we later came\nto Reval, which is Tallinn today, they made us take off the scarves. So maybe we still\nhad them. Because they didn\u2019t want the population of Tallinn to know who we were.\nAnd so we were there, | think, harvesting for about six weeks. It was really back-\nbreaking work which we were not used to.",
        "Q: And then you came back.",
        "A: Then we came back, and they separated us to a different barrack. We were not to\nhave been in touch with the others who had stayed there, like if we were paryas (ph).\nAnd so we were still in the barrack in winter. And we didn't do any work, except that\nthey took us out about once a day to collect wood in the woods there for burning in\nour stove. And they brought us food, whatever there was. | don\u2019t remember, that at\nall. And | was made to be in charge -- oh, | forgot -- of this particular group in the\nbarracks because he remembered my name \u2018cause they had once caught -- | forgot\nto tell you, you know, when we -- | told you we met a man once, the men who went\non our transport were in a different camp, but close by. They let us get together one\nday, one Sunday, so that some of the girls saw their fathers and their brothers. And\n| saw my boyfriend and then | discovered a very good friend of my father\u2019s, you know,\naman probably in his fifties, whose wife had probably gone with my mother. But they\nhad picked him so he must have looked pretty healthy. And when | saw him walking\nby later, | threw him a package with socks and things | had from food to that | had\nfound in the luggage there. And this one of those SS men remember me because of\nthat, because | was caught, you know? And he was caught, but they didn\u2019t do\nanything to us. But he remembered me. And that's why he made -- he remember my\nDoris Rauch 35\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 35\nname and he put me in charge of the people in this barracks we had come back from\nwork. Now I\u2019m the least likely person to lead a group and | know | always had to find\nsomeone who would clean the toilets. | remember the toilets there. And no one\nwanted to do it. And so in the end, | said I\u2019d do it. That\u2019s how much of a leader | was.\nSo we were there, back in the woods, and then they said we were going to Tallinn,\nwhich was Reval then. And we would work in making clothes, you know, like a\nmanufacturer of coats or dresses or whatever, which was an absolute lie. But that\u2019s\nwhat they said. And they took us -- now those were most -- | forgot to say something\nagain. | think that happened while we were in on the potato farms that\nanother transport came from Germany, from Berlin and Frankfurt. And they again\npicked out the young people. And -- mostly young, there were a few older men among\nus. And so they moved in with those other people. And then the call came for us to\ngo to Reval, and there were some of the Germans went and we went in separate\nbarrack, in the red barrack. And they brought us to the police. And we stayed in the\npolitical , In Reval.",
        "Q: Okay. What month was this that you left --",
        "A: This was, | think, December.",
        "Q: Of \u201842.",
        "A: Of \u201842, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. And how far away was Reval from where you were? Not far?",
        "A: Not very far because | don\u2019t remember how far it was then, but | was there in 1992.\nThe barracks don't exist anymore, but the place where my mother -- where all the\nfamilies were shot is there, and it\u2019s not too far.\nDoris Rauch 36\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 36",
        "Q: Not too far.",
        "A: It\u2019s maybe half an hour. So let\u2019s say this was perhaps an hour.",
        "Q: Oh, | see.",
        "A: And --",
        "Q: So you just walked there?",
        "A: No, no. On trucks.",
        "Q: On trucks.",
        "A: No one ever tried to run away. | mean later on some tried but not seriously. So\nthere, they put us to work for a German construction firm by the name of -- | know\nthe name very well -- Holzmann. And the head of that -- well, let me tell you about\nthe prison first. We were in rather modern cells where we were ten people to a cell.",
        "Q: Ten women?",
        "A: Ten women, yes. And there were only seven beds there. The beds were just --\nthey could be -- they were made out of metal and canvas, and then --",
        "Q: Could be folded up?",
        "A: Folded up to the wall. So there were seven beds and ten people. Then there was\na cabinet there to put our things. And then in one corner, we had our , YOU\nknow. So, we're also very fair, you see. We changed beds. Always different people\nhad to -- one had to sleep on the cabinet. No, yes. And two on the floor, one on the\nluggage and one on the floor and several in the beds. But we always took turns. And\nin the morning, the guards came -- they were women. And throwing the raw fish\nheads on the floor that we were supposed to eat for breakfast. And then again some\nbrown water that was the coffee, and | think a piece of bread, either in the morning,\nDoris Rauch 37\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 37\nor we got it in the evening, | don\u2019t remember. So with that we were supposed to do\nhard labor in the harbor, in the port. And we were tearing down -- see the Russians\nhad attacked Estonia -- was it -- first a Jew-- no. The Russians had attacked Estonia\nand the harbor was in disrepair, all the barracks, whatever, the little houses, they had\n-- it was all kaput (ph). And so this firm of Holzmann was charged with rebuilding the\nharbor. And on the first day, when we went to work, the man in charge of Holzmann,\nhis name was Gr . He was a not very tall man with a red beard and red hair.\nHe had us a long speech saying that if one tried to escape, that ten would be shot.\nSo that put us in our place. And every morning, some man from the firm came to get\nus out of the prison and march us to the harbor, which was not very far.",
        "Q: What kind of work did you do?",
        "A: We did -- some of us, you know, create the . And then we worked on. .",
        "Q: Piers?",
        "A: Well some of us work with a diver, with a German diver who -- | don\u2019t know, maybe\nhe -- | don\u2019t Know what he was looking for. But he was diving and they had to keep\nhim alive. Most of those men were pretty good to us. And then there were some\nPolish men too. They were the so-called Folks Deutsche (ph). They made believe\nthat they were German-speaking, but some of them were not. They didn\u2019t know\nGerman. They -- some of them were pretty anti-Semitic. But altogether, they were\nnot really anti-Semitic and | think it had to do with the fact that we were all young girls\nand pretty good-looking. So most of them treated us alright. And one of them was\nalso from Frankfurt. He was in charge of the whole group. And he picked out some\nDoris Rauch 38\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 38\ngirls who came from Frankfurt, and really was like a father to them. And brought them\nfood and let them do all sorts of things. And -- after the war, he still came to New York\nto visit them. He\u2019s dead now. But he was pretty decent.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Hohmann.",
        "Q: So, now you said you --",
        "A: We cleared the way to the harbor. Some of us___\u2014_\u2014__. Then we had to unload\ntrucks with building stones -- not -- help me with the word. You know what | mean.",
        "Q: Building blocks?",
        "A: Building blocks, yes. Something like that.",
        "Q: And you still had energy? You were able to do this even though your diet was so\npoor?",
        "A: Well, let me tell you, the Germans later on gave us an extra meal because they\nreally needed us. So we got some extra food from them. And then, as | said, we\nexchanged things that we still had for butter and bread and eggs and whatever we\ncould get. Some of the girls learned how to -- bricks is the word | was looking for --\nhow to --",
        "Q: Lay bricks?",
        "A: Lay bricks, yes. And there were all sorts of --",
        "Q: And how long did you stay there?",
        "A: | think we stayed for at least a year.",
        "Q: A year. Doing this kind of work.\nDoris Rauch 39\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 39",
        "A: Doing this kind of work. And | remember one day, when it was minus 28 Celsius,\nwhich is very cold, so that even the Germans were not really to go to work, and we\ndidn\u2019t have to go to work. So that was very nice.",
        "Q: And you -- what about your shoes? Did you have good shoes?",
        "A: Well, some of us did and some of us didn\u2019t anymore. But we also tried to exchange\nthings we had for shoes. Whatever we needed, we tried to find someone who would\ndo that.",
        "Q: So, again, you were still pretty healthy.",
        "A: We were still pretty healthy. My health didn't break down until in Hamburg. But the\n-- no, no, no, that\u2019s not true. In the next camp. So, yes, comparatively healthy, we\nwere really.",
        "Q: So you kept living in the barracks and working all day long. Was it a long day?",
        "A: No, we lived in the prison.",
        "Q: Excuse me, in the prison.",
        "A: Yes, we worked all day long, also on Saturday. But not on Sunday.",
        "Q: What did you do on Sunday?",
        "A: On Sunday, we were in our room in the prison and we talked and we sewed.",
        "Q: Were people optimistic? The young women?",
        "A: Yes. Really. But you know, there are so many things that | have to come back to\nbecause -- | don\u2019t know if you want me to. Should | just go on?",
        "Q: No, it\u2019s -- everything is --",
        "A: For instance, when we left, we still thought that our families were alive. And for\ninstance, when we were going to Reval, we had to bring all our stuff that we were\nDoris Rauch 40\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 40\ntaking along to a meadow, and the SS went through it. And for instance, | had sewn\ntogether two of those feather blankets. That\u2019s not the right word. | have it now. What\nis it?",
        "Q: A comforter? or feather pillow?",
        "A: No, no. It was a comforter, but with feathers inside. Down -- down whatever.",
        "Q: Quilt?",
        "A: Quilt. Yeah, maybe quilt. And | had sewn a whole dress and stockings and\nunderwear and everything for my mother in between those two blankets and sewn it\ntogether. But of course, they found out, you know? They ripped it apart and there\nwas all that. So we always tried to look out for them, still hoping, you know. But later\non, for instance, when we worked in Reval -- we did not always work in the ports.\nSometimes they sent us to a different assignment, like, once we were in a sewing\nmill and two of us always tried to get out of that and we went begging, which had two\npurposes. First of all, to get something to eat. And secondly to -- if the people were\nfriendly -- to ask did they know anything about any other camps. So we found out\nabout another camp and we thought that maybe our families were there. The camp\nwas Kloga. And others told us that they are not alive anymore. But we didn't believe\nthem. So yeah. We sometimes went to other assignments and it was always a joy,\nsomething different, something new. One of my friends in the camp -- | mean in\nEstonia -- was from a mixed marriage. Her father was Jewish and her mother was\nnot. And they still lived in Prague. And one or two of those Germans who were in\ncharge of her went to visit the parents and I\u2019m sure gotsome money from them and\nDoris Rauch 41\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 41\nbrought stuff back for her -- money and food and so on. So you know, some of them\nwere real decent.",
        "Q: So you went back and forth, working at the pier and then going to do other things.",
        "A: Yeah. But mostly at the pier. That was our main job. And as | said, we were not\nallowed to wear the stars. But eventually, something must have happened because\nfor a week or so, we were not allowed to go to work. And then they sent us to another\ncamp. And we were not able to say goodbye to those construction workers and --",
        "Q: This is after being there for a year.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So this is the end of \u201842, beginning of",
        "A: No, end of \u201843. And so then we were sent into another camp which was called\nEreda. And there were already Lithuanian and Polish Jews -- most of them men and\nwomen.",
        "Q: When you said \u201cwe were sent,\u201d does that mean the whole camp?",
        "A: This whole group.",
        "Q: How big was this group that you were talking about?",
        "A: It must be -- | don't know, maybe 80.",
        "Q: 80?",
        "A: | don\u2019t know exactly, but | think something like that. And there were already Polish\nand Lithuanian Jews, most of them were from Vilna, which is probably familiar to you.\nAnd now they told us -- first of all, we heard Yiddish for the first time in our lives. It\ndidn\u2019t exist in Czechoslovakia or in Germany -- maybe it did, but | don\u2019t think so. And\nso we had -- at first, we had trouble understanding them. But we did because it\u2019s a\nDoris Rauch 42\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 42\nreally sort of similar to German. Only some words will really confuse you. Like, |\nremember one told me \u201c . The word, the peasants. And | thought -\n-nacht in German is night -- how do they get out at night to go to the peasants to get\nsome food? So it turned out nachten (ph) means yesterday.",
        "Q: Were these all women?",
        "A: No, men and women. A mixed group. and we were in the same camp.",
        "Q: Again, did you live in a barrack?",
        "A: We lived in barracks, yes. The men had separate barracks from us.",
        "Q: Still wearing your own clothes.",
        "A: Still wearing our own clothes and no star. | don\u2019t think we had to -- no.",
        "Q: How clean were these places?",
        "A: That camp was terrible. And you know, the toilets were really -- were not toilets. It\nwas a big --",
        "Q: Latrine?",
        "A: Latrine, yes. That\u2019s the word. And you had to go for ten minutes to get there. It\nwas all mud in the camp in winter anyhow. And some of it dried up fortunately. So\nthen you had a place in front of each barrack where you could go -- should go only if\nyou urinate -- at night so that you don't have to go. And we tried to keep it clean, you\nknow. We had brushes and cleaned it with water and soap. We tried to keep it as\nclean as possible. But eventually we had lice and we had all sorts of vermin. Fleas.\nFleas we already had. | forgot to mention. You know there was a time in the prison\nwhen all the ones who had stayed back in the first camp were brought to prison. But\nthen they moved us all into rooms in another part of the prison. We were no longer\nDoris Rauch 43\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 43\nin those cells, but in those rooms. And we had straw pallets which were full of fleas.\nSo that was awful.",
        "Q: You yourself got fleas?",
        "A: Yes. | remember | had a pajama that put a rubber band around here so that they\ncouldn't get in and to my sleeves too, but it didn\u2019t help. They got in. Oh yes. We had\nfleas, and lice | think we acquired in Ereda. And then people starting having typhoid\nfever -- no, typhus. But the lice transmitted.",
        "Q: Were you getting your menstrual period during those years?",
        "A: No, in fact, it first started in Theresienstadt that people stopped having their\nmenstrual. And there was one year a girl in our room who was so -- she was married\nand she was worried to death that she was pregnant -- because we didn't know that.\n| don't Know anymore how long | had my menstrual period, but | lost it, too, which\nwas a blessing because there were times where we didnt have any material to\nprotect us.",
        "Q: So what kind of work did you do in Ereda?",
        "A: We did very, very hard work. Felling trees -- do you say felling? And then carrying\nthem on our shoulders. It was really very hard work. And eventually, | just said, \u201cI\ncan't do that.\u201d And | went to one of the doctors in the camp -- they were Jews -- and\ntold him couldn't they assign me to something else, that | just can\u2019t do that kind of\nwork. We -- well, we felled trees and cut them up and then we started building\nbarracks in the woods someplace else.",
        "Q: You were felling trees with axes? You yourself were swinging an ax?\nDoris Rauch 44\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 44",
        "A: Yes. And what we were building there, in the woods, was another camp, which we\ndidn\u2019t know. But some of our people then later went to the camp.",
        "Q: Who were your guards?",
        "A: Our guards were --",
        "Q: Were they German guards? Were they --",
        "A: Yeah, they [the commanders] were German. They were all German in that camp.\nBut the guards, if there were guards, which | can\u2019t think -- you know, they were really\nGerman SS. But not the guards -- | don\u2019t remember that we had any guards, but\nmaybe we did.",
        "Q: Watching over you?",
        "A: We must have had, but | have no recollection of that.",
        "Q: And how were you treated? Were you ever mis-- | know you said the work was\nvery physically difficult, but were you mistreated some by the SS? You yourself? Did\nyou yourself have any particular. . .",
        "A: | don't think | was mistreated there.",
        "Q: And how long did you say in that camp?",
        "A: In that camp. If | Knew when we came -- that was in winter.",
        "Q: Winter of \u201844 you said, the beginning of \u201844.",
        "A: The beginning of \u201844 and -- let me think. No it can\u2019t have been winter \u201844. It must\nhave been \u201843.",
        "Q: End of \u201843, beginning of \u201844.",
        "A: Yes, yes. | think end of \u201843, beginning of \u201844. And | don\u2019t remember any guards in\nthe camp, but there must have been. | just can\u2019t remember.\nDoris Rauch 45\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 45",
        "Q: And your clothes and everything --",
        "A: Most everything had been taken away. Either taken away or sold by us. We didnt\nhave very much anymore. And of course we --",
        "Q: Did you have any sweaters? | was gonna say sweaters or coats, gloves?",
        "A: No, no. We didnt. Well, we made do with what we had or we exchanged things. |\nremember | had a short, warm coat. | don\u2019t know where | got it. And | gave it to this\nInga Sylten. | must tell you a story about Inga Sylten which is really like a novel..\nThere was an SS commander this particular camp. | even know his name. It was\nDrosin. He fell in love with her and she with him. And she work -- there was a separate\nbarrack where the commander lived. She worked as a, you know, cleaning up. And\nthis friend of mine of mixed parentage was the cook. She was a very good cook. So\nshe knew about what was going on between Inga and this man, but | will say that\nInga behaved very well. She always spoke up for us and he minded her. And |\nremember, for instance, that there came the command that we had to have our heads\nshaved. They started shaving the heads and she finally convinced him he shouldn't\ndo that. And so he stopped the whole thing. But to make a long story short, the two\nescaped together because word about what was going on got to Germany to his\nsuperiors and they sent another SS commander and before he even came, | think,\nthey escaped together and hid in the woods. But they caught them. You know, there\nwas a -- they just came from all sides. And he shot her and shot himself. So when\nwe learned that, we knew it for sure. So anyhow.",
        "Q: So you stayed in Ereda?\nDoris Rauch 46\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 46",
        "A: Ereda. | stayed there until late in 1944. And | had a male friend there, too, from --\nhe even -- | have the -- I\u2019m relieving this to the Holocaust Museum, but I\u2019m not parting\nwith it yet. | had a young man friend there who had this ring made for me. There were\npeople in the camp who were very clever with their hands. | don\u2019t know where they\ngot the silver, but they did. And so | still have the ring.",
        "Q: And what does the ring say?",
        "A: The ring gives my name on top and on the inside is his name.",
        "Q: And his name is what?",
        "A: lsaac.",
        "Q: What was his last name?",
        "A: | can\u2019t remember. | asked my friend the other day and | can\u2019t remember what's his\nname. But | got a letter after the war from a relative of his who was in Paris at the\ntime who also had been in camp with us. And he told me that Isaac had died in",
        "Q: So you stayed there until late 1944.",
        "A: We stayed until late 1944.",
        "Q: Anybody else try to escape besides the couple that you told us about?",
        "A: | understand yes. But | don\u2019t Know personally about it.",
        "Q: Did it ever occur to you to try to escape?",
        "A: No. | was too cowardly. But | Know several young women when we were in Tallinn\nwho had offers from Estonians who worked on boats to take them to Finland. But no\none ever had the courage to do it because they told us if one escapes, ten will be\nshot.\nDoris Rauch 47\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 47",
        "Q: And then what happened at the end of 1944\u2019",
        "A: End of 1944, the Russians were coming closer and one could hear shooting. And\nso they brought -- they evacuated us back to Germany.",
        "Q: How did you get there?",
        "A: Well they first brought us by train to a place called Lagedi, which was outside\nReval, | think. And that\u2019s where we lived for six weeks under the -- just with no\nprotection at all. There were no tents, no anything. Just on the -- in the meadows.",
        "Q: You slept outside.",
        "A: We slept outside. That\u2019s where they finally shaved my hair. And we were there for\nsix weeks. It didn\u2019t rain once. Like if God had -- or the breath of God had been looking\nout for us.",
        "Q: Why did they shave your hair?",
        "A: | think because of the lice. Or that\u2019s what they said, you know? They shaved all\nthe -- for us, it was very late in the game.",
        "Q: That was the first time.",
        "A: For us, it was the first time. You know, they had made an attempt in the beginning,\nin Ereda, but Inga stopped them. But that\u2019s where they finally did it.",
        "Q: What did that feel like?",
        "A: Terrible. Terrible. Sometimes | see young women on TV nowadays. Like\nyesterday, | saw someone -- or this morning -- a singer with such very short hair. So,\nhow can she do that to herself. Yes, and | was very -- | didn\u2019t even talk about -- but\nstill in Ereda, | became very sick. | had been very high temperature, but there was a\nbarrack for sick people. But | didn\u2019t want to go there because | was afraid they would\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nDoris Rauch 48\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 48\ndo away with me. So | just existed with the high temperature. And then we came to\nLagedi and | really felt terribly sick. The doctor, the Jewish doctor, thought | probably\nhad --",
        "Q: Typhoid?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Small pox? Diphtheria?",
        "A: No. You know when the white of your eye becomes yellow?",
        "Q: Jaundice?",
        "A: Hepatitis. And people were put to work digging ditches to defend themselves\nagainst -- the Germans against the Russians. But | was so weak | just couldn't do it\nand | sort of went into a meadow and laid down there and just laid. And two SS\nofficers came by. And | was sure they would shoot me because | wasn\u2019t working but\nthey just looked and went away. So that was good luck. Then, after six weeks, they\nput us on a freighter -- or on a boat -- and we -- again, | was very sick. | didn\u2019t know\nwhat was going on.",
        "Q: Were you able to walk?",
        "A: No. | was just lying there.",
        "Q: They carried you onto a boat?",
        "A: Well, | probably walked on my own, with support. But on the boat, | didn't walk.\nThat's what | meant. And, | don\u2019t know how long we were on the boat. Then they\ntransferred us to a Kanai (ph) boat. And where we were so crammed in that | couldn't\neven sit or lie down. We were just like standing up like sardines. That | survived, that\nis a miracle.\nDoris Rauch 49\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 49",
        "Q: This is this group of women? Or men and women?",
        "A: This was men and women, yeah. And we came to Stutthof, which was a big camp\nin eastern Germany. And there, we had to undress completely and go under the\nshowers. We didn\u2019t know about gas, not yet. We had heard about shootings and so\non. But gas we didn\u2019t know. So it was -- they were real showers. It wasn\u2019t gas. And |\nstill have another treasure from the -- this is a watch that | had at home with me. |\ncarried it with me all the time. And in Stutthof, when we were under the show -- first |\nhad hidden it in the soap. And then | thought they would probably take the soap away\nfrom me, so | put it in my mouth, soapy as it was. And so, of course it didn\u2019t survive.\nBut | still have it.",
        "Q: Whose watch is that?",
        "A: That's my watch.",
        "Q: Oh, that\u2019s your own --",
        "A: from home.",
        "Q: From home, that\u2019s you've kept with you all that time.",
        "A: All that time. Yes, and | had written a diary in Estonia. | wrote a diary everyday.\nBut now, when | saw they took everything away from us, | gave it to a man who was\nalso a prisoner there, and said would he save it for me? And he said yes. But | never\nsaw it again.",
        "Q: You had brought the diary with you from home.",
        "A: No, from Estonia. | had written a diary while we were in Estonia. And | never,\nunfortunately, saw it again.",
        "Q: What did you do in Stutthof?\nDoris Rauch 50\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 50",
        "A: In Stutthof, nothing. We were just sitting in the sand. In the sand. And | met several\npeople there from my hometown who had been in Riga. And there were daughters\nwith mothers. One daughter, one mother. Two couples like that. And one of these\ncouples, one daughter and mother, survived. The daughter lives in Vienna now. And\nthe other couple did not survive. So you know, you just ran into those people. It was\nan immense camp. And we didn't own anything. | didn\u2019t even have a spoon to eat\nwith. But someone else shared her spoon with me.",
        "Q: Do you remember what they gave you to eat?",
        "A: No. Very little. Nothing, probably. There was something. Soup. Perhaps again, the\nturnip soup. | don't really know because it was the first real concentration camp that\n| had been to. And it was pretty awful. And thousands of women there -- the women\nwere separate again.",
        "Q: And where did they finally put you there? You said you were on the sand in the\nbeginning.",
        "A: Well we were in barracks.",
        "Q: You went into barracks.",
        "A: Yes, we were in barracks. But there was and all around where we sat around all\nday long.",
        "Q: Did you work?",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t work. We were not there for very long.",
        "Q: How long were you there for?",
        "A: | can tell you exactly. We came there on my birthday, August 26, 1944. And in\nOctober, we were sent on to Hamburg in Germany. | think that\u2019s enough. Do you still\nDoris Rauch 51\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 51\nfeel like it? In Hamburg, which was Hamburg Oxensal (ph), | became very sick\nimmediately. | had pneumonia and | think | had typhoid, but this is not for sure.\nPneumonia and pleurisy and typhoid and a terrible diarrhea, probably enteritis or it\nmay have been typhoid, | don\u2019t know. And after a month or so, they built a barrack\nwhich they called the , where the sick people were sent. There were\nonly, | think, six or seven of us in there. And | was there for what seems like months,\nbut | don\u2019t know, really, how long it was. But | survived, which was a miracle in itself.\nAnd my best friend was at that time the Schreiberen (ph) in this camp. She was in\ncharge of counting people and she was the secretary to the SS man and so on. And\nshe arranged for me not to have to go to the factory, but to be in the\nSchneiderstubben (ph) which was the place where they did sewing for the Germans.\nThere were a lot of SS men and women there and there was a professional\nseamstress, also a Jewish lady, from Frankfurt. So that\u2019s where | ended up working.\nAnd then one day in April, they said that we would be sent -- that we are being sent\nto Sweden now. And we couldn't quite believe it, but they said it. So they put us on\ninto cattle cars and we travelled and on the way we saw open cattle cars with dead\npeople in there. And then they unloaded us in, | think it was called Luneburg, and\nfrom there, we walked to Bergen-Belsen. So the thing with Sweden was not at all\ntrue. It was just another of those lies.",
        "Q: What was it like to be in the cattle car?",
        "A: Terrible. You know. We all know how that is. Because there was no air and no\nfood and just a pail, | guess. | really don\u2019t remember. It was terrible. And to see those\ncars filled with dead people. . . It was just awful. Of course, in the cattle cars, there\nDoris Rauch 52\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 52\nwere little windows up there we could see through. Anyhow, they unloaded us there\nand we were marched to Bergen-Belsen. And on the side of the road, in the ditches,\nthere were dead people everywhere. That was in April \u201845, shortly before Bergen-\nBelsen was liberated. We got into Bergen-Belsen and what it was like there, | Knew\nthat | couldn't survive that. Well, fortunately, | didn\u2019t have to survive it there because\nthree days later, the highest SS from Hamburg came back and said the factory\nneeded people. And he started reading all our numbers. But since | had never worked\nin the factory, he didn\u2019t read my number, but not everyone was around, so when no\none responded to a number, | went there because my two best friends were there.",
        "Q: When had you been originally assigned a number? In the beginning?",
        "A: Well, | had one in Theresienstadt.",
        "Q: You had different ones in different camps?",
        "A: | don\u2019t know. | don\u2019t know if | had the same number all the time or whether they\nchanged it. So anyhow, | joined this group. And he marched us out of Bergen-Belsen,\nalong the Lagge Strassen (ph) where on one side there was a band that played music\nand across from it was a big hall with people just -- dead people just --",
        "Q: Piled up?",
        "A: Piled up. And so we came out of there. We marched along the road and there\nwere --\nEnd of Tape Two\nDoris Rauch 53\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 53\nTape Three",
        "Q: You were talking about your journey from Bergen-Belsen back to Hamburg in April\nof 1945.",
        "A: And there were fliers thrown down from some airplane telling that the British were\nclose and that they would soon be here. We did not save the flier, but it was very\ngood to know about. And the men had to march us -- | forget to where because the\n_______ had been bombed. There were no more trains leading to Luneburg or -- no,\nthe place was Tellebeiden (ph) Hanover. That\u2019s where they unloaded us when we\nwent to Bergen-Belsen. You know, after the war, | read in Time magazine some letter\nto the editor from someone who lives in Tallinn. Either that -- I\u2019m not sure. Anyhow,\nthey said that they didn\u2019t know there was Bergen-Belsen there. When all the dead\npeople were lying close to the road. Anyhow, this guy marched us to -- | don\u2019t know\nwhere. We slept in the woods, covering us with leaves. We didn't run away. We got\nback to Bergen-Belsen. And when we got there, there was a whole new crew there.",
        "Q: Back to Hamburg.",
        "A: Hamburg . It was filled with people from other camps who had been\nevacuated there. And so we never went back to the factory to work. But we registered\nthose new prisoners. That was our new job. And then one day --",
        "Q: Your health had improved by that time?",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you get better because you were given medicine? Or was this--",
        "A: No, there was no medicine. There was no --",
        "Q: So it was the resting and not working.\nDoris Rauch 54\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 54",
        "A: Just being in bed and not working. But it was for a long time. | remember when I,\nfor the first time, went into the bathroom, there were mirrors there. And | just couldn't\nbelieve it when | saw myself. | said, \u201cI look like Christ at the cross.\u201d So we were used\nto register the new prisoners. And then one day, toward the end of April, they said,\n\u201cNow we will go to Sweden.\u201d Again, you see. So of course, we didn\u2019t believe it. But,\nlo and behold, we really went, in cattle cars, and got out in Flannsburg (ph), which is\nthe border between Germany and Denmark. And there we were -- there was already\na normal train standing. And we were taken over by the Danish Red Cross. And on\nevery seat, there was a package. Little satin breeches and chocolates. Then we\ncame through Copenhagen, and the Danes were on the platforms -- | remember one\nday holding up a newspaper saying \u201cHitler Dead.\u201d And of course, it was wonderful to\nhear that. So then we went by train and they unloaded us onto a boat, you know, a\nferry. And there they had papers sent for. And | never got to read (ph) anything\nbecause it was so -- you know, everyone just threw himself on those papers -- flowers\nand anything you can imagine. And then we arrived in . | don\u2019t know -- | think\nwe went on the train once more after the ferry. I\u2019m not sure. And in , we\nwere taken over by -- | guess it was the Red Cross. And we had to, once again,\nundress completely and they burnt all our clothes. And so that was, | don\u2019t know, the\n2nd of May maybe. And then we had to run into some pens and take showers there.\nThey had it all set up. It was wonderful. And they put us -- after we were all bathed\nand so on -- they put us in a covered tennis stadium where we slept on the floor. But\nfor us, it was joyous because they had white sheets -- white paper sheets, you know.",
        "Q: Could you believe you were free?\nDoris Rauch 95\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 55",
        "A: It was hard. But they apparently knew exactly what to do because they fed us very\nlittle. And we, of course, thought they should feed us much more. But in Bergen -- as\nwe later heard -- in Bergen-Belsen, it was a catastrophe. People died from eating too\nmuch. And you know, the Swedes gave us new clothes. We went to factories and\npicked from clothes and underwear. Everything. But that was before the end of the\nwar. You know, the war, | think, ended on the 8th of May or 7th of May. So for us, the\nwar was over.",
        "Q: And then you stayed in Sweden for how long?",
        "A: | stayed there for two years because it took so long to get a visa to the United\nStates where | had an uncle, my mother\u2019s middle brother, who was the only one who\nwas able to immigrate. He\u2019s the one who | told you that they came from Vienna, first\nto Czechoslovakia, and they eventually landed in the United States.",
        "Q: Did you work in Sweden at all?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What kind of work did you do?",
        "A: | worked as an English-German secretary in the World Jewish Congress office.\nSo that was very nice. It was like a family. When | went back to Sweden in \u201892, |\nlooked for the World Jewish Congress. It was no longer there. They\u2019ve closed it. They\ndon't need it anymore. But they certainly needed it then.",
        "Q: Were you able to adjust to life in Sweden after all that you had been through?",
        "A: Yes. Actually, yes. | mean, I'm not -- still not quite --",
        "Q: But you were able to cope, get through those two years.\nDoris Rauch 56\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 56",
        "A: Yes. | was able to work, yes. And in the beginning, my two best friends were there.\nBut we had a room together, a furnished room and a family. And we all three worked",
        "Q: These were friends from the camp.",
        "A: Yes. And one of them left first. She went back to Czechoslovakia because her\nsister and the sister's husband had returned. They were in camp too because -- well,\nit's a long immoral story. The sister, of course, was Jewish. But the husband was not.\nAnd they had -- her father and my friend\u2019s father had hidden in the village on false\npapers. And someone told on him. And so then they sent his daughter and her\nhusband to camp, too. But just for a year, so they both survived.",
        "Q: So you got -- when did you arrive in the United States?",
        "A: On May 19th, 1947.",
        "Q: And where did you go?",
        "A: | went to New York. And my uncle had already found me a job in an import/export\nfirm. And | had a furnished room in a family again. West 86th Street. But those were\ndifficult times. It was, you know, what they call culture shock. It was all so different\nfrom Sweden. And | was very unhappy at first. It took me some time to get used to\nthe climate. It was so hard. Altogether, you know, at the World Jewish Congress, |\ntold you we were all like a family. And there, the people who owned the business\nwere not at all friendly. It was all so cold, unfeeling. And no one wanted to hear about\nmy experience, not even my own uncle, you know? No one asked any questions and\nwe were So full of them.",
        "Q: And then you stayed in New York?\nDoris Rauch of\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 57",
        "A: | stayed in New York for two years and then | got married and moved to Chicago.",
        "Q: Was your husband from Europe?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Had he been through the war?",
        "A: No, he was here during the war.",
        "Q: And you moved to Chicago.",
        "A: | moved to Chicago and then we moved to Pittsburgh. And last, we moved to\nWashington and really like it here. I\u2019m glad | ended up here.",
        "Q: Can we talk just a little bit before we close about some of your feelings and\nreflections and thoughts about what you went through? How do you feel about being\nJewish? Did this experience make you more so or less so or no change at all?",
        "A: Maybe less so. No, not Jewish. It made me more Jewish, but it made me\nirreligious. | don\u2019t believe in God, I\u2019m afraid to say.",
        "Q: This is because of what you went through during that.",
        "A: Yes. | don\u2019t think, if there were a God, he would have let all that happen. No. But\nI'm consciously Jewish. | would never hide it. But I\u2019m just not religious.",
        "Q: Do you receive reparations?",
        "A: Yes. | get two pensions. One is like Social Security. And the other one is what they\ncall Gesundheitschon (ph). | had to prove that the experience was bad for my health.\nAnd since then, I\u2019m getting a pension for that.",
        "Q: How do you feel about getting reparations for your time?",
        "A: | now feel about it very good. But it was the hardest thing | went through, you\nknow? To dig all the things out and everything the lawyer wanted from me, you know?\nDoris Rauch 58\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 58\n| was in psychotherapy for several years. And it was not easy. Every time a letter\ncame from the lawyer in Germany, | thought, No, what now? What would he want\nnow? But in the end of course, it\u2019s -- | could not live from the pension | get here. So\nthat makes a big difference in my life and my lifestyle.",
        "Q: You say you returned to visit in Europe?",
        "A: Oh yeah. I\u2019ve been in Europe many times. But in \u201892, | was back in Estonia\nbecause that was just 15 years af-- | never told you about what happened to my\nmother and the others. You want me to tell you?",
        "Q: If you think you\u2019re able to.",
        "A: After the war, when we were first -- remember, | told you we were at ;\nAnd then they sent us for recuperation to various places in Sweden. And my Czech\nfriends and | were in a town called . And there one day -- there we didn't\ndo anything, you know. They were just nice to us. And we went on hikes and had fun\ntogether and bicycles and so on. And one day, they had a sort of a little feast for us\nwhere there came a couple of ministers -- | forget of what religion. And they lectured\nto us -- | forget about what. And afterwards, there was coffee and cake. There were\nmaybe 30 or 40 of us in the scout hall where we were. And | just happened to sit next\nto one of those ministers and another friend -- the mixed one -- sat on the other side\nof him. And he asked me where we had been during the war and | told him about\nEstonia and so on. And he said, \u201cStrange with Estonia, you know? | have a friend,\nand Estonian minister, who told me a terrible story about transport that came to\nArazecu (ph). (Il don\u2019t know whether he said Arazecu (ph)) that came and that some\nmembers of his congregation had to shoot those people. And that some of them\nDoris Rauch 59\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 59\nbecame quite emotionally sick from it.\u201d And from what he said -- of course, he didn\u2019t\nknow the details -- | thought that could be us, you know? So he gave me the name\nand address of this minister. And it took me awhile. | didn\u2019t arrive right away or beware\ngo to see him -- and | never did go to see him. | think | just didn\u2019t want to know really.\nBut | did write him a letter and he wrote me a letter back saying such-and-such\nhappened. That the people had to dig their own graves and were shot on the spot.\nAnd he wrote bad words. But he wrote very, you know, consolingly that maybe our\nfamilies were not among those people because he remembers that there were some\nJewish women seen in Reval working there. And maybe that\u2019s where my mother\nwas. And so -- so of course, that was us. And so that was that. And then in 1960 -- |\nthink in 1960 -- how did that come about? Well, | can\u2019t tell you the whole story.\nHowever, they caught some of those Estonian SS people and -- | mean | can tell you\nthe story, but it would be too long -- and some of our friends who lived in\nCzechoslovakia -- went to Tallinn as witnesses in the trial of those people.",
        "Q: Trial of the Estonian SS.",
        "A: Yes. And two of them were hanged. And others were convicted in absentia. And\none of them was the commander -- Laak was his name -- and he -- it turned out that\nhe had immigrated. He had fled after the war to Canada. And the Russians were\nbroadcasting -- there was news about the trial all the time -- and that they were\nlooking for him. And he apparently got frightened and he hanged himself in Canada.\nSo one of our girls was living in Canada. And she -- when she read in the paper about\nit, she called the newspaper and said that she was one of his victims. And then the\nnewspapers interviewed some others of our girls in New York. And one called me,\nDoris Rauch 60\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 60\ntoo. | was living in Chicago then. So you know, three of them, at least, are dead. And\nthen -- while the girls were testifying, they took them to that place where it all had\nhappened. And there is a monument there now. And it's not, apparently not only our\ntransport, the German transport. They also killed some Russians, | think. So it -- on\nthe monument, it was in all languages, | think. And so in 1992, we went there for the\nfiftieth anniversary of those times, of the day. And one of our friends who was also at\nthe trial as a witness now lives in Switzerland. She escaped in 1968 with her\nhusband. And she really built friendships there in Estonia, and they go there quite\nfrequently to visit. And, you see, this woman, Eugenia works for the\nJewish community there. Yeah, this -- Eugenia _____ works for the Jewish\ncommunity in Tallinn. And she worked on this book for years. She was already\nworking on it in 1992. She found all the documents and it\u2019s all about the Estonian\nJews and what happened to them.",

So | had\nprivate lessons, first in French for many years. And | was sent to Switzerland to speak\nFrench fluently. And | also had English lessons later on which really stuck with me\nbecause the teacher was wonderful. With French, I\u2019ve totally forgotten, almost. And\n| even learned Spanish one year, when Hitler was already occupying us. Occupied\nmyself, | guess. Or for possible immigration.",
        "A: | took piano for | don\u2019t know how many years and was absolutely unmusical. And\none of the happiest days of my life was when the teacher said, \u201cNo.\u201d She doesn't\nthink it had any use for me to learn piano anymore. That is as far as my musicality is\nconcerned. . We had, what you call it, gymnastics and dance lessons from\na very good teacher whom we adored. And that was something very pleasant in my\nyouth, going twice a week to those lessons.\nDoris Rauch 9)\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 5",
        "A: Yes. Well, pleasant, perhaps. But you know, when my father had all his business\ndifficulties, a child fears that even if they didn\u2019t talk in front of me, but | knew there\nwas something going on. And | had to inherit the 10,000 Czech crowns from a great\nuncle of mine. And so, | knew that my father needed money, so | offered him my\n10,000 crowns, which I\u2019m sure would have been a drop in the bucket. So, you know,\n| remembered this. But he lost his business and my mother\u2019s brothers took him into\ntheir business, which was a wholesale fur business.",
        "A: That was in the early thirties; | don\u2019t Know exactly which year. So | was, | don\u2019t\nknow, ten years old or twelve years old.",
        "A: Yeah. | didn't curtail my activities at all.",
        "A: You mean as far -- well, when | was, | think, 17 years old because --",
        "A: 1937, yeah. For instance, one of my fellow students told me | had remonstrated\nwith him, that he didn't do so well in school anymore and he was a very\nintelligent guy. And he told me that he was very tired because every night he went\nacross the borders to Austria to train for Hitler's coming. | didn\u2019t even believe it. |\nDoris Rauch 6\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 6\nthought he was just bragging in front of me. But today | know it was true. So -- and\ndo you know then in 1938, Hitler occupied the Sudatin (ph) line? And | felt very\nstrongly that my parents had done the wrong thing, that they sent me to a German\nschool. And | wore a Czech flag on my lapel in that year after Hitler really occupied\nthe entire state and we had to wear a star instead of a flag. But | still feel that today\nthat it was a great mistake that | did not go to a Czech school. So of course, the\noutcome would have been the same.",
        "A: Well, the choice was not up to me. | mean, the way we go to our -- yes, | could\nhave gone.",
        "A: Yes. | went to the same school that my father graduated from.",
        "A: Yes, but there\u2019s a big event before that. My father had lung cancer. And he died\nin 1936, when | was 16 years old. And that was very hard on me because | was very\nclose to my father, much more so than to my mother.",
        "A: Well, my mother tried to make a living by renting out a room to two girl students.\nShe did all sorts of things. She had a representation -- no, you don\u2019t say that. Anyhow,\nshe sewed, knit woolen materials to friends and got a commission on that. And then\nshe sent all her friends to certain coffee shop in the town. And there they had to say\nDoris Rauch 7\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 7\nthat they were sent by my mother and she got a percentage from that. So my mother\nwas very capable, although she never really worked. But she was very intelligent and\nvery practical. And although there probably was some money, my father hadn't left\nanything because we just lived on his salary. But | think my mother inherited money\nfrom her mother. And | know she had stocks in the bank because | used to go with\nher to collect the coupons. But she always made an effort to earn some money\nherself.",
        "A: Well, | was -- you mean as far as anti-Semitism?",
        "A: Well, | was sent to Switzerland that summer, into a French-speaking family.",
        "A: Well, we knew quite a bit. Perhaps not |, but my mother had a very close friend in\nGermany, in Oldham (ph). And this woman came to us once a year, usually, and my\nmother went to visit her. And she smuggled out some money from Germany before\nthey immigrated to Argentina. So we knew what was going on there. And then, also,\nHitler occupied Austria in 1938 and one of my mother\u2019s brothers lived in Vienna. So\nthey all immigrated first to Czechoslovakia to Berdenau (ph) before they attempted\nto get a visa to someplace else. And they did eventually go to France and from\nFrance to unoccupied France. And they got to America maybe 1940, 1939 or \u201840.",
        "A: Not really. But that was perhaps because | was so naive, you know? | grew up in\na very protected way. And | was rather childish at that age. And my mother used to\nDoris Rauch 8\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 8\nsay, \u201cNothing will happen to us. I\u2019m happy here as long as | have a roof over my\nhead.\u201d That was her constant saying. | would have liked to immigrate, but it wasn't\neasy because we didn\u2019t have any money out anywhere. And it was very difficult to\nget a visa to anyplace. But some of my friends succeeded, but we didn't.",
        "A: Yes. Of course, | graduated from gymnasium in 1938. But | could no longer go to\na university. That was 193--. You know, | don\u2019t remember how that was. Anyhow, |\ncould not study. And my mother said --",
        "A: Because they didn\u2019t admit Jews.",
        "A: | don\u2019t remember. Probably not very well. But | was not -- as | said, | was very\nnaive. And all this didn't touch me somehow. And my mother decided | should attend\na Class in a Czech -- that\u2019s what it was. We were not admitted to German-speaking\nuniversities. Maybe still to Czech, | don\u2019t know. But | went to a Czech, you would call\nit maybe post-graduate textile school because Berdenau was full of textile factories.\nAnd the so-called English cloth that was so famous really came from Berdenau and\nwas treated in England. You know, they had a special process they treated it with.\nBut it was woven in Berdenau. So she send me to a textile school which did not\ninterest me at all. | mean, we had to learn all about textile machinery and -- well, there\nwas a possibility that perhaps | could become a designer. My mother still saw that\nwe could live a normal life. But it was a wasted year so far as my future --",
        "A: | did go. | graduated from there. It was a lot of fun because we were only two girls\nand the rest were all young boys. So we had a good time, not knowing what was\nwaiting for us. So | graduated from there in June of 1939 and we were already\noccupied by Hitler.",
        "A: Well, it all came very gradually. First, we had to wear yellow stars. And then we\nhad a curfew. We couldn't go into the street | think it was seven or eight o'clock in the\nevening. We had to stay at home. Then we were concentrated into certain streets of\nthe city, which meant that my mother -- because we lived on such a street, we got,\nso to speak, renters into the apartment. There were several -- there were two families\nin addition to us in the apartment that was only a three-room apartment with one\nbathroom.",
        "A: Well, it was, what is the English word? It was not pleasant.",
        "A: It was upsetting and it was -- what is the word? -- It was -- well, you know. It made\nyou feel that people were looking down on you.",
        "A: Demeaning. That was the word | was looking for. So we had all those people in\nthe apartment, which -- for me, it was not so bad because | liked all the people. And\n| don\u2019t know how it was for my mother. But there was nothing we could do against it.\nAnd my favorite aunt, who was the only one of her family that left behind, had to move\nDoris Rauch 10\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 10\nto -- had a villa in the suburbs, but her husband was gone. Her three daughters were\ngone. And she had to move into our neighborhood. That made me very happy.",
        "A: Yes. And it became more frightening as time went on. But in the meantime, after\ngraduating from the textile school, | got a job, an unpaid job, in a textile factory out in\nthe country. And | lived there five and a half days of the week and came home for the\nweekend. And | worked then all phases of the textile industry. The factory still\nbelonged to a Jewish firm. That\u2019s, | suppose, how | got the job, although it was\nunpaid. But it was good training for me had | ever gone into that field, which | don't\nthink | would have under normal circumstances. So | was home only over the\nweekend.",
        "A: No, they were nothing at all. You know, they did not -- they were not in touch with\nme. Like my school friends. | never heard from them. And we were forbidden to have\ntelephones, so we could telephone only from a neighboring store that had a\ntelephone, but only at certain hours. Because Jews were not allowed to go into those\nshops, except from 2:00 to 3:00, or whatever it was. So if you had to make a\ntelephone call, you had to make it during those certain hours. And | remember\nmeeting one of my classmates in such a store and being afraid what she would do\nor say. But she didn\u2019t do or say anything. She just make-believe she didn\u2019t see me.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Mostly non-Jews. They were very nice. They were Czech peasants. Moravian\npeasants. There was no -- | didn\u2019t feel any anti-Semitism. In fact, some of those\npeople came to town on weekends and came to visit us in the apartment and brought\nfood from the country for us. So no, | didn\u2019t suffer there.",
        "A: | think so, yes. But | don't really remember -- yes, | think we were. Because |\nremember, you know, going shopping to those stores during certain hours and having\nthose ration cards with me.",
        "A: See my friends. Or my uncle, my mother\u2019s brother, who will figure a lot in this\ninterview, | think --",
        "A: Norbert Troller (ph). He and | were the only ones who survived the war. And he\nwas in Auschwitz. He was but he made it. My uncle had a\nweekend house in the country. So we sometimes went there. We still could go hiding,\nyou know. As long as we kept within the hours allowed to us.",
        "A: Yes, we had a radio. We had a radio when, | think we rented a radio when my\nfather was so sick for a whole year. But then we had a radio when Hitler was already\noccupying us, which we inherited from a relative who immigrated. And | remember\nDoris Rauch 12\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 12\nsitting in front of it and hearing about in our time. But it didn't get to me. |\nwas SO --",
        "A: Yes, of course. And their outbreak of the war. Yes, naturally.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes it was because one was always afraid what was coming next. You see, and\nwe knew about things in Germany and in Austria. But there it went much slower. It\ntook some time after this or that. Whereas with us, it all came pretty fast. All the\n, all the restriction, all came very fast.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: That was the end, | think. | worked. That\u2019s about all that was left to me. | went to\ntake care in the afternoon, after, of a group of children who were, | don\u2019t know, maybe\nfour children. And | went hiking with them. | did their schoolwork.",
        "A: Yeah. And long -- | don\u2019t know how long | did that -- as long as it was possible.\nThey were a family of several sisters and only two husbands, | think. They all had\nchildren and | did the schoolwork with them and | went sledding with them.\nDoris Rauch 13\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 13",
        "A: Jewish children. They all went to Theresienstadt, too, but | don\u2019t know that any of\nthem survived.",
        "A: | can't really say exactly what happened in winter 1940. | know in December 1941.",
        "A: Oh, health was okay.",
        "A: Was not so good. But my mother, and | think most people were able to get things\non the black market, like coffee for instance. There was no real coffee. But we were\nable to get some black coffee. Um cigarettes. | was smoking by then unfortunately.",
        "A: | was still speaking German with my mother. In fact, my mother -- you know, her\nCzech was, it was called , which means Kitchen Czech. She just could\ntalk Czech with the maids -- with the maid, we had only one.",
        "A: There was less food to be had. And | guess, the hours were shorter and we were\n-- the hours we could shop were shorter. And you couldn't sit on the park bench\nbecause it said there, \u201cNot for Jews.\u201d You couldn't go to a coffee house or a\nrestaurant. It was all forbidden to Jews. So you\u2019d spend most of your time doing your\nDoris Rauch 14\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 14\nchores and being at home and shopping when you could or visiting friends when you\ncould.",
        "A: | don\u2019t remember. | know we couldn't go -- we loved movies; we couldn't go to\nmovies anymore. But we could read. | remember reading Gone with the Wind, day\nand night.",
        "A: In German, of course. And, | guess we talked about boys. Oh, | never talked about\nTom Shtunda (ph), that was a very important part of our life in normal times, you\nknow. We had so-called dancing lessons, but what it really was was -- we didn't learn\nto dance. Somehow, we knew how to dance and that\u2019s where you met boys. Get\ndates with boys.",
        "A: The dates as far as people and young men were still there continued, but not the\ndancing classes.",
        "A: And then the deportation started. And we had -- | remember we had a poor Jewish\nlady who came to us for the midday meal, which was the main meal, every week. It\nwas sort of immensurate (ph), if you Know what | mean. And she was one of the first\nwho had to go because she was not a Czech citizen. Maybe she was from Germany\nor Austria, | don\u2019t know. She had to -- she went to Poland with the first transport.\nThen, | don\u2019t Know, but it was in the same transport and a cousin of my mother\u2019s,\none of the owners of the fur business, where my father later worked, he and his two\nDoris Rauch 15\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 15\ndaughters -- the mother was no longer alive -- were also sent to Poland, which was\nunheard of because he was very well-to-do. And why they had to go, | don\u2019t know.",
        "A: That's what they said; that\u2019s what we were told. And then, Theresienstadt was\nfounded and my mother\u2019s oldest brother, the one where we used to have our\n, and his family, which consisted of his wife and three children -- no, no.\nThe youngest son had immigrated to England, but the two older sons were still at\nhome. They were sent away, we didn't know where.",
        "A: | think in November. But December came and it was our turn. And we had no idea\nwhere we were going. But we went to Theresienstadct.",
        "A: Some time before that, we had to register at the Jewish Community. All Jews had\nto register. | don\u2019t know ff all did, but we did. Most Jews did. And the way we learned\nabout it was that you got some sort of printed paper under the door where you were\ncalled for a certain day to a school. That\u2019s where we all were assembled. And they\ntaught you exactly how much, what you can take. | think it was 50 kilos if I\u2019m not\nmistaken. And you were allowed to take blankets, you know, feather blankets. And a\npail, | guess for washing the floor, but that\u2019s what we were allowed to. And | remember\nmy mother packing for this trip and putting a whole little pail again of jam into that pail\nand covering it up with other things. And | was very upset about it. | thought they\nwould catch her with that and we would be punished. It was very cowardly. But\nDoris Rauch 16\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 16\nfortunately, my mother wasn't and it was a very good thing that she brought the pail\nof jam. And you know, friends who rested (ph) in here came to help us. And |\nremember a class-- a Jewish classmate of mine who had learned to be a -- what is\nit? It\u2019s my age; | can\u2019t think of what -- a pollster. He came and sewed for us something\nto cover those feather beds. We each had something -- it was a handle so that we\ncould carry. And the housekeeper and someone else came to -- you must know that\nin our bathroom, you had to heat a huge stove. Stove?",
        "A: But it wasn't gas. You had to use a____ in coal | guess. And she came and\nattended to the stove so that we all could take a bath, the ones who had to go. And\nthe people were very kind and helped out. You know, things that you could possibly\nuse were immediately sold out, like flashlights. You know, we all wanted to take\nflashlights, so it was very hard to get them. Things like that that you could possibly\nuse. And so we ran this in the school -- Well, first of all, | have to say that -- not\ntransport -- that we had to walk to the school at night, when it was dark, so that the\npopulation wouldn't see it. And then we spent | think three days in the school, where\nwe were registered and the SS was already in there, or the Gestapo, | don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yes. No, the name | don't know. But the street (ph), it was Merhout.",
        "A: You know, | don't remember, but probably a thousand. Transports usually were a\nthousand, but I\u2019m really not sure about that.",
        "A: We stayed there --",
        "A: On the floor. And we young ones helped with the luggage, you know, to get it up\nthe stairs because | think it was a three-story school.",
        "A: You know, | don\u2019t remember anything about it, whether they fed us or not. | don\u2019t\nknow. | just remember then, on the third day, early in the morning, we had to stand\nat attention in the courtyard there. It was still dark. And then, again, we walked to the\ntrain, which left from the usual station. | don\u2019t know how the -- well, it was night. And\n| guess no other trains left.",
        "A: These were regular train cars, yes. And on the way, we somehow learned that we\nwere going to Theresienstadt.",
        "A: | don't think so. Of course, my mother\u2019s older brother was already there. But they\nwere not allowed to write. So | don't think we knew it.",
        "A: | think it took days, if I\u2019m not mistaken. | don\u2019t know why. Maybe it didn\u2019t. | really\ndon't remember. But we were really one of the earliest transports, so we left behind\neverything we had left. The furniture, the --",
        "A: | have no recollection. | think | was calm. But only because | was young, you know.\n| didn\u2019t -- we had no idea what was in store for us. And | mean almost also of those\nDoris Rauch 18\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 18\nthree and a half years when | was in Persna (ph), | always thought it would be better\nin the next place. So optimism helps, | think, but it\u2019s the optimism of youth.",
        "A: We arrived at Theresienstadt and were put into barracks, you know.",
        "A: Yes. We were still together. And first, we were in the smaller room. | think we were\nthe first people in this particular barracks.",
        "A: A name. They called it , which was a spelling for -- in English, it\u2019s\nThe Raisin, isn\u2019t it? So it was called Dresdner Barracks. And this was strictly women\u2019s\nbarracks. The men lived in the Sudatin barracks.",
        "A: Well, really, | think we were the first -- no, we couldn't have been the first transport\nbecause my aunt was already there, the wife of my mother\u2019s oldest brother. | don't\nknow -- | think there was room for 3,000 people. There were 3,000 when the barracks\nwere filled. But in the beginning, there were not many people. And we picked the\nsmaller room. There were maybe ten people in there.",
        "A: | think it was just the two of us. And of course we came to know all the others who\nwere there.",
        "A: Nothing, | think. We just made it as comfortable as possible with our blankets and\nwe slept on the floor, of course. And I'll tell you a typical story for me. One day, things\nstarted to disappear from our luggage. And we couldn't understand it -- or | certainly\ncouldn't understand it. And | remember asking my mother, \u201cMother, do you think that\nJews steal?\u201d | couldn't imagine that Jews would steal one from the other. | learned\nmuch better later on. But | eventually worked in the post office. You will laugh about\nthe post office. It was like that in the first few months at Theresienstadt. The Czechs\nbelieved in the town. And we were in the barracks and were not allowed out. But\nthere were some people who were allowed out, like the guard -- not guards. They\nwere the ghetto policemen who watched over each barracks. And they could go to\ntheir administration | think. There were certain people who were allowed out. But |\nthink June 1942, the Czechs still lived in their houses there. Then they were\nevacuated and then the ghetto was opened, you know. Then we could go out. But\nwe left soon after that so | didn\u2019t experience that. But as long as we were confined to\nthe barracks, | worked. Every barracks had a post office, which was a room. And\nsince the men were separated from their wives and children, they wrote letters to\neach other. Or the husbands sent dirty laundry to their wives to wash.",
        "A: To the women\u2019s barrack. Or the women sent the clean laundry back. And if\nsomeone had two extra potatoes, he could send it to his wife or his children and so\non. And that was -- that kept me busy. And | met a lot of people that way because |\nhad to go and distribute. | had to put the room numbers on the letters and then\ndistribute them. And my mother worked -- | just saw that, I\u2019d forgotten it, but when |\nDoris Rauch 20\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 20\nstarted reading the letter, she worked in the office of the -- each barracks had a\nJewish commander. And she worked in the office for him. And we later on moved to\na different room where his wife was also in that room. So maybe that\u2019s how she got\nthe job. | don\u2019t remember that. And of course, there was not much food. And they\ngave us soup made from -- | don\u2019t know what that is. You know, it\u2019s like -- it\u2019s a\nvegetable and it\u2019s big.",
        "A: Turnips. Yeah. They were orange. Everything was made with turnips, which in\nCzechoslovakia they were used to feed the cattle, the pigs. You must have learned\nabout turnips in your other interviews. And we got a piece of bread and sometimes\nmargarine, sometimes jam.",
        "A: | guess we ate it in the course of time.",
        "A: No, then | still went. | voluntarily went to a place in Bohemia where they needed\npeople to plant trees.",
        "A: This was from Theresienstadt, maybe in May. May of \u201842. I\u2019m not sure it was May,\nbut | think so. And | didn't tell my mother, but when she heard this and | told her\neventually, she volunteered to go along on the transport because she felt we\nshouldn't be separated, which we later were.",
        "A: We left in May and we were there for maybe six weeks. And in a way, it was a\nvery fortunate thing because we wrote to some of our friends who were still there --",
        "A: No, still in Czechoslovakia, not yet in Theresienstadt. You see, it took some time\nafter they got all the Jews in Czechoslovakia to Theresienstadt. And we did this so,\nyou know, everyday we went for supper to an inn in the country. There were various\nplaces in Bohemia where we did this work. But in that place where | was with my\nmother, we went to supper everyday to a certain inn. And there we talk to the owner\nof the inn and asked him whether it would be alright if we had a package sent to him,\nto his address. And we always told the people to whom we wrote what name to write\nus, to send a -- by then, we recognized which was for us, you know? Because other\npeople did the same thing. And so we collected quite a bit of food, which we brought\nback to Theresienstadt.",
        "A: Trees, yeah.",
        "A: For us, it wasn't so hard, for the young people, you know. But for my mother it was\nvery hard. And the man in charge of us was very nasty to her and kept talking about\nthe old can't do her work and so on. So that was hard. But she took it in\nher stride. And so, we came back to Theresienstadt. In the meantime, my uncle\nNorbert Troller had arrived there. And | don\u2019t know if he was there when we left or\nnot, | don\u2019t know. But anyhow, he had lost so much weight. He had always been a\nDoris Rauch 22\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 22\nroly poly, you know. And he was terribly thin and of course, we were very happy to\nhave brought that food in to contribute to his subsistence. He became stronger again.",
        "A: Now we are back at Theresienstadt in June. As | said, the Czechs were evacuated\nand then, in the meantime, there were more and more people coming of course.\nThere was, for instance, a transport from Vienna where a sister of my grandmother's\nwas in there. And it was just terrible for the old people. There was no room anymore\nand they put them in the cellars and--",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, we did know she was there.",
        "A: Probably word of mouth, yeah. By that time, we were allowed to go out, and so\nwe went to visit her. She died soon after that, fortunately. But by that time,\nTheresienstadt was full, full of people from everywhere. Germany, and also, | don\u2019t\nremember that, but | remember this old aunt, Tanta Fritzen (ph). Also, my favorite\naunt, you know, the one | told you about who was left in Berdenau, and all her family\nwas gone. She came to Theresienstadt, too, and she became a nurse there.",
        "A: Amie (ph) Weiner. And | loved her almost as much as my father, much more than\nmy mother. So | was very happy she was there.",
        "A: My father\u2019s older sister.",
        "A: Transports left for the East all the time. We had no idea where they were going. It\nwas a rumor it was to Poland, but we didn't really Know. And the most important thing\nin Theresienstadt laws, to have connections to get out of a transport, not to have to\ngo. Because there at least, we knew what we had. And we did not know what was\nwaiting for us. So mother and | got into transport twice, | think. And once, | had a\nboyfriend there who was a ghetto policeman. And he said that we were engaged,\nwhich we were not. And ghetto policemen could save people. So he saved us that\ntime, or at least, | think it was him. We don't really know. And then, | think there was\na second time where possibly my uncle, Norry (ph) is his name, saved us because\nhe was in the technical department. He was an architect. And the technical\ndepartment had a lot of clout. And so he said that my mother was his sister and we\ncouldn't possibly go. And so we didn't go. But the third time, it didn\u2019t work anymore,\nand... You want me to tell you something about Theresienstadt?",
        "A: Yes, | was again in the post office.",
        "A: Back to the post office, yes.",
        "A: Minimal amount of food. One unusual thing in Theresienstadt was that they made\ndumplings, Czech dumplings, which I\u2019m sure did not exist in any other concentration\nDoris Rauch 24\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 24\ncamp. And that was always day of joy when they made dumplings. They were so big,\nyou know, and inside was jam. And of course, we were very happy about that.",
        "A: In the same room. Well no. Maybe, you know. Maybe it was in between the first\nroom and the second room. | really don\u2019t remember, but altogether we were only in\ntwo rooms, my mother and I.",
        "A: No, no. You ate in your room.",
        "A: You sat on your mattress on the floor, and that\u2019s where you -- you had to stand in\nline to get your food. Each barracks had a kitchen. And that\u2019s where you stood in line\nto get your food or to get your bread, whatever you got.",
        "A: It was something they called coffee, but it was just brown water, and a piece of\nbread which had to last you all day long.",
        "A: Lunch was | think -- lunch was the main meal, so it must have been that horrible\nsoup. What is the name of the vegetable?",
        "A: Yeah, turnip soup. And bread again.",
        "A: And then dinner? It was again turnip soup and bread, and maybe that\u2019s when we\ngot the dumpling, or maybe it was at lunch, | don\u2019t know.\nDoris Rauch 25\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 25",
        "A: Once a week perhaps.",
        "A: Well, there was a big sort of washroom. Since it was the barracks for soldiers,\nthere were maybe 20 spigots there where you washed with cold water. And you\nknow, | don\u2019t remember anything about the toilets. They must have had lots of toilets.\nAnyhow, | don\u2019t remember any hardship with toilets there. And at least we had plenty\nof cold water. The funny thing was that, you know in Europe, people put their bedding\ninto the windows to air out. Everyone does, all over Europe. And we did it, even in\nTheresienstadt because there were sort of, what do you call them?",
        "A: Yes. Arches. There was a walkway to the various rooms and then those archways.\nAnd we put our bedding out there to air every morning. Maybe that\u2019s why we didn't\nhave ___ or lice. Because later, we had that too.",
        "A: Yes. Our health was okay.",
        "A: Yeah, or a few days before then. We got the summons that we had to go. And my\nboss in the post office, he was the head over all administration post office. And he\nsaid that he knew the man who was the guy, the top man on the transport. And he\nwould tell him about me, that if he needed any help, a secretary or whatever, that he\nrecommended me. And then we were put into a separate barracks, those who went\non the transport, and where they, again, | think for three days. And my mother met\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nDoris Rauch 26\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 26\nsome distant relative whom she hadn't seen for years and years, who had a\ndaughter. And she introduced us. And then that also prompted a boyfriend there with\nwhom | thought | fell in love. But | think it was just leaning on someone, you know.\nAnd then we started. We were loaded into the train. | have no recollection how we\ngot to the train. We must have walked, but | can\u2019t imagine that we carried all the\nluggage.\nEnd of Tape One\nDoris Rauch 27\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 27\nTape Two",
        "A: And then we were loaded on the train and travelled northeast, | guess. We had no\nidea where we were because the train, in the beginning, never stopped, or maybe |\nwas too involved with my boyfriend to pay attention where we were going. But |\nremember we stopped in Riga which is the capitol of Latvia.",
        "A: This was a regular train, not a freight train -- not that other persons were on the --\nno. What do you mean by regular --?",
        "A: Yes. We were sitting on benches. And we stopped here and there and they\ndistributed some food and water which we had gotten along from Theresienstadt.\nAnd so that we had something to eat and we had something to drink. And | remember\nat one of those stops, | saw a woman in a white nursing uniform with a red cross on\nher cap, distributing water. And she was blonde and blue-eyed and | thought, \u201cThat\nmust be someone from the Swedish Red Cross.\u201d As it turned out later, | was with her\nin camp for a long time and she was from my home town. | had never seen her\nbefore. She had a very Scandinavian name; her name was Inga (ph) Sylten. But she\nwas Jewish. And so, yes, my mother, who as | told you was a very smart, wrote a\npostcard to someone at home and threw it out of the window, hoping someone would\nDoris Rauch 28\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 28\nget it. Whether someone got it, | don\u2019t know. And even-- as | told you, we stopped in\nRiga, and word got around that they wanted us to get out there. But we did not.",
        "A: No, no. | guess there were toilets. | don\u2019t remember. No, were never allowed off\nthe train except for the people who came around with the food and the water and so\non. They went outside train. And so we went on from Riga. And the whole thing took\nfive days and five nights, that | know. And finally we came to a small station, which\nas it turned out later was in Estonia. Estonia is the northern-most of the three bounty\ncountries (ph). And there were some SS men out there and we all got out of the train-\n- No, before we got out of the train, they came in and they distributed postcards. And\nthey said that we could write home; that we were working in agricultural environment,\nand that we are fine. So we all did this. Whether they ever sent it, | don\u2019t know. But\njust imagine that they think up something like that just for shame, you know.",
        "A: No. No idea. My mother did it, I\u2019m sure. Maybe | did it too. | don\u2019t remember. So\nthen, we got out of the train. And those SS men were standing there telling some to\ngo where blue, light blue buses were standing. They told them to go there. And some\nthey picked out, mostly young people, and said that they should help unload the\nluggage.",
        "A: It\u2019s not even a city. It's a small place called Raasiku.",
        "A: In Estonia, yeah. And the men were, | think, mostly Estonian SS because we saw\nthem later. They were Estonian. But there were some Germans there too. And so |\nwas picked out to help with the luggage. And my mother was sent on ahead. And we\neach had in our hand a pillow, a pillowcase, to which was folded the fur from our--we\ncame to Theresienstadt with a cold and the fur lining, which could be buttoned in. So\nthis was summer, so the fur lining was out, and it was in those two pillows. And my\nmother went ahead, and then | ran after her and gave her my pillow and said, \u201cLook,\n| will have to work and we'll meet later. You take both.\u201d And they told us that they\nwould meet those people who go in buses later on in the camp. So we helped\nunloading the luggage, which | don\u2019t remember having done, but | must have done\nit. And then they put the luggage and us on trucks. And we drove and came into the\nwoods; and there was like a camp there, wooden barracks. About five wooden\nbarracks with the -- you should have come five years earlier when | still could think\nof words.",
        "A: Yeah. Surrounded by barbed wire and towers with soldiers up there with guns.\nAnd | had some hand luggage. And | went into -- | saw that there was a line of people\nlined up in front of one of those barracks. But | went to another barrack and put my\nhand luggage there.",
        "A: Men and women, yes.",
        "A: Yes. There were children. And they picked out about -- | would say about 50\nwomen and 50 men. Only the men did not come with us. | don\u2019t know what -- they\ncame into a different camp, but around there too because once, we were allowed to\nsee them. So | left my hand luggage in the barrack, but | myself, stupid as | am, |\nwent into the line where the other people stood in line to get into this one barrack. |\nhad no idea what that was. And when my turn came, it was pitch dark in the barrack.\nAnd there those SS men who made us undress and do all sorts of gymnastics. They\nwent through what -- | probably had a purse, you know, and they found various things\nin there that they wanted to have. Took them out. Then we had to exercise so if we\nhad anything in our vagina that it would fall out. And it was pretty awful, you Know, to\nundress completely in front of those men. But there was nothing we could do. So\nthen, when we got through, we just walked out -- got dressed and walked out and\nwent into the barrack where | had left my luggage. You know, if | had just stayed\nthere, | probably wouldn't have had to go through all that. But that\u2019s how naive | was.\nSo then they unloaded all the luggage and put it in another barrack. And then we\nlived in this barrack -- yeah, our families were not there. So we asked them, \u201cYou\nsaid we would meet our families here.\u201d And they said, \u201cWell, we sent them to a camp\nthat is heatable\u201d (It was September, you know.) \u201cso they wouldn't freeze in winter.\u201d",
        "A: No. Only this one young girl -- remember, my mother had met a relative in the\nseparate barracks there? She was only 15 or 16 years old. | was 22. Not yet 22. No,\nyes, just 22. She was the only one. And there were some girls there -- there were\nmostly young girls -- who cried terribly because they were separated from their\nDoris Rauch 31\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 31\nfamilies. And most of us couldn't understand that. Why were they sent there and the\ncamp had deceived them? We were going to see them again. So we lived for | don't\nknow how many years, two years or more, thinking we would see our families again.\nWe never heard about gassing or shooting. We had never heard about anything like\nthat. So we spent our time unpacking the luggage. You know that it didn\u2019t occur to\nus, \u201cHow come-- what do the other people wear whose luggage it is?\u201d It didn\u2019t occur\nto -- or at least not to me. And of course, we had the advantage that if we found\nsomething we could use, we took it. But there was also from the luggage jewelry that\nwe gave to the Germans, and money. You know | told you, in the dark barrack how\nhe took things out of my pocketbook. For instance, | had -- it was a pencil, you know\nlike an automatic pencil? But it was a much thicker pencil which my uncle had given\nme. He used it in his work as and architect. And he had given me that with rolled up\nmoney in there. They took it. So they must have known that people hide things. So\nthen, you know, the clothes had to be sorted into, | don\u2019t know, dresses and shoes\nand whatever. And those SS people took them away by and by. But we found food\nthere, too, so we cooked for ourselves, you know, we found alcohol stoves on which\nwe could cook. And we just used them. And we found our own things, of course,\nwhich came in very handy later on because we exchanged them for food with the\npeasants and other people in Estonia so that we were not as starved as most people.",
        "A: where | had put my bag down.",
        "A: Mmm. | don\u2019t know. There were about 50 of us. And you know, there were two\nwooden platforms -- downstairs and upstairs -- and we lived --",
        "A: That\u2019s where we lived, that\u2019s where we cooked. We just did all of it there. That was\nlike our home. And people formed group. And | formed a group, | think, with this 16-\nyear-old girl.",
        "A: That was the youngest.",
        "A: She was the youngest and we christened her \u201cBaby,\u201d Baby Nada (ph) we called\nher. She still had the name. She lives in Israel. Her husband doesn't like it at all that\nwe call her that. So you know, gradually, friendships developed and certain people\nmoved in together and cooked together and shared everything.",

        "A: Was our work, yes.",
        "A: No, no. Not in that camp.",
        "A: No. We were -- | then was -- of course the Germans, or the SS elected -- not\nelected, but stipulated a leader of the group of us. And she happened to be a\nschizophrenic individual, | think. And for instance, she picked -- there was to go a\nDoris Rauch 33\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 33\ntransport for work to an acre place, and | was picked because | spoke\nGerman. So she was against German speakers. There were about 25 or 30 of us\nwho were sent on the transport. The others stayed in the barracks and still worked\nwith the luggage, you know? And that was pretty tough because we didn\u2019t get enough\nto eat and we had to work very hard.",

        "A: No, it was just a temporary one.",
        "A: Yeah, but we took everything we had, which wasn\u2019t much, along. And it was sort\nof --",

        "A: | don\u2019t know if we did there or not. | don\u2019t think so. | know that when we later came\nto Reval, which is Tallinn today, they made us take off the scarves. So maybe we still\nhad them. Because they didn\u2019t want the population of Tallinn to know who we were.\nAnd so we were there, | think, harvesting for about six weeks. It was really back-\nbreaking work which we were not used to.",
        "A: Then we came back, and they separated us to a different barrack. We were not to\nhave been in touch with the others who had stayed there, like if we were paryas (ph).\nAnd so we were still in the barrack in winter. And we didn't do any work, except that\nthey took us out about once a day to collect wood in the woods there for burning in\nour stove. And they brought us food, whatever there was. | don\u2019t remember, that at\nall. And | was made to be in charge -- oh, | forgot -- of this particular group in the\nbarracks because he remembered my name \u2018cause they had once caught -- | forgot\nto tell you, you know, when we -- | told you we met a man once, the men who went\non our transport were in a different camp, but close by. They let us get together one\nday, one Sunday, so that some of the girls saw their fathers and their brothers. And\n| saw my boyfriend and then | discovered a very good friend of my father\u2019s, you know,\naman probably in his fifties, whose wife had probably gone with my mother. But they\nhad picked him so he must have looked pretty healthy. And when | saw him walking\nby later, | threw him a package with socks and things | had from food to that | had\nfound in the luggage there. And this one of those SS men remember me because of\nthat, because | was caught, you know? And he was caught, but they didn\u2019t do\nanything to us. But he remembered me. And that's why he made -- he remember my\nDoris Rauch 35\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 35\nname and he put me in charge of the people in this barracks we had come back from\nwork. Now I\u2019m the least likely person to lead a group and | know | always had to find\nsomeone who would clean the toilets. | remember the toilets there. And no one\nwanted to do it. And so in the end, | said I\u2019d do it. That\u2019s how much of a leader | was.\nSo we were there, back in the woods, and then they said we were going to Tallinn,\nwhich was Reval then. And we would work in making clothes, you know, like a\nmanufacturer of coats or dresses or whatever, which was an absolute lie. But that\u2019s\nwhat they said. And they took us -- now those were most -- | forgot to say something\nagain. | think that happened while we were in on the potato farms that\nanother transport came from Germany, from Berlin and Frankfurt. And they again\npicked out the young people. And -- mostly young, there were a few older men among\nus. And so they moved in with those other people. And then the call came for us to\ngo to Reval, and there were some of the Germans went and we went in separate\nbarrack, in the red barrack. And they brought us to the police. And we stayed in the\npolitical , In Reval.",

We were in rather modern cells where we were ten people to a cell.",

So, we're also very fair, you see. We changed beds. Always different people\nhad to -- one had to sleep on the cabinet. No, yes. And two on the floor, one on the\nluggage and one on the floor and several in the beds. But we always took turns. And\nin the morning, the guards came -- they were women.

So with that we were supposed to do\nhard labor in the harbor, in the port. And we were tearing down -- see the Russians\nhad attacked Estonia -- was it -- first a Jew-- no. The Russians had attacked Estonia\nand the harbor was in disrepair, all the barracks, whatever, the little houses, they had\n-- it was all kaput (ph). And so this firm of Holzmann was charged with rebuilding the\nharbor. And on the first day, when we went to work, the man in charge of Holzmann,\nhis name was Gr . He was a not very tall man with a red beard and red hair.\nHe had us a long speech saying that if one tried to escape, that ten would be shot.\nSo that put us in our place.

Most of those men were pretty good to us. And then there were some\nPolish men too. They were the so-called Folks Deutsche (ph). They made believe\nthat they were German-speaking, but some of them were not. They didn\u2019t know\nGerman. They -- some of them were pretty anti-Semitic. But altogether, they were\nnot really anti-Semitic and | think it had to do with the fact that we were all young girls\nand pretty good-looking. So most of them treated us alright. And one of them was\nalso from Frankfurt. He was in charge of the whole group. And he picked out some\nDoris Rauch 38\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 38\ngirls who came from Frankfurt, and really was like a father to them. And brought them\nfood and let them do all sorts of things.

        "A: For instance, when we left, we still thought that our families were alive. And for\ninstance, when we were going to Reval, we had to bring all our stuff that we were\nDoris Rauch 40\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 40\ntaking along to a meadow, and the SS went through it. And for instance, | had sewn\ntogether two of those feather blankets. That\u2019s not the right word. | have it now. What\nis it?",
        "A: No, no. It was a comforter, but with feathers inside. Down -- down whatever.",
        "A: Quilt. Yeah, maybe quilt. And | had sewn a whole dress and stockings and\nunderwear and everything for my mother in between those two blankets and sewn it\ntogether. But of course, they found out, you know? They ripped it apart and there\nwas all that. So we always tried to look out for them, still hoping, you know. But later\non, for instance, when we worked in Reval -- we did not always work in the ports.\nSometimes they sent us to a different assignment, like, once we were in a sewing\nmill and two of us always tried to get out of that and we went begging, which had two\npurposes. First of all, to get something to eat. And secondly to -- if the people were\nfriendly -- to ask did they know anything about any other camps. So we found out\nabout another camp and we thought that maybe our families were there. The camp\nwas Kloga. And others told us that they are not alive anymore. But we didn't believe\nthem. So yeah. We sometimes went to other assignments and it was always a joy,\nsomething different, something new. One of my friends in the camp -- | mean in\nEstonia -- was from a mixed marriage. Her father was Jewish and her mother was\nnot. And they still lived in Prague. And one or two of those Germans who were in\ncharge of her went to visit the parents and I\u2019m sure gotsome money from them and\nDoris Rauch 41\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 41\nbrought stuff back for her -- money and food and so on.

        "A: Yeah. But mostly at the pier. That was our main job. And as | said, we were not\nallowed to wear the stars.

And we were not able to say goodbye to those construction workers and --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, end of \u201843. And so then we were sent into another camp which was called\nEreda. And there were already Lithuanian and Polish Jews -- most of them men and\nwomen.",

        "A: | don\u2019t know exactly, but | think something like that. And there were already Polish\nand Lithuanian Jews, most of them were from Vilna, which is probably familiar to you.\nAnd now they told us -- first of all, we heard Yiddish for the first time in our lives. It\ndidn\u2019t exist in Czechoslovakia or in Germany -- maybe it did, but | don\u2019t think so. And\nso we had -- at first, we had trouble understanding them. But we did because it\u2019s a\nDoris Rauch 42\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 42\nreally sort of similar to German. Only some words will really confuse you. Like, |\nremember one told me \u201c . The word, the peasants. And | thought -\n-nacht in German is night -- how do they get out at night to go to the peasants to get\nsome food? So it turned out nachten (ph) means yesterday.",
        "A: No, men and women. A mixed group. and we were in the same camp.",
        "A: We lived in barracks, yes. The men had separate barracks from us.",
        "A: Still wearing our own clothes and no star. | don\u2019t think we had to -- no.",
        "A: That camp was terrible. And you know, the toilets were really -- were not toilets. It\nwas a big --",
        "A: Latrine, yes. That\u2019s the word. And you had to go for ten minutes to get there. It\nwas all mud in the camp in winter anyhow. And some of it dried up fortunately. So\nthen you had a place in front of each barrack where you could go -- should go only if\nyou urinate -- at night so that you don't have to go. And we tried to keep it clean, you\nknow. We had brushes and cleaned it with water and soap. We tried to keep it as\nclean as possible. But eventually we had lice and we had all sorts of vermin. Fleas.\nFleas we already had. | forgot to mention. You know there was a time in the prison\nwhen all the ones who had stayed back in the first camp were brought to prison. But\nthen they moved us all into rooms in another part of the prison. We were no longer\nDoris Rauch 43\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 43\nin those cells, but in those rooms. And we had straw pallets which were full of fleas.\nSo that was awful.",
        "A: Yes. | remember | had a pajama that put a rubber band around here so that they\ncouldn't get in and to my sleeves too, but it didn\u2019t help. They got in. Oh yes. We had\nfleas, and lice | think we acquired in Ereda. And then people starting having typhoid\nfever -- no, typhus. But the lice transmitted.",
        "A: No, in fact, it first started in Theresienstadt that people stopped having their\nmenstrual. And there was one year a girl in our room who was so -- she was married\nand she was worried to death that she was pregnant -- because we didn't know that.\n| don't Know anymore how long | had my menstrual period, but | lost it, too, which\nwas a blessing because there were times where we didnt have any material to\nprotect us.",
        "A: We did very, very hard work. Felling trees -- do you say felling? And then carrying\nthem on our shoulders. It was really very hard work. And eventually, | just said, \u201cI\ncan't do that.\u201d And | went to one of the doctors in the camp -- they were Jews -- and\ntold him couldn't they assign me to something else, that | just can\u2019t do that kind of\nwork. We -- well, we felled trees and cut them up and then we started building\nbarracks in the woods someplace else.",
        "A: Yes. And what we were building there, in the woods, was another camp, which we\ndidn\u2019t know. But some of our people then later went to the camp.",
        "A: Our guards were --",
        "A: Yeah, they [the commanders] were German. They were all German in that camp.\nBut the guards, if there were guards, which | can\u2019t think -- you know, they were really\nGerman SS. But not the guards -- | don\u2019t remember that we had any guards, but\nmaybe we did.",
        "A: We must have had, but | have no recollection of that.",
        "A: | don't think | was mistreated there.",

        "A: Yes, yes. | think end of \u201843, beginning of \u201844. And | don\u2019t remember any guards in\nthe camp, but there must have been. | just can\u2019t remember.\nDoris Rauch 45\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 45",
        "A: Most everything had been taken away. Either taken away or sold by us. We didnt\nhave very much anymore. And of course we --",
        "A: No, no. We didnt. Well, we made do with what we had or we exchanged things. |\nremember | had a short, warm coat. | don\u2019t know where | got it. And | gave it to this\nInga Sylten. | must tell you a story about Inga Sylten which is really like a novel..\nThere was an SS commander this particular camp. | even know his name. It was\nDrosin. He fell in love with her and she with him. And she work -- there was a separate\nbarrack where the commander lived. She worked as a, you know, cleaning up. And\nthis friend of mine of mixed parentage was the cook. She was a very good cook. So\nshe knew about what was going on between Inga and this man, but | will say that\nInga behaved very well. She always spoke up for us and he minded her. And |\nremember, for instance, that there came the command that we had to have our heads\nshaved. They started shaving the heads and she finally convinced him he shouldn't\ndo that. And so he stopped the whole thing. But to make a long story short, the two\nescaped together because word about what was going on got to Germany to his\nsuperiors and they sent another SS commander and before he even came, | think,\nthey escaped together and hid in the woods. But they caught them. You know, there\nwas a -- they just came from all sides. And he shot her and shot himself. So when\nwe learned that, we knew it for sure. So anyhow.",
        "A: Ereda. | stayed there until late in 1944. And | had a male friend there, too, from --\nhe even -- | have the -- I\u2019m relieving this to the Holocaust Museum, but I\u2019m not parting\nwith it yet. | had a young man friend there who had this ring made for me. There were\npeople in the camp who were very clever with their hands. | don\u2019t know where they\ngot the silver, but they did. And so | still have the ring.",
        "A: The ring gives my name on top and on the inside is his name.",

        "A: We stayed until late 1944.",
        "A: | understand yes. But | don\u2019t Know personally about it.",
        "A: No. | was too cowardly. But | Know several young women when we were in Tallinn\nwho had offers from Estonians who worked on boats to take them to Finland. But no\none ever had the courage to do it because they told us if one escapes, ten will be\nshot.\nDoris Rauch 47\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 47",

        "A: We slept outside. That\u2019s where they finally shaved my hair. And we were there for\nsix weeks. It didn\u2019t rain once. Like if God had -- or the breath of God had been looking\nout for us.",
        "A: | think because of the lice. Or that\u2019s what they said, you know? They shaved all\nthe -- for us, it was very late in the game.",
        "A: For us, it was the first time. You know, they had made an attempt in the beginning,\nin Ereda, but Inga stopped them. But that\u2019s where they finally did it.",
        "A: Terrible. Terrible. Sometimes | see young women on TV nowadays. Like\nyesterday, | saw someone -- or this morning -- a singer with such very short hair. So,\nhow can she do that to herself. Yes, and | was very -- | didn\u2019t even talk about -- but\nstill in Ereda, | became very sick. | had been very high temperature, but there was a\nbarrack for sick people. But | didn\u2019t want to go there because | was afraid they would\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nDoris Rauch 48\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 48\ndo away with me. So | just existed with the high temperature.

        "A: Hepatitis. And people were put to work digging ditches to defend themselves\nagainst -- the Germans against the Russians. But | was so weak | just couldn't do it\nand | sort of went into a meadow and laid down there and just laid. And two SS\nofficers came by. And | was sure they would shoot me because | wasn\u2019t working but\nthey just looked and went away. So that was good luck. Then, after six weeks, they\nput us on a freighter -- or on a boat -- and we -- again, | was very sick. | didn\u2019t know\nwhat was going on.",
        "A: No. | was just lying there.",
        "A: Well, | probably walked on my own, with support. But on the boat, | didn't walk.\nThat's what | meant. And, | don\u2019t know how long we were on the boat. Then they\ntransferred us to a Kanai (ph) boat. And where we were so crammed in that | couldn't\neven sit or lie down. We were just like standing up like sardines. That | survived, that\nis a miracle.\nDoris Rauch 49\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 49",
        "A: This was men and women, yeah. And we came to Stutthof, which was a big camp\nin eastern Germany. And there, we had to undress completely and go under the\nshowers. We didn\u2019t know about gas, not yet. We had heard about shootings and so\non. But gas we didn\u2019t know. So it was -- they were real showers. It wasn\u2019t gas. And |\nstill have another treasure from the -- this is a watch that | had at home with me. |\ncarried it with me all the time. And in Stutthof, when we were under the show -- first |\nhad hidden it in the soap. And then | thought they would probably take the soap away\nfrom me, so | put it in my mouth, soapy as it was. And so, of course it didn\u2019t survive.\nBut | still have it.",
        "A: That's my watch.",
        "A: from home.",
        "A: All that time. Yes, and | had written a diary in Estonia. | wrote a diary everyday.\nBut now, when | saw they took everything away from us, | gave it to a man who was\nalso a prisoner there, and said would he save it for me? And he said yes. But | never\nsaw it again.",
        "A: No, from Estonia. | had written a diary while we were in Estonia. And | never,\nunfortunately, saw it again.",
        "A: In Stutthof, nothing. We were just sitting in the sand. In the sand. And | met several\npeople there from my hometown who had been in Riga. And there were daughters\nwith mothers. One daughter, one mother. Two couples like that. And one of these\ncouples, one daughter and mother, survived. The daughter lives in Vienna now. And\nthe other couple did not survive. So you know, you just ran into those people. It was\nan immense camp. And we didn't own anything. | didn\u2019t even have a spoon to eat\nwith. But someone else shared her spoon with me.",
        "A: No. Very little. Nothing, probably. There was something. Soup. Perhaps again, the\nturnip soup. | don't really know because it was the first real concentration camp that\n| had been to. And it was pretty awful. And thousands of women there -- the women\nwere separate again.",
        "A: Well we were in barracks.",
        "A: Yes, we were in barracks. But there was and all around where we sat around all\nday long.",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t work. We were not there for very long.",
        "A: | can tell you exactly. We came there on my birthday, August 26, 1944. And in\nOctober, we were sent on to Hamburg in Germany. | think that\u2019s enough. Do you still\nDoris Rauch 51\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 51\nfeel like it? In Hamburg, which was Hamburg Oxensal (ph), | became very sick\nimmediately. | had pneumonia and | think | had typhoid, but this is not for sure.\nPneumonia and pleurisy and typhoid and a terrible diarrhea, probably enteritis or it\nmay have been typhoid, | don\u2019t know. And after a month or so, they built a barrack\nwhich they called the , where the sick people were sent. There were\nonly, | think, six or seven of us in there. And | was there for what seems like months,\nbut | don\u2019t know, really, how long it was. But | survived, which was a miracle in itself.\nAnd my best friend was at that time the Schreiberen (ph) in this camp. She was in\ncharge of counting people and she was the secretary to the SS man and so on. And\nshe arranged for me not to have to go to the factory, but to be in the\nSchneiderstubben (ph) which was the place where they did sewing for the Germans.\nThere were a lot of SS men and women there and there was a professional\nseamstress, also a Jewish lady, from Frankfurt. So that\u2019s where | ended up working.\nAnd then one day in April, they said that we would be sent -- that we are being sent\nto Sweden now. And we couldn't quite believe it, but they said it. So they put us on\ninto cattle cars and we travelled and on the way we saw open cattle cars with dead\npeople in there. And then they unloaded us in, | think it was called Luneburg, and\nfrom there, we walked to Bergen-Belsen. So the thing with Sweden was not at all\ntrue. It was just another of those lies.",
        "A: Terrible. You know. We all know how that is. Because there was no air and no\nfood and just a pail, | guess. | really don\u2019t remember. It was terrible. And to see those\ncars filled with dead people. . . It was just awful. Of course, in the cattle cars, there\nDoris Rauch 52\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 52\nwere little windows up there we could see through. Anyhow, they unloaded us there\nand we were marched to Bergen-Belsen. And on the side of the road, in the ditches,\nthere were dead people everywhere. That was in April \u201845, shortly before Bergen-\nBelsen was liberated. We got into Bergen-Belsen and what it was like there, | Knew\nthat | couldn't survive that. Well, fortunately, | didn\u2019t have to survive it there because\nthree days later, the highest SS from Hamburg came back and said the factory\nneeded people. And he started reading all our numbers. But since | had never worked\nin the factory, he didn\u2019t read my number, but not everyone was around, so when no\none responded to a number, | went there because my two best friends were there.",
        "A: Well, | had one in Theresienstadt.",
        "A: | don\u2019t know. | don\u2019t know if | had the same number all the time or whether they\nchanged it. So anyhow, | joined this group.

        "A: Piled up. And so we came out of there. We marched along the road and there\nwere --\nEnd of Tape Two\nDoris Rauch 53\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 53\nTape Three",
        "A: And there were fliers thrown down from some airplane telling that the British were\nclose and that they would soon be here. We did not save the flier, but it was very\ngood to know about. And the men had to march us -- | forget to where because the\n_______ had been bombed. There were no more trains leading to Luneburg or -- no,\nthe place was Tellebeiden (ph) Hanover. That\u2019s where they unloaded us when we\nwent to Bergen-Belsen. You know, after the war, | read in Time magazine some letter\nto the editor from someone who lives in Tallinn. Either that -- I\u2019m not sure. Anyhow,\nthey said that they didn\u2019t know there was Bergen-Belsen there. When all the dead\npeople were lying close to the road. Anyhow, this guy marched us to -- | don\u2019t know\nwhere. We slept in the woods, covering us with leaves. We didn't run away. We got\nback to Bergen-Belsen. And when we got there, there was a whole new crew there.",
        "A: Hamburg . It was filled with people from other camps who had been\nevacuated there. And so we never went back to the factory to work. But we registered\nthose new prisoners. That was our new job. And then one day --",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "A: No, there was no medicine. There was no --",
        "A: Just being in bed and not working. But it was for a long time. | remember when I,\nfor the first time, went into the bathroom, there were mirrors there. And | just couldn't\nbelieve it when | saw myself. | said, \u201cI look like Christ at the cross.\u201d So we were used\nto register the new prisoners. And then one day, toward the end of April, they said,\n\u201cNow we will go to Sweden.\u201d Again, you see. So of course, we didn\u2019t believe it. But,\nlo and behold, we really went, in cattle cars, and got out in Flannsburg (ph), which is\nthe border between Germany and Denmark. And there we were -- there was already\na normal train standing. And we were taken over by the Danish Red Cross. And on\nevery seat, there was a package. Little satin breeches and chocolates. Then we\ncame through Copenhagen, and the Danes were on the platforms -- | remember one\nday holding up a newspaper saying \u201cHitler Dead.\u201d And of course, it was wonderful to\nhear that. So then we went by train and they unloaded us onto a boat, you know, a\nferry. And there they had papers sent for. And | never got to read (ph) anything\nbecause it was so -- you know, everyone just threw himself on those papers -- flowers\nand anything you can imagine. And then we arrived in . | don\u2019t know -- | think\nwe went on the train once more after the ferry. I\u2019m not sure. And in , we\nwere taken over by -- | guess it was the Red Cross. And we had to, once again,\nundress completely and they burnt all our clothes. And so that was, | don\u2019t know, the\n2nd of May maybe. And then we had to run into some pens and take showers there.\nThey had it all set up. It was wonderful. And they put us -- after we were all bathed\nand so on -- they put us in a covered tennis stadium where we slept on the floor. But\nfor us, it was joyous because they had white sheets -- white paper sheets, you know.",
        "A: It was hard. But they apparently knew exactly what to do because they fed us very\nlittle. And we, of course, thought they should feed us much more. But in Bergen -- as\nwe later heard -- in Bergen-Belsen, it was a catastrophe. People died from eating too\nmuch. And you know, the Swedes gave us new clothes. We went to factories and\npicked from clothes and underwear. Everything. But that was before the end of the\nwar. You know, the war, | think, ended on the 8th of May or 7th of May.

And my Czech\nfriends and | were in a town called . And there one day -- there we didn't\ndo anything, you know. They were just nice to us. And we went on hikes and had fun\ntogether and bicycles and so on. And one day, they had a sort of a little feast for us\nwhere there came a couple of ministers -- | forget of what religion. And they lectured\nto us -- | forget about what. And afterwards, there was coffee and cake. There were\nmaybe 30 or 40 of us in the scout hall where we were. And | just happened to sit next\nto one of those ministers and another friend -- the mixed one -- sat on the other side\nof him. And he asked me where we had been during the war and | told him about\nEstonia and so on.

And it took me awhile. | didn\u2019t arrive right away or beware\ngo to see him -- and | never did go to see him. | think | just didn\u2019t want to know really.\nBut | did write him a letter and he wrote me a letter back saying such-and-such\nhappened. That the people had to dig their own graves and were shot on the spot.\nAnd he wrote bad words. But he wrote very, you know, consolingly that maybe our\nfamilies were not among those people because he remembers that there were some\nJewish women seen in Reval working there. And maybe that\u2019s where my mother\nwas. And so -- so of course, that was us. And so that was that. And then in 1960 -- |\nthink in 1960 -- how did that come about? Well, | can\u2019t tell you the whole story.\nHowever, they caught some of those Estonian SS people and -- | mean | can tell you\nthe story, but it would be too long -- and some of our friends who lived in\nCzechoslovakia -- went to Tallinn as witnesses in the trial of those people.",

And she -- when she read in the paper about\nit, she called the newspaper and said that she was one of his victims. And then the\nnewspapers interviewed some others of our girls in New York. And one called me,\nDoris Rauch 60\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 60\ntoo. | was living in Chicago then. So you know, three of them, at least, are dead. And\nthen -- while the girls were testifying, they took them to that place where it all had\nhappened. And there is a monument there now. And it's not, apparently not only our\ntransport, the German transport. They also killed some Russians, | think. So it -- on\nthe monument, it was in all languages, | think. And so in 1992, we went there for the\nfiftieth anniversary of those times, of the day. And one of our friends who was also at\nthe trial as a witness now lives in Switzerland. She escaped in 1968 with her\nhusband. And she really built friendships there in Estonia, and they go there quite\nfrequently to visit. And, you see, this woman, Eugenia works for the\nJewish community there. Yeah, this -- Eugenia _____ works for the Jewish\ncommunity in Tallinn. And she worked on this book for years.

But |\npersonally just don't want to do it. And | have -- as | told you earlier -- | have all those\nconflicting feelings about my former classmates. And I\u2019m very attracted to reading\nDoris Rauch 61\nJuly 7, 1995\nPage 61\neverything about the Holocaust. Where some people like to stay away, I\u2019m very\nattracted to it. My uncle, Norbert Troller (ph), wrote the book about Theresienstadt\nwhich was published after he died. But he wrote -- that was his retirement job. He\nwrote his memoirs, not only about the war, but about his whole life.",
        "A: Yes. That read German a lot, too. And | have friends, but very few now, with whom\n| speak German. Now with Eva | never speak German.",
