And sometimes peopleSeptember 25, 2014\ndon\u2019t have much, because no one talked to them as a little child, but it sounds to me\nthat your father told you very \u2014 a lot about your family\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: Well, he told me that after the war. He certainly didn\u2019t tell me during the war,\nwhen I was growing up, when I was 10 years old, 15 years old, because it was too\ndangerous to know that you had a Jewish ancestor. Because according to the\nGerman law, my father was considered Jewish. I wasn\u2019t, but \u2014 the third generation,\nso that was kept a secret until after the war.

        "Q: Okay. You \u2014 so \u2014 but some part of your family was in Krakow, which would\nhave been part of the Austro-Hungarian empire in the 19\" century.",
        "A: Yes, my de \u2014 my mother came from Austro-Hungarian emp \u2014 Mielitz, and\nTarnow, who are where she was born and brought up, was part of the Austro-\nHungarian empire.",
        "Q: A question that is always \u2014 I-I\u2019ve always been curious about, was there a\ndifferent sensibility amongst people who were brought up in one part of Poland,\nversus another, given the different rulers, and the different policies of those rules?",
        "A: In\u2014in\u2014in some ways, yes. Administratively, militarily. I mean, the Poles had to\nfight in th-those armies, that were either Russian, German or Austrian. And they\nwere \u2014 th-they had different discipline, different ways of fighting. The same thing\nwith a civil administration. So, when Poland became independent in 1918, it was\nquite a problem to start administering the country in one single way.",
        "Q: Yeah, because people had different \u2014September 25, 2014",
        "A: Different backgrounds.",

        "A: Well, she didn\u2019t know much about the \u2014 the \u2014 her original background. Her\nstories were more about her parents, and her grandparents.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. What did your grandparents, that is, her parents, how did they support\nthe family, and the same question will be for your father\u2019s side: how did his parents\nsupport their family?",
        "A: Well, my \u2014 the parents were landowners, on my mother\u2019s side. On my father\u2019s\nside, they ha \u2014 his father married a shoemaker\u2019s daughter in Warsaw, and they had\na hard time, financially. And they \u2014 the grandfather didn\u2019t help him, because\nalthough he married somebody who was not acceptable, society-wise, so did his\noldest son Julian. And he didn\u2019t have anything to do with the grandchildren until\nmy father was 18, when, for the first time, he met his grandparents.",

She was ta \u2014 take\nme under a bridge and put some hard stones and make me kneel on for \u2014 for an hour\nwhen I was five years old. So that\u2019s my first memory. And one evening she told me\nsh-she would beat me in the middle of the night, wake me up. And my parents were\ngoing out to the opera, and I begged my mother not to go, and sure enough, an hour\nafter they left, or half an hour, she started beating me. And fortunately, my father\nleft the tickets to the ball behind, and entered while she was beating me, and she \u2014\nhe threw her the \u2014 out of the building. So he became a great hero of mine.",
        "Q: A sad \u2014 I mean, a very sad thing for \u2014 to happen to a little boy, but a good way\nfor a parent to appear, you know.",
        "A: Well, it prepared me for what was coming later on. When the Germans came, I\nwasn\u2019t surprised at their cruelty.\nSeptember 25, 2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s so sad, I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 yeah. What \u2014 what kind of family life do you\nremember? And I mean this in many ways.

And then in 1935, they\nbuild a house, specially designed by an architect, a landscape architect, in the\nsuburb of Zoliborz of Warsaw, and we moved there. So the \u2014 most of my\nmemories are from Zoliborz, which was a \u2014 a new suburb, mainly used by the\ngovernment and military elite.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And was it north or west, or south of Warsaw?",
        "A: It was north of Warsaw, the most northern part of Warsaw.",

        "A: Well, my father was against the \u2014 what he felt the Catholic church was holding\nback, the social progress. And he was very interested in equality, and in everybody\nhaving the same rights. This was something that he fought for during the first World\nWar, was for \u2014 not only for Poland\u2019s independence, but also for \u2014 give everybody\nthe opportunity and equality. And he felt the church was in \u2014 is \u2014 in \u2014 1-1n \u2014 like in\nFrance, where he studied, was holding them back. He was also very much against\nanti-Semitism, so that was one of the reasons he \u2014 actually, he became em \u2014 a\nMason, and he was very much interested in development of Poland, the social and\neconomic and physical. And then when he became the mayor of Warsaw, of\ncourse, he was able to put these plans into execution.",

So he was\nbrought up in his home in very patriotic Polish background. They had secret press\nthere, they had arms in the apartment when he was growing up. Then, he wasn\u2019t\nable to go to university in Poland, so he went to Belgium to study engineering. And\nthen he interrupted his studies, because the first World War started, and he joined\nthe Pilsudski\u2019s legions, and fought against Russia, and was very badly wounded on\nthe Ukrainian front. He was shot through by the machine gun, through the stomach,\nand was in hospital for about six to eight months. And it affected his whole life, his\nwhole nervous system. It\u2019s a \u2014 the only reason he survived, because was very cold\nwinter, it was January, and he froze on the \u2014 on the front, in the \u2014 but then he came,\nafter the war, and then soon after was the Polish-Soviet war, which Poland won. It\nwas the \u2014 one of the two countries that ever beat the Soviet Union, Afghanistan\nand Poland. And he was back in the army, he was in the intelligence service,\nmilitary intelligence, and he was very close to Marshall Pilsudski.September 25, 2014",
        "Q: So let it \u2014 let me interrupt. For many people, some of these events are not going\nto be familiar, so I\u2019d like you to tell me the dates. When was this Polish-Soviet war,\nwhen did it take place? And tell us a little bit about who was mi \u2014 Marshall\nPilsudski.",

And at first the Polish forces were\nwinning, and then the Soviet forces got all the way to Warsaw, and it looked like\nthat the \u2014 Poland was going to lose, and they were going to enter the rest of\nEurope, but they \u2014 wha-what is today called the miracle on the Vistula, Marshall\nPilsudski, together with Marshall Foch, the French support came up with a very\ngood military strategy, and beat the Soviets, and took hundreds of thousands of\nSoviet prisoners of war, and th-that was the end of the war, th-the \u2014 the Soviets\ncapitulated. And part of the agreement was that Poland could recoup all the arts,\npaintings, jewelry, and things which th-the Russians stole from Poland. And my\nSeptember 25, 2014\nfather was the head of the commission in Moscow, which together with my mother,\nwho went through and brought all the antiques, and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and things which\nthey found in museums, which were Polish, back to Poland.",

My mother worked, in order for him to study, and he went\nto Sorbonne, and he got his degree in political science.

        "Q: Pll \u2014 okay, I was thinking of asking this question later, but I\u2019ll ask 1t now: it is\nunusual for a city to have a president, or a vice-president, usually they have mayors.\nWhat is \u2014 what was Warsaw\u2019s situation \u2014",
        "A: The difference between the mayors and the presidents is that large cities like\nWarsaw, Krakow, Poznan, Gdansk, have presidents. Smaller towns, smaller\ncities, have mayors.",
        "Q: I see.September 25, 2014",
        "A: So that\u2019s the only difference, and it\u2019s basically the same functions, but a different\ntitle. And since Warsaw was the capitol of Poland, it was the most important city,\ntherefore the president of Warsaw was second in line to the president of Poland.",
        "Q: Oh, really?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Okay.",

So that\nwas then the natural that he followed, and was appointed president, during the\nwartime years, from 1939 to 1944.",
        "Q: That is an amazing \u2014 an amazing story in and of itself, and when we are into the\nwar years, I am going to want to know more about it, because, I mean, the questions\nthat can come up for being in such a position, incredible.\nSeptember 25, 2014",
        "A: It was a horrible position.",
        "Q: Yes, yes. But going back now to his \u2014 to his career, he made then, a jump from\nthe treasure ministry, into, let\u2019s say, the municipality.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Okay. And what was his \u2014 what were his responsibilities as vice-president?",

        "A: Well, she \u2014 she worked. She taught Polish to some Russians in fra \u2014 Paris. She\ndid everything she could in order to live on basically pennies. So, it was very\ndifficult times for them, but they managed it. And she wrote her memoirs, and my\nfather wrote his memoirs: my father\u2019s are published, my mother\u2019s are still\nunpublished.",
        "Q: And was this before you were born, all of this?",
        "A: Oh yes. This was all of when he wa \u2014 she wa \u2014 that\u2019s why she was waiting. She\nwanted to put him through university, to \u2014 to give him the opportunity, and only\nafter he became \u2014 started to go up in the treasury department, they decided to have\nme.",
        "Q: I see. And tell me now a little bit about their personalities. What kind of a\npersonality your father had, and your mother had.",
        "A: My mother was very outgoing. She loved people, and everybody loved her. Her\nmaternal instinct being bar \u2014 having to bring up her sisters and brother when she\nwas a teenager, taught her how to take care of it. Also, she had an example of her\nfather, who was also very interested in \u2014 1n helping people. The towns that they\nlived were very large Jewish population, and her father was known for taking care,\nand helping the poverty stricken Jews. And so my mother was brought up in the\nspirit of looking after people, and taking care. And this was one of the problem thatSeptember 25, 2014\nI had with her, because she was trying to take care of me too much, and I was too\nindependent. So we\u2019re very much alike, I\u2019m very much like my mother, but we had\nthat problem. We loved each other, but I wanted to be independent, and \u2014 and this\nlasted the whole li-lifetime. My father was completely different. My father was\nreally quite shy, to start with. He had to overcome it to become a public figure, and\nhe did very well in that. But he was an intellectual. He thought 10 times before he\nspoke, and he was very broadminded, liberal, and a \u2014 a\u2014 a very admired person in\nWarsaw, known and admired. Sometimes my mother would get on his nerves\nbecause she would say something just without thinking, and that would get him \u2014\nget him into apoplexy.",
        "Q: But it sounds like they were both \u2014 I mean, it sounds \u2014 they were very strong\npeople.",
        "A: They were both very strong people. Ver \u2014 extremely strong people, 1-1-in \u2014 in\ndifferent ways, quite opposite, but very much in love.",
        "Q: Also very nice.",
        "A: So the \u2014 I\u2014I was sumb \u2014 I met a cousin of mine in \u2014 in \u2014 1n Poland just months\nago, and they comparing our bring \u2014 how we\u2019re brought up. They were rich, and \u2014\nbut didn\u2019t have love. And we had lots of love, but we were not so rich.\nSeptember 25, 2014",
        "Q: Yeah, well that\u2019s \u2014 all of these things are crucial for a child, of course, in their\ndevelopment. And in many ways it helped, or \u2014 when you had a strong upbringing,\nwhen you\u2019re put into times of stress, sometimes you have some reserves to draw\nupon \u2014",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "Q: \u2014 you know.",
        "A: And I think that\u2019s what pulled me through the war.",
        "Q: Really. Yeah. So tell me a little bit about \u2014 you were born in 1929, yes?",

And my so-called uncle, he was one of my\nfather\u2019s wartime buddies, was the governor of the province, and I was lucky to be \u2014\nspend two summers in the governor\u2019s palace.",
        "Q: Wow.September 25, 2014",

        "A: \u2014 and I\u2014 I\u2014I learned how to have great social life, to a point that when I got\nhome, I told my mother that she didn\u2019t behave like a president\u2019s wife should, sh \u2014\nthe way Aunt Hella as the governor\u2019s wife \u2014 because they had balls every week,\nand lots of food and lots of dancing. And furthermore, I told her \u2014 told that my\nfather should be a right-winger, not a left-winger, and my mother told him that, and\nhe burst laughing, that this eight year old was trying to tell him how to \u2014 what kind\nof politics he should have. But I was just interested in all the nice things.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: All the wonderful cookies, and \u2014 and chocolates, and one day I even ordered\neight guys with \u2014 f-for a ball which didn\u2019t exist, and my uncle caught me and\nchased me around the palace.",
        "Q: How cute. How cute.",
        "A: So, I\u2014 I was full of beans.September 25, 2014",
        "Q: Yeah. It also sounds that the sense of \u2014 of what it is to be Polish was very strong\nin your family.",
        "A: Well, it \u2014 it \u2014 1t was not \u2014 it was only one family. I think that in school, the\nteachers, the family and everybody, was so excited to have a free and independent\nPoland, free for everybody. The Christians, the Jews were having, you know,\nparticularly the Jews had wonderful theaters, and \u2014 and \u2014 and social life, and at \u2014 in\nmy life, th-there was \u2014 I didn\u2019t run into any anti-Semitism, because well, the \u2014 my\nfather\u2019s closest friends were Jewish members of the prepe \u2014 legion police, legion,\nwho fought the [indecipherable] so the \u2014 I wa \u2014 religion was not an important part\nin my bri \u2014 upbringing.",
        "Q: Well, it also \u2014 I mean, from what you were saying is that many people will \u2014 will\nsay in their testimonies, they \u2014 as they\u2019re talking about their lives, either that there\nwas anti-Semitism that they experienced as Holocaust survivors, or as Jews growing\nup in Poland, or as Poles who had very little contact with \u2014 with the Jewish\ncommunity. That\u2019s different for you, and for your family.",
        "A: Well, it-it-it-it was different in the country, and different in the city. In the city, I\nmean, one-third of Warsaw were Jewish, and so th \u2014 and there were a lot of\nOrthodox, and I used to enjoy, as a boy, going in there and seeing the \u2014 the food, th-\nthe laughter, the language, the \u2014 to me it was very \u2014 very fascinating, although ISeptember 25, 2014\ndidn\u2019t know I had any Jewish background, it was just very interesting. But th-the\nplace where I lived was all Poles of Jewish background, who were the leaders of\nPoland, intel \u2014 university professors, army men. Ten percent of Polish officer corps\nwere Jewish. So that I didn\u2019t pay any attention t-to the \u2014 to that. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t\nrun into it, but I\u2014 I heard stories that in the country, that it was different, that the\nOr-Orthodox Jews lived separately from the Catholic peasants, and sometimes there\nwere problems, but it was never s-something that I saw in the city.",

        "A: A-And since Poland was the main exporter of grain, Kazimierz had the places\nfor storing grain, and the Vistula was the main avenue of going to the Baltic. And \u2014\nbut it was a su-summer place, and it\u2019s still a big vacation place. I was there a month\nago with my wife. And we s \u2014 we \u2014 we had \u2014 my parents rented a house there, and\nalthough my father expected war, he didn\u2019t realize how soon it would happen, and\njust as soon as he got \u2014 got us settled in Kazimierz, the car came from Warsaw\nfrom President Starzynski, taking him back, because the war started.",

And I also s-saw a\nvery funny movie of Hitler, making fun of him. So that was the beginning. And\nthen, of course, I start to \u2014 since then, I got interested in who Hitler was, because he\nlooked like s-s-such a funny guy, at the beginning.

But they came on\nmotorcycles, and th \u2014 1-in cars. And it was a very hot summer, and dry summer, so\nthey were all covered with dust. And so my first thought was, they didn\u2019t look like\nvictors, they looked like a\u2014a losing army. But they were the victors. And then they\nbrought in the orchestra, Wehrmacht orchestra, and they started playing in the\nsquare, in this medieval square, military marches. And they brought in the Orthodox\nrabbi, and tied him up to the roof of the wooden synagogue, and started a fire, and\nmade the elders run in to try to save him, and they all died right in front of my eyes.\nAnd this wa \u2014 I was 10 and a half years old. And it \u2014 it was just like Dant\u00e9\u2019s hell.\nAnd it was a little bil \u2014 that there were all together about less than a hundred\nmember \u2014 fa \u2014 Jewish families in town, but all of them perished later.",
        "Q: Oh my goodness.",
        "A: There\u2019s a monument outside to the Jewish \u2014 Jews of Kazimierz that were\nmurdered during the war.",
        "Q: It sounds \u2014 I mean, the juxtaposition of a resort town in an idyllic place \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 and medieval, and then even a German marching band, okay, that\u2019s nothing\nout of the ordinary.September 25, 2014",
        "A: No, but doing it while they were committing this horrible crime \u2014",
        "Q: Crime, yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 on \u2014 on innocent and \u2014 and helpless \u2014 and helpless people, was \u2014",
        "Q: And then a little en \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 impossible for \u2014 for \u2014 for a kid to understand, and I still don\u2019t understand it.",
        "Q: Of course, of course. Was anybody el \u2014 I mean, was your mother there on the\nsquare? Were you alone?",
        "A: No, no, only I and Zula(ph), you know the two kids, you know \u2014 I don\u2019t know,\nmy mother couldn\u2019t keep track of me. You know, she had my sister she also had to\ntake care of, and she \u2014 oh, she already started working as a cowhand. Her jo \u2014\neverybody in the little house were \u2014 we run out of money. My father didn\u2019t end \u2014\nleft money, so we \u2014 we had, each one \u2014 somebody \u2014 everybody had to do his job,\nand my mother\u2019s job was to take care of the cow. So she had to take it to the field,\nand milk it and \u2014 and \u2014",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 when you went home, did y \u2014 I\u2014 I would assume you told them all\nabout this, that \u2014 what you saw.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah. What happened after that?September 25, 2014",
        "A: Well, after Warsaw capitulated, towards the end of September. My father came\nin the limousine, city limousine to pick us up. He was \u2014 had problem walking. The\n\u2014 had problems with his legs because he did so much running around the city during\nthe siege of Warsaw. He looked tired, and sick. And they took us to Warsaw, and I\nremember entering the city, and seeing dead people on the sides, a-and dead horses\nand ruined buildings, and my mother burst crying, and got so sick that he had to\nstop the car, because she threw up when she saw everything that was happening. I\nmean, my father knew that \u2014 was used to it, after a month. But for us, coming from\nthis idyllic place, it was just a \u2014 such a shock. When we got to our house, the house\ndidn\u2019t have any windows left, you know, because of the bombs. And there was \u2014",
        "Q: Was your neighborhood bombed?",
        "A: Sections of the \u2014 of th \u2014 of \u2014 of \u2014 of \u2014 of some \u2014 some buildings were bombed,\nbut most of the bombs fell on downtown.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And hospitals, churches, synagogues, that\u2019s where they were bombing.",
        "Q: And your father took you to your home?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Was there any change inside your house?September 25, 2014",
        "A: Well, it was full of glass, you know, a-and \u2014 and dirt, and it was the same house,\nbut it wasn\u2019t. Fortunately, before the winter, we were able to get the glass back in\nthe windows, because it was a very hard winter, a very cold winter, and there was a\nshortage of fuel. It was very difficult, and the Germans started the terror\nimmediately. They arrested my father\u2019s boss, the president. They arrested my\nfather. They came to our house, and I was 10 and a half years old. I was playing on\nthe floor with my balsa ships. And I had German ships, and I had Polish ships. And\nI remember these three Gestapo men coming in and searching the house, and one of\nthem stopped by and spoke in broken Polish, and asked who was winning this war?\nAnd I said, of course, Poland is winning the war. But it\u2019s interesting that this guy,\ntoday, is 96 years old, and he is the one who admitted that the Germans killed\nPresident Starzynski a few weeks later, in Warsaw. My father \u2014 everybody\nthought at \u2014 til now that he was \u2014 died in a concentration camp. But he says that \u2014\nand th-this was examined by the Polish courts, and they pretty much decided that\u2019s\na true story. And I agree with it. But it\u2019s this guy that talked to me about the ships,\nthat came out \u2014",
        "Q: What\u2019s his name?",
        "A: I can\u2019t remember his name, but he \u2014 he \u2014 he was a Silesian. He was \u2014 he and his\nbrother, Silesians, joined the Gestapo, but he left a year later, joined theSeptember 25, 2014\nWehrmacht, survived the war, then went to the university and became a hi-history\nprofessor. And just now, two years ago, he notified the Polish government that he\nwanted to tell the story of what happened. And he also ta-talks about my father\nappearing for interview by the Gestapo headquarters. They were called in. They\nwanted to know about the foreign diplomatic corps having left Warsaw, and what\nhappened, and th \u2014 how come that \u2014 th-the president of Warsaw was making such\nanti-Hitler speeches towards the world about all the \u2014 the crimes that the Germans\nwere committed on \u2014",
        "Q: Civilians.",
        "A: \u2014 civilian population.",
        "Q: This was President Starzynski?",
        "A: President Starzynski, right, and my father, the vice-president. And \u2014 and he\nremembered \u2014 this Gestapo man remembers now that they came in dressed to a T,\nwith the hats on, and elegantly looking, just \u2014 and th-th-they were very mad that\nthey were being interviewed by low level ess \u2014 Gestapo men, rather than some high\nlevel dignitaries. They felt it was an insult.",
        "Q: It probably was.",
        "A: It was. Well, they didn\u2019t have it \u2014 but the \u2014 Starzynski was offered to form a\nPolish government, collaborative government; he refused, so he was useless. And th\nSeptember 25, 2014\n\u2014 he says that they took him to the park and he tried to escape, and he was shot.\nWell, he was executed, right in the middle of Warsaw. And then, he is buried\nsomewhere on that \u2014 on th-the outside of Warsaw, in a ess \u2014 what was then an SS\ncamp. And there\u2019s no way of finding the body. There\u2019s a memorial 1n \u2014 1-1-in the pr\n\u2014 Warsaw cemetery, but it \u2014 it\u2019s empty \u2014",
        "Q: So \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 because we never found the body.",
        "Q: So it wa \u2014 wa \u2014 can I understand it correctly, that it was assumed until just two\nyears ago, that he died in a concentration camp?",
        "A: Yes. Yes. And there were all kinds of stories, that he was in Dachau, that he was\nkilled during the Warsaw uprising, that he was ki \u2014 li-like the head of the Polish\nunderground army, the General Groetravetski, and evidently it wasn\u2019t true. He was\nkilled right then in Warsaw.",
        "Q: And tell me then, how do you make the connection that it\u2019s exactly this person\nwho stopped in your house \u2014",
        "A: Beca-Because he reme \u2014 because in his statements to the Polish government \u2014\nand it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s lengthy, it\u2019s about 25 pages, he mentions coming and \u2014 and \u2014 and\ninterview to our house, few days after the city was taken over, and my sister and I\nwere the witnesses. And my sister remembers that the guy got sick, he got the cold,September 25, 2014\nor something, was throwing up downstairs. And asked for a glass of water, my\nmother made him some tea. So details like that, that he remembers how my father\nwas dressed, he remembers my playing with the things. And I remember him\nbecause of \u2014 of th \u2014 of th \u2014 I was so surprised that a Gestapo man would ask a\nquestion like that, in Polish.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So \u2014so he \u2014 he is \u2014 he is a rare person. I think he is pretty much dying now, but\nbefore he died, I guess he wanted to get it off his shoulders.",
        "Q: It\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s amazing.",
        "A: It\u2019s an amazing story. Amazing.",
        "Q: It\u2019s amazing.",
        "A: And, of course, they haven\u2019t found the body, but this is the \u2014 my father spent his\nwhole lifetime, until he died, looking for his friend\u2019s body in Germany, and in \u2014\nand in German television, and \u2014 and nobody came up, and nobody knew anything\nabout it. There were all kinds of stories, you know, that people made up. But th-the\n\u2014 I think that \u2014 I believe that this is the story, because I remember this guy.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. And it sounds that he would be in a position to know.",
        "A: Well, he \u2014 he was the translator, right.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. Unbelievable. Well, you know \u2014September 25, 2014",
        "A: And he was told by the guys who shot Starzynski, that th-the \u2014 the less he\nknows, the better. They didn\u2019t want to give him the details, but they told him that he\nwas sh \u2014 that he was killed.",
        "Q: If you ever remember his name, let me know, and we\u2019ll add it \u2014",
        "A: Well, I\u2019ve got it in \u2014 at home.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: This begs the question: President Starzynski is executed right away because he\nis no longer useful. And your father then takes over his position in 1939, and is in it\nfor the next five horrible years.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: How did he survive? How was it that he was not executed?",
        "A: Oh, he was given an order by Starzynski to continue taking care of the city, and\nof the people. He was elected by the underground Polish government. The Polish\ngovernment was in London, but Polish underground \u2014 underground was in\nWarsaw, and th-they made my father the successor to Starzynski. But the\nGermans, who needed to have the city operating well, and they didn\u2019t have the\nmanpower, because most of them were on \u2014 in the army. And they needed the city\nto be running properly. So they \u2014 th-they made my father the mayor.September 25, 2014\nBurgermeister was his title. So he was the president of \u2014 on the \u2014 from the Polish\ngovernment\u2019s side in London, and the underground government, but as far as the\nGermans were concerned, he was the Burgermeister. So some of the pole \u2014\ncitizens, of course, who had \u2014 who were not invol \u2014 who didn\u2019t know about the\nunderground, thought that my father was a collaborator. And that the whole city hall\nwas a collaborator. Then there were tens of thousands of individuals \u2014 it\u2019s a huge\ncity, million and a half \u20141n order to operate, that was a very big bureaucracy. And\nin order to run properly; the electricity, the transportation, the b \u2014 the schools, the\nwhole system. So th \u2014 and the fortunate thing for my father, and I think this is why\nhe was able to survive, although he was arrested three, four times by the Gestapo,\nbecause they have \u2014 they suspected that he was a member of the underground, and\nthat he was anti-German. But they \u2014 there was one individual, called Ludwig Leist,\nwho was with Hitler in the first World War, in the Bavarian regiment. He was a\nregular soldier like Hitler. But they got to know each other, and in \u2014 who in 1934 or\n\u00b035, joined the Nazi party and joined the Brownshirts. And sp \u2014 went up very\nquickly, although he didn\u2019t have any \u2014 much education, if any, became a general in\nthe essda \u2014 Sturmabteilung, SA. And he was trained to be the supervisor of\nWarsaw. His first job in Warsaw was to create the Jewish ghetto, before heSeptember 25, 2014\nbecame the so-called governor of the city. And he worked with \u2014 what\u2019s his name? I\nkeep on forgetting, sorry. Th-The head of the Jewish ghetto.",
        "Q: Czernifsky(ph)?",
        "A: Czerniakow.",
        "Q: Czerniakow.",
        "A: Adam Czerniakow was a good friend of my father\u2019s before the war. Adam\nCzerniakow was the se \u2014 in the Polish senate, and he was also a member of the city\nboard, so my father knew him very well. But before my father met Leist,\nCzerniakow worked with him for about nine months. And he was \u2014 everybody \u2014\nthe Germans were already furious with Leist, because Leist treated Czerniakow\nwell. He gave him a Mercedes and a driver. And he let him travel all over Warsaw,\nand treated him like a human being. And of course, the Germans were absolutely\nlivid, because he wasn\u2019t carrying out Hitler\u2019s policy towards Poles and towards\nJews. But eight months later, he was appointed the boss of ma \u2014 of the city hall. So-\ncalled stadtprasident.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, stadtprasident.",
        "A: So if he were \u2014 he became the city president, and my father was the mayor be-\nbelow him, and the whole \u2014 a-above each of the city departments, there was a\nGerman. And some of them were \u2014 most of them were pretty horrible Nazis, butSeptember 25, 2014\nsince he had contacts with Hitler himself, he was able to overcome and save a lot of\npeople in the ghetto, and outside of the ghetto, as long as he was \u2014 before the ghetto\nbecame taken over completely by the SS, which was in 1940. From there on they \u2014\nthey closed up the ghetto, and neither Leist nor my father could do. But f-for the \u2014\nthe first year, the city hall was able to take care of everybody in \u2014 1n Warsaw,\ninside and outside of the wall.",
        "Q: So that meant that your father di \u2014 reported directly to Leist.",
        "A: My father reported directly to Leist, but my father reported directly to the prime\nminister of Poland. So he had a \u2014 this horrible jewel \u2014 job \u2014 pole \u2014 publicly, he was\nreporting to a German, but on a daily basis, he was surrounded by three military \u2014\nPolish underground military intelligence agents, and was in c \u2014 daily contact with\nthe civilian and military underground facilities. So if he was able to gather\nintelligence, and pass it on, being an \u2014 himself an intelligence officer from the\nSoviet war, he knew how to do it, and he was able to maneuver it, and fortunately,\na-as \u2014 as I said, Leist was the one who saved many lives, including my father\u2019s and\nmy own. He got me out of the \u2014 from the train in Auschwitz. He got my father out\nof the Gestapo three times.",
        "Q: Did you meet him?\nSeptember 25, 2014",
        "A: No, I never met him, I never met him. After the war, he, together with other\nNazis, were before the Polish courts, denazification courts, and the surviving\nmembers of the ghetto, and of my father\u2019s administration defended Leist, and the\nother Nazis were hanged, but Leist was declared a Nazi, but not a criminal, and he\ngot a few years sentence, which he spent in Polish jail after the war, for belonging\nto a criminal organization, the Nazi party. He wrote his memoirs, and my father\nwrote his memoirs, and Czesrniak\u00e9w wrote his memoirs. So I\u2019ve got all of these,\nand I\u2019ve translated them into English.",
        "Q: Amazing. So, it sounds that \u2014 from your telling, that he was li \u2014 not brutal, in a\nvery brutal position. Is that \u2014",
        "A: He was an end \u2014 it wa \u2014 he was referred to by the leaders of Warsaw as the\nprisoner of the city hall. Because he was a \u2014 he was a martyr, because he \u2014 he had to\nsave as many lives as possible, and provide as decent living conditions for \u2014 while \u2014\nCzerniak\u00e9w would come almost every week, to see my father. He was allowed to\nleave the ghetto and report to my father, and to Leist. And my father, at first, was\nvery suspicious of Leist, because he was a Nazi, and all Nazis were horrible,\ninhuman, and yet, this guy went \u2014 after Czerniakow left, and was described the\nconditions in the ghetto, he turned to my father, he said, poor people \u2014 about the\nJew \u2014 Polish Jews in the ghetto. And my father was taken aback. And there were aSeptember 25, 2014\nnumber of things that he did during the five years. He knew about the underground\narmy, he knew about the underground state, and he did not report it to the pole \u2014 to\nthe German authorities. And the German authorities were suspicious of him. In\n1943 \u2014 for \u2014 no, \u201944, after the attempt on Hitler\u2019s life, Fisher, who was Leist\u2019s\nsupervisor, was told to form a list of a hundred Nazis who was not loyal to Hitler.\nAnd he called Leist and told him \u2014 gave him the job to do it in Warsaw, to find\nhundred Germans \u2014 and there were tens of thousands of Germans living in Warsaw\nat the time, military and civilian, to form that list. And Leist said, well, I\u2019m sorry,\nbut I don\u2019t know anybody who is disloyal. And Fisher said, why don\u2019t you start\nwith your own name? So \u2014 and during the trial, after the war, Fisher tried to\npretend, to save his life, that he was \u2014 allowed Leist to be the good guy. Like \u2014\nwhich was not \u2014 which was a lie.",
        "Q: Amazing. Amazing.",
        "A: So that was \u2014",
        "Q: I mean, but I also think \u2014 I mean, then Leist, your father, and all those people\nwere living on a razor\u2019s edge.",
        "A: They were \u2014 well, Leist wa-was too. He was more afraid \u2014 Leist was more\nafraid of Gestapo than he was afraid of us, the underground army. And \u2014 and \u2014 and\n\u2014 and one \u2014 he used to go hunting outside of Warsaw with Fisher. And in 1943, theSeptember 25, 2014\nPolish underground courts passed a sentence on Fisher for the \u2014 death, for the\nmurder of the ghetto population, and the Polish population outside of the wall. And\nI was in the \u2014 at that time, in the unit, the commander unit, which executed the\nsentences of the Supreme Court, of the underground courts, on Nazi criminals. And\nthe sentence was passed upon Ludwig Fisher. Well, they were coming back and wi\n\u2014 we put up machine guns along the road, and as the Mercedes were passing, we\nshot Fisher\u2019s car. And unfortunately, these two guys changed cars, and Leist was\nthe \u2014 in the Fisher\u2019s car, and Leist just hit the floor, and when the car arrived in the\ncity hall, he called my father downstairs and he said, look how I\u2019ve been \u2014 for \u2014 for\nall the good things which I have done for the pole \u2014 Warsaw population, and they\nare trying to kill me. Why don\u2019t you get in touch with the underground and tell\nthem that I am a Polish friend, a friend of Poles. He said \u2014 my father said, of course,\nI will do it tomorrow \u2014 right away, if I knew how to do it. I\u2014 I have no contact with\nthe underground. But of course, he did contact the liaison officers, and they notified\nmy father next day, to tell him that the order was on Fisher, and not for him, and\nfor \u2014 never change the cars again. But it \u2014",
        "Q: Did \u2014 did you ever \u2014 I mean, it sounds to me that all of these things you\u2019re\ntelling me, you learned after the war.",
        "A: Oh, yes.September 25, 2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I been \u2014",
        "Q: Dur \u2014 yeah, at the time, when your father was in this extremely precarious\nposition, did he ever talk at home about what was going on 1n the office?",
        "A: No, no, no. No, he \u2014 he \u2014 as a matter of fact, that\u2019s one of the reasons why he\ngave me away. I didn\u2019t live with \u2014 with \u2014 with my father and my parents during the\nwar.",
        "Q: Well, I want to \u2014 excuse m \u2014 because that\u2019s exactly one of my main questions.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: As I was reading your \u2014 your \u2014 your memoirs, or your \u2014 sort of like your \u2014 your\ndiary that you wrote afterwards.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: I found it very odd that at such a young age, you would not live at home. Tell me\nwhat happened. How did things progress?",
        "A: Well, I was \u2014 right after the war, the Germans closed the schools. I had a lot of\nfree time, and from the time I was 10 to 12, I and a friend of mine went out, and we\nwould pick up the bombs which \u2014 small bombs which fell on the streets of\nWarsaw, that didn\u2019t explode. We\u2019d take them to the garage of my friend, and we\nwould take out the powder out of it. And so my father was worried that \u2014September 25, 2014",
        "Q: He knew this?",
        "A: \u2014I was going to get killed.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And my father was being arrested at home by the Gestapo. So he was worried\nthat during the searches of the home, I would get him into trouble, or he would get\nme into trouble. So he got in touch with my pre-war scoutmaster, by the name of\nLudwig Burger(ph). He was also of Jewish background. I think he was a\nProtestant, but he was Ludwig Burger(ph). And I lived with him. And I wanted to\njoin the underground army when I was 12, so Ludwig came to my father for\npermission, because I was only 12 years old, and my father said, of course, y-you c\n\u2014 you can \u2014 you can join the army, so I was sworn into the Polish army at the age of\n12.",
        "Q: Unbelievable.",
        "A: And I lived with Ludwig, which was only about three blocks away, so from to\ntime I would drop in on the house, but basically I was \u2014 there was no school, and\nLudwig trained me as a soldier, and I was \u2014 Ludwig formed the first unit of the\nPolish underground army out of the boy scouts in Zoliborz. Most of them were\nolder than I, I was the youngest one. And at first I was just the runner, I was running\naround with secret contacts, to the ghetto and t-to other places in Warsaw. But later\nSeptember 25, 2014\non I became a f \u2014 at the age of 13, a year later, I became a regular soldier, and I was\ntrained in arms, and we had maneuvers outside of the city, and were trained as a\nregul \u2014 in order to prepare us for to \u2014 to fight.",
        "Q: So, did you fa \u2014 was your father \u2014 did you tell him before you went away, that\nyou and your friend were collecting these unexploded bombs?",
        "A: Oh, he knew \u2014 he heard about it, because my f\u2014 my friend lost his leg. I wasn\u2019t\nthere, but he was supposed to wait for me, but he got some nit \u2014 nitrogly-glycerin,\nand it exploded and the whole garage went up, and he lost a whole leg. So my father\nknew that I was \u2014 they were also trying out making bombs, and \u2014 and \u2014 and trying\nthem out in the parks, and so we \u2014 he was a-afraid that I was going to get killed, and\nhe had no time for the family. He was \u2014 he worked day and night at the city hall.\nJust drop in for food once in a while. And so he didn\u2019t have \u2014 th-there was no man\nto take care of the little boy. And he felt that Ludwig Burger(ph) would be an\nexcellent person to take hold of me.",
        "Q: And did your mother have anything to say about it?",
        "A: My mother didn\u2019t know anything about it. My mother was very upset after the\nwar, when the book came out, that he didn\u2019t \u2014 she didn\u2019t know anything about it.",
        "Q: She didn\u2019t know anything about the powder, or the \u2014 or the \u2014September 25, 2014",
        "A: No. Well, I don\u2019t know if sh \u2014 I don\u2019t think she knew anything \u2014 she knew very\nmuch. She certainly didn\u2019t know that Ludwig Burger would sign me up as a\nsoldier in the underground army.",
        "Q: But she knew he took you.",
        "A: Oh yes, yeah.",
        "Q: And \u2014",
        "A: But he was a boy scout master, and also, together with Ludwig, there were two\nyoung women, Steffan(ph) Solla(ph), and Alexandra(ph) Solla(ph) \u2014 Solkul(ph),\nwho were the daughters of a doctor who take care of my mother\u2019s father when he\nwas sick \u2014",
        "Q: Oh wow.",
        "A: \u20141n Tarnow. Dr. Solkul(ph). So she knew them, and she kn \u2014 everybody knew\nLudwig Burger from before the war, because he was an actor, he was a very active\nyouth leader in the \u2014 in the boy scout movement. And wer \u2014",
        "Q: And you said \u2014 and you said he was Jewish?",
        "A: He was of Jewish background, and so were the \u2014 the two girls, ot \u2014 all \u2014 all three\nof them were of Jewish background.",
        "Q: And how is it that they wouldn\u2019t have been in the ghetto?September 25, 2014",
        "A: Well, because they were \u2014 they were hiding. They were hiding, so my father\nreally handed me over to a Jewish family, basically. Only, as I said, the religion had\nno part in it. They were extremely patriotic, integrated Polish intellectuals, and th-\nthey \u2014 they \u2014 they lived \u2014 there was a little boy, Marek(ph), who is still alive, the\nson of Ludwig\u2019s, I saw him a month ago.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: And we keep in touch. And when I was being arrested by the Gestapo, he was\nplaying over the secret place where we had our \u2014 our arms. And he was only eight\nyears old at time. I was 13.",
        "Q: But here is my question. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s not so much that they were integrated, and not\n\u2014 religion didn\u2019t play a part, it is, wouldn\u2019t they have been known by the Gestapo,\nand why \u2014 how is it that they could hide in plain sight in \u2014 in W-Warsaw.",
        "A: Well, it all \u2014 it \u2014 well, in almost every house in Zoliborz that I know of, I mean,\ncertainly every other house, had a Jewish family being hidden, including our own\nhouse. My mother hid about nine members of the Jewish family between our house,\nand we \u2014 also, later on we had a house in the country. And she took care of \u2014 saved\na number of members of \u2014 Jews who were, you know, integrated, and were not\nPolish speaking, and who could survive in \u2014 in \u2014 in hiding.",
        "Q: I see. And it\u2019s a kind of crass way to put it, but did Ludwig look Jewish?September 25, 2014",
        "A: Yes, very much so. Just look at the picture.",
        "Q: Okay. So that meant that if he was walking down the street, he could have been\npicked up.",
        "A: Well, he was six feet four inches tall, he was extremely handsome, and he was\nvery self-confident. He was a real leader, and bordering on the arrogant, you know.\nSo I don\u2019t think they \u2014 they would dared him, until they found out that they were\nlooking for him. And this is how I got caught, and \u2014 and \u2014 and Steffa(ph) were\narrested.",
        "Q: We\u2019ll come to that.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But \u2014 because I want to do this a little bit more chronologically \u2014",
        "A: They were looking for us. They were looking for Ludwig.",
        "Q: Okay. But it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s just so surprising to me, to hear of somebody who would be\nliving openly, more or less, on the Aryan side, and he could \u2014 considered himself a\nProtestant, but that doesn\u2019t matter if the Germans are in control.",
        "A: Exactly. But th-th \u2014 he was a great hero in this part of Warsaw. He was known\nby everybody and loved by everybody, and nobody cared what he was \u2014 he had the\nJewish grandfather, or \u2014 or the grandmother, or whatever it was, you know, it was\nunimportant. He was \u2014September 25, 2014",
        "Q: Did he have false papers?",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "Q: Did he have false papers? Did he have false papers? Did he have real papers that\nsaid I am \u2014",
        "A: Oh, I am sure \u2014 I am sure he had false papers. They di \u2014 all had false papers. All\nthree of them had false papers, in case of being ta \u2014 caught. But Burger(ph) could\nbe a Jewish \u2014 a German name, as well as Jewish.",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: So, you know, it \u2014 I don\u2019t know what kind of papers. Maybe he had the\nVolksdeutsche papers, for all I know.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I\u2014I me \u2014 he \u2014 the \u2014 that was height of conspiracy, and nobody was supposed to\nknow anything what the other person was doing.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But I know that when I moved there, there was a little boy, kind of a poor boy\nthat lived in the \u2014 1n that apartment, and Ludwig gave me a job to try to test him\nwhether he was not going to report Ludwig to the police, whether it was for his\nactivities in the underground, or for being of Jewish background, I couldn\u2019t \u2014 ISeptember 25, 2014\ndidn\u2019t know at the time. But the point was that I was able to convince him to do\nthat, and Ludwig had him shot, as I \u2014 they di \u2014",
        "Q: So what was the test?",
        "A: \u2014 he was \u2014 he was head of the c \u2014 the \u2014 the company of 150 soldiers, and at that\ntime the captain had the right of making a decision like that, legally, of a \u2014 a suspect\nwas enough to be killed, because he could bring so many deaths, if he was caught\nby the Germans.",
        "Q: So tell me, what was the test that you had \u2014 that you had for him?",
        "A: Well, I talked him into going to the police and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and selling Ludwig\nfor money. And it wasn\u2019t very difficult, he already had that idea, so I went and\nreported to Ludwig, and Ludwig had him shot.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: But you know, again, that was something that was \u2014 I was 12 years old at the\ntime, and I \u2014 I \u2014I-\u2014I only found out later that he was killed, and where he was\nkilled, by \u2014 by our execution squad. And I felt, of course, responsible for it.",
        "Q: So, you maybe have to repeat it a little bit, but tell me what your life was like\nwith Ludwig, in this new place. You had the two Solkul(ph) sisters, you had\nMarek(ph). He was Ludwig\u2019s son?",
        "A: And there was a mother \u2014 grandmother living. And \u2014September 25, 2014",
        "Q: Where was Marek\u2019s(ph) mother?",
        "A: Marek\u2019s(ph) mother was th \u2014 they were separated.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And she \u2014 she got him after the war, after Ludwig was killed, but at that time, he\nwas live \u2014 for whatever reason, he was living with the father, and Alexandra(ph)\nSokol(ph) was the head of the international couriers section, women\u2019s courier, and\nthey were also responsible for \u2014 also attacks on German criminals. S-Steffa(ph),\nwho was the love of Ludwig\u2019s, and she was kind of his secretary, and did all of the\nsecretarial work for him, and did the h-home caring \u2014 help \u2014 cooking, and taking\ncare of the house.",
        "Q: So, she was his girlfriend?",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "Q: She was his girlfriend?",
        "A: She was his girlfriend, right.",
        "Q: Yeah. And in this household you first joined the underground, and then at age\n13, you were accepted into the underground army\u2019?",
        "A: No, Iwas \u2014T?\u2019d \u2014T?\u2019d\u2014I-\u2014I-\u2014I was the \u2014 I had joined them at the age of 11, and\nin the same year, later that year, when I was 12, when I was sworn into the\nunderground army, 1941.\nSeptember 25, 2014",
        "Q: Which means you don\u2019t really have a childhood. Your childhood ended then.",
        "A: Yes, it did. Well, everybody had to grow up, but \u2014 but basically we were brought\nup, the Germans made it very clear, that it was question of time, that they were\ngoing to kill us all. So it wasn\u2019t a question of whether we\u2019re gonna live or die, only\nwhen. And that made a whole mental attitude different. This is why we rose up in\n1944, that\u2019s how all our brothers in \u2014 in the Warsaw ghetto rose in 1943, because\nthey preferred \u2014 we preferred to die with our arms in hands, than going to the gas\nchambers. And it was a question of age. Both inside the ghetto, and outside of the\nghetto, the adults, the priests, the rabbis, would tell the kids not to stir things up, not\nto form in a resistance, not to resist, because that would make things worse. Well,\nwe knew better. We knew that we had to defend ourselves, we had to defend our\nfamilies. And \u2014 and it fon \u2014 it proved that the young people were right, and when I\nmeet now with American kids in high schools, I often am on their side, because\nwhen you are young, you are honest, you have \u2014 you are not spoiled, you \u2014 you\u2019ve\ngot certain inborn morals, and \u2014 and you know better than the parents, who are\nmore scared.",
        "Q: Well, they don\u2019t want their children to die.",
        "A: Well, they don\u2019t want the children to die, exactly, but they \u2014 they don\u2019t realize\nthat you have to fight to save yourself.\nSeptember 25, 2014",
        "Q: Well, you know that \u2014 in one way, when I was looking through your memoir,\nyou\u2019re answering another question that I had, because I had \u2014 I see these pictures of\nchildren in uniforms, with guns, you know, and they clearly aren\u2019t even teenage\nboys yet. They\u2019re in their \u2014 they\u2019re in that age of 10 to 13. And it just \u2014 it boggles\nthe mind, that a teenage boy, who\u2019s 17 or 18, could be part of this is already\nsomething you can \u2014 they\u2019re on their way to manhood.",
        "A: Yeah, but it\u2019s happening all over the world. Since I\u2019ve, as an international\narchitect, \u2019 ve worked in 30 countries. I\u2019ve worked in Arab countries, I\u2019ve been in\nIsrael many times, and I realize that in places which are dangerous, the kids grow\nup very fast, and there are many children soldiers \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 unfortunately, still today.",
        "Q: It\u2019s true.",
        "A: So it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s true in Afghanistan, and in \u2014 in Iraq, in \u2014 in Jordan, and in \u2014\nand I \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2019m sure the I-Israeli kids are \u2014 are brought up in \u2014 in \u2014 in the same spirit\nof defending their homeland. So it \u2014 it \u2014 it\u2019s not something that you recommend, but\nwhen the Germans closed schools, and the only school was the military sc \u2014 career,\nyou grew up fast, and you grew up in a different way. And you mature faster. I\nmean, my \u2014 my \u2014 my chi\u2014I have some children who are \u2014 one of my sons is almostSeptember 25, 2014\n30. Well, he is what I was at 13. He\u2019s so far be-beyond, because of the easy life, no\nchallenges, and th-the parents and the schools don\u2019t expect \u2014 don\u2019t provide enough\nchallenges to these kids. I meet a lot with the boy scouts, the girl scouts, the high\nschool, the middle school kids, and I \u2014 I\u2014 I make friends with them immediately,\nand they \u2014 because I become that age, back, when I talk about my experiences. And\nI\u2014I-\u2014I-\u2014I\u2019m-I\u2019ve great respect for them, an-and some \u2014 and that\u2019s some\nwonderful young people. When I \u2014 when I hear about the \u2014 the \u2014 the education\nsystem being bad, there are always bad students and good students, but the good\nstudents are fantastic.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Great kids.",
        "Q: Amazing. Tell me \u2014 let\u2019s go back to how things \u2014 what were some of the other\nactivities you took part with under Ludwig\u2019s, I suppose guidance, or \u2014 or direction,\nand so on?",
        "A: Well, first of all, he trained me t-to prepare me for arrest by the Gestapo \u2014",
        "Q: And how do you do that?",
        "A: \u2014 and my torture. Sorry?",
        "Q: How do you do that? How do you get trained for that?September 25, 2014",
        "A: Well, he did two things. He taught me how to fight when you don\u2019t have a gun.\nFight with your teeth, how do kill a person with a knife, or with your hands, and\nwith your teeth. That\u2019s how he died. He also prepared me how I should answer\nunder torture, about him, because he knew perfectly well that I would be the natural\none that the Gestapo would want to find him, through me. So he said, just say to the\nGestapo that you hated me. That I was a tyrant. I wouldn\u2019t let you have sex with\ngirls. I wouldn\u2019t let you have the freedom that you wanted to do, that you really\nhated me, and that you will collaborate with them in trying to find me. And also,\ndon\u2019t admit that you know any German, so you\u2019ll have a translator. So he prepare\nme very well for it, and it was very useful when I was taken to the torture chambers.",
        "Q: Tell me \u2014 tell me some of the activities that you took part in. You said you were\npart of the commando unit that was \u2014",
        "A: Well, this was later. This was after \u2014 after Ludwig died.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Th-Th-This was part of the \u2014 his unit became the division which was supporting\nthe general headquarters of the Polish underground army, called Baszta, the tower.\nBut after I was arrested, and they were following me, trying to find Ludwig, I had\nto leave, because I was burned. And I joined the commandoes 1n order to be able to\nSeptember 25, 2014\nreturn the \u2014 be able to kill some Germans right away. I couldn\u2019t wait for the\nuprising.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But during \u2014 while I lived with Ludwig, I was \u2014 at first I was carrying secret\nmessages, and at one time he took me to the ghetto, which was an experience. I \u2014 I\nused to go to visit my girlfriend in the ghetto, but this was when the streetcar would\nstill be allowed to go. The \u2014 it wasn\u2019t allowed to stop inside the ghetto, but it went\nfrom one gate to the other, and I would jump off, see Zula(ph), and then jump back\non the \u2014 on this \u2014 on the streetcar, which was under the police guard.",
        "Q: Was this when the ghetto was still part of \u2014 under Leist\u2019s control, rather than the\nSS?",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no. No, Leist only had it a few months, it was still in the\nconstruction stages.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: He only had it about eight months, six or eight months.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It was the \u2014 the planning stages, rather than the \u2014 even construction. No, no,\nbefore they \u2014 they had \u2014 eventual they had to redirect the streetcars around the wall.September 25, 2014\nBut at first, they went right straight through the \u2014 through \u2014 through the ghetto,\nbecause it was an integral part of the downtown.",
        "Q: So, Zula(ph) and \u2014 [break]",
        "Q: Okay, this is a continuation of our interview with Mr. Julian Kulski. We were\ntalking about you visiting Zula(ph) in the ghetto. So that ax \u2014 answers another\nquestion that I had, which was, what happened to Zula(ph). She was then forced,\nwith her mother, to enter the ghetto.",
        "A: After the 1943 Warsaw uprising, I believe she was in the bunker with Annie\nLevitch(ph) and they committed suicide in the last days of the uprising. But I have\nno proof of it, it\u2019s just my conjecture, knowing her and her spirit, that she was in the\nunderground, inside the wall, the way I was in the underground outside the wall.\nBut in 1942, Ludwig took me for a two day visit into the ghetto, and he told me that\nhe was taking me so that if he got killed there, I would be able to take out the\ninformation from inside the ghetto. And I was wondering at the time, if he was\nkilled, why wouldn\u2019t I be killed, but I didn\u2019t say anything. Took the order. So we\nwent in, and we went through a secret underground passage through one of the\nbuildings, and we met some Polish Jewish underground members, who brought us\nsome dirty clothes, because we would be recognized right away in our outfits fromSeptember 25, 2014\nthe outside, so we put the rags on. And with \u2014 going to a place where Ludwig was\nmeeting the \u2014 some leaders of the Jewish underground \u2014",
        "Q: What did you see when you enter \u2014 when you emerged inside \u2014",
        "A: Well, it was suddenly hell. There were dead people on the sidewalks, children.\nAnd then I saw a German hunting, shooting innocent people on the street, a\npregnant woman being kicked. It was just unbelievable. We had to hi \u2014 when he\nwas shooting, we had to hide in a doorway of a \u2014 of an apartment building. And\nthen we got there, and Ludwig was asked to transmit through the underground\ngovernment to London, the information what was happening to Warsaw Jews.",
        "Q: What wa \u2014 okay, what kind of information \u2014",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 and what kind of requests were made\u2019?",
        "A: \u2014 well, by that time, it was already tr-trainloads being taken to the gas chambers,\nand everybody knew what \u2014 my father told Czerniak\u00e9w what was happening, and\nCzerniakow committed suicide. But it \u2014 the \u2014 the wa \u2014 the west didn\u2019t do anything\nto help, and it was \u2014 there were desperate attempts. They asked to \u2014 the west to\ninform Germans that for every Polish Jewish life, there would be a German killed.\nPrisoners of war, and other German citizens. And they realized that it was an\nunrealistic request, but it was a desperate move to \u2014 to \u2014 to help. They asked to haveSeptember 25, 2014\nthe trains bombed on the way to Majdanek, to Auschwitz. And also, they asked us\nfor arm \u2014 for information how to build bunkers, for concrete, and reinforced steel,\nso they could prepare for the uprising, and for arms. I know that my own company\nsubmitted 50 \u2014 sold, or gave 50 guns to the Jewish fighters. And then, later on, I\nwas in the Warsaw fire brigade, and the Germans respected the Polish firemen,\nbecause they needed it, during the allied bombing of Warsaw, the Polish firemen\nwere very important, and the Polish blu \u2014 blue police, some of them were\n[indecipherable], some of them were members of the underground. So they\ncouldn\u2019t \u2014 you couldn\u2019t depend on the \u2014 but the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the firemen were under\n\u2014 according to German law, the police and the fire departments went under the\npolice, under the Gestapo, under the SS. So the \u2014 the guy who destroyed the ghetto\nand murdered innocent \u2014 destroyed the whole ghetto and the people inside, was\nStroop, Jiirgen Stroop. And he was responsible for the Polish fire department.\nAnd once a year there would be a parade of all the f-fire trucks, and firemen on it in\nthe, you know, firefighting uniforms, before him. And he was very proud of the\nPolish firemen. He didn\u2019t know that 80 percent of us were members of the\nunderground army.\nSeptember 25, 2014",
        "Q: So, when you were in the ghetto, there was the request of a life for a life \u2014 when\nyou were in the ghetto, there was this request of a life for a life, because so many\nJews were being killed indiscriminately.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: There was a request for information on how to build bunkers.",
        "A: Bunkers, and for arms.",
        "Q: And for arms.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And you were able to supply them with 50 \u2014 what was it again?",
        "A: Fifty pistols.",
        "Q: Fifty pistols. And that was later.",
        "A: And submach \u2014 yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: That was later on.",
        "Q: That was later.",
        "A: And th \u2014 we\u2019re able to use the fire department trucks, because the Germans\nwould | \u2014 of course, if there was a fire in the ghetto, they would let us in through the\n\u2014 through \u2014 through, and then we could drop the information, and come out.",
        "Q: So was this the only \u2014September 25, 2014",
        "A: As a matter of fact, they \u2014 when I was in \u2014 1-in \u2014 in full fireman\u2019s uniform with\nmy helmet, and my \u2014 I was allowed to go thr \u2014 walk thro \u2014 in the city through the\nnight, after the police hour.",
        "Q: So, after curfew.",
        "A: And when we run into German patrols, Wehrmacht patrols, they would salute\nus, we would salute them. So they thought \u2014 it was a very good cover for the \u2014 for \u2014\nfor us to carry arms and \u2014 and \u2014 and attack Germans.",
        "Q: Was this the only time, after the ghetto was sealed off, that you were in the\nghetto, or did you go in to deliver those 50 pistols?",
        "A: No, no, I had nothing to do with that.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: No, th-th \u2014 as I said, the first time, I would just go to see Zula(ph).",
        "Q: Okay, and so I want to go back to this again. When I asked earlier, not what\nhappened to her at the end, but how is it that she had to go to the ghetto when she\nwas half and half \u2014",
        "A: Well, because they were considered \u2014 everybody was considered Jewish up to\nthe third generation. If you had one grandfather who was Jewish, you were JewishSeptember 25, 2014\nas far as the Germans were concerned. That\u2019s how I was saying, that if the Germans\nknew that my father\u2019s grandmother was Jewish, he would have been considered Jew\nby the Nazis.",
        "Q: I see. And so, for Zula(ph), and her mother, of course, who was Jewish, it\u2019s a \u2014\nit\u2019s a given.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: But for \u2014 and this is where the juxtaposition for me sounded so confusing; that\nshe is forced, but Ludwig isn\u2019t.",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "Q: Do you see what I\u2019m saying? She cannot have a choice of living outside \u2014 this is\nsomeone who doesn\u2019t know the war, who doesn\u2019t know the situation. And why I\nwas ask \u2014",
        "A: Well, th-th \u2014 there were over, I would say, between hundred, and 140,000 Jews\nin Warsaw during \u2014 that survived. Either being hidden, or \u2014",
        "Q: Outside the ghetto.",
        "A: \u2014 outside the ghet \u2014 outside the ghetto, right.",
        "Q: Outside the ghetto, okay.",
        "A: I mean, th-th \u2014 the reason all three of them \u2014 Ludwig was killed on the street, in\na fight with an SS man, Steffa(ph) ended up in Auschwitz after we were arrested.September 25, 2014\nAnd Ola(ph) committed suicide after she was arrested in the church with false\npapers and arms, and \u2014 and \u2014 and was tortured, and committed suicide, with a\nsuicide pill \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 cause we all had them, in case we couldn\u2019t stand the pain any more, we could\ncommit suicide. I had it in my ring.",
        "Q: You wore a ring?",
        "A: Yeah, I had a silver ring that \u2014 empty inside, and I had a cyanide capsule in it.\nWhen I was arrested, when I was 13.",
        "Q: Okay. I think we\u2019ll break now, and we\u2019ll talk about all of these incidents aft \u2014\n[break]",
        "Q: This is a continuation with our interview at the Holocaust Museum with Mr.\nJulian Kulski. And before the break, we were talking about the guns, and the \u2014 the\narmaments that were brought in by the fire brigade, to the ghetto. But you were not\ninvolved in that. And from what I understand, it was the one and only time you\nwere in the ghetto after the wall was secure \u2014 that is, people could not go in. Did\nyou ever go there again?",
        "A: Not after the visit in \u00b042 with Ludwig Burger(ph).",
        "Q: Okay.September 25, 2014",
        "A: That was the last time.",
        "Q: That was the last time.",
        "A: Last time.",
        "Q: What did wa \u2014 how did things proceed for you, after you left? What kind of\nactivities were you involved in?",
        "A: Well, I was invol \u2014 continued training, military training, maneuvers outside of\nthe city, learning about new arms, explosives. But soon after, in 1943, in the middle\nof the summer, there was a wedding of two Polish underground officers, in one of\nthe downtown churches. And there were about a hundred underground officers\nattending it, which is against all the rules of conspiracy, which they broke. And\nsomehow the Germans learned about it, and at the height of the marriage ceremony,\nthe SS entered the church, and arrested 89 people, and among them was Ola(ph)\nSolkul(ph), with whom I lived, with Steffa(ph), and Ludwig. And she had false\npapers, German papers under Evee(ph) Keller(ph), and guns. So, as soon as we\nfound out that she was arrested, Ludwig left the apartment and he told \u2014 send me\nhome to my parents, so only Steffa(ph) and Marek(ph), and the grandmother were\nleft. But about 10 days, two weeks later, we found out through our underground\nsources that Ola(ph) was tortured so badly that she committed suicide, and was \u2014\ndied, rather than tell the stories. So I felt I was safe, and in the morning I went backSeptember 25, 2014\nto the apartment. Ludwig stayed away, fortunately. Well, in the afternoon, I was in\nthe living room, and I heard banging on the front door, and Steffa(ph) said, who is\nit? And I heard, Gestapo, open the door, or I will shoot through. And I was on the\nfirst floor, and there was a balcony, and I was going to jump into the park, a public\npark, and escape. So I opened the doors, the French doors, and I look behind me,\nand the Gestapo man already had a machine gun pointed at me, and said\n[indecipherable]. So I had to surrender. He \u2014 I was arrested on the spot. They \u2014 th-\nthey check on the apartment. The little boy was playing over the secret safe where\nthe arms were kept. And so they took me and Steffa(ph), and took me downstairs,\nand there were open, big Mercedes cars, three of them, and they put \u2014 put us in, and\ntook us to the Pawiak prison.",
        "Q: What\u2019s the Pawiak prison?",
        "A: Pawiak prison was an old so \u2014 Russian prison in the center of Warsaw, a huge \u2014\nbuilt to take care of Polish par \u2014 freedom fighters of the 19\" century. The \u2014 the \u2014\nthis was a huge, huge \u2014 so huge prison. And th \u2014 there were double gate, and the\ncars went through the first gate, they closed the gate behind, and suddenly there\nwere all kinds of horrible German Shepherds that were trying to attack us, growling,\nand they were all fed on \u2014 on human flesh, on the prisoners\u2019 flesh, that they were\njust \u2014 1\u2014I-\u2014I-\u2014JI will never forget the sight of these dogs \u2014 and I love dogs, butSeptember 25, 2014\nthese were just wild animals, horrible. And then finally they opened the other gate,\ntook us in, and there they put us on one side of the room; the man, on the other side\nthe women, and I was standing, my face to the wall. And I tried to make contact\nwith Steffa(ph) across the room, I turned my head, and one of the Germans hit me\non the wall, and my nose started bleeding. So that was di \u2014 di \u2014 the first time I knew\nthat I was \u2014 lost my freedom. Then they took me, and took everything away from\nme, and shaved my head. And being a 13 year old, all I was worried about is, how\nam I going to go on dates? You know, instead of worrying about my life, I was\nworried about my hair. It just shows the mentality of a 13 year old. Then I was\nthrown into a cell, which was supposed to be for one person, and there were six of\nus altogether. It was jammed, and at night we had to sleep like sardines across the\nroom. In order to turn over, we had to all do it at the same time, because we just\nstuck, wall to wall. And then, in the middle of the night, you heard the executions\nsquads in th \u2014 in the outside, and the cries of the people being shot, and tortured.\nTh-There were all kind \u2014 poor food, hardly any food. We\u2019re allowed to the\nbathroom once a day only, for five minutes. So there was a bucket of uh \u2014 in the\ncorner, smelly. It was horrible. So, at \u2014 at \u2014",
        "Q: Were you the youngest there, do you think\u2019?September 25, 2014",
        "A: I was the \u2014 definitely the youngest one. And for all the strange things, I was\nselected by the adults to be the one to be representative, because every morning the\ndoor opened, and I had to report, in German, that six prisoners, all here, everything\nin order. I was very short, and then I had the door slammed in my face. But, was the\nsame in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in a prisoner of war camp later. I don\u2019t know why, being the\nyoungest, they had the greatest faith in me, that I would be honest, about food,\ncutting bread, because \u2014",
        "Q: The prisoners themselves had selected you \u2014",
        "A: The prisoners selected me, right, right.",
        "Q: Did you speak German\u2019?",
        "A: Very little, very little. Oh, I had this German nanny, but I didn\u2019t want to learn\nGerman, I hated her. But that was u \u2014 turned useful. I understood more then, than I\ncould speak. And I knew a few words. I knew enough to say that. And then, one\nday, I was taken for \u2014 to the Gestapo headquarters for examinations, for torture, and\nwe were in a prison van, and I was with Steffa(ph), and we were able to \u2014 finally to\nagree on the same story, so that each one of us would tell the same story about\nLudwig, and everything else. And that was the last time I saw her. From the \u2014 there,\nshe was sent to Auschwitz, where she survived the war, but she didn\u2019t know that\nLudwig was killed on the streets a few weeks later. So when she would \u2014 got to\nSeptember 25, 2014\nPoland, it was a shock, because the first thing she was looking forward to, was to\nsee Ludwig, whom she la \u2014 was crazy about. And when she found out he was dead,\nshe died soon after, a few years later.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: But I was taken, and put into a cage, which we \u2014 we called the streetcars,\nbecause it was a narrow room with about 16 so-called chairs, very uncomfortable,\nwooden bench. And we had to sit back to the main corridor, where the Gestapo men\nwalked back and forth. And this was the beginning of the torture, because at the end\nof the corridor were the torture chambers, and we could hear the cries of the\nprisoners being tortured. And then, they would put these people into the same room\nwith us. Women without breasts, with the eyes cut out, with the fingers pulled out.\nYou know, kind of inhuman. So you sat there for about 48 hours, without food,\nwithout all these thing, and then the German would playing \u2014 they had the radio,\nand they were playing the German tunes, and they were cooking steaks. So that the\n\u2014 this was all \u2014 you had all the senses, which were \u2014 were starved, after two weeks\nin the prison, and then two days with no food. And the music, the cries of the being\ntortured, the \u2014 a-a-and the \u2014 and the smell of the food, and the music were \u2014 that\ncompletely wrecked you, so by the time you \u2014 I was taken upstairs into one of the\nexamination rooms. They asked me if I speak German, I said no, I didn\u2019t know aSeptember 25, 2014\nword, so they had to have a translator. That was one thing that Ludwig prepared\nme, so that gave me a time to come out with a answer, a lie, while the translator was\ntranslating it. My father did the same thing, when he was arrested. And they \u2014 first,\nthey wanted to know my relationship with Ludwig, so I\u2014 1\u2014I-\u2014I mentioned all the\nthings, and I told them that I want to help them find him, because I hated him. And\nso they said, well, will you join us? I said, of course, anything to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to\nfind him. And then they gave me a book full of pictures of freedom fighters, a ba \u2014\nvery thick book, and made me look at each picture, and \u2014 to see if I recognized\nanybody. And I recognized one, and I said \u2014 and he said, who is it, where do you\nget it? I said, well, he\u2019s in my cell in Pawiak prison. When they knew I was making\nfun of them, I got really hit behind the head with the whip.",
        "Q: Was he in your cell?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: And, excuse me, for those of us who don\u2019t know, why would that be making\nfun? If you were a \u2014 a\u2014 you know, recognize this person \u2014",
        "A: Well, because they \u2014 they \u2014 they th \u2014 they felt that I wasn\u2019t leading them to \u2014 to\n\u2014 to the underground, you know, that \u2014",
        "Q: It\u2019s true.",
        "A: \u2014 and I didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t. I just \u2014September 25, 2014",
        "Q: It\u2019s true.",
        "A: \u2014 picked out somebody that I knew, but I did \u2014 there was a picture of Ola(ph),\nthere was a picture of Ludwig, and there were a picture of other members of \u2014 that I\nknew, that I didn\u2019t say anything. The \u2014 they \u2014 then they started beating me. Then\nafter beating, they again started talking me into it, that they fight \u2014 just lead them to\nLudwig, I will \u2014 I'll \u2014 Pll \u2014I can join the Gestapo, and I will be well off, and I\u2019m\nso young, it\u2019s a pity, and so it was bad guy and good guy routine. Then they made\nme look through the secret files, to see if I find something, that I would stop and be\ninterested. Which is amazing, because I was being ab \u2014 able to see all of the Polish\nand Jewish underground fighting organization they had the file \u2014 files on. But then\ntowards the evening after the \u2014 all this beating and \u2014 and \u2014 and starvation and\ntorture, they asked me where Ludwig worked. I said, well, he worked as a \u2014 taking\ncare of some gardens. So he \u2014 they put \u2014 took me to a map of the city, and they saw\na building in the middle of the gardens, and they says, what 1s it? I said, well, it\u2019s\njust a garden shed. But actually, we \u2014 Ludwig had a German car there, and some\narms. So they piled me up into the car, it was an evening. There were again two\nMercedes, open cars, with machine guns on the sides. And I remember we went\nthrough the center of Warsaw, it was a beautiful, sunny day. And I was bald, I was\nstarving, and I could see the human be \u2014 you know, the normal life. I almost felt\nSeptember 25, 2014\nlike cr-crying. And there were two ways to the garden, one was from the bottom,\nfrom the Vistula, and the one from the top. And I knew that if we came from the\ntop there was a gate, then whoever was there could escape. So we came up from the\ntop, and sure enough, the German car said p-o-l, polizei on the \u2014 on the \u2014 they\nrecognized right away as a Gestapo car. And by the time we got down\n[indecipherable] escaped. Ludwig wasn\u2019t there, but fortunately, he took everything\nout of that building before that.",
        "Q: Beforehand.",
        "A: So then they took me back, and they had one more day of tortures, and then they\nsend me back to \u2014 back to Pawiak prison. And then, about two and a half weeks,\nthree weeks later, they were calling out names, those to be executed, those to be\nsent to Auschwitz, and I was on the list to the Auschwitz, so \u2014",
        "Q: Did people know at that point what Auschwitz was?",
        "A: Oh, perfectly well.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Everybody knew what Auschwitz was, it was a frightening name\n[indecipherable]. My Uncle Norbert was murdered there in the first year, in 1940.",
        "Q: Well, how did he get arrested? What happened with him?September 25, 2014",
        "A: Well, they arrested all the Polish leaders of \u2014 the university professors, and \u2014 and\nleaders of parties, and he was the leader of the Polish Socialist party. So he was a\npublic figure, and \u2014",
        "Q: What was his last name\u2019?",
        "A: \u2014 and he was arrested th-the same time as my father. And \u2014",
        "Q: I see. What was he \u2014 Norbert\u2019s last name?",
        "A: Sorry \u2014 Barlicki.",
        "Q: Barlicki, okay.",
        "A: Barlicki, Norbert Barlicki. And my father was also arrested, and my father was\narrested for a different reason. During the siege of Warsaw in 1939, there was an\nAmerican photo reporter by the name of Julien Bryan, who came voluntarily three\ndays after the siege, and was taking pictures, movies. Most of these movies are right\nnow in this museum. They were bought by Holocaust Museum, and restored. And\nmy father took him around Warsaw, taking pictures. Well, a year later, somehow\nthe \u201cLife\u201d magazine, which Julien Bryan\u2019s pictures occurred, got to the city hall,\nand his secretary gave them a copy of this \u201cLife\u201d magazine. He \u2014",
        "Q: Your father.",
        "A: My father brought it home and hid in the \u2014 in the laundry closet, which during\nthe next Gestapo search, they found the \u2014 the \u201cLife\u201d magazine, and they wereSeptember 25, 2014\nconvinced that my father was a American spy. So this time it was extremely serious,\nnot only that \u2014 that he might be a member of the Polish underground government,\nwhich he was, but that he was an American spy. So he was taken to Pawiak, and\nthrown together with Uncle Norbert. So they spent about two days in prison\ntogether, saying goodbye, and that was the last time my father saw Norbert.\nNorbert went to Auschwitz. He helped organize an underground there, and then he\nwas killed there. But my father was released after \u2014 oh, my father was taken to a\ntorture chamber too, and told to take all his clothes. He knew that he was going to\nbe beaten to death. And he was just in the process of taking off his pants, as a senior\nGestapo man passed through, and recognized my father. It was the same man that\narrested my father in 1939. So he knew that my father was the mayor of Warsaw,\nand he said to the guys there, don\u2019t beat him yet, wait. And my father knew that if \u2014\nonce they beat you up [indecipherable] they will never let you go \u2014 be alive,\nbecause you were a-at \u2014 they couldn\u2019t let you out on \u2014 on the streets in condition\nlike that. They didn't want people to know what they were doing. So that saved his\nlife, this time.",
        "Q: So the \u2014 the \u2014 the Gestapo who said delay, what made the delay into, don\u2019t beat\nhim at all?",
        "A: Well, I guess he recog \u2014 realized that he was the mayor of Warsaw.September 25, 2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And they let him go.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: Because he was \u2014 he was too important for the Germans. The Germans didn\u2019t\nhave a way of running the city, and so my father had this unfortunate situation, that\nhe did \u2014 he [indecipherable] his best in a terrible situation, being a \u2014 a \u2014\nendangered by the Gestapo, and by the SS, and also by the communist underground,\nwho \u2014 who \u2014 which didn\u2019t know \u2014 they threw a bomb at his car while he was going\nto the city hall one day. And the under \u2014 Polish underground had to notify the\ncommunist underground that my father was a member of the underground\ngovernment, so to desist. But after that my father stopped using the car, and started\ndriving in a dr\u00e9zka, in a ca \u2014 1n a horse drawn vehicle to show that he had nothing\nto be afraid of.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So let\u2019s go back to your imprisonment. So there you are, and you\u2019re on\nthe list to go to Auschwitz. What happens?",
        "A: Well, the \u2014 evidently somebody in the city hall went over to Leist, and told them\nthat the mayor\u2019s son was being sent to Auschwitz. And my father refused to go and\nask for \u2014 for \u2014 for my life, because he felt that if he started asking for favors from\nthe Germans, he would really be a collaborator, and he would have to pay \u2014 pay the\nSeptember 25, 2014\nprice for it. But somebody, one of his directors, went to Leist, and Leist must have\ngotten in touch with Berlin, and Berlin ordered th-the Gestapo in Warsaw to let\nme go.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: But when the \u2014 when I was being released, I was sent up to the chief Gestapo\nman, who was Colonel Hann(ph), who was sitting be-behind a big desk, in a big\nroom, up on the same building where the torture chambers were. And he was under\nhuge painting of Hitler. Enormous painting, f-full \u2014 full wall size. And there was\nmy father and Leist and my father\u2019s translator, sitting back. I couldn\u2019t say hello to\nthem. They didn\u2019t turn around. But I got a lecture from the Major Hahn(ph), he\nsaid, I \u2014 I know you are a member of the underground. You were caught with \u2014 red-\nhanded, but General Leist says that you are only 14 years old, so we let you go. But\nnext time we catch you, the devil himself is not going to save you.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: So then I was released, but they followed me everywhere I went in Warsaw,\nbecause they thought that I would lead them to Ludwig. So \u2014",
        "Q: Wa \u2014 did you go home to your parents? Ha \u2014 wi \u2014",
        "A: I went to \u2014 to \u2014 to my parents, right, to my parents\u2019 house, but they thought that I\nwould lead them to \u2014 to Ludwig. So they send me to the country place outside ofSeptember 25, 2014\nWarsaw, where I spend about a month, and Ludwig came and visited us, and that\nwas the last time I saw him.",
        "Q: And what was this country place called?",
        "A: Banyoha(ph).",
        "Q: Banyoha(ph).",
        "A: Which is about an hour and a half by narrow gauge railroad [phone ringing]",
        "Q: Let\u2019s just break for a second. [break] So wi \u2014 you were sent to Banyoha(ph).\nNow, did your mother know of aw \u2014 any of these things that were happening to\nyou?",
        "A: Well, she knew that I was in prison, of course.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And I di\u2014 she saw me afterwards. There is a picture in the book of my mother\u2019s\nsister, younger sister Zosia(ph) who hid the Katz family, and Ludwig, supposedly\nwith a new haircut, but he was six feet four, so the change in outlook didn\u2019t \u2014 it was\njust question of time when he would be. And everybody begged him to leave the\ncity and go and fight in the woods with the partisans, but he was so involved with\nthe underground in Warsaw that he didn\u2019t go. And sure enough, he was caught in\none of the regular streetcar searches. They stopped the streetcar, and he and his\nsecond in command started running off, and the SS men were running behind himSeptember 25, 2014\nand shooting machine guns. And finally he got to a house with a garden, and he was\njumping over a fence, and one of the SS men got to him. He ran out of bullets, so\nthey started fighting hand to hand. And Ludwig tried to kill him by \u2014 the German,\nby biting his throat through, but another German came through and shot him point\nblank into the \u2014 so when I found out that he was killed there, I ran over there, and\nhis body was already removed, but his brain was still lying on \u2014 on \u2014 on \u2014 on\u2014 on \u2014\no-on \u2014 on the ground. And I just swore that I would revenge him, and every time I\nkilled a German during the uprising, I would say, it\u2019s for you. I loved that man.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you, what did he mean to you?",
        "A: Oh, he was everything. He was my best friend, he was my teacher, he was my\nscoutmaster, he was my captain. He was the one who got me into the army, and\nwho \u2014 whose ideals \u2014 he was a great orator, and he knew Polish literature by heart.\nAnd he would \u2014 on every national holiday, he would line us up, all 150 in the\ncompany in a line, and would orate the poems of Mickiewicz and Stowacki and\nPolish \u2014 just to keep up the \u2014 our spirit, our national identity, and our love of\nfreedom. So he was feeding us the things which we as kids, needed most. Love of\nPoland.",
        "Q: I can\u2019t imagine what that must have felt like, to see somebody you loved, and\nonly part of him there.September 25, 2014",
        "A: He is buried in the military sera \u2014 cemetery now, and every time I got to\nWarsaw, I go and lay some flowers on his grave.",
        "Q: So his body was discovered, and was buried.",
        "A: Yes, he was di \u2014 his body was taken to a pol \u2014 police \u2014 police barracks, and then\nthe \u2014 I guess they were buried somewhere, in a \u2014 the place, and after the war he was\nfound, and buried with military honors. He is a \u2014 he 1s \u2014 after I found out he was\nkilled, I and another boy spent the night tearing up the street signs on the street that\nwe lived \u2014 that he lived, was Karchanjeski(ph) street. Then we repainted it with his\npseudo names, and hanged them up, so we renamed the street in his honor.",
        "Q: What were some of his pseudonyms?",
        "A: He had three; Mihau(ph) \u2014 Michael, Hardy(ph), and Goliut(ph).",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: He had to change three times, in order to maintain his secrecy. The last one was\nGoliat(ph). And Goliat(ph) is the one that I took over after I was arrested. Before\nthat, it was Chernatski(ph), but I \u2014 I change it to Goliat(ph) in his honor.",
        "Q: After you were released, did you have a chance to talk to your own father about\nwhat had gone on in prison, or about anything?",
        "A: A little, a little. I think he knew. He went through it himself, so he knew\nperfectly well what I went through. It didn\u2019t take much. I talked a lot to LudwigSeptember 25, 2014\nwhen he came over and spent the night, in the country. He \u2014 all he wanted to know,\nwhat happened to Steffa(ph), and how she was. And he congratulated me for not\nspilling the beans under the torture. He pro \u2014 proposed me for a medal, and he was\njust proud of me.",
        "Q: What kind of activities did you get involved with after these things?",
        "A: Well, after this, I was just so full of hate, and a desire for revenge on these\nbeasts, on the Germans, that killed my friends in the ghetto, and outside, that I went\nin search of wet \u2014 disarming German soldiers. And I and another guys were able to\nget some old guns. I had a old American western Colt, about this size. And we\nspent the whole night looking for Germans, individual Germans that we could catch\nand disarm, without killing them, because for every German, there were 20 to a\nhundred Poles, innocent civilians, shot on the same place. This mass\n[indecipherable]. And we find \u2014 in the morning, we found downtown, a\u2014a-\u2014a\nsergeant, a big sergeant, with a beautiful gun on his side, getting onto the front of\nthe streetcar, which was only Nur fiir Deutschen, only for Germans, and we\nfollowed him. But besides this sergeant, there were five other soldiers, regular\nsoldiers with rifles. And they all got off at the railroad station, the Danzig-Warsaw\nrailroad station, near Zoliborz. And we thought we would run down the steps, and\nhid under the viaduct, and disarm him before the other soldiers came down. Well,September 25, 2014\nwe faced him with both our guns, and said [indecipherable] or you are dead. And\nhe, instead of raising his hands, being a seasoned soldier, started opening up his\ngun, and pulling out. So it was a question us or them, and we both fired, and he fell\non his face. And he was the first German that I killed. And my initial reaction was,\nthey were supposed to be supermen, and yet they were human. You were able to kill\nthem. You know, as a 13 year old boy, I was \u2014 I \u2014 I was surprise. And then, of\ncourse, we saw the four guys coming towards us, about 20 feet ahead of us, and\nthey saw what was happening, so we started running. And they took the rifles off\nand started shooting at us, and we run up the embankment, and near the ghetto\nwalls, and by the ghetto walls we got to downtown. And then, on the way back,\nwe're told not to go through \u2014 near the station, because the German were arresting\npeople left and right. And next day they killed 20 women and children on that spot.\nThere is a sign, and every time I go there, I feel responsible for the death of these\npoor people.",
        "Q: Th \u2014 so was that \u2014 that is something that\u2019s been a burden for you.",
        "A: Yeah, for your whole life. It\u2019s \u2014 1t \u2014 and I mean, it wasn\u2019t my fault, it was a\nmatter of life and death, it was war, but the results were something that ver-very\ndeeply \u2014 first 1t was that boy, and now the 20 women and children. And it was after\nthat that my father send me to the countryside again, to try to hide me.September 25, 2014",
        "Q: Yeah. And then after that, how did life progress? What happened?",
        "A: Well, then I \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014I was \u2014 the commandoes heard about my actions, and I was\nable to join them. And the commandoes had the advantage, that they were\nresponsible carrying out the \u2014 the death sentence on Poles who sold Jews to the\nGermans, who were traitorous, who were collaborators. A-And so, we had an\nopportunity to kill some Germans legally after that. It was, again, pretty horrible,\nbecause we had to go into their homes, sometimes kill the family, as well as the\nindividual, because they we \u2014 they were well armed, and they would defend\nthemselves during the execution.",
        "Q: That\u2019s huge.",
        "A: Then, we were all praying that there will be an uprising, and the commanders\nwere ordered in full, under arms, for 10 days before. And we\u2019re all, my whole unit,\nabout 14 of us were housed in my father\u2019s house. So my father, of course, knew\nevery day about it, that we\u2019re hidden there, fully armed. And they used to bring the\nfood, big cauldrons of soup once a day, for all of us. And we couldn\u2019t wait to have\nthe uprising. And then on the first of August, we got orders to go and retrieve arms\nfor the whole company, from our secret place. And we\u2019re carrying it across one of\nthe major streets, and the German car, because they were expecting something, saw\nus and started firing at us. So the Warsaw uprising was started by the six of us, bySeptember 25, 2014\naccident. It was supposed to start at five o\u2019clock in the afternoon, and this was two\no\u2019clock. So the Germans were able to bring tanks, and \u2014",
        "Q: This was in the center city?",
        "A: This was in the city, in Zoliborz, in Warsaw.",
        "Q: So, in your neighborhood?",
        "A: In our na \u2014 in my neighborhood.",
        "Q: In your \u2014 in your \u2014 in your suburb area.",
        "A: In my suburb.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So this was ma \u2014 my whole \u2014 I spent the whole occupation and \u2014 and the whole\nbattle in \u2014 in Zoliborz, fighting \u2014",
        "Q: So we\u2019re talking \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 on ground that I knew.",
        "Q: Yeah. So, in other words, we\u2019re talking August 1*, 1944.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: That\u2019s when the uprising starts. And you\u2019re saying that you f \u2014 the entire time of\nthe uprising, you stayed in your neighborhood?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What kind of activities did you take part in?September 25, 2014",
        "A: Well, the first time, I fa \u2014 I fought \u2014 I was fighting, I got the g \u2014 my rifle, which\nwas 1939 Polish rifle, and I was able to shoot across the street at the Germans,\nwhile they were shooting at us. Then, after they left, there was one wounded, and\none killed, we had to go around, and get across another boulevard. And th \u2014 th-th-\nthere was a tank standing and machine-gunning us as we were jumping over. And\nthis was the first day of the uprising, that I got wounded. I got f \u2014 hit in my arm. It\nwas something that not incapacitated me, because on the other side, there were\nnurses. They took care of it, and I was able to continue fighting. Then that night, the\ncommandant of the \u2014 our section of \u2014 the Zoliborz section, decided that the\nGermans knew already about it, and they were winning, so we \u2014 he took us out into\nthe Kampinos forest, which was about 15 \u2014 20 miles outside of the city. We march\nall night. And then, while \u2014 the next day we got an order from the commandant of\nthe Warsaw, of the whole city, to return, and we had to return. On the return, we\nwere \u2014 we had to fight a very big battle with some German Luftwaffe near the\nairport, military airport, to get back to our own homes. And we lost quite a few. My\ncomma \u2014 commander was badly wounded, we had to leave him behind. And then\nwe got home, and the civilian population was very excited, and just like during the\nghetto uprising, the \u2014 the Jewish \u2014 Polish fighters raised the \u2014 the Jewish and Polish\nflags. The Polish flags were flying from every home, and we were welcomed, and \u2014September 25, 2014\nby the civilians, and they helped us build barricades. So we build the barricades,\nand we mounted the front lines, and the Germans \u2014 when the Germans started\nattacking, we would let them go behind our positions. They were stopped at the\nbarricades, and then they would get into fire from our buildings, and from behind\nthe barricade. So th-they lost quite \u2014 in the first few days, they lost a lot of soldiers.",
        "Q: The Germans did.",
        "A: The German.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Also I\u2014I took a prisoner, one of the Germans. And he was \u2014 th-the \u2014 the\nGermans were bullies, and when they were in power, they were heartless, but when\nthey were captured, they were cowards. And this old guy that I captured, ges \u2014\nstarted kissing my feet, begging me not to shoot him. And I said, well, we do not\nshoot prisoners. But they knew that they shot us, because they didn\u2019t consider us\narmy, they considered us bandits. So wa \u2014 there was no way of surrendering. We\nknew that we had to fight, or kill, ourselves. Because the way they killed us would\nbe the much more cruel way.",
        "Q: Yeah. What happened to this German prisoner?",
        "A: Well, I took him over to the back, and he, together with other German prisoners,\ndid some helping in the military kitchen, and d-digging up passages underground.September 25, 2014",
        "Q: Trenches.",
        "A: Trenches, and th-they were employed, and he always smiled at me when he saw\nme. He was an Austrian, and he was trying to tell me he was not a Nazi, he was \u2014\nhad a big family, please don\u2019t kill him. I had no respect for him.",

        "A: Well, we \u2014 we wou \u2014 we would kill the Gestapo men, we would kill the SS men,\nbut we did not shoot Wehrmacht, the regular army. They wo \u2014 we took them\nprisoners.",
        "Q: I see. So, the uprising lasted several weeks.",
        "A: Sixty-three days.",
        "Q: Sixty-three days. Two months.",
        "A: Sixty-three. And th-the \u2014 the Germans were \u2014 Hitler issued an order that he\nwanted to have every man, woman and child in Warsaw killed in the return. And\nhe wanted Warsaw leveled to the ground, the way he leveled the ghetto, after the\nuprising. So the Germans came in and took the order, and in the first day, they\nkilled almost 100,000 innocent women, children, babies. It was a massacre. It was\nso bad that the German command had to stop it because they knew they would not\nwin the war, th-the battle, if they continued this spending the ammunition, and theSeptember 25, 2014\neffort of killing innocent people rather than fighting us. So that after that they\ncontinued in shooting people. And in \u2014 in the 63 days, every day they murdered the\nnumber of people that died in 9-11, in that building. That\u2019s 3,000 people a day, for\n63 days. It was medieval in \u2014 in extent. And then after, we had to surrender the \u2014\nthey continued leveling the city to the ground, the way that \u2014 so by the time the\nRussians came in the following year, they were \u2014 Warsaw was just a pile of bricks.",
        "Q: Tell me, you said you were in Zoliborz the whole time?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Did you ever venture into the city and come back, or is it what you \u2014 what you\nknew of it is what you were hearing from other people, who had been there? Did\nyou know \u2014",
        "A: Oh, during \u2014 during the uprising, it was just what I heard from people who were\nescaped from the other parts, or who came through the sewers. The sewers were \u2014\nwere the connections. And a month later, after the \u2014 in the middle of the uprising,\nmy father was \u2014 came across the sewers to Zoliborz from the center city, and he\nalmost drowned. He slipped. And the Germans set up barriers, wire barriers, and his\nbody ran into that barrier, and his leg was completely cut up by the \u2014",
        "Q: So at that point, in \u201944, is that when the uprising happened is \u2014 he stops being the\nmayor of Warsaw.September 25, 2014",
        "A: He ri \u2014 he resigned three days after the for \u2014 on the fourth day of the uprising he\nresigned, because he felt that he could no longer administer the city, which was\ndivided into various sections by the Germans. There were five sections of freedom\nfighters, and they \u2014 separated by German army, and so he felt there was no need,\nand he asked th \u2014 to be relieved, he and his two vice-presidents.",
        "Q: Now, what did have they been arrested?",
        "A: By whom\u2019?",

        "A: It was opposite the opera house.September 25, 2014",
        "Q: Okay. And so he was going through the sewers to get out from that center area.",
        "A: At the end of the m \u2014 the month, when the left whole section of the ancient city\nwas destroyed, the army went to the center city through the sewers, and he was \u2014 he\nwas able to go through the sewers to Zoliborz, to find out if I was alive.",
        "Q: And your own family home, was it still standing?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",

And one\nof the big bags of ammunition came into the \u2014 my bedroom. Fortunately, didn\u2019t\nexplode, but ruined the bedroom.",
        "Q: So, through the ceiling?",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "Q: It came through the ceiling?",
        "A: It came through the side wall, through the wa \u2014 kind of near the window. Th-Th-\nThey were flying these first World War planes, double planes, very, very low. They\nwould turn the engine off, and they would fly very low, and \u2014 and thr \u2014 but, without\nthe parachute. Either it was too low, or they wanted to have everything destroyed on\nthe ground, but pretend that they were helping.September 25, 2014",
        "Q: So you knew that the Russians were close by?",
        "A: Oh, th \u2014 we could see them across the river.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah. Because th \u2014 Zoliborz is on the river. And on the other side of the river\nwas the Red Army. And the Polish communist par \u2014 army. And they tried to \u2014 to\ncome a few times, but they were not trained for city fighting, and the Germans had\nsu-such advanced equipment that they \u2014 most of the soldiers who came by boats\nacross the river were drowned. Killed. But in the \u2014 in our uprising, in \u2014 in 1944,\nthere were more Jewish-Polish freedom fighters than there were in the Jewish\nghetto, which 1s very little known.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: In my own company, there was a whole section of about 24 freedom fighters\nfrom the ghetto. And they \u2014 they didn\u2019t go into the prison camps, but they hid,\nbecause they were afraid that they would not be treated \u2014 when the last day of the\nuprising, the Germans decided that they would treat us as combatants, and give us\nGeneva rights. We didn\u2019t believe it, so it was a terrible experience to have to\nsurrender. We were ready to die, but we were not ready to go and lose our freedom.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And \u2014September 25, 2014",
        "Q: How did the tide turn against you? Because it sounds like in the beginning you\nwere \u2014 there were \u2014 you were winning.",
        "A: Well, we were \u2014 we only had enough \u2014 we had \u2014 only one in 10 had any guns at\nall. Nine were with the hands. They were supposed to get arms from the Germans.\nSo they were slaughtered right the very beginning. We did win with tremendous\nlosses, but we won the f\u2014 for two months, and the Germans that captured us, and\nwho fought in Stalingrad said that the battle of \u201944 in Warsaw was worse than\nStalingrad. It was house to house, room to room fighting. It was hard on them, and\nhard on us, but it was \u2014 we had the advantage, because it was our city, we knew\nevery corner, practically in Zoliborz, and we could defend ourselves better than\nattacking.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Do you remember the names of any of these Jewish-Polish fighters\nwith you?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t, I\u2014 I have it at home in my \u2014 in my books, the \u2014 but \u2014",
        "Q: Did everybody still go by a pseudonym at that point?",
        "A: Oh yes, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",

        "Q: So tell me, how did the surrender happen to you?",
        "A: Well, I was wounded again in the last \u2014 first day, and then I was wounded more\nseriously in the last day. About a week before the end of the uprising, I got\npneumonia, which then turned into TB. And I was very, very weak, and my father\nwas wounded in the sewers, and \u2014 with gangrene in his leg. So we lay in our house.\nBut when the German tanks started approaching, my father forced me to get out of\nbed, although I had huge fever, and I could hardly walk. And we walked \u2014 he took\nme back to the front lines, because he felt I would be safer in the company, as a \u2014 as\na soldier, than being caught as a insurgent with a gun, and wounded, because they\nwere shooting all the wounded prisoners. They didn\u2019t take prisoners, they were\nkilling them. Hospitals and everybody. So he took me there, and the whole city was\nin a flame. It was extremely hot and stinking, and I was given a anti-tank weapon,\nwhich I could hardly handle. And I was firing at one of the tanks, and I hit the tank,\nand the tank started firing. But there was another stan \u2014 tank standing by, and he\nsaw the window from which I fired, and he turned the gun, and fired at my window.\nAnd just before he fired, I jumped out. This was second story. And I busted my leg\n\u2014 broke my leg.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s how you were \u2014",
        "A: It still hurts.\n100\nSeptember 25, 2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: That was my second time that \u2014",
        "Q: You were wounded.",
        "A: But I- I1\u2014I\u2014I-\u2014I-\u2014I was flying down as the gun \u2014 as the \u2014",
        "Q: Shell.",
        "A: \u2014 shell was going above my head. So, it was worth it to survive. And then wo \u2014\nwe were supposed to fight our way to the Vistula, and the Russians were supposed\nto send boats to pick us up. And of course, they didn\u2019t, and the Germans knew\nabout it, and that\u2019s why they forced our command \u2014 our general to surrender,\nbecause we \u2014 the \u2014 we knew that we will be all killed by the artillery and tank fire,\nbefore we reached the Vistula even.",
        "Q: So you on a broken leg, and still with pneumonia \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 are still there. Did you say goodbye to your father at that front line?",
        "A: No, no, my father said goodbye as he took me two days before that, and he told\nme at that time that if I survive the prison camp, which was doubtful because of my\npneumonia and TB, I should not go back to Poland until Poland is free and\nindependent, but try to go to London, and to his brother, who was in the Polish\nembassy in London. So that\u2019s what I did. And then when I was in \u2014 I went to camp,September 25, 2014\nabout five days before the end of the war, it was an international camp, it was the\nlargest prisoner of war camp in Germany, Stalag 11a, Altengrabow, located\nbetween Magdeburg, and \u2014 and Berlin.",
        "Q: So, in the heart of Germany.",
        "A: In the heart of Germany, East Germany \u2014",
        "Q: Hm, yes, East Germany.",
        "A: \u2014 to be, later on, right. And of course, to be liberated by the Russians, but I \u2014 I\ndidn\u2019t know that, but five days before, at the camp gates, arrived hundreds of trucks,\nAmerican army trucks, to pick up American prisoners of war, and English an-and \u2014\nand the western allies. It was an international camp. Just leave Poles and Russians\nand the Slavs behind, to be liberated by the Russian army. And th \u2014 it \u2014 the war was\nstill going on. I could never figure out how they were allowed to cross the line,\nbecause the line was on the Elb, and this was quite a f \u2014 halfway b \u2014 to Berlin. And\nevidently what happened was that the American army sent some parachute jumpers\nto jump \u2014 to jump into the camp, to prevent the Germans from murdering the\nprisoners of war before they are liberated. Well, they were all caught, and they were\nsent to the commanding officer, the German commanding officer. And they\nexplained to him that if he allows the American trucks to cross the line, they will \u2014\nthey can liberate all of the prisoners, and the German didn\u2019t want, obviously, toSeptember 25, 2014\nhave the western prisoners fall into Russian hands, the way that the western allies\ndidn\u2019t, so he agreed to it. And they were allowed to go through the German lines, all\nthe way to the camp, and arrive at the camp and started loading American prisoners.\nAnd I had made friends with a Polish-American from Chicago, and I was standing\nat the gate, the Germans didn\u2019t care, the gates were opened, and he kind of waved\nme in, and I couldn\u2019t walk, so they got me onto the truck. And the truck drivers\nwere supposed to be unarmed, they were supposed to be Red Cross, which they\nwere not. And boys will be boys, they all had machine guns above the in \u2014 and I\nremember they stopped to shoot at a deer, and then they disarmed a couple of\nGerman officers in one of these little towns. We went about 75 - 80 miles an hour\nthrough these little, narrow, German towns. And we got to the other side of the\nriver. Well, they still carried me into the barracks, and the next day \u2014 we had about\ntwo, three days, and we started walking already. They carried me. And I \u2014 th-they\nwanted to take me as an American prisoner of war, and smuggle me to America,\nand I said no, I explained with my hands, because I didn\u2019t speak English, that I\nwanted to go to London. So they thought, oh, this kid is really crazy, he doesn\u2019t\nwant to go to America. But there were a couple of British Tommies walking by,\nand they explained that this guy \u2014 this kid want \u2014 was crazy, but he wants to go to\nLondon. So they took me under their arms, and took me to their camp. And thenSeptember 25, 2014\nthey had the problem because the \u2014 the following day, they \u2014 they were going to be\ninterviewed by the British intelligence, to make sure that people like me don\u2019t get\nthrough. So they decided to put me into one of their uniforms, which is a\n[indecipherable] uniform. And they gave me the name William Jones, and th \u2014\nand then they bandaged my throat, so that I was shot through and lost my voice.\nAnd that\u2019s the way they carried me through the colonels, and the generals who were\ninterviewed individually; each one of the prisoners was interviewed to make sure\nthat only the proper English prisoners got through. So the \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s amazing.",
        "A: \u2014 they saw this poor guy that cou \u2014 kid that could stand by, that was a veteran of\na battle of now \u2014 in Africa, North Africa. And they saluted me, they passed me\nthrough. Then we got onto the trucks, and went to Belgium. And that wou \u2014 that\nwas the victory day, that was five days later, after my liberation, and we \u2014 we got\nclean there, and we got debug \u2014",
        "Q: Did you speak Polish with anybody?",
        "A: No, no, I that \u2014 there were no Poles, I was the only one who was among, so it\nwas just lang \u2014 little language, a little German and I was able to ex \u2014 we \u2014 we \u2014 we\nlearned how to get together without using the language. And it was victory parade,\nand roses being thrown at us. And we were deloused, because we were all full ofSeptember 25, 2014\nsickness, and I was \u2014 weighed 70 pounds; I was skin and bones, and I couldn\u2019t\nwalk. And that next day, they put us on liberators, and sent us to England. And \u2014",
        "Q: And this was \u2014 do you remember the date?",
        "A: Well, this was the \u2014 the victory day was the fifth of May \u2014 eighth of May, wasn\u2019t\nit? Eighth of May. I was escape on the third of May, it was Polish national holiday,\nConstitution day.",
        "Q: So the day that you \u2014 you \u2014 yeah.",
        "A: And the eighth, five days later, was the \u2014 was when the Germany surrendered.\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying, that five days before, wi \u2014 they allowed American trucks\nthrough to show how the Germans didn\u2019t want \u2014 they rather surrender to the west,\nthan to the g \u2014 Russians.",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: But of course the [indecipherable] of this young Englishmen, Scotsmen,\nIrishmen were singing all the way to Tipperary, they were happy, and they\u2019re\nsaying, when we get to Oxford there will be girls. They haven\u2019t seen women for\nyears, and they \u2014 they \u2014 they were very naughty, they \u2014 they said, well, you know,\nwhen you get there, there will be women \u2014 air force girls to meet you, and there will\nbe air marshal, and there will be a God save the king band, and you know, to thank\nfor liberation, and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and he said, it\u2019s only one short word. Well,September 25, 2014\nthey taught me that word, short, four letter word, and I got down \u2014 down the steps, I\nwas the first ones. And these two pretty girls, and I turn with a big smile, and repeat\nit. They drop me like on the tarmac, and these two \u2014 three guys were sitting there,\nand laughing their heads off.",

        "Q: So, until that point, you hadn\u2019t spoken Polish to anybody since being liberated in\nAltengrabow\u201d",
        "A: Right, no, no, no.",
        "Q: And you got into the country, and even British intelligence, which had been\nthere in Germany to prevent someone from \u2014",

They\u2019re also building a moi \u2014 a \u2014 a memorial for him.",
        "Q: Tell me \u2014 one part that we skipped in this \u2014",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "Q: One part that we skipped in this was from the time you were captured, to your\ntransport to the prisoner of war camp, and what your experience was there. So I\u2019d\nlike to go back a little bit, and tell me: you were sick, you had your \u2014 you had\npneumonia, you had a broken leg, but what happened after you had to surrender,\nand what was \u2014 what happ \u2014 what was your experience from that moment until\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, first I \u2014 I was \u2014 I-I broke up my gun, rather than surrendering it, and then\nwe were marched off, and put on trucks and sent to a temporary camp outside of\nWarsaw. And I remember the Gestapo man going around the camp, looking like\nthey would like to murder us, but they were not allowed inside. And then they wereSeptember 25, 2014\nput \u2014 put on cattle train, and we were prisoners of the same tank regiment. It was a \u2014\nthe \u2014 now I can\u2019t remember it, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a elite German tank regiment\nand th-the general in charge of \u2014 give us a pep talk that how many tanks we have\nkilled, how many soldiers of his, what wonderful soldiers we were.",
        "Q: An enemy general saying this?",
        "A: In German, you know, he was being a \u2014 he was a ex-cavalry officer, and he\nknew that our Polish general from Olympic games in Berlin, and they were friends.\nSo he tried to be very straightforward, and \u2014 but he said, if we tried to escape from\nthe \u2014 the train, then we would, of course, be shot. And the \u2014 th \u2014 his \u2014 th-the \u2014 the \u2014\nthose German soldiers that were \u2014 that survived the battle, were going on home\nleave on the same train. So they were \u2014 th-they were our guards.",
        "Q: How did they behave towards you?",
        "A: They behaved very well, but I was dying and sick. I had \u2014 I just disgraced myself\nin-1n \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 1n the thing, and I\u2019m surprised that my \u2014 if they could they would\nhave thrown me out of that thing, was \u2014 I was so sick I couldn\u2019t sit, I couldn\u2019t \u2014 and\nI couldn\u2019t stand and there was no place to sit down. It was a cattle train, like the\nsame trains that they took people to gas chambers. And they wouldn\u2019t \u2014 I remember\nwe stopped in Berlin, there was a big allied air raid, and so that pleased us\nenormously. And then we got to the camp, and they didn\u2019t have any space, the campSeptember 25, 2014\nwas so full. And it was rainy, it was cold, it was wet. So I had to spend about two,\nthree nights on the ground.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re already sick.",
        "A: With the \u2014 raining on me, already sick. So I \u2014 I was pretty much dying when\nsome English nurse found me, and they took me to a TB hos \u2014 so-called hospital.\nAnd there were \u2014 we didn\u2019t have any beds, it was just the same wooden benches as\nin an \u2014 any other concentration camp, or prisoner of war camp. And the only\ndifference between concentration camp and \u2014 and a prison camp was that they tried\nto kill you with \u2014 by not feeding you. So it was starvation and hard work. They\nwould send you to coal mines and stone quarries, and you lasted about a week. But\nbecause I had TB, and I was dying, they didn\u2019t send me to \u2014 to work. And that\u2019s \u2014\nthat\u2019s how I survived. And once I got out of being sick, I went specially and \u2014 and \u2014\nand \u2014 to another barrack where they had certain diseases of skin, and I got it myself,\nso that \u2014 it was very unpleasant, very horrible, but that kept me from going to the \u2014\nto the \u2014 so I survived, but I was skin and bones at the end, and depressed, and I\nreally wanted to die there. But it \u2014 it was horrible.",
        "Q: Okay then, let\u2019s go back to England now. At the very beginning of our\ninterview, you said that your doctors in \u2014 in Britain \u2014",
        "A: Military doctor.\n110September 25, 2014",
        "Q: Military doctor, suggested that one of the ways you could heal is by writing\ndown what happened to you.",
        "A: Well, there were two things, one was the physical. They didn\u2019t know how to take\ncare of escaped prisoners of war, and they put me on normal diet; egg, rich milk and\neverything. The result was that my body turned into huge carbuncles. I just couldn\u2019t\nabsorb rich food, and it almost killed me with the good, rich food. But th-the worst\nthing was the psychological. I had nightmares. I would keep on fighting in the\nmiddle of the night. I would end up standing up on the \u2014 my bed, and I threw the\nside lamp in the corner because I thought I was throwing grenades. And I wa \u2014 I\nwas in \u2014 in no condition to go into normal life, let alone any kind of education. So\nthe doctor suggested that I write down my memoirs, ma \u2014 in the form of a diary.\nAnd I sat down \u2014 I was very fortunately to be invited \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 I had very bad\nrelations with my uncle. My uncle was a member \u2014 was a completely different man\nfrom my father. He was 10 years younger, he never fought in any war, he was a\nvery comfortable, childless couple, lived for themselves, and just a real diplom \u2014 a\ner \u2014 diplomats [indecipherable]. So when I arrived, he blamed me for the Warsaw\nuprising. And I\u2019d lost my friends, my whole city, my whole family. And they\nwanted to adopt me. So, we didn\u2019t get along, but fortunately, there was a English\naristocrat, who was a member of parliament, a woman called Lady Ida Copeland,\n111September 25, 2014\nwho was a Member of Parliament, in 1935 visited Warsaw with a group of British\nMPs, and was entertained at the city hall by my father. So when the word got\nthrough the British government, that the son of the president of Warsaw arrived in\nsuch a terrible shape, she invited me into her palatial estate in Cornwall. And so I\nfound myself from hell, in heaven. I was met at \u2014 at Truro in \u2014 in Cornwall by a\nchauffeur with a Rolls Royce, and I was taken to the this gorgeous vi \u2014 house, right\non the waterfront, with hundreds of acres of land. It \u2014 the \u2014 the family was the\nCopeland china, the famous china. And she was very interested in Polish affairs.\nShe was a good friend of Ignacy Paderewski, and she put me in the same bedroom\nthat he had, with a view of the \u2014 0-o-of the \u2014 the ocean.",
        "Q: Tell \u2014 tell people who was Ignacy Paderewski.",
        "A: Ignacy Paderewski was the great Polish pianist, and prime minister in the first\nWorld War.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And \u2014",
        "Q: So what kind of \u2014 wa \u2014 you say you \u2014 you hadn't \u2014 you suffered from\nnightmares.",
        "A: Right.September 25, 2014",
        "Q: What kind of personality did you have at that point? How had you been changed,\nhow were you traumatized?",
        "A: I had no patience. I had no patience with other people\u2019s problems, because I\nthought they were un \u2014 completely ridiculous and unimportant, in comparison to\nwhat I went through, and what my friends, Zula(ph) and Ludwig and everybody\nelse went through. And when they complain about the weather, or complain about\nth-the clothes, or complain about anything, I had no patience, and I was very, very\ndifficult to live with for that reason. Because, after all, everybody\u2019s problems is a\nbig problem, but at that time I didn\u2019t realize. And 1-1-1-1t went through \u2014 at least\nthrough my first marriage, that I wasn\u2019t a very good husband. And I went through\nwhat now everybody recognize as the post traumatic \u2014",
        "Q: Stress disorder.",
        "A: \u2014 stress syndrome. But in those days nobody knew, so they almost killed me\nwith good food, and they almost \u2014 and didn\u2019t recognize my problems. But, I was\nlucky, because in \u2014 Lady Copeland became my fairy godmother. She not only \u2014\nwell, I\u2014 I \u2014 when IJ arrived there, I arrived in my battle dress, and my duffle bag.\nWhen I got to the bedroom, there was a black tie ready, and the regular clothes that\nshe bought, shoes. And every night we would dress for dinner. This was still \u2014 it\nwas a S\u2014 60 room house, and some beautiful antiques, and beautif \u2014 anten \u2014 and\n113\nSeptember 25, 2014\ninteresting people, and at breakfast I am a\u2014 we would just help ourselves, we had a\nbig buffet, and that\u2019s where I got all that rich food that almost killed me. But she \u2014\nin the afternoon \u2014 in \u2014 in the morning and early afternoon, I would write my story\ndown, and then she would take me for rides in ca \u2014 when she \u2014 and she was very\ninvolved in social life. And I always, always went with her in her Rolls Royce,\ndriving around. And I remember one day on the radio of the Rolls Royce came\nthrough information that Winston Churchill lost the elections, and she burst in\ntears, because she was very close friend of Churchill\u2019s. And that\u2019s the only time\nthat I was able to take her into my arms, the old lady, and try to cheer her up. But\nshe didn\u2019t \u2014 after I left and went back to London, she arranged to have me go and\nbe admitted to the top elite school in northern Ireland, the Eaton of northern\nIreland, and I spent a year and a half there, being a normal schoolboy.",
        "Q: Amazing. Amazing, how could that happen?",
        "A: Well, the headmaster and the masters all knew my story, but on purpose they\ndidn\u2019t allow me to get involved with it. So I\u2014 I \u2014I was on the crew, I did all the\nsports, and I learned English, of course. I excelled in English literature. I had\nproblems in mathematics and \u2014 and \u2014 and physics, chemistry, but I was very good\nin history and in English. I was a top student. And then I got my Oxford and\nCambridge school certificate, and I had a choice of what I was going to become, a\n114September 25, 2014\nlawyer, doctor or architect. I wanted to be a brain surgeon, but in order to get into a\nmedi \u2014 school of medicine, you had to learn Latin, and I was just learning English,\nand that didn\u2019t appeal to me, so I decided to become an architect. And then I was\nadmitted to Oxford next year, and \u2014",
        "Q: This would be what year?",
        "A: This was \u2014 well, I got there in 1945, I stayed through \u2014 I graduated in the end of\n1946 with Oxford and Cambridge school certificate. It was 1947 \u2014 1947 - \u00b048.",
        "Q: That you entered Oxford?",
        "A: That I entered Oxford for not quite a year. I was a very rebellious student still,\nand I didn\u2019t like the traditional curriculum, and I was thrown out because I was \u2014\ninstead of doing a house for a British ambassador in Athens, I was doing Frank\nLloyd Wright\u2019s house in Arizona. So I left, and then I got my visa and came to\nAmerica.",
        "Q: Well, how did \u2014 how did that \u2014 well, first of all, I want to go back a little bit with\nyour schooling. For somebody who had had no formal schooling throughout those\nvery formative years, of you know, middle school and high school gymnasium, as it\nwould be in Europe \u2014",
        "A: Right.\n115\nSeptember 25, 2014",
        "Q: \u2014 how is it that only a year and a half schooling got you up to faw \u2014 college\nlevel? That\u2019s an amazing achievement.",
        "A: Well, not only to college level, I never went to college. I went straight to \u2014",
        "Q: The university?",
        "A: No, to \u2014 went to the \u2014 the master\u2019s degree. I didn\u2019t \u2014",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t \u2014 you bypassed a bachelor\u2019s.",
        "A: The graduate school.",
        "Q: You went to graduate school.",
        "A: Yeah, to graduate school. So I\u2014 I\u2014 I had kindergarten, two years, then I had a\nyear and a half high school, and then I went to graduate school. And my feeling 1s\nthat so many years are wasted 1-in college. Th-Th-Th \u2014 if \u2014 if the high school 1s at a\nhigh level \u2014 and the high school in \u2014 in England was excellent. It was at least\nsecond year of college, if not third. So that when I got to Yale, they \u2014 they wanted \u2014\noh, there\u2019s another funny story, if you want to hear about it. When I was still at\nOxford School of Architecture, I applied to three schools in America; to Harvard,\nYale, and another school. And Yale se \u2014 was the one who showed interest in me,\nbut they asked for a \u2014 the credit hours from Oxford. So I went to the dean of the\nschool of architecture in Oxford, and \u2014 Dr. Rice, and I said, well, here is the letter.\nCan you write a letter and tell them how many credit hours? And he said, what?\n116\nSeptember 25, 2014\nThese Americans are crazy. You know that you are here working seven days a\nweek, 12 hours a day. And he added it all up in seven hours, and I had more credit\nhours than \u2014 than a PhD. So when I got to Yale, they did \u2014 they wanted to put me in\nthe last year of graduate school.",
        "Q: Oh my gosh.",
        "A: And I had to convince them that I didn\u2019t learn anything at Oxford. I insisted on\nrepeating the first year, and it was the best decision I made.",
        "Q: Oh my goodness.",
        "A: But I was a scholarship student, I had the \u2014 I had no money, and \u2014",
        "Q: Did you have any family in the United States?",
        "A: Well, I had my uncle, but I \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014I-\u2014 we had no \u2014 no contact.",
        "Q: That meant your father\u2019s brother from London?",
        "A: Right, right, he ended up as a professor at the University of Alabama,\nTuscaloosa.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But we \u2014 we \u2014 we \u2014 we-we broke relations altogether. We just couldn\u2019t get\nalong. So he didn\u2019t help me at all. And then, coming over on the Queen Mary, I\nmet an American girl, and a year later, I married her. So I became an American\n117September 25, 2014\ncitizen very quickly. And she \u2014 we were married through Yale graduate school, and\nhad children.",
        "Q: Okay. How many children did you have?",
        "A: Two.",
        "Q: Two. And why did you leave the U.K. for the United States?",
        "A: Why did I leave United Kingdom?",
        "Q: Correct.",
        "A: Well, there was \u2014 I think one was an architectural reason. I didn\u2019t like traditional\narchitecture. I wanted to do modern architecture, and America beckoned, from\nlibrary and everything I saw, Frank Lloyd Wright and Louis Kahn and th-the\ngreat American architects were here. The second, I felt that I wanted to become a\nfull citizen of a country. I knew I couldn\u2019t go back to Poland because it was under\nRussian occupation. And I knew that I would have better chance of becoming\nAmerican than a British citizen. And \u2014 but my British friends felt that I was making\na big mistake, and they were very sorry to see me go, but \u2014 and when I arrived here,\nI realized how lucky I was in England. A, I was part of the elite, I had veterans\nbenefits, I \u2014 th-the government paid for my education at Oxford, and here I arrive\nwith five dollars in my pocket, and the \u2014 without knowing anybody. I \u2014 again, I\ncouldn\u2019t \u2014 I went to uncle, but we \u2014 we couldn\u2019t get along, so I left, and I arrived inSeptember 25, 2014\nBoston with five dollars in my pocket, I couldn\u2019t find work. I went to \u2014 tried to find\nwork as a ste-stevedore, and \u2014 a-and they laughed me off. So I was starving for\nabout a month. And finally, I got to Cape Cod, where my future wife lived, and I\nbecame a waiter. And I was trained, and then started saving money, and that paid\nfor the first year of Yale.",
        "Q: Amazing, amazing. In some ways you\u2019 ve answered this question in part, but how\ndid what you experienced shape you? What kind of a person did it make you?",
        "A: Well, physically, if something doesn\u2019t kill you, it makes you stronger. You\nprobably know from the people who were in Siberia that didn\u2019t die, they \u2014 they\nbecame stronger. The climate, the conditions, and particularly during the growing\nup years, development years, physically, you become stronger. Also, having\nexperience all the difficulties, you become much stronger as a person, and you don\u2019t\nallow anything to keep you from your career goals. So I knew what I wanted to be,\nand I was able to do it, and to conquer all the difficulties.",
        "Q: Did the nightmares go away?",

        "A: Mostly, yes. And \u2014 and I have kept it out by writing about it, by sharing this with\nother people, to prepare American kids for life. And I find that very satisfactory,\nand have a lot \u2014 made a lot of friends.",
        "Q: Did \u2014 when you met your family again, tha \u2014 your parents, and I take it your\nsister must have stayed in Poland, is that right?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That would have been 1959 - 1960?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: In those years.",
        "A: The first time. What \u2014 did you have the opportunity to find out and talk about the\nthings that you couldn\u2019t talk about during the war years?",
        "Q: Some. I saw \u2014 I met Steffa(ph), who was out \u2014 straight out of Auschwitz with\nher number on the leg, and I\u2014 I bought some flowers, I took it. So we tooked \u2014 I\ntalked with Steffa(ph) about Ludwig, and about those things. And I talked with my\nparents, but since we were in constant correspondence, I knew what was happening\nthere, and they knew about my life. But was great, the getting back, but Warsaw\nwas not the same place. And the thing which I really missed, was the Jewish section\nof Warsaw, because it was completely destroyed, and never rebuilt. So the place\nwhere there is the Jewish memorial, the Jewish history museum, now was \u2014 theseSeptember 25, 2014\nwere residential streets, with beautiful architecture, and it\u2019s all gone. A-And so, I\u2014I\nget lost in that part of the ci-city. The old city, and certain monuments, and\nZoliborz, the place that I was brought up, has changed very little.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Does your family house still stand?",
        "A: No, well, had \u2014 they had \u2014 that stands, but they had to sell it during the war,\nbecause my father\u2019s salary was so inadequate, it lasted only for five days of the\nmonth, the rest of the time my mother had to bring in food, and \u2014 and \u2014 and sell it\non the black market. So they \u2014 they had to \u2014 my mother had to sell all the jewelry,\nand they \u2014 finally, they had to sell the house, with the understanding that we could\nlive til the end of the war. But they used the money to pay off the \u2014 the debt on the\nhouse, and bought a si\u2014 a country house, where my mother had the garden.",
        "Q: Di\u2014 were there any actions about \u2014 against your father, or for your father, after\nthe country went communist, given that he had a prominent position.",
        "A: That\u2019s a very good question, and they\u2019re being asked all the time. Yes, my father\nwas offered ministerial positions in the communist government, which he refused.\nSo he lived in a very \u2014 in a workers\u2019 house, a tiny, little place, and \u2014 a-and \u2014 and in\nreal poverty. But he never, of course, joined the communists. So the \u2014 he was an\n121September 25, 2014\nenemy of the state. They knew about it. But fortunately, before the war, he was\ninvolved as vice-president, building a lot of workers\u2019 housing. And the socialists,\nwho were in the first communist government, remembered his contributions for\nsocial welfare to the people, and one of them became his protector. And he pi \u2014 not\nonly protected his life, but the whole family. So th \u2014 he did whatever he could, you\nknow. He didn\u2019t last in his job very long, but he was well-placed, and high\ngovernment official, and he was able to save them.",
        "Q: So, that meant that \u2014 [technical interruption, break] So, we were talking about\npostwar, and \u2014 and that there was some \u2014 your father had a protector in the socialist\nparty, which at first was allied with the communist party in Poland.",
        "A: Right.",

        "A: Schwallba(ph).",

        "Q: I see. When \u2014 did he also arrange for a place for him to \u2014 to live?",
        "A: Well, he couldn\u2019t do much, there was so little housing.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And the only housing that was left were the pre \u2014 the very, very workers\u2019 houses\nthat my father and he worked on before the war.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So that was where my father ended.",
        "Q: And did your father have \u2014 what kind a work did he do, or did he do any work\n[indecipherable] afterward?",
        "A: My father was work in Gdansk for a shipping company, and then he came to\nWarsaw for the last few years he worked, and the rebuilding the housing in the\ncity, and then he went \u2014 retired, and I was \u2014 I was able to get him to s \u2014 to come to\nAmerica for a few weeks, few days.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: To visit me here.\n123September 25, 2014",
        "Q: Okay. Is there anything else that you think we should talk about, that we should\nexplore here today, in having discussed all these unbelievable years, and\nunbelievable events that happened to you, that you think is important for people to\nknow about?",
        "A: Well, I think it\u2019s important to know that freedom is not free, that you have to\nremember it on a daily basis. You have to teach this to the children, so the history\nwouldn\u2019t repeat itself. And I\u2019m afraid history does repeat itself. We can see that in \u2014\nin what\u2019s happening in the world today. The middle \u2014 Middle East, Ukraine. And I\nthink that our children are being disadvantaged by not being educated properly\nabout the Holocaust, about the second World War, about the need to be on guard to\nsave your independence. Just because we had forefathers who fought in the\nrevolution, and made this country, doesn\u2019t mean that we have to lower our guard,\nand not defend it on a daily basis. And you have things happening, which shouldn\u2019t\nbe happening. People being hurt which shouldn\u2019t be hurt. And I think it\u2019s the \u2014 for\nexample, the scout movement, which I think 1s extremely important in training the\ncharacter of the young people, is being maligned. There\u2019s many high school kids,\nwho when they try to be patriotic, or \u2014 or \u2014 are being discouraged for \u2014 or \u2014 or even\nthrown out of school for carrying flags, or saying \u2014 believing in God, or in \u2014 in\u2014 in\n\u2014 in \u2014 1n things which are good, and higher, and which will prepare them for \u2014 and \u2014September 25, 2014\nan-and not spoiling the children. I think it\u2019s a terrible thing to \u2014 just because the\nparents have an easier life, they make it so easy for the children that they go and\nlook for satisfaction with drugs, and smoking and sex, and \u2014 and \u2014 and all kinds of\nbad things, because they lack ideology. And I think they\u2019re starved for the ideology.\nAnd I find that when I talk to the groups of young people, they are just starved for\nmy words, they \u2014 because they don\u2019t get it at home, they don\u2019t get it in school.",
        "Q: So, you\u2019d say for \u2014 for values that are beyond themselves.",
        "A: For values which they are not getting, and they know that they should be getting.",
        "Q: I see. What about Poland\u2019s young people? Have you had an opportunity to talk\nto them?",
        "A: Yes. The \u2014 there is certain amount of the same thing, because since\nindependence, and the ones who were \u2014 never encountered German or Russian\noppression, don\u2019t fully appreciate it. On the other hand, I think there\u2019s still enough\nadults and teachers, who are teaching history, recent history. For example, when I\nwas there last month, I saw 100,000 young people doing a marathon on the day of\nthe Warsaw uprising. There were three days of festivities; theaters, plays, movies.\nThr-Three movies were made, enormous movies about the Warsaw uprising. So,\nthat\u2019s always kept \u2014 that, together with the solidarity movement and Walesa\n125\nSeptember 25, 2014\nhimself says that solidarity wouldn\u2019t exist, if 1t wasn\u2019t for the uprising. That the \u2014\nthe roots were in the fight for freedom and independence that we fought for in 1944.",
        "Q: Well, how do you make that direct connection? If the uprising hadn't happened,\nwhy would solidarity not happen?",
        "A: Well, according to Walesa, the spirit of Polish history is the 19\" century\nuprising. First ni \u2014 first the KoSciuszko uprising at the beginning of the 18\"\ncentury, 18 \u2014 19\" century, 1830, 1863, 1944. And then solidarity in 1979 \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 1980. So this was something which was passed from father to son, from the\ngrandfather to the grandson, and kept alive the will to live in freedom, and not be\nsatisfied to be a slave. And that\u2019s why Walesa says in his introduction in my new\nbook, that if it wasn\u2019t for our actions in 44, he feels that the solidarity movement\nwould not exist today, and Poland wouldn\u2019t be free. He makes that very direct \u2014",
        "Q: Connection.",
        "A: \u2014 line \u2014 conja \u2014 and his own father was arrested, and died at the age of 33, so he\ndidn\u2019t know his father.",
        "Q: And what was it like at the 75\" anniversary \u2014",
        "A: Seventieth.\n126September 25, 2014",
        "Q: Seventieth anniversary, excuse me, of the uprising? And you saw all of \u2014 the\nmarathon, and the celebrations and the commemoration of this. And you were there.\nHow many of the former people \u2014 how many people like you are still here, who\ncould see that, and \u2014",
        "A: Not many, but those mostly older and sicker, there are \u2014 a lot of in the\nwheelchairs. But the important thing was the way that the \u2014 today\u2019s citizens treated\nus veterans. Taxi drivers refused to take fees, restaurants were free. Hotels were\nfree. It was just making it \u2014 us feel that they owe us a debt of gratitude. And it was\nvery satisfying. And young people, the \u2014 for each one of us veterans, there was\nalways a boy scout or a girl scout that would take each one under the arms, take us\nto the seats, sit down and look after us, bring us water. So we were \u2014 we-were \u2014\nwere well looked after.",
        "Q: I think that\u2019s a wonderful, fitting image \u2014",
        "A: Isn\u2019t it? Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 and tribute, you know, with which to end our interview today. And f\u2014 with\nthat, I would like to thank you, Mr. Kulski, for coming by, for sharing your story\nwith us, for explaining the events and the experiences that you had, and the bravery\nthat you showed.

        "Q: I would like to start with getting a sense of what your life was like before the\nwar. So I will ask very basic questions, and from that, we will go from there and\nbuild the picture of \u2014 that we\u2019d want people to know, to put your story in context.\nSo the first question: what was the date of your birth?",

        "Q: So \u2014so, your father\u2019s grandfather, what kind of family did he come from? He\nwas the Christian element in this, right?",

        "Q: Okay. And it also sounds \u2014 I mean, one of the questions that I usually ask is,\nhow much of a person\u2019s family history was told to them? And sometimes peopleSeptember 25, 2014\ndon\u2019t have much, because no one talked to them as a little child, but it sounds to me\nthat your father told you very \u2014 a lot about your family\u2019s \u2014",

        "Q: Well, it also \u2014 I mean, from what you were saying is that many people will \u2014 will\nsay in their testimonies, they \u2014 as they\u2019re talking about their lives, either that there\nwas anti-Semitism that they experienced as Holocaust survivors, or as Jews growing\nup in Poland, or as Poles who had very little contact with \u2014 with the Jewish\ncommunity. That\u2019s different for you, and for your family.",

        "Q: We\u2019ll talk about that.",
        "Q: We'll talk about that. It sounds pretty idyllic, as a place, and as a summer \u2014",
        "Q: And did you, even being only 10 years old, did you sense that there was\nsomething that was troubling in the larger political air, or not so much?",
        "Q: Yeah.September 25, 2014",
        "Q: Yeah. So, when your father gets you settled in \u2014 in this summer place, and \u2014 did\nhe expect to stay with you, and then was suddenly called back?",

        "Q: So once your mother tells you the war starts, do you remember what happened\nnext?",
        "Q: Well, it reminds me of that very famous scene in, I think it\u2019s Andr\u00e9 Wider\u2019s\nfilm, about Katyn \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 where there\u2019s a bridge, and people are running on one side \u2014",

        "Q: If you ever remember his name, let me know, and we\u2019ll add it \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: This begs the question: President Starzynski is executed right away because he\nis no longer useful. And your father then takes over his position in 1939, and is in it\nfor the next five horrible years.",

        "Q: Czerniakow.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, stadtprasident.",
        "Q: So that meant that your father di \u2014 reported directly to Leist.",
        "Q: Did you meet him?",
        "Q: Amazing. So, it sounds that \u2014 from your telling, that he was li \u2014 not brutal, in a\nvery brutal position. Is that \u2014",
        "Q: Amazing. Amazing.",
        "Q: I mean, but I also think \u2014 I mean, then Leist, your father, and all those people\nwere living on a razor\u2019s edge.",
        "Q: Did \u2014 did you ever \u2014 I mean, it sounds to me that all of these things you\u2019re\ntelling me, you learned after the war.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Dur \u2014 yeah, at the time, when your father was in this extremely precarious\nposition, did he ever talk at home about what was going on 1n the office?",
        "Q: Well, I want to \u2014 excuse m \u2014 because that\u2019s exactly one of my main questions.",
        "Q: As I was reading your \u2014 your \u2014 your memoirs, or your \u2014 sort of like your \u2014 your\ndiary that you wrote afterwards.",
        "Q: I found it very odd that at such a young age, you would not live at home. Tell me\nwhat happened. How did things progress?",
        "Q: He knew this?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Unbelievable.",
        "Q: So, did you fa \u2014 was your father \u2014 did you tell him before you went away, that\nyou and your friend were collecting these unexploded bombs?",
        "Q: And did your mother have anything to say about it?",
        "Q: She didn\u2019t know anything about the powder, or the \u2014 or the \u2014September 25, 2014",

        "Q: And \u2014",
        "Q: Oh wow.",
        "Q: And you said \u2014 and you said he was Jewish?",
        "Q: And how is it that they wouldn\u2019t have been in the ghetto?September 25, 2014",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "Q: But here is my question. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s not so much that they were integrated, and not\n\u2014 religion didn\u2019t play a part, it is, wouldn\u2019t they have been known by the Gestapo,\nand why \u2014 how is it that they could hide in plain sight in \u2014 in W-Warsaw.",
        "Q: I see. And it\u2019s a kind of crass way to put it, but did Ludwig look Jewish?September 25, 2014",
        "Q: Okay. So that meant that if he was walking down the street, he could have been\npicked up.",
        "Q: We\u2019ll come to that.",
        "Q: But \u2014 because I want to do this a little bit more chronologically \u2014",
        "Q: Okay. But it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s just so surprising to me, to hear of somebody who would be\nliving openly, more or less, on the Aryan side, and he could \u2014 considered himself a\nProtestant, but that doesn\u2019t matter if the Germans are in control.",
        "Q: Did he have false papers?",
        "Q: Did he have false papers? Did he have false papers? Did he have real papers that\nsaid I am \u2014",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So what was the test?",
        "Q: So tell me, what was the test that you had \u2014 that you had for him?",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "Q: So, you maybe have to repeat it a little bit, but tell me what your life was like\nwith Ludwig, in this new place. You had the two Solkul(ph) sisters, you had\nMarek(ph). He was Ludwig\u2019s son?",
        "Q: Where was Marek\u2019s(ph) mother?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So, she was his girlfriend?",
        "Q: She was his girlfriend?",
        "Q: Yeah. And in this household you first joined the underground, and then at age\n13, you were accepted into the underground army\u2019?",
        "Q: Which means you don\u2019t really have a childhood. Your childhood ended then.",
        "Q: Well, they don\u2019t want their children to die.",
        "Q: Well, you know that \u2014 in one way, when I was looking through your memoir,\nyou\u2019re answering another question that I had, because I had \u2014 I see these pictures of\nchildren in uniforms, with guns, you know, and they clearly aren\u2019t even teenage\nboys yet. They\u2019re in their \u2014 they\u2019re in that age of 10 to 13. And it just \u2014 it boggles\nthe mind, that a teenage boy, who\u2019s 17 or 18, could be part of this is already\nsomething you can \u2014 they\u2019re on their way to manhood.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: It\u2019s true.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Amazing. Tell me \u2014 let\u2019s go back to how things \u2014 what were some of the other\nactivities you took part with under Ludwig\u2019s, I suppose guidance, or \u2014 or direction,\nand so on?",
        "Q: And how do you do that?",
        "Q: How do you do that? How do you get trained for that?September 25, 2014",
        "Q: Tell me \u2014 tell me some of the activities that you took part in. You said you were\npart of the commando unit that was \u2014",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Was this when the ghetto was still part of \u2014 under Leist\u2019s control, rather than the\nSS?",
        "Q: I see.",

        "Q: So, Zula(ph) and \u2014 [break]",
        "Q: Okay, this is a continuation of our interview with Mr. Julian Kulski. We were\ntalking about you visiting Zula(ph) in the ghetto. So that ax \u2014 answers another\nquestion that I had, which was, what happened to Zula(ph). She was then forced,\nwith her mother, to enter the ghetto.",
        "Q: What did you see when you enter \u2014 when you emerged inside \u2014",
        "Q: What wa \u2014 okay, what kind of information \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 and what kind of requests were made\u2019?",
        "Q: So, when you were in the ghetto, there was the request of a life for a life \u2014 when\nyou were in the ghetto, there was this request of a life for a life, because so many\nJews were being killed indiscriminately.",
        "Q: There was a request for information on how to build bunkers.",
        "Q: And for arms.",
        "Q: And you were able to supply them with 50 \u2014 what was it again?",
        "Q: Fifty pistols. And that was later.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: That was later.",
        "Q: So was this the only \u2014September 25, 2014",
        "Q: So, after curfew.",
        "Q: Was this the only time, after the ghetto was sealed off, that you were in the\nghetto, or did you go in to deliver those 50 pistols?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay, and so I want to go back to this again. When I asked earlier, not what\nhappened to her at the end, but how is it that she had to go to the ghetto when she\nwas half and half \u2014",
        "Q: I see. And so, for Zula(ph), and her mother, of course, who was Jewish, it\u2019s a \u2014\nit\u2019s a given.",
        "Q: But for \u2014 and this is where the juxtaposition for me sounded so confusing; that\nshe is forced, but Ludwig isn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Do you see what I\u2019m saying? She cannot have a choice of living outside \u2014 this is\nsomeone who doesn\u2019t know the war, who doesn\u2019t know the situation. And why I\nwas ask \u2014",
        "Q: Outside the ghetto.",
        "Q: Outside the ghetto, okay.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: You wore a ring?",
        "Q: Okay. I think we\u2019ll break now, and we\u2019ll talk about all of these incidents aft \u2014\n[break]",
        "Q: This is a continuation with our interview at the Holocaust Museum with Mr.\nJulian Kulski. And before the break, we were talking about the guns, and the \u2014 the\narmaments that were brought in by the fire brigade, to the ghetto. But you were not\ninvolved in that. And from what I understand, it was the one and only time you\nwere in the ghetto after the wall was secure \u2014 that is, people could not go in. Did\nyou ever go there again?",
        "Q: Okay.September 25, 2014",

        "Q: And, excuse me, for those of us who don\u2019t know, why would that be making\nfun? If you were a \u2014 a\u2014 you know, recognize this person \u2014",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",

And my\nSeptember 25, 2014\nfather was the head of the commission in Moscow, which together with my mother,\nwho went through and brought all the antiques, and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and things which\nthey found in museums, which were Polish, back to Poland.",
        "A: So they thu \u2014 they had a interesting life during the early days, and then, after\nthat, my father decided that he wanted to become a political scientist, and he went\nto \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to France. My mother worked, in order for him to study, and he went\nto Sorbonne, and he got his degree in political science. So when they got back to\nPoland, he was going to be in the \u2014 Minister of Foreign Affairs, but instead, he\nended up with the treasury department, and then in 1935, became vice-president of\nWarsaw.",
        "A: The difference between the mayors and the presidents is that large cities like\nWarsaw, Krakow, Poznan, Gdansk, have presidents. Smaller towns, smaller\ncities, have mayors.",
        "A: So that\u2019s the only difference, and it\u2019s basically the same functions, but a different\ntitle. And since Warsaw was the capitol of Poland, it was the most important city,\ntherefore the president of Warsaw was second in line to the president of Poland.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: And after the \u2014 when \u2014 when the war started, the Polish government left, and the\npresident of the city was ste \u2014 Stefan Starzynski, who fought against the russi \u2014\nGermans for a whole month, and he, in fact, became the head of the Polish state,\nand the Germans arrested him immediately after they conquered Warsaw, and shot\nhim a month later, killed him. And \u2014 and then my father became \u2014 my father was an\nold friend of his still from childhood days, and they were together in the legions,\nthey were together in the prison camp, they were together in Moscow, they were\ntogether in the treasury, and then in Polish cit \u2014 in the Warsaw city hall. So that\nwas then the natural that he followed, and was appointed president, during the\nwartime years, from 1939 to 1944.\nSeptember 25, 2014",
        "A: It was a horrible position.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: As vice-president \u2014 as pres \u2014 it was the whole transportation system, buses,\nstreetcars, fu-future metro. Besides that, they electricity, all the industrial \u2014 city\nindustrial concerns. Labor. Th-the \u2014 there were four vice-presidents, and he wa \u2014 th-\nth-the \u2014 this wa \u2014 this was his responsibility.",
        "A: No, my mother never went to the university. She was well-read, and very\nintelligent, but she never went to university, she married early.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Well, she \u2014 she worked. She taught Polish to some Russians in fra \u2014 Paris. She\ndid everything she could in order to live on basically pennies. So, it was very\ndifficult times for them, but they managed it. And she wrote her memoirs, and my\nfather wrote his memoirs: my father\u2019s are published, my mother\u2019s are still\nunpublished.",
        "A: Oh yes. This was all of when he wa \u2014 she wa \u2014 that\u2019s why she was waiting. She\nwanted to put him through university, to \u2014 to give him the opportunity, and only\nafter he became \u2014 started to go up in the treasury department, they decided to have\nme.",
        "A: My mother was very outgoing. She loved people, and everybody loved her. Her\nmaternal instinct being bar \u2014 having to bring up her sisters and brother when she\nwas a teenager, taught her how to take care of it. Also, she had an example of her\nfather, who was also very interested in \u2014 1n helping people. The towns that they\nlived were very large Jewish population, and her father was known for taking care,\nand helping the poverty stricken Jews. And so my mother was brought up in the\nspirit of looking after people, and taking care. And this was one of the problem thatSeptember 25, 2014\nI had with her, because she was trying to take care of me too much, and I was too\nindependent. So we\u2019re very much alike, I\u2019m very much like my mother, but we had\nthat problem. We loved each other, but I wanted to be independent, and \u2014 and this\nlasted the whole li-lifetime. My father was completely different. My father was\nreally quite shy, to start with. He had to overcome it to become a public figure, and\nhe did very well in that. But he was an intellectual. He thought 10 times before he\nspoke, and he was very broadminded, liberal, and a \u2014 a\u2014 a very admired person in\nWarsaw, known and admired. Sometimes my mother would get on his nerves\nbecause she would say something just without thinking, and that would get him \u2014\nget him into apoplexy.",
        "A: They were both very strong people. Ver \u2014 extremely strong people, 1-1-in \u2014 in\ndifferent ways, quite opposite, but very much in love.",
        "A: So the \u2014 I\u2014I was sumb \u2014 I met a cousin of mine in \u2014 in \u2014 1n Poland just months\nago, and they comparing our bring \u2014 how we\u2019re brought up. They were rich, and \u2014\nbut didn\u2019t have love. And we had lots of love, but we were not so rich.\nSeptember 25, 2014",
        "A: Exactly.",

        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh yes, my father and my \u2014 and Uncle Norbert used to talk politics, but the\nclosest I got was when I was eight years old, I spent summer in Bydgoszcz, which\nis on the \u2014 a city on the German border. And my so-called uncle, he was one of my\nfather\u2019s wartime buddies, was the governor of the province, and I was lucky to be \u2014\nspend two summers in the governor\u2019s palace.",

        "A: \u2014 and I\u2014 I\u2014I learned how to have great social life, to a point that when I got\nhome, I told my mother that she didn\u2019t behave like a president\u2019s wife should, sh \u2014\nthe way Aunt Hella as the governor\u2019s wife \u2014 because they had balls every week,\nand lots of food and lots of dancing. And furthermore, I told her \u2014 told that my\nfather should be a right-winger, not a left-winger, and my mother told him that, and\nhe burst laughing, that this eight year old was trying to tell him how to \u2014 what kind\nof politics he should have. But I was just interested in all the nice things.",
        "A: All the wonderful cookies, and \u2014 and chocolates, and one day I even ordered\neight guys with \u2014 f-for a ball which didn\u2019t exist, and my uncle caught me and\nchased me around the palace.",
        "A: So, I\u2014 I was full of beans.September 25, 2014",
        "A: Well, it \u2014 it \u2014 1t was not \u2014 it was only one family. I think that in school, the\nteachers, the family and everybody, was so excited to have a free and independent\nPoland, free for everybody. The Christians, the Jews were having, you know,\nparticularly the Jews had wonderful theaters, and \u2014 and \u2014 and social life, and at \u2014 in\nmy life, th-there was \u2014 I didn\u2019t run into any anti-Semitism, because well, the \u2014 my\nfather\u2019s closest friends were Jewish members of the prepe \u2014 legion police, legion,\nwho fought the [indecipherable] so the \u2014 I wa \u2014 religion was not an important part\nin my bri \u2014 upbringing.",
        "A: Well, it-it-it-it was different in the country, and different in the city.

But th-the\nplace where I lived was all Poles of Jewish background, who were the leaders of\nPoland, intel \u2014 university professors, army men. Ten percent of Polish officer corps\nwere Jewish. So that I didn\u2019t pay any attention t-to the \u2014 to that. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t\nrun into it, but I\u2014 I heard stories that in the country, that it was different, that the\nOr-Orthodox Jews lived separately from the Catholic peasants, and sometimes there\nwere problems, but it was never s-something that I saw in the city.",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t part of my life.",

And I also s-saw a\nvery funny movie of Hitler, making fun of him. So that was the beginning. And\nthen, of course, I start to \u2014 since then, I got interested in who Hitler was, because he\nlooked like s-s-such a funny guy, at the beginning.

And we didn\u2019t know\nwhat it was. We didn\u2019t wa \u2014 know that the war started, but they were flying to bomb\nWarsaw, so they had bombs underneath it. And so we just lay down until they \u2014\nthey were \u2014 there seemed like hundreds of them. There weren\u2019t that many, I\u2019m sure,\nbut it appeared to me, to a little boy, and we were terrified. And then, after they left,\nthe trees straightened out, and there was this wonderful silence after the noise. And\nthen we loo \u2014 I looked up at the sky, and there was a eagle circling around.

And so my first thought was, they didn\u2019t look like\nvictors, they looked like a\u2014a losing army. But they were the victors. And then they\nbrought in the orchestra, Wehrmacht orchestra, and they started playing in the\nsquare, in this medieval square, military marches. And they brought in the Orthodox\nrabbi, and tied him up to the roof of the wooden synagogue, and started a fire, and\nmade the elders run in to try to save him, and they all died right in front of my eyes.\nAnd this wa \u2014 I was 10 and a half years old.

I\nmean, my father knew that \u2014 was used to it, after a month. But for us, coming from\nthis idyllic place, it was just a \u2014 such a shock.

Fortunately, before the winter, we were able to get the glass back in\nthe windows, because it was a very hard winter, a very cold winter, and there was a\nshortage of fuel. It was very difficult, and the Germans started the terror\nimmediately. They arrested my father\u2019s boss, the president. They arrested my\nfather. They came to our house, and I was 10 and a half years old. I was playing on\nthe floor with my balsa ships. And I had German ships, and I had Polish ships.

My father \u2014 everybody\nthought at \u2014 til now that he was \u2014 died in a concentration camp. But he says that \u2014\nand th-this was examined by the Polish courts, and they pretty much decided that\u2019s\na true story. And I agree with it.

And th\nSeptember 25, 2014\n\u2014 he says that they took him to the park and he tried to escape, and he was shot.\nWell, he was executed, right in the middle of Warsaw. And then, he is buried\nsomewhere on that \u2014 on th-the outside of Warsaw, in a ess \u2014 what was then an SS\ncamp. And there\u2019s no way of finding the body. There\u2019s a memorial 1n \u2014 1-1-in the pr\n\u2014 Warsaw cemetery, but it \u2014 it\u2019s empty \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 because we never found the body.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. And there were all kinds of stories, that he was in Dachau, that he was\nkilled during the Warsaw uprising, that he was ki \u2014 li-like the head of the Polish\nunderground army, the General Groetravetski, and evidently it wasn\u2019t true. He was\nkilled right then in Warsaw.",
        "A: Beca-Because he reme \u2014 because in his statements to the Polish government \u2014\nand it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s lengthy, it\u2019s about 25 pages, he mentions coming and \u2014 and \u2014 and\ninterview to our house, few days after the city was taken over, and my sister and I\nwere the witnesses. And my sister remembers that the guy got sick, he got the cold,September 25, 2014\nor something, was throwing up downstairs. And asked for a glass of water, my\nmother made him some tea. So details like that, that he remembers how my father\nwas dressed, he remembers my playing with the things. And I remember him\nbecause of \u2014 of th \u2014 of th \u2014 I was so surprised that a Gestapo man would ask a\nquestion like that, in Polish.",
        "A: So \u2014so he \u2014 he is \u2014 he is a rare person. I think he is pretty much dying now, but\nbefore he died, I guess he wanted to get it off his shoulders.",
        "A: It\u2019s an amazing story. Amazing.",
        "A: And, of course, they haven\u2019t found the body, but this is the \u2014 my father spent his\nwhole lifetime, until he died, looking for his friend\u2019s body in Germany, and in \u2014\nand in German television, and \u2014 and nobody came up, and nobody knew anything\nabout it. There were all kinds of stories, you know, that people made up. But th-the\n\u2014 I think that \u2014 I believe that this is the story, because I remember this guy.",
        "A: Well, he \u2014 he was the translator, right.",
        "A: And he was told by the guys who shot Starzynski, that th-the \u2014 the less he\nknows, the better. They didn\u2019t want to give him the details, but they told him that he\nwas sh \u2014 that he was killed.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019ve got it in \u2014 at home.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Oh, he was given an order by Starzynski to continue taking care of the city, and\nof the people. He was elected by the underground Polish government. The Polish\ngovernment was in London, but Polish underground \u2014 underground was in\nWarsaw, and th-they made my father the successor to Starzynski. But the\nGermans, who needed to have the city operating well, and they didn\u2019t have the\nmanpower, because most of them were on \u2014 in the army. And they needed the city\nto be running properly. So they \u2014 th-they made my father the mayor.September 25, 2014\nBurgermeister was his title. So he was the president of \u2014 on the \u2014 from the Polish\ngovernment\u2019s side in London, and the underground government, but as far as the\nGermans were concerned, he was the Burgermeister. So some of the pole \u2014\ncitizens, of course, who had \u2014 who were not invol \u2014 who didn\u2019t know about the\nunderground, thought that my father was a collaborator. And that the whole city hall\nwas a collaborator. Then there were tens of thousands of individuals \u2014 it\u2019s a huge\ncity, million and a half \u20141n order to operate, that was a very big bureaucracy. And\nin order to run properly; the electricity, the transportation, the b \u2014 the schools, the\nwhole system. So th \u2014 and the fortunate thing for my father, and I think this is why\nhe was able to survive, although he was arrested three, four times by the Gestapo,\nbecause they have \u2014 they suspected that he was a member of the underground, and\nthat he was anti-German. But they \u2014 there was one individual, called Ludwig Leist,\nwho was with Hitler in the first World War, in the Bavarian regiment. He was a\nregular soldier like Hitler. But they got to know each other, and in \u2014 who in 1934 or\n\u00b035, joined the Nazi party and joined the Brownshirts. And sp \u2014 went up very\nquickly, although he didn\u2019t have any \u2014 much education, if any, became a general in\nthe essda \u2014 Sturmabteilung, SA. And he was trained to be the supervisor of\nWarsaw. His first job in Warsaw was to create the Jewish ghetto, before heSeptember 25, 2014\nbecame the so-called governor of the city. And he worked with \u2014 what\u2019s his name? I\nkeep on forgetting, sorry. Th-The head of the Jewish ghetto.",
        "A: Czerniakow.",
        "A: Adam Czerniakow was a good friend of my father\u2019s before the war. Adam\nCzerniakow was the se \u2014 in the Polish senate, and he was also a member of the city\nboard, so my father knew him very well. But before my father met Leist,\nCzerniakow worked with him for about nine months. And he was \u2014 everybody \u2014\nthe Germans were already furious with Leist, because Leist treated Czerniakow\nwell. He gave him a Mercedes and a driver. And he let him travel all over Warsaw,\nand treated him like a human being. And of course, the Germans were absolutely\nlivid, because he wasn\u2019t carrying out Hitler\u2019s policy towards Poles and towards\nJews. But eight months later, he was appointed the boss of ma \u2014 of the city hall. So-\ncalled stadtprasident.",
        "A: So if he were \u2014 he became the city president, and my father was the mayor be-\nbelow him, and the whole \u2014 a-above each of the city departments, there was a\nGerman. And some of them were \u2014 most of them were pretty horrible Nazis, butSeptember 25, 2014\nsince he had contacts with Hitler himself, he was able to overcome and save a lot of\npeople in the ghetto, and outside of the ghetto, as long as he was \u2014 before the ghetto\nbecame taken over completely by the SS, which was in 1940. From there on they \u2014\nthey closed up the ghetto, and neither Leist nor my father could do. But f-for the \u2014\nthe first year, the city hall was able to take care of everybody in \u2014 1n Warsaw,\ninside and outside of the wall.",
        "A: My father reported directly to Leist, but my father reported directly to the prime\nminister of Poland. So he had a \u2014 this horrible jewel \u2014 job \u2014 pole \u2014 publicly, he was\nreporting to a German, but on a daily basis, he was surrounded by three military \u2014\nPolish underground military intelligence agents, and was in c \u2014 daily contact with\nthe civilian and military underground facilities. So if he was able to gather\nintelligence, and pass it on, being an \u2014 himself an intelligence officer from the\nSoviet war, he knew how to do it, and he was able to maneuver it, and fortunately,\na-as \u2014 as I said, Leist was the one who saved many lives, including my father\u2019s and\nmy own. He got me out of the \u2014 from the train in Auschwitz. He got my father out\nof the Gestapo three times.\nSeptember 25, 2014",
        "A: No, I never met him, I never met him. After the war, he, together with other\nNazis, were before the Polish courts, denazification courts, and the surviving\nmembers of the ghetto, and of my father\u2019s administration defended Leist, and the\nother Nazis were hanged, but Leist was declared a Nazi, but not a criminal, and he\ngot a few years sentence, which he spent in Polish jail after the war, for belonging\nto a criminal organization, the Nazi party. He wrote his memoirs, and my father\nwrote his memoirs, and Czesrniak\u00e9w wrote his memoirs. So I\u2019ve got all of these,\nand I\u2019ve translated them into English.",
        "A: He was an end \u2014 it wa \u2014 he was referred to by the leaders of Warsaw as the\nprisoner of the city hall. Because he was a \u2014 he was a martyr, because he \u2014 he had to\nsave as many lives as possible, and provide as decent living conditions for \u2014 while \u2014\nCzerniak\u00e9w would come almost every week, to see my father. He was allowed to\nleave the ghetto and report to my father, and to Leist. And my father, at first, was\nvery suspicious of Leist, because he was a Nazi, and all Nazis were horrible,\ninhuman, and yet, this guy went \u2014 after Czerniakow left, and was described the\nconditions in the ghetto, he turned to my father, he said, poor people \u2014 about the\nJew \u2014 Polish Jews in the ghetto. And my father was taken aback. And there were aSeptember 25, 2014\nnumber of things that he did during the five years. He knew about the underground\narmy, he knew about the underground state, and he did not report it to the pole \u2014 to\nthe German authorities. And the German authorities were suspicious of him. In\n1943 \u2014 for \u2014 no, \u201944, after the attempt on Hitler\u2019s life, Fisher, who was Leist\u2019s\nsupervisor, was told to form a list of a hundred Nazis who was not loyal to Hitler.\nAnd he called Leist and told him \u2014 gave him the job to do it in Warsaw, to find\nhundred Germans \u2014 and there were tens of thousands of Germans living in Warsaw\nat the time, military and civilian, to form that list. And Leist said, well, I\u2019m sorry,\nbut I don\u2019t know anybody who is disloyal. And Fisher said, why don\u2019t you start\nwith your own name? So \u2014 and during the trial, after the war, Fisher tried to\npretend, to save his life, that he was \u2014 allowed Leist to be the good guy. Like \u2014\nwhich was not \u2014 which was a lie.",
        "A: So that was \u2014",
        "A: They were \u2014 well, Leist wa-was too. He was more afraid \u2014 Leist was more\nafraid of Gestapo than he was afraid of us, the underground army. And \u2014 and \u2014 and\n\u2014 and one \u2014 he used to go hunting outside of Warsaw with Fisher. And in 1943, theSeptember 25, 2014\nPolish underground courts passed a sentence on Fisher for the \u2014 death, for the\nmurder of the ghetto population, and the Polish population outside of the wall. And\nI was in the \u2014 at that time, in the unit, the commander unit, which executed the\nsentences of the Supreme Court, of the underground courts, on Nazi criminals. And\nthe sentence was passed upon Ludwig Fisher. Well, they were coming back and wi\n\u2014 we put up machine guns along the road, and as the Mercedes were passing, we\nshot Fisher\u2019s car. And unfortunately, these two guys changed cars, and Leist was\nthe \u2014 in the Fisher\u2019s car, and Leist just hit the floor, and when the car arrived in the\ncity hall, he called my father downstairs and he said, look how I\u2019ve been \u2014 for \u2014 for\nall the good things which I have done for the pole \u2014 Warsaw population, and they\nare trying to kill me. Why don\u2019t you get in touch with the underground and tell\nthem that I am a Polish friend, a friend of Poles. He said \u2014 my father said, of course,\nI will do it tomorrow \u2014 right away, if I knew how to do it. I\u2014 I have no contact with\nthe underground. But of course, he did contact the liaison officers, and they notified\nmy father next day, to tell him that the order was on Fisher, and not for him, and\nfor \u2014 never change the cars again. But it \u2014",
        "A: Oh, yes.September 25, 2014",
        "A: I been \u2014",
        "A: No, no, no. No, he \u2014 he \u2014 as a matter of fact, that\u2019s one of the reasons why he\ngave me away. I didn\u2019t live with \u2014 with \u2014 with my father and my parents during the\nwar.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Well, I was \u2014 right after the war, the Germans closed the schools. I had a lot of\nfree time, and from the time I was 10 to 12, I and a friend of mine went out, and we\nwould pick up the bombs which \u2014 small bombs which fell on the streets of\nWarsaw, that didn\u2019t explode. We\u2019d take them to the garage of my friend, and we\nwould take out the powder out of it. And so my father was worried that \u2014September 25, 2014",
        "A: \u2014I was going to get killed.",
        "A: And my father was being arrested at home by the Gestapo. So he was worried\nthat during the searches of the home, I would get him into trouble, or he would get\nme into trouble. So he got in touch with my pre-war scoutmaster, by the name of\nLudwig Burger(ph). He was also of Jewish background. I think he was a\nProtestant, but he was Ludwig Burger(ph). And I lived with him. And I wanted to\njoin the underground army when I was 12, so Ludwig came to my father for\npermission, because I was only 12 years old, and my father said, of course, y-you c\n\u2014 you can \u2014 you can join the army, so I was sworn into the Polish army at the age of\n12.",
        "A: And I lived with Ludwig, which was only about three blocks away, so from to\ntime I would drop in on the house, but basically I was \u2014 there was no school, and\nLudwig trained me as a soldier, and I was \u2014 Ludwig formed the first unit of the\nPolish underground army out of the boy scouts in Zoliborz. Most of them were\nolder than I, I was the youngest one. And at first I was just the runner, I was running\naround with secret contacts, to the ghetto and t-to other places in Warsaw. But later\nSeptember 25, 2014\non I became a f \u2014 at the age of 13, a year later, I became a regular soldier, and I was\ntrained in arms, and we had maneuvers outside of the city, and were trained as a\nregul \u2014 in order to prepare us for to \u2014 to fight.",
        "A: Oh, he knew \u2014 he heard about it, because my f\u2014 my friend lost his leg. I wasn\u2019t\nthere, but he was supposed to wait for me, but he got some nit \u2014 nitrogly-glycerin,\nand it exploded and the whole garage went up, and he lost a whole leg. So my father\nknew that I was \u2014 they were also trying out making bombs, and \u2014 and \u2014 and trying\nthem out in the parks, and so we \u2014 he was a-afraid that I was going to get killed, and\nhe had no time for the family. He was \u2014 he worked day and night at the city hall.\nJust drop in for food once in a while. And so he didn\u2019t have \u2014 th-there was no man\nto take care of the little boy. And he felt that Ludwig Burger(ph) would be an\nexcellent person to take hold of me.",
        "A: My mother didn\u2019t know anything about it. My mother was very upset after the\nwar, when the book came out, that he didn\u2019t \u2014 she didn\u2019t know anything about it.",
        "A: No. Well, I don\u2019t know if sh \u2014 I don\u2019t think she knew anything \u2014 she knew very\nmuch. She certainly didn\u2019t know that Ludwig Burger would sign me up as a\nsoldier in the underground army.",
        "A: Oh yes, yeah.",
        "A: But he was a boy scout master, and also, together with Ludwig, there were two\nyoung women, Steffan(ph) Solla(ph), and Alexandra(ph) Solla(ph) \u2014 Solkul(ph),\nwho were the daughters of a doctor who take care of my mother\u2019s father when he\nwas sick \u2014",
        "A: \u20141n Tarnow. Dr. Solkul(ph). So she knew them, and she kn \u2014 everybody knew\nLudwig Burger from before the war, because he was an actor, he was a very active\nyouth leader in the \u2014 in the boy scout movement. And wer \u2014",
        "A: He was of Jewish background, and so were the \u2014 the two girls, ot \u2014 all \u2014 all three\nof them were of Jewish background.",
        "A: Well, because they were \u2014 they were hiding. They were hiding, so my father\nreally handed me over to a Jewish family, basically. Only, as I said, the religion had\nno part in it. They were extremely patriotic, integrated Polish intellectuals, and th-\nthey \u2014 they \u2014 they lived \u2014 there was a little boy, Marek(ph), who is still alive, the\nson of Ludwig\u2019s, I saw him a month ago.",
        "A: And we keep in touch. And when I was being arrested by the Gestapo, he was\nplaying over the secret place where we had our \u2014 our arms. And he was only eight\nyears old at time. I was 13.",
        "A: Well, it all \u2014 it \u2014 well, in almost every house in Zoliborz that I know of, I mean,\ncertainly every other house, had a Jewish family being hidden, including our own\nhouse. My mother hid about nine members of the Jewish family between our house,\nand we \u2014 also, later on we had a house in the country. And she took care of \u2014 saved\na number of members of \u2014 Jews who were, you know, integrated, and were not\nPolish speaking, and who could survive in \u2014 in \u2014 in hiding.",
        "A: Yes, very much so. Just look at the picture.",
        "A: Well, he was six feet four inches tall, he was extremely handsome, and he was\nvery self-confident. He was a real leader, and bordering on the arrogant, you know.\nSo I don\u2019t think they \u2014 they would dared him, until they found out that they were\nlooking for him. And this is how I got caught, and \u2014 and \u2014 and Steffa(ph) were\narrested.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: They were looking for us. They were looking for Ludwig.",
        "A: Exactly. But th-th \u2014 he was a great hero in this part of Warsaw. He was known\nby everybody and loved by everybody, and nobody cared what he was \u2014 he had the\nJewish grandfather, or \u2014 or the grandmother, or whatever it was, you know, it was\nunimportant. He was \u2014September 25, 2014",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "A: Oh, I am sure \u2014 I am sure he had false papers. They di \u2014 all had false papers. All\nthree of them had false papers, in case of being ta \u2014 caught. But Burger(ph) could\nbe a Jewish \u2014 a German name, as well as Jewish.",
        "A: So, you know, it \u2014 I don\u2019t know what kind of papers. Maybe he had the\nVolksdeutsche papers, for all I know.",
        "A: I\u2014I me \u2014 he \u2014 the \u2014 that was height of conspiracy, and nobody was supposed to\nknow anything what the other person was doing.",
        "A: But I know that when I moved there, there was a little boy, kind of a poor boy\nthat lived in the \u2014 1n that apartment, and Ludwig gave me a job to try to test him\nwhether he was not going to report Ludwig to the police, whether it was for his\nactivities in the underground, or for being of Jewish background, I couldn\u2019t \u2014 ISeptember 25, 2014\ndidn\u2019t know at the time. But the point was that I was able to convince him to do\nthat, and Ludwig had him shot, as I \u2014 they di \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 he was \u2014 he was head of the c \u2014 the \u2014 the company of 150 soldiers, and at that\ntime the captain had the right of making a decision like that, legally, of a \u2014 a suspect\nwas enough to be killed, because he could bring so many deaths, if he was caught\nby the Germans.",
        "A: Well, I talked him into going to the police and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and selling Ludwig\nfor money. And it wasn\u2019t very difficult, he already had that idea, so I went and\nreported to Ludwig, and Ludwig had him shot.",
        "A: But you know, again, that was something that was \u2014 I was 12 years old at the\ntime, and I \u2014 I \u2014I-\u2014I only found out later that he was killed, and where he was\nkilled, by \u2014 by our execution squad. And I felt, of course, responsible for it.",
        "A: And there was a mother \u2014 grandmother living. And \u2014September 25, 2014",
        "A: Marek\u2019s(ph) mother was th \u2014 they were separated.",
        "A: And she \u2014 she got him after the war, after Ludwig was killed, but at that time, he\nwas live \u2014 for whatever reason, he was living with the father, and Alexandra(ph)\nSokol(ph) was the head of the international couriers section, women\u2019s courier, and\nthey were also responsible for \u2014 also attacks on German criminals. S-Steffa(ph),\nwho was the love of Ludwig\u2019s, and she was kind of his secretary, and did all of the\nsecretarial work for him, and did the h-home caring \u2014 help \u2014 cooking, and taking\ncare of the house.",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "A: She was his girlfriend, right.",
        "A: No, Iwas \u2014T?\u2019d \u2014T?\u2019d\u2014I-\u2014I-\u2014I was the \u2014 I had joined them at the age of 11, and\nin the same year, later that year, when I was 12, when I was sworn into the\nunderground army, 1941.\nSeptember 25, 2014",
        "A: Yes, it did. Well, everybody had to grow up, but \u2014 but basically we were brought\nup, the Germans made it very clear, that it was question of time, that they were\ngoing to kill us all. So it wasn\u2019t a question of whether we\u2019re gonna live or die, only\nwhen. And that made a whole mental attitude different. This is why we rose up in\n1944, that\u2019s how all our brothers in \u2014 in the Warsaw ghetto rose in 1943, because\nthey preferred \u2014 we preferred to die with our arms in hands, than going to the gas\nchambers. And it was a question of age. Both inside the ghetto, and outside of the\nghetto, the adults, the priests, the rabbis, would tell the kids not to stir things up, not\nto form in a resistance, not to resist, because that would make things worse. Well,\nwe knew better. We knew that we had to defend ourselves, we had to defend our\nfamilies. And \u2014 and it fon \u2014 it proved that the young people were right, and when I\nmeet now with American kids in high schools, I often am on their side, because\nwhen you are young, you are honest, you have \u2014 you are not spoiled, you \u2014 you\u2019ve\ngot certain inborn morals, and \u2014 and you know better than the parents, who are\nmore scared.",
        "A: Well, they don\u2019t want the children to die, exactly, but they \u2014 they don\u2019t realize\nthat you have to fight to save yourself.\nSeptember 25, 2014",
        "A: Yeah, but it\u2019s happening all over the world. Since I\u2019ve, as an international\narchitect, \u2019 ve worked in 30 countries. I\u2019ve worked in Arab countries, I\u2019ve been in\nIsrael many times, and I realize that in places which are dangerous, the kids grow\nup very fast, and there are many children soldiers \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 unfortunately, still today.",
        "A: So it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s true in Afghanistan, and in \u2014 in Iraq, in \u2014 in Jordan, and in \u2014\nand I \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2019m sure the I-Israeli kids are \u2014 are brought up in \u2014 in \u2014 in the same spirit\nof defending their homeland. So it \u2014 it \u2014 it\u2019s not something that you recommend, but\nwhen the Germans closed schools, and the only school was the military sc \u2014 career,\nyou grew up fast, and you grew up in a different way. And you mature faster. I\nmean, my \u2014 my \u2014 my chi\u2014I have some children who are \u2014 one of my sons is almostSeptember 25, 2014\n30. Well, he is what I was at 13. He\u2019s so far be-beyond, because of the easy life, no\nchallenges, and th-the parents and the schools don\u2019t expect \u2014 don\u2019t provide enough\nchallenges to these kids. I meet a lot with the boy scouts, the girl scouts, the high\nschool, the middle school kids, and I \u2014 I\u2014 I make friends with them immediately,\nand they \u2014 because I become that age, back, when I talk about my experiences. And\nI\u2014I-\u2014I-\u2014I\u2019m-I\u2019ve great respect for them, an-and some \u2014 and that\u2019s some\nwonderful young people. When I \u2014 when I hear about the \u2014 the \u2014 the education\nsystem being bad, there are always bad students and good students, but the good\nstudents are fantastic.",
        "A: Great kids.",
        "A: Well, first of all, he trained me t-to prepare me for arrest by the Gestapo \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and my torture. Sorry?",
        "A: Well, he did two things. He taught me how to fight when you don\u2019t have a gun.\nFight with your teeth, how do kill a person with a knife, or with your hands, and\nwith your teeth. That\u2019s how he died. He also prepared me how I should answer\nunder torture, about him, because he knew perfectly well that I would be the natural\none that the Gestapo would want to find him, through me. So he said, just say to the\nGestapo that you hated me. That I was a tyrant. I wouldn\u2019t let you have sex with\ngirls. I wouldn\u2019t let you have the freedom that you wanted to do, that you really\nhated me, and that you will collaborate with them in trying to find me. And also,\ndon\u2019t admit that you know any German, so you\u2019ll have a translator. So he prepare\nme very well for it, and it was very useful when I was taken to the torture chambers.",
        "A: Well, this was later. This was after \u2014 after Ludwig died.",
        "A: Th-Th-This was part of the \u2014 his unit became the division which was supporting\nthe general headquarters of the Polish underground army, called Baszta, the tower.\nBut after I was arrested, and they were following me, trying to find Ludwig, I had\nto leave, because I was burned. And I joined the commandoes 1n order to be able to\nSeptember 25, 2014\nreturn the \u2014 be able to kill some Germans right away. I couldn\u2019t wait for the\nuprising.",
        "A: But during \u2014 while I lived with Ludwig, I was \u2014 at first I was carrying secret\nmessages, and at one time he took me to the ghetto, which was an experience. I \u2014 I\nused to go to visit my girlfriend in the ghetto, but this was when the streetcar would\nstill be allowed to go. The \u2014 it wasn\u2019t allowed to stop inside the ghetto, but it went\nfrom one gate to the other, and I would jump off, see Zula(ph), and then jump back\non the \u2014 on this \u2014 on the streetcar, which was under the police guard.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no. No, Leist only had it a few months, it was still in the\nconstruction stages.",
        "A: He only had it about eight months, six or eight months.",
        "A: It was the \u2014 the planning stages, rather than the \u2014 even construction. No, no,\nbefore they \u2014 they had \u2014 eventual they had to redirect the streetcars around the wall.September 25, 2014\nBut at first, they went right straight through the \u2014 through \u2014 through the ghetto,\nbecause it was an integral part of the downtown.",
        "A: After the 1943 Warsaw uprising, I believe she was in the bunker with Annie\nLevitch(ph) and they committed suicide in the last days of the uprising. But I have\nno proof of it, it\u2019s just my conjecture, knowing her and her spirit, that she was in the\nunderground, inside the wall, the way I was in the underground outside the wall.\nBut in 1942, Ludwig took me for a two day visit into the ghetto, and he told me that\nhe was taking me so that if he got killed there, I would be able to take out the\ninformation from inside the ghetto. And I was wondering at the time, if he was\nkilled, why wouldn\u2019t I be killed, but I didn\u2019t say anything. Took the order. So we\nwent in, and we went through a secret underground passage through one of the\nbuildings, and we met some Polish Jewish underground members, who brought us\nsome dirty clothes, because we would be recognized right away in our outfits fromSeptember 25, 2014\nthe outside, so we put the rags on. And with \u2014 going to a place where Ludwig was\nmeeting the \u2014 some leaders of the Jewish underground \u2014",
        "A: Well, it was suddenly hell. There were dead people on the sidewalks, children.\nAnd then I saw a German hunting, shooting innocent people on the street, a\npregnant woman being kicked. It was just unbelievable. We had to hi \u2014 when he\nwas shooting, we had to hide in a doorway of a \u2014 of an apartment building. And\nthen we got there, and Ludwig was asked to transmit through the underground\ngovernment to London, the information what was happening to Warsaw Jews.",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 well, by that time, it was already tr-trainloads being taken to the gas chambers,\nand everybody knew what \u2014 my father told Czerniak\u00e9w what was happening, and\nCzerniakow committed suicide. But it \u2014 the \u2014 the wa \u2014 the west didn\u2019t do anything\nto help, and it was \u2014 there were desperate attempts. They asked to \u2014 the west to\ninform Germans that for every Polish Jewish life, there would be a German killed.\nPrisoners of war, and other German citizens. And they realized that it was an\nunrealistic request, but it was a desperate move to \u2014 to \u2014 to help. They asked to haveSeptember 25, 2014\nthe trains bombed on the way to Majdanek, to Auschwitz. And also, they asked us\nfor arm \u2014 for information how to build bunkers, for concrete, and reinforced steel,\nso they could prepare for the uprising, and for arms. I know that my own company\nsubmitted 50 \u2014 sold, or gave 50 guns to the Jewish fighters. And then, later on, I\nwas in the Warsaw fire brigade, and the Germans respected the Polish firemen,\nbecause they needed it, during the allied bombing of Warsaw, the Polish firemen\nwere very important, and the Polish blu \u2014 blue police, some of them were\n[indecipherable], some of them were members of the underground. So they\ncouldn\u2019t \u2014 you couldn\u2019t depend on the \u2014 but the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the firemen were under\n\u2014 according to German law, the police and the fire departments went under the\npolice, under the Gestapo, under the SS. So the \u2014 the guy who destroyed the ghetto\nand murdered innocent \u2014 destroyed the whole ghetto and the people inside, was\nStroop, Jiirgen Stroop. And he was responsible for the Polish fire department.\nAnd once a year there would be a parade of all the f-fire trucks, and firemen on it in\nthe, you know, firefighting uniforms, before him. And he was very proud of the\nPolish firemen. He didn\u2019t know that 80 percent of us were members of the\nunderground army.\nSeptember 25, 2014",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: Bunkers, and for arms.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Fifty pistols.",
        "A: And submach \u2014 yeah.",
        "A: That was later on.",
        "A: And th \u2014 we\u2019re able to use the fire department trucks, because the Germans\nwould | \u2014 of course, if there was a fire in the ghetto, they would let us in through the\n\u2014 through \u2014 through, and then we could drop the information, and come out.",
        "A: As a matter of fact, they \u2014 when I was in \u2014 1-in \u2014 in full fireman\u2019s uniform with\nmy helmet, and my \u2014 I was allowed to go thr \u2014 walk thro \u2014 in the city through the\nnight, after the police hour.",
        "A: And when we run into German patrols, Wehrmacht patrols, they would salute\nus, we would salute them. So they thought \u2014 it was a very good cover for the \u2014 for \u2014\nfor us to carry arms and \u2014 and \u2014 and attack Germans.",
        "A: No, no, I had nothing to do with that.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, th-th \u2014 as I said, the first time, I would just go to see Zula(ph).",
        "A: Well, because they were considered \u2014 everybody was considered Jewish up to\nthe third generation. If you had one grandfather who was Jewish, you were JewishSeptember 25, 2014\nas far as the Germans were concerned. That\u2019s how I was saying, that if the Germans\nknew that my father\u2019s grandmother was Jewish, he would have been considered Jew\nby the Nazis.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "A: Well, th-th \u2014 there were over, I would say, between hundred, and 140,000 Jews\nin Warsaw during \u2014 that survived. Either being hidden, or \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 outside the ghet \u2014 outside the ghetto, right.",
        "A: I mean, th-th \u2014 the reason all three of them \u2014 Ludwig was killed on the street, in\na fight with an SS man, Steffa(ph) ended up in Auschwitz after we were arrested.September 25, 2014\nAnd Ola(ph) committed suicide after she was arrested in the church with false\npapers and arms, and \u2014 and \u2014 and was tortured, and committed suicide, with a\nsuicide pill \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 cause we all had them, in case we couldn\u2019t stand the pain any more, we could\ncommit suicide. I had it in my ring.",
        "A: Yeah, I had a silver ring that \u2014 empty inside, and I had a cyanide capsule in it.\nWhen I was arrested, when I was 13.",
        "A: Not after the visit in \u00b042 with Ludwig Burger(ph).",
        "A: That was the last time.",
        "A: Last time.",
        "A: Well, I was invol \u2014 continued training, military training, maneuvers outside of\nthe city, learning about new arms, explosives. But soon after, in 1943, in the middle\nof the summer, there was a wedding of two Polish underground officers, in one of\nthe downtown churches. And there were about a hundred underground officers\nattending it, which is against all the rules of conspiracy, which they broke. And\nsomehow the Germans learned about it, and at the height of the marriage ceremony,\nthe SS entered the church, and arrested 89 people, and among them was Ola(ph)\nSolkul(ph), with whom I lived, with Steffa(ph), and Ludwig. And she had false\npapers, German papers under Evee(ph) Keller(ph), and guns. So, as soon as we\nfound out that she was arrested, Ludwig left the apartment and he told \u2014 send me\nhome to my parents, so only Steffa(ph) and Marek(ph), and the grandmother were\nleft. But about 10 days, two weeks later, we found out through our underground\nsources that Ola(ph) was tortured so badly that she committed suicide, and was \u2014\ndied, rather than tell the stories. So I felt I was safe, and in the morning I went backSeptember 25, 2014\nto the apartment. Ludwig stayed away, fortunately. Well, in the afternoon, I was in\nthe living room, and I heard banging on the front door, and Steffa(ph) said, who is\nit? And I heard, Gestapo, open the door, or I will shoot through. And I was on the\nfirst floor, and there was a balcony, and I was going to jump into the park, a public\npark, and escape. So I opened the doors, the French doors, and I look behind me,\nand the Gestapo man already had a machine gun pointed at me, and said\n[indecipherable]. So I had to surrender. He \u2014 I was arrested on the spot. They \u2014 th-\nthey check on the apartment. The little boy was playing over the secret safe where\nthe arms were kept. And so they took me and Steffa(ph), and took me downstairs,\nand there were open, big Mercedes cars, three of them, and they put \u2014 put us in, and\ntook us to the Pawiak prison.",
        "A: Pawiak prison was an old so \u2014 Russian prison in the center of Warsaw, a huge \u2014\nbuilt to take care of Polish par \u2014 freedom fighters of the 19\" century. The \u2014 the \u2014\nthis was a huge, huge \u2014 so huge prison. And th \u2014 there were double gate, and the\ncars went through the first gate, they closed the gate behind, and suddenly there\nwere all kinds of horrible German Shepherds that were trying to attack us, growling,\nand they were all fed on \u2014 on human flesh, on the prisoners\u2019 flesh, that they were\njust \u2014 1\u2014I-\u2014I-\u2014JI will never forget the sight of these dogs \u2014 and I love dogs, butSeptember 25, 2014\nthese were just wild animals, horrible. And then finally they opened the other gate,\ntook us in, and there they put us on one side of the room; the man, on the other side\nthe women, and I was standing, my face to the wall. And I tried to make contact\nwith Steffa(ph) across the room, I turned my head, and one of the Germans hit me\non the wall, and my nose started bleeding. So that was di \u2014 di \u2014 the first time I knew\nthat I was \u2014 lost my freedom. Then they took me, and took everything away from\nme, and shaved my head. And being a 13 year old, all I was worried about is, how\nam I going to go on dates? You know, instead of worrying about my life, I was\nworried about my hair. It just shows the mentality of a 13 year old. Then I was\nthrown into a cell, which was supposed to be for one person, and there were six of\nus altogether. It was jammed, and at night we had to sleep like sardines across the\nroom. In order to turn over, we had to all do it at the same time, because we just\nstuck, wall to wall. And then, in the middle of the night, you heard the executions\nsquads in th \u2014 in the outside, and the cries of the people being shot, and tortured.\nTh-There were all kind \u2014 poor food, hardly any food. We\u2019re allowed to the\nbathroom once a day only, for five minutes. So there was a bucket of uh \u2014 in the\ncorner, smelly. It was horrible. So, at \u2014 at \u2014",
        "A: I was the \u2014 definitely the youngest one. And for all the strange things, I was\nselected by the adults to be the one to be representative, because every morning the\ndoor opened, and I had to report, in German, that six prisoners, all here, everything\nin order. I was very short, and then I had the door slammed in my face. But, was the\nsame in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in a prisoner of war camp later. I don\u2019t know why, being the\nyoungest, they had the greatest faith in me, that I would be honest, about food,\ncutting bread, because \u2014",
        "A: The prisoners selected me, right, right.",
        "A: Very little, very little. Oh, I had this German nanny, but I didn\u2019t want to learn\nGerman, I hated her. But that was u \u2014 turned useful. I understood more then, than I\ncould speak. And I knew a few words. I knew enough to say that. And then, one\nday, I was taken for \u2014 to the Gestapo headquarters for examinations, for torture, and\nwe were in a prison van, and I was with Steffa(ph), and we were able to \u2014 finally to\nagree on the same story, so that each one of us would tell the same story about\nLudwig, and everything else. And that was the last time I saw her. From the \u2014 there,\nshe was sent to Auschwitz, where she survived the war, but she didn\u2019t know that\nLudwig was killed on the streets a few weeks later. So when she would \u2014 got to\nSeptember 25, 2014\nPoland, it was a shock, because the first thing she was looking forward to, was to\nsee Ludwig, whom she la \u2014 was crazy about. And when she found out he was dead,\nshe died soon after, a few years later.",
        "A: But I was taken, and put into a cage, which we \u2014 we called the streetcars,\nbecause it was a narrow room with about 16 so-called chairs, very uncomfortable,\nwooden bench. And we had to sit back to the main corridor, where the Gestapo men\nwalked back and forth. And this was the beginning of the torture, because at the end\nof the corridor were the torture chambers, and we could hear the cries of the\nprisoners being tortured. And then, they would put these people into the same room\nwith us. Women without breasts, with the eyes cut out, with the fingers pulled out.\nYou know, kind of inhuman. So you sat there for about 48 hours, without food,\nwithout all these thing, and then the German would playing \u2014 they had the radio,\nand they were playing the German tunes, and they were cooking steaks. So that the\n\u2014 this was all \u2014 you had all the senses, which were \u2014 were starved, after two weeks\nin the prison, and then two days with no food. And the music, the cries of the being\ntortured, the \u2014 a-a-and the \u2014 and the smell of the food, and the music were \u2014 that\ncompletely wrecked you, so by the time you \u2014 I was taken upstairs into one of the\nexamination rooms. They asked me if I speak German, I said no, I didn\u2019t know aSeptember 25, 2014\nword, so they had to have a translator. That was one thing that Ludwig prepared\nme, so that gave me a time to come out with a answer, a lie, while the translator was\ntranslating it. My father did the same thing, when he was arrested. And they \u2014 first,\nthey wanted to know my relationship with Ludwig, so I\u2014 1\u2014I-\u2014I mentioned all the\nthings, and I told them that I want to help them find him, because I hated him. And\nso they said, well, will you join us? I said, of course, anything to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to\nfind him. And then they gave me a book full of pictures of freedom fighters, a ba \u2014\nvery thick book, and made me look at each picture, and \u2014 to see if I recognized\nanybody. And I recognized one, and I said \u2014 and he said, who is it, where do you\nget it? I said, well, he\u2019s in my cell in Pawiak prison. When they knew I was making\nfun of them, I got really hit behind the head with the whip.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Well, because they \u2014 they \u2014 they th \u2014 they felt that I wasn\u2019t leading them to \u2014 to\n\u2014 to the underground, you know, that \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and I didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t. I just \u2014September 25, 2014",
        "A: \u2014 picked out somebody that I knew, but I did \u2014 there was a picture of Ola(ph),\nthere was a picture of Ludwig, and there were a picture of other members of \u2014 that I\nknew, that I didn\u2019t say anything. The \u2014 they \u2014 then they started beating me. Then\nafter beating, they again started talking me into it, that they fight \u2014 just lead them to\nLudwig, I will \u2014 I'll \u2014 Pll \u2014I can join the Gestapo, and I will be well off, and I\u2019m\nso young, it\u2019s a pity, and so it was bad guy and good guy routine. Then they made\nme look through the secret files, to see if I find something, that I would stop and be\ninterested. Which is amazing, because I was being ab \u2014 able to see all of the Polish\nand Jewish underground fighting organization they had the file \u2014 files on. But then\ntowards the evening after the \u2014 all this beating and \u2014 and \u2014 and starvation and\ntorture, they asked me where Ludwig worked. I said, well, he worked as a \u2014 taking\ncare of some gardens. So he \u2014 they put \u2014 took me to a map of the city, and they saw\na building in the middle of the gardens, and they says, what 1s it? I said, well, it\u2019s\njust a garden shed. But actually, we \u2014 Ludwig had a German car there, and some\narms. So they piled me up into the car, it was an evening. There were again two\nMercedes, open cars, with machine guns on the sides. And I remember we went\nthrough the center of Warsaw, it was a beautiful, sunny day. And I was bald, I was\nstarving, and I could see the human be \u2014 you know, the normal life. I almost felt\nSeptember 25, 2014\nlike cr-crying. And there were two ways to the garden, one was from the bottom,\nfrom the Vistula, and the one from the top. And I knew that if we came from the\ntop there was a gate, then whoever was there could escape. So we came up from the\ntop, and sure enough, the German car said p-o-l, polizei on the \u2014 on the \u2014 they\nrecognized right away as a Gestapo car. And by the time we got down\n[indecipherable] escaped. Ludwig wasn\u2019t there, but fortunately, he took everything\nout of that building before that.",
        "A: So then they took me back, and they had one more day of tortures, and then they\nsend me back to \u2014 back to Pawiak prison. And then, about two and a half weeks,\nthree weeks later, they were calling out names, those to be executed, those to be\nsent to Auschwitz, and I was on the list to the Auschwitz, so \u2014",
        "A: Oh, perfectly well.",
        "A: Everybody knew what Auschwitz was, it was a frightening name\n[indecipherable]. My Uncle Norbert was murdered there in the first year, in 1940.",
        "A: Well, they arrested all the Polish leaders of \u2014 the university professors, and \u2014 and\nleaders of parties, and he was the leader of the Polish Socialist party. So he was a\npublic figure, and \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and he was arrested th-the same time as my father. And \u2014",
        "A: Sorry \u2014 Barlicki.",
        "A: Barlicki, Norbert Barlicki. And my father was also arrested, and my father was\narrested for a different reason. During the siege of Warsaw in 1939, there was an\nAmerican photo reporter by the name of Julien Bryan, who came voluntarily three\ndays after the siege, and was taking pictures, movies. Most of these movies are right\nnow in this museum. They were bought by Holocaust Museum, and restored. And\nmy father took him around Warsaw, taking pictures. Well, a year later, somehow\nthe \u201cLife\u201d magazine, which Julien Bryan\u2019s pictures occurred, got to the city hall,\nand his secretary gave them a copy of this \u201cLife\u201d magazine. He \u2014",
        "A: My father brought it home and hid in the \u2014 in the laundry closet, which during\nthe next Gestapo search, they found the \u2014 the \u201cLife\u201d magazine, and they wereSeptember 25, 2014\nconvinced that my father was a American spy. So this time it was extremely serious,\nnot only that \u2014 that he might be a member of the Polish underground government,\nwhich he was, but that he was an American spy. So he was taken to Pawiak, and\nthrown together with Uncle Norbert. So they spent about two days in prison\ntogether, saying goodbye, and that was the last time my father saw Norbert.\nNorbert went to Auschwitz. He helped organize an underground there, and then he\nwas killed there. But my father was released after \u2014 oh, my father was taken to a\ntorture chamber too, and told to take all his clothes. He knew that he was going to\nbe beaten to death. And he was just in the process of taking off his pants, as a senior\nGestapo man passed through, and recognized my father. It was the same man that\narrested my father in 1939. So he knew that my father was the mayor of Warsaw,\nand he said to the guys there, don\u2019t beat him yet, wait. And my father knew that if \u2014\nonce they beat you up [indecipherable] they will never let you go \u2014 be alive,\nbecause you were a-at \u2014 they couldn\u2019t let you out on \u2014 on the streets in condition\nlike that. They didn't want people to know what they were doing. So that saved his\nlife, this time.",
        "A: Well, I guess he recog \u2014 realized that he was the mayor of Warsaw.September 25, 2014",
        "A: And they let him go.",
        "A: Because he was \u2014 he was too important for the Germans. The Germans didn\u2019t\nhave a way of running the city, and so my father had this unfortunate situation, that\nhe did \u2014 he [indecipherable] his best in a terrible situation, being a \u2014 a \u2014\nendangered by the Gestapo, and by the SS, and also by the communist underground,\nwho \u2014 who \u2014 which didn\u2019t know \u2014 they threw a bomb at his car while he was going\nto the city hall one day. And the under \u2014 Polish underground had to notify the\ncommunist underground that my father was a member of the underground\ngovernment, so to desist.

        "A: Well, the \u2014 evidently somebody in the city hall went over to Leist, and told them\nthat the mayor\u2019s son was being sent to Auschwitz. And my father refused to go and\nask for \u2014 for \u2014 for my life, because he felt that if he started asking for favors from\nthe Germans, he would really be a collaborator, and he would have to pay \u2014 pay the\nSeptember 25, 2014\nprice for it. But somebody, one of his directors, went to Leist, and Leist must have\ngotten in touch with Berlin, and Berlin ordered th-the Gestapo in Warsaw to let\nme go.",
        "A: But when the \u2014 when I was being released, I was sent up to the chief Gestapo\nman, who was Colonel Hann(ph), who was sitting be-behind a big desk, in a big\nroom, up on the same building where the torture chambers were. And he was under\nhuge painting of Hitler. Enormous painting, f-full \u2014 full wall size. And there was\nmy father and Leist and my father\u2019s translator, sitting back. I couldn\u2019t say hello to\nthem. They didn\u2019t turn around. But I got a lecture from the Major Hahn(ph), he\nsaid, I \u2014 I know you are a member of the underground. You were caught with \u2014 red-\nhanded, but General Leist says that you are only 14 years old, so we let you go. But\nnext time we catch you, the devil himself is not going to save you.",
        "A: So then I was released, but they followed me everywhere I went in Warsaw,\nbecause they thought that I would lead them to Ludwig. So \u2014",
        "A: I went to \u2014 to \u2014 to my parents, right, to my parents\u2019 house, but they thought that I\nwould lead them to \u2014 to Ludwig. So they send me to the country place outside ofSeptember 25, 2014\nWarsaw, where I spend about a month, and Ludwig came and visited us, and that\nwas the last time I saw him.",

There is a picture in the book of my mother\u2019s\nsister, younger sister Zosia(ph) who hid the Katz family, and Ludwig, supposedly\nwith a new haircut, but he was six feet four, so the change in outlook didn\u2019t \u2014 it was\njust question of time when he would be. And everybody begged him to leave the\ncity and go and fight in the woods with the partisans, but he was so involved with\nthe underground in Warsaw that he didn\u2019t go. And sure enough, he was caught in\none of the regular streetcar searches. They stopped the streetcar, and he and his\nsecond in command started running off, and the SS men were running behind himSeptember 25, 2014\nand shooting machine guns. And finally he got to a house with a garden, and he was\njumping over a fence, and one of the SS men got to him. He ran out of bullets, so\nthey started fighting hand to hand. And Ludwig tried to kill him by \u2014 the German,\nby biting his throat through, but another German came through and shot him point\nblank into the \u2014 so when I found out that he was killed there, I ran over there, and\nhis body was already removed, but his brain was still lying on \u2014 on \u2014 on \u2014 on\u2014 on \u2014\no-on \u2014 on the ground. And I just swore that I would revenge him, and every time I\nkilled a German during the uprising, I would say, it\u2019s for you. I loved that man.",
        "A: Oh, he was everything. He was my best friend, he was my teacher, he was my\nscoutmaster, he was my captain. He was the one who got me into the army, and\nwho \u2014 whose ideals \u2014 he was a great orator, and he knew Polish literature by heart.\nAnd he would \u2014 on every national holiday, he would line us up, all 150 in the\ncompany in a line, and would orate the poems of Mickiewicz and Stowacki and\nPolish \u2014 just to keep up the \u2014 our spirit, our national identity, and our love of\nfreedom. So he was feeding us the things which we as kids, needed most. Love of\nPoland.",
        "A: He is buried in the military sera \u2014 cemetery now, and every time I got to\nWarsaw, I go and lay some flowers on his grave.",
        "A: Yes, he was di \u2014 his body was taken to a pol \u2014 police \u2014 police barracks, and then\nthe \u2014 I guess they were buried somewhere, in a \u2014 the place, and after the war he was\nfound, and buried with military honors. He is a \u2014 he 1s \u2014 after I found out he was\nkilled, I and another boy spent the night tearing up the street signs on the street that\nwe lived \u2014 that he lived, was Karchanjeski(ph) street. Then we repainted it with his\npseudo names, and hanged them up, so we renamed the street in his honor.",
        "A: He had three; Mihau(ph) \u2014 Michael, Hardy(ph), and Goliut(ph).",
        "A: He had to change three times, in order to maintain his secrecy. The last one was\nGoliat(ph). And Goliat(ph) is the one that I took over after I was arrested. Before\nthat, it was Chernatski(ph), but I \u2014 I change it to Goliat(ph) in his honor.",
        "A: A little, a little. I think he knew. He went through it himself, so he knew\nperfectly well what I went through. It didn\u2019t take much. I talked a lot to LudwigSeptember 25, 2014\nwhen he came over and spent the night, in the country. He \u2014 all he wanted to know,\nwhat happened to Steffa(ph), and how she was. And he congratulated me for not\nspilling the beans under the torture. He pro \u2014 proposed me for a medal, and he was\njust proud of me.",
        "A: Well, after this, I was just so full of hate, and a desire for revenge on these\nbeasts, on the Germans, that killed my friends in the ghetto, and outside, that I went\nin search of wet \u2014 disarming German soldiers. And I and another guys were able to\nget some old guns. I had a old American western Colt, about this size. And we\nspent the whole night looking for Germans, individual Germans that we could catch\nand disarm, without killing them, because for every German, there were 20 to a\nhundred Poles, innocent civilians, shot on the same place. This mass\n[indecipherable]. And we find \u2014 in the morning, we found downtown, a\u2014a-\u2014a\nsergeant, a big sergeant, with a beautiful gun on his side, getting onto the front of\nthe streetcar, which was only Nur fiir Deutschen, only for Germans, and we\nfollowed him. But besides this sergeant, there were five other soldiers, regular\nsoldiers with rifles. And they all got off at the railroad station, the Danzig-Warsaw\nrailroad station, near Zoliborz. And we thought we would run down the steps, and\nhid under the viaduct, and disarm him before the other soldiers came down. Well,September 25, 2014\nwe faced him with both our guns, and said [indecipherable] or you are dead. And\nhe, instead of raising his hands, being a seasoned soldier, started opening up his\ngun, and pulling out. So it was a question us or them, and we both fired, and he fell\non his face. And he was the first German that I killed. And my initial reaction was,\nthey were supposed to be supermen, and yet they were human. You were able to kill\nthem. You know, as a 13 year old boy, I was \u2014 I \u2014 I was surprise. And then, of\ncourse, we saw the four guys coming towards us, about 20 feet ahead of us, and\nthey saw what was happening, so we started running. And they took the rifles off\nand started shooting at us, and we run up the embankment, and near the ghetto\nwalls, and by the ghetto walls we got to downtown. And then, on the way back,\nwe're told not to go through \u2014 near the station, because the German were arresting\npeople left and right. And next day they killed 20 women and children on that spot.\nThere is a sign, and every time I go there, I feel responsible for the death of these\npoor people.",
        "A: Yeah, for your whole life. It\u2019s \u2014 1t \u2014 and I mean, it wasn\u2019t my fault, it was a\nmatter of life and death, it was war, but the results were something that ver-very\ndeeply \u2014 first 1t was that boy, and now the 20 women and children. And it was after\nthat that my father send me to the countryside again, to try to hide me.September 25, 2014",
        "A: Well, then I \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014I was \u2014 the commandoes heard about my actions, and I was\nable to join them. And the commandoes had the advantage, that they were\nresponsible carrying out the \u2014 the death sentence on Poles who sold Jews to the\nGermans, who were traitorous, who were collaborators. A-And so, we had an\nopportunity to kill some Germans legally after that. It was, again, pretty horrible,\nbecause we had to go into their homes, sometimes kill the family, as well as the\nindividual, because they we \u2014 they were well armed, and they would defend\nthemselves during the execution.",
        "A: Then, we were all praying that there will be an uprising, and the commanders\nwere ordered in full, under arms, for 10 days before. And we\u2019re all, my whole unit,\nabout 14 of us were housed in my father\u2019s house. So my father, of course, knew\nevery day about it, that we\u2019re hidden there, fully armed. And they used to bring the\nfood, big cauldrons of soup once a day, for all of us. And we couldn\u2019t wait to have\nthe uprising. And then on the first of August, we got orders to go and retrieve arms\nfor the whole company, from our secret place. And we\u2019re carrying it across one of\nthe major streets, and the German car, because they were expecting something, saw\nus and started firing at us. So the Warsaw uprising was started by the six of us, bySeptember 25, 2014\naccident. It was supposed to start at five o\u2019clock in the afternoon, and this was two\no\u2019clock. So the Germans were able to bring tanks, and \u2014",

Then, after they left, there was one wounded, and\none killed, we had to go around, and get across another boulevard. And th \u2014 th-th-\nthere was a tank standing and machine-gunning us as we were jumping over. And\nthis was the first day of the uprising, that I got wounded. I got f \u2014 hit in my arm. It\nwas something that not incapacitated me, because on the other side, there were\nnurses. They took care of it, and I was able to continue fighting. Then that night, the\ncommandant of the \u2014 our section of \u2014 the Zoliborz section, decided that the\nGermans knew already about it, and they were winning, so we \u2014 he took us out into\nthe Kampinos forest, which was about 15 \u2014 20 miles outside of the city. We march\nall night. And then, while \u2014 the next day we got an order from the commandant of\nthe Warsaw, of the whole city, to return, and we had to return. On the return, we\nwere \u2014 we had to fight a very big battle with some German Luftwaffe near the\nairport, military airport, to get back to our own homes. And we lost quite a few. My\ncomma \u2014 commander was badly wounded, we had to leave him behind. And then\nwe got home, and the civilian population was very excited, and just like during the\nghetto uprising, the \u2014 the Jewish \u2014 Polish fighters raised the \u2014 the Jewish and Polish\nflags. The Polish flags were flying from every home, and we were welcomed, and \u2014September 25, 2014\nby the civilians, and they helped us build barricades. So we build the barricades,\nand we mounted the front lines, and the Germans \u2014 when the Germans started\nattacking, we would let them go behind our positions. They were stopped at the\nbarricades, and then they would get into fire from our buildings, and from behind\nthe barricade.

And this old guy that I captured, ges \u2014\nstarted kissing my feet, begging me not to shoot him. And I said, well, we do not\nshoot prisoners. But they knew that they shot us, because they didn\u2019t consider us\narmy, they considered us bandits. So wa \u2014 there was no way of surrendering.

And\nhe wanted Warsaw leveled to the ground, the way he leveled the ghetto, after the\nuprising. So the Germans came in and took the order, and in the first day, they\nkilled almost 100,000 innocent women, children, babies. It was a massacre. It was\nso bad that the German command had to stop it because they knew they would not\nwin the war, th-the battle, if they continued this spending the ammunition, and theSeptember 25, 2014\neffort of killing innocent people rather than fighting us. So that after that they\ncontinued in shooting people. And in \u2014 in the 63 days, every day they murdered the\nnumber of people that died in 9-11, in that building. That\u2019s 3,000 people a day, for\n63 days. It was medieval in \u2014 in extent. And then after, we had to surrender the \u2014\nthey continued leveling the city to the ground, the way that \u2014 so by the time the\nRussians came in the following year, they were \u2014 Warsaw was just a pile of bricks.",

So we lay in our house.\nBut when the German tanks started approaching, my father forced me to get out of\nbed, although I had huge fever, and I could hardly walk.

They didn\u2019t take prisoners, they were\nkilling them. Hospitals and everybody. So he took me there, and the whole city was\nin a flame.

It was an international camp. Just leave Poles and Russians\nand the Slavs behind, to be liberated by the Russian army. And th \u2014 it \u2014 the war was\nstill going on. I could never figure out how they were allowed to cross the line,\nbecause the line was on the Elb, and this was quite a f \u2014 halfway b \u2014 to Berlin. And\nevidently what happened was that the American army sent some parachute jumpers\nto jump \u2014 to jump into the camp, to prevent the Germans from murdering the\nprisoners of war before they are liberated. Well, they were all caught, and they were\nsent to the commanding officer, the German commanding officer. And they\nexplained to him that if he allows the American trucks to cross the line, they will \u2014\nthey can liberate all of the prisoners, and the German didn\u2019t want, obviously, toSeptember 25, 2014\nhave the western prisoners fall into Russian hands, the way that the western allies\ndidn\u2019t, so he agreed to it. And they were allowed to go through the German lines, all\nthe way to the camp, and arrive at the camp and started loading American prisoners.\nAnd I had made friends with a Polish-American from Chicago, and I was standing\nat the gate, the Germans didn\u2019t care, the gates were opened, and he kind of waved\nme in, and I couldn\u2019t walk, so they got me onto the truck.

And boys will be boys, they all had machine guns above the in \u2014 and I\nremember they stopped to shoot at a deer, and then they disarmed a couple of\nGerman officers in one of these little towns. We went about 75 - 80 miles an hour\nthrough these little, narrow, German towns. And we got to the other side of the\nriver. Well, they still carried me into the barracks, and the next day \u2014 we had about\ntwo, three days, and we started walking already. They carried me. And I \u2014 th-they\nwanted to take me as an American prisoner of war, and smuggle me to America,\nand I said no, I explained with my hands, because I didn\u2019t speak English, that I\nwanted to go to London. So they thought, oh, this kid is really crazy, he doesn\u2019t\nwant to go to America. But there were a couple of British Tommies walking by,\nand they explained that this guy \u2014 this kid want \u2014 was crazy, but he wants to go to\nLondon. So they took me under their arms, and took me to their camp. And thenSeptember 25, 2014\nthey had the problem because the \u2014 the following day, they \u2014 they were going to be\ninterviewed by the British intelligence, to make sure that people like me don\u2019t get\nthrough. So they decided to put me into one of their uniforms, which is a\n[indecipherable] uniform. And they gave me the name William Jones, and th \u2014\nand then they bandaged my throat, so that I was shot through and lost my voice.\nAnd that\u2019s the way they carried me through the colonels, and the generals who were\ninterviewed individually; each one of the prisoners was interviewed to make sure\nthat only the proper English prisoners got through. So the \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 they saw this poor guy that cou \u2014 kid that could stand by, that was a veteran of\na battle of now \u2014 in Africa, North Africa. And they saluted me, they passed me\nthrough. Then we got onto the trucks, and went to Belgium. And that wou \u2014 that\nwas the victory day, that was five days later, after my liberation, and we \u2014 we got\nclean there, and we got debug \u2014",
        "A: No, no, I that \u2014 there were no Poles, I was the only one who was among, so it\nwas just lang \u2014 little language, a little German and I was able to ex \u2014 we \u2014 we \u2014 we\nlearned how to get together without using the language. And it was victory parade,\nand roses being thrown at us. And we were deloused, because we were all full ofSeptember 25, 2014\nsickness, and I was \u2014 weighed 70 pounds; I was skin and bones, and I couldn\u2019t\nwalk. And that next day, they put us on liberators, and sent us to England. And \u2014",
        "A: Well, this was the \u2014 the victory day was the fifth of May \u2014 eighth of May, wasn\u2019t\nit? Eighth of May. I was escape on the third of May, it was Polish national holiday,\nConstitution day.",
        "A: And the eighth, five days later, was the \u2014 was when the Germany surrendered.\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying, that five days before, wi \u2014 they allowed American trucks\nthrough to show how the Germans didn\u2019t want \u2014 they rather surrender to the west,\nthan to the g \u2014 Russians.",
        "A: But of course the [indecipherable] of this young Englishmen, Scotsmen,\nIrishmen were singing all the way to Tipperary, they were happy, and they\u2019re\nsaying, when we get to Oxford there will be girls. They haven\u2019t seen women for\nyears, and they \u2014 they \u2014 they were very naughty, they \u2014 they said, well, you know,\nwhen you get there, there will be women \u2014 air force girls to meet you, and there will\nbe air marshal, and there will be a God save the king band, and you know, to thank\nfor liberation, and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and he said, it\u2019s only one short word. Well,September 25, 2014\nthey taught me that word, short, four letter word, and I got down \u2014 down the steps, I\nwas the first ones. And these two pretty girls, and I turn with a big smile, and repeat\nit. They drop me like on the tarmac, and these two \u2014 three guys were sitting there,\nand laughing their heads off.",
        "A: Sorry \u2014 F.",
        "A: What else?",
        "A: So the \u2014 but after that they took me to \u2014 to barrack, and I asked for a British\nintelligence officer, and I asked for asylum. And next day they send me by Red\nCross wagon, because I couldn\u2019t walk, to Scotland, where I was admitted into the\nPolish army in Britain.",
        "A: Right, no, no, no.",

        "A: \u2014 and th-there was a Polish army headquarters in Scotland.",
        "A: So that\u2019s where they send me, and I was inducted into the Polish army there.\nAnd \u2014",
        "A: Oh, I had no \u2014 no papers whatsoever. I had just filled in, so \u2014 I was able to fill in\nmy real age, and then I sent a cable to \u2014 to the embassy, to my father\u2019s \u2014 to my\nuncle, and I was released from the camp about a week later, and went to live with\nthem for a while.",
        "A: I sa\u2014I didn\u2019t see my parents for 15 years, and that\u2019s \u2014 I was 15 when I left, and I\ndidn\u2019t see them until I was 30.\n107September 25, 2014",
        "A: The first time I was doing some school buildings as an architect in Turkey, and I\nstopped by in Poland in 1960. So I left in 1944, and I didn\u2019t see them until 1960.",
        "A: But we had \u2014 they survive, and \u2014 and I was in constant letters. My almost weekly\nletters with my \u2014 my father. And I\u2019ve got all these letters, I\u2019ve just passed them on\nto the museum in Warsaw, where somebody is writing a \u2014 the bi \u2014 a biography of\nmy father. They\u2019re also building a moi \u2014 a \u2014 a memorial for him.",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "A: Well, first I \u2014 I was \u2014 I-I broke up my gun, rather than surrendering it, and then\nwe were marched off, and put on trucks and sent to a temporary camp outside of\nWarsaw. And I remember the Gestapo man going around the camp, looking like\nthey would like to murder us, but they were not allowed inside. And then they wereSeptember 25, 2014\nput \u2014 put on cattle train, and we were prisoners of the same tank regiment. It was a \u2014\nthe \u2014 now I can\u2019t remember it, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a elite German tank regiment\nand th-the general in charge of \u2014 give us a pep talk that how many tanks we have\nkilled, how many soldiers of his, what wonderful soldiers we were.",
        "A: In German, you know, he was being a \u2014 he was a ex-cavalry officer, and he\nknew that our Polish general from Olympic games in Berlin, and they were friends.\nSo he tried to be very straightforward, and \u2014 but he said, if we tried to escape from\nthe \u2014 the train, then we would, of course, be shot. And the \u2014 th \u2014 his \u2014 th-the \u2014 the \u2014\nthose German soldiers that were \u2014 that survived the battle, were going on home\nleave on the same train. So they were \u2014 th-they were our guards.",
        "A: They behaved very well, but I was dying and sick. I had \u2014 I just disgraced myself\nin-1n \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 1n the thing, and I\u2019m surprised that my \u2014 if they could they would\nhave thrown me out of that thing, was \u2014 I was so sick I couldn\u2019t sit, I couldn\u2019t \u2014 and\nI couldn\u2019t stand and there was no place to sit down. It was a cattle train, like the\nsame trains that they took people to gas chambers. And they wouldn\u2019t \u2014 I remember\nwe stopped in Berlin, there was a big allied air raid, and so that pleased us\nenormously. And then we got to the camp, and they didn\u2019t have any space, the campSeptember 25, 2014\nwas so full. And it was rainy, it was cold, it was wet. So I had to spend about two,\nthree nights on the ground.",
        "A: With the \u2014 raining on me, already sick. So I \u2014 I was pretty much dying when\nsome English nurse found me, and they took me to a TB hos \u2014 so-called hospital.\nAnd there were \u2014 we didn\u2019t have any beds, it was just the same wooden benches as\nin an \u2014 any other concentration camp, or prisoner of war camp. And the only\ndifference between concentration camp and \u2014 and a prison camp was that they tried\nto kill you with \u2014 by not feeding you. So it was starvation and hard work. They\nwould send you to coal mines and stone quarries, and you lasted about a week. But\nbecause I had TB, and I was dying, they didn\u2019t send me to \u2014 to work. And that\u2019s \u2014\nthat\u2019s how I survived. And once I got out of being sick, I went specially and \u2014 and \u2014\nand \u2014 to another barrack where they had certain diseases of skin, and I got it myself,\nso that \u2014 it was very unpleasant, very horrible, but that kept me from going to the \u2014\nto the \u2014 so I survived, but I was skin and bones at the end, and depressed, and I\nreally wanted to die there. But it \u2014 it was horrible.",
        "A: Military doctor.\n110September 25, 2014",
        "A: Well, there were two things, one was the physical. They didn\u2019t know how to take\ncare of escaped prisoners of war, and they put me on normal diet; egg, rich milk and\neverything. The result was that my body turned into huge carbuncles. I just couldn\u2019t\nabsorb rich food, and it almost killed me with the good, rich food. But th-the worst\nthing was the psychological. I had nightmares. I would keep on fighting in the\nmiddle of the night. I would end up standing up on the \u2014 my bed, and I threw the\nside lamp in the corner because I thought I was throwing grenades. And I wa \u2014 I\nwas in \u2014 in no condition to go into normal life, let alone any kind of education. So\nthe doctor suggested that I write down my memoirs, ma \u2014 in the form of a diary.\nAnd I sat down \u2014 I was very fortunately to be invited \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 I had very bad\nrelations with my uncle. My uncle was a member \u2014 was a completely different man\nfrom my father. He was 10 years younger, he never fought in any war, he was a\nvery comfortable, childless couple, lived for themselves, and just a real diplom \u2014 a\ner \u2014 diplomats [indecipherable]. So when I arrived, he blamed me for the Warsaw\nuprising. And I\u2019d lost my friends, my whole city, my whole family. And they\nwanted to adopt me. So, we didn\u2019t get along, but fortunately, there was a English\naristocrat, who was a member of parliament, a woman called Lady Ida Copeland,\n111September 25, 2014\nwho was a Member of Parliament, in 1935 visited Warsaw with a group of British\nMPs, and was entertained at the city hall by my father. So when the word got\nthrough the British government, that the son of the president of Warsaw arrived in\nsuch a terrible shape, she invited me into her palatial estate in Cornwall. And so I\nfound myself from hell, in heaven. I was met at \u2014 at Truro in \u2014 in Cornwall by a\nchauffeur with a Rolls Royce, and I was taken to the this gorgeous vi \u2014 house, right\non the waterfront, with hundreds of acres of land. It \u2014 the \u2014 the family was the\nCopeland china, the famous china. And she was very interested in Polish affairs.\nShe was a good friend of Ignacy Paderewski, and she put me in the same bedroom\nthat he had, with a view of the \u2014 0-o-of the \u2014 the ocean.",
        "A: Ignacy Paderewski was the great Polish pianist, and prime minister in the first\nWorld War.",
        "A: And \u2014",
        "A: Right.September 25, 2014",
        "A: I had no patience. I had no patience with other people\u2019s problems, because I\nthought they were un \u2014 completely ridiculous and unimportant, in comparison to\nwhat I went through, and what my friends, Zula(ph) and Ludwig and everybody\nelse went through. And when they complain about the weather, or complain about\nth-the clothes, or complain about anything, I had no patience, and I was very, very\ndifficult to live with for that reason. Because, after all, everybody\u2019s problems is a\nbig problem, but at that time I didn\u2019t realize. And 1-1-1-1t went through \u2014 at least\nthrough my first marriage, that I wasn\u2019t a very good husband. And I went through\nwhat now everybody recognize as the post traumatic \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 stress syndrome. But in those days nobody knew, so they almost killed me\nwith good food, and they almost \u2014 and didn\u2019t recognize my problems. But, I was\nlucky, because in \u2014 Lady Copeland became my fairy godmother. She not only \u2014\nwell, I\u2014 I \u2014 when IJ arrived there, I arrived in my battle dress, and my duffle bag.\nWhen I got to the bedroom, there was a black tie ready, and the regular clothes that\nshe bought, shoes. And every night we would dress for dinner. This was still \u2014 it\nwas a S\u2014 60 room house, and some beautiful antiques, and beautif \u2014 anten \u2014 and\n113\nSeptember 25, 2014\ninteresting people, and at breakfast I am a\u2014 we would just help ourselves, we had a\nbig buffet, and that\u2019s where I got all that rich food that almost killed me. But she \u2014\nin the afternoon \u2014 in \u2014 in the morning and early afternoon, I would write my story\ndown, and then she would take me for rides in ca \u2014 when she \u2014 and she was very\ninvolved in social life. And I always, always went with her in her Rolls Royce,\ndriving around. And I remember one day on the radio of the Rolls Royce came\nthrough information that Winston Churchill lost the elections, and she burst in\ntears, because she was very close friend of Churchill\u2019s. And that\u2019s the only time\nthat I was able to take her into my arms, the old lady, and try to cheer her up. But\nshe didn\u2019t \u2014 after I left and went back to London, she arranged to have me go and\nbe admitted to the top elite school in northern Ireland, the Eaton of northern\nIreland, and I spent a year and a half there, being a normal schoolboy.",
        "A: Well, the headmaster and the masters all knew my story, but on purpose they\ndidn\u2019t allow me to get involved with it. So I\u2014 I \u2014I was on the crew, I did all the\nsports, and I learned English, of course. I excelled in English literature. I had\nproblems in mathematics and \u2014 and \u2014 and physics, chemistry, but I was very good\nin history and in English. I was a top student. And then I got my Oxford and\nCambridge school certificate, and I had a choice of what I was going to become, a\n114September 25, 2014\nlawyer, doctor or architect. I wanted to be a brain surgeon, but in order to get into a\nmedi \u2014 school of medicine, you had to learn Latin, and I was just learning English,\nand that didn\u2019t appeal to me, so I decided to become an architect. And then I was\nadmitted to Oxford next year, and \u2014",
        "A: This was \u2014 well, I got there in 1945, I stayed through \u2014 I graduated in the end of\n1946 with Oxford and Cambridge school certificate. It was 1947 \u2014 1947 - \u00b048.",
        "A: That I entered Oxford for not quite a year. I was a very rebellious student still,\nand I didn\u2019t like the traditional curriculum, and I was thrown out because I was \u2014\ninstead of doing a house for a British ambassador in Athens, I was doing Frank\nLloyd Wright\u2019s house in Arizona. So I left, and then I got my visa and came to\nAmerica.",
        "A: Right.\n115\nSeptember 25, 2014",
        "A: Well, not only to college level, I never went to college. I went straight to \u2014",
        "A: No, to \u2014 went to the \u2014 the master\u2019s degree. I didn\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: The graduate school.",
        "A: Yeah, to graduate school. So I\u2014 I\u2014 I had kindergarten, two years, then I had a\nyear and a half high school, and then I went to graduate school. And my feeling 1s\nthat so many years are wasted 1-in college. Th-Th-Th \u2014 if \u2014 if the high school 1s at a\nhigh level \u2014 and the high school in \u2014 in England was excellent. It was at least\nsecond year of college, if not third. So that when I got to Yale, they \u2014 they wanted \u2014\noh, there\u2019s another funny story, if you want to hear about it. When I was still at\nOxford School of Architecture, I applied to three schools in America; to Harvard,\nYale, and another school. And Yale se \u2014 was the one who showed interest in me,\nbut they asked for a \u2014 the credit hours from Oxford. So I went to the dean of the\nschool of architecture in Oxford, and \u2014 Dr. Rice, and I said, well, here is the letter.\nCan you write a letter and tell them how many credit hours? And he said, what?\n116\nSeptember 25, 2014\nThese Americans are crazy. You know that you are here working seven days a\nweek, 12 hours a day. And he added it all up in seven hours, and I had more credit\nhours than \u2014 than a PhD. So when I got to Yale, they did \u2014 they wanted to put me in\nthe last year of graduate school.",
        "A: And I had to convince them that I didn\u2019t learn anything at Oxford. I insisted on\nrepeating the first year, and it was the best decision I made.",
        "A: But I was a scholarship student, I had the \u2014 I had no money, and \u2014",

And then, coming over on the Queen Mary, I\nmet an American girl, and a year later, I married her. So I became an American\n117September 25, 2014\ncitizen very quickly. And she \u2014 we were married through Yale graduate school, and\nhad children.",
        "A: Two.",
        "A: Why did I leave United Kingdom?",
        "A: Well, there was \u2014 I think one was an architectural reason. I didn\u2019t like traditional\narchitecture. I wanted to do modern architecture, and America beckoned, from\nlibrary and everything I saw, Frank Lloyd Wright and Louis Kahn and th-the\ngreat American architects were here. The second, I felt that I wanted to become a\nfull citizen of a country. I knew I couldn\u2019t go back to Poland because it was under\nRussian occupation. And I knew that I would have better chance of becoming\nAmerican than a British citizen. And \u2014 but my British friends felt that I was making\na big mistake, and they were very sorry to see me go, but \u2014 and when I arrived here,\nI realized how lucky I was in England. A, I was part of the elite, I had veterans\nbenefits, I \u2014 th-the government paid for my education at Oxford, and here I arrive\nwith five dollars in my pocket, and the \u2014 without knowing anybody. I \u2014 again, I\ncouldn\u2019t \u2014 I went to uncle, but we \u2014 we couldn\u2019t get along, so I left, and I arrived inSeptember 25, 2014\nBoston with five dollars in my pocket, I couldn\u2019t find work. I went to \u2014 tried to find\nwork as a ste-stevedore, and \u2014 a-and they laughed me off. So I was starving for\nabout a month. And finally, I got to Cape Cod, where my future wife lived, and I\nbecame a waiter. And I was trained, and then started saving money, and that paid\nfor the first year of Yale.",
        "A: Well, physically, if something doesn\u2019t kill you, it makes you stronger. You\nprobably know from the people who were in Siberia that didn\u2019t die, they \u2014 they\nbecame stronger. The climate, the conditions, and particularly during the growing\nup years, development years, physically, you become stronger. Also, having\nexperience all the difficulties, you become much stronger as a person, and you don\u2019t\nallow anything to keep you from your career goals. So I knew what I wanted to be,\nand I was able to do it, and to conquer all the difficulties.",
        "A: And I think it\u2019s all thanks \u2014 sorry?\n119September 25, 2014",
        "A: Mostly, yes. And \u2014 and I have kept it out by writing about it, by sharing this with\nother people, to prepare American kids for life. And I find that very satisfactory,\nand have a lot \u2014 made a lot of friends.",

        "A: Right.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, well, had \u2014 they had \u2014 that stands, but they had to sell it during the war,\nbecause my father\u2019s salary was so inadequate, it lasted only for five days of the\nmonth, the rest of the time my mother had to bring in food, and \u2014 and \u2014 and sell it\non the black market. So they \u2014 they had to \u2014 my mother had to sell all the jewelry,\nand they \u2014 finally, they had to sell the house, with the understanding that we could\nlive til the end of the war. But they used the money to pay off the \u2014 the debt on the\nhouse, and bought a si\u2014 a country house, where my mother had the garden.",
        "A: That\u2019s a very good question, and they\u2019re being asked all the time. Yes, my father\nwas offered ministerial positions in the communist government, which he refused.\nSo he lived in a very \u2014 in a workers\u2019 house, a tiny, little place, and \u2014 a-and \u2014 and in\nreal poverty. But he never, of course, joined the communists. So the \u2014 he was an\n121September 25, 2014\nenemy of the state. They knew about it. But fortunately, before the war, he was\ninvolved as vice-president, building a lot of workers\u2019 housing. And the socialists,\nwho were in the first communist government, remembered his contributions for\nsocial welfare to the people, and one of them became his protector. And he pi \u2014 not\nonly protected his life, but the whole family. So th \u2014 he did whatever he could, you\nknow.

You have to teach this to the children, so the history\nwouldn\u2019t repeat itself. And I\u2019m afraid history does repeat itself. We can see that in \u2014\nin what\u2019s happening in the world today. The middle \u2014 Middle East, Ukraine. And I\nthink that our children are being disadvantaged by not being educated properly\nabout the Holocaust, about the second World War, about the need to be on guard to\nsave your independence. Just because we had forefathers who fought in the\nrevolution, and made this country, doesn\u2019t mean that we have to lower our guard,\nand not defend it on a daily basis. And you have things happening, which shouldn\u2019t\nbe happening. People being hurt which shouldn\u2019t be hurt. And I think it\u2019s the \u2014 for\nexample, the scout movement, which I think 1s extremely important in training the\ncharacter of the young people, is being maligned. There\u2019s many high school kids,\nwho when they try to be patriotic, or \u2014 or \u2014 are being discouraged for \u2014 or \u2014 or even\nthrown out of school for carrying flags, or saying \u2014 believing in God, or in \u2014 in\u2014 in\n\u2014 in \u2014 1n things which are good, and higher, and which will prepare them for \u2014 and \u2014September 25, 2014\nan-and not spoiling the children. I think it\u2019s a terrible thing to \u2014 just because the\nparents have an easier life, they make it so easy for the children that they go and\nlook for satisfaction with drugs, and smoking and sex, and \u2014 and \u2014 and all kinds of\nbad things, because they lack ideology. And I think they\u2019re starved for the ideology.\nAnd I find that when I talk to the groups of young people, they are just starved for\nmy words, they \u2014 because they don\u2019t get it at home, they don\u2019t get it in school.",
        "A: For values which they are not getting, and they know that they should be getting.",
        "A: Yes. The \u2014 there is certain amount of the same thing, because since\nindependence, and the ones who were \u2014 never encountered German or Russian\noppression, don\u2019t fully appreciate it. On the other hand, I think there\u2019s still enough\nadults and teachers, who are teaching history, recent history. For example, when I\nwas there last month, I saw 100,000 young people doing a marathon on the day of\nthe Warsaw uprising. There were three days of festivities; theaters, plays, movies.\nThr-Three movies were made, enormous movies about the Warsaw uprising. So,\nthat\u2019s always kept \u2014 that, together with the solidarity movement and Walesa\n125\nSeptember 25, 2014\nhimself says that solidarity wouldn\u2019t exist, if 1t wasn\u2019t for the uprising. That the \u2014\nthe roots were in the fight for freedom and independence that we fought for in 1944.",
        "A: Well, according to Walesa, the spirit of Polish history is the 19\" century\nuprising. First ni \u2014 first the KoSciuszko uprising at the beginning of the 18\"\ncentury, 18 \u2014 19\" century, 1830, 1863, 1944. And then solidarity in 1979 \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 1980. So this was something which was passed from father to son, from the\ngrandfather to the grandson, and kept alive the will to live in freedom, and not be\nsatisfied to be a slave. And that\u2019s why Walesa says in his introduction in my new\nbook, that if it wasn\u2019t for our actions in 44, he feels that the solidarity movement\nwould not exist today, and Poland wouldn\u2019t be free. He makes that very direct \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 line \u2014 conja \u2014 and his own father was arrested, and died at the age of 33, so he\ndidn\u2019t know his father.",
        "A: Seventieth.\n126September 25, 2014",
        "A: Not many, but those mostly older and sicker, there are \u2014 a lot of in the\nwheelchairs. But the important thing was the way that the \u2014 today\u2019s citizens treated\nus veterans. Taxi drivers refused to take fees, restaurants were free. Hotels were\nfree. It was just making it \u2014 us feel that they owe us a debt of gratitude. And it was\nvery satisfying. And young people, the \u2014 for each one of us veterans, there was\nalways a boy scout or a girl scout that would take each one under the arms, take us\nto the seats, sit down and look after us, bring us water. So we were \u2014 we-were \u2014\nwere well looked after.",
        "A: Isn\u2019t it? Right.\n127September 25, 2014",
        "A: Well, thank you for having me, and I hope it will helpful in the future\ngenerations.",
