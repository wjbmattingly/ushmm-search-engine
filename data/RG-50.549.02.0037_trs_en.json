That\u2019s the coffee making in the background. The United States\nHolocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making\nthis interview possible. This is tape one, side A. Name here.",
        "Answer: Oh, name",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: [indecipherable] fax. I can give you my fax number today.",
        "Q: Okay great, terrific.",
        "A: Okay, [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Okay, thank you very much, thanks. Okay, I -- I\u2019m going to ask you questions that go\nall over the place. There\u2019s some things I\u2019m interested in from your previous interview\nand then --",
        "A: Sure, go ahead, go ahead.",
        "Q: -- from early [indecipherable]. Now, I -- I know you go by Jack Ahrens, but obviously\nyou weren\u2019t born Jack Ahrens.",
        "A: No, I was not born Jack Ahrens.",
        "Q: What was the name you were born with?",
        "A: I was born -- in Polish it was Yakob Aronczyk. A-r-o-n-c-z-y-k.",
        "Q: And when did you become Jack Ahrens?",
        "A: I became Jack Ahrens in 1955, when I became a ci -- when I applied for my\ncitizenship papers.",
        "Q: Why change your name?",
        "A: I cha -- My wife was a schoolteacher, and for a first or second grade tea -- kids call\nher Mrs. Aroncheck and try to spell it, 1t wo-wouldn\u2019t -- would have been rather difficult.\nAnd then, I didn\u2019t want my children to stand out of the crowd with a strange name. I\nwanted them more or less, be able to blend in, cause they knew immediate -- they knew\nhow to spell my last name and they knew how to pronounce it, but it helped them in\nschool, in later days, because they were just born at that time. My daughter was born in\n\u201853, my son was born in \u201856, so she wasn\u2019t -- he wasn\u2019t even born yet.",
        "Q: How did you pick Ahrens?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t remember exactly. I think it\u2019s more or less out of a telephone\nbook. We looked for the same, more or less, beginning, but -- I was married at the time,\nof course, and I did it in conjunction with my wife, and we sort of decided on it. She\ndidn\u2019t want A-r-o-n-s. In a way, she didn\u2019t want to give away that she was Jewish at the\ntime. Let them guess. Ahrens is a name that you have to guess.",
        "Q: Why was it important to her?",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t important. She was a schoolteacher, she was teaching in a private school at\nthe time and it was not a Jewish school. Maybe she would -- she just didn\u2019t want to --\npoint to herself that, I am Jewish. However, she was proud of being Jewish.",
        "Q: Was there still, in the early 50\u2019s, did you feel anti-Semitism?",
        "A: Yes, I did. That could be one of the hidden reasons. Maybe subconscious, or I don\u2019t\nknow, I never tried to analyze myself. We sort of looked at it for awhile, then we decided\nand we went along with it. And I have never regretted.",
        "Q: When sometimes you\u2019re in a deep sleep and you wake up from a dream or something,\nwho are you then?",
        "A: Iam Jack Ahrens. I have separated myself from my past, from the times when I was --\nhowever the friends, my friends, people that I grew up with, and surprisingly enough,\nthere is quite a number of them, still -- they accepted my last name, but they call me by\nmy nickname that I had since I was born, and that was Yasha. That\u2019s what they still call\nme.",
        "Q: Yasha. What did your wife call you?",
        "A: She called me Jack. Remember, she was American born.",
        "Q: When did you get married?",
        "A: \u00b0S1.",
        "Q: What was your wife\u2019s name?",
        "A: Selma Kaplan.",
        "Q: With a K ora C?",
        "A: Witha K.",
        "Q: How did you meet her?",
        "A: That is quite an interesting story. If I s -- go all the way to Adam and Eve, to the very\nbeginning, my mother was in the United States from 1934 to 1930 -- late \u201837. My father\ndied in \u201831. She remarried, and she married an American man. His name was Epstein.",
        "Q: First name?",
        "A: I don\u2019t even know his first name. I never me -- I -- I pa -- I think I met him when he\ncame to our town and he -- they met, but I don\u2019t remember him. She spent time in\nBrooklyn and she made friends with a woman by the name of Sarah Kaplan. Sarah\nKaplan was married to -- or rather, Sarah Kaplan was a -- the oldest sister in the Kaplan\nfamily. One of her brothers married my grandmother\u2019s sister. That\u2019s why my mother\nbecame friendly with Sarah. Sarah\u2019s father was the youngest brother 1n that family. So\nactually, when I came here, my mother introdu -- not introduced me, made me call her\nand arrange a blind date. And that\u2019s how the whole thing started. It\u2019s actually -- My\nmother was a shadchen -- th -- the -- the -- the matchmaker, at the time.",
        "Q: I -- I noticed in your tape you use a lot of Yiddish. Is this kind of a -- one of your\nmany languages that you --",
        "A: Used to be, or -- it\u2019s strange, but I ha -- I spoke many languages at one time, and I sort\nof forgot them. I regret it. I regret 1t deeply, but I cannot converse any more in Polish, I\ncannot converse in Russian. I -- I used to be able to converse in Italian. I have great\ndifficulty using these three languages, which I was fluent at one time.",
        "Q: Is that partly psychological?",
        "A: I think so. I think so. It\u2019s -- My problem was, when I came here -- and I came on a\nscholarship -- I was studying in Italy and I feel -- you\u2019Il find my history of studies, what I\nhave started in -- in 1940, under Stalin, in Lvov, then I went to school again in 1944, after\nbeing liberated. After the ghetto experiences and hiding, I sort of saved myself by going\nto school instead of being forced to go into the Russian army and become artillery meat. I\nhad no other, basically, I -- I had nothing in my background that would prepare me to ma\n-- for th -- 1-1-1 -- to survive, to make a living. My family was quite wealthy and they sort\nof isolated me from normal life. I was not in touch with business. The only thing I knew\nis more or less engineering and education. So I just kept going and I pursued the -- the\ncareer in engineering by going in Lvov and then being accepted in Turin, in Italy.",
        "Q: Why -- I-In your story, education is so central to everything. Why is education such a\ncompelling and defining source for you?",
        "A: This was my crutch for survival. That\u2019s what -- Basically, that\u2019s what helped me\nsurvive, also. In looking back, when we left my hometown Lida, in 1940, and went to\nLvov, the reason why we went to Lvov, there were two-fold reasons, basically. One, that\nmy mother and myself, we were able to get the Russian passports -- acceptable Russian\npassports. By that, meaning that our occupation -- my occupation became student and my\nmother\u2019s occupation becau -- became a working person, robotche. In spite the fact that\nwe were Capitalists, according to the definition of USSR at that time. The reason why we\npicked Lvov, because I wanted to go to Vilna. But Vilna had not polytechnic institute.\nAnd Vilna got separated from Lida, because at that time, they made a separate country\nout of Lithuania. That would have meant crossing a border and difficulty in getting in\ntouch with the family. So, we picked Lvov, where we could sort of disappear. Lvov,\nnormally a city of 150,000, at that time had maybe 300,000, with all the refugees coming\nfrom Krakow, from Warsaw. It was on the Russian side of the divided Poland, from the --\nafter \u201839. And I was able to -- I was accepted to the non -- the pothip -- to the Polytechnic\nInstitute. And that was my crutch, I figured I can -- I ha -- I have no other background -- I\nhave nothing in my background that will allow me to make a living. I had to be on my\nown. Fortunately, the Russians were offering scholarships. Top students were getting a --\nthe -- a -- it\u2019s not a scholarship, a stipend -- a living allowance and coupons where you\ncould buy things or you could purchase things. And I -- I have looked -- I have my -- the\nbooklet where they have entered my grades and I have never anything -- I never had\nanything below a B -- what you would call B in here. Fact, I don\u2019t think I had any B\u2019s, I\nhad all A\u2019s.",
        "Q: You said you kept it? You still have it?",
        "A: Not I kept it. I don\u2019t -- I have -- I have it, because when I came back in \u201844, it was\nstrange, but the Germans, during their occupations, they destroyed the Polish\nintelligentsia -- I mean, they killed the Polish professors. In fact, they did it before the\nkilled the Jews, they killed the Polish -- the Polish professors in Lvov. But the-they --\nLvov itself was not bombed, was not destroyed. So the archives of the Polytechnic\nInstitute remained intact. And that was the reason why I was accepted, because they had\neverything on file, including my photographs, I could not claim that I was someone else.\nAnd when they issued me the booklet where you enter the grades, they entered -- I s -- I\nstill have it. If you want to look at it, I can show it to you. You do want?",
        "Q: Yeah, I\u2019d love to see it.",
        "A: Hold on a minute.",
        "Q: Oh, my gosh.",
        "A: That\u2019s Lewovsky Polytechnic Institute. Here is the essa -- S -- SRSR, that\u2019s the\nSoviet. And this is the lukovok nishka, that\u2019s where they enter the grades. See Yakob\nAronczyk in here? There\u2019s my picture from 1944.",
        "Q: Very handsome.",
        "A: Thank you. I had hair. See, this was issued in \u201845. And they entered the grades from\n1940. Those stamps in here are because it was translated into Italian.",
        "Q: That\u2019s one of the lire stamps. Why was it [indecipherable]",
        "A: [ha -- [ha -- I\u2019m sorry. There is one good. Otherwise it\u2019s all excellent. See, this is\nfrom 1940 - 1941.",
        "Q: So when you went to Italy, it was translated then?",
        "A: They -- we -- in order to be accepted to -- in Turin, they had to -- they had to have a\ntranslation of that. This 1s \u201844 - \u201845. See, here are original signatures of the instructors, or\nprofessors.",
        "Q: Why, in all the moves that you\u2019ve made, did you keep this?",
        "A: I -- [had to save that. First of all, I had no reason why to hide it, wh -- after I got it. In\n\u201845, I could have identifications paper on me without being afraid that somebody c -- that\nPll -- it\u2019ll give me away. However, there were times where I -- where ID papers were\ncritical and I had to hide them. But I was never searched. See, here 1s \u201844 - \u201845, this is the\nend of it. You can see when I had the last tests. The six -- six 1n there, that\u2019s June, the\nsixth month. See they -- they use Roman numerals for the month, 16 is the day. This is\nsix, that\u2019s June, \u201845.",
        "Q: So you were 24 years old?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] from Turin.",
        "A: See it?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: The same one, and -- and this is \u201c45 - \u201846 - \u00b047. Where are they? I took so many exams\nat that time. Here. Just that. That was in \u201847, the last one was in ja -- 30th of January,\n1948.",
        "Q: And you came to this -- to the United States when?",
        "A: I came in February, in ninet -- 1948.",
        "Q: Why the US?",
        "A: My mother was in the US already. See, I have mentioned to you that my mother was\nmarried to an American citizen. However, she never became a citizen, because she had\nproperty in Poland and in order to hey -- to save the property, she had to be a Polish\ncitizen. When she came in 1938 to liquidate the property, the war broke up 1n thir --\nbroke out in \u201839. She had what she -- was called a re-entry permit for the United States,\nbut not a citizenship. She did not want to become a citizen because she was married to\ncitizen. So she had a re-entry permit, which was never honored by the Germans. She\nshowed it to them, it did not help. You\u2019re Jewish no matter what. It didn\u2019t do any good.\nYou\u2019re not an American citizen, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s what counted. But she went -- when --\nwhen we ended up, after th -- our odyssey, in Italy, she went to the American consul, I\nthink it was in Rome. And he said, I cannot honor it, because you\u2019Il come to the States,\nyou'll be a burden. Somebody has to send you an affidavit. If you -- you get an affidavit,\ntogether with a re-entry permit, you'll -- I\u2019ll issue you a -- a -- a permit -- a visa\nimmediate -- not a visa, an entry visa, immediately. She had some friends in here that she\n-- from before, they send her an affidavit and she left -- I\u2019m trying to think, it was late in\n\u201846, I think. In \u201846, or -- in the fall of 1946, she left for the United States and she was\nhere. In the meantime, I was able to enroll myself, the tur -- University of tur --\nPolytechnic Institute in Turin. And that was quite an odyssey also, cause Italian\nuniversities are quite strange. They don\u2019t accept you. In svite -- in spite the -- the fact that\nthey gave me credit for this -- for a -- the -- Lvov Polytechnic Institute, they would not\naccept me unless I could show them th -- my original high school diploma. Of course, I\ndidn\u2019t have it with me. The high school diploma was in Lvov. Lvov was in the Soviet\nUnion. There was absolutely no way how I could get it. And then, I never thought, when\nI left Lvov, to go to the bursar and ask him gave me my high school diploma. They\nwouldn\u2019t have given it to me anyway. I was able to find, through some friends, my last\nhigh school principal, from my home town. And because our graduating class was only\n30-odd people, he did remember me. He was an official in the Ministry of Education.\nAnd he send me a document, which looked more official -- he asked me, \u201cWhat kind of\ngrades do you want me to put on there?\u201d I said, \u201cPut whatever you want, I don\u2019t care, as\nlong as I have the diploma.\u201d He says, \u201cI know that you passed, but I don\u2019t remember the\ngrades.\u201d I said, \u201cPut anything you want.\u201d The document looked more official than the\nactual high school diploma. The matura in pol -- from Poland, that I have received it in --\nin \u201839, and I was the last graduating class b-before the war. And on that basis, I was\naccepted at the Turin Polytechnic Institute.",
        "Q: Did you speak Italian when you went?",
        "A: No. It was quite difficult. You had to study with that vocabulary, with the dictionary.\nPolish Italian on one side, and the -- and the text book on the other side. In spite the fact\nthat I was in Italy from late \u201c45 - \u201846 - \u201847, it\u2019s actually almost two and a half years, we\nwere always sort of separated from the Italian population. I was always with my friends,\nwith the -- with the displaced people. We lived for awhile in a Displaced Person camp,\nwhere Italian was of no use.",
        "Q: What languages were spoken in the camp?",
        "A: Any language you knew, anything. Polish was good, Russian was good. They -- I\nthink they refugees Esperanto. The -- The Yiddish. I think everybody spoke Yiddish,\nwith a different inclination, you know, the Polish Yiddish is one, the German Yiddish is\nanother and the armenik -- American Yiddish 1s a thi -- a-a-again different. But the\nYiddish was the universal language. And it ca -- and I felt sorry for myself, because I --\nwhen my mother was away in the United States, I lived with my grandparents. My\ngrandmother and my grandfather, they spoke of course Yiddish between themselves. But\nwhen it came to speak to me, they broke their tongue and they spoke Polish. Says, \u201cWe\ndon\u2019t want to corrupt your language. You\u2019re going to a Polish school, you speak Polish,\nsO you can -- you can be proficient in your school.\u201d That\u2019s why I -- Yiddish, I had relear -\n- learn Yiddish, actually. In spite the fact that I heard it all around me, I didn\u2019t use it. And\nbetween ourselves, my friends, we spoke Polish. My mother and father -- I was only 10\nyears old when my father died, they spoke Russian between themselves. And it\u2019s strange,\nbut my mother\u2019s friends, they spoke Russian between themselves also. The reason,\nbecause they grew up and they -- my mother was unusual for her generation. She had a\nhigh school diploma from Russia -- from Czarist Russia. And at that time, a high school\ndiploma for a woman, it\u2019s like a Master\u2019s degree in college now. She was a m-more\neducated than -- than her -- many of her friends.",
        "Q: What did you call your parents?",
        "A: Mother and Father.",
        "Q: But in Polish, or [indecipherable] Russian, what?",
        "A: Papa and Mama, as far as I -- as far as I can remember.",
        "Q: Did you speak to them in Russian or in Polish?",
        "A: Polish, Polish. I didn\u2019t speak Russian. Be -- I had a potential knowledge of Russian,\nbecause when you put the radio on -- we had a good radio -- of course television was not\nin existence, that we could listen to all of Europe, and Russia was right next door.\nEspecially, I -- I loved classical music at the time and the Russian orchestra known for\ntheir proficiency in classical music. They\u2019re still known. So I had the potential\nknowledge of Russian, but I never used it, until \u201839 - \u201840, when the Russians came in.\nRussians came to me sort of naturally. I had the knowledge stored in me and I just let it\nout. And what -- what gets me now, I still have it stored and I cannot let it out. It\u2019s sort of\nsomething is holding me back. I am missing the grammar, I am missing words. I cannot\nbuild a sentence, I can -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s very difficult. I cannot think in Russian.",
        "Q: Do you ever go to Brighton beach?",
        "A: Occasionally, occasionally. But I still -- I speak to them in English, I make them speak\nto me in Russian. I have -- They speak Russian to me and I speak English to them.\nMaybe because I hate failure. I can fail and I\u2019Il get stuck somewhere without being able\nto express myself.",
        "Q: Where does that come from?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You were an only child?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You seem, in -- in listening to your -- your previous interview, to have this incredible\nself awareness, all the time. You knew when to stop, when to start. You knew you could\nchallenge authority at certain times and get away with it. And you did it constantly, it\nseems like. You found the way around things, around people, around situations.",
        "A: You had to, that was the only way how to survive.",
        "Q: You think it has anything to do with your having been an only child?",
        "A: Maybe, I don\u2019t know. I never had any brothers or sister, I never had anybody that I\ncould basically share my thoughts and my -- to the fullest. Even my closest friend, my\nwife, at times didn\u2019t understand me and didn\u2019t know what was actually guiding me, what\nwas pushing me. Cause, remember, I came here in \u201848, with a minimum knowledge of\nEnglish. Absolutely minimum. And I -- all of a sudden, I became an upper junior at the\nUniversity of Illinois, living in an all American bo -- fra -- fraternity house with a bunch\nof spoiled -- basically spoiled kids.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to turn over the tape. Just a second.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning of Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This -- Tape one, side B, interview with Jack Ahrens. Why Illinois? Why did you --\nWhy did you go there?",
        "A: A friend of mine, at the time. We -- We know each other, but I haven\u2019t spoken to this\nman in 40 years. We exchange New Year\u2019s cards twice a year, for the Jewish New Year\nand for -- for Happy Holidays around Christmas time. We exchange cards and that\u2019s as\nfar as we go. We lived together in Turin. The American Jewish Distribution Committee\ncreated a student home in Turin, where we had, I think 40 - 50 students living there. In\nfact, we already -- we had -- think I had two reunions in -- here in the United States. I am\nin touch with some of the people that I met there, that we lived together. He was -- He\ncould have been more aggressive than I at the time, but he got in touch with the Hillel\nFoundation in Chicago.",
        "Q: How did he do that?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. Probably through somebody. He start writing to them and I remember\nthe woman\u2019s name, Marilyn Applebaum, and he was accepted to the Virginia Polytechnic\nInstitute. I said, \u201cLet me try, too.\u201d I started to write to Marilyn and through Hillel\nFoundation, I was accepted at the University of Illinois, the fraternity -- my fraternity,\nTau Delta Phi, gave me free room and board. The Hillel Foundation was paying to the\nuniversity for my -- the tuitions and books. And I think, if I remember right, they gave\nme something like 30 dollars every three months, allowance.",
        "Q: What language did you write to the Hillel people in?",
        "A: In English, with a vocabulary -- with a dictionary next to me, with great difficulty.\nBut, I seemed to -- I got through to her and I got the acceptance.",
        "Q: You know what you\u2019ve got? Chutzpah.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. I got even more chutzpah when I --",
        "Q: That\u2019s the clock?",
        "A: That\u2019s the clock.",
        "Q: And there\u2019re different bird -- bird sound for each hour?",
        "A: Differ-Different bird every hour. Different bird every hour. Doesn\u2019t last that long, but\nevery hour is a different bird. You\u2019ll have plenty of distractions, this is going to come off\nin me -- in -- in a minute.",
        "Q: I notice you\u2019re really into clocks.",
        "A: Key --",
        "Q: There\u2019s another clock over there, is that --",
        "A: Yeah, but that clock is going backwards, if you notice it.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah, I do.",
        "A: Can I pour you some coffee?",
        "Q: That\u2019d be lovely, thank you.",
        "A: Ah, you want a mug?",
        "Q: Fine. PII -- I'll turn off the tape recorder for a little bit. Why so many clocks?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. That one I built myself, this one I built myself. That\u2019s from a kit.",
        "Q: Time important to you?",
        "A: I love it I love building things. I build a robot, which -- which walks and talks, from a\nkit. That company, I -- I mean, that was my loss, it kit -- went out of business and that\nwas really my loss.",
        "Q: But I\u2019m curious about the clocks, why you would have -- we\u2019re in one room with\nthree clocks.",
        "A: I like to know what time it is.",
        "Q: Was there a point in your life when that was really, critically important?",
        "A: No. There was a po -- time in my life what I didn\u2019t know what time it was. I had a\nwristwatch and that\u2019s -- that\u2019s it, that at times wasn\u2019t working properly.",
        "Q: When was this?",
        "A: When we were hiding in the cellar. Time of -- was of no essence. Is just a matter of\nsurviving and especially when we were in a complete darkness for days.",
        "Q: That\u2019s -- from -- from your body right now, it seems like that is still very present for\nyou, that experience.",
        "A: I -- \u2019m going to tell you something that I had never told anyone else, basically. I\nmean, now, we are going off on a tangent, you were asking me some o -- some other\nthings, but we are going off on a -- on a tangent. When we were in hiding, and there were\n11 of us, there was one man, my mother\u2019s age, roughly. There was an older woman by\nherself. There was my mother and myself, that\u2019s four. And then there was a Hashidisha\nfamily of seven. One of the men, that man that was there, my mother\u2019s age, he had a gun\nand I had a gun. After the Pole was arrested -- the man that was hiding us, he -- the\nGermans -- I mean there was a trial and all that and supposedly they had to confiscate all\nof his property and the people -- the -- the -- th-the -- the -- the people that were actual --\nthat were removing the property from the basement and from the house, were the leftover\nJews from the Yanoffska concentration camp. Remember, that was already -- that was\nearly 1944. Ghetto was already liquidated, there was nothing in existence. In fact, I have\na book by -- I forgot his first name, Wells, Villigeker, where he describes -- he 1s -- he\nwas one of the people that was on Yanoffska Street at that time. He describes his\nexperiences and it\u2019s strange how he actually is telling me things that I -- that I -- that I\nhave lived through. When they were removing the properties, that man could not take it\nany more, and we had to let him out. He went on the outside and he perished. He must\nhave gotten caught. We survived. Now, the time when we were there, the experiences of\nhiding in that little hole and the relationship between the peoples, how we interacted, how\nwe behaved toward each other, I wanted to write a play or write a book. I never had --\nwhenever I thought about it, I never had enough words. I cou -- I could not describe it,\nbecause it was absolutely unbelievable how the children were -- had a pillow ready to\nsmother their old man because he was deaf and deaf people don\u2019t know how ca -- how\nloud they are. How the Germans were on one side of the wall and we were on the other\nside of the wall and we heard them hit and yell and -- and scream at the Jewish boys\nwhich were out there. We -- We assumed they were Jewish boys, cause we never saw\nthem. And it\u2019s strange how the box that was hiding the entrance, to-together with that\npole I have pa -- we have painted bricks on it, so it looked like bricks, that nobody\nnoticed it? Or maybe somebody noticed it and deliberately ignored it to save our lives.\nWe ne -- There are so many conflicts in there, so many possibilities, what actually\nhappened? There -- I'll never know, and it\u2019s bothering me. I -- It\u2019s in my subconscious,\nbut I still try to put it out -- out of my mind, because if you ask me the names of the\npeople that were there, I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t remember their last name, and I don\u2019t\nremember their first names. The man that got out, he was fr-from our hometown. Him, I\nremember, because I remember him from before. But otherwise, the names -- it\u2019s sort of\nfu-fuzzy in my mind. The details are there, I can visualize it, but I don\u2019t feel that I have\nenough words to describe it. Now, to go back to my chutzpah. When I went to the consul\n-- to the American consul in Genoa, cause from Turin, you had to go to Genoa, and I\nshowed them that I was accepted at the University of Illinois and that was beginning of\nFebruary, of \u201848. He says to me, \u201cWhen does the semester start?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\nthey accepted me.\u201d\u2019 He made some quick checks, he says, \u201cYou know, the semester has\nalready started. If you go by boat, you have no reservations, you have no -- no way how\nto get there for at least a month. I will not give you the visa now.\u201d So I asked him, \u201cWhat\nabout if I fly?\u201d He said, \u201cDll give you the visa immediately.\u201d So I went back to the AJDC\nand I said to them, \u201cI have a commitment from the American consul.\u201d",
        "Q: AJDC is?",
        "A: American Joint Distribution Committee. They were that th -- They were the ones that\nwere running the student home in Turin, and they paid for my flight on TWA, February\n15th, from Rome to Geneva. From Geneva to Shannon, Ireland. From Shannon, Ireland,\nto Newfoundland, Canada. From Newfoundland to New York.",
        "Q: How long did this take?",
        "A: I think it\u2019s all within, I think 14 hours or 18 hours or something, but there were stops,\nbecause there were propeller planes, jets were not in existence, I -- at the time.",
        "Q: What were your feelings when you were on that plane?",
        "A: I was afraid. I was scared what\u2019s going to happen. Will I be able to cope with an\nAmerican university? After all, my scholastic background was partly Polish, partly\nRussian, partly Ukrainian, partly Italian. Now here, I have to translate everything into\nEnglish. I didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to me. When I came to New York, in\n1948, it was Friday -- late Friday afternoon. Immigration wouldn\u2019t let me out. They said,\n\u201cSo many Jewish students, so many people are coming here on scholarships, we have to\ncheck with the university, is it true or not.\u201d They called -- I said, \u201cCall them.\u201d They called\nthem, and Friday afternoon, the offices were closed. I spend Saturday -- my mother was\nwaiting for me at the airport and that was the LaGuardia, because Kennedy was not in\nexistence. Idlewild. I said hello to her an-and I says, \u201cIll be back.\u201d What else? The\nimmigration inspector said to me, \u201cI have to take you to Ellis Island and -- but before you\ngo, I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to let you stay here or not. I have a taxi here, you are\nalone, let me give you a tour of New York.\u201d So we went riding around New York, he\nshowed me -- and the Empire State Building, and the thing that really stuck in my mind\nwas the Fulton Fish Market. Like a major attraction in New York at the time. I spent on\nEllis Island, Saturday and Sunday. Monday morning they called University of Illinois and\nthey apologized to me and they let me out. I stood with my mother for two weeks in New\nYork. I didn\u2019t go right away. What\u2019s the hurry? I wanted to see New York, I wanted to\nspend time with her.",
        "Q: How long had it been since you\u2019d seen your mother?",
        "A: At that time, about a year and a half.",
        "Q: What was it like to see her again, here, in this country?",
        "A: In a way, I was disappointed. I was disappointed because that -- she was -- the kind of\nwork she was doing.",
        "Q: What was she doing?",
        "A: She was a waitress at the resorts and -- in the Catskills. She had no professions. She\nspoke the language, but not that well that she could have an office job. She was a middle-\naged woman. She was -- She was in her early 40\u2019s. My mother was exactly about 20\nyears older than I am. That was the only thing that she could do and actually make a\ndecent living out of it. Her husband died, in the meantime, while she was in -- in Poland,\nhe died here. And his family sort of disappeared, they -- th-they disowned her and th-they\ndidn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t want to know about her, nothing. I mean, she was completely on her\nbu -- on her own, by herself, with -- the only friend that she had was that woman that I\nmentioned before, that Sarah k -- Sarah Kaplan, that was the wife of a -- of a relative and\nso on. It\u2019s not a relative, I don\u2019t know. She was the only -- She was the only friend that\nshe had at the time.",
        "Q: Where was your mother living?",
        "A: My mother had an apartment together with her sister and her sister\u2019s husband. That\u2019s\nanother pa -- That\u2019s another interesting story. My mother had -- What\u2019d they have? Two\nbrothers and two sisters. There were five of them. In fact, just about a month ago, they\ncalled me from Israel that my uncle has pa -- had died, at 93 or 94. He left for Palestine in\nthe -- in \u201828, I think, or \u201827. 1927. He was one of the original Halitseem, [indecipherable]\nPalestine.",
        "Q: Did you ever want to go to Palestine, or [indecipherable] Israel?",
        "A: Yes, I did. However, I wanted to go there after I got -- after I have gotten some sort of\na profession. To come there without any skills, without knowing the language -- the\nHebrew -- I mean, I have the basic knowledge of Hebrew. You know, when they -- you\nget prepared for Bar Mitzvah, I had a -- I -- I -- someone teach me, and -- but I never\nwent to -- to the Hebrew school. There was a Hebrew school in my town, Talbud. I never\nwent to the Hebrew school. So I never -- I was never prepared for Palestine.",
        "Q: Well, as I recall, you could at least ask the four questions and pretended it was Greek.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes. We -- That\u2019s another pa -- another story, but her sister and her hus --\nher husband, the sister\u2019s husband and the sister, they were sort of distant cousins. To\nmarry, they had to get a permission from a rabbi, because they were relat -- they never\nhad any -- they never had any children anyway, so it didn\u2019t matter. He was a chemical\nengineer, a very able chemical engineer, who built one of the major rubber factories in\nPoland and got pushed out by other people who sort of took it over. Then he went abroad\nand built a factory, I think, a rubber factory in Greece, a rubber factory in France. He had\na French ler -- French degree, a degree from Toulouse, I think. Eventually, he settled in\nmy -- on our hometown, and he and -- with his brother, made -- b-built a factory where\nthey used to make rubber heels for shoes. In spite the fact that factory was small and\nbasically the two of -- I don\u2019t know how many they employed, but owning a factory\nmade them Capitalists. So when the Russians came in, the thing got nationalized and they\nhad to escape. They went to Vilna and they were one of the 8,000 that got the visas from\nthe Japanese c-consul in Kovno. I think you heard of -- I forgot his name. They ended up\nin Japan, in -- rather in Shanghai, but because they were skilled -- they were both\nengineers, Canada accepted them. So they ended up in \u201840 -- in the early 40\u2019s, they ended\nup in Canada. From Canada, they came to the States. My aunt was left in Lida to\nliquidate the property. She was selling whatev -- whatever they had 1n the -- in the house.\nThe furniture, the clothe -- pardon me, the clothing, and all the other things. So then\nwhen they -- Russia closed the border with Lithuania, they had to cross the border to go\ninto Vilna. The husband was still there and she and a number of other peoples got caught\non the border -- the border, arrested by the KGB. Within two days or three days, there\nwas a trial and they were sentenced to deportation to Kazakstan, which 1n a -- the long\nrun, saved her life. In fact, his father -- my uncle\u2019s father -- father was arrested not at the\nsame time, but arrested also and sent to the same area of Kazakstan, and my aunt was\nthere with his fa -- with her father-in-law, who died there. But when she was in -- when\nshe was in -- in Kazakstan, she survived the war over there and in \u201845, she came to Lvov.\nFrom Lvov, she was able to go, somehow, to France or I don\u2019t know, I -- I -- I don\u2019t\nremember the details of her story, but she ended up in the United States, because her\nhusband was here, before my mother came there. They had an apartment on Newkirk\nAvenue, in a building which is basically -- last time I saw it, it was abandoned. It was a\nfour story walk-up. Newkirk and East 21st Street. And my mother got a room out there,\nwith them. I think 1t was a two bedroom or a three bedroom apartment, on the top floor.",
        "Q: So that\u2019s where you stayed with her?",
        "A: That\u2019s where I stood with her, right. For the couple of weeks. Then I went to the\nUniversity of Illinois. I was with the -- in the fraternity.",
        "Q: Yeah, I want to -- I want to stop for a second, cause you\u2019re going very fast through all",
        "A: Go ahead.",
        "Q: -- a whole lot of stuff. Okay, you -- your -- on this endless, seemingly -- sounding, at\nleast, endless airplane ride to the United States, what did you expect to find here?",
        "A: I was looking to get away from the uncertainty -- uncertainty, to start building my life,\nto get some sort of a profession where I could -- where I know if I cannot do it -- if I\ncannot work for myself -- be on my own, is work for someone in a productive capacity.\nMy father was an engineer. He -- An engineer basically without money. But he had the\nskills. The family put up the money, he was running the foundry that they had. He made a\n-- I loved to go there and watch how they melted the iron, how they cast the -- the -- the -\n- the plows and the -- the agricultural -- the equipment that they were building there, how\nthey machined it, what -- e-everything they did. And I was only a little baby at the time,\nbut I loved to watch it. That sort of instilled in me, the a -- the -- the -- the love for\nengineering, love for being able to create something with your own hands. That\u2019s why I\nput so many things together.",
        "Q: Including that crystal radio when you were in hiding.",
        "A: That was a lifesaver, because it gave it gave us a lot of information.",
        "Q: Do you still listen to the radio?",
        "A: Yes, I do. I have a short-wave radio, which I listen to -- I like to scan the world to\nlisten what the world thinks about us.",
        "Q: When you say us, who do you mean?",
        "A: Us? I consider us Americans. I consider myself now as a full pledged citizen of this\ncountry, with some loyalties maybe stretching far. I support Israel, but I am not one of\nthose that will say that because Israeli want it, it\u2019s foolproof and it has to be that way. I\nlove to read -- on the internet, I read the Israeli papers. The Haaretz and the Jerusalem\nPost. I look at them every single day. I have a computer in the other room, gift from my\nson. I don\u2019t know how he became so proficient in computers, but he must have six of\nthem in his house. In fact, when I have a problem, I call my youngest granddaughter to\ntell me. At eight, she knows more than I do.",
        "Q: Okay, so we were talking about -- I\u2019m going to change the tape in a minute, again --\nyour -- f -- what -- I asked you what you felt on that plane ride and you told me what\nyour career goal was, but not how you felt.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember how I felt. I felt sort of liberated. If I got out of this, that I am going\nsomewhere. I did not see any future studying, finishing my engineering career in Italy. It\nwas sort of you gi -- you get a degree and what do you do with it afterwards? You are\nsort of -- it\u2019s like a dead end education. I could not see myself competing with Italians in\n-- even in my profession. I had to get out somewhere where I could have more freedom. I\nhad -- my knowledge of Italian was basically small. It was -- I could converse, but I was\nnot fluent in it. I's -- I didn\u2019t come to a point where I was thinking in Italian. Because in\norder to be fluent in a language, you have to think in that language.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to change the tape now.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: Jack Ahrens interview, tape two, side A.",
        "A: It\u2019s difficult with -- to answer what wa -- what was I thinking about at the time. I sort\nof felt relieved that I am getting out from there, cause I was fu -- looking toward future\nsomething. I know in America you can -- it\u2019s a goldeneh medina. Sort of, y-you can do\nsomething. Where, out there, what would I do?",
        "Q: Other than the material goals and your occupational goals, did you feel that you would\nexperience less anti-Semitism, that you would be more accepted? That your past\nwouldn\u2019t exist, any of that kind of thing?",
        "A: I did not experience any anti-Semitism in Italy. Maybe because I didn\u2019t know who\nwas Jewish and who was not. It came to a point where I was so stupid that I was talking\nto someone whose last name was -- I remember now, Suchadotti and I asked him, \u201cAre\nyou Jewish?\u201d He says, \u201cOf course.\u201d I didn\u2019t realize that Suchadotti in Italian, is Cohen in\nEnglish, or Kaplan, or -- there are certain names that imply who you are, and I was so\nignorant, I didn\u2019t even know that. And then, again, I was in a circle with people who\nwere of my own background, who were in Italy temporarily. It was sort of like a weigh\nstation. You were there for the next year, two, three, four, but no one actually was\nplanning on settling and staying in Italy.",
        "Q: What was life like in the DP camps?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t live that long in a DP camp.",
        "Q: How long were you in a camp?",
        "A: In Italy, in a DP camp, maybe a half a year.",
        "Q: How did you come to be there?",
        "A: When we were tra -- when we left Lodz, we were traveling with so-called Bricha.\nBricha was the underground, Jewish organization that was guiding Jews out of Poland,\nout of -- with the goal of sending them to Palestine. So you had to go to an area -- they\nwere sending them into Displaced Person camps in Germany, around Munich, Salzburg,\nin Austria or Italy, with the idea of having these people available to col -- to -- to send to\nPalestine whenever things became possible. That\u2019s when Exodus started, the ship. In fact,\nmany of the people that I knew ended up on Cyprus, because they were caught.",
        "Q: How did you connect with Bricha?",
        "A: You just knew it, you just knew it, that\u2019s all. One of the people that was -- one of the\nmen who was stationed at that time in Prague, lives in New York now and we went --\nthrough him -- he was a man -- he was a -- from my hometown, so I knew him. And\nthat\u2019s where 1t came 1n with the different papers, with the different nationalities that we\nwere impersonating at the time, to confuse the border guards, to show -- they -- I am sure\nthey knew about it, but they had to have the legal papers to allow us to travel. After all, it\nwas such a drop in the bucket, of people that were traveling, of displaced people that\nwere moving. Just didn\u2019t mean anything. I -- I remember when we were stopped, I think\nit was in Salzburg and Innsbruck, our tr -- we were on a train, traveling -- we were\ntraveling in the direction of Italy and there was an American train traveling in the\nopposite direction, with American soldiers and my mother got off and she went to talk to\nsomeone. She wanted -- She was in -- th-the -- she was desperate, trying to get in touch\nwith someone in the United States, so she could use her re-entry permit. She got -- She\nremained -- She missed the -- Our train pulled out and she re -- and she got stuck in there.\nThe next station I came, I got off and I went to talk to someone and the problem was the\nlanguage. Because, in spite of the fact that I was under Germ -- with the Germans for so\nmany years, I never spoke German and I don\u2019t speak German. And German still remains\na hated language. I found out that she ended up in Munich. So we remained in -- I think it\nwas in Salzburg, if I remember right. I remained there for an extra day or two and I --\nsomehow I was able to send word for her to come down and she came down and we got\nreunited. And, with the group of people that I was tr -- that we were together, we kept\ngoing and we ended up in Kramona, in Italy. We went through the Brenner pass, we\nended up in Italy. We were in camp in Kramona maybe three months when we decided,\nwhat\u2019s Kramona? It\u2019s a dead-end place. Let\u2019s keep on going and we\u2019re -- w-we ended up\nin a Displaced Person camp in Rome.",
        "Q: Cheenacheeta",
        "A: Cheenacheeta. That\u2019s where th-the old movie studios. From Cheenacheeta, which is in\nthe suburbs of Rome, we were able to go to Rome and find someone from our town to\nsay, \u201cWhat are you doing there? With the UNRRA packages and with the little money\nthat you might have, rent an apartment and you will be able to live, you will able to do\nsomething. You\u2019re -- It\u2019s a -- It\u2019s again an dead end thing.\u201d So we rented a room in\nRome. We had the packages, the food packages from UNRRA to survive on. You used to\nsell some of it. I don\u2019t know where the money came from. I tried to buy things, sell\nthings, but I was never good at it. In fact, I used to go to Milan on the train and because I\nwas wearing American army fatigues, I couldn\u2019t speak English, I couldn\u2019t speak Italian, I\nused to speak like a mumbo-jumbo of something or speak -- say the few words in Italian,\ntry to imitate an -- an English accent and get away without paying the -- the -- the --\nwithout paying the fare. Go up to Milan, buy some watches, bring them back to Rome,\nsell the watches in Rome, at a profit, of course and that\u2019s how we used to make a living.\nThen again, I tried to enroll in Rome, at the University of Rome. And they said, \u201cYou\ncan\u2019t do it without a high school diploma.\u201d There was a -- sort of a -- like a soup kitchen\nin Rome, operated by -- I think it was by the American Joint Distribution Committee,\nwhere you could go there and get one nice, good meal, hot meal a day. And then Rome\nwas a city that I s -- I must have spent a couple of months in the Vatican museum, just --\njust looking there. I was in -- it was insatiable, looking at the treasures in the Vatican\nmuseum or with my love of music, I used to go and -- to standing room at the Rome\nopera, just to listen to th-the real famous singers that I knew at the time. Benjamina Jilly\nand I can\u2019t remember the -- who was the -- the -- the -- the -- the female star of the time.",

        "A: I slept through it. I just had a very interesting experience, which is completely on a\ntangent. I have a very good friend, who has a daughter. She is a -- a psychologist. Her\nhusband 1s a professor of German literature at NYU, in New York. His brother was\nmarried to a woman who he -- who he divorced, who remarried since and married an\nopera singer. That opera singer was here in New York, in 1991. He is Czech, himself,\nwith the -- when ma -- the Metropolitan Opera brought in Katta Cabanava, opera by\nYanachek, he was one of the leading men. I was invited then, we went to the Met, we had\ndinner in the dress circle and the first time we were invited behind the -- behind the\ncurtains at the Met, him being a star, he had a room with a star, not the -- when you go to\nthe Met, you go -- first there are the dressing rooms for the chorus and then there the\nstars. For the stars you need a special permit to get in there. So, we went there. His name\nis Peter Straka. Peter Shtraka, not Straka. I call him Straka, they call him Shtraka. He was\njust now in New York again. There was a revival of Katta Cabanava, all over -- all the\nmo -- all the month of January. And I have recorded that opera of the -- from -- they had\na Saturday matinee. I pi -- I recorded it for him. In fact, I just sent my -- my friend\u2019s\ndaughter, she went to Zurich and they live in Zurich. I gave her the tapes to give it to\nhim. And that opera is in Czech. I have the original recording. My original tapes, I have\nthem here. I copied them off, copied them and I es -- gave it to him. And I was -- and I\nfound beauty, actually. Wh-When -- The first time when I listened to the opera at the\nMet, I was bored. Czech opera in Czech. But I did find, when I listened to it the second\ntime or the third time and the fourth time -- because I had the tapes, I had to edit the tape.\nI took out some things, the opera quiz, you know, the -- I took it out. I found a lo -- I\nfound it being quite interesting. So I ju -- I like the -- not just Italian operas, not just\nFrench operas, but here was a Czech opera which was rather interesting.",

See if you can write to him and maybe\nhe can do something for you.",
        "Q: Hang on a minute.",
        "A: So I -- I send him up a photograph, a picture of me, with a letter describing my high\nschool graduating class. Giving him the names of my -- some principal -- some teachers\nthat I had, just trying to refresh his memory. He asked me, \u201cI remember pri -- I remember\nyou perfectly well. I remember you and the people that were with you,\u201d because, see\nhere, a graduating class -- or high school graduating classes, several thousand. We had\n30-odd people. So he remembered. He send me the papers, he send me the documents. I\nsend him some packages, gifts and so on. He says, \u201cDon\u2019t send me any more, I don\u2019t\nneed it. I am well provided here.\u201d And that allowed me to decide. I already had the paper.\nIn the meantime, my mother left and I was left alone in Rome.",
        "Q: Why did she leave? Why didn\u2019t you go with her?",
        "A: She had the re-entry permit.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And she -- she received the visa to go by herself. I was not a child. I was in my mid-\n20\u2019s. I was not a minor. I said to her -- she wa -- she -- she was reluctant. I says, \u201cYou go.\nThen, when you are settled there, bring me back.\u201d But, you can -- what\u2019s the sense of\nboth of us struggling here? You go and be there. Turin, which had a university, a medical\nschool and a Polytechnic Institute. So it became like a Mecca for Je -- for Jewish students.\nAnd the AJDC, the American Joint Distribution Committee rented a villa -- a villa on\nCorso Montcarlieri, I remember, right across the river Po, right on the other side of the\nbridge. Cr -- Cr -- It was -- It was not the river Po, I am sorry, it was another river, I don\u2019t\nremember. Po is in va -- the river Po is in -- in Florence. I don\u2019t remember the name of\nthe river. And I went there and they accepted me. It\u2019s all -- The traveling was all done\nwith American army fatigues. For the rail, I didn\u2019t have to pay. It was an overnight trip\nfrom Rome to Turin by train. But we didn\u2019t pay anything, we just got on the train and\nthat\u2019s it. You want to la -- you want to put me off, put me off. I don\u2019t care. We were, in\nfact, I have ma -- I -- I was one of the original ones that started that student home in\nTurin. There was a -- Then, we had an administrator that ran that thing, and o -- the only\nthing we had to do is all of our UNRRA packages and all of our -- went into the home.\nThe university accepted us because we were displaced people. I have never worried about\npaying tuition. I don\u2019t know what happened, if they paid or they didn\u2019t pay. I was just\nenrolled and that\u2019s it. See, Italian universities were different from American universities.\nHere, when you go to college, it\u2019s like going to -- to high school. They take attendance,\nthey ch -- you know, they check you, it\u2019s like -- you are like a kid. You had to sign your\nattendance list. If you signed it twice during a semester, you were given credit for\nattendance. You didn\u2019t have to be there. And it didn\u2019t make sense for me to be there,\nbecause I couldn\u2019t understand the lectures anyway. I had to study on my own and -- and\ntry to translate and try to memorize, try to understand it. Because even if I knew what -- if\nI knew the technical language, if I knew the course, I could not converse with the --\nduring the oral part of the exam, because I didn\u2019t understand what he was talking to me\nabout, but he was talking to me. If he went off on a tangent, or start asking me questions.\nI mastered it, to a point. And I didn\u2019t have -- my grades in -- in Turin were not as high as\nthey were in Lvov, but they were-- I passed, and that\u2019s all that counted at the time, is I\nhave passing grades.",
        "Q: When did you know that the war was over?",
        "A: I knew that the war was over one day after my birthday, in 1944.",
        "Q: That\u2019s July?",
        "A: July 27th. The Germans came -- The Germans were expelled -- left Lvov July 26. On\nmy birthday, we wanted to get out from our hiding, but the woman that was hiding us\nsaid, \u201cPlease don\u2019t get out of here. I don\u2019t want my neighbors to know that I was hiding\nJews. Stay another day and get out in the middle of the night.\u201d The following day, that\u2019s\nwhen all of us left, one by one. Of course, we were immediately arrested by the Russian\narmy patrol, taken not to jail, taken like the city hall, where we slept on a table or\nsomething, I don\u2019t -- and the following day, we were released.",
        "Q: Why were you arrested?",
        "A: Why?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Because we were pa -- we were on the streets after the curfew. There was a sunset to -\n- \u00a7-Sunrise -- no, sunset to sunrise curfew, where you could not be in the streets. We went\nimmediately to the -- what you would call the authorities or whatever you call them, and\nthey said to us, \u201cFind yourself an apartment.\u201d Wi -- Of course, we went back to the place\nwhere we used to live, before the ghetto in Lvov. The Poles were st -- were there and we\ncouldn\u2019t -- we couldn\u2019t go there, but next -- next to there, there was an apartment which\nwas occu -- was -- used to be occupied by a German general. We got in there and f-\nfortunately for us, it was not that the fact that the apartment was furnished, but they were\n-- there was some food left in the apartment that we could use, they ran away so fast. So\nwe took over that apartment and we were there -- that was our apartment. We\u2019re -- We\u2019re\n-- We\u2019re sort of requisitioned the apartment. B-B -- My mother, she spoke Russian very\nfluently, she could write -- I mean, I could write and I could speak, but she went -- she --\nalmost immediately, she got a job, what you would call, with the incoming Russian\nauthorities. That\u2019s not Russian, but Communist authorities. I didn\u2019t do anything at the\ntime. I was going to the marketplace, buying and selling things and I\u2019Il never forget, my\nfirst big transaction was when a Russian army truck was parked in -- a Russian soldier\ncalled me and he said to me, \u201cI have some American canned -- canned pork -- ham a --\nthe [indecipherable] cans of processed pork and I like to sell 1t. What are you going to\ngive me for it?\u201d Said, \u201cI can\u2019t give you anything, but I will take a couple of them. You\nwill have to trust me.\u201d And I took two, because they were quite heavy and I couldn\u2019t\ncarry them and I had to hide them. I went to the marketplace, I sold them, I came back, I\ngave him half the money. He was very happy. And I just kept going back and forth, back\nand forth, back and forth. And I don\u2019t remember how many I sold, but I have made a lot\nof money that day. And fortunate -- fortunately, I was not arrested or caught. After that, I\nhad -- There were rumors that the Russians are going to draft all the men my age, in the\n20\u2019s, who were not in the army. I -- I knew what the Russians were going to do. I mean, a\nfriend of mine, who I found out later, their job was going through mine fields and trying\nto disarm the mines in front of the tanks, with mine detectors. He had a leg blown. He 1s -\n- He is alive, fortunately. He is in Israel. But I was trying to avoid a situation like that, so\nI went to the Polytechnic Institute. Th-The rumors were that the Polytechnic Institute is\ngoing to re-open. I went there and the archives were intact. They found all the papers,\nthey found all -- all of the documents. They accepted me and they gave me the admission.\nSo when I went back to the dra -- what you would call the draft board and I showed them\nthat I am a student which is enrolled now, they gave me a deferment. And basically I feel\nthat what saved my life. Another thing that saved my life was the fact that the\nPolytechnic Institute in Kiev was not functioning, was -- for some reason, was not\nworking. And because Lvov was working, the professors that were in Kiev came to Lvov\n-- the ones that survived -- because Lvov had no -- had no faculty. The administersth --\nthe administrative personnel was -- remained there, but there was no one to teach. So they\ncame from Kiev, from Moscow, do -- and some of the Poles that survived, they\nassembled enough faculty to teach, cause if Kiev was in existence, Lvov wouldn\u2019t have\nopened.",

        "Q: What was his --",
        "A: -- not because he was hiding Jews.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Tracholder. Jan Tracholder. That was one of the names I had to spell to the --\npreviously on the -- to the interviewer. I met him -- When we came to Lvov, from Lida,\nin 1940, Lvov was overpopulated. From 150, became 300,000. We couldn\u2019t find a place\nwhere to live. So we finally found a -- an apart -- a -- a small apartment on the outskirts\nof Lvov. He rented it to us, I don\u2019t know why. Because he was -- he knew that we were\nJewish. He knew exactly what was happening, but I have maybe developed a rapport\nwith him. On the beginning, I have -- I don\u2019t say that I did help him, but I have showed\nsome understanding in the things that he was doing. He was a builder, a -- a contractor.\nAt that time, he was already in his 60\u2019s. And I have expressed my admiration at that time\nfor the Polish leaders from the 30\u2019s, like Marshall Pilsiltski. And he was a great lover of\nPilsiltski, a great admirer. We have developed, sort of like a friendship, so that when I --\nwe le -- when we found an apartment in Lvov later and we left him, I still kept in touch --\nin touch with him. I used to go out there, walk that kilometer from the last trolley stop to\nhis shop and sort of discuss politics with him. What\u2019s going on in London, with the\nPolish government in London. What\u2019s going on in the world. So when we -- when the\nghetto became a dead end and my mother, after she came back from being 1n hiding --\nafter the Germans caught her on the way back -- they beat her up, they told her to dig her\ngrave, and because a German patrol brought out other woman -- I think I have described\nthat part -- a-another woman and that woman was shot, the -- the -- the -- the SS man let\nher go and she came ba -- she came back to the ghetto, I saw -- I went ba -- I was abl -- I\nwas working outside the ghetto, so I skipped my -- from my -- from my job -- from my\npa -- from whatever we were doing. I -- I removed the arm band and I went to talk to\nhim, would he accept -- would he accept my mother to go in hiding? Because we were\nold friends, I would call it, he said, \u201cLet me think about it. Pll give you an answer.\u201d And\neventually, on the second trip, he did accept her. I smuggled her out -- out of the ghetto\nwith my wa -- w-with my ma -- w-w-with my work detachment, what you would call it,\nthat we used to work outside the ghetto -- outside the ghetto walls. I -- I got her there -- I\ncame back to the ghetto, but when I got out of the ghetto, I went with the Polish\nunderground, with the -- with the Akar, with the army of Cryova. And when I found that\nthey were so hostile to me that I -- I ga -- I wouldn\u2019t survive with them, I went to him to\nlet me in, and he did. Maybe he took advantage of me at the time, because I was able to\nhelp him. He had, at that time already, grenades, rifles, ammunition, a short wave radio\nreceiver and transmitter, where he was communitcating with the -- the -- the Akar, the\narmy of Cryova, he was like a center post -- center point, where the army of Cr-Cryova\nwas -- was commu-communicating through him. He was one of many. On -- On the other\nhand, he was with an anti-Semitic group and he was still hiding two Jews. Two Jews that\nwere paying him to be there, but in order to be able to convert, with what -- my mother\nwas paying him with gold coins, with American dollars. There\u2019s what -- do -- they were\nof no value unless you could -- could convert them into the current currency. And in -- in\norder convert it into currency -- he didn\u2019t trust anyone in Lvov. He used to go to the walls\nof ghetto, communicate with this man that eventually came into hiding with us, that did\nnot survive. Through him, he got another woman and another family of seven that we\ndidn\u2019t know about. My mother and I didn\u2019t know about them. When I came back to my\nmother, we saw stranger -- we heard strange noises and strange shadows in the middle of\nthe night and we confronted him and then he put us all together. The -- The reason why\nwe saw those shadows and so on, because they had to go to the bathroom -- to dispose of\ntheir body waste. We had to go to dispose of the body waste into a cesspool or something\nof that sort. Or get water from the -- from the di -- from the well that he had in the ba -- in\n-- in his basement. But they -- the part that a being -- he said, \u201cI was saving u -- I was\nsaving human beings. I am not a Jew lover, I don\u2019t like Jews.\u201d And they used to say, \u201cBut\nyou like money.\u201d So he says, \u201cMoney does -- did na -- money doesn\u2019t do any harm. But\nthink what I -- what I am risking with.\u201d And eventually, through -- I think through\ntriangulation, they found his radio receiver, transmitter, from -- the Germans. They came,\nthey discovered the arms, they discovered the -- everything, but they never discovered the\nJews. We have camouflaged ourselves in such a way that they couldn\u2019t find us. And who\nbuilt? I built it with him, because the Hasidisha family of seven wa -- th -- they -- they --\nthey didn\u2019t have to lay a brick, they couldn\u2019t do anything. They were praying all day\nlong.",
        "Q: What\u2019s your feeling toward Hasid\u2019s now?",
        "A: I think it\u2019s a waste of time.

Not that I -- I belong to a Conservative temple in\nhere, but I -- I went to a Reform temple because of my -- because of connections and so\non, because of it just happened so -- and I find that the Reform movement allows Jews to\nbe more alle -- more contemporary and to be more -- it was not a -- is -- does not take\nhim away from Judaism, it just make hi -- makes him more modern.

My -- I know my parents were in touch with them, but they\nwere asked, \u201cPlease, you can do more harm to us by corresponding with us, than good by\ngiving -- by sending us things.\u201d So we were never in touch with them.",

        "A: I got respect for religion from my grandparents. But my grandfather\u2019s sister was\nmarried to a Hossett. When my father died, for 11 months -- I was 10 years old, I was 11\nyears old, I said Kaddish every day, in the Hasidisha temple, because my grandfather\ndidn\u2019t go to temple every day. He went sometimes of -- on -- on -- on -- on Saturdays and\nall holidays, even minor holidays. We didn\u2019t go to school on even minor holidays. Like\nPassover, first two days and the last two days. Sukkot, the first and the last. I mean, a --\nPurim, every -- every holiday, we ob -- we observed every holiday.",
        "Q: And now?",

I said, \u201cI don\u2019t mind, but the problem is yours, not mine.\u201d And the reason\nwhy she did it, because her mother was observant. Her father was not, but her mother\nwas. So, in order for her mother to be able to eat in her house, she say -- I say, \u201cI don\u2019t\nmind, do you want to have two sets of dishes, that\u2019s your problem. I will not obstruct it.

And when we\nwent to a kosher Chinese restaurant, we walked out, because without pork and shrimp, it\ndoesn\u2019t taste the same. Chinese food doesn\u2019t taste -- doesn\u2019t taste right. And I remember\nthat first place, 1t was on King\u2019s highway -- on Flatbush Avenue, there was a Chinese\nrestaurant, called Shanghai kosher Chinese restaurant. We walked out of there because it\njust didn\u2019t taste the same, it didn\u2019t taste good. In Chinese food -- I remember when we\nwere looking for a house in New Jersey, our standard joke was, don\u2019t look for how many\ntemples are in the neighborhood, but look for how many Chinese restaurants in -- are in\nthe neighborhood.

        "Q: So, apropos of what is going on right now in this country, is -- is the United States the\npolitical climate you thought you were coming to?",
        "A: No, no one could predicted this thing is going to happen like this. No one could\npredict. First of all, the president that allowed me to stay here, was completely the\nopposite morally of what\u2019s going on, and it was Truman. It\u2019s interesting, but after I got\nmy BS in \u201849, I have received a letter from the immigration authorities in Chicago, to\nreport for deportation, cause I came here on a student visa and when you come on a\nstudent visa, you have to have a place where to go. The only place that I could find that\nwould accept me from Italy -- Italy would not accept me back, I was a Displaced Person,\nwas -- I frankly don\u2019t remember if 1t was Uruguay or Paraguay, but one of those\ncountries. I think it was Uruguay. So I went to the dean of foreign students and I said to\nhim, \u201cYou know, my plans are to go for a Master\u2019s degree, because engineers are now a\ndime a dozen.\u201d Fact, at that time, engineers were getting 37.50 a week.

So\nin order to compete in the -- in the -- 1n the -- in the wa-- 1n the -- in the market better, I\nsaid, \u201cIll go for a Master\u2019s degree.\u201d So, he called the immigration in Chicago and he said\nto him, \u201cWhat are you going to take, my best man from here?\u201d I got a BS with honors at\nthe time. He says, \u201cHe\u2019s going to go for a Master\u2019s degree.\u201d So, \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, th -- th -\n- they said, \u201cSe -- Let him send -- send me the proper document-documentation,\u201d and in\nthe meantime, Truman passed the bill that I was able to stay here without any problems.\nBut in \u201851, I got -- I got married to an American citizen, I could have -- but I never di -- I\nnever claimed citizenship on the basis of marriage.",
        "Q: Why not?",
        "A: I had it the other way, why should I? It\u2019s -- He -- It was a -- It didn\u2019t make any\ndifference if I become a citizen a year sooner or two years sooner. There was another\nyear, so what?",
        "Q: Your wife -- Did you feel that as an American -- as someone who hadn\u2019t been what\nyou\u2019d gone through -- what you\u2019d gone through that she could even understand who you\n-- who you were and what you were about?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think she would understand. I don\u2019t think she did understand. I don\u2019t think that\nany American can understand. The things that I or other people went through are so\ntraumatic that unless you live through it, you cannot express it, you cannot describe it.",
        "Q: Did you talk about it with her?",
        "A: No. Very little. Very little. In fact, I haven\u2019t spoken to it abou -- with my children.\nIt\u2019s my grandson that 1s asking more questions than anyone else.",
        "Q: Why didn\u2019t you speak to your wife or your children about this?",
        "A: Could have been maybe two reasons, basically. One, they didn\u2019t want me to talk about\nit, not to bring it out more, to more or less, let\u2019s forget about it. The attitude was, let\u2019s\nforget about it. Let\u2019s put it in the past. And the other one was that -- that things were so\nhorrible and so bad that I just didn\u2019t want them to know about it. There was no reason.\nThey knew basically what happened, but not in fine detail. I don\u2019t think anyone knows it\nin fine detail, because when I try to visualize that time now, the different situations that\nhappened to me, the only thing I can say, like someone asked me, \u201cHow -- How did you\nmanage to survive?\u201d I said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing but pure luck. It\u2019s nothing but luck,\u201d because\njust like when you are in the -- 1n -- doy -- 1-1-in a war, and you are with another man next\nto you and a bullet hits him and not you, what determines it? Nothing but luck.",
        "Q: Seems it was more than luck. You were really canny. You knew how to assume other\nidentities, even to the point of wearing the fatigues on the trains in Italy.",
        "A: That was not a matter of survival. That was a matter of survival, but not a matter of\nlife and death.",
        "Q: It was --",
        "A: When it cames to li -- When it came to life and death, 1t was purely luck. I -- I have\nmany situations where you would call -- it was the right decision at the right time. Now,\nwhy did I make that decision? And I -- many times, I tried to analyze myself, why did I\ndecide -- just like why did I go to the right and a -- a -- a -- or -- or not to the left? I don\u2019t\nknow. It just -- Something guided me internally.",
        "Q: Do you think God had anything to do with it?",
        "A: Could be. I don\u2019t know. Could be. I -- I -- I can\u2019t say I believe in God, but I believe in\na -- in a super being, in something that 1s there, that guides our destiny. I went -- Look, I\ncame here. I mean, I had my problems when I -- 1-1-in the United States. When I\ndiscovered my mother had cancer, I had Bell\u2019s Palsy, which never came back. I still have\nmy left side of the face paralyzed. I had what they call a decompression. They remove\none ear, they drill a hole in your head and let the nerve expand. After that, I had to make\na major decision. There was a su-suspicion, not that many years ago, that I had a\ncancerous kidney, so I decided to remove the kidney. Well, I am fine. Not so recently, I\nhad angioplasty, with a couple of stents put in. Mean, those are all decisions that I had to\nmake on the spot, with the help of my children. My daughter is a doctor, a physician. My\nson 1s a pharmacist. They can give me educated guesses, but you know, it\u2019s like anything\nelse. The dec -- the final decision is mine.",
        "Q: Do you think that the God or higher power, whomever may have -- who may have\nhelped you survive, 1s the same one who oversaw the Holocaust?",
        "A: If there is a proof that there 1s no God, that\u2019s the Holocaust. There is a proof there 1s\nGod is the people that survived the Holocaust. I mean, where -- that thing will remain\nunanswered, I guess. There\u2019s no answer to that -- a question like this.",
        "Q: Did you pray at all during that period when you were 1n hiding in [inaudible]",
        "A: Probably, in my own way. Not from a Hebrew book, or not from a seder or from\nmemory, because I didn\u2019t have any. My memory, basically, of Hebrew prayers boils\ndown to the four questions and the Kaddish, and the beginning of each prayer.

        "Q: Y-You mentioned that you thought Truman was an upstanding fellow, but I\u2019m\ncurious, for one -- couple things. One, what\u2019s your feeling toward this countries attitudes\ntoward the Holocaust as it was occurring? Two -- You know, the restrictions on -- on\nimmigration, and -- and Truman, of course, himself, ordered the bombing on Hiroshima\nand Nagasaki. He killed -- He was responsible for the order that killed thousands -- tens\nof thousands of civilians also.",
        "A: I have very strong feelings when it comes to the guilt of this country and England,\nwhen they came to the Holocaust. Not a single train and not a single railroad, not --\nnothing was ever bombed. The trains, they knew about it, 1t\u2019s documented that they knew\nwhat was going on and if they couldn\u2019t have stopped it, they could have slowed it down.\nThey could have done things -- those people were as good as dead anyway. They could\nhave at least destroyed the [indecipherable]. They could have destroyed the -- the -- the --\nthe -- the -- the mass killings. The Russians were actually -- were more sympathetic,\nbecause the Russian underground -- the Russian partisans were more sympathetic toward\nJews, they -- they accepted Jews on a -- on a basis where you didn\u2019t have to say who you\nwere, as long as you were willing to fight, as long as you were willing to do something.\nAnd the proof of it 1s -- are my own friends, who survived -- many survived in the -- in\nthe swamps around my hometown, in the area. The Bellski brigade -- meehava -- I\u2019m\nquite friendly with the -- with these people, I know them quite well. I used to play cards\nwith Tevya. Tuvya, not Tevya. Or the Polish a -- the -- the Poles never gave any\ndirections or any instructions to the Polish underground, go ahead and help the Jews or\ndo something that would more or less minimize the killings. The fact that I was saved by\na Pole, that\u2019s strictly an exception. It\u2019s -- It\u2019s such an exception that he deserves anyth --\nany -- any recognition possible. All I know is, the man perished, himself. His wife\nrefused any contact afterwards.

        "Q: What\u2019s your feeling toward Poles in general now?",
        "A: It\u2019s strange, but the feel -- my feeling towards Poles 1s --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: Tape three, side A, interview with Jack Ahrens. -- that feeling towards the Polish\nlanguage, since you hadn\u2019t tried to relearn it.",
        "A: So when I see some of my friends that are conversing -- talking in Polish between\nthemselves, I sort of try to switch their conversation to English. And some of them do,\nbecause -- many of them do, in fact, because if husband and wife were both brought up in\nPoland and both wi -- have a Polish background, and their children are not present,\nthey\u2019 ll speak to each other in Polish. I tried to avoid it because I -- I Just -- the same thing\n-- I feel a strong reaction toward German. I just cannot stand the -- the language. In fact\nthat I am very, very friendly with this professor of German literature, who is Jewish, from\nthe -- a Jew from Switzerland, a professor of German literature, who 1s re -- teaching at\nNYU, I didn\u2019t ask him what he\u2019s -- he has a course this year, I didn\u2019t ask him what it was,\nbut I think last year, one -- he skipped one semester, I think, last year he had a course on\nGerman literature about a Holocaust. The -- The post-Holocaust German literature, about\n-- about the Holocaust, which is very interesting literature. Well, he gave me names of\nsome books to read in translation, which were unbelievable, unbelievable. One was the\ntransformation of a German police unit into a -- into a unit of notorious killers, how they\njustified it and how they became immune to killing. That you can kill eight hours a day\nand after the eight hours, you become a family man, a -- a church loving man and so on.\nA -- A -- La -- A God fearing man, if you would call it.

        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: And yet you -- you find asylum in this country.",
        "A: That was at that time. Now, there is still a lot of anti-Semitism in here. There is a lot\nand the only way that Jews are doing what they are doing for the survivors, let it be here,\nlet it be in the state of Israel, let 1t be anywhere, is because [indecipherable] Jews have the\npower to do it. They have the money, they have the power to do it and they have the will\nto do it. They have -- I don\u2019t know of any minority group which constitutes I don\u2019t know\nhow many millions of people, in quantity, that has that many organizations, which are\nmore or less directed toward self help and the help of state of Israel.

        "A: Very little. I was in a Jewish fraternity.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I was more or less a foreign student at the university and what they are -- what -- the\nquestion was, where do you came -- where do you came from? Of course, I came from\nPoland. I mean, there was no connection between what was happening. People were quite\n-- they were and they still are quite ignorant after what happened, how it happened. I\nhave to tell to many am -- many Americans that I talk to, the history of 1939, for\nexample, where Poland was attacked from both sides and divided into two parts. The --\nThe town where I came from actually, it\u2019s not that disappeared, but when you asking wh-\nwhere it is, I don\u2019t know where it 1s. It\u2019s in Belarus now, but when I was born in Poland,\nit was Poland. Before I was born, not that many years before I was born, it was Russia.\nSo, actually, what 1s it? Europe was so fluid. I think it\u2019s one of the longest times now, the\nlast 50 years or whatever it 1s, where borders are -- the artificial borders are sort of --\nmore or less steady and you can say where I come from.",
        "Q: Do you do much speaking to -- about the Holocaust to groups?",
        "A: I never spoke to any groups. I never spoke to any groups about the Holocaust. I spoke\nto -- I speak to some people, I -- but not enough, definitely not enough and I feel that\nwhatever is being said 1s not enough. Because people should learn how to tolerate, how\nto -- I don\u2019t say how to love other people, but how to tolerate the other -- other beliefs\nand other -- other cultures.",

        "A: My mentor in school was a Japanese professor, Seki Consol. He was one of the\nJapanese professors -- one of the Japanese who was not interned during the war, by\norders of President Roosevelt. He was one of the main researchers and one of the originer\n-- originators of residential air conditioning, especially for housing and army barracks.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Was this in Carbondale, or --",
        "A: No. Champagne-Urbana. When I finished my thesis and I spoke to him, I -- we were\non a first name basis, we came good friends. I said to him, \u201cWhat am I going to do now?\u201d\nHe says, \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said, \u201cgo to Cleveland. Go to Viking Air Conditioning, there\nis a good friend out there of mine, Mari-Marion Levy. Tell him I sent you.\u201d I said, \u201cGive\nme a letter.\u201d He said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need it.\u201d I said, \u201cCall him.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to\nwaste a call.\u201d So I came home, I spent a little time home, I went to Cleveland. I -- I think\nI checked into a hotel, I come to Viking Air Conditioning. I made myself an appointment\nwith Marion Levy and he says -- and I -- he says to me, \u201cWho are you?\u201d And so on, I\nintroduce myself. And he says to me, \u201cI have nothing here.\u201d Now, Viking Air\nConditioning was a manufacturers of fans and blowers. Said, \u201cI have nothing here.\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cWe are on a -- We are more or less winding down. We did a lot of war production\nin here, but there is nothing doing.\u201d And I said to him, \u201cBut you know, but Seki Consol\nsent me here and said come o -- go.\u201d That was before the weekend. He says, \u201cAll right,\u201d\nhe says, \u201cgo find yourself a room where you\u2019re going to stay and come here Monday. I\u2019ll\n-- We\u2019ll talk about it.\u201d So, I f -- I went out, I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to find a room. He\u2019s\ngoing to send me back. What am I going to look for a room?\u201d I came Monday. He says to\nme, \u201cYou know, you\u2019re going to be in the research and development department.\u201d I said,\n\u201cFine.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat am I supposed to do?\u201d He says to me, \u201cTalk to the head of the\ndepartment.\u201d I said, \u201cWho is the head?\u201d He says, \u201cYou.\u201d He says, \u201cWe are just starting a\nresearch and development department.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d He says,\n\u201cIt\u2019s your problem now.\u201d S -- Anyway, I was there for a year. In the meantime, you\nknow, we did a lot of interesting things, I did a lot of interesting things. I have designed a\n-- an exhaust fan unit, which was sold by Sears and Roebuck. In fact, it\u2019s still being sold.\nThe same unit, exactly the same way -- the same way I designed it. Here ha -- They put a\nfew electronic controls on it, but basically, it\u2019s exactly the same unit. Cause the company\nis not in existence any more. It was sold to another company and taken over by another\ncompany. But the unit still remained and Sears still has it as a window exhaust fan. I was\nmore or less what you call keeping company with my future wife at the time. We were\ncorresponding. I used to take off Friday after work, from Cleveland, by car, drive all\nnight -- that\u2019s 500 miles -- drive all night, come here Saturday morning, have a couple of\nhours of sleep, spend Saturday and Sunday, leave Sunday, late in the afternoon and go\nreport Monday morning to work.",
        "Q: That\u2019s love.",
        "A: Then, when I saw that that thing is a little bit too much and she wouldn\u2019t -- she would\n-- she would not move. Says come here and that\u2019s it. If your -- So I gave up the job and I\ncame to New York and I found another job.",
        "Q: What was that job?",
        "A: That\u2019s it. I went to work for a company -- through another company, actually, whose\nmain product was environmental testing equipment. But they developed line of heating\nequipment, baseboard and heating units and I became more or less the manager of that\ndivision.",
        "Q: You said that one of the things you never wanted to do was fail. Never wanted to fail\nat anything. Has that been true then, for your life?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t fail at it. I don\u2019t think I failed. I did -- I did things the b -- to the best of my\nability. I was not very successful, but I sort of ca -- held my own in a dog eat dog\nbusiness, because there was a lot of major companies. I had to compete with companies --\nwith billion dollar companies. That -- That particular division. So, I sort of branched off\nin there and did some design. Besides running that division, I did design of e-\nenvironmental testing equipment, which was a very challenging subject. United States\nused to send up satellites and rockets into space, which used to come with all kinds of\ndata. What are the conditions in outer space? We were designing equipment that would\nsimulate the change and the condition in the outer space. So, for example, if a rocket,\nequipped with electronic equipment, would be sent up, you start with ground conditions.\nWhile it\u2019s going up, because of skin friction with air, the temperature can build up to a\ncouple of hundred degrees on the -- on the surface. But the pressure -- the va -- will\nchange and it will come up to almost absolute vacuum. But then we found out that it isn\u2019t\nso, that there is a Van Allen belt, or actually the vacuum from a high vacuum, it -- it\nchanges and there 1s a little more ionization in there. So we had to simulate it in a\nchamber. So when people were building their electronic equipment, or their products,\nthey could actually put it into a chamber and the chamber would sa -- would simulate --\nnot the fl -- the flight, but the ca -- the -- the changing conditions. So we knew -- th-those\nwere all classified data, so we knew what -- what 1s going on, how the -- how the\nconditions progress. And the -- the -- that was a challenging design, when they used to\ngive a Set of specifications.",
        "Q: Did your wife --",
        "A: But that was also -- that was also a -- a -- a competitive business. We were not the\nonly one.",
        "Q: Did your wife work?",
        "A: My wife worked on the beginning. She had a degree in edu -- elementary education\nfrom NYU. She even started her Masters. But then the two children came and we decided\nboth, she\u2019 ll raise the children.",
        "Q: Did you want children?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Why was that important to you?",
        "A: I sort of wanted to leave a legacy in this world. And my daughter was born and then\nmy son. Did I want the daughter first? No, I think I wanted a son first. But Pll accept\nthem the way they are. I\u2019Il accept them then, just the way they are. And one thing I was\nable to instill in them is the value of education and the -- and the value of -- moral values.\nI think both of them are pretty good people.",
        "Q: Did you raise them as Jews?",
        "A: Yes. I raised them as Jews, but then I was disappointed twice -- more than twice. My\ndaughter went to Hebrew school. She didn\u2019t have a Bas Mitzvah. Bas Mitzvahs were not\nfashionable at that time, if you can call it that way. Now, they are fashionable, but at that\ntime, they were not. My son had a very nice Bar Mitzvah. He even went to the -- what\nyou call the Hebrew high school at the East [indecipherable] Jewish Center. He had a\nscholarship in there and he was quite proficient. My daughter married an Italian. My\ndaughter was -- I think she was number -- in the top 10, I think she was number six or\nnumber four or something. In with -- In the graduating class of Medwood High School.\nThe famous principal out there was, I think, Dr. Bernstein. Was quite known for his\nstandards and his arc -- educational requirements. At the fifth year, that was the first year,\nwith Downstate Medical and Brooklyn College started a program of selecting 10 students\nfor an accelerated medicals program, seven years instead of eight years BA MD, they\nmake it -- made it in seven years, BA MD. My daughter applied, she was one of the\npeople that were accepted in the BA MD program. So was her future husband, from\nSavarian High School in the -- also in Brooklyn. Ca -- A real Catholic High School. They\nfell in love -- They\u2019re getting divorced right now, by the way. They met there and they\ngot married, I think two weeks before graduation from medical school. My son, when he\ns -- he was accepted in the same program, but when he saw that -- the kind of work my\ndaughter had to do, he says to me, he says, \u201cI\u2019m not going to do it.\u201d So I -- My wife and\nI, we up -- we wrote a letter to the director of the program, please give him one year\ndelay, a one year -- put him on a one year waiting period. Maybe he can change his mind.\nAnd we couldn\u2019t change his mind. First of all, he didn\u2019t want to way fro -- go away from\nhome. He wanted to go to an ophthalmology college in -- which was in Philadelphia. So\nhe didn\u2019t want to go away from home, there was none in New York. So he ended up in\nph-pharmacy school. He finished Brooklyn College, with a biology major and he went to\nBrooklyn College, to Long Island University for pharmacy. He 1s quite successful now,\nas a pharmacist. Then again, he married a girl which -- it\u2019s a question I don\u2019t know, 1s she\nJewish or isn\u2019t she Jewish? She says she is not.",
        "Q: Why is it a question?",
        "A: Because I don\u2019t know if her mother is Jewish or not. Her mother married a Holocaust\nsurvivor, with numbers tattoos on -- tattooed on his arm. The second husband. The first\nhusband was not Jewish. And my daughter-in-law is bringing up her two daughters as\nEpiscopalians or something. Which I might -- I object, deep in my heart, but I have -- I --\nI told my son I don\u2019t like it, and he says, \u201cIt\u2019s not your choice. You can object, but that\u2019s\nwhat she wants, and -- and --\u201d and he says, \u201cwh-what did God do for me? Took away my\nmother when she was so young?\u201d His mother died, she was 47 years old. So he is in\ncomplete denial of Judaism. And instead of trying to convert him or instead of trying to\ndo anything, I sort of -- I accept the status quo and I ignore it. I love them all, I accept\nthem all, Iam very supportive. I try to help them when I can and this is one subject which\nis not discussed. In fact, when my granddaughters went to a -- that was very recently, in a\nchurch to a confirmation or something? I -- I don\u2019t remember the title of it. I went there,\nin spite the fact that I didn\u2019t care for it and I didn\u2019t like it. My grandson had a Bar\nMitzvah, which I was very supportive of, which I helped to -- which his father la -- his\nfather have -- until today doesn\u2019t know that he had a Bar Mitzvah -- officially doesn\u2019t\nknow. Maybe he knows, maybe he doesn\u2019t, I don\u2019t know. But his father\u2019s family was\nthere. His aunt, his cousins were there, his immediate family was at the Bar Mitzvah, but\nhe was never told and because of the divorce being in progress for many, many years, I\nna -- his pa -- his parents -- his mother -- his father, I don\u2019t know what he 1s, but his\nmother say, I -- I think they support him. But the fact that this thing is so wrong, that his\nown aunt, his mother\u2019s sister, doesn\u2019t talk to her sister because of this divorce. Mean, it\u2019s\na family feud, but it\u2019s their problem, not mine. And I hope that I can see daylight already\nin this divorce, it\u2019s coming to an end, hopefully. But, it\u2019s time.",
        "Q: You -- you --",
        "A: But he 1s willingly -- he still has occasionally, not all the time, a woman come in -- his\nlast he -- not his last, I think it\u2019s the hebr -- she is a Hebrew teacher.

And he wa -- does it -- and he\ndoes it willingly.",
        "Q: Do you now, or have you ever considered yourself a Zionist?",
        "A: I was a Zionist when I was young. In fact, I belonged to the same party -- he -- he -- g\n-- | knew Begin. I knew Zharbortinsky, which are the -- the -- that\u2019s the _ -- that\u2019s the\nLikood, that\u2019s the Ergoon -- this is the -- the most reactionary part of the Jewish -- of the\nZionism. The so-called, in quotation, Jewish terrorists. But, I sort of mellowed. I see that\nIsrael is maybe a democracy, but a democracy with a question mark -- with a big question\nmark.",
        "Q: Have you thought about living there?",
        "A: No. I could not stand for their being governed and being dictated by the Orthodox.",
        "Q: When you were a young Zionist, what was your vision, what was your purpose behind\nbeing affiliated with the movement? What did you see as the possibility?",
        "A: My purpose at that time was basically -- 1s to show my identity. I was not accepted by\nthe Poles. In order to be accepted by my peers, I had to -- Zionism was a part of being --\nof acceptance by my peers. Now, there are the two groups. There was the Socialist\nZionist, the Hashomer Hatsiere and th-that was the Begorians party and there was the\nother one, the -- the ones that the only way we are going to get our countries through bloo\n-- sweat and blood and fight. That was the -- the Revision -- Revisionist, the\nShabortinksky party or the Leekud, now. There\u2019s the Shamir and -- and -- and -- and\nBegin. I felt closer to the other one. However, I had friend with the in -- on the other side,\nand we talked to each other, we were not enemies. We -- We had discussions. And we\nused to play Ping-Pong in each other\u2019s club. We were not mortal enemies, in fact that we\nare politically opposite.",
        "Q: It -- It sounds like you keep in touch with a lot of the people you used to be friends\nand associates with.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How have you kept this up all this time?",
        "A: With age, basically, many of us have passed on. I mean, they are -- they are\ndisappearing, because o -- strictly of age. But group -- the group of my peers, quite a few\nsurvived. I have a woman in Brooklyn, for example, with whom I have started\nkindergarten together, and we went through the four years of public school, not -- it was a\nprivate public school, and eight years of high school, the 12 years of education, not\ntogether, but in the same class. I have a number of other people in here that I grew up\ntogether, that we know each other from the time -- friends of mine say, \u201cHow do you --\nHow do you keep in touch?\u201d We sort of stick together.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Because we have a lot in common.",
        "Q: Do you talk about the past together?",
        "A: We talk a lot about the past, but the strange part, when we get together, the common\nlanguage now, especially with the ones that live in here, use English. The ones that don\u2019t\nlive here, is Yiddish, because we have quite a -- I have a few of them, several let\u2019s say,\nand we are scattered all over the world.",
        "Q: How many people are we talking about do you think?",
        "A: How many\u201d All together, you make -- I may count to 20.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a lot.",
        "A: I may count 15 - 20 at least. And we started, I ha -- I had a friend that passed on, in\nLondon. I have still a friend with whom I grew up together, in fact, my best childhood\nfriend lives in Munich, Germany since 1946, I think. Over 50 years in Munich. Basically,\nno one in Poland. I had -- I had some in the Soviet Union. Now they came ba -- Now they\nare living in here. I have in Israel, several. I had -- I have someone in our -- as far as\nAustralia. I have them in New York. In the immediate area -- area of New York, there are\nquite a few. Some I knew from before the war and when I say before the war, I mean\nbefore 1939. Some knew me before 1939, because see, in \u201839, I was 18. If someone was\n12 - 13, I didn\u2019t bother with them. That age difference has disappeared. So now we are\nbasically in the same age group. Or, if they were older than I was, that age difference has\nnarrowed and we know -- wa -- and a -- and right now we know each other, so we talk to\neach other. It\u2019s an interesting place, but -- I lived in Lida. In that general area, there were\nthree basically bigger towns. Lida, Novaroda, Kabanareetcha, that formed a triangle. In\nthe middle of the triangle, there was a little place where we used to go and spend our\nsummers. It was in the pine woods, in hef cottages. The families used to rent a cottage.

        "Q: Yeah, but what did she call you at first?",
        "A: I don\u2019t -- I think I told her my name 1s Jack or Jake or something. She called me Jack\nimmediately. She would not accept Jake.",
        "Q: So when you met on a blind date, was this love at first sight?",
        "A: No. Absolutely no. Absolutely no. But the first major date that I had with her, I took\nher to Brooklyn Academy of Music on New Year\u2019s Eve to see Madame Butterfly. That\u2019s\nthe first time she saw an opera.",
        "Q: How long did it take before the relationship became what it led to?",
        "A: Well, we were dating and talking to each other for probably a year and a half.",
        "Q: What did her parents think of her dating a survivor?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I was accepted there. I was accepted there, cause when I told her mother\nthat your food is cold when you -- when you -- when you serve, she always tried to burn\nme with hot soup. See, her mother was not -- not a modern woman. She did -- She was a\nlittle bit on the old-fashioned side. Her father was more or less modern, more modern\nthan -- than mother. So, we sort of developed a rapport and he was -- he -- he was a\nsweater manufacturer, together with two brothers. And he was more or less guiding the --\nthey had a small plant where they actually get the -- used to get the yarn, knit the\nmaterial, then cut it, sew it together and sell it. So one brother was the machinery -- in\ncharge of the machinery, the other one was in charge of the finishing and the third one in\ncharge of selling. He was in charge of the machinery. So, the mechanical background sort\nof gave us a -- a rapport together.",

I call 1t mind my own business.\nWith the -- With survivors -- With other survivors, I am not active in any survivor group\nor survivor organization or anything.

        "Q: In your interview -- previous interview, you said that one of the things you learned\nwas never to volunteer, conserve your energy.",

        "Q: But is it something that\u2019s kept with you?",
        "A: Could be, could be. Or maybe volunteering is not luck, not fate. I mean, it\u2019s sort of\npushing -- pushing your future, actively.

        "A: No. No, we don\u2019t talk too much about -- sometimes you know, I don\u2019t care to listen to\nhow they -- what happened to them and how they survived. I mean, on the beginning,\nyes, but now I don\u2019t remember. I -- I -- I mean, I cannot look at somebody and say he did\nthis and he did that and he -- and he was in here and he was in there. I cannot -- I don\u2019t --\nI d -- identify in that way. They here, that\u2019s all that counts.",
        "Q: When you -- How about your -- the -- this group of 15 or 20 people that -- that you get\ntogether with periodically, the -- the network really, of people you knew as a young man.\nDo you talk about the past at all, or just -- you -- you accept that you had a common past\nthat is not as pleasant as you might like and just get on with it?",
        "A: No, we talk about the past. We talk about the past. In fact, I have a group of people\nwith whom I used to get together. In fact, no-not -- not in the last few years, but that was\nthe -- they were the members of that Bellsky Brigade, if you know. Y-You probably\nheard about them. We used to meet socially, a-as much as once a week to play cards. But\nthen again, I was neighbors with the Bellsky\u2019s for 20 years and I didn\u2019t even know that\nthey were there. And then someone came from Israel, or someone came and I found out\nthat they li -- they w -- who they are and where they are. Otherwise, I just -- see, through\nmy wife, we had -- we had a group -- my wife was very active in the Hadassah. She was\na groo -- not a ch -- I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s a ch -- ke -- se -- a chapter or a group? The -- The\nsmallest thing, president for awhile. And those women, together, we were active social --\nsocially together. Usually going to shows, going to -- having like little meetings together\nand so on. Going out socially. That kept me busy. I was in a consulting -- a -- I was not\non the job at the time. I was in the consulting business and I also had the -- no fault of my\nown, I ended up with a -- owning a liquor store in Brooklyn. That was an inheritance. My\nwife\u2019s father, he bought, after he -- after he retired, or -- liquidated a liquor -- the -- his --\n[indecipherable] his business, he bought a liquor store, because his son had no skill of\nany kind. He got angry at his father, so he went and joined the army, volunteered. So he\nbought the liquor store in Brooklyn, supposedly to leave it for his son. So they ran it\ntogether and then when he died, the father -- the father-in-law, he must have had a half a\ndozen heart attacks. I mean, he was a very sick man and his son did not help him. My dau\n-- My wife and her brother inherited it. Then, I had to help him run, because he didn\u2019t\nknow anything about it. On major holidays, I -- you know, I had to go in and see what\u2019s\ngoing on. And then he decided -- my brother-in-law, that it\u2019s -- that California grass 1s\ngreener than new -- than new -- than Brooklyn, and that\u2019s through his brother-in-law, his\nwite\u2019s brother. He packed up one day, he says, \u201cYour,\u201d -- while my wife was un -- going\n-- having chemotherapy, that, \u201c\u201cYou\u2019ll have to buy me out and I -- I\u2019m leaving.\u201d I could\nnot sell the store at the time, there was no market for liquor stores. So I bought him out, I\nkept the store. Fortunately I -- I had a consulting business, I was a c-consulting engineer\nin my field. So my time was my own, basically. I could schedule my time the way I\nwanted and I had a good absentee manager. So I ran the store, in Bed-Stuy, too. At that\ntime, it was called -- called Crown Heights. It\u2019s on the outskirts of Crown Height -- Saint\nJohn\u2019s Street, that\u2019s a -- I don\u2019t know, if it isn\u2019t bates -- Bed-Stuy, nothing is.

        "Q: Well, for ga -- I mean -- give you an example. When you talked about your\ndisappointment with your children, you mentioned specifically that your daughter\nmarried an Italian, and that your son\u2019s wife was raising the children to be Episcopalian.",
        "A: Iam not -- That doesn\u2019t make me prejudice, I accepted it. I accepted it and I lived with\nit and I live -- I -- I -- I mean, one is getting divorced, but the other one, I\u2019m going to live\nwith it. I love him just as much. I don\u2019t deny him anything and I\u2019m not going to do\nanything that\u2019s going to hurt them or harm them. I would prefer otherwise.

        "Q: How about the politics of this country after you came here? Not long after you came,\nthere was McCarthyism.

        "A: I have never participated in any expression of feeling. That\u2019s one thing. The second\nthing, I have never -- I have never expressed it.

I have never expressed it, I have\nnever participated in it and I -- of course I -- I could not -- I was always for the om --\noppressed minority. However, to me the minorities, at times, they were asking too much\nand they were too violent. During the riots of \u201868, or whene -- the -- whenever it was,\nduring the Blackout in New York, they came to my liquor store with had -- which had a -\n- a harmonica type gate. Not a -- Not a pull down gate, I -- I do -- I don\u2019t know how to\ndescribe it. You could see through it. They came with a station wagon and a chain to pull\nthe gate off to rob the store.

And I feel that democrats have\nmore primaries than the republicans. So at least I can express my opinion twice, in the\nprimary and voting. Republicans had no primaries, so what\u2019s the sense of being a\nrepublican? Or being a registered republican?",

        "A: To me, there was a routine. I mean, I live here, I like this country, I might as well\nbecome part of it. Just like I have -- by being a part of it, I -- I remember when I came, I\nused to sit in my -- in a study room in the frat house and we had out there, the dorm --\nwas a big roo -- dorm on top. Then, two or three kids had little study rooms where you\ncould sit down and study with the -- with something, where you can lie down to rest if\nyou wanted to, with earphones, listening to the radio. Not to listen to anything, but to get\nused to the sound of the language. Because I think the hardest part in studying any\nlanguage is to know when one word ends and the other one starts. To be able to separate\nthe words and the sounds. Wh-Wh-What\u2019s a word? So I used to just listen to the radio\nand once I start thinking in the foreign languages that I -- that I knew at the one -- at the -\n- at the time, I felt that I really became a -- a -- a citizen of this country. And then again,\nhaving an American born wife, having children that went to school in here, I mean, they\ngrew up in here. And I have never tried to communicate with my wife or -- with my wife\nbeing present, with some other -- using any other language. I felt it\u2019s an insult. Even if it\nwas completely innocent, I would tell her. At times, when we were in Italy, for example,\nI used to tell her first what I\u2019m going to say. Or after I said, I used to tell her what I said,\nif she did -- because otherwise, I felt it was an insult.",

I said to him, \u201cCome on,\nI lived here -- I lived in Rome for a year and a half. I know how to go. You better go the\nright way.\u201d And I told my wife what I said to him. You never saw a more embarrassed\ntaxi driver. He thought he was going to take me for a ride.",

        "A: No, I refused to go back to Poland. I refused to go back to my hometown, which is\nBelarus and I know people that went there. I have a movie -- a film -- a videotape of\npeople that -- that did, in my hometown. It\u2019s completely unrecognizable. It\u2019s beyond\ncomprehension what happened to it. The Russians and the Germans had a major artiller --\nartillery duel and all of downtown, which used to be Jewish, of course, like in all tow --\nlittle towns, was completely destroyed, it does not exist. It\u2019s a field now. When the\nRussians came, they built a housing complex, they didn\u2019t know where. It turned out they\nbuilt it over a Jewish cemetery. Because all the markings and gravestones were removed.\nAnd it was a slab, not a -- a foundation, not a basement, because if they had a ba-\nbasement, they would have dug and they would have found the caskets. Nothing. They --\nPeople that were there, told me there is nothing to see. And then I had another\nexperience. In Lvov, right after the war, that must have been August of \u201844, by accident I\nbumped into one of the -- one of my friends from my town, who was a musician. Another\nfriend of mine used to -- ha -- owned a bakery, coffee shop -- I don\u2019t -- cafe, where you\ncould go in the back, have a cup of -- cup of coffee and pastry and even dancing the -- in\nthe afternoon. There was an orchestra of a father and son. The son used to play the\naccordion. That son saved himself, ended up in the USO of the Russian army. And I\nbumped into him on the market in Lvov. I looked at him, he looked at me, I said, \u201cI know\nyou.\u201d And he says, \u201cI know you, too.\u201d Said, \u201cAre you,\u201d and I mentioned his name and he\nsaid, \u201cYeah.\u201d I says and he recognized me too. You know, it was just a few years, but a\nfew years of tough a life. He said he was just coming from that front. He went through\nDeeta, there was absolutely nothing left. There is nobody left. He told me who survived.\nMy family, completely wiped out, completely disappeared. There is absolutely nobody\nfrom my family. So I didn\u2019t go there. My mother said to me, \u201cWhat are you going to go\nfor?\u201d Later -- Later I found out something very tragic and very disturbing. My\ngrandparents were quite wealthy. They were banished from my town to a small place,\nbecause it was too close to the border, so the Russians banished them and they had to\nmove out from there. But once the ghetto started, they were able to move back. And they\nhad quite a bundle of dollars, gold, jewelry, gold coins. So they buried it somewhere.\nThey were killed on the beginning, because the Germans procedure, what you called, was\nto get rid of the old ones first. Kill the old ones first and the very young ones, the babies.\nGet as much as you can out of the middle age and young and exterminate them in the --\nin the -- the way -- the way they did it. By hunger, starvation, sickness or whatever th --\nwhatever they did. My aunt -- My -- The youngest sister, my mother\u2019s youngest sister,\nthe youngest one in the family. She married and they had a little girl. The girl at that time\nwas about six or seven years old. They knew where the stuff was buried. They were in\nthe ghetto and my aunt\u2019s husband, my uncle, was an accountant, a very able man,\nextremely able man. Very, very, very a -- from a poor family, what you would call. He\nmarried into a rich family, but believe me, he was extremely able and -- and they got a\nbargain. You know, at that time, you -- wa -- you try to marry someone off, it was love,\nall -- you want more coffee?",

        "A: So I was talking about my aunt and uncle and their little girl. My uncle thought\nsomehow that he can buy up the German guy, with whom he made friends -- dragono -- I\ndon\u2019t know what -- what he thought they would let him do, because many, or rather some\nfrom that area went into the swamps, which were surround -- which were not too far,\nwith the Russian partisans or with the underground. He\u2019d -- I don\u2019t think he\u2019d believed in\nit. So he thought he was going -- tha-that he would be able to bribe the German and he\nwill let him I -- I don\u2019t know what. Anyway, they took him -- He and my aunt, took him -\n- took the German guy to the place where the things were hidden. They dug it up and on\nthe spot, the Germans shot them both, killed them both. That\u2019s a hearsay from people that\ntell me that. He shot the little girl, but he wounded her. She was killed in -- in a massacre\nthat -- in a subsequent ghetto liquidation thing.

        "Q: What is your feeling toward African-Americans applying Holocaust to slavery?",
        "A: I see no relation between it. I absolutely see no relation to it -- to it. Because, frankly,\nfrom what I read and from what I -- I mean, I wasn\u2019t there before, I read, the major\nsinners of slavery were African -- were Africans themselves, were Black people\nthemselves. They were selling their brothers and sisters into slavery. It was not just that\nthe White man -- the -- maybe the White man started, but they -- they took advantage of\nthe situation also. They were -- They perfetrated lot of slavery themselves.",
        "Q: Cause there\u2019s a lot of -- of course, people holding Jews responsible for much of the\nactivities of slavery. As being slave holders and slave sellers, and -- business people.",
        "A: Jews were not slave holders. To be a slave holder, you\u2019ve -- you have to be a land\nowner. Jews, by nature were never land owners.",

        "A: That could have -- I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s quite possible that occasionally there could have\nbeen Jews, but there were so -- by the same token there were Christians, and there were\nEpiscopalians and there were Baptists and you name any reli - and Moslems, they are\nnow. There are plenty of Moslems now that are slave owners, and why don\u2019t they go\nagainst them? If Jews were -- Jews did many things, not by choice, by force, because they\nhad -- they couldn\u2019t do anything else. All the other ones, they have a choice. There are\ncertain za -- from what I have learned from history that there are -- there are certain\nprofessions like moneylending for example, whi-whic-which with Jews are associated,\nthat were forced upon the Jews. They -- Jews didn\u2019t do it by choice. In fact, they became\nmoneylenders after they were expelled from the old land of I-Israel or whatever you call\nit. When they were put into the D-Diaspora. When they were prohibited from certain\ntrades, from certain professions, from owning land and so on. From being n-normal\npeople. Am I right? That\u2019s my strong feeling.",
        "Q: Who do you feel was or were the most important people in shaping you as you were a\nyoung man and as you are now?",
        "A: I grew up basically on my own. I had more freedom than many of my friends and I am\ntalking about the years from let\u2019s say 13 - 14, til 18. The critical years, I would call them,\nin growing up and shaking -- shaping character. Because my mother was in the United\nStates. My grandparents didn\u2019t bother me. My aunt used to go to school ba -- more or less\nto get my reports from school. I was more or less on my own. However, the value of\neducation was always stressed to me by everyone concerned. Also, my uncle and aunt,\nwe had a super radio at home, where I used to love to listen to n-not -- there was no rock\nand roll at that time, but I call classical music good music and also, to a lot of foreign\nstations, by even trying to guess what language they are speaking and what are they\ntalking about. I was exposed to many ideologists at the time, because I could listen to the\nSoviet Union direct, on radio, to their propaganda without being affected. I was exposed\nto the Zionist trend, to both sides, thi -- what you would call Labor and Likud. I would\ncall myself at the time, as the young -- young intel -- Jewish intellectual. I know that\nwhen my aunt and uncle, when their -- they -- their friends used to come, there was no\ndrinking, there was no noise, there were usually serious discussions, which if I didn\u2019t\nparticipate, I listened to. Political discussions, what\u2019s going on 1n the world. They were\ntalking about the situation -- about -- or the rise of Hitler. The rise -- What\u2019s going on in\nFrance, what\u2019s going on in England. About the Soviet Union, about Stalin\u2019s purges. This\nhad to leave some sort of a re-residue in -- in my mind. I could not participate, I was too\nyoung for them. They were older and they wouldn\u2019t listen to what I had to say. With my\nfriends, we used to get together, or -- or play cards or -- or -- or joke around. But never\nanything malicious. No malicious jokes, no malicious mischief. Maybe that\u2019s why those\nfriendship lasted that long. It was -- I would call the -- a lot of -- had a lot of good time\ntogether and strange -- strange enough, the group consisted -- I would -- more than 99\npercent it was purely Jewish. E-Even when -- Ev-Even if our parents, or rather the\ngeneration above us, hardly knew each other, the children could have been friends. In\nmany cases, the friendship -- the ch -- the children\u2019s friendship originated with the\nparent\u2019s friendship, or even grandparents friendship, but there were many friends in our\ngroup where the older generation hardly knew each other.",
        "Q: Who are the people in the photograph behind you?",

That picture was given to me by --\nwhen I was in Israel, they -- my uncle had it and he gave it to me. That was -- The reason\nfor this picture is this uncle, in the background, went to Palestine in 1926. He came back,\nI think in \u201828, for a visit. And that\u2019s when they went and they took this picture. My\ngrandmother was so upset that she had a stroke after that, from which she recovered. She\nwas partially paralyzed on one side.

        "A: At the time, no. But recently I went to the Statue of Liberty and to Ellis Island, a few\nyears ago. And it is strange, but I drew a complete blank, I still have a complete blank,\nwhere I was these two days. What did I eat? Where did I sleep?

        "Q: Okay, great.",
        "A: Pll see what I have. [inaudible]. Okay, one thing I want to mention, which 1s maybe I\nwas forced into my educational backgrounds, trying to learn things and trying to -- to\nstudy. My family, when I was growing up, kept me sort of isolated from the business end.\nMy grandfather had a -- together with -- with other partners, they had a major wholesale\nbusiness, a hardware wholesale in -- in -- in -- in our town. They had some factories,\nsome other interests and so on. I was never involved, never introduced to the business\nend of the whole thing. So, actually, to start something on my own, to go and earn a\nliving, I didn\u2019t know how to do it. It was -- I -- I bi -- I -- I -- I was afraid. The only thing\nI knew 1s more or less how to offer my services and let someone else take advantage of\nme. I didn\u2019t know how to start a business, how to run a business, how to buy and sell and\nmaybe I was afraid that someone will take advantage of me. That\u2019s why I -- I\u2019ve -- I --I\nthought that if I pursue an education, we -- if I try to learn things, I might be able,\nthrough there -- offer my services to the highest bidder, in a way. That\u2019s what it boils\ndown to.",
        "Q: Did you find that you combined your education, the formal education you got with\nwhat we would now call your street education, with your great ability to finagle?",
        "A: Yes. I think I did. I think I did. First of all, I was running a business, a division of a\ncompany. Eventually I had to give it up, because the president of the company died. In\nsfite the fact -- 1n spite the fact that they went on the stock market at one time, then they\nhad to withdraw because the thing ca -- became too small. It was a family affair and there\nwas no room where to advance. It\u2019s -- The family took it over and it became sort of a\nstagnant. Then I was able to run a business, a retail business in a -- basically in 99\npercent, at that time Black area -- Afro-American area -- you want to ca -- any way you\nwant to call it, and bees -- be halfway successful. Because I think I was liked out there by\nmy people with whom I made nice friendships. We knew each other quite well and it\ntranslated into good business and to them into good service. And we were friendly -- fr-\nfriends with each other, supportive of each other in a way. I mean, they needed help, I\nneeded help. My help was one way, their help was moral support and sometimes\nfinancial support and we -- we sort of survived. Maybe that what -- that -- that helped me.\nI tried to combine both. I don\u2019t say I am successful, but I became -- whatever I have now,\nno one gave it to me. I had to start absolutely from scratch. The only basic inheritance\nwas my wife\u2019s, you know, the end of the liquor store, which I had to pay my -- pay out\nmy brother-in-law, cause he decided he -- he wanted -- decided to go to California.\nUnfortunately, he passed on.

        "A: I think so. I think so. It\u2019s -- My problem was, when I came here -- and I came on a\nscholarship -- I was studying in Italy and I feel -- you\u2019Il find my history of studies, what I\nhave started in -- in 1940, under Stalin, in Lvov, then I went to school again in 1944, after\nbeing liberated. After the ghetto experiences and hiding, I sort of saved myself by going\nto school instead of being forced to go into the Russian army and become artillery meat. I\nhad no other, basically, I -- I had nothing in my background that would prepare me to ma\n-- for th -- 1-1-1 -- to survive, to make a living. My family was quite wealthy and they sort\nof isolated me from normal life. I was not in touch with business. The only thing I knew\nis more or less engineering and education. So I just kept going and I pursued the -- the\ncareer in engineering by going in Lvov and then being accepted in Turin, in Italy.",
        "A: This was my crutch for survival. That\u2019s what -- Basically, that\u2019s what helped me\nsurvive, also. In looking back, when we left my hometown Lida, in 1940, and went to\nLvov, the reason why we went to Lvov, there were two-fold reasons, basically. One, that\nmy mother and myself, we were able to get the Russian passports -- acceptable Russian\npassports. By that, meaning that our occupation -- my occupation became student and my\nmother\u2019s occupation becau -- became a working person, robotche. In spite the fact that\nwe were Capitalists, according to the definition of USSR at that time. The reason why we\npicked Lvov, because I wanted to go to Vilna. But Vilna had not polytechnic institute.\nAnd Vilna got separated from Lida, because at that time, they made a separate country\nout of Lithuania. That would have meant crossing a border and difficulty in getting in\ntouch with the family. So, we picked Lvov, where we could sort of disappear. Lvov,\nnormally a city of 150,000, at that time had maybe 300,000, with all the refugees coming\nfrom Krakow, from Warsaw. It was on the Russian side of the divided Poland, from the --\nafter \u201839. And I was able to -- I was accepted to the non -- the pothip -- to the Polytechnic\nInstitute. And that was my crutch, I figured I can -- I ha -- I have no other background -- I\nhave nothing in my background that will allow me to make a living. I had to be on my\nown. Fortunately, the Russians were offering scholarships. Top students were getting a --\nthe -- a -- it\u2019s not a scholarship, a stipend -- a living allowance and coupons where you\ncould buy things or you could purchase things. And I -- I have looked -- I have my -- the\nbooklet where they have entered my grades and I have never anything -- I never had\nanything below a B -- what you would call B in here. Fact, I don\u2019t think I had any B\u2019s, I\nhad all A\u2019s.",
        "A: Not I kept it. I don\u2019t -- I have -- I have it, because when I came back in \u201844, it was\nstrange, but the Germans, during their occupations, they destroyed the Polish\nintelligentsia -- I mean, they killed the Polish professors. In fact, they did it before the\nkilled the Jews, they killed the Polish -- the Polish professors in Lvov. But the-they --\nLvov itself was not bombed, was not destroyed. So the archives of the Polytechnic\nInstitute remained intact. And that was the reason why I was accepted, because they had\neverything on file, including my photographs, I could not claim that I was someone else.\nAnd when they issued me the booklet where you enter the grades, they entered -- I s -- I\nstill have it. If you want to look at it, I can show it to you. You do want?",

In\n\u201845, I could have identifications paper on me without being afraid that somebody c -- that\nPll -- it\u2019ll give me away. However, there were times where I -- where ID papers were\ncritical and I had to hide them. But I was never searched. See, here 1s \u201844 - \u201845, this is the\nend of it. You can see when I had the last tests. The six -- six 1n there, that\u2019s June, the\nsixth month. See they -- they use Roman numerals for the month, 16 is the day.

        "A: My mother was in the US already. See, I have mentioned to you that my mother was\nmarried to an American citizen. However, she never became a citizen, because she had\nproperty in Poland and in order to hey -- to save the property, she had to be a Polish\ncitizen. When she came in 1938 to liquidate the property, the war broke up 1n thir --\nbroke out in \u201839. She had what she -- was called a re-entry permit for the United States,\nbut not a citizenship. She did not want to become a citizen because she was married to\ncitizen. So she had a re-entry permit, which was never honored by the Germans. She\nshowed it to them, it did not help. You\u2019re Jewish no matter what. It didn\u2019t do any good.\nYou\u2019re not an American citizen, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s what counted. But she went -- when --\nwhen we ended up, after th -- our odyssey, in Italy, she went to the American consul, I\nthink it was in Rome. And he said, I cannot honor it, because you\u2019Il come to the States,\nyou'll be a burden. Somebody has to send you an affidavit. If you -- you get an affidavit,\ntogether with a re-entry permit, you'll -- I\u2019ll issue you a -- a -- a permit -- a visa\nimmediate -- not a visa, an entry visa, immediately. She had some friends in here that she\n-- from before, they send her an affidavit and she left -- I\u2019m trying to think, it was late in\n\u201846, I think. In \u201846, or -- in the fall of 1946, she left for the United States and she was\nhere. In the meantime, I was able to enroll myself, the tur -- University of tur --\nPolytechnic Institute in Turin. And that was quite an odyssey also, cause Italian\nuniversities are quite strange. They don\u2019t accept you. In svite -- in spite the -- the fact that\nthey gave me credit for this -- for a -- the -- Lvov Polytechnic Institute, they would not\naccept me unless I could show them th -- my original high school diploma. Of course, I\ndidn\u2019t have it with me. The high school diploma was in Lvov. Lvov was in the Soviet\nUnion. There was absolutely no way how I could get it. And then, I never thought, when\nI left Lvov, to go to the bursar and ask him gave me my high school diploma. They\nwouldn\u2019t have given it to me anyway. I was able to find, through some friends, my last\nhigh school principal, from my home town. And because our graduating class was only\n30-odd people, he did remember me. He was an official in the Ministry of Education.\nAnd he send me a document, which looked more official -- he asked me, \u201cWhat kind of\ngrades do you want me to put on there?\u201d I said, \u201cPut whatever you want, I don\u2019t care, as\nlong as I have the diploma.\u201d He says, \u201cI know that you passed, but I don\u2019t remember the\ngrades.\u201d I said, \u201cPut anything you want.\u201d The document looked more official than the\nactual high school diploma. The matura in pol -- from Poland, that I have received it in --\nin \u201839, and I was the last graduating class b-before the war. And on that basis, I was\naccepted at the Turin Polytechnic Institute.",
        "A: No. It was quite difficult. You had to study with that vocabulary, with the dictionary.\nPolish Italian on one side, and the -- and the text book on the other side. In spite the fact\nthat I was in Italy from late \u201c45 - \u201846 - \u201847, it\u2019s actually almost two and a half years, we\nwere always sort of separated from the Italian population.

But the\nYiddish was the universal language. And it ca -- and I felt sorry for myself, because I --\nwhen my mother was away in the United States, I lived with my grandparents. My\ngrandmother and my grandfather, they spoke of course Yiddish between themselves. But\nwhen it came to speak to me, they broke their tongue and they spoke Polish.

My mother and father -- I was only 10\nyears old when my father died, they spoke Russian between themselves. And it\u2019s strange,\nbut my mother\u2019s friends, they spoke Russian between themselves also. The reason,\nbecause they grew up and they -- my mother was unusual for her generation. She had a\nhigh school diploma from Russia -- from Czarist Russia. And at that time, a high school\ndiploma for a woman, it\u2019s like a Master\u2019s degree in college now.

        "A: Yes.\nchallenge authority at certain times and get away with it. And you did it constantly, it\nseems like. You found the way around things, around people, around situations.",
        "A: You had to, that was the only way how to survive.",
        "A: Maybe, I don\u2019t know. I never had any brothers or sister, I never had anybody that I\ncould basically share my thoughts and my -- to the fullest. Even my closest friend, my\nwife, at times didn\u2019t understand me and didn\u2019t know what was actually guiding me, what\nwas pushing me. Cause, remember, I came here in \u201848, with a minimum knowledge of\nEnglish. Absolutely minimum. And I -- all of a sudden, I became an upper junior at the\nUniversity of Illinois, living in an all American bo -- fra -- fraternity house with a bunch\nof spoiled -- basically spoiled kids.",
        "A: A friend of mine, at the time. We -- We know each other, but I haven\u2019t spoken to this\nman in 40 years. We exchange New Year\u2019s cards twice a year, for the Jewish New Year\nand for -- for Happy Holidays around Christmas time. We exchange cards and that\u2019s as\nfar as we go. We lived together in Turin. The American Jewish Distribution Committee\ncreated a student home in Turin, where we had, I think 40 - 50 students living there. In\nfact, we already -- we had -- think I had two reunions in -- here in the United States. I am\nin touch with some of the people that I met there, that we lived together. He was -- He\ncould have been more aggressive than I at the time, but he got in touch with the Hillel\nFoundation in Chicago.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. Probably through somebody. He start writing to them and I remember\nthe woman\u2019s name, Marilyn Applebaum, and he was accepted to the Virginia Polytechnic\nInstitute. I said, \u201cLet me try, too.\u201d I started to write to Marilyn and through Hillel\nFoundation, I was accepted at the University of Illinois, the fraternity -- my fraternity,\nTau Delta Phi, gave me free room and board. The Hillel Foundation was paying to the\nuniversity for my -- the tuitions and books. And I think, if I remember right, they gave\nme something like 30 dollars every three months, allowance.",

        "A: No. There was a po -- time in my life what I didn\u2019t know what time it was. I had a\nwristwatch and that\u2019s -- that\u2019s it, that at times wasn\u2019t working properly.",
        "A: When we were hiding in the cellar. Time of -- was of no essence. Is just a matter of\nsurviving and especially when we were in a complete darkness for days.",
        "A: I -- \u2019m going to tell you something that I had never told anyone else, basically. I\nmean, now, we are going off on a tangent, you were asking me some o -- some other\nthings, but we are going off on a -- on a tangent. When we were in hiding, and there were\n11 of us, there was one man, my mother\u2019s age, roughly. There was an older woman by\nherself. There was my mother and myself, that\u2019s four. And then there was a Hashidisha\nfamily of seven. One of the men, that man that was there, my mother\u2019s age, he had a gun\nand I had a gun. After the Pole was arrested -- the man that was hiding us, he -- the\nGermans -- I mean there was a trial and all that and supposedly they had to confiscate all\nof his property and the people -- the -- the -- th-the -- the -- the people that were actual --\nthat were removing the property from the basement and from the house, were the leftover\nJews from the Yanoffska concentration camp. Remember, that was already -- that was\nearly 1944. Ghetto was already liquidated, there was nothing in existence. In fact, I have\na book by -- I forgot his first name, Wells, Villigeker, where he describes -- he 1s -- he\nwas one of the people that was on Yanoffska Street at that time. He describes his\nexperiences and it\u2019s strange how he actually is telling me things that I -- that I -- that I\nhave lived through. When they were removing the properties, that man could not take it\nany more, and we had to let him out. He went on the outside and he perished. He must\nhave gotten caught. We survived. Now, the time when we were there, the experiences of\nhiding in that little hole and the relationship between the peoples, how we interacted, how\nwe behaved toward each other, I wanted to write a play or write a book. I never had --\nwhenever I thought about it, I never had enough words. I cou -- I could not describe it,\nbecause it was absolutely unbelievable how the children were -- had a pillow ready to\nsmother their old man because he was deaf and deaf people don\u2019t know how ca -- how\nloud they are. How the Germans were on one side of the wall and we were on the other\nside of the wall and we heard them hit and yell and -- and scream at the Jewish boys\nwhich were out there. We -- We assumed they were Jewish boys, cause we never saw\nthem. And it\u2019s strange how the box that was hiding the entrance, to-together with that\npole I have pa -- we have painted bricks on it, so it looked like bricks, that nobody\nnoticed it? Or maybe somebody noticed it and deliberately ignored it to save our lives.\nWe ne -- There are so many conflicts in there, so many possibilities, what actually\nhappened? There -- I'll never know, and it\u2019s bothering me. I -- It\u2019s in my subconscious,\nbut I still try to put it out -- out of my mind, because if you ask me the names of the\npeople that were there, I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t remember their last name, and I don\u2019t\nremember their first names. The man that got out, he was fr-from our hometown. Him, I\nremember, because I remember him from before. But otherwise, the names -- it\u2019s sort of\nfu-fuzzy in my mind. The details are there, I can visualize it, but I don\u2019t feel that I have\nenough words to describe it. Now, to go back to my chutzpah. When I went to the consul\n-- to the American consul in Genoa, cause from Turin, you had to go to Genoa, and I\nshowed them that I was accepted at the University of Illinois and that was beginning of\nFebruary, of \u201848. He says to me, \u201cWhen does the semester start?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\nthey accepted me.\u201d\u2019 He made some quick checks, he says, \u201cYou know, the semester has\nalready started. If you go by boat, you have no reservations, you have no -- no way how\nto get there for at least a month. I will not give you the visa now.\u201d So I asked him, \u201cWhat\nabout if I fly?\u201d He said, \u201cDll give you the visa immediately.\u201d So I went back to the AJDC\nand I said to them, \u201cI have a commitment from the American consul.\u201d",
        "A: American Joint Distribution Committee. They were that th -- They were the ones that\nwere running the student home in Turin, and they paid for my flight on TWA, February\n15th, from Rome to Geneva. From Geneva to Shannon, Ireland. From Shannon, Ireland,\nto Newfoundland, Canada. From Newfoundland to New York.",
        "A: I think it\u2019s all within, I think 14 hours or 18 hours or something, but there were stops,\nbecause there were propeller planes, jets were not in existence, I -- at the time.",
        "A: I was afraid. I was scared what\u2019s going to happen. Will I be able to cope with an\nAmerican university? After all, my scholastic background was partly Polish, partly\nRussian, partly Ukrainian, partly Italian. Now here, I have to translate everything into\nEnglish. I didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to me. When I came to New York, in\n1948, it was Friday -- late Friday afternoon. Immigration wouldn\u2019t let me out. They said,\n\u201cSo many Jewish students, so many people are coming here on scholarships, we have to\ncheck with the university, is it true or not.\u201d They called -- I said, \u201cCall them.\u201d They called\nthem, and Friday afternoon, the offices were closed. I spend Saturday -- my mother was\nwaiting for me at the airport and that was the LaGuardia, because Kennedy was not in\nexistence. Idlewild. I said hello to her an-and I says, \u201cIll be back.\u201d What else? The\nimmigration inspector said to me, \u201cI have to take you to Ellis Island and -- but before you\ngo, I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to let you stay here or not. I have a taxi here, you are\nalone, let me give you a tour of New York.\u201d So we went riding around New York, he\nshowed me -- and the Empire State Building, and the thing that really stuck in my mind\nwas the Fulton Fish Market. Like a major attraction in New York at the time. I spent on\nEllis Island, Saturday and Sunday. Monday morning they called University of Illinois and\nthey apologized to me and they let me out. I stood with my mother for two weeks in New\nYork. I didn\u2019t go right away. What\u2019s the hurry? I wanted to see New York, I wanted to\nspend time with her.",
        "A: At that time, about a year and a half.",
        "A: In a way, I was disappointed. I was disappointed because that -- she was -- the kind of\nwork she was doing.",
        "A: She was a waitress at the resorts and -- in the Catskills. She had no professions. She\nspoke the language, but not that well that she could have an office job. She was a middle-\naged woman. She was -- She was in her early 40\u2019s. My mother was exactly about 20\nyears older than I am. That was the only thing that she could do and actually make a\ndecent living out of it. Her husband died, in the meantime, while she was in -- in Poland,\nhe died here. And his family sort of disappeared, they -- th-they disowned her and th-they\ndidn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t want to know about her, nothing. I mean, she was completely on her\nbu -- on her own, by herself, with -- the only friend that she had was that woman that I\nmentioned before, that Sarah k -- Sarah Kaplan, that was the wife of a -- of a relative and\nso on. It\u2019s not a relative, I don\u2019t know. She was the only -- She was the only friend that\nshe had at the time.",
        "A: My mother had an apartment together with her sister and her sister\u2019s husband. That\u2019s\nanother pa -- That\u2019s another interesting story. My mother had -- What\u2019d they have? Two\nbrothers and two sisters. There were five of them. In fact, just about a month ago, they\ncalled me from Israel that my uncle has pa -- had died, at 93 or 94. He left for Palestine in\nthe -- in \u201828, I think, or \u201827. 1927. He was one of the original Halitseem, [indecipherable]\nPalestine.",
        "A: Yes, I did. However, I wanted to go there after I got -- after I have gotten some sort of\na profession. To come there without any skills, without knowing the language -- the\nHebrew -- I mean, I have the basic knowledge of Hebrew. You know, when they -- you\nget prepared for Bar Mitzvah, I had a -- I -- I -- someone teach me, and -- but I never\nwent to -- to the Hebrew school. There was a Hebrew school in my town, Talbud. I never\nwent to the Hebrew school. So I never -- I was never prepared for Palestine.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes. We -- That\u2019s another pa -- another story, but her sister and her hus --\nher husband, the sister\u2019s husband and the sister, they were sort of distant cousins. To\nmarry, they had to get a permission from a rabbi, because they were relat -- they never\nhad any -- they never had any children anyway, so it didn\u2019t matter. He was a chemical\nengineer, a very able chemical engineer, who built one of the major rubber factories in\nPoland and got pushed out by other people who sort of took it over. Then he went abroad\nand built a factory, I think, a rubber factory in Greece, a rubber factory in France. He had\na French ler -- French degree, a degree from Toulouse, I think. Eventually, he settled in\nmy -- on our hometown, and he and -- with his brother, made -- b-built a factory where\nthey used to make rubber heels for shoes. In spite the fact that factory was small and\nbasically the two of -- I don\u2019t know how many they employed, but owning a factory\nmade them Capitalists. So when the Russians came in, the thing got nationalized and they\nhad to escape. They went to Vilna and they were one of the 8,000 that got the visas from\nthe Japanese c-consul in Kovno. I think you heard of -- I forgot his name. They ended up\nin Japan, in -- rather in Shanghai, but because they were skilled -- they were both\nengineers, Canada accepted them. So they ended up in \u201840 -- in the early 40\u2019s, they ended\nup in Canada. From Canada, they came to the States. My aunt was left in Lida to\nliquidate the property. She was selling whatev -- whatever they had 1n the -- in the house.\nThe furniture, the clothe -- pardon me, the clothing, and all the other things. So then\nwhen they -- Russia closed the border with Lithuania, they had to cross the border to go\ninto Vilna. The husband was still there and she and a number of other peoples got caught\non the border -- the border, arrested by the KGB. Within two days or three days, there\nwas a trial and they were sentenced to deportation to Kazakstan, which 1n a -- the long\nrun, saved her life. In fact, his father -- my uncle\u2019s father -- father was arrested not at the\nsame time, but arrested also and sent to the same area of Kazakstan, and my aunt was\nthere with his fa -- with her father-in-law, who died there. But when she was in -- when\nshe was in -- in Kazakstan, she survived the war over there and in \u201845, she came to Lvov.\nFrom Lvov, she was able to go, somehow, to France or I don\u2019t know, I -- I -- I don\u2019t\nremember the details of her story, but she ended up in the United States, because her\nhusband was here, before my mother came there. They had an apartment on Newkirk\nAvenue, in a building which is basically -- last time I saw it, it was abandoned. It was a\nfour story walk-up. Newkirk and East 21st Street. And my mother got a room out there,\nwith them. I think 1t was a two bedroom or a three bedroom apartment, on the top floor.",
        "A: That\u2019s where I stood with her, right. For the couple of weeks. Then I went to the\nUniversity of Illinois. I was with the -- in the fraternity.",
        "A: Go ahead.",
        "A: I was looking to get away from the uncertainty -- uncertainty, to start building my life,\nto get some sort of a profession where I could -- where I know if I cannot do it -- if I\ncannot work for myself -- be on my own, is work for someone in a productive capacity.\nMy father was an engineer. He -- An engineer basically without money. But he had the\nskills. The family put up the money, he was running the foundry that they had. He made a\n-- I loved to go there and watch how they melted the iron, how they cast the -- the -- the -\n- the plows and the -- the agricultural -- the equipment that they were building there, how\nthey machined it, what -- e-everything they did. And I was only a little baby at the time,\nbut I loved to watch it. That sort of instilled in me, the a -- the -- the -- the love for\nengineering, love for being able to create something with your own hands. That\u2019s why I\nput so many things together.",
        "A: That was a lifesaver, because it gave it gave us a lot of information.",

        "A: Us? I consider us Americans. I consider myself now as a full pledged citizen of this\ncountry, with some loyalties maybe stretching far. I support Israel, but I am not one of\nthose that will say that because Israeli want it, it\u2019s foolproof and it has to be that way. I\nlove to read -- on the internet, I read the Israeli papers. The Haaretz and the Jerusalem\nPost. I look at them every single day. I have a computer in the other room, gift from my\nson. I don\u2019t know how he became so proficient in computers, but he must have six of\nthem in his house. In fact, when I have a problem, I call my youngest granddaughter to\ntell me. At eight, she knows more than I do.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember how I felt. I felt sort of liberated. If I got out of this, that I am going\nsomewhere. I did not see any future studying, finishing my engineering career in Italy. It\nwas sort of you gi -- you get a degree and what do you do with it afterwards? You are\nsort of -- it\u2019s like a dead end education. I could not see myself competing with Italians in\n-- even in my profession. I had to get out somewhere where I could have more freedom. I\nhad -- my knowledge of Italian was basically small. It was -- I could converse, but I was\nnot fluent in it. I's -- I didn\u2019t come to a point where I was thinking in Italian.

Sort of, y-you can do\nsomething. Where, out there, what would I do?",
        "A: I did not experience any anti-Semitism in Italy. Maybe because I didn\u2019t know who\nwas Jewish and who was not. It came to a point where I was so stupid that I was talking\nto someone whose last name was -- I remember now, Suchadotti and I asked him, \u201cAre\nyou Jewish?\u201d He says, \u201cOf course.\u201d I didn\u2019t realize that Suchadotti in Italian, is Cohen in\nEnglish, or Kaplan, or -- there are certain names that imply who you are, and I was so\nignorant, I didn\u2019t even know that. And then, again, I was in a circle with people who\nwere of my own background, who were in Italy temporarily. It was sort of like a weigh\nstation. You were there for the next year, two, three, four, but no one actually was\nplanning on settling and staying in Italy.",

So you had to go to an area -- they\nwere sending them into Displaced Person camps in Germany, around Munich, Salzburg,\nin Austria or Italy, with the idea of having these people available to col -- to -- to send to\nPalestine whenever things became possible. That\u2019s when Exodus started, the ship. In fact,\nmany of the people that I knew ended up on Cyprus, because they were caught.",
        "A: You just knew it, you just knew it, that\u2019s all. One of the people that was -- one of the\nmen who was stationed at that time in Prague, lives in New York now and we went --\nthrough him -- he was a man -- he was a -- from my hometown, so I knew him. And\nthat\u2019s where 1t came 1n with the different papers, with the different nationalities that we\nwere impersonating at the time, to confuse the border guards, to show -- they -- I am sure\nthey knew about it, but they had to have the legal papers to allow us to travel. After all, it\nwas such a drop in the bucket, of people that were traveling, of displaced people that\nwere moving. Just didn\u2019t mean anything. I -- I remember when we were stopped, I think\nit was in Salzburg and Innsbruck, our tr -- we were on a train, traveling -- we were\ntraveling in the direction of Italy and there was an American train traveling in the\nopposite direction, with American soldiers and my mother got off and she went to talk to\nsomeone.

She got -- She\nremained -- She missed the -- Our train pulled out and she re -- and she got stuck in there.\nThe next station I came, I got off and I went to talk to someone and the problem was the\nlanguage. Because, in spite of the fact that I was under Germ -- with the Germans for so\nmany years, I never spoke German and I don\u2019t speak German. And German still remains\na hated language. I found out that she ended up in Munich. So we remained in -- I think it\nwas in Salzburg, if I remember right. I remained there for an extra day or two and I --\nsomehow I was able to send word for her to come down and she came down and we got\nreunited. And, with the group of people that I was tr -- that we were together, we kept\ngoing and we ended up in Kramona, in Italy. We went through the Brenner pass, we\nended up in Italy. We were in camp in Kramona maybe three months when we decided,\nwhat\u2019s Kramona? It\u2019s a dead-end place. Let\u2019s keep on going and we\u2019re -- w-we ended up\nin a Displaced Person camp in Rome.",
        "A: Cheenacheeta. That\u2019s where th-the old movie studios.

With the UNRRA packages and with the little money\nthat you might have, rent an apartment and you will be able to live, you will able to do\nsomething. You\u2019re -- It\u2019s a -- It\u2019s again an dead end thing.\u201d So we rented a room in\nRome. We had the packages, the food packages from UNRRA to survive on. You used to\nsell some of it. I don\u2019t know where the money came from. I tried to buy things, sell\nthings, but I was never good at it. In fact, I used to go to Milan on the train and because I\nwas wearing American army fatigues, I couldn\u2019t speak English, I couldn\u2019t speak Italian, I\nused to speak like a mumbo-jumbo of something or speak -- say the few words in Italian,\ntry to imitate an -- an English accent and get away without paying the -- the -- the --\nwithout paying the fare. Go up to Milan, buy some watches, bring them back to Rome,\nsell the watches in Rome, at a profit, of course and that\u2019s how we used to make a living.\nThen again, I tried to enroll in Rome, at the University of Rome.

See, being Jewish,\nJewish boy -- Jewish -- people of Jewish persuasion, were not accepted for a higher\neducation in Poland. They had a quota, 10 percent and that\u2019s it. So, the ones that could\nafford, scattered all over Europe.

He started his search on his end. I got him, in the meantime,\nhis papers and he said to me, \u201cYou know, your old high school principal 1s in --\nconnected with the Polish Ministry of Education. See if you can write to him and maybe\nhe can do something for you.",

I remember you and the people that were with you,\u201d because, see\nhere, a graduating class -- or high school graduating classes, several thousand. We had\n30-odd people. So he remembered.

I have never worried about\npaying tuition. I don\u2019t know what happened, if they paid or they didn\u2019t pay. I was just\nenrolled and that\u2019s it.

They take attendance,\nthey ch -- you know, they check you, it\u2019s like -- you are like a kid. You had to sign your\nattendance list. If you signed it twice during a semester, you were given credit for\nattendance. You didn\u2019t have to be there. And it didn\u2019t make sense for me to be there,\nbecause I couldn\u2019t understand the lectures anyway. I had to study on my own and -- and\ntry to translate and try to memorize, try to understand it. Because even if I knew what -- if\nI knew the technical language, if I knew the course, I could not converse with the --\nduring the oral part of the exam, because I didn\u2019t understand what he was talking to me\nabout, but he was talking to me.

I was going to the marketplace, buying and selling things and I\u2019Il never forget, my\nfirst big transaction was when a Russian army truck was parked in -- a Russian soldier\ncalled me and he said to me, \u201cI have some American canned -- canned pork -- ham a --\nthe [indecipherable] cans of processed pork and I like to sell 1t.

You\nwill have to trust me.\u201d And I took two, because they were quite heavy and I couldn\u2019t\ncarry them and I had to hide them. I went to the marketplace, I sold them, I came back, I\ngave him half the money. He was very happy. And I just kept going back and forth, back\nand forth, back and forth. And I don\u2019t remember how many I sold, but I have made a lot\nof money that day. And fortunate -- fortunately, I was not arrested or caught. After that, I\nhad -- There were rumors that the Russians are going to draft all the men my age, in the\n20\u2019s, who were not in the army. I -- I knew what the Russians were going to do.

He 1s -\n- He is alive, fortunately. He is in Israel. But I was trying to avoid a situation like that, so\nI went to the Polytechnic Institute.

They accepted me and they gave me the admission.\nSo when I went back to the dra -- what you would call the draft board and I showed them\nthat I am a student which is enrolled now, they gave me a deferment. And basically I feel\nthat what saved my life. Another thing that saved my life was the fact that the\nPolytechnic Institute in Kiev was not functioning, was -- for some reason, was not\nworking. And because Lvov was working, the professors that were in Kiev came to Lvov\n-- the ones that survived -- because Lvov had no -- had no faculty. The administersth --\nthe administrative personnel was -- remained there, but there was no one to teach.

So we finally found a -- an apart -- a -- a small apartment on the outskirts\nof Lvov. He rented it to us, I don\u2019t know why. Because he was -- he knew that we were\nJewish. He knew exactly what was happening, but I have maybe developed a rapport\nwith him. On the beginning, I have -- I don\u2019t say that I did help him, but I have showed\nsome understanding in the things that he was doing. He was a builder, a -- a contractor.\nAt that time, he was already in his 60\u2019s. And I have expressed my admiration at that time\nfor the Polish leaders from the 30\u2019s, like Marshall Pilsiltski. And he was a great lover of\nPilsiltski, a great admirer. We have developed, sort of like a friendship, so that when I --\nwe le -- when we found an apartment in Lvov later and we left him, I still kept in touch --\nin touch with him. I used to go out there, walk that kilometer from the last trolley stop to\nhis shop and sort of discuss politics with him. What\u2019s going on in London, with the\nPolish government in London. What\u2019s going on in the world. So when we -- when the\nghetto became a dead end and my mother, after she came back from being 1n hiding --\nafter the Germans caught her on the way back -- they beat her up, they told her to dig her\ngrave, and because a German patrol brought out other woman -- I think I have described\nthat part -- a-another woman and that woman was shot, the -- the -- the -- the SS man let\nher go and she came ba -- she came back to the ghetto, I saw -- I went ba -- I was abl -- I\nwas working outside the ghetto, so I skipped my -- from my -- from my job -- from my\npa -- from whatever we were doing. I -- I removed the arm band and I went to talk to\nhim, would he accept -- would he accept my mother to go in hiding? Because we were\nold friends, I would call it, he said, \u201cLet me think about it. Pll give you an answer.\u201d And\neventually, on the second trip, he did accept her. I smuggled her out -- out of the ghetto\nwith my wa -- w-with my ma -- w-w-with my work detachment, what you would call it,\nthat we used to work outside the ghetto -- outside the ghetto walls. I -- I got her there -- I\ncame back to the ghetto, but when I got out of the ghetto, I went with the Polish\nunderground, with the -- with the Akar, with the army of Cryova. And when I found that\nthey were so hostile to me that I -- I ga -- I wouldn\u2019t survive with them, I went to him to\nlet me in, and he did. Maybe he took advantage of me at the time, because I was able to\nhelp him. He had, at that time already, grenades, rifles, ammunition, a short wave radio\nreceiver and transmitter, where he was communitcating with the -- the -- the Akar, the\narmy of Cryova, he was like a center post -- center point, where the army of Cr-Cryova\nwas -- was commu-communicating through him. He was one of many. On -- On the other\nhand, he was with an anti-Semitic group and he was still hiding two Jews.

There\u2019s what -- do -- they were\nof no value unless you could -- could convert them into the current currency. And in -- in\norder convert it into currency -- he didn\u2019t trust anyone in Lvov. He used to go to the walls\nof ghetto, communicate with this man that eventually came into hiding with us, that did\nnot survive. Through him, he got another woman and another family of seven that we\ndidn\u2019t know about. My mother and I didn\u2019t know about them. When I came back to my\nmother, we saw stranger -- we heard strange noises and strange shadows in the middle of\nthe night and we confronted him and then he put us all together. The -- The reason why\nwe saw those shadows and so on, because they had to go to the bathroom -- to dispose of\ntheir body waste. We had to go to dispose of the body waste into a cesspool or something\nof that sort. Or get water from the -- from the di -- from the well that he had in the ba -- in\n-- in his basement.

That -- That particular division. So, I sort of branched off\nin there and did some design. Besides running that division, I did design of e-\nenvironmental testing equipment, which was a very challenging subject. United States\nused to send up satellites and rockets into space, which used to come with all kinds of\ndata. What are the conditions in outer space? We were designing equipment that would\nsimulate the change and the condition in the outer space. So, for example, if a rocket,\nequipped with electronic equipment, would be sent up, you start with ground conditions.\nWhile it\u2019s going up, because of skin friction with air, the temperature can build up to a\ncouple of hundred degrees on the -- on the surface. But the pressure -- the va -- will\nchange and it will come up to almost absolute vacuum. But then we found out that it isn\u2019t\nso, that there is a Van Allen belt, or actually the vacuum from a high vacuum, it -- it\nchanges and there 1s a little more ionization in there. So we had to simulate it in a\nchamber. So when people were building their electronic equipment, or their products,\nthey could actually put it into a chamber and the chamber would sa -- would simulate --\nnot the fl -- the flight, but the ca -- the -- the changing conditions. So we knew -- th-those\nwere all classified data, so we knew what -- what 1s going on, how the -- how the\nconditions progress.

He even went to the -- what\nyou call the Hebrew high school at the East [indecipherable] Jewish Center. He had a\nscholarship in there and he was quite proficient. My daughter married an Italian. My\ndaughter was -- I think she was number -- in the top 10, I think she was number six or\nnumber four or something.

I was in a consulting -- a -- I was not\non the job at the time. I was in the consulting business and I also had the -- no fault of my\nown, I ended up with a -- owning a liquor store in Brooklyn. That was an inheritance. My\nwife\u2019s father, he bought, after he -- after he retired, or -- liquidated a liquor -- the -- his --\n[indecipherable] his business, he bought a liquor store, because his son had no skill of\nany kind. He got angry at his father, so he went and joined the army, volunteered. So he\nbought the liquor store in Brooklyn, supposedly to leave it for his son. So they ran it\ntogether and then when he died, the father -- the father-in-law, he must have had a half a\ndozen heart attacks. I mean, he was a very sick man and his son did not help him. My dau\n-- My wife and her brother inherited it. Then, I had to help him run, because he didn\u2019t\nknow anything about it. On major holidays, I -- you know, I had to go in and see what\u2019s\ngoing on. And then he decided -- my brother-in-law, that it\u2019s -- that California grass 1s\ngreener than new -- than new -- than Brooklyn, and that\u2019s through his brother-in-law, his\nwite\u2019s brother. He packed up one day, he says, \u201cYour,\u201d -- while my wife was un -- going\n-- having chemotherapy, that, \u201c\u201cYou\u2019ll have to buy me out and I -- I\u2019m leaving.\u201d I could\nnot sell the store at the time, there was no market for liquor stores. So I bought him out, I\nkept the store. Fortunately I -- I had a consulting business, I was a c-consulting engineer\nin my field. So my time was my own, basically. I could schedule my time the way I\nwanted and I had a good absentee manager. So I ran the store, in Bed-Stuy, too. At that\ntime, it was called -- called Crown Heights.

The Russians and the Germans had a major artiller --\nartillery duel and all of downtown, which used to be Jewish, of course, like in all tow --\nlittle towns, was completely destroyed, it does not exist. It\u2019s a field now. When the\nRussians came, they built a housing complex, they didn\u2019t know where. It turned out they\nbuilt it over a Jewish cemetery.

Another\nfriend of mine used to -- ha -- owned a bakery, coffee shop -- I don\u2019t -- cafe, where you\ncould go in the back, have a cup of -- cup of coffee and pastry and even dancing the -- in\nthe afternoon. There was an orchestra of a father and son. The son used to play the\naccordion. That son saved himself, ended up in the USO of the Russian army. And I\nbumped into him on the market in Lvov.

He told me who survived.\nMy family, completely wiped out, completely disappeared. There is absolutely nobody\nfrom my family. So I didn\u2019t go there. My mother said to me, \u201cWhat are you going to go\nfor?\u201d Later -- Later I found out something very tragic and very disturbing. My\ngrandparents were quite wealthy. They were banished from my town to a small place,\nbecause it was too close to the border, so the Russians banished them and they had to\nmove out from there. But once the ghetto started, they were able to move back. And they\nhad quite a bundle of dollars, gold, jewelry, gold coins. So they buried it somewhere.\nThey were killed on the beginning, because the Germans procedure, what you called, was\nto get rid of the old ones first. Kill the old ones first and the very young ones, the babies.\nGet as much as you can out of the middle age and young and exterminate them in the --\nin the -- the way -- the way they did it.

They were in\nthe ghetto and my aunt\u2019s husband, my uncle, was an accountant, a very able man,\nextremely able man. Very, very, very a -- from a poor family, what you would call.

It was a family affair and there\nwas no room where to advance. It\u2019s -- The family took it over and it became sort of a\nstagnant.

The only basic inheritance\nwas my wife\u2019s, you know, the end of the liquor store, which I had to pay my -- pay out\nmy brother-in-law, cause he decided he -- he wanted -- decided to go to California.\nUnfortunately, he passed on. It\u2019s -- The whole family 1s -- is dead, which is very\ndisturbing. No one to argue with.",
