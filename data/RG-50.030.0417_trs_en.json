        "Question: Good morning.",
        "Answer: Good morning.",
        "Q: It\u2019s finally nice to see you here in Washington, after all these months of waiting. So, thank\nyou for coming. Lucille, let\u2019s just start very simply tell me when you were born.",
        "A: February 1*', 1925.",
        "Q: And where were you born?",
        "A: I was born in Hamburg, Germany.",
        "Q: And your name at the time of your birth.",
        "A: Cecilia Landau.",
        "Q: So, it was Cecilia all through your childhood. When did it become Lucille?",
        "A: When I came to New York, and the abbreviation for Cecilia was Cillie, and in English it\nsounds \u201cCillie\u201d. So, somebody talked \u2014 talked me into changing the name to Lucille, Cecilia,\nand I should have just left 1t Cecilia, but it was too late.",
        "Q: So, do you think of yourself as Cecilia when you think about yourself?",
        "A: No, not really, but sometimes when somebody says, \u201cLucille, come here.\u201d I don\u2019t hear it. If\nsomebody would say, \u201cCecilia\u201d I would hear.",
        "Q: So, should I call you Lucille?",
        "A: No, Lucille is fine.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That\u2019s fine.",
        "Q: Lucille, let\u2019s talk a little bit about your family. Tell me about you\u2019re growing up. So, first I\nwant to know what was your father\u2019s name and your mother\u2019s name?",
        "A: My father\u2019s name was Benno Landau, short for Benjamin. My mother name was Sala Landau\nbefore that it was actually Sala Baumwollspinner.",
        "Q: Very long name.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And where did they meet?",
        "A: They met shortly after the First World War, in Cottbus, Germany, where my mother\u2019s older\nbrother had established a wine import-export business and was very successful. And, my\nmother \u2014 my father was already in Vienna and in Germany. My mother came from Sambor,\nPoland, because she was already in her late 20s, and there was no suitable suitor who came\nknocking. So, my grandmother sent her \u2014 she was the youngest of eight or ten children \u2014 to\nCottbus hoping she would find a husband.",
        "Q: And she did?",
        "A: She did, because my father worked for her older brother as a salesman.",
        "Q: Tell me what growing up with them was like. I know you were born in 1925. So, you don\u2019t\nhave to talk about the first couple of years unless you actually have a memory. What was\nhome life like for you?",
        "A: It was very predictable. It was very middle class. It was very secure. It was very\nunpretentious, although there was a maid for the children and a maid for the house, and we\nwent on nice vacation. There were music lessons and English lessons and dancing lessons.\nBut we took it for granted. My parents were rather strict \u2014 strict in terms of schooling, of\ngrades, strict when I didn\u2019t practice violin. Children had to be seen but not heard. When my\nparents discussed personal things or business events, they would speak Polish. I did not\nunderstand. When they talked to me and later on to my sister, 1t was in German.\nOccasionally, they would speak French, but not very often. It was \u2014 it was a nice childhood.\nThe memories I have until 1933, when I was eight, are warm and they are loving. I really\ncould not fault my parents for anything other than that were really very, very strict and very\ndemanding. It was very important that a report card had an \u201cA\u201d, maybe a \u201cB\u201d\u2019, but anything\nbelow that was not acceptable.",
        "Q: What would happen to you if...?",
        "A: Nothing would happen, but there would be reprimand, there would be a conference with the\nteacher, and after \u00b033, when the grades slipped considerably, then there was a different tutor\nevery afternoon \u2014 one for German, one for Math, one for English, one for French, and the\ngrades did improve. What my parents did not consider was that the outside world had an\ninfluence on children. They told us that things would change. It would not remain this way.\nThe neighbor\u2019s children would begin to play with us again. The boys would no longer beat us\nup on the way to school. It would \u2014 life would normalize. They didn\u2019t say exactly when, but\nthey were very reassuring and very convinced that there would be a political change. And my\nparents, of course, could not vote in German elections. They never became naturalized\nGerman citizens. They didn\u2019t want to. We went to Poland quite frequently to see the family,\nto see Grandmother, and what I heard in Poland as a very young child was that you, in\nGermany, are complaining about anti-Semitism. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like in Poland.\nYour economic conditions do not compare to ours. To me, it did not make sense.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t understand what they were saying?",
        "A: No. I could not comprehend. My grandmother spoke Polish. She spoke Yiddish to me, and I\nanswered in German, but I really did not comprehend. The family in Poland was well-off, but\nnothing compared to life in Germany. For instance, the streets in this little town were not \u2014\nthe streets were dirt streets, and when the peasants were pushing their wagons through the\nmain street of the town, they took their shoes off because it was muddy, and I could see their\nfeet with the \u2014 with the mud oozing through the toes. When we arrived by train in Poland, we\nwere picked up by a cousin with a horse and buggy. Well, I would not go into the buggy \u2014\nnot with a horse in front of it that was moving. I was used to a black taxi with white stripes.\nSo, these things I remember. I remember them warmly. I \u2014 I remember that, and I appreciate\nthat, I had a part of that culture, because it ended too soon.",
        "Q: Your father remained \u2014 he was in the wine business. He was a wine importer. Was he home a\ngreat deal, or did he travel?",
        "A: No, he didn\u2019t travel at all.",
        "Q: He didn\u2019t travel?",
        "A: No, no. He had traveling salesman, and he was home continually. He came home for lunch\ntime. He went with us on vacations every summer. It was usually a month or six weeks. How\nwell the business did, I never knew. I was never told. I had a small allowance, probably of 50\ncents a month. I didn\u2019t need anything, and I was not allowed to buy frivolous items. The\nclothing for the kids was custom made.",
        "Q: Was that unusual? The middle class that you were-",
        "A: Middle class and upper-middle class it was custom made, yes. In those days, a man did not\nbuy ready-made suits. There were hardly any. I went to a private Jewish school. The teachers\nwere \u2014 at that time \u2014 in their late 50s, and to me terribly old. They were very strict and they\nwere very orthodox. You had to adhere to the rules and regulations. On Saturday, you didn\u2019t\ntake a streetcar. You didn\u2019t write. You did not carry a purse. You pinned your handkerchief\nto your jacket. You learned Hebrew, post-modern Hebrew. You learned Humash and\nGemora and you had to translate. It was mandatory, five days a week. School was not a\nhappy experience. It was very rigid, very regimented, very German in spite of the fact that\nthe teachers were all Jewish, very demanding and it lacked compassion, understanding for\nthe children. We were told going home on the streetcar to stand in the back, to be quiet, not\nto talk loudly, not to draw attention, and I remember saying one day, \u201cThey want us to\nbecome invisible. How does one do that?\u201d",
        "Q: And who did you say this to?",
        "A: I said it both to my parents and to some friends, because I could not understand the\nrestrictions. I could not understand what I had done to deserve the punishment of being\nbeaten up on the street or having stones thrown at me or obscene names. I did not \u2014 I did not\nrealize the impact, and I believed at that point, that it would change.",
        "Q: So, is your memory that 1933 creates a real change for you, when you\u2019re eight years old? Is\nthat how your memory-",
        "A: It\u2019s between \u201933 and \u201936. It was over a three-year period.",
        "Q: Let me go back to your parents for just a moment. Did you feel closer to one parent more\nthan another? Or were they both very similar for you?",
        "A: They were very similar both in background, in education, in upbringing. I would say my\nmother was more reserved. She never contradicted my father. She agreed with all of his\ndecisions. I think I can only recall two times when she disagreed. She came home one day\nand had cut off her long black hair which was tied to the top of her head, and she came home\nwith a fashionable bob. And the other thing she did \u2014 which was before I was born, but I\nheard the story \u2014 during the inflation, under the inflation of 1922, she pawned her silver to\nkeep the business afloat, and she did not ask permission. After the business prospered, she of\ncourse got it back, but I think during the middle \u201930s, early \u201930s, she deferred him in all other\ndecisions. I did not know at that time that my father bought commercial real estate. It was\nnever mentioned. The decision was made between my father and my mother\u2019s brother,\nyounger brother, who was an associate, but we had no idea about it. We might have picked\nup a word or two, but we would have never asked. That wasn\u2019t done.",
        "Q: So, when you would sit at lunch \u2014 I assume you ate lunch together with your parents.",
        "A: At two o\u2019clock.",
        "Q: At two o\u2019clock, or dinner, would you \u2014 and after your sister was born and she became a little\nbit older, she was born in 1930, I think-",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Were you supposed to sit there very quietly and they would carry on the conversation, or\nwould people ask you questions about what had happened at school?",
        "A: There were very few questions at the dinner table. The maid would sometimes bring in a dish\nor plates, and then the language would immediately switch to Polish. We were asked\nquestions about school, but not necessarily at the dinner table. It was when it came time to do\nhomework, or when you wanted to postpone homework and the answer was, \u201cNo, homework\nfirst.\u201d It was a typical education of the \u201930s when you had to be within the role of a child, not\nhave the freedom of being light-hearted or joking or tell funny stories. It wasn\u2019t done.",
        "Q: But you seem to remember it very fondly.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: In spite of the restrictions.",
        "A: Yes because it was very secure. It was very predictable, and it gave us a sense of belonging.\nIt gave us a sense of being cared for. It gave us a sense of never missing anything. Anything\nthat was necessary for a normal life or a satisfactory life was provided. You didn\u2019t have to\nask for it.",
        "Q: Were you happy when Karin was born?",
        "A: Yes, I was delighted.",
        "Q: Did that mean that you had a place, even though she was so much younger, to laugh and be\nliked? I mean, did it give you something that you hadn\u2019t had?",
        "A: Well, I wanted a sister, and I put a cube of sugar on the windowsill so the stork would come\nand take the sugar and bring a sister. Yes, we played, even though there was a five-year\ndifference. She was very fast, very bright, and very pretty, and when she started school, I had\nto listen, \u201c\u201cWhy can\u2019t you behave like your sister? Why can\u2019t you be as intelligent as your\nsister? Why do you have to talk out of turn? Why can\u2019t you bring home A\u2019s like your sister?\u201d\nAnd that was a little difficult.",
        "Q: So, were you a little bit rebellious in that household?",
        "A: Maybe not in the household, but definitely at school. At school, I got into trouble here and\nthere.",
        "Q: How so?",
        "A: I would talk out of turn and we organized some pranks for teacher. I could think of putting\nthumb tacks some place, or put some glue on the chair. Or, when it\u2019s later on, when the\nphysics professor said, \u201cTurn the Bunsen burner on low,\u201d I turned it on high, and all the\nwindows blew out, and my dad had to pay for new windows. So, I had my share of troubles.",
        "Q: Did your parents explain about the Nazis, or simply said there was a change of government?\nDid you see things in the street?",
        "A: Yes, I saw the uniforms - first the brown uniforms with the red arm bands and the hats, which\nwas called the SA. We saw the children in uniform, young children \u2014 white shirts, brown\nskirts or trousers, and sort of a brownish necktie. We did not see many other uniforms at that\npoint. The green uniforms came much later. The local police wore greenish uniforms.",
        "Q: Wait one second. The noise is really too much. Okay, I\u2019m sorry, go ahead.",
        "A: The precinct police wore green uniforms and those silly helmets, but they were separate.\nEach precinct had a \u2014 each living area had a precinct and it was mandatory that when you\nmoved into an apartment or into a house that you register at the precinct \u2014 name, address,\noccupation, tax id number, and religion. When you decided to move from A Street to B\nStreet, you went back to the precinct. You told them where you\u2019re moving to. You went to\nthe new precinct, and you went through the procedure again. This system still exists in\nGermany and in France, and this was probably one of the reasons that you could keep tabs on\npeople.",
        "Q: But you clearly experienced a difference in terms of when you said that you felt, on the one\nhand, you\u2019re invisible, on the other hand, people know you\u2019re Jewish, and you\u2019re receiving\nall sorts of punishment of one sort or another. So, you\u2019re both invisible and not invisible at\nthe same time.",
        "A: Well, I was visible, but the adults wanted me to be invisible, not to draw any attention.\nWhile, on the other hand, we took the punishment regardless of where we stood, where we\nwalked or what we did.",
        "Q: And when you would come home having been taunted or beaten up, your parents would\nknow this?",
        "A: Yes, and could tell it by the dirty clothing because it was soiled from the stones and from the\ndirt that they threw at us. Sometimes, it would be a black eye.",
        "Q: So, it was really bad.",
        "A: It got progressively worse. At first it was taunts and remarks, and then it became physical.\nBut they tried to comfort us, but I think, as children, or as growing children, we were afraid\nand became subsequently more so.",
        "Q: So, you became much more afraid?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Of a lot of things, right?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: So, did you then retreat into yourself? Did you stay at home more than you used to?",
        "A: I stayed at home more, or somebody had to bring me to a friend\u2019s house or pick me up. I\nstarted to draw and paint a great deal. My grades slipped terribly, and that\u2019s when most of my\nspare time was occupied with tutors. The grades improved, but I don\u2019t think the happiness\nchanged or the unhappiness changed. I would have like to leave the country like many of my\nschool friends, but my parents saw no reason to leave because, in their eyes, we were former\nnationals. We had the protection of another government and we were untouchable.",
        "Q: Did they say this to you?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Now, how was Karin, your younger sister, responding? Equally fearfully, or was she-",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: She wasn\u2019t?",
        "A: She was not. She was somehow able to ignore it, to shut it out, and she was probably less\nmolested because she was blond and curly-haired at times. I had dark hair. I was older. It did\nnot seem to bother her, or maybe she was so much younger that she did not get the impact\nfrom the beginning. She grew into it. When she started school in \u201935, this is the way it was. It\nhadn\u2019t just changed overnight.",
        "Q: Did you talk with her, once she started school? Did you talk about what was happening?",
        "A: No, I never did. We talked about the teachers. We talked about grades. We did silly things.\nWe would hide things or play tricks on our parents, or when my mother was looking for a\npair of shoes, and one shoe was missing. We shared a room. The two beds were divided. In\nthe middle was a big wardrobe. We had dolls and dolls\u2019 carriages, and we played like normal\nchildren in a home. She had her friends. I had mine. But as we grew older, there was less\ninteraction.",
        "Q: How did your fears affect you, besides the grades? Were you able to sleep? Was it disturbed\nsleep?",
        "A: I was dreaming a great deal. When my parents would go in the evening to a concert or to the\ntheater, to the opera, and the maid would stay with us, they normally took a streetcar or tax1. I\nwould not sleep until they got home, and it was sometimes one o\u2019clock in the morning. I\ncouldn\u2019t. It was just fear \u2014 fear of something that I could not verbalize. I thought maybe the\nstreetcar would crash, or the taxi would have an accident. There was no coherent explanation\nof why this terrible fear.",
        "Q: Did it affect your eating?",
        "A: Yes, I was a very poor eater, and the school doctor recommended that I go for summer\nvacation to a children\u2019s home so I could recuperate a little bit, and my father had to convince\nthem that we went on vacation every year, and it was, you know, there was no shortage of\nfood, and they didn\u2019t have to worry. And I never did go. I would not go away from home\nalone.",
        "Q: Do you think your personality changed as you were by yourself a little bit more and you\u2019re\npainting?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think at that point, not at that point, probably later, but not at that point. The\nchange that I remember took place in 1938.",
        "Q: When your father is-",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Was taken?",
        "A: Yes, when my father was taken to Poland, and then, of course, when I walked to school on\nNovember 10\", after the Night of the Broken Glass, and I saw the synagogues burning. I saw\nthe stores vandalized, and we turned around and went back home. That\u2019s when it really\nbecame clear to me that this was not a place to stay or to live, but since I had no influence,\nthere was nothing I could do.",
        "Q: And, you\u2019re over 13 then, 13 and a half or something right?",
        "A: Yes, right. I could have gone on a children\u2019s boat to England, but I would not go alone, not\nwithout -",
        "Q: Not without your sister?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No, just alone, and you wouldn\u2019t do it?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Tell me about your nightmares.",
        "A: Then or now?",
        "Q: Then. Now we\u2019ll do later.",
        "A: My nightmares then were of accidents, of vehicles crashing, of streetcars derailing, of trains\ncatching fire, because they had old-fashioned locomotives, of catastrophes. I was worried in a\nthunderstorm. I was petrified of lightening and these were the nightmares.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re in these situations all the time?",
        "A: Right, right, I was there.",
        "Q: Do you survive them or you don\u2019t survive them in the dreams? Do you remember?",
        "A: I know that I talked in my dreams and I know that I screamed in my dreams, and I know I\nwoke.",
        "Q: Now, before your father is sent to Poland, in 1937, you leave the place where you\u2019ve been\nliving all your life. Am I correct?",
        "A: In 1937, my father voluntarily closed the business. I assumed the reasons to be because we\nwere Jewish, but it really wasn\u2019t the main reason. The main reason was that he didn\u2019t need\nthe business. There was enough money. There was enough income. There was sufficient real\nestate. So, why bother?",
        "Q: So, he was getting sufficient income from the real estate.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And he just voluntarily liquated in \u201937, and his brother in Palestine, who left from Berlin in\n\u00b034, asked that we come, and they said, \u201cNo, we are not coming.\u201d And the letter that my\nfather wrote to my uncle, which was lost but I know of the letter, was if he can eat doves in\nthis country, why should we come with a Bunsen burner to Palestine? So, that was never a\nconsideration of leaving the country.",
        "Q: Although you had it in your head?",
        "A: Yes, because my classmates left, and it was an adventure. I did not know what it meant to go\nto Palestine, or to the USA. It was a change. It was an adventure. Everybody was doing it.\nWhy shouldn\u2019t I do it?",
        "Q: Did you say this to your parents? Did you say-",
        "A: I said, \u201cWhy can\u2019t we leave? Everybody else is leaving.\u201d And they said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, don\u2019t\nworry. It\u2019ll be \u2014 itll be okay.\u201d",
        "Q: So, in \u2019?37, you don\u2019t leave the apartment, you stay there.",
        "A: Towards the end of \u201937, we lived in a condominium, and the whole complex \u2014 and the street\nis still standing \u2014 made it clear that the six or seven Jewish families who occupied I would\nsay a total of probably a hundred condominiums, they were no longer desired, and would we\nplease sell our interest and move. And we moved to another apartment that was owned by a\nJewish attorney in a not-so-nice area, but acceptable area, and all I remember of that\napartment 1s that it had a tiny little orthodox synagogue in the backyard. We never went\nthere, but there was one, probably a hundred members at the most. The other thing I\nremember is that on November 10\" or 11\", we had a knock on the door at four in the\nmorning, and there was my mother\u2019s brother and his son and his wife, and they had spent the\nnight in a train from Cottbus to come to Hamburg to escape the arrest of all males which took\nplace on the 10\" of November. So, they were hiding out in that apartment for a couple of\nweeks.",
        "Q: But that\u2019s after your father\u2019s gone.",
        "A: My father was already in Poland.",
        "Q: Now, let me ask you something that I forgot to ask you about. Was yours a religious home in\nany way\u201d?",
        "A: Yes. It was religious because both my families came from an orthodox home. All the laws\nwere observed. There were some rabbis in the family on my mother\u2019s side. My grandmother\nwore a wig, and I found that very amusing because she would lift it like you lift a cover on a\npot of potatoes, and then she\u2019d put it back. And \u2014 but when my parents came to Germany,\nthey somewhat \u2014 they became somewhat more liberal. The congregation they belonged to we\nwould call today \u201cconservative\u201d rather than \u201corthodox\u201d. The home had separate dishes.\nKashrut was observed, but I would say looking back probably not a hundred percent, only 80\npercent, but as far as school was concerned, it was very orthodox. So, they tried not to upset\nme with giving me two sets of values \u2014 the more liberal value at home and the orthodox\nvalue at school, but yes, it was a religious household.",
        "Q: And that was comfortable for you?",
        "A: I never questioned it. It was customary.",
        "Q: And were most of your friends orthodox, as well?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s go back up to \u201937-\u201938. How 1s it that your father is taken? Does he receive a\nnotice? Does someone come to the door and say, \u201cYou\u2019re a Polish national\u2019? And why aren\u2019t\nyou all sent out, why only your father?",
        "A: The Polish Consul in Hamburg was supplied \u2014 was supposed to supply a stamp or a\nvalidation on all Polish passports, those of Jews and non-Jews, except there happened to be\nno non-Jews. But, for some reason, he refused. Whether the reasons were anti-Semitic or not,\nhe refused, and I only know of one or two cases where bribery worked, which was very\nunusual. The moment he refused to validate the passports, the Germans said, \u201cYou\u2019re no\nlonger a valid foreign national living on German ground.\u201d At five-of-one in the morning,\nthey rounded up \u2014 they came to our door. They rang the bell, and it was local police. And\nthey said, \u201cYou have to come with me because of the matter of the stamps, and we take you\nto a schoolyard downtown.\u201d And my father said, \u201cMy wife just had surgery three months\nago. Can she stay with the children?\u201d And my sister and I stood in the hallway and listened,\nand since he was a local policeman, he said, \u201cAll right. You come with me, and I let the\nfamily stay.\u201d By afternoon, we heard by phone that this was done throughout the city, and\nthey had rounded up several thousand people, or maybe in Hamburg alone it was not quite as\nmuch, and that they were held in a schoolyard, and somebody suggested that we bring my\nfather a suitcase with some clothing. But they also said for my mother not to go because they\nwould keep her. She packed a suitcase and I insisted to take it down. It was heavy. I took\npublic transportation. I took the subway \u2014 the underground and the above-ground, and I\ndragged that suitcase all the way down to the schoolyard. The gate was open and I started\nlooking for my father, but there were a great many people \u2014 men, women and children, and\nhe found me. I gave him the suitcase, and I remember distinctly saying to him, \u201cCome home\nwith me. The gate is open. There is no guard. There are no people. Just come home and we\u2019ll\nhide, or something.\u201d And my father looked at me and he said, \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be the\nhonorable thing to do.\u201d I did not understand what he meant, but my father played by the\nrules. When the law was published that you were not allowed to have foreign currency or to\nhave currency in a foreign country, my father took the money that was in Holland and\nbrought it back to Germany. So, you played by the rules, which I learned many years later\nthat you don\u2019t have to. He could have just walked out. Nobody would have said a thing, and\nsome people did, but very few. He was pushed over the border. The Poles pushed back, and\nthe Germans pushed him in. They got to Zbaszyn, from Zbaszyn he went to Posen. He stayed\nthere two months. He tried to come back to Germany. He couldn\u2019t get an entry visa, and he\nwent to Sambor, to mother\u2019s family, and he stayed there until May 1940, no 1939, excuse\nme, when he got permission to come back for four weeks. In the meantime, my mother\ndecided to liquidate the household and to ship all that was contained in an eight-room\napartment in huge containers to Palestine, to my father\u2019s brother. She handled the shipping.\nShe handled the packing. She handled the Gestapo who came to watch, and tried to approve\nevery single item that went out of the country. She put a bottle of wine and two glasses on the\ntable, and she refilled it with two or three more bottles, and they drank a great deal and we\npacked fast.",
        "Q: Who drank?",
        "A: The two Gestapo.",
        "Q: The two Gestapo, not your mother?",
        "A: No, no, no. She just talked to the packers, \u201cHurry up, pack.\u201d We did not take anything of any\nparticular value, just the furniture, clothing, linens and silverware, jewelry \u2014 whatever we\nnormally had in the apartment, but the faster the better. The two crates were packed. They\nwere picked-up, and they were shipped to Trieste. We, in the meantime, had to give up under\nnew German laws the apartment and we were assigned to a room on Werder Street Five. In\nthe meantime, my father was granted permission and he came back. I think the permission\npartly was through the intervention of my mother who hounded the Gestapo in the Staathaus\nin Hamburg. She wrote. She went in. She talked to them. They threatened with arrest. She\ndidn\u2019t give up. I never thought that a quiet, reserved woman would do what she did, and it\nabsolutely amazed me. When my father came back, we started to work on an affidavit for the\nUnited States, and it certificate for Palestine. The four weeks ran out. My mother got an\nextension for another four weeks, and another four weeks, and one morning, on September\n1S, the doorbell rang at five in the morning, six in the morning, and two men appeared with\nhats and long, black leather coats, and 1t was September. It was warm. And they asked for my\nfather, and they said that Germany is at war with Poland. We have invaded Poland. You are\nan enemy alien, and you have to come with us. And that was the first day of the Second\nWorld War. He was first sent to a prison in Fuhlsbuttel, which later became a concentration\ncamp, and we were still allowed to bring every week a briefcase with laundry and take home\na briefcase with dirty laundry for about two or three weeks, but Poland lost the war for all\nintents and purposes within two weeks. They had pockets of resistance, but not of war, and\nthe moment that became a fact, my father was transported to Berlin to Oranienburg, to\nSachsenhausen, and the mail stopped coming. It was sort of an aerogram with one sentence:\n\u201cT\u2019m fine. I hope you are fine. Love, Ben.\u201d These letters became less and less frequent, until\none arrived from Dachau. We had never heard of the place. My mother made, I would say,\ntwice monthly trips to the Gestapo in Hamburg, in the Stathaus, pleading for release, trying\nto work for an exit visa, trying to work towards immigration papers, anyplace, writing a letter\nevery week to the head of the Gestapo. The end result was that they brought my father to\nGestapo headquarters for an hour\u2019s visit. He had on a grey and blue striped prison uniform\nand matching cap. We were sitting on opposite sides of the table, no touching. We talked but\nnobody could talk. My mother assured him she would try. It was a Catch-22. To go to\nShanghai, you had to have 400 American dollars, but you weren\u2019t allowed to have American\ncurrencies, and we had nobody who would give it to us. Our accounts had been blocked. Our\nmoney had been confiscated. We got a hundred dollars a month allowance to live on, no\nmore. We had to move to the apartment next door, number seven. I still went to school. My\nsister still went to school. We went to the Jewish Community Council, who was headed at\nthat time by a Doctor Plaut (ph). Doctor Plaut at that time was a man in his early 50s. He was\nunmarried. You had to wait for an audience, like you wait for the pope. We pleaded for\npapers because it was an emergency because somebody was sitting in a concentration camp,\nand he shrugged his shoulders and he said there was nothing he could do, but he became very\nwell known for the fact that you could buy favors, but that was 1939, 1940. We heard\nrumors. He married a very much younger woman with two young children, and he remained,\nas I\u2019m told, in Germany and was exchanged for a German I believe in Yugoslavia, pretty\nmuch into the war \u201943-\u201944. He ended up in Palestine. My father remained in Dachau and one\nman was released, and he had papers, first for Italy and then for Palestine, and my mother\nand I went to see him one evening after curfew, and we saw this six foot tall man who was a\nskeleton \u2014 no front teeth, shaven head \u2014 and when my mother asked him, \u201cHow is Benno?\u201d\nHe said, \u201cFine.\u201d He managed to leave Germany with his wife and two children, and he\npromised to help once he would be outside. Going back to \u201939, when my father returned from\nPoland, he talked to the Italian Consul and they were on friendly terms, and he offered my\nfather a three-day visa to Italy, and my father said, \u201cAnd what do I do after the three days?\u201d\nAnd being Italian the man said, \u201cGo, and worry later.\u201d My father wouldn\u2019t go. He was\nmurdered in Dachau in February 1941. The Gestapo did something that the very rarely did.\nThey brought us a cigar boxes with ashes. Whose ashes? We will never know.",
        "Q: Who was at the door when they - ?",
        "A: I opened the door.",
        "Q: You opened the door.",
        "A: And, they said, \u201cMrs. Landau?\u201d And I took them to the kitchen, and they threw the box on\nthe table, and they said, \u201cAshes, Benjamin Landau.\u201d And my mother screamed, and\nsomething on the stove was burning, and they left, and that was February \u201941. I went to\nschool in the daytime. I did homework, sewing at night because we needed the money\ndesperately, and we had to move to another furnished room.",
        "Q: Let me ask you something. When these men come in and they throw this cigar box on the\ntable and your mother screams, what do you do?",
        "A: Nothing. I stood frozen.",
        "Q: You just stood there.",
        "A: I just \u2014I couldn\u2019t comprehend. First of all, I didn\u2019t know what cremation was. I had never\nbeen to a cemetery. I didn\u2019t know what ashes meant at this point. It was a concept that was\nnot within the Jewish religion. So, 1t took minutes or \u2014 I don\u2019t know how long it took to\nreally comprehend what it was. Somebody called the chief rabbi, which was Josef Carlebach,\nand it was an orthodox burial although it was not in accordance with law. And we never\nfound out whether those are really his ashes. The body \u2014 the ashes were buried in the Jewish\ncemetery in Hamburg, and we managed to save some money and give it to a non-Jewish\nbusiness acquaintance to set a stone, and the stone still stands. We lived in this apartment\nuntil Fall \u201941, when we received notification for resettlement, and all it said was \u201cEast\u201d\nnothing else.",
        "Q: Okay, I want to come back a little bit. I\u2019m assuming that the luggage, when you went down\nthe first time, when your father was taken in \u00b038, was a fairly piece of luggage.",
        "A: It was actually a big suitcase.",
        "Q: You, who talk about being so frightened through this period, all of a sudden, you\u2019re going to\ntake this luggage because you know it\u2019s too dangerous for your mother. Were you frightened\nwhen you went?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t think. I knew I had to deliver it, one way or another, and I just \u2014 I couldn\u2019t carry it,\neither. I dragged it, and luggage didn\u2019t have wheels in those days. No, I wasn\u2019t \u2014 I was\nprobably apprehensive, but not frightened. I knew I had to take it someplace, and that was all\nthat mattered.",
        "Q: And when you saw your father, did you hug each other?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Were you annoyed with him, angered with him?",
        "A: No, I cried.",
        "Q: Frustrated with him that he \u2014 you cried.",
        "A: I cried.",
        "Q: And he cried?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No? And when he wouldn\u2019t come with you?",
        "A: Well, he pushed me towards the gate. He turned me around and said, \u201cPlease go.\u201d And I\nwent.",
        "Q: And did you cry all the way home?",
        "A: I tried not to.",
        "Q: Did you walk or did you take the subway?",
        "A: It was too much to walk. I took the subway again.",
        "Q: You said you were surprised at how your mother behaved. That she seemed to change from\nthe woman you had known, so that once her husband was gone, she took over as the head of\nthe household.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: And fairly easily I gather from what you-",
        "A: Well, she felt driven. She felt if she didn\u2019t do 1t, who would do it? And she believed truly that\nshe could get my father released.",
        "Q: Now, when you came home that day, did you want to fall into your mother\u2019s arms crying, or\ndid you go to your room? Do you have any recollection?",
        "A: I think that night we \u2014 my sister and I \u2014 slept in the big bed in my parents\u2019 bedroom.",
        "Q: With your mother?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did your mother cry?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So, that must have been very hard on both of you.",
        "A: Very hard.",
        "Q: Did you know what to do? I mean, there\u2019s nothing.",
        "A: There was nothing. There was nothing to say or nothing to do.",
        "Q: Did friends come over? Other women who had also lost their husbands, or who hadn\u2019t but\nwere friends with your mother?",
        "A: No, because everybody stayed at home by the phone hoping. So, nobody came over, but the\nphone lines went back and forth, \u201cHave you heard?\u201d \u201cWhat do you know?\u201d \u201cWill we get the\nstamp in the passport?\u201d \u201cWill they let them come back next week?\u201d It was conjecture,\nnobody really knew.",
        "Q: Right. Now, during this period, before your father returns for that month and then another\nfour weeks and another four weeks, the money that you have as far as you know is the same\namount that you have had before. They haven\u2019t confiscated the money yet.",
        "A: No, they didn\u2019t get around to that yet. That only happened after the 1\u201c' of September when\nPoland was invaded. Until that time, we had free access to bank accounts, to anything within\nGermany.",
        "Q: Right, and your mother didn\u2019t move money some place.",
        "A: No, it was unthinkable.",
        "Q: Unthinkable to do?",
        "A: It was unthinkable. I know sufficient people moved it to Switzerland or to Holland or \u2014 no, it\njust was illegal, and you didn\u2019t do things illegal.",
        "Q: Right, and you\u2019re smiling. When your father is taken the second time, does this feel more\nominous to you? You\u2019re older now of course and you do-",
        "A: No, it did not, because he was treated for the first two weeks under the Geneva Conventions\nas an enemy alien, and believing, or having learned about the Geneva Conventions, I mean,\nafter all it couldn\u2019t be bad. You could bring laundry once a week, and pick up laundry once a\nweek, and do the same over again. And I don\u2019t think we even contemplated the end of the\nwar or Poland losing the war. I think we naively anticipated a settlement, international\nintervention, or something of that sort.",
        "Q: So, when did you start to worry? When he\u2019s taken out to Oranienburg?",
        "A: Yes. Once they shipped him to Sachsenhausen, Oranienburg, and Dachau, then we began to\nrealize that there is a concentration camp.",
        "Q: Did you expect him to return in your head or were you pessimistic?",
        "A: My mother did. I did not.",
        "Q: And how do you know she did? She said it?",
        "A: She talked about it.",
        "Q: And you never said to her...?",
        "A: No, because there were other men taken at the same time, I either knew their sons or their\ndaughters, and several of them perished or were murdered, and I did not believe that there\nwas escaping Dachau.",
        "Q: And now the money is...?",
        "A: Blocked.",
        "Q: Blocked. And you get a hundred dollars a month from where?",
        "A: Out of our account administered by the Deutsche Bank.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And by the Gestapo, under supervision of the Gestapo.",
        "Q: So, life is getting narrower and tighter and harder for everyone.",
        "A: Very hard.",
        "Q: We should take a break now, the tape is running out.\nEnd of Tape 1\nTape 2",
        "Q: Once your father is taken away and ends up in Dachau, and your mother is now again the\nhead of the household, because I imagine when he returned even for those 12 weeks, he\nbecame head of the household again?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: So, then it comes back to her.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And her spirits keep up because she\u2019s fighting to try to get him back.",
        "A: Yes, because our neighbor next door had a typewriter, Mr. Berman, and he would write the\nweekly letters to the Gestapo to release my father.",
        "Q: And she would dictate them?",
        "A: Well, she would tell him what to write, and she would sign them and either deliver them or\nmail them week after week.",
        "Q: Now, you\u2019re old enough to notice some changes. When your father comes back, does she\nchange? Does her personality seem to change?",
        "A: A little bit. Not entirely to what it was before. She was very reassuring that the certificate\nfrom Palestine would come. She was very supportive. But any initiation, any discussion, any\nplans were made by my father, and she agreed.",
        "Q: She agreed?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So, he didn\u2019t change very much.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: That you noticed.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: When you saw him when he had been taken the second time, you saw him in the prison, and\nthen you saw him later, did he change significantly?",
        "A: He lost a lot of weight. He was always slim, but not gaunt, and he was gray. His skin was\ngray and gaunt.",
        "Q: Did that frighten you?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So, it must have been tough when you folks left him and you go back with the memory of\nwhat he was looking like and where it was.",
        "A: Yes, but we still believed there was a chance to get him released.",
        "Q: Would little Karin go with you, too?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: She was by then eight, nine \u2014 nine years old.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Right, so you would all go together?",
        "A: Yes. Yes. The building where we saw him still stands. And when I come to the corner, I\ncross the street. I just don\u2019t want to walk past it.",
        "Q: What was the funeral like?",
        "A: The funeral was small because there were few people left. It was like all the orthodox\nfunerals. It was a plain, pine coffin. The rabbi cut the lapels of the coat, and I really don\u2019t\nremember much. It was an open grave. There was a seven-day shiva.",
        "Q: There was?",
        "A: Oh, yes. There was really nothing to say because there were so few Jews left or so few Jews\nwilling to come out to the cemetery. There was a minion. There were some visitors to the\nhouse during the week. It didn\u2019t seem real. It seemed like you had seen a film, but it really\ndidn\u2019t happen.",
        "Q: Did you notice a change in your mother?",
        "A: Yes, she was very withdrawn, very quiet, very disinterested in the daily routine. We had to\nshop in special stores, food stores. The food coupons had a \u201cJ\u201d on them. The rations were, of\ncourse, smaller. And she, in a way, sent me out to do the errands.",
        "Q: So, did you then have to take more responsibility in the family?",
        "A: Yes, I did.",
        "Q: Did you understand that?",
        "A: Yes, I understood it to the extent that I went to the largest department store who, before the\n9'\" of November was Jewish but no longer, and I said I could sew. Could they give me\ndresses to sew at night? And they said, \u201cYes.\u201d And they gave me the design \u2014 a plain shirt\ntop with a pleated skirt. And I was sewing at night after school. I was sewing on Saturdays,\nand my mother didn\u2019t say a word that you don\u2019t sew on Saturdays. And I got paid once a\nweek in a little brown envelope, and after six weeks the lady in charge said, \u201cThe skirts are\ncrooked and the sleeves are backwards and the collar doesn\u2019t close. I\u2019m sorry. We can\u2019t use\nyou.\u201d I mean, I was \u2014 I had taken a course in school, but I was not a seamstress. I was 16\nyears old.",
        "Q: But, you certainly were trying, weren\u2019t you?",
        "A: I was trying.",
        "Q: Were you disappointed?",
        "A: Yes, I was heartbroken. I was later on told by a lady that I should have tried in the infants\ndepartment. It would have been so much easier, but that of course had never dawned on me,\nand by then you couldn\u2019t get jobs for anything.",
        "Q: And how was Karin during this period? Did she understand that your father is gone forever?",
        "A: She understood, but on a different level. She also came with Scarlet Fever during that time,\nand she had to be put into a public hospital behind a fence. We could talk to her through the\nfence, but it was highly contagious. In those days, there was no medication. And after six\nweeks she came back home. She understood that he was gone, but she didn\u2019t understand for\nhow long, or why, or how permanent it would be. That came later.",
        "Q: And did she ask you where he was?",
        "A: No, she didn\u2019t ask because she was at the funeral.",
        "Q: So, she knew in some ways?",
        "A: She knew on some level that there was a grave and there was something in the grave. She did\nnot understand about the ashes. Why would a human being become ashes? That did not make\nsense at all, and I couldn\u2019t explain it. I just couldn\u2019t.",
        "Q: This is a strange question I just thought of, but I\u2019m going to ask it anyway \u2014 did they put the\ncigar box into the coffin?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Just as it was?",
        "A: That\u2019s Hallakik (ph) Law, yes. I mean, cremation 1s not Jewish. You don\u2019t do it. And they\ndid not know how to handle it because I don\u2019t think the rabbi, who was probably in his 60s,\nhad ever had any experience. He was a very learned man, and he made the decision and he\nsaid he would defend it and if necessary, and the box, the way we received it with a\nrubber band, was put into the coffin.",
        "Q: So, that was-",
        "A: That was February 1941.",
        "Q: So, you go from February \u201941 until October 21*' when you get the notification. So, you\u2019re not\nworking.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Your mother\u2019s not working.",
        "A: But I\u2019m going to school.",
        "Q: But you\u2019re going to school the whole time.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: And your mother gets more and more reserved and withdrawn.",
        "A: Withdrawn, quiet, resigned probably is the proper word for it. She still talked to people. We\nstill occasionally saw an old family friend, but there was no \u2014 no joy. There was no laughter.\nThere was no \u2014 there was no plan for any kind of a future.",
        "Q: So, when you would eat together whatever the very small amounts of food you had,\nconversation?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: It was always quiet.",
        "A: Quiet.",
        "Q: And did you play with friends still?",
        "A: Yes, I still had friends. There was still a youth organization. There was still a so-called\n\u201cHouse of Culture\u201d for Jews, and there were films; sometimes there were ping- pong games.\nI belonged to Bar Kochba. There were even dance classes. And I went dancing with the son\nof Rabbi Callabah (sp) who was a Hassidic Jew in New York.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But he used to dance, when we were 13.",
        "Q: So, do you recall any moments of pleasure during that period. I mean, were these kinds of\nthings in some sense a relief?",
        "A: No, they were a relief, and there were moments when you just lived that moment. You did\nnot think about it, but when you went to them, you felt guilty, and yet the following week,\nyou went back again. You probably \u2014 I probably knew that this was not the thing to do, but I\ndid it. There were light moments. They were cheering when Bar Kochba won the ping-pong\ngame. I remember my old fashioned record player the Andrew Sisters. I remember some\nAmerican jazz, which was not permitted, but for five dollars you could have a copy made on\na wax platter. So, we learned to dance swing, which was the latest rage. There were even\nfashion trends. The boys would wear trench coats and those sloppy hats with the wide brim.\nThe girls would wear pleated skirts and thick rubber soles, white or beige rubber soles. That\nwas the style. Stockings were no longer available so you painted your legs and you put a\nblack line on the back. Silk stockings were unobtainable. And if you had a pair, you had them\nforever repaired. Clothing coupons Jews did not get. If there was clothing available in the\nstore, we couldn\u2019t buy it. The children or the young people did not mind. It wasn\u2019t that\nimportant. What was important was to be with other young people.",
        "Q: Did your mother not want you to go, or she didn\u2019t say anything?",
        "A: She didn\u2019t say anything, but they \u2014 I had the impression that she felt that it showed\ndisrespect.",
        "Q: That it would show disrespect to go?",
        "A: To the year of mourning for my father.",
        "Q: I see, but you obviously were not going to respond to that somehow.",
        "A: She did not say so. She did request that we observe the first 30 days, and after that she did\nnot say anything.",
        "Q: And, when you were with young people, I imagine you talked about what was going on in\nsome way, or am I wrong?",
        "A: We talked about those people that had good chances of leaving \u2014 how, when, where, by what\nmeans. Do you take a boat to Shanghai or do you take the overland railroad? We talked about\nPalestine. We talked about the small groups that were smuggled into Yugoslavia and that\nmade it as far as the Mediterranean and then swam into Haifa, and they were put in Turkey\nprison. We knew of course that England was heavily involved in the war. We were being\nbombed during that time. We had to go into air raid shelters, and Jews had to be in one\ncorner. Not that there were many. But I think we were fairly aware of the fact that England\ncouldn\u2019t possibly win the war. It was too small a country, too far away, and there was no\nmore Czechoslovakia. There was no more Austria. There was no more Poland. Holland was\noverrun. We did not see any hope. There was talk of Madagascar, of settling us in\nMadagascar, and then it turned out it was a joke.",
        "Q: And how did you hear about Madagascar? From the other kids?",
        "A: Yes. I remember my mother going to Berlin when Molotov was in Berlin and signed the\nagreement with Hitler. The reason for my mother going was that the city of Sombor became\nRussia. It was the first town on the Russian border. And she thought that by going to Berlin\nmaybe she could get a temporary passport, or maybe there would be a possibility to go there\n\u2014all sorts of unreal schemes, but you tried anything. And I remember the visit to Berlin.",
        "Q: You went with her or no?",
        "A: I went along and we had to stay with a girlfriend of an old acquaintance of the family\nbecause you couldn\u2019t stay in a hotel.",
        "Q: Was that an expensive trip?",
        "A: No, you went by rail. It took four hours. We went third class because a) we didn\u2019t have the\nmoney, and b) you\u2019re less conspicuous. I remember when we used to travel to Poland, we\ntraveled first class and the upholstery was red plush and it itched when you sat on it, and at\nnight the porter would make our beds. So, the Berlin trip was quite different.",
        "Q: Do you still have a radio in your house?",
        "A: There was a radio in the apartment and a telephone, and I think the radio and the telephone\nbelonged to Mr. Berman because he had privileges by reason of an intermarriage, and two\nsons \u2014 I think they even were on the Wehrmacht, if I\u2019m not mistaken, later in the war, and so\nhe had the privilege of radio, but it was not a short wave. It was just local stations. And I\nthink he had a telephone.",
        "Q: Did you ever hear Hitler speaking on the radio?",
        "A: Yes, many times.",
        "Q: Many times.",
        "A: I even saw him once.",
        "Q: Where did you see him?",
        "A: We went downtown, and that was in the mid \u201930s, into the district where all the department\nstores were like a small Fifth Avenue. And all of a sudden, the SS and the SR were pushing\nthe people from the sidewalk facing the street on both sides, and a motorcade appeared, open,\nand Hitler was standing with his right arm raised, looking right, looking left, and everybody\nraised their right arm. And I stood in front of my mother \u2014she was a little bit taller than I \u2014\nand she put her right arm on my head instead of raising it over me. She put it on my head.\nWe were afraid.",
        "Q: And what did you do?",
        "A: I just sort of squeezed in between the other young people. I just, nothing. I was petrified. I\nheard him speak many times, or rave, it was not speaking, but that\u2019s the only time I saw him.",
        "Q: And what did you think or feel when you \u2014 I gather you heard him on the radio?",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "Q: Did he make you nervous? Did you think he was just crazy and this couldn\u2019t last?",
        "A: I-I just couldn\u2019t understand this ranting and raving because even to a young person, it made\nso little sense. And then when he talked about race and Jews and the international conspiracy,\nand Jews own all the money and all the banks. I once asked in school, and the man who\ntaught history was Professor Eunice, and I said, \u201c\u201cWhat is the percentage of the Jews living in\nGermany?\u201d And it was less than one percent or something, and I said, \u201cBut we can\u2019t own all\nthat they say that we do own.\u201d It didn\u2019t make sense. I could not comprehend.",
        "Q: Did you have non-Jewish friends at all?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: For childhood?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: None.",
        "A: I had neighbor kids, upstairs, downstairs, and we would play before \u201933, but that was it.",
        "Q: But that was it?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So, you actually never had a conversation...",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: ...after \u00b033...",
        "A: No",
        "Q: ...with someone who wasn\u2019t Jewish?",
        "A: No, my mother occasionally with a neighbor. My father occasionally over the phone with\nbusiness associate of some sort, but very cautiously, very carefully, and not really detailed.",
        "Q: And when you would walk on the street, you would see police, soldiers \u2014 would people move\naway from you? I mean, you didn\u2019t have any -",
        "A: If I went by myself, I could pass. If the SS walked by \u2014 mainly the SR, the brown shirts, I\ncould just sort of blend in, so to speak. If I was walking with somebody else, I was out of\nluck. I mean, it was immediate. I don\u2019t know how the Poles today can tell that I\u2019m a Jew.\nWhen I go today to Poland, they say, \u201cOh, a Jew from America.\u201d How they can tell I don\u2019t\nknow, but the Germans could, too.",
        "Q: The Germans could?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How would you hear about restrictions? Were there curfews, places where you couldn\u2019t go?\nWere their notices in Jewish newspapers?",
        "A: There were notices on the movies, on the park benches. It was in newspapers, \u201cJews are no\nlonger permitted on the street after dark.\u2019 There was a newspaper called Der Stuermer, which\nwas the official organ of the Nazi party, with distorted pictures of Jews. One of them had my\nuncle in it, the one who had the big business in Cottbus. No, the restrictions were publicized\nmainly in newspapers or, for instance, on stores. Early on, \u201cDon\u2019t Buy Here. It\u2019s a Jew.\u201d\nLater on, when they were taken over by non-Jews, it was no longer an issue because the\nnames were changed. We went to a park in winter and people would slide down the hill, and\nthat was no longer permitted, \u201cJews No Entrance.\u201d In summer, in that park on every bench,\n\u201cJews Forbidden.\u201d I don\u2019t think you could hire a taxi as a Jew. It was no longer possible. It\nwas dangerous.",
        "Q: And could you ride on the subway or the train?",
        "A: We did during day hours, but towards the last year that we lived in Germany, we did not ride\ntogether. We would take the train, but everybody would take a different compartment or a\ndifferent train. Not that two or three people would sit next to each other. I would take the first\ntrain. My mother would take the second train, and we would know where we get out. We\nwent out once after curfew, one time only, and we almost got caught.",
        "Q: Why did you ride separate trains? Were you already conscious that you could just be picked\nup?",
        "A: Yeah. And later on trains were no longer allowed for Jews, and Jews had to turn in cars,\nthose who had cars. The Jews who were German nationals had to hand in their gold and\nsilver after the Kristall Night, to pay for the damages. It was strange going into a store where\nyou had gone all your life to buy some material for a dress, and all of a sudden you felt like\neverybody was looking at you. Or you were afraid they would call the police.",
        "Q: Because you weren\u2019t allowed there or because...?",
        "A: We were not supposed to be there.",
        "Q: I see. At this period, did you begin to regret that you had not gone to England alone? Did you\nthink of that?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t think of that.",
        "A: I regretted that we did not go when we could have gone to Palestine in \u201934. That I regretted.\nBut going away alone, I never regretted. I would have never done it. And while all of the\nchildren \u2014 10,000 of them \u2014 that did go from Austria and Germany survived, except my\ngirlfriend who was hit by a bomb in mid-town London, they came out very bitter and very\nresentful elderly people. There\u2019s now the organization of Kindertransport and they\u2019re very\nangry.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: They feel there is compensation due them which they never received. They feel they were\nused as maids or taken out of school at age 14, and sent to learn a trade rather than study at a\nuniversity, and they feel that they suffered unjustly and they never received an apology. They\nnever received compensation. It\u2019s a very vocal organization, at least in California. And I can\nfully understand where they come from and why they feel this way, but it is now the year\n2001. They left in \u201939. Most of them lost their parents, not all, but a great many. What are\nthey trying to accomplish with the bitterness and with the publicity?",
        "Q: So, are you glad that you didn\u2019t become one of them?",
        "A: No, the only reason I\u2019m not one of them because I was just fearful of leaving. It had nothing\nto do with that. I was in Washington once for the meeting of Hidden Children, and they are\nvery, very angry, and very bitter, and very \u2014 I would say almost \u2014 for them, it\u2019s almost\nimpossible to cope with these two or three years in which they were hidden in France, or\nBelgium, Poland, wherever. So, there is a lot of damage. It\u2019s a matter of degree. I think we all\nsustained some, more or less, but it\u2019s strange that it took 60 years to surface. There were no\nsocial workers. There was no psychiatric help. There\u2019s help given now, but what good will it\ndo an 80 year old person? Too little, too late.",
        "Q: Your furniture was packed up and went to Trieste in order to go to Palestine?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And did it get there?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. So, why didn\u2019t it get there?",
        "A: It got stuck in the harbor in Trieste until 1945. In 1945, my uncle from Haifa paid the storage\nand had it shipped to Haifa. One of the crates \u2014 well, it was a container, 1t wasn\u2019t a crate \u2014\nwas broken into, and it was the one container that contained my mother\u2019s silver and jewelry.\nWhile they didn\u2019t empty it out, I don\u2019t have one place setting. I\u2019Il have one fork and I\u2019Il have\ntwo spoons, but I won\u2019t have any knives. My uncle received it into \u201945 or \u201946 in Haifa. He\nasked me what he should send me \u2014 oriental rugs or silverware, whatever. I said, \u201cI want the\npictures that were in the crate. And if there\u2019s any jewelry of my mother\u2019s, I would like it, and\neverything else please do whatever you think you want to do with it. I don\u2019t wish to.\u201d",
        "Q: So, your understanding of what\u2019s happening, once your father dies when there\u2019s this period\nof a number of months before you get the notice, do you expect to be deported?",
        "A: No. There was no rumor.",
        "Q: Nothing?",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "Q: So, when -",
        "A: We assumed they would use us for workers in factories.",
        "Q: In Germany\u201d",
        "A: Yes. Especially the young men.",
        "Q: So, is your fear level gone down some? Are you getting used to it, or is it very high?",
        "A: You get used to fear. You get used to looking over your shoulder. You get used to limitations\nsuch as rationed food and living in a small room. You adjust. You accept whatever is given\nyou, but then there was a war, and there was a glimmer of hope that maybe Germany would\nlose the war, even in 741.",
        "Q: Okay. So, October 21\u2018, 1941, you get a relocation notice.",
        "A: Yes, we each had a suitcase.",
        "Q: Well, what happened? You got something in the mail?",
        "A: Yes\u2014no, it didn\u2019t come in the mail.",
        "Q: They delivered it?",
        "A: Some came delivered and some came registered.",
        "Q: And who delivered it. Do you remember?",
        "A: Gestapo.",
        "Q: Gestapo delivered it? And how did it come to you? Someone delivered it to the door?",
        "A: Yes, I believe somebody delivered it. I don\u2019t know who took the notice because there were\nabout eight families living in that one apartment.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And we read the notice, and everybody said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do. Pack what you\ncan. Take three suitcases, and the rest just leave. We\u2019ll give it away or whatever.\u201d There\nwasn\u2019t much.",
        "Q: Left anyway. Right.",
        "A: No. No. And we reported.",
        "Q: So, what did you take?",
        "A: I took a coat. I took some clothing, but there wasn\u2019t much. I took what little I had. And I had\na little small briefcase, and I put some stationary into it, and some addresses, and some letters\nI had received from friends in Palestine, and that I carried with me and everything else was\nchecked. And after two days or a day and a half, then it was called Lodz, and it still stands\nand I was inside in September, and I asked the director, \u201cDo you know what this place was?\u201d\nin 1941, and he knew. There were 1,100 of us \u2014 men, women and children. The Jewish\nCommunity sent some representatives to tell us that it would be okay and not to worry. There\nwere some prominent leaders of the community on that particular list. It was the first\ntransport. We were put into cars, railroad cars, with wooden benches. And after two days,\ntwo and a half days, we arrived in a very sunny, dusty place \u2014 no railroad station, no\npersonnel, nothing.",
        "Q: Excuse me, what was the trip like?",
        "A: The trip was quiet except for whimpering children. There was more children on there or\nyoung people on that train.",
        "Q: This wasn\u2019t a cattle car with nothing in it.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: This had benches?",
        "A: Benches.",
        "Q: On the sides of the cars?",
        "A: No, the way \u2014 regular wooden benches \u2014 the way you have them now in an upholstered train.",
        "Q: And was there a toilet?",
        "A: Not that I recall.",
        "Q: Did you remember how one...?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I think they had buckets in the hallway, and each compartment had a sliding\ndoor. The windows were locked from the outside. So were the doors, and on the outside were\nGerman soldiers riding along the guns.",
        "Q: And did you bring food as well? Or did they feed you?",
        "A: No, no. We brought little candy, a few pieces of bread. It was a custom in Europe anyway,\nwhen you went on a train, you packed your own food. You never went to the dining car. So,\nwe did take some food, and the lady next to us gave us some candy. And that\u2019s all I\nremember \u2014 I remember about the ride. Nobody really spoke because the uncertainty and the\nbewilderment was still strong that you couldn\u2019t put it into words.",
        "Q: Did you meet somebody named Julie and Julius?",
        "A: Yes, they sat next to us.",
        "Q: On the train. This couple sat next to you.",
        "A: Next to us on the train. We started to talk, and she asked me, \u201cDo you know the Rosenbergs\nin Hamburg?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, Latti went to school with me. We were good friends.\u201d She said,\n\u201cDid you know her ten year older brother, Howard?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, ve met Howard once, but\nhe didn\u2019t talk to little girls ten years younger.\u201d She said, \u201cOh, my husband was a friend of\nHoward\u2019s.\u201d I said, \u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d",
        "Q: And that was it?",
        "A: That was it.",
        "Q: Did you like her?",
        "A: Yes, she had red hair that was turning gray. She was chubby. She had a wonderful smile. She\nhad teeth that had never been corrected that were spaced too far apart. It was said later on\nthat she was called as a young girl \u201cRed Fox\u201d and she supposedly was a beauty. And her\nhusband was small, bald, chubby, and a little bit crumpy (ph) and quiet, but nice.",
        "Q: And was she the age of your mother?",
        "A: No, much older.",
        "Q: Much older.",
        "A: My mother was born in \u201992. She must have been born at least six, seven years earlier. Maybe\nten years earlier.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to suggest that we take a break now, and when we come back we will begin with\nthe entrance into Lodz. Okay?",
        "A: Okay, fine.",
        "Q: Lucille, there\u2019s one piece of the earlier story that we neglected. There may be many pieces,\nbut one piece that I know about that we neglected. Namely the putting on of the Jewish star.\nAnd you do have a story of taking it off and going somewhere.",
        "A: Well, we were ordered to wear the star \u2014 left-hand side, not on the back, just in front, and it\nwas 1941.1 think it was September. And you were very conspicuous, more so than ever,\nwhich was not a happy situation. And we had a neighbor in the apartment in which we lived\nwho was half Jewish. She had some privileges that we did not have, but she was kind. She\nwas quite elderly probably in her late \u201960s, and very plain-looking, almost like a woman from\nthe country, and she didn\u2019t have to wear a star. And since I loved opera since I was about 10\nyears old, she suggested one evening that we go to the Staats Opera in Hamburg, and I told\nher that I could not with my star. I was not permitted. And she said, \u201cJust take it off. You go\nwith me, and we stand in the last row, standing room only, and nobody will know the\ndifference.\u201d It didn\u2019t make a difference. We enjoyed the opera, but I really worried a great\ndeal.",
        "Q: And what was the opera?",
        "A: It was a German opera. I think it could have been the Freischutz by Karl Maria Von Weber,\nbut I wouldn\u2019t swear to it.",
        "Q: You\u2019ve liked opera since you were 10?",
        "A: Yes, my parents took my first to the easy ones \u2014 Magic Flute, La Boheme \u2014 the French and\nthe Italians. And since I played music, it \u2014 I was not fond of a concert, but I loved opera.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes, and I still do.",
        "Q: So do I. Why didn\u2019t you like concerts?",
        "A: Because when I grew up, a lot of the concerts were composers that I was not too fond of, and\nI preferred chamber music. It\u2019s more intimate. You get more out of the music. I like baroque\nmusic. I recently listened to Malas (ph) Symphony, and I enjoyed it, but it was \u2014 it was hard\nwork to listen.",
        "Q: It\u2019s interesting because chamber music is often a taste for somebody who\u2019s much older.",
        "A: I grew up with it. I grew up with it. Both my kids play woodwinds, or used to play\nwoodwinds, baroque flute, piccolo, clarinet. So, chamber music was very much taken for\ngranted. My husband loved chamber music. He loved Telemann, and I never asked why or\nhow come, it just was natural.",
        "Q: And did you continue to play violin?",
        "A: No. I gave it up with the deportation to Poland.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And I never touched another-",
        "Q: Another instrument?",
        "A: Another instrument, no. I would never go back to it.",
        "Q: Why do you think?",
        "A: Well, first of all, I had to give up the instrument itself, which was not a Stradivarius, but it\nwas a good instrument. And something about the orchestra \u2014 two of my friends played in it in\nAuschwitz \u2014 made me decide not to go back to it. I also would never buy a pair of boots.\nBoots became very fashionable a few years ago. I can\u2019t buy a pair of boots, but that\u2019s another\nStory.",
        "Q: We\u2019ll come back to that.",
        "A: All right.",
        "Q: So, now we\u2019re going to enter Lodz.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: When you think of the first moment that you got off the train, what did you see?",
        "A: I saw the German soldiers lined up. The railroad cars were opened. We were ordered to come\nout. We were ordered to line up in rows of five, and we saw a whole group of men in black\njackets, black trouser, a black hat with an orange band, an orange arm band with the Star of\nDavid, and on their jackets were also yellow stars. The Germans handed us over to these\nmen. The name given to them was \u201cghetto police\u201d. The ground was sandy. It was dirty. It\nwas not a railroad station. We saw a wagon drawn by two horses and our suitcases were\nthrown on that wagon. The Germans went back into the trains, and the ghetto police\nexplained to us \u2014 mostly in Polish, and hardly anybody spoke Polish \u2014 that we had to walk\ninto the ghetto. My mother, who stood next to me, asked the first available policeman in\nPolish, \u201c\u201cWhere are we? What is the ghetto? What\u2019s going on?\u201d And on the hour and a half or\ntwo-hour walk, and it was very warm and there were many elderly people, he explained to\nmy mother that it was the city of Lodz, which was familiar to her. It was the ghetto, which\nwas an area that was totally enclosed. And as we kept on walking, we saw people that didn\u2019t\nlook at us. They looked ragged. They looked tired. They looked ill-fed and ill-dressed. And\nwe saw buildings that were dilapidated. Some were \u2014 some streets were paved; others were\nnot. We saw no vehicles. We saw no automobiles. We saw no trucks. But he explained to my\nmother, and she translated, that the ghetto was an area that was fenced in and guarded by\nGermans. There was no into the ghetto; there was no out of the ghetto. And my mother made\na very flippant remark, \u201cWell, if you want to get out of this situation, you always can.\u201d And\nhe said, \u201cHardly.\u201d They walked us to a school on Mlynarska Street. This school evidently\nhad been abandoned, and they housed all 1,100 of us on two, possibly three, stories in what\nused to be classrooms, lecture rooms. We eventually got our suitcases. We put our coats or\nwhoever had a blanket on the floor, and that\u2019s how we lived for six weeks. The Jewish ghetto\nadministration sent in a kitchen detail once a day to bring soup. This soup was mainly water,\nvery little else. In the mornings, we received sometimes a slice of bread and a liquid that was\nbitter tasting and supposed to look like coffee, but it had a grainy substance. It had no coffee.\nAnd at that point, most of us still had some money, which we had brought from Germany.\nSome of it sewn into shoulder pads, into belts, into shoes. And those of us who had some\nmoney \u2014 some more, others less \u2014 you could go into the courtyard and the people who had\nlived in the ghetto since 1940 when it was first closed would sell out of newspaper a little\npiece of bread, a chunk of margarine, anything edible, and we would buy it with this German\nmoney, not realizing that the currency in the ghetto was not German money. It was special\nghetto-printed money similar to Monopoly money, and that we were by far overpaying.\nWhen we ran out of the money, we would sell some of our so-called \u201cwestern\u201d belongings \u2014\na silk blouse, a silk scarf, an alligator purse \u2014 whatever any family had brought along and it\nwas deemed no longer necessary, superfluous, and it brought in some food. These things\nwere not sold for money. They were bartered for food. I remember seeing my mother in the\ncourtyard bartering for bread and margarine against a silk blouse.",
        "Q: How big of a \u2014 like a small piece of bread?",
        "A: Oh, I would say maybe 200 grams \u2014 a small piece of bread. The ghetto bread was about \u2014 it\nwas a round loaf of bread. It had to last at that point a week, and we cut it into seven or eight\nwedges once we got our permanent food rations. And I took my mother\u2019s example, and I had\na purse. And when she did not realize it, I did the same thing. I traded the purse for some\nbread. It was traded to a young woman a little older than I was, who came with a very good-\nlooking gentleman probably ten years older who had a briefcase, and he wanted to give me\none piece of bread and I said, \u201cIt\u2019s too little.\u201d And they laughed. They didn\u2019t speak German\nand I didn\u2019t speak Polish, but we managed. And I stood there for two hours and eventually\nthey came back and I got two pieces of bread. But even that had limitation because you ran\nout of tradable goods. Nobody had jewelry. That had to be left for the Germans. And what\nwas left was really the bare essentials, not more than that. After six weeks, we were assigned\nto various rooms.",
        "Q: Stop for a minute. What happens to washing and sanitary conditions? There\u2019s no bathrooms\nin the place. There\u2019s no showers, bathtubs, nothing. So, what happens to you physically?",
        "A: There was a pump in the courtyard, and if you knew somebody with either a bowl or a\nbucket, you would borrow it. In the beginning, we had some soap, but you use up soap and\nthen you make do without soap. This school had outhouses in the backyard. The outhouses\nwere used by 1,100 people. They were filthy. They were unsanitary. People got sick. There\nwere accidents. You washed and we used to call it a cat\u2019s wash because you really couldn\u2019t\nwash. There was no privacy. There was no place. There was no room. I remember standing in\na corner holding up a blanket. My mother was behind the blanket washing and vice versa. So,\nsanitary conditions didn\u2019t exist. At night, we slept on the floor. In the daytime, we sat on the\nfloor. Crowded, one body next to the other. And eventually, six weeks later, we were\nassigned to various rooms throughout the ghetto on both sides of the bridges. The older part\nof the ghetto was the Balut, the former slum of the city. It used to house Jews and non-Jews,\nbut had been vacated for Jews only. We were fortunate enough to be settled in the little\nnewer section on the front side of the bridge. We shared a probably 10 by 10 foot room with\nfour other people. We had two or three wooden cots. My mother brought a little wardrobe so\nwe didn\u2019t have to hang the clothing on the damp walls. The view out of the window was a\nbarbed wire and the red century house with a German marching up and down. So, we did not\ngo near the window. At night, you had to put a black sheet over the window so no light could\ncome out because it was wartime. And the room had a little cast iron stove, but there was no\nlumber. We slowly took out of the wooden cots one board at a time, cut it up for heat and for\ncooking. We were issued ration cards, and the food distribution centers were throughout the\nghettos. The intervals of the spaces between them were several kilometers. When a food\nration was announced or posted on the walls, it gave a date when it would be available, and\nhow much, and what items. You had to bring your own containers, and during the first week,\nyou stood in line for about three hours until you got your food. If you waited beyond that,\nthere were no more lines but sometimes the food ran out.",
        "Q: And this was hot food.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No, this was-",
        "A: This was a little bit of brown sugar at a time, a little bit of what they called ground coffee, a\nloaf of bread for a certain period of time, sometimes there was flour. Once I got horsemeat,\nbut only once. And it was not really enough to sustain a human being. And the conversation\nwherever you went centered around food. The houses had no running water. You had to carry\na bucket up and a bucket down with dirty water. There were no bathrooms. The toilets were\nouthouses in the backyard. There were no showers. There were no bathtubs. There was no\ntransportation within the ghetto to get from one place to another. There was an internal police\nforce. There was a fire brigade. I don\u2019t think it was ever used, and aside from the police force\nthere was a Sonder force, that meant special police with special orders, with more difficult\ntasks which larger, with larger food allotments, and some of these men were decent, and\nsome were brutal.",
        "Q: Lucille, let\u2019s stop now and change the tape.\nEnd of Tape 2\nTape 3",
        "Q: Lucille, I usually don\u2019t do this, but I wanted to give a sense to those people who will watch\nthe interview that, as far as I know, there were over 31,000 departments in the Lodz ghetto,\nand a little over 700 had running water. Just for a people to get a sense of this population of\nover 200,000 people, what you were living in, in terms of the sheer physical conditions let\nalone everything else.",
        "A: None of my friends or acquaintances had running water. I had one friend that I did not know\nuntil after the war who lived in the parsonage of a church and there was running water, but\nnobody knew. There were houses out in Marysin, where Rumkowski lived, they had running\nwater. It was the slum of a city. Running water was not the customary thing to have. The city\nalso didn\u2019t have a sewer system. The sewage ran between the street and the sidewalk, raw\nsewage, and you jumped over it as you crossed the street. There was no underground\ncanalization like for instance in Warsaw or in Paris or in Rome. It didn\u2019t exist.",
        "Q: So, the stench must have been unbelievable.",
        "A: So, was the typhus \u2014 the stench, the typhus, the summers, the snow and frost in the winter,\nand people just dumped their buckets and it didn\u2019t matter. It \u2014 you had ceased to care, to\nobserve sanitary conditions or laws. There was really no way one could solve this problem. It\nwas \u2014 it was not solvable.",
        "Q: So, I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of time. Those first six weeks, this is the most shocking\nthing that happens to you \u2014 I mean, other than the shock of the death of your father, but that\u2019s\na different kind of a shock. This 1s a physical as well as a psychological shock to you to be\ntaken to Lodz and to be living under conditions that you\u2019ve never come \u2014 you\u2019ve never lived\nlike this.",
        "A: Nope. It was a shock, and yet we believed, in the first six weeks, that once we get housing,\nonce we get a room in a building, be it wood or concrete, conditions would be more\nnormalized. It never really occurred to us that most buildings would not have a bathroom. I\nthought there would be maybe a bathroom on each floor or a shower. The ghetto did have a\nbathhouse, but you needed a coupon to get in. The ghetto had a laundry. Once I had a coupon\nand I bought some sheets, and it took me six months to get them back. They were sort of\nwashed, but six months because the laundry did work for the Germans and for the higher-ups\nwithin the ghetto. So, while some of the civilized amenities were within the ghetto, they were\nfar and in between.",
        "Q: And, during this, before you moved to Pawia Street, these first four to six weeks, do you see\n\u2014 you\u2019re living with 1,100 people in a very small building. Do people change a lot? Do\npeople start fighting with each other? Do you see things even amongst the three of you where\nthere are changes and it\u2019s difficult?",
        "A: It was stressful. People did argue. \u201cThis was my space and why did you take my space?\u201d And\n\u201ctake this away and put this there.\u201d It was community living at its worst. It brought out the\nvery best in very few people. It brought out the worst in most of us. And I don\u2019t think\nanybody was really to blame because to come out of the normal life into conditions of\ndeprivation, of inhumanity, dehumanization \u2014 it\u2019s indescribable.",
        "Q: How\u2019d your mother change?",
        "A: She became very quiet. When we first came into the ghetto, she thought, because she spoke\nPolish, she had lived among Poles, she had lived among Jews in Poland, she was educated in\nLwow, she thought it would be manageable. It would be possibly a little bit the way her life\nhad been before the first World War. But I don\u2019t think she fully expected the hunger, and the\nfilth, and the sickness within the ghetto. That was something that was incomprehensible.",
        "Q: Your sister is 11, and you\u2019re 16. So, what is it for her? Is 1t harder for her because she\u2019s so\nmuch younger? Or is it not harder?",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t harder for her. She just took it more or less in stride. She didn\u2019t quite\nunderstand what this was all about. She once asked about the barbed wires or the soldiers\nwith guns. She remarked once on the lack of a playground. Or she wanted a little roll with\nbutter and there were no rolls in the ghetto. But she did not \u2014 it did not have a full impact on\nher, not at that point.",
        "Q: Did she have friends?",
        "A: No, nobody.",
        "Q: Nobody had them.",
        "A: Nobody.",
        "Q: So, the kids did not play.",
        "A: There were very few kids. There were mainly elderly people. There were quite a few\nteenagers, but kids eight or 10 far in between.",
        "Q: What about you? What happened to you during those first couple of months?",
        "A: Well, I went throughout the building to see if there was anybody I knew. I met a couple of\nclassmates, schoolmates. I looked at the young people who brought the soup, and laid out the\nportions. And I was guessing or thinking how does one get a job like that, but I had trouble\nwith the language. I could understand some of the Yiddish, and Polish I had probably a dozen\nwords, no more. So, there was no communication. There was no possibility to make any\nconnection.",
        "Q: But, there are, I don\u2019t know, at least a few thousand Germans who went into the Lodz ghetto,\nam I right?",
        "A: Over a period of time.",
        "Q: But not when you came?",
        "A: Not when we came. Later on, there were transports \u2014 several from Berlin, several from\nVienna, five from Prague, one from Frankfurt. I think there were in excess of 20,000 people\nbrought in from what was called \u201cWestern Europe.\u201d At that time, we were told we didn\u2019t\nread it and we didn\u2019t hear it, of a speech made by Rumkowski that 20,000 Jews had been\nbrought in from the West and there was neither enough housing for them, and the Germans\nwould make no allowances for it, and there was not enough food for them. It was considered\na tremendous burden on the already existing ghetto population. And we were very\nunwelcome. We were made fun of. We were the ones from the West, the spoiled ones, the\narrogant ones. And in a way, it was true. The majority of the German Jews especially, not so\nmuch the Czechs, came with the idea, or at least if they didn\u2019t come with it, it started within\nthe ghetto, \u201cWe will teach them how to do things here, and we will change things in the\nghetto. And we will run the ghetto the way we are used to running things in Germany.\u201d And\nthat turned out to be a big mistake.",
        "Q: Because there was a lot of hostility?",
        "A: There was a lot of hostility, and you can\u2019t walk into somebody else\u2019s house and turn it\nupside-down. And of course, the Polish Jews would not hold still for 1t, which resulted in the\nfact that there was no employment for us. We were by and large disliked. We were called\nnames, not nasty names, but not flattering names either. You felt almost like an outcast\namong your own people.",
        "Q: So, you were in \u2014 it\u2019s not the same situation you were in Germany with the Nazis or the\nGerman non-Jews against you. But there\u2019s somewhat of a similarity within the context of this\nhorrible situation.",
        "A: Yes, but I was used to this situation. I went to a German-Jewish school. And the school had\nabout ten children who had Polish parents. And when this became known, the parents of the\n\u2014 of all those students said, \u201cDon\u2019t play with those Polish Jews.\u201d So, it was Jew against Jew\non the one side. It was the same again now. And that, at that very beginning, something told\nme that you were sitting again between two chairs. If you want to live here in any way and\nget work, you have to learn the language - Yiddish and Polish. And it was hard; there was no\nschool.",
        "Q: So, how did you learn?",
        "A: By listening and by talking. And I made horrible mistakes but people smiled. They thought it\nwas very cute that a 16 year old would at least try. It took me six months and I spoke Polish\ngrammatically incorrect. I didn\u2019t know if two houses were male or female, but it didn\u2019t\nmatter. People found it amusing, and it helped. It gave me a chance at communication.",
        "Q: And, your mother could speak.",
        "A: My mother was educated and she spoke Polish, and French, and German.",
        "Q: Did she try to get a job or was she \u2014 or did she not even try?",
        "A: She tried at very first, but nobody would hire in 1941. There was not enough work within the\nghetto to fully employ everybody. Work was not mandatory; it was not considered forced\nlabor. You worked and you received the noontime soup. But you didn\u2019t have to work if you\ndidn\u2019t want to. It afforded you no other privileges.",
        "Q: Except the noontime soup.",
        "A: Right, because money was very little and worthless. So, she tried for a while in the felt shoe\nfactory and in the hat factory, but they wouldn\u2019t hire her.",
        "Q: So, the people who are working are getting noontime soup plus the rations that you are all\ngetting. And you would cook these rations in your little room \u2014 or try to.",
        "A: If we had enough material to hit the little stove because sometimes you got items that weren\u2019t\neven combinable or cookable, but we would try in the evening. And if you shared a room,\nand you had a corner for your food supplies or a shelf, 1t very often happened that by evening\nsomething had disappeared. Somebody in the room was so hungry, they couldn\u2019t resist. That\nwas very, very common.",
        "Q: So, how quickly did you feel that you were starving?",
        "A: I think with \u2014 within two months, maybe two and a half months. We were definitely starving\nby the end of the year, before Christmastime.",
        "Q: And thirsty, I would imagine, or not?",
        "A: We did drink the water.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s why we got typhus. It was really not much else to drink because it was difficult to\nheat up water, to bring it to a boil, and to make this so-called coffee that we were distributed.\nI remember one ration and it was four pounds of salt. I remember a ration of a half a pound\nof citric acid. Citric acid thrown into a pot of raw vegetables makes it boil faster, but what are\nyou going to do with that quantity. It was a senseless type of distribution, but the food was\ndistributed the way it came into the ghetto from Germany. There were, we heard, other items,\nbut they were in small supply and they went to the elite of the ghetto administration, not to\nuS.",
        "Q: I\u2019m worried about the sound. Is that going to be all right?\n[Break in tape]",
        "Q: Could you take some of these rations and go to this market \u2014 there was an outdoor market,\nand try to get some food of some kind, or was there very little?",
        "A: Again, during the first six months there was an outside area where you could buy a rotten\napple or frozen potato, or whatever anybody else would like to sell. You could trade. You\ncould barter, but 1t was pretty senseless. You didn\u2019t gain much by it. And the market\neventually just closed down for lack of interest and for lack of supplies.",
        "Q: So, let me ask you something. So, you\u2019re in Pawia Street, in the end of November, beginning\nof December? Something like that?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Now, your mother\u2019s 50\" birthday is January 5\".",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: 1942.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And she\u2019s beginning to deteriorate at this point.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: With a disease or by starvation, her body is...?",
        "A: Well, starvation takes a strange form. Your body swells. Your legs and your feet become\ndouble its normal size. It is difficult to walk. You can\u2019t get into a pair of shoes. Those are the\nfirst signs of starvation. It does ultimately affect you in other ways, as well. It is just that the\nbody responds to lack of nourishment.",
        "Q: And this is what was happening to her?",
        "A: This was happening to her and thousands of others.",
        "Q: So, what could you do for her? Was there anything that could be done? Did you try with\nsome desperation to get food, to get more food, rather?",
        "A: The only thing that I could try is sell whatever of my clothing I did not need or I did not\nwant. And that I gradually sold for food, but I didn\u2019t have much clothing to start out with,\nand I only had two pair of shoes in not very good condition. Shoes would have brought a lot\nof money. The stockings were in such disrepair that the repairs on the back of the heel\nreached halfway up to the knee. We kept repairing it with thread because you couldn\u2019t buy\nnew ones. But you could buy a lipstick.",
        "Q: What?",
        "A: The ghetto had a little cosmetic store half a block from Balutaring. And I guess the lady must\nhave had a cosmetic store before the war, and you could go and buy powder or lipstick, and\non the corner was a hairdresser and you could get a permanent if you had the right currency\nor enough food.",
        "Q: And there were enough people to keep open this cosmetic store who would buy things?",
        "A: Ido not how much rent they paid. I don\u2019t know who owned the building. It was a little shack.\nThere was demand. The ladies or women who were in fact within the ghetto were well-\ndressed. They wore hats. They wore decent boots or shoes, and they wore cosmetics. The\nghetto had several tiny little holes in the wall and you could get a manicure for one Mark.\nBut you had to have the Mark.",
        "Q: And I gather you never did that.",
        "A: I did it once.",
        "Q: Did you?",
        "A: Yes. I once had a Mark. I just wanted to now what it was like.",
        "Q: Because you had never had one before?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: And what did you think?",
        "A: I think \u2014 I thought it was totally superfluous. It was ridiculous, but I liked to see people with\nthat bright red nail polish, which I\u2019ve never worn since. And it was very fashionable because\nwomen, Jewish women in L\u00e9dz, were very elegant, emancipated, very Western, very anti-\nreligious customs, and quite different from what I had expected.",
        "Q: So, they were more modern in some ways than where you came from.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: If one wants to use that kind of terminology.",
        "A: But, then, I also was older than \u2014 than I observed the same circumstances as a child. So, I\nwas more aware.",
        "Q: Did you ever buy lipstick?",
        "A: My mother had a lipstick that she had bought in Paris during the World\u2019s Fair. I think it was\n\u00b036 or something like that, and I used that lipstick.",
        "Q: So, you did use lipstick.",
        "A: Later on, not right away, later on as I got older.",
        "Q: Did your mother make-up herself so you would look better?",
        "A: Before the war, she used lipstick but then she rubbed it off so it wouldn\u2019t be so obvious. She\nhad her hair done once a week.",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about Germany now.",
        "A: Yes, and she used powder and other cosmetics, but it was of no interest to me.",
        "Q: So, when your mother begins to take on the symptoms of what one might call the disease of\nstarvation, the diseases that come with starvation, do you kids sit in the house \u2014 the apartment\nwith her?",
        "A: We did at first, and then one evening we had knock at the door. It must have been around\nJanuary. And in walked a short little man by the name of Adolf Goetz, and he had lived\naround the corner from us in Hamburg on Holle Street. We lived on Braumsen Way (ph). We\ndidn\u2019t know him but we\u2019d wave from the back window. He had a short little wife with very\ncurly hair and she used to shake out her rugs off the balcony. And he came in with another\nman and he used to be a dentist in Hamburg. I think it was Rosenblum. And he had\nremembered us and he said to my mother, \u201cI have been given permission to open an office.\nWould you allow your daughter to work in that office?\u201d My mother said, \u201cSure.\u201d \u201cWell, she\ndoesn\u2019t get much money. You know how it is, but she\u2019 Il get a daily soup.\u201d Adolph Goetz had\na terrific sense of humor. He was probably not even five foot tall. He wore glasses, and he\nhad a funny face that you would expect to see in a cartoon, a very pinched little face. He had\nbeen a playwright. He had been an engineer. He had a son in South America some place, and\nhe convinced Rumkowski that the ghetto needed improvement and beautification. And he\nhired probably a dozen architects and engineers that had come from Prague on this so-called\nIntelligenz transport, as they called themselves because everybody had a college degree,\namong them the general director of Schoda (ph), which was Dr. Reich. And they were\nsupposed to draw up blue prints with parks, with schools, with trees, with playgrounds. And I\nwas supposed to do some typing, but I couldn\u2019t type very well, and write the explanations to\nthese blueprints. And every once in a while Adolph Goetz would take the blueprints to\nBalutaring, to Rumkowski, and Rumkowski seemed enthused. And we got the midday soup.\nThe office was on Rybn, 8. And oh, Adolph must have been in his late \u201960s at a guess, and\nfor fun he wrote poems and he wrote stories. And he would make little airplanes out of them,\nand just sort of fly them over the office onto my desk. That went on for several months. I\ndidn\u2019t know what to make it, but it was sort of funny. But he complained bitterly about the\nlack of food, but the office remained for about six months, and then he was summoned by\nRumkowsk1, and he was told, \u201cI\u2019m terminating the office. I\u2019m closing down the office. And\nall of you can look for other jobs.\u201d In the meantime, he had gotten double rations, which of\ncourse I didn\u2019t know. And he was really unhappy for himself and for us, as well. And\neverybody tried to get a job someplace else. Dr. Reich went to work for the lumber\ndepartment for Goodman. Some others found employment some place else, and by then it\nwas July. And my mother died on the 30\" of July 1942 of hunger.",
        "Q: Were you with her?",
        "A: No, I was not at home. It happened in the afternoon, and the next day the black little wagon\nwith the white horse came and picked up the dead bodies throughout the ghetto. We did not\nhear. My sister and I walked to the Jewish cemetery in Marysin, about a two-hour walk. And\nin the burial hall, we went through hundreds of bodies. And most bodies were between two\nboards, wooden boards, tied together with a string and a name tag. We found my mother\u2019s\nbody. And we took two shovels. And we looked for a plot and there were no more plots left\non the cemetery. So, we found a walkway, and we spent that July day digging a grave until it\nwas deep enough to bury her. We put a wooden marker on it. We scratched the name with a\nstone on the marker, and we walked back. From that day on, I think, my sister stopped\ntalking.",
        "Q: Stopped?",
        "A: Talking. I couldn\u2019t get through to her. I looked around for a school for her. I couldn\u2019t find a\nschool. But I heard that one of the factories in the back room employed children, but it\nactually was a school. I tried several. And I was asked by the directors of the factories, \u201cIf I\ngive you a place for your sister, what will you give me in return?\u201d And I explained that I had\nno jewelry nor did I have money. And the answer was laughter. I did not comprehend. In the\nend, I did find her a place. I asked her if she enjoyed it, if she learned Polish, if there were\nother children \u2014 she wouldn\u2019t answer. And, I, in the meantime, looked for work. I found\nsome work in the factory sewing ladies\u2019 dresses, but it was a two hour walk to Marysin. And\nI worked at a machine for a while. And the interesting part in that factory was that it\nemployed young people my age, a little older, and they were very intent on striking, on\nasking for more food. One young woman named Fajga made us walk, those willing to walk,\naround the courtyard, \u201cNo food. No work.\u201d It took an hour, and the police \u2014 the Jewish\nghetto police \u2014 came into the courtyard and took her away. She returned the next day a little\nbit black and blue, and she laughed.",
        "Q: She laughed?",
        "A: She laughed. She had a boyfriend and she said, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to give up. We\u2019re going to\norganize for food.\u201d By that time, I got afraid. But there were brave souls who still marched,\n\u201cNo Food, no soup, no work.\u201d \u201cNo food, no work\u201d in Yiddish and Polish, and she was taken\naway a second time. The first time she was warned to cease and desist, not by Rumkowsk1,\nbut by someone who was sent by him. And when she was taken the second time, she didn\u2019t\nreturn for a week. She came back in very bad shape: black and blue, a missing tooth, and she\nno longer demonstrated. By then it was September, and the announcements were of the\nghetto \u2014 No, first Rumkowski made a speech that the Germans had demanded that the old\nand the very young be deported from the ghetto, and he had to comply with German orders.",
        "Q: Can I - because these are the big deportations \u2014 can I go back a little bit?",
        "A: Yes, there was one in May that I had skipped.",
        "Q: May of \u201942, before your mother died.",
        "A: Yes, and that took out most of the elderly Jews that had come from the West, most of them\nwith very few exceptions. We were on the list. And I took our three Polish passports. And I\nwent from one administration to the other to convince them that we were not German. And\nsomebody in the administration who worked for Neftalin, his name was Kaplan, finally, after\ntwo days agreed to delete our names and we stayed. That was in May before my mother died.",
        "Q: And did you have an instinct that another deportation couldn\u2019t possibly be better?",
        "A: We had the instinct \u2014 here we knew of the misery. If you go someplace else, what is going to\nawait us? We had no idea. And I would say by an old Jewish saying, \u201cWhat you have you\nhave. You know, you know your enemy. If you go someplace else, what will you have?\u201d We\ndid not know. So, the instinct \u2014 our instinct was \u2014 I don\u2019t know how other people felt because\nwe had very, very little contact with other Jews that had come from the West except for the\nEichengreens, who really didn\u2019t care. They thought it couldn\u2019t be worse.",
        "Q: This is Jules and Julius.",
        "A: Right, and \u2014 but, we decided, my mother and I, that it would be better to stay.",
        "Q: And your mother by then is not very well, anyway.",
        "A: No, she was not well. It was my doing that we were permitted to stay, because I ran around\nwith these Polish passports speaking German. And people just looked at me. They just\nlaughed. It was a joke. It couldn\u2019t be for real. Somebody who has a nationality can speak the\nlanguage, but in the end, they agreed. We could stay. After my mother died...",
        "Q: I want to ask you a question. It\u2019s very unusual, I think, for two children to not metaphorically\nbury their mother but to really bury...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: ...one of their parents.",
        "A: You never forget.",
        "Q: I would imagine. It must have been one of the worst days of your life in your memory.",
        "A: Ihave not been back to a funeral for 50 years. And I\u2019ve had friends and relatives die, and I\ncould not go. I could not go to my father\u2019s grave. I couldn\u2019t go in a cemetery. It was not\nfeasible.",
        "Q: How did you do it, the two of you? You carried your mother\u2019s body?",
        "A: Yes, with those two boards. How did we do it? I really can\u2019t answer that.",
        "Q: And did you say to each other, \u201cWe have to bury her.\u201d",
        "A: We didn\u2019t speak.",
        "Q: You just did it.",
        "A: We just did it.",
        "Q: Did you see anyone else doing that?",
        "A: No. It was a hot July, on the 20\" of July, maybe 21\u00b0. We didn\u2019t see a soul. There was no\ncaretaker. There were no gravediggers. There was nobody.",
        "Q: Were you crying when you were digging?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You were just digging.",
        "A: No tears.",
        "Q: And did you say prayers?",
        "A: No, no prayers.",
        "Q: You just finished and left?",
        "A: And left.",
        "Q: And did you and Karin hold hands walking back to hold on to each other.",
        "A: I think we did because it was a long walk.",
        "Q: And did you go back home?",
        "A: We went back to the room.",
        "Q: Home.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And clearly you did not whatever sitting shiva would be, you did not.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So, there\u2019s no \u2014 you can\u2019t mourn, you just have to-",
        "A: No, there was \u2014 whether you shut out the feelings consciously or whether there just were no\nmore feelings left, I will never know.",
        "Q: So, you never cried.",
        "A: Not then.",
        "Q: Not then. And Karin simply stops talking.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I mean, really physically-",
        "A: Really physically stopped talking. \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d was about the most I got out of her.",
        "Q: And do you know whether she was talking when she went to school, or did she...?",
        "A: I assume not, but I never went to the school because I had to go to work. I assumed she didn\u2019t\ntalk.",
        "Q: And of course in that circumstance so many people were suffering, who\u2019s going to take care\nof this little kid?",
        "A: Right, and then there were other little kids. She wasn\u2019t the only one.",
        "Q: Now, you tell this story about this person who says, \u201cWhat will you give in exchange?\u201d You\ndid not understand. What do you understand now? What was he doing?",
        "A: Well, I learned in three years in the ghetto, that you pay for sex \u2014 you pay with sex for a\nfavor, but I did not understand it then.",
        "Q: So, you came to understand that this was not an unusual feature of the ghetto for women?",
        "A: Not within the next \u2014 within the following two years.",
        "Q: You learned that.",
        "A: That I learned, but not in 1942. In \u201943 and 44, yes.",
        "Q: Okay, so September comes...",
        "A: And the first I heard from a young messenger who delivered messages from the\nadministration. She was a dwarf \u2014 crippled, Jewish, grew up in the orphanage.",
        "Q: In the old orphanage?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Where was it?",
        "A: Helenowek.",
        "Q: Helenowek.",
        "A: She was very, very poor. They lived in one room in a little suburb. She had a brother and a\nsister older, no mother, and a father, and she told me that Rumkowski had made a speech that\nmorning, or would make a speech the next morning.",
        "Q: Now, this is Branya.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: The essence of the speech was that the Germans had demanded 20,000 sick, elderly, and\nchildren, most of them children to be sent out of the ghetto. And the wording of the speech\nwas, and that I think is a matter of record, \u201cMothers and fathers, give me your children so\nthat the rest of us may live and survive.\u201d There were outcries, maybe a stone or two were\nthrown, but police was present. He tried to explain that he tried to negotiate that they\nwouldn\u2019t take children over 11 years of age, but they would have to take the sick. He got the\nnumber decreased by a thousand and various other justifications. Those who heard the speech\nand those who found about it were appalled. It was \u2014 the concept was unthinkable. During\nthe process, that the deportation was announced by Rumkowski, and by the time he had the\nlists on the streets of the people written up, the Germans got angry and impatient. They\nenforced a curfew of seven days starting in September, I believe it was the 7\". We were not\nsupposed to be out on the street for seven days and seven nights. The Germans came into the\nghetto with trucks, with dogs and with guns. They went from street to street and from house\nto house, and the square area of the ghetto was not very large. And it went house by house.\nThey came to our street. We had a neighbor sit on the roof and look out. And when they\nentered the courtyard, they shouted for everybody to assemble in the courtyard. And then\nthey went into the building and found those who had hidden. They beat them and put them on\nthe truck. And then the looked at the remainder of those standing in the courtyard, probably\n60 people, and within five minutes, they separated the old and the young from the more fit\nhuman beings. My sister, although she was 11 years old, not 10, was taken. I tried to go onto\nthe truck with her. The guns stopped me. The truck drove off. My neighbor\u2019s mother was\ntaken \u2014 many people out of the building. He was a policeman. He couldn\u2019t get his mother\nreleased. We never found out where they were taken, what was done with them, where they\nsupposedly were resettled, in what labor camp they might have been sent. But eventually, a\nfew packages of clothing came back into the ghetto. And supposedly \u2014 I did not see it \u2014 some\nof the clothing was blood-stained. Actual notes or actual letters I don\u2019t believe were found.\nNobody could give us an answer. We hoped that they were alive \u2014 someplace, somewhere.\nAnd the curfew was lifted after seven days, and life continued for the rest of us. It was almost\nas 1f we had been hypnotized, as if we just \u2014 we just went on. We went to work. We collected\nthe soup. We collected the food ration. It continued. We had been robbed not of our children,\nbut of our feelings, of our compassion. Some children were hidden, but very few. How he\ncould have asked to hand over the children, I did not understand at 16. I don\u2019t understand it\nnow. Did he have a choice? I would say so. Czerniakow had a choice. I mean, his life was\nnot so precious that he could not have said no. He could have refused to obey the orders. He\nwould have paid the price, but to ask this of the community is unthinkable. I was fired from\nthe dress factory. I don\u2019t know for what reason, probably incompetence. I did not sew very\nwell. And I went back to the office on Rybna, 8 because I knew a woman there from Vienna.\nAnd by then it was October, and it was cold, and we stood around the stove and I said, \u201cI\nneed a job desperately.\u201d And her boss, who sat a desk in the corner, came over. He started\ntalking to me, and by then I spoke Polish and Yiddish, and he said, \u201cIll give you a job.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cDoing what?\u201d And he said, \u201cWe have received truckloads of forms to be completed for\nthe Germans in Germany for their coal rations. And the forms have to be figured and\ncompleted. And you\u2019ll sit in the office. I need 300 people. You write down the names. People\nwill tell you they\u2019Il work here. You just get their addresses, and you just do it.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay,\nPll do it. A job is a job.\u201d His boss was Henryk Neftalin, the attorney, who was in his late 30s.\nA very fair man. A very able man. I had met his mother when I was running around with\nthose passports a year earlier. And he was much admired. The strange thing was that he had\nRumkowski\u2019s ear. When he would go to Rumkowski, he might take some abuse, but in the\nend, he would argue. And half the time, Rumkowski would listen. So, he was much admired.\nHis girlfriend worked in one of the administrative offices. Her name was Klatalka (ph). And I\nworked in that office, I would say, until 43, end of \u201943. And one day Bernard Fuchs decided\n\u2014 he was the head of the Department of Labor \u2014 that too many people worked in that office,\nand he needed people in the straw shoe factory for the Russian front. And the commission of\nseveral dignitaries came, among them Rumkowsk1i. And it was again a selection of who goes\nand who stays. And I hid pretty much to the bitter end until I was called, because they had\nmy name on the list. And Rumkowski sat on a chair. He had taken off his hat and his coat,\nand he had his cane in his right hand. And for a minute, he reminded me of a fairy tale \u2014 a\nking sitting on a throne. He spoke to me in Yiddish and he asked me my name, whether I had\nfamily, where I had come from, and in the end he said, \u201cLittle German, you may stay, and\nyou'll hear from me.\u201d He took a lot of people out of that office at that particular time.\nBernard Fuchs threw out the list as he had drawn up previous deportation lists. I had gone to\nhis office when I was jobless and asked him for employment because he was born in\nHannover, Germany, and he spoke German. And after my third visit, he lost his temper, and\nhe said that he had not jobs, that I was a pest, or the equivalent in Polish. He opened the door\nand he yelled like a German, \u201cRaus!\u201d\u2019",
        "Q: And when did this happen?",
        "A: Before I got the job-",
        "Q: With Goetz?",
        "A: -with Goetz, and then again after I lost the job with Goetz, twice. And then there was a third\ntime when I lost the job in the clothing factory. I saw him throughout the ghetto, sometimes\nin a carriage, sometimes not. He knew me because there were not many people who came\nfrom Hamburg who had been to Hannover, who could speak German. I also went for an\ninterview to Balutaring with his sister Dora Brooks. She wouldn\u2019t hire me, no reason given.",
        "Q: She was the executive secretary to Rumkowski, so she had a very high position.",
        "A: She was more than that. She was his ears and his mouth because Rumkowski could not speak\nto the Germans in any language. She could speak. She could speak Polish, and by then, with\nthe same accent I had, and she could speak German. I went to Walchovna (ph). I went to a\nwhole variety of women who were in factories. And there were many that were capable, that\nwere intelligent, but they wouldn\u2019t hire a woman. That was competition \u2014 a man, yes \u2014 a\nwoman, no. So, I went back to work, and a few weeks later, my boss Henryk Neftalin called\nme into his office and he said, \u201cI\u2019m transferring you to the Statistical Department on Plac\nKoscielny, 4.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to leave because I\u2019d become very friendly with Spiegel and I did\nnot like the unknown. But you didn\u2019t argue with Henryk Neftalin. He was fair. He was\ndecent. What his reasons were, I never knew. They could have been several. It could have\nbeen that he wanted me out of Rumkowsk1\u2019s reach. It could have been the fact that I came to\nwork one day with a very bloody face when I had been sent to the Kripo because somebody\nsaid I had a radio, and I never did have a radio. And he saw my bloody scars, my bloody\nface, my bruised eyes. He transferred me because in essence he was the actual head of the\nStatistical Department. He had the first word and the last word. It was a long way to work\nover the bridge. And 1n winter it was hard to walk, so they unshoveled snow on the bridge.\nYou slid back rather than forward. Hundreds of people cross the bridge every morning, and\nyou were afraid that somebody would carry lice and they would jump over on your clothing.\nThat was the greatest fear because they carried typhus. The office...",
        "Q: I want to stop. I don\u2019t like doing this, but I want to go back because you\u2019re now moving\nmuch too fast, and I really don\u2019t have much time. So, I'll tell you what we\u2019re going to do.\nWe\u2019re going to stop the tape. And then, I\u2019m going to come back and we\u2019 ll go a little bit more\nslowly.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape 3\nTape 4",
        "Q: Lucille, I want to bring us back because you moved much too quickly for me.",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry.",
        "Q: Don\u2019t be sorry, it\u2019s fine. You said when Karin was taken away, you all \u2014 and Karin 1s, well,\nshe\u2019s going with children. There\u2019s also 70,000 people, I think who\u2019s in these deportations\nduring this couple of months. Am I not right?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think 70. I think it was in May around 15 or 20, and then again in September,\nthere were a lot of smaller deportations in between a thousand or 2,000. The actual numbers I\ndon\u2019t know, but the ghetto at any one time had roughly 160,000 people.",
        "Q: But, it was a few thousand people over the course-",
        "A: Over the course, yes.",
        "Q: You said that people went on, and what you lost in some ways was your feelings. So, in order\nto go on, you clearly didn\u2019t forget Karin, but you couldn\u2019t respond to her going, I gather, in\nsome way.",
        "A: Well, I reached out for her. I tried to go with her. I was not allowed, but life in the overall\nghetto went on. People even went so far as to use, at least for a week or two, the ration card\nof a person who was deported. So, there was no \u2014 there was no feeling. There was no \u2014 there\nwas a sadness, but there was not a deep desperation and there should have been, and that, I\nthink two or three years of ghetto life killed that within us.",
        "Q: Did you use Karin\u2019s ration card? Did she have one even?",
        "A: Yes, she had one.",
        "Q: She had one. Did you use it?",
        "A: No, I did not. My neighbor asked whether she could pick up the bread on her card, and I said,\n\u201cNo.\u201d And I handed it into the coupon department and let it go at that. I just couldn\u2019t because\nI had read a story, and supposedly it was fiction of children looking across a barbed wire at\nthe Fehk Etta (ph) bread store and there was one across our street on the other side, and they\nlooked from the attic down into the bakery and they were talking about the bread and how\ngood it smelled, and it went on for quite awhile, and then came the deportations. And, just for\nthe deportation, the father was so hungry that he stole a piece of the children\u2019s bread. And the\nfather was deported. The mother and the two children hid and remained in the ghetto. The\nmother kept the card. She collected the father\u2019s bread. I don\u2019t know for how long. She gave it\nto the children, and she says, \u201cChildren, eat your father\u2019s bread.\u201d And that\u2019s the end of the\nstory, and the story was written by Spiegel in the ghetto. It has been translated into English.",
        "Q: And you knew this story.",
        "A: He read this story to me when he wrote the first draft.",
        "Q: And that was later?",
        "A: That was after the \u2014 it was 1943.",
        "Q: So, what was it that made you not use the coupon? Was there something immoral about it to\nyou?",
        "A: It was like robbing a grave, maybe. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know \u2014 it wasn\u2019t mine to use. It\nwasn\u2019t mine to give. It was hers. I can\u2019t give you the reason. I do not know.",
        "Q: So, she\u2019s taken away in September.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You work for Goetz ends when in October?",
        "A: No, it ended before deportation.",
        "Q: Before deportation. So, you\u2019re four to six weeks without a job before you get the job \u2014 before\nSpiegel meets you.",
        "A: No, I first go to the clothing factory in between and then I go back to Rybna,8 , and Spiegel\ngives me a job. That was pretty much the end of \u201942.",
        "Q: So, you start working there, working on these forms.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You're filling in forms.",
        "A: The coal rations for the German population.",
        "Q: And, these coal rations from the Jews-",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: How does this work?",
        "A: This is paperwork. It has nothing to do with Jews. It\u2019s like an audit at the Internal Revenue.\nHe goes over the figures. We got forms, let\u2019s say, from the city of Berlin, and Mr. Smith\nlives in an apartment with four other people. He was entitled to a hundred kilo of coal, and\nwe had to figure that out. Four times 50 or four times 25 is 100. Then there is Mr. Joe who\nhas eight people living in his apartment. Each person gets 25 kilos. So, we had to come up\nwith the figures, and there were thousands of these forms brought into the ghetto in\ncontainers, and we went through box after box doing the clerical work and having them\nshipped out of the ghetto again to Germany, so they could take the forms, give them to their\npeople, and have them collect the coal. All we did was clerical work.",
        "Q: I see. So, this had to be a fairly quick turnaround, so people could get there...",
        "A: Yes, it had to be a few months, or it was for the following year. That I cannot say.",
        "Q: So, who are you actually working for? Spiegel works for Neftalin.",
        "A: I work for Spiegel.",
        "Q: And, you work for Spiegel, and are there other people working for Spiegel, or just you?",
        "A: The office had about three or four people, one of whom was Pushovsky (ph), one was \u2014 the\nother one was Spiegel, I think there was one more man. I\u2019m not sure. But there were 300\npeople in the office.",
        "Q: In the whole office?",
        "A: In the whole office doing nothing but these forms. And while they did the forms, there were\nsupervisors, but they all directly worked for Spiegel.",
        "Q: So, what did you think of Spiegel when you first met him?",
        "A: Well, he wore glasses. He had slicked-back black hair. He walked very deliberately, very\nslowly. He always carried a briefcase. He was very absent-minded, and he was always\nwriting, in Yiddish, because I peeked and I couldn\u2019t read because he wrote very fast. He was\nalso quite sure of himself. He had published already at the age of 22 in the Yiddish Bletter in\nWarsaw. He had taught school for awhile. What did I think of him?",
        "Q: What did you notice him? Did you know that he was a published person?",
        "A: Yes, but I did not pay much attention. He was \u2014 you would call him today a little stuffy, and\nhe wore these little black horn-rimmed glasses or wire glasses \u2014 medium height, medium\nbuilt, wore a suit unpressed. The shirts were a little rumpled. I mean, it wasn\u2019t somebody\nwho would particularly strike you in a crowd, not in a ghetto.",
        "Q: So, does he begin when you first start working there, to come over to you and ask you read or\nhe\u2019s going to read to you? How \u2014 because you begin a relationship together, how does it\nbegin for you?",
        "A: He asked me to stay after work, and work ended at eight or nine.",
        "Q: Eight-oh-nine?",
        "A: Eight or nine at night.",
        "Q: Sorry.",
        "A: And the janitor whose name was Betczak was a little bit retarded but very sweet, would\nsweep the office.",
        "Q: One second that noise is really \u2014 close the door.\n[Break in tape]",
        "Q: Lucille, I\u2019m really sorry, there was an awful lot of noise outside. You won\u2019t be interrupted\nagain. So, you were starting to talk about how you began to have a closer relationship with\nSpiegel and you\u2019re talking about the janitor, Betchak?",
        "A: Betezak like a bed, Betczak. And, he would come and sweep around the offices and he would\nsit there at ten at night or whatever time it was, and Spiegel would read his drafts on which\nhe worked most of the daytime although he wasn\u2019t supposed to, and \u2014 in Yiddish \u2014 and he\ntold me what to think about them, whether they were good or not so good. And I listened,\nand some of his poetry is very beautiful. And the short stories really took me very much by\nsurprised. They were fiction, but they were the story of the man who lost his horse to hunger,\nor the Germans killed an animal, or the father who stole bread from the children. He wrote a\nbook during the ghetto time that was called \u201cMalches Ghetto\u201d \u2014 \u201cKingdom Ghetto\u201d, and it\ngives a story of the church on the Platske Chernya (ph), and the people who go in and who go\nout. He had a facility to describe people, and the description ran several pages. It reminded\nme of Thomas Mann and the Buddenbrooks. It gave the background of the story, the smell,\nthe atmosphere, the air, the grass, the sky. It \u2014 to me at age 17, 1t was very impressive.",
        "Q: Why did he have to tell you what to think?",
        "A: Because I was very young and really didn\u2019t know very much. And we sat until very late in\nthe office and when the janitor finally had to lock up, he walked me back to Pawia, 26, and\nthat became a habit, a custom. It was noticed in the office. It was talked about in the office.\nSome people made fun of it because the age difference was tremendous.",
        "Q: And how different was it?",
        "A: It was 20 or 22 years, and I found it very awkward. I really didn\u2019t know how I felt about him.\nI admired him as a writer, or I liked his stories. I did not even know whether you could say a\nwriter. I did not think that the stories would survive the war or we would survive the war, and\nthen he began writing short poems, and I think there are eight or nine of them, and they were\nwritten to me. They were published after the war, and that\u2019s when he said, \u201cIf your mother\nwere alive, I would ask her to marry you.\u201d He told me that he had a daughter, Eva, who died\nin the ghetto at not even a year old, and that\u2019s when I found out that he had a wife. He was\nseparated from her. I saw once or twice. Somebody pointed her out. He had a couple of\nsisters, several brothers, and very, very old parents. They probably weren\u2019t as old as they\nlooked old. The father could read and write Yiddish. The mother took in laundry for people\nbefore the war. She washed the laundry. She hung it up on the roof, and he had to sit on the\nroof to watch that the laundry wouldn\u2019t be stolen. The poverty in which he grew up was\nincredible. I had never heard of such poverty, and I believe that the apartment \u2014 and I was\nthere twice \u2014 in which his parents lived, and the apartment which he shared during their time\nwas theirs before the war. It was tiny. It was dark. There was hardly any furniture. It was the\nkind of poverty that you read about, but you never see it. By Spring or Summer in 43, I was\ntaken to the common law police, severely beaten, and when I came back to the office,\nnobody said much, but I found out that I had been denounced for having a radio. The\nGermans who beat me up told me that a woman had denounced me, and eventually being a\nghetto and being a very small area, it became known that she had given my name to the\ncommon law police.",
        "Q: It was his wife?",
        "A: His separated wife. We never spoke about it.",
        "Q: You never told him.",
        "A: He saw it. You couldn\u2019t escape it. My left side \u2014 the whole left side of my face was for weeks\na mess, but we never spoke about it. He kept bringing me back to Pawia, 26. He read me\nstories. He wrote more stories. And the following week he wrote a poem and he wrapped in\nan orange roll with a ribbon tied around, and the poem started \u201cThe eyes are green.\u201d The\npoem has been published in Israel and in Poland, and in one other book is a whole section\nand it says, \u201cFor Cilla.\u201d This friendship, I wouldn\u2019t call it a love affair. It was in between the\ntwo. On one hand, he was selfish. He got from Neftalin two weeks\u2019 leave to work in the\nbakery, which meant he could eat as much bread as he could absorb, but it also meant that his\nbread ration was not needed by him during the two weeks. I\u2019m sure it went to his family, but\nhe never offered me a slice. It hurt. Then I moved to Lutomierska, and it was then that he told\nme that he had written a poem \u201cRaisins and Almonds\u201d. The poem was set to music by\nBeigelmann (ph). It was performed in the ghetto at night, clandestine in a basement.\nRumkowski read about it because it says in one of the voices that \u201cWe are so hungry we have\nnothing to eat. What should the poor child do?\u201d Rumkowski took offense, and he threatened\ndeportation, and he said, \u201cAs long as I am here, you will write no more.\u201d Neftalin intervened\nwith the understanding and the promise that there would be no references to Rumkowski in\nanything and there weren\u2019t from that point forward. He hated the man with vengeance, and\nhe always said, \u201cIf you ever get to know him, be careful.\u201d I don\u2019t know how to translate it,\nprobably the closest would be, \u201cHe is a pest,\u201d a parch in Yiddish.",
        "Q: He spoke to you in Yiddish.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So, what did he say to you in Yiddish?",
        "A: Spiegel?",
        "Q: Yes, what did is say about Rumkowski?",
        "A: \u201cRumkowski is a parch,\u201d P-A-R-C-H, I think. He would not say anymore. He told me the\nstory about the baby\u2019s song. It\u2019s a lullaby, so to speak, and around that time, Rumkowski\ncame to the office. He did see Spiegel because he sat in the main conference room, and they\ndid not look at each other. Neftalin took over, and he took a lot of people out of the office\ninto the factories, straw factory mainly, and he told me that I would hear from him. And that\nevening, Spiegel again warned me, and in a way he was angry because I had done nothing,\nbut somehow he felt it was partly my fault.",
        "Q: About the song?",
        "A: No, that Rumkowski had said I will hear from him.",
        "Q: So, he saw that scene?",
        "A: He saw that scene. And Fuchs didn\u2019t say anything. He was present, Bernard Fuchs, and then\nNeftalin transferred me to the Statistical Department, and Spiegel picked me up every\nevening. He went over the bridge, picked me up, went back over the bridge to Lutomierska,\nwent back over to the bridge to his parents\u2019 house.",
        "Q: But, in this period, you\u2019re working there from October \u201942 until the end of \u201943. Is that right?",
        "A: No, I would say the middle of \u00b043.",
        "Q: Okay. So, it\u2019s a number of months.",
        "A: Yes, six months, seven months.",
        "Q: Now, is there \u2014 Soon after he starts walking you home, does he take your hand and hold your\nhand?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And, is this...",
        "A: And, there was on Pawia, 26 \u2014 and that\u2019s in a book, 1n a poem \u2014 there was a covered well,\nand the well was covered with a wooden lid, quite large, and we would stand on that lid with\nour gloves on and our scarves and our hats and we would kiss, and there is a story of \u201cDer\nTot Brunnen\u2019\u2019, \u201cThe Dead Well\u201d, because the well was no longer active. My feelings were\nstrange, I could not decide. He would say odd things. After the war, you would be married to\na famous man. He was very sure of himself.",
        "Q: Meaning himself?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: He was very sure of himself, very much in love, and yet very frightening, and it told me not\nto worry about the divorce. Now, a divorce could only be granted by Rumkowski, and that\nwas not in the picture. I know what my mother would have said.",
        "Q: There\u2019s a growl from the world. How bad is that?\n[Break in tape]",
        "Q: Okay, well, we\u2019re finally back after this long break, and I believe where we ended was you\nwere going to \u2014 somebody\u2019s whistling \u2014 1s this all right? \u2014 what your mother would have\nthought had she been alive and you told her that Spiegel wanted to marry you.",
        "A: I think she would have told me that I had lost my mind, that he had lost his mind, and she\nprobably would have locked me up and thrown the key away.",
        "Q: And why? Because of you or because of him?",
        "A: That I even dared to get involved, which was my fault, and because he was in no way\nsuitable, not age-wise, not professionally, not \u2014 she would have considered him a man\nwithout a conscience, because he wasn\u2019t divorced.",
        "Q: And were these things you thought about at the time?",
        "A: Mm-hmm.",
        "Q: So, you were very-",
        "A: I was brought up very proper.",
        "Q: So, if that was the case, what in your mind was going on when you spent evening after\nevening with him and you knew that he was in some way falling in love with you, I suspect,\nno?",
        "A: Well, it was the loneliness of being alone. It was a feeling of having somebody care for you,\nbut on the other hand, I didn\u2019t talk much. I listened. I didn\u2019t talk because there is a poem and\nit starts, \u201cWer Stricts der ausoy forbissen\u201d (ph). \u201cWhy are you so stubbornly silent?\u201d Because\nI was very insecure. I was not comfortable. In some way, yes. In some ways, no.",
        "Q: Did he ever ask you a question? Or was he always talking at you?",
        "A: He was talking at me \u2014 very few questions. He wanted to know about the parents. He wanted\nto know about the home. But they were almost scientific questions. They were not\nparticularly personal or informative or desiring to know.",
        "Q: Is it the case that at some point he said that he wanted to live with you if you couldn\u2019t get\nmarried?",
        "A: Yes, he did say that, and I said I would not consider that, especially not in the ghetto, where\nall these various affairs were public knowledge. I was brought up too strict and too proper to\nhave thrown all caution to the wind. If I had known then of the duration of the ghetto, of\nAuschwitz, of Neuengamme, or Bergen-Belsen, I might have said, \u201cWhy not?\u201d But I didn\u2019t\nknow then.",
        "Q: Was he your first boyfriend, in some way\u201d?",
        "A: Yes, first love.",
        "Q: And you do consider him a first love?",
        "A: Yes, because I cared. It was not \u2014 it was not like being madly in love. It was more like being\nloved by somebody who cared, but not having to be alone.",
        "Q: But you were a very innocent young woman?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you nevertheless see that there were a lot of affairs going on \u2014 that people were\ncoupling?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you think of that as being a kind of desperation, that people thought they might die?",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t out of desperation. It was \u2014 it was like in any society where people live in close\nproximity that these connections are made. The director of the corset factory and another\nfactory, they had a m\u00e9nage-a-trois, and it was common knowledge in the ghetto. They lived\nin one room, in one bed, everybody laughed. It wasn\u2019t funny. It was actually sad. Dora Fuchs\nwas madly in love with the Auday Yakobovitch (ph). Yakobovitch was married. There are\nhundreds of these stories. Some were true love stories. Some survived the war and lasted\nlong beyond the war, and some broke up with the end of the war.",
        "Q: Were women \u2014 if you knew this at the time and maybe you can only know this on reflection\n\u2014 were women in some sense in a more vulnerable position because more men had jobs and\nmore men were in a position to give women things?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: No. It varied from case to case. It depended on the individual. If a man was in a powerful\nposition, yes. He had the power and the clout to demand, but so did the women in powerful\npositions. It worked both ways. They\u2019d pick the man that they wanted.",
        "Q: And there were a lot of women in power, as far as you know?",
        "A: As far as I know, in the ghetto for the first time, women were not only nurses or teacher or\nhomemakers, there was a woman a year older than I who ran the mattress factory, and she\nhad her pick of the crop, as you would say. There was Dora Fuchs, for instance. There was\nVal Kovner (ph). There were many, many, and these women were very capable. They were\npowerful. They were very smart, very intelligent, but very tough, very tough.",
        "Q: And you knew all this when you were there?",
        "A: I learned all this-",
        "Q: Later?",
        "A: Slowly.",
        "Q: Slowly.",
        "A: Slowly, \u201942 \u2014\u201943 \u2014 44.",
        "Q: Was this shocking to you?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: Because I had no idea. I had a read some translated French literature that was risque, but I\nreally did not know what to make of it. If the director of the evening kitchen had an affair\nwith a police \u2014 with a Jewish police, kept in only on the dining table in the kitchen, and it\nwas common knowledge in plain view, it was shocking beyond words.",
        "Q: Did you ever see anything that was shocking to you in that regard?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So, you saw things \u2014 people actually coupling in public places.",
        "A: Yes, yes, public places. There was a woman in charge of the recovery home where you\nwould be sent for two weeks if you were a deserving worker, but you had to be of fairly high\nrank, and it was out in Marysin, and Spiegel were walking, and she came over. She was twice\nmy age, maybe more, and she made an open proposition.",
        "Q: To him?",
        "A: Yes, while I stood there like the fool that I was, and he said, \u201cLet us stand here. You can\ncome back later,\u201d but he didn\u2019t. So, all this was very shocking.",
        "Q: I could imagine.",
        "A: And then towards the end, after the evening kitchen, Spiegel just stopped picking me up. I\nasked him why. He didn\u2019t answer. He might have gone back to his wife. He might have\nstayed with his parents, but we never spoke again. In January \u201944, I was on a deportation list,\nand my friend Elie went to him to get me off the list. He went to talk Podlowski (ph), who\nhad influence, and my name was deleted, but I never saw not until 1963, when he picked us\nup at the airplane.",
        "Q: You and your husband?",
        "A: And my two children.",
        "Q: And your two children.",
        "A: In Tel Aviv.",
        "Q: So, when Neftalin sends you to Oskar Singer, you still see Spiegel throughout that whole...",
        "A: He picks me up every evening.",
        "Q: So, tell me about working \u2014 where you glad to go?",
        "A: No, I was heartbroken.",
        "Q: You wanted to stay in that office?",
        "A: Yes. I have no interest in statistics. I had no interest \u2014 I had no knowledge even that this\noffice was of any importance or prestige. I did not particularly wanted to work for a Czech. It\nwas a very stuffy office with very few employees and everybody was at least 50 or 45. I was\nmiserable, but it was not something that I could question or refuse. It would have been\ndangerous.",
        "Q: And why would you have thought that Neftalin sent you there in order to get you away from\nRumkowski, since Rumkowski could go anywhere?",
        "A: He might have also wanted to get me away from Spiegel. He might have. I will never know\nbecause he was killed in Auschwitz. I would have asked him. I don\u2019t know, because he knew\nhis former wife.",
        "Q: I see. So, that\u2019s quite possible.",
        "A: It is possible. I will never know. It could be one of two reasons.",
        "Q: What kind of a person was Singer? Did you get to know him?",
        "A: Yes. Singer spent his day mainly on the street, or away from the office seeing people who\nhad some knowledge, who had some influenced, who had important jobs. I would pick up at\nthe bottom of the bridge in the police station from Sergeant Margolis the daily statistics \u2014 so\nmany people died, so many people committed suicide, so many were deported. When Singer\ncame back into the office, he would write or have us take notes and eventually, he produced a\ntremendous amount of material, because the chronicle of the large ghetto 1s not all Singer\u2019s. I\nthink several hundred pages at least, and that\u2019s a forthcoming book now. He was a journalist.\nHe had worked as a journalist in Prague. He had a tremendous insight, and normally, I was\nable to understand his writing except for one two-page \u2014 I couldn\u2019t even call it a report. It\nwas more like a love letter to Rumkowski. If you want to read the German version, I can get\nit for you. It\u2019s available in Lodz and at the University in Giessen. It does not fit his\npersonality. It does not fit his other reports. It does not fit the man because he very well knew\nand realized that, on some level, Rumkowski was collaborating. He followed orders. Whether\nhe followed orders because he really believed it would buy us life or time, or whether he\ndidn\u2019t have the courage to do anything else, because he made it very clear any kind of\nresistance would not be appreciated is a mild word, would not be tolerated. So, this last entry\nto Rumkowski could have only meant that he took it there and got some sort of a reward,\nwhich meant additional food, a loaf of bread, whatever. His daughter was my age and I met\nher through him, and his son was two or three years older, and he cultivated the girls whose\nfather belonged to the police and to other important ghetto institutions. He worked in the\nbakery as an electrician. Strangely enough, Dr. Singer, a very educated man and so was his\nwife, did not send either one of his kids to college, and he could have because Prague was not\nGermany. Whether they would not have been college material, I really cannot judge. But\nboth had trades. The daughter was a seamstress and the son an electrician. The wife came\nfrom a German-speaking family in Prague, a very bright, very nice woman. His sister was in\nthe ghetto. Her husband had been arrested after Prague was occupied, and one did not know\nhis whereabouts, and she had a longstanding, ongoing connection with the director of the\nelectrical component factory. And then there were two elderly ladies living in the same\nhousehold. They had almost a small apartment on Zgierska Street. It was very clean and\nwhen I could not keep my bread for eight or nine days, I\u2019d give it to my friend, and she\nwould bring me a portion to work everyday. So, I trusted her with my bread. What else can I\nsay of the Singer? The two old ladies, especially one of them, was his landlady Roztoky, near\nPrague. No children, very wealthy. I think the husband died or was killed \u2014 or he died in the\nghetto. In the ghetto, these two ladies made out a last will and testament in favor of Dr.\nSinger. I was, about six years ago, at Sonoma State University, and the director of Holocaust\nStudies is John Steiner. John is only very partly Jewish, but he made it through Auschwitz in\nspite of the fact that he never knew he was a Jew. It turns out that one of the ladies living\nwith Dr. Singer was his aunt. He knew Dr. Singer before the war, and his daughter was his\ngirlfriend. So, I told him the story about the will, and he\u2019s now \u2014 I mean, the will was lost in\nAuschwitz \u2014 he\u2019s trying to regain the house near park, and there was also a bank account by\nthe same aunt in Switzerland, but the name and the numbers have never appeared. So, after\n50 years, to come across this little old lady again 1s very strange. I found it in a way strange\nonly it was resourceful that Dr. Singer asked the two ladies to make out their last will. On\nsome level, he must have thought that he would survive the war, because otherwise, why\nwould you do it? His son had, at times, a radio. It was in poor shape, it needed constant\nrepair. We only got the BBC and the progress of the war \u2014 nothing about Warsaw, nothing\nabout our ghetto, nothing about Auschwitz, no idea. No mention was ever made by Dr.\nSinger of a place like Auschwitz, like Bergen-Belsen. No mention was made by Neftalin, by\nSpiegel. It just was not mentioned. So, it can be assumed that we really didn\u2019t know. Maybe\nsomebody knew, but I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: And nobody mentioned Hamburg?",
        "A: No, that you saw from the letter which I got in \u201947 where it stated they were killed in\nAuschwitz, and it turned out they were killed in Hamburg. So, that is much later information.\nThe work for Dr. Singer was effortless. It was boring. It was dull. I was a clerk. It was a\nlarge, dark office, and it was terribly lonely, whereas the previous office had people. Until\none day when I got a phone call, would I please appear in police headquarters outside the\nBalutski Renneck (ph), and there was Rumkowsk1i, and he told me that I would work in the\nevening kitchen together with 40 other young women my age who had been for six months in\nthe women\u2019s police corps, and they wore uniforms just like the men. They were mostly\nyoung women who had finished matura (ph) either before they ghetto or in the ghetto in 40,\nand they strutted around the ghetto in their police uniforms, gray with an orange band, and it\nwas a police corps that lasted probably eight months.",
        "Q: In 1943?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I\u2019m looking surprised.",
        "A: Yes, I\u2019m surprised that you\u2019re surprised. I thought it was common knowledge.",
        "Q: Well, maybe for some, but has not been for me.",
        "A: Well, there are some of these women still alive.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah, and all of these went to work in the Kuechenuhr kueletini (ph) evening kitchen, which\nwas used for a two-week period for deserving workers on a coupon which gave them an\nevening meal, a little vegetables, sometimes a little starch, and something that looked like a\nhamburger, but it was round. What it contained, I really couldn\u2019t say. I ripped mine up and I\ngave it to Spiegel when he picked me up. Rumkowski knew about Spiegel and he threatened.",
        "Q: Threatened you or threatened Spiegel?",
        "A: Threatened me for seeing him. He told me that he knew. Who had carried the information, I\ndon\u2019t know, but it was common in the ghetto to trade information, to talk to the\nadministration about anything or to denounce people, to no particular gain other than maybe\nyou got a little reward for it, but just to carry gossip. The young policewomen were all\nwaitresses.",
        "Q: Let me stop you for a minute. Is this the time when Spiegel stops seeing you?",
        "A: No, that was before \u2014 after that, he stopped seeing me.",
        "Q: After he stopped seeing you?",
        "A: End of \u201943.",
        "Q: So, perhaps he stopped because he was frightened, or you didn\u2019t tell him?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t tell him.",
        "Q: Is it possible that Rumkowski went to Spiegel and said, \u201cStop\u2019\u2019\u201d?",
        "A: Anything is possible. I doubt it, but it is possible.",
        "Q: And, how did you \u2014 that\u2019s a question you can\u2019t answer. All of these women who were in the\nwomen\u2019s police who came in and you\u2019re the only one who\u2019s in another \u2014 was in another job?",
        "A: I was in the office.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: If we received 50 kilo of carrots, and we had to serve 400 meals, how much did each person\nget in terms of weight? So many grams, and I had a little trouble with the arithmetic. They\nkitchen was run by a man of the name of Minsk. He was sort of grandfatherly and kind, and\nhe ran the kitchen. He was the \u2014 there were four of them. He ran this particular one, and he\nbrought in a young man who helped me with the figuring. I couldn\u2019t manage it. I could\nmanage it now. But in the afternoons, he was ordered to leave because this was done\nclandestine. Rumkowski did not know, or if he knew, he did not let on, but I was a clerk for\nthat kitchen.",
        "Q: All right, I want to go back to being in Singer\u2019s office for a minute. Did you learn anything? I\nunderstand it was boring, but you didn\u2019t have colleagues on a regular basis.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: But did you learn things about the ghetto from being in that office that you would not have\nknown otherwise or that you did not know before about how things were operating?",
        "A: Yes. You found out if a factory changed management. You found if somebody was replaced\nby somebody else. You found out if people were in the ghetto yesterday. You heard a rumor,\ntrue or untrue, that Biebow tried to rape Dora Fuchs. You heard \u2014 you heard all sorts of\nrumors in that office, some of which you didn\u2019t dare put down on paper because there was\nalways the chance of censorship by the Germans, and censorship by the Jews. There were\nsometimes stories about food rations to be and they never materialized or vice versa. The\ninformation was accurate to the extent that you couldn\u2019t substantiate very much. I mean, even\nwhen I picked up the daily statistics, so many died in the hospital, so many jumped out of a\nwindow, of course, no births \u2014 there were hardly any births, even these statistics they were\nkept, but the question arises how accurate where they. There were quite a few suicides\nespecially from \u2014 committed by people coming from the west \u2014 some were doctors, some\nwere lawyers, and they must have brought something along to make suicide possible. There\nwas a rumor that the ghetto had some doctors. There was a lady by the name of Kronan\nBurke (ph). There was Dr. Miller, who was Rumkowski\u2019s favorite doctor, but no medication.\nThere was a lady dentist who operated a drill with a foot pedal, like an old fashioned sewing\nmachine, and you heard about them. You heard, for instance, that 1f you were jaundiced or if\nyou had hepatitis, atropine would help, an injection of atropine. Whether this is true today, I\ndo not know. Atropine could be somehow smuggled into the ghetto if you knew a German of\nthe guard. These things you heard in the office, but you could never vouch for honesty or\ncredibility.",
        "Q: And did Singer write down more than ever went into the Chronicle? He had many more \u2014\nbecause I\u2019m sure when he went out to talk with the people, he must have taken down notes.",
        "A: He took very brief notes, but then-",
        "Q: He would write...",
        "A: Then it got... They\u2019re all typewritten on an old-fashioned manual typewriter. They have\nsome errors. All of his entries will be out in January in German, and if you\u2019d like it, [ll get it\nfor you. His counterpart was Oskar Rosenfeld, also from Prague, and his \u2014 he had not nearly\nas many entries. He was much older. He had a very young wife in England and he was very\ngrandfatherly, very sweet, very kind \u2014 a totally different style because when I was at the\nJustice Liebzig University, they gave me a stack of these reportages and they asked me to\nidentify them and said, \u201cHere is Singer\u2019s.\u201d\u201d And I went through them. I said, \u201c\u2018No, this is not\nSinger. This is Oskar Rosenfeld.\u201d And it was correct \u2014 totally different style. I didn\u2019t know\nhim as well as Singer because he worked in the office, but I didn\u2019t work for him. His book\nsupposedly was just published in English by Hanna Levy, either Frankfurt at the Bauer\nInstitute in Frankfurt, or it came out in Berlin. I\u2019m not sure which. And Hanna Levy did the\nediting and it supposedly came out in English. I have not seen it. And I\u2019m not as familiar\nwith his entries.",
        "Q: So, you didn\u2019t type these reports?",
        "A: Some I did type wherever there was a typewriter available, but there was only one and I was\nnot the only one who had access to it.",
        "Q: So, when you say you were clerking, what would that mean?",
        "A: I would transcribe some of Singer\u2019s notes in longhand. I would file things. I would give him\nthe daily statistics. I would do very menial work \u2014 nothing of any consequence or substance,\nbut I did read what he wrote because it was an interesting style.",
        "Q: So, you weren\u2019t completely, given the kind of job you were doing, you were not completely\nunhappy going to the kitchen.",
        "A: No, because it meant an extra meal. It was from five to seven in the evening. People lined up\nand had a coupon, and, well, Rumkowski came almost every evening, and the apron of the\nwaitress, if the bow in the back was not straight, he would hit her with a cane. He carried a\ncane. He threatened a couple of them with dismissal. In the front sat two ladies who clipped\nthe coupon which had to be counted every morning \u2014 two ladies? Two young women. The\ncooking was done by a couple of lady chefs.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s hold here. We have to change the tape.\nEnd of Tape 4\nTape 5",
        "Q: Lucille, we\u2019ll talking about the kitchen, and you were mentioning, before we were talking\nabout the actual cooking, there were people at the \u2014 women at the door clipping coupons.\nWhere did people get the coupons?",
        "A: You got them in the factory, you got them in an office, if your boss decided that you\ndeserved a bonus. And of course it was \u2014 there were never enough coupons to go around the\nghetto, but it was an incentive or a gift for some of them. There was a lot of favoritism\ninvolved as to who got them. If you were well connected, you could be sure to get the\ncoupon. It was \u2014 it was an original idea to reward a worker because it was said the straw shoe\nfactory rewarded 12 workers, not bosses, but 12 workers, or the uniform factory rewarded 10\nworkers. It was supposed to be an incentive to work hard, to try to top the quota, and in the\nend to please the Germans.",
        "Q: One dinner for one coupon?",
        "A: Yes, one dinner for one coupon, but you got a week at a time. You could come for seven\ndays. So, you got seven coupons. It was one coupon and you cut off seven strips. At one\npoint, they tried to do it for two weeks, and then somebody else got a turn. How it was\ndecided, administered, as to who got them, or which factory \u2014 that was done behind closed\ndoors, I do not know, but there was a lot of protection involved.",
        "Q: And your job was figuring out the mathematics of we have this much food and how much for\neach person?",
        "A: Well, we had this much food for the week, divide that by seven, and then divide by the\nnumber of clients or the number of diners who would come, and how much each person\nwould consume in grams. For instance, it would be 50 grams of meat which equals about an\nounce. It would be so much red beets, but the figuring was complicated. There was no adding\nmachine. There was no calculator. I had to take a pen and pencil and you had to convert the\nkilos to pounds and the pounds to grams, and in Poland they used the word \u201cdeca\u201d which\nmeant ten grams. So, it was a little overwhelming for me. I mean, I wasn\u2019t bad at math, but I\nwasn\u2019t that good.",
        "Q: And who decided what the menu would be?",
        "A: That depended \u2014 well, the \u2014 Mr. Mintzer was in charge of the kitchen, and it depended on the\nsupply. They would \u2014 they would send \u2014 they would come on a horse-drawn truck, sort of\nlike a flatbed truck but horse-drawn, and they would either unload or sack or a crate or\nsometimes it was flour, sometimes it was carrots or beets or turnips, very rarely potatoes,\nsometimes meat, and from the looks of it, it was horsemeat because it was very dark red, and\nit was all served on one plate, in little portions, and the portions were pretty much equal,\nalmost if you would take an ice cream scoop. We were entitled the same meal an hour before\nour guests would appear with the rule that nothing was supposed to be taken out, but we did\nanyway.",
        "Q: And how many people per evening usually?",
        "A: Well, the so-called dining room was filled up. I would say probably 200.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a lot of people.",
        "A: 150-200, but not for a ghetto of 160,000 people.",
        "Q: Was there a large kitchen, or was it a very makeshift kind of thing?",
        "A: No, it was a large kitchen. It had big kettles. The cooks were ladies, and they were standing\non a platform stirring ferociously at those kettles, and we would come in and look and they\ndidn\u2019t like it, and in the back of the kitchen was a storage room, and the storage room had the\nsupply. The young woman who ran the storage room was somewhat older than we were, I\nguess, close to 30. Her name was Meyerowitz, and she carried the key to the storage room\naround her neck, and you were not allowed to go over the threshold into that storage room.\nShe would reach \u2014 she would weigh, count, whatever, and she would reach the food out, and\nI was a little friendly with her, and if I would come near the entrance she would say, \u201cStop,\nstand there and talk to me. Don\u2019t go further.\u201d Because I might touch something or take\nsomething. She was very meticulous for reasons of her own.",
        "Q: And were you also the youngest person working in the kitchen?",
        "A: No, there were two or three people younger than I. Most were older than I, but there was a\nyoung woman that \u2014 three young women who were younger than I am, but not by much.",
        "Q: Rumkowski came in every night \u2014 to eat?",
        "A: Almost every \u2014 no. No, he had decent food. I mean, if you look at his prewar picture \u2014 his\nrumpled shirt, his rumpled pants, his disheveled hair \u2014 he was a poor man. When he showed\nup in the ghetto, he was pressed and tailored, immaculate \u2014 boots, he wore boots \u2014 SS-type\nboots \u2014 shined. Lodz had very good tailors. I think the best in all of Poland. His top coats, his\njackets were out of Fifth Avenue \u2014 unbelievable, elegant.",
        "Q: So, he comes in and he\u2019s sort of a monster to people.",
        "A: Well, he comes in \u2014 he was very proud of his achievement, and I guess it was an\nachievement, but the people \u2014 the young people who worked for him were petrified of him\nbecause he would beat them and if he was displeased, he would dismiss them, and that was a\nrisk you took. A couple of girls I knew were dismissed. One of them managed through\nconnections to come back. It was a good job, but it was a risky job in some ways.",
        "Q: Were you frightened of him?",
        "A: Yes, I was. I was.",
        "Q: Were you frightened based on what you saw or what you had been hearing?",
        "A: Both.",
        "Q: Both?",
        "A: Both.",
        "Q: Now, I\u2019m a little confused about timeframe when it comes to the various conversations you\nhad with people about Rumkowski. Spiegel says things to you \u2014 that he\u2019s a pig or a pest, and\nthat one has to be careful of him. You meet other people Shlomo (ph), Branya, Luba.",
        "A: Branya I met while I worked for Spiegel. She came into the office as a courier.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Luba worked in the Statistical Department.",
        "Q: When you working with Singer?",
        "A: Right. The woman who worked at the orphanage, the teacher.",
        "Q: Dorka?",
        "A: Dorka, she lived in our building. She was an unmarried woman and she was deported\ntogether with my sister to Chelmo. Yulik (ph), I met after the war in Paris.",
        "Q: And Shlomo, when did you meet Shlomo \u2014 Shlomo Hect (ph), he has the pushcart.",
        "A: Oh, I met him at the very beginning, when I come into the ghetto in \u00b041.",
        "Q: So, right in the beginning you hear stories because he tells you-",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -about Sergei-",
        "A: Right, who was his friend.",
        "Q: -who was his friend, and was investigating Rumkowsk1.",
        "A: Shlomo before the war had a store that sold yarns and fabrics and things like that. He had\npushcart on corner Rybna and Lutomierska Street and it sold \u2014 he sold needles and thread\nand other small items. I think he was an educated man because he spoke German. He talked\nto my mother in the very beginning, and he talked to me \u2014 as long as he lived and he died\nshortly after my mother \u2014 he talked to me in bits and pieces. On the outside, on the street\ncorner, when the weather permitted. When it got very cold and I could spare the time, I\nwould drop in at his room. He had a daughter about my age, a year older, and he would talk.\nHe lived on, I think, Narutoviska (ph) Street before the war as did Sergei. Sergei was a\nbachelor until quite late, and he worked for the city council in Lodz. He was a short man. He\nwas heavyset.",
        "Q: This is Sergei?",
        "A: Yes. I met him only after the war, and he had a brother. I never met him. He perished. And\nhe was a friend of Shlomo\u2019s, and he heard the story about the complaints. He tried to\ninvestigate. The first time the accusations were thrown out for lack of evidence by the Jewish\nCouncil. The second time was just before the start of the war. Supposedly, the complaint was\nfiled. Rumkowski knew about it. Sergei escaped to Russia to \u2014 through Russia, I think he\nwent to Yugahama (ph), then to Canada, then to Los Angeles. I met him in 1975. Rumkowski\nlooked for him all through the war. He thought he was hiding in the ghetto. Sergei eventually\nwent back to school and became a social worker, but while he was working on the city\ncouncil, he worked in the Balut. He knew the thieves. He knew the thief in charge. He knew\nthe underworld, and when his silver watch was stolen, he complained and it reappeared.\nThere was a young woman in the ghetto. She also worked in the kitchen, and she once took\nme home, and I met her mother \u2014 a tall, well-dressed woman, heavyset, and the father is sort\nof small and shifty-eyed gentleman, and he asked me where I come from and what my father\ndid, and his only answer was, \u201cFeh\u201d I didn\u2019t know what to make of it. The apartment in the\nBalut had all the prewar furniture, rugs, glassware, crystal, and it turned out he had lived\nthere before the war with his family as had my co-worker from the kitchen. She was very\npretty, very blonde. I don\u2019t think she could count to five, but she was very popular. She had a\ncouple of sisters, a brother-in-law, and when I asked the father, since he had such contempt\nfor my father\u2019s work, what did he do before the war, he said, \u201cA little of this, and a little of\nthat.\u201d But the rumor in the ghetto was that he had an older daughter and the daughter was\nsold to a brothel in South America. And it was common knowledge. But he had underworld\nconnection before the war; during the war, I don\u2019t know. His children survived. What\nhappened to the daughter in South America, I do not know. He and his wife did not survive.\nHis daughter is still living.",
        "Q: How does it come that Shlomo tells you about Sergei\u2019s investigation of Rumkowski? Is it\njust because Rumkowsk1 is part of a lot of conversation?",
        "A: Yes, yes, because he used to drive by in this horse-drawn buggy. Everything was signed with\nRumkowski\u2019s name from the money, to the announcements, to everything else. He was\nenvied, envied partly for power, mainly for food. I mean, it\u2019s almost like saying, \u201cWhy was\nKennedy talked about?\u201d It was a person who wielded enormous power, and who did not live\nthe life of the average ghetto dweller. He lived a different life.",
        "Q: So, Shlomo tells you about four children or three children? He tells you about Branya.",
        "A: He mentions the four children.",
        "Q: Including Branya and Dorka.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So, you have a sense of what Rumkowski was doing in an orphanage to little children-",
        "A: Well-",
        "Q: Or not?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t have a sense. I had never heard of such a thing, and it didn\u2019t \u2014 it didn\u2019t really fall\ninto place.",
        "Q: But, he tells you he takes children into a room and undresses them.",
        "A: Yeah, or molests them.",
        "Q: Or molests them in some way.",
        "A: And \u2014 but, to me, I mean I was 16 years old.",
        "Q: So, it\u2019s just a story.",
        "A: It\u2019s just a story, and I must have found it frightening but I could not \u2014 I could not really relate\nto it.",
        "Q: When you meet Branya, who was the first person who actually experiences this and is still\nexperiencing it in the ghetto-",
        "A: Right, and she cried and she couldn\u2019t talk. She started a sentence and never finished it.",
        "Q: So, you never found out from her, as much a story as you heard from Shlomo?",
        "A: No. I found out bits and pieces. I found out that her food ration was considerably better than\nmine. She was a very - well, she gave the appearance of a very happy person, but she was\nvery, very unhappy because her family used her, and she had a miserable childhood, and she\nhad a miserable ghetto life.",
        "Q: And then Dorka, who tells you about this little child, Manya.",
        "A: The child with a violin.",
        "Q: Who he molests-",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And she runs away fearful.",
        "A: She runs away and she hits the barbed wire and gets shot, but it was never publicized. It was\nnever spoken about. Nobody dared because there were many killings along the barbed wire.\nThat was very, very common. Luba was much more outspoken. She was very worldly, very\nwise. She was an orphan from a very young age. The man with whom she lived used to run a\nfood distribution center and he was caught stealing, and he ended in prison, and she had\nRumkowski release him under the condition that he would not get a job.",
        "Q: And then she continues in some way going to Rumkowsk1.",
        "A: Yes, she got-",
        "Q: But she was in the orphanage before the war.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: So, she was molested as a child and then as adult woman she agrees to do it 1n order to\nprotect this-",
        "A: This man and to get food, and she got a beautiful apartment out near Marysin with the\npromise that she would get married and that Rumkowski would perform the ceremony, and\nshe always postponed it. She postponed it three or four times. I don\u2019t know why, whether he\ndidn\u2019t want to get married or she didn\u2019t want to get married. I never found out.",
        "Q: Did he know what she was doing? Her \u2014 the man she was living with?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I never knew him well enough to have a conversation with him. We said, \u201cHello\u201d and \u201cHow\nare you?\u201d and small talk but we never talked.",
        "Q: Now, you meet Luba in \u201943-\u00b044",
        "A: \u00b043.",
        "Q: You\u2019re a little older now. Do you now begin to understand what he\u2019s doing?",
        "A: No, what I understood is that Luba had to have an abortion. That she was living with her\nboyfriend. That I understood. I knew that Luba was really wise and very worldly and she\nplayed the game by her own rules. How much I related to it, or how much I understood, I\ndon\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You liked her?",
        "A: Yes, because she was very friendly, very boisterous, very outgoing, and very attractive, but\nnot pretty. She was short. She was plump. She managed to buy clothing from recent arrivals\nbecause she had the means to purchase. I liked her. There was \u2014 there was a charm about her.\nThere was a will to live. She could be a lot of fun. She could laugh about anything and there\nwas really not much to laugh about. But I liked her.",
        "Q: Did she work in the kitchen also?",
        "A: Yes, she clipped coupons.",
        "Q: I see. So, you and she moved into that position-",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -from the Singer job, as well.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I see. So, are you \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s unconsciously nervous about Rumkowski because he\nin some sense pointed you out to himself, \u201cI will see you again.\u201d",
        "A: Yes. It made me nervous. On the other hand, I thought maybe I will get more to eat, in an\ninnocent sort of way \u2014 maybe somebody will be kind and give me more food.",
        "Q: So, you are a still in an innocent way.",
        "A: The strings \u2014 the strings I didn\u2019t attach at that point.",
        "Q: So, then what happens?",
        "A: Well, he came into the office. One of the first proposals were that he would rent \u2014 he would\nrent! \u2014 he would get a room above the kitchen so he can come anytime, and I started to cry\nand I said, \u201cI want to stay where I am\u2019, et cetera. He got angry and he beat me with his cane.\nHe came back in subsequent weeks and months and it was a matter of molestation. The man\nwas impotent, but he did not like to know that or hear about it, and to me it was utterly\nfrightening because at one point I wasn\u2019t even quite sure how you become pregnant until\nLuba told me.",
        "Q: Did he undress you?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So, he didn\u2019t -",
        "A: It was just a matter of touching.",
        "Q: Touching him?",
        "A: Yes, and it was disgusting. The fear was tremendous. Not only the fear of the beating, but the\nfear of his power. The fear that he could decide over life and death, that he could deport, that\nhe could denounce to the Germans, that he could do just about anything. That fear was\noverwhelming. He wanted to know about my family. He wanted to know who was living in\nPalestine. He wanted to know if they were well-off. He made me promise that after the war I\nwould see to it that they would help him, both to get to Palestine and to give him money\nbecause I owed him that. And he made one remark that struck me then, it strikes me now. \u201cIf\nI can save a hundred human beings, it will have been worthwhile.\u201d I tried to figure out the \u2018it\u2019\nin the sentence. He spoke Yiddish. What would have been worthwhile? The death of so many\nothers, the collaboration, the cooperation with the Germans, a hundred human beings out of\n150,000? It \u2014 it shocked me. That and the children, \u201cGive me your children.\u201d Those remarks\nI could neither forget nor forgive.",
        "Q: When he beat you the first time, he never beat you again?",
        "A: No, he beat me several times.",
        "Q: He beat you several times?",
        "A: With a stick, over the shoulder, over the head. He was not as steady on his feet as a normal\n65 year old, mainly because he probably wore those crazy boots and it wasn\u2019t easy to walk\nwith boots up to your knees. You just know that when he was displeased he would beat\npeople. Whether those were the girls in the kitchen or anybody else, it really didn\u2019t matter. If\nyou were lucky, you flinched and you hoped there were no further consequences. But he was\nevery bit as frightening as an SS \u2014 I found out later \u2014 as an SS man in uniform.",
        "Q: He locked the door-",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -to the office when he came.",
        "A: Yes, absolutely.",
        "Q: Did you scream when he hit you?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t cry?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: I cried.",
        "Q: You cried.",
        "A: I cried. You didn\u2019t hear a sound.",
        "Q: Did he beat you more when you cried?",
        "A: No, he just \u2014 he vented his anger or his frustration, and if I cried, so I cried. That didn\u2019t\nbother him.",
        "Q: Did he try to kiss you?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And he kissed you?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yes. Do you have any idea why, when you refused, he said, \u201cYou can\u2019t refuse.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t\nhave said, \u201cYou can\u2019t refuse me. I\u2019m going to move you into an apartment.\u201d Because he\nclearly had the power to do so.",
        "A: He had the power to do so. My crying probably stalled for time, or gave me time, and the\ntime was the food ran out and the kitchen had to be closed, and everybody in that kitchen was\ntransferred to the leather factory, to the Saddlery. So-",
        "Q: So, you don\u2019t know what he would have done?",
        "A: No, but there was one woman about ten years older than I who took him up on the offer of a\nroom on the other side of the kitchen, but she didn\u2019t care. She was only stupid enough not to\ncover the windows, and she was dumb enough to talk. But she was much older \u2014 much, much\nolder, at least ten years older.",
        "Q: So, clearly this was happening with a number of women-",
        "A: Right",
        "Q: -in that kitchen.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: You were not the only one pointed out.",
        "A: Yes, he also went into the storeroom where the provisions were kept and the door was\nlocked. That\u2019s all I know.",
        "Q: So, how long were you working in this kitchen.",
        "A: I think it lasted about three months, four months.",
        "Q: And how often did he try to come and see you?",
        "A: Every other day, at least.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah, because it was his accomplishment, his pride and joy, his \u2014 his child, I mean, this\nbrainstorm of having a kitchen for deserving workers. I mean, what else could he give them?\nMoney didn\u2019t mean a thing. The only thing that meant anything was food. So, he came just to\nmake sure that everything was running properly, because there was a lot of theft, there was a\nlot of corruption, there was a lot of dishonesty, and we all knew. It was unavoidable. It was\nunderstandable. So, for at least three months, he came at least every other day. You never\nknew when he would come. You could hear the horse\u2019s hooves outside, the clicking, and\nthen, who else had a horse? And, then in the hallway, you could hear his footsteps because he\nwalked very unevenly and very noisily.",
        "Q: Approximately how many times did he come to see you in particular? Do you remember how\nmany? A few times a week, once a week?",
        "A: Oh, it would be at least two or three times a week, at least twice a week.",
        "Q: Did you talk to Luba about this?",
        "A: No. She had an idea because she was much smarter than I was, and I did ask her about\npregnancy, and she laughed. She laughed so hard, and she said, \u201cDon\u2019t you know how you\nget pregnant?\u201d And I really didn\u2019t know, and \u2014 but, that really didn\u2019t change anything. I went\nonce to see Dr. Kronenburg, and she looked at me as if I was a little bit out of my mind, but\nshe was kind, and she said, \u201cGo back; don\u2019t worry.\u201d",
        "Q: So, did you explain to the doctor what was happening?",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: And she said you don\u2019t have to worry about pregnancy.",
        "A: Don\u2019t have to worry, she said, \u201cBesides, you\u2019re not menstruating. Why are you worrying?\u201d\nAnd I said, \u201cWhat does that have to do with it?\u201d It was very complicated.",
        "Q: Did you menstruate at all during the ghetto?",
        "A: Nobody did.",
        "Q: Nobody did?",
        "A: Nobody did, lack of food.",
        "Q: Had you menstruated before?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Of course, and you just stopped.",
        "A: It just stopped.",
        "Q: Was she, the doctor, shocked at what you told her about what Rumkowski was doing?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think she was shocked. She was an older woman who probably had children my age.\nShe was well-known. She was an MD. She was not a felczer, because the ghetto had a lot of\ndoctors that were \u2014 like, what should I say \u2014 first-aid man, or medical corpsman and they\nwere called a felczer, from falsifying the word comes, but they were called doctors because\nthere was a scarcity of doctors and hospitals otherwise, and she was too smart and too\nintelligent and probably slightly amused. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Amused?",
        "A: Yes, that I would be so stupid, and she said, \u201cIt\u2019s all right, child, go home.\u201d",
        "Q: So, she didn\u2019t ask you anything about what this was doing to you or what-",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: - because this was not relevant?",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t relevant. You \u2014 the ghetto did not have time, compassion, or patience for\nanyone\u2019s mental well-being. That did not exist, and didn\u2019t exist during most of the war. It\ndidn\u2019t even exist in 1946 in New York. So, this is human nature. You just shrug, and you\nfigure it out by yourself.",
        "Q: And, even Luba laughed because of your thinking that you could pregnant from this.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did she say anything else to you about?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: About Rumkowski?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So, you didn\u2019t talk-",
        "A: She told me that she had known him since childhood, since the orphanage, but their\nrelationship, their talk was so relaxed and so easy, it wasn\u2019t on the basis of \u201cSir.\u201d It was on\nthe basis of \u201cyou\u201d, and you don\u2019t call the president \u201cyou;\u201d you call him \u201cMr. President.\u201d\nEven in Polish. So, it was fairly obvious that there was a connection, somehow, somewhere.",
        "Q: Did she in some sense after all these years, gain some power, now that she was a woman and\nnot a girl, with him?",
        "A: Well, the power she gained was the additional food, the apartment, those were the obvious\ngains. She managed all sorts of strange things. She lived in a small room, a small apartment,\nand it was cold and you couldn\u2019t heat it, but you could get the element, which is the spiral\nthat fits into a heater, for instance, and she strung it across the room from right to left, but\nyou couldn\u2019t hook it up to meter because the Germans would have known. So, she got in an\nelectrician to hook it up above the meter, so it would not show the numbers on the individual\nroom meters. I mean, she knew things that nobody knew. She knew how to survive.",
        "Q: Actually, what I meant was that in some way she had a certain kind of power with\nRumkowski.",
        "A: She didn\u2019t use it.",
        "Q: She didn\u2019t use it?",
        "A: No, on the contrary, she was very relaxed and she was very sweet, very smiley.",
        "Q: To him?",
        "A: Yeah, very outgoing, jovial, joking, because in the end, she got a reward.",
        "Q: So, when this is happening, that he\u2019s forcing you in essence to masturbate him.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Where are you in your head? Do you go somewhere? Do you leave?",
        "A: Fear.",
        "Q: You\u2019re in fear.",
        "A: Fear, just fear, cold fear.",
        "Q: And it\u2019s the same thing each time.",
        "A: Over and over.",
        "Q: And it only stops because the kitchen 1s closed.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You think?",
        "A: Yes. Maybe he would have found another toy, but the kitchen closed on Monday and on\nTuesday we were working in the Saddlery, all of us.",
        "Q: Was that hard work?",
        "A: Yes, it was sewing the metal frames that go around a shovel that a soldier carries on his belt\nto dig a trench, and those were sewn on a goat or a causa (ph), as you say in a Yiddish. That\nmeans you sit on a bench and in front of you is like a head with a vice, with a wooden vice,\nand you put the leather into \u2014 the two pieces of leather into the wooden vice, you have an awl\nto punch the whole, and then you have a long string with two needles, one right, one left \u2014\nand you sew a double stitch like this, and it was piecework. I mean, they counted it, and once\nin a while, there were ten strips to a unit. Once in awhile, we were a strip short, and then you\nhad to go to the foreman, who was a young man our age and you had to do a lot of explaining\nand a lot of excusing, and then you would get another strip, but they were counted out\ncarefully because the Germans had shipped them carefully. The reason my strips disappeared\nis I stole them. I stole six strips because my shoes had no soles, and I put them in the top of\nmy boots, and I walked through the inspection; it was like at the airport. They would tap you\nfrom neck to the bottom. Occasionally you had to undress, and I only told about it after I had\nall six out. Nobody knew, and people thought I must have lost my mind, but I had no soles\nfor the winter.",
        "Q: And, then you get somebody to fix them.",
        "A: I got a shoemaker to sole the shoes, and the reason he didn\u2019t talk is because he could keep\nhalf of the strips, and he could sell them for bread. I think it\u2019s about the only time I stole.\nThat\u2019s why I never bought a pair of boots, never.",
        "Q: And you didn\u2019t buy a pair of boots because \u2014 weren\u2019t these boots something that were made\nfor you.",
        "A: The boots came from an old hatbox that my mother had, and when I had them made, I gave\nhalf the hatbox to the shoemaker. And in Poland, there are two shoemakers; one who makes\nthe uppers and one who makes the bottom. One makes the uppers are the kupita (ph), and the\nbottom is the shaftsa (ph), and it\u2019s two procedures. It\u2019s like a designer, designing the upper\npart, and then putting the sole on it. And the reason I got them made was that I left them have\nthe box, half the hatbox because it had a top and a bottom. The side were sort of stiff, and \u2014\nbut they only lasted one winter or maybe a winter and a half and I came through the soles,\nand I had frostbite, and they were pull up boots in sort of a nice brown leather, but much too\nsoft for shoes. They were for a hatbox, not for shoes. But I had enough room below the knee\nto get a thin item into it like a strip of leather, and those I stole.",
        "Q: So, why is that you\u2019ve never bought a pair of boots since then?",
        "A: Because I remember those boots.",
        "Q: And never wanted another pair of boots?",
        "A: No. I couldn\u2019t, because my mother used the box for hats before the war. I never bought a pair\nof boots.",
        "Q: It\u2019s good you lived in California.",
        "A: Probably, but in California there were boots. It\u2019s fashionable.",
        "Q: That\u2019s true. So, did these \u2014 when they fixed the boots, it was okay?",
        "A: Yes, but the frostbite remained. I saved the toes, but barely. And once in awhile, they lose all\ncirculation and they turn greenish-blue. But I kept them. I mean, I didn\u2019t lose any toes. They\nthawed out.",
        "Q: And how long were you working in the leather factory?",
        "A: Until deportation out of the ghetto in fall of \u201944.",
        "Q: And you get there a few months before. You worked there a few months or longer?",
        "A: Yes, I worked there a few months.",
        "Q: And, Rumkowski doesn\u2019t follow you?",
        "A: No, never \u2014 never saw him again.",
        "Q: And, do you ever talk to anyone else before you leave the ghetto?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Does it in some way leave your mind or does it wear on you?",
        "A: Nothing. If you went through the war, nothing leaves your mind. It\u2019s filed away under Z or\nY. You don\u2019t think of it every minute or every day, but once in awhile, something comes\nback. I was at the airport in Munich in September, and it was of course after New York, and\nthere the Germans stood in their uniforms and their black boots, and one of them started\nyelling, \u201cYou can\u2019t use this door. Use that door.\u201d And normally I don\u2019t understand German, I\njust understand English, and it brought back, \u201cWhat are you, Gestapo?\u201d I just \u2014 it just came\nback. I didn\u2019t do it on purpose. There are flashbacks when I\u2019m under stress, but not\notherwise.",
        "Q: And when you wrote the first part of your autobiography, From Ashes to Life, there\u2019s a hint\nof this \u2014 what happened with Rumkowsk1.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Why did it take you a few years more to decide that you would write about this?",
        "A: Because it\u2019s difficult to admit this. The times have changed. We hear now of abuse of\nchildren. We hear now of abuse of wives. Twenty years ago, we didn\u2019t talk about it. It\u2019s very\npainful to go public with something you\u2019re not proud of. What should I have done? Maybe I\nshould have run away. Maybe I should have slapped him. I don\u2019t know. Maybe I should have\ndone something. It\u2019s difficult to say, and that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t write it. The other reason I didn\u2019t\nwrite it is because my mother used to say, \u201cIf you can\u2019t say something good about a human\nbeing, don\u2019t say it.\u201d And I agonized with that for years.",
        "Q: Do you think that in some ways it helps people to understand something about Rumkowski\nthat they couldn\u2019t understand otherwise?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know whether people now really can understand our past. I think you have to have\nlived through it to understand it emotionally. Intellectually, maybe \u2014 I can\u2019t expect my\nchildren to understand the past or what it was like. It\u2019s not possible. The Holocaust has\nbecome a matter of scholarly research, of history, and it is viewed differently than it is\nviewed by those who were there. It is unavoidable, and it will change more in 20 years when\nwe are gone.",
        "Q: For me, if I can just say this, in my innocence, I would have thought that someone who took\ncare of children in an orphanage was a different kind of person. Even knowing all I know\nabout child abuse, and knowing this makes it much more understandable how he becomes\nsuch a dictator within the context of Lodz. Because it is a very odd move, it would appear.",
        "A: Yeah, but look at the people who work as nurses in a hospital and kill people by injection.\nWouldn\u2019t you expect that their training, the intellect \u2014 after all, they went to college \u2014 and\ntheir medical knowledge, to do just the opposite. And what is it in human nature that makes\nus inhuman? I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Maybe being human.",
        "A: Maybe.",
        "Q: Do people believe you?",
        "A: People believe me, except for Germany, where I was told, \u201cWe are having a problem with\nthe subject of all the Jewish elders.\u201d And I cannot understand why. As I explained to them,\npolitely at first, \u201cIf you had not invaded Poland, if you had not created the ghettos, if you had\nnot kept us prison within the ghettos, we would have had no Jewish elders. So, you shouldn\u2019t\nhave a problem because these are facts.\u201d If you question the honesty, I can only say, \u201cWere\nyou there?\u201d If you were not there, it\u2019s easy to talk. So, that\u2019s the only thing I encountered, in\nGermany, not in this country.",
        "Q: Not even with scholars?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: They accept what you say.",
        "A: They would like to see evidence. They know of other quotes in other books, of other\nparagraphs. They know of the dismissed complaint, which happened in the mid \u201930s. It is not\nsomething that appeared out of nowhere. The indications were there. The knowledge was\nthere, but in the \u201930s, for a Jewish community to admit something like this is overwhelming.\nYou couldn\u2019t do that. The publicity would have been devastating, and it wasn\u2019t done. I mean,\nthere were a lot of taboos in the \u201930s, and lots of things that were never mentioned.",
        "Q: I\u2019m trying to figure out where to go right now.",
        "A: All right.",
        "Q: Because it\u2019s late, and I know that you\u2019re after the deportation from Lodz, you were a couple\nof weeks in Auschwitz, and then you moved to Hamburg.",
        "A: Dessauer Ufer.",
        "Q: Right, to do heavy construction?",
        "A: Yes, which was a camp, and out-, a sub-camp of Neuengamme, and from there they moved\nus to Sasel, to build temporary housing for the Germans for the bombed out Germans, and\nfrom there to Bergen-Belsen.",
        "Q: And, you were in Bergen-Belsen in \u201945?",
        "A: Yes, March \u201945.",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re there for about a month before the British come.",
        "A: Just about, and I wouldn\u2019t have made it much longer.",
        "Q: It was horrible.",
        "A: The dead were not buried. The dead were lying on the walkways. Typhus was rampant. The\ndead were not even thrown into the pits. They were decaying. People died by the hundreds.\nThe Germans did not enter the camp any longer. They remained on the other side of the\nbarbed wire. The camp was guarded from watchtowers by Hungarian \u2014 by soldiers in\nHungarian uniforms who were vicious, who shot a great deal, and I think another three to\nfour weeks and Bergen-Belsen would have been empty. Nobody would have survived.",
        "Q: And were you ill by this time?",
        "A: Thad typhus and just before, and my friend who was killed in Sweden at least gave me some\nwater. I had jaundice in the ghetto. I had liver problems in the ghetto. I had kidney trouble,\nand a few other little things.",
        "Q: So, did you think that it could worse after leaving Lodz?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: But it did?",
        "A: Yes and no, because Lodz lasted three full years and the horror was overwhelming. Bergen-\nBelsen was as horrible, maybe more so, but of shorter duration. So, the impact for me was\nthe ghetto and not Bergen-Belsen because by Bergen-Belsen, you really didn\u2019t care anymore.\nThere was not enough energy left to care.",
        "Q: When you\u2019re deported from Lodz, do you know what\u2019s going on in the war? Have you heard\nany-?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So, you know nothing. You were so-",
        "A: We were in cattle cars and looking through the slits above. You had to stand on somebody\u2019s\nshoulders. You saw troop trains on adjacent tracks. You saw other trains with men in striped\ngray and blue uniforms that were shouting something at us, which you of course could not\nhear. I sat in a corner together with Dr. Singer, his sister, his wife and his two children. The\nlast time I saw him was in Auschwitz. How he died in Auschwitz, I\u2019m not sure. Somebody in\nGermany claimed he was shot. I rather doubt it. I think he was very gaunt looking and he\nlooked much older than his age. I think he just went to the gas chamber. I spent the whole\nrest of the war with his daughter partly with his wife. His wife died right after liberation of\nBergen-Belsen. His sister survived and died in London. It\u2019s really immaterial how he died.\nHe didn\u2019t make it out of Auschwitz.",
        "Q: But all during that period, from end of August, September when you arrived in Auschwitz in\nSeptember of \u201944 until April of \u201945, you were not sure what was going on \u2014 who\u2019s winning,\nwho\u2019s losing, how it\u2019s going.",
        "A: We heard some distant air raids in and around the city of Hamburg, but it was not the major\nattack of \u201943. We heard rumors because adjacent to us were some Italian prisoners of war and\nin Neuengamme were French prisoners of war. We heard rumors, but we had heard rumors\nfor five years. We had no idea.",
        "Q: I know that we can go on for a few more hours, which we will not do now. But what I would\nlike to do, and maybe well just take one more tape \u2014 maybe we\u2019ll stop now. I\u2019Il tell you what.\nWhat I think I would like to do because I would like to end this on a very sweet, romantic\nnote.",
        "A: All right.",
        "Q: Okay, and what I'd like to do is tell about the story about meeting your husband, which\nmakes a really wonderful ending, even though there\u2019s so much more you can cover. So, let\u2019s\nstop the tape now.\nTape 6",
        "Q: I changed my mind. We\u2019re going to go back to your deportation from Lodz. I\u2019d like to have\nsome description of that deportation and the train ride as far as you remember. Just describe\nit some.",
        "A: The deportation was by street. The streets were posted which were off limits as part of the\nghetto. My street was very early on the list. That meant if you did not vacate or if the Jews\ndid not vacate that street, the Germans would take us out or shoot us. I\u2019m not sure which. So,\nyou took whatever you could carry, and you vacated your rooms or room, and you could\nwalk to the other side of the bridge if you knew somebody there and stay there for awhile if\nthey would let you in, or you could go voluntarily to the railroad siding. I started walking and\nI knocked on Luba\u2019s door because she was on the other side. Her boyfriend answered the\ndoor. I told him who I was, and he said in Polish and not very politely, \u201cGet lost.\u201d He didn\u2019t\nopen the door. I knocked on another door. A friend \u2014 a coworker who was living with her\nelderly mother and whose boyfriend had died Warsaw of typhus, probably about 1940, but\nthey shared the apartment with the captain of the Sonder police and his wife and I think a\nchild, and when I knocked there, the captain from the other side of the door told me, \u201cYou\neither leave or...\u201d. So, I had no choice left but walk, and it was very warm, to the railroad\nsiding in Marysin, and there were quite a lot of people milling around with their little bundles\nor suitcases. I had a little suitcase and my father\u2019s briefcase, and the briefcase held\ndocuments \u2014 papers, passports, whatever. And I saw to the left of me Oskar Singer and his\nfamily, and they said, \u201cCome on over. We\u2019ll go together.\u201d We stood there probably for a\ncouple of hours in the heat. The Germans put up the ramp to the cattle car. We each received\na piece of bread, a half a loaf of bread, some received a whole bread, and some received\nsome sort of a sausage, but we did not \u2014 nothing to drink. We entered the cattle car, and I sat\nwith Oskar\u2019s family in one corner. There were the two old ladies, Oskar and his wife, his two\nchildren, his sister, and I. And, when we asked him, \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d He shrugged his\nshoulders. He said, \u201cProbably west for labor.\u201d That was the best guess. The cattle cars were\nclosed from the outside, and they moved in stops and starts because there were other trains\non the same siding that were given preference. Either they were prisoners from other areas or\nthey were troop movements. We were never sure. We tried to yell over to a different car, but\nof course that doesn\u2019t work. We sat in these hot cattle cars. Some people cried. Some people\nfainted. There was a bucket in the corner. The bucket soon overflowed. You couldn\u2019t lie\ndown. You could barely sit. And there was really no energy to think, \u201cWhat next? Where\nnext?\u201d At one point, somebody spoke of jumping out of the car, but the doors never opened.\nThere was no jumping. The next time the door opened was four in the morning two days later\nwith a concrete platform, brightly lit and dogs barking, and SS shouting commands. We\nscrambled out of the car, and we stood. They shouted orders, \u201cMen to the left. Women to the\nright.\u201d And I stood with the women, with the single women. Oskar and his son went to the\nother side. And they were soon marched off into the distance. We don\u2019t know where. We\ndon\u2019t how they were separated again, because at this point there was no separation between\nyoung and old. We lined up, and I held the briefcase. I held onto that briefcase with the\npapers. Having grown up in Germany, papers are very important. And the command was\nshouted, \u201cDrop your belongings.\u201d Which meant a knapsack, a bag, whatever you had, but I\nwouldn\u2019t let go of the briefcase, and an SS walked towards my friend, Dr. Singer\u2019s daughter,\nand towards me and he shouted again and she took the briefcase and tore it out of my hand,\nand he shouted back, \u201cYou saved yourself a beating.\u201d",
        "Q: So, who tore it out of your hand \u2014 Singer\u2019s daughter?",
        "A: His daughter made me drop it. She just tore it and dropped it. She probably saved my life. A\nlittle further down the road, the separated the old from the young. In back stood a woman\nwho lived also on Pawia Street, and that\u2019s another story, with a four year old child, a very\nugly child and I\u2019ve never really seen an ugly child. The child was locked up while the parents\nwent to work in the daytime. The child whined. The child was hidden behind a chimney\nduring the selection, during the curfew for hours alone, and in Auschwitz, she stood behind\nus. She was ordered to let the child go because she was probably in her \u201930s, and she\nwouldn\u2019t let the child go, and the SS man hit them between the two hands holding onto each\nother, and they didn\u2019t let go. The child screamed terribly, but they wouldn\u2019t let go, and his\nlast remarks were, \u201cYou may both go to the gas chamber.\u201d And they were marched off with\nthe old people.",
        "Q: You heard that?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And what went through your head?",
        "A: Nothing, what\u2019s a gas chamber?",
        "Q: It didn\u2019t make any sense.",
        "A: No, it didn\u2019t make any sense. By evening it did, when I saw the smoke and when the\ngrapevine carried the words forward.",
        "Q: But not then?",
        "A: No, and one was so bewildered by this whole scene that one didn\u2019t think. We heard that there\nwas a family camp in Auschwitz which we never saw. We heard that there were gypsies. We\nnever saw them. We did see Hungarian women. There was a young man in a striped uniform\nwith an armband __, red, and he spoke Polish to us and he said, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d\nAnd we said, \u201cFrom Lodz.\u201d And we asked him, \u201cWhere are we?\u201d And he said, \u201cAuschwitz.\u201d\nAnd, my friend asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s Auschwitz?\u201d He said, \u201cYou mean to say you don\u2019t know?\u201d\n\u201cNo, never heard of it.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019ve been here a year and a half, two years.\u201d He didn\u2019t\ncome from Lodz. He came from someplace else. He couldn\u2019t understand, but he did ask us\nwhether we knew his sister who might have been in our transport. And there was a woman\nwho recognized a mother who had been there a while, and she brought extra food, but that\nwas already the next day. From there, they marched us those that were fit-looking or not\nelderly or not children anymore, into a barracks. We were asked to undress, drop all jewelry,\nfold the clothing neatly, and then they took us to another barracks and they shaved our hair,\nand Dr. Singer\u2019s daughter asked, \u201cCouldn\u2019t we rather have a number?\u201d and, the answer was,\n\u201cHere you take what you get. You don\u2019t ask for anything.\u201d",
        "Q: Where did she get the idea to ask for a number? Do you know?",
        "A: She saw some women kappa with numbers who did the actual shaving under SS orders. And\nas we were walked out of that barracks, the upper half of the door was glass and I saw my\nhead minus hair and two big ears and it looked like an egg and I started to cry. It looked so\nhorrible that today I\u2019m asking myself, \u201cHow could I have been so stupid and so vain?\u201d But I\nwas. We went into something called showers, into another barracks, and they were one\nadjacent to the other \u2014 without shoes, without clothing, and by then the grapevine had said\nsomething about gas and we looked at the showerheads and we didn\u2019t know what a gas\nchamber would look like and whether gas would come out of these things on the ceiling, and\nthe little wetness dribbled down, very little, and we were pushed forward and we were each\nthrown one piece of clothing, whether it was a dress or a rag or a house robe, one piece,\nnothing else. One woman in our group was thrown a pair of Dutch wooden shoes, the rest of\nus were barefoot. It was hot in Auschwitz \u2014 being called out in the morning, it was freezing\ncold. Being called out in the afternoon, it was so hot that the rims of my ears were burning,\nmy scalp was peeling. That\u2019s how hot it was. We were given a slice of bread a day and some\nbrown liquid to drink, and in the evening there was supposed to be a soup but we were given\nno utensils. So, Alice, who had been in the ghetto, who had come from Vienna, took off her\nwooden clogs and we each took one of them, filled them with soup, drank the soup, and\nhanded it to the next 1n line, but we guarded the shoes like you would guard Fort Knox. We\nwere afraid somebody would steal them and run.",
        "Q: So, none of you got shoes?",
        "A: No, there were close to 500 of us in that barracks, and the barracks \u2014 there were no cots. The\nfloors were concrete floors and they were divided into oblong squares, oblong sections, and\neach section had to have five human beings, but there wasn\u2019t room for five. So, at night, we\nwould \u2014 one would sit against the barracks wall, spread the legs and the next one would\nmove in, until all five of us could sit that way, and in order to sleep, you would lean against\nthe neck or the chest of the person in back of you. The corner \u2014 the center of the barracks had\na raised platform, and the barracks had a couple who had been in Auschwitz quite a while,\nshe had hair. She was Jewish by the looks of her. I don\u2019t know where she came from\noriginally, not from Poland. And she had a cubicle in the corner that was sort of parceled off\n\u2014 it was sort of hidden away with a string that was attached to the right and left of the wall. It\nwas a dirty old blanket, and occasionally we\u2019d see an SS man come to visit. She screamed a\nlot. She beat us, if we weren\u2019t fast enough. I don\u2019t think she killed anybody. Her name was\nMaya. She might have been from Romania. I don\u2019t know. She did not come with us, though\nshe told us after a couple of weeks that there would be an inspection, to undress, take off the\nrag. There would be an SS inspection team in the center of the counting area. We should put\nthe dress over the right arm, and walked passed the three SS man as fast as possible, and one\nof them motioned with a stick or a riding whip, a leather whip, right left, right left. We later\nfound out that one of them was Dr. Mengele, which we did not know. We had never heard of\nhim, and it had no meaning to us until it was explained probably several years later, or a year\nlater.",
        "Q: You mean that someone explained to you a year later that it was Mengele?",
        "A: Yes. No, they said that one of them was Dr. Mengele, but we did not know who he was or\nwhat he was, and we were given another rag and a pair of random shoes. I got a size eight\nshoes; I wear a six. And we were put into cattle cars, and when they stopped two or three\ndays later, I stood on Dr. Singer\u2019s daughter\u2019s shoulders and I looked out through the little slit\nin the cattle car, and I said, \u201cYou know what? We\u2019re near Hamburg.\u201d And then she went up\nand she looked and she said, \u201cNah, just green landscapes; nothing Hamburg here. You\u2019ve\nlost your mind. It\u2019s been hot too long.\u201d And the cattle car opens up, and we were housed in a\nwarehouse of the outer harbor that housed Czech women on the other side. It housed some\nmen from various occupied countries, and they were all used for forced labor in the\nDeutschebef Blomenforce (ph), the defense industry shipyards, cleaning up the bomb damage\nin and around Hamburg. And even Dessauer Ufer was not a concept because it was the\naddress of a harbor area which to me had no meaning. It was not residential. But when they\nstarted us by truck or mainly in the subways in a corner, taking us to the worksites, and we\nhad on these rags and across the rag was a yellow painted-on stripe, and underneath the\nfabric was cut out so you couldn\u2019t run away \u2014 no stars, no nothing. Some had a purple\ntriangle, but very few. That I realized that indeed it was the surrounding of Hamburg, and for\na minute I thought, \u201cSince I know the area, I could get away.\u201d But how? To whom? Where?\nFood? And then I realized that this was ridiculous. So, they then transferred us to another\ncamp and in a now very fashionable area in Wedel where the mayor of the city lives, and\nthere is one of these temporary houses left as a memorial, and we were guarded by 42 SS\nmen and women. They needed people in the office to keep records of the SS personnel and of\nthe people in the camp. There was a young lawyer from Poland, Sophie Kalishinska (ph) and\nI, we spoke German, who got sent to the office. We had the disadvantage that the commander\nof the camp came from Southern Germany and used to be a gardener in civilian life, was\nvicious. He would come in and he would kick us with his boots. We had bloody legs and\nbloody arms, but for a while we didn\u2019t go out to work in the rain, but we took a daily beating.\nThe SS women had no compassion, no understanding. There was no typewriter. Everything\nwas written manually with a pencil, not with ink. I do not know why. Most of these SS\npeople had been drafted late in the war; they had been civil service employees before the\nwar. For the most part, they were uneducated. The women were vicious, some of them. The\nmen \u2014 some were vicious, some were not so bad. They brought in three women from Prague\nto be in charge of the camp, to be kapos. They couldn\u2019t speak Polish, but they managed\nGerman, and the story of these three women is another story. They brought in one woman\nwho was tiny, it\u2019s also another story. We couldn\u2019t tell how old she was. She probably was in\nher late \u201930s, but she ran around like a frightened mouse, and rumor had it that she was an\nMD by training. She came from Romania, and she was in charge of the hospital room, but\nnobody dared ever use it. It was used once for an abortion for a girl who became pregnant on\nthe worksite, and Dr. Gisa and I met in the latrines where we would talk a few minutes, and\nthen she would go her way and I would go my way. She had worked for Mengele in\nAuschwitz, and she did the abortions at night so the women could live and the babies died.",
        "Q: And her name again?",
        "A: Gisa Pearl.",
        "Q: Oh, Gisa Pearl.",
        "A: Yes, she was in the same camp, and there were 500 of us. She came to New York, and I saw\nher one more time after the war. I know she went to Israel, and I know she died. The camp\nwas not the worst possible place. One of the SS women took the young woman who cleaned\nthe SS barracks and me in a truck to Hamburg to pick-up provisions. We saw the bombed\ncity, and she stopped at a building in front of the building that used to be upper-middle class\nneighborhood apartments \u2014 wrought iron balconies and a lot of stucco work, very pretty. And\nshe told us curtly to get out of the truck, moved us towards the entrance, all the way back and\ndown into the basement, and she knocked on the door and the door opened and it was her\nmother. And the mother apologized for not having food, and the young woman who cleaned\nthe barracks would come from Lodz with us. She was very small, very tiny, but very friendly\nand very obliging. She told her to lie down on the couch and she covered her up and she gave\nme a chair to sit on, but not a word was spoken. We had an hour of rest and nobody spoke. I\nmean she spoke to her mother, but we didn\u2019t speak and she didn\u2019t speak. We went back to\ncamp. We didn\u2019t tell, and we couldn\u2019t quite figure out what the story was. I think that was the\nonly kind gesture on the part of a German that I can recall. When they evacuated Sasel and\nput the gypsies there, they took us to Bergen-Belsen. Except for the overcrowded barracks\nand the dead bodies, I only remember two mountains of shoes at the gate, just empty shoes \u2014\nold and new and worn, huge mountains, and what crossed my mind was, \u201cWhere are the\nfeet?\u201d But it didn\u2019t matter anymore. After Bergen-Belsen was taken over by the British, I\nworked as an interpreter and translator.",
        "Q: Had you given up in Bergen-Belsen?",
        "A: It was hopeless. I mean, we saw the dead bodies. We saw the typhus that was ravaging the \u2014\nwe only saw the women. We did not see the men. There was no possibility you could live\nanother month in Bergen-Belsen, and food wasn\u2019t important anymore \u2014 not the soup, not the\nbread, nothing. And one day we saw the Germans with white bands on their arms sort of\ntight, white rags. We couldn\u2019t figure out why, and another few days passed and then on April\n15\", the British stumbled upon the camp advancing towards the Elbe River to cut off the\nRussians, and they managed, but they found us, as well, and they were not prepared for what\nthey found. I worked for them almost from the first day, although I was sick a great deal. I\nhad a very good boss. He was a major.",
        "Q: How did they found you with the thousands of women there?",
        "A: In that small group that managed to approach the second tank, somebody asked, \u201cWhere are\nwe? What is this? Who speaks English?\u201d And there were very few people who spoke English\nbecause, coming from Poland, you speak French, not English. So, there were five or six of us\nthat knew.",
        "Q: And you were one of the ones approached?",
        "A: I said, \u201cI speak English.\u201d And we showed them around the camp. In the evening he asked,\n\u201cWhat can I give you?\u201d I said, \u201cCigarettes and some biscuits.\u201d And the only thing they could\nfind for us to eat were two pound cans of pork and lard, and they handed them out, and we\nopened up those cans with stones, with metal, whatever we could find. We had no can\nopeners. Most of us ate that stuff. It was half lard and half pork, and probably came from an\noccupied country. By morning, hundreds of people were dead, among them Dr. Singer\u2019s\nwife. His daughter and I ate the biscuits and smoked the cigarettes. I continued work and I\ndidn\u2019t know when to come to work. I was allowed to pick out a watch from the storehouse in\nthe camp where they had items sorted by watches, rings, pearls, jewelry, teeth \u2014 gold teeth,\nand I picked out a little silver watch. The back was rusted. It had a black leather band. And I\nwore the watch, and I thought, \u201cIf only somebody would say, \u2018You wore my watch,\u2019\u201d but\nnobody ever did. And a few days later, my boss asked, \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d And I said,\n\u201cT would like a shower.\u201d And he provided several of us with a Red Cross woman, a little\npiece of soap and a towel. I thought I could wash away the past. I couldn\u2019t. Eventually, we\nwere given clean clothing. It took about four weeks. The barracks had to be burned down in\nvery short notice. They buried the dead with a bulldozer. The mass graves are there, 500,000\n\u2014 5,000 \u2014 I think in all, they buried 10,000 people when I was there in September. The terrain\nis immense, the terrain of Bergen-Belsen. I would say probably bigger than Birkenau, but\nnothing remains standing because of typhus. I got one picture of one barracks and I think you\nhave the original in DC. And as I worked for the British, my boss asked me, \u201cWhat did you\ndo during the war? And where did you work? And with whom did you work?\u201d And somehow\nI mentioned those two months in the office and he said, \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I\nworked on names and addresses and kept a roster of the SS and a roster of food supplies, and\nhow many women went to each work detail,\u201d because the shipyards where we worked had to\npay the government for our labor. This is what is in dispute now, if you ever see it. And he\nsaid, \u201cYou worked 1n the office, and you wrote down their names? Do you remember any?\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cAll 42 of them.\u201d He said, \u201cNo, can\u2019t be.\u201d And he gave me a pad and pencil, and I\nwrote them down \u2014 first name, last name and address.",
        "Q: And address?",
        "A: And address because it was in and around Hamburg. It was very easy. I had lived there. I\nknew the place. I spoke the language. He didn\u2019t believe me. It took a few weeks. He checked\nit out, and he found out that it was correct, and they took the truck or lorrie, as they called it,\nand gradually we picked up one after the other, 40 of them, in and around the city, and they\nall said, \u201c\u201cWe never did anything bad unless you deserved it. We never beat you. We never\ndid anything.\u201d Two of them were with the Americans in Southern Germany, and they were\nbrought up, and I rang usually the door bell, and I asked, \u201cIs Mrs. Miller home?\u201d And then\nher father would yell, \u201cElse Miller, somebody here for you.\u201d And, she would come to the\ndoor, and the British were right behind me. I had nothing to say. I asked that I could walk\npassed the prison, Munsevan (ph) Prison. I just wanted to see them behind bars, and they all\nbegged for help, and \u201cWe\u2019ve never done anything,\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019ve always liked you.\u201d I don\u2019t\nknow what else they said. I didn\u2019t hear a thing. I was once taken to the city of Saale (ph) near\nBergen-Belsen, and it was some sort of a preliminary deposition. I was asked whether I\nwould speak German or English, and I said English, and I had gotten a blouse and a brown\nskirt and I was driven in a staff car, in an English car. I don\u2019t remember the questions. I don\u2019t\nremember the answers. I don\u2019t know what I said \u2014 probably two hours. They thanked me, and\nthey remained in prison, and a few weeks later I received little notes under the dormitory\ndoor where we were housed threatening my life. The first one was nothing. The second one\nwas wotrisome, and the third one, I was hysterical. Three days later, the British drove me\nacross the Dutch border into Belgium, into Brussels together with three other young women,\nand from Brussels to Lille, and the captain whose drive drove us. We went out for dinner in\nLille and there wasn\u2019t much to eat in \u201945 in Lille, food was rationed. They had survived a\nwar. We ate some chicken, but it tasted like leather. I forgot. He was engaged to a young\nwoman. It turned out he was Jewish and he had been born in Berlin, and he put me on the\ntrain in Lille for Paris, and he gave me the address of the Centre de Coeur, the youth hostel,\nat quatre bis rue des Rosiers. The metro opened two hours after I arrived in Paris, and I saw a\nPolish officer in the army, and I asked him in Polish, \u201cWhich subway do I take? How do I get\nthere?\u201d I had only been to Paris once as a child. I had no idea. And he told me and he\naccompanied me, and I was back in the dormitory youth hostel, but this time it was Paris \u2014 no\nfood, the food was rationed. The little clothing I had I had to sell because I needed money.\nAnd I started visiting the American embassy. They saw me coming, \u201cThere she is again.\u201d I\nmade a nuisance of myself. I\u2019ve never hated a place as much as I hated Paris at that point. It\nwas no improvement except it had no Germans, but living was horrible. I met a young\nHungarian woman there which is again, another story, who had been married in an Orthodox\nceremony at age 12 to a young man, but it was a civil ceremony. It wasn\u2019t a chupah. That\nwas to come later, but in the eyes of the law, she was the legal wife of that man who lived in\nWilliamsburg, New York. She eventually married him in Williamsburg, but that\u2019s a totally\ndifferent story. P\u2019ll mail you that story. And we lived six of us in that tiny corner on cots with\nan outhouse two stories down, and for a bath in Paris you had to pay 2 francs and go down\nthe corner to the bathhouse. It was 1945, \u00b046.",
        "Q: And the Brits gave you no money?",
        "A: No, of course not. They gave me food \u2014 all starchy, I weighed 140 pounds.",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re dying to get out of Paris.",
        "A: I\u2019m dying to get out of Europe. I got papers from a former classmate in New York, and I got\npapers eventually for Palestine from the British because I was showing that letter of\ncommendation wherever I could. There were no photocopy machines. They wanted to keep\nit, and I didn\u2019t want to let it go. It was a big battle. And I got the two papers within two days\nof each other, and the family decided that my cousin who was in the British brigade in\nEinhofen was supposed to marry me \u2014 marry me for real. I said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not coming to\nPalestine-\u201d",
        "Q: This is your family who\u2019s in Palestine.",
        "A: -I\u2019m going to New York.\u201d And I paid $500 to get on a merchant marine boat.",
        "Q: Where did you get $500?",
        "A: My uncle in Palestine sent it to a cousin in Belfort, France and it got to me. I repaid it, but a\nlong time later, with a refrigerator because they couldn\u2019t get refrigerators. It took 22 days\nfrom Bordeaux to New York because it was March, the hold was empty. There were ten of us\non the boat, and they were all, they were the Polish ambassador\u2019s sister-in-law, there was the\nfianc\u00e9 of a lieutenant colonel. They were people with considerable clout and we landed in the\nFulton Fish Market after 23 days, and I was sick all 23 days. And my friend, her parents kept\nme on their living room couch for a week, and they told me to get a job in a glove factory and\nget myself a rented room. I earned $30 a week piece work, $5 went for taxis. I paid $8 for\nrent, and I was ready to go back to Europe. I hated it. There was nothing in New York that\neven remotely appealed to me.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Really. That\u2019s how lonely it was, how isolated \u2014 I mean, I spoke the language, but there was\nnothing there. Everything I knew, everything that was familiar was in Europe. God did I hate\nthat work in that glove factory. I loved leather, but I hoped I\u2019d never see leather again, and I\nworked.",
        "Q: Where did you live? Where did you get an apartment?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t get an apartment. I got a furnished room on Long Island, on Woodside Avenue.",
        "Q: Really? And you commuted in?",
        "A: I commuted in for a nickel on the subway, and for another nickel, I bought sort of a chocolate\nsquare, chunky-something. That was breakfast. For lunch, I went to Chock-Full-o-Nuts, and I\nbought a cream cheese sandwich and a coke and it cost a quarter, and any money I had left\nover went for clothing. I went absolutely clothing crazy. I didn\u2019t care if the dress cost $10 or\n$15, I just \u2014 I just had to buy it. So, anytime I\u2019d save some money, I would buy a dress, and\nI\u2019d buy shoes in the cheapest shoe store, it was a chain in New York.",
        "Q: Bakers?",
        "A: Bakers \u2014 very high heels, and I bought them a half a size smaller instead of buying a six, I\nbought a five and a half. Why? I will never know.",
        "Q: Didn\u2019t it kill your feet?",
        "A: Of course it did. I bought several pairs over a period of time, and then my friend who had\nsent the papers invited me \u2014 rather her mother did \u2014 for Friday evening Shabbat dinner\nbecause my friend\u2019s father was somewhat conservatively religious, old-fashioned \u2014 not very,\nbut a little.",
        "Q: Could you stop for a moment? Can we stop the tape?\n[Break in tape]",
        "Q: Okay, we\u2019re back. I\u2019m sorry for that interruption. So, you\u2019re going to this house for dinner.",
        "A: And there was my friend and her husband \u2014 she had married early, I think at 17 or 18 \u2014 and\nshe was quite disturbed at the time. I don\u2019t know what the problems were, and nobody ever\nasked me, \u201cWhere have you come from? What had you done? Where had you worked?\u201d\nNothing \u2014 the past was a taboo in New York. It wasn\u2019t mentioned. It wasn\u2019t addressed.\nNobody wanted to know. They saw the newsreel, nobody spoke. And at that party was my\nfriend and her husband, her brother and his wife, and her brother\u2019s friend. And we had dinner\nand I guess we were introduced, and at one point his last name was dropped because at first it\nwas only first names, and when I heard \u201cEichengreen\u201d, the name was familiar. I had met the\nEichengreens on the way to the ghetto.",
        "Q: This is Julie?",
        "A: And Julius, and they had spoken of a son who was in Cuba and would go to the States. I\nasked him about his parents and the answer was very evasive. He had just come out of the\narmy, and then several weeks later he called \u2014 or he called my friend\u2019s mother and he asked\nwhere exactly had I come from? Or was I in Hamburg? Had I heard anything about his\nparents? And I called him back and I said, \u201cProbably.\u201d And I met him again for dinner at that\nhouse, and after dinner we walked from Sunnyside, Long Island \u2014 no, it wasn\u2019t in Sunnyside.\nIt was in Rego Park \u2014 we walked back to Sunnyside. It was about a three-hour walk and I\ntold him the whole story. It was, I think, the only time we ever talked about it. We started\ndating, and that must have been April or May.",
        "Q: Lucille, let me ask you something. What\u2019s going through you now \u2014 thinking about telling\nDan about his parents?",
        "A: The waste \u2014 the waste of a family. We started dating in May and he made me go to evening\nschool. At least I learned to type and take some shorthand. In July, we went to see his cousins\nin Los Angeles, and I liked them, cousins on both sides of the family, on the mother\u2019s side\nand on the father\u2019s side. The mother\u2019s side is partly Dreyfuss and Reinsburg and the father\u2019s\nEichengreen. And on the train from New York to Los Angeles, he proposed, and I said I had\nto think it over, and I thought it over and I said yes. It took a few days, but his aunt and uncle\nin New York and his many cousins in New York made one statement which they haven\u2019t\nlived down yet. \u201cWe don\u2019t need an Eastern European Jew in the family, and we don\u2019t need\nsomebody from the camps.\u201d The irony of that remark was that all the other cousins married\nEastern European Jews, but many years later. I was just the first one. And of course, there\nwas no contact. I did not want to see them or visit them. There was very little contact.",
        "Q: Are these the same people who made dinner for you?",
        "A: No, those are strangers in the family. The family lived in Washington Heights.",
        "Q: So, you never saw them.",
        "A: And at 69\" Street. Very rarely, once when they came to California, but not \u2014 basically no.",
        "Q: So, you were still Ostjuden?",
        "A: Of course, we are still. When we go to Berlin today, we are still Ostjuden. There\u2019s a decided\ndifference. I spoke to people now in Germany whose parents came from Lodz, but they were\nborn after the war like my children. They consider themselves German, and I said, \u201cJust\nscratch the surface. You\u2019re a Polish Jew kid.\u201d",
        "Q: So, tell me, there are at least three other men who said they wanted to marry you.",
        "A: No, they didn\u2019t really say it, but they were interested.",
        "Q: They were interested.",
        "A: They were interested.",
        "Q: When did you fall in love with Dan? Did you fall in love before than he asked you to marry\nhim?",
        "A: No, about the same time. He was very well read. He was very well educated. He saw that I\nread all the right books at the right time, and he brought them. He worked for Baker & Taylor\nin New York, which was the largest book distributor on Fifth Avenue down on 14\" Street or\nsomething. He was an export manager. He took me out for dinner. I could eat decently rather\nthan makeshift. He took me to Carnegie Hall. He took me to the theater. He took me to the\nopera. And I took him to the Yiddish Theater on Second Avenue. I think it was the first time\nhe heard of Saul Tomaszewski. His grandson now conducts the San Francisco Symphony \u2014\nTilson Thomas \u2014 still Tomaszewski.",
        "Q: So, did Dan also make you like New York?",
        "A: Yes, life changed. We found an apartment. We paid key money or black money because you\ncouldn\u2019t get anything. We started out in a room the size-",
        "Q: What does that mean \u2018key money\u2019?",
        "A: After the war, there were no apartments in New York. You \u2014 we paid about $75 for a little\nglass enclosed porch and could use the kitchen and the bath of the landlady, and eventually\nsomebody told us, \u201cThere\u2019s an apartment vacant in Sunnyside, and if you give the\nsuperintendent $500, he will let you have the apartment.\u201d And we did. It was a lot of money\n\u2014 it was a lot of army pay. We got married in Washington Heights in the rabbi\u2019s house. Dan\u2019s\nfamily did show up. Only an old friend of my mother\u2019s showed because there was nobody\nelse, and my classmate, and we went for three days in a hired car to Goshen, upstate New\nYork, because we had to get married on a Thursday because we had to go back to work on\nMonday.",
        "Q: And the date of your marriage?",
        "A: November 7, 1946.",
        "Q: And this is November 7, 2001.",
        "A: We-Ichanged jobs, and I started to work for Lionel. Do you remember those big toy trains?",
        "Q: Absolutely.",
        "A: That whistled when you threw a little pill in it, and it smoked? And it went around the track?\nI worked for the export department of Lionel. I learned to type.",
        "Q: So, did you type well finally?",
        "A: Not...90 words a minute.",
        "Q: That\u2019s very good.",
        "A: I learned to operate a Dictaphone. In those days we had Dictaphones, no computers, and I\nworked there from \u00b046 to \u201949, and then an old friend colleague of my husband\u2019s came to New\nYork, and he had started a small business in San Francisco, and he said, \u201cPack up your car\nand come out. You will work for me and I'll give you $75 to start with a week,\u201d which was a\nlot of money. And we picked up the Plymouth and we drove out. First we had a \u00b039\nPlymouth, then we had a *45, \u201946 Plymouth.",
        "Q: Moving up.",
        "A: And we drove in three days from New York to San Francisco, day and night. We drove\nstraight through.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t even stop to see the scenery?",
        "A: No, we couldn\u2019t afford to, and the whole back was all full of whatever we had in clothing,\nand I had a little portable sewing machine for some odd reason, and a portable typewriter,\nwhich with covered key, I\u2019d learned to type. I got a job in San Francisco at Westinghouse,\nand I needed FBI clearance because they were dealing with turbines and generators and\nwhatever we had to use against the Russians in those days, and it was a very uptight\norganization. There was not another Jew in the whole organization, but it was pleasant and I\nthink I made something like $300 a month which was a lot of money in 1950, and Dan\nwanted children very much, and I was very undecided, but we had the first child in 1952, and\nI stopped working for a while.",
        "Q: Were you on the fence about having children, bringing children into the world, or being a\nmother?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t want to.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t want to bring children into the world?",
        "A: No, not into this world, and we bought a lot in Berkeley because Dan\u2019s boss lived in\nBerkeley, and we build a two-bedroom house \u2014 a redwood house with a view of the Golden\nGate Bridge, and then we decided we ought to have at least two children, and then we add\ntwo rooms and a bath.",
        "Q: And were you then - it was okay to have children?",
        "A: Then it was okay.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: Because life had meaning. Life had normalized. I accepted the past. I resented the past, but I\naccepted the past, that it was a part of me, and I asked myself whether I could live without\nthe past, and I couldn\u2019t. So, it was all right. The kids grew up in Berkeley, and I went back to\nschool. I went first to the college of arts and crafts, and then went to Contra Costa College,\nand then I went to UC. It took a long time. And then I went to Golden Gate College, and I\nfinished the business courses, and I got a job as an insurance broker, and I worked there for\nabout 20 years, which made it possible to send the kids through college without having to\ntake out a loan. It gave the kids music lessons, tennis lessons, riding lessons \u2014 you name it,\nthey had it.",
        "Q: And what is Dan doing all this time? What\u2019s the business?",
        "A: Dan worked for this old friend. It was a fairly successful business. They made modern\nfireplace equipment. They manufactured it. It was a very time consuming job, a demanding\njob because the man was very difficult, very uneducated, very unschooled, from a very poor\nfamily in Germany. The father rolled cigars for a living, and he also was an alcoholic. The\nmother was Orthodox. But somehow the contrast between these two men made the business\nwork, because Dan was level-handed. He was volatile. He also became an alcoholic as he\nbecame affluent, and Dan had to carry him to bed when they went on a business trip. We\nwent a couple of times to New York because there was a show at the \u2014 Columbus Circle I\nthink. And life turned normal.",
        "Q: You found a very good person.",
        "A: Thank you.",

        "Q: [New photo shown] How about this picture?",

        "A: Mm hmm.",
        "Q: [New photo shown] And this picture?",
        "A: This is my friend Sabina who died in an automobile accident in Sweden, and the picture was\ntaken in Bergen-Belsen in Fall 1945.",
        "Q: And say who\u2019s on the left and who\u2019s on the right",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Lucille, let\u2019s talk a little bit about your family. Tell me about you\u2019re growing up. So, first I\nwant to know what was your father\u2019s name and your mother\u2019s name?",
        "Q: Very long name.",
        "Q: And where did they meet?",
        "Q: And she did?",
        "Q: Tell me what growing up with them was like. I know you were born in 1925. So, you don\u2019t\nhave to talk about the first couple of years unless you actually have a memory. What was\nhome life like for you?",
        "Q: What would happen to you if...?",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t understand what they were saying?",
        "Q: Your father remained \u2014 he was in the wine business. He was a wine importer. Was he home a\ngreat deal, or did he travel?",
        "Q: He didn\u2019t travel?",
        "Q: Was that unusual? The middle class that you were-",
        "Q: And who did you say this to?",
        "Q: So, is your memory that 1933 creates a real change for you, when you\u2019re eight years old? Is\nthat how your memory-",
        "Q: Let me go back to your parents for just a moment. Did you feel closer to one parent more\nthan another? Or were they both very similar for you?",
        "Q: So, when you would sit at lunch \u2014 I assume you ate lunch together with your parents.",
        "Q: At two o\u2019clock, or dinner, would you \u2014 and after your sister was born and she became a little\nbit older, she was born in 1930, I think-",
        "Q: Were you supposed to sit there very quietly and they would carry on the conversation, or\nwould people ask you questions about what had happened at school?",
        "Q: But you seem to remember it very fondly.",
        "Q: In spite of the restrictions.",
        "Q: Were you happy when Karin was born?",
        "Q: Did that mean that you had a place, even though she was so much younger, to laugh and be\nliked? I mean, did it give you something that you hadn\u2019t had?",
        "Q: So, were you a little bit rebellious in that household?",
        "Q: How so?",
        "Q: Did your parents explain about the Nazis, or simply said there was a change of government?\nDid you see things in the street?",
        "Q: Wait one second. The noise is really too much. Okay, I\u2019m sorry, go ahead.",
        "Q: But you clearly experienced a difference in terms of when you said that you felt, on the one\nhand, you\u2019re invisible, on the other hand, people know you\u2019re Jewish, and you\u2019re receiving\nall sorts of punishment of one sort or another. So, you\u2019re both invisible and not invisible at\nthe same time.",
        "Q: And when you would come home having been taunted or beaten up, your parents would\nknow this?",
        "Q: So, it was really bad.",
        "Q: So, you became much more afraid?",
        "Q: Of a lot of things, right?",
        "Q: So, did you then retreat into yourself? Did you stay at home more than you used to?",
        "Q: Did they say this to you?",
        "Q: Now, how was Karin, your younger sister, responding? Equally fearfully, or was she-",

        "Q: Do you survive them or you don\u2019t survive them in the dreams? Do you remember?",
        "Q: Now, before your father is sent to Poland, in 1937, you leave the place where you\u2019ve been\nliving all your life. Am I correct?",
        "Q: So, he was getting sufficient income from the real estate.",

        "Q: And that was comfortable for you?",
        "Q: And were most of your friends orthodox, as well?",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s go back up to \u201937-\u201938. How 1s it that your father is taken? Does he receive a\nnotice? Does someone come to the door and say, \u201cYou\u2019re a Polish national\u2019? And why aren\u2019t\nyou all sent out, why only your father?",

        "Q: You just stood there.",
        "Q: Okay, I want to come back a little bit. I\u2019m assuming that the luggage, when you went down\nthe first time, when your father was taken in \u00b038, was a fairly piece of luggage.",
        "Q: You, who talk about being so frightened through this period, all of a sudden, you\u2019re going to\ntake this luggage because you know it\u2019s too dangerous for your mother. Were you frightened\nwhen you went?",
        "Q: And when you saw your father, did you hug each other?",
        "Q: You did?",
        "Q: Were you annoyed with him, angered with him?",
        "Q: Frustrated with him that he \u2014 you cried.",
        "Q: And he cried?",
        "Q: No? And when he wouldn\u2019t come with you?",
        "Q: And did you cry all the way home?",
        "Q: Did you walk or did you take the subway?",
        "Q: You said you were surprised at how your mother behaved. That she seemed to change from\nthe woman you had known, so that once her husband was gone, she took over as the head of\nthe household.",
        "Q: And fairly easily I gather from what you-",
        "Q: Now, when you came home that day, did you want to fall into your mother\u2019s arms crying, or\ndid you go to your room? Do you have any recollection?",
        "Q: With your mother?",
        "Q: Did your mother cry?",
        "Q: So, that must have been very hard on both of you.",
        "Q: Did you know what to do? I mean, there\u2019s nothing.",
        "Q: Did friends come over? Other women who had also lost their husbands, or who hadn\u2019t but\nwere friends with your mother?",
        "Q: Right. Now, during this period, before your father returns for that month and then another\nfour weeks and another four weeks, the money that you have as far as you know is the same\namount that you have had before. They haven\u2019t confiscated the money yet.",
        "Q: Right, and your mother didn\u2019t move money some place.",
        "Q: Unthinkable to do?",
        "Q: Right, and you\u2019re smiling. When your father is taken the second time, does this feel more\nominous to you? You\u2019re older now of course and you do-",
        "Q: So, when did you start to worry? When he\u2019s taken out to Oranienburg?",
        "Q: Did you expect him to return in your head or were you pessimistic?",
        "Q: And how do you know she did? She said it?",
        "Q: And you never said to her...?",
        "Q: And now the money is...?",
        "Q: Blocked. And you get a hundred dollars a month from where?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: So, life is getting narrower and tighter and harder for everyone.",
        "Q: We should take a break now, the tape is running out.",
        "Q: Once your father is taken away and ends up in Dachau, and your mother is now again the\nhead of the household, because I imagine when he returned even for those 12 weeks, he\nbecame head of the household again?",
        "Q: So, then it comes back to her.",
        "Q: And her spirits keep up because she\u2019s fighting to try to get him back.",
        "Q: And she would dictate them?",
        "Q: Now, you\u2019re old enough to notice some changes. When your father comes back, does she\nchange? Does her personality seem to change?",
        "Q: She agreed?",
        "Q: So, he didn\u2019t change very much.",
        "Q: That you noticed.",
        "Q: When you saw him when he had been taken the second time, you saw him in the prison, and\nthen you saw him later, did he change significantly?",
        "Q: Did that frighten you?",
        "Q: So, it must have been tough when you folks left him and you go back with the memory of\nwhat he was looking like and where it was.",
        "Q: Would little Karin go with you, too?",
        "Q: She was by then eight, nine \u2014 nine years old.",
        "Q: Right, so you would all go together?",
        "Q: What was the funeral like?",
        "Q: There was?",
        "Q: Did you notice a change in your mother?",
        "Q: So, did you then have to take more responsibility in the family?",
        "Q: Did you understand that?",
        "Q: But, you certainly were trying, weren\u2019t you?",
        "Q: Were you disappointed?",
        "Q: And how was Karin during this period? Did she understand that your father is gone forever?",
        "Q: And did she ask you where he was?",
        "Q: So, she knew in some ways?",
        "Q: This is a strange question I just thought of, but I\u2019m going to ask it anyway \u2014 did they put the\ncigar box into the coffin?",
        "Q: Just as it was?",
        "Q: So, that was-",
        "Q: So, you go from February \u201941 until October 21*' when you get the notification. So, you\u2019re not\nworking.",
        "Q: Your mother\u2019s not working.",
        "Q: But you\u2019re going to school the whole time.",
        "Q: And your mother gets more and more reserved and withdrawn.",
        "Q: So, when you would eat together whatever the very small amounts of food you had,\nconversation?",
        "Q: It was always quiet.",
        "Q: And did you play with friends still?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: So, do you recall any moments of pleasure during that period. I mean, were these kinds of\nthings in some sense a relief?",
        "Q: Did your mother not want you to go, or she didn\u2019t say anything?",
        "Q: That it would show disrespect to go?",
        "Q: I see, but you obviously were not going to respond to that somehow.",
        "Q: And, when you were with young people, I imagine you talked about what was going on in\nsome way, or am I wrong?",
        "Q: And how did you hear about Madagascar? From the other kids?",
        "Q: You went with her or no?",
        "Q: Was that an expensive trip?",
        "Q: Do you still have a radio in your house?",
        "Q: Did you ever hear Hitler speaking on the radio?",
        "Q: Many times.",
        "Q: Where did you see him?",
        "Q: And what did you do?",
        "Q: And what did you think or feel when you \u2014 I gather you heard him on the radio?",
        "Q: Did he make you nervous? Did you think he was just crazy and this couldn\u2019t last?",
        "Q: Did you have non-Jewish friends at all?",
        "Q: For childhood?",
        "Q: None.",
        "Q: But that was it?",
        "Q: So, you actually never had a conversation...",
        "Q: ...after \u00b033...",
        "Q: ...with someone who wasn\u2019t Jewish?",
        "Q: And when you would walk on the street, you would see police, soldiers \u2014 would people move\naway from you? I mean, you didn\u2019t have any -",
        "Q: The Germans could?",
        "Q: How would you hear about restrictions? Were there curfews, places where you couldn\u2019t go?\nWere their notices in Jewish newspapers?",
        "Q: And could you ride on the subway or the train?",
        "Q: Why did you ride separate trains? Were you already conscious that you could just be picked\nup?",
        "Q: Because you weren\u2019t allowed there or because...?",
        "Q: I see. At this period, did you begin to regret that you had not gone to England alone? Did you\nthink of that?",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t think of that.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "Q: So, are you glad that you didn\u2019t become one of them?",
        "Q: Your furniture was packed up and went to Trieste in order to go to Palestine?",
        "Q: And did it get there?",
        "Q: No. So, why didn\u2019t it get there?",
        "Q: So, your understanding of what\u2019s happening, once your father dies when there\u2019s this period\nof a number of months before you get the notice, do you expect to be deported?",
        "Q: Nothing?",
        "Q: So, when -",
        "Q: In Germany\u201d",
        "Q: So, is your fear level gone down some? Are you getting used to it, or is it very high?",
        "Q: Okay. So, October 21\u2018, 1941, you get a relocation notice.",
        "Q: Well, what happened? You got something in the mail?",
        "Q: They delivered it?",
        "Q: And who delivered it. Do you remember?",
        "Q: Gestapo delivered it? And how did it come to you? Someone delivered it to the door?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Left anyway. Right.",
        "Q: So, what did you take?",
        "Q: Excuse me, what was the trip like?",
        "Q: This wasn\u2019t a cattle car with nothing in it.",
        "Q: This had benches?",
        "Q: On the sides of the cars?",
        "Q: And was there a toilet?",
        "Q: Did you remember how one...?",
        "Q: And did you bring food as well? Or did they feed you?",
        "Q: Did you meet somebody named Julie and Julius?",
        "Q: On the train. This couple sat next to you.",
        "Q: And that was it?",
        "Q: Did you like her?",
        "Q: And was she the age of your mother?",
        "Q: Much older.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to suggest that we take a break now, and when we come back we will begin with\nthe entrance into Lodz. Okay?",
        "Q: Lucille, there\u2019s one piece of the earlier story that we neglected. There may be many pieces,\nbut one piece that I know about that we neglected. Namely the putting on of the Jewish star.\nAnd you do have a story of taking it off and going somewhere.",
        "Q: And what was the opera?",
        "Q: You\u2019ve liked opera since you were 10?",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: So do I. Why didn\u2019t you like concerts?",
        "Q: It\u2019s interesting because chamber music is often a taste for somebody who\u2019s much older.",
        "Q: And did you continue to play violin?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Another instrument?",
        "Q: Why do you think?",
        "Q: We\u2019ll come back to that.",
        "Q: So, now we\u2019re going to enter Lodz.",
        "Q: When you think of the first moment that you got off the train, what did you see?",
        "Q: How big of a \u2014 like a small piece of bread?",
        "Q: Stop for a minute. What happens to washing and sanitary conditions? There\u2019s no bathrooms\nin the place. There\u2019s no showers, bathtubs, nothing. So, what happens to you physically?",
        "Q: And this was hot food.",
        "Q: No, this was-",
        "Q: Lucille, let\u2019s stop now and change the tape.",
        "Q: Lucille, I usually don\u2019t do this, but I wanted to give a sense to those people who will watch\nthe interview that, as far as I know, there were over 31,000 departments in the Lodz ghetto,\nand a little over 700 had running water. Just for a people to get a sense of this population of\nover 200,000 people, what you were living in, in terms of the sheer physical conditions let\nalone everything else.",
        "Q: So, the stench must have been unbelievable.",
        "Q: So, I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of time. Those first six weeks, this is the most shocking\nthing that happens to you \u2014 I mean, other than the shock of the death of your father, but that\u2019s\na different kind of a shock. This 1s a physical as well as a psychological shock to you to be\ntaken to Lodz and to be living under conditions that you\u2019ve never come \u2014 you\u2019ve never lived\nlike this.",
        "Q: And, during this, before you moved to Pawia Street, these first four to six weeks, do you see\n\u2014 you\u2019re living with 1,100 people in a very small building. Do people change a lot? Do\npeople start fighting with each other? Do you see things even amongst the three of you where\nthere are changes and it\u2019s difficult?",
        "Q: How\u2019d your mother change?",
        "Q: Your sister is 11, and you\u2019re 16. So, what is it for her? Is 1t harder for her because she\u2019s so\nmuch younger? Or is it not harder?",
        "Q: Did she have friends?",
        "Q: Nobody had them.",
        "Q: So, the kids did not play.",
        "Q: What about you? What happened to you during those first couple of months?",
        "Q: But, there are, I don\u2019t know, at least a few thousand Germans who went into the Lodz ghetto,\nam I right?",
        "Q: But not when you came?",
        "Q: Because there was a lot of hostility?",
        "Q: So, you were in \u2014 it\u2019s not the same situation you were in Germany with the Nazis or the\nGerman non-Jews against you. But there\u2019s somewhat of a similarity within the context of this\nhorrible situation.",
        "Q: So, how did you learn?",
        "Q: And, your mother could speak.",
        "Q: Did she try to get a job or was she \u2014 or did she not even try?",
        "Q: Except the noontime soup.",
        "Q: So, the people who are working are getting noontime soup plus the rations that you are all\ngetting. And you would cook these rations in your little room \u2014 or try to.",
        "Q: So, how quickly did you feel that you were starving?",
        "Q: And thirsty, I would imagine, or not?",
        "Q: You did?",
        "Q: I\u2019m worried about the sound. Is that going to be all right?",
        "Q: Could you take some of these rations and go to this market \u2014 there was an outdoor market,\nand try to get some food of some kind, or was there very little?",
        "Q: So, let me ask you something. So, you\u2019re in Pawia Street, in the end of November, beginning\nof December? Something like that?",
        "Q: Now, your mother\u2019s 50\" birthday is January 5\".",
        "Q: 1942.",
        "Q: And she\u2019s beginning to deteriorate at this point.",
        "Q: With a disease or by starvation, her body is...?",
        "Q: And this is what was happening to her?",
        "Q: So, what could you do for her? Was there anything that could be done? Did you try with\nsome desperation to get food, to get more food, rather?",
        "Q: What?",
        "Q: And there were enough people to keep open this cosmetic store who would buy things?",
        "Q: And I gather you never did that.",
        "Q: Did you?",
        "Q: Because you had never had one before?",
        "Q: And what did you think?",
        "Q: So, they were more modern in some ways than where you came from.",
        "Q: If one wants to use that kind of terminology.",
        "Q: Did you ever buy lipstick?",
        "Q: So, you did use lipstick.",
        "Q: Did your mother make-up herself so you would look better?",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about Germany now.",
        "Q: So, when your mother begins to take on the symptoms of what one might call the disease of\nstarvation, the diseases that come with starvation, do you kids sit in the house \u2014 the apartment\nwith her?",
        "Q: Were you with her?",
        "Q: Stopped?",
        "Q: She laughed?",
        "Q: Can I - because these are the big deportations \u2014 can I go back a little bit?",
        "Q: May of \u201942, before your mother died.",
        "Q: And did you have an instinct that another deportation couldn\u2019t possibly be better?",
        "Q: This is Jules and Julius.",
        "Q: And your mother by then is not very well, anyway.",
        "Q: I want to ask you a question. It\u2019s very unusual, I think, for two children to not metaphorically\nbury their mother but to really bury...",
        "Q: ...one of their parents.",
        "Q: I would imagine. It must have been one of the worst days of your life in your memory.",
        "Q: How did you do it, the two of you? You carried your mother\u2019s body?",
        "Q: And did you say to each other, \u201cWe have to bury her.\u201d",
        "Q: You just did it.",
        "Q: Did you see anyone else doing that?",
        "Q: Were you crying when you were digging?",
        "Q: You were just digging.",
        "Q: And did you say prayers?",
        "Q: You just finished and left?",
        "Q: And did you and Karin hold hands walking back to hold on to each other.",
        "Q: And did you go back home?",
        "Q: Home.",
        "Q: And clearly you did not whatever sitting shiva would be, you did not.",
        "Q: So, there\u2019s no \u2014 you can\u2019t mourn, you just have to-",
        "Q: So, you never cried.",
        "Q: Not then. And Karin simply stops talking.",
        "Q: I mean, really physically-",
        "Q: And do you know whether she was talking when she went to school, or did she...?",
        "Q: And of course in that circumstance so many people were suffering, who\u2019s going to take care\nof this little kid?",
        "Q: Now, you tell this story about this person who says, \u201cWhat will you give in exchange?\u201d You\ndid not understand. What do you understand now? What was he doing?",
        "Q: So, you came to understand that this was not an unusual feature of the ghetto for women?",
        "Q: You learned that.",
        "Q: Okay, so September comes...",
        "Q: In the old orphanage?",
        "Q: Where was it?",
        "Q: Helenowek.",
        "Q: Now, this is Branya.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: And when did this happen?",
        "Q: With Goetz?",
        "Q: She was the executive secretary to Rumkowski, so she had a very high position.",
        "Q: I want to stop. I don\u2019t like doing this, but I want to go back because you\u2019re now moving\nmuch too fast, and I really don\u2019t have much time. So, I'll tell you what we\u2019re going to do.\nWe\u2019re going to stop the tape. And then, I\u2019m going to come back and we\u2019 ll go a little bit more\nslowly.",
        "Q: Lucille, I want to bring us back because you moved much too quickly for me.",
        "Q: Don\u2019t be sorry, it\u2019s fine. You said when Karin was taken away, you all \u2014 and Karin 1s, well,\nshe\u2019s going with children. There\u2019s also 70,000 people, I think who\u2019s in these deportations\nduring this couple of months. Am I not right?",
        "Q: But, it was a few thousand people over the course-",
        "Q: You said that people went on, and what you lost in some ways was your feelings. So, in order\nto go on, you clearly didn\u2019t forget Karin, but you couldn\u2019t respond to her going, I gather, in\nsome way.",
        "Q: Did you use Karin\u2019s ration card? Did she have one even?",
        "Q: She had one. Did you use it?",
        "Q: And you knew this story.",
        "Q: And that was later?",
        "Q: So, what was it that made you not use the coupon? Was there something immoral about it to\nyou?",
        "Q: So, she\u2019s taken away in September.",
        "Q: You work for Goetz ends when in October?",
        "Q: Before deportation. So, you\u2019re four to six weeks without a job before you get the job \u2014 before\nSpiegel meets you.",
        "Q: So, you start working there, working on these forms.",
        "Q: You're filling in forms.",
        "Q: And, these coal rations from the Jews-",
        "Q: How does this work?",
        "Q: I see. So, this had to be a fairly quick turnaround, so people could get there...",
        "Q: So, who are you actually working for? Spiegel works for Neftalin.",
        "Q: And, you work for Spiegel, and are there other people working for Spiegel, or just you?",
        "Q: In the whole office?",
        "Q: So, what did you think of Spiegel when you first met him?",
        "Q: What did you notice him? Did you know that he was a published person?",
        "Q: So, does he begin when you first start working there, to come over to you and ask you read or\nhe\u2019s going to read to you? How \u2014 because you begin a relationship together, how does it\nbegin for you?",
        "Q: Eight-oh-nine?",
        "Q: Sorry.",
        "Q: One second that noise is really \u2014 close the door.",
        "Q: Lucille, I\u2019m really sorry, there was an awful lot of noise outside. You won\u2019t be interrupted\nagain. So, you were starting to talk about how you began to have a closer relationship with\nSpiegel and you\u2019re talking about the janitor, Betchak?",
        "Q: Why did he have to tell you what to think?",
        "Q: And how different was it?",
        "Q: It was his wife?",
        "Q: You never told him.",
        "Q: He spoke to you in Yiddish.",
        "Q: So, what did he say to you in Yiddish?",
        "Q: Yes, what did is say about Rumkowski?",
        "Q: About the song?",
        "Q: So, he saw that scene?",
        "Q: But, in this period, you\u2019re working there from October \u201942 until the end of \u201943. Is that right?",
        "Q: Okay. So, it\u2019s a number of months.",
        "Q: Now, is there \u2014 Soon after he starts walking you home, does he take your hand and hold your\nhand?",
        "Q: And, is this...",
        "Q: Meaning himself?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: There\u2019s a growl from the world. How bad is that?",
        "Q: Okay, well, we\u2019re finally back after this long break, and I believe where we ended was you\nwere going to \u2014 somebody\u2019s whistling \u2014 1s this all right? \u2014 what your mother would have\nthought had she been alive and you told her that Spiegel wanted to marry you.",
        "Q: And why? Because of you or because of him?",
        "Q: And were these things you thought about at the time?",
        "Q: So, you were very-",
        "Q: So, if that was the case, what in your mind was going on when you spent evening after\nevening with him and you knew that he was in some way falling in love with you, I suspect,\nno?",
        "Q: Did he ever ask you a question? Or was he always talking at you?",
        "Q: Is it the case that at some point he said that he wanted to live with you if you couldn\u2019t get\nmarried?",
        "Q: Was he your first boyfriend, in some way\u201d?",
        "Q: And you do consider him a first love?",
        "Q: But you were a very innocent young woman?",
        "Q: Did you nevertheless see that there were a lot of affairs going on \u2014 that people were\ncoupling?",
        "Q: Did you think of that as being a kind of desperation, that people thought they might die?",
        "Q: Were women \u2014 if you knew this at the time and maybe you can only know this on reflection\n\u2014 were women in some sense in a more vulnerable position because more men had jobs and\nmore men were in a position to give women things?",
        "Q: No?",
        "Q: And there were a lot of women in power, as far as you know?",
        "Q: And you knew all this when you were there?",
        "Q: Later?",
        "Q: Slowly.",
        "Q: Was this shocking to you?",
        "Q: Why?",
        "Q: Did you ever see anything that was shocking to you in that regard?",
        "Q: You did?",
        "Q: So, you saw things \u2014 people actually coupling in public places.",
        "Q: To him?",
        "Q: I could imagine.",
        "Q: You and your husband?",
        "Q: And your two children.",
        "Q: So, when Neftalin sends you to Oskar Singer, you still see Spiegel throughout that whole...",
        "Q: So, tell me about working \u2014 where you glad to go?",
        "Q: You wanted to stay in that office?",
        "Q: And why would you have thought that Neftalin sent you there in order to get you away from\nRumkowski, since Rumkowski could go anywhere?",
        "Q: I see. So, that\u2019s quite possible.",
        "Q: What kind of a person was Singer? Did you get to know him?",
        "Q: And nobody mentioned Hamburg?",
        "Q: In 1943?",
        "Q: I\u2019m looking surprised.",
        "Q: Well, maybe for some, but has not been for me.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: Threatened you or threatened Spiegel?",
        "Q: Let me stop you for a minute. Is this the time when Spiegel stops seeing you?",
        "Q: After he stopped seeing you?",
        "Q: So, perhaps he stopped because he was frightened, or you didn\u2019t tell him?",
        "Q: Is it possible that Rumkowski went to Spiegel and said, \u201cStop\u2019\u2019\u201d?",
        "Q: And, how did you \u2014 that\u2019s a question you can\u2019t answer. All of these women who were in the\nwomen\u2019s police who came in and you\u2019re the only one who\u2019s in another \u2014 was in another job?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: All right, I want to go back to being in Singer\u2019s office for a minute. Did you learn anything? I\nunderstand it was boring, but you didn\u2019t have colleagues on a regular basis.",
        "Q: But did you learn things about the ghetto from being in that office that you would not have\nknown otherwise or that you did not know before about how things were operating?",
        "Q: And did Singer write down more than ever went into the Chronicle? He had many more \u2014\nbecause I\u2019m sure when he went out to talk with the people, he must have taken down notes.",
        "Q: He would write...",
        "Q: So, you didn\u2019t type these reports?",
        "Q: So, when you say you were clerking, what would that mean?",
        "Q: So, you weren\u2019t completely, given the kind of job you were doing, you were not completely\nunhappy going to the kitchen.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s hold here. We have to change the tape.",
        "Q: Lucille, we\u2019ll talking about the kitchen, and you were mentioning, before we were talking\nabout the actual cooking, there were people at the \u2014 women at the door clipping coupons.\nWhere did people get the coupons?",
        "Q: One dinner for one coupon?",
        "Q: And your job was figuring out the mathematics of we have this much food and how much for\neach person?",
        "Q: And who decided what the menu would be?",
        "Q: And how many people per evening usually?",
        "Q: That\u2019s a lot of people.",
        "Q: Was there a large kitchen, or was it a very makeshift kind of thing?",
        "Q: And were you also the youngest person working in the kitchen?",
        "Q: Rumkowski came in every night \u2014 to eat?",
        "Q: So, he comes in and he\u2019s sort of a monster to people.",
        "Q: Were you frightened of him?",
        "Q: Were you frightened based on what you saw or what you had been hearing?",
        "Q: Both?",
        "Q: Now, I\u2019m a little confused about timeframe when it comes to the various conversations you\nhad with people about Rumkowski. Spiegel says things to you \u2014 that he\u2019s a pig or a pest, and\nthat one has to be careful of him. You meet other people Shlomo (ph), Branya, Luba.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: When you working with Singer?",
        "Q: Dorka?",
        "Q: And Shlomo, when did you meet Shlomo \u2014 Shlomo Hect (ph), he has the pushcart.",
        "Q: So, right in the beginning you hear stories because he tells you-",
        "Q: -about Sergei-",
        "Q: -who was his friend, and was investigating Rumkowsk1.",
        "Q: This is Sergei?",
        "Q: How does it come that Shlomo tells you about Sergei\u2019s investigation of Rumkowski? Is it\njust because Rumkowsk1 is part of a lot of conversation?",
        "Q: So, Shlomo tells you about four children or three children? He tells you about Branya.",
        "Q: Including Branya and Dorka.",
        "Q: So, you have a sense of what Rumkowski was doing in an orphanage to little children-",
        "Q: Or not?",
        "Q: But, he tells you he takes children into a room and undresses them.",
        "Q: Or molests them in some way.",
        "Q: So, it\u2019s just a story.",
        "Q: When you meet Branya, who was the first person who actually experiences this and is still\nexperiencing it in the ghetto-",
        "Q: So, you never found out from her, as much a story as you heard from Shlomo?",
        "Q: And then Dorka, who tells you about this little child, Manya.",
        "Q: Who he molests-",
        "Q: And she runs away fearful.",
        "Q: And then she continues in some way going to Rumkowsk1.",
        "Q: But she was in the orphanage before the war.",
        "Q: So, she was molested as a child and then as adult woman she agrees to do it 1n order to\nprotect this-",
        "Q: Did he know what she was doing? Her \u2014 the man she was living with?",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Now, you meet Luba in \u201943-\u00b044",
        "Q: You\u2019re a little older now. Do you now begin to understand what he\u2019s doing?",
        "Q: You liked her?",
        "Q: Did she work in the kitchen also?",
        "Q: I see. So, you and she moved into that position-",
        "Q: -from the Singer job, as well.",
        "Q: I see. So, are you \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s unconsciously nervous about Rumkowski because he\nin some sense pointed you out to himself, \u201cI will see you again.\u201d",
        "Q: So, you are a still in an innocent way.",
        "Q: So, then what happens?",
        "Q: Did he undress you?",
        "Q: So, he didn\u2019t -",
        "Q: Touching him?",
        "Q: When he beat you the first time, he never beat you again?",
        "Q: He beat you several times?",
        "Q: He locked the door-",
        "Q: -to the office when he came.",
        "Q: Did you scream when he hit you?",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t cry?",
        "Q: Why?",
        "Q: You cried.",
        "Q: Did he beat you more when you cried?",
        "Q: Did he try to kiss you?",
        "Q: And he kissed you?",
        "Q: Yes. Do you have any idea why, when you refused, he said, \u201cYou can\u2019t refuse.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t\nhave said, \u201cYou can\u2019t refuse me. I\u2019m going to move you into an apartment.\u201d Because he\nclearly had the power to do so.",
        "Q: So, you don\u2019t know what he would have done?",
        "Q: So, clearly this was happening with a number of women-",
        "Q: -in that kitchen.",
        "Q: You were not the only one pointed out.",
        "Q: So, how long were you working in this kitchen.",
        "Q: And how often did he try to come and see you?",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: Approximately how many times did he come to see you in particular? Do you remember how\nmany? A few times a week, once a week?",
        "Q: Did you talk to Luba about this?",
        "Q: So, did you explain to the doctor what was happening?",
        "Q: And she said you don\u2019t have to worry about pregnancy.",
        "Q: Did you menstruate at all during the ghetto?",
        "Q: Nobody did?",
        "Q: Had you menstruated before?",
        "Q: Of course, and you just stopped.",
        "Q: Was she, the doctor, shocked at what you told her about what Rumkowski was doing?",
        "Q: Amused?",
        "Q: So, she didn\u2019t ask you anything about what this was doing to you or what-",
        "Q: - because this was not relevant?",
        "Q: And, even Luba laughed because of your thinking that you could pregnant from this.",
        "Q: Did she say anything else to you about?",
        "Q: About Rumkowski?",
        "Q: So, you didn\u2019t talk-",
        "Q: Did she in some sense after all these years, gain some power, now that she was a woman and\nnot a girl, with him?",
        "Q: Actually, what I meant was that in some way she had a certain kind of power with\nRumkowski.",
        "Q: She didn\u2019t use it?",
        "Q: To him?",
        "Q: So, when this is happening, that he\u2019s forcing you in essence to masturbate him.",
        "Q: Where are you in your head? Do you go somewhere? Do you leave?",
        "Q: You\u2019re in fear.",
        "Q: And it\u2019s the same thing each time.",
        "Q: And it only stops because the kitchen 1s closed.",
        "Q: You think?",
        "Q: Was that hard work?",
        "Q: And, then you get somebody to fix them.",
        "Q: And you didn\u2019t buy a pair of boots because \u2014 weren\u2019t these boots something that were made\nfor you.",
        "Q: So, why is that you\u2019ve never bought a pair of boots since then?",
        "Q: And never wanted another pair of boots?",
        "Q: It\u2019s good you lived in California.",
        "Q: That\u2019s true. So, did these \u2014 when they fixed the boots, it was okay?",
        "Q: And how long were you working in the leather factory?",
        "Q: And you get there a few months before. You worked there a few months or longer?",
        "Q: And, Rumkowski doesn\u2019t follow you?",
        "Q: And, do you ever talk to anyone else before you leave the ghetto?",
        "Q: Does it in some way leave your mind or does it wear on you?",
        "Q: And when you wrote the first part of your autobiography, From Ashes to Life, there\u2019s a hint\nof this \u2014 what happened with Rumkowsk1.",
        "Q: Why did it take you a few years more to decide that you would write about this?",
        "Q: Do you think that in some ways it helps people to understand something about Rumkowski\nthat they couldn\u2019t understand otherwise?",
        "Q: For me, if I can just say this, in my innocence, I would have thought that someone who took\ncare of children in an orphanage was a different kind of person. Even knowing all I know\nabout child abuse, and knowing this makes it much more understandable how he becomes\nsuch a dictator within the context of Lodz. Because it is a very odd move, it would appear.",
        "Q: Maybe being human.",
        "Q: Do people believe you?",
        "Q: Not even with scholars?",
        "Q: They accept what you say.",
        "Q: I\u2019m trying to figure out where to go right now.",
        "Q: Because it\u2019s late, and I know that you\u2019re after the deportation from Lodz, you were a couple\nof weeks in Auschwitz, and then you moved to Hamburg.",
        "Q: Right, to do heavy construction?",
        "Q: And, you were in Bergen-Belsen in \u201945?",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re there for about a month before the British come.",
        "Q: It was horrible.",
        "Q: And were you ill by this time?",
        "Q: So, did you think that it could worse after leaving Lodz?",
        "Q: But it did?",
        "Q: When you\u2019re deported from Lodz, do you know what\u2019s going on in the war? Have you heard\nany-?",
        "Q: So, you know nothing. You were so-",
        "Q: But all during that period, from end of August, September when you arrived in Auschwitz in\nSeptember of \u201944 until April of \u201945, you were not sure what was going on \u2014 who\u2019s winning,\nwho\u2019s losing, how it\u2019s going.",
        "Q: I know that we can go on for a few more hours, which we will not do now. But what I would\nlike to do, and maybe well just take one more tape \u2014 maybe we\u2019ll stop now. I\u2019Il tell you what.\nWhat I think I would like to do because I would like to end this on a very sweet, romantic\nnote.",
        "Q: Okay, and what I'd like to do is tell about the story about meeting your husband, which\nmakes a really wonderful ending, even though there\u2019s so much more you can cover. So, let\u2019s\nstop the tape now.",
        "Q: I changed my mind. We\u2019re going to go back to your deportation from Lodz. I\u2019d like to have\nsome description of that deportation and the train ride as far as you remember. Just describe\nit some.",
        "Q: So, who tore it out of your hand \u2014 Singer\u2019s daughter?",
        "Q: You heard that?",
        "Q: And what went through your head?",
        "Q: It didn\u2019t make any sense.",
        "Q: But not then?",
        "Q: Where did she get the idea to ask for a number? Do you know?",
        "Q: So, none of you got shoes?",
        "Q: You mean that someone explained to you a year later that it was Mengele?",
        "Q: And her name again?",
        "Q: Oh, Gisa Pearl.",

        "Q: Okay, we\u2019re back. I\u2019m sorry for that interruption. So, you\u2019re going to this house for dinner.",
        "Q: This is Julie?",
        "Q: Lucille, let me ask you something. What\u2019s going through you now \u2014 thinking about telling\nDan about his parents?",

        "Q: So, you never saw them.",
        "Q: So, you were still Ostjuden?",
        "Q: So, tell me, there are at least three other men who said they wanted to marry you.",
        "Q: They were interested.",
        "Q: When did you fall in love with Dan? Did you fall in love before than he asked you to marry\nhim?",
        "Q: So, did Dan also make you like New York?",

        "Q: And the date of your marriage?",
        "Q: And this is November 7, 2001.",

        "Q: That\u2019s very good.",
        "Q: Moving up.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t even stop to see the scenery?",

        "Q: You didn\u2019t want to bring children into the world?",
        "Q: And were you then - it was okay to have children?",
        "Q: Why?",
        "Q: And what is Dan doing all this time? What\u2019s the business?",

We\u2019re not on camera now, but I can\u2019t say enough about your\npatience with all that we had to go through today, and I\u2019m so grateful that you were able to\ncome and to give us such a really, such a sustained and interesting and open story, and you\u2019re\njust really wonderful.",

        "A: Cecilia Landau.",
        "A: When I came to New York, and the abbreviation for Cecilia was Cillie, and in English it\nsounds \u201cCillie\u201d. So, somebody talked \u2014 talked me into changing the name to Lucille, Cecilia,\nand I should have just left 1t Cecilia, but it was too late.",
        "A: No, not really, but sometimes when somebody says, \u201cLucille, come here.\u201d I don\u2019t hear it. If\nsomebody would say, \u201cCecilia\u201d I would hear.",
        "A: No, Lucille is fine.",
        "A: That\u2019s fine.",
        "A: My father\u2019s name was Benno Landau, short for Benjamin. My mother name was Sala Landau\nbefore that it was actually Sala Baumwollspinner.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: They met shortly after the First World War, in Cottbus, Germany, where my mother\u2019s older\nbrother had established a wine import-export business and was very successful. And, my\nmother \u2014 my father was already in Vienna and in Germany. My mother came from Sambor,\nPoland, because she was already in her late 20s, and there was no suitable suitor who came\nknocking. So, my grandmother sent her \u2014 she was the youngest of eight or ten children \u2014 to\nCottbus hoping she would find a husband.",
        "A: She did, because my father worked for her older brother as a salesman.",
        "A: It was very predictable. It was very middle class. It was very secure. It was very\nunpretentious, although there was a maid for the children and a maid for the house, and we\nwent on nice vacation. There were music lessons and English lessons and dancing lessons.\nBut we took it for granted. My parents were rather strict \u2014 strict in terms of schooling, of\ngrades, strict when I didn\u2019t practice violin. Children had to be seen but not heard. When my\nparents discussed personal things or business events, they would speak Polish. I did not\nunderstand. When they talked to me and later on to my sister, 1t was in German.\nOccasionally, they would speak French, but not very often. It was \u2014 it was a nice childhood.\nThe memories I have until 1933, when I was eight, are warm and they are loving. I really\ncould not fault my parents for anything other than that were really very, very strict and very\ndemanding. It was very important that a report card had an \u201cA\u201d, maybe a \u201cB\u201d\u2019, but anything\nbelow that was not acceptable.",
        "A: Nothing would happen, but there would be reprimand, there would be a conference with the\nteacher, and after \u00b033, when the grades slipped considerably, then there was a different tutor\nevery afternoon \u2014 one for German, one for Math, one for English, one for French, and the\ngrades did improve. What my parents did not consider was that the outside world had an\ninfluence on children. They told us that things would change. It would not remain this way.\nThe neighbor\u2019s children would begin to play with us again. The boys would no longer beat us\nup on the way to school. It would \u2014 life would normalize. They didn\u2019t say exactly when, but\nthey were very reassuring and very convinced that there would be a political change. And my\nparents, of course, could not vote in German elections. They never became naturalized\nGerman citizens. They didn\u2019t want to. We went to Poland quite frequently to see the family,\nto see Grandmother, and what I heard in Poland as a very young child was that you, in\nGermany, are complaining about anti-Semitism. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like in Poland.\nYour economic conditions do not compare to ours. To me, it did not make sense.",
        "A: No. I could not comprehend. My grandmother spoke Polish. She spoke Yiddish to me, and I\nanswered in German, but I really did not comprehend. The family in Poland was well-off, but\nnothing compared to life in Germany. For instance, the streets in this little town were not \u2014\nthe streets were dirt streets, and when the peasants were pushing their wagons through the\nmain street of the town, they took their shoes off because it was muddy, and I could see their\nfeet with the \u2014 with the mud oozing through the toes. When we arrived by train in Poland, we\nwere picked up by a cousin with a horse and buggy. Well, I would not go into the buggy \u2014\nnot with a horse in front of it that was moving. I was used to a black taxi with white stripes.\nSo, these things I remember. I remember them warmly. I \u2014 I remember that, and I appreciate\nthat, I had a part of that culture, because it ended too soon.",
        "A: No, he didn\u2019t travel at all.",
        "A: No, no. He had traveling salesman, and he was home continually. He came home for lunch\ntime. He went with us on vacations every summer. It was usually a month or six weeks. How\nwell the business did, I never knew. I was never told. I had a small allowance, probably of 50\ncents a month. I didn\u2019t need anything, and I was not allowed to buy frivolous items. The\nclothing for the kids was custom made.",
        "A: Middle class and upper-middle class it was custom made, yes. In those days, a man did not\nbuy ready-made suits. There were hardly any. I went to a private Jewish school. The teachers\nwere \u2014 at that time \u2014 in their late 50s, and to me terribly old. They were very strict and they\nwere very orthodox. You had to adhere to the rules and regulations. On Saturday, you didn\u2019t\ntake a streetcar. You didn\u2019t write. You did not carry a purse. You pinned your handkerchief\nto your jacket. You learned Hebrew, post-modern Hebrew. You learned Humash and\nGemora and you had to translate. It was mandatory, five days a week. School was not a\nhappy experience. It was very rigid, very regimented, very German in spite of the fact that\nthe teachers were all Jewish, very demanding and it lacked compassion, understanding for\nthe children. We were told going home on the streetcar to stand in the back, to be quiet, not\nto talk loudly, not to draw attention, and I remember saying one day, \u201cThey want us to\nbecome invisible. How does one do that?\u201d",
        "A: I said it both to my parents and to some friends, because I could not understand the\nrestrictions. I could not understand what I had done to deserve the punishment of being\nbeaten up on the street or having stones thrown at me or obscene names. I did not \u2014 I did not\nrealize the impact, and I believed at that point, that it would change.",
        "A: It\u2019s between \u201933 and \u201936. It was over a three-year period.",
        "A: They were very similar both in background, in education, in upbringing. I would say my\nmother was more reserved. She never contradicted my father. She agreed with all of his\ndecisions. I think I can only recall two times when she disagreed. She came home one day\nand had cut off her long black hair which was tied to the top of her head, and she came home\nwith a fashionable bob. And the other thing she did \u2014 which was before I was born, but I\nheard the story \u2014 during the inflation, under the inflation of 1922, she pawned her silver to\nkeep the business afloat, and she did not ask permission. After the business prospered, she of\ncourse got it back, but I think during the middle \u201930s, early \u201930s, she deferred him in all other\ndecisions. I did not know at that time that my father bought commercial real estate. It was\nnever mentioned. The decision was made between my father and my mother\u2019s brother,\nyounger brother, who was an associate, but we had no idea about it. We might have picked\nup a word or two, but we would have never asked. That wasn\u2019t done.",
        "A: At two o\u2019clock.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: There were very few questions at the dinner table. The maid would sometimes bring in a dish\nor plates, and then the language would immediately switch to Polish. We were asked\nquestions about school, but not necessarily at the dinner table. It was when it came time to do\nhomework, or when you wanted to postpone homework and the answer was, \u201cNo, homework\nfirst.\u201d It was a typical education of the \u201930s when you had to be within the role of a child, not\nhave the freedom of being light-hearted or joking or tell funny stories. It wasn\u2019t done.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes because it was very secure. It was very predictable, and it gave us a sense of belonging.\nIt gave us a sense of being cared for. It gave us a sense of never missing anything. Anything\nthat was necessary for a normal life or a satisfactory life was provided. You didn\u2019t have to\nask for it.",
        "A: Yes, I was delighted.",
        "A: Well, I wanted a sister, and I put a cube of sugar on the windowsill so the stork would come\nand take the sugar and bring a sister. Yes, we played, even though there was a five-year\ndifference. She was very fast, very bright, and very pretty, and when she started school, I had\nto listen, \u201c\u201cWhy can\u2019t you behave like your sister? Why can\u2019t you be as intelligent as your\nsister? Why do you have to talk out of turn? Why can\u2019t you bring home A\u2019s like your sister?\u201d\nAnd that was a little difficult.",
        "A: Maybe not in the household, but definitely at school. At school, I got into trouble here and\nthere.",
        "A: I would talk out of turn and we organized some pranks for teacher. I could think of putting\nthumb tacks some place, or put some glue on the chair. Or, when it\u2019s later on, when the\nphysics professor said, \u201cTurn the Bunsen burner on low,\u201d I turned it on high, and all the\nwindows blew out, and my dad had to pay for new windows. So, I had my share of troubles.",
        "A: Yes, I saw the uniforms - first the brown uniforms with the red arm bands and the hats, which\nwas called the SA. We saw the children in uniform, young children \u2014 white shirts, brown\nskirts or trousers, and sort of a brownish necktie. We did not see many other uniforms at that\npoint. The green uniforms came much later. The local police wore greenish uniforms.",
        "A: The precinct police wore green uniforms and those silly helmets, but they were separate.\nEach precinct had a \u2014 each living area had a precinct and it was mandatory that when you\nmoved into an apartment or into a house that you register at the precinct \u2014 name, address,\noccupation, tax id number, and religion. When you decided to move from A Street to B\nStreet, you went back to the precinct. You told them where you\u2019re moving to. You went to\nthe new precinct, and you went through the procedure again. This system still exists in\nGermany and in France, and this was probably one of the reasons that you could keep tabs on\npeople.",
        "A: Well, I was visible, but the adults wanted me to be invisible, not to draw any attention.\nWhile, on the other hand, we took the punishment regardless of where we stood, where we\nwalked or what we did.",
        "A: Yes, and could tell it by the dirty clothing because it was soiled from the stones and from the\ndirt that they threw at us. Sometimes, it would be a black eye.",
        "A: It got progressively worse. At first it was taunts and remarks, and then it became physical.\nBut they tried to comfort us, but I think, as children, or as growing children, we were afraid\nand became subsequently more so.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: I stayed at home more, or somebody had to bring me to a friend\u2019s house or pick me up. I\nstarted to draw and paint a great deal. My grades slipped terribly, and that\u2019s when most of my\nspare time was occupied with tutors. The grades improved, but I don\u2019t think the happiness\nchanged or the unhappiness changed. I would have like to leave the country like many of my\nschool friends, but my parents saw no reason to leave because, in their eyes, we were former\nnationals. We had the protection of another government and we were untouchable.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: She was not. She was somehow able to ignore it, to shut it out, and she was probably less\nmolested because she was blond and curly-haired at times. I had dark hair. I was older. It did\nnot seem to bother her, or maybe she was so much younger that she did not get the impact\nfrom the beginning. She grew into it. When she started school in \u201935, this is the way it was. It\nhadn\u2019t just changed overnight.",
        "A: No, I never did. We talked about the teachers. We talked about grades. We did silly things.\nWe would hide things or play tricks on our parents, or when my mother was looking for a\npair of shoes, and one shoe was missing. We shared a room. The two beds were divided. In\nthe middle was a big wardrobe. We had dolls and dolls\u2019 carriages, and we played like normal\nchildren in a home. She had her friends. I had mine. But as we grew older, there was less\ninteraction.",
        "A: I was dreaming a great deal. When my parents would go in the evening to a concert or to the\ntheater, to the opera, and the maid would stay with us, they normally took a streetcar or tax1. I\nwould not sleep until they got home, and it was sometimes one o\u2019clock in the morning. I\ncouldn\u2019t. It was just fear \u2014 fear of something that I could not verbalize. I thought maybe the\nstreetcar would crash, or the taxi would have an accident. There was no coherent explanation\nof why this terrible fear.",
        "A: Yes, I was a very poor eater, and the school doctor recommended that I go for summer\nvacation to a children\u2019s home so I could recuperate a little bit, and my father had to convince\nthem that we went on vacation every year, and it was, you know, there was no shortage of\nfood, and they didn\u2019t have to worry. And I never did go. I would not go away from home\nalone.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think at that point, not at that point, probably later, but not at that point. The\nchange that I remember took place in 1938.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yes, when my father was taken to Poland, and then, of course, when I walked to school on\nNovember 10\", after the Night of the Broken Glass, and I saw the synagogues burning. I saw\nthe stores vandalized, and we turned around and went back home. That\u2019s when it really\nbecame clear to me that this was not a place to stay or to live, but since I had no influence,\nthere was nothing I could do.",
        "A: Yes, right. I could have gone on a children\u2019s boat to England, but I would not go alone, not\nwithout -",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Then or now?",
        "A: My nightmares then were of accidents, of vehicles crashing, of streetcars derailing, of trains\ncatching fire, because they had old-fashioned locomotives, of catastrophes. I was worried in a\nthunderstorm. I was petrified of lightening and these were the nightmares.",
        "A: Right, right, I was there.",
        "A: I know that I talked in my dreams and I know that I screamed in my dreams, and I know I\nwoke.",
        "A: In 1937, my father voluntarily closed the business. I assumed the reasons to be because we\nwere Jewish, but it really wasn\u2019t the main reason. The main reason was that he didn\u2019t need\nthe business. There was enough money. There was enough income. There was sufficient real\nestate. So, why bother?",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: And he just voluntarily liquated in \u201937, and his brother in Palestine, who left from Berlin in\n\u00b034, asked that we come, and they said, \u201cNo, we are not coming.\u201d And the letter that my\nfather wrote to my uncle, which was lost but I know of the letter, was if he can eat doves in\nthis country, why should we come with a Bunsen burner to Palestine? So, that was never a\nconsideration of leaving the country.",
        "A: Yes, because my classmates left, and it was an adventure. I did not know what it meant to go\nto Palestine, or to the USA. It was a change. It was an adventure. Everybody was doing it.\nWhy shouldn\u2019t I do it?",
        "A: I said, \u201cWhy can\u2019t we leave? Everybody else is leaving.\u201d And they said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, don\u2019t\nworry. It\u2019ll be \u2014 itll be okay.\u201d",
        "A: Towards the end of \u201937, we lived in a condominium, and the whole complex \u2014 and the street\nis still standing \u2014 made it clear that the six or seven Jewish families who occupied I would\nsay a total of probably a hundred condominiums, they were no longer desired, and would we\nplease sell our interest and move. And we moved to another apartment that was owned by a\nJewish attorney in a not-so-nice area, but acceptable area, and all I remember of that\napartment 1s that it had a tiny little orthodox synagogue in the backyard. We never went\nthere, but there was one, probably a hundred members at the most. The other thing I\nremember is that on November 10\" or 11\", we had a knock on the door at four in the\nmorning, and there was my mother\u2019s brother and his son and his wife, and they had spent the\nnight in a train from Cottbus to come to Hamburg to escape the arrest of all males which took\nplace on the 10\" of November. So, they were hiding out in that apartment for a couple of\nweeks.",
        "A: My father was already in Poland.",
        "A: Yes. It was religious because both my families came from an orthodox home. All the laws\nwere observed. There were some rabbis in the family on my mother\u2019s side. My grandmother\nwore a wig, and I found that very amusing because she would lift it like you lift a cover on a\npot of potatoes, and then she\u2019d put it back. And \u2014 but when my parents came to Germany,\nthey somewhat \u2014 they became somewhat more liberal. The congregation they belonged to we\nwould call today \u201cconservative\u201d rather than \u201corthodox\u201d. The home had separate dishes.\nKashrut was observed, but I would say looking back probably not a hundred percent, only 80\npercent, but as far as school was concerned, it was very orthodox. So, they tried not to upset\nme with giving me two sets of values \u2014 the more liberal value at home and the orthodox\nvalue at school, but yes, it was a religious household.",
        "A: I never questioned it. It was customary.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The Polish Consul in Hamburg was supplied \u2014 was supposed to supply a stamp or a\nvalidation on all Polish passports, those of Jews and non-Jews, except there happened to be\nno non-Jews. But, for some reason, he refused. Whether the reasons were anti-Semitic or not,\nhe refused, and I only know of one or two cases where bribery worked, which was very\nunusual. The moment he refused to validate the passports, the Germans said, \u201cYou\u2019re no\nlonger a valid foreign national living on German ground.\u201d At five-of-one in the morning,\nthey rounded up \u2014 they came to our door. They rang the bell, and it was local police. And\nthey said, \u201cYou have to come with me because of the matter of the stamps, and we take you\nto a schoolyard downtown.\u201d And my father said, \u201cMy wife just had surgery three months\nago. Can she stay with the children?\u201d And my sister and I stood in the hallway and listened,\nand since he was a local policeman, he said, \u201cAll right. You come with me, and I let the\nfamily stay.\u201d By afternoon, we heard by phone that this was done throughout the city, and\nthey had rounded up several thousand people, or maybe in Hamburg alone it was not quite as\nmuch, and that they were held in a schoolyard, and somebody suggested that we bring my\nfather a suitcase with some clothing. But they also said for my mother not to go because they\nwould keep her. She packed a suitcase and I insisted to take it down. It was heavy. I took\npublic transportation. I took the subway \u2014 the underground and the above-ground, and I\ndragged that suitcase all the way down to the schoolyard. The gate was open and I started\nlooking for my father, but there were a great many people \u2014 men, women and children, and\nhe found me. I gave him the suitcase, and I remember distinctly saying to him, \u201cCome home\nwith me. The gate is open. There is no guard. There are no people. Just come home and we\u2019ll\nhide, or something.\u201d And my father looked at me and he said, \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be the\nhonorable thing to do.\u201d I did not understand what he meant, but my father played by the\nrules. When the law was published that you were not allowed to have foreign currency or to\nhave currency in a foreign country, my father took the money that was in Holland and\nbrought it back to Germany. So, you played by the rules, which I learned many years later\nthat you don\u2019t have to. He could have just walked out. Nobody would have said a thing, and\nsome people did, but very few. He was pushed over the border. The Poles pushed back, and\nthe Germans pushed him in. They got to Zbaszyn, from Zbaszyn he went to Posen. He stayed\nthere two months. He tried to come back to Germany. He couldn\u2019t get an entry visa, and he\nwent to Sambor, to mother\u2019s family, and he stayed there until May 1940, no 1939, excuse\nme, when he got permission to come back for four weeks. In the meantime, my mother\ndecided to liquidate the household and to ship all that was contained in an eight-room\napartment in huge containers to Palestine, to my father\u2019s brother. She handled the shipping.\nShe handled the packing. She handled the Gestapo who came to watch, and tried to approve\nevery single item that went out of the country. She put a bottle of wine and two glasses on the\ntable, and she refilled it with two or three more bottles, and they drank a great deal and we\npacked fast.",
        "A: The two Gestapo.",
        "A: No, no, no. She just talked to the packers, \u201cHurry up, pack.\u201d We did not take anything of any\nparticular value, just the furniture, clothing, linens and silverware, jewelry \u2014 whatever we\nnormally had in the apartment, but the faster the better. The two crates were packed. They\nwere picked-up, and they were shipped to Trieste. We, in the meantime, had to give up under\nnew German laws the apartment and we were assigned to a room on Werder Street Five. In\nthe meantime, my father was granted permission and he came back. I think the permission\npartly was through the intervention of my mother who hounded the Gestapo in the Staathaus\nin Hamburg. She wrote. She went in. She talked to them. They threatened with arrest. She\ndidn\u2019t give up. I never thought that a quiet, reserved woman would do what she did, and it\nabsolutely amazed me. When my father came back, we started to work on an affidavit for the\nUnited States, and it certificate for Palestine. The four weeks ran out. My mother got an\nextension for another four weeks, and another four weeks, and one morning, on September\n1S, the doorbell rang at five in the morning, six in the morning, and two men appeared with\nhats and long, black leather coats, and 1t was September. It was warm. And they asked for my\nfather, and they said that Germany is at war with Poland. We have invaded Poland. You are\nan enemy alien, and you have to come with us. And that was the first day of the Second\nWorld War. He was first sent to a prison in Fuhlsbuttel, which later became a concentration\ncamp, and we were still allowed to bring every week a briefcase with laundry and take home\na briefcase with dirty laundry for about two or three weeks, but Poland lost the war for all\nintents and purposes within two weeks. They had pockets of resistance, but not of war, and\nthe moment that became a fact, my father was transported to Berlin to Oranienburg, to\nSachsenhausen, and the mail stopped coming. It was sort of an aerogram with one sentence:\n\u201cT\u2019m fine. I hope you are fine. Love, Ben.\u201d These letters became less and less frequent, until\none arrived from Dachau. We had never heard of the place. My mother made, I would say,\ntwice monthly trips to the Gestapo in Hamburg, in the Stathaus, pleading for release, trying\nto work for an exit visa, trying to work towards immigration papers, anyplace, writing a letter\nevery week to the head of the Gestapo. The end result was that they brought my father to\nGestapo headquarters for an hour\u2019s visit. He had on a grey and blue striped prison uniform\nand matching cap. We were sitting on opposite sides of the table, no touching. We talked but\nnobody could talk. My mother assured him she would try. It was a Catch-22. To go to\nShanghai, you had to have 400 American dollars, but you weren\u2019t allowed to have American\ncurrencies, and we had nobody who would give it to us. Our accounts had been blocked. Our\nmoney had been confiscated. We got a hundred dollars a month allowance to live on, no\nmore. We had to move to the apartment next door, number seven. I still went to school. My\nsister still went to school. We went to the Jewish Community Council, who was headed at\nthat time by a Doctor Plaut (ph). Doctor Plaut at that time was a man in his early 50s. He was\nunmarried. You had to wait for an audience, like you wait for the pope. We pleaded for\npapers because it was an emergency because somebody was sitting in a concentration camp,\nand he shrugged his shoulders and he said there was nothing he could do, but he became very\nwell known for the fact that you could buy favors, but that was 1939, 1940. We heard\nrumors. He married a very much younger woman with two young children, and he remained,\nas I\u2019m told, in Germany and was exchanged for a German I believe in Yugoslavia, pretty\nmuch into the war \u201943-\u201944. He ended up in Palestine. My father remained in Dachau and one\nman was released, and he had papers, first for Italy and then for Palestine, and my mother\nand I went to see him one evening after curfew, and we saw this six foot tall man who was a\nskeleton \u2014 no front teeth, shaven head \u2014 and when my mother asked him, \u201cHow is Benno?\u201d\nHe said, \u201cFine.\u201d He managed to leave Germany with his wife and two children, and he\npromised to help once he would be outside. Going back to \u201939, when my father returned from\nPoland, he talked to the Italian Consul and they were on friendly terms, and he offered my\nfather a three-day visa to Italy, and my father said, \u201cAnd what do I do after the three days?\u201d\nAnd being Italian the man said, \u201cGo, and worry later.\u201d My father wouldn\u2019t go. He was\nmurdered in Dachau in February 1941. The Gestapo did something that the very rarely did.\nThey brought us a cigar boxes with ashes. Whose ashes? We will never know.",
        "A: I opened the door.",
        "A: And, they said, \u201cMrs. Landau?\u201d And I took them to the kitchen, and they threw the box on\nthe table, and they said, \u201cAshes, Benjamin Landau.\u201d And my mother screamed, and\nsomething on the stove was burning, and they left, and that was February \u201941. I went to\nschool in the daytime. I did homework, sewing at night because we needed the money\ndesperately, and we had to move to another furnished room.",
        "A: Nothing. I stood frozen.",
        "A: I just \u2014I couldn\u2019t comprehend. First of all, I didn\u2019t know what cremation was. I had never\nbeen to a cemetery. I didn\u2019t know what ashes meant at this point. It was a concept that was\nnot within the Jewish religion. So, 1t took minutes or \u2014 I don\u2019t know how long it took to\nreally comprehend what it was. Somebody called the chief rabbi, which was Josef Carlebach,\nand it was an orthodox burial although it was not in accordance with law. And we never\nfound out whether those are really his ashes. The body \u2014 the ashes were buried in the Jewish\ncemetery in Hamburg, and we managed to save some money and give it to a non-Jewish\nbusiness acquaintance to set a stone, and the stone still stands. We lived in this apartment\nuntil Fall \u201941, when we received notification for resettlement, and all it said was \u201cEast\u201d\nnothing else.",
        "A: It was actually a big suitcase.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t think. I knew I had to deliver it, one way or another, and I just \u2014 I couldn\u2019t carry it,\neither. I dragged it, and luggage didn\u2019t have wheels in those days. No, I wasn\u2019t \u2014 I was\nprobably apprehensive, but not frightened. I knew I had to take it someplace, and that was all\nthat mattered.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, I cried.",
        "A: I cried.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Well, he pushed me towards the gate. He turned me around and said, \u201cPlease go.\u201d And I\nwent.",
        "A: I tried not to.",
        "A: It was too much to walk. I took the subway again.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: Well, she felt driven. She felt if she didn\u2019t do 1t, who would do it? And she believed truly that\nshe could get my father released.",
        "A: I think that night we \u2014 my sister and I \u2014 slept in the big bed in my parents\u2019 bedroom.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Very hard.",
        "A: There was nothing. There was nothing to say or nothing to do.",
        "A: No, because everybody stayed at home by the phone hoping. So, nobody came over, but the\nphone lines went back and forth, \u201cHave you heard?\u201d \u201cWhat do you know?\u201d \u201cWill we get the\nstamp in the passport?\u201d \u201cWill they let them come back next week?\u201d It was conjecture,\nnobody really knew.",
        "A: No, they didn\u2019t get around to that yet. That only happened after the 1\u201c' of September when\nPoland was invaded. Until that time, we had free access to bank accounts, to anything within\nGermany.",
        "A: No, it was unthinkable.",
        "A: It was unthinkable. I know sufficient people moved it to Switzerland or to Holland or \u2014 no, it\njust was illegal, and you didn\u2019t do things illegal.",
        "A: No, it did not, because he was treated for the first two weeks under the Geneva Conventions\nas an enemy alien, and believing, or having learned about the Geneva Conventions, I mean,\nafter all it couldn\u2019t be bad. You could bring laundry once a week, and pick up laundry once a\nweek, and do the same over again. And I don\u2019t think we even contemplated the end of the\nwar or Poland losing the war. I think we naively anticipated a settlement, international\nintervention, or something of that sort.",
        "A: Yes. Once they shipped him to Sachsenhausen, Oranienburg, and Dachau, then we began to\nrealize that there is a concentration camp.",
        "A: My mother did. I did not.",
        "A: She talked about it.",
        "A: No, because there were other men taken at the same time, I either knew their sons or their\ndaughters, and several of them perished or were murdered, and I did not believe that there\nwas escaping Dachau.",
        "A: Blocked.",
        "A: Out of our account administered by the Deutsche Bank.",
        "A: And by the Gestapo, under supervision of the Gestapo.",
        "A: Very hard.\nEnd of Tape 1\nTape 2",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, because our neighbor next door had a typewriter, Mr. Berman, and he would write the\nweekly letters to the Gestapo to release my father.",
        "A: Well, she would tell him what to write, and she would sign them and either deliver them or\nmail them week after week.",
        "A: A little bit. Not entirely to what it was before. She was very reassuring that the certificate\nfrom Palestine would come. She was very supportive. But any initiation, any discussion, any\nplans were made by my father, and she agreed.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: He lost a lot of weight. He was always slim, but not gaunt, and he was gray. His skin was\ngray and gaunt.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, but we still believed there was a chance to get him released.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. The building where we saw him still stands. And when I come to the corner, I\ncross the street. I just don\u2019t want to walk past it.",
        "A: The funeral was small because there were few people left. It was like all the orthodox\nfunerals. It was a plain, pine coffin. The rabbi cut the lapels of the coat, and I really don\u2019t\nremember much. It was an open grave. There was a seven-day shiva.",
        "A: Oh, yes. There was really nothing to say because there were so few Jews left or so few Jews\nwilling to come out to the cemetery. There was a minion. There were some visitors to the\nhouse during the week. It didn\u2019t seem real. It seemed like you had seen a film, but it really\ndidn\u2019t happen.",
        "A: Yes, she was very withdrawn, very quiet, very disinterested in the daily routine. We had to\nshop in special stores, food stores. The food coupons had a \u201cJ\u201d on them. The rations were, of\ncourse, smaller. And she, in a way, sent me out to do the errands.",
        "A: Yes, I did.",
        "A: Yes, I understood it to the extent that I went to the largest department store who, before the\n9'\" of November was Jewish but no longer, and I said I could sew. Could they give me\ndresses to sew at night? And they said, \u201cYes.\u201d And they gave me the design \u2014 a plain shirt\ntop with a pleated skirt. And I was sewing at night after school. I was sewing on Saturdays,\nand my mother didn\u2019t say a word that you don\u2019t sew on Saturdays. And I got paid once a\nweek in a little brown envelope, and after six weeks the lady in charge said, \u201cThe skirts are\ncrooked and the sleeves are backwards and the collar doesn\u2019t close. I\u2019m sorry. We can\u2019t use\nyou.\u201d I mean, I was \u2014 I had taken a course in school, but I was not a seamstress. I was 16\nyears old.",
        "A: I was trying.",
        "A: Yes, I was heartbroken. I was later on told by a lady that I should have tried in the infants\ndepartment. It would have been so much easier, but that of course had never dawned on me,\nand by then you couldn\u2019t get jobs for anything.",
        "A: She understood, but on a different level. She also came with Scarlet Fever during that time,\nand she had to be put into a public hospital behind a fence. We could talk to her through the\nfence, but it was highly contagious. In those days, there was no medication. And after six\nweeks she came back home. She understood that he was gone, but she didn\u2019t understand for\nhow long, or why, or how permanent it would be. That came later.",
        "A: No, she didn\u2019t ask because she was at the funeral.",
        "A: She knew on some level that there was a grave and there was something in the grave. She did\nnot understand about the ashes. Why would a human being become ashes? That did not make\nsense at all, and I couldn\u2019t explain it. I just couldn\u2019t.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: That\u2019s Hallakik (ph) Law, yes. I mean, cremation 1s not Jewish. You don\u2019t do it. And they\ndid not know how to handle it because I don\u2019t think the rabbi, who was probably in his 60s,\nhad ever had any experience. He was a very learned man, and he made the decision and he\nsaid he would defend it and if necessary, and the box, the way we received it with a\nrubber band, was put into the coffin.",
        "A: That was February 1941.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: But I\u2019m going to school.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Withdrawn, quiet, resigned probably is the proper word for it. She still talked to people. We\nstill occasionally saw an old family friend, but there was no \u2014 no joy. There was no laughter.\nThere was no \u2014 there was no plan for any kind of a future.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Quiet.",
        "A: Yes, I still had friends. There was still a youth organization. There was still a so-called\n\u201cHouse of Culture\u201d for Jews, and there were films; sometimes there were ping- pong games.\nI belonged to Bar Kochba. There were even dance classes. And I went dancing with the son\nof Rabbi Callabah (sp) who was a Hassidic Jew in New York.",
        "A: But he used to dance, when we were 13.",
        "A: No, they were a relief, and there were moments when you just lived that moment. You did\nnot think about it, but when you went to them, you felt guilty, and yet the following week,\nyou went back again. You probably \u2014 I probably knew that this was not the thing to do, but I\ndid it. There were light moments. They were cheering when Bar Kochba won the ping-pong\ngame. I remember my old fashioned record player the Andrew Sisters. I remember some\nAmerican jazz, which was not permitted, but for five dollars you could have a copy made on\na wax platter. So, we learned to dance swing, which was the latest rage. There were even\nfashion trends. The boys would wear trench coats and those sloppy hats with the wide brim.\nThe girls would wear pleated skirts and thick rubber soles, white or beige rubber soles. That\nwas the style. Stockings were no longer available so you painted your legs and you put a\nblack line on the back. Silk stockings were unobtainable. And if you had a pair, you had them\nforever repaired. Clothing coupons Jews did not get. If there was clothing available in the\nstore, we couldn\u2019t buy it. The children or the young people did not mind. It wasn\u2019t that\nimportant. What was important was to be with other young people.",
        "A: She didn\u2019t say anything, but they \u2014 I had the impression that she felt that it showed\ndisrespect.",
        "A: To the year of mourning for my father.",
        "A: She did not say so. She did request that we observe the first 30 days, and after that she did\nnot say anything.",
        "A: We talked about those people that had good chances of leaving \u2014 how, when, where, by what\nmeans. Do you take a boat to Shanghai or do you take the overland railroad? We talked about\nPalestine. We talked about the small groups that were smuggled into Yugoslavia and that\nmade it as far as the Mediterranean and then swam into Haifa, and they were put in Turkey\nprison. We knew of course that England was heavily involved in the war. We were being\nbombed during that time. We had to go into air raid shelters, and Jews had to be in one\ncorner. Not that there were many. But I think we were fairly aware of the fact that England\ncouldn\u2019t possibly win the war. It was too small a country, too far away, and there was no\nmore Czechoslovakia. There was no more Austria. There was no more Poland. Holland was\noverrun. We did not see any hope. There was talk of Madagascar, of settling us in\nMadagascar, and then it turned out it was a joke.",
        "A: Yes. I remember my mother going to Berlin when Molotov was in Berlin and signed the\nagreement with Hitler. The reason for my mother going was that the city of Sombor became\nRussia. It was the first town on the Russian border. And she thought that by going to Berlin\nmaybe she could get a temporary passport, or maybe there would be a possibility to go there\n\u2014all sorts of unreal schemes, but you tried anything. And I remember the visit to Berlin.",
        "A: I went along and we had to stay with a girlfriend of an old acquaintance of the family\nbecause you couldn\u2019t stay in a hotel.",
        "A: No, you went by rail. It took four hours. We went third class because a) we didn\u2019t have the\nmoney, and b) you\u2019re less conspicuous. I remember when we used to travel to Poland, we\ntraveled first class and the upholstery was red plush and it itched when you sat on it, and at\nnight the porter would make our beds. So, the Berlin trip was quite different.",
        "A: There was a radio in the apartment and a telephone, and I think the radio and the telephone\nbelonged to Mr. Berman because he had privileges by reason of an intermarriage, and two\nsons \u2014 I think they even were on the Wehrmacht, if I\u2019m not mistaken, later in the war, and so\nhe had the privilege of radio, but it was not a short wave. It was just local stations. And I\nthink he had a telephone.",
        "A: Yes, many times.",
        "A: I even saw him once.",
        "A: We went downtown, and that was in the mid \u201930s, into the district where all the department\nstores were like a small Fifth Avenue. And all of a sudden, the SS and the SR were pushing\nthe people from the sidewalk facing the street on both sides, and a motorcade appeared, open,\nand Hitler was standing with his right arm raised, looking right, looking left, and everybody\nraised their right arm. And I stood in front of my mother \u2014she was a little bit taller than I \u2014\nand she put her right arm on my head instead of raising it over me. She put it on my head.\nWe were afraid.",
        "A: I just sort of squeezed in between the other young people. I just, nothing. I was petrified. I\nheard him speak many times, or rave, it was not speaking, but that\u2019s the only time I saw him.",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "A: I-I just couldn\u2019t understand this ranting and raving because even to a young person, it made\nso little sense. And then when he talked about race and Jews and the international conspiracy,\nand Jews own all the money and all the banks. I once asked in school, and the man who\ntaught history was Professor Eunice, and I said, \u201c\u201cWhat is the percentage of the Jews living in\nGermany?\u201d And it was less than one percent or something, and I said, \u201cBut we can\u2019t own all\nthat they say that we do own.\u201d It didn\u2019t make sense. I could not comprehend.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I had neighbor kids, upstairs, downstairs, and we would play before \u201933, but that was it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No",
        "A: No, my mother occasionally with a neighbor. My father occasionally over the phone with\nbusiness associate of some sort, but very cautiously, very carefully, and not really detailed.",
        "A: If I went by myself, I could pass. If the SS walked by \u2014 mainly the SR, the brown shirts, I\ncould just sort of blend in, so to speak. If I was walking with somebody else, I was out of\nluck. I mean, it was immediate. I don\u2019t know how the Poles today can tell that I\u2019m a Jew.\nWhen I go today to Poland, they say, \u201cOh, a Jew from America.\u201d How they can tell I don\u2019t\nknow, but the Germans could, too.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: There were notices on the movies, on the park benches. It was in newspapers, \u201cJews are no\nlonger permitted on the street after dark.\u2019 There was a newspaper called Der Stuermer, which\nwas the official organ of the Nazi party, with distorted pictures of Jews. One of them had my\nuncle in it, the one who had the big business in Cottbus. No, the restrictions were publicized\nmainly in newspapers or, for instance, on stores. Early on, \u201cDon\u2019t Buy Here. It\u2019s a Jew.\u201d\nLater on, when they were taken over by non-Jews, it was no longer an issue because the\nnames were changed. We went to a park in winter and people would slide down the hill, and\nthat was no longer permitted, \u201cJews No Entrance.\u201d In summer, in that park on every bench,\n\u201cJews Forbidden.\u201d I don\u2019t think you could hire a taxi as a Jew. It was no longer possible. It\nwas dangerous.",
        "A: We did during day hours, but towards the last year that we lived in Germany, we did not ride\ntogether. We would take the train, but everybody would take a different compartment or a\ndifferent train. Not that two or three people would sit next to each other. I would take the first\ntrain. My mother would take the second train, and we would know where we get out. We\nwent out once after curfew, one time only, and we almost got caught.",
        "A: Yeah. And later on trains were no longer allowed for Jews, and Jews had to turn in cars,\nthose who had cars. The Jews who were German nationals had to hand in their gold and\nsilver after the Kristall Night, to pay for the damages. It was strange going into a store where\nyou had gone all your life to buy some material for a dress, and all of a sudden you felt like\neverybody was looking at you. Or you were afraid they would call the police.",
        "A: We were not supposed to be there.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I regretted that we did not go when we could have gone to Palestine in \u201934. That I regretted.\nBut going away alone, I never regretted. I would have never done it. And while all of the\nchildren \u2014 10,000 of them \u2014 that did go from Austria and Germany survived, except my\ngirlfriend who was hit by a bomb in mid-town London, they came out very bitter and very\nresentful elderly people. There\u2019s now the organization of Kindertransport and they\u2019re very\nangry.",
        "A: They feel there is compensation due them which they never received. They feel they were\nused as maids or taken out of school at age 14, and sent to learn a trade rather than study at a\nuniversity, and they feel that they suffered unjustly and they never received an apology. They\nnever received compensation. It\u2019s a very vocal organization, at least in California. And I can\nfully understand where they come from and why they feel this way, but it is now the year\n2001. They left in \u201939. Most of them lost their parents, not all, but a great many. What are\nthey trying to accomplish with the bitterness and with the publicity?",
        "A: No, the only reason I\u2019m not one of them because I was just fearful of leaving. It had nothing\nto do with that. I was in Washington once for the meeting of Hidden Children, and they are\nvery, very angry, and very bitter, and very \u2014 I would say almost \u2014 for them, it\u2019s almost\nimpossible to cope with these two or three years in which they were hidden in France, or\nBelgium, Poland, wherever. So, there is a lot of damage. It\u2019s a matter of degree. I think we all\nsustained some, more or less, but it\u2019s strange that it took 60 years to surface. There were no\nsocial workers. There was no psychiatric help. There\u2019s help given now, but what good will it\ndo an 80 year old person? Too little, too late.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: It got stuck in the harbor in Trieste until 1945. In 1945, my uncle from Haifa paid the storage\nand had it shipped to Haifa. One of the crates \u2014 well, it was a container, 1t wasn\u2019t a crate \u2014\nwas broken into, and it was the one container that contained my mother\u2019s silver and jewelry.\nWhile they didn\u2019t empty it out, I don\u2019t have one place setting. I\u2019Il have one fork and I\u2019Il have\ntwo spoons, but I won\u2019t have any knives. My uncle received it into \u201945 or \u201946 in Haifa. He\nasked me what he should send me \u2014 oriental rugs or silverware, whatever. I said, \u201cI want the\npictures that were in the crate. And if there\u2019s any jewelry of my mother\u2019s, I would like it, and\neverything else please do whatever you think you want to do with it. I don\u2019t wish to.\u201d",
        "A: No. There was no rumor.",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "A: We assumed they would use us for workers in factories.",
        "A: Yes. Especially the young men.",
        "A: You get used to fear. You get used to looking over your shoulder. You get used to limitations\nsuch as rationed food and living in a small room. You adjust. You accept whatever is given\nyou, but then there was a war, and there was a glimmer of hope that maybe Germany would\nlose the war, even in 741.",
        "A: Yes, we each had a suitcase.",
        "A: Yes\u2014no, it didn\u2019t come in the mail.",
        "A: Some came delivered and some came registered.",
        "A: Gestapo.",
        "A: Yes, I believe somebody delivered it. I don\u2019t know who took the notice because there were\nabout eight families living in that one apartment.",
        "A: And we read the notice, and everybody said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do. Pack what you\ncan. Take three suitcases, and the rest just leave. We\u2019ll give it away or whatever.\u201d There\nwasn\u2019t much.",
        "A: No. No. And we reported.",
        "A: I took a coat. I took some clothing, but there wasn\u2019t much. I took what little I had. And I had\na little small briefcase, and I put some stationary into it, and some addresses, and some letters\nI had received from friends in Palestine, and that I carried with me and everything else was\nchecked. And after two days or a day and a half, then it was called Lodz, and it still stands\nand I was inside in September, and I asked the director, \u201cDo you know what this place was?\u201d\nin 1941, and he knew. There were 1,100 of us \u2014 men, women and children. The Jewish\nCommunity sent some representatives to tell us that it would be okay and not to worry. There\nwere some prominent leaders of the community on that particular list. It was the first\ntransport. We were put into cars, railroad cars, with wooden benches. And after two days,\ntwo and a half days, we arrived in a very sunny, dusty place \u2014 no railroad station, no\npersonnel, nothing.",
        "A: The trip was quiet except for whimpering children. There was more children on there or\nyoung people on that train.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Benches.",
        "A: No, the way \u2014 regular wooden benches \u2014 the way you have them now in an upholstered train.",
        "A: Not that I recall.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I think they had buckets in the hallway, and each compartment had a sliding\ndoor. The windows were locked from the outside. So were the doors, and on the outside were\nGerman soldiers riding along the guns.",
        "A: No, no. We brought little candy, a few pieces of bread. It was a custom in Europe anyway,\nwhen you went on a train, you packed your own food. You never went to the dining car. So,\nwe did take some food, and the lady next to us gave us some candy. And that\u2019s all I\nremember \u2014 I remember about the ride. Nobody really spoke because the uncertainty and the\nbewilderment was still strong that you couldn\u2019t put it into words.",
        "A: Yes, they sat next to us.",
        "A: Next to us on the train. We started to talk, and she asked me, \u201cDo you know the Rosenbergs\nin Hamburg?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, Latti went to school with me. We were good friends.\u201d She said,\n\u201cDid you know her ten year older brother, Howard?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, ve met Howard once, but\nhe didn\u2019t talk to little girls ten years younger.\u201d She said, \u201cOh, my husband was a friend of\nHoward\u2019s.\u201d I said, \u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d",
        "A: That was it.",
        "A: Yes, she had red hair that was turning gray. She was chubby. She had a wonderful smile. She\nhad teeth that had never been corrected that were spaced too far apart. It was said later on\nthat she was called as a young girl \u201cRed Fox\u201d and she supposedly was a beauty. And her\nhusband was small, bald, chubby, and a little bit crumpy (ph) and quiet, but nice.",
        "A: No, much older.",
        "A: My mother was born in \u201992. She must have been born at least six, seven years earlier. Maybe\nten years earlier.",
        "A: Okay, fine.",
        "A: Well, we were ordered to wear the star \u2014 left-hand side, not on the back, just in front, and it\nwas 1941.1 think it was September. And you were very conspicuous, more so than ever,\nwhich was not a happy situation. And we had a neighbor in the apartment in which we lived\nwho was half Jewish. She had some privileges that we did not have, but she was kind. She\nwas quite elderly probably in her late \u201960s, and very plain-looking, almost like a woman from\nthe country, and she didn\u2019t have to wear a star. And since I loved opera since I was about 10\nyears old, she suggested one evening that we go to the Staats Opera in Hamburg, and I told\nher that I could not with my star. I was not permitted. And she said, \u201cJust take it off. You go\nwith me, and we stand in the last row, standing room only, and nobody will know the\ndifference.\u201d It didn\u2019t make a difference. We enjoyed the opera, but I really worried a great\ndeal.",
        "A: It was a German opera. I think it could have been the Freischutz by Karl Maria Von Weber,\nbut I wouldn\u2019t swear to it.",
        "A: Yes, my parents took my first to the easy ones \u2014 Magic Flute, La Boheme \u2014 the French and\nthe Italians. And since I played music, it \u2014 I was not fond of a concert, but I loved opera.",
        "A: Yes, and I still do.",
        "A: Because when I grew up, a lot of the concerts were composers that I was not too fond of, and\nI preferred chamber music. It\u2019s more intimate. You get more out of the music. I like baroque\nmusic. I recently listened to Malas (ph) Symphony, and I enjoyed it, but it was \u2014 it was hard\nwork to listen.",
        "A: I grew up with it. I grew up with it. Both my kids play woodwinds, or used to play\nwoodwinds, baroque flute, piccolo, clarinet. So, chamber music was very much taken for\ngranted. My husband loved chamber music. He loved Telemann, and I never asked why or\nhow come, it just was natural.",
        "A: No. I gave it up with the deportation to Poland.",
        "A: And I never touched another-",
        "A: Another instrument, no. I would never go back to it.",
        "A: Well, first of all, I had to give up the instrument itself, which was not a Stradivarius, but it\nwas a good instrument. And something about the orchestra \u2014 two of my friends played in it in\nAuschwitz \u2014 made me decide not to go back to it. I also would never buy a pair of boots.\nBoots became very fashionable a few years ago. I can\u2019t buy a pair of boots, but that\u2019s another\nStory.",
        "A: All right.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I saw the German soldiers lined up. The railroad cars were opened. We were ordered to come\nout. We were ordered to line up in rows of five, and we saw a whole group of men in black\njackets, black trouser, a black hat with an orange band, an orange arm band with the Star of\nDavid, and on their jackets were also yellow stars. The Germans handed us over to these\nmen. The name given to them was \u201cghetto police\u201d. The ground was sandy. It was dirty. It\nwas not a railroad station. We saw a wagon drawn by two horses and our suitcases were\nthrown on that wagon. The Germans went back into the trains, and the ghetto police\nexplained to us \u2014 mostly in Polish, and hardly anybody spoke Polish \u2014 that we had to walk\ninto the ghetto. My mother, who stood next to me, asked the first available policeman in\nPolish, \u201c\u201cWhere are we? What is the ghetto? What\u2019s going on?\u201d And on the hour and a half or\ntwo-hour walk, and it was very warm and there were many elderly people, he explained to\nmy mother that it was the city of Lodz, which was familiar to her. It was the ghetto, which\nwas an area that was totally enclosed. And as we kept on walking, we saw people that didn\u2019t\nlook at us. They looked ragged. They looked tired. They looked ill-fed and ill-dressed. And\nwe saw buildings that were dilapidated. Some were \u2014 some streets were paved; others were\nnot. We saw no vehicles. We saw no automobiles. We saw no trucks. But he explained to my\nmother, and she translated, that the ghetto was an area that was fenced in and guarded by\nGermans. There was no into the ghetto; there was no out of the ghetto. And my mother made\na very flippant remark, \u201cWell, if you want to get out of this situation, you always can.\u201d And\nhe said, \u201cHardly.\u201d They walked us to a school on Mlynarska Street. This school evidently\nhad been abandoned, and they housed all 1,100 of us on two, possibly three, stories in what\nused to be classrooms, lecture rooms. We eventually got our suitcases. We put our coats or\nwhoever had a blanket on the floor, and that\u2019s how we lived for six weeks. The Jewish ghetto\nadministration sent in a kitchen detail once a day to bring soup. This soup was mainly water,\nvery little else. In the mornings, we received sometimes a slice of bread and a liquid that was\nbitter tasting and supposed to look like coffee, but it had a grainy substance. It had no coffee.\nAnd at that point, most of us still had some money, which we had brought from Germany.\nSome of it sewn into shoulder pads, into belts, into shoes. And those of us who had some\nmoney \u2014 some more, others less \u2014 you could go into the courtyard and the people who had\nlived in the ghetto since 1940 when it was first closed would sell out of newspaper a little\npiece of bread, a chunk of margarine, anything edible, and we would buy it with this German\nmoney, not realizing that the currency in the ghetto was not German money. It was special\nghetto-printed money similar to Monopoly money, and that we were by far overpaying.\nWhen we ran out of the money, we would sell some of our so-called \u201cwestern\u201d belongings \u2014\na silk blouse, a silk scarf, an alligator purse \u2014 whatever any family had brought along and it\nwas deemed no longer necessary, superfluous, and it brought in some food. These things\nwere not sold for money. They were bartered for food. I remember seeing my mother in the\ncourtyard bartering for bread and margarine against a silk blouse.",
        "A: Oh, I would say maybe 200 grams \u2014 a small piece of bread. The ghetto bread was about \u2014 it\nwas a round loaf of bread. It had to last at that point a week, and we cut it into seven or eight\nwedges once we got our permanent food rations. And I took my mother\u2019s example, and I had\na purse. And when she did not realize it, I did the same thing. I traded the purse for some\nbread. It was traded to a young woman a little older than I was, who came with a very good-\nlooking gentleman probably ten years older who had a briefcase, and he wanted to give me\none piece of bread and I said, \u201cIt\u2019s too little.\u201d And they laughed. They didn\u2019t speak German\nand I didn\u2019t speak Polish, but we managed. And I stood there for two hours and eventually\nthey came back and I got two pieces of bread. But even that had limitation because you ran\nout of tradable goods. Nobody had jewelry. That had to be left for the Germans. And what\nwas left was really the bare essentials, not more than that. After six weeks, we were assigned\nto various rooms.",
        "A: There was a pump in the courtyard, and if you knew somebody with either a bowl or a\nbucket, you would borrow it. In the beginning, we had some soap, but you use up soap and\nthen you make do without soap. This school had outhouses in the backyard. The outhouses\nwere used by 1,100 people. They were filthy. They were unsanitary. People got sick. There\nwere accidents. You washed and we used to call it a cat\u2019s wash because you really couldn\u2019t\nwash. There was no privacy. There was no place. There was no room. I remember standing in\na corner holding up a blanket. My mother was behind the blanket washing and vice versa. So,\nsanitary conditions didn\u2019t exist. At night, we slept on the floor. In the daytime, we sat on the\nfloor. Crowded, one body next to the other. And eventually, six weeks later, we were\nassigned to various rooms throughout the ghetto on both sides of the bridges. The older part\nof the ghetto was the Balut, the former slum of the city. It used to house Jews and non-Jews,\nbut had been vacated for Jews only. We were fortunate enough to be settled in the little\nnewer section on the front side of the bridge. We shared a probably 10 by 10 foot room with\nfour other people. We had two or three wooden cots. My mother brought a little wardrobe so\nwe didn\u2019t have to hang the clothing on the damp walls. The view out of the window was a\nbarbed wire and the red century house with a German marching up and down. So, we did not\ngo near the window. At night, you had to put a black sheet over the window so no light could\ncome out because it was wartime. And the room had a little cast iron stove, but there was no\nlumber. We slowly took out of the wooden cots one board at a time, cut it up for heat and for\ncooking. We were issued ration cards, and the food distribution centers were throughout the\nghettos. The intervals of the spaces between them were several kilometers. When a food\nration was announced or posted on the walls, it gave a date when it would be available, and\nhow much, and what items. You had to bring your own containers, and during the first week,\nyou stood in line for about three hours until you got your food. If you waited beyond that,\nthere were no more lines but sometimes the food ran out.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: This was a little bit of brown sugar at a time, a little bit of what they called ground coffee, a\nloaf of bread for a certain period of time, sometimes there was flour. Once I got horsemeat,\nbut only once. And it was not really enough to sustain a human being. And the conversation\nwherever you went centered around food. The houses had no running water. You had to carry\na bucket up and a bucket down with dirty water. There were no bathrooms. The toilets were\nouthouses in the backyard. There were no showers. There were no bathtubs. There was no\ntransportation within the ghetto to get from one place to another. There was an internal police\nforce. There was a fire brigade. I don\u2019t think it was ever used, and aside from the police force\nthere was a Sonder force, that meant special police with special orders, with more difficult\ntasks which larger, with larger food allotments, and some of these men were decent, and\nsome were brutal.\nEnd of Tape 2\nTape 3",
        "A: None of my friends or acquaintances had running water. I had one friend that I did not know\nuntil after the war who lived in the parsonage of a church and there was running water, but\nnobody knew. There were houses out in Marysin, where Rumkowski lived, they had running\nwater. It was the slum of a city. Running water was not the customary thing to have. The city\nalso didn\u2019t have a sewer system. The sewage ran between the street and the sidewalk, raw\nsewage, and you jumped over it as you crossed the street. There was no underground\ncanalization like for instance in Warsaw or in Paris or in Rome. It didn\u2019t exist.",
        "A: So, was the typhus \u2014 the stench, the typhus, the summers, the snow and frost in the winter,\nand people just dumped their buckets and it didn\u2019t matter. It \u2014 you had ceased to care, to\nobserve sanitary conditions or laws. There was really no way one could solve this problem. It\nwas \u2014 it was not solvable.",
        "A: Nope. It was a shock, and yet we believed, in the first six weeks, that once we get housing,\nonce we get a room in a building, be it wood or concrete, conditions would be more\nnormalized. It never really occurred to us that most buildings would not have a bathroom. I\nthought there would be maybe a bathroom on each floor or a shower. The ghetto did have a\nbathhouse, but you needed a coupon to get in. The ghetto had a laundry. Once I had a coupon\nand I bought some sheets, and it took me six months to get them back. They were sort of\nwashed, but six months because the laundry did work for the Germans and for the higher-ups\nwithin the ghetto. So, while some of the civilized amenities were within the ghetto, they were\nfar and in between.",
        "A: It was stressful. People did argue. \u201cThis was my space and why did you take my space?\u201d And\n\u201ctake this away and put this there.\u201d It was community living at its worst. It brought out the\nvery best in very few people. It brought out the worst in most of us. And I don\u2019t think\nanybody was really to blame because to come out of the normal life into conditions of\ndeprivation, of inhumanity, dehumanization \u2014 it\u2019s indescribable.",
        "A: She became very quiet. When we first came into the ghetto, she thought, because she spoke\nPolish, she had lived among Poles, she had lived among Jews in Poland, she was educated in\nLwow, she thought it would be manageable. It would be possibly a little bit the way her life\nhad been before the first World War. But I don\u2019t think she fully expected the hunger, and the\nfilth, and the sickness within the ghetto. That was something that was incomprehensible.",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t harder for her. She just took it more or less in stride. She didn\u2019t quite\nunderstand what this was all about. She once asked about the barbed wires or the soldiers\nwith guns. She remarked once on the lack of a playground. Or she wanted a little roll with\nbutter and there were no rolls in the ghetto. But she did not \u2014 it did not have a full impact on\nher, not at that point.",
        "A: No, nobody.",
        "A: Nobody.",
        "A: There were very few kids. There were mainly elderly people. There were quite a few\nteenagers, but kids eight or 10 far in between.",
        "A: Well, I went throughout the building to see if there was anybody I knew. I met a couple of\nclassmates, schoolmates. I looked at the young people who brought the soup, and laid out the\nportions. And I was guessing or thinking how does one get a job like that, but I had trouble\nwith the language. I could understand some of the Yiddish, and Polish I had probably a dozen\nwords, no more. So, there was no communication. There was no possibility to make any\nconnection.",
        "A: Over a period of time.",
        "A: Not when we came. Later on, there were transports \u2014 several from Berlin, several from\nVienna, five from Prague, one from Frankfurt. I think there were in excess of 20,000 people\nbrought in from what was called \u201cWestern Europe.\u201d At that time, we were told we didn\u2019t\nread it and we didn\u2019t hear it, of a speech made by Rumkowski that 20,000 Jews had been\nbrought in from the West and there was neither enough housing for them, and the Germans\nwould make no allowances for it, and there was not enough food for them. It was considered\na tremendous burden on the already existing ghetto population. And we were very\nunwelcome. We were made fun of. We were the ones from the West, the spoiled ones, the\narrogant ones. And in a way, it was true. The majority of the German Jews especially, not so\nmuch the Czechs, came with the idea, or at least if they didn\u2019t come with it, it started within\nthe ghetto, \u201cWe will teach them how to do things here, and we will change things in the\nghetto. And we will run the ghetto the way we are used to running things in Germany.\u201d And\nthat turned out to be a big mistake.",
        "A: There was a lot of hostility, and you can\u2019t walk into somebody else\u2019s house and turn it\nupside-down. And of course, the Polish Jews would not hold still for 1t, which resulted in the\nfact that there was no employment for us. We were by and large disliked. We were called\nnames, not nasty names, but not flattering names either. You felt almost like an outcast\namong your own people.",
        "A: Yes, but I was used to this situation. I went to a German-Jewish school. And the school had\nabout ten children who had Polish parents. And when this became known, the parents of the\n\u2014 of all those students said, \u201cDon\u2019t play with those Polish Jews.\u201d So, it was Jew against Jew\non the one side. It was the same again now. And that, at that very beginning, something told\nme that you were sitting again between two chairs. If you want to live here in any way and\nget work, you have to learn the language - Yiddish and Polish. And it was hard; there was no\nschool.",
        "A: By listening and by talking. And I made horrible mistakes but people smiled. They thought it\nwas very cute that a 16 year old would at least try. It took me six months and I spoke Polish\ngrammatically incorrect. I didn\u2019t know if two houses were male or female, but it didn\u2019t\nmatter. People found it amusing, and it helped. It gave me a chance at communication.",
        "A: My mother was educated and she spoke Polish, and French, and German.",
        "A: She tried at very first, but nobody would hire in 1941. There was not enough work within the\nghetto to fully employ everybody. Work was not mandatory; it was not considered forced\nlabor. You worked and you received the noontime soup. But you didn\u2019t have to work if you\ndidn\u2019t want to. It afforded you no other privileges.",
        "A: Right, because money was very little and worthless. So, she tried for a while in the felt shoe\nfactory and in the hat factory, but they wouldn\u2019t hire her.",
        "A: If we had enough material to hit the little stove because sometimes you got items that weren\u2019t\neven combinable or cookable, but we would try in the evening. And if you shared a room,\nand you had a corner for your food supplies or a shelf, 1t very often happened that by evening\nsomething had disappeared. Somebody in the room was so hungry, they couldn\u2019t resist. That\nwas very, very common.",
        "A: I think with \u2014 within two months, maybe two and a half months. We were definitely starving\nby the end of the year, before Christmastime.",
        "A: We did drink the water.",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s why we got typhus. It was really not much else to drink because it was difficult to\nheat up water, to bring it to a boil, and to make this so-called coffee that we were distributed.\nI remember one ration and it was four pounds of salt. I remember a ration of a half a pound\nof citric acid. Citric acid thrown into a pot of raw vegetables makes it boil faster, but what are\nyou going to do with that quantity. It was a senseless type of distribution, but the food was\ndistributed the way it came into the ghetto from Germany. There were, we heard, other items,\nbut they were in small supply and they went to the elite of the ghetto administration, not to\nuS.\n[Break in tape]",
        "A: Again, during the first six months there was an outside area where you could buy a rotten\napple or frozen potato, or whatever anybody else would like to sell. You could trade. You\ncould barter, but 1t was pretty senseless. You didn\u2019t gain much by it. And the market\neventually just closed down for lack of interest and for lack of supplies.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, starvation takes a strange form. Your body swells. Your legs and your feet become\ndouble its normal size. It is difficult to walk. You can\u2019t get into a pair of shoes. Those are the\nfirst signs of starvation. It does ultimately affect you in other ways, as well. It is just that the\nbody responds to lack of nourishment.",
        "A: This was happening to her and thousands of others.",
        "A: The only thing that I could try is sell whatever of my clothing I did not need or I did not\nwant. And that I gradually sold for food, but I didn\u2019t have much clothing to start out with,\nand I only had two pair of shoes in not very good condition. Shoes would have brought a lot\nof money. The stockings were in such disrepair that the repairs on the back of the heel\nreached halfway up to the knee. We kept repairing it with thread because you couldn\u2019t buy\nnew ones. But you could buy a lipstick.",
        "A: The ghetto had a little cosmetic store half a block from Balutaring. And I guess the lady must\nhave had a cosmetic store before the war, and you could go and buy powder or lipstick, and\non the corner was a hairdresser and you could get a permanent if you had the right currency\nor enough food.",
        "A: Ido not how much rent they paid. I don\u2019t know who owned the building. It was a little shack.\nThere was demand. The ladies or women who were in fact within the ghetto were well-\ndressed. They wore hats. They wore decent boots or shoes, and they wore cosmetics. The\nghetto had several tiny little holes in the wall and you could get a manicure for one Mark.\nBut you had to have the Mark.",
        "A: I did it once.",
        "A: Yes. I once had a Mark. I just wanted to now what it was like.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I think \u2014 I thought it was totally superfluous. It was ridiculous, but I liked to see people with\nthat bright red nail polish, which I\u2019ve never worn since. And it was very fashionable because\nwomen, Jewish women in L\u00e9dz, were very elegant, emancipated, very Western, very anti-\nreligious customs, and quite different from what I had expected.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: But, then, I also was older than \u2014 than I observed the same circumstances as a child. So, I\nwas more aware.",
        "A: My mother had a lipstick that she had bought in Paris during the World\u2019s Fair. I think it was\n\u00b036 or something like that, and I used that lipstick.",
        "A: Later on, not right away, later on as I got older.",
        "A: Before the war, she used lipstick but then she rubbed it off so it wouldn\u2019t be so obvious. She\nhad her hair done once a week.",
        "A: Yes, and she used powder and other cosmetics, but it was of no interest to me.",
        "A: We did at first, and then one evening we had knock at the door. It must have been around\nJanuary. And in walked a short little man by the name of Adolf Goetz, and he had lived\naround the corner from us in Hamburg on Holle Street. We lived on Braumsen Way (ph). We\ndidn\u2019t know him but we\u2019d wave from the back window. He had a short little wife with very\ncurly hair and she used to shake out her rugs off the balcony. And he came in with another\nman and he used to be a dentist in Hamburg. I think it was Rosenblum. And he had\nremembered us and he said to my mother, \u201cI have been given permission to open an office.\nWould you allow your daughter to work in that office?\u201d My mother said, \u201cSure.\u201d \u201cWell, she\ndoesn\u2019t get much money. You know how it is, but she\u2019 Il get a daily soup.\u201d Adolph Goetz had\na terrific sense of humor. He was probably not even five foot tall. He wore glasses, and he\nhad a funny face that you would expect to see in a cartoon, a very pinched little face. He had\nbeen a playwright. He had been an engineer. He had a son in South America some place, and\nhe convinced Rumkowski that the ghetto needed improvement and beautification. And he\nhired probably a dozen architects and engineers that had come from Prague on this so-called\nIntelligenz transport, as they called themselves because everybody had a college degree,\namong them the general director of Schoda (ph), which was Dr. Reich. And they were\nsupposed to draw up blue prints with parks, with schools, with trees, with playgrounds. And I\nwas supposed to do some typing, but I couldn\u2019t type very well, and write the explanations to\nthese blueprints. And every once in a while Adolph Goetz would take the blueprints to\nBalutaring, to Rumkowski, and Rumkowski seemed enthused. And we got the midday soup.\nThe office was on Rybn, 8. And oh, Adolph must have been in his late \u201960s at a guess, and\nfor fun he wrote poems and he wrote stories. And he would make little airplanes out of them,\nand just sort of fly them over the office onto my desk. That went on for several months. I\ndidn\u2019t know what to make it, but it was sort of funny. But he complained bitterly about the\nlack of food, but the office remained for about six months, and then he was summoned by\nRumkowsk1, and he was told, \u201cI\u2019m terminating the office. I\u2019m closing down the office. And\nall of you can look for other jobs.\u201d In the meantime, he had gotten double rations, which of\ncourse I didn\u2019t know. And he was really unhappy for himself and for us, as well. And\neverybody tried to get a job someplace else. Dr. Reich went to work for the lumber\ndepartment for Goodman. Some others found employment some place else, and by then it\nwas July. And my mother died on the 30\" of July 1942 of hunger.",
        "A: No, I was not at home. It happened in the afternoon, and the next day the black little wagon\nwith the white horse came and picked up the dead bodies throughout the ghetto. We did not\nhear. My sister and I walked to the Jewish cemetery in Marysin, about a two-hour walk. And\nin the burial hall, we went through hundreds of bodies. And most bodies were between two\nboards, wooden boards, tied together with a string and a name tag. We found my mother\u2019s\nbody. And we took two shovels. And we looked for a plot and there were no more plots left\non the cemetery. So, we found a walkway, and we spent that July day digging a grave until it\nwas deep enough to bury her. We put a wooden marker on it. We scratched the name with a\nstone on the marker, and we walked back. From that day on, I think, my sister stopped\ntalking.",
        "A: Talking. I couldn\u2019t get through to her. I looked around for a school for her. I couldn\u2019t find a\nschool. But I heard that one of the factories in the back room employed children, but it\nactually was a school. I tried several. And I was asked by the directors of the factories, \u201cIf I\ngive you a place for your sister, what will you give me in return?\u201d And I explained that I had\nno jewelry nor did I have money. And the answer was laughter. I did not comprehend. In the\nend, I did find her a place. I asked her if she enjoyed it, if she learned Polish, if there were\nother children \u2014 she wouldn\u2019t answer. And, I, in the meantime, looked for work. I found\nsome work in the factory sewing ladies\u2019 dresses, but it was a two hour walk to Marysin. And\nI worked at a machine for a while. And the interesting part in that factory was that it\nemployed young people my age, a little older, and they were very intent on striking, on\nasking for more food. One young woman named Fajga made us walk, those willing to walk,\naround the courtyard, \u201cNo food. No work.\u201d It took an hour, and the police \u2014 the Jewish\nghetto police \u2014 came into the courtyard and took her away. She returned the next day a little\nbit black and blue, and she laughed.",
        "A: She laughed. She had a boyfriend and she said, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to give up. We\u2019re going to\norganize for food.\u201d By that time, I got afraid. But there were brave souls who still marched,\n\u201cNo Food, no soup, no work.\u201d \u201cNo food, no work\u201d in Yiddish and Polish, and she was taken\naway a second time. The first time she was warned to cease and desist, not by Rumkowsk1,\nbut by someone who was sent by him. And when she was taken the second time, she didn\u2019t\nreturn for a week. She came back in very bad shape: black and blue, a missing tooth, and she\nno longer demonstrated. By then it was September, and the announcements were of the\nghetto \u2014 No, first Rumkowski made a speech that the Germans had demanded that the old\nand the very young be deported from the ghetto, and he had to comply with German orders.",
        "A: Yes, there was one in May that I had skipped.",
        "A: Yes, and that took out most of the elderly Jews that had come from the West, most of them\nwith very few exceptions. We were on the list. And I took our three Polish passports. And I\nwent from one administration to the other to convince them that we were not German. And\nsomebody in the administration who worked for Neftalin, his name was Kaplan, finally, after\ntwo days agreed to delete our names and we stayed. That was in May before my mother died.",
        "A: We had the instinct \u2014 here we knew of the misery. If you go someplace else, what is going to\nawait us? We had no idea. And I would say by an old Jewish saying, \u201cWhat you have you\nhave. You know, you know your enemy. If you go someplace else, what will you have?\u201d We\ndid not know. So, the instinct \u2014 our instinct was \u2014 I don\u2019t know how other people felt because\nwe had very, very little contact with other Jews that had come from the West except for the\nEichengreens, who really didn\u2019t care. They thought it couldn\u2019t be worse.",
        "A: Right, and \u2014 but, we decided, my mother and I, that it would be better to stay.",
        "A: No, she was not well. It was my doing that we were permitted to stay, because I ran around\nwith these Polish passports speaking German. And people just looked at me. They just\nlaughed. It was a joke. It couldn\u2019t be for real. Somebody who has a nationality can speak the\nlanguage, but in the end, they agreed. We could stay. After my mother died...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: You never forget.",
        "A: Ihave not been back to a funeral for 50 years. And I\u2019ve had friends and relatives die, and I\ncould not go. I could not go to my father\u2019s grave. I couldn\u2019t go in a cemetery. It was not\nfeasible.",
        "A: Yes, with those two boards. How did we do it? I really can\u2019t answer that.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t speak.",
        "A: We just did it.",
        "A: No. It was a hot July, on the 20\" of July, maybe 21\u00b0. We didn\u2019t see a soul. There was no\ncaretaker. There were no gravediggers. There was nobody.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No tears.",
        "A: No, no prayers.",
        "A: And left.",
        "A: I think we did because it was a long walk.",
        "A: We went back to the room.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, there was \u2014 whether you shut out the feelings consciously or whether there just were no\nmore feelings left, I will never know.",
        "A: Not then.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Really physically stopped talking. \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d was about the most I got out of her.",
        "A: I assume not, but I never went to the school because I had to go to work. I assumed she didn\u2019t\ntalk.",
        "A: Right, and then there were other little kids. She wasn\u2019t the only one.",
        "A: Well, I learned in three years in the ghetto, that you pay for sex \u2014 you pay with sex for a\nfavor, but I did not understand it then.",
        "A: Not within the next \u2014 within the following two years.",
        "A: That I learned, but not in 1942. In \u201943 and 44, yes.",
        "A: And the first I heard from a young messenger who delivered messages from the\nadministration. She was a dwarf \u2014 crippled, Jewish, grew up in the orphanage.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Helenowek.",
        "A: She was very, very poor. They lived in one room in a little suburb. She had a brother and a\nsister older, no mother, and a father, and she told me that Rumkowski had made a speech that\nmorning, or would make a speech the next morning.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The essence of the speech was that the Germans had demanded 20,000 sick, elderly, and\nchildren, most of them children to be sent out of the ghetto. And the wording of the speech\nwas, and that I think is a matter of record, \u201cMothers and fathers, give me your children so\nthat the rest of us may live and survive.\u201d There were outcries, maybe a stone or two were\nthrown, but police was present. He tried to explain that he tried to negotiate that they\nwouldn\u2019t take children over 11 years of age, but they would have to take the sick. He got the\nnumber decreased by a thousand and various other justifications. Those who heard the speech\nand those who found about it were appalled. It was \u2014 the concept was unthinkable. During\nthe process, that the deportation was announced by Rumkowski, and by the time he had the\nlists on the streets of the people written up, the Germans got angry and impatient. They\nenforced a curfew of seven days starting in September, I believe it was the 7\". We were not\nsupposed to be out on the street for seven days and seven nights. The Germans came into the\nghetto with trucks, with dogs and with guns. They went from street to street and from house\nto house, and the square area of the ghetto was not very large. And it went house by house.\nThey came to our street. We had a neighbor sit on the roof and look out. And when they\nentered the courtyard, they shouted for everybody to assemble in the courtyard. And then\nthey went into the building and found those who had hidden. They beat them and put them on\nthe truck. And then the looked at the remainder of those standing in the courtyard, probably\n60 people, and within five minutes, they separated the old and the young from the more fit\nhuman beings. My sister, although she was 11 years old, not 10, was taken. I tried to go onto\nthe truck with her. The guns stopped me. The truck drove off. My neighbor\u2019s mother was\ntaken \u2014 many people out of the building. He was a policeman. He couldn\u2019t get his mother\nreleased. We never found out where they were taken, what was done with them, where they\nsupposedly were resettled, in what labor camp they might have been sent. But eventually, a\nfew packages of clothing came back into the ghetto. And supposedly \u2014 I did not see it \u2014 some\nof the clothing was blood-stained. Actual notes or actual letters I don\u2019t believe were found.\nNobody could give us an answer. We hoped that they were alive \u2014 someplace, somewhere.\nAnd the curfew was lifted after seven days, and life continued for the rest of us. It was almost\nas 1f we had been hypnotized, as if we just \u2014 we just went on. We went to work. We collected\nthe soup. We collected the food ration. It continued. We had been robbed not of our children,\nbut of our feelings, of our compassion. Some children were hidden, but very few. How he\ncould have asked to hand over the children, I did not understand at 16. I don\u2019t understand it\nnow. Did he have a choice? I would say so. Czerniakow had a choice. I mean, his life was\nnot so precious that he could not have said no. He could have refused to obey the orders. He\nwould have paid the price, but to ask this of the community is unthinkable. I was fired from\nthe dress factory. I don\u2019t know for what reason, probably incompetence. I did not sew very\nwell. And I went back to the office on Rybna, 8 because I knew a woman there from Vienna.\nAnd by then it was October, and it was cold, and we stood around the stove and I said, \u201cI\nneed a job desperately.\u201d And her boss, who sat a desk in the corner, came over. He started\ntalking to me, and by then I spoke Polish and Yiddish, and he said, \u201cIll give you a job.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cDoing what?\u201d And he said, \u201cWe have received truckloads of forms to be completed for\nthe Germans in Germany for their coal rations. And the forms have to be figured and\ncompleted. And you\u2019ll sit in the office. I need 300 people. You write down the names. People\nwill tell you they\u2019Il work here. You just get their addresses, and you just do it.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay,\nPll do it. A job is a job.\u201d His boss was Henryk Neftalin, the attorney, who was in his late 30s.\nA very fair man. A very able man. I had met his mother when I was running around with\nthose passports a year earlier. And he was much admired. The strange thing was that he had\nRumkowski\u2019s ear. When he would go to Rumkowski, he might take some abuse, but in the\nend, he would argue. And half the time, Rumkowski would listen. So, he was much admired.\nHis girlfriend worked in one of the administrative offices. Her name was Klatalka (ph). And I\nworked in that office, I would say, until 43, end of \u201943. And one day Bernard Fuchs decided\n\u2014 he was the head of the Department of Labor \u2014 that too many people worked in that office,\nand he needed people in the straw shoe factory for the Russian front. And the commission of\nseveral dignitaries came, among them Rumkowsk1i. And it was again a selection of who goes\nand who stays. And I hid pretty much to the bitter end until I was called, because they had\nmy name on the list. And Rumkowski sat on a chair. He had taken off his hat and his coat,\nand he had his cane in his right hand. And for a minute, he reminded me of a fairy tale \u2014 a\nking sitting on a throne. He spoke to me in Yiddish and he asked me my name, whether I had\nfamily, where I had come from, and in the end he said, \u201cLittle German, you may stay, and\nyou'll hear from me.\u201d He took a lot of people out of that office at that particular time.\nBernard Fuchs threw out the list as he had drawn up previous deportation lists. I had gone to\nhis office when I was jobless and asked him for employment because he was born in\nHannover, Germany, and he spoke German. And after my third visit, he lost his temper, and\nhe said that he had not jobs, that I was a pest, or the equivalent in Polish. He opened the door\nand he yelled like a German, \u201cRaus!\u201d\u2019",
        "A: Before I got the job-",
        "A: -with Goetz, and then again after I lost the job with Goetz, twice. And then there was a third\ntime when I lost the job in the clothing factory. I saw him throughout the ghetto, sometimes\nin a carriage, sometimes not. He knew me because there were not many people who came\nfrom Hamburg who had been to Hannover, who could speak German. I also went for an\ninterview to Balutaring with his sister Dora Brooks. She wouldn\u2019t hire me, no reason given.",
        "A: She was more than that. She was his ears and his mouth because Rumkowski could not speak\nto the Germans in any language. She could speak. She could speak Polish, and by then, with\nthe same accent I had, and she could speak German. I went to Walchovna (ph). I went to a\nwhole variety of women who were in factories. And there were many that were capable, that\nwere intelligent, but they wouldn\u2019t hire a woman. That was competition \u2014 a man, yes \u2014 a\nwoman, no. So, I went back to work, and a few weeks later, my boss Henryk Neftalin called\nme into his office and he said, \u201cI\u2019m transferring you to the Statistical Department on Plac\nKoscielny, 4.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to leave because I\u2019d become very friendly with Spiegel and I did\nnot like the unknown. But you didn\u2019t argue with Henryk Neftalin. He was fair. He was\ndecent. What his reasons were, I never knew. They could have been several. It could have\nbeen that he wanted me out of Rumkowsk1\u2019s reach. It could have been the fact that I came to\nwork one day with a very bloody face when I had been sent to the Kripo because somebody\nsaid I had a radio, and I never did have a radio. And he saw my bloody scars, my bloody\nface, my bruised eyes. He transferred me because in essence he was the actual head of the\nStatistical Department. He had the first word and the last word. It was a long way to work\nover the bridge. And 1n winter it was hard to walk, so they unshoveled snow on the bridge.\nYou slid back rather than forward. Hundreds of people cross the bridge every morning, and\nyou were afraid that somebody would carry lice and they would jump over on your clothing.\nThat was the greatest fear because they carried typhus. The office...",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape 3\nTape 4",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think 70. I think it was in May around 15 or 20, and then again in September,\nthere were a lot of smaller deportations in between a thousand or 2,000. The actual numbers I\ndon\u2019t know, but the ghetto at any one time had roughly 160,000 people.",
        "A: Over the course, yes.",
        "A: Well, I reached out for her. I tried to go with her. I was not allowed, but life in the overall\nghetto went on. People even went so far as to use, at least for a week or two, the ration card\nof a person who was deported. So, there was no \u2014 there was no feeling. There was no \u2014 there\nwas a sadness, but there was not a deep desperation and there should have been, and that, I\nthink two or three years of ghetto life killed that within us.",
        "A: Yes, she had one.",
        "A: No, I did not. My neighbor asked whether she could pick up the bread on her card, and I said,\n\u201cNo.\u201d And I handed it into the coupon department and let it go at that. I just couldn\u2019t because\nI had read a story, and supposedly it was fiction of children looking across a barbed wire at\nthe Fehk Etta (ph) bread store and there was one across our street on the other side, and they\nlooked from the attic down into the bakery and they were talking about the bread and how\ngood it smelled, and it went on for quite awhile, and then came the deportations. And, just for\nthe deportation, the father was so hungry that he stole a piece of the children\u2019s bread. And the\nfather was deported. The mother and the two children hid and remained in the ghetto. The\nmother kept the card. She collected the father\u2019s bread. I don\u2019t know for how long. She gave it\nto the children, and she says, \u201cChildren, eat your father\u2019s bread.\u201d And that\u2019s the end of the\nstory, and the story was written by Spiegel in the ghetto. It has been translated into English.",
        "A: He read this story to me when he wrote the first draft.",
        "A: That was after the \u2014 it was 1943.",
        "A: It was like robbing a grave, maybe. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know \u2014 it wasn\u2019t mine to use. It\nwasn\u2019t mine to give. It was hers. I can\u2019t give you the reason. I do not know.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, it ended before deportation.",
        "A: No, I first go to the clothing factory in between and then I go back to Rybna,8 , and Spiegel\ngives me a job. That was pretty much the end of \u201942.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The coal rations for the German population.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: This is paperwork. It has nothing to do with Jews. It\u2019s like an audit at the Internal Revenue.\nHe goes over the figures. We got forms, let\u2019s say, from the city of Berlin, and Mr. Smith\nlives in an apartment with four other people. He was entitled to a hundred kilo of coal, and\nwe had to figure that out. Four times 50 or four times 25 is 100. Then there is Mr. Joe who\nhas eight people living in his apartment. Each person gets 25 kilos. So, we had to come up\nwith the figures, and there were thousands of these forms brought into the ghetto in\ncontainers, and we went through box after box doing the clerical work and having them\nshipped out of the ghetto again to Germany, so they could take the forms, give them to their\npeople, and have them collect the coal. All we did was clerical work.",
        "A: Yes, it had to be a few months, or it was for the following year. That I cannot say.",
        "A: I work for Spiegel.",
        "A: The office had about three or four people, one of whom was Pushovsky (ph), one was \u2014 the\nother one was Spiegel, I think there was one more man. I\u2019m not sure. But there were 300\npeople in the office.",
        "A: In the whole office doing nothing but these forms. And while they did the forms, there were\nsupervisors, but they all directly worked for Spiegel.",
        "A: Well, he wore glasses. He had slicked-back black hair. He walked very deliberately, very\nslowly. He always carried a briefcase. He was very absent-minded, and he was always\nwriting, in Yiddish, because I peeked and I couldn\u2019t read because he wrote very fast. He was\nalso quite sure of himself. He had published already at the age of 22 in the Yiddish Bletter in\nWarsaw. He had taught school for awhile. What did I think of him?",
        "A: Yes, but I did not pay much attention. He was \u2014 you would call him today a little stuffy, and\nhe wore these little black horn-rimmed glasses or wire glasses \u2014 medium height, medium\nbuilt, wore a suit unpressed. The shirts were a little rumpled. I mean, it wasn\u2019t somebody\nwho would particularly strike you in a crowd, not in a ghetto.",
        "A: He asked me to stay after work, and work ended at eight or nine.",
        "A: Eight or nine at night.",
        "A: And the janitor whose name was Betczak was a little bit retarded but very sweet, would\nsweep the office.\n[Break in tape]",
        "A: Betezak like a bed, Betczak. And, he would come and sweep around the offices and he would\nsit there at ten at night or whatever time it was, and Spiegel would read his drafts on which\nhe worked most of the daytime although he wasn\u2019t supposed to, and \u2014 in Yiddish \u2014 and he\ntold me what to think about them, whether they were good or not so good. And I listened,\nand some of his poetry is very beautiful. And the short stories really took me very much by\nsurprised. They were fiction, but they were the story of the man who lost his horse to hunger,\nor the Germans killed an animal, or the father who stole bread from the children. He wrote a\nbook during the ghetto time that was called \u201cMalches Ghetto\u201d \u2014 \u201cKingdom Ghetto\u201d, and it\ngives a story of the church on the Platske Chernya (ph), and the people who go in and who go\nout. He had a facility to describe people, and the description ran several pages. It reminded\nme of Thomas Mann and the Buddenbrooks. It gave the background of the story, the smell,\nthe atmosphere, the air, the grass, the sky. It \u2014 to me at age 17, 1t was very impressive.",
        "A: Because I was very young and really didn\u2019t know very much. And we sat until very late in\nthe office and when the janitor finally had to lock up, he walked me back to Pawia, 26, and\nthat became a habit, a custom. It was noticed in the office. It was talked about in the office.\nSome people made fun of it because the age difference was tremendous.",
        "A: It was 20 or 22 years, and I found it very awkward. I really didn\u2019t know how I felt about him.\nI admired him as a writer, or I liked his stories. I did not even know whether you could say a\nwriter. I did not think that the stories would survive the war or we would survive the war, and\nthen he began writing short poems, and I think there are eight or nine of them, and they were\nwritten to me. They were published after the war, and that\u2019s when he said, \u201cIf your mother\nwere alive, I would ask her to marry you.\u201d He told me that he had a daughter, Eva, who died\nin the ghetto at not even a year old, and that\u2019s when I found out that he had a wife. He was\nseparated from her. I saw once or twice. Somebody pointed her out. He had a couple of\nsisters, several brothers, and very, very old parents. They probably weren\u2019t as old as they\nlooked old. The father could read and write Yiddish. The mother took in laundry for people\nbefore the war. She washed the laundry. She hung it up on the roof, and he had to sit on the\nroof to watch that the laundry wouldn\u2019t be stolen. The poverty in which he grew up was\nincredible. I had never heard of such poverty, and I believe that the apartment \u2014 and I was\nthere twice \u2014 in which his parents lived, and the apartment which he shared during their time\nwas theirs before the war. It was tiny. It was dark. There was hardly any furniture. It was the\nkind of poverty that you read about, but you never see it. By Spring or Summer in 43, I was\ntaken to the common law police, severely beaten, and when I came back to the office,\nnobody said much, but I found out that I had been denounced for having a radio. The\nGermans who beat me up told me that a woman had denounced me, and eventually being a\nghetto and being a very small area, it became known that she had given my name to the\ncommon law police.",
        "A: His separated wife. We never spoke about it.",
        "A: He saw it. You couldn\u2019t escape it. My left side \u2014 the whole left side of my face was for weeks\na mess, but we never spoke about it. He kept bringing me back to Pawia, 26. He read me\nstories. He wrote more stories. And the following week he wrote a poem and he wrapped in\nan orange roll with a ribbon tied around, and the poem started \u201cThe eyes are green.\u201d The\npoem has been published in Israel and in Poland, and in one other book is a whole section\nand it says, \u201cFor Cilla.\u201d This friendship, I wouldn\u2019t call it a love affair. It was in between the\ntwo. On one hand, he was selfish. He got from Neftalin two weeks\u2019 leave to work in the\nbakery, which meant he could eat as much bread as he could absorb, but it also meant that his\nbread ration was not needed by him during the two weeks. I\u2019m sure it went to his family, but\nhe never offered me a slice. It hurt. Then I moved to Lutomierska, and it was then that he told\nme that he had written a poem \u201cRaisins and Almonds\u201d. The poem was set to music by\nBeigelmann (ph). It was performed in the ghetto at night, clandestine in a basement.\nRumkowski read about it because it says in one of the voices that \u201cWe are so hungry we have\nnothing to eat. What should the poor child do?\u201d Rumkowski took offense, and he threatened\ndeportation, and he said, \u201cAs long as I am here, you will write no more.\u201d Neftalin intervened\nwith the understanding and the promise that there would be no references to Rumkowski in\nanything and there weren\u2019t from that point forward. He hated the man with vengeance, and\nhe always said, \u201cIf you ever get to know him, be careful.\u201d I don\u2019t know how to translate it,\nprobably the closest would be, \u201cHe is a pest,\u201d a parch in Yiddish.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Spiegel?",
        "A: \u201cRumkowski is a parch,\u201d P-A-R-C-H, I think. He would not say anymore. He told me the\nstory about the baby\u2019s song. It\u2019s a lullaby, so to speak, and around that time, Rumkowski\ncame to the office. He did see Spiegel because he sat in the main conference room, and they\ndid not look at each other. Neftalin took over, and he took a lot of people out of the office\ninto the factories, straw factory mainly, and he told me that I would hear from him. And that\nevening, Spiegel again warned me, and in a way he was angry because I had done nothing,\nbut somehow he felt it was partly my fault.",
        "A: No, that Rumkowski had said I will hear from him.",
        "A: He saw that scene. And Fuchs didn\u2019t say anything. He was present, Bernard Fuchs, and then\nNeftalin transferred me to the Statistical Department, and Spiegel picked me up every\nevening. He went over the bridge, picked me up, went back over the bridge to Lutomierska,\nwent back over to the bridge to his parents\u2019 house.",
        "A: No, I would say the middle of \u00b043.",
        "A: Yes, six months, seven months.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And, there was on Pawia, 26 \u2014 and that\u2019s in a book, 1n a poem \u2014 there was a covered well,\nand the well was covered with a wooden lid, quite large, and we would stand on that lid with\nour gloves on and our scarves and our hats and we would kiss, and there is a story of \u201cDer\nTot Brunnen\u2019\u2019, \u201cThe Dead Well\u201d, because the well was no longer active. My feelings were\nstrange, I could not decide. He would say odd things. After the war, you would be married to\na famous man. He was very sure of himself.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: He was very sure of himself, very much in love, and yet very frightening, and it told me not\nto worry about the divorce. Now, a divorce could only be granted by Rumkowski, and that\nwas not in the picture. I know what my mother would have said.\n[Break in tape]",
        "A: I think she would have told me that I had lost my mind, that he had lost his mind, and she\nprobably would have locked me up and thrown the key away.",
        "A: That I even dared to get involved, which was my fault, and because he was in no way\nsuitable, not age-wise, not professionally, not \u2014 she would have considered him a man\nwithout a conscience, because he wasn\u2019t divorced.",
        "A: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: I was brought up very proper.",
        "A: Well, it was the loneliness of being alone. It was a feeling of having somebody care for you,\nbut on the other hand, I didn\u2019t talk much. I listened. I didn\u2019t talk because there is a poem and\nit starts, \u201cWer Stricts der ausoy forbissen\u201d (ph). \u201cWhy are you so stubbornly silent?\u201d Because\nI was very insecure. I was not comfortable. In some way, yes. In some ways, no.",
        "A: He was talking at me \u2014 very few questions. He wanted to know about the parents. He wanted\nto know about the home. But they were almost scientific questions. They were not\nparticularly personal or informative or desiring to know.",
        "A: Yes, he did say that, and I said I would not consider that, especially not in the ghetto, where\nall these various affairs were public knowledge. I was brought up too strict and too proper to\nhave thrown all caution to the wind. If I had known then of the duration of the ghetto, of\nAuschwitz, of Neuengamme, or Bergen-Belsen, I might have said, \u201cWhy not?\u201d But I didn\u2019t\nknow then.",
        "A: Yes, first love.",
        "A: Yes, because I cared. It was not \u2014 it was not like being madly in love. It was more like being\nloved by somebody who cared, but not having to be alone.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t out of desperation. It was \u2014 it was like in any society where people live in close\nproximity that these connections are made. The director of the corset factory and another\nfactory, they had a m\u00e9nage-a-trois, and it was common knowledge in the ghetto. They lived\nin one room, in one bed, everybody laughed. It wasn\u2019t funny. It was actually sad. Dora Fuchs\nwas madly in love with the Auday Yakobovitch (ph). Yakobovitch was married. There are\nhundreds of these stories. Some were true love stories. Some survived the war and lasted\nlong beyond the war, and some broke up with the end of the war.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. It varied from case to case. It depended on the individual. If a man was in a powerful\nposition, yes. He had the power and the clout to demand, but so did the women in powerful\npositions. It worked both ways. They\u2019d pick the man that they wanted.",
        "A: As far as I know, in the ghetto for the first time, women were not only nurses or teacher or\nhomemakers, there was a woman a year older than I who ran the mattress factory, and she\nhad her pick of the crop, as you would say. There was Dora Fuchs, for instance. There was\nVal Kovner (ph). There were many, many, and these women were very capable. They were\npowerful. They were very smart, very intelligent, but very tough, very tough.",
        "A: I learned all this-",
        "A: Slowly.",
        "A: Slowly, \u201942 \u2014\u201943 \u2014 44.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Because I had no idea. I had a read some translated French literature that was risque, but I\nreally did not know what to make of it. If the director of the evening kitchen had an affair\nwith a police \u2014 with a Jewish police, kept in only on the dining table in the kitchen, and it\nwas common knowledge in plain view, it was shocking beyond words.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes, public places. There was a woman in charge of the recovery home where you\nwould be sent for two weeks if you were a deserving worker, but you had to be of fairly high\nrank, and it was out in Marysin, and Spiegel were walking, and she came over. She was twice\nmy age, maybe more, and she made an open proposition.",
        "A: Yes, while I stood there like the fool that I was, and he said, \u201cLet us stand here. You can\ncome back later,\u201d but he didn\u2019t. So, all this was very shocking.",
        "A: And then towards the end, after the evening kitchen, Spiegel just stopped picking me up. I\nasked him why. He didn\u2019t answer. He might have gone back to his wife. He might have\nstayed with his parents, but we never spoke again. In January \u201944, I was on a deportation list,\nand my friend Elie went to him to get me off the list. He went to talk Podlowski (ph), who\nhad influence, and my name was deleted, but I never saw not until 1963, when he picked us\nup at the airplane.",
        "A: And my two children.",
        "A: In Tel Aviv.",
        "A: He picks me up every evening.",
        "A: No, I was heartbroken.",
        "A: Yes. I have no interest in statistics. I had no interest \u2014 I had no knowledge even that this\noffice was of any importance or prestige. I did not particularly wanted to work for a Czech. It\nwas a very stuffy office with very few employees and everybody was at least 50 or 45. I was\nmiserable, but it was not something that I could question or refuse. It would have been\ndangerous.",
        "A: He might have also wanted to get me away from Spiegel. He might have. I will never know\nbecause he was killed in Auschwitz. I would have asked him. I don\u2019t know, because he knew\nhis former wife.",
        "A: It is possible. I will never know. It could be one of two reasons.",
        "A: Yes. Singer spent his day mainly on the street, or away from the office seeing people who\nhad some knowledge, who had some influenced, who had important jobs. I would pick up at\nthe bottom of the bridge in the police station from Sergeant Margolis the daily statistics \u2014 so\nmany people died, so many people committed suicide, so many were deported. When Singer\ncame back into the office, he would write or have us take notes and eventually, he produced a\ntremendous amount of material, because the chronicle of the large ghetto 1s not all Singer\u2019s. I\nthink several hundred pages at least, and that\u2019s a forthcoming book now. He was a journalist.\nHe had worked as a journalist in Prague. He had a tremendous insight, and normally, I was\nable to understand his writing except for one two-page \u2014 I couldn\u2019t even call it a report. It\nwas more like a love letter to Rumkowski. If you want to read the German version, I can get\nit for you. It\u2019s available in Lodz and at the University in Giessen. It does not fit his\npersonality. It does not fit his other reports. It does not fit the man because he very well knew\nand realized that, on some level, Rumkowski was collaborating. He followed orders. Whether\nhe followed orders because he really believed it would buy us life or time, or whether he\ndidn\u2019t have the courage to do anything else, because he made it very clear any kind of\nresistance would not be appreciated is a mild word, would not be tolerated. So, this last entry\nto Rumkowski could have only meant that he took it there and got some sort of a reward,\nwhich meant additional food, a loaf of bread, whatever. His daughter was my age and I met\nher through him, and his son was two or three years older, and he cultivated the girls whose\nfather belonged to the police and to other important ghetto institutions. He worked in the\nbakery as an electrician. Strangely enough, Dr. Singer, a very educated man and so was his\nwife, did not send either one of his kids to college, and he could have because Prague was not\nGermany. Whether they would not have been college material, I really cannot judge. But\nboth had trades. The daughter was a seamstress and the son an electrician. The wife came\nfrom a German-speaking family in Prague, a very bright, very nice woman. His sister was in\nthe ghetto. Her husband had been arrested after Prague was occupied, and one did not know\nhis whereabouts, and she had a longstanding, ongoing connection with the director of the\nelectrical component factory. And then there were two elderly ladies living in the same\nhousehold. They had almost a small apartment on Zgierska Street. It was very clean and\nwhen I could not keep my bread for eight or nine days, I\u2019d give it to my friend, and she\nwould bring me a portion to work everyday. So, I trusted her with my bread. What else can I\nsay of the Singer? The two old ladies, especially one of them, was his landlady Roztoky, near\nPrague. No children, very wealthy. I think the husband died or was killed \u2014 or he died in the\nghetto. In the ghetto, these two ladies made out a last will and testament in favor of Dr.\nSinger. I was, about six years ago, at Sonoma State University, and the director of Holocaust\nStudies is John Steiner. John is only very partly Jewish, but he made it through Auschwitz in\nspite of the fact that he never knew he was a Jew. It turns out that one of the ladies living\nwith Dr. Singer was his aunt. He knew Dr. Singer before the war, and his daughter was his\ngirlfriend. So, I told him the story about the will, and he\u2019s now \u2014 I mean, the will was lost in\nAuschwitz \u2014 he\u2019s trying to regain the house near park, and there was also a bank account by\nthe same aunt in Switzerland, but the name and the numbers have never appeared. So, after\n50 years, to come across this little old lady again 1s very strange. I found it in a way strange\nonly it was resourceful that Dr. Singer asked the two ladies to make out their last will. On\nsome level, he must have thought that he would survive the war, because otherwise, why\nwould you do it? His son had, at times, a radio. It was in poor shape, it needed constant\nrepair. We only got the BBC and the progress of the war \u2014 nothing about Warsaw, nothing\nabout our ghetto, nothing about Auschwitz, no idea. No mention was ever made by Dr.\nSinger of a place like Auschwitz, like Bergen-Belsen. No mention was made by Neftalin, by\nSpiegel. It just was not mentioned. So, it can be assumed that we really didn\u2019t know. Maybe\nsomebody knew, but I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: No, that you saw from the letter which I got in \u201947 where it stated they were killed in\nAuschwitz, and it turned out they were killed in Hamburg. So, that is much later information.\nThe work for Dr. Singer was effortless. It was boring. It was dull. I was a clerk. It was a\nlarge, dark office, and it was terribly lonely, whereas the previous office had people. Until\none day when I got a phone call, would I please appear in police headquarters outside the\nBalutski Renneck (ph), and there was Rumkowsk1i, and he told me that I would work in the\nevening kitchen together with 40 other young women my age who had been for six months in\nthe women\u2019s police corps, and they wore uniforms just like the men. They were mostly\nyoung women who had finished matura (ph) either before they ghetto or in the ghetto in 40,\nand they strutted around the ghetto in their police uniforms, gray with an orange band, and it\nwas a police corps that lasted probably eight months.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, I\u2019m surprised that you\u2019re surprised. I thought it was common knowledge.",
        "A: Well, there are some of these women still alive.",
        "A: Yeah, and all of these went to work in the Kuechenuhr kueletini (ph) evening kitchen, which\nwas used for a two-week period for deserving workers on a coupon which gave them an\nevening meal, a little vegetables, sometimes a little starch, and something that looked like a\nhamburger, but it was round. What it contained, I really couldn\u2019t say. I ripped mine up and I\ngave it to Spiegel when he picked me up. Rumkowski knew about Spiegel and he threatened.",
        "A: Threatened me for seeing him. He told me that he knew. Who had carried the information, I\ndon\u2019t know, but it was common in the ghetto to trade information, to talk to the\nadministration about anything or to denounce people, to no particular gain other than maybe\nyou got a little reward for it, but just to carry gossip. The young policewomen were all\nwaitresses.",
        "A: No, that was before \u2014 after that, he stopped seeing me.",
        "A: End of \u201943.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t tell him.",
        "A: Anything is possible. I doubt it, but it is possible.",
        "A: I was in the office.",
        "A: If we received 50 kilo of carrots, and we had to serve 400 meals, how much did each person\nget in terms of weight? So many grams, and I had a little trouble with the arithmetic. They\nkitchen was run by a man of the name of Minsk. He was sort of grandfatherly and kind, and\nhe ran the kitchen. He was the \u2014 there were four of them. He ran this particular one, and he\nbrought in a young man who helped me with the figuring. I couldn\u2019t manage it. I could\nmanage it now. But in the afternoons, he was ordered to leave because this was done\nclandestine. Rumkowski did not know, or if he knew, he did not let on, but I was a clerk for\nthat kitchen.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yes. You found out if a factory changed management. You found if somebody was replaced\nby somebody else. You found out if people were in the ghetto yesterday. You heard a rumor,\ntrue or untrue, that Biebow tried to rape Dora Fuchs. You heard \u2014 you heard all sorts of\nrumors in that office, some of which you didn\u2019t dare put down on paper because there was\nalways the chance of censorship by the Germans, and censorship by the Jews. There were\nsometimes stories about food rations to be and they never materialized or vice versa. The\ninformation was accurate to the extent that you couldn\u2019t substantiate very much. I mean, even\nwhen I picked up the daily statistics, so many died in the hospital, so many jumped out of a\nwindow, of course, no births \u2014 there were hardly any births, even these statistics they were\nkept, but the question arises how accurate where they. There were quite a few suicides\nespecially from \u2014 committed by people coming from the west \u2014 some were doctors, some\nwere lawyers, and they must have brought something along to make suicide possible. There\nwas a rumor that the ghetto had some doctors. There was a lady by the name of Kronan\nBurke (ph). There was Dr. Miller, who was Rumkowski\u2019s favorite doctor, but no medication.\nThere was a lady dentist who operated a drill with a foot pedal, like an old fashioned sewing\nmachine, and you heard about them. You heard, for instance, that 1f you were jaundiced or if\nyou had hepatitis, atropine would help, an injection of atropine. Whether this is true today, I\ndo not know. Atropine could be somehow smuggled into the ghetto if you knew a German of\nthe guard. These things you heard in the office, but you could never vouch for honesty or\ncredibility.",
        "A: He took very brief notes, but then-",
        "A: Then it got... They\u2019re all typewritten on an old-fashioned manual typewriter. They have\nsome errors. All of his entries will be out in January in German, and if you\u2019d like it, [ll get it\nfor you. His counterpart was Oskar Rosenfeld, also from Prague, and his \u2014 he had not nearly\nas many entries. He was much older. He had a very young wife in England and he was very\ngrandfatherly, very sweet, very kind \u2014 a totally different style because when I was at the\nJustice Liebzig University, they gave me a stack of these reportages and they asked me to\nidentify them and said, \u201cHere is Singer\u2019s.\u201d\u201d And I went through them. I said, \u201c\u2018No, this is not\nSinger. This is Oskar Rosenfeld.\u201d And it was correct \u2014 totally different style. I didn\u2019t know\nhim as well as Singer because he worked in the office, but I didn\u2019t work for him. His book\nsupposedly was just published in English by Hanna Levy, either Frankfurt at the Bauer\nInstitute in Frankfurt, or it came out in Berlin. I\u2019m not sure which. And Hanna Levy did the\nediting and it supposedly came out in English. I have not seen it. And I\u2019m not as familiar\nwith his entries.",
        "A: Some I did type wherever there was a typewriter available, but there was only one and I was\nnot the only one who had access to it.",
        "A: I would transcribe some of Singer\u2019s notes in longhand. I would file things. I would give him\nthe daily statistics. I would do very menial work \u2014 nothing of any consequence or substance,\nbut I did read what he wrote because it was an interesting style.",
        "A: No, because it meant an extra meal. It was from five to seven in the evening. People lined up\nand had a coupon, and, well, Rumkowski came almost every evening, and the apron of the\nwaitress, if the bow in the back was not straight, he would hit her with a cane. He carried a\ncane. He threatened a couple of them with dismissal. In the front sat two ladies who clipped\nthe coupon which had to be counted every morning \u2014 two ladies? Two young women. The\ncooking was done by a couple of lady chefs.\nEnd of Tape 4\nTape 5",
        "A: You got them in the factory, you got them in an office, if your boss decided that you\ndeserved a bonus. And of course it was \u2014 there were never enough coupons to go around the\nghetto, but it was an incentive or a gift for some of them. There was a lot of favoritism\ninvolved as to who got them. If you were well connected, you could be sure to get the\ncoupon. It was \u2014 it was an original idea to reward a worker because it was said the straw shoe\nfactory rewarded 12 workers, not bosses, but 12 workers, or the uniform factory rewarded 10\nworkers. It was supposed to be an incentive to work hard, to try to top the quota, and in the\nend to please the Germans.",
        "A: Yes, one dinner for one coupon, but you got a week at a time. You could come for seven\ndays. So, you got seven coupons. It was one coupon and you cut off seven strips. At one\npoint, they tried to do it for two weeks, and then somebody else got a turn. How it was\ndecided, administered, as to who got them, or which factory \u2014 that was done behind closed\ndoors, I do not know, but there was a lot of protection involved.",
        "A: Well, we had this much food for the week, divide that by seven, and then divide by the\nnumber of clients or the number of diners who would come, and how much each person\nwould consume in grams. For instance, it would be 50 grams of meat which equals about an\nounce. It would be so much red beets, but the figuring was complicated. There was no adding\nmachine. There was no calculator. I had to take a pen and pencil and you had to convert the\nkilos to pounds and the pounds to grams, and in Poland they used the word \u201cdeca\u201d which\nmeant ten grams. So, it was a little overwhelming for me. I mean, I wasn\u2019t bad at math, but I\nwasn\u2019t that good.",
        "A: That depended \u2014 well, the \u2014 Mr. Mintzer was in charge of the kitchen, and it depended on the\nsupply. They would \u2014 they would send \u2014 they would come on a horse-drawn truck, sort of\nlike a flatbed truck but horse-drawn, and they would either unload or sack or a crate or\nsometimes it was flour, sometimes it was carrots or beets or turnips, very rarely potatoes,\nsometimes meat, and from the looks of it, it was horsemeat because it was very dark red, and\nit was all served on one plate, in little portions, and the portions were pretty much equal,\nalmost if you would take an ice cream scoop. We were entitled the same meal an hour before\nour guests would appear with the rule that nothing was supposed to be taken out, but we did\nanyway.",
        "A: Well, the so-called dining room was filled up. I would say probably 200.",
        "A: 150-200, but not for a ghetto of 160,000 people.",
        "A: No, it was a large kitchen. It had big kettles. The cooks were ladies, and they were standing\non a platform stirring ferociously at those kettles, and we would come in and look and they\ndidn\u2019t like it, and in the back of the kitchen was a storage room, and the storage room had the\nsupply. The young woman who ran the storage room was somewhat older than we were, I\nguess, close to 30. Her name was Meyerowitz, and she carried the key to the storage room\naround her neck, and you were not allowed to go over the threshold into that storage room.\nShe would reach \u2014 she would weigh, count, whatever, and she would reach the food out, and\nI was a little friendly with her, and if I would come near the entrance she would say, \u201cStop,\nstand there and talk to me. Don\u2019t go further.\u201d Because I might touch something or take\nsomething. She was very meticulous for reasons of her own.",
        "A: No, there were two or three people younger than I. Most were older than I, but there was a\nyoung woman that \u2014 three young women who were younger than I am, but not by much.",
        "A: Almost every \u2014 no. No, he had decent food. I mean, if you look at his prewar picture \u2014 his\nrumpled shirt, his rumpled pants, his disheveled hair \u2014 he was a poor man. When he showed\nup in the ghetto, he was pressed and tailored, immaculate \u2014 boots, he wore boots \u2014 SS-type\nboots \u2014 shined. Lodz had very good tailors. I think the best in all of Poland. His top coats, his\njackets were out of Fifth Avenue \u2014 unbelievable, elegant.",
        "A: Well, he comes in \u2014 he was very proud of his achievement, and I guess it was an\nachievement, but the people \u2014 the young people who worked for him were petrified of him\nbecause he would beat them and if he was displeased, he would dismiss them, and that was a\nrisk you took. A couple of girls I knew were dismissed. One of them managed through\nconnections to come back. It was a good job, but it was a risky job in some ways.",
        "A: Yes, I was. I was.",
        "A: Both.",
        "A: Both.",
        "A: Branya I met while I worked for Spiegel. She came into the office as a courier.",
        "A: Luba worked in the Statistical Department.",
        "A: Right. The woman who worked at the orphanage, the teacher.",
        "A: Dorka, she lived in our building. She was an unmarried woman and she was deported\ntogether with my sister to Chelmo. Yulik (ph), I met after the war in Paris.",
        "A: Oh, I met him at the very beginning, when I come into the ghetto in \u00b041.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right, who was his friend.",
        "A: Shlomo before the war had a store that sold yarns and fabrics and things like that. He had\npushcart on corner Rybna and Lutomierska Street and it sold \u2014 he sold needles and thread\nand other small items. I think he was an educated man because he spoke German. He talked\nto my mother in the very beginning, and he talked to me \u2014 as long as he lived and he died\nshortly after my mother \u2014 he talked to me in bits and pieces. On the outside, on the street\ncorner, when the weather permitted. When it got very cold and I could spare the time, I\nwould drop in at his room. He had a daughter about my age, a year older, and he would talk.\nHe lived on, I think, Narutoviska (ph) Street before the war as did Sergei. Sergei was a\nbachelor until quite late, and he worked for the city council in Lodz. He was a short man. He\nwas heavyset.",
        "A: Yes. I met him only after the war, and he had a brother. I never met him. He perished. And\nhe was a friend of Shlomo\u2019s, and he heard the story about the complaints. He tried to\ninvestigate. The first time the accusations were thrown out for lack of evidence by the Jewish\nCouncil. The second time was just before the start of the war. Supposedly, the complaint was\nfiled. Rumkowski knew about it. Sergei escaped to Russia to \u2014 through Russia, I think he\nwent to Yugahama (ph), then to Canada, then to Los Angeles. I met him in 1975. Rumkowski\nlooked for him all through the war. He thought he was hiding in the ghetto. Sergei eventually\nwent back to school and became a social worker, but while he was working on the city\ncouncil, he worked in the Balut. He knew the thieves. He knew the thief in charge. He knew\nthe underworld, and when his silver watch was stolen, he complained and it reappeared.\nThere was a young woman in the ghetto. She also worked in the kitchen, and she once took\nme home, and I met her mother \u2014 a tall, well-dressed woman, heavyset, and the father is sort\nof small and shifty-eyed gentleman, and he asked me where I come from and what my father\ndid, and his only answer was, \u201cFeh\u201d I didn\u2019t know what to make of it. The apartment in the\nBalut had all the prewar furniture, rugs, glassware, crystal, and it turned out he had lived\nthere before the war with his family as had my co-worker from the kitchen. She was very\npretty, very blonde. I don\u2019t think she could count to five, but she was very popular. She had a\ncouple of sisters, a brother-in-law, and when I asked the father, since he had such contempt\nfor my father\u2019s work, what did he do before the war, he said, \u201cA little of this, and a little of\nthat.\u201d But the rumor in the ghetto was that he had an older daughter and the daughter was\nsold to a brothel in South America. And it was common knowledge. But he had underworld\nconnection before the war; during the war, I don\u2019t know. His children survived. What\nhappened to the daughter in South America, I do not know. He and his wife did not survive.\nHis daughter is still living.",
        "A: Yes, yes, because he used to drive by in this horse-drawn buggy. Everything was signed with\nRumkowski\u2019s name from the money, to the announcements, to everything else. He was\nenvied, envied partly for power, mainly for food. I mean, it\u2019s almost like saying, \u201cWhy was\nKennedy talked about?\u201d It was a person who wielded enormous power, and who did not live\nthe life of the average ghetto dweller. He lived a different life.",
        "A: He mentions the four children.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well-",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t have a sense. I had never heard of such a thing, and it didn\u2019t \u2014 it didn\u2019t really fall\ninto place.",
        "A: Yeah, or molests them.",
        "A: And \u2014 but, to me, I mean I was 16 years old.",
        "A: It\u2019s just a story, and I must have found it frightening but I could not \u2014 I could not really relate\nto it.",
        "A: Right, and she cried and she couldn\u2019t talk. She started a sentence and never finished it.",
        "A: No. I found out bits and pieces. I found out that her food ration was considerably better than\nmine. She was a very - well, she gave the appearance of a very happy person, but she was\nvery, very unhappy because her family used her, and she had a miserable childhood, and she\nhad a miserable ghetto life.",
        "A: The child with a violin.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: She runs away and she hits the barbed wire and gets shot, but it was never publicized. It was\nnever spoken about. Nobody dared because there were many killings along the barbed wire.\nThat was very, very common. Luba was much more outspoken. She was very worldly, very\nwise. She was an orphan from a very young age. The man with whom she lived used to run a\nfood distribution center and he was caught stealing, and he ended in prison, and she had\nRumkowski release him under the condition that he would not get a job.",
        "A: Yes, she got-",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: This man and to get food, and she got a beautiful apartment out near Marysin with the\npromise that she would get married and that Rumkowski would perform the ceremony, and\nshe always postponed it. She postponed it three or four times. I don\u2019t know why, whether he\ndidn\u2019t want to get married or she didn\u2019t want to get married. I never found out.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I never knew him well enough to have a conversation with him. We said, \u201cHello\u201d and \u201cHow\nare you?\u201d and small talk but we never talked.",
        "A: \u00b043.",
        "A: No, what I understood is that Luba had to have an abortion. That she was living with her\nboyfriend. That I understood. I knew that Luba was really wise and very worldly and she\nplayed the game by her own rules. How much I related to it, or how much I understood, I\ndon\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yes, because she was very friendly, very boisterous, very outgoing, and very attractive, but\nnot pretty. She was short. She was plump. She managed to buy clothing from recent arrivals\nbecause she had the means to purchase. I liked her. There was \u2014 there was a charm about her.\nThere was a will to live. She could be a lot of fun. She could laugh about anything and there\nwas really not much to laugh about. But I liked her.",
        "A: Yes, she clipped coupons.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. It made me nervous. On the other hand, I thought maybe I will get more to eat, in an\ninnocent sort of way \u2014 maybe somebody will be kind and give me more food.",
        "A: The strings \u2014 the strings I didn\u2019t attach at that point.",
        "A: Well, he came into the office. One of the first proposals were that he would rent \u2014 he would\nrent! \u2014 he would get a room above the kitchen so he can come anytime, and I started to cry\nand I said, \u201cI want to stay where I am\u2019, et cetera. He got angry and he beat me with his cane.\nHe came back in subsequent weeks and months and it was a matter of molestation. The man\nwas impotent, but he did not like to know that or hear about it, and to me it was utterly\nfrightening because at one point I wasn\u2019t even quite sure how you become pregnant until\nLuba told me.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: It was just a matter of touching.",
        "A: Yes, and it was disgusting. The fear was tremendous. Not only the fear of the beating, but the\nfear of his power. The fear that he could decide over life and death, that he could deport, that\nhe could denounce to the Germans, that he could do just about anything. That fear was\noverwhelming. He wanted to know about my family. He wanted to know who was living in\nPalestine. He wanted to know if they were well-off. He made me promise that after the war I\nwould see to it that they would help him, both to get to Palestine and to give him money\nbecause I owed him that. And he made one remark that struck me then, it strikes me now. \u201cIf\nI can save a hundred human beings, it will have been worthwhile.\u201d I tried to figure out the \u2018it\u2019\nin the sentence. He spoke Yiddish. What would have been worthwhile? The death of so many\nothers, the collaboration, the cooperation with the Germans, a hundred human beings out of\n150,000? It \u2014 it shocked me. That and the children, \u201cGive me your children.\u201d Those remarks\nI could neither forget nor forgive.",
        "A: No, he beat me several times.",
        "A: With a stick, over the shoulder, over the head. He was not as steady on his feet as a normal\n65 year old, mainly because he probably wore those crazy boots and it wasn\u2019t easy to walk\nwith boots up to your knees. You just know that when he was displeased he would beat\npeople. Whether those were the girls in the kitchen or anybody else, it really didn\u2019t matter. If\nyou were lucky, you flinched and you hoped there were no further consequences. But he was\nevery bit as frightening as an SS \u2014 I found out later \u2014 as an SS man in uniform.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, absolutely.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I cried.",
        "A: I cried. You didn\u2019t hear a sound.",
        "A: No, he just \u2014 he vented his anger or his frustration, and if I cried, so I cried. That didn\u2019t\nbother him.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: He had the power to do so. My crying probably stalled for time, or gave me time, and the\ntime was the food ran out and the kitchen had to be closed, and everybody in that kitchen was\ntransferred to the leather factory, to the Saddlery. So-",
        "A: No, but there was one woman about ten years older than I who took him up on the offer of a\nroom on the other side of the kitchen, but she didn\u2019t care. She was only stupid enough not to\ncover the windows, and she was dumb enough to talk. But she was much older \u2014 much, much\nolder, at least ten years older.",
        "A: Right",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yes, he also went into the storeroom where the provisions were kept and the door was\nlocked. That\u2019s all I know.",
        "A: I think it lasted about three months, four months.",
        "A: Every other day, at least.",
        "A: Yeah, because it was his accomplishment, his pride and joy, his \u2014 his child, I mean, this\nbrainstorm of having a kitchen for deserving workers. I mean, what else could he give them?\nMoney didn\u2019t mean a thing. The only thing that meant anything was food. So, he came just to\nmake sure that everything was running properly, because there was a lot of theft, there was a\nlot of corruption, there was a lot of dishonesty, and we all knew. It was unavoidable. It was\nunderstandable. So, for at least three months, he came at least every other day. You never\nknew when he would come. You could hear the horse\u2019s hooves outside, the clicking, and\nthen, who else had a horse? And, then in the hallway, you could hear his footsteps because he\nwalked very unevenly and very noisily.",
        "A: Oh, it would be at least two or three times a week, at least twice a week.",
        "A: No. She had an idea because she was much smarter than I was, and I did ask her about\npregnancy, and she laughed. She laughed so hard, and she said, \u201cDon\u2019t you know how you\nget pregnant?\u201d And I really didn\u2019t know, and \u2014 but, that really didn\u2019t change anything. I went\nonce to see Dr. Kronenburg, and she looked at me as if I was a little bit out of my mind, but\nshe was kind, and she said, \u201cGo back; don\u2019t worry.\u201d",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Don\u2019t have to worry, she said, \u201cBesides, you\u2019re not menstruating. Why are you worrying?\u201d\nAnd I said, \u201cWhat does that have to do with it?\u201d It was very complicated.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It just stopped.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think she was shocked. She was an older woman who probably had children my age.\nShe was well-known. She was an MD. She was not a felczer, because the ghetto had a lot of\ndoctors that were \u2014 like, what should I say \u2014 first-aid man, or medical corpsman and they\nwere called a felczer, from falsifying the word comes, but they were called doctors because\nthere was a scarcity of doctors and hospitals otherwise, and she was too smart and too\nintelligent and probably slightly amused. I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yes, that I would be so stupid, and she said, \u201cIt\u2019s all right, child, go home.\u201d",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t relevant. You \u2014 the ghetto did not have time, compassion, or patience for\nanyone\u2019s mental well-being. That did not exist, and didn\u2019t exist during most of the war. It\ndidn\u2019t even exist in 1946 in New York. So, this is human nature. You just shrug, and you\nfigure it out by yourself.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: She told me that she had known him since childhood, since the orphanage, but their\nrelationship, their talk was so relaxed and so easy, it wasn\u2019t on the basis of \u201cSir.\u201d It was on\nthe basis of \u201cyou\u201d, and you don\u2019t call the president \u201cyou;\u201d you call him \u201cMr. President.\u201d\nEven in Polish. So, it was fairly obvious that there was a connection, somehow, somewhere.",
        "A: Well, the power she gained was the additional food, the apartment, those were the obvious\ngains. She managed all sorts of strange things. She lived in a small room, a small apartment,\nand it was cold and you couldn\u2019t heat it, but you could get the element, which is the spiral\nthat fits into a heater, for instance, and she strung it across the room from right to left, but\nyou couldn\u2019t hook it up to meter because the Germans would have known. So, she got in an\nelectrician to hook it up above the meter, so it would not show the numbers on the individual\nroom meters. I mean, she knew things that nobody knew. She knew how to survive.",
        "A: She didn\u2019t use it.",
        "A: No, on the contrary, she was very relaxed and she was very sweet, very smiley.",
        "A: Yeah, very outgoing, jovial, joking, because in the end, she got a reward.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Fear.",
        "A: Fear, just fear, cold fear.",
        "A: Over and over.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. Maybe he would have found another toy, but the kitchen closed on Monday and on\nTuesday we were working in the Saddlery, all of us.",
        "A: Yes, it was sewing the metal frames that go around a shovel that a soldier carries on his belt\nto dig a trench, and those were sewn on a goat or a causa (ph), as you say in a Yiddish. That\nmeans you sit on a bench and in front of you is like a head with a vice, with a wooden vice,\nand you put the leather into \u2014 the two pieces of leather into the wooden vice, you have an awl\nto punch the whole, and then you have a long string with two needles, one right, one left \u2014\nand you sew a double stitch like this, and it was piecework. I mean, they counted it, and once\nin a while, there were ten strips to a unit. Once in awhile, we were a strip short, and then you\nhad to go to the foreman, who was a young man our age and you had to do a lot of explaining\nand a lot of excusing, and then you would get another strip, but they were counted out\ncarefully because the Germans had shipped them carefully. The reason my strips disappeared\nis I stole them. I stole six strips because my shoes had no soles, and I put them in the top of\nmy boots, and I walked through the inspection; it was like at the airport. They would tap you\nfrom neck to the bottom. Occasionally you had to undress, and I only told about it after I had\nall six out. Nobody knew, and people thought I must have lost my mind, but I had no soles\nfor the winter.",
        "A: I got a shoemaker to sole the shoes, and the reason he didn\u2019t talk is because he could keep\nhalf of the strips, and he could sell them for bread. I think it\u2019s about the only time I stole.\nThat\u2019s why I never bought a pair of boots, never.",
        "A: The boots came from an old hatbox that my mother had, and when I had them made, I gave\nhalf the hatbox to the shoemaker. And in Poland, there are two shoemakers; one who makes\nthe uppers and one who makes the bottom. One makes the uppers are the kupita (ph), and the\nbottom is the shaftsa (ph), and it\u2019s two procedures. It\u2019s like a designer, designing the upper\npart, and then putting the sole on it. And the reason I got them made was that I left them have\nthe box, half the hatbox because it had a top and a bottom. The side were sort of stiff, and \u2014\nbut they only lasted one winter or maybe a winter and a half and I came through the soles,\nand I had frostbite, and they were pull up boots in sort of a nice brown leather, but much too\nsoft for shoes. They were for a hatbox, not for shoes. But I had enough room below the knee\nto get a thin item into it like a strip of leather, and those I stole.",
        "A: Because I remember those boots.",
        "A: No. I couldn\u2019t, because my mother used the box for hats before the war. I never bought a pair\nof boots.",
        "A: Probably, but in California there were boots. It\u2019s fashionable.",
        "A: Yes, but the frostbite remained. I saved the toes, but barely. And once in awhile, they lose all\ncirculation and they turn greenish-blue. But I kept them. I mean, I didn\u2019t lose any toes. They\nthawed out.",
        "A: Until deportation out of the ghetto in fall of \u201944.",
        "A: Yes, I worked there a few months.",
        "A: No, never \u2014 never saw him again.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Nothing. If you went through the war, nothing leaves your mind. It\u2019s filed away under Z or\nY. You don\u2019t think of it every minute or every day, but once in awhile, something comes\nback. I was at the airport in Munich in September, and it was of course after New York, and\nthere the Germans stood in their uniforms and their black boots, and one of them started\nyelling, \u201cYou can\u2019t use this door. Use that door.\u201d And normally I don\u2019t understand German, I\njust understand English, and it brought back, \u201cWhat are you, Gestapo?\u201d I just \u2014 it just came\nback. I didn\u2019t do it on purpose. There are flashbacks when I\u2019m under stress, but not\notherwise.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Because it\u2019s difficult to admit this. The times have changed. We hear now of abuse of\nchildren. We hear now of abuse of wives. Twenty years ago, we didn\u2019t talk about it. It\u2019s very\npainful to go public with something you\u2019re not proud of. What should I have done? Maybe I\nshould have run away. Maybe I should have slapped him. I don\u2019t know. Maybe I should have\ndone something. It\u2019s difficult to say, and that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t write it. The other reason I didn\u2019t\nwrite it is because my mother used to say, \u201cIf you can\u2019t say something good about a human\nbeing, don\u2019t say it.\u201d And I agonized with that for years.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know whether people now really can understand our past. I think you have to have\nlived through it to understand it emotionally. Intellectually, maybe \u2014 I can\u2019t expect my\nchildren to understand the past or what it was like. It\u2019s not possible. The Holocaust has\nbecome a matter of scholarly research, of history, and it is viewed differently than it is\nviewed by those who were there. It is unavoidable, and it will change more in 20 years when\nwe are gone.",
        "A: Yeah, but look at the people who work as nurses in a hospital and kill people by injection.\nWouldn\u2019t you expect that their training, the intellect \u2014 after all, they went to college \u2014 and\ntheir medical knowledge, to do just the opposite. And what is it in human nature that makes\nus inhuman? I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Maybe.",
        "A: People believe me, except for Germany, where I was told, \u201cWe are having a problem with\nthe subject of all the Jewish elders.\u201d And I cannot understand why. As I explained to them,\npolitely at first, \u201cIf you had not invaded Poland, if you had not created the ghettos, if you had\nnot kept us prison within the ghettos, we would have had no Jewish elders. So, you shouldn\u2019t\nhave a problem because these are facts.\u201d If you question the honesty, I can only say, \u201cWere\nyou there?\u201d If you were not there, it\u2019s easy to talk. So, that\u2019s the only thing I encountered, in\nGermany, not in this country.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: They would like to see evidence. They know of other quotes in other books, of other\nparagraphs. They know of the dismissed complaint, which happened in the mid \u201930s. It is not\nsomething that appeared out of nowhere. The indications were there. The knowledge was\nthere, but in the \u201930s, for a Jewish community to admit something like this is overwhelming.\nYou couldn\u2019t do that. The publicity would have been devastating, and it wasn\u2019t done. I mean,\nthere were a lot of taboos in the \u201930s, and lots of things that were never mentioned.",
        "A: All right.",
        "A: Dessauer Ufer.",
        "A: Yes, which was a camp, and out-, a sub-camp of Neuengamme, and from there they moved\nus to Sasel, to build temporary housing for the Germans for the bombed out Germans, and\nfrom there to Bergen-Belsen.",
        "A: Yes, March \u201945.",
        "A: Just about, and I wouldn\u2019t have made it much longer.",
        "A: The dead were not buried. The dead were lying on the walkways. Typhus was rampant. The\ndead were not even thrown into the pits. They were decaying. People died by the hundreds.\nThe Germans did not enter the camp any longer. They remained on the other side of the\nbarbed wire. The camp was guarded from watchtowers by Hungarian \u2014 by soldiers in\nHungarian uniforms who were vicious, who shot a great deal, and I think another three to\nfour weeks and Bergen-Belsen would have been empty. Nobody would have survived.",
        "A: Thad typhus and just before, and my friend who was killed in Sweden at least gave me some\nwater. I had jaundice in the ghetto. I had liver problems in the ghetto. I had kidney trouble,\nand a few other little things.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t think so.",
        "A: Yes and no, because Lodz lasted three full years and the horror was overwhelming. Bergen-\nBelsen was as horrible, maybe more so, but of shorter duration. So, the impact for me was\nthe ghetto and not Bergen-Belsen because by Bergen-Belsen, you really didn\u2019t care anymore.\nThere was not enough energy left to care.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: We were in cattle cars and looking through the slits above. You had to stand on somebody\u2019s\nshoulders. You saw troop trains on adjacent tracks. You saw other trains with men in striped\ngray and blue uniforms that were shouting something at us, which you of course could not\nhear. I sat in a corner together with Dr. Singer, his sister, his wife and his two children. The\nlast time I saw him was in Auschwitz. How he died in Auschwitz, I\u2019m not sure. Somebody in\nGermany claimed he was shot. I rather doubt it. I think he was very gaunt looking and he\nlooked much older than his age. I think he just went to the gas chamber. I spent the whole\nrest of the war with his daughter partly with his wife. His wife died right after liberation of\nBergen-Belsen. His sister survived and died in London. It\u2019s really immaterial how he died.\nHe didn\u2019t make it out of Auschwitz.",
        "A: We heard some distant air raids in and around the city of Hamburg, but it was not the major\nattack of \u201943. We heard rumors because adjacent to us were some Italian prisoners of war and\nin Neuengamme were French prisoners of war. We heard rumors, but we had heard rumors\nfor five years. We had no idea.",
        "A: All right.\nTape 6",
        "A: The deportation was by street. The streets were posted which were off limits as part of the\nghetto. My street was very early on the list. That meant if you did not vacate or if the Jews\ndid not vacate that street, the Germans would take us out or shoot us. I\u2019m not sure which. So,\nyou took whatever you could carry, and you vacated your rooms or room, and you could\nwalk to the other side of the bridge if you knew somebody there and stay there for awhile if\nthey would let you in, or you could go voluntarily to the railroad siding. I started walking and\nI knocked on Luba\u2019s door because she was on the other side. Her boyfriend answered the\ndoor. I told him who I was, and he said in Polish and not very politely, \u201cGet lost.\u201d He didn\u2019t\nopen the door. I knocked on another door. A friend \u2014 a coworker who was living with her\nelderly mother and whose boyfriend had died Warsaw of typhus, probably about 1940, but\nthey shared the apartment with the captain of the Sonder police and his wife and I think a\nchild, and when I knocked there, the captain from the other side of the door told me, \u201cYou\neither leave or...\u201d. So, I had no choice left but walk, and it was very warm, to the railroad\nsiding in Marysin, and there were quite a lot of people milling around with their little bundles\nor suitcases. I had a little suitcase and my father\u2019s briefcase, and the briefcase held\ndocuments \u2014 papers, passports, whatever. And I saw to the left of me Oskar Singer and his\nfamily, and they said, \u201cCome on over. We\u2019ll go together.\u201d We stood there probably for a\ncouple of hours in the heat. The Germans put up the ramp to the cattle car. We each received\na piece of bread, a half a loaf of bread, some received a whole bread, and some received\nsome sort of a sausage, but we did not \u2014 nothing to drink. We entered the cattle car, and I sat\nwith Oskar\u2019s family in one corner. There were the two old ladies, Oskar and his wife, his two\nchildren, his sister, and I. And, when we asked him, \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d He shrugged his\nshoulders. He said, \u201cProbably west for labor.\u201d That was the best guess. The cattle cars were\nclosed from the outside, and they moved in stops and starts because there were other trains\non the same siding that were given preference. Either they were prisoners from other areas or\nthey were troop movements. We were never sure. We tried to yell over to a different car, but\nof course that doesn\u2019t work. We sat in these hot cattle cars. Some people cried. Some people\nfainted. There was a bucket in the corner. The bucket soon overflowed. You couldn\u2019t lie\ndown. You could barely sit. And there was really no energy to think, \u201cWhat next? Where\nnext?\u201d At one point, somebody spoke of jumping out of the car, but the doors never opened.\nThere was no jumping. The next time the door opened was four in the morning two days later\nwith a concrete platform, brightly lit and dogs barking, and SS shouting commands. We\nscrambled out of the car, and we stood. They shouted orders, \u201cMen to the left. Women to the\nright.\u201d And I stood with the women, with the single women. Oskar and his son went to the\nother side. And they were soon marched off into the distance. We don\u2019t know where. We\ndon\u2019t how they were separated again, because at this point there was no separation between\nyoung and old. We lined up, and I held the briefcase. I held onto that briefcase with the\npapers. Having grown up in Germany, papers are very important. And the command was\nshouted, \u201cDrop your belongings.\u201d Which meant a knapsack, a bag, whatever you had, but I\nwouldn\u2019t let go of the briefcase, and an SS walked towards my friend, Dr. Singer\u2019s daughter,\nand towards me and he shouted again and she took the briefcase and tore it out of my hand,\nand he shouted back, \u201cYou saved yourself a beating.\u201d",
        "A: His daughter made me drop it. She just tore it and dropped it. She probably saved my life. A\nlittle further down the road, the separated the old from the young. In back stood a woman\nwho lived also on Pawia Street, and that\u2019s another story, with a four year old child, a very\nugly child and I\u2019ve never really seen an ugly child. The child was locked up while the parents\nwent to work in the daytime. The child whined. The child was hidden behind a chimney\nduring the selection, during the curfew for hours alone, and in Auschwitz, she stood behind\nus. She was ordered to let the child go because she was probably in her \u201930s, and she\nwouldn\u2019t let the child go, and the SS man hit them between the two hands holding onto each\nother, and they didn\u2019t let go. The child screamed terribly, but they wouldn\u2019t let go, and his\nlast remarks were, \u201cYou may both go to the gas chamber.\u201d And they were marched off with\nthe old people.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Nothing, what\u2019s a gas chamber?",
        "A: No, it didn\u2019t make any sense. By evening it did, when I saw the smoke and when the\ngrapevine carried the words forward.",
        "A: No, and one was so bewildered by this whole scene that one didn\u2019t think. We heard that there\nwas a family camp in Auschwitz which we never saw. We heard that there were gypsies. We\nnever saw them. We did see Hungarian women. There was a young man in a striped uniform\nwith an armband __, red, and he spoke Polish to us and he said, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d\nAnd we said, \u201cFrom Lodz.\u201d And we asked him, \u201cWhere are we?\u201d And he said, \u201cAuschwitz.\u201d\nAnd, my friend asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s Auschwitz?\u201d He said, \u201cYou mean to say you don\u2019t know?\u201d\n\u201cNo, never heard of it.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019ve been here a year and a half, two years.\u201d He didn\u2019t\ncome from Lodz. He came from someplace else. He couldn\u2019t understand, but he did ask us\nwhether we knew his sister who might have been in our transport. And there was a woman\nwho recognized a mother who had been there a while, and she brought extra food, but that\nwas already the next day. From there, they marched us those that were fit-looking or not\nelderly or not children anymore, into a barracks. We were asked to undress, drop all jewelry,\nfold the clothing neatly, and then they took us to another barracks and they shaved our hair,\nand Dr. Singer\u2019s daughter asked, \u201cCouldn\u2019t we rather have a number?\u201d and, the answer was,\n\u201cHere you take what you get. You don\u2019t ask for anything.\u201d",
        "A: She saw some women kappa with numbers who did the actual shaving under SS orders. And\nas we were walked out of that barracks, the upper half of the door was glass and I saw my\nhead minus hair and two big ears and it looked like an egg and I started to cry. It looked so\nhorrible that today I\u2019m asking myself, \u201cHow could I have been so stupid and so vain?\u201d But I\nwas. We went into something called showers, into another barracks, and they were one\nadjacent to the other \u2014 without shoes, without clothing, and by then the grapevine had said\nsomething about gas and we looked at the showerheads and we didn\u2019t know what a gas\nchamber would look like and whether gas would come out of these things on the ceiling, and\nthe little wetness dribbled down, very little, and we were pushed forward and we were each\nthrown one piece of clothing, whether it was a dress or a rag or a house robe, one piece,\nnothing else. One woman in our group was thrown a pair of Dutch wooden shoes, the rest of\nus were barefoot. It was hot in Auschwitz \u2014 being called out in the morning, it was freezing\ncold. Being called out in the afternoon, it was so hot that the rims of my ears were burning,\nmy scalp was peeling. That\u2019s how hot it was. We were given a slice of bread a day and some\nbrown liquid to drink, and in the evening there was supposed to be a soup but we were given\nno utensils. So, Alice, who had been in the ghetto, who had come from Vienna, took off her\nwooden clogs and we each took one of them, filled them with soup, drank the soup, and\nhanded it to the next 1n line, but we guarded the shoes like you would guard Fort Knox. We\nwere afraid somebody would steal them and run.",
        "A: No, there were close to 500 of us in that barracks, and the barracks \u2014 there were no cots. The\nfloors were concrete floors and they were divided into oblong squares, oblong sections, and\neach section had to have five human beings, but there wasn\u2019t room for five. So, at night, we\nwould \u2014 one would sit against the barracks wall, spread the legs and the next one would\nmove in, until all five of us could sit that way, and in order to sleep, you would lean against\nthe neck or the chest of the person in back of you. The corner \u2014 the center of the barracks had\na raised platform, and the barracks had a couple who had been in Auschwitz quite a while,\nshe had hair. She was Jewish by the looks of her. I don\u2019t know where she came from\noriginally, not from Poland. And she had a cubicle in the corner that was sort of parceled off\n\u2014 it was sort of hidden away with a string that was attached to the right and left of the wall. It\nwas a dirty old blanket, and occasionally we\u2019d see an SS man come to visit. She screamed a\nlot. She beat us, if we weren\u2019t fast enough. I don\u2019t think she killed anybody. Her name was\nMaya. She might have been from Romania. I don\u2019t know. She did not come with us, though\nshe told us after a couple of weeks that there would be an inspection, to undress, take off the\nrag. There would be an SS inspection team in the center of the counting area. We should put\nthe dress over the right arm, and walked passed the three SS man as fast as possible, and one\nof them motioned with a stick or a riding whip, a leather whip, right left, right left. We later\nfound out that one of them was Dr. Mengele, which we did not know. We had never heard of\nhim, and it had no meaning to us until it was explained probably several years later, or a year\nlater.",
        "A: Yes. No, they said that one of them was Dr. Mengele, but we did not know who he was or\nwhat he was, and we were given another rag and a pair of random shoes. I got a size eight\nshoes; I wear a six. And we were put into cattle cars, and when they stopped two or three\ndays later, I stood on Dr. Singer\u2019s daughter\u2019s shoulders and I looked out through the little slit\nin the cattle car, and I said, \u201cYou know what? We\u2019re near Hamburg.\u201d And then she went up\nand she looked and she said, \u201cNah, just green landscapes; nothing Hamburg here. You\u2019ve\nlost your mind. It\u2019s been hot too long.\u201d And the cattle car opens up, and we were housed in a\nwarehouse of the outer harbor that housed Czech women on the other side. It housed some\nmen from various occupied countries, and they were all used for forced labor in the\nDeutschebef Blomenforce (ph), the defense industry shipyards, cleaning up the bomb damage\nin and around Hamburg. And even Dessauer Ufer was not a concept because it was the\naddress of a harbor area which to me had no meaning. It was not residential. But when they\nstarted us by truck or mainly in the subways in a corner, taking us to the worksites, and we\nhad on these rags and across the rag was a yellow painted-on stripe, and underneath the\nfabric was cut out so you couldn\u2019t run away \u2014 no stars, no nothing. Some had a purple\ntriangle, but very few. That I realized that indeed it was the surrounding of Hamburg, and for\na minute I thought, \u201cSince I know the area, I could get away.\u201d But how? To whom? Where?\nFood? And then I realized that this was ridiculous. So, they then transferred us to another\ncamp and in a now very fashionable area in Wedel where the mayor of the city lives, and\nthere is one of these temporary houses left as a memorial, and we were guarded by 42 SS\nmen and women. They needed people in the office to keep records of the SS personnel and of\nthe people in the camp. There was a young lawyer from Poland, Sophie Kalishinska (ph) and\nI, we spoke German, who got sent to the office. We had the disadvantage that the commander\nof the camp came from Southern Germany and used to be a gardener in civilian life, was\nvicious. He would come in and he would kick us with his boots. We had bloody legs and\nbloody arms, but for a while we didn\u2019t go out to work in the rain, but we took a daily beating.\nThe SS women had no compassion, no understanding. There was no typewriter. Everything\nwas written manually with a pencil, not with ink. I do not know why. Most of these SS\npeople had been drafted late in the war; they had been civil service employees before the\nwar. For the most part, they were uneducated. The women were vicious, some of them. The\nmen \u2014 some were vicious, some were not so bad. They brought in three women from Prague\nto be in charge of the camp, to be kapos. They couldn\u2019t speak Polish, but they managed\nGerman, and the story of these three women is another story. They brought in one woman\nwho was tiny, it\u2019s also another story. We couldn\u2019t tell how old she was. She probably was in\nher late \u201930s, but she ran around like a frightened mouse, and rumor had it that she was an\nMD by training. She came from Romania, and she was in charge of the hospital room, but\nnobody dared ever use it. It was used once for an abortion for a girl who became pregnant on\nthe worksite, and Dr. Gisa and I met in the latrines where we would talk a few minutes, and\nthen she would go her way and I would go my way. She had worked for Mengele in\nAuschwitz, and she did the abortions at night so the women could live and the babies died.",

        "A: Yes, she was in the same camp, and there were 500 of us. She came to New York, and I saw\nher one more time after the war. I know she went to Israel, and I know she died. The camp\nwas not the worst possible place. One of the SS women took the young woman who cleaned\nthe SS barracks and me in a truck to Hamburg to pick-up provisions. We saw the bombed\ncity, and she stopped at a building in front of the building that used to be upper-middle class\nneighborhood apartments \u2014 wrought iron balconies and a lot of stucco work, very pretty. And\nshe told us curtly to get out of the truck, moved us towards the entrance, all the way back and\ndown into the basement, and she knocked on the door and the door opened and it was her\nmother. And the mother apologized for not having food, and the young woman who cleaned\nthe barracks would come from Lodz with us. She was very small, very tiny, but very friendly\nand very obliging. She told her to lie down on the couch and she covered her up and she gave\nme a chair to sit on, but not a word was spoken. We had an hour of rest and nobody spoke. I\nmean she spoke to her mother, but we didn\u2019t speak and she didn\u2019t speak. We went back to\ncamp. We didn\u2019t tell, and we couldn\u2019t quite figure out what the story was. I think that was the\nonly kind gesture on the part of a German that I can recall. When they evacuated Sasel and\nput the gypsies there, they took us to Bergen-Belsen. Except for the overcrowded barracks\nand the dead bodies, I only remember two mountains of shoes at the gate, just empty shoes \u2014\nold and new and worn, huge mountains, and what crossed my mind was, \u201cWhere are the\nfeet?\u201d But it didn\u2019t matter anymore. After Bergen-Belsen was taken over by the British, I\nworked as an interpreter and translator.",
        "A: It was hopeless. I mean, we saw the dead bodies. We saw the typhus that was ravaging the \u2014\nwe only saw the women. We did not see the men. There was no possibility you could live\nanother month in Bergen-Belsen, and food wasn\u2019t important anymore \u2014 not the soup, not the\nbread, nothing. And one day we saw the Germans with white bands on their arms sort of\ntight, white rags. We couldn\u2019t figure out why, and another few days passed and then on April\n15\", the British stumbled upon the camp advancing towards the Elbe River to cut off the\nRussians, and they managed, but they found us, as well, and they were not prepared for what\nthey found. I worked for them almost from the first day, although I was sick a great deal. I\nhad a very good boss. He was a major.",
        "A: In that small group that managed to approach the second tank, somebody asked, \u201cWhere are\nwe? What is this? Who speaks English?\u201d And there were very few people who spoke English\nbecause, coming from Poland, you speak French, not English. So, there were five or six of us\nthat knew.",
        "A: I said, \u201cI speak English.\u201d And we showed them around the camp. In the evening he asked,\n\u201cWhat can I give you?\u201d I said, \u201cCigarettes and some biscuits.\u201d And the only thing they could\nfind for us to eat were two pound cans of pork and lard, and they handed them out, and we\nopened up those cans with stones, with metal, whatever we could find. We had no can\nopeners. Most of us ate that stuff. It was half lard and half pork, and probably came from an\noccupied country. By morning, hundreds of people were dead, among them Dr. Singer\u2019s\nwife. His daughter and I ate the biscuits and smoked the cigarettes. I continued work and I\ndidn\u2019t know when to come to work. I was allowed to pick out a watch from the storehouse in\nthe camp where they had items sorted by watches, rings, pearls, jewelry, teeth \u2014 gold teeth,\nand I picked out a little silver watch. The back was rusted. It had a black leather band. And I\nwore the watch, and I thought, \u201cIf only somebody would say, \u2018You wore my watch,\u2019\u201d but\nnobody ever did. And a few days later, my boss asked, \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d And I said,\n\u201cT would like a shower.\u201d And he provided several of us with a Red Cross woman, a little\npiece of soap and a towel. I thought I could wash away the past. I couldn\u2019t. Eventually, we\nwere given clean clothing. It took about four weeks. The barracks had to be burned down in\nvery short notice. They buried the dead with a bulldozer. The mass graves are there, 500,000\n\u2014 5,000 \u2014 I think in all, they buried 10,000 people when I was there in September. The terrain\nis immense, the terrain of Bergen-Belsen. I would say probably bigger than Birkenau, but\nnothing remains standing because of typhus. I got one picture of one barracks and I think you\nhave the original in DC. And as I worked for the British, my boss asked me, \u201cWhat did you\ndo during the war? And where did you work? And with whom did you work?\u201d And somehow\nI mentioned those two months in the office and he said, \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I\nworked on names and addresses and kept a roster of the SS and a roster of food supplies, and\nhow many women went to each work detail,\u201d because the shipyards where we worked had to\npay the government for our labor. This is what is in dispute now, if you ever see it. And he\nsaid, \u201cYou worked 1n the office, and you wrote down their names? Do you remember any?\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cAll 42 of them.\u201d He said, \u201cNo, can\u2019t be.\u201d And he gave me a pad and pencil, and I\nwrote them down \u2014 first name, last name and address.",
        "A: And address because it was in and around Hamburg. It was very easy. I had lived there. I\nknew the place. I spoke the language. He didn\u2019t believe me. It took a few weeks. He checked\nit out, and he found out that it was correct, and they took the truck or lorrie, as they called it,\nand gradually we picked up one after the other, 40 of them, in and around the city, and they\nall said, \u201c\u201cWe never did anything bad unless you deserved it. We never beat you. We never\ndid anything.\u201d Two of them were with the Americans in Southern Germany, and they were\nbrought up, and I rang usually the door bell, and I asked, \u201cIs Mrs. Miller home?\u201d And then\nher father would yell, \u201cElse Miller, somebody here for you.\u201d And, she would come to the\ndoor, and the British were right behind me. I had nothing to say. I asked that I could walk\npassed the prison, Munsevan (ph) Prison. I just wanted to see them behind bars, and they all\nbegged for help, and \u201cWe\u2019ve never done anything,\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019ve always liked you.\u201d I don\u2019t\nknow what else they said. I didn\u2019t hear a thing. I was once taken to the city of Saale (ph) near\nBergen-Belsen, and it was some sort of a preliminary deposition. I was asked whether I\nwould speak German or English, and I said English, and I had gotten a blouse and a brown\nskirt and I was driven in a staff car, in an English car. I don\u2019t remember the questions. I don\u2019t\nremember the answers. I don\u2019t know what I said \u2014 probably two hours. They thanked me, and\nthey remained in prison, and a few weeks later I received little notes under the dormitory\ndoor where we were housed threatening my life. The first one was nothing. The second one\nwas wotrisome, and the third one, I was hysterical. Three days later, the British drove me\nacross the Dutch border into Belgium, into Brussels together with three other young women,\nand from Brussels to Lille, and the captain whose drive drove us. We went out for dinner in\nLille and there wasn\u2019t much to eat in \u201945 in Lille, food was rationed. They had survived a\nwar. We ate some chicken, but it tasted like leather. I forgot. He was engaged to a young\nwoman. It turned out he was Jewish and he had been born in Berlin, and he put me on the\ntrain in Lille for Paris, and he gave me the address of the Centre de Coeur, the youth hostel,\nat quatre bis rue des Rosiers. The metro opened two hours after I arrived in Paris, and I saw a\nPolish officer in the army, and I asked him in Polish, \u201cWhich subway do I take? How do I get\nthere?\u201d I had only been to Paris once as a child. I had no idea. And he told me and he\naccompanied me, and I was back in the dormitory youth hostel, but this time it was Paris \u2014 no\nfood, the food was rationed. The little clothing I had I had to sell because I needed money.\nAnd I started visiting the American embassy. They saw me coming, \u201cThere she is again.\u201d I\nmade a nuisance of myself. I\u2019ve never hated a place as much as I hated Paris at that point. It\nwas no improvement except it had no Germans, but living was horrible. I met a young\nHungarian woman there which is again, another story, who had been married in an Orthodox\nceremony at age 12 to a young man, but it was a civil ceremony. It wasn\u2019t a chupah. That\nwas to come later, but in the eyes of the law, she was the legal wife of that man who lived in\nWilliamsburg, New York. She eventually married him in Williamsburg, but that\u2019s a totally\ndifferent story. P\u2019ll mail you that story. And we lived six of us in that tiny corner on cots with\nan outhouse two stories down, and for a bath in Paris you had to pay 2 francs and go down\nthe corner to the bathhouse. It was 1945, \u00b046.",
        "A: No, of course not. They gave me food \u2014 all starchy, I weighed 140 pounds.",
        "A: I\u2019m dying to get out of Europe. I got papers from a former classmate in New York, and I got\npapers eventually for Palestine from the British because I was showing that letter of\ncommendation wherever I could. There were no photocopy machines. They wanted to keep\nit, and I didn\u2019t want to let it go. It was a big battle. And I got the two papers within two days\nof each other, and the family decided that my cousin who was in the British brigade in\nEinhofen was supposed to marry me \u2014 marry me for real. I said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not coming to\nPalestine-\u201d",
        "A: -I\u2019m going to New York.\u201d And I paid $500 to get on a merchant marine boat.",
        "A: My uncle in Palestine sent it to a cousin in Belfort, France and it got to me. I repaid it, but a\nlong time later, with a refrigerator because they couldn\u2019t get refrigerators. It took 22 days\nfrom Bordeaux to New York because it was March, the hold was empty. There were ten of us\non the boat, and they were all, they were the Polish ambassador\u2019s sister-in-law, there was the\nfianc\u00e9 of a lieutenant colonel. They were people with considerable clout and we landed in the\nFulton Fish Market after 23 days, and I was sick all 23 days. And my friend, her parents kept\nme on their living room couch for a week, and they told me to get a job in a glove factory and\nget myself a rented room. I earned $30 a week piece work, $5 went for taxis. I paid $8 for\nrent, and I was ready to go back to Europe. I hated it. There was nothing in New York that\neven remotely appealed to me.",
        "A: Really. That\u2019s how lonely it was, how isolated \u2014 I mean, I spoke the language, but there was\nnothing there. Everything I knew, everything that was familiar was in Europe. God did I hate\nthat work in that glove factory. I loved leather, but I hoped I\u2019d never see leather again, and I\nworked.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t get an apartment. I got a furnished room on Long Island, on Woodside Avenue.",
        "A: I commuted in for a nickel on the subway, and for another nickel, I bought sort of a chocolate\nsquare, chunky-something. That was breakfast. For lunch, I went to Chock-Full-o-Nuts, and I\nbought a cream cheese sandwich and a coke and it cost a quarter, and any money I had left\nover went for clothing. I went absolutely clothing crazy. I didn\u2019t care if the dress cost $10 or\n$15, I just \u2014 I just had to buy it. So, anytime I\u2019d save some money, I would buy a dress, and\nI\u2019d buy shoes in the cheapest shoe store, it was a chain in New York.",
        "A: Bakers \u2014 very high heels, and I bought them a half a size smaller instead of buying a six, I\nbought a five and a half. Why? I will never know.",
        "A: Of course it did. I bought several pairs over a period of time, and then my friend who had\nsent the papers invited me \u2014 rather her mother did \u2014 for Friday evening Shabbat dinner\nbecause my friend\u2019s father was somewhat conservatively religious, old-fashioned \u2014 not very,\nbut a little.\n[Break in tape]",
        "A: And there was my friend and her husband \u2014 she had married early, I think at 17 or 18 \u2014 and\nshe was quite disturbed at the time. I don\u2019t know what the problems were, and nobody ever\nasked me, \u201cWhere have you come from? What had you done? Where had you worked?\u201d\nNothing \u2014 the past was a taboo in New York. It wasn\u2019t mentioned. It wasn\u2019t addressed.\nNobody wanted to know. They saw the newsreel, nobody spoke. And at that party was my\nfriend and her husband, her brother and his wife, and her brother\u2019s friend. And we had dinner\nand I guess we were introduced, and at one point his last name was dropped because at first it\nwas only first names, and when I heard \u201cEichengreen\u201d, the name was familiar. I had met the\nEichengreens on the way to the ghetto.",
        "A: And Julius, and they had spoken of a son who was in Cuba and would go to the States. I\nasked him about his parents and the answer was very evasive. He had just come out of the\narmy, and then several weeks later he called \u2014 or he called my friend\u2019s mother and he asked\nwhere exactly had I come from? Or was I in Hamburg? Had I heard anything about his\nparents? And I called him back and I said, \u201cProbably.\u201d And I met him again for dinner at that\nhouse, and after dinner we walked from Sunnyside, Long Island \u2014 no, it wasn\u2019t in Sunnyside.\nIt was in Rego Park \u2014 we walked back to Sunnyside. It was about a three-hour walk and I\ntold him the whole story. It was, I think, the only time we ever talked about it. We started\ndating, and that must have been April or May.",
        "A: The waste \u2014 the waste of a family. We started dating in May and he made me go to evening\nschool. At least I learned to type and take some shorthand. In July, we went to see his cousins\nin Los Angeles, and I liked them, cousins on both sides of the family, on the mother\u2019s side\nand on the father\u2019s side. The mother\u2019s side is partly Dreyfuss and Reinsburg and the father\u2019s\nEichengreen. And on the train from New York to Los Angeles, he proposed, and I said I had\nto think it over, and I thought it over and I said yes. It took a few days, but his aunt and uncle\nin New York and his many cousins in New York made one statement which they haven\u2019t\nlived down yet. \u201cWe don\u2019t need an Eastern European Jew in the family, and we don\u2019t need\nsomebody from the camps.\u201d The irony of that remark was that all the other cousins married\nEastern European Jews, but many years later. I was just the first one. And of course, there\nwas no contact. I did not want to see them or visit them. There was very little contact.",
        "A: No, those are strangers in the family. The family lived in Washington Heights.",
        "A: And at 69\" Street. Very rarely, once when they came to California, but not \u2014 basically no.",
        "A: Of course, we are still. When we go to Berlin today, we are still Ostjuden. There\u2019s a decided\ndifference. I spoke to people now in Germany whose parents came from Lodz, but they were\nborn after the war like my children. They consider themselves German, and I said, \u201cJust\nscratch the surface. You\u2019re a Polish Jew kid.\u201d",
        "A: No, they didn\u2019t really say it, but they were interested.",
        "A: They were interested.",
        "A: No, about the same time. He was very well read. He was very well educated. He saw that I\nread all the right books at the right time, and he brought them. He worked for Baker & Taylor\nin New York, which was the largest book distributor on Fifth Avenue down on 14\" Street or\nsomething. He was an export manager. He took me out for dinner. I could eat decently rather\nthan makeshift. He took me to Carnegie Hall. He took me to the theater. He took me to the\nopera. And I took him to the Yiddish Theater on Second Avenue. I think it was the first time\nhe heard of Saul Tomaszewski. His grandson now conducts the San Francisco Symphony \u2014\nTilson Thomas \u2014 still Tomaszewski.",
        "A: Yes, life changed. We found an apartment. We paid key money or black money because you\ncouldn\u2019t get anything. We started out in a room the size-",
        "A: After the war, there were no apartments in New York. You \u2014 we paid about $75 for a little\nglass enclosed porch and could use the kitchen and the bath of the landlady, and eventually\nsomebody told us, \u201cThere\u2019s an apartment vacant in Sunnyside, and if you give the\nsuperintendent $500, he will let you have the apartment.\u201d And we did. It was a lot of money\n\u2014 it was a lot of army pay. We got married in Washington Heights in the rabbi\u2019s house. Dan\u2019s\nfamily did show up. Only an old friend of my mother\u2019s showed because there was nobody\nelse, and my classmate, and we went for three days in a hired car to Goshen, upstate New\nYork, because we had to get married on a Thursday because we had to go back to work on\nMonday.",
        "A: November 7, 1946.",
        "A: We-Ichanged jobs, and I started to work for Lionel. Do you remember those big toy trains?",
        "A: That whistled when you threw a little pill in it, and it smoked? And it went around the track?\nI worked for the export department of Lionel. I learned to type.",
        "A: Not...90 words a minute.",
        "A: I learned to operate a Dictaphone. In those days we had Dictaphones, no computers, and I\nworked there from \u00b046 to \u201949, and then an old friend colleague of my husband\u2019s came to New\nYork, and he had started a small business in San Francisco, and he said, \u201cPack up your car\nand come out. You will work for me and I'll give you $75 to start with a week,\u201d which was a\nlot of money. And we picked up the Plymouth and we drove out. First we had a \u00b039\nPlymouth, then we had a *45, \u201946 Plymouth.",
        "A: And we drove in three days from New York to San Francisco, day and night. We drove\nstraight through.",
        "A: No, we couldn\u2019t afford to, and the whole back was all full of whatever we had in clothing,\nand I had a little portable sewing machine for some odd reason, and a portable typewriter,\nwhich with covered key, I\u2019d learned to type. I got a job in San Francisco at Westinghouse,\nand I needed FBI clearance because they were dealing with turbines and generators and\nwhatever we had to use against the Russians in those days, and it was a very uptight\norganization. There was not another Jew in the whole organization, but it was pleasant and I\nthink I made something like $300 a month which was a lot of money in 1950, and Dan\nwanted children very much, and I was very undecided, but we had the first child in 1952, and\nI stopped working for a while.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t want to.",
        "A: No, not into this world, and we bought a lot in Berkeley because Dan\u2019s boss lived in\nBerkeley, and we build a two-bedroom house \u2014 a redwood house with a view of the Golden\nGate Bridge, and then we decided we ought to have at least two children, and then we add\ntwo rooms and a bath.",
        "A: Then it was okay.",
        "A: Because life had meaning. Life had normalized. I accepted the past. I resented the past, but I\naccepted the past, that it was a part of me, and I asked myself whether I could live without\nthe past, and I couldn\u2019t. So, it was all right. The kids grew up in Berkeley, and I went back to\nschool. I went first to the college of arts and crafts, and then went to Contra Costa College,\nand then I went to UC. It took a long time. And then I went to Golden Gate College, and I\nfinished the business courses, and I got a job as an insurance broker, and I worked there for\nabout 20 years, which made it possible to send the kids through college without having to\ntake out a loan. It gave the kids music lessons, tennis lessons, riding lessons \u2014 you name it,\nthey had it.",
        "A: Dan worked for this old friend. It was a fairly successful business. They made modern\nfireplace equipment. They manufactured it. It was a very time consuming job, a demanding\njob because the man was very difficult, very uneducated, very unschooled, from a very poor\nfamily in Germany. The father rolled cigars for a living, and he also was an alcoholic. The\nmother was Orthodox. But somehow the contrast between these two men made the business\nwork, because Dan was level-handed. He was volatile. He also became an alcoholic as he\nbecame affluent, and Dan had to carry him to bed when they went on a business trip. We\nwent a couple of times to New York because there was a show at the \u2014 Columbus Circle I\nthink. And life turned normal.",
        "A: Thank you.\nTape 7",
        "A: These are my parents \u2014 Benno and Sala Landau in 1922.",
        "A: They were married twice as you have to do in Europe. First in a public office, and then a\nJewish religious service.",
        "A: These are my parents when they went with me to Sombor in Poland to visit my grandmother,\nand it was between 1928 and 1929.",
        "A: This is a group on the beach at the Baltic Sea, probably 1928. My father is second on the left.\nMy mother, second row on the right, and I am way in front \u2014 the little girl who covers her\nface.",
        "A: Yes, I believe so.",
        "A: I believe so.",
        "A: This is at the North Sea. I believe 1t was Dumen (ph), probably 1932, where I sit in the sand\nwith my little sister.",

        "A: I like the matching dresses.",
