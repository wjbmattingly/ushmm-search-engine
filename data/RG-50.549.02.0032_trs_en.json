        "Question: Okay. United S --",
        "Answer: [indecipherable] hold this in your hand?",
        "Q: Yeah, it just props up like that. United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and\nToby Herr collection, this is an interview with Fred Bachner, conducted by Melissa\nBlock, on January 10th, 1999, in Summers, New York. This is a follow up interview to a\nUnited States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr\nfor making this interview possible. This is tape number one, side A. Okay, that\u2019s the\ntechnical stuff. P\u2019Il hold this and it -- that\u2019s okay.",
        "A: It\u2019s all right.",
        "Q: No, that\u2019s okay, Pll -- Pll get it, cause it\u2019Il be a long time. I wanted to ask you first if\nyou can talk about where you were when the war ended.",
        "A: When the war ended, I was in the vicinity of Dachau, near Munich, where I was\nliberated and met the American troops, who liberated me, actually. And I found out the\ncreation of a Displaced Person camp, by the name of Feldifing, which I did not join. I had\nthe accommodation in the village where I was liberated and after being separated with\nmy -- with my brother and friend from the Jewish community, we felt lonesome and\nproceeded to look for some places in Munich, to settle for time beings.",
        "Q: Okay, walk me through that a little bit. You had been on a train with your brother and\na friend?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And what -- what were their names?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember the name of my -- of my friend, but my brother\u2019s name is James\nBachner and I happened to meet him in Dachau, af-after I survived the Death March out\nof Auschwitz in January 1945.",
        "Q: Okay, so you were be -- you were being liquidated from Dachau on a train, you\njumped off the train and how did you hear that American troops were coming? How did\nyou realize that you were free?",
        "A: Well, excuse me, you could see the chaos that started by the airplanes that started to b-\nbombard the vicinity where the train was moving and the railroad tracks and the train\nitself slowed down. And it was a wooded area and the troops liquidated their post, from\nthe top of the railroad cars and it was sort of a chance to take, now or never. So that what\nwe took and thank God, we were successful. And we were in the water there, where --\nwhere we were confronted by some French prisoner of wars, who helped us by changing\nour prison uniforms. And then we were -- we hid in the woods and -- until we met the\nAmerican troops, so, two or three d -- two or three days later, until the fighting finally\nstopped, and we sa -- went out from the woods onto the open streets and we were stopped\nby a American patrol, who took us to a POW camp and then we were interrogated, and\nset free.",
        "Q: You were set free, do you remember how you felt when they approached you? Were\nyou afraid, did you -- did they know who you were? You weren\u2019t wearing prison\nuniforms, you said, you had regular clothes on?",
        "A: No, no, no, no, we\u2019re -- oh, you -- no, I\u2019m sorry, when we -- when we met them, we\nwere in civil uniforms, that\u2019s correct, but we were recognized by the hat -- that we had no\nhair on -- it was shaved in a certain way that the prisoners were, by a -- sort of a center of\nthe head, the street, that was left a little bald down to the skin and next to it, there were a\nlittle bit of hair, so it was recognizable as a street or a mark to be a prisoner. And we had\na hard time to the convince the -- the people, the soldiers that we are Jews, because they\nwere -- believed that the -- all the Jews were killed. And we choder -- we showed them\nour numbers on the arm and then they still didn\u2019t believe it, and they ask us when the\nJewish holidays are, which we knew and answered them and then they finally said yes,\nyou know, and t-took us into the Jeep and drove us to headquarters, where we met the\ncolonel, who instead -- interrogated us about the German troop movements and the camp,\nfrom Dachau itself, the location and the -- whatever we knew about the camp, we told\nthem, which wasn\u2019t very much, because within the camp, we had no knowledge what\nwas going on outside the camp. So we couldn\u2019t be, in that respect, any great help.",
        "Q: Hm. How long were you questioned for?",
        "A: Oh, I would say about a half an hour.",
        "Q: And do you remember how they received you? Were you -- Were they warm to you,\nwere they suspicious? What was their attitude?",
        "A: Well, at first, like I said, they -- th-the patrol who met us was suspicious, and they had\nall the rights of being so. And then, when we were at the headquarters, the people\nwarmed up towards us and they took us to the POW camp, which was nearby, and they\nask us whether we will -- would like to stay in the POW camp, wh -- or whether we\nwould like to have some private accommodations, which we naturally choose to be -- to\nhave the private accommodations, because there was more -- better than the POW\naccommodation --",
        "Q: How\u201d",
        "A: -- the POW camp accommodation.",
        "Q: And where was this? Where were you?",
        "A: To be honest about it, I -- I don\u2019t -- I -- I -- on the map I could locate it, but I don\u2019t\nremember the name, whether it was Shwabingin or whether it was nearby\n[indecipherable] where -- that wa -- it was -- it was not very far out from -- from Munich,\nbut I would say about a hundred miles or so and that\u2019s -- that\u2019s where we were and that\u2019s\nwhere Feldifing, the DP camp also is, close to Munich.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And you were how old, and your brother, about, was how old?",
        "A: I was -- Well, it was 1945, I was 20 years old and my brother was 23.",
        "Q: Okay. Now, somehow -- How did you end up in the DP camp and tell me about what\nthat was like?",
        "A: How? I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Q: How did you get to the DP camp and -- and what was that --",
        "A: Well, we -- you know, it\u2019s a funny thing nowadays, in 1999, I would say, things are\nmore electronically and -- equipped. Those days it was word to mouth and it worked very\ngood, I must say, because people were constantly on the move. Everybody was looking\nfor somebody and traveling and moving and meeting. And everybody had the story to\ntell, and that\u2019s how we found out from people that we met, who told us about that\nparticular camp and we pursued to find out who, if any of th -- our friends or\nacquaintances from the camp were in the -- in that particular camp. I was not in Dachau\nper se, in the main camp, but I was in a satellite camp, that we were transported in that\nparticular train.",
        "Q: So it sounds like, for a period there, before you went to the DP camp, you and your\nbrother were sort of on your own?",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. We were isolated from any news and from any friends or\npeople of Jewish contact, and that\u2019s why my brother traveled into Munich, to see what is\ngoing on there and 0 -- upon his return, we waited a week or so and then we decided that\nit would be better for us to be where the Jewish population is, despite the fact that we\ncould have had a very substantial German factory and property from the Nazi that was --\nevacuated the house, which we occupied after his leaving.",
        "Q: Well, tell me about that. Wa -- This was after you\u2019d been interrogated? How did you\nend up where you did?",
        "A: Well, after we left the -- after we left the DP camp -- not the D -- the interrogation,\nsee, and we were told -- we told the commander that we would like to be on our own, and\nnot in the POW camp, he instructed the lieutenant to take care of us and to give us some\naccommodation. And he took us into the marketplace and comma-commanded to meet\nthe mayor from the town. And he met the mayor of the town in a short while and he\ninstructed the mayor, without any doubt, that he has three Jewish survivors and they are\nnot going to sleep on the street and to provide us with a comfortable home and food and\nall that. And as -- they gave an -- an -- an hour\u2019s time. And we waited an hour and then\nhe came back and he said that he found a home for us which -- and he\u2019s going to take us\nthere and give us a woman to care for us and provide us with anything that we want and\nneed, which actually took place. After we took the house, we looked around, there were\nthree bedrooms and we took all the beds, pillows and all that into one bed and for the first\ntime in our life, we slept comfortable and warm, and it was the first time that we really\nslept in -- un-undescribable. Now, this house became the meeting point for the Jewish\nsoldiers that were in that particular camp, the POW camp. There was also a detachment\nfrom the Israeli army there, as prisoner of war, who served as the English army. And I\nwould say that it was -- it was a comfortable time that we spent there with these people\nwho had an opportunity to meet us and they brought us army rations and it was quite\nremarkable.",
        "Q: That is remarkable. I mean, this was very soon after --",
        "A: Days -- Days after, days after.",
        "Q: So you had gone from being a prisoner on a packed transport train, to being\ncompletely on your own, in a house with -- I mean, I\u2019m just trying to imagine what that\nmust have felt like, to make that leap so quickly.",
        "A: Well, it sust felt like -- like being newborn and you started your life over from the\nbeginning and you met people, and you -- that you never figured you\u2019re going to meet\nagain, and -- you know, and it was a camaraderie, it was -- unde-undescribable.",
        "Q: Did you trust? I mean, you were still among German people at this point. Did you\ntrust them?",
        "A: Well, to be honest about it, I trusted them as far as ca -- I can throw them, which isn\u2019t\nvery far, but a -- I -- I -- Is -- I sort of felt I had the upper hand at this particular time,\nbecause I knew that the American had everything un -- occupied and I -- I felt that there\nwas very little that they could do, in order to do anything physically, or any other which\nway.",
        "Q: Did you -- Did you witness any treatment of how the POW\u2019s were being treated by\nthe al --",
        "A: No, no, it was -- it was afte-after the war, there were na -- no German soldier\u2019s\noccupation visible. The American were in hundred percent control and all you can see is\nwhat -- what I knew were -- how -- how a camp, the concentration camp looked like, it\ndidn\u2019t look like a concentration camp, but it looked like a camp and you know, one camp\nor the other, there\u2019s no -- not much -- any big difference. The only thing different was\nthat they had bunks, which we didn\u2019t have in the camp, and they were treated different\nthan we were, and there was -- there was a difference in the camp, in the treatment and\nthe accommodations that they had in the POW camp than I had in -- in the concentration\ncamp.",
        "Q: Did you see any collaborators or perpetrators being tracked down -- rounded up,\nanything like that?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t see anything of that nature. Although, in Munich, the -- there\nwere some Jewish kapos. That means Jewish people who obtained preference of ser --\nsupervising the Jewish working force and -- and used their force by beating Jewish\npeople as well as the Germans. And if they came and were recognized, they suffered the\nconsequences.",
        "Q: What do you mean?",
        "A: Well, you know, if somebody came in there and the -- the -- and somebody recognized\nthem, and people suffered under the -- under their treatment, they had now an opportunity\nto get even with them. So, to what extent I cannot describe, because sometimes they were\nbrutal and sometimes they were not as brutal. So it -- it all depended upon the -- the\nforce. It could have been two people, it could have been 10 people who -- who were\ntogether and suffered, you know, and they got even with them. But it was, in my opinion,\nthe -- in my o -- in my opinion, legitimate and it was r-right to -- for the revenge. So, it\ndidn\u2019t happen very often, so, you know, it is -- 1t is a matter of -- that the card -- the card\nhave turned. You know, it is a -- a fact that the people never thought that they going to\nface the -- the facts, and the day of judgment came.",
        "Q: This was in Munich, you said?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And you -- you saw -- you saw this? Did you witness some of the [indecipherable |",
        "A: At occasions I did, yes.",
        "Q: Can you think of one that you remember, in particular?",
        "A: Well, the -- I -- I remember two or three of them in Munich, you know. In Munich, it\nwas a -- a point, you know, a meeting point and that was the Munich museum. And th-the\nJewish people met there, because it was a very large place where you could congregate. It\nwas not within the traffic, it was out of the -- out of sight and that\u2019s where people met and\nit was known all over Europe. So even people from Italy and Poland, or whatever, you\nknow, they heard about and that\u2019s -- if they looked for somebody, that\u2019s where they went\nto see and meet people. And that\u2019s where -- where these things happened, you know, and\nit didn\u2019t take much, because there were a lot of people there, to create the -- the -- you\nknow, tumult. And that\u2019s -- that\u2019s where it happened.",
        "Q: Go ahead, sorry.",
        "A: Now, it -- it also happened at the Jewish office in -- in -- in Munich, where people met\nto register for certain purposes, and there was also a meeting point there, so it also\nhappened there, but not very often.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: It happened more at the Jewish mu -- at the -- not Jewish, but at the museum in\nMunich. So, it was a very knowledgeable point and it was very well done, I must say.",
        "Q: What -- What would happen when they were recognized?",
        "A: Well, they were physically attacked and beaten and that\u2019s all. They were not shot or\nkilled or some like that. But they were beaten up. They got their -- their point -- their --\ntheir point across in that -- that respect.",
        "Q: D-Do you remember hearing of them say anything in -- to justify or defend\nthemselves, to how they\u2019d behaved?",
        "A: Well, naturally they -- they -- everybody who gets attacked or something like this,\nalways says something to defend themselve, but the -- the main issue was that they said,\nyou know, \u201cWe were just prisoners like you and somebody had to do it, and we were\nselected, so we had to do it.\u201d But, you know, there\u2019s a difference, like the same thing\nwith the Germans, that you can do something, and you can do it two ways. You can do it\njust to do it or you can put some personal hatred and force behind it and make it worse\nthan it could be. And that is the issue and that\u2019s what they did, because the same thing the\nGermans, I mean, they we -- they were soldiers, but they were soldiers to defend\nthemselves, but to go and put the personal atro-atrocity in the -- 1n -- in the -- in the\nmovements, in the facts, that what killed so many people.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Hitler did it. Hitler said to -- to arrest the Jews and put them in camps. And he --\nSomebody else say, \u201cWell, while they in the camps, why don\u2019t you kill them?\u2019 And\nthat\u2019s what they did, you know, they just carried it further and further, so it was more\npersonal hatred 1n it, than there was a -- more of to carry out -- to carry out an order.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. I jumped ahead of myself a little here. You were in the -- the house in\nthis -- is it a small town? It was a small town?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How long did you stay there and how did you -- di -- wa -- did you have money? How\ndid you get by?",
        "A: Well, at that time, money was no object, because we didn\u2019t get any money. We didn\u2019t\nneed any money because the food we needed to live on, we got from the soldiers and\nfrom the German, t -- who had to look for our well being, so that part, there was no -- no\nneed for. We -- We got some shirts and dresses and all that from the POW, which at the\ntime, one shirt was enough. We didn\u2019t live like -- like you live today, that you change\nyour shirt every day. And our job for the time after the war, where there was nothing\navailable and everything that we had was -- for us was appreciated and grateful, because\nwe were in the camp, we had only one shirt on for months and months and months and\nwe were full with -- with the lice and all that, so 1-1t was hundred percent improvement.\nSo we sort of kept -- kept going.",
        "Q: All right. Were you -- Do you remember what it was like? Do you remember the first\nthing you ate that tasted good, after having such horrible, horrible, and virtually no food\nduring the war?",
        "A: Well, we were very lucky, because in the POW camp, there was a doctor and he told\nus and warned us not -- not to eat too much and to overeat, because our stomach was not\nin -- in the condition to absorb a lot of foods and especially not any fat food. So we took\nthat -- took it under advice and we contained ourselves to dairy products and -- and it\nworked, because -- well, it didn\u2019t work with me, but 1t worked, because I later on found\nout that I had -- have a peptic ulcer and when I came to the United States, I found it out\nand, you know, and -- but, by and large, a lot of people died after the war, from being fed\nby the English army, more food and fat food than they should have had. So there was a\nlot of people that died after the war, on account of the liberation and eating things that th-\ntheir stomach was not equipped to handle.",
        "Q: Do you remember what you ate? Anything come to mind, that --",
        "A: Well, I ate like a -- the -- like you call today, oatmeal and grits -- grits, and pudding\nand milk. A lot of cheese. Not much butter, and eggs and a lot of vegetables. And that\nhelped me to stay a little bit healthy than the -- than the other people were after the\nliberation.",
        "Q: Yeah. Did you mention something about a Nazi factory?",
        "A: Yes, there was a -- there was a farm attached to this house -- not directly to, but it\nbelonged to the house and there was a wood -- wood sawing factory, belonging to the\nowner of the house and that was up for grabs, because the -- he liquidated it -- not\nliquidated it, he left the -- there -- vicinity of his -- you know, na -- in other words, he\nescaped the -- the consequences of being a big German officer or whatever in -- in the\ntown. So, they said, \u201cWell, he\u2019s not going to come back, maybe he\u2019s dead,\u201d and so on, so\non. But it was just after the war by hearsay and I don\u2019t know how it would have worked\nout once a nephew would have returned or something like that. But, I would have had the\ngood chance, if I would afford it, to -- to be the owner of it, because he was a high\nranking German.",
        "Q: Do you know about how long you stayed in that house, before you left for the DP\ncamp?",
        "A: We stayed in that house about, I would say a month or so, or maybe a week longer\nthan that.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Because it started to get a little nudgy to be by ourselves and in those days there was\nno television or anything of that nature that we knew or seen what\u2019s going on in the\nworld, other than the radio and the contact with the army personnel, which at that time\nalready, has dwindled down to people were -- were being repat-repatriated back to\nEngland and America and it got less and less people. And the camp was just about to\nbeing resol -- dissolved, and wefe -- we seen the trend and seen that we would be -- is\nonly -- would only have association with -- with a German at that -- at that particular\ntime, we didn\u2019t care much about it, to be with the Germans.",
        "Q: So, it was your brother who found out about the -- about the DP camp? He went to\nMunich and found out about that?",
        "A: Well, he went into Munich, like I mentioned before and he met some people that we --\nknew about it. And they said, \u201cWhat are you doing out there? You are all by yourself,\nwhy don\u2019t you come and join us,\u201d you know, and -- and that\u2019s what we did.",
        "Q: And where was the camp?",
        "A: It was not the camp, it was --",
        "Q: The DP camp. No?",
        "A: No, no, no, it was not the DP camp, it was in the city of Munich, and it was ina\nprivate house that we got a -- what was it, it was two rooms and that also was that a big\nGerman officer who left and his wife was there and she remained in the house and we\njust occupied two bedrooms. And that\u2019s where we stayed til we left Munich.",
        "Q: I see, okay. How long, about, was that, would you say?",
        "A: Well, it was -- I le -- I came in \u201845 to Munich and I left Munich in \u201846, but at the -- at\nthe interim, I located my father and I bought him over to Munich and we moved into a\ndifferent house, in Munich.",
        "Q: Okay, I want to ask you about that, but I need to turn the tape over.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nFred Bachner. This is tape number one, side B. Got to remember where I was. Tell me\nabout finding your father. How did you do that? How did you even know he was alive?",
        "A: Well, it is a unique -- unique s-situation. You know, like I mentioned before, that\nword of mouth can work just as well as a radio or a tel -- not a te -- yeah, even television,\nbut the only difference is that it takes longer and it is not instantly. My brother was going\non the -- was at that museum and a person approached him that we knew from before the\nwar, and said, \u201cWhat are you doing here? Your father is looking for you.\u201d And he was\nastonished and said, \u201cMy father is looking for me, and I am looking for him. So where --\nwhere is he, where can I find him?\u201d So, he gave us the location where the village where\nmy father was, where he met him and he spoke with him. So, the next day, my brother\nsays -- not the next day, but the same day, my brother said, \u201cI\u2019m going to find Father and\nI\u2019m going to see what I can do to bring him here.\u201d So, at that particular time, there was\nno transportation yet available. They had no airplanes, the train was not going and it was\nonly going with the help of the American army. So, we went to the DP camp, to the\nofficer in charge and told him what we -- what we found out, that we need some help and\nto give us a note that the American army should help us and take us along whenever\npossible, which they did. But, there were trains going -- there was one train going in the\nmorning in that direction where we had to go. So instead of standing in the street with the\nthumb, my brother took a train in the morning, for Munich, at six o\u2019clock. And people\nwere hanging on on the train outside and inside and any -- any which way. You never\nseen a train with people like that -- was just like a Christmas tree. It -- Unbelievable,\nwhere people was -- was on the outside, hanging on, just to be on the train. So, my\nbrother took that train and then he came into a town and he had to go through\nCzechoslovakia and into Poland, because that particular part used to be under Germany,\nbut it was occupied by Poland. So, after a three day travel in all kind of ways, my brother\nfinally reached the place where my father\u2019s supposed to be. So he came there and he\nfound the address and he found the house and he found the apartment, and guess what?\nMy father wasn\u2019t there any more. My father had left back to Berlin, because he figured\nthat if we survived, we would go back to Berlin, where we originally are from. And he --\nhe came there and it was already three days that he was -- four days that he was gone, and\nthere was no mail, there was no telephone to get in touch with me, to tell me what\u2019s\ngoing on. So he started on his way back, which also took about three days. And he finally\narrived a week later, back, and I thought he would come back with my father and he said,\n\u201cGuess what? You know, I came there and there was there and Father was gone, he was\nin Berlin.\u201d So he said, now I should travel to Berlin to find him. I said, \u201cNo, you have the\nexperience. You go and you travel to Berlin.\u201d So we waited a wee -- a week and -- til he\ngot rested up [indecipherable] and then, about a week or 10 days later, he started out to\nth-the travel to Berlin and he met -- he traveled to Berlin, which also took him about\nthree days or four days and he met my father in Berlin. So --",
        "Q: Do you know how he found him?",
        "A: Well, he had the address, when he an -- when he went to Poland, to that apartment\nthere, people knew him and my father left an address, that in case somebody comes to\nlook for him, that that\u2019s where he\u2019s going to be. And he met him there and naturally the --\nthe joy was grateful and -- and my father was -- was very sick and it was a friend of his,\nwoman friend, that knew him from before the war, and cared for him. And she went with\nhim to Berlin. So, there was a big discussion about going to Munich and finally they\ndecided to do it. And the transportation and the situation started to stabilize a little bit and\nwe decided that -- to wait another month or so for them to come to Munich. So, he came\nback and then they waited a month or so and they started out to come and join us in\nMunich. And meanwhile, we got into a bigger apartment in Munich, and when they\ncame, which was shortly after, we were ready for them and had the -- had the apartment\nand all that, so it was a nice welcome and to -- to see them after all these years. And my\nfather was very sick and he -- he felt much better and you know, and he had to be nursed\nback and she did a good job on doing that. Meanwhile, they got married, by the way.",
        "Q: Oh, okay. Tell me ab-about seeing your father for the first time. Where -- Where were\nyou and what -- what happened? How -- How did that go?",
        "A: Well, the both of us were at the railroad station and we again went --",
        "Q: Both of you being?",
        "A: My brother and me -- and I, we were at the railroad station and we met them. It was a\nvery dramatic move to -- to be confronted, and you know, after all, it was about three\nyears or so that we didn\u2019t see each other and under the circumstances we didn\u2019t see each\nother was very, you know, very moving. So, we took him and you know, and we\nproceeded to the apartment. We had a dinner there and you know, and celebrated.",
        "Q: Hm. What was he sick with? Do you know what was he sick with?",
        "A: I -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t remember what it was, I -- but it was a -- he had a -- he had a --\nwith his heart he had something wrong.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: He was very sick man when he -- when he -- when we seen him.",
        "Q: Did you talk with him then, or afterwards about what you each had been through\nduring the war?",
        "A: Well, we sort slowly and surely told our stories, you know, because you know, to talk\nabout it very -- each one of us to talk about it, it takes hours for each one to tell you the\nstory. So, you know, it took days, when we were sitting down for dinner or for breakfast\nor something like this, you know, and we memorized it, you know, wh-when -- last time I\nhad breakfast in -- in this and this camp, you know, and it was like this, 1t was like that,\nyou know, and then we had to go to work outside, in March and it was raining and it was\nsnowing, it was cold, it was freezing. You know, all these things came -- came out after\nyou met and you talked. So it was a very, you know, it was a very discu -- big discussion\nevery time the subject came up and it came up very often.",
        "Q: It did?",
        "A: Yes, it did.",
        "Q: You had -- You had mentioned in your videotaped interview that you chose to get on\na transport train out of one of the camps, because you had heard your father would be\ncoming to that camp and you couldn\u2019t bear to see him mistreated?",
        "A: No, actually, actu -- actually, I was in the camp when I found out that my father 1s in\nthat next transport that\u2019s supposed to come into the camp. And knowing what I said then,\nI say that again, that you know, to be together with your father and see the atrocities that\nare being done to people, and not be able to defend yourself, I personally -- the type of a\nperson that I am, I don\u2019t think that I could s -- could stand still and -- and watch it. So, I\nchoose to leave that camp and go to -- I -- I choose -- there was an opportunity, let\u2019s put it\nthat way, which it was, you know, to leave the camp and go to another camp and not be\ntogether with my father. And here, again, I must say, you see how news travel, without --\nwithout electronic help. Without a radio and anything else, you see? It just -- that -- if you\nhave a name and you are known, and people know you, or something like that, word gets\naround and that\u2019s how I found out about it. Again, you know, that my father is on the\ntransport, you know. And 1s -- is bound -- is bound to be at the same camp, which\nactually happened.",
        "Q: Yeah. Did you tell him after the war, that you had left, knowing that he was coming?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Cause that\u2019s -- that\u2019s quite a choice to make, really, isn\u2019t it?",
        "A: Yes, yes, I told him, and he said that I did a good choice.",
        "Q: Did he say why?",
        "A: Well, I -- He didn\u2019t have to say why, because this is self explanatory, because about\nthe -- the living conditions, the -- the way it was -- you were subjected to certain\npunishments sometimes, because you didn\u2019t work fast enough and you didn\u2019t do -- walk\nfast enough and all -- all kind of things, you received beatings from the German guards.\nSo, you know every time you see somebody get sent, you know it\u2019s -- it\u2019s like -- like you\nget hit yourself, because you had to be a -- a witness of 1t and you know, it is like one Jew\nis -- 1s like your -- your brother, you know, and you feel that -- the -- the pain you go\nthrough by being treated that way. So, it is a -- a natural instinct.",
        "Q: Yeah. You -- So at this point, it\u2019s your brother, yourself, your father, his --",
        "A: My stepmother --",
        "Q: Your step -- Your stepmother. Was your friend still with you as well, or no?",
        "A: No, at that time, we -- we didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t have the friend.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: My brother had a friend from -- from -- from that time that he was in the camp with.\nHe was -- When I came into -- to Dachau, I was all by myself, because everybody I had,\nor I knew, was either not alive any more. I was walking with one friend of mine, from the\n-- on the Death March and he said -- we stopped one night in to -- in the barn and he said,\n\u201cT\u2019m not walking any more, I am going to hide here.\u201d And I told him, \u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\nyou know what they going to do, they\u2019re going to take matches and burn the barn down,\nin case somebody\u2019s hiding there. And I don\u2019t have no interest to be burned. So I -- I\u2019m\ngoing to go.\u201d He says, \u201cI can\u2019t any more.\u201d And he -- he remained 1n the barn while the\ntransport continued to walk and after the war, I met him, he made it, yes.",
        "Q: That\u2019s amazing.",
        "A: Well, he was liberated about six months before me.",
        "Q: Where did you find him?",
        "A: I -- I found him, I think it was in -- in Israel I think I found him.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Yeah, and there was a meeting of the Holocaust survivors from all over the world.",
        "Q: Oh, how interesting. Okay, so you\u2019re in Munich. At this point there are four of you, at\n-- do you -- are you looking for your mother, or have you -- do you real -- know she\u2019s --",
        "A: Well, I -- I bil -- never -- I been looking for my mother ever since, and -- but I know\nthat -- I -- I know from Auschwitz, because I know that there was a -- some person in the\n-- what they called the Sonderkommando -- that means a special detail and he worked in\nthe crematorium and he was from that particular town in Poland where we lived before\nthe war. And he knew the transport that came and he knew the people he bor -- he\nburned, and among them was my late mother. So, he told me that in Auschwitz, after --\nwhen things started to get uncertain, the people who were working in that kommando,\nwere not permitted at the time to mix with other prisoners. But a-at the -- at the time\nwhen things started to come to a end in Auschwitz, they allowed the prisoners to mingle\nwith the -- with the spi -- Sonderkommando with the special detail and he told me that --\nthat my -- that my mother was -- was burned and I got that information from some other\npeople as well.",
        "Q: How did you find that out? When was that?",
        "A: Oh, that was in 1945.",
        "Q: You found out right away?",
        "A: Well, da -- that was at -- when I still was in Auschwitz, at the end of \u201844 and \u201845, that\nwas when things started to get rough in Auschwitz and the Russian army came and they\nwere so -- sort of fi-figuring on liquidating Auschwitz.",
        "Q: I see. So you knew then. But you said you\u2019ve been looking for your mother ever\nsince?",
        "A: Well, I tried through -- through the Red Cross and tried through the several -- Yad\nVashem and all the other things, you know, register. There\u2019s no answer.",
        "Q: Just in case they were wrong?",
        "A: Just in case they were wrong, yeah, well, you know, we never give up the ho -- you\nnever give up hope.",
        "Q: Is that right?",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s right. You never give up hope, so that\u2019s what I did, what -- what I -- I\nknow pretty much that, unfortunately, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s the truth, that she -- she vanished in -- in\nAuschwitz.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Did I miss a chapter, or was there a point at which you -- your family did go\nto a -- a Displaced Person\u2019s camp?",
        "A: We did not go to a Displaced Person camp, no. We -- We -- We were in Munich and\nwe were in touch with the Jewish community. We were in touch with the Joint\nDistribution Commits -- Committee. We were in touch with the UNRRA, which was the\ndepartment from the American government and we kept abreast of all the going-ons that\nwas -- that was to be known.",
        "Q: So Feldi-Feldifing?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What was that?",
        "A: That was the name of the village -- of a German village --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- where this Displaced Person camp was established.",
        "Q: But you were not there?",
        "A: We -- We were there maybe for a day or two, that\u2019s all, you know.",
        "Q: Oh, I see, okay.",
        "A: But we seen the camp-like situations and we had enough of that, so we thought we\nfend for ourselves, what -- what you can do, you know\u201d?",
        "Q: Okay, I got you. So, you\u2019re living in Munich and how do you figure out where your\nfamily will go? What made you decide to come to the United States? What were your\nchoices at that point?",
        "A: Well, my brother and I, we were talking about it and we felt that Germany is not going\nto be nothing, it\u2019s just going to be pieces of land and [indecipherable] wouldn\u2019t be any\nfuture for us, because it is going to be a very controlled country, because what Germany\ndid and carried on and little did I know that there would be a martial plan and all the\nother things that put Germany into -- pro-propelled Germany into a top position and the\nway it is today. And today I am sorry that I did move out from -- from Germany, because\nI could have been financially the better situation to come to the United States\n[indecipherable] was. And I could have re-reaped from the fruits of the Black Market,\nand like I said, I could be in a better position in the United States as a refugee the way I\ncame than I -- if | would have waited another two years, is all.",
        "Q: Oh. So you think if you did it over again, you might have stayed?",
        "A: Well, if you ask me, then yes, I -- I -- I will say -- I will say so. Because I -- I --\npersonally left for the solid rea -- solid reason that I thought that Germany will be no\nmore Germany, it will be a poor country, it will be a -- under control. It would not be\ngiven the liberty that it enjoys today and enjoyed right after the war. And I -- I -- I must\nsay I was wrong, because politics sa -- play -- play -- are strange bedfellows. That\u2019s wa --\nThat\u2019s what it boils down to. But you cannot look into a crystal and know what -- what\nthe -- the future brings, because lot of people would commit suicide if they knew what --\nwhat -- what would happen to them in the future. But, nevertheless, the way it is, you\nknow, it is -- it\u2019s came, but 1n a -- in a different way and a harder way, that I had to learn\na lot of experience by being here in the United States.",
        "Q: So how did you -- how did you decide to come and how -- how did you get here?\nHow did that all come together?",
        "A: Well, like I mentioned before, we decided that -- that since we figured that Germany 1s\nnot going to be any more anything in the -- in -- in -- in this -- in the world, it is better to\ngo to a country which 1s going to give us some possibilities. And at that particular time,\nthere was a note at the Joint Distribu-Distribution Committee that President Truman\ngave 20,000 visas to Displaced Persons. And being that my brother was working in the\noffice of the -- of the Joint Distribution Committee, he knew about it and he registered us\nto -- to go to the -- to the United States.",
        "Q: And did that -- did it come together fairly quickly or did it take a long time?",
        "A: Well, no, it -- 1t came -- it came pretty quickly, because we were -- we got the\npermission to go in 1946, in June, but unfortunately, a seaman strike developed in the\nUnited States, and the ships did not go to the United States. So we had to wait til the\nstrike is settled and then we were able to go to -- into the United States.",
        "Q: And did all four of you come together?",
        "A: Yes, all four. We came together.",
        "Q: Tell me about that trip. Where -- What were you -- What -- What did you sail on,\nwhere from and -- and where did you land? Did you know specifically where you were\ngoing, to what harbor?",
        "A: Well, we were told to go to -- in September 1946, we were told that our ship is going\nin September to -- to United States, that we should proceed to the staging area -- area in\nBramer harbor, which we proceeded to do so. We arrived in Bramer harbor, we found out\nthat the ships are not going and we waited in Bramer harbor three months, until the sh --\nthe strike was settled, and in January third, I believe it was, 1947, we boarded the USS\nErnie Pyle, which was a troop carrier ship, and proceeded on an eventful trip to the\nUnited States. The eventfulness was that it was a stormy -- very, very stormy voyage. For\na week, we did not leave the berth. The ship was cordoned off with ropes. We could not\nmove it, because that\u2019s how the ship was moving, up and down. And the captain took a\nside trip over, to avoid the storm, to get out of it, over Canada, which was worse, because\nit was very icy there. So, in all, the trip took us about 14 -- 14 days and we arrived here in\n-- in New York, on January the 14th or 15th, 1947.",
        "Q: Tell me about that moment, you -- you sailed into New York harbor? Was that --",
        "A: Yes, yes, we sailed into New York harbor, and to see the Statue of Liberty and all that\nwas a very, very moving event and it was docked on -- I think it was on pier number 86,\nand we were greeted by the press and all that, you know. And then we were also greeted\nby the Joint Distribution Committee, who took care of us and lodged us in the Hotel\nMarseilles, on 103rd Street and Broadway. And we were really glad to feel some solid\nground under our feet and that -- that was the event of our voyage, as far as that is\nconcerned. I -- I was -- I was lucky I didn\u2019t get seasick, but 99 percent did.",
        "Q: Do you remember what you were thinking as you came into New York, seeing the\nStatue of Liberty?",
        "A: Well, all kind of thoughts went through my mind. How am I going to get a job, how\nI\u2019m going to work, how I\u2019m going to make a living, or -- you know, all these things this\ncome -- come to -- to your -- to your mind. And it is a, you know, it is, you know, it is a\nmoving, moving situation. It -- You know, it -- as a young man, you -- you -- you don\u2019t\nknow what -- what you -- I didn\u2019t have a profession and here I\u2019m 20 years old and you\nknow, it -- I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m 22 already -- am about to be 22. But it leaves -- it gives you fa -\n- some food for thought. So, we landed in va -- at the Hotel Marseilles and we met some\nother people here who came with -- two transports before, because we were only the third\ntransport to come from --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nFred Bachner. This is tape number two, side A. I wanted to ask you, you mentioned when\nyou landed on the pier, that there were press people there?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What were they doing there, and what did -- what were they asking you? What was\nthat all about?",
        "A: Well, at -- at that time, to have people surviving from a concentration camp come to\nthe United States, 1t was a rare situation, and the press ask us about our experiences in the\ncamp and about the voyage and all that, because we were way overdue, on account of the\nstorm that we had on the Atlantic. So, that was the reason there was the press there. And\nat that time, you know, to have people survive the concentration camp, it was a novelty,\nnot -- not like today. I mean, 50 years later is -- is more than 50 years ago, you\u2019re right. It\nis -- It was a novelty here, to be a survivor and the press was there, hungry to have news\nfrom -- from the concentration camp that we were -- were in.",
        "Q: Did you talk to them, do you know? Did you -- Did they interview you?",
        "A: I personally, no. I didn\u2019t talk to them.",
        "Q: And your brother and father?",
        "A: No, no",
        "Q: No. Oh.",
        "A: They selected who they wanted to talk, you know, it -- and to be honest about it, at\nthat particular time I was more interested what\u2019s going to be and where I\u2019m going, that to\nget -- to give a -- a -- an interview.",
        "Q: Yeah. How many of you were on that ship?",
        "A: I would say maybe 150 or so, ma-maybe less. It was a troop carrier and there weren\u2019t\nmany people there.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. What -- What were your impressions of New York? That must have been\nsomething, to be landing. Did you have anything with you? Did you have any belongings\nat that point?",
        "A: Perhaps a small suitcase, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s all. I mean, the -- the clothing that we\nacquired in the time that we were liberated, because don\u2019t forget, from 1945 to 1947 is\nonly three years and we were not in the -- financially in the -- in the great position to -- to\nob -- to obtain anything, and we all -- and I felt that Germany is not going to be my\nhome, so why should I go out and settle myself with things and clothing? If I go to\nAmerica, the style is not the same and, you know, so you have to get rid of it anyhow. So\nthat\u2019s why we just had a small suitcase and -- and that\u2019s all.",
        "Q: So what were your impressions of New York on that first day?",
        "A: Well, I was overwhelmed by the -- by the big buildings. Don\u2019t forget, I was -- I used\nto live in the big city, Berlin, which doesn\u2019t compare to New York, but it\u2019s nevertheless a\nbig city that I think, [indecipherable] million inhabitants. And the -- the city in itself\ndidn\u2019t make a big impression on me, just the big buildings and tall buildings and how\neverything worked, and you know, how it feels to be 1n a -- in a tall building and not\nbeing afraid of the [indecipherable] when there\u2019s a strong wind.",
        "Q: Did you have to go through any kind of medical examination? Did they -- Did you\njust go through passport -- how did tha -- how did you actually come into the country?",
        "A: We just went off the ship. That\u2019s all.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Yeah. No, no, no examination, no nothing. It\u2019s -- Went right straight -- straight\nthrough. No car -- I -- I -- I don\u2019t believe we had any customs, I don\u2019t believe that either,\nno.",
        "Q: And did you know that you\u2019d be going to the Hotel Marseilles?",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t know that we\u2019d be going to the Hotel Marseilles, but we know that we\nare going to be greeted by the Joint at the pier and they will take us to the -- to the hotel\nand they had buses to take us to the hotel.",
        "Q: Tell me about the hotel. What was that like?",
        "A: Well, it -- it wasn\u2019t the -- the -- the Park Plaza, or it wasn\u2019t the Waldorf Astoria, but it\nwas an acceptable hotel, it was -- it was nice there, the kitchen there for us, where we\ncould obtain food. And it wa -- it was occupied I think by elderly people and not the\ntransients or something like that. So, it was -- but when we moved in, it was -- it changed\ncompletely because the Joint opened an office there and people came and you know, and\nsome people found relatives and you know, they came and visited and all that, you\nknow? It did -- started to be a different -- a different picture than it was before. And, you\nknow, it -- I think that the Joint moved the hotel up in prestige.",
        "Q: Sounds like it was sort of a community for -- for survivors at that point.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. Because, well, it -- it made -- it made an impression on me like I had in\n-- in -- in Germany during the war, when we got -- not during the war, but when we got\nliberated and in Munich, the museum, that people came, they met there and all of a\nsudden, here in New York, it was the hun -- 103rd Street Hotel Marseilles. So, that\u2019s\nwhere everybody came and you know, and other things happened there, I mean a lot of\nthings happened that -- family members met there that haven\u2019t seen each other for 30 - 40\nyears. And it was quite -- I should say interesting, yes.",
        "Q: So there would be reunions of people there?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, yes, many reunions. And something happened to me personally, 1s that\nwhile we were there, we received a -- a newspaper from -- which caters to German\nclienteles and being from Germany is -- I had interest of reading it, and we notice that\nthere is a Purim dance. That is a holiday, festive, joyous holiday and they have a dance\non -- I think it was on 47th Street in New York. So my brother said, \u201cYou know, let\u2019s go\nthere and see if we meet some people.\u201d I says, \u201cYes, what-whatever I g-got to lose,\u201d you\nknow? So, we went there and lo and behold, I all of a sudden see my school friend from\nBerlin there. We -- We were buddy - buddy, you know. We used to go to school together,\nwe used to play together, w-we used to stay with each other. His parents knew me and I\nwas in their house and you know, it was a very familiar relationship. But I knew, and I\nsaid goodbye to him in Berlin when he went to Crooba. And very little did I expect him\nto see in New York. So then I -- I went there and I confronted him, he didn\u2019t know what\nto think, whether it was that the dead people got recreated or whether, you know, he\ndidn\u2019t know what to -- what to think. So, I said, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s me,\u201d and so on, so forth, you\nknow and we cu -- hugged each other and kissed each other, and you know, and the\nparents were there and it was -- it was an unbelievable picture. And with him also were\ntwo other friends that I knew, and I was befriended with and -- also from Berlin, from the\nsame class that I used to go with and we became friends again and still -- still as today,\nwe still friends, and see each other and go to each other\u2019s occasion, weddings and Bar\nMitzvahs and all that here. And that what happened. His parents passed away meanwhile,\nbut we -- we still are very much in touch with sha -- with each other. And that happens\nout of the blue sky. So, you know, it -- things -- things happen in life. Never, never\nthought that that would happen.",
        "Q: How do you explain that to yourself? I wonder if your experiences during the\nHolocaust have -- have made you think of those sort of happenings in a certain way?",
        "A: Well, to be honest about it, there\u2019s no explanation there. That\u2019s -- It\u2019s the same way I\nmet barba -- my brother, after five years in the camp, you know, I never thought it would\nhappen. And here, you know, is like -- like -- like you say in -- in Jewish, it 1s pershared,\nyou know, that it is meant for you to -- to go through this experience. So, I take it in that\nrespect. That, you know, it was meant for me to meet him.",
        "Q: Hm. So it doesn\u2019t feel like luck? It feels more determined than that.",
        "A: Luck? I -- I wouldn\u2019t say that it is. It\u2019s -- It\u2019s meant to be, you know, like some\npeople cross the street and get hit by a car. An-And so how -- how do you explain that?\nIt\u2019s being in the wrong place at the wrong time or right time, or whatever it 1s. So -- But it\nhappens and that\u2019s -- in my opinion, that\u2019s the way life 1s, so you know, it 1s a\nunpredictab -- unpredictable situation that you can -- you know, your -- you encounter in\nyour lifetime. So it is, you know, God -- God steers your way in life, and that\u2019s -- that\u2019s\nwhy you go to synagogue on Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah, you beg for forgiveness\nand beg, you know, not -- not to die in the course of fire or in -- by sword, by -- by -- or\nby a gun or so on, so forth and -- and then it\u2019s up to the Almighty -- Almighty. So this is\nthe -- a matter of, how you call, destiny, yeah.",
        "Q: I\u2019m curious, when you were -- during the war, when you were in the camps, watching\nmany people die around you, knowing that some of your family had died or not being\nsure that they died. Did you have that same sense of God means for me to survive this, or\nis it -- did you have that sort of same guiding principle in your mind at that time?",
        "A: Yes, yes, I -- I believed very much in it, because the way things have happened to me\nand the way things are in my life, you know, I always say that God is with me and -- you\nknow, and steers me the right way. So, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s one outlook I have in my life and\nnobody -- nobody can -- can -- can foresee his own destiny, because things change and\nthey can change very rapi -- very rapidly, without your [sneezes]",

        "A: Thank you -- without your having any -- [sneezes]",
        "Q: Bless you.",
        "A: Oh, I\u2019m sorry.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: -- with ha -- without having any control over it, y-you see, and there\u2019s nothing you --\nnothing much that you can do about it. You have accept it and live with it and make the\nbest of it. And that\u2019s the way I feel.",
        "Q: Were you able to -- I should have asked you this in the -- in terms of the time in\nMunich, too, but also when you came to New York -- reincorporate religion into your\nlife. I mean, did it -- did that come back quickly, or --",
        "A: Well, I must say yes, it did. Because, when the war ended, I said, what -- what is it\ngood to be and believe in God, when things have happened and I have seen and noticed\nand be par -- was part of it, that God let this happen. And believe me, I\u2019ve seen a lot -- a\nlot of atrocities, a lot of children die, a lot of innocent little children die, a lot of people\ndie and it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a time that I said, it\u2019s enough, but then I found out that without\nreligion, without believing in somebody, you can\u2019t live. So, I turned back and became --\nbecame a Jew. It didn\u2019t take long, only about four weeks or so.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What happened?",
        "A: Well, I -- I -- I felt I was missing something in my life and I knew that what I was\nmissing and I turned back.",
        "Q: Were there actually places to go worship in -- in Germany at the time? I mean, were\nyou able to participate in sort of organized religion or was it more on your own?",
        "A: Well, in -- there was a -- the army initiated the services that were every Friday night\nand so on, so forth. And then Passover came and Rosh Hashanah came and you know,\nthere was services available and all that, so I sort of participated in 1t and you know, and\nfelt that that\u2019s what it -- that is what I was missing. So, if you want to call me a return\nJew, I don\u2019t know. But, it was the -- it was the fact that -- that, you know, after all you\nsee and ask yourself, where is God? And then -- And then you miss it, then you return.",
        "Q: That\u2019s interesting to me. It sounds like there were points during the war at which your\nfaith was very deeply shaken, that maybe --",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: -- did you -- did you doubt that God existed? Did it -- How far did that go?",
        "A: Well, during the camp, I -- I -- I had -- I had occasions and instances where I was\nsaved and I could have perished and I wasn\u2019t -- I -- I didn\u2019t perish and you know, it\u2019s --\nit\u2019s -- it -- | had my -- my strength to believe that there\u2019s a God and the God 1s -- wants\nme to live and you know, that\u2019s what it is. So, at the particular time I was in camp, I\nbelieved in, but when I came out of the camp and I knew the -- the exorbant amount of\npeople who perished in the Holocaust, six million people and what they did --\naccomplished by -- by destroying the Jewish people, I sort of had my -- my second\nthought about it. But, then I found out that you have to have something to believe in. So,\nthat\u2019s when I started to be Jewish again.",
        "Q: And that was when, would you say?",
        "A: That was right after --",
        "Q: Right after the --",
        "A: -- yeah, right after, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. So, you\u2019ve come to New York, you\u2019re -- are you living still with your brother\nand father and step-mother?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: You\u2019re all in the Hotel Marseilles?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Then what happens? How -- Where do you end up and how does that all come\ntogether?",
        "A: Well, I was diagnosed to have a par -- peptic ulcer here, I was sent to a hospital to --\nfor treatments and nervous depression, all kind of other things. And the Joint tried to give\nme a job and they went as far as sent me to Rochester because I had an address there\nfrom a friend of mine -- from a friend of mine from the camp who had a sister living in\nRochester, and they gave me the address of the Joint, thought they have somebody, so\nthey sent me to Rochester and this didn\u2019t work out, I came back. They finally got us a --\ngot us in a -- an apartment in -- in the Bronx and -- and furniture and the -- so we moved\nout of the hotel to the apartment in the Bronx. And to get a job at that time was pretty\nhard, because the American soldiers started to return from the army and they all had the\nright to get -- get their job back, so it was pretty hard. And then I finally found a job and I\nwas working there 56 hours a week.",
        "Q: What was the job?",
        "A: The job was in the automobile trade, as a -- I's -- wanted to be a mechanic and they\ntold me that they will teach me to be a mechanic.",
        "Q: Is this in the Bronx?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: In the Bronx.",
        "Q: What wa -- Do you remember the company? What we [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: What was it called?",
        "A: Weissman and Company. Weissman Incorporated.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Is wa -- It was a Lincoln - Mercury dealer. And I worked there 56 hours a week for 30\ndollars a week.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: And there was a time that I felt I was working just as badly as in the concentration\ncamp. And honestly speaking, if I had money, I would -- would have returned to\nGermany, because I was just a prisoner of war here, and going to night school and I had\nto help the family maintain the apartment. We had to pay rent, we had to pay grocery\nbills and all that. And f-for me, there was little left from the 30 dollars, because taxes\nwere taken out and I was left maybe with three or four dollars in my pocket and here I\nhad my friends and we went out. Although, everything cost not like today, in 1999 that\nyou pay for a pack of cigarettes, two and a half dollars. In those days it cost 25 cents.\nAnd -- But 25 cents is 25 cents and if you don\u2019t have it, no matter what it is, it is not\nthere. And 1-it\u2019s -- it\u2019s started to -- to drain on me that what did I need it for? I could have\nbeen in Germany, I could have been being German -- not citizen, I never wanted to be a\nGerman citizen, but having certain advantages in Germany, I could have made -- made\nsome money there, better than here. And the only thing that -- what held me back, that I\ndidn\u2019t have the money for a passage on a ship. Because airplanes, tha -- those days cost\nan enormous amount of dollars and I was -- I -- I -- I was determined, you know, if I save\nenough money, I might go. But, to save money with four dollars a week, wouldn\u2019t -- it\nwouldn\u2019t go very fast.",
        "Q: Why a mechanic\u2019s job? How did that happen?",
        "A: Well, I was very much interested 1n cars. I had an uncle who had a car business in\nBerlin and whenever I had the chance to be in his shop and in his business, in the\nshowroom, it\u2019s where I was, and you know, and he sort of spent time with me and\nexplaining things at that time, and you know, it sort of caught on. I knew it -- my -- my\ndream, to become a professional was gone, because you need a lot of money for high\nschools and colleges and all that. And I didn\u2019t have anything to look forward, to obtain\nthe kind of finances that I need.",
        "Q: What was that dream? What -- What had you thought you might become?",
        "A: To become a professional, either a doctor, or -- and -- but unfortunately, I could not\nmake these dreams come true, because we had the family, we had the obligations, we had\nthe rent to pay and like I mentioned before, it\u2019s not only the rent, you h-had the electricity\nand you had, well heat was with the rent, but --",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Was your brother working as well?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: What did he do?",
        "A: My brother was a commercial artist. He painted pictures and he was decorating\nwindows and he was making signs, you know, advertising signs.",
        "Q: Now, did you speak any English at this point, when you first came?",
        "A: When I came, I spoke a few -- well, I was not completely knowledgeable in the\nEnglish, but I went in -- my time when I went to school 1n Berlin, I took -- we had\nEnglish classes, so I had English instructions and English knowledge about the alphabet\nand all these things, you know. I had the basic knowledge about the English language and\nI spoke a few words, to make myself understood. But to carry on a conversation was --\nwas not enough.",
        "Q: So, when you were working at this car dealership, you couldn\u2019t really communicate, it\nsounds like, if you didn\u2019t know much English. That must have been difficult.",
        "A: Well, like -- like I mention, I could communicate to the extent that I could make\nmyself understood, but I couldn\u2019t carry on a complete sentence. I mean, I couldn\u2019t pick\nup a telephone and answer the telephone and ca-carry on a conversation, or tha -- tha --\nthings of that nature. But I knew how to write English and I, you know -- but I wasn\u2019t\ndumb and I learned fast, so I went to -- to high school and -- on a night course, which I\ngraduated after couple of years.",
        "Q: Did you?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Wow. Where -- Where was that?",
        "A: It was the Theodore Roosevelt High School in -- in the Bronx.",
        "Q: Oh. Was that a common thing? Were there other survivors who were also doing the\nsame thing?",
        "A: Whoever wanted to, th -- went, you know, took that night school and -- and graduated\nto get a diploma, so -- so you can further yourself in your life.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. You mentioned you were treated for nervous depression.",
        "A: Well, you know, these things did not leave any -- leave a mark -- didn\u2019t leave any\nmark, because we had quite -- quite a bit of tense moments in our lives. And it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a -\n- it di -- it -- it left 1t\u2019s mark, you know, it does not just wash off your shoulder. So, you\nknow, there\u2019s certain things that were left and that had to be treated.",
        "Q: Can you talk about that at all? What -- What that -- What you went through with that?",
        "A: Well, [indecipherable] it\u2019I] take another four hours here, for me to ta -- you know, my\nlife 1s -- 1s -- is very, very complicated and a few sentences I want to -- I want to mention\nthem to you, so it\u2019ll be recorded, but when we went -- when we went from Berlin to\nPoland, and Poland was overrun by Germany, the Germans were looking for people to\ntake them and send them into the camp. That\u2019s when my brother was taken, in 1940. But,\nthere was a certain resistance in the younger people. They communicated with each other\nby t-telling -- you know, looking out the window and shouting to each other, or\nsomething like this and -- and one guy went over six houses to da -- to a friend of his and\ntold them what we heard, that there\u2019s going to be a -- a aktion tonight, that kids are going\nto be taken out of the home. So we went -- acrossed fields over to an abandoned house\nthat was miles away --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nFred Bachner. This is tape number two, side B. You were just saying there was a soap\nfactory?",
        "A: The soap factory, and we went there many a times to hide from them and then, being a\nyoung person like I was at that time and trying to do things to stay alive and know we\nhad a radio in the attic, hidden in that particular building that we were, and we were\nlistening to BBC London to get the foreign news, what\u2019s doing in the -- on the war scene,\nor on the war front. And if you get caught there, that\u2019s the end of you. To see through that\nparticular town where I lived, it was only about 15 kilometers away from Auschwitz. We\nseen the buses going through every day, with the windows painted black and yelling and\ncrying and all that. At -- That was before I got into the camp. I was in the camp, I was\nsick of typhus, which is the deathly disease. We didn\u2019t have any medications in the camp,\nwe didn\u2019t have a thermometer in the camp, le-let alone enough food to get you back to be\nstrong, and people died like flies. And in -- in Auschwitz, I was in -- in a -- when the\ncamp started to be liquidated, the doctors didn\u2019t want to go, they wanted to have a full\nsick camp, to be -- to say that we are needed, you got a full camp here, you know, sick\nbar -- sick barrack. I got into becud I -- because I had a rash on my chin. And the sick\nbarrack had two da -- two doors. One where you got in and the other one where you got\nout into the oven, to the crematorium. And I was on a transport from -- fo -- after the\nDeath March, we came into a camp which was close to the Russian border -- not Russian\nborder, but Polish, Germany border and this camp would have been liquidated in another\nweek or so, and they started to liquidate, having transports going out there, which, it was\nwintertime and yes, wintertime in the eastern section of Europe is pretty strict, is\ntemperatures below zero constantly. Snowfall is in feet measured, not in inches, and the -\n- the trans -- I was attached to a transport going to Dachau in an open car, a railroad car.\nAnd subjected to the snow, the frost and the cold and all that. And 75 percent of the\ntransport died. And when we came to Dachau, the camp commander gave us quarantine.\nThat means that we were isolated and not subject to go to work, which 1s very, very rare\nin German concentration camps. And so I -- I -- I feel that these things that happened to\nme and I just mentioned few of them, are very significantly my -- my -- my life. So, you\nknow, it is -- and then, afterwards, you know, that I -- I managed to escape from the\ntransport with my brother and getting out -- you know, when we escaped, and we ran into\nthe woods, I -- I don\u2019t want to go into details, but that -- there were -- the situation that\nwe were confronted with the German army, where they ask us, \u201cWhat are you doing\nhere? You\u2019re going towards the front. I mean, we going away from the front. What are\nyou going there for?\u201d We ran into German soldiers that were dug in, in the woods, you\nknow, to wait for tanks to come, to attack the tanks. And we also ran into a farmhouse\nthat was full of German soldiers. I mean, you know, I -- I -- I -- I got instances, more than\none, but I don\u2019t want to go into these -- these details to stretch it out, you know, to make\nit -- make it a lengthy interview and people might not be interested to listen to it.",
        "Q: Of course --",
        "A: So that\u2019s why I\u2019m just getting the most important points and tell you about what\nhappens. So that\u2019s -- that\u2019s my point of view. So, you know, it is a -- a very eventful fact\nof my life and you know, and is -- naturally it takes a t-tolls in different ways and you\nknow -- which I personally have to overcome.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. Were there people who you could talk to when you came to New\nYork? I mean, were you treated by any doctors for depression, or was there any sort of\ntherapy?",
        "A: No, no, I did not -- I was not treated by doctors for depression, it -- just time itself,\nyou know -- you know that and you know, my association with -- well, I didn\u2019t have any\nassociation which [indecipherable] with any particular Jewish group here, because I\ndidn\u2019t know anybody and I didn\u2019t -- I -- I -- ve -- I\u2019ve -- didn\u2019t have any occasion to\nhave any association, but I had people, they were working all -- they were eager to know\nwhat -- what happened and all that and I talked to them and you know, about the camp,\nthe time and all that, the same thing as I do today, I go to schools and churches and all\nthat -- colleges and talk about th-the Holocaust, so I got my s -- my satisfaction that way\nand sort of my -- my -- my psychonal -- my psychiatry treatment that way.",
        "Q: You were -- You were mentioning that when you were working so hard at the -- at the\ncar plant, that it wa -- didn\u2019t sound like a very happy time, if you were working that hard.",
        "A: It was a time that I sort of felt I had to work and I -- you know, it is -- I had to go, I\nhad to earn money, and that\u2019s what I choose to do and that\u2019s what I was successful in,\nkeeping the job and -- because there were a lot of other people looking for jobs and that\u2019s\n-- that\u2019s the way it worked out.",
        "Q: How long did you work there, and then -- then, what did you do after that?",
        "A: I worked there, I think it was three years, four years, but it was interrupted -- it was\ninterrupted by me being inducted into the army -- into the United States army.",
        "Q: Tell me about that.",
        "A: You see, I\u2019m washed with all waters.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "A: I said, you see, I\u2019m washed with all waters. I was declared -- which we all were, under\nthe orders from President Truman, to be 4F, and I was curious to know what 1s 4F and I\nwrote a card to the draft board, \u201cWh-What does 4F mean?\u201d So they answered me with a\nreport to the draft board, and the draft board said, \u201cYou are eligible for the army, now\nyou go for a physical.\u201d So I went for a physical with all kind of letters from doctors that I\nam not fit, I\u2019m sick, I got an ulcer and a nervous condition. And I\u2019m to be e-excused from\nthe army. So then I got a letter to report for induction in Whitehold Street.",
        "Q: In New York?",
        "A: In New York, yes. And I reported to Whitehold Street, and there was a Viennese\ndoctor, who said -- a Jewish Viennese doctor, who said, \u201cI now -- I realize, I see that you\nwere in a camp and -- but, I\u2019m going to put on the paper that you are sick, that you are\ndue for limited duty. But they\u2019re going to induct you.\u201d I said, \u201cWhy do you do that when\nI\u2019m a sick person?\u201d \u201cWell, if you are sick, you\u2019re going to be released from the army and\nthat\u2019s all going to be.\u201d So that\u2019s what happened. I got inducted, I went through basic\ntraining, a limited duty. The sergeant carried my bag. I got transferred to Atlanta ja -- fa -\n- I was inducted in Camp Kilmer, New Jersey. I had my basic training there. I was --\nAfter I finished my basic training, I was transferred to Aberdeen Proving Ground in\nMaryland and I was there, on limited duty, I didn\u2019t have to go on marches and parades\nand all that. And after finishing the basic training -- that was the advanced basic training\nin Aberdeen Proving Ground -- I found out that the company I was in, was slated to go to\nKorea. And after four weeks of training in Aberdeen, we will go to Atlanta, Georgia, and\nfrom there to San Francisco for shipping to Korea. So I said to myself, \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d I\nreported for sick bay every day and then they couldn\u2019t do anything more for me. They\ntook me -- well, it\u2019s a whole long story anyway, they -- they took me by the\ncommandant\u2019s car to a hospital in Georgia from the second army. I was evaluated, I was\nreturned to the barracks and I was asked to take out my personal belongings and you\nknow, stay in my bed and that\u2019s all. About two hours later, the -- an orderly came and\nsaid for me to get my bag together -- my stuff together and report to the sick bay. I went\nto the sick bay, I was put on the stretcher. About an hour later, the -- the ambulance came\nand transferred us to the airport and I was put aboard a plane with wounded soldiers from\nKorea, returning to the States. And I was -- that was Labor day weekend.",
        "Q: In what year?",
        "A: 1940 -- no, not 1940. 1951 I think it was.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I was transported, then the plane did not go to it\u2019s destination, it landed\nsomewheres 1n California, near the Mexican border, in the Air Force camp. And not\nknowing what\u2019s going on or where we going, I was permitted to get out of the stretcher,\ninto a bunk in the barrack and on Labor day, we were transported by plane to\nPhiladelphia. In Philadelphia, we were transported to another camp. I forgot the name\nright now, it\u2019s a very famous camp, but I forgot the name. It\u2019s -- Maybe I got the name.\nAnyway, I was there and I was in the bed and I was receiving no treatment and after\nbeing a week there, I was called to the commandant and he said, \u201cIf you want to get out,\nwe can give you a discharge, an honorable discharge, for the convenience of the\ngovernment.\u201d That means that I cannot get any pension from the army, that they\nageravated my -- my sickness. Well, hearing that, I was glad that I had a chance to get\nout of the army and I grabbed it and I was discharged on my birthday from the army. So,\nthat was another experience in my lifetime.",
        "Q: Well, how did that make you feel? Do you remember what you were thinking at that\npoint, about what your situation was and how you were being treated by the government?",
        "A: Well, first of all, I felt very bitter against the doctor, because I had all the legal and\nrightful documentation that I\u2019m not a person fit to be in the army. And then, I mean, the\nothers did -- did their job, but then again, President Truman issued a -- an order that the\npeople -- diplace pers -- Displaced Persons, who come from the concentration camps, not\nto be inducted into the armed services, which actually took -- happened. But me, wanted\nto know what is going on, why other people are going to the army and not me, I wanted\nto know what that 4F stands for. Is nothing wrong with finding out what is in your record\nand why -- why you are still, you know, entitled to know. So that\u2019s what happened with\nmy army. So I got in there and I would have stayed in the army if I would have been\ntransferred to Germany, but not -- not to Korea.",
        "Q: Did -- Did the -- the other soldiers who you were with, know you were a Holocaust\nsurvivor? How -- How were you treated or received by them?",
        "A: It became known, because I was sort of a special person in the -- in the company.\nEverything that had to be done, if it was a hard job to do, I was excused. And they\nwanted to know what kind of duty do I -- what kind of a soldier am I, that I am being\naccused from all these things, you know? So, I had to tell them, you know, that my past\nexperience and my condition. So, you know, the lieutenant also wasn\u2019t very comfortable\nwith it, because you know, there\u2019s somebody that\u2019s better than -- than the others, which\ndoes not make any -- any good impression at -- on the company. But, we survived, yeah.",

        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So when I got discharged, I went back to the job, because he had to take me back and\nI rested there another couple of months and then I went out and look for another job. And\nI found another job, and in 1951, I got married, in December.",
        "Q: Tell me about that. You didn\u2019t do get married. How did you meet your wife?",
        "A: Well, I met my wife by -- again, by chance. I went to a Jewish organization, they had\nthe -- a meeting -- social meeting on -- on a Sunday. I met -- I went there and met my --\nno, not with my brother, my brother went someplace else. I\u2019d a -- We -- I met my wife\nthere and we started to -- to date and so on, so forth.

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes. It was important to marry in my same faith, because my youth and my\nupbringing was Jewish and my holidays and all that and you know, and here I have a\nJewish girl, who knew what -- what -- what\u2019s all about and -- and not only that, but she\nunderstands me, she understands my background. And we\u2019re the perfect match.",
        "Q: Do you think -- Was it helpful that you had both been -- lived through the war\nexperience? I mean, was it important for you to marry another survivor, for example?",
        "A: It was not that important for me to marry another survivor, but it was important for me\nto marry another Jewish woman. That -- That was -- That was important.",
        "Q: Yeah. And did you -- did you talk much at the beginning, about what you had been\nthrough?",
        "A: Well, naturally we talked about it, because it is a -- it is something that my behavior,\nmy things are not normal. I -- You know, I-I -- I have things that I acquired in the camp\nand that they stick with me and you know, that\u2019s a -- it\u2019s soma -- somebody who\nunderstands me. That\u2019s -- That\u2019s what it 1s.",
        "Q: What -- What do you mean, things you acquired in the camp that\u2019s -- that --",
        "A: Well, these are -- these are little, little things and I only going to mention one to you.\nBeing starved in the camp, every crumb of bread and every piece of meal, 1s always in a -\n- a very important factor in my life. And I can go out with my wife and have a good piece\nof di -- no, I wouldn\u2019t say be -- I mi -- I have a good dish and I never would take a piece\nand say, \u201cHere darling, would you like to taste it?\u201d I don\u2019t do it of not being a good\nhusband, I do it because the -- the -- the think that this piece, little piece is still in my\nmind that I need it for myself. Not realizing it -- it da -- 1t doesn\u2019t mean nothing, you\nknow, today, what 1s -- a-and -- and these -- these stupid things are still with me, that, you\nknow, that piece of bread means -- means so much and so mu -- or piece of -- some part\nof dish is so important that I -- I don\u2019t take a spoon or knife or whatever it is, from the\ndish and take a piece and offer it, you know. That doesn\u2019t [indecipherable] that I\u2019m bad,\nbut it\u2019s -- it\u2019s something that -- that sticks with me.",
        "Q: Yeah. And she understands that.",
        "A: Yeah, she understands it. Otherwise, there would have been big fights about it. But\nshe understands it, she\u2019s very understanding.",
        "Q: Tell me about -- y-you married in \u201851? 1951?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And you moved out of the house in the Bronx, or did you stay there?",
        "A: No, no, we moved out of the Bronx in 1957, I think. And we moved to a new garden\napartment project in Queens.",
        "Q: And what are you doing at this point? Are you -- You\u2019re working? What -- What were\nyou doing?",
        "A: Yeah, I still -- I still was working. I worked all along. Huh?",
        "Q: What were you doing?",
        "A: I was doing as a mechanic here in the -- in the place, in the dealership.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",

        "A: Yeah. And I -- I make my living that way.",
        "Q: And you have children?",
        "A: I got two wonderful daughters, they both are married. I got four lovely grandchildren\nand my oldest daughter lives in Scarsdale, married to a physician and my younger\ndaughter lives in Andover, Massachusetts, with two lovely grandchildren and biomedical\nengineer, as a husband. And she also 1s a nurse with an MBDRN, something like that.\nAnd she is -- She also has a very important position in the -- the company manufacturing\nsome drugs. And my other daughter helps her husband, keeping the books. And by and\nlarge, I accomplished a wonderful li -- wife. I have a wonderful family and\ngrandchildren, daughters, son-in-laws, and it\u2019s a very, very well family.",
        "Q: When your -- When your daughters were growing up, did there come a point at which\nyou wanted to talk to them about the war? Did they ask you about it?",
        "A: When my daughters were growing up and they became the age of seven or eight years\nold, I let them watch television, where they had movies from the Holocaust and I told\nthem that I was in there and all that and I told them about it. They were very\nunderstanding. And as of today, they still try to be active with the Holocaust, and they\nknow about it and they are very supportive, at -- as far as that 1s concerned.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Ho-How much a part of your life with them does that occupy, would you\nsay? I mean, do -- 1s it a significant part of that dynamic that you have? Your\nbackground?",
        "A: Unfortunately, not a dynamic part, because I was very gentle about it and my\ndaughters understood what it was all about and they didn\u2019t want to dig into 1t too much.\nAnd I did want to press the issue too much and you know --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: We -- We were just talking about -- about your daughters and -- and what -- what they\nknew about -- about your experiences.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Did you ever take them back over there? Did you take any trips with them?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah. Tell me about that.",
        "A: I took my youngest daughter -- I -- I wanted to take my two daughters and their\nhusbands and show them where we come from and what I went through and all that, you\nknow, and unfortunately my -- not unfortunately, but my daughter became pregnant, the\neldest one. So I just took the youngest daughter. And I showed them Berlin, and that was\nour first stop. And I arranged there to talk to German kids in the school, about the\nHolocaust and they were treated from the German government to -- they paid for their\nhotel and the entertainment. They showed them -- they took them to the opera and, you\nknow, for a week. But we -- we only stayed in Berlin two days. And I took the same train\nthat we always used to take when we went to Poland, to Time and all that, from Berlin.\nNo, I\u2019m sorry, I -- we traveled from Berlin in -- in normal times, in 1938 and so on, we\nwent on daytime, but to save time, I traveled at night from Berlin to Poland. And we took\nthem to Auschwitz. I showed them Auschwitz. I showed them the gas chambers and the\nbarracks and all that. And from Auschwitz, we went at the night train, to Vienna, where\nmy wife was. And then, from Vienna, we went to -- from Vienna we went to Holland. I\nhave an aunt there. She is 91 years old, which I visit frequently, because she has nobody.\nAnd then we went home. That took us, I think three weeks.",
        "Q: How -- How was that for you, to be back in -- in Auschwitz, specifically?",
        "A: Oh, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry. I missed Munich.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Be -- We stopped in Munich and we visited Dachau. I showed them -- my son-in-law\nDachau, and my daughter. And from there we went to Holland, then we went home.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I forgot we went to -- to Dachau.",
        "Q: What was -- What was that like for you? How did --",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "Q: Was that the first time you had been back to the camps -- to visit the camps?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And what -- what was that like? How did that affect you?",
        "A: Well, actually it\u2019s not the first ttme I went back. There was an -- in 1970 that I went to\nAuschwitz by myself. I told my wife, \u201cI have to go there and I have to see it.\u201d\n[indecipherable] And I went back by myself, to Auschwitz.",
        "Q: You said you had to see it?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Psychologically. Yeah, I know. Had to say goodbye to my mother and to -- you know.\nAnd that\u2019s why I went back for. And -- And I went back when I was invited from the\nGerman government, to come back as a sort of -- as a, you know, a friendly gesture, so to\nspeak of.",
        "Q: How did that come about? They invited you?",
        "A: Well, they have a program, you know, they invite all the ex-Berlinners back to -- to\nBerlin. And I must say, they -- they paid the -- the air fare and the hotel and they showed\nus 1n the opera and the circus, and -- not the circus, there\u2019s no circus in Berlin, but th-they\nshowed us around and gave us a good time and took us back. And I still get letters from -\n- you want [inaudible]",
        "Q: No, I\u2019m fine, that\u2019s fine, thanks.",
        "A: They still, you know, have this program and letters from all over the world. They --\nThey take people who used to be in Berlin, you know, to invite them back. But they had\ncategories from people who were in a concentration camp and people who were elderly\nand you know, then the younger ones, and so on, so forth. My friend who I met\n[indecipherable], he just went last year -- last year? Or this year, I think he went back\napar from the city of Berlin -- to Berlin, yeah.",
        "Q: And, you were speaking with students? Was it --",
        "A: Yes, yes, in the school.",
        "Q: How did -- How did that go? What did -- What did you tell them and how did they\nreceive you, what did they ask you?",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a very ticklish question to ask, because you\u2019re talking to\npeople who -- who don\u2019t know anything and who have a certain mind and they have all\nkind of antagonizing questions, and -- not question, answers that -- put -- put it that way.\nSo, you know, to handle them needed a little diplom-diplomacy and like I got the\nquestion, \u201cWhy are you so mad ta -- towards the Germans, when you getting reparation?\u201d",
        "Q: Why are you so mad towards the Germans --",
        "A: And I\u2019m getting repatriation.",
        "Q: Reparation?",
        "A: Reparation, yeah. I said, and so -- so what -- what could I answer? I said, \u201cDo y-you\nthink that by giving me money now, that it will bring my family back? My mother, my\naunt?\u201d You know, and so th-that shut her up, but, you know, it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a -- a very, very\nticklish question to ask and t-to give you a proper answer.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You know, in other words, they feel that they giving you the money, they should be\nresolved from the -- from the things that they have done, which is not the case. So that\u2019s -\n- that\u2019s na -- another subject. And then I have a tape from a -- a radio station, there was a\n-- a question and answer radio program on the German radio and they -- the pupils that\nwere permitted to call up the station and ask them questions, you know. And all kind of\nother questions came up, you know, which I personally didn\u2019t care for, you know.",
        "Q: Can you think of some?",
        "A: Well, there was one question, I said, you know, that Germany never had the resistance\nand you only had about two of -- two or three people within the army on the 20th of June,\nI forgot the year, that they tried to revolt against Hitler and they -- unfortunately didn\u2019t\nsucceed, you know. So they say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s not true. We had so many this, so many\nthat there.\u201d I said, \u201cYou say that, but I never read about it in the paper, nobody ever knew\nabout it,\u201d you know. That -- th - th -- somebody did some -- some terrorist attic in the --\nin the factory, you know, that somebody got injured by doing a certain thing. But, by and\nlarge, nobody knew about it, nobody heard about it, because 1t would have any effect. It\nwould have been [indecipherable] that the guy blew up a factory and 200 people got\nkilled. Or -- Or the -- the SS commando was -- was bombed or something like that, you\nknow, like you -- like you read today in the -- in the paper, about Israel, that they blow up\na -- a Jewish army post, or whatever it is. So I -- I -- I couldn\u2019t answer that, because it\nwas -- was the -- called into the radio station here, but I got [indecipherable] within, you\nknow, it -- it doesn\u2019t mean anything, because it\u2019s one 1n a thousand.",
        "Q: Why did you think it was important for you to go to -- to participate in that -- that\nprogram, to talk to the students?",
        "A: I grew up in Berlin and I was 13 years old when I left Berlin. And I wanted them to\nknow what a fellow student had to go through in his life on account of anti-Semitism and\non account of Hitler. And I wanted them to know that I went through it. That\u2019s -- That\nwas the purpose. No other purpose could there be, but wh-what else could I do? I mean,\nthis is the new generation growing up and they -- they are innocent, in my opinion. It\u2019s\nnot their fault that they are born by a German people. And I hoped that they might learn\nsomething from it, by me telling them what -- what took place. So, I did that, you know,\nand | -- I did if for their sake, so to speak of. Like I\u2019m going to -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m talking here\nto -- to -- here, mel I -- I didn\u2019t succeed, but I wanted to talk here, there\u2019s a German\nschool here, in White Plains that has German students there and I wanted to talk to them,\nbut 1t never materialized.",
        "Q: Why not? Do you know?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t -- I can\u2019t say. Although I met the -- the principal and I know that\nthe Jewish -- the Westchester Holocaust Commission is in touch with him, but I don\u2019t\nknow for what reason nobody is able to talk about the Holocaust to their -- to their\nstudents.",
        "Q: Did -- Wha -- The trip that you took to Germany, did you -- do you think it -- it was\nworthwhile? Did you come back thinking that you had accomplished what you had set\nout to accomplish?",
        "A: I think so. I think so. I -- I got a very good reception from the principal. He gave me a\nbook as a -- as aremembrance. And I think I -- I left some -- some important points there.\nThat fellow German, although I\u2019m not German, but the fellow who lived in Germany,\nwas all of a sudden subjected -- subjected to these kind of treatments and endurances in\nhis life. So I -- I think that I accomplished something in that respect. I mean, I go here\nand I talk to kids in the school and you should see the letters I get back from the -- from\nthe kids, you know, that the impression they get, of what I will -- what I told them, you\nknow -- I didn\u2019t tell them all the -- the bad things, but you know, th -- they -- they -- they\ngot -- kids get something out of it.",
        "Q: Do you think they do understand it, or as much as they can?",
        "A: Yes, yes. Most definitely, because kids today are definite -- than kids when -- when I\nwas a kid. Kids today have radios, they got computers, they got all kind of -- all kind of\nhelp and they know -- they learn earlier than we started to learn and education is -- is\nadmitted in a different way than when I went to school. So, it -- it\u2019s a different ball game.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I mean, you talk today to a three year old, he answers you already like a 15 year old.\nAnd you read in the paper that there are kids that are 12 and 13 years old, are capable of\ngoing -- of going to college in the next three years or so. And they are very few and far in\nbetween, but it happens. Never happened when we grew up.",
        "Q: What -- What\u2019s your motivation when you speak to kids here, as opposed to the kids\nthat you spoke with in Germany? Wh-Wh-Why ts that important?",
        "A: My motivation here is that, first of all, to tell kids that were -- things that can happen\nto one in this lifetime and to be aware of it, that things can happen, even here, with a\ndemocracy and with all the freedom that you enjoy. Because, if you stop to analyze\nthings that are going on around the world, we s -- we back in the same boat that -- that we\nwere before. Not in the same -- to the same extent, but it does happen, you pick up the\npaper and you have it in -- in Yugoslavia, you have it in Russia, you have it in India, you\nhave it -- you have it all over the world. So, people didn\u2019t learn yet, so it\u2019s still going on.\nAnd something has to be done eventually, to -- to stop all that, although they -- they\ncreated the UN -- the United Nation. The United Nation didn\u2019t do much to stop the\nkilling.",
        "Q: You mentioned that you had gone to Israel for a reunion of survivors? Was that --\nWhen was that?",
        "A: Yes, I went -- I went three times to different places in the -- in the United States and to\n-- and to -- the first one was to Israel.",
        "Q: When was that?",
        "A: That was in 19 -- I think it was in 1974 or \u201875. I -- I could be wrong with the year.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But it was a very eventful gathering in -- in Jerusalem. And at that time, you know, we\n-- we were told by -- by the -- by the margaro -- by the organization that sponsored it, of\nwhich I am -- I was there on the executive board, that they spoke with Yad Vashem and it\nwas brought up that the survivors might want to establish a -- a section in Yad Vashem\nfor the people that perished in -- in -- in Auschwitz. And they got the permission to bring\na -- a gravestone with them. I mean, not a big gravestone, but a small headstone,\nsomething like that, a gravestone, whatever it is, with the name and the -- you know. And\nbelieve -- believe me that everybody in the group had one, including me. And Yad\nVashem was not prepared to accept all these -- these stones, you know\u201d? So, they told us\nto put it on the side, you know, in Yad Vashem, and -- which we did and the -- it took\nthem three years to find a -- a place and place them properly. And I took a stone there and\nI had it engraved with my late mother\u2019s name and all that. And I went to -- to Yad\nVashem and I -- I located the stone. Believe me, it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a wonder -- here again we\ngo, it\u2019s a wonder, from the hundreds of stones that were there, that I found my late\nmother\u2019s stone. And, you know, it -- it\u2019s a -- but the Holocaust meeting in -- in Israel was\nvery, very meaningful. It was only on the hotel on the wall, you know. And, again, we\nhad the dignitaries, the Israeli dignitaries address us and you know, and all that. So, it\nwas -- it was quite a -- quite a meaningful and thoughtful event that took place. But, then\nwe had one in Washington, in -- in Philadelphia, I think, with President Reagan and he\nwas also very, very thoughtful and meaningful with that. So --",
        "Q: What do you get from those meetings? What -- What meaning do you take away from\nthem? Why do you go?",
        "A: Why do I go? It\u2019s a good question, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a -- It\u2019s a -- It\u2019s a satisfaction to\nremember -- to remember the Holocaust, that -- that what it is, it\u2019s a -- is -- is self-\nsatisfaction that you do for the people who perished, that they are remembered, that\nthings like this has happened. That what you been through, that you meet people that you\nhaven\u2019t seen for years and that\u2019s all I can say, as far as I\u2019m concerned. Without --\nWithout getting any deeper into it, because, you know, it is every -- every subject is --\nhas a lengthy explanation.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. I wanted to -- I realize I didn\u2019t finish up your life in New York, you -- were\nyou a mechanic?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you stay a mechanic the whole time?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Your whole career?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You did very well, I think. You\u2019re living in a lovely house. You --",
        "A: Well, I can say I did very well. I sent my daughters to colleges, I -- I have a lovely\nhouse, I have a lovely family. I didn\u2019t do bad, but I could have done better. I have a car\nand -- and you know, I mean I -- I -- I -- I\u2019m -- I accomplished things in my life. Not the\nway it could have been, but I\u2019m not starving, so that\u2019s -- that\u2019s one -- one good\nresolution. So -- But I went through a lot in business, and then, you know, and everything\nis -- everything was not bedded in roses. So, it\u2019s a -- was a constant -- constant struggle,\nbut I managed.",
        "Q: Did you end up owning your own business after awhile?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: [had my own business.",
        "Q: It was a auto -- car repair -- car dealership?",
        "A: No, not a dealership.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: To have a dealership, you need a lot of money and I don\u2019t have that. But I -- I had the\nshop and employees and service vehicles and all that and -- but it didn\u2019t bloom to the\nextent that it could have bloomed and -- but whatever -- what I mean, it didn\u2019t expand\nlarge. I had problems getting help, which is common things here. And -- But I had -- I\nhad my -- I kept my head above the water and didn\u2019t sink, so that\u2019s -- that\u2019s the important\nend of it.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Did -- Did you tend to hire other Jews? Did you hire -- I\u2019m just curious\nwhether that happen --",
        "A: | -- | -- I didn\u2019t make any -- any discrimination of Jewish or colored or whatever it 1s.\nWhoever came to me, asked for a job, he give me a day\u2019s work and was honest and\nshowed up to work, without any excuses, I didn\u2019t care. Jewish or not Jewish or whatever.\nIt didn\u2019t matter to me.",
        "Q: Did you ever -- Did they, do you think know that you were a survivor of the\nHolocaust? I\u2019m wondering if you ever talked about that with any of your employees.",
        "A: I -- I -- I -- I talked about being a survivor very often. Not -- Not to gain any -- any\npreferences, but it\u2019s my nature. So, inadvertently sometimes it came over us in the -- in\nthe -- in the discussion, you know, what did you do during the war, or, you know, where\nwere you, what -- when did you come to the country and why did you come to this\ncountry? An how come you came to this country? And you know, they\u2019re all kind of --\nall kind of answers to give. The Holocaust always comes into the picture. So n-not that I\ngot any better treatment being a Holocaust survivor. I would say sometimes I met people\nwho -- who gave me some preferential treatment, I wouldn\u2019t say no, but I went to the\nbank and deposited a hundred dollars and told them I had a -- I\u2019m a Holocaust survivor,\nthey didn\u2019t give me credit for 200, so you know, so it -- it has -- has it\u2019s limits, you\nknow? And then people always, they say, \u201cAh, you know, you hear about the Holocaust\nconstantly. That\u2019s enough of it, it\u2019s gone, zzz,\u201d you know, so you -- you have all kind of\npeople that you encounter with and -- and you know, different -- different people have\ndifferent opinions, so you have to -- you have to face every situation and be ready to -- to\naccept it and -- and deal with it.",
        "Q: Have you heard that frequently from people? The Holocaust is over, why are we\nhearing about it so much?",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t say P\u2019ve heard frequently about it, but I did hear about it, yes.",
        "Q: And what do you -- What do you say when you hear that? How do you react? How do\nyou respond?",
        "A: How do I explain? I says, \u201cYes, it\u2019s over, but the damage it did is not over yet,\nbecause people still suffer from it. Psychologically, mentally, physically. So, how can\nyou say -- how can you say it\u2019s over?\u201d I mean, if you got -- get hurt in a -- 1n a -- at the\njob where you work for -- for three or four years, and it\u2019s 10 years later and you still\nsuffer from it, you still say, \u201cI got this from there and there, where I worked, and you\nknow, and I wasn\u2019t taken care of there properly.\u201d So, you know, it\u2019s something that sticks\nwith you.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So they have no answer. Because I always confront them with realities.",
        "Q: Now you mentioned when you came to New York, you hadn\u2019t encountered anti-\nSemitism. In the time since then, did you run across that in -- in -- in your career or since\nyou moved to Westchester here?",
        "A: Oh, well, I -- I encountered anti-Semitism occasionally, but it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s something that\neverybody again, encounters, you know, and it\u2019s something that you have to accept,\nbecause unfortunately it\u2019s -- it\u2019s in existence and some people show it and some people\ndon\u2019t show it.",
        "Q: How have you encountered it?",
        "A: My -- The remarks people make. The disassociation which -- with the Gentile people\nand it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a -- you know, it\u2019s noticeable that -- that you are a Jew, that they don\u2019t\naccept you or they don\u2019t want you, or -- you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s something -- not that I am\nvery -- how should I say it? Not that Iam very hurt by it, but Iam very touchy by it, but\nit is noticeable and it is -- I -- I feel 1t, you know, and so do other people feel it, too, but\nit\u2019s a personal [indecipherable] was anti-Semiti -- anti-Semi -- anti-Semitic.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So it is a, you know, is -- it\u2019s noticeable, you -- you feel it, believe me.",
        "Q: I wonder if you feel 1t more as a survivor?",
        "A: Well, I would say that we are ea-easier to detect it than -- than other people, I would\nsay that, because we experienced it.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nFred Bachner. This it tape number three, side B. You notice it more, you s -- you think, as\na -- aS a Survivor?",
        "A: Yes, yes. Like I say, experience is the best teacher. You know, it is more noticeable\nand I can see if -- if people hide it and people try to -- you know, try to be anti-Semitic\nabout it and without showing it to you. And it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s more noticeable to me than\nto some pa -- somebody else.",
        "Q: P\u2019ve heard some survivors say that they can sort of instinctively tell when someone\nelse is a Holocaust survivor, without knowing anything about them. I\u2019m curious if you\nagree with that or no, if that\u2019s not what your experience has been?",
        "A: I agree with it.",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "A: Yeah. We survivor are a -- a different people and I -- I don\u2019t know, y-y-you know,\nnowadays people who came to this country before the war, they all of a sudden became\nsurvivors. So, now we have to start to distinguish th-the survivors. A Holocaust survivor\nwho was in a camp, for me 1s very easy to detect, on his behavior, on his way -- the way\nhe talks and y-you know, it -- there are certain -- I -- I don\u2019t know, there\u2019s certain --\ncertain ways that -- that I can recognize a -- a survivor. You know, the -- we -- we had the\nlanguage on ourselves by doing certain things a certain way, and I -- I noticed that when\nthey play the football here, you know, the -- the coach stands in the side and he makes\nlike this, you know, all -- all kind of moves and you know, to tell the players how to act\nand -- and what to do, what not to do. We had that same kind of a language with -- with\nus, because when -- when we seen a guard came in, you know, and he had something to\ndo and started to hit people or grab people, you know, to be executed or whatever you\nwant to call it, we -- we -- we sense it and kn-knew it, you know, and we gave each other\nnotice of it and tried to hide or tried to do something that -- not to be on the -- in the front,\nto be the first one to be caught. So, in case there was anything going on, you know, we\ntried to warn each other, but it was to no avail, because they did anyway, what they going\nto. So, in that respect, I would say yes.",
        "Q: What do you think it is that you see in other survivors that I wouldn\u2019t notice, for\nexample?",
        "A: Intuition. Intuition, you know. It\u2019s certain behaviors that we have that 1s not a normal\nbehavior, let\u2019s put it that way. Like, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know how to tell you the\ncertain behavior is, but there\u2019s -- there\u2019s certain instances where I can see how a survivor\nwould behave and behaves, you know, and I can say that this 1s -- this is a survivor of a\ncamp, not -- not from -- from -- coming early to this country.",
        "Q: \u2019'm wondering if there are things politically around -- either in this country or around\nthe world, that have happened since you came here, that have resonated particularly with\nyour experience during the war? Vietnam war, Civil Rights movement? Any of the\nnumber of sort of big events that have shaped this country. Have any of them sort of\naffected you more specifically because of your past experience?",
        "A: I am thinking back and I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think that anything has affected me\npersonally or -- I admired the colored movement with Martin Luther King, that they\nfinally established themselve. And I don\u2019t see anything -- there\u2019s certain things pol-\npolitically that I don\u2019t agree a hundred percent with and -- but here is a country where I\ncan state my opinion without going to jail. And in discussions sometimes -- rarely -- I do\nit, but by and large, that -- that personally I -- I am not affected by it, that it should\nchange my way of life or shape my way of life, or anything of that nature.",
        "Q: You mentioned the -- Martin Luther King and the Civil Rights movement. Did you --\nHow did -- How did you -- How did you view that, as that was happening?",
        "A: How did I view it? Well, he was a -- in my opinion he was a man who wanted t-to\nelevate the colored people into a better position that they are -- they were and -- and to a\ncertain degree, he accomplished that. And he -- unfortunately it -- he paid with -- with his\nlife for it, but it -- it -- 1t -- 1t was due, because the colored people here in the -- in the\nUnited States, sooner or later would have been treated like the Jewish people were treated\nin Germany. If you stops back and think about it, that they couldn\u2019t be on the same bus\nand they couldn\u2019t be here. We had the same thing in Germany. I mean, one thing leads to\nthe other. And then -- And then -- In south, the way the colored people now are being\ntreated, not -- in certain respects, not any better than we Jews were treated in Germany.",
        "Q: So you think it -- 1t could have backslid back towards slavery or something like that, if\nit hadn\u2019t -- without the Civil Rights movement?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think that there would be any slavery here, but the detention in camps and all\nthat, that could have been in some shape or form, be accomplished. It\u2019s no big deals\nabout it. You had -- I mean, you had the Ku Klux Klan here, you got all kind of other\npeople who are on the right track on trying to accomplish these things and fortunately\nthey -- they getting stopped here by the government. But nevertheless, you have the\nredskins, you got the other thi -- the-there so many factors in-involved here that it\u2019s\nimpossible for -- for a plain citizen to keep track of it. And they do take place every day\nof the week.",
        "Q: Are there political groups or causes that you have gotten involved with, supported,\nmaybe financially or with your -- with actions. Anything you\u2019ve done --",
        "A: No, not at all. I don\u2019t support any democratic or republican party or any other party,\nRight for Life, or whatever it is. The only -- The only thing that I support is Yad Vashem\nand the United Jewish Appeal and some other Jewish organizations. But I don\u2019t support\nany -- anything.",
        "Q: It sounds like you\u2019re very involved in those groups.",
        "A: No, I li -- oh, in the Holocaust, yes, yes. I\u2019m very involved with Yad Vashem, I\u2019m\nvery involved with the museum in Washington and I\u2019m involved here with the Holocaust\nCommission in White Plains. I initiated here in this town where I\u2019m living, a Holocaust\ncommittee, which I am the chairman of and I must say I\u2019m successful. On Yom HaShoah\nservices, I have about 350 people partaking and I will have a new library -- part of it\ndedicated to the Holocaust -- studying the Holocaust with computers and video games --\nnot video games, I\u2019m sorry, video machines for the movies from the Holocaust. I\u2019m very\nmuch involved with the -- with the Holocaust, yes.",
        "Q: Did your brother or your father get involved in that way also? What was their -- How\ndid they come back --",
        "A: I believe my brother is involved in -- my brother lives in Florida, so -- and he tells me\nhe 1s involved and to what degree, I don\u2019t know, but yeah, I know that he\u2019s involved, yes.",
        "Q: And your father, did he live on his own with his new wife, after you --",
        "A: My father lived with his wife and he passed away about 10 years ago.",
        "Q: Oh. How did -- How did he cope after the war? You mentioned he\u2019d been sick. How\ndid -- How did he do?",
        "A: Well, he -- he was a sick man, he had heart problems and -- but he -- he managed. He\ncoped with it and he was -- he tried to be very religious and he passed away on the eighth\nday of Hanukah and although that there was no eulogy permitted for the eighth day of\nHanukah, the rabbi gave a eulogy because he was a -- a good -- my -- I -- I don\u2019t know\nhow to express it, he was a good person and a -- was religious and he -- they had a lot of\nrespect for him.",
        "Q: And where was he living?",
        "A: He was living in Queens.",
        "Q: In Queens.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So not too far from you at the time, when he was --",
        "A: No, I -- I been living out here 35 years, so he\u2019s -- he\u2019s -- the -- it\u2019s about an hours\naway from here.",
        "Q: Did you stay close?",
        "A: Yeah, you know, stay close. I went to see him wa -- you know, every once -- so often\nand I had him out here to come and visit the grandchildren, and all that, you know, so it\nwas a Close relationship.",
        "Q: I wonder as you -- as you look back on all that has happened. What -- What do you\nthink kept you going?",
        "A: Perseverance. Perseverance. The faith that everything will be all right, so that\u2019s --\nthat\u2019s what keeps me going. Today is today, tomorrow is tomorrow. I used to live in the\nconcentration camp from hour to hour. So, you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s one step ahead, to live\nfrom day to day. We -- We advance 24 hours, right? That\u2019s the advance we have. I don\u2019t\nbelieve to get attached to anything, as far as physically is concerned. To a house or to\nanything. It\u2019s just -- just my nature, what I have lost in life, you know, it\u2019s -- I -- I realize\nhow fast you can lose what you accomplished. So -- And there was nobody who could\nreplace it. So why get attached to something? When I had sold my house, my -- my\ndaughters came at six o\u2019clock in the morning, to -- to have a last look at the -- at the --\nthat room where -- where they were, you know? So, I felt good that they had the feeling,\nyou know, but I personally, it -- it\u2019s nothing. Just a house, just stones and bricks and all\nthat, you know. And they don\u2019t talk.",
        "Q: You mentioned why get attached to things. What about to people? Those got taken\naway very quickly, too.",
        "A: That\u2019s another story. I have my mixed feelings. I got attached to my family and -- but\nother than that, I -- you know, it\u2019s -- you get attached to people, they -- they here today\nand gone tomorrow. And during the war, you got attached to people and they here today,\nnext hour they\u2019re gone. So, you know, it is -- and -- and -- and getting attached to\nsomebody and loving somebody and all that 1s -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s a very painful situation. And\nyou lose somebody you love and somebody you\u2019re close to and you know. Or somebody\nfrom the family, a cousin, an aunt, an uncle or that, you know, it leaves a scar 1n your --\nin your body. So, y-you can\u2019t -- you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a personal thing, you cannot\ngeneralize it. You know, I feel one way, you feel the other way and it\u2019s a -- like my -- my\nchildren, they know that they have t-two cousins and you know. Then --Not -- Not two\ncousins, they got more than that. They got [indecipherable] just two, and then they have\nsome -- some other cousins in -- in Philadelphia and they got other cousins in Los\nAngeles, but they never met them, never seen each other, you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s one of\nthose things, you know. Like here, and in America, the distance is so big that it\u2019s a\nproblem to have a family close together. Like in the old -- old times, he used to live in the\ncity and everybody used to live close by and everybody used to see each other on the\nweekend, because it was a custom that you would -- what do you -- what you doing this\nweekend? I\u2019m going to Aunt So and So and to Uncle So and So and tomorrow we going\nthere and it was a family situation. But that\u2019s all gone, because today you want to go and\nsee your brother, you have to go take an airplane and travel three hours, four hours and\nby the time you get to the airport and from the airport, so it\u2019s a days a -- a day lost.",
        "Q: How do you think -- it sounds like you came out of the war with a fair amount of\ndistrust of attachment. How do you think you were able to form a bond with your wife,\nfor example, that\u2019s lasted as long as it has and you\u2019ve created a family that\u2019s been very\nstable together.",
        "A: Well, my li -- it\u2019s a different situation, you love a wife, you love the family and you\nestablish a relationship and it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a different -- different situation between my wife\nand somebody else. I mean, you know, I can like somebody, I can love somebody, but\nit\u2019s not the same love that you have with your wife. So it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a different ball\ngame, because you can have a favorite aunt, you can have a favorite cousin, you can have\na favorite like this, you know, but you like them because the way they react, the way you\nli -- the understanding you with you\u2019re cousins or with your aunts and uncles and all\nthat. It\u2019s -- It is not the same than between -- like between a wife and a husband. So, you\nknow, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a different. You feel very bad if an -- an aunt dies or a cousin dies or\nsomething like that. But you can\u2019t say that you actually loved the person. So, there\u2019s a\ndistinction.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, sure. I think we can stop there. Is there anything else that I didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t\nget -- give you a chance to talk about that you want to -- that you want to add here?",
        "A: A chance of what?",
        "Q: Anything else that you wanted to talk about, that you didn\u2019t get a chance to, before we\nStop.",
        "A: Well, there are so many things that are -- that are to be talked about, but I guess we\ncovered the major items in a broad way and if there are any specifics that you would like\nme to talk about, I\u2019d be more than happy to talk. And if you review the tapes or\nsomething like that, and you -- you think or feel that there are things, you put them down\non paper and [indecipherable] come back and spend some time with me and I\u2019d be more\nthan happy to fill you in on these things and you know, we\u2019 ll make another issue out of.",
        "Q: Great. Thank you so much.",
        "A: You\u2019re welcome. My pleasure.",

        "Q: I\u2019m curious, when you were -- during the war, when you were in the camps, watching\nmany people die around you, knowing that some of your family had died or not being\nsure that they died.

        "A: When the war ended, I was in the vicinity of Dachau, near Munich, where I was\nliberated and met the American troops, who liberated me, actually. And I found out the\ncreation of a Displaced Person camp, by the name of Feldifing, which I did not join. I had\nthe accommodation in the village where I was liberated and after being separated with\nmy -- with my brother and friend from the Jewish community, we felt lonesome and\nproceeded to look for some places in Munich, to settle for time beings.",
        "A: Right.",

        "A: Well, excuse me, you could see the chaos that started by the airplanes that started to b-\nbombard the vicinity where the train was moving and the railroad tracks and the train\nitself slowed down. And it was a wooded area and the troops liquidated their post, from\nthe top of the railroad cars and it was sort of a chance to take, now or never. So that what\nwe took and thank God, we were successful. And we were in the water there, where --\nwhere we were confronted by some French prisoner of wars, who helped us by changing\nour prison uniforms. And then we were -- we hid in the woods and -- until we met the\nAmerican troops, so, two or three d -- two or three days later, until the fighting finally\nstopped, and we sa -- went out from the woods onto the open streets and we were stopped\nby a American patrol, who took us to a POW camp and then we were interrogated, and\nset free.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, we\u2019re -- oh, you -- no, I\u2019m sorry, when we -- when we met them, we\nwere in civil uniforms, that\u2019s correct, but we were recognized by the hat -- that we had no\nhair on -- it was shaved in a certain way that the prisoners were, by a -- sort of a center of\nthe head, the street, that was left a little bald down to the skin and next to it, there were a\nlittle bit of hair, so it was recognizable as a street or a mark to be a prisoner. And we had\na hard time to the convince the -- the people, the soldiers that we are Jews, because they\nwere -- believed that the -- all the Jews were killed. And we choder -- we showed them\nour numbers on the arm and then they still didn\u2019t believe it, and they ask us when the\nJewish holidays are, which we knew and answered them and then they finally said yes,\nyou know, and t-took us into the Jeep and drove us to headquarters, where we met the\ncolonel, who instead -- interrogated us about the German troop movements and the camp,\nfrom Dachau itself, the location and the -- whatever we knew about the camp, we told\nthem, which wasn\u2019t very much, because within the camp, we had no knowledge what\nwas going on outside the camp.

And then, when we were at the headquarters, the people\nwarmed up towards us and they took us to the POW camp, which was nearby, and they\nask us whether we will -- would like to stay in the POW camp, wh -- or whether we\nwould like to have some private accommodations, which we naturally choose to be -- to\nhave the private accommodations, because there was more -- better than the POW\naccommodation --",

        "A: How? I\u2019m sorry?",
        "A: Well, we -- you know, it\u2019s a funny thing nowadays, in 1999, I would say, things are\nmore electronically and -- equipped. Those days it was word to mouth and it worked very\ngood, I must say, because people were constantly on the move. Everybody was looking\nfor somebody and traveling and moving and meeting. And everybody had the story to\ntell, and that\u2019s how we found out from people that we met, who told us about that\nparticular camp and we pursued to find out who, if any of th -- our friends or\nacquaintances from the camp were in the -- in that particular camp. I was not in Dachau\nper se, in the main camp, but I was in a satellite camp, that we were transported in that\nparticular train.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. We were isolated from any news and from any friends or\npeople of Jewish contact, and that\u2019s why my brother traveled into Munich, to see what is\ngoing on there and 0 -- upon his return, we waited a week or so and then we decided that\nit would be better for us to be where the Jewish population is, despite the fact that we\ncould have had a very substantial German factory and property from the Nazi that was --\nevacuated the house, which we occupied after his leaving.",
        "A: Well, after we left the -- after we left the DP camp -- not the D -- the interrogation,\nsee, and we were told -- we told the commander that we would like to be on our own, and\nnot in the POW camp, he instructed the lieutenant to take care of us and to give us some\naccommodation. And he took us into the marketplace and comma-commanded to meet\nthe mayor from the town. And he met the mayor of the town in a short while and he\ninstructed the mayor, without any doubt, that he has three Jewish survivors and they are\nnot going to sleep on the street and to provide us with a comfortable home and food and\nall that. And as -- they gave an -- an -- an hour\u2019s time. And we waited an hour and then\nhe came back and he said that he found a home for us which -- and he\u2019s going to take us\nthere and give us a woman to care for us and provide us with anything that we want and\nneed, which actually took place. After we took the house, we looked around, there were\nthree bedrooms and we took all the beds, pillows and all that into one bed and for the first\ntime in our life, we slept comfortable and warm, and it was the first time that we really\nslept in -- un-undescribable. Now, this house became the meeting point for the Jewish\nsoldiers that were in that particular camp, the POW camp. There was also a detachment\nfrom the Israeli army there, as prisoner of war, who served as the English army. And I\nwould say that it was -- it was a comfortable time that we spent there with these people\nwho had an opportunity to meet us and they brought us army rations and it was quite\nremarkable.",
        "A: Days -- Days after, days after.",
        "A: Well, it sust felt like -- like being newborn and you started your life over from the\nbeginning and you met people, and you -- that you never figured you\u2019re going to meet\nagain, and -- you know, and it was a camaraderie, it was -- unde-undescribable.",
        "A: Well, to be honest about it, I trusted them as far as ca -- I can throw them, which isn\u2019t\nvery far, but a -- I -- I -- Is -- I sort of felt I had the upper hand at this particular time,\nbecause I knew that the American had everything un -- occupied and I -- I felt that there\nwas very little that they could do, in order to do anything physically, or any other which\nway.",
        "A: No, no, it was -- it was afte-after the war, there were na -- no German soldier\u2019s\noccupation visible. The American were in hundred percent control and all you can see is\nwhat -- what I knew were -- how -- how a camp, the concentration camp looked like, it\ndidn\u2019t look like a concentration camp, but it looked like a camp and you know, one camp\nor the other, there\u2019s no -- not much -- any big difference. The only thing different was\nthat they had bunks, which we didn\u2019t have in the camp, and they were treated different\nthan we were, and there was -- there was a difference in the camp, in the treatment and\nthe accommodations that they had in the POW camp than I had in -- in the concentration\ncamp.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t see anything of that nature. Although, in Munich, the -- there\nwere some Jewish kapos. That means Jewish people who obtained preference of ser --\nsupervising the Jewish working force and -- and used their force by beating Jewish\npeople as well as the Germans. And if they came and were recognized, they suffered the\nconsequences.",
        "A: Well, you know, if somebody came in there and the -- the -- and somebody recognized\nthem, and people suffered under the -- under their treatment, they had now an opportunity\nto get even with them. So, to what extent I cannot describe, because sometimes they were\nbrutal and sometimes they were not as brutal. So it -- it all depended upon the -- the\nforce. It could have been two people, it could have been 10 people who -- who were\ntogether and suffered, you know, and they got even with them. But it was, in my opinion,\nthe -- in my o -- in my opinion, legitimate and it was r-right to -- for the revenge. So, it\ndidn\u2019t happen very often, so, you know, it is -- 1t is a matter of -- that the card -- the card\nhave turned. You know, it is a -- a fact that the people never thought that they going to\nface the -- the facts, and the day of judgment came.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: At occasions I did, yes.",
        "A: Well, the -- I -- I remember two or three of them in Munich, you know. In Munich, it\nwas a -- a point, you know, a meeting point and that was the Munich museum. And th-the\nJewish people met there, because it was a very large place where you could congregate. It\nwas not within the traffic, it was out of the -- out of sight and that\u2019s where people met and\nit was known all over Europe. So even people from Italy and Poland, or whatever, you\nknow, they heard about and that\u2019s -- if they looked for somebody, that\u2019s where they went\nto see and meet people. And that\u2019s where -- where these things happened, you know, and\nit didn\u2019t take much, because there were a lot of people there, to create the -- the -- you\nknow, tumult. And that\u2019s -- that\u2019s where it happened.",
        "A: Now, it -- it also happened at the Jewish office in -- in -- in Munich, where people met\nto register for certain purposes, and there was also a meeting point there, so it also\nhappened there, but not very often.",
        "A: It happened more at the Jewish mu -- at the -- not Jewish, but at the museum in\nMunich. So, it was a very knowledgeable point and it was very well done, I must say.",
        "A: Well, they were physically attacked and beaten and that\u2019s all. They were not shot or\nkilled or some like that. But they were beaten up. They got their -- their point -- their --\ntheir point across in that -- that respect.",
        "A: Well, naturally they -- they -- everybody who gets attacked or something like this,\nalways says something to defend themselve, but the -- the main issue was that they said,\nyou know, \u201cWe were just prisoners like you and somebody had to do it, and we were\nselected, so we had to do it.\u201d But, you know, there\u2019s a difference, like the same thing\nwith the Germans, that you can do something, and you can do it two ways. You can do it\njust to do it or you can put some personal hatred and force behind it and make it worse\nthan it could be. And that is the issue and that\u2019s what they did, because the same thing the\nGermans, I mean, they we -- they were soldiers, but they were soldiers to defend\nthemselves, but to go and put the personal atro-atrocity in the -- 1n -- in the -- in the\nmovements, in the facts, that what killed so many people.",

And he --\nSomebody else say, \u201cWell, while they in the camps, why don\u2019t you kill them?\u2019 And\nthat\u2019s what they did, you know, they just carried it further and further, so it was more\npersonal hatred 1n it, than there was a -- more of to carry out -- to carry out an order.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, at that time, money was no object, because we didn\u2019t get any money. We didn\u2019t\nneed any money because the food we needed to live on, we got from the soldiers and\nfrom the German, t -- who had to look for our well being, so that part, there was no -- no\nneed for. We -- We got some shirts and dresses and all that from the POW, which at the\ntime, one shirt was enough. We didn\u2019t live like -- like you live today, that you change\nyour shirt every day. And our job for the time after the war, where there was nothing\navailable and everything that we had was -- for us was appreciated and grateful, because\nwe were in the camp, we had only one shirt on for months and months and months and\nwe were full with -- with the lice and all that, so 1-1t was hundred percent improvement.\nSo we sort of kept -- kept going.",
        "A: Well, we were very lucky, because in the POW camp, there was a doctor and he told\nus and warned us not -- not to eat too much and to overeat, because our stomach was not\nin -- in the condition to absorb a lot of foods and especially not any fat food. So we took\nthat -- took it under advice and we contained ourselves to dairy products and -- and it\nworked, because -- well, it didn\u2019t work with me, but 1t worked, because I later on found\nout that I had -- have a peptic ulcer and when I came to the United States, I found it out\nand, you know, and -- but, by and large, a lot of people died after the war, from being fed\nby the English army, more food and fat food than they should have had. So there was a\nlot of people that died after the war, on account of the liberation and eating things that th-\ntheir stomach was not equipped to handle.",
        "A: Well, I ate like a -- the -- like you call today, oatmeal and grits -- grits, and pudding\nand milk. A lot of cheese. Not much butter, and eggs and a lot of vegetables. And that\nhelped me to stay a little bit healthy than the -- than the other people were after the\nliberation.",
        "A: Yes, there was a -- there was a farm attached to this house -- not directly to, but it\nbelonged to the house and there was a wood -- wood sawing factory, belonging to the\nowner of the house and that was up for grabs, because the -- he liquidated it -- not\nliquidated it, he left the -- there -- vicinity of his -- you know, na -- in other words, he\nescaped the -- the consequences of being a big German officer or whatever in -- in the\ntown. So, they said, \u201cWell, he\u2019s not going to come back, maybe he\u2019s dead,\u201d and so on, so\non. But it was just after the war by hearsay and I don\u2019t know how it would have worked\nout once a nephew would have returned or something like that. But, I would have had the\ngood chance, if I would afford it, to -- to be the owner of it, because he was a high\nranking German.",
        "A: We stayed in that house about, I would say a month or so, or maybe a week longer\nthan that.",
        "A: Because it started to get a little nudgy to be by ourselves and in those days there was\nno television or anything of that nature that we knew or seen what\u2019s going on in the\nworld, other than the radio and the contact with the army personnel, which at that time\nalready, has dwindled down to people were -- were being repat-repatriated back to\nEngland and America and it got less and less people. And the camp was just about to\nbeing resol -- dissolved, and wefe -- we seen the trend and seen that we would be -- is\nonly -- would only have association with -- with a German at that -- at that particular\ntime, we didn\u2019t care much about it, to be with the Germans.",
        "A: Well, he went into Munich, like I mentioned before and he met some people that we --\nknew about it. And they said, \u201cWhat are you doing out there? You are all by yourself,\nwhy don\u2019t you come and join us,\u201d you know, and -- and that\u2019s what we did.",
        "A: It was not the camp, it was --",
        "A: No, no, no, it was not the DP camp, it was in the city of Munich, and it was ina\nprivate house that we got a -- what was it, it was two rooms and that also was that a big\nGerman officer who left and his wife was there and she remained in the house and we\njust occupied two bedrooms. And that\u2019s where we stayed til we left Munich.",
        "A: Well, it was -- I le -- I came in \u201845 to Munich and I left Munich in \u201846, but at the -- at\nthe interim, I located my father and I bought him over to Munich and we moved into a\ndifferent house, in Munich.",
        "A: Well, it is a unique -- unique s-situation. You know, like I mentioned before, that\nword of mouth can work just as well as a radio or a tel -- not a te -- yeah, even television,\nbut the only difference is that it takes longer and it is not instantly. My brother was going\non the -- was at that museum and a person approached him that we knew from before the\nwar, and said, \u201cWhat are you doing here? Your father is looking for you.\u201d And he was\nastonished and said, \u201cMy father is looking for me, and I am looking for him. So where --\nwhere is he, where can I find him?\u201d So, he gave us the location where the village where\nmy father was, where he met him and he spoke with him. So, the next day, my brother\nsays -- not the next day, but the same day, my brother said, \u201cI\u2019m going to find Father and\nI\u2019m going to see what I can do to bring him here.\u201d So, at that particular time, there was\nno transportation yet available. They had no airplanes, the train was not going and it was\nonly going with the help of the American army. So, we went to the DP camp, to the\nofficer in charge and told him what we -- what we found out, that we need some help and\nto give us a note that the American army should help us and take us along whenever\npossible, which they did. But, there were trains going -- there was one train going in the\nmorning in that direction where we had to go. So instead of standing in the street with the\nthumb, my brother took a train in the morning, for Munich, at six o\u2019clock. And people\nwere hanging on on the train outside and inside and any -- any which way. You never\nseen a train with people like that -- was just like a Christmas tree. It -- Unbelievable,\nwhere people was -- was on the outside, hanging on, just to be on the train. So, my\nbrother took that train and then he came into a town and he had to go through\nCzechoslovakia and into Poland, because that particular part used to be under Germany,\nbut it was occupied by Poland. So, after a three day travel in all kind of ways, my brother\nfinally reached the place where my father\u2019s supposed to be. So he came there and he\nfound the address and he found the house and he found the apartment, and guess what?\nMy father wasn\u2019t there any more. My father had left back to Berlin, because he figured\nthat if we survived, we would go back to Berlin, where we originally are from. And he --\nhe came there and it was already three days that he was -- four days that he was gone, and\nthere was no mail, there was no telephone to get in touch with me, to tell me what\u2019s\ngoing on. So he started on his way back, which also took about three days. And he finally\narrived a week later, back, and I thought he would come back with my father and he said,\n\u201cGuess what? You know, I came there and there was there and Father was gone, he was\nin Berlin.\u201d So he said, now I should travel to Berlin to find him. I said, \u201cNo, you have the\nexperience. You go and you travel to Berlin.\u201d So we waited a wee -- a week and -- til he\ngot rested up [indecipherable] and then, about a week or 10 days later, he started out to\nth-the travel to Berlin and he met -- he traveled to Berlin, which also took him about\nthree days or four days and he met my father in Berlin. So --",
        "A: Well, he had the address, when he an -- when he went to Poland, to that apartment\nthere, people knew him and my father left an address, that in case somebody comes to\nlook for him, that that\u2019s where he\u2019s going to be. And he met him there and naturally the --\nthe joy was grateful and -- and my father was -- was very sick and it was a friend of his,\nwoman friend, that knew him from before the war, and cared for him. And she went with\nhim to Berlin. So, there was a big discussion about going to Munich and finally they\ndecided to do it. And the transportation and the situation started to stabilize a little bit and\nwe decided that -- to wait another month or so for them to come to Munich. So, he came\nback and then they waited a month or so and they started out to come and join us in\nMunich. And meanwhile, we got into a bigger apartment in Munich, and when they\ncame, which was shortly after, we were ready for them and had the -- had the apartment\nand all that, so it was a nice welcome and to -- to see them after all these years. And my\nfather was very sick and he -- he felt much better and you know, and he had to be nursed\nback and she did a good job on doing that. Meanwhile, they got married, by the way.",
        "A: Well, the both of us were at the railroad station and we again went --",
        "A: My brother and me -- and I, we were at the railroad station and we met them. It was a\nvery dramatic move to -- to be confronted, and you know, after all, it was about three\nyears or so that we didn\u2019t see each other and under the circumstances we didn\u2019t see each\nother was very, you know, very moving. So, we took him and you know, and we\nproceeded to the apartment. We had a dinner there and you know, and celebrated.",
        "A: I -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t remember what it was, I -- but it was a -- he had a -- he had a --\nwith his heart he had something wrong.",
        "A: He was very sick man when he -- when he -- when we seen him.",
        "A: Well, we sort slowly and surely told our stories, you know, because you know, to talk\nabout it very -- each one of us to talk about it, it takes hours for each one to tell you the\nstory. So, you know, it took days, when we were sitting down for dinner or for breakfast\nor something like this, you know, and we memorized it, you know, wh-when -- last time I\nhad breakfast in -- in this and this camp, you know, and it was like this, 1t was like that,\nyou know, and then we had to go to work outside, in March and it was raining and it was\nsnowing, it was cold, it was freezing. You know, all these things came -- came out after\nyou met and you talked. So it was a very, you know, it was a very discu -- big discussion\nevery time the subject came up and it came up very often.",
        "A: Yes, it did.",
        "A: No, actually, actu -- actually, I was in the camp when I found out that my father 1s in\nthat next transport that\u2019s supposed to come into the camp. And knowing what I said then,\nI say that again, that you know, to be together with your father and see the atrocities that\nare being done to people, and not be able to defend yourself, I personally -- the type of a\nperson that I am, I don\u2019t think that I could s -- could stand still and -- and watch it. So, I\nchoose to leave that camp and go to -- I -- I choose -- there was an opportunity, let\u2019s put it\nthat way, which it was, you know, to leave the camp and go to another camp and not be\ntogether with my father. And here, again, I must say, you see how news travel, without --\nwithout electronic help. Without a radio and anything else, you see? It just -- that -- if you\nhave a name and you are known, and people know you, or something like that, word gets\naround and that\u2019s how I found out about it. Again, you know, that my father is on the\ntransport, you know. And 1s -- is bound -- is bound to be at the same camp, which\nactually happened.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes, I told him, and he said that I did a good choice.",
        "A: Well, I -- He didn\u2019t have to say why, because this is self explanatory, because about\nthe -- the living conditions, the -- the way it was -- you were subjected to certain\npunishments sometimes, because you didn\u2019t work fast enough and you didn\u2019t do -- walk\nfast enough and all -- all kind of things, you received beatings from the German guards.\nSo, you know every time you see somebody get sent, you know it\u2019s -- it\u2019s like -- like you\nget hit yourself, because you had to be a -- a witness of 1t and you know, it is like one Jew\nis -- 1s like your -- your brother, you know, and you feel that -- the -- the pain you go\nthrough by being treated that way. So, it is a -- a natural instinct.",
        "A: My stepmother --",
        "A: No, at that time, we -- we didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t have the friend.",
        "A: My brother had a friend from -- from -- from that time that he was in the camp with.\nHe was -- When I came into -- to Dachau, I was all by myself, because everybody I had,\nor I knew, was either not alive any more. I was walking with one friend of mine, from the\n-- on the Death March and he said -- we stopped one night in to -- in the barn and he said,\n\u201cT\u2019m not walking any more, I am going to hide here.\u201d And I told him, \u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\nyou know what they going to do, they\u2019re going to take matches and burn the barn down,\nin case somebody\u2019s hiding there. And I don\u2019t have no interest to be burned. So I -- I\u2019m\ngoing to go.\u201d He says, \u201cI can\u2019t any more.\u201d And he -- he remained 1n the barn while the\ntransport continued to walk and after the war, I met him, he made it, yes.",
        "A: Well, he was liberated about six months before me.",
        "A: I -- I found him, I think it was in -- in Israel I think I found him.",
        "A: Yeah, and there was a meeting of the Holocaust survivors from all over the world.",
        "A: Well, I -- I bil -- never -- I been looking for my mother ever since, and -- but I know\nthat -- I -- I know from Auschwitz, because I know that there was a -- some person in the\n-- what they called the Sonderkommando -- that means a special detail and he worked in\nthe crematorium and he was from that particular town in Poland where we lived before\nthe war. And he knew the transport that came and he knew the people he bor -- he\nburned, and among them was my late mother. So, he told me that in Auschwitz, after --\nwhen things started to get uncertain, the people who were working in that kommando,\nwere not permitted at the time to mix with other prisoners. But a-at the -- at the time\nwhen things started to come to a end in Auschwitz, they allowed the prisoners to mingle\nwith the -- with the spi -- Sonderkommando with the special detail and he told me that --\nthat my -- that my mother was -- was burned and I got that information from some other\npeople as well.",
        "A: Oh, that was in 1945.",
        "A: Well, da -- that was at -- when I still was in Auschwitz, at the end of \u201844 and \u201845, that\nwas when things started to get rough in Auschwitz and the Russian army came and they\nwere so -- sort of fi-figuring on liquidating Auschwitz.",
        "A: Well, I tried through -- through the Red Cross and tried through the several -- Yad\nVashem and all the other things, you know, register. There\u2019s no answer.",
        "A: Just in case they were wrong, yeah, well, you know, we never give up the ho -- you\nnever give up hope.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s right. You never give up hope, so that\u2019s what I did, what -- what I -- I\nknow pretty much that, unfortunately, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s the truth, that she -- she vanished in -- in\nAuschwitz.",
        "A: We did not go to a Displaced Person camp, no. We -- We -- We were in Munich and\nwe were in touch with the Jewish community. We were in touch with the Joint\nDistribution Commits -- Committee. We were in touch with the UNRRA, which was the\ndepartment from the American government and we kept abreast of all the going-ons that\nwas -- that was to be known.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: That was the name of the village -- of a German village --",
        "A: -- where this Displaced Person camp was established.",
        "A: We -- We were there maybe for a day or two, that\u2019s all, you know.",
        "A: But we seen the camp-like situations and we had enough of that, so we thought we\nfend for ourselves, what -- what you can do, you know\u201d?",
        "A: Well, my brother and I, we were talking about it and we felt that Germany is not going\nto be nothing, it\u2019s just going to be pieces of land and [indecipherable] wouldn\u2019t be any\nfuture for us, because it is going to be a very controlled country, because what Germany\ndid and carried on and little did I know that there would be a martial plan and all the\nother things that put Germany into -- pro-propelled Germany into a top position and the\nway it is today. And today I am sorry that I did move out from -- from Germany, because\nI could have been financially the better situation to come to the United States\n[indecipherable] was. And I could have re-reaped from the fruits of the Black Market,\nand like I said, I could be in a better position in the United States as a refugee the way I\ncame than I -- if | would have waited another two years, is all.",
        "A: Well, if you ask me, then yes, I -- I -- I will say -- I will say so. Because I -- I --\npersonally left for the solid rea -- solid reason that I thought that Germany will be no\nmore Germany, it will be a poor country, it will be a -- under control. It would not be\ngiven the liberty that it enjoys today and enjoyed right after the war. And I -- I -- I must\nsay I was wrong, because politics sa -- play -- play -- are strange bedfellows. That\u2019s wa --\nThat\u2019s what it boils down to. But you cannot look into a crystal and know what -- what\nthe -- the future brings, because lot of people would commit suicide if they knew what --\nwhat -- what would happen to them in the future. But, nevertheless, the way it is, you\nknow, it is -- it\u2019s came, but 1n a -- in a different way and a harder way, that I had to learn\na lot of experience by being here in the United States.",
        "A: Well, like I mentioned before, we decided that -- that since we figured that Germany 1s\nnot going to be any more anything in the -- in -- in -- in this -- in the world, it is better to\ngo to a country which 1s going to give us some possibilities. And at that particular time,\nthere was a note at the Joint Distribu-Distribution Committee that President Truman\ngave 20,000 visas to Displaced Persons. And being that my brother was working in the\noffice of the -- of the Joint Distribution Committee, he knew about it and he registered us\nto -- to go to the -- to the United States.",
        "A: Well, no, it -- 1t came -- it came pretty quickly, because we were -- we got the\npermission to go in 1946, in June, but unfortunately, a seaman strike developed in the\nUnited States, and the ships did not go to the United States. So we had to wait til the\nstrike is settled and then we were able to go to -- into the United States.",
        "A: Yes, all four. We came together.",
        "A: Well, we were told to go to -- in September 1946, we were told that our ship is going\nin September to -- to United States, that we should proceed to the staging area -- area in\nBramer harbor, which we proceeded to do so. We arrived in Bramer harbor, we found out\nthat the ships are not going and we waited in Bramer harbor three months, until the sh --\nthe strike was settled, and in January third, I believe it was, 1947, we boarded the USS\nErnie Pyle, which was a troop carrier ship, and proceeded on an eventful trip to the\nUnited States. The eventfulness was that it was a stormy -- very, very stormy voyage. For\na week, we did not leave the berth. The ship was cordoned off with ropes. We could not\nmove it, because that\u2019s how the ship was moving, up and down. And the captain took a\nside trip over, to avoid the storm, to get out of it, over Canada, which was worse, because\nit was very icy there. So, in all, the trip took us about 14 -- 14 days and we arrived here in\n-- in New York, on January the 14th or 15th, 1947.",
        "A: Yes, yes, we sailed into New York harbor, and to see the Statue of Liberty and all that\nwas a very, very moving event and it was docked on -- I think it was on pier number 86,\nand we were greeted by the press and all that, you know. And then we were also greeted\nby the Joint Distribution Committee, who took care of us and lodged us in the Hotel\nMarseilles, on 103rd Street and Broadway. And we were really glad to feel some solid\nground under our feet and that -- that was the event of our voyage, as far as that is\nconcerned. I -- I was -- I was lucky I didn\u2019t get seasick, but 99 percent did.",
        "A: Well, all kind of thoughts went through my mind. How am I going to get a job, how\nI\u2019m going to work, how I\u2019m going to make a living, or -- you know, all these things this\ncome -- come to -- to your -- to your mind. And it is a, you know, it is, you know, it is a\nmoving, moving situation. It -- You know, it -- as a young man, you -- you -- you don\u2019t\nknow what -- what you -- I didn\u2019t have a profession and here I\u2019m 20 years old and you\nknow, it -- I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m 22 already -- am about to be 22. But it leaves -- it gives you fa -\n- some food for thought. So, we landed in va -- at the Hotel Marseilles and we met some\nother people here who came with -- two transports before, because we were only the third\ntransport to come from --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, at -- at that time, to have people surviving from a concentration camp come to\nthe United States, 1t was a rare situation, and the press ask us about our experiences in the\ncamp and about the voyage and all that, because we were way overdue, on account of the\nstorm that we had on the Atlantic. So, that was the reason there was the press there. And\nat that time, you know, to have people survive the concentration camp, it was a novelty,\nnot -- not like today. I mean, 50 years later is -- is more than 50 years ago, you\u2019re right. It\nis -- It was a novelty here, to be a survivor and the press was there, hungry to have news\nfrom -- from the concentration camp that we were -- were in.",
        "A: I personally, no. I didn\u2019t talk to them.",
        "A: No, no",
        "A: They selected who they wanted to talk, you know, it -- and to be honest about it, at\nthat particular time I was more interested what\u2019s going to be and where I\u2019m going, that to\nget -- to give a -- a -- an interview.",
        "A: I would say maybe 150 or so, ma-maybe less. It was a troop carrier and there weren\u2019t\nmany people there.",
        "A: Perhaps a small suitcase, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s all. I mean, the -- the clothing that we\nacquired in the time that we were liberated, because don\u2019t forget, from 1945 to 1947 is\nonly three years and we were not in the -- financially in the -- in the great position to -- to\nob -- to obtain anything, and we all -- and I felt that Germany is not going to be my\nhome, so why should I go out and settle myself with things and clothing? If I go to\nAmerica, the style is not the same and, you know, so you have to get rid of it anyhow. So\nthat\u2019s why we just had a small suitcase and -- and that\u2019s all.",
        "A: Well, I was overwhelmed by the -- by the big buildings. Don\u2019t forget, I was -- I used\nto live in the big city, Berlin, which doesn\u2019t compare to New York, but it\u2019s nevertheless a\nbig city that I think, [indecipherable] million inhabitants. And the -- the city in itself\ndidn\u2019t make a big impression on me, just the big buildings and tall buildings and how\neverything worked, and you know, how it feels to be 1n a -- in a tall building and not\nbeing afraid of the [indecipherable] when there\u2019s a strong wind.",
        "A: We just went off the ship. That\u2019s all.",
        "A: Yeah. No, no, no examination, no nothing. It\u2019s -- Went right straight -- straight\nthrough. No car -- I -- I -- I don\u2019t believe we had any customs, I don\u2019t believe that either,\nno.",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t know that we\u2019d be going to the Hotel Marseilles, but we know that we\nare going to be greeted by the Joint at the pier and they will take us to the -- to the hotel\nand they had buses to take us to the hotel.",
        "A: Well, it -- it wasn\u2019t the -- the -- the Park Plaza, or it wasn\u2019t the Waldorf Astoria, but it\nwas an acceptable hotel, it was -- it was nice there, the kitchen there for us, where we\ncould obtain food. And it wa -- it was occupied I think by elderly people and not the\ntransients or something like that. So, it was -- but when we moved in, it was -- it changed\ncompletely because the Joint opened an office there and people came and you know, and\nsome people found relatives and you know, they came and visited and all that, you\nknow? It did -- started to be a different -- a different picture than it was before. And, you\nknow, it -- I think that the Joint moved the hotel up in prestige.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. Because, well, it -- it made -- it made an impression on me like I had in\n-- in -- in Germany during the war, when we got -- not during the war, but when we got\nliberated and in Munich, the museum, that people came, they met there and all of a\nsudden, here in New York, it was the hun -- 103rd Street Hotel Marseilles. So, that\u2019s\nwhere everybody came and you know, and other things happened there, I mean a lot of\nthings happened that -- family members met there that haven\u2019t seen each other for 30 - 40\nyears. And it was quite -- I should say interesting, yes.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, yes, many reunions. And something happened to me personally, 1s that\nwhile we were there, we received a -- a newspaper from -- which caters to German\nclienteles and being from Germany is -- I had interest of reading it, and we notice that\nthere is a Purim dance. That is a holiday, festive, joyous holiday and they have a dance\non -- I think it was on 47th Street in New York. So my brother said, \u201cYou know, let\u2019s go\nthere and see if we meet some people.\u201d I says, \u201cYes, what-whatever I g-got to lose,\u201d you\nknow? So, we went there and lo and behold, I all of a sudden see my school friend from\nBerlin there. We -- We were buddy - buddy, you know. We used to go to school together,\nwe used to play together, w-we used to stay with each other. His parents knew me and I\nwas in their house and you know, it was a very familiar relationship. But I knew, and I\nsaid goodbye to him in Berlin when he went to Crooba. And very little did I expect him\nto see in New York. So then I -- I went there and I confronted him, he didn\u2019t know what\nto think, whether it was that the dead people got recreated or whether, you know, he\ndidn\u2019t know what to -- what to think. So, I said, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s me,\u201d and so on, so forth, you\nknow and we cu -- hugged each other and kissed each other, and you know, and the\nparents were there and it was -- it was an unbelievable picture. And with him also were\ntwo other friends that I knew, and I was befriended with and -- also from Berlin, from the\nsame class that I used to go with and we became friends again and still -- still as today,\nwe still friends, and see each other and go to each other\u2019s occasion, weddings and Bar\nMitzvahs and all that here. And that what happened. His parents passed away meanwhile,\nbut we -- we still are very much in touch with sha -- with each other. And that happens\nout of the blue sky. So, you know, it -- things -- things happen in life. Never, never\nthought that that would happen.",
        "A: Well, to be honest about it, there\u2019s no explanation there. That\u2019s -- It\u2019s the same way I\nmet barba -- my brother, after five years in the camp, you know, I never thought it would\nhappen. And here, you know, is like -- like -- like you say in -- in Jewish, it 1s pershared,\nyou know, that it is meant for you to -- to go through this experience. So, I take it in that\nrespect. That, you know, it was meant for me to meet him.",
        "A: Luck? I -- I wouldn\u2019t say that it is. It\u2019s -- It\u2019s meant to be, you know, like some\npeople cross the street and get hit by a car. An-And so how -- how do you explain that?\nIt\u2019s being in the wrong place at the wrong time or right time, or whatever it 1s. So -- But it\nhappens and that\u2019s -- in my opinion, that\u2019s the way life 1s, so you know, it 1s a\nunpredictab -- unpredictable situation that you can -- you know, your -- you encounter in\nyour lifetime. So it is, you know, God -- God steers your way in life, and that\u2019s -- that\u2019s\nwhy you go to synagogue on Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah, you beg for forgiveness\nand beg, you know, not -- not to die in the course of fire or in -- by sword, by -- by -- or\nby a gun or so on, so forth and -- and then it\u2019s up to the Almighty -- Almighty. So this is\nthe -- a matter of, how you call, destiny, yeah.",
        "A: Yes, yes, I -- I believed very much in it, because the way things have happened to me\nand the way things are in my life, you know, I always say that God is with me and -- you\nknow, and steers me the right way. So, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s one outlook I have in my life and\nnobody -- nobody can -- can -- can foresee his own destiny, because things change and\nthey can change very rapi -- very rapidly, without your [sneezes]",
        "A: Thank you -- without your having any -- [sneezes]",
        "A: Oh, I\u2019m sorry.",
        "A: -- with ha -- without having any control over it, y-you see, and there\u2019s nothing you --\nnothing much that you can do about it. You have accept it and live with it and make the\nbest of it. And that\u2019s the way I feel.",
        "A: Well, I must say yes, it did. Because, when the war ended, I said, what -- what is it\ngood to be and believe in God, when things have happened and I have seen and noticed\nand be par -- was part of it, that God let this happen. And believe me, I\u2019ve seen a lot -- a\nlot of atrocities, a lot of children die, a lot of innocent little children die, a lot of people\ndie and it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a time that I said, it\u2019s enough, but then I found out that without\nreligion, without believing in somebody, you can\u2019t live. So, I turned back and became --\nbecame a Jew. It didn\u2019t take long, only about four weeks or so.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, I -- I -- I felt I was missing something in my life and I knew that what I was\nmissing and I turned back.",
        "A: Well, in -- there was a -- the army initiated the services that were every Friday night\nand so on, so forth. And then Passover came and Rosh Hashanah came and you know,\nthere was services available and all that, so I sort of participated in 1t and you know, and\nfelt that that\u2019s what it -- that is what I was missing. So, if you want to call me a return\nJew, I don\u2019t know. But, it was the -- it was the fact that -- that, you know, after all you\nsee and ask yourself, where is God? And then -- And then you miss it, then you return.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Well, during the camp, I -- I -- I had -- I had occasions and instances where I was\nsaved and I could have perished and I wasn\u2019t -- I -- I didn\u2019t perish and you know, it\u2019s --\nit\u2019s -- it -- | had my -- my strength to believe that there\u2019s a God and the God 1s -- wants\nme to live and you know, that\u2019s what it is. So, at the particular time I was in camp, I\nbelieved in, but when I came out of the camp and I knew the -- the exorbant amount of\npeople who perished in the Holocaust, six million people and what they did --\naccomplished by -- by destroying the Jewish people, I sort of had my -- my second\nthought about it. But, then I found out that you have to have something to believe in. So,\nthat\u2019s when I started to be Jewish again.",
        "A: That was right after --",
        "A: -- yeah, right after, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, I was diagnosed to have a par -- peptic ulcer here, I was sent to a hospital to --\nfor treatments and nervous depression, all kind of other things. And the Joint tried to give\nme a job and they went as far as sent me to Rochester because I had an address there\nfrom a friend of mine -- from a friend of mine from the camp who had a sister living in\nRochester, and they gave me the address of the Joint, thought they have somebody, so\nthey sent me to Rochester and this didn\u2019t work out, I came back. They finally got us a --\ngot us in a -- an apartment in -- in the Bronx and -- and furniture and the -- so we moved\nout of the hotel to the apartment in the Bronx. And to get a job at that time was pretty\nhard, because the American soldiers started to return from the army and they all had the\nright to get -- get their job back, so it was pretty hard. And then I finally found a job and I\nwas working there 56 hours a week.",
        "A: The job was in the automobile trade, as a -- I's -- wanted to be a mechanic and they\ntold me that they will teach me to be a mechanic.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: In the Bronx.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: Weissman and Company. Weissman Incorporated.",
        "A: Is wa -- It was a Lincoln - Mercury dealer. And I worked there 56 hours a week for 30\ndollars a week.",
        "A: And there was a time that I felt I was working just as badly as in the concentration\ncamp. And honestly speaking, if I had money, I would -- would have returned to\nGermany, because I was just a prisoner of war here, and going to night school and I had\nto help the family maintain the apartment. We had to pay rent, we had to pay grocery\nbills and all that. And f-for me, there was little left from the 30 dollars, because taxes\nwere taken out and I was left maybe with three or four dollars in my pocket and here I\nhad my friends and we went out. Although, everything cost not like today, in 1999 that\nyou pay for a pack of cigarettes, two and a half dollars. In those days it cost 25 cents.\nAnd -- But 25 cents is 25 cents and if you don\u2019t have it, no matter what it is, it is not\nthere. And 1-it\u2019s -- it\u2019s started to -- to drain on me that what did I need it for? I could have\nbeen in Germany, I could have been being German -- not citizen, I never wanted to be a\nGerman citizen, but having certain advantages in Germany, I could have made -- made\nsome money there, better than here. And the only thing that -- what held me back, that I\ndidn\u2019t have the money for a passage on a ship. Because airplanes, tha -- those days cost\nan enormous amount of dollars and I was -- I -- I -- I was determined, you know, if I save\nenough money, I might go. But, to save money with four dollars a week, wouldn\u2019t -- it\nwouldn\u2019t go very fast.",
        "A: Well, I was very much interested 1n cars. I had an uncle who had a car business in\nBerlin and whenever I had the chance to be in his shop and in his business, in the\nshowroom, it\u2019s where I was, and you know, and he sort of spent time with me and\nexplaining things at that time, and you know, it sort of caught on. I knew it -- my -- my\ndream, to become a professional was gone, because you need a lot of money for high\nschools and colleges and all that. And I didn\u2019t have anything to look forward, to obtain\nthe kind of finances that I need.",
        "A: To become a professional, either a doctor, or -- and -- but unfortunately, I could not\nmake these dreams come true, because we had the family, we had the obligations, we had\nthe rent to pay and like I mentioned before, it\u2019s not only the rent, you h-had the electricity\nand you had, well heat was with the rent, but --",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: My brother was a commercial artist. He painted pictures and he was decorating\nwindows and he was making signs, you know, advertising signs.",
        "A: When I came, I spoke a few -- well, I was not completely knowledgeable in the\nEnglish, but I went in -- my time when I went to school 1n Berlin, I took -- we had\nEnglish classes, so I had English instructions and English knowledge about the alphabet\nand all these things, you know. I had the basic knowledge about the English language and\nI spoke a few words, to make myself understood. But to carry on a conversation was --\nwas not enough.",
        "A: Well, like -- like I mention, I could communicate to the extent that I could make\nmyself understood, but I couldn\u2019t carry on a complete sentence. I mean, I couldn\u2019t pick\nup a telephone and answer the telephone and ca-carry on a conversation, or tha -- tha --\nthings of that nature. But I knew how to write English and I, you know -- but I wasn\u2019t\ndumb and I learned fast, so I went to -- to high school and -- on a night course, which I\ngraduated after couple of years.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It was the Theodore Roosevelt High School in -- in the Bronx.",
        "A: Whoever wanted to, th -- went, you know, took that night school and -- and graduated\nto get a diploma, so -- so you can further yourself in your life.",
        "A: Well, you know, these things did not leave any -- leave a mark -- didn\u2019t leave any\nmark, because we had quite -- quite a bit of tense moments in our lives. And it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a -\n- it di -- it -- it left 1t\u2019s mark, you know, it does not just wash off your shoulder. So, you\nknow, there\u2019s certain things that were left and that had to be treated.",
        "A: Well, [indecipherable] it\u2019I] take another four hours here, for me to ta -- you know, my\nlife 1s -- 1s -- is very, very complicated and a few sentences I want to -- I want to mention\nthem to you, so it\u2019ll be recorded, but when we went -- when we went from Berlin to\nPoland, and Poland was overrun by Germany, the Germans were looking for people to\ntake them and send them into the camp. That\u2019s when my brother was taken, in 1940. But,\nthere was a certain resistance in the younger people. They communicated with each other\nby t-telling -- you know, looking out the window and shouting to each other, or\nsomething like this and -- and one guy went over six houses to da -- to a friend of his and\ntold them what we heard, that there\u2019s going to be a -- a aktion tonight, that kids are going\nto be taken out of the home. So we went -- acrossed fields over to an abandoned house\nthat was miles away --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: The soap factory, and we went there many a times to hide from them and then, being a\nyoung person like I was at that time and trying to do things to stay alive and know we\nhad a radio in the attic, hidden in that particular building that we were, and we were\nlistening to BBC London to get the foreign news, what\u2019s doing in the -- on the war scene,\nor on the war front. And if you get caught there, that\u2019s the end of you. To see through that\nparticular town where I lived, it was only about 15 kilometers away from Auschwitz. We\nseen the buses going through every day, with the windows painted black and yelling and\ncrying and all that. At -- That was before I got into the camp. I was in the camp, I was\nsick of typhus, which is the deathly disease. We didn\u2019t have any medications in the camp,\nwe didn\u2019t have a thermometer in the camp, le-let alone enough food to get you back to be\nstrong, and people died like flies. And in -- in Auschwitz, I was in -- in a -- when the\ncamp started to be liquidated, the doctors didn\u2019t want to go, they wanted to have a full\nsick camp, to be -- to say that we are needed, you got a full camp here, you know, sick\nbar -- sick barrack. I got into becud I -- because I had a rash on my chin. And the sick\nbarrack had two da -- two doors. One where you got in and the other one where you got\nout into the oven, to the crematorium. And I was on a transport from -- fo -- after the\nDeath March, we came into a camp which was close to the Russian border -- not Russian\nborder, but Polish, Germany border and this camp would have been liquidated in another\nweek or so, and they started to liquidate, having transports going out there, which, it was\nwintertime and yes, wintertime in the eastern section of Europe is pretty strict, is\ntemperatures below zero constantly. Snowfall is in feet measured, not in inches, and the -\n- the trans -- I was attached to a transport going to Dachau in an open car, a railroad car.\nAnd subjected to the snow, the frost and the cold and all that. And 75 percent of the\ntransport died. And when we came to Dachau, the camp commander gave us quarantine.\nThat means that we were isolated and not subject to go to work, which 1s very, very rare\nin German concentration camps. And so I -- I -- I feel that these things that happened to\nme and I just mentioned few of them, are very significantly my -- my -- my life. So, you\nknow, it is -- and then, afterwards, you know, that I -- I managed to escape from the\ntransport with my brother and getting out -- you know, when we escaped, and we ran into\nthe woods, I -- I don\u2019t want to go into details, but that -- there were -- the situation that\nwe were confronted with the German army, where they ask us, \u201cWhat are you doing\nhere? You\u2019re going towards the front. I mean, we going away from the front. What are\nyou going there for?\u201d We ran into German soldiers that were dug in, in the woods, you\nknow, to wait for tanks to come, to attack the tanks. And we also ran into a farmhouse\nthat was full of German soldiers. I mean, you know, I -- I -- I -- I got instances, more than\none, but I don\u2019t want to go into these -- these details to stretch it out, you know, to make\nit -- make it a lengthy interview and people might not be interested to listen to it.",
        "A: So that\u2019s why I\u2019m just getting the most important points and tell you about what\nhappens. So that\u2019s -- that\u2019s my point of view. So, you know, it is a -- a very eventful fact\nof my life and you know, and is -- naturally it takes a t-tolls in different ways and you\nknow -- which I personally have to overcome.",
        "A: No, no, I did not -- I was not treated by doctors for depression, it -- just time itself,\nyou know -- you know that and you know, my association with -- well, I didn\u2019t have any\nassociation which [indecipherable] with any particular Jewish group here, because I\ndidn\u2019t know anybody and I didn\u2019t -- I -- I -- ve -- I\u2019ve -- didn\u2019t have any occasion to\nhave any association, but I had people, they were working all -- they were eager to know\nwhat -- what happened and all that and I talked to them and you know, about the camp,\nthe time and all that, the same thing as I do today, I go to schools and churches and all\nthat -- colleges and talk about th-the Holocaust, so I got my s -- my satisfaction that way\nand sort of my -- my -- my psychonal -- my psychiatry treatment that way.",
        "A: It was a time that I sort of felt I had to work and I -- you know, it is -- I had to go, I\nhad to earn money, and that\u2019s what I choose to do and that\u2019s what I was successful in,\nkeeping the job and -- because there were a lot of other people looking for jobs and that\u2019s\n-- that\u2019s the way it worked out.",
        "A: I worked there, I think it was three years, four years, but it was interrupted -- it was\ninterrupted by me being inducted into the army -- into the United States army.",
        "A: You see, I\u2019m washed with all waters.",
        "A: I said, you see, I\u2019m washed with all waters. I was declared -- which we all were, under\nthe orders from President Truman, to be 4F, and I was curious to know what 1s 4F and I\nwrote a card to the draft board, \u201cWh-What does 4F mean?\u201d So they answered me with a\nreport to the draft board, and the draft board said, \u201cYou are eligible for the army, now\nyou go for a physical.\u201d So I went for a physical with all kind of letters from doctors that I\nam not fit, I\u2019m sick, I got an ulcer and a nervous condition. And I\u2019m to be e-excused from\nthe army. So then I got a letter to report for induction in Whitehold Street.",
        "A: In New York, yes. And I reported to Whitehold Street, and there was a Viennese\ndoctor, who said -- a Jewish Viennese doctor, who said, \u201cI now -- I realize, I see that you\nwere in a camp and -- but, I\u2019m going to put on the paper that you are sick, that you are\ndue for limited duty. But they\u2019re going to induct you.\u201d I said, \u201cWhy do you do that when\nI\u2019m a sick person?\u201d \u201cWell, if you are sick, you\u2019re going to be released from the army and\nthat\u2019s all going to be.\u201d So that\u2019s what happened. I got inducted, I went through basic\ntraining, a limited duty. The sergeant carried my bag. I got transferred to Atlanta ja -- fa -\n- I was inducted in Camp Kilmer, New Jersey. I had my basic training there. I was --\nAfter I finished my basic training, I was transferred to Aberdeen Proving Ground in\nMaryland and I was there, on limited duty, I didn\u2019t have to go on marches and parades\nand all that. And after finishing the basic training -- that was the advanced basic training\nin Aberdeen Proving Ground -- I found out that the company I was in, was slated to go to\nKorea. And after four weeks of training in Aberdeen, we will go to Atlanta, Georgia, and\nfrom there to San Francisco for shipping to Korea. So I said to myself, \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d I\nreported for sick bay every day and then they couldn\u2019t do anything more for me. They\ntook me -- well, it\u2019s a whole long story anyway, they -- they took me by the\ncommandant\u2019s car to a hospital in Georgia from the second army. I was evaluated, I was\nreturned to the barracks and I was asked to take out my personal belongings and you\nknow, stay in my bed and that\u2019s all. About two hours later, the -- an orderly came and\nsaid for me to get my bag together -- my stuff together and report to the sick bay. I went\nto the sick bay, I was put on the stretcher. About an hour later, the -- the ambulance came\nand transferred us to the airport and I was put aboard a plane with wounded soldiers from\nKorea, returning to the States. And I was -- that was Labor day weekend.",
        "A: 1940 -- no, not 1940. 1951 I think it was.",
        "A: And I was transported, then the plane did not go to it\u2019s destination, it landed\nsomewheres 1n California, near the Mexican border, in the Air Force camp. And not\nknowing what\u2019s going on or where we going, I was permitted to get out of the stretcher,\ninto a bunk in the barrack and on Labor day, we were transported by plane to\nPhiladelphia. In Philadelphia, we were transported to another camp. I forgot the name\nright now, it\u2019s a very famous camp, but I forgot the name. It\u2019s -- Maybe I got the name.\nAnyway, I was there and I was in the bed and I was receiving no treatment and after\nbeing a week there, I was called to the commandant and he said, \u201cIf you want to get out,\nwe can give you a discharge, an honorable discharge, for the convenience of the\ngovernment.\u201d That means that I cannot get any pension from the army, that they\nageravated my -- my sickness. Well, hearing that, I was glad that I had a chance to get\nout of the army and I grabbed it and I was discharged on my birthday from the army. So,\nthat was another experience in my lifetime.",
        "A: Well, first of all, I felt very bitter against the doctor, because I had all the legal and\nrightful documentation that I\u2019m not a person fit to be in the army. And then, I mean, the\nothers did -- did their job, but then again, President Truman issued a -- an order that the\npeople -- diplace pers -- Displaced Persons, who come from the concentration camps, not\nto be inducted into the armed services, which actually took -- happened. But me, wanted\nto know what is going on, why other people are going to the army and not me, I wanted\nto know what that 4F stands for. Is nothing wrong with finding out what is in your record\nand why -- why you are still, you know, entitled to know. So that\u2019s what happened with\nmy army. So I got in there and I would have stayed in the army if I would have been\ntransferred to Germany, but not -- not to Korea.",
        "A: It became known, because I was sort of a special person in the -- in the company.\nEverything that had to be done, if it was a hard job to do, I was excused. And they\nwanted to know what kind of duty do I -- what kind of a soldier am I, that I am being\naccused from all these things, you know? So, I had to tell them, you know, that my past\nexperience and my condition. So, you know, the lieutenant also wasn\u2019t very comfortable\nwith it, because you know, there\u2019s somebody that\u2019s better than -- than the others, which\ndoes not make any -- any good impression at -- on the company. But, we survived, yeah.",
        "A: No, no, no, nothing.",
        "A: Nothing of that sort.",
        "A: In New York? No, I didn\u2019t encounter any anti-Semi --",
        "A: So when I got discharged, I went back to the job, because he had to take me back and\nI rested there another couple of months and then I went out and look for another job. And\nI found another job, and in 1951, I got married, in December.",
        "A: Well, I met my wife by -- again, by chance. I went to a Jewish organization, they had\nthe -- a meeting -- social meeting on -- on a Sunday. I met -- I went there and met my --\nno, not with my brother, my brother went someplace else. I\u2019d a -- We -- I met my wife\nthere and we started to -- to date and so on, so forth. And we got engaged.",
        "A: Oh yes, she -- my wife is also a survivor. She is a -- She survived the -- she was\nhidden in the convent.",
        "A: In the convent in Belgium. And she got -- She\u2019s -- Well, she wasn\u2019t in the camp, but\nshe was separated from her parents and her brother. She was all by herself in the -- in the\nconvent in Belgium. And they tried to convince her to be a nur -- not a nurse, a -- a sister.",
        "A: A n-n-nun, yes. So, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- my wife was -- was al -- is also a survivor, yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes. It was important to marry in my same faith, because my youth and my\nupbringing was Jewish and my holidays and all that and you know, and here I have a\nJewish girl, who knew what -- what -- what\u2019s all about and -- and not only that, but she\nunderstands me, she understands my background. And we\u2019re the perfect match.",
        "A: It was not that important for me to marry another survivor, but it was important for me\nto marry another Jewish woman. That -- That was -- That was important.",
        "A: Well, naturally we talked about it, because it is a -- it is something that my behavior,\nmy things are not normal. I -- You know, I-I -- I have things that I acquired in the camp\nand that they stick with me and you know, that\u2019s a -- it\u2019s soma -- somebody who\nunderstands me.

So I just took the youngest daughter. And I showed them Berlin, and that was\nour first stop. And I arranged there to talk to German kids in the school, about the\nHolocaust and they were treated from the German government to -- they paid for their\nhotel and the entertainment. They showed them -- they took them to the opera and, you\nknow, for a week. But we -- we only stayed in Berlin two days.

And then I have a tape from a -- a radio station, there was a\n-- a question and answer radio program on the German radio and they -- the pupils that\nwere permitted to call up the station and ask them questions, you know. And all kind of\nother questions came up, you know, which I personally didn\u2019t care for, you know.",
        "A: Well, there was one question, I said, you know, that Germany never had the resistance\nand you only had about two of -- two or three people within the army on the 20th of June,\nI forgot the year, that they tried to revolt against Hitler and they -- unfortunately didn\u2019t\nsucceed, you know. So they say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s not true. We had so many this, so many\nthat there.\u201d I said, \u201cYou say that, but I never read about it in the paper, nobody ever knew\nabout it,\u201d you know. That -- th - th -- somebody did some -- some terrorist attic in the --\nin the factory, you know, that somebody got injured by doing a certain thing.

Or -- Or the -- the SS commando was -- was bombed or something like that, you\nknow, like you -- like you read today in the -- in the paper, about Israel, that they blow up\na -- a Jewish army post, or whatever it is. So I -- I -- I couldn\u2019t answer that, because it\nwas -- was the -- called into the radio station here, but I got [indecipherable] within, you\nknow, it -- it doesn\u2019t mean anything, because it\u2019s one 1n a thousand.",
        "A: I grew up in Berlin and I was 13 years old when I left Berlin.

That\u2019s -- That\nwas the purpose. No other purpose could there be, but wh-what else could I do? I mean,\nthis is the new generation growing up and they -- they are innocent, in my opinion. It\u2019s\nnot their fault that they are born by a German people. And I hoped that they might learn\nsomething from it, by me telling them what -- what took place. So, I did that, you know,\nand | -- I did if for their sake, so to speak of. Like I\u2019m going to -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m talking here\nto -- to -- here, mel I -- I didn\u2019t succeed, but I wanted to talk here, there\u2019s a German\nschool here, in White Plains that has German students there and I wanted to talk to them,\nbut 1t never materialized.",

        "A: I think so. I think so. I -- I got a very good reception from the principal. He gave me a\nbook as a -- as aremembrance. And I think I -- I left some -- some important points there.\nThat fellow German, although I\u2019m not German, but the fellow who lived in Germany,\nwas all of a sudden subjected -- subjected to these kind of treatments and endurances in\nhis life. So I -- I think that I accomplished something in that respect. I mean, I go here\nand I talk to kids in the school and you should see the letters I get back from the -- from\nthe kids, you know, that the impression they get, of what I will -- what I told them, you\nknow -- I didn\u2019t tell them all the -- the bad things, but you know, th -- they -- they -- they\ngot -- kids get something out of it.",
        "A: Yes, yes. Most definitely, because kids today are definite -- than kids when -- when I\nwas a kid. Kids today have radios, they got computers, they got all kind of -- all kind of\nhelp and they know -- they learn earlier than we started to learn and education is -- is\nadmitted in a different way than when I went to school. So, it -- it\u2019s a different ball game.",
        "A: I mean, you talk today to a three year old, he answers you already like a 15 year old.\nAnd you read in the paper that there are kids that are 12 and 13 years old, are capable of\ngoing -- of going to college in the next three years or so. And they are very few and far in\nbetween, but it happens. Never happened when we grew up.",
        "A: My motivation here is that, first of all, to tell kids that were -- things that can happen\nto one in this lifetime and to be aware of it, that things can happen, even here, with a\ndemocracy and with all the freedom that you enjoy. Because, if you stop to analyze\nthings that are going on around the world, we s -- we back in the same boat that -- that we\nwere before. Not in the same -- to the same extent, but it does happen, you pick up the\npaper and you have it in -- in Yugoslavia, you have it in Russia, you have it in India, you\nhave it -- you have it all over the world. So, people didn\u2019t learn yet, so it\u2019s still going on.\nAnd something has to be done eventually, to -- to stop all that, although they -- they\ncreated the UN -- the United Nation. The United Nation didn\u2019t do much to stop the\nkilling.",
        "A: Yes, I went -- I went three times to different places in the -- in the United States and to\n-- and to -- the first one was to Israel.",
        "A: That was in 19 -- I think it was in 1974 or \u201875. I -- I could be wrong with the year.",
        "A: But it was a very eventful gathering in -- in Jerusalem. And at that time, you know, we\n-- we were told by -- by the -- by the margaro -- by the organization that sponsored it, of\nwhich I am -- I was there on the executive board, that they spoke with Yad Vashem and it\nwas brought up that the survivors might want to establish a -- a section in Yad Vashem\nfor the people that perished in -- in -- in Auschwitz. And they got the permission to bring\na -- a gravestone with them. I mean, not a big gravestone, but a small headstone,\nsomething like that, a gravestone, whatever it is, with the name and the -- you know. And\nbelieve -- believe me that everybody in the group had one, including me. And Yad\nVashem was not prepared to accept all these -- these stones, you know\u201d? So, they told us\nto put it on the side, you know, in Yad Vashem, and -- which we did and the -- it took\nthem three years to find a -- a place and place them properly. And I took a stone there and\nI had it engraved with my late mother\u2019s name and all that. And I went to -- to Yad\nVashem and I -- I located the stone. Believe me, it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a wonder -- here again we\ngo, it\u2019s a wonder, from the hundreds of stones that were there, that I found my late\nmother\u2019s stone. And, you know, it -- it\u2019s a -- but the Holocaust meeting in -- in Israel was\nvery, very meaningful. It was only on the hotel on the wall, you know. And, again, we\nhad the dignitaries, the Israeli dignitaries address us and you know, and all that. So, it\nwas -- it was quite a -- quite a meaningful and thoughtful event that took place. But, then\nwe had one in Washington, in -- in Philadelphia, I think, with President Reagan and he\nwas also very, very thoughtful and meaningful with that. So --",

We had that same kind of a language with -- with\nus, because when -- when we seen a guard came in, you know, and he had something to\ndo and started to hit people or grab people, you know, to be executed or whatever you\nwant to call it, we -- we -- we sense it and kn-knew it, you know, and we gave each other\nnotice of it and tried to hide or tried to do something that -- not to be on the -- in the front,\nto be the first one to be caught. So, in case there was anything going on, you know, we\ntried to warn each other, but it was to no avail, because they did anyway, what they going\nto. So, in that respect, I would say yes.",
        "A: Intuition. Intuition, you know. It\u2019s certain behaviors that we have that 1s not a normal\nbehavior, let\u2019s put it that way.

On Yom HaShoah\nservices, I have about 350 people partaking and I will have a new library -- part of it\ndedicated to the Holocaust -- studying the Holocaust with computers and video games --\nnot video games, I\u2019m sorry, video machines for the movies from the Holocaust. I\u2019m very\nmuch involved with the -- with the Holocaust, yes.",
        "A: I believe my brother is involved in -- my brother lives in Florida, so -- and he tells me\nhe 1s involved and to what degree, I don\u2019t know, but yeah, I know that he\u2019s involved, yes.",
        "A: My father lived with his wife and he passed away about 10 years ago.",
        "A: Well, he -- he was a sick man, he had heart problems and -- but he -- he managed. He\ncoped with it and he was -- he tried to be very religious and he passed away on the eighth\nday of Hanukah and although that there was no eulogy permitted for the eighth day of\nHanukah, the rabbi gave a eulogy because he was a -- a good -- my -- I -- I don\u2019t know\nhow to express it, he was a good person and a -- was religious and he -- they had a lot of\nrespect for him.",
        "A: He was living in Queens.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, I -- I been living out here 35 years, so he\u2019s -- he\u2019s -- the -- it\u2019s about an hours\naway from here.",
        "A: Yeah, you know, stay close. I went to see him wa -- you know, every once -- so often\nand I had him out here to come and visit the grandchildren, and all that, you know, so it\nwas a Close relationship.",
        "A: Perseverance. Perseverance. The faith that everything will be all right, so that\u2019s --\nthat\u2019s what keeps me going. Today is today, tomorrow is tomorrow. I used to live in the\nconcentration camp from hour to hour. So, you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s one step ahead, to live\nfrom day to day. We -- We advance 24 hours, right? That\u2019s the advance we have. I don\u2019t\nbelieve to get attached to anything, as far as physically is concerned. To a house or to\nanything. It\u2019s just -- just my nature, what I have lost in life, you know, it\u2019s -- I -- I realize\nhow fast you can lose what you accomplished. So -- And there was nobody who could\nreplace it. So why get attached to something? When I had sold my house, my -- my\ndaughters came at six o\u2019clock in the morning, to -- to have a last look at the -- at the --\nthat room where -- where they were, you know? So, I felt good that they had the feeling,\nyou know, but I personally, it -- it\u2019s nothing. Just a house, just stones and bricks and all\nthat, you know. And they don\u2019t talk.",
        "A: That\u2019s another story. I have my mixed feelings. I got attached to my family and -- but\nother than that, I -- you know, it\u2019s -- you get attached to people, they -- they here today\nand gone tomorrow. And during the war, you got attached to people and they here today,\nnext hour they\u2019re gone. So, you know, it is -- and -- and -- and getting attached to\nsomebody and loving somebody and all that 1s -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s a very painful situation. And\nyou lose somebody you love and somebody you\u2019re close to and you know. Or somebody\nfrom the family, a cousin, an aunt, an uncle or that, you know, it leaves a scar 1n your --\nin your body. So, y-you can\u2019t -- you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a personal thing, you cannot\ngeneralize it. You know, I feel one way, you feel the other way and it\u2019s a -- like my -- my\nchildren, they know that they have t-two cousins and you know. Then --Not -- Not two\ncousins, they got more than that. They got [indecipherable] just two, and then they have\nsome -- some other cousins in -- in Philadelphia and they got other cousins in Los\nAngeles, but they never met them, never seen each other, you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s one of\nthose things, you know. Like here, and in America, the distance is so big that it\u2019s a\nproblem to have a family close together. Like in the old -- old times, he used to live in the\ncity and everybody used to live close by and everybody used to see each other on the\nweekend, because it was a custom that you would -- what do you -- what you doing this\nweekend? I\u2019m going to Aunt So and So and to Uncle So and So and tomorrow we going\nthere and it was a family situation. But that\u2019s all gone, because today you want to go and\nsee your brother, you have to go take an airplane and travel three hours, four hours and\nby the time you get to the airport and from the airport, so it\u2019s a days a -- a day lost.",
        "A: Well, my li -- it\u2019s a different situation, you love a wife, you love the family and you\nestablish a relationship and it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a different -- different situation between my wife\nand somebody else. I mean, you know, I can like somebody, I can love somebody, but\nit\u2019s not the same love that you have with your wife. So it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a different ball\ngame, because you can have a favorite aunt, you can have a favorite cousin, you can have\na favorite like this, you know, but you like them because the way they react, the way you\nli -- the understanding you with you\u2019re cousins or with your aunts and uncles and all\nthat. It\u2019s -- It is not the same than between -- like between a wife and a husband. So, you\nknow, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a different. You feel very bad if an -- an aunt dies or a cousin dies or\nsomething like that. But you can\u2019t say that you actually loved the person. So, there\u2019s a\ndistinction.",
        "A: A chance of what?",
        "A: Well, there are so many things that are -- that are to be talked about, but I guess we\ncovered the major items in a broad way and if there are any specifics that you would like\nme to talk about, I\u2019d be more than happy to talk. And if you review the tapes or\nsomething like that, and you -- you think or feel that there are things, you put them down\non paper and [indecipherable] come back and spend some time with me and I\u2019d be more\nthan happy to fill you in on these things and you know, we\u2019 ll make another issue out of.",
        "A: You\u2019re welcome. My pleasure.\n"
