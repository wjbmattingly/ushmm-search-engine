        "Q: Tell us your name and where you were born.",
        "A: My name is Ruth Borsos. I \u2014 my maiden name was Moser, and I was born in Frankfurt,\nGermany.",
        "Q: And when?",
        "A: Oh, when \u2014 in 1923, the 15th of October.",
        "Q: Would you tell us a little of your family life?",
        "A: OK. Sure. I had a rather normal childhood. I grew up in a middle-class family and my\npaternal grandparents lived very close to us and so did my maternal grandparents. And I\nwent \u2014 started to go to school. It was a public school. Jewish children went there, like any\nother children of the neighborhood and in 1933 it was the time that Hitler came to power.\nThings started to change radically. Nearly overnight, when we came back to school we were\nsegregated in a sense that suddenly all the children knew who are the Jews and who are not\nthe Jews, because we were received with words of \u201cdirty Jew.\u201d They started to throw rocks\nat us. We had to \u2014 every child had to learn to sing the Nazi hymn and \u2014 but soon thereafter\nwe were forbidden \u2014 the Jewish children were forbidden to sing the Nazi hymn, so we were\nsegregated and we felt it all the way from every morning that we came to school. It was\ntowards the end of the elementary school years that my parents took me out of the school and\nentered me in a special Jewish school with many other children who left the public schools.\nAnd I passed a few years in the special Jewish school, then went on to the higher Jewish\nhigh school and stayed there until 1938, and in 1938 the pogroms against the Jews of\nGermany started.",
        "Q: Could you describe those pogroms?",
        "A: Sure. The pogroms were only an excuse of what had happened. A young Jew in Paris was\nvery aggravated because his parents had been sent to Poland and he took revenge by\nshooting a German diplomat. And, as you might know, in November the 9th, 1938, the\nfamous Kristallnacht' broke out and it was because as a revenge, as a retaliation against the\nJews, because this man had murdered a German diplomat. But what I know was that Jewish\nstores were attacked. They were raided. The synagogues were burning. They were raided.\nCrystal Night (German); Night of Broken Glass.\nPeople stole, demolished and in general most Jewish males were picked up and sent to a\nconcentration camp. The duration during that time in the concentration camp was relatively\nshort from what happen \u2014 will happen later on. After approximately two weeks most people\nwere sent back to their homes. Now this was in '38. Already between '33 and '38 a lot of\nJews had lost their civil rights. As for instance my father, who was a lawyer, he was already\ndebarred. He could no longer go to the courts and he \u2014 doctors had lost their privileges in\nhospitals. Actors could no longer act on the, on the public stages, and so forth and so on.\nAlso in 1935 with the Nuremberg laws, a lot of discrimination against Jews occurred. There\nwas no longer inter-marriage possible. There was no longer relationship with non-Jews\npossible. You couldn't even visit a Christian home. You no longer could have a maid. If you\nhad one who was \u2014 had to be over 45 years of age, because I think the Germans were\nhorrified at the thought that their German race could be possibly defamed by some act.\nAnyway also just before that time, during all these years between '33 and '38, I recall for\ninstance that a friend of mine who always played with me, who we always together \u2014 one\nday she came and said, \"I can no longer come to your home.\" And I said, \"How come?\" And\nshe said, \"Well, my father told me I'm no longer allowed to play with you because you're\nJewish.\" So this friend disappeared and I never saw her again. Other friends, Jewish friends,\nJewish children who lived in my neighborhood, left from one day to the next because they\nimmigrated maybe with their parents or they went across the border to another country.\nWhatever, it was a terrible time of real turmoil and repression, and in 1938 after the\nKristallnacht, my family in Holland tried to get me to Holland with a children's transport.\nMy father \u2014 my parents were divorced at that time already and my\nfather was traveling in Europe and in Israel and trying to see how they could establish a new\nplace where we could live. When he came back from Palestine in 19\u2014 I believe it was 1932,\nhe proposed to the family that we should leave immediately but my mother did not want to\nand she refused to go. So when he went later to the different countries to see where he could\nget a permit to stay, it became already very, very difficult because each country only let in so\nmany so-called \u201cforeigners.\u201d In 1938 at that time he had a permit to stay for six months in\nHolland, and when I did not come with the children's transport because my papers were lost,\nhe and my uncle went to the Dutch authorities. My uncle was a very energetic man who\nreally pulled his weight \u2014 went into a meeting and said he has to have papers to get me out of\nthe country and into Holland, and he did get a permit. And he called us at night and my\nmother took me to the German border and we \u2014 my uncle's chauffeur was coming across the\nborder and picked me up and withered me through the German and the Dutch border guards\nand helped me cross the border and so I came to Holland. Now in 1938 life was pretty\nnormal in Holland. But we were, of course, strangers and first stayed with my family in\nTilburg, and later on I came to live in Amsterdam. But, but because of the work of my father\n\u2014 he was very rarely there and we lived in a boarding house and I \u2014 there was really no good\nhome life to speak of. And we always played with the idea that we had to leave Holland\nbecause there was really no good future for us.\nMy father worked at that time with the Dutch authorities who dealt \u2014 Dutch Jewish\nauthorities, who dealt with resettling refugees, Jewish refugees. He also played a role at that\ntime in as a Dutch delegate to the ship St. Louis, who was not allowed to land in Cuba. And\nhe went to, at that time, to Belgium to help rescue the people and settle in so many only.\nEach country tried to take a number of people. And Holland took some. And so he was\ninvolved with this work, so he was really very rarely there. And towards 1940 we were able\nto get a permit to get to America and in May 9th, 1940 we took the few belongings we had\nbrought out of Germany, we took those and took them to the boat in, in Rotterdam, and we\nwere supposed to sail with the Veendam the next morning, May the 10th, 1940. May, May\n10th, 1940 came. I woke up in the morning and I hear these funny little sounds and I look out\nand I see puffy little clouds in the sky and all the Dutch houses, apartment houses, have very\nflat roofs and I see people on the roof, and I wonder what's going on. Anyway I went up on\nthe roof and I see and I was told that German planes were flying overhead and they had\ninvaded Holland during the night. And I woke up my dad and I said, \u201cI don't think we'll be\ngoing to America.\u201d Well, that was it, we didn't go. And 19\u2014 May 10th, this happened, and\nfive days later the Germans capitulated \u2014 I mean the Dutch capitulated and the Germans\noccupied Holland. And pretty soon the German occupation started of Holland and of course\nwith the occupation, all the repressions against the Jews started, started out. I cannot\nremember exactly how it started out but what happened was that you no longer could pursue\nyour work in, in non-Jewish businesses. Slowly things were taken away from you. Your civil\nrights were taken slowly away. It was really a repeat of what happ\u2014 had happened in\nGermany. You had to wear a yellow star. Pretty soon you could no longer shop in the stores.\nThere were certain hours only between three and five in the afternoon. You could no longer\ngo out as much as you wanted at night because you had to be in. There was a curfew. You\ncouldn't even sit \u2014 if you had a garden, you couldn't even sit outside in your garden after the\ncurfew hours, so\u2014.",
        "Q: What was this like for you as a young person?",
        "A: Well, it wasn't very easy to grow up as a young person like that. It, it was a very bad\nexistence and the trouble was that each day something new happened and something more\nrepressive happened. And the thoughts were always in the mind, \u201cHow can we escape from\nthis and how \u2014 what can we do?\u201d The only possibility would have been to go underground.\nBut that was very difficult and it was very dangerous because you had to have the right\nconnection to people who would hide you underground. You had to have the right\naccommodations for underground, because you couldn't live freely because we all had an\naccent. So, people who had an accent were immediately prone to be discovered, even with a\nfalse passport or false ID paper or whatever it is. So for a long time we were thinking how\nwe could do that, how we could possibly find a refuge this way. There were people hidden\non the attic. There were people hidden in cellars. There were people hidden in back rooms\nfor years and years by Dutch peasants, by Dutch peo-people of good will and good heart.\nThere were also people who were betrayed, but we really never reached that stage because it\nwas not possible.",
        "Q: Had you made friends in Holland?",
        "A: I had a few friends. I did not have very many friends. I \u2014 most of my friends were refugees\nthemselves. I did go to a school for refugees, a special school because of the language\nproblems but we did get some instructions and I finished high school in Holland. And my\nfather worked at that time, as I had mentioned before, for a Dutch \u2014 for a Jewish refugee\norganization which later on turned partially into the Jewish Council and I later myself had a\nsmall job in the sewing division, making clothes for people, for German people really as far\nas I know. We never knew exactly for whom we were working and so I had a \u2014 also want to\nmention that during that during all this period I mentioned before, I believe it was in 1942,\nthat we all had to wear a yellow star. This yellow star had to be on the left side of your\nclothing. If you wore three layers that day it had to be on three layers of your clothing. It had\nto be attached. There was \u2014 you were not allowed to be able to put one finger through the\nbehind between your clothing and the star. It had to be sewn on properly, and if somebody\nsaw you on the street, you had to have ID papers, the proper ID papers with a \u201cJ\u201d in it and\nyour yellow star and if something was wrong, you were arrested. And you didn't come back\nor maybe you were arrested and were sent on somewhere right away.\nWell, also during that time, as I had mentioned to you before, during the night many times\nthe, the SS or the police \u2014 not the Dutch police but the German patrol, police or whatever\ntheir designation was \u2014 came to various homes, looked for Jews, wanted to see their ID\npapers, wanted to see whether they had special permits to stay away from being sent for\nrelocation in the east, and these special stamps were sometimes that you had a \u2014 you did\nquote, unquote, \"a very important work\" or that you had the possibility of getting a visa to\nget out of Holland via Portugal or that maybe you had instead of four Jewish grandparents\nyou had only three Jewish grandparents. There were a variety of little stamps, which were\npossible in your ID card which would delay your transport, but it didn't prevent it. So we\nwere \u2014 I personally was arrested at least three times during the night, taken to a special place\nwhich usually was the place which at one time was a Jewish theater. And you never really\nknew whether you would be released again, what would happen to you the next day. We\nwere sitting around, we were wondering and worrying what would happen, but on July the\n6th in 1943 was the biggest razzia, repression against the Jews. They, they \u2014 big cars with SS\nwere driving through the different streets with the bullhorns on top of the cars and they were\ncalling all the Jews to leave their buildings. Now for weeks and weeks and months and\n* Schutzstaffeln [Protection Squads] (German)\nmonths we knew that this day will come one day and we always had prepared ourselves in a\nsense by having a backpack ready with a few belongings to take with us. We knew that we\nwere not allowed to take many things, but they would allow us one change, one sweater, a\ntoothbrush, a pair of extra shoes, an overall and maybe a coat.",
        "Q: How did you know that? How did you know that would happen?",
        "A: It was known through the Jewish community. It was made known from the Germans to the\nJewish community that this is what is allowed. There is not allowed anymore. So you knew\nthat your day will come and you didn't know when and you knew that this is if you ever have\nto go away, this is what you can take with you. That day when we were all called out of the\nhouses, we \u2014 they marched us from wherever you lived to the central point. It could be\naround the corner. It could be a half an hour away, whatever it was, we were gathered all\naround. We are standing in the courtyard of the building for a whole day. We did not know\nwhat was going to happen to us. They didn't give us any food, no water, anything. Well,\ntowards late afternoon one of the highest SS was coming to the building, and he was doing\nthe selecting of who would be sent away and who would not be sent away. And one by one\nwe were called up to appear before him to show him our papers and he would decide. When\nmy father's turn came, he said to him, \u201cMr. Moser, you have to decide whether you and your\ndaughter will go on transport or whether you will stay behind.\u201d\u2019 He would not dispense both\nof us from transport but he would \u2014 considered my father to stay behind, so my dad decided\nthat he would stay behind, hoping that, you know, he could do something for me, he would\nbe able to get me out of this again. And we were \u2014 those who had to leave right away were\nreassembled and marching in fours down the street and I looked back and I saw my dad\nlooking out the window as, as we were leaving that street and that building. We were\nmarched towards the stadium where a big mass of people were already coming from the\nvarious neighborhoods in Amsterdam, reassembled in that stadium. And in that stadium\nwere rows of tables with Germans sitting who were registering us by name, by ID, taking\neverything we had like watches, rings, whatever we had of any little value \u2014 took it away\nfrom us.\nBut they left us with that rucksack. They went through it, too, mind you. They looked\nthrough what was in it. So, then in Amsterdam at that time the trams were running but there\nwas \u2014 that morning there was absolutely nobody on the street. They put us into the trams and\nthe trams started to roll and we did not know \u2014 we knew that we are going on transport. We\nknew that we were going to go to the camp in Holland which called Westerbork, but we did\nnot know by what means we were going. They took us with the trams and these tramways\nwere accompanied on each side by huge limousines in which all filled with SS just so that\nnobody could leave the tram, nobody could escape. They were running over the pavement,\nover the sidewalks of the street and if there were any people they had to flee up into their\napartments and houses and, and roadways \u2014 I mean entrances so that they wouldn't be just\ncrushed on by, by these SS people. But we came to a small railroad station in Amsterdam\nwhere the cattle trains were already waiting for us. Germans were standing around with big \u2014\nwhat do you call it? Big dogs, shepherd dogs, and pacing, pacing up and down the quays,\nloading the people into the cattle cars and I sort of twaddled around, I was trying to hide first\nbetween some lamp posts, a little house and so forth, and I was seeing whether it's possible\nfor me to escape from this, but I really wouldn't \u2014 didn't know because even if I were able to\nleave that railroad station, where was I going to go since I didn't know before where. But it\nwas just sort of an instinct, \u201cMaybe they can't catch me.\u201d Well they did and of course I was\none of them in the cattle trucks and we went. They closed the doors and we still were in a\nfairly cooperative spirit, you know. We try to sort of console our \u2014 one another and late at\nnight we arrived in the camp. We couldn't even really see the camp \u2014",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about the trip, what it was like on the train?",
        "A: That, that trip, contrary to the trip in the cattle truck to Bergen-Belsen, that trip \u2014 I remember\nthere were a lot of young people. I didn't know anybody. But I know there were a lot of\nyoung people in that particular compartment I was in. The ride was maybe three hours.\nContrary to the other trip I took \u2014 for days in a cattle truck \u2014 there was a much better mood\nthan there was later on. You had lived so long with the knowledge that you would be picked\nup one day, that you would be sent away one day, that you would go to Westerbork one day,\nthat now it happened. It was done. You were on the way. I mean it was nearly like no longer\n\u2014 you didn't have to expect it any longer. It was there, which 1s really a terrible thing, but, but\nit was nearly like a relief because they couldn't \u2014 they picked you up, but you knew this was\nit, it couldn't happen over and over again. So when we arrived finally at night in the camp, it\nwas already dark. We, we didn't know exactly how that camp would look. We knew it\nsmelled when we arrived there. It, 1t wasn't a very pleasant smell. And we were given \u2014 we\nhad to go through another registration, mind you. That was the second one that day, but that\nwas more that like a receipt, \u201cYes, these people have arriven,\u201d you know. And we were,\nwere told to go to various barracks. We came there. There was no light in front of it. There\nwas only this terrible stench, and you entered the barrack and you barely saw anything. You,\nyou saw a lot of things that you knew something \u2014 there was a lot of stuff toward the ceiling\nbut you didn't really quite realize what it was. Your eyes had to adjust for a long time, and\nyou wanted to find \u2014 what do you call 1t? Can you cut it a minute?",
        "Q: A cot? A bed?",
        "A: A cot. Yes, a cot. So we \u2014 I found something on the third level and I climbed up there with\nmy backpack and I came to lay next to a woman. I didn't know her. She didn't know me. But\nI remember we talked long into the night of how we got there and what our experiences were\nand so forth and so on. And the next days in the camp we were put to work, real silly work.\nWe had to carry sand from one place to the other. It didn't make sense, but we had to do it,\nand as time went by they organized us into a variety of tasks, what we had to do. Well, I was\nreally delegated to a place where we were sewing clothing, again sewing clothing, for \u2014 I'm\nnot quite sure for whom it was. That was the whole day. Sometimes we would \u2014 I worked at\na Dutch, but this was a Nazi, a Dutch Nazi farmer's farm. He had us clean out the pig sties.\nHe had us work around his farm, clean up certain things. He had us work in the potato fields,\nor whatever, so that he didn't have so much \u2014 we were slaves to him. He profited from, from\nthe camp being so nearby and from being a Nazi and collaborating with the Germans. And as\na reward he would sit us with the chickens in the yard and give us a watery soup. That was\nthe meal for the day. And we had to wear the Dutch klompen,\u00b0 you know, the Dutch wooden\nshoes and if you're not used to it and you have no socks and you have nothing proper to\nprotect you, these things are very hard and you had blisters every day. And every morning\nbefore you went to work there was somebody who took a needle and punched those blisters.\nIt was not very good. Anyway, this time passed too and a lot of illnesses broke out already in\nthis camp and I remember that I got jaundice and I was very sick.\nI mean I was so nauseated and so ill. And I didn't say that before, but every Tuesday night \u2014\nevery Tuesday the lists of those people who were going to be sent to Auschwitz \u2014 we\nassumed it was Auschwitz, we didn't know one hundred percent, but the trains came back\nfrom Auschwitz. Usually the conductor or somebody would let on where they came from, to\npick up more people and to send them off to away and towards the east. Well lists were\nassembled during the day on Monday and on Tuesday they were read off in the barracks. A\nKapo* came to the barracks and was reading off the names of those who were sent away.\nAnd as you can imagine this was some horrible, horrible times. People finding out that this\nwas really probably the end or they \u2014 we didn't know hundred percent what was going on in\nAuschwitz. We, we knew it was terrible but we didn't know exactly how terrible it was. And\neverybody would help always those who had to leave the camp. They would help them to\nassemble their stuff, to console them, to give them whatever they had, a little food left to\ngive them on the way. And it was maybe four months after that I was in this camp \u2014 the\ntrains from the razzias, from the raids on the Jews from Amsterdam and other locations in\nHolland, these trains came all the way into the camp compound. So each afternoon we\nalways heard by \u2014 there was always an underground kind of a communication. I don't know\nhow one found out. There were people who had special permits, maybe, who went in and out\nof the camp. One got little messages. This day one got the message that a big raid on\nAmsterdam had picked up the rest of the Jews, or nearly the rest of the Jews who still were\nin Amsterdam and we went to meet the train. You could \u2014 were able to do that, to go the\nquays and sure enough my father and his wife were on the train.\n* Clogs (Danish)\n* Forman (colloquial German); term used for inmates appointed by the SS to head a labor\ncommando of prisoners.\nAnd of course it was the same story for him, you know. He was integrated into doing some\nkind of labor in the camp, but end of the year 1944 \u2014 I think it was early September \u2014 we\nwere all sent to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany. And we packed up our\nbelongings. We went out to the train. There were the SS with the dogs. There was no\nescaping. There was no hiding. You \u2014 there was no means. If somebody didn't step into the\ntrain, people were shot. That was the end. So we left. We came to another ride but that was at\nleast two days if not longer in the cattle truck. And compared with the first ride and\nexperience in the cattle truck going from Amsterdam to Westerbork, this was a much sadder\nstory because we knew nothing good was expecting us, even worse than the camp in\nHolland, and that camp had a \u2014 I'm sorry, that cattle truck had some benches in there. It, it\nwas just a wooden plank. It was filled with people. You couldn't lie on the floor. You could\nstand up. You could maybe if you were lucky you got in between, you could sit on one of\nthose benches. There was a big vat and that was the toilet for everybody for two and a half\ndays. There was no food. There was no drink. There was nothing. They didn't \u2014 the doors\ndidn't open. There was a little slit in, in the cattle truck and you could look out sometimes,\nbut you didn't know where you were. I mean you only knew you were rolling, rolling,\nrolling. When we arrived in at the station closest to the camp, which was in northern\nGermany, in the Luneburger Heide, the doors finally opened and we were told to get out.\nWeakened and not very good condition already because of this days we pass in the cattle\ntruck. And I'll never forget.... First of all I personally was kicked by an SS to get out, and so\nI really fell out of the truck. But when I got up on my, my legs, I looked up and I saw this\nbridge going \u2014 a street really, a bridge, a street \u2014 going across the rails and there were\nchildren on this bridge looking down on us and yelling \u201cdirty Jews\u201d and throwing rocks.\nAnd I always remembered this because after the war I was told so many times, \u201cWell, we\ndidn't know anything about anything.\u201d And I never forget these children standing there. How\ncome they knew? How come they always \u2014 they waited for these for these railroad cars to\narrive. They knew. I know many more knew, but these children knew. Well, anyway we\nwere then led to march towards the camp, which was a long march, and I remember it was\nthrough a beautiful birch forest and I kept looking at the birches and I thought, \u201c\u201cThis 1s so\nbeautiful. How can this be? How is it possible that here we are the way, like cattle, they are\npushing us to march along?\u201d Nobody was \u2014 could stay behind. If somebody broke down,\nyou had had gotten a kick, you know. When we arrived in the camp we were assigned to\ncertain barracks and there the barracks were much narrower, much higher, many more, more\nbunks closer together and instead of one person to a bunk, we were assigned two persons to\none bunk. There was a little straw on the bunk and I ended up with Hannelore, who was my\nfather's second wife. We shared a bunk and we also shared the water, which was dripping\nfrom through the ceiling into our bunk. So we had this tiny little space to us where we had to\nput our belongings, whatever we had, plus ourselves. Two tall people in this little bunk with\nthe straw. But we shared a raincoat and so we spread that raincoat at night over us. And in\nthe morning you looked up and there was a puddle in the middle of it between the two of us.\nAnd we had to somehow get rid of the water if we didn't want to splash it just over overboard\nso to speak.\nWell, the food was minimal, to say the least. It was very bad. It was a watery soup as\nrutabagas, the smallest portion of bread which had to last for a whole week. Some people ate\nit up right away because they were so afraid that that 1t might not be there when you went to\nwork and you came back at night that somebody might have stolen it, the smallest amount.\nSo some people ate it nght away. Some people were hiding it in some ingenious way. Some\npeople couldn't make \u2014 couldn't, couldn't last for the whole week because it was really such a\nsmall portion. And the rutabagas were, were awful, too, because most of them were hard and\nif \u2014 I have seen people who did not eat the \u2014 you know, when it becomes real bad,\nsometimes dried out and gray, they took them out. And I have seen other people pick up\nthose which were taken out and chewed over by other people and take it just because of the\nhunger cause they had nothing really to eat. How one survived this I \u2014 to this day, when I\nlook back I never understand this. I, I don't understand how we could have survived, but we\ndid, with such a small amount of food. Anyway the work we had to do was another useless\nwork. We were assigned to cut out from uniforms from German soldiers which were \u2014 had\neither died on the eastern front or were shot by \u2014 I don't know by whom, but anyway and\nthey were bloody uniforms, and we had to cut off all the buttons. We had to cut off all little\npieces which were not blood-drenched and these were saved for whatever reason. The\nGermans needed the buttons. They needed the little pieces, because the war had also left\nthem with very few material goods and, and they used it to repair other uniforms, to, you\nknow, to whatever, make do. We had to work in this from morning to night.\nBut the mornings in the camp life started off that you had to go out on the Appellplatz,\u201d\nwhich means the place where everybody had to assemble. A huge place. All barracks had to\ncome there at a certain hour, early in the morning after the Kapos woke you up very early,\nand two, three SS standing there and counting us. Every morning we were counted. Why we\nwere counted I cannot tell you, but it had to be precise and if the numbers didn't come out,\nyou had to be counted again. If it took one hour, if it took five hours, they didn't care. You\nhad to be counted. Whether it was cold, whether it was raining, whether it was sunshine \u2014\nyou had to be counted and during the same time that we were all standing out there, they\nwould run horse-drawn carriage where they threw the bodies of those people who were\neither shot or hanged or had died from hunger, from whatever, and they wanted to make sure\nthat we see each morning these horse-drawn carriages drive by. And I remember one time I\nlooked out and I saw on the fence two bodies hanging on the fence. These people were hung\n> roll call grounds (German)\nthere during the night. Just \u2014 they wanted \u2014 and shot \u2014 I mean they were no longer living, but\nthey let them hang there so that we could see 1t \u2014 what would happen to us if we maybe not\nobey. From the regular work you could be sometimes selected to do some special work like\nmaybe cleaning the pit toilets or, or doing something around outside the camp. Like one time\nI remember I was picked out to go with one of the SS and a couple of other prisoners to the\nnearest village of the camp. We had to pick up something and we had to load it on this\nwagon, on this big wagon. There was no extra food. There was no, not even a sip of water\nthat we would get but we were asked to stand by as the SS was feeding the horse the sugars\nout of his hand and we could watch it. That was a treat for us. But it was very hard. It was\nvery hard because you were always so hungry and there was, there was nothing. I mean that\nwas one of the terrible things that not only were you mistreated but you also were so hungry\nall the time. And I didn't know because I didn't have a mirror, I didn't know how I looked.\nBut my father always told me towards the end of the war, towards the end of Bergen-Belsen,\nhe said I was very puffed up, that I had hunger, I had hunger-edema. You know, you've seen\nthese little children from Asia who were blown up. Well, I wasn't so little anymore but I was\n\u2014 had this and it, it was really very bad. If you were sick during that time, 1t was very bad\nbecause not like in, in Westerbork where there was still the possibility of being in a barrack\nspecially you, you, you still were treated a little bit more humanely. But if you really got sick\nin Bergen-Belsen, that was a very bad thing.",
        "Q: What would happen?",
        "A: You were just left there. I mean it \u2014 there was there was no medication to speak of. There\nwas nothing. The, the Jewish doctors had no means of really helping you. I don't think there\nwas an aspirin in that camp. I don't think there was a bandage in that camp. I don't, I don't\nremember any of this stuff. Tough luck. I mean it was not possible. I believe it must have\nbeen towards the end of \u2014 either the very end of December of 1944 or in the first week of\n1945, Fraulein Doctor Slottke, Fraulein Doctor Slottke \u2014 Miss, Miss Doctor Slottke from\nthe Central Security Office in Berlin arrived in the camp. And she called to her all those\npeople who had passports either some foreign passports. Now our family had received\nthrough the auspices, and a wonderful deed, of an uncle \u2014 who was really a cousin \u2014 Max\nWeil. He lived in Switzerland. He was not Swiss. He was also German refugee, German\nJewish refugee. He had bought passports from us from the Paraguayan Consul in Bern.\nThese passports stated that we were Paraguayan citizens, parenthetically. After the war, it\nwas found out that this man had done this on his own, trying to help people but at the same\ntime I believe he pocketed all the money for himself, of paying these passports. But really I\ndon't care, because these passports helped our \u2014 us. And I assume this man wanted to help.\nThese passports interestingly enough reached us during the German occupation already, so\nwe were able to receive it already although it was occupied and there was a censorship and\nall that. But we appeared in front of this Fraulein Doctor Slottke and she told us that they \u2014\n\u00b0 young woman (German)\nthat she wanted to exchange us Paraguayans and many others who held other passports for\nGermans who were living outside Germany, who were not able to return, who were caught\nin the war. Who were living outside Germany, and who could not get back to Germany\nunless there was an arrangement that they would release so many Jewish prisoners for\nGermans. She said that they, we couldn't help it that we were in the state we were and that\nshe.... Excuse me. Can I just drink? That she, that she would arrange that we would leave by\ntrain and go outside Germany.\nShe told us that the next morning we would have to go through a thorough cleansing job. By\nthe way, we were many times taken to this \"cleansing bath,\" so to speak \u2014 I want to back \u2014\ntrack a minute on that, and taken there because we were full of lice all the time. But we had\nto take off our clothes. They were put into a big machine or something like that, in a\ncontainer and which supposedly was heated up so that 1t should kill these lice but they never\nwere killed. They were only worse every time that when you got your clothes back. And\nmeantime you went \u2014 had to go to a shower bath and the SS \u2014 male and female \u2014 were, we\nwere totally naked. We were standing around. They was standing there talking to one\nanother, laughing their head off that we were all standing there in \u2014 with nothing on\nhelplessly. And then they sent us out. I remember one time standing in the snow with the\nshoes on, no clothes whatsoever. The snow was on the ground. It was freezing cold; and we\nhad to wait for those de-liced, so-called de-liced clothing, which always came back with the\nlice crawling more on it because they never heated it up enough; and they said they had to\nre-do it because the lice weren't killed. So we were standing for a couple of hours before we\ngot our clothes back. Now we had this experience, and we thought, \u201cOh no, we'll get again\nthe same story,\u201d which we really did. But at the same time they also wanted us to throw\naway all the \u2014 whatever we had which could be used against the Germans as a document.\nFor some reason I have few little documents left. They must have been in some seams or\nhidden away or in a pocket they didn't see because when I remember \u2014 when I entered this,\nthis hall where, where the people were processed, it was littered with paper. It was littered\nwith clothing, with lice crawling over it and we were supposed to keep only what was on our\nbodies and as we went off we left the camp after this whole procedure and we thought, \u201c\u201cWas\nshe telling the truth?\u201d We didn't know whether we could trust her or not and as we walked\nagain through the little birch forest and we came out and we saw\u2014it was a cold month\u2014we\nsaw the steam coming up, this, this smoke rising into the sky and sure enough.... We could\nnot believe it. We could not believe that there was really a little train standing, which was\napparently. We got into the train, and every compartment was heated. We were living in cold\nbarracks for so long we didn't even know what a nice comfortable warm room felt like. I\nmean, in this case, the, the train. Well, we came into the train and we could not believe it\neither, because they came around and gave us something to eat.\nAnd said that we would go towards the Swiss border, that from there on we would be\nexchanged against the German prisoners \u2014 not prisoners. I mean, the German people who\nwere outside Germany. And they wished us, so to speak, a good trip. Well, we were started\nto roll and roll and we came across areas where just before we had arrived there was a\nbombardment. Because already during that time the Germans \u2014 the Allies had advanced into\nGermany and there were also occasionally bombardments of various areas which was\nstrategically important to the Allies. And we were held back at various stations because the\ntrain rails had to be repaired and so forth. And we, we made a terrible detour, I remember,\nbecause suddenly we saw that we were in Berlin and we couldn't understand it. \u201cIf we go\ndirectly to the Swiss border how come we are going through Berlin?\u201d And we got very\nanxious and suspicious again. But, indeed, we, we came through southern Germany and we\nwere heading towards the Swiss border. Well, as you can imagine, people who had lived\nthrough that were not \u2014 their health was not the best. And there was one person in particular,\nI remember we stopped at a certain station, and his body \u2014 he had died during the train ride\nand his body was taken off the train and probably taken to the morgue of the village where\nwe had stopped. As we approached the Dutch \u2014 the Swiss border, the SS stopped the train at\na certain point and called people who were responsible from the group. They assigned\ncertain people \u2014 one of them was my dad \u2014 they called them out and told them that they had\nto tell us that only a small number of the people on the train were going really to\nSwitzerland. That we were in such a bad condition that we \u2014 they did not want us \u2014 to send\nus across the border. I guess they had a little feeling of shame left or whatever. We ended up\nin a \u2014 in the barracks, military barracks actually, and made one military person responsible\nfor us. It was \u2014 we were assigned actually there for a couple of nights. Quite nice rooms. And\nwe \u2014 they gave us something to eat. It wasn't very much, but we, we didn't have to starve\nduring that time. Wasn't too much \u2014 it was good. It wasn't too much, because our body and\nstomach didn't tolerate any more food really. But what we were not quite sure of \u2014 what were\nthey going to do with us? Where were we going? We knew that the war was towards an end,\nbut we did not know \u2014 until the day we left we were not informed that they had negotiated\nwith Berlin to send us back to Bergen-Belsen. Because the reason Berlin didn't say, \"Yes,\nsend them,\" they couldn't do it right away because the railroad tracks were even further\ndamaged and the communication \u2014 lines of communication were severed. So that it would\nhave been an eternal ride on the train, probably escaping from here to there. Instead, they\ndecided they would put us into an internment camp for the time being. And so we, we ended\nup in an internment camp; and in that internment camp were people from the islands of\nGuernsey and Jersey from England. Germans had occupied Guernsey and Jersey, and had\ninterned most of its citizens in, in various camps. One of them was that camp where we\nwere. During that time when we were in the camp it was very close to the end of the war.\nWas more illness, more \u2014 there was more help available for us because people had supplies\nfrom the British Red Cross. They were trying to de-louse us, cut off the hair because we\nwere just full with lice. They gave us some food. They had to share \u2014 could share with us.\nWe were getting a little more fed and a little oriented where we were, what happened to us;\nand on April the 23rd, 1945, the French Army liberated us.",
        "Q: What was that like?",
        "A: What was that like? It was unbelievable. We couldn't believe that this.... We had hoped\nalways that the war would end and that this would happen. But when it happened, it was so,\nso unbelievable that we should suddenly have our freedom again. Although we were in\nGermany and we didn't like that idea. But we were free. Free. And there were many \u2014 quite a\nnumber of weeks went by when we had to leave that camp and then we were, had to go to an\nUNRRA camp.",
        "Q: Let's stop here. We have to put another tape on. This is a good place to break.\nEnd of tape 1\nTAPE #2",
        "A: \u2014I remember my cousin, my cousin, my aunt, my uncle and a little \u2014 my, my little cousin. I\nmean, say little cousin \u2014 my cousin was only three years old, one of them, when we were in\nthe camp. They \u2014 the boy lived with my uncle and the girl lived with my aunt, in the same\nbunk. I feel \u2014 when I look back I feel that communication and relations between the\nindividual people were really very rough. There was because maybe of the hunger \u2014 I, I don't\nknow. I always look back and I have always these horrible pictures in front of me. People\nstealing one another \u2014 off one another the bread. It could mean life or death if you had\nenough to eat. But this didn't count. People were uninhibitedly stealing. I remember for\ninstance there was only one toilet, and in the morning you had to stand in line, twenty,\ntwenty-five deep or something, to go to this one toilet. And people were screaming and\nyelling at one another and telling them, \u201cYou can't stay in any longer and I pull you out.\u201d It\nwas terrible. It was because of their own terrible needs I guess that they became like animals\nsometimes. I, unfortunately I don't remember that it brought out the best in anybody. I don't\nremember that. I wish I would, but I don't. I remember, for instance, other things that people\nbecause of the hunger, because of this, for some reason they were standing together and\nexchanging recipes. There were imaginary cooking sessions. There were dreams about \u2014 I\nremember with Hannelore, we were talking about if we're ever liberated, what would we do\nin terms of \u2014 we would buy a loaf of bread, buy coffee, jam and butter and prepare all of this,\nlock the door in a room, and do nothing but eating this bread, butter, jam and jelly, and, and\ncoffee. This was our dream. We repeated it. This was our hope. We had the strangest\nexperiences in these camps. For instance, there \u2014 one of the guards, she was called \u201cThe\nBlonde,\u201d she would come through the barracks and there was one woman who had a baby \u2014\nwho, of course, died, because a baby cannot survive at all under those circumstances. But she\nwould have it the weakness, sort of, and told the woman that she also has a baby, and she\nwould try and get her some food for the baby. And she visited her until the baby died, really\nnearly every day. Turning her around, she would come through the barracks every second\nday or so; and you had to have your bunk made up in such a perfect manner, totally straight.\nThere was not allowed that there was one little fold somewhere, one little wrinkle or\nanything. She would pull it away and she would make sure that your rations were cut out if,\nif she ever would find that this was not perfect. She also didn't mind to use her little whip on\npeople. And here she was that she was so concerned about the baby because she identified\nwith this woman and, and her own child \u2014 strangest occurrences.",
        "Q: What personally enabled you to get through?",
        "A: Well, I, I think a couple of things that \u2014 hope that you had sort of the \u2014 way down something\ntold you maybe, maybe we, we, we have to get out of this. We can't survive \u2014 we, we have to\nsurvive I mean, somehow. That this something was telling you, you have to and hope that\nyou will, and maybe that you were young and confident somehow that luck will be on your\nside.",
        "Q: Shall we backtrack from liberation. Apparently luck was on your side and you were\nliberated.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Pick up there again.",
        "A: When, when we were in UNRRA camp, it was \u2014 it, it should have been a new beginning. It\nwas a new planning. It was a new thinking. \u201cWhere do we go from here? What are our, our\npossibilities to go from where?\u201d We could not go back to Germany. We did not want to go\nback to Germany. To go to Holland? Yes, we wanted to go to Holland; but we also knew\nthat we had wanted to leave Holland at one time. So we had to, to make a plan to use\nHolland only as a temporary place of, of, of sojourn, that we had to hopefully get to America\nor to Israel. Israel was not possible for us at the time. So America was more, more likely for\nus at that time. It was a matter of time, everything, but we had already so much times waited\nand spent and suffered. We, we wanted already to arrive somewhere.\nThere was a possibility for me to go much earlier than my father, because I was born in\nGermany. And the German quota to come to the United States was much smaller because the\nAmericans rightfully did not want the Germans to at that time to come to America. They had\nto be de-Nazified, or they wanted to make sure who it was so the only German-born people\nwere essentially a few exception scientists and so forth. And the German-born Jews, because\nthat quota was more open. My father, who was born in France, Strasbourg, had to wait much\nlonger than I did. So I went back to Holland. I was able to get to go back to Holland in 194\u2014\nend of 1947. This was nearly three years after the war. Oh, longer \u2014 more than three years\nafter the war. And after a few months in Holland, I finally was able to get a visa to come to\nthe United States. And the nice part of this was that when we had left \u2014 when we tried to\nleave Holland in 1940, we were going to go with the Holland-America line to America. And\nwe had booked the tickets. And the man who was in charge of the office in Rotterdam, for\nsome reason because of my father's work he knew my dad. And when I came to Holland,\nafter I had gotten my visa in Rotterdam, I said, \"Well, let me see. I go by the Holland-\nAmerica line.\" I had no money, really, to come to America, to go on the boat; but I went\nthere, and I said, \"Let me try.\" I said \u2014 I go in there and I said \u2014 I told my story, that I had left\n\u2014 was supposed to leave that time, that I never used the ticket and 1s it possible to use it now.\nAnd so the clerk to whom I spoke said, \"Just a minute.\" And he went into the office of the\nhead of this office, the director; and the director was there. And he came out personally, and\nhe called me into his office. And he, he, he was absolutely fantastic. But he was so nice and\nso stunned about the whole story I had to tell him. He said, \"There's no question that we will\nhonor your ticket.\" And not only did he send me to America on that boat with the ticket we\nhad paid so many years before, he put me into first class. And so I came to America on the\nfirst class, on the, on the Dutch liner. And he also honored, of course, my father's ticket. And\nthis was a few years later. So when he came to the United States, he also came with the same\nboat; and this was really a wonderful gesture of this man.",
        "Q: What happened to the other members of your family?",
        "A: Well, that story is \u2014 my close \u2014 those members who were really caught in, in this terrible\nstorm were my grandparents from my mother's side. My grandparents never left Germany.\nThey never were able to, to get out or to escape it, and we know from letters we have gotten\nand from facts that my grandparents were deported to Lodz ghetto in Poland in 1942. And\nwe also know that my grandfather died in Lodz, because my grandmother wrote it to her\nsister in Amsterdam. And since we lived in Amsterdam I, you know, I was able to, to get that\nmessage from, from this aunt. And what we later found out, my, my \u2014 the brother of my\nmother, uncle I have and we went back to Frankfurt and we went to this house where my\ngrandparents lived \u2018til the end, before they were deported. We know \u2014 from, from the\nengineer who lived in this house \u2014 they said that my grandparents were picked up and that\nday and put on one of those wagons, thrown on these wagons. My grandfather was over\neighty at that time, and he \u2014 his health wasn't very good. He never lived very long in the\nghetto, in Lodz; and my poor grandmother survived the ghetto, but then was sent to\nAuschwitz and of course never came back from Auschwitz. And my father's family, my\ngrandmother and grandfather were dead at that time. They died before Hitler even. My father\nhad some cousins in Berlin who did not survive the war in Germany and our family is rather\nsmall. My cousins in Holland and, and their parents, my father's brother and his sister-in-law\nand their two children, survived the war in a similar fashion than we did. Except after the\nwar, when they were liberated, they could go back to Holland much earlier than we could\nbecause they were originally Dutch citizens.",
        "Q: But you went on to America?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: And what was it like there?",
        "A: Oh, in the beginning it was very strange. It was very difficult for me. It \u2014 because I, I was\nshocked, because I arrived and maybe an hour later people started to ask me, \u201cHow do you\nlike America?\u201d I didn't know how I liked America. How can I know how I liked America? I\nmean, I was overwhelmed, with everything and I had to go out and find a room, a job, had \u2014\nit was a cultural shock for me. It took me quite a while till I got adjusted. I was very\ndepressed in the beginning when I came to America\u2014",
        "Q: What city did you come to?",
        "A: To New York. I only really started to feel good when I went to Charlottesville, Virginia,\nwhere we had some wonderful cousins. And I went to school; and slowly \u2014 and I also found\nsome friends there. One was actually another survivor, but I slowly got absorbed into \u2014\nlearned about American society and about family life and all the good things which I did not\nreally experience so much in New York. I don't think it's a good \u2014 it was the best place to\ncome to being.... If I had been received in a family or if I had \u2014 it, it wasn't so \u2014 I had to\nstruggle by myself mos\u2014 mainly. I had one nice experience, you know, I lived in \u2014 and a very\nstrange experience \u2014 I lived in a in a room which I rented from also a refugee family and I\ngot quite friendly with one of the girls. And years later, I think forty years later or something.\nI'm here in Washington and I belong to, to an independent congregation. And one night \u2014 it's\na community actually \u2014 and one night over coffee different people tell one another their story\nand talk to one another. And I find out that the woman I'm talking to is the daughter of that\nfamily where I, where I had a room when I first came to America. She's one of my very good\nfriends. Then after Charlottesville, I came to Washington; and I was a member of the\ninternational student house, where I met my husband and life started to get good.",
        "Q: And do you have any children?",
        "A: I have two children \u2014 two boys, Michael and David. And they are both married, have both\nwonderful families; and I have two grandchildren now.",
        "Q: And what about your father? He came over, I presume, afterwards?",
        "A: Yes, and he lived in New York. He worked for a Jewish self-help organization for many,\nmany years. He remarried once more, and he died three and a half years ago. He was nearly\nninety years old, and he was widowed just two years before he died. And during the last two\nyears of his life, he, he went \u2014 he traveled enormously and he was able to enjoy really\neverything more than he ever had before then, until the last six months of his life when he\ngot very ill.",

        "Q: You don't remember what you don't remember. And two, in general \u2014 can you formulate in\ngeneral how your experiences in the war affected you?",
        "A: Oh, I'm sure they affected me a lot. I would say they certainly affected my self-confidence\nfor years. They certainly affected my own self-value for years. I'm sure they affected me in\nrelationships and trust in other people for years. I'm sure they still affect me in terms of if I\nsee police or uniforms or \u2014 still do. I think truly that if I have regained any of these it was\nreally due to my husband, who has helped me a great deal in overcoming some of these\nfears, the self-value, and all of that.",

        "A: OK. Sure. I had a rather normal childhood. I grew up in a middle-class family and my\npaternal grandparents lived very close to us and so did my maternal grandparents. And I\nwent \u2014 started to go to school. It was a public school. Jewish children went there, like any\nother children of the neighborhood and in 1933 it was the time that Hitler came to power.\nThings started to change radically. Nearly overnight, when we came back to school we were\nsegregated in a sense that suddenly all the children knew who are the Jews and who are not\nthe Jews, because we were received with words of \u201cdirty Jew.\u201d They started to throw rocks\nat us. We had to \u2014 every child had to learn to sing the Nazi hymn and \u2014 but soon thereafter\nwe were forbidden \u2014 the Jewish children were forbidden to sing the Nazi hymn, so we were\nsegregated and we felt it all the way from every morning that we came to school. It was\ntowards the end of the elementary school years that my parents took me out of the school and\nentered me in a special Jewish school with many other children who left the public schools.\nAnd I passed a few years in the special Jewish school, then went on to the higher Jewish\nhigh school and stayed there until 1938, and in 1938 the pogroms against the Jews of\nGermany started.",
        "A: Sure. The pogroms were only an excuse of what had happened. A young Jew in Paris was\nvery aggravated because his parents had been sent to Poland and he took revenge by\nshooting a German diplomat. And, as you might know, in November the 9th, 1938, the\nfamous Kristallnacht' broke out and it was because as a revenge, as a retaliation against the\nJews, because this man had murdered a German diplomat. But what I know was that Jewish\nstores were attacked. They were raided. The synagogues were burning. They were raided.\nCrystal Night (German); Night of Broken Glass.\nPeople stole, demolished and in general most Jewish males were picked up and sent to a\nconcentration camp. The duration during that time in the concentration camp was relatively\nshort from what happen \u2014 will happen later on. After approximately two weeks most people\nwere sent back to their homes. Now this was in '38. Already between '33 and '38 a lot of\nJews had lost their civil rights. As for instance my father, who was a lawyer, he was already\ndebarred. He could no longer go to the courts and he \u2014 doctors had lost their privileges in\nhospitals. Actors could no longer act on the, on the public stages, and so forth and so on.\nAlso in 1935 with the Nuremberg laws, a lot of discrimination against Jews occurred. There\nwas no longer inter-marriage possible. There was no longer relationship with non-Jews\npossible. You couldn't even visit a Christian home. You no longer could have a maid. If you\nhad one who was \u2014 had to be over 45 years of age, because I think the Germans were\nhorrified at the thought that their German race could be possibly defamed by some act.\nAnyway also just before that time, during all these years between '33 and '38, I recall for\ninstance that a friend of mine who always played with me, who we always together \u2014 one\nday she came and said, \"I can no longer come to your home.\" And I said, \"How come?\" And\nshe said, \"Well, my father told me I'm no longer allowed to play with you because you're\nJewish.\" So this friend disappeared and I never saw her again. Other friends, Jewish friends,\nJewish children who lived in my neighborhood, left from one day to the next because they\nimmigrated maybe with their parents or they went across the border to another country.\nWhatever, it was a terrible time of real turmoil and repression, and in 1938 after the\nKristallnacht, my family in Holland tried to get me to Holland with a children's transport.\nMy father \u2014 my parents were divorced at that time already and my\nfather was traveling in Europe and in Israel and trying to see how they could establish a new\nplace where we could live. When he came back from Palestine in 19\u2014 I believe it was 1932,\nhe proposed to the family that we should leave immediately but my mother did not want to\nand she refused to go. So when he went later to the different countries to see where he could\nget a permit to stay, it became already very, very difficult because each country only let in so\nmany so-called \u201cforeigners.\u201d In 1938 at that time he had a permit to stay for six months in\nHolland, and when I did not come with the children's transport because my papers were lost,\nhe and my uncle went to the Dutch authorities. My uncle was a very energetic man who\nreally pulled his weight \u2014 went into a meeting and said he has to have papers to get me out of\nthe country and into Holland, and he did get a permit. And he called us at night and my\nmother took me to the German border and we \u2014 my uncle's chauffeur was coming across the\nborder and picked me up and withered me through the German and the Dutch border guards\nand helped me cross the border and so I came to Holland. Now in 1938 life was pretty\nnormal in Holland. But we were, of course, strangers and first stayed with my family in\nTilburg, and later on I came to live in Amsterdam. But, but because of the work of my father\n\u2014 he was very rarely there and we lived in a boarding house and I \u2014 there was really no good\nhome life to speak of. And we always played with the idea that we had to leave Holland\nbecause there was really no good future for us.\nMy father worked at that time with the Dutch authorities who dealt \u2014 Dutch Jewish\nauthorities, who dealt with resettling refugees, Jewish refugees. He also played a role at that\ntime in as a Dutch delegate to the ship St. Louis, who was not allowed to land in Cuba. And\nhe went to, at that time, to Belgium to help rescue the people and settle in so many only.\nEach country tried to take a number of people. And Holland took some. And so he was\ninvolved with this work, so he was really very rarely there. And towards 1940 we were able\nto get a permit to get to America and in May 9th, 1940 we took the few belongings we had\nbrought out of Germany, we took those and took them to the boat in, in Rotterdam, and we\nwere supposed to sail with the Veendam the next morning, May the 10th, 1940. May, May\n10th, 1940 came. I woke up in the morning and I hear these funny little sounds and I look out\nand I see puffy little clouds in the sky and all the Dutch houses, apartment houses, have very\nflat roofs and I see people on the roof, and I wonder what's going on. Anyway I went up on\nthe roof and I see and I was told that German planes were flying overhead and they had\ninvaded Holland during the night. And I woke up my dad and I said, \u201cI don't think we'll be\ngoing to America.\u201d Well, that was it, we didn't go. And 19\u2014 May 10th, this happened, and\nfive days later the Germans capitulated \u2014 I mean the Dutch capitulated and the Germans\noccupied Holland. And pretty soon the German occupation started of Holland and of course\nwith the occupation, all the repressions against the Jews started, started out. I cannot\nremember exactly how it started out but what happened was that you no longer could pursue\nyour work in, in non-Jewish businesses. Slowly things were taken away from you. Your civil\nrights were taken slowly away. It was really a repeat of what happ\u2014 had happened in\nGermany. You had to wear a yellow star. Pretty soon you could no longer shop in the stores.\nThere were certain hours only between three and five in the afternoon. You could no longer\ngo out as much as you wanted at night because you had to be in. There was a curfew. You\ncouldn't even sit \u2014 if you had a garden, you couldn't even sit outside in your garden after the\ncurfew hours, so\u2014.",
        "A: Well, it wasn't very easy to grow up as a young person like that. It, it was a very bad\nexistence and the trouble was that each day something new happened and something more\nrepressive happened. And the thoughts were always in the mind, \u201cHow can we escape from\nthis and how \u2014 what can we do?\u201d The only possibility would have been to go underground.\nBut that was very difficult and it was very dangerous because you had to have the right\nconnection to people who would hide you underground. You had to have the right\naccommodations for underground, because you couldn't live freely because we all had an\naccent. So, people who had an accent were immediately prone to be discovered, even with a\nfalse passport or false ID paper or whatever it is. So for a long time we were thinking how\nwe could do that, how we could possibly find a refuge this way. There were people hidden\non the attic. There were people hidden in cellars. There were people hidden in back rooms\nfor years and years by Dutch peasants, by Dutch peo-people of good will and good heart.\nThere were also people who were betrayed, but we really never reached that stage because it\nwas not possible.",
        "A: I had a few friends. I did not have very many friends. I \u2014 most of my friends were refugees\nthemselves. I did go to a school for refugees, a special school because of the language\nproblems but we did get some instructions and I finished high school in Holland. And my\nfather worked at that time, as I had mentioned before, for a Dutch \u2014 for a Jewish refugee\norganization which later on turned partially into the Jewish Council and I later myself had a\nsmall job in the sewing division, making clothes for people, for German people really as far\nas I know. We never knew exactly for whom we were working and so I had a \u2014 also want to\nmention that during that during all this period I mentioned before, I believe it was in 1942,\nthat we all had to wear a yellow star. This yellow star had to be on the left side of your\nclothing. If you wore three layers that day it had to be on three layers of your clothing. It had\nto be attached. There was \u2014 you were not allowed to be able to put one finger through the\nbehind between your clothing and the star. It had to be sewn on properly, and if somebody\nsaw you on the street, you had to have ID papers, the proper ID papers with a \u201cJ\u201d in it and\nyour yellow star and if something was wrong, you were arrested. And you didn't come back\nor maybe you were arrested and were sent on somewhere right away.\nWell, also during that time, as I had mentioned to you before, during the night many times\nthe, the SS or the police \u2014 not the Dutch police but the German patrol, police or whatever\ntheir designation was \u2014 came to various homes, looked for Jews, wanted to see their ID\npapers, wanted to see whether they had special permits to stay away from being sent for\nrelocation in the east, and these special stamps were sometimes that you had a \u2014 you did\nquote, unquote, \"a very important work\" or that you had the possibility of getting a visa to\nget out of Holland via Portugal or that maybe you had instead of four Jewish grandparents\nyou had only three Jewish grandparents. There were a variety of little stamps, which were\npossible in your ID card which would delay your transport, but it didn't prevent it. So we\nwere \u2014 I personally was arrested at least three times during the night, taken to a special place\nwhich usually was the place which at one time was a Jewish theater. And you never really\nknew whether you would be released again, what would happen to you the next day. We\nwere sitting around, we were wondering and worrying what would happen, but on July the\n6th in 1943 was the biggest razzia, repression against the Jews. They, they \u2014 big cars with SS\nwere driving through the different streets with the bullhorns on top of the cars and they were\ncalling all the Jews to leave their buildings. Now for weeks and weeks and months and\n* Schutzstaffeln [Protection Squads] (German)\nmonths we knew that this day will come one day and we always had prepared ourselves in a\nsense by having a backpack ready with a few belongings to take with us. We knew that we\nwere not allowed to take many things, but they would allow us one change, one sweater, a\ntoothbrush, a pair of extra shoes, an overall and maybe a coat.",
        "A: It was known through the Jewish community. It was made known from the Germans to the\nJewish community that this is what is allowed. There is not allowed anymore. So you knew\nthat your day will come and you didn't know when and you knew that this is if you ever have\nto go away, this is what you can take with you. That day when we were all called out of the\nhouses, we \u2014 they marched us from wherever you lived to the central point. It could be\naround the corner. It could be a half an hour away, whatever it was, we were gathered all\naround. We are standing in the courtyard of the building for a whole day. We did not know\nwhat was going to happen to us. They didn't give us any food, no water, anything. Well,\ntowards late afternoon one of the highest SS was coming to the building, and he was doing\nthe selecting of who would be sent away and who would not be sent away. And one by one\nwe were called up to appear before him to show him our papers and he would decide. When\nmy father's turn came, he said to him, \u201cMr. Moser, you have to decide whether you and your\ndaughter will go on transport or whether you will stay behind.\u201d\u2019 He would not dispense both\nof us from transport but he would \u2014 considered my father to stay behind, so my dad decided\nthat he would stay behind, hoping that, you know, he could do something for me, he would\nbe able to get me out of this again. And we were \u2014 those who had to leave right away were\nreassembled and marching in fours down the street and I looked back and I saw my dad\nlooking out the window as, as we were leaving that street and that building. We were\nmarched towards the stadium where a big mass of people were already coming from the\nvarious neighborhoods in Amsterdam, reassembled in that stadium. And in that stadium\nwere rows of tables with Germans sitting who were registering us by name, by ID, taking\neverything we had like watches, rings, whatever we had of any little value \u2014 took it away\nfrom us.\nBut they left us with that rucksack. They went through it, too, mind you. They looked\nthrough what was in it. So, then in Amsterdam at that time the trams were running but there\nwas \u2014 that morning there was absolutely nobody on the street. They put us into the trams and\nthe trams started to roll and we did not know \u2014 we knew that we are going on transport. We\nknew that we were going to go to the camp in Holland which called Westerbork, but we did\nnot know by what means we were going. They took us with the trams and these tramways\nwere accompanied on each side by huge limousines in which all filled with SS just so that\nnobody could leave the tram, nobody could escape. They were running over the pavement,\nover the sidewalks of the street and if there were any people they had to flee up into their\napartments and houses and, and roadways \u2014 I mean entrances so that they wouldn't be just\ncrushed on by, by these SS people. But we came to a small railroad station in Amsterdam\nwhere the cattle trains were already waiting for us. Germans were standing around with big \u2014\nwhat do you call it? Big dogs, shepherd dogs, and pacing, pacing up and down the quays,\nloading the people into the cattle cars and I sort of twaddled around, I was trying to hide first\nbetween some lamp posts, a little house and so forth, and I was seeing whether it's possible\nfor me to escape from this, but I really wouldn't \u2014 didn't know because even if I were able to\nleave that railroad station, where was I going to go since I didn't know before where. But it\nwas just sort of an instinct, \u201cMaybe they can't catch me.\u201d Well they did and of course I was\none of them in the cattle trucks and we went. They closed the doors and we still were in a\nfairly cooperative spirit, you know. We try to sort of console our \u2014 one another and late at\nnight we arrived in the camp. We couldn't even really see the camp \u2014",
        "A: That, that trip, contrary to the trip in the cattle truck to Bergen-Belsen, that trip \u2014 I remember\nthere were a lot of young people. I didn't know anybody. But I know there were a lot of\nyoung people in that particular compartment I was in. The ride was maybe three hours.\nContrary to the other trip I took \u2014 for days in a cattle truck \u2014 there was a much better mood\nthan there was later on. You had lived so long with the knowledge that you would be picked\nup one day, that you would be sent away one day, that you would go to Westerbork one day,\nthat now it happened. It was done. You were on the way. I mean it was nearly like no longer\n\u2014 you didn't have to expect it any longer. It was there, which 1s really a terrible thing, but, but\nit was nearly like a relief because they couldn't \u2014 they picked you up, but you knew this was\nit, it couldn't happen over and over again. So when we arrived finally at night in the camp, it\nwas already dark. We, we didn't know exactly how that camp would look. We knew it\nsmelled when we arrived there. It, 1t wasn't a very pleasant smell. And we were given \u2014 we\nhad to go through another registration, mind you. That was the second one that day, but that\nwas more that like a receipt, \u201cYes, these people have arriven,\u201d you know. And we were,\nwere told to go to various barracks. We came there. There was no light in front of it. There\nwas only this terrible stench, and you entered the barrack and you barely saw anything. You,\nyou saw a lot of things that you knew something \u2014 there was a lot of stuff toward the ceiling\nbut you didn't really quite realize what it was. Your eyes had to adjust for a long time, and\nyou wanted to find \u2014 what do you call 1t? Can you cut it a minute?",
        "A: A cot. Yes, a cot. So we \u2014 I found something on the third level and I climbed up there with\nmy backpack and I came to lay next to a woman. I didn't know her. She didn't know me. But\nI remember we talked long into the night of how we got there and what our experiences were\nand so forth and so on. And the next days in the camp we were put to work, real silly work.\nWe had to carry sand from one place to the other. It didn't make sense, but we had to do it,\nand as time went by they organized us into a variety of tasks, what we had to do. Well, I was\nreally delegated to a place where we were sewing clothing, again sewing clothing, for \u2014 I'm\nnot quite sure for whom it was. That was the whole day. Sometimes we would \u2014 I worked at\na Dutch, but this was a Nazi, a Dutch Nazi farmer's farm. He had us clean out the pig sties.\nHe had us work around his farm, clean up certain things. He had us work in the potato fields,\nor whatever, so that he didn't have so much \u2014 we were slaves to him. He profited from, from\nthe camp being so nearby and from being a Nazi and collaborating with the Germans. And as\na reward he would sit us with the chickens in the yard and give us a watery soup. That was\nthe meal for the day. And we had to wear the Dutch klompen,\u00b0 you know, the Dutch wooden\nshoes and if you're not used to it and you have no socks and you have nothing proper to\nprotect you, these things are very hard and you had blisters every day. And every morning\nbefore you went to work there was somebody who took a needle and punched those blisters.\nIt was not very good. Anyway, this time passed too and a lot of illnesses broke out already in\nthis camp and I remember that I got jaundice and I was very sick.\nI mean I was so nauseated and so ill. And I didn't say that before, but every Tuesday night \u2014\nevery Tuesday the lists of those people who were going to be sent to Auschwitz \u2014 we\nassumed it was Auschwitz, we didn't know one hundred percent, but the trains came back\nfrom Auschwitz. Usually the conductor or somebody would let on where they came from, to\npick up more people and to send them off to away and towards the east. Well lists were\nassembled during the day on Monday and on Tuesday they were read off in the barracks. A\nKapo* came to the barracks and was reading off the names of those who were sent away.\nAnd as you can imagine this was some horrible, horrible times. People finding out that this\nwas really probably the end or they \u2014 we didn't know hundred percent what was going on in\nAuschwitz. We, we knew it was terrible but we didn't know exactly how terrible it was. And\neverybody would help always those who had to leave the camp. They would help them to\nassemble their stuff, to console them, to give them whatever they had, a little food left to\ngive them on the way. And it was maybe four months after that I was in this camp \u2014 the\ntrains from the razzias, from the raids on the Jews from Amsterdam and other locations in\nHolland, these trains came all the way into the camp compound. So each afternoon we\nalways heard by \u2014 there was always an underground kind of a communication. I don't know\nhow one found out. There were people who had special permits, maybe, who went in and out\nof the camp. One got little messages. This day one got the message that a big raid on\nAmsterdam had picked up the rest of the Jews, or nearly the rest of the Jews who still were\nin Amsterdam and we went to meet the train. You could \u2014 were able to do that, to go the\nquays and sure enough my father and his wife were on the train.\n* Clogs (Danish)\n* Forman (colloquial German); term used for inmates appointed by the SS to head a labor\ncommando of prisoners.\nAnd of course it was the same story for him, you know. He was integrated into doing some\nkind of labor in the camp, but end of the year 1944 \u2014 I think it was early September \u2014 we\nwere all sent to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany. And we packed up our\nbelongings. We went out to the train. There were the SS with the dogs. There was no\nescaping. There was no hiding. You \u2014 there was no means. If somebody didn't step into the\ntrain, people were shot. That was the end. So we left. We came to another ride but that was at\nleast two days if not longer in the cattle truck. And compared with the first ride and\nexperience in the cattle truck going from Amsterdam to Westerbork, this was a much sadder\nstory because we knew nothing good was expecting us, even worse than the camp in\nHolland, and that camp had a \u2014 I'm sorry, that cattle truck had some benches in there. It, it\nwas just a wooden plank. It was filled with people. You couldn't lie on the floor. You could\nstand up. You could maybe if you were lucky you got in between, you could sit on one of\nthose benches. There was a big vat and that was the toilet for everybody for two and a half\ndays. There was no food. There was no drink. There was nothing. They didn't \u2014 the doors\ndidn't open. There was a little slit in, in the cattle truck and you could look out sometimes,\nbut you didn't know where you were. I mean you only knew you were rolling, rolling,\nrolling. When we arrived in at the station closest to the camp, which was in northern\nGermany, in the Luneburger Heide, the doors finally opened and we were told to get out.\nWeakened and not very good condition already because of this days we pass in the cattle\ntruck. And I'll never forget.... First of all I personally was kicked by an SS to get out, and so\nI really fell out of the truck. But when I got up on my, my legs, I looked up and I saw this\nbridge going \u2014 a street really, a bridge, a street \u2014 going across the rails and there were\nchildren on this bridge looking down on us and yelling \u201cdirty Jews\u201d and throwing rocks.\nAnd I always remembered this because after the war I was told so many times, \u201cWell, we\ndidn't know anything about anything.\u201d And I never forget these children standing there. How\ncome they knew? How come they always \u2014 they waited for these for these railroad cars to\narrive. They knew. I know many more knew, but these children knew. Well, anyway we\nwere then led to march towards the camp, which was a long march, and I remember it was\nthrough a beautiful birch forest and I kept looking at the birches and I thought, \u201c\u201cThis 1s so\nbeautiful. How can this be? How is it possible that here we are the way, like cattle, they are\npushing us to march along?\u201d Nobody was \u2014 could stay behind. If somebody broke down,\nyou had had gotten a kick, you know. When we arrived in the camp we were assigned to\ncertain barracks and there the barracks were much narrower, much higher, many more, more\nbunks closer together and instead of one person to a bunk, we were assigned two persons to\none bunk. There was a little straw on the bunk and I ended up with Hannelore, who was my\nfather's second wife. We shared a bunk and we also shared the water, which was dripping\nfrom through the ceiling into our bunk. So we had this tiny little space to us where we had to\nput our belongings, whatever we had, plus ourselves. Two tall people in this little bunk with\nthe straw. But we shared a raincoat and so we spread that raincoat at night over us. And in\nthe morning you looked up and there was a puddle in the middle of it between the two of us.\nAnd we had to somehow get rid of the water if we didn't want to splash it just over overboard\nso to speak.\nWell, the food was minimal, to say the least. It was very bad. It was a watery soup as\nrutabagas, the smallest portion of bread which had to last for a whole week. Some people ate\nit up right away because they were so afraid that that 1t might not be there when you went to\nwork and you came back at night that somebody might have stolen it, the smallest amount.\nSo some people ate it nght away. Some people were hiding it in some ingenious way. Some\npeople couldn't make \u2014 couldn't, couldn't last for the whole week because it was really such a\nsmall portion. And the rutabagas were, were awful, too, because most of them were hard and\nif \u2014 I have seen people who did not eat the \u2014 you know, when it becomes real bad,\nsometimes dried out and gray, they took them out. And I have seen other people pick up\nthose which were taken out and chewed over by other people and take it just because of the\nhunger cause they had nothing really to eat. How one survived this I \u2014 to this day, when I\nlook back I never understand this. I, I don't understand how we could have survived, but we\ndid, with such a small amount of food. Anyway the work we had to do was another useless\nwork. We were assigned to cut out from uniforms from German soldiers which were \u2014 had\neither died on the eastern front or were shot by \u2014 I don't know by whom, but anyway and\nthey were bloody uniforms, and we had to cut off all the buttons. We had to cut off all little\npieces which were not blood-drenched and these were saved for whatever reason. The\nGermans needed the buttons. They needed the little pieces, because the war had also left\nthem with very few material goods and, and they used it to repair other uniforms, to, you\nknow, to whatever, make do. We had to work in this from morning to night.\nBut the mornings in the camp life started off that you had to go out on the Appellplatz,\u201d\nwhich means the place where everybody had to assemble. A huge place. All barracks had to\ncome there at a certain hour, early in the morning after the Kapos woke you up very early,\nand two, three SS standing there and counting us. Every morning we were counted. Why we\nwere counted I cannot tell you, but it had to be precise and if the numbers didn't come out,\nyou had to be counted again. If it took one hour, if it took five hours, they didn't care. You\nhad to be counted. Whether it was cold, whether it was raining, whether it was sunshine \u2014\nyou had to be counted and during the same time that we were all standing out there, they\nwould run horse-drawn carriage where they threw the bodies of those people who were\neither shot or hanged or had died from hunger, from whatever, and they wanted to make sure\nthat we see each morning these horse-drawn carriages drive by. And I remember one time I\nlooked out and I saw on the fence two bodies hanging on the fence. These people were hung\n> roll call grounds (German)\nthere during the night. Just \u2014 they wanted \u2014 and shot \u2014 I mean they were no longer living, but\nthey let them hang there so that we could see 1t \u2014 what would happen to us if we maybe not\nobey. From the regular work you could be sometimes selected to do some special work like\nmaybe cleaning the pit toilets or, or doing something around outside the camp. Like one time\nI remember I was picked out to go with one of the SS and a couple of other prisoners to the\nnearest village of the camp. We had to pick up something and we had to load it on this\nwagon, on this big wagon. There was no extra food. There was no, not even a sip of water\nthat we would get but we were asked to stand by as the SS was feeding the horse the sugars\nout of his hand and we could watch it. That was a treat for us. But it was very hard. It was\nvery hard because you were always so hungry and there was, there was nothing. I mean that\nwas one of the terrible things that not only were you mistreated but you also were so hungry\nall the time. And I didn't know because I didn't have a mirror, I didn't know how I looked.\nBut my father always told me towards the end of the war, towards the end of Bergen-Belsen,\nhe said I was very puffed up, that I had hunger, I had hunger-edema. You know, you've seen\nthese little children from Asia who were blown up. Well, I wasn't so little anymore but I was\n\u2014 had this and it, it was really very bad. If you were sick during that time, 1t was very bad\nbecause not like in, in Westerbork where there was still the possibility of being in a barrack\nspecially you, you, you still were treated a little bit more humanely. But if you really got sick\nin Bergen-Belsen, that was a very bad thing.",
        "A: You were just left there. I mean it \u2014 there was there was no medication to speak of. There\nwas nothing. The, the Jewish doctors had no means of really helping you. I don't think there\nwas an aspirin in that camp. I don't think there was a bandage in that camp. I don't, I don't\nremember any of this stuff. Tough luck. I mean it was not possible. I believe it must have\nbeen towards the end of \u2014 either the very end of December of 1944 or in the first week of\n1945, Fraulein Doctor Slottke, Fraulein Doctor Slottke \u2014 Miss, Miss Doctor Slottke from\nthe Central Security Office in Berlin arrived in the camp. And she called to her all those\npeople who had passports either some foreign passports. Now our family had received\nthrough the auspices, and a wonderful deed, of an uncle \u2014 who was really a cousin \u2014 Max\nWeil. He lived in Switzerland. He was not Swiss. He was also German refugee, German\nJewish refugee. He had bought passports from us from the Paraguayan Consul in Bern.\nThese passports stated that we were Paraguayan citizens, parenthetically. After the war, it\nwas found out that this man had done this on his own, trying to help people but at the same\ntime I believe he pocketed all the money for himself, of paying these passports. But really I\ndon't care, because these passports helped our \u2014 us. And I assume this man wanted to help.\nThese passports interestingly enough reached us during the German occupation already, so\nwe were able to receive it already although it was occupied and there was a censorship and\nall that. But we appeared in front of this Fraulein Doctor Slottke and she told us that they \u2014\n\u00b0 young woman (German)\nthat she wanted to exchange us Paraguayans and many others who held other passports for\nGermans who were living outside Germany, who were not able to return, who were caught\nin the war. Who were living outside Germany, and who could not get back to Germany\nunless there was an arrangement that they would release so many Jewish prisoners for\nGermans. She said that they, we couldn't help it that we were in the state we were and that\nshe.... Excuse me. Can I just drink? That she, that she would arrange that we would leave by\ntrain and go outside Germany.\nShe told us that the next morning we would have to go through a thorough cleansing job. By\nthe way, we were many times taken to this \"cleansing bath,\" so to speak \u2014 I want to back \u2014\ntrack a minute on that, and taken there because we were full of lice all the time. But we had\nto take off our clothes. They were put into a big machine or something like that, in a\ncontainer and which supposedly was heated up so that 1t should kill these lice but they never\nwere killed. They were only worse every time that when you got your clothes back. And\nmeantime you went \u2014 had to go to a shower bath and the SS \u2014 male and female \u2014 were, we\nwere totally naked. We were standing around. They was standing there talking to one\nanother, laughing their head off that we were all standing there in \u2014 with nothing on\nhelplessly. And then they sent us out. I remember one time standing in the snow with the\nshoes on, no clothes whatsoever. The snow was on the ground. It was freezing cold; and we\nhad to wait for those de-liced, so-called de-liced clothing, which always came back with the\nlice crawling more on it because they never heated it up enough; and they said they had to\nre-do it because the lice weren't killed. So we were standing for a couple of hours before we\ngot our clothes back. Now we had this experience, and we thought, \u201cOh no, we'll get again\nthe same story,\u201d which we really did. But at the same time they also wanted us to throw\naway all the \u2014 whatever we had which could be used against the Germans as a document.\nFor some reason I have few little documents left. They must have been in some seams or\nhidden away or in a pocket they didn't see because when I remember \u2014 when I entered this,\nthis hall where, where the people were processed, it was littered with paper. It was littered\nwith clothing, with lice crawling over it and we were supposed to keep only what was on our\nbodies and as we went off we left the camp after this whole procedure and we thought, \u201c\u201cWas\nshe telling the truth?\u201d We didn't know whether we could trust her or not and as we walked\nagain through the little birch forest and we came out and we saw\u2014it was a cold month\u2014we\nsaw the steam coming up, this, this smoke rising into the sky and sure enough.... We could\nnot believe it. We could not believe that there was really a little train standing, which was\napparently. We got into the train, and every compartment was heated. We were living in cold\nbarracks for so long we didn't even know what a nice comfortable warm room felt like. I\nmean, in this case, the, the train. Well, we came into the train and we could not believe it\neither, because they came around and gave us something to eat.\nAnd said that we would go towards the Swiss border, that from there on we would be\nexchanged against the German prisoners \u2014 not prisoners. I mean, the German people who\nwere outside Germany. And they wished us, so to speak, a good trip. Well, we were started\nto roll and roll and we came across areas where just before we had arrived there was a\nbombardment. Because already during that time the Germans \u2014 the Allies had advanced into\nGermany and there were also occasionally bombardments of various areas which was\nstrategically important to the Allies. And we were held back at various stations because the\ntrain rails had to be repaired and so forth. And we, we made a terrible detour, I remember,\nbecause suddenly we saw that we were in Berlin and we couldn't understand it. \u201cIf we go\ndirectly to the Swiss border how come we are going through Berlin?\u201d And we got very\nanxious and suspicious again. But, indeed, we, we came through southern Germany and we\nwere heading towards the Swiss border. Well, as you can imagine, people who had lived\nthrough that were not \u2014 their health was not the best. And there was one person in particular,\nI remember we stopped at a certain station, and his body \u2014 he had died during the train ride\nand his body was taken off the train and probably taken to the morgue of the village where\nwe had stopped. As we approached the Dutch \u2014 the Swiss border, the SS stopped the train at\na certain point and called people who were responsible from the group. They assigned\ncertain people \u2014 one of them was my dad \u2014 they called them out and told them that they had\nto tell us that only a small number of the people on the train were going really to\nSwitzerland. That we were in such a bad condition that we \u2014 they did not want us \u2014 to send\nus across the border. I guess they had a little feeling of shame left or whatever. We ended up\nin a \u2014 in the barracks, military barracks actually, and made one military person responsible\nfor us. It was \u2014 we were assigned actually there for a couple of nights. Quite nice rooms. And\nwe \u2014 they gave us something to eat. It wasn't very much, but we, we didn't have to starve\nduring that time. Wasn't too much \u2014 it was good. It wasn't too much, because our body and\nstomach didn't tolerate any more food really. But what we were not quite sure of \u2014 what were\nthey going to do with us? Where were we going? We knew that the war was towards an end,\nbut we did not know \u2014 until the day we left we were not informed that they had negotiated\nwith Berlin to send us back to Bergen-Belsen. Because the reason Berlin didn't say, \"Yes,\nsend them,\" they couldn't do it right away because the railroad tracks were even further\ndamaged and the communication \u2014 lines of communication were severed. So that it would\nhave been an eternal ride on the train, probably escaping from here to there. Instead, they\ndecided they would put us into an internment camp for the time being. And so we, we ended\nup in an internment camp; and in that internment camp were people from the islands of\nGuernsey and Jersey from England. Germans had occupied Guernsey and Jersey, and had\ninterned most of its citizens in, in various camps. One of them was that camp where we\nwere. During that time when we were in the camp it was very close to the end of the war.\nWas more illness, more \u2014 there was more help available for us because people had supplies\nfrom the British Red Cross. They were trying to de-louse us, cut off the hair because we\nwere just full with lice. They gave us some food. They had to share \u2014 could share with us.\nWe were getting a little more fed and a little oriented where we were, what happened to us;\nand on April the 23rd, 1945, the French Army liberated us.",
        "A: What was that like? It was unbelievable. We couldn't believe that this.... We had hoped\nalways that the war would end and that this would happen. But when it happened, it was so,\nso unbelievable that we should suddenly have our freedom again. Although we were in\nGermany and we didn't like that idea. But we were free. Free. And there were many \u2014 quite a\nnumber of weeks went by when we had to leave that camp and then we were, had to go to an\nUNRRA camp.\nEnd of tape 1\nTAPE #2",
        "A: \u2014I remember my cousin, my cousin, my aunt, my uncle and a little \u2014 my, my little cousin. I\nmean, say little cousin \u2014 my cousin was only three years old, one of them, when we were in\nthe camp. They \u2014 the boy lived with my uncle and the girl lived with my aunt, in the same\nbunk. I feel \u2014 when I look back I feel that communication and relations between the\nindividual people were really very rough. There was because maybe of the hunger \u2014 I, I don't\nknow. I always look back and I have always these horrible pictures in front of me. People\nstealing one another \u2014 off one another the bread. It could mean life or death if you had\nenough to eat. But this didn't count. People were uninhibitedly stealing. I remember for\ninstance there was only one toilet, and in the morning you had to stand in line, twenty,\ntwenty-five deep or something, to go to this one toilet. And people were screaming and\nyelling at one another and telling them, \u201cYou can't stay in any longer and I pull you out.\u201d It\nwas terrible. It was because of their own terrible needs I guess that they became like animals\nsometimes. I, unfortunately I don't remember that it brought out the best in anybody. I don't\nremember that. I wish I would, but I don't. I remember, for instance, other things that people\nbecause of the hunger, because of this, for some reason they were standing together and\nexchanging recipes. There were imaginary cooking sessions. There were dreams about \u2014 I\nremember with Hannelore, we were talking about if we're ever liberated, what would we do\nin terms of \u2014 we would buy a loaf of bread, buy coffee, jam and butter and prepare all of this,\nlock the door in a room, and do nothing but eating this bread, butter, jam and jelly, and, and\ncoffee. This was our dream. We repeated it. This was our hope. We had the strangest\nexperiences in these camps. For instance, there \u2014 one of the guards, she was called \u201cThe\nBlonde,\u201d she would come through the barracks and there was one woman who had a baby \u2014\nwho, of course, died, because a baby cannot survive at all under those circumstances. But she\nwould have it the weakness, sort of, and told the woman that she also has a baby, and she\nwould try and get her some food for the baby. And she visited her until the baby died, really\nnearly every day. Turning her around, she would come through the barracks every second\nday or so; and you had to have your bunk made up in such a perfect manner, totally straight.\nThere was not allowed that there was one little fold somewhere, one little wrinkle or\nanything. She would pull it away and she would make sure that your rations were cut out if,\nif she ever would find that this was not perfect. She also didn't mind to use her little whip on\npeople. And here she was that she was so concerned about the baby because she identified\nwith this woman and, and her own child \u2014 strangest occurrences.",
        "A: Well, I, I think a couple of things that \u2014 hope that you had sort of the \u2014 way down something\ntold you maybe, maybe we, we, we have to get out of this. We can't survive \u2014 we, we have to\nsurvive I mean, somehow. That this something was telling you, you have to and hope that\nyou will, and maybe that you were young and confident somehow that luck will be on your\nside.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: When, when we were in UNRRA camp, it was \u2014 it, it should have been a new beginning. It\nwas a new planning. It was a new thinking. \u201cWhere do we go from here? What are our, our\npossibilities to go from where?\u201d We could not go back to Germany. We did not want to go\nback to Germany. To go to Holland? Yes, we wanted to go to Holland; but we also knew\nthat we had wanted to leave Holland at one time. So we had to, to make a plan to use\nHolland only as a temporary place of, of, of sojourn, that we had to hopefully get to America\nor to Israel. Israel was not possible for us at the time. So America was more, more likely for\nus at that time. It was a matter of time, everything, but we had already so much times waited\nand spent and suffered. We, we wanted already to arrive somewhere.\nThere was a possibility for me to go much earlier than my father, because I was born in\nGermany. And the German quota to come to the United States was much smaller because the\nAmericans rightfully did not want the Germans to at that time to come to America. They had\nto be de-Nazified, or they wanted to make sure who it was so the only German-born people\nwere essentially a few exception scientists and so forth. And the German-born Jews, because\nthat quota was more open. My father, who was born in France, Strasbourg, had to wait much\nlonger than I did. So I went back to Holland. I was able to get to go back to Holland in 194\u2014\nend of 1947. This was nearly three years after the war. Oh, longer \u2014 more than three years\nafter the war. And after a few months in Holland, I finally was able to get a visa to come to\nthe United States. And the nice part of this was that when we had left \u2014 when we tried to\nleave Holland in 1940, we were going to go with the Holland-America line to America. And\nwe had booked the tickets. And the man who was in charge of the office in Rotterdam, for\nsome reason because of my father's work he knew my dad. And when I came to Holland,\nafter I had gotten my visa in Rotterdam, I said, \"Well, let me see. I go by the Holland-\nAmerica line.\" I had no money, really, to come to America, to go on the boat; but I went\nthere, and I said, \"Let me try.\" I said \u2014 I go in there and I said \u2014 I told my story, that I had left\n\u2014 was supposed to leave that time, that I never used the ticket and 1s it possible to use it now.\nAnd so the clerk to whom I spoke said, \"Just a minute.\" And he went into the office of the\nhead of this office, the director; and the director was there. And he came out personally, and\nhe called me into his office. And he, he, he was absolutely fantastic. But he was so nice and\nso stunned about the whole story I had to tell him. He said, \"There's no question that we will\nhonor your ticket.\" And not only did he send me to America on that boat with the ticket we\nhad paid so many years before, he put me into first class. And so I came to America on the\nfirst class, on the, on the Dutch liner. And he also honored, of course, my father's ticket. And\nthis was a few years later. So when he came to the United States, he also came with the same\nboat; and this was really a wonderful gesture of this man.",
        "A: Well, that story is \u2014 my close \u2014 those members who were really caught in, in this terrible\nstorm were my grandparents from my mother's side. My grandparents never left Germany.\nThey never were able to, to get out or to escape it, and we know from letters we have gotten\nand from facts that my grandparents were deported to Lodz ghetto in Poland in 1942. And\nwe also know that my grandfather died in Lodz, because my grandmother wrote it to her\nsister in Amsterdam. And since we lived in Amsterdam I, you know, I was able to, to get that\nmessage from, from this aunt. And what we later found out, my, my \u2014 the brother of my\nmother, uncle I have and we went back to Frankfurt and we went to this house where my\ngrandparents lived \u2018til the end, before they were deported. We know \u2014 from, from the\nengineer who lived in this house \u2014 they said that my grandparents were picked up and that\nday and put on one of those wagons, thrown on these wagons. My grandfather was over\neighty at that time, and he \u2014 his health wasn't very good. He never lived very long in the\nghetto, in Lodz; and my poor grandmother survived the ghetto, but then was sent to\nAuschwitz and of course never came back from Auschwitz. And my father's family, my\ngrandmother and grandfather were dead at that time. They died before Hitler even. My father\nhad some cousins in Berlin who did not survive the war in Germany and our family is rather\nsmall. My cousins in Holland and, and their parents, my father's brother and his sister-in-law\nand their two children, survived the war in a similar fashion than we did. Except after the\nwar, when they were liberated, they could go back to Holland much earlier than we could\nbecause they were originally Dutch citizens.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Oh, in the beginning it was very strange. It was very difficult for me. It \u2014 because I, I was\nshocked, because I arrived and maybe an hour later people started to ask me, \u201cHow do you\nlike America?\u201d I didn't know how I liked America. How can I know how I liked America? I\nmean, I was overwhelmed, with everything and I had to go out and find a room, a job, had \u2014\nit was a cultural shock for me. It took me quite a while till I got adjusted. I was very\ndepressed in the beginning when I came to America\u2014",
        "A: To New York. I only really started to feel good when I went to Charlottesville, Virginia,\nwhere we had some wonderful cousins. And I went to school; and slowly \u2014 and I also found\nsome friends there. One was actually another survivor, but I slowly got absorbed into \u2014\nlearned about American society and about family life and all the good things which I did not\nreally experience so much in New York. I don't think it's a good \u2014 it was the best place to\ncome to being.... If I had been received in a family or if I had \u2014 it, it wasn't so \u2014 I had to\nstruggle by myself mos\u2014 mainly. I had one nice experience, you know, I lived in \u2014 and a very\nstrange experience \u2014 I lived in a in a room which I rented from also a refugee family and I\ngot quite friendly with one of the girls. And years later, I think forty years later or something.\nI'm here in Washington and I belong to, to an independent congregation. And one night \u2014 it's\na community actually \u2014 and one night over coffee different people tell one another their story\nand talk to one another. And I find out that the woman I'm talking to is the daughter of that\nfamily where I, where I had a room when I first came to America. She's one of my very good\nfriends. Then after Charlottesville, I came to Washington; and I was a member of the\ninternational student house, where I met my husband and life started to get good.",
        "A: I have two children \u2014 two boys, Michael and David. And they are both married, have both\nwonderful families; and I have two grandchildren now.",
        "A: Yes, and he lived in New York. He worked for a Jewish self-help organization for many,\nmany years. He remarried once more, and he died three and a half years ago. He was nearly\nninety years old, and he was widowed just two years before he died. And during the last two\nyears of his life, he, he went \u2014 he traveled enormously and he was able to enjoy really\neverything more than he ever had before then, until the last six months of his life when he\ngot very ill.",
        "A: I don't know. I don't remember exactly.",
        "A: Oh, I'm sure they affected me a lot. I would say they certainly affected my self-confidence\nfor years. They certainly affected my own self-value for years. I'm sure they affected me in\nrelationships and trust in other people for years. I'm sure they still affect me in terms of if I\nsee police or uniforms or \u2014 still do. I think truly that if I have regained any of these it was\nreally due to my husband, who has helped me a great deal in overcoming some of these\nfears, the self-value, and all of that.",
        "A: Thank you.\n[Showing photographs]",
        "A: OK. These are my maternal grandparents, Alice and Louis Bloch, picture taken I assume\nwhen they were very young, marry picture perhaps.\n[Technical conversation |",

The young girl standing is a cousin of my father's,\nAlice Sternheimer, and I'm not sure who the young boy 1s but I, I guess it\u2019s her, her brother. I\ndon't know. But as I look at this picture, it's interesting \u2014 this must be taken around 1915, I\nfigure \u2014 the bowl you see standing there with the cherries on it, painted on it.
