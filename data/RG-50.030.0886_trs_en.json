Let\u2019s talk a little bit about your family. Did your father and mother come from\nWurzburg or where they from other places?",
        "A: My father came from I think Marabel and my mother, my mother\u2019s parents\u2019 names are very\nFrench. They were Babette and Raphael so I think there might have been some French ancestry\nthere but I\u2019m not quite sure where she was born.",

        "Q: Was he a person that you could get close to?",
        "A: He was in a German way. I think Germans are they\u2019re not as affectionate as Mediterraneans\nso yes he loved me a great deal.",
        "Q: You felt that?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That\u2019s the important thing is that a child feels this.",

        "Q: Like Anthony\u2019s Pier Four.",
        "A: Anthony\u2019s Pier Four.",
        "Q: That was a large restaurant.",
        "A: Yep. And my father since my parents were 44 when I was born, used to show me around the\nrestaurant before he was put in a concentration camp and I would get to a very important antidote\nin this, about this restaurant, if I may.",
        "Q: Sure, you mean an anecdote. Right.",
        "A: Anidote [ph], yes.",
        "Q: Sure, please tell us now.",
        "A: Ok. The restaurant was basically across the street from the University of Wurzburg. So a lot\nof students mostly men, would come in to eat. And now this was told to me, you have to\nunderstand now. I was very young. And sometimes my father if one or two of these students\ncouldn\u2019t pay their whole bill he would say you know when you become a famous lawyer or a\ndoctor or architect, you'll pay me back. And it did, may I go into that because it\u2019s a very\nimportant part of the story. We had a very large house. And after my father was put in a\nconcentration camp and the servants had quit because they were not allowed to work for Jews. I\nhad a nanny who quit. So we moved into three little rooms but other Jewish families that were\nbasically evacuated from their homes came to the door. And since we had the room, my mother\nwould tell them to go upstairs and just take some rooms. Well they were like shadows to me.\nBasically you know.",
        "Q: When you still had the large house?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Before you yourselves were evacuated from your home, you would take in other Jewish\nfamilies.",
        "A: Yeah. We were not evacuated from our home. We left willingly. Well anyway, Kristallnacht\ncame in November of 1938. And I slept in the same bed with my mother and all of a sudden I\nheard all this noise and noise again, we had almost they were castle doors and I heard pounding\nagainst them and then men shouting. And then we had marble steps going up there and I could\nhear, to this day I can hear the boots on the marble steps. Excuse me. (She wipes tears from her\neyes) And I would hear the children crying, the women screaming. I would hear a lot of yelling.\nMY mother took a dresser and pushed it against the door and she held me and she said, Inya,\nwhich is Inge in German, tonight we\u2019re going to die. And I didn\u2019t know what dying was. It, but\nshe was crying and I cried. And we heard glass breaking. And so much going on. And then the\nsun came up and we lived in more routes in what you now would call almost a cul-de-sac.\nThere were just three big urban mansions in this area. And there was a knock on the door and\nsaid Frau Meyer, Frau Meyer (she raises hand in fist to indicate knocking on door) and it was a\nman from across the cul-de-sac and he said they\u2019re gone. But she wasn\u2019t sure so she didn\u2019t move\nthe dresser. But then he convinced her and opened the door and there were dolls and shoes and\nclothes and glass strewn all over.",
        "Q: All over the house?",
        "A: All over the house. And we couldn\u2019t understand why were we left. It was just my mother\nand I left. And I don\u2019t know the time span because again I was six, but my mother found out that\none of the students who my father said you pay me back found out where my mother and I were\nand he stood in front of the door and told them to pass by. So he paid back.",
        "Q: Wow, wow. So that day who was taken, that night who was taken from the home.",
        "A: Everyone who was there.",
        "Q: All the people who were \u2014",
        "A: All the people my mother gave shelter to.",
        "Q: And your father?",
        "A: My father was in Dachau.",
        "Q: All ready?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And your siblings?",
        "A: Were in the United States and Palestine.",
        "Q: So it was only you alone with your mother at that point?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That is a very important anecdote, a very important story and with a very pivotal arc to it.\nBecause your father was so generous, it saved you and your mother.",
        "A: He just thought you know as a joke, he knew they wouldn\u2019t come back to pay money. That\nthey\u2019d forget that he had us in college. But whoever this was and we never found out the actual\nperson but we knew there was a Gestapo officer and that\u2019s all we know.",
        "Q: And you knew that he came to the restaurant and had not been able to pay.",
        "A: We were told you know by other people because the restaurant was closed, naturally. My\nmother had no workers. And the bakery was closed and I\u2019m sorry. (She raises hand to face,\ncrying) I\u2019m sorry.",
        "A: I feel I\u2019ve earned the title survivor. And uh.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s step back a little bit.",
        "A: Why don\u2019t you ask me the questions.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s step back a little bit. Before all of these things happened, I want to get a sense of what\nwas this world like? And I know that you were only six years old when Kristallnacht happened\nand you were the youngest of the family. So a lot of what you can tell me is what other people\ntold you.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: But I\u2019d like to get a sense of who was your family. From what you are telling me your father\nwent from being orphaned to being somebody who was quite well to do.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: How did that happen?",
        "A: Well again I was told he had lived in that area and he saw the house. I have his diploma from,\nhe is a master baker and I have his diploma hanging up on the wall upstairs. And he saved his\nmoney and at the age of 22, he bought the house, the picture that you saw.",
        "Q: I see and we\u2019ll show that picture later and film that.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Is that the house that had the marble stairs as well.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And you said that during the war it was bombed by the British at one point.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And then rebuilt.",
        "A: How I found that out was in 1978 one of our sons was on an exchange here in Switzerland at\nthe University of Freiberg and we went to see him. And I said to my husband, no matter what\nyou do, don\u2019t go on the Autobahn. And then I said you know we should go on the Autobahn. It\u2019s\nfaster. And all of a sudden he stopped and I had fallen asleep and he said Inge look at the sign\nand it says Wurzburg.",
        "Q: So from Switzerland into Germany.",
        "A: So I said let\u2019s go. I said maybe I can bury some ghosts. And we went to Wurzburg and I kept\nasking, I speak German. Not very well any more cause it\u2019s been a long time. And I kept saying\nin German, wo ist de strasse Franciscana [ph|",
        "Q: Franciscana",
        "A: Franciscana. And they gave me a street. It wasn\u2019t a street. Then one young German woman\nsaid maybe you mean Hansisgana Gasse [ph], which meant cul-de-sac. And we went there and\nan old man was walking with a cane. And I said to him, did you know a Jewish family named\nMayer. And he pointed to the house. (She raises her hand, pointing) And he said right there,\nthey lived there. The British bombed it. But it was rebuilt to specification and was now an\napartment house.",
        "Q: So it was rebuilt in the style that it had been \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes. They rebuilt, the whole city was devastated, mostly by the, some American planes,\nbut mostly by the British. And we saw pictures when we went to the city in 2013. It was just\nrubble, just rubble. But the German mentality is you put everything back where it was. And in a\nway it\u2019s good, in a way it\u2019s good. And the people we met then who were younger, who weren\u2019t\neven born, were absolutely wonderful. But 1t was, and somebody asked me. Wow, you must be\ngetting a lot of money from that. And I was notified several years ago, many years ago that the\nstate claimed the property for back taxes, because my father was in the concentration camp and\nnobody paid the taxes.",
        "Q: Oh my goodness.",
        "A: So I got in touch with a firm in New York called claims against the Holocaust and I\u2019m going\nto use language. The man down there said to me Mrs. Protentis you were screwed. That property\nnow this was in about 1980 something. In 1980 something, he said the value of the property is\nabout a million three quarters. And, but you know, not important. It\u2019s not important. I had my\nlife. I had, I live in a country that is absolutely beautiful. I had a wonderful husband and four\nwonderful sons. Fourteen of the best grandchildren. And I will always be grateful to this\ncountry for giving me asylum.",
        "Q: Thank you for sharing that and for taking me forward to a place where I would have asked\nquestions later but it\u2019s one of the questions that we had is that did you ever go back. How did\nyou respond to when you went back? What did you find there? The answer to all of those kinds\nof questions and the one about restitution. Did you ever get any restitution?",
        "A: And if I had been eligible, if I had been eligible. I had gone to the consulate in Boston.",
        "Q: The German consulate?",
        "A: Yeah, the German consulate. I had two little cousins, a girl my age and her brother who was\nmaybe three, two or three. I would never have taken the money. I could see these little hands\ncoming out of the earth saying Inge you\u2019re alive. You\u2019re married, you have children. We have\nno life. We are gone. We can\u2019t leave any memories, even though yours are bad. You have\nmemories in your life. I would never have taken the money. To me it would have been blood\nmoney.",
        "Q: Tell me about this branch of the family, these cousins. Were they children from your mother\u2019s\nbrother.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Did you know them personally?",
        "A: Yes. Yeah.",
        "Q: So what were their names?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Whose children were they?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: But you know they were your cousins?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And you knew that they, do you know how they perished?",
        "A: In a concentration camp. Because after the war my father came to this country and after the\nwar he went to the Red Cross to find out about relatives. It seems the whole extended family\nended up in concentration camps. And \u2014",
        "Q: Now when you talk about the extended family, did your father have siblings, even though he\nwas an orphan?",
        "A: He had a sister who was a teacher and she also perished 1n a concentration camp.",
        "Q: Did you remember her? Was she \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, she looked like a typical teacher. She had a bun (gestures with hands at face to\nindicate bun hairstyle) and she dressed with high neck dresses (gestures with hands to indicate\nneckline of dress), white collars and she always said to me, now when I tell you this, remember it\nInge. Teacher like. And we didn\u2019t see her often though we did see her.",
        "Q: Did she live in the same city?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: Rosa.",
        "Q: Rosa, like your mother.",
        "A: Yes. Yeah, seemed to be a very popular name. It\u2019s like Mary, you know.",
        "Q: In the 20s, well they would have been born earlier, 1t was a very popular name here in the\nStates in the 20s. Do you know whether these cousins were from your mother\u2019s or your father\u2019s\nside.",
        "A: [have no idea.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk about your mother a little bit. I\u2019d like to get a sense of what kind of a person was\nshe. You say that she had you pretty late when she was 44. Was she the same age as your\nfather?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Tell me about her, what was her personality like, your mom\u2019s?",
        "A: Very ahead of her time. Very driven. Now since my parents were very wealthy she had a lot\nof jewelry. She had a tiara with stones in it and bracelets. And I remember when they had\ndances, my nanny would let me sit on the steps and I could watch the women. And they had all\nthese beautiful things with green stones and white stones and red stones which I later found out\nwhere diamonds, rubies and emeralds you know.",
        "Q: A lot of bling.",
        "A: Yeah a lot of bling. And when this prosperous era ended and we were alone, she would wake\nme up in the middle of the night and take me to the roof. Bring a blanket and a pillow. And she\nhad a barrel that she carried and in it she had some tools. And the support beams in the attic were\nmade of wood. And she would dig out holes in the wood, catch the sawdust in the bucket and\nput in jewelry and she\u2019d come over, wake me up. Inge, you\u2019ve got to remember these numbers.\nOne, three, seven. In other words the support post one, three, seven. If anything happens to me,\nyou come here. I made them low. You can reach them. And you don\u2019t tell anybody where you\nget them. And you go to, gave me a name of two families. (Gestures with palm up) And you tell\nthem you\u2019re going to give them this and they should take you in and protect you. And then she\nwould take, she would be there for a long time. And I was cold you know. And then she\u2019d take\nthe sawdust and flush it down the toilet. And at times, we went to Gestapo headquarters (/ooks\ndown) and she took one of the jewels and put it in her hand and inquired about her husband, my\nfather. And afterwards she would shake the hand of the Gestapo officer and the jewel would be\ngone. And \u2014",
        "Q: Do you know if she got any information?",
        "A: She never told me. But my father survived and was released so something must have worked.",
        "Q: You mentioned the Kristallnacht",
        "A: (coughs) Excuse me.",
        "Q: You mentioned that during Kristallnacht that the rest of the family had already left. They\nweren\u2019t there or your father was arrested. So was it just you and your mother in the house.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: The storm troopers or these Hitler Youth officers, they were aware that there was just a\nwoman and a small child in the home.",
        "A: Ihave no idea. The Gestapo man who obviously stood in front of our door, must have known.\nIt\u2019s hard to say because there were other incidents. My parents had, my father had a huge library.\nWith a lot of (gestures with hand to indicate size) used to go around and on the bottom he used\nto have a shelf for my books. And one day it was during the day the Hitler Youth came in. They\ntook all the books including mine, put them in a pile in the middle of the cul-de-sac and burned\nthem. And my mother said to me, those are the ideas of men that they want to destroy. And I\nwatched the flames and I could see (gestures with hand, moving upward) heads of men coming\nout of the flames. And then I saw my books being burned. And they were animals coming out of\nthose books.",
        "Q: They were stories about animals and you saw it in your mind\u2019s eye?",
        "A: Yes. And so I became when I came to this country I became an avid reader. And very\ninterested in a lot of things but \u2014",
        "Q: A lot was taken away from you when you were such a baby still. A little toddler, a little girl\nat an age where children are so open to the world, and they are vulnerable. They don\u2019t have\ndefenses up. And \u2014",
        "A: And then now I don\u2019t know how far I'll get with this part of the story. My mother and I for\nsome reason were put in a camp. Now it wasn\u2019t a camp. It was more like a warehouse. And they\nhad bunks in there and it was all women and little girls. And one day some Gestapo officers\ncame in with some Gestapo women. And they picked out some little girls, including me. And I\nas either four or five. And they took us outside and I was so happy to be outside. I thought we\nwere going to go play. And they took us to this big house, who, it was full of Nazi soldiers.\n(Closes eyes) I\u2019m sorry.\n(filming stops)",
        "A: As sex toys.",
        "Q: Little girls.",
        "A: (nods head, yes) Yes. And my mother said to me when they took me, she said keep yourself\nclean, keep yourself pretty. Don\u2019t scream, don\u2019t cry. And I think she knew what was going to\nhappen. And after a few I don\u2019t\u2019 know the time span, I, I they came and they said the Mayer girl\nis not supposed to be here. And they took me and they brought me back to my mother. And she\nnever asked and questioned. She just wrapped me in a blanket and held me. (uses Kleenex to\nwipe nose) And a lot of the little girls who screamed and cried disappeared. (coughs) And, but I\nwas going to make it out of there. I was going to get out of there even if I had to crawl through\nthe door. I was going to get out of there. But they came and brought me back to my mother.\nAnd I kept washing myself, I kept washing myself. And I had this compulsion to stay clean and I\nwas obsessive compulsive as I grew up about cleanliness, even my house. I\u2019m better now but\n(smiles) in personal cleanliness and \u2014",
        "Q: Were these young men or older?",
        "A: Young men.",
        "Q: Young men.",
        "A: Yeah. And actually one of them came to our house after we were released from this whatever\nit was. Asking forme. Asked my mother. Where Ingeborg was. And I heard his voice. And I\nhid in acloset. And I don\u2019t know what my mother said to him. I\u2019m sorry. (emotional pause,\ncries) Even as a little girl. And I was not going to let this ruin my life and I was going to be\n(wipes tears from eyes) best of them in school. And since we came over, two weeks before my\nseventh birthday and my parents didn\u2019t put me into school until the fall and we came over in\nFebruary. I was like a year and a half behind, but I skipped half the second grade, half the\nseventh grade and half of a high school grade. And I actually graduated before I was 18. And \u2014",
        "Q: Did you have any idea, you were such a little girl. Did you have any idea what this was all\nabout. You know because children don\u2019t know at that age.",
        "A: (shakes head no) No. None, none whatsoever none whatsoever. And actually I was told\nafterwards too that they arrested my father, not for being a Jew, but he was in the caf\u00e9 and where\nhe went to the, they didn\u2019t call it a pub, they called it the house.",
        "Q: Like their little \u2014",
        "A: Hofbrauhaus. Hofbrauhaus. They say that Hitler is going to ruin Germany. So he was\narrested as a political prisoner. And \u2014",
        "Q: Were your parents religious?",
        "A: To a degree. To a degree. Not you know they kept a kosher house and but my father didn\u2019t\ngo to synagogue that often. When he came to the United States he went more often. And would\nask me to come cause he wanted to show me off that he was older and had a little girl, you know.",
        "Q: Did he ever find out what happened to you?",
        "A: I never told him.",
        "Q: You never told your mother or your father?",
        "A: I never told them. I never told them. I told when I was sixteen, it old the doctor and he wanted\nto tell my parents and I begged him not to. I said I don\u2019t want them to know.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a huge burden to carry.",
        "A: (nods head yes) And after I met Sam who 1s not Jewish.",
        "Q: Your husband, yes.",
        "A: He\u2019s very Greek. Did you ever see the movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding? Well that\u2019s I was\nwhat the male was in that movie. That they were so lively and so loving and Sam said Inge I\ndon\u2019t\u2019 want to know what happened. I like, being and when we met, but he encouraged me to go\ninto therapy which I did and I was in therapy for years. And told everything there, and well, not\neverything. But a lot. There are some things, I just get to a point where I think I\u2019m opening a\ndoor and I can\u2019t go on. And I don\u2019t know what it is. And I know I remember one part where\nsomebody put me in a box and covered me with blankets and put the cover down. And that\u2019s all\nI remember. I mean I can\u2019t go any further, but I\u2019m claustrophobic. And \u2014",
        "Q: Did you ever tell your children?",
        "A: My children know all about it. Well, know as much as I want to tell them.",
        "Q: You have four sons and that must be, you know sons are protective of their mothers. And \u2014",
        "A: My sons are the most incredible human beings, next to their father. They are very protective.\nAnd they are, they\u2019re just love, they love. They\u2019re big guys. You know two of them are six,\nthree. They\u2019re all college graduates. I made sure of that. And my grandchildren are even more\nprotective of me. Five of them have, as a matter of fact the fifth one is coming home\nWednesday. Have been to Israel on the birth right program. And Nicholas, Ryan, Alicia, Rachel\nand Justin are the last ones so far and they\u2019re very proud of their Jewish heritage. Yet, none of\nmy sons married Jewish women. And I had the most fantastic daughters in law. Two of them\ncalled me and they wanted to know whether they should come over and here and hold my hand\ntoday.",
        "Q: Do they all know these parts of your story?",
        "A: (nods head yes)",
        "Q: That\u2019s also pretty incredible. Many people who go through such traumatic things keep that so\nbottled up inside and their families are never given the chance then to try and wrap their arms\naround them and be protective of them. Doctors say that that\u2019s a very common, when a person\nhas been that abused and traumatized, that that\u2019s a very common reaction, is to just close\ncompletely and it takes a huge step to share that, as much as you want to share that. And as\nmuch as you can share that.",
        "A: They know because I tried to tell them you know that the people in Germany now are not the\npeople that committed these atrocities. They\u2019re dead. They\u2019re gone. That not to have hard\nfeelings against the people there now. But they\u2019re not quite into thinking that way.",
        "Q: I also want to thank you because in telling me you are also making this public to a wider\naudience and I know what a huge step that is and I\u2019m very grateful for it, but I know other\npeople who will be grateful for it. It\u2019s not just to share a horrible event. It is to bare part of one\u2019s\nsoul. And there is a cost involved to such things. And thank you for taking this step. Because\nthrough this people will be able to see what happened to a little girl. The little girl who was born\nin a family that loved her and could not protect her.",
        "A: (nods head yes) But I\u2019ve learned to protect myself. I\u2019ve learned to protect myself. I\u2019m very\nthick headed. I\u2019m very but I also know there are situations that should be avoided. I know we\u2019ve\ntraveled a great deal and I see that you know there are things going on in good countries that are\nnot healthy. That again I say I\u2019m grateful for this country. And no matter what is said\npolitically, America is great. It doesn\u2019t have to be remade great, it is great. And it should\nwelcome people who want to come and make a life for themselves here. I think my coming to\nthis country, me and my husband and having our sons. We always told them since they were\nlittle, you weren\u2019t born just to take. You were born to give back. And our oldest son is with the\nFBI. Our next son started a program for under privileged children in high school. And even\nstarted a step program so that they could go to college. Our third son is a microbiologist and he\ndoes as a matter of fact this weekend did the Pan Mass ride for cancer. Our youngest son is a\npsychotherapist for the mentally retarded. So",
        "Q: They\u2019ve done you proud.",
        "A: Yes. And they\u2019re giving back so I think you know there was a reason for my surviving and\nmeeting the wonderful man I call my husband.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back a little bit to the history. If we can. You said that your other siblings had left.\nWhat propelled them to leave? When you were born, were they already gone or when did they\nleave?",
        "A: My mother\u2019s son, my brother Emil. He couldn\u2019t get a visa to the United States so she sent\nhim to Palestine. What was then Palestine. She sent my sister to her brother in New York who\nwas a baker because they were using the Jewish girls as sex objects.",
        "Q: Your sister\u2019s name again, tell me.",
        "A: Was Betty.",
        "Q: Betty. And about what year did she send her away?",
        "A: I\u2019m trying to think. If we came over in 39. Maybe 37, 38. Cause we came over in 39.",
        "Q: And the sibling who you don\u2019t like to talk about.",
        "A: [still don\u2019t want to talk about.",
        "Q: Ok. I just wondered where he went. But that\u2019s ok. Back at your home, when was your father\narrested.",
        "A: I was three.",
        "Q: You were three. So you wouldn\u2019t have a memory of it.",
        "A: I did for this reason. We had a German shepherd dog, surprise, surprise. And I was playing\noutside in the cul-de-sac with him. And a black car pulled up. And I don\u2019t know whether it was\ntwo or three men in black coats with black hats. Came over to me and asked me what my name\nwas. And I told them. And they asked me where my father was. And I said I don\u2019t know. I\nthink he\u2019s in his office. And then they came out with my father who was handcuffed. And they\nsaid and my mother was running after them. And she said where are you taking him and they\nsaid don\u2019t worry. He\u2019ll be home in a few days. That was three and a half years that he was in\nDachau and Buchenwald. And that\u2019s why I remember it because I was sort of involved.",
        "Q: Did you feel guilty about that?",
        "A: Pardon me.",
        "Q: Did you feel guilty that 1f you hadn\u2019t told them you would \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Ok so you didn\u2019t feel that way.",
        "A: No I didn\u2019t because I was a three year old child.",
        "Q: Children sometimes assume a responsibility that isn\u2019t theirs.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Ok. Did you see him again in Germany?",
        "A: Yes. Once. My mother said they\u2019re moving papa from Dachau to Buchenwald. And I found\nout that the train is going to stop in Wurzburg in the middle of the night. So she woke me up and\nwe went to the train station and you could see the prisoners through the windows of the train.\nAnd there came my father and he put his hand out and my mother lifted me up and I kissed him\n(gestures with both hands raised) through the glass. That was the only time I saw him.",
        "Q: When did you leave, how did you leave Germany\u2019?",
        "A: We left Germany in January of 1939.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a couple of months after Kristallnacht. And your father must have lost the business\nseveral years before. Was there anything else that you were able to take with you.",
        "A: Yes. First of all well they move pewter, there was pewter here. (gestures and looks off\ncamera to her right) And some pewter downstairs. That vase that the flowers are in. I was told\nby an antique dealer it was a soup tureen that belonged to the King of Prussia. My parents had\nthis furniture which was I hated it because sometime had a duster and had all these curves. This\nwas in the United States though.",
        "Q: That they brought the furniture.",
        "A: So about a room and a half of they\u2019re called Biedermeier and baroque furniture. And my\nmother took me down to the pier where they were packing these big crates. And we walked\ndown and they said oh Frau Meyer. My parents obviously were known. And they said 1s this\nyour things. Yes and they talked for a few minutes and he said, whatever the other guy\u2019s name,\nFritz, Hans. We haven\u2019t eaten yet and we take a long time to eat, about four or five hours. So\nwe ll see you later, which was telling her if there\u2019s other things you want to get within four to\nfive hours, so she hailed a cab and we went back to the house, got some things. I don\u2019t remember\nwhat. And brought them back.",
        "Q: This is in Wurzburg. Because was it near a river.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t you know, you know these are things that\npuzzle me. Where did these things happen but I was too young.",
        "Q: The servants and the nanny, were you attached to the nanny that you had.",
        "A: No. No. I was actually glad she was gone.",
        "Q: Was she cruel or was she harsh?",
        "A: She was weird. (/aughs) She was not to my liking. She didn\u2019t teach me things. it\u2019s, give you\none example. It\u2019s probably ridiculous but I had this little table with two chairs. One day she puts\nthis orange thing on the table. And says here, here\u2019s an orange. I\u2019d never seen an orange before.\nI tried bouncing it and didn\u2019t, I tried rolling it. Figuring make noise. It didn\u2019t make noise.",
        "Q: What a weird toy.",
        "A: So then I said there must be a reason that she gave it to me. So I dug my thumb in and I saw\nsomething come up and juice came out. I thought, it\u2019s a drink. (points finger) And I started\npeeling it and then got the juice all over myself, all over the table (motions with hands) but I\ndiscovered how to peel an orange.",
        "Q: And she never told you \u2014",
        "A: She never told me it was, it was self-exploration.",
        "Q: And it was also to her mind self-explanatory.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You did not know that this is an orange.",
        "A: Did not know, no. I had orange but it was already peeled, but this was the first time I was\ngiven an orange (indicates with hands round shape of orange). So no she was weird.",
        "Q: Do you remember anything about the bakery or the business? How it looked.",
        "A: Yes. One of the reasons that I think I\u2019ve always tended to sweets, cookies and stuff like that\nwas every time I fell he\u2019d say here darling, have some whipped cream on a cookie. And you\u2019ll be\nbetter you know. And yes it was a very pretty bakery. My father was a master baker and he\ndecorated things that were like a fairy tale. They were fairy tales. I mean castles with moats\naround them and days and days of work. Beautiful things. And they tasted good too. And you\nknow he made me special things for special days and I didn\u2019t even want to bite them because\nthey were so pretty. But it\u2019s the caf\u00e9 I remember more. He would have the nanny dress me and\nhe\u2019d take me around the caf\u00e9 and say this is my daughter. You know. She\u2019s well this was, I was\nyoung. I was three. And he\u2019d introduce me and specially to ladies. And the older ladies had hats\non you know. (gestures with hands, hats) And I remember that more and it was beautiful table\ncloths and silverware and plates and you know it was so pretty and flowers in the middle. And \u2014",
        "Q: Did your mother work with him or did she have an \u2014",
        "A: Yes, she was also the brain of the business.",
        "Q: Was she?",
        "A: Yes. My father was tremendously innovative in business but my mother was the director and\nI think that\u2019s where I got my inspiration from. Yes.",
        "Q: In what way was she inspiring?",
        "A: Pardon.",
        "Q: In what way was she inspiring?",
        "A: She would, she would give orders and people would listen. And I was, she was, listening to a\nwoman. So when I got married and had four sons, I said to myself, well since I\u2019m the only\nfemale, I says guys before you start first grade you\u2019re going to learn how to make your bed.\nWell they did. It was a sloppy mess but they made it. They learned to cook basics. One would\nset the table, one would clear the table, one would sweep the floor. And put the wash away. We\nwere an equal opportunity house. And \u2014",
        "Q: And it started with Mama, modeling",
        "A: It started with Mama and I actually trained very good husbands. (/aughs)",
        "Q: I\u2019m sure your daughters in law agree with you.",
        "A: And they were wonderful when they were little boys. You know they, for mother\u2019s day they\u2019d\nbring me boxes of pansies and they would pick dandelions. And give them to me. And it was, it\nwas a good melding of mother and sons.",
        "Q: Did you ever become close to your elder siblings, Emil and Betty. Did you ever, because they\nleft when you were so little.",
        "A: No. Well. I married Sam when I was 19 and my sister was 18 years older and she had a hard\ntime having children. She just had one daughter who was born handicapped who just died last\nDecember. And there again my sons went down to New York to visit her. They took care of all\nher affairs, her papers. They made sure that she got the proper service before she died. They got\nhospice for her. She had pancreatic cancer.",
        "Q: This is for your niece.",
        "A: For my niece my sister\u2019s daughter. And they were very good to her. And I went down several\ntimes but you know it was very difficult because she was like my little sister. My father opened a\nbakery in New York. And after school I would go over there, pick up Evelyn. That was her\nname. And bring her home. And she had, she was born premature and she had several operations\nso she had a body cast. And I used to bring her into the house and take care of her. And so she\nwas like my little sister and it was hard when I lost her. And I called her like a couple of times a\nweek. And when she was younger she always used to come up here for part of the summer. And\nshe always came up for Thanksgiving. My sons would go and pick her up and bring her back.\nAnd even my youngest granddaughter , Dreslin who\u2019s nine. She remembers Evelyn would send\nher $2 for her birthday and a card. So this year I sent her a card with $2 and I you know.",
        "Q: What about your sister herself, when did, did she live a long time?",
        "A: My sister died at the age of 69 from liver cancer. And so Evelyn lived alone for a long time.\nAs close as we could be because our lives were so different.",
        "Q: What did she do when she came to the United States, your mother had sent her away to \u2014",
        "A: She was, actually she was a maid for wealthy Jewish families.",
        "Q: Did she stay in the New York area?",
        "A: Manhattan, mm hmm, upper Manhattan.",
        "Q: Near Inwood you know there\u2019s that area in upper Manhattan. Was it Washington Heights?",
        "A: It\u2019s, that (coughs). Excuse me.",
        "Q: And Emil, what became of him?",
        "A: Emil never came.",
        "Q: He stayed in Palestine?",
        "A: He died in 1969 the same year as my mother. He was obese. For a while, he was in the\nIsraeli army, the Hagenah and but he, let\u2019s put it this way. He was spoiled rotten. Like when a\nbunch of them would go to the Alps hiking, his idea of hiking was paying other guys to pull him\nup the mountain.",
        "Q: It was inventive.",
        "A: And I never knew him. I never met him. He left when I was three. However, my sister called\nme one day and she said I just received a call from someone who said they were with Emil\u2019s\ndaughter in Manhattan and she was visiting. I said so what did you do. She said she hung up. I\nfigured it was, it\u2019s a joke. So I said the next time they call give them my telephone number. So\nthey called me and I went down to New York and met them. And they came up here. and so this\nwas my brother\u2019s oldest daughter and her husband. And so we went to Israel three times and we\nmet the whole family (gesturing with hands) and toured Israel. And now my five grandchildren\nwho have been to Israel have stayed with my grandnephew Nitzan. He built a house with one\nroom just for our family.",
        "Q: The grandnephew.",
        "A: Yeah. (clears throat)",
        "Q: How nice. A relationship that was fractured but never really was able to grow and you never\nreally met him after he left. And yet the other generations have been able to connect again.",
        "A: Yeah and he, he is so funny. And he\u2019s a riot and we are so close. He\u2019s like our fifth son. And\nhe\u2019s 44. He taught our oldest grandson Nicholas how to play soccer. He\u2019s been here a few times\nand there was one story very funny. They came here one year. He and his wife. And they said\nthey were traveling with another Israeli company, couple. And said ok so one night he said Sam\nwe have to go to Boston and pick up or friends and as they\u2019re walking out the door, they were\ncoming down from Canada. I said where are they staying. He says here. Surprise, surprise. So\nluckily at that time our oldest son Russell was living in Brockton. So I sent Jeffrey who was\nhome on winter break and Scott to his house to sleep, changed the sheets.",
        "Q: Like you said command central.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: It sounds like from this that you\u2019re the only one who went back to Germany ever, of the\nfamily.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You mentioned your mother bringing some extra items to where the Biedermeier and the\nbaroque furniture was being packed up. Do you remember anything from the journey itself?",
        "A: Very much so. We came over in February from Germany. We left the port of Bremen and\nwe had a cabin. My mother and I never left the beds because we were deathly seasick. One time\nwe were feeling a little better and we had decided to go to the dining room and we were\nwatching the other patrons eat. And my mother says to me, look they\u2019re eating food that we feed\nto the pigs. They were eating corn on the cob.",
        "Q: I guess Europeans don\u2019t do that.",
        "A: No. So we sat there for like ten minutes, went back to our cabins and got sick.",
        "Q: How is it that you were able to come to the United States?",
        "A: You have opened another book. When my, my mother kept saying we had cousins down\nsouth. When my sister died.",
        "Q: 1969.",
        "A: No, my sister died (closes eyes)",
        "Q: Oh that was Emil who died in 1969.",
        "A: I\u2019m trying to think what year she died. No my brother died in 69 and my mother died in 69.\nMy sister died wait a minute I have to figure my daughter in law\u2019s age. My daughter in law is 62.\nShe died when she turned 30, so 32 years ago is when my sister died.",
        "Q: So it would have been 84. 1984. Ok.",
        "A: So I went down with my son Paul and my niece asked me to go through her papers. And so\nPaul and I went through them and I found a letter from a Jamie Miller from Memphis Tennessee.",
        "Q: A Jamie Miller.",
        "A: Jamie Miller mm hm, and said I do genealogy and I believe, this was addressed to my sister\nthat you\u2019re related. And the letter was two years old.",
        "Q: So it was 1982. That it was written.",
        "A: And with it was a genealogy chart. And I\u2019m saying ehh. But Paul pulled the stuff out of the\ntrash basket (/ifts hand in fist) and says take it home. We\u2019ll look at it. And when we got home,\nScott was home on winter break or spring break from college. He went to U Mass Amherst and\nhe loves research. So I says Scott look at this and see what you can come up with. And he\nlooked at 1t and he said mom the closest I can come 1s that there\u2019s a family named Kamien in\nCleveland, Mississippi.",
        "Q: Kamien in Cleveland",
        "A: Kamien. That are related to you and I said bet you those are the cousins. Now this man put\nup the money for all of us to come over and sponsored us. At the time I think you had to put up a\nthousand dollars a person and leave it in the bank for five years. So that",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: The immigrants would not become a burden to this country. He never knew us, he never\nknew us.",
        "Q: So you never met him.",
        "A: Never met. Anyway I pick up the phone and I say I'd like Kamien in Cleveland, Mississippi\nand the operator said to me, there\u2019s a Kamien\u2019s department store. I said put me in touch with\nthem. So a woman answered and she says Kamien\u2019s. I said this sounds weird but I\u2019m calling\nfrom the Boston area. And I think I\u2019m related to the owner of the store. And she said well\nhoney child, Ill put you in touch with the president of the company. I.A. Kamien. And I spoke\nto him and he said oh my aunt, she has all the information. Her name is Rosebud Davis, not\nRosa, Rosebud. And I called her and it seems my maternal grandfather had eight brothers and\nsisters that came to the southern United States in the early 1900s. And I have relatives all over\nthis country where I thought I had nobody.",
        "Q: Oh my goodness.",
        "A: So we invited Rosebud and her husband up here and we went down south and met them. And\nit was, this Kamien that sponsored us and also said he had jobs for us, which was not true. He\ndid. But he was also an amazing man. He hired the first black in Mississippi to work to manage\nhis story and it was a woman and he gave land to both the Baptist and Methodist churches. And,\nand as a matter of fact, at Sam\u2019s 90\" birthday which was June 4\" of this year, Jamie Miller came\nup here with her husband and her brother came from Los Angeles. And \u2014",
        "Q: Wow. So your grandfather, the dapper mister \u2014",
        "A: Yeah cleaned the bottom of his cane and the soles of his shoes.",
        "Q: So it was one of his siblings.",
        "A: No, it was my mother\u2019s. It was the Reichenberg family.",
        "Q: That\u2019s what I mean. But I thought \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, you\u2019re right. Yes, you\u2019re right.",
        "Q: So it was one of his siblings who was \u2014",
        "A: It was eight of his siblings that came to the United States, the southern part.",
        "Q: And do you know how the Kamiens were related to him.",
        "A: This Kamien who sponsored us was married to my grandfather\u2019s sister. (coughs) And so\nthat\u2019s she had married a Reichenberg and --",
        "Q: So when you came to the United States was it just your mother and yourself or did your\ngrandfather come with you?",
        "A: My grandfather came with my father. Afterwards. I can\u2019t remember how many months later\nbut it was just before Germany invaded Poland.",
        "Q: It was the same year but Germany invaded September first 1939 and you left the last days of\nJanuary 1939 so it was sometime between early February and late August that your grandfather\nand father would have \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: So tell me how was it that your father was released. Many people were not.",
        "A: Ok. I had told my doctor that Lauren was doing this project on my family through the\nHolocaust museum.",
        "Q: The interview we\u2019re having today.",
        "A: Mm, hmm. And we couldn\u2019t understand how my father a German Jewish man was released\nfrom two of the worst concentration camps in Europe. So he said when he was in college, he read\nthis book and it was titled the Extermination of the European Jew. Now I started calling around\ndifferent libraries. None of them have it. But the Brockton, the main library had one copy. And I\nwent down and I got it and I read it, very difficult book to read cause it had so many notes and\nother things. (gestures with hand) But I found out that the Nazis decided the Jewish men who\nhad fought in World War I and won a medal. My father won the Iron Cross, which was like the\nDistinguished Service Cross, would be given more liberties. And so I guess that\u2019s why he was\nreleased. That\u2019s the only thing I could think of.",
        "Q: So he had had military service during the First World War.",
        "A: World War, yeah.",
        "Q: Was the book written by Raul Hilberg?",
        "A: By whom?",
        "Q: Raul Hilberg. Is that the book, the Destruction of European Jewry? Is that the book you \u2014",
        "A: The Destruction of European Jewry. I can\u2019t remember the, I have, went online, I can use a\ncomputer.",
        "Q: As I told you, I\u2019m impressed.",
        "A: I went online and I got two paperback copies, sent one to Lauren and I have it upstairs.",
        "Q: We'll take a look later. We\u2019ll take a look which book it is. So you were calling around to\nfind out and this book is the only one that gave you a sense \u2014",
        "A: That gave me that information.",
        "Q: Your father. Did he ever talk about his time in Buchenwald and Dachau?",
        "A: Never, never. He had a lot of scars on his back. I guess that was from beatings. But he never\ntalked about it. And to tell you the truth I didn\u2019t want to hear him. I. I had a very horrific\nchildhood. I had and I had, I didn\u2019t know I was such a pusher as a child, but I was. But I was\ndetermined to survive and to bring some good into this world.",
        "Q: When you say I was a pusher.",
        "A: A pusher to survive. And I wasn\u2019t going to let anybody destroy my will. And when I came to\nthis country and saw this unbelievable freedom, like we lived in our first apartment, we lived\nacross the street from the school. And there was a playground and I saw these kids keep throwing\na ball through a round thing. After in the evening I went across the street with a little ball. And I\nkept practicing throwing the ball through the hoop. Because I wanted to be like them. Well I\nended up being captain of the basketball team in high school.",
        "Q: Good for you, good for you.",
        "A: And I was in all the accelerated (wipes eyes with tissue) classes but then I was time, I got\naccepted by City College of New York. My father wouldn\u2019t let me go. He said women don\u2019t\nneed an education. But I did go. I applied for a job to [unintelligible]. And I went at night. I\nwent from work to CCNY. (points finger for emphasis) Then from CCNY, took the train to the\nBronx, was up til 3:00, 4:00 studying. Got up 5:30 to go to work. Had a breakdown, couldn\u2019t do\nit anymore.",
        "Q: It\u2019s a huge stress.",
        "A: And, but I completed one semester. Better than nothing.",
        "Q: Of course. When you were working \u2014",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: When you were working, where were you working.",
        "A: Endicott Johnson. They were a shoe company. And I was secretary to the treasurer. And\nlearned a lot about the stock market. And Sam was training to be a road salesman. That\u2019s how\nwe met.",
        "Q: Id like to take a break right now.",
        "A: I'd like to take a break too.",
        "Q: So let\u2019s do that and have some lunch and...",
        "Q: Your father and your grandfather came over separately than you and your mother.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did your grandfather, why did he stay behind?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: And the only time you had seen your father was when your mother lifted you up to press you\nagainst the pane of glass as he was being transferred from one concentration camp to another.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Do you remember the moment you saw him again after that?",
        "A: Yes. But, I was afraid of him. I didn\u2019t recognize him. He had turned gray. He was very thin.\nAnd I held back and I couldn\u2019t hug him at the beginning because I thought he was another man\nwho was a threat to me.",
        "Q: Did you see him as he got off the boat or did he come to where you were living?",
        "A: No, to the apartment. He came to our apartment.",
        "Q: Can you paint a picture of how he looked to you at that moment when you saw him again?",
        "A: Stranger. A stranger. Because when he left, he wasn\u2019t fat but he was you know a little over\nnormal. He had, my father had red hair and a red moustache and a goatee. (gestures with hand\ngoatee) And now this skinny person who\u2019s all gray, I didn\u2019t know who he was.",
        "Q: How did he behave?",
        "A: Geez, that\u2019s hard to tell. All I know is he was here for two, in this country for two days and\nwe lived in Manhattan then in the 80s, 98\" street, something like that (gestures with hand) And\nhe went into a bakery and was a German Jewish section. And he said my name is Max Mayer.\nI\u2019m a master baker and I want a job. And this was two days after, and he got it.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: And very hard worker.",
        "Q: Was he someone that, how long did it take or did it happen that you got used to him again and\nwasn\u2019t, weren\u2019t afraid of him?",
        "A: I can\u2019t really pin a time on it. You know but I was the apple of his eye. And the Jewish high\nholidays, he would have, my mother\u2019d buy me a new dress. You know she was, and he\u2019d go\n(holds palm of hand up) and he\u2019d go to the synagogue and you know in New York, at that time,\nyou know this is I hate to say it a long time ago. Children could walk the streets safely. So my\nfather would go to the services early and then I\u2019d go about 10, 11:00 all dressed up, walk to the\nsynagogue. And he\u2019d look back to see me and he\u2019d bring me and sit me next to him. This was so\nwonderful cause you know he was strutting. However, at the age of 11, I developed and that year\nmy mother bought me a white dress. And I did my usual. Went to the synagogue, not thinking\nabout anything. And my father looked back, saw me, escorted me next, sat me next to him. And\nall of a sudden, Jewish men call what they do daven. They say their prayers out loud and they\nare davening the crescendo rose. Because they saw now I was developed. The rabbi comes\ndown from what they call the bimah or the platform. And he asks my father and me to come to\nthe back of the synagogue. And he says Max your daughter has to sit with the women. She\u2019s a\nwoman now. He says my daughter is my equal and she will sit next to me. And if you don\u2019t\napprove I\u2019m leaving this synagogue and he took off his shawl. And he took me by my hand and\nhe walked out and joined another synagogue. Now so that made a big impression on me, that\nwell I always thought of myself as his equal. You know. I was never I never felt different until I\nwanted to go to college. Then, then there was a conflict, but as I was growing up, we would have\nconversations about everything and he respected my opinion. Even at the age of 12 and 13 or\n14. And I respected his.",
        "Q: Were you closer to him than to your mother?",
        "A: Yes. Yes. But I loved my mother more. But for this very reason. I owed my life to her,\neven as young as I was, I realized it. And with the jewelry and the bribery and going to Gestapo\nheadquarters and my mother, I usually had a hard-boiled egg and toast for breakfast. She would\npeel the egg, slice the toast (gestures slicing toast) in little bite sized pieces. This is when I was\n18 you know. And it was a love hate relationship. I don\u2019t know how I can explain it you know\nother than that. There were things I\u2019d rather not go into about that.",
        "Q: It sounds to me that you were also the apple of her eye. You know",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Who would cut the egg and the toast when you already have a teenager in the house? You\nknow they\u2019d do it themselves.",
        "A: Right. Right. And yeah and you know I would have conversations with both of them but I\nnever recall having a conversation with the three of us. It was always me and one of them.",
        "Q: Did they get on with one another?",
        "A: Inever saw much love. No, I didn\u2019t. It\u2019s not like Sam and I always kissing you know. Even\nat this stage of our life. No, I never saw much love between them. But yes, they both, they both\nadored me.",
        "Q: Did they ever speak about what had gone on in Germany in the 1930s when you were older.",
        "A: Never.",
        "Q: Never",
        "A: Never. Never. The only thing my mother ever said is America is the most beautiful country\nin the world. You can be anything you want. This is the land of opportunity. But they never\nspoke about what went on. As a matter of fact I didn\u2019t even know about the property. I didn\u2019t\nknow anything. They never told me anything. I didn\u2019t\u2019 know that my mother\u2019s father had eight\nbrothers and sisters that came to the United States in the early 1900s. I knew nothing. I was,\nwhen people ask me. It\u2019s so hard to understand, it\u2019s hard for me to understand. I also couldn\u2019t\nunderstand why she didn\u2019t bring my brother over from Israel. And I asked questions but if you\nknow me for a little while, I ask a lot of questions. But I wasn\u2019t given any answer. I was given\nevasive answers. And but you accept them, you know.",
        "Q: Your grandfather, did he live on his own or did he live with you?",
        "A: He lived with us for a while. That\u2019s why he was so clean. I had to learn to control my\nbladder. Cause he monopolized the bathroom.",
        "Q: The one bathroom.",
        "A: And then for a little while he went into a nursing home and I recall visiting him. And then\nwhen I was nine he died.",
        "Q: He died very soon after arriving here?",
        "A: Yes, yes, So \u2014",
        "Q: Had he had his own business when he was in Wurzburg?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. You know I tell this to my children. I want them to know as\nmuch as possible about me. And Sam tells them about him (gestures with hand). And his\nSpartan Greek heritage. Because I was left with so many (gestures with hand at chest) blank\nspaces. I can\u2019t answer, I want to but I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: But you don\u2019t know.",
        "A: But I don\u2019t know. And Ursula, my, we went to Germany on the survivors\u2019 group. She\u2019s the\nretired OB GYN. She went to Munich and found out so much about my father that I didn\u2019t\nknow.",
        "Q: For example.",
        "A: I don\u2019t want to tell you. My brother Emil was born. I can\u2019t remember exactly the year but\nlet\u2019s just say 1910 (gestures with hand). He was born in April of 1910 and they were married in\nFebruary of 1910. I wish I would have known this when they were alive. I could have\nblackmailed them. Don\u2019t put that (points at interviewer)",
        "Q: No, such information is worth something.",
        "A: And you know there are so many blanks and she was able to give me the city he was born in.\nThere were only seven Jews there when he left and went to Wurzburg. How ambitious he was to\nbuy this building at the age of 22. How well respected he was and obviously by the students at\nthe university and even the packers down at the pier, who packed my mother\u2019s furniture. They\nknew her on sight. And so there are a lot of spaces in my life and I have no information on. I\nwish I did but I don\u2019t.",
        "Q: Did your parents ever talk about, if they didn\u2019t talk about the bad times, did they ever talk\nabout their own childhoods.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: And your grandfather did he ever talk about when your mother was little?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Or himself when he was little?",
        "A: No. [had to figure everything out for myself. I learned to play basketball. I learned English.\nThere was a teacher when I went to first grade and I was old. I was seven and a half. And she\nindicated to me that she wanted me to stay after school every day. And I didn\u2019t understand her\nbut I figured it, to teach me English. For a year. Every day this Polish teacher taught me\nEnglish. And I credit her with so much for and also in teaching me the language, making me\naware of things 1n science, in the animal world and she taught me well. Halloween when she hid\npennies. I always found the most of them.",
        "Q: Do you remember her name?",
        "A: Yes. Mrs. Shelisinsky.",
        "Q: Shelisinsky.",
        "A: Shelisinsky.",
        "Q: And you went to school where, in what part of \u2014",
        "A: In Manhattan.",
        "Q: The upper west side.",
        "A: Yes. Well now wait a minute. Let me think now. Yeah I started school in Manhattan, but\nthen we moved to the Bronx but I can\u2019t remember what year. We moved to the Bronx, maybe\nafter two years. But by that time I was really well versed in the English language. As a matter of\nfact I became my parents\u2019 interpreter.",
        "Q: That was going to be my next question. What language did you speak at home still?",
        "A: German.",
        "Q: And they continued to speak German?",
        "A: Yes. Yeah, that\u2019s why I was on one of the committees that was, here in Brockton was the\nlinguistic, the immersion of children from foreign countries into a second language class. And I\nsaid I didn\u2019t\u2019 think it was necessary that it was a waste of money. And the superintendent of\nschool and I were like this. (gestures with fingers crossed) So the woman who was in charge,\nthe bilingual program said oh you cannot imagine how hard it is for a child who comes from a\nforeign country, doesn\u2019t know a word of English. And goes into a class where only English is\nspoken. And the superintendent of schools is sitting next to me smiling. He says I\u2019d like, I'd like\nInge Protentis to discuss this with you. I can\u2019t remember her name. But I knew she hated me\nafter this. I said I\u2019m one of those children, came from Germany. I went into a classroom. I had\nno idea what the teacher wanted. She pointed. I sat. She said get (gestures with finger pointed\nupwards) up, I got up. She said when it\u2019s time to go home, she showed me to put on her coat.\nAnd I said and I learned English and I skipped three classes. And graduated before I was 18,\neven though I was a year and a half behind. So after that the woman wouldn\u2019t talk to me. I mean\nI understand it\u2019s her job and I understand that with some children it probably is very necessary.\nSpecially if they\u2019re older. But I still think immersion into the language totally you learn quickly.",
        "Q: Children are like sponges",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: They pick this up very easily. It sounds like that was a difference 1n policy decision and with\npolicy decision comes money so whether it was something is going to be funded or won\u2019t be and\nso on.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: When you came to the United States on that ship where you were seasick and so on and saw\ncorn that people were eating in that dining room. Do you remember when you first saw land. Do\nyou remember seeing the Statue of Liberty?",
        "A: Yes. The ship stopped rocking from side to side for quite a while and my mother said Inge\nget dressed in your best dress. We\u2019re going to go upstairs to the deck. And I did and we went\nupstairs and it was crowded with people. I was like you could hear a pin drop. You would hear a\nwoman sobbing. Every once in a while. And it was lined, you know my mother pushed me to\nthe front. And I couldn\u2019t\u2019 understand what there was about this big stone lady that made people\ncry. Until I knew it was the Statue of Liberty.",
        "Q: As far as you know were other people on that ship also Jewish refugees?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I assume so but there were also Americans on the ship. It was a huge ocean\nliner called the Bremen.",
        "Q: The Bremen.",
        "A: Bremen, SS",
        "Q: A German ship",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And so that meant German personnel on the ship.",
        "A: Yes. Now here\u2019s the amazing thing. Our room steward, you usually give them something. At\nthe end of the voyage that day we were at the Statue of Liberty. He brought us a huge fruit\nbasket. Yes. And we hadn\u2019t eaten anything in five days. Yeah, but yeah and I told this, when\nI\u2019ve spoken at the schools. I\u2019ve told the children they cannot imagine. They cannot imagine the\nfeeling that I had later on when I realized what that big stone lady meant. And of course they all\nknew. They said oh it\u2019s the Statue of Liberty. And I said yes, but it\u2019s more than just a statute. It\nhas so much meaning. It means you have freedom. It means you know that no one is watching\nyou, that no one is judging you on where you go to church or synagogue. Or you know what\ncountry you come from. It means that you are free, free American. And yeah, that moment will\nalways stay with me.",
        "Q: Did someone meet you at the pier?",
        "A: Yes, my uncle. My uncle who originally \u2014",
        "Q: Ludwig.",
        "A: Ludwig. Good memory. Ludwig met us at the pier, yes. And we were driving to his\napartment and, through Times Square and I said what\u2019s wrong with these people. They\u2019re not\npulling their shades down. They have all the lights on. Cause in Germany you had to pull the\nshades and keep it dark and I said I don\u2019t see anybody walking with a Star of David on their\nsleeve. And my uncle was trying to explain to me that they don\u2019t have to.",
        "Q: Did you stay with him?",
        "A: We stayed with him for about a week and then we got an apartment.",
        "Q: Your own apartment.",
        "A: Our own apartment. Now here\u2019s my mother ok. Most of her jewelry went to save my father,\nwhich was a very good cause. But I saw her putting a couple of things into a cotton cloth which\nshe put into a teapot which she put the teapot into a big pot and the big pot into a bigger pot. We\nget to Manhattan and there are the customs agents. She got it out of Germany. She comes down.\nShe says let me help. She starts carrying the linens up, pillows up, pots up. And the pot\n(gestures, pointing with both hands) and in the pot was there wasn\u2019t much left. If you have time\nat the end I\u2019Il show you the pin.",
        "Q: I'd love to see it. Do you still have a piece of her jewelry?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Oh that\u2019s amazing.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That\u2019s amazing. Ok, we\u2019d love to film it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So she brings up the pot in which \u2014",
        "A: The jewelry was. Yes. So she got it past the Germans and got it past the customs agent.\nThat\u2019s why I said she was, she was daring and she was brave and she was smart.",
        "Q: And so she had enough money to at least start, at least rent the apartment.",
        "A: Mm hmm",
        "Q: At least be on her own rather than live in the corner of somebody else\u2019s place?",
        "A: As far as I know because we lived on our own.",
        "Q: And so you got all of that furniture that you didn\u2019t like so much, the baroque furniture with\nthe curlicues that you\u2019d have to dust \u2014",
        "A: Well one and a half rooms, but you know she had to buy beds and kitchen set and things like\nthat. Yeah. But and I was amazed that we had just like five rooms. Where\u2019s the rest of the\nrooms? This is it.",
        "Q: Five rooms, upper Manhattan. Not so bad.",
        "A: No but you know.",
        "Q: You\u2019re used to a whole house. When your father came and the second day he\u2019s here he finds\na job as a master baker. Tell me a little bit about how things developed for him. Did he\neventually strike out on his own. Did he stay there?",
        "A: He opened a bakery. He opened a bakery in the west Bronx and he was, you know the baker.\nMy mother worked at the country. My sister and my brother in law and as a matter of fact, our\nbest friends, Charlie and Thelma Cartsteen, her sister in law lived in New York and when I told\nher the story, she goes the Meyer bakery. We used to stand on line every Sunday to get in there.\nAnd I said yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: They (inaudible). So he repeated his success.",
        "A: He did, but he was older now and it was getting harder for him and there were little family\nsquabbles you know. So eventually they closed the bakery. It was a huge success but my father\nmade it a success, not just was he a master baker. His breads and rolls and you know were out of\nthis world. They were light and fluffy and you know so it\u2019s not just cakes which were works of\nart. It was the whole thing.",
        "Q: Did you help him in\u2014",
        "A: I did work there. Yes.",
        "Q: What did you do?",
        "A: I, I was behind the counter. I sliced rye bread on the slicer. Yeah I weighed the stuff and\nlooked up on the chart how much it was.",
        "Q: And did you talk to the customers in German or in English?",
        "A: English. Oh no, I spoke only English. Yeah.",
        "Q: When you started to grow up you said that that\u2019s when your dad already it was harder for him\nto see an equal sign between a girl and a boy. How did this start, this discussion of you wanting\nto go to college and him saying no.",
        "A: Well my teachers told me at that time, City College New York was very hard to get into. It\nwas very selective. You had to have, I can\u2019t remember if it was all A\u2019s and maybe a couple B\u2019s.\nBut I had, I was an all A student. I got a B once in something, can\u2019t remember. It was probably\nart, cause I\u2019m a lousy artist. Anyway, and they encouraged me to go. And they asked me what I\nwanted to do and I said, I wanted to be a scientist like Madame Curie. I wanted to find a cure for\nsomething. So they helped me you know fill out the forms to City College. I got accepted and\nlike I said it was competitive. Right now all you need is a high school diploma to get in now.\nAnd but it costs money just like a state school and my father said I don\u2019t have the money and\nyou\u2019re a woman and women don\u2019t need an education. And I said so why did you let me go to\nschool. I mean we had big arguments. I said well why did we have all these discussions. You\nsaid you respected my opinion. But it didn\u2019t work so anyway, I got the job. I met Sam so it\nworked out.\n(cut for a second)\n(file 2 \u2014RG.50.030.0086.01.02; duration: 05:53)",
        "Q: Just like this.",
        "A: Wait a minute.\n(arranging filming)",
        "Q: Ok, so Ingeborg please tell me. What is this that you\u2019re holding.",
        "A: This is a pin that was my mother\u2019s mother\u2019s in Germany.....It\u2019s set in a platinum metal and\nit\u2019s the only piece of jewelry I have left of my mother\u2019s.",

        "A: Id rather not talk about him.",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: My father came from I think Marabel and my mother, my mother\u2019s parents\u2019 names are very\nFrench. They were Babette and Raphael so I think there might have been some French ancestry\nthere but I\u2019m not quite sure where she was born.",
        "A: No, she had two brothers.",
        "A: Yes, Ludwig and Solomon.",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall. Ludwig came to the United States. I don\u2019t know what year but I know that he\nlived in Manhattan and he became a baker. Solomon I didn\u2019t know when he came to the United\nStates but he did.",
        "A: Yeah. No. Yes. [have to think.",

        "A: Since I was the youngest. My father was orphaned at a young age, about 13. And so I had no\npaternal grandparents. My maternal grandmother had passed. So I just had my maternal\ngrandfather, Raphael.",
        "A: Definitely.",
        "A: Oh. He was Mr. Clean personified. He would get dressed up in a suit, watch fob, walked\nwith a cane, that had a silver head and after his walk, he\u2019d come home, wash the bottom of his\nshoes. The bottom of his cane and we only had one bathroom in this apartment in Manhattan\nand I used to desperately say oh pop please come out. I have to go.",
        "A: Right and he walked, he walked me to school every day. And picked me up from school\nevery day.",
        "A: He was in a German way. I think Germans are they\u2019re not as affectionate as Mediterraneans\nso yes he loved me a great deal.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Not at all.",
        "A: Mayers.",
        "A: Mayers bakerei. We also had a restaurant. Now if you guys are since you\u2019re all\nMassachusetts or have been, the size of Pier Four in Boston, that was the size of the restaurant.",
        "A: Anthony\u2019s Pier Four.",
        "A: Yep. And my father since my parents were 44 when I was born, used to show me around the\nrestaurant before he was put in a concentration camp and I would get to a very important antidote\nin this, about this restaurant, if I may.",
        "A: Anidote [ph], yes.",
        "A: Ok. The restaurant was basically across the street from the University of Wurzburg. So a lot\nof students mostly men, would come in to eat. And now this was told to me, you have to\nunderstand now. I was very young. And sometimes my father if one or two of these students\ncouldn\u2019t pay their whole bill he would say you know when you become a famous lawyer or a\ndoctor or architect, you'll pay me back. And it did, may I go into that because it\u2019s a very\nimportant part of the story. We had a very large house. And after my father was put in a\nconcentration camp and the servants had quit because they were not allowed to work for Jews. I\nhad a nanny who quit. So we moved into three little rooms but other Jewish families that were\nbasically evacuated from their homes came to the door. And since we had the room, my mother\nwould tell them to go upstairs and just take some rooms. Well they were like shadows to me.\nBasically you know.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah. We were not evacuated from our home. We left willingly. Well anyway, Kristallnacht\ncame in November of 1938. And I slept in the same bed with my mother and all of a sudden I\nheard all this noise and noise again, we had almost they were castle doors and I heard pounding\nagainst them and then men shouting. And then we had marble steps going up there and I could\nhear, to this day I can hear the boots on the marble steps. Excuse me. (She wipes tears from her\neyes) And I would hear the children crying, the women screaming. I would hear a lot of yelling.\nMY mother took a dresser and pushed it against the door and she held me and she said, Inya,\nwhich is Inge in German, tonight we\u2019re going to die. And I didn\u2019t know what dying was. It, but\nshe was crying and I cried. And we heard glass breaking. And so much going on. And then the\nsun came up and we lived in more routes in what you now would call almost a cul-de-sac.\nThere were just three big urban mansions in this area. And there was a knock on the door and\nsaid Frau Meyer, Frau Meyer (she raises hand in fist to indicate knocking on door) and it was a\nman from across the cul-de-sac and he said they\u2019re gone. But she wasn\u2019t sure so she didn\u2019t move\nthe dresser. But then he convinced her and opened the door and there were dolls and shoes and\nclothes and glass strewn all over.",
        "A: All over the house. And we couldn\u2019t understand why were we left. It was just my mother\nand I left. And I don\u2019t know the time span because again I was six, but my mother found out that\none of the students who my father said you pay me back found out where my mother and I were\nand he stood in front of the door and told them to pass by. So he paid back.",
        "A: Everyone who was there.",
        "A: All the people my mother gave shelter to.",
        "A: My father was in Dachau.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Were in the United States and Palestine.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: He just thought you know as a joke, he knew they wouldn\u2019t come back to pay money. That\nthey\u2019d forget that he had us in college. But whoever this was and we never found out the actual\nperson but we knew there was a Gestapo officer and that\u2019s all we know.",
        "A: We were told you know by other people because the restaurant was closed, naturally. My\nmother had no workers. And the bakery was closed and I\u2019m sorry. (She raises hand to face,\ncrying) I\u2019m sorry.",
        "A: I feel I\u2019ve earned the title survivor. And uh.",
        "A: Why don\u2019t you ask me the questions.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "A: Well again I was told he had lived in that area and he saw the house. I have his diploma from,\nhe is a master baker and I have his diploma hanging up on the wall upstairs. And he saved his\nmoney and at the age of 22, he bought the house, the picture that you saw.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: How I found that out was in 1978 one of our sons was on an exchange here in Switzerland at\nthe University of Freiberg and we went to see him. And I said to my husband, no matter what\nyou do, don\u2019t go on the Autobahn. And then I said you know we should go on the Autobahn. It\u2019s\nfaster. And all of a sudden he stopped and I had fallen asleep and he said Inge look at the sign\nand it says Wurzburg.",
        "A: So I said let\u2019s go. I said maybe I can bury some ghosts. And we went to Wurzburg and I kept\nasking, I speak German. Not very well any more cause it\u2019s been a long time. And I kept saying\nin German, wo ist de strasse Franciscana [ph|",
        "A: Franciscana. And they gave me a street. It wasn\u2019t a street. Then one young German woman\nsaid maybe you mean Hansisgana Gasse [ph], which meant cul-de-sac. And we went there and\nan old man was walking with a cane. And I said to him, did you know a Jewish family named\nMayer. And he pointed to the house. (She raises her hand, pointing) And he said right there,\nthey lived there. The British bombed it. But it was rebuilt to specification and was now an\napartment house.",
        "A: Oh yes. They rebuilt, the whole city was devastated, mostly by the, some American planes,\nbut mostly by the British. And we saw pictures when we went to the city in 2013. It was just\nrubble, just rubble. But the German mentality is you put everything back where it was. And in a\nway it\u2019s good, in a way it\u2019s good. And the people we met then who were younger, who weren\u2019t\neven born, were absolutely wonderful. But 1t was, and somebody asked me. Wow, you must be\ngetting a lot of money from that. And I was notified several years ago, many years ago that the\nstate claimed the property for back taxes, because my father was in the concentration camp and\nnobody paid the taxes.",
        "A: So I got in touch with a firm in New York called claims against the Holocaust and I\u2019m going\nto use language. The man down there said to me Mrs. Protentis you were screwed. That property\nnow this was in about 1980 something. In 1980 something, he said the value of the property is\nabout a million three quarters. And, but you know, not important. It\u2019s not important. I had my\nlife. I had, I live in a country that is absolutely beautiful. I had a wonderful husband and four\nwonderful sons. Fourteen of the best grandchildren. And I will always be grateful to this\ncountry for giving me asylum.",
        "A: And if I had been eligible, if I had been eligible. I had gone to the consulate in Boston.",
        "A: Yeah, the German consulate. I had two little cousins, a girl my age and her brother who was\nmaybe three, two or three. I would never have taken the money. I could see these little hands\ncoming out of the earth saying Inge you\u2019re alive. You\u2019re married, you have children. We have\nno life. We are gone. We can\u2019t leave any memories, even though yours are bad. You have\nmemories in your life. I would never have taken the money. To me it would have been blood\nmoney.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yes. Yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: In a concentration camp. Because after the war my father came to this country and after the\nwar he went to the Red Cross to find out about relatives. It seems the whole extended family\nended up in concentration camps. And \u2014",
        "A: He had a sister who was a teacher and she also perished 1n a concentration camp.",
        "A: Yeah, she looked like a typical teacher. She had a bun (gestures with hands at face to\nindicate bun hairstyle) and she dressed with high neck dresses (gestures with hands to indicate\nneckline of dress), white collars and she always said to me, now when I tell you this, remember it\nInge. Teacher like. And we didn\u2019t see her often though we did see her.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Rosa.",
        "A: Yes. Yeah, seemed to be a very popular name. It\u2019s like Mary, you know.",
        "A: [have no idea.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Very ahead of her time. Very driven. Now since my parents were very wealthy she had a lot\nof jewelry. She had a tiara with stones in it and bracelets. And I remember when they had\ndances, my nanny would let me sit on the steps and I could watch the women. And they had all\nthese beautiful things with green stones and white stones and red stones which I later found out\nwhere diamonds, rubies and emeralds you know.",
        "A: Yeah a lot of bling. And when this prosperous era ended and we were alone, she would wake\nme up in the middle of the night and take me to the roof. Bring a blanket and a pillow. And she\nhad a barrel that she carried and in it she had some tools. And the support beams in the attic were\nmade of wood. And she would dig out holes in the wood, catch the sawdust in the bucket and\nput in jewelry and she\u2019d come over, wake me up. Inge, you\u2019ve got to remember these numbers.\nOne, three, seven. In other words the support post one, three, seven. If anything happens to me,\nyou come here. I made them low. You can reach them. And you don\u2019t tell anybody where you\nget them. And you go to, gave me a name of two families. (Gestures with palm up) And you tell\nthem you\u2019re going to give them this and they should take you in and protect you. And then she\nwould take, she would be there for a long time. And I was cold you know. And then she\u2019d take\nthe sawdust and flush it down the toilet. And at times, we went to Gestapo headquarters (/ooks\ndown) and she took one of the jewels and put it in her hand and inquired about her husband, my\nfather. And afterwards she would shake the hand of the Gestapo officer and the jewel would be\ngone. And \u2014",
        "A: She never told me. But my father survived and was released so something must have worked.",
        "A: (coughs) Excuse me.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Ihave no idea. The Gestapo man who obviously stood in front of our door, must have known.\nIt\u2019s hard to say because there were other incidents. My parents had, my father had a huge library.\nWith a lot of (gestures with hand to indicate size) used to go around and on the bottom he used\nto have a shelf for my books. And one day it was during the day the Hitler Youth came in. They\ntook all the books including mine, put them in a pile in the middle of the cul-de-sac and burned\nthem. And my mother said to me, those are the ideas of men that they want to destroy. And I\nwatched the flames and I could see (gestures with hand, moving upward) heads of men coming\nout of the flames. And then I saw my books being burned. And they were animals coming out of\nthose books.",
        "A: Yes. And so I became when I came to this country I became an avid reader. And very\ninterested in a lot of things but \u2014",
        "A: And then now I don\u2019t know how far I'll get with this part of the story. My mother and I for\nsome reason were put in a camp. Now it wasn\u2019t a camp. It was more like a warehouse. And they\nhad bunks in there and it was all women and little girls. And one day some Gestapo officers\ncame in with some Gestapo women. And they picked out some little girls, including me. And I\nas either four or five. And they took us outside and I was so happy to be outside. I thought we\nwere going to go play. And they took us to this big house, who, it was full of Nazi soldiers.\n(Closes eyes) I\u2019m sorry.\n(filming stops)",
        "A: As sex toys.",
        "A: (nods head, yes) Yes. And my mother said to me when they took me, she said keep yourself\nclean, keep yourself pretty. Don\u2019t scream, don\u2019t cry. And I think she knew what was going to\nhappen. And after a few I don\u2019t\u2019 know the time span, I, I they came and they said the Mayer girl\nis not supposed to be here. And they took me and they brought me back to my mother. And she\nnever asked and questioned. She just wrapped me in a blanket and held me. (uses Kleenex to\nwipe nose) And a lot of the little girls who screamed and cried disappeared. (coughs) And, but I\nwas going to make it out of there. I was going to get out of there even if I had to crawl through\nthe door. I was going to get out of there. But they came and brought me back to my mother.\nAnd I kept washing myself, I kept washing myself. And I had this compulsion to stay clean and I\nwas obsessive compulsive as I grew up about cleanliness, even my house. I\u2019m better now but\n(smiles) in personal cleanliness and \u2014",
        "A: Young men.",
        "A: Yeah. And actually one of them came to our house after we were released from this whatever\nit was. Asking forme. Asked my mother. Where Ingeborg was. And I heard his voice. And I\nhid in acloset. And I don\u2019t know what my mother said to him. I\u2019m sorry. (emotional pause,\ncries) Even as a little girl. And I was not going to let this ruin my life and I was going to be\n(wipes tears from eyes) best of them in school. And since we came over, two weeks before my\nseventh birthday and my parents didn\u2019t put me into school until the fall and we came over in\nFebruary. I was like a year and a half behind, but I skipped half the second grade, half the\nseventh grade and half of a high school grade. And I actually graduated before I was 18. And \u2014",
        "A: (shakes head no) No. None, none whatsoever none whatsoever. And actually I was told\nafterwards too that they arrested my father, not for being a Jew, but he was in the caf\u00e9 and where\nhe went to the, they didn\u2019t call it a pub, they called it the house.",
        "A: Hofbrauhaus. Hofbrauhaus. They say that Hitler is going to ruin Germany. So he was\narrested as a political prisoner. And \u2014",
        "A: To a degree. To a degree. Not you know they kept a kosher house and but my father didn\u2019t\ngo to synagogue that often. When he came to the United States he went more often. And would\nask me to come cause he wanted to show me off that he was older and had a little girl, you know.",
        "A: I never told him.",
        "A: I never told them. I never told them. I told when I was sixteen, it old the doctor and he wanted\nto tell my parents and I begged him not to. I said I don\u2019t want them to know.",
        "A: (nods head yes) And after I met Sam who 1s not Jewish.",
        "A: He\u2019s very Greek. Did you ever see the movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding? Well that\u2019s I was\nwhat the male was in that movie. That they were so lively and so loving and Sam said Inge I\ndon\u2019t\u2019 want to know what happened. I like, being and when we met, but he encouraged me to go\ninto therapy which I did and I was in therapy for years. And told everything there, and well, not\neverything. But a lot. There are some things, I just get to a point where I think I\u2019m opening a\ndoor and I can\u2019t go on. And I don\u2019t know what it is. And I know I remember one part where\nsomebody put me in a box and covered me with blankets and put the cover down. And that\u2019s all\nI remember. I mean I can\u2019t go any further, but I\u2019m claustrophobic. And \u2014",
        "A: My children know all about it. Well, know as much as I want to tell them.",
        "A: My sons are the most incredible human beings, next to their father. They are very protective.\nAnd they are, they\u2019re just love, they love. They\u2019re big guys. You know two of them are six,\nthree. They\u2019re all college graduates. I made sure of that. And my grandchildren are even more\nprotective of me. Five of them have, as a matter of fact the fifth one is coming home\nWednesday. Have been to Israel on the birth right program. And Nicholas, Ryan, Alicia, Rachel\nand Justin are the last ones so far and they\u2019re very proud of their Jewish heritage. Yet, none of\nmy sons married Jewish women. And I had the most fantastic daughters in law. Two of them\ncalled me and they wanted to know whether they should come over and here and hold my hand\ntoday.",
        "A: (nods head yes)",
        "A: They know because I tried to tell them you know that the people in Germany now are not the\npeople that committed these atrocities. They\u2019re dead. They\u2019re gone. That not to have hard\nfeelings against the people there now. But they\u2019re not quite into thinking that way.",
        "A: (nods head yes) But I\u2019ve learned to protect myself. I\u2019ve learned to protect myself. I\u2019m very\nthick headed. I\u2019m very but I also know there are situations that should be avoided. I know we\u2019ve\ntraveled a great deal and I see that you know there are things going on in good countries that are\nnot healthy. That again I say I\u2019m grateful for this country. And no matter what is said\npolitically, America is great. It doesn\u2019t have to be remade great, it is great. And it should\nwelcome people who want to come and make a life for themselves here. I think my coming to\nthis country, me and my husband and having our sons. We always told them since they were\nlittle, you weren\u2019t born just to take. You were born to give back. And our oldest son is with the\nFBI. Our next son started a program for under privileged children in high school. And even\nstarted a step program so that they could go to college. Our third son is a microbiologist and he\ndoes as a matter of fact this weekend did the Pan Mass ride for cancer. Our youngest son is a\npsychotherapist for the mentally retarded. So",
        "A: Yes. And they\u2019re giving back so I think you know there was a reason for my surviving and\nmeeting the wonderful man I call my husband.",
        "A: My mother\u2019s son, my brother Emil. He couldn\u2019t get a visa to the United States so she sent\nhim to Palestine. What was then Palestine. She sent my sister to her brother in New York who\nwas a baker because they were using the Jewish girls as sex objects.",
        "A: Was Betty.",
        "A: I\u2019m trying to think. If we came over in 39. Maybe 37, 38. Cause we came over in 39.",
        "A: [still don\u2019t want to talk about.",
        "A: I was three.",
        "A: I did for this reason. We had a German shepherd dog, surprise, surprise. And I was playing\noutside in the cul-de-sac with him. And a black car pulled up. And I don\u2019t know whether it was\ntwo or three men in black coats with black hats. Came over to me and asked me what my name\nwas. And I told them. And they asked me where my father was. And I said I don\u2019t know. I\nthink he\u2019s in his office. And then they came out with my father who was handcuffed. And they\nsaid and my mother was running after them. And she said where are you taking him and they\nsaid don\u2019t worry. He\u2019ll be home in a few days. That was three and a half years that he was in\nDachau and Buchenwald. And that\u2019s why I remember it because I was sort of involved.",
        "A: Pardon me.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No I didn\u2019t because I was a three year old child.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yes. Once. My mother said they\u2019re moving papa from Dachau to Buchenwald. And I found\nout that the train is going to stop in Wurzburg in the middle of the night. So she woke me up and\nwe went to the train station and you could see the prisoners through the windows of the train.\nAnd there came my father and he put his hand out and my mother lifted me up and I kissed him\n(gestures with both hands raised) through the glass. That was the only time I saw him.",
        "A: We left Germany in January of 1939.",
        "A: Yes. First of all well they move pewter, there was pewter here. (gestures and looks off\ncamera to her right) And some pewter downstairs. That vase that the flowers are in. I was told\nby an antique dealer it was a soup tureen that belonged to the King of Prussia. My parents had\nthis furniture which was I hated it because sometime had a duster and had all these curves. This\nwas in the United States though.",
        "A: So about a room and a half of they\u2019re called Biedermeier and baroque furniture. And my\nmother took me down to the pier where they were packing these big crates. And we walked\ndown and they said oh Frau Meyer. My parents obviously were known. And they said 1s this\nyour things. Yes and they talked for a few minutes and he said, whatever the other guy\u2019s name,\nFritz, Hans. We haven\u2019t eaten yet and we take a long time to eat, about four or five hours. So\nwe ll see you later, which was telling her if there\u2019s other things you want to get within four to\nfive hours, so she hailed a cab and we went back to the house, got some things. I don\u2019t remember\nwhat. And brought them back.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t you know, you know these are things that\npuzzle me. Where did these things happen but I was too young.",
        "A: No. No. I was actually glad she was gone.",
        "A: She was weird. (/aughs) She was not to my liking. She didn\u2019t teach me things. it\u2019s, give you\none example. It\u2019s probably ridiculous but I had this little table with two chairs. One day she puts\nthis orange thing on the table. And says here, here\u2019s an orange. I\u2019d never seen an orange before.\nI tried bouncing it and didn\u2019t, I tried rolling it. Figuring make noise. It didn\u2019t make noise.",
        "A: So then I said there must be a reason that she gave it to me. So I dug my thumb in and I saw\nsomething come up and juice came out. I thought, it\u2019s a drink. (points finger) And I started\npeeling it and then got the juice all over myself, all over the table (motions with hands) but I\ndiscovered how to peel an orange.",
        "A: She never told me it was, it was self-exploration.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Did not know, no. I had orange but it was already peeled, but this was the first time I was\ngiven an orange (indicates with hands round shape of orange). So no she was weird.",
        "A: Yes. One of the reasons that I think I\u2019ve always tended to sweets, cookies and stuff like that\nwas every time I fell he\u2019d say here darling, have some whipped cream on a cookie. And you\u2019ll be\nbetter you know. And yes it was a very pretty bakery. My father was a master baker and he\ndecorated things that were like a fairy tale. They were fairy tales. I mean castles with moats\naround them and days and days of work. Beautiful things. And they tasted good too. And you\nknow he made me special things for special days and I didn\u2019t even want to bite them because\nthey were so pretty. But it\u2019s the caf\u00e9 I remember more. He would have the nanny dress me and\nhe\u2019d take me around the caf\u00e9 and say this is my daughter. You know. She\u2019s well this was, I was\nyoung. I was three. And he\u2019d introduce me and specially to ladies. And the older ladies had hats\non you know. (gestures with hands, hats) And I remember that more and it was beautiful table\ncloths and silverware and plates and you know it was so pretty and flowers in the middle. And \u2014",
        "A: Yes, she was also the brain of the business.",
        "A: Yes. My father was tremendously innovative in business but my mother was the director and\nI think that\u2019s where I got my inspiration from. Yes.",
        "A: Pardon.",
        "A: She would, she would give orders and people would listen. And I was, she was, listening to a\nwoman. So when I got married and had four sons, I said to myself, well since I\u2019m the only\nfemale, I says guys before you start first grade you\u2019re going to learn how to make your bed.\nWell they did. It was a sloppy mess but they made it. They learned to cook basics. One would\nset the table, one would clear the table, one would sweep the floor. And put the wash away. We\nwere an equal opportunity house. And \u2014",
        "A: It started with Mama and I actually trained very good husbands. (/aughs)",
        "A: And they were wonderful when they were little boys. You know they, for mother\u2019s day they\u2019d\nbring me boxes of pansies and they would pick dandelions. And give them to me. And it was, it\nwas a good melding of mother and sons.",
        "A: No. Well. I married Sam when I was 19 and my sister was 18 years older and she had a hard\ntime having children. She just had one daughter who was born handicapped who just died last\nDecember. And there again my sons went down to New York to visit her. They took care of all\nher affairs, her papers. They made sure that she got the proper service before she died. They got\nhospice for her. She had pancreatic cancer.",
        "A: For my niece my sister\u2019s daughter. And they were very good to her. And I went down several\ntimes but you know it was very difficult because she was like my little sister. My father opened a\nbakery in New York. And after school I would go over there, pick up Evelyn. That was her\nname. And bring her home. And she had, she was born premature and she had several operations\nso she had a body cast. And I used to bring her into the house and take care of her. And so she\nwas like my little sister and it was hard when I lost her. And I called her like a couple of times a\nweek. And when she was younger she always used to come up here for part of the summer. And\nshe always came up for Thanksgiving. My sons would go and pick her up and bring her back.\nAnd even my youngest granddaughter , Dreslin who\u2019s nine. She remembers Evelyn would send\nher $2 for her birthday and a card. So this year I sent her a card with $2 and I you know.",
        "A: My sister died at the age of 69 from liver cancer. And so Evelyn lived alone for a long time.\nAs close as we could be because our lives were so different.",
        "A: She was, actually she was a maid for wealthy Jewish families.",
        "A: Manhattan, mm hmm, upper Manhattan.",
        "A: It\u2019s, that (coughs). Excuse me.",
        "A: Emil never came.",
        "A: He died in 1969 the same year as my mother. He was obese. For a while, he was in the\nIsraeli army, the Hagenah and but he, let\u2019s put it this way. He was spoiled rotten. Like when a\nbunch of them would go to the Alps hiking, his idea of hiking was paying other guys to pull him\nup the mountain.",
        "A: And I never knew him. I never met him. He left when I was three. However, my sister called\nme one day and she said I just received a call from someone who said they were with Emil\u2019s\ndaughter in Manhattan and she was visiting. I said so what did you do. She said she hung up. I\nfigured it was, it\u2019s a joke. So I said the next time they call give them my telephone number. So\nthey called me and I went down to New York and met them. And they came up here. and so this\nwas my brother\u2019s oldest daughter and her husband. And so we went to Israel three times and we\nmet the whole family (gesturing with hands) and toured Israel. And now my five grandchildren\nwho have been to Israel have stayed with my grandnephew Nitzan. He built a house with one\nroom just for our family.",
        "A: Yeah. (clears throat)",
        "A: Yeah and he, he is so funny. And he\u2019s a riot and we are so close. He\u2019s like our fifth son. And\nhe\u2019s 44. He taught our oldest grandson Nicholas how to play soccer. He\u2019s been here a few times\nand there was one story very funny. They came here one year. He and his wife. And they said\nthey were traveling with another Israeli company, couple. And said ok so one night he said Sam\nwe have to go to Boston and pick up or friends and as they\u2019re walking out the door, they were\ncoming down from Canada. I said where are they staying. He says here. Surprise, surprise. So\nluckily at that time our oldest son Russell was living in Brockton. So I sent Jeffrey who was\nhome on winter break and Scott to his house to sleep, changed the sheets.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Very much so. We came over in February from Germany. We left the port of Bremen and\nwe had a cabin. My mother and I never left the beds because we were deathly seasick. One time\nwe were feeling a little better and we had decided to go to the dining room and we were\nwatching the other patrons eat. And my mother says to me, look they\u2019re eating food that we feed\nto the pigs. They were eating corn on the cob.",
        "A: No. So we sat there for like ten minutes, went back to our cabins and got sick.",
        "A: You have opened another book. When my, my mother kept saying we had cousins down\nsouth. When my sister died.",
        "A: No, my sister died (closes eyes)",
        "A: I\u2019m trying to think what year she died. No my brother died in 69 and my mother died in 69.\nMy sister died wait a minute I have to figure my daughter in law\u2019s age. My daughter in law is 62.\nShe died when she turned 30, so 32 years ago is when my sister died.",
        "A: So I went down with my son Paul and my niece asked me to go through her papers. And so\nPaul and I went through them and I found a letter from a Jamie Miller from Memphis Tennessee.",
        "A: Jamie Miller mm hm, and said I do genealogy and I believe, this was addressed to my sister\nthat you\u2019re related. And the letter was two years old.",
        "A: And with it was a genealogy chart. And I\u2019m saying ehh. But Paul pulled the stuff out of the\ntrash basket (/ifts hand in fist) and says take it home. We\u2019ll look at it. And when we got home,\nScott was home on winter break or spring break from college. He went to U Mass Amherst and\nhe loves research. So I says Scott look at this and see what you can come up with. And he\nlooked at 1t and he said mom the closest I can come 1s that there\u2019s a family named Kamien in\nCleveland, Mississippi.",
        "A: Kamien. That are related to you and I said bet you those are the cousins. Now this man put\nup the money for all of us to come over and sponsored us. At the time I think you had to put up a\nthousand dollars a person and leave it in the bank for five years. So that",
        "A: The immigrants would not become a burden to this country. He never knew us, he never\nknew us.",
        "A: Never met. Anyway I pick up the phone and I say I'd like Kamien in Cleveland, Mississippi\nand the operator said to me, there\u2019s a Kamien\u2019s department store. I said put me in touch with\nthem. So a woman answered and she says Kamien\u2019s. I said this sounds weird but I\u2019m calling\nfrom the Boston area. And I think I\u2019m related to the owner of the store. And she said well\nhoney child, Ill put you in touch with the president of the company. I.A. Kamien. And I spoke\nto him and he said oh my aunt, she has all the information. Her name is Rosebud Davis, not\nRosa, Rosebud. And I called her and it seems my maternal grandfather had eight brothers and\nsisters that came to the southern United States in the early 1900s. And I have relatives all over\nthis country where I thought I had nobody.",
        "A: So we invited Rosebud and her husband up here and we went down south and met them. And\nit was, this Kamien that sponsored us and also said he had jobs for us, which was not true. He\ndid. But he was also an amazing man. He hired the first black in Mississippi to work to manage\nhis story and it was a woman and he gave land to both the Baptist and Methodist churches. And,\nand as a matter of fact, at Sam\u2019s 90\" birthday which was June 4\" of this year, Jamie Miller came\nup here with her husband and her brother came from Los Angeles. And \u2014",
        "A: Yeah cleaned the bottom of his cane and the soles of his shoes.",
        "A: No, it was my mother\u2019s. It was the Reichenberg family.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, you\u2019re right. Yes, you\u2019re right.",
        "A: It was eight of his siblings that came to the United States, the southern part.",
        "A: This Kamien who sponsored us was married to my grandfather\u2019s sister. (coughs) And so\nthat\u2019s she had married a Reichenberg and --",
        "A: My grandfather came with my father. Afterwards. I can\u2019t remember how many months later\nbut it was just before Germany invaded Poland.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Ok. I had told my doctor that Lauren was doing this project on my family through the\nHolocaust museum.",
        "A: Mm, hmm. And we couldn\u2019t understand how my father a German Jewish man was released\nfrom two of the worst concentration camps in Europe. So he said when he was in college, he read\nthis book and it was titled the Extermination of the European Jew. Now I started calling around\ndifferent libraries. None of them have it. But the Brockton, the main library had one copy. And I\nwent down and I got it and I read it, very difficult book to read cause it had so many notes and\nother things. (gestures with hand) But I found out that the Nazis decided the Jewish men who\nhad fought in World War I and won a medal. My father won the Iron Cross, which was like the\nDistinguished Service Cross, would be given more liberties. And so I guess that\u2019s why he was\nreleased. That\u2019s the only thing I could think of.",
        "A: World War, yeah.",
        "A: By whom?",
        "A: The Destruction of European Jewry. I can\u2019t remember the, I have, went online, I can use a\ncomputer.",
        "A: I went online and I got two paperback copies, sent one to Lauren and I have it upstairs.",
        "A: That gave me that information.",
        "A: Never, never. He had a lot of scars on his back. I guess that was from beatings. But he never\ntalked about it. And to tell you the truth I didn\u2019t want to hear him. I. I had a very horrific\nchildhood. I had and I had, I didn\u2019t know I was such a pusher as a child, but I was. But I was\ndetermined to survive and to bring some good into this world.",
        "A: A pusher to survive. And I wasn\u2019t going to let anybody destroy my will. And when I came to\nthis country and saw this unbelievable freedom, like we lived in our first apartment, we lived\nacross the street from the school. And there was a playground and I saw these kids keep throwing\na ball through a round thing. After in the evening I went across the street with a little ball. And I\nkept practicing throwing the ball through the hoop. Because I wanted to be like them. Well I\nended up being captain of the basketball team in high school.",
        "A: And I was in all the accelerated (wipes eyes with tissue) classes but then I was time, I got\naccepted by City College of New York. My father wouldn\u2019t let me go. He said women don\u2019t\nneed an education. But I did go. I applied for a job to [unintelligible]. And I went at night. I\nwent from work to CCNY. (points finger for emphasis) Then from CCNY, took the train to the\nBronx, was up til 3:00, 4:00 studying. Got up 5:30 to go to work. Had a breakdown, couldn\u2019t do\nit anymore.",
        "A: And, but I completed one semester. Better than nothing.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: Endicott Johnson. They were a shoe company. And I was secretary to the treasurer. And\nlearned a lot about the stock market. And Sam was training to be a road salesman. That\u2019s how\nwe met.",
        "A: I'd like to take a break too.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yes. But, I was afraid of him. I didn\u2019t recognize him. He had turned gray. He was very thin.\nAnd I held back and I couldn\u2019t hug him at the beginning because I thought he was another man\nwho was a threat to me.",
        "A: No, to the apartment. He came to our apartment.",
        "A: Stranger. A stranger. Because when he left, he wasn\u2019t fat but he was you know a little over\nnormal. He had, my father had red hair and a red moustache and a goatee. (gestures with hand\ngoatee) And now this skinny person who\u2019s all gray, I didn\u2019t know who he was.",
        "A: Geez, that\u2019s hard to tell. All I know is he was here for two, in this country for two days and\nwe lived in Manhattan then in the 80s, 98\" street, something like that (gestures with hand) And\nhe went into a bakery and was a German Jewish section. And he said my name is Max Mayer.\nI\u2019m a master baker and I want a job. And this was two days after, and he got it.",
        "A: And very hard worker.",
        "A: I can\u2019t really pin a time on it. You know but I was the apple of his eye. And the Jewish high\nholidays, he would have, my mother\u2019d buy me a new dress. You know she was, and he\u2019d go\n(holds palm of hand up) and he\u2019d go to the synagogue and you know in New York, at that time,\nyou know this is I hate to say it a long time ago. Children could walk the streets safely. So my\nfather would go to the services early and then I\u2019d go about 10, 11:00 all dressed up, walk to the\nsynagogue. And he\u2019d look back to see me and he\u2019d bring me and sit me next to him. This was so\nwonderful cause you know he was strutting. However, at the age of 11, I developed and that year\nmy mother bought me a white dress. And I did my usual. Went to the synagogue, not thinking\nabout anything. And my father looked back, saw me, escorted me next, sat me next to him. And\nall of a sudden, Jewish men call what they do daven. They say their prayers out loud and they\nare davening the crescendo rose. Because they saw now I was developed. The rabbi comes\ndown from what they call the bimah or the platform. And he asks my father and me to come to\nthe back of the synagogue. And he says Max your daughter has to sit with the women. She\u2019s a\nwoman now. He says my daughter is my equal and she will sit next to me. And if you don\u2019t\napprove I\u2019m leaving this synagogue and he took off his shawl. And he took me by my hand and\nhe walked out and joined another synagogue. Now so that made a big impression on me, that\nwell I always thought of myself as his equal. You know. I was never I never felt different until I\nwanted to go to college. Then, then there was a conflict, but as I was growing up, we would have\nconversations about everything and he respected my opinion. Even at the age of 12 and 13 or\n14. And I respected his.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. But I loved my mother more. But for this very reason. I owed my life to her,\neven as young as I was, I realized it. And with the jewelry and the bribery and going to Gestapo\nheadquarters and my mother, I usually had a hard-boiled egg and toast for breakfast. She would\npeel the egg, slice the toast (gestures slicing toast) in little bite sized pieces. This is when I was\n18 you know. And it was a love hate relationship. I don\u2019t know how I can explain it you know\nother than that. There were things I\u2019d rather not go into about that.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Right. Right. And yeah and you know I would have conversations with both of them but I\nnever recall having a conversation with the three of us. It was always me and one of them.",
        "A: Inever saw much love. No, I didn\u2019t. It\u2019s not like Sam and I always kissing you know. Even\nat this stage of our life. No, I never saw much love between them. But yes, they both, they both\nadored me.",
        "A: Never.",
        "A: Never. Never. The only thing my mother ever said is America is the most beautiful country\nin the world. You can be anything you want. This is the land of opportunity. But they never\nspoke about what went on. As a matter of fact I didn\u2019t even know about the property. I didn\u2019t\nknow anything. They never told me anything. I didn\u2019t\u2019 know that my mother\u2019s father had eight\nbrothers and sisters that came to the United States in the early 1900s. I knew nothing. I was,\nwhen people ask me. It\u2019s so hard to understand, it\u2019s hard for me to understand. I also couldn\u2019t\nunderstand why she didn\u2019t bring my brother over from Israel. And I asked questions but if you\nknow me for a little while, I ask a lot of questions. But I wasn\u2019t given any answer. I was given\nevasive answers. And but you accept them, you know.",
        "A: He lived with us for a while. That\u2019s why he was so clean. I had to learn to control my\nbladder. Cause he monopolized the bathroom.",
        "A: And then for a little while he went into a nursing home and I recall visiting him. And then\nwhen I was nine he died.",
        "A: Yes, yes, So \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. You know I tell this to my children. I want them to know as\nmuch as possible about me. And Sam tells them about him (gestures with hand). And his\nSpartan Greek heritage. Because I was left with so many (gestures with hand at chest) blank\nspaces. I can\u2019t answer, I want to but I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: But I don\u2019t know. And Ursula, my, we went to Germany on the survivors\u2019 group. She\u2019s the\nretired OB GYN. She went to Munich and found out so much about my father that I didn\u2019t\nknow.",
        "A: I don\u2019t want to tell you. My brother Emil was born. I can\u2019t remember exactly the year but\nlet\u2019s just say 1910 (gestures with hand). He was born in April of 1910 and they were married in\nFebruary of 1910. I wish I would have known this when they were alive. I could have\nblackmailed them. Don\u2019t put that (points at interviewer)",
        "A: And you know there are so many blanks and she was able to give me the city he was born in.\nThere were only seven Jews there when he left and went to Wurzburg. How ambitious he was to\nbuy this building at the age of 22. How well respected he was and obviously by the students at\nthe university and even the packers down at the pier, who packed my mother\u2019s furniture. They\nknew her on sight. And so there are a lot of spaces in my life and I have no information on. I\nwish I did but I don\u2019t.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. [had to figure everything out for myself. I learned to play basketball. I learned English.\nThere was a teacher when I went to first grade and I was old. I was seven and a half. And she\nindicated to me that she wanted me to stay after school every day. And I didn\u2019t understand her\nbut I figured it, to teach me English. For a year. Every day this Polish teacher taught me\nEnglish. And I credit her with so much for and also in teaching me the language, making me\naware of things 1n science, in the animal world and she taught me well. Halloween when she hid\npennies. I always found the most of them.",
        "A: Yes. Mrs. Shelisinsky.",
        "A: Shelisinsky.",
        "A: In Manhattan.",
        "A: Yes. Well now wait a minute. Let me think now. Yeah I started school in Manhattan, but\nthen we moved to the Bronx but I can\u2019t remember what year. We moved to the Bronx, maybe\nafter two years. But by that time I was really well versed in the English language. As a matter of\nfact I became my parents\u2019 interpreter.",
        "A: German.",
        "A: Yes. Yeah, that\u2019s why I was on one of the committees that was, here in Brockton was the\nlinguistic, the immersion of children from foreign countries into a second language class. And I\nsaid I didn\u2019t\u2019 think it was necessary that it was a waste of money. And the superintendent of\nschool and I were like this. (gestures with fingers crossed) So the woman who was in charge,\nthe bilingual program said oh you cannot imagine how hard it is for a child who comes from a\nforeign country, doesn\u2019t know a word of English. And goes into a class where only English is\nspoken. And the superintendent of schools is sitting next to me smiling. He says I\u2019d like, I'd like\nInge Protentis to discuss this with you. I can\u2019t remember her name. But I knew she hated me\nafter this. I said I\u2019m one of those children, came from Germany. I went into a classroom. I had\nno idea what the teacher wanted. She pointed. I sat. She said get (gestures with finger pointed\nupwards) up, I got up. She said when it\u2019s time to go home, she showed me to put on her coat.\nAnd I said and I learned English and I skipped three classes. And graduated before I was 18,\neven though I was a year and a half behind. So after that the woman wouldn\u2019t talk to me. I mean\nI understand it\u2019s her job and I understand that with some children it probably is very necessary.\nSpecially if they\u2019re older. But I still think immersion into the language totally you learn quickly.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: Yes. The ship stopped rocking from side to side for quite a while and my mother said Inge\nget dressed in your best dress. We\u2019re going to go upstairs to the deck. And I did and we went\nupstairs and it was crowded with people. I was like you could hear a pin drop. You would hear a\nwoman sobbing. Every once in a while. And it was lined, you know my mother pushed me to\nthe front. And I couldn\u2019t\u2019 understand what there was about this big stone lady that made people\ncry. Until I knew it was the Statue of Liberty.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I assume so but there were also Americans on the ship. It was a huge ocean\nliner called the Bremen.",
        "A: Bremen, SS",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. Now here\u2019s the amazing thing. Our room steward, you usually give them something. At\nthe end of the voyage that day we were at the Statue of Liberty. He brought us a huge fruit\nbasket. Yes. And we hadn\u2019t eaten anything in five days. Yeah, but yeah and I told this, when\nI\u2019ve spoken at the schools. I\u2019ve told the children they cannot imagine. They cannot imagine the\nfeeling that I had later on when I realized what that big stone lady meant. And of course they all\nknew. They said oh it\u2019s the Statue of Liberty. And I said yes, but it\u2019s more than just a statute. It\nhas so much meaning. It means you have freedom. It means you know that no one is watching\nyou, that no one is judging you on where you go to church or synagogue. Or you know what\ncountry you come from. It means that you are free, free American. And yeah, that moment will\nalways stay with me.",
        "A: Yes, my uncle. My uncle who originally \u2014",
        "A: Ludwig. Good memory. Ludwig met us at the pier, yes. And we were driving to his\napartment and, through Times Square and I said what\u2019s wrong with these people. They\u2019re not\npulling their shades down. They have all the lights on. Cause in Germany you had to pull the\nshades and keep it dark and I said I don\u2019t see anybody walking with a Star of David on their\nsleeve. And my uncle was trying to explain to me that they don\u2019t have to.",
        "A: We stayed with him for about a week and then we got an apartment.",
        "A: Our own apartment. Now here\u2019s my mother ok. Most of her jewelry went to save my father,\nwhich was a very good cause. But I saw her putting a couple of things into a cotton cloth which\nshe put into a teapot which she put the teapot into a big pot and the big pot into a bigger pot. We\nget to Manhattan and there are the customs agents. She got it out of Germany. She comes down.\nShe says let me help. She starts carrying the linens up, pillows up, pots up. And the pot\n(gestures, pointing with both hands) and in the pot was there wasn\u2019t much left. If you have time\nat the end I\u2019Il show you the pin.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: The jewelry was. Yes. So she got it past the Germans and got it past the customs agent.\nThat\u2019s why I said she was, she was daring and she was brave and she was smart.",
        "A: Mm hmm",
        "A: As far as I know because we lived on our own.",
        "A: Well one and a half rooms, but you know she had to buy beds and kitchen set and things like\nthat. Yeah. But and I was amazed that we had just like five rooms. Where\u2019s the rest of the\nrooms? This is it.",
        "A: No but you know.",
        "A: He opened a bakery. He opened a bakery in the west Bronx and he was, you know the baker.\nMy mother worked at the country. My sister and my brother in law and as a matter of fact, our\nbest friends, Charlie and Thelma Cartsteen, her sister in law lived in New York and when I told\nher the story, she goes the Meyer bakery. We used to stand on line every Sunday to get in there.\nAnd I said yeah, yeah.",
        "A: He did, but he was older now and it was getting harder for him and there were little family\nsquabbles you know. So eventually they closed the bakery. It was a huge success but my father\nmade it a success, not just was he a master baker. His breads and rolls and you know were out of\nthis world. They were light and fluffy and you know so it\u2019s not just cakes which were works of\nart. It was the whole thing.",
        "A: I did work there. Yes.",
        "A: I, I was behind the counter. I sliced rye bread on the slicer. Yeah I weighed the stuff and\nlooked up on the chart how much it was.",
        "A: English. Oh no, I spoke only English. Yeah.",
        "A: Well my teachers told me at that time, City College New York was very hard to get into. It\nwas very selective. You had to have, I can\u2019t remember if it was all A\u2019s and maybe a couple B\u2019s.\nBut I had, I was an all A student. I got a B once in something, can\u2019t remember. It was probably\nart, cause I\u2019m a lousy artist. Anyway, and they encouraged me to go. And they asked me what I\nwanted to do and I said, I wanted to be a scientist like Madame Curie. I wanted to find a cure for\nsomething. So they helped me you know fill out the forms to City College. I got accepted and\nlike I said it was competitive. Right now all you need is a high school diploma to get in now.\nAnd but it costs money just like a state school and my father said I don\u2019t have the money and\nyou\u2019re a woman and women don\u2019t need an education. And I said so why did you let me go to\nschool. I mean we had big arguments. I said well why did we have all these discussions. You\nsaid you respected my opinion. But it didn\u2019t work so anyway, I got the job. I met Sam so it\nworked out.\n(cut for a second)\n(file 2 \u2014RG.50.030.0086.01.02; duration: 05:53)",
        "A: Wait a minute.\n(arranging filming)",
        "A: This is a pin that was my mother\u2019s mother\u2019s in Germany.....It\u2019s set in a platinum metal and\nit\u2019s the only piece of jewelry I have left of my mother\u2019s.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. And she brought very little because she used it for a good cause.",
        "A: For my father.",
        "A: This is my passport from Nazi Germany to the United States.",
        "A: It\u2019s my mother\u2019s and mine because I was a minor. I went on her passport.",
        "A: (she turns page of passport)",
        "A: The red J (points) stands for Jude, Jew. And it gives names and the Reichstag which was the\ngovernment then.",
        "A: (turns page and points) This is a picture of my mother (points to picture on left) and me\n(points to picture on right) at the time when we came over, which was in January of 1939. And\nthis just tells I\u2019m written in here and in both our names they inserted the name Sara which we\ndidn\u2019t have middle names.",
        "A: (turns page)",
        "A: Yes. (points) on both that page and the previous page and again you have the eagle with the\nSwastika and the date that the passport was issued.",
        "A: No the rest, except in the back which is taped, the blank that if you\u2019d like to see a picture of\nwhat was my parent\u2019s home.",
        "A: (Puts passport down and holds black and white photograph of house) This was my parent\u2019s\nhome. And \u2014",
        "A: The whole building.",
        "A: Yes, it was like an urban castle and it was bombed by the British and then my husband and I\nwent back to Germany. We saw an older man. This was 20 years ago and I asked him whether he\nknew a Jewish family named Meyer. And he walked with a cane and he picked up his cane and\nhe pointed to this house and said they lived over there. The building was bombed by the British.\nBut the city and the country rebuilt it to specification. And it\u2019s now an apartment building.",
        "A: Yes. Immediately.",
        "A: No, couldn\u2019t.",
        "A: (Holds another black and white photograph of people) That\u2019s my mother and father and my\nhusband and I, 20 some years ago.",
        "A: I mean I\u2019m sorry, 60 years ago and I was just starting my pregnancy with my oldest son.",
        "A: In the 50s, early 50s. They were born in 54.",
        "A: In Brooklyn.",
