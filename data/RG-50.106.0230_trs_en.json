Those who weren\u2019t killed immediately were\ntransported away and only five or ten percent of the Jews of the town remained. Father remained\nbasically. Father, father was alive only because he was transporting the dead bodies. Anyway, in\nthe time after that we knew that we had to disappear. So a lot of time the men of the family,\nspent a lot of time trying to find hiding places. And they did. On the day of the second expulsion,\nthe German word is Auslintung [ph].

        "Q: In the countryside?",
        "A: Yeah. Father stayed in town because my uncle, his best friend, was married to my mother\u2019s\nsister so he said I can\u2019t go with you. I have to wait for him. He was out of town and was\nsupposed to come back that evening. And did indeed come back there. But father sent us off. The\nbest friend did indeed come back that evening. But by that time the town was already\nsurrounded and he couldn\u2019t get out.",
        "Q: Did he survive that?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Oh he did not survive?",
        "A: No, that was the last time I saw him.",
        "Q: Oh my. How did your mother hear about this? Did she find out right away?",
        "A: She found out a few weeks later through the policeman friend. We let him know that we were\nin hiding, where we were. And he came by and told mother that he was taken away. With his\nbest friend.",
        "Q: Do you know where they were taken? Or you don\u2019t know.",
        "A: No. From what my older cousin who is no longer alive told me they were taken to a small\ntown nearby and shot. He heard that again from the policeman. My mother didn\u2019t tell me.\nMother knew but she didn\u2019t tell me until very much later. As far as, what she tried to maintain is\nthe idea that we don\u2019t know where he is. We hope he\u2019! be back.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "Q: Tell me about the family that you were hiding with. Do you have any memories of them?",
        "A: Yes. There were several places that hiding places were prepared, but when push came to\nshove most of them didn\u2019t want us. So apparently the penalties for hiding Jews was severe. And\nmost of them didn\u2019t want to take the chance which 1s again understandable. So of all the places\nthat we had prepared, none of them worked out. So eventually we went to a place where other\nfamily members were hiding and we asked to join them basically and the farmer accepted us. As\nan added, well remember this was for money. The farmers were being paid very well. By then\nstandard. As an aside, when the money ran out, we had to go.",
        "Q: You had to leave.",
        "A: This was not done out of idealism. I mean they were risking their lives. What they did was\ncertainly appreciated but when the money ran out, we \u2014 my aunt on the other hand was with a\nfamily where the money, when her money ran out they kept her and I spent a while with her.",
        "Q: From 42 on til \u2014",
        "A: All right, 42 on. September of 42 to about fall 43.",
        "Q: So that\u2019s a year.",
        "A: Father was dead already. Mother was doing her best to manage in Krakow. We had papers as\nChristians.",
        "Q: Oh by then you had \u2014 so what was your name? Did you have a new name?",
        "A: Mokra, M-O-K-R-A",
        "Q: And your first name?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: My Yiddish name, my Jewish name is Abraham and so the Polish version was Adam so my\nPolish name at that time was Adam Mokra.",
        "Q: So you were now in Krakow?",
        "A: After the hiding period, I joined \u2014 after the -- When we could no longer hide at that place,\nmother sent one of her friends from Krakow to get me. And \u2014",
        "Q: You moved to Krakow \u2014",
        "A: For only a few days.",
        "Q: Oh a few days and then what?",
        "A: There was a fairly well established, by well established, I mean not generally known but\namong the few Jews who survived, one of the ways of getting, survived to that point, one of the\nways of getting out of Poland was through Czechoslovakia. So mother had arranged and again I\ndon\u2019t know how she arranged it, but she was a miracle worker.",
        "Q: She sounds like it.",
        "A: She had arranged to essentially go to Czechoslovakia. So of course, you couldn\u2019t get a\npassport and go to Czechoslovakia. The idea was the papers that we did have as Christians,\nessentially made it possible for us to go to Zakopane. Zakopane was a \u2014",
        "Q: Resort, wasn\u2019t it?",
        "A: Yeah. Ok. But it was close to Czechoslovakia. So we went to Zakopane, by train. Not with\nher. She was already there but a friend of mother\u2019s picked me up at the farmer\u2019s place and took\nme to Zakopane. This is another farm. There were two farmers and families where we hid. And\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014\ntook me to Zakopane and the next evening. No, that evening, that evening we started walking to\nCzechoslovakia.",
        "Q: The two of you?",
        "A: No, no with a group. A small group. About five or six people.",
        "Q: You\u2019re seven years old?",
        "A: Yeah this was September of 42 or don\u2019t remember. November of 42. Ok. October of 42, that\nsort of thing, so I was seven and a half. Basically crossed the border into Slovak, well what is\nnow Slovakia, not Czechoslovakia. Liptosky Santa Nicholas [ph]. Again I don\u2019t know how\nmother arranged it but the group was met by a car. And transported to a collection house where\nother refugees like us were being accommodated. Slovakia was much less under German\noccupation than Poland. They came in later on, much more tightly, but at that time you couldn\u2019t\nfunction as Jews, but the pressure was much lower. So we were taken to that place and stayed\nthere for a few days. That was sort of like heaven. Cause when I was in hiding, for example, in\nPoland. I don\u2019t know whether I mentioned it before but the last few months, 42, no almost a year\nwhen part of the time, after I joined my aunt in hiding, after November 42, part of the time we\nwere in an attic. That was for a little while and then after that essentially in a barn but buried\nunder straw. So they had to keep the straw to feed the animals, take care of the animals, farm\nanimals. And the farmer had arranged a hiding place under the straw. So this was completely\ndark. Flashlights only for eating. For sudden. I didn\u2019t have any, I had shoes. The kind of shoes\nthat I came in with and I came in as a seven year old. At that time I was eight. So one year,\nbetween seven and eight your feet grow. The shoes didn\u2019t. You know my toes were curled up\nlike that and it took a few months to get them straightened out. So where were we at this point.\nSlovakia.",
        "Q: This is 43 we\u2019re talking about.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: This was 43. So we stayed there for a short period. Days, rather than weeks, I would say.\nThen transport was arranged to the Hungarian border. And a guide took us from the closest\nrailroad station. No, not railroad station. Because we went by car, this was car. On the\nCzechoslovak side to Hungary. Again walking. Scary moments in trying to cross the border.\nAnd you know worried about where 1s the border patrol and all that. Anyway, when we crossed\ninto Hungary I think the guide had an arrangement with the Hungarian border patrol, so first he\ncollected the money from us. And then he reported us to the Hungarian border police and they\nstanding there waiting with a rifle behind the rocks so as we walked by they all of a sudden\nstepped out. I remember the sound of the bolt being pulled back.\nThere were six or seven, eight of us on the \u2014",
        "Q: Were you the only child?",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah. At that point there, not many children had survived to that point. The children\nwere the first to be killed off. So we were taken to a jail, a civilian jail, you know border\ncrossing. And I remember it was a Saturday. And as we were walking through the town, we saw\nJews coming back from dovening there. They \u2014",
        "Q: Do you remember what town in Hungary it was? You don\u2019t know. That\u2019s ok. Did you talk to\nthem?",
        "A: No. No. cause we were Christians.",
        "Q: Oh right I forgot, you\u2019re Christian. Yes.",
        "A: But the Jews recognized us as Jews. So we ended up in the town jail for crossing the border\nillegally. But remember Hungary was not under German control yet. So what I remember about\nthat Saturday is that the Jewish population of the town started sending us food into the jail. And\nwe ended up with about 20 or 30, there weren\u2019t many of us. I said the group was only about six\nor seven people, eight people. We ended up with about 20 or 30 pots of cholent. For the first\ntime since the bad times during the war started, the first time since 1941, I stuffed myself.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "Q: Up to that point, had your health been ok?",
        "A: Yes. The usually kiddie stuff.",
        "Q: No, but it was a stressful time. I was just wondering if \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, no, no.",
        "Q: You had your cholent.",
        "A: Right. Did I have cholent. Very different cholent from the Polish cholent. Cause they used\nbeans. The Polish cholent does not use beans. Or at least not our type of Polish.",
        "Q: Did you ever hear any of Hitler\u2019s speeches on the radio, cause you understood German you\nsaid.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Now you\u2019re in Hungary and \u2014",
        "A: Yeah so we had been transported from the border basically to a larger town in. From the\nlarger town, eventually to Budapest.",
        "Q: To Budapest?",
        "A: And we were being transported to Budapest on a passenger train, not the cattle cars or\nanything like that but regular passenger train. Mother was sitting. It was a passenger train so we\nwere being guarded by the Hungarian police, but we were not in chains or anything. So we were\njust being transported from one jail to another jail but the jail in the capital.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "Q: I see. They were taking you to another jail.",
        "A: Yeah in the capital in Budapest. From this \u2014",
        "Q: How old was your mother at this time? Do you know what year she was born?",
        "A: She was 27 years older than I am so at the time I was eight years old, she was 34. That sort of\nthing. Now the idea was to get \u2014 one of the people in the group that we were with when we had\ncrossed the border had a relative in Budapest. Now how do we get information to them that\nwe\u2019re around, help. So one of the people had a sheet of paper and a pencil on him. So mother\nasked him to write down the name of the person and the address. And on the back she wrote in\nGerman, we are here, giving the names of the people in the group. Help. You know with the\nname of the relative of the one person in the group, Huhum. So what do you do with it? She\nmade believe she had a headache and sort of leaned down on the, in the railroad carriage. It was\nthird class carriage. Stuffed the note into the shoe of the man who was sitting next to her, hoping\nfor the best. And \u2014",
        "Q: This was a stranger?",
        "A: Yeah, complete stranger. The guy sort of looked at her and she gave him a sign, don\u2019t say\nanything because the guards were sitting in the aisle behind them. One of the guards, anyway.\nAnd so they brought us to the Hungarian civilian, this was a civilian jail. Basically mother had,\nin the letter mother sent see if you can arrange for us to be accepted as political refugees. We\nhad all, we all had papers as Christians at that point. But the Polish paper. And after about three\nor four weeks 1n jail, it worked. So now we were Polish refugees in Hungary.",
        "Q: What was it like for an eight year old to be in jail? You stayed with your mother?",
        "A: Yeah. The men and women were separated obviously but eight year old kid. I was allowed to\nstay with my mother.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "Q: Any memories of that time?",
        "A: Oh yeah. Distinct memories.",
        "Q: Such as?",
        "A: Mother\u2019s nightgown was stolen. And she, all we had was one small suitcase and mother\ncarried a, and you couldn\u2019t have changes of underpants, underwear or anything so you had to\nwash everything. So when she washed her nightgown at one point. One of the fellow gypsy,\nfellow prisoners, a gypsy lady stole it. The reason that we know that she stole it, cause mother\nrecognized it on her. So mother reported it and they asked her to take it off and mother said\nforget it.",
        "Q: Then you get out of jail and \u2014",
        "A: The relative of one of our fellow pass, one of our fellow, one of the people in the group,\narranged a, with their relative to have us recognized as political refugees and we were taken\naway, were released from prison. And what do we do? So there was a restaurant in Budapest.\nAnd I don\u2019t know how mother found out about it where there was a gathering place, essentially\nfor people like us. Refugees. And there you could arrange all sorts of things. And we were\naccepted as political refugees, sent to a small village in Hungary. And they couldn\u2019t keep\neverybody in Budapest. Everybody wanted to stay 1n Budapest but they couldn\u2019t keep\neverybody there.",
        "Q: Which village, do you know?",
        "A: Erich Cherta [ph]. Near Kolorcha [ph]. Kolorcha is sort of almost in the center of\nHungary. And this was a small village. The train goes straight south from Budapest to I think the\nbranch station was Kishkarev [ph]. The names are meaningless. And from there you take\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014\nanother train to Kolorcha and on the way to Kolorcha, there was this little village where we\nended up. And this was \u2014",
        "Q: With a family?",
        "A: Well we were on our own. We rented a room.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re still Christian?",
        "A: Oh yeah absolutely. Church, going to church every \u2014",
        "Q: You went to church?",
        "A: Absolutely. Absolutely. On one occasion a Polish priest, because a lot of Poles were in\nHungary at the time. Not a lot but \u2014 in our village for example there were, our village. I mean the\nvillage where we stayed. There were maybe 15, 20 other people, 20 to 30, Polish. Real Polish.\nSo there was a Polish priest who came to visit. Keeping track of the faithful.",
        "Q: Did he question you?",
        "A: He didn\u2019t question us. I mean he wanted me to be altar boy. So I think he, I ended up\nescaping from that. He used one of the Hungarian altar boy.",
        "Q: Did he realize \u2014",
        "A: He performed mass in Polish and we were there.",
        "Q: Did he realize that you all were Jewish?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I mean he may have but he didn\u2019t let on. Ok, he didn\u2019t let on. He came to\nvisit. We spent a very nice hour or two with him. Nice guy. But he didn\u2019t let on. If he knew, he\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014\ndidn\u2019t let on. We were not prospective parishioners but we were fellow expatriates type of thing.\nAnd \u2014",
        "Q: So you stayed in that village for a long time?",
        "A: I\u2019m trying to think. It was five months, six months. And it was a matter of months.",
        "Q: Months, ok. And then?",
        "A: Then we were told that all the Polish people were being shipped off and we didn\u2019t know what\nthat meant. So it was a question again of going back to Budapest and disappearing. Now\ndisappearing was pulling off a disappearing act like that was not trivial. Because if you wanted\nto rent a, you didn\u2019t rent an apartment. You rented a bed. I remember the Hungarian the ad, the\nadvertisements. Bed for rent which meant that you literally rented a bad in somebody\u2019s\napartment. Odge Kiando [ph], Hungarian phrase for bed for rent.",
        "Q: Is that what your mother did? She rented a bed.",
        "A: Sure you have to say something and try to make contact with the Jewish organization and\nthere was, I mentioned there was a restaurant. And again I don\u2019t know how mother found out\nabout it. And she could do miracles. Anyway she found out about it. We went there and she\nmade contact. And at that point, the Joint kicked in. Because it was, she started being able to get\nmoney. There was no money. She had one five dollar bill from before the war which she kept\nthrough the worst of all possible times. She kept it in the heel of her shoe. But that was basically\nthe only thing we had. So at that point money started coming in. Enough to, for us to be able to\nrent an apartment and to live on. And living essentially meant having a loaf of bread for\nbreakfast type of thing. And because there were no cooking privileges. When you rent a bed,\nthere are no cooking privileges. So for lunch we would have to go to restaurants. And it was kind\nof fun. Hungarian was primitive. Mother\u2019s Hungarian was very primitive. My Hungarian was\nprimitive. I had learned. You know kids learn. Kids learn quickly. So one interesting episode\nfrom that period in regard to food. You can\u2019t eat the same thing all the time. So we were trying\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014\nnew dishes every so often. So on one occasion, lecho. Let\u2019s try lecho. After you try everything\nelse and we were basically ordering. Every so often we would order two plates but occasionally\nwe would order one plate. There was just not enough money to, so we order the lecho.",
        "Q: What is lecho?",
        "A: A dish for which you need a fire extinguisher. I think it\u2019s rice based or corn based. I\u2019m not\nsure. I don\u2019t remember the prime ingredient. Actually it\u2019s very good. After the war at it was\nexcellent but at that time, on that one occasion, just couldn\u2019t eat it. But you know the Hungarian\nrestaurants at that time, the restaurants in Budapest were perfectly satisfactory. So the important\nthing was to find one that was cheap and often. And the one that was cheap enough to find items\non the menu that were cheap enough. So the money would last.",
        "Q: Did you see Jews being taken away at all?",
        "A: I saw Jews in Hungary in 1942, yes. In 1942.",
        "Q: 44 we\u2019re talking about, 43, 44.",
        "A: 40 yes sorry. 42 we were in hiding. And at that time, Jews in Hungary were still alright. But\nnot for long. Cause June 44, Horthy Miklos resigned. And Germans essentially took over the\ncountry.",
        "Q: You were there? So did you see Jews being rounded up?",
        "A: Well, before that we saw quite a few Jews. And every time mother had the opportunity, Jews\nwith beards. I mean the Jewish there were \u2014 and every time mother had the chance to talk to one\nof them, she said get away from here. Hide. When the Germans come in, they\u2019Il make your life\nmiserable. And the answer was invariably not here. I never realized that \u2014",
        "Q: But you all weren\u2019t in a sense worried because you were Polish Christians still in Hungary?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: Well the level of worry.",
        "Q: I mean you were worried of course, but I mean you still had papers that you were Polish\nChristians.",
        "A: Yes, refugees yes. We were accepted as refugees by the Hungarian government. As political\nrefugees. There is only one problem. I was circumcised. So the danger lay in somebody saying I\nsuspect you\u2019re Jewish. Drop your pants. You know so that the game is up. Because the\nChristians at that time, invariably were not circumcised. It\u2019s not like the United States now. So\nthat was the dangerous part. But as long as that didn\u2019t happen, we were fine.",
        "Q: So you stayed in that situation until the end of the war? Until liberation?",
        "A: Until January of 45. When the Russians came in.",
        "Q: You were in Budapest?",
        "A: Yeah. Well part of the time we lived in the village, some from Budapest, Erich Cherta, I think\nI mentioned that.",
        "Q: Your mom had gone to the, back to the restaurant you said and tried to make arrangements.\nAnd then \u2014",
        "A: No, no, no. The arrangements were just a few hours. But we stayed in the village for a few\nmonths.",
        "Q: The name of the village, do you remember the name of the village?",
        "A: Erich Cherta, on the way between Kishkarev and Kolorcha. It was side spur.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "Q: You did say that.",
        "A: It\u2019s a north, south line.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s where you were at liberation?",
        "A: No, we were liberated in Budapest because at that time what was happening basically is that\nfor some reason, the stay in the village got iffy. It wasn\u2019t, we didn\u2019t feel right. There were\nsearches. They suspected that some of the people were Jews. So the simplest thing to do was to\ndisappear.",
        "Q: Go back to Budapest.",
        "A: And disappear meant basically go back to Budapest.",
        "Q: Which you did.",
        "A: And live as Polish refugees in Budapest. But you have to register with the police, give an\naddress and people were not allowed to rent you even a bed more than one night if you hadn\u2019t\nregistered with the police. And you had to have proof that you registered with the police by\nfilling out a form and getting a little piece of the form torn off with a police stamp. So there were\ntwo levels of hiding. One was if you lived for example at 37 Kiriutsa. You put down 7 Kiriutsa.\nReported to the police, got it stamped and then added the three. So present it to the landlord,\nperfectly legitimate but the police still didn\u2019t know exactly where you were. And on one\noccasion that saved us because the city was big but the neighborhoods were small. So we were\nwalking into our apartment. Somebody came up to us and said the police was looking for you,\nbut they were looking for you at \u2014",
        "Q: Down the street.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: Down the street. Why were they looking for you down the street? No idea. So we\nskedaddled back to, packed a small suitcase and disappeared immediately.",
        "Q: Tell me about liberation.",
        "A: Ah. The last few days before liberation were \u2014 ah, well we were very happy at the time. But it\nwasn\u2019t that for the population as a whole. It wasn\u2019t a very happy time because even when we\nwere in the village. The village was just south of, about a hundred kilometers or so, south of\nBudapest. And throughout a good chunk of 1944 I could see the bombers. You know this was,\nthis lasted for what seemed like hours. The overflight lasted for what seemed like hours. And\nthey were coming I think from air bases in North Africa or Italy. \u2019'm not sure where. And just\ndropping major loads on Budapest.",
        "Q: Did you go into shelters?",
        "A: Well not in the village. In the village I still didn\u2019t encounter them. Then when we went back\nto Budapest, it was essentially a question of spending a good chunk of every night in the air raid\nshelter. You know as far as we were concerned, they could bomb the hell out of the city as long\nas they didn\u2019t hit our building and towards the end \u2014",
        "Q: So you\u2019re an old man of nine years old at that point.",
        "A: Yeah. Towards the end the bombing got very dense. I mean I was right, I was on the ground\nfloor of the building, a five story building and a 50 kilo bomb hit the top floor. Right above me.\nSo the bomb penetrated the roof and one floor, but it was only a 50 kilo bomb so the roof, the\nceiling of the, and the floor of that apartment was enough to slow it down. It wasn\u2019t a high\nexplosive so. But it was scary. I mean the ceiling started to shedding dust.",
        "Q: Do you remember anything your mother said to you specifically going through those\ntraumatic times? Sounds like a very strong, incredible woman.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: Oh yeah. My hero.",
        "Q: You obviously came through it so she \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember any specific words. I\u2019d have to think about that.",
        "Q: How did you know it was the time of liberation?",
        "A: Russian soldiers, well we were in the basement of the building. But basically all of life moved\ndown to the basement. For food basically we had ten pounds of beans. And mother cooked beans\nin water. That was our food three times a day. Twice a day. We didn\u2019t eat three times a day. She\nmanaged to get the beans by essentially walking into the back of a store, grocery store and the\nowner of the store took pity on us and basically sold us, I can give you some beans. Ok, we\u2019ll\nbuy beans and that kept us going for, towards the end of the, until liberation.",
        "Q: What, let\u2019s talk about liberation now. Any specific memories?",
        "A: Yeah the liberation essentially the first sign of liberation was a lot of shooting. The fighting.\nAnd then when that quieted down a squad of Romanian soldiers walked up. And they stayed\novernight and then moved on. But the Romanian soldiers, and I\u2019m not sure whether the\nRomanian soldiers were a German rear guard. Or the Russian advance troops. That I don\u2019t\nremember any more. I think they were part of the Russian advance. And then we started seeing\nRussian soldiers. With a red star and you know the Russian cap. Flap up and then the, very\ngood they were excellent design. I have one like that. Not enough, not from that period but \u2014",

        "A: No, there wasn\u2019t very much to celebrate. Just celebrate, just being happy to have survived.\nMajor worry about what happened to the rest of the family. Major worry about is father alive?\nFather didn\u2019t go into hiding with us because he was with his friend.",

        "Q: What reception did you all have?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t because we basically went back. We saw there were no Jews and we skedaddled.\nSo it was just a short visit.",
        "Q: A short visit. And did you go back to Bucharest. After that did you \u2014",
        "A: No, not after Poland, no. After Poland we went to Germany.",
        "Q: To Germany. And where were you in Germany?",
        "A: A small town first in east Germany and east Germany was under communists so that was not\na happy long term solution so we went to West Germany, to Munich first.

        "A: Stayed in Germany so first I had private tutoring until 1948 and then in 48 started regular\nschool. And I was pretty much caught up with \u2014 because of my private tutor. He was a fantastic\ntutor. He had been assistant, well private docent. I don\u2019t know what that, that would be\nessentially somewhere between instructor and assistant professor at the University of Breslau. He\nwas at loose ends so and he was tutoring a friend of mine. There were only two or three kids my\nage at Bad Reichenhall in the town, not in the DP camp, but in the town. Eventually we moved\nout of the camp into the town. So he was a tutor for one of my friends. I basically asked him\nwhether he would be interested in tutoring me also. He said yes, so he and father made\narrangements as to how much and all that. I wasn\u2019t involved in that. But he started tutoring me.",

        "Q: Worcester, Massachusetts?",
        "A: Yeah. So they moved to Worcester and since, at that point, we had relatives in Worcester, we\ncame to Worcester.",
        "Q: You came to Worcester in 51 so you were 16 years old. Did you know any English?",
        "A: [had had one year of English with my tutor.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",

        "A: Absolutely, the night before.",
        "Q: Was that meaningful for you?",
        "A: You better believe it, you\u2019d better believe it. I stayed on the deck for hours. Just staring at\nthe Statue of Liberty and we sailed right by the Statue of Liberty. The ship docked somewhere on\n30\" Street, in the 30s. At that point, of course the Statue of Liberty was no longer visible. But\nwas visible at dusk. And that was an unbelievable sight.",
        "Q: Getting off the boat, did for your mother, for you or your mother?",
        "A: We had two boxes and my mother had already married Oscar at that time.",
        "Q: I mean psychologically, putting your feet on American soil.",
        "A: That was thrilling. That was unbelievable. That was incredible. I was standing at the railing\nthe night before, just looking at cars going by on the shore. The ship, before it got into dock, I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014\nhad to go through several steps. Sort of waiting in line for the dock to clear or something like\nthat. I\u2019m not sure how it worked.",

Three dollars a night\ntype of thing. And we knew some people in New York who had immigrated a year or two earlier\nso we met them. And organized to have the boxes shipped to Worcester and after a few days we\ntook a train to Worcester.",

        "A: Occasionally but not \u2014",
        "Q: What about the high school teachers. Were they sensitive to what you had gone through do\nyou think?",
        "A: Probably but again I didn\u2019t notice any special treatment.",
        "Q: So you felt accepted?",
        "A: Oh yeah, absolutely.",
        "Q: Did you feel very different than the other kids?",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: Yeah but you know the need to do well was overwhelming.",
        "Q: You mean academically?",
        "A: Yeah so basically I hit the books. I needed to prove myself.",
        "Q: Why did you need to prove yourself after what you had been through?",
        "A: Well because you know as a refugee kid, you sort of realize that things aren\u2019t going to be\nhanded to you on a silver platter. So parents made it very clear that it was essential for me to go\nto a university and in order to get accepted to the university you had to have good grades. The\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014\nguidance counselors were excellent. There was only one who wasn\u2019t outstanding and that one\nbasically, you\u2019re a refugee kid. Why don\u2019t you take the kind of subjects that will make it easier\nfor you to learn a trade.",

        "Q: Doing what?",
        "A: Well initially I was soda fountain attendant. And after that I got a high paying job as a pants\npresser. Not a finishing presser, but a, I was doing the inseam. They hired me at I think 55 cents,\nno not 55. 75 cents an hour. You know once they saw that I could do things my salary went up\nto one fifteen an hour and that was unheard of wealth. So at four hours a day I was making five,\nalmost five dollars.",
        "Q: You graduate from high school.",
        "A: Yep.",
        "Q: You go on to \u2014",

        "A: Post doc. I stayed on in Princeton for a year, with the same professor, doing a different kind\nof work than the graduate work. And then a year in Switzerland. Well nine months in\nSwitzerland. On a NATO post-doctoral fellowship.",
        "Q: What was it like to go back to Europe?",
        "A: Nice. I could speak the language. I knew, it wasn\u2019t a problem. I didn\u2019t quite understand\ninitially. I didn\u2019t understand what they were saying to me because it was Switzer Deutsche. It\nwasn\u2019t my kind of German.",
        "Q: Did you continue to talk to your parents and in what language?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: Initially German or Polish. Mostly German but occasionally we would switch. Depending on\nwhat we were talking about so it was essentially a bilingual existence. And after a while they got\nto be very good in English.",
        "Q: They did, at their age?",
        "A: By themselves, they always spoke Yiddish. But with me it was Yiddish or Polish, German.\nMostly, I think mostly German. No, it was Yiddish. Mostly Yiddish.",
        "Q: So this is the early 60s.",
        "A: This is no, no sorry, yes, it was Switzerland, not Worcester. Switzerland was 61.",
        "Q: And then?",
        "A: Then I got an assistant professorship at UCLA, taught there for four or five years. No 62,\nsorry. After the one year, post-doctoral year in Switzerland, 1t was assistant professorship at\nUCLA for five years. And then I got an associate professorship at McGill.",
        "Q: McGill? In Montreal?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And so you moved to Montreal?",
        "A: Yeah. And retired from there.",
        "Q: And you stayed in Montreal from then on. Did you ever get married?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: Oh yeah. Once too many. Married first time in 57, high school sweetheart and all that. It was\na disaster. That ended in 83, I think. In Montreal.",
        "Q: Do you have any children?",
        "A: Yes. Eliot.",
        "Q: Eliot is your son. Ok. Can we now talk about some of your thoughts and your perspectives\nand feelings about what you went through? Do you think you would have turned out to be a\ndifferent kind of person if you hadn\u2019t gone through the trauma that you did?",
        "A: I thought about that every so often. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I like to play scenarios in my\nmind but it\u2019s \u2014",
        "Q: What if.",
        "A: What if is not an exact science.",
        "Q: Are there any sounds or sights or even smells today that trigger memories of the war to you?",
        "A: German uniforms.",
        "Q: What does that do to you?",
        "A: It makes me hate. I realize, rationally I realize perfectly well that the Germans today are very\ndifferent group of people from the Germans that I \u2014",
        "Q: Cause I wanted to ask you what your thoughts about Germany and Germans are today?",
        "A: Ah. Rationally I think a lot better of the Germans today than of the Poles today because the\nPoles were \u2014 you know very mixed feelings about Poland also because it was Polish people who\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014\nsaved my life but by the same token it was Polish people who were responsible for the death of\nmost of my family. Polish part of the family. So and you know right now in going back, anti-\nsemitism never existed in Poland, according to the Polish version. The Germans acknowledge\nwhat happened and made moves to get over it. But Poland never acknowledged the anti-\nSemitism and anti-Semitism was vicious. And I remember numerable times getting beaten up.",
        "Q: You were physically beaten up, not just verbally.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Were you ever really harmed?",
        "A: No. it wasn\u2019t, yeah \u2014",
        "Q: Bruised.",
        "A: Horse manure was thrown at me. You know stuff like that. And the frequency with which I\nwas called Poshavezhedia. Scabby Jew. And this, it was, you could see that it was gut level\nanti-Semitism. And when we were living as Christians, part of the time that we were living as\nChristians, going to church and all that, the sermons, insofar as they dealt with Jews were not\nviciously anti-Semitic but they were intellectually anti-Semitic. Not every one of them,\nobviously. Not every priest. But I have no love for the Catholic church.",
        "Q: Have you been back to Poland as an adult?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Because.",
        "A: Scientific meetings.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "Q: Scientific meetings. And what were your emotional responses when you got into the country?",
        "A: Very negative initially, very negative initially and then after a day or two. Anti-Semitism in\nPoland probably is not much worse than anti-Semitism in many other places. It probably is but it\nis worse than the other places that I visit but maybe it\u2019s because I understand the language and I\nknow them better. You know and we lived in Germany after the war. I had German friends,\ngood German friends. I kept in touch with them for many years.",
        "Q: Even after you came here?",
        "A: Yeah. With Germany I find it easier to, I find it much easier to deal with Germans than with\nPoles. Not because the people I\u2019m likely to meet were responsible for anything dealing with the\nHolocaust. It\u2019s just the instinctive feeling is very negative.",
        "Q: Do you think, and again you were a young child, do you think your experience affected you\nspiritually as a Jew or religiously?",
        "A: Religiously.",
        "Q: It\u2019s hard to say cause you were young.",
        "A: Religiously, I like to think of myself as an orthodox atheist. I feel most comfortable in terms\nof synagogue attendance I am most comfortable in an orthodox environment, to the point even\northodox or even Chasidic environment. Intellectually I\u2019m an atheist.",
        "Q: How did you raise your son? Did you give him a religious background?",
        "A: Yes. He got a, yes, he went to \u2014",
        "Q: Hebrew school?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: Not Hebrew school but he went to a school, a Jewish \u2014",
        "Q: Day school?",
        "A: Yeah, day school.",
        "Q: In Montreal?",
        "A: Yeah. First a non-religious one and then later on a more religious one.",
        "Q: So he had a Jewish background?",
        "A: Yeah, very much so.",
        "Q: What were your thoughts, do you remember, during the Eichmann trial? Did you follow it?",
        "A: I wish we could put the whole country in it. No, you know there were obviously a lot of very\ngood Germans. Even if they kept quiet. I mean again keeping quiet is not shameful. I don\u2019t\nknow what I would have done, that\u2019s all I, I don\u2019t want to say anything about the people who\nkept quiet and disappeared into the background. But I have no love lost for Germany. I try to\navoid going back to Germany. Not because the present day Germans are responsible for anything\nthat happened then, but because of what it evokes, cause of what it evokes.",
        "Q: What are your thoughts about Israel?",
        "A: Very positive.",
        "Q: Have you been?",
        "A: Yeah. Have relatives.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "Q: You have relatives there?",
        "A: Yes. I go Israel almost every, I'd say average every two years. Going back there in September\nof this year again. Very positive, very strong. We lived in Israel for a year at the Weismann\nhouse. I was on sabbatical at the Weismann Institute. Not quite a year.",
        "Q: Was it an advantage do you think being so young in the beginning of your wartime\nexperience than if you had been older?",
        "A: I hesitate to think of it as an advantage in any way shape or manner.",
        "Q: Was it better to have been young, that you experienced this?",
        "A: If [had my choice would I rather have been older? Is that the \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah, that\u2019s one way of looking at it. Or was it better that you were younger and not aware of\nwhat your parents were aware of. Obviously your parents were aware.",
        "A: No, I was aware fairly early. In 1942 I started seeing the first bodies, when I was seven years\nold. My grandparents were murdered when I was in 1940, when I was seven years old.",
        "Q: What does that do to a child?",
        "A: It taught me to hate the Germans. And it took a major effort of will to realize that not every\nGerman was a Nazi. Right now I\u2019ve come to terms with it, but and then you know we lived in\nGermany for a while. The late 40s so. Living essentially in the enemy camp was a major\nproblem initially. Starting to go to a German school initially was a major problem, but as time\nwent by, I made friends among the German kids in class and I was in touch with at least one of\nthem for quite a few years.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "Q: You said that. Are you more comfortable around other people who are survivors as opposed\nto people who are not?",
        "A: I think it matters right now.",
        "Q: Do you feel a connection?",
        "A: Yeah, but not the kind of connection that makes conversation easier. There is a bond but, and\nyou know. Let me put it this way. When I go to a meeting and \u2014",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about a professional meeting?",
        "A: Yeah. And one of the speakers is Jewish, do I necessarily go to his talk in preference to\nsomebody who is non Jewish. Not really. I mean the kind of feeling, well yeah it\u2019s nice that a\nJew made it, is doing such nice work. But that\u2019s about it.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t feel a gut connection?",
        "A: Not while I\u2019m doing science, no. It\u2019s, I mean it\u2019s basically it\u2019s nice that a Jew is doing such\nnice work.",
        "Q: As you\u2019ve gotten older do you think more about your childhood experiences?",

        "A: It\u2019s appropriate to have holocaust museums wherever they spring up. And you know even\nnow, what good would it do to have a holocaust museum in every small town in Germany? The\nGerman kids are no different from the French kids and the Spanish kids. Can\u2019t hold them\nresponsible for anything. It\u2019s important for them to know and as far as I know, I have very good\nGerman friends, professional friends. And they tell me that the youngsters get taught about the\nHolocaust. And in considerable detail. He even said sometimes they say, they tell me it\u2019s too\nmuch. But I don\u2019t say anything in a situation like that.",

        "Q: Do you think the world has learned anything from the lessons, any lessons from the\nHolocaust?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: Depends who. Germans have. The rest of the world, probably not. What they have learned is\nif you\u2019re going to kill out a group of people, do it quietly. Don\u2019t leave traces. You see a lot of\nthis in Asia for example. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a situation that can\u2019t happen again but I think it\u2019s a\nsituation that we have to be careful, careful in the sense of watch out for. I think it can happen\nagain. It\u2019s very tempting if you don\u2019t like someone to kill them. And especially if you can get\nahold of their goodies. Right now, more of it\u2019s going on in Asia than anywhere else or in Africa.\nBut there are islands of hatred in Europe that are still burning bright. Thinking of Yugoslavia for\nexample. So from that point of view, some Europeans have learned a lot from World War Two.\nA lot have learned less. And amnesia is beginning to settle in. There\u2019s not much we can do about\nit. If they don\u2019t want to learn. So I think the only way to protect oneself against that sort of thing\nis to do exactly what Israel is doing. To provide stockpiles of atomic weapons. Hopefully never\nto use them but then your enemies know that you have them.",

        "A: Thrilling.",

        "A: No, because it wasn\u2019t practical. They were living in a different town so the applications. We\nall lived in Worcester initially. But then they moved to Leonia, New Jersey. And I stayed in\nWorcester to finish college.",
        "Q: So you got it in Massachusetts?",
        "A: Yes, in Worcester.",

Those who weren\u2019t killed immediately were\ntransported away and only five or ten percent of the Jews of the town remained. Father remained\nbasically. Father, father was alive only because he was transporting the dead bodies. Anyway, in\nthe time after that we knew that we had to disappear.

I don\u2019t know how to translate that.",
        "A: But the first one was September 23. The second one was sometime in November. I don\u2019t\nremember the exact date. But we again we knew it was coming because of the personal friend in\nthe police department. So \u2014",

        "A: Yeah. Father stayed in town because my uncle, his best friend, was married to my mother\u2019s\nsister so he said I can\u2019t go with you. I have to wait for him. He was out of town and was\nsupposed to come back that evening. And did indeed come back there. But father sent us off. The\nbest friend did indeed come back that evening. But by that time the town was already\nsurrounded and he couldn\u2019t get out.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, that was the last time I saw him.",
        "A: She found out a few weeks later through the policeman friend. We let him know that we were\nin hiding, where we were. And he came by and told mother that he was taken away. With his\nbest friend.",
        "A: No. From what my older cousin who is no longer alive told me they were taken to a small\ntown nearby and shot. He heard that again from the policeman. My mother didn\u2019t tell me.\nMother knew but she didn\u2019t tell me until very much later. As far as, what she tried to maintain is\nthe idea that we don\u2019t know where he is. We hope he\u2019! be back.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: Yes. There were several places that hiding places were prepared, but when push came to\nshove most of them didn\u2019t want us. So apparently the penalties for hiding Jews was severe. And\nmost of them didn\u2019t want to take the chance which 1s again understandable. So of all the places\nthat we had prepared, none of them worked out. So eventually we went to a place where other\nfamily members were hiding and we asked to join them basically and the farmer accepted us. As\nan added, well remember this was for money. The farmers were being paid very well. By then\nstandard. As an aside, when the money ran out, we had to go.",
        "A: This was not done out of idealism. I mean they were risking their lives. What they did was\ncertainly appreciated but when the money ran out, we \u2014 my aunt on the other hand was with a\nfamily where the money, when her money ran out they kept her and I spent a while with her.",
        "A: All right, 42 on. September of 42 to about fall 43.",
        "A: Father was dead already. Mother was doing her best to manage in Krakow. We had papers as\nChristians.",
        "A: Mokra, M-O-K-R-A\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: My Yiddish name, my Jewish name is Abraham and so the Polish version was Adam so my\nPolish name at that time was Adam Mokra.",
        "A: After the hiding period, I joined \u2014 after the -- When we could no longer hide at that place,\nmother sent one of her friends from Krakow to get me. And \u2014",
        "A: For only a few days.",
        "A: There was a fairly well established, by well established, I mean not generally known but\namong the few Jews who survived, one of the ways of getting, survived to that point, one of the\nways of getting out of Poland was through Czechoslovakia. So mother had arranged and again I\ndon\u2019t know how she arranged it, but she was a miracle worker.",
        "A: She had arranged to essentially go to Czechoslovakia. So of course, you couldn\u2019t get a\npassport and go to Czechoslovakia. The idea was the papers that we did have as Christians,\nessentially made it possible for us to go to Zakopane. Zakopane was a \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. Ok. But it was close to Czechoslovakia. So we went to Zakopane, by train. Not with\nher. She was already there but a friend of mother\u2019s picked me up at the farmer\u2019s place and took\nme to Zakopane. This is another farm. There were two farmers and families where we hid. And\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014\ntook me to Zakopane and the next evening. No, that evening, that evening we started walking to\nCzechoslovakia.",
        "A: No, no with a group. A small group. About five or six people.",
        "A: Yeah this was September of 42 or don\u2019t remember. November of 42. Ok. October of 42, that\nsort of thing, so I was seven and a half. Basically crossed the border into Slovak, well what is\nnow Slovakia, not Czechoslovakia. Liptosky Santa Nicholas [ph]. Again I don\u2019t know how\nmother arranged it but the group was met by a car. And transported to a collection house where\nother refugees like us were being accommodated. Slovakia was much less under German\noccupation than Poland. They came in later on, much more tightly, but at that time you couldn\u2019t\nfunction as Jews, but the pressure was much lower. So we were taken to that place and stayed\nthere for a few days. That was sort of like heaven. Cause when I was in hiding, for example, in\nPoland. I don\u2019t know whether I mentioned it before but the last few months, 42, no almost a year\nwhen part of the time, after I joined my aunt in hiding, after November 42, part of the time we\nwere in an attic. That was for a little while and then after that essentially in a barn but buried\nunder straw. So they had to keep the straw to feed the animals, take care of the animals, farm\nanimals. And the farmer had arranged a hiding place under the straw. So this was completely\ndark. Flashlights only for eating. For sudden. I didn\u2019t have any, I had shoes. The kind of shoes\nthat I came in with and I came in as a seven year old. At that time I was eight. So one year,\nbetween seven and eight your feet grow. The shoes didn\u2019t. You know my toes were curled up\nlike that and it took a few months to get them straightened out. So where were we at this point.\nSlovakia.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: This was 43. So we stayed there for a short period. Days, rather than weeks, I would say.\nThen transport was arranged to the Hungarian border. And a guide took us from the closest\nrailroad station. No, not railroad station. Because we went by car, this was car. On the\nCzechoslovak side to Hungary. Again walking. Scary moments in trying to cross the border.\nAnd you know worried about where 1s the border patrol and all that. Anyway, when we crossed\ninto Hungary I think the guide had an arrangement with the Hungarian border patrol, so first he\ncollected the money from us. And then he reported us to the Hungarian border police and they\nstanding there waiting with a rifle behind the rocks so as we walked by they all of a sudden\nstepped out. I remember the sound of the bolt being pulled back.\nThere were six or seven, eight of us on the \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah. At that point there, not many children had survived to that point. The children\nwere the first to be killed off. So we were taken to a jail, a civilian jail, you know border\ncrossing. And I remember it was a Saturday. And as we were walking through the town, we saw\nJews coming back from dovening there. They \u2014",
        "A: No. No. cause we were Christians.",
        "A: But the Jews recognized us as Jews. So we ended up in the town jail for crossing the border\nillegally. But remember Hungary was not under German control yet. So what I remember about\nthat Saturday is that the Jewish population of the town started sending us food into the jail. And\nwe ended up with about 20 or 30, there weren\u2019t many of us. I said the group was only about six\nor seven people, eight people. We ended up with about 20 or 30 pots of cholent. For the first\ntime since the bad times during the war started, the first time since 1941, I stuffed myself.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: Yes. The usually kiddie stuff.",
        "A: Yeah, no, no.",
        "A: Right. Did I have cholent. Very different cholent from the Polish cholent. Cause they used\nbeans. The Polish cholent does not use beans. Or at least not our type of Polish.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yeah so we had been transported from the border basically to a larger town in. From the\nlarger town, eventually to Budapest.",
        "A: And we were being transported to Budapest on a passenger train, not the cattle cars or\nanything like that but regular passenger train. Mother was sitting. It was a passenger train so we\nwere being guarded by the Hungarian police, but we were not in chains or anything. So we were\njust being transported from one jail to another jail but the jail in the capital.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: Yeah in the capital in Budapest. From this \u2014",
        "A: She was 27 years older than I am so at the time I was eight years old, she was 34. That sort of\nthing. Now the idea was to get \u2014 one of the people in the group that we were with when we had\ncrossed the border had a relative in Budapest. Now how do we get information to them that\nwe\u2019re around, help. So one of the people had a sheet of paper and a pencil on him. So mother\nasked him to write down the name of the person and the address. And on the back she wrote in\nGerman, we are here, giving the names of the people in the group. Help. You know with the\nname of the relative of the one person in the group, Huhum. So what do you do with it? She\nmade believe she had a headache and sort of leaned down on the, in the railroad carriage. It was\nthird class carriage. Stuffed the note into the shoe of the man who was sitting next to her, hoping\nfor the best. And \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, complete stranger. The guy sort of looked at her and she gave him a sign, don\u2019t say\nanything because the guards were sitting in the aisle behind them. One of the guards, anyway.\nAnd so they brought us to the Hungarian civilian, this was a civilian jail. Basically mother had,\nin the letter mother sent see if you can arrange for us to be accepted as political refugees. We\nhad all, we all had papers as Christians at that point. But the Polish paper. And after about three\nor four weeks 1n jail, it worked. So now we were Polish refugees in Hungary.",
        "A: Yeah. The men and women were separated obviously but eight year old kid. I was allowed to\nstay with my mother.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: Oh yeah. Distinct memories.",
        "A: Mother\u2019s nightgown was stolen. And she, all we had was one small suitcase and mother\ncarried a, and you couldn\u2019t have changes of underpants, underwear or anything so you had to\nwash everything. So when she washed her nightgown at one point. One of the fellow gypsy,\nfellow prisoners, a gypsy lady stole it. The reason that we know that she stole it, cause mother\nrecognized it on her. So mother reported it and they asked her to take it off and mother said\nforget it.",
        "A: The relative of one of our fellow pass, one of our fellow, one of the people in the group,\narranged a, with their relative to have us recognized as political refugees and we were taken\naway, were released from prison. And what do we do? So there was a restaurant in Budapest.\nAnd I don\u2019t know how mother found out about it where there was a gathering place, essentially\nfor people like us. Refugees. And there you could arrange all sorts of things. And we were\naccepted as political refugees, sent to a small village in Hungary. And they couldn\u2019t keep\neverybody in Budapest. Everybody wanted to stay 1n Budapest but they couldn\u2019t keep\neverybody there.",
        "A: Erich Cherta [ph]. Near Kolorcha [ph]. Kolorcha is sort of almost in the center of\nHungary. And this was a small village. The train goes straight south from Budapest to I think the\nbranch station was Kishkarev [ph]. The names are meaningless. And from there you take\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014\nanother train to Kolorcha and on the way to Kolorcha, there was this little village where we\nended up. And this was \u2014",
        "A: Well we were on our own. We rented a room.",
        "A: Oh yeah absolutely. Church, going to church every \u2014",
        "A: Absolutely. Absolutely. On one occasion a Polish priest, because a lot of Poles were in\nHungary at the time. Not a lot but \u2014 in our village for example there were, our village. I mean the\nvillage where we stayed. There were maybe 15, 20 other people, 20 to 30, Polish. Real Polish.\nSo there was a Polish priest who came to visit. Keeping track of the faithful.",
        "A: He didn\u2019t question us. I mean he wanted me to be altar boy. So I think he, I ended up\nescaping from that. He used one of the Hungarian altar boy.",
        "A: He performed mass in Polish and we were there.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I mean he may have but he didn\u2019t let on. Ok, he didn\u2019t let on. He came to\nvisit. We spent a very nice hour or two with him. Nice guy. But he didn\u2019t let on. If he knew, he\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014\ndidn\u2019t let on. We were not prospective parishioners but we were fellow expatriates type of thing.\nAnd \u2014",
        "A: I\u2019m trying to think. It was five months, six months. And it was a matter of months.",
        "A: Then we were told that all the Polish people were being shipped off and we didn\u2019t know what\nthat meant. So it was a question again of going back to Budapest and disappearing. Now\ndisappearing was pulling off a disappearing act like that was not trivial. Because if you wanted\nto rent a, you didn\u2019t rent an apartment. You rented a bed. I remember the Hungarian the ad, the\nadvertisements. Bed for rent which meant that you literally rented a bad in somebody\u2019s\napartment. Odge Kiando [ph], Hungarian phrase for bed for rent.",
        "A: Sure you have to say something and try to make contact with the Jewish organization and\nthere was, I mentioned there was a restaurant. And again I don\u2019t know how mother found out\nabout it. And she could do miracles. Anyway she found out about it. We went there and she\nmade contact. And at that point, the Joint kicked in. Because it was, she started being able to get\nmoney. There was no money. She had one five dollar bill from before the war which she kept\nthrough the worst of all possible times. She kept it in the heel of her shoe. But that was basically\nthe only thing we had. So at that point money started coming in. Enough to, for us to be able to\nrent an apartment and to live on. And living essentially meant having a loaf of bread for\nbreakfast type of thing. And because there were no cooking privileges. When you rent a bed,\nthere are no cooking privileges. So for lunch we would have to go to restaurants. And it was kind\nof fun. Hungarian was primitive. Mother\u2019s Hungarian was very primitive. My Hungarian was\nprimitive. I had learned. You know kids learn. Kids learn quickly. So one interesting episode\nfrom that period in regard to food. You can\u2019t eat the same thing all the time. So we were trying\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014\nnew dishes every so often. So on one occasion, lecho. Let\u2019s try lecho. After you try everything\nelse and we were basically ordering. Every so often we would order two plates but occasionally\nwe would order one plate. There was just not enough money to, so we order the lecho.",
        "A: A dish for which you need a fire extinguisher. I think it\u2019s rice based or corn based. I\u2019m not\nsure. I don\u2019t remember the prime ingredient. Actually it\u2019s very good. After the war at it was\nexcellent but at that time, on that one occasion, just couldn\u2019t eat it. But you know the Hungarian\nrestaurants at that time, the restaurants in Budapest were perfectly satisfactory. So the important\nthing was to find one that was cheap and often. And the one that was cheap enough to find items\non the menu that were cheap enough. So the money would last.",
        "A: I saw Jews in Hungary in 1942, yes. In 1942.",
        "A: 40 yes sorry. 42 we were in hiding. And at that time, Jews in Hungary were still alright. But\nnot for long. Cause June 44, Horthy Miklos resigned. And Germans essentially took over the\ncountry.",
        "A: Well, before that we saw quite a few Jews. And every time mother had the opportunity, Jews\nwith beards. I mean the Jewish there were \u2014 and every time mother had the chance to talk to one\nof them, she said get away from here. Hide. When the Germans come in, they\u2019Il make your life\nmiserable. And the answer was invariably not here. I never realized that \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: Well the level of worry.",
        "A: Yes, refugees yes. We were accepted as refugees by the Hungarian government. As political\nrefugees. There is only one problem. I was circumcised. So the danger lay in somebody saying I\nsuspect you\u2019re Jewish. Drop your pants. You know so that the game is up. Because the\nChristians at that time, invariably were not circumcised. It\u2019s not like the United States now. So\nthat was the dangerous part. But as long as that didn\u2019t happen, we were fine.",
        "A: Until January of 45. When the Russians came in.",
        "A: Yeah. Well part of the time we lived in the village, some from Budapest, Erich Cherta, I think\nI mentioned that.",
        "A: No, no, no. The arrangements were just a few hours. But we stayed in the village for a few\nmonths.",
        "A: Erich Cherta, on the way between Kishkarev and Kolorcha. It was side spur.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: It\u2019s a north, south line.",
        "A: No, we were liberated in Budapest because at that time what was happening basically is that\nfor some reason, the stay in the village got iffy. It wasn\u2019t, we didn\u2019t feel right. There were\nsearches. They suspected that some of the people were Jews. So the simplest thing to do was to\ndisappear.",
        "A: And disappear meant basically go back to Budapest.",
        "A: And live as Polish refugees in Budapest. But you have to register with the police, give an\naddress and people were not allowed to rent you even a bed more than one night if you hadn\u2019t\nregistered with the police. And you had to have proof that you registered with the police by\nfilling out a form and getting a little piece of the form torn off with a police stamp. So there were\ntwo levels of hiding. One was if you lived for example at 37 Kiriutsa. You put down 7 Kiriutsa.\nReported to the police, got it stamped and then added the three. So present it to the landlord,\nperfectly legitimate but the police still didn\u2019t know exactly where you were. And on one\noccasion that saved us because the city was big but the neighborhoods were small. So we were\nwalking into our apartment. Somebody came up to us and said the police was looking for you,\nbut they were looking for you at \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: Down the street. Why were they looking for you down the street? No idea. So we\nskedaddled back to, packed a small suitcase and disappeared immediately.",
        "A: Ah. The last few days before liberation were \u2014 ah, well we were very happy at the time. But it\nwasn\u2019t that for the population as a whole. It wasn\u2019t a very happy time because even when we\nwere in the village. The village was just south of, about a hundred kilometers or so, south of\nBudapest. And throughout a good chunk of 1944 I could see the bombers. You know this was,\nthis lasted for what seemed like hours. The overflight lasted for what seemed like hours. And\nthey were coming I think from air bases in North Africa or Italy. \u2019'm not sure where. And just\ndropping major loads on Budapest.",
        "A: Well not in the village. In the village I still didn\u2019t encounter them. Then when we went back\nto Budapest, it was essentially a question of spending a good chunk of every night in the air raid\nshelter. You know as far as we were concerned, they could bomb the hell out of the city as long\nas they didn\u2019t hit our building and towards the end \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. Towards the end the bombing got very dense. I mean I was right, I was on the ground\nfloor of the building, a five story building and a 50 kilo bomb hit the top floor. Right above me.\nSo the bomb penetrated the roof and one floor, but it was only a 50 kilo bomb so the roof, the\nceiling of the, and the floor of that apartment was enough to slow it down. It wasn\u2019t a high\nexplosive so. But it was scary. I mean the ceiling started to shedding dust.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: Oh yeah. My hero.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember any specific words. I\u2019d have to think about that.",
        "A: Russian soldiers, well we were in the basement of the building. But basically all of life moved\ndown to the basement. For food basically we had ten pounds of beans. And mother cooked beans\nin water. That was our food three times a day. Twice a day. We didn\u2019t eat three times a day. She\nmanaged to get the beans by essentially walking into the back of a store, grocery store and the\nowner of the store took pity on us and basically sold us, I can give you some beans. Ok, we\u2019ll\nbuy beans and that kept us going for, towards the end of the, until liberation.",
        "A: Yeah the liberation essentially the first sign of liberation was a lot of shooting. The fighting.\nAnd then when that quieted down a squad of Romanian soldiers walked up. And they stayed\novernight and then moved on. But the Romanian soldiers, and I\u2019m not sure whether the\nRomanian soldiers were a German rear guard. Or the Russian advance troops. That I don\u2019t\nremember any more. I think they were part of the Russian advance. And then we started seeing\nRussian soldiers. With a red star and you know the Russian cap. Flap up and then the, very\ngood they were excellent design. I have one like that. Not enough, not from that period but \u2014",
        "A: Oh absolutely, absolutely. It meant no more Germans.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: No, there wasn\u2019t very much to celebrate. Just celebrate, just being happy to have survived.\nMajor worry about what happened to the rest of the family. Major worry about is father alive?\nFather didn\u2019t go into hiding with us because he was with his friend.",
        "A: Tried to make contact with other \u2014",
        "A: Jews, other refugees. We were in contact with some but you know staying in Budapest was no\nlong term solution.",
        "A: The general idea was that Bucharest was in much better shape. That had been liberated\nmonths earlier and apparently the life was much more stable so.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. There were transports being organized for Polish refugees, essentially going back\nto Poland, by way of Bucharest. And we basically stayed in Bucharest.",
        "A: Eventually yes. But after, after a few months in Bucharest.",
        "A: And then back to Poland.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Nothing. As a matter of fact we were advised strongly against going back to Skala because a\nlot of Jews who were coming back were killed by the Poles.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t because we basically went back. We saw there were no Jews and we skedaddled.\nSo it was just a short visit.",
        "A: No, not after Poland, no. After Poland we went to Germany.",
        "A: A small town first in east Germany and east Germany was under communists so that was not\na happy long term solution so we went to West Germany, to Munich first. And then Bad\nReichenhall which was a small town near Berchtesgaden. A summer resort, a summer and\nwinter resort, not far from Berchtesgaden. And then Bad Reichenhall we stayed til 1951.",
        "A: Well Bad Reichenhall had also had a DP camp so we were in the DP camp for a few months.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well there was a small Jewish community in Bad Reichenhall and there was a person who\nwas teaching me a little bit so the bar mitzvah was basically Aliyah. I was called up to the Torah\nand my father, my stepfather sponsored the Kiddush in the shul.",

        "A: Stayed in Germany so first I had private tutoring until 1948 and then in 48 started regular\nschool. And I was pretty much caught up with \u2014 because of my private tutor. He was a fantastic\ntutor. He had been assistant, well private docent. I don\u2019t know what that, that would be\nessentially somewhere between instructor and assistant professor at the University of Breslau. He\nwas at loose ends so and he was tutoring a friend of mine. There were only two or three kids my\nage at Bad Reichenhall in the town, not in the DP camp, but in the town. Eventually we moved\nout of the camp into the town. So he was a tutor for one of my friends. I basically asked him\nwhether he would be interested in tutoring me also. He said yes, so he and father made\narrangements as to how much and all that. I wasn\u2019t involved in that. But he started tutoring me.",

        "A: Mother\u2019s sister, younger sister had married after the war, remarried after the war because her\nhusband was killed during the war. And her second husband had relatives in Worcester.",
        "A: Yeah. So they moved to Worcester and since, at that point, we had relatives in Worcester, we\ncame to Worcester.",
        "A: [had had one year of English with my tutor.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: Well America was the promised land basically.",
        "A: Yes. USS General Blatchford. A troop transport. A literally, a small one.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Absolutely, the night before.",
        "A: You better believe it, you\u2019d better believe it. I stayed on the deck for hours. Just staring at\nthe Statue of Liberty and we sailed right by the Statue of Liberty. The ship docked somewhere on\n30\" Street, in the 30s. At that point, of course the Statue of Liberty was no longer visible. But\nwas visible at dusk. And that was an unbelievable sight.",
        "A: We had two boxes and my mother had already married Oscar at that time.",
        "A: That was thrilling. That was unbelievable. That was incredible. I was standing at the railing\nthe night before, just looking at cars going by on the shore. The ship, before it got into dock, I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014\nhad to go through several steps. Sort of waiting in line for the dock to clear or something like\nthat. I\u2019m not sure how it worked.",
        "A: Yes, the boat was full of refugees.",
        "A: Very few. Very few.",
        "A: No, no we got to Worcester, the Jewish agency was very helpful at that point. Somebody\nfrom the Jewish agency met us, took us to a cheap hotel, very cheap hotel. Three dollars a night\ntype of thing. And we knew some people in New York who had immigrated a year or two earlier\nso we met them. And organized to have the boxes shipped to Worcester and after a few days we\ntook a train to Worcester.",
        "A: Yes for a little while. Then we rented our own apartment.",
        "A: Absolutely. High school in Worcester Massachusetts.",
        "A: Oh yeah. After that life started getting very normal.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: Occasionally but not \u2014",
        "A: Probably but again I didn\u2019t notice any special treatment.",
        "A: Oh yeah, absolutely.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah but you know the need to do well was overwhelming.",
        "A: Yeah so basically I hit the books. I needed to prove myself.",
        "A: Well because you know as a refugee kid, you sort of realize that things aren\u2019t going to be\nhanded to you on a silver platter. So parents made it very clear that it was essential for me to go\nto a university and in order to get accepted to the university you had to have good grades. The\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014\nguidance counselors were excellent. There was only one who wasn\u2019t outstanding and that one\nbasically, you\u2019re a refugee kid. Why don\u2019t you take the kind of subjects that will make it easier\nfor you to learn a trade.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Not really. I had a job.",
        "A: Not a regular full time job. But a regular part time job. I worked four hours a day.",
        "A: Well initially I was soda fountain attendant. And after that I got a high paying job as a pants\npresser. Not a finishing presser, but a, I was doing the inseam. They hired me at I think 55 cents,\nno not 55. 75 cents an hour. You know once they saw that I could do things my salary went up\nto one fifteen an hour and that was unheard of wealth. So at four hours a day I was making five,\nalmost five dollars.",
        "A: Yep.",
        "A: Well then became, then my life became essentially perfectly normal North American life.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: Worcester Poly, Worcester Polytechnic Institute.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Princeton for two, well I got my PhD in three years.",
        "A: In Princeton, physical chemistry. Chemistry.",
        "A: Post doc. I stayed on in Princeton for a year, with the same professor, doing a different kind\nof work than the graduate work. And then a year in Switzerland. Well nine months in\nSwitzerland. On a NATO post-doctoral fellowship.",
        "A: Nice. I could speak the language. I knew, it wasn\u2019t a problem. I didn\u2019t quite understand\ninitially. I didn\u2019t understand what they were saying to me because it was Switzer Deutsche. It\nwasn\u2019t my kind of German.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: Initially German or Polish. Mostly German but occasionally we would switch. Depending on\nwhat we were talking about so it was essentially a bilingual existence. And after a while they got\nto be very good in English.",
        "A: By themselves, they always spoke Yiddish. But with me it was Yiddish or Polish, German.\nMostly, I think mostly German. No, it was Yiddish. Mostly Yiddish.",
        "A: This is no, no sorry, yes, it was Switzerland, not Worcester. Switzerland was 61.",
        "A: Then I got an assistant professorship at UCLA, taught there for four or five years. No 62,\nsorry. After the one year, post-doctoral year in Switzerland, 1t was assistant professorship at\nUCLA for five years. And then I got an associate professorship at McGill.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. And retired from there.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: Oh yeah. Once too many. Married first time in 57, high school sweetheart and all that. It was\na disaster. That ended in 83, I think. In Montreal.",
        "A: Yes. Eliot.",
        "A: I thought about that every so often. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I like to play scenarios in my\nmind but it\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: What if is not an exact science.",
        "A: German uniforms.",
        "A: It makes me hate. I realize, rationally I realize perfectly well that the Germans today are very\ndifferent group of people from the Germans that I \u2014",
        "A: Ah. Rationally I think a lot better of the Germans today than of the Poles today because the\nPoles were \u2014 you know very mixed feelings about Poland also because it was Polish people who\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014\nsaved my life but by the same token it was Polish people who were responsible for the death of\nmost of my family. Polish part of the family. So and you know right now in going back, anti-\nsemitism never existed in Poland, according to the Polish version. The Germans acknowledge\nwhat happened and made moves to get over it. But Poland never acknowledged the anti-\nSemitism and anti-Semitism was vicious. And I remember numerable times getting beaten up.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: No. it wasn\u2019t, yeah \u2014",
        "A: Horse manure was thrown at me. You know stuff like that. And the frequency with which I\nwas called Poshavezhedia. Scabby Jew. And this, it was, you could see that it was gut level\nanti-Semitism. And when we were living as Christians, part of the time that we were living as\nChristians, going to church and all that, the sermons, insofar as they dealt with Jews were not\nviciously anti-Semitic but they were intellectually anti-Semitic. Not every one of them,\nobviously. Not every priest. But I have no love for the Catholic church.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Scientific meetings.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: Very negative initially, very negative initially and then after a day or two. Anti-Semitism in\nPoland probably is not much worse than anti-Semitism in many other places. It probably is but it\nis worse than the other places that I visit but maybe it\u2019s because I understand the language and I\nknow them better. You know and we lived in Germany after the war. I had German friends,\ngood German friends. I kept in touch with them for many years.",
        "A: Yeah. With Germany I find it easier to, I find it much easier to deal with Germans than with\nPoles. Not because the people I\u2019m likely to meet were responsible for anything dealing with the\nHolocaust. It\u2019s just the instinctive feeling is very negative.",
        "A: Religiously.",
        "A: Religiously, I like to think of myself as an orthodox atheist. I feel most comfortable in terms\nof synagogue attendance I am most comfortable in an orthodox environment, to the point even\northodox or even Chasidic environment. Intellectually I\u2019m an atheist.",
        "A: Yes. He got a, yes, he went to \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: Not Hebrew school but he went to a school, a Jewish \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, day school.",
        "A: Yeah. First a non-religious one and then later on a more religious one.",
        "A: Yeah, very much so.",
        "A: I wish we could put the whole country in it. No, you know there were obviously a lot of very\ngood Germans. Even if they kept quiet. I mean again keeping quiet is not shameful. I don\u2019t\nknow what I would have done, that\u2019s all I, I don\u2019t want to say anything about the people who\nkept quiet and disappeared into the background. But I have no love lost for Germany. I try to\navoid going back to Germany. Not because the present day Germans are responsible for anything\nthat happened then, but because of what it evokes, cause of what it evokes.",
        "A: Very positive.",
        "A: Yeah. Have relatives.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: Yes. I go Israel almost every, I'd say average every two years. Going back there in September\nof this year again. Very positive, very strong. We lived in Israel for a year at the Weismann\nhouse. I was on sabbatical at the Weismann Institute. Not quite a year.",
        "A: I hesitate to think of it as an advantage in any way shape or manner.",
        "A: If [had my choice would I rather have been older? Is that the \u2014",
        "A: No, I was aware fairly early. In 1942 I started seeing the first bodies, when I was seven years\nold. My grandparents were murdered when I was in 1940, when I was seven years old.",
        "A: It taught me to hate the Germans. And it took a major effort of will to realize that not every\nGerman was a Nazi. Right now I\u2019ve come to terms with it, but and then you know we lived in\nGermany for a while. The late 40s so. Living essentially in the enemy camp was a major\nproblem initially. Starting to go to a German school initially was a major problem, but as time\nwent by, I made friends among the German kids in class and I was in touch with at least one of\nthem for quite a few years.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: I think it matters right now.",
        "A: Yeah, but not the kind of connection that makes conversation easier. There is a bond but, and\nyou know. Let me put it this way. When I go to a meeting and \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. And one of the speakers is Jewish, do I necessarily go to his talk in preference to\nsomebody who is non Jewish. Not really. I mean the kind of feeling, well yeah it\u2019s nice that a\nJew made it, is doing such nice work. But that\u2019s about it.",
        "A: Not while I\u2019m doing science, no. It\u2019s, I mean it\u2019s basically it\u2019s nice that a Jew is doing such\nnice work.",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t say more but I also wouldn\u2019t say less. It doesn\u2019t change my --",
        "A: Yes, yeah.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: Yes, but I didn\u2019t do it very often. My way of getting 1t out of my system was in the 50s, early\n50s, I started writing things down. Everything I remembered.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s all written up.",
        "A: Well I bound it, hand written notes. I made a copy. I then bound both. I did 48, 39 to 45 and\n45 to 51.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I never get that feeling. It was very personal. That\u2019s why I can\u2019t bring myself to feel\ncomfortable in Germany. In spite of having lived there for five years. And in spite of, I have no\nproblems for example talking to scientists from Germany.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. I think the Germans try to avoid that period. And nobody else is interested.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It\u2019s appropriate to have holocaust museums wherever they spring up. And you know even\nnow, what good would it do to have a holocaust museum in every small town in Germany? The\nGerman kids are no different from the French kids and the Spanish kids. Can\u2019t hold them\nresponsible for anything. It\u2019s important for them to know and as far as I know, I have very good\nGerman friends, professional friends. And they tell me that the youngsters get taught about the\nHolocaust. And in considerable detail. He even said sometimes they say, they tell me it\u2019s too\nmuch. But I don\u2019t say anything in a situation like that.",
        "A: More, sympathies very much so. In terms of the sympathies. In terms of action, I can\u2019t say\nthat I was very active.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: Not really. But I didn\u2019t go to Selma or anything like that. I was too worried about getting\ntenure.",
        "A: Yes, so the sympathies were, for the civil \u2014 but not to the point where I joined the ACLU.\nPaid my dues for a number of years. But it wasn\u2019t a major part of my life.",
        "A: Yes, Eliot has a daughter.",
        "A: 13 now. No, 14.",
        "A: Thaven\u2019t thought about it. Let me think about that. I\u2019m trying to think how, what my\nexperiences in the Holocaust would in any way help. And, not really. She\u2019s living in the States\nand that\u2019s the best of all possible \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, people here don\u2019t appreciate what they have. At least, a lot of people do but a lot of\npeople don\u2019t. A lot of people take it for granted and by the United States, I mean general\ndemocratic countries.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: Depends who. Germans have. The rest of the world, probably not. What they have learned is\nif you\u2019re going to kill out a group of people, do it quietly. Don\u2019t leave traces. You see a lot of\nthis in Asia for example. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a situation that can\u2019t happen again but I think it\u2019s a\nsituation that we have to be careful, careful in the sense of watch out for. I think it can happen\nagain. It\u2019s very tempting if you don\u2019t like someone to kill them. And especially if you can get\nahold of their goodies. Right now, more of it\u2019s going on in Asia than anywhere else or in Africa.\nBut there are islands of hatred in Europe that are still burning bright. Thinking of Yugoslavia for\nexample. So from that point of view, some Europeans have learned a lot from World War Two.\nA lot have learned less. And amnesia is beginning to settle in. There\u2019s not much we can do about\nit. If they don\u2019t want to learn. So I think the only way to protect oneself against that sort of thing\nis to do exactly what Israel is doing. To provide stockpiles of atomic weapons. Hopefully never\nto use them but then your enemies know that you have them.",
        "A: Well I didn\u2019t become a Canadian citizen for quite a while. I became a Canadian citizen but it\ntook a while.",
        "A: Sure. In the States I became an American citizen sort of five minutes after I was eligible.",
        "A: Thrilling.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 29, 2014",
        "A: No, because it wasn\u2019t practical. They were living in a different town so the applications. We\nall lived in Worcester initially. But then they moved to Leonia, New Jersey. And I stayed in\nWorcester to finish college.",
        "A: Yes, in Worcester.",
        "A: In some ways, yes but it wasn\u2019t a very \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, it was emotional for a few minutes. Well more than a few minutes, but not \u2014 it wasn\u2019t\noverwhelming. I mean this was not the most important part of my life.",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "A: Absolutely. I feel American.",
