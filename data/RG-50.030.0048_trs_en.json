        "Q: Would you tell me your name, please?",
        "A: My name 1s Stefania Podgorska.",
        "Q: And when and where were your born?",
        "A: I was born In Poland, the place called Lipa. That is like a village.",
        "Q: Near where 1s it? Near a big city?",
        "A: Oh, that is close to, to the city called Bircza. And when I was born, sometimes hard to say\nbecause I never saw my certificate birth. So what mother told me at that time I was 16. So I\nhave to believe that. And during the war I went to, to city hall, and I made papers because I\nneed it. So I told what mother told me, so I am going with these papers until now.",
        "Q: Um-hm. Ok, fair enough.",
        "A: But really when I don't know. I don't need it know. Absolutely.",
        "Q: No. No, you don\u2019t. Tell me about your parents. What, what did your father do? How -- what\nwas your life like as a child with them?",
        "A: Well, life was very good. My father and mother, you see, they didn't talk about too much\nwith, with children about what happened, how. But what I heard, that my grandfather\nreceived from some king a big possession, big land and home for some heroic things, but I\ndon't know what. And because the parents did tell. So we had, we had a lot of land and big\nhome, building, big. And what I remember...the people worked on the land, and the parents\npaid them, and, and I was little girl. So I remember also we had a lot of horses -- I think six\nhorses was, and a lot of animals, cows and chickens, what I hated. And we played around,\nrunning around; and, and that's all what was.\nThen maybe a year before war, father died. Yes. So mother was with us, and mostly sisters,\ntwo sisters older. They went to the city. They found the work there, and they worked. And\nthen I was maybe 12 years of age, I visit my sister with my mother, and I love it. They, they\nwork in Przemysl, where I was later; and when I came there first time, I don't know. I love\ncity. And I told to mother, \"Maybe I will stay.\" Mother said, \"No. You're too young.\" And I\nwanted to stay, but they didn't let me. But a few months later, I was visit again, with mother,\nmy sisters. So I said -- start to cry, and then I said to mother, \"I have to stay. I will not go\nback.\" You know, I don't know, maybe that was my destiny. I really don't know, but I hated\non the village this noise of the chickens and cows. I tell you, really, exactly at 12 o'clock at\nnight, roosters start to crow. Oy, that\u2019s makes me nervous. And in the morning, early in the\nmorning, chickens say \u201cCock-cock-cock-cock-cock\u201d That makes me nervous. So when I\nvisit the second time my sisters, was for me city was very quiet and was beautiful, and I start\nto cry, and I said to mother, \"I have to stay. I will not go back there.\" So was no rooster at\nnight that did crow.",
        "Q: How old were you at this time?",
        "A: I think I was maybe 12 or 13. So my sister said, \"Ok, if--\" she said to mother, \" --1f she\nwanted to stay, she can stay. We have apartment. Not too big, but she can stay. We will find\nfor her some light, not too difficult work, and she will work. She can be not lazy here.\" So\nmother said, \"Ok, but how will it be with school?\" So I said to mother, \"Well, I will see later.\nNow is vacation.\" So I stayed with her, my sister. Mother returned. And older sister Mary,\nshe found work for me in some bakery. So I was putting the rolls and bread on the shelves,\nbut sometimes was too heavy for me. So one day sister came, and she saw and she said,\n\"Well, I will look something else for you. And that was special some woman who looks for a\nwork for a girl or some sister. And I went to her; and she said, \"Oh, for this little girl, I will\nthink I will have the work.\" And she went with me to some shop; and that was older woman,\na little corpulent, and a small shop with everything. And she saw me, and they talked\ntogether with this woman, and she said, \u201cWell, I, I really don't know the price,\u201d\u2019 what she\nwanted to pay me. Because she talked to this woman, and this woman later talked to my\nsister. So then she said I can stay with her, ok. And that was mother of present my husband,\nyes. And after few days, really she start to laughing, because, you see, I was young and I was\njumping, running, singing, dancing. And she was lonely. She had four sons, and they -- some\nworks. The other went to school, and husband was at home. He was old. So she was in this\nlittle shop alone, and lonely. But she said one day that I brought life to her life, to this little\nshop. So sometimes I was jumping through the -- these tables and, and she was -- sometimes\nshe tried to do also a little exercise, because she was sitting all day behind this, this, this\ndesk. And, and what I saw this part was too big.\nAnd sometimes, sometimes she had it difficult to go out; because it was really -- I don't\nknow how many years she was sitting there and that gathered all this fat. And also, when I\nstart to sell things went, came sometimes young people, and especially boys. I sell them\nchocolates. And some day, I gave them one. They said, \"Two.\" Ok. I gave them two, and\nthey paid for two. And some, they gave me, one for them. So how many chocolate I can eat?\nSo I put back. And she said, \"That is a double!\" I make money double for her, because I -- I\nam selling twice the same chocolate. So, you see. And I worked there maybe a year. And\nthen one day, I had enough. So, was too boring. And I found another work. And 1n a few\ndays I walked through this street and close to her shop, and she saw me. She called, and she\nstart to cry. She embraced me. And she said, \u201cIt is so sad in this little shop,\u201d and she's lonely,\nand she will double my pension and if I will return back. I said, \"I will see.\" And she said, \"T\n-- | cannot live without you.\" You see, sometimes her friends...she had a daughter, but\nsomething happened. Her daughter was sick, and she was in hospital; and some her friend,\nthey thought I am her daughter. Sometimes she said, \u201cYes, I am her daughter.\u201d So -- and she,\nshe really -- she was lonely. And so, why I said to you, I, I was jumping, dancing. And she\nsometimes she would smile all day. And then I returned back to her. And so I work with her.\nSometimes in the morning, when was not clients, so I run to her home back to bring her\nsome lunch. Something. Sometimes I ran to, to the market. I make some shopping, because\nthe husband was not capable to, to do that. For me that was fun. Run out.",
        "Q: What happened as the war began to draw near?",
        "A: When the war began, and so I still was there, there. And my sisters were, were -- mother\ncame one day, and they said.",
        "Q: Excuse me. How many sisters did, did you have?",
        "A: Six. That was six. Mother had six girls and two boys -- really, she had three boys. One died.\nThat was later. Stayed two boys and six girls. That's a lot! So when war start, so I work,\nwork still there. And then my sisters lost the apartment, and I didn't have apartment. So this\nlady, she said, \"You can sleep in my house.\" But was no place, but it was little hole. And I\nsaid, \"Well, I can sleep here in this hole.\" So her husband, he make like a courtesan to cover\nmy bed, and that was rolling bed on the dirt at night. I make this bed, and daytime I put back\ntogether and to the corner. That was all. And that was few months. Then war start; and , the -\n- her sons and came German first. Her sons ran away to another city, to Lvov called, because\ncloser to Russia. Because all youngsters they wanted to run away from Germany to the\nRussia. And they went there, to Lvov, and they couldn't go farther. So after, I think, few\nweeks they returned back, and Russia came. And Russia conquered this part. But the other\npart, after the river San, that was still German. So this lady was very afraid what will be if\nGermany will come back.",
        "Q: What was it like under the Russian occupation?",
        "A: Well, that was normal. That was normal. Only difficult was with language. So that was few\nweeks was German. So on the street, mostly I was running on the street to buy some bread,\nto buy milk, everything. Was no shop or market, \"Star Market\" or \"Stop and Shop\" like here.\nJust on the street from the village women. So we were buying milk or butter, or something\nlike that. So mostly in the morning, I was on the street running to, to, to buy everything.\nSoon I heard on the street Germans speaking and so, German soldiers. Came Russia, just\nRussian soldiers and the Russian language. For me, was not really different because some\nfriends, they said, \"Well, now we have Russia. We don't know, maybe later we will have\nsomebody else. We have to use, be use to that.\" And our life start to be again normal. And\nshops were opened, and I was still living with my old lady in this shop. And then start again\nwar, again fighting, fighting; and again Germans were coming. And again these sons were\nrunning to the Russia border and to on the way to the Russia. Again to the Lvov. And so\ncame German and start to segregate people. And also after the few weeks, the sons returned\nback because the German were there also. So was no sense. They couldn't run away with the\nGer-- with the Russian soldiers. Something happened. I don't know why. They didn't run\naway there. So they coming back. And they, the German start to segregate people. They start\nto talk about all Jewish people start to wear this arm bands with stars. So for me that was\nsomething strange because I, I didn't know why the Germans start to segregate people, and\nwhy they mark these people with, with stars and white armbands. For me, this -- and for all\nour friends, we sometimes talked and we said what happened. After war -- before war -- was\neverything all right, really together; and we were all friends, more or less. But we were\nfriends. And now when Germans came to the country, they start to segregate people. So\nsometimes we were very disagreed with that, but we couldn't do nothing.\nSo then -- and you see, maybe why I later also helped, because when Germans were -- I'm\nsorry. I'm jumping so with.... So, on the street one day I walked, and I was surprised\neverything, some people start to talk something wrong about that. About Germans, war and,\nand when walked, some boy -- Jewish boy -- maybe 10 years of age, and the other boy was\nnot a Jew, and the other boy start to a little yell at this Jewish boy. And what -- so ordinary\nworker man, maybe 30 -- and he asked this boy, \"Why you yell at him?\" And this boy said,\n\"Well, be--because he is a Jew.\" And this man said, \"What he is a Jew? Look at him. He 1s\nthe same like you. You see he is not difference. Just German makes difference. Before was\nno difference. Look at him. He is a Jew, ok? Because that is his people gave this name -- a\nJew -- like you has the name of Pole. Every -- some groups, they give themselves some\nname. But look at him --the same skin like yours, like mine, like all of these people. The\nsame color of hair -- some are, some are darker, some are blonde. That depend.\" And said,\n\"And what that he's a Jew? You have to be friendly.\" That now is a war; and war will finish,\nand we will be all again friendly. And these boys, and, and this man said, \"Shake the\ntogether hands. Be friends.\" And for me that was something also new. You see, I looked and\nI said, \"Of course, we are the same.\" And you will laugh, but when I came home I looked at\nmy skin. Because I, I have no, no chance to educate myself about people. Was, was no, no\ntelevision -- like today, you can hear television, you can listen and people are talking. But\nwasn't that time. Radio some only people had. So, I, I just learned what I heard on the street.\nThat's all was.\nSo later I was surprised also that Germans segregate people. They start to talk about ghetto,\nand, and they made the ghetto. I helped to moved this -- my old lady with sons, with\nhusband, to move to ghetto. We, we are carrying a little something -- a chair not too heavy,\nsome luggages, some valises -- and they advised me also to, to find for myself some room.\nFor me, especially, with my name. I really didn't know where to look, but they told me, they\nshow me. And the same apartment, that was one room separate. And her husband told me\nwhere to go, and I went there. I brought paper. And he filled up everything, so I went there\nback to the city hall, and of building apartment. And they gave me permission for this one\nroom. And I was so proud that I have my own room.",
        "Q: How old were you at this time?",
        "A: I think, at, at that time, I was maybe 17, maybe 16, 17 -- something like that, yes. So I had\nmy own room; and I was proud, very proud. So they went to ghetto. And all apartment, all\nthese building was empty, because there lived only Jews. And on the first floor, that was\nsome Catholic girl there. She lived there a long time ago. And sometimes we are laughing.\nWe came together, and she said -- she was older, she was maybe 21 -- and she said, \"Well,\nnow we are here host. We are owner of this building.\" And sometimes I was afraid, because I\nwas alone on the third floor. Was nobody there. But you see, then one night, I heard that\npeople were taken from the ghetto to concentration camp. And one night I heard the\nscreaming, my old lady and her apartment at that was across, and that was her voice. And in\nthe morning, I ran to the ghetto. And I, I had my special hole there, under the screen, and I\nknew there a, a few policemen and few German policemen. I often were a guest around the\nghetto. They, they knew me.",
        "Q: I didn't understand. You had a hole where?\n101:23:57",
        "A: When I sneaked to the ghetto sometimes, that was -- the ghetto was around with barbed wire.",
        "Q: Oh, your apartment was outside of the ghetto?",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: You were not inside the ghetto?",
        "A: No, absolutely no.",
        "Q: Ok.",
        "A: I never was in the ghetto. I Just visit, yes. So when I ran to the ghetto, and I, I run to ghetto\nand I met there policeman who knew that me that I was very often there. And I told him I\nwanted to go inside. He said, \"You cannot go there. It is very dangerous.\" I said, \"I have to\ngo there! I have to visit my friend and tell him something.\" He said that was the -- they took\nthe people to the concentration camp, and some place. Anyway, it's very danger. You cannot\ngo there. And then came German policeman. I said, also, I didn't speak German, just few\nwords; but I told to this policeman, he Polish policeman -- he spoke very well German -- I\nsaid, told him that I've -- he have to disappear, and you, too, because I have to go to the\nghetto. And this German policeman said to me, \"Nein, nein, nein!\" He will not let me go\nthere. I said, \"I have to go there!\" And I said to this Po-- Polish policeman, \"Take him out\nsome place to the building, and you and go and disappear. Because I have to go there.\" And\nthey talked together and they went to some building. And I pulled out a little this screen, this\nwire, and I sneaked there and I went to, to their house, there to their apartment. So the\nparents that night were taken to the concentration camp. And because I heard screaming --\nthis lady, I heard voice -- because she cried that she left the children, and she didn't know\nwhat will be with her, with her husband. And they never returned back. And then again was\n\"Aktion;\"\u201d \"Aktion\" -- that called when they took the people to concentration camp. That\nwas the Aktion in the ghetto.",
        "Q: Describe it, please. When you were outside, did you get to see any of it?",
        "A: Oh, yes. I saw when they took it very often to the wagon, people. So that was bridge,\nconnected from this place where I lived to the other side, to the ghetto. Before that was no\nghetto. That was normal streets there. People lived. But that was the bridge through by the\ntrain were passing under, the bridge that was train, that was tracks. So very often I was\nstanding on this bridge with some my friends. So I saw them, how they took the people to\nthe trains, and the wagon left. And very often I went to the ghetto. I smuggled the food there,\nand sometimes they gave me there. So they, these four brothers, they didn't have any more\nparents. So they were alone. Then they took their other brother -- one brother also to the\nconcentration camp, to Lvov -- that was a camp. And I visited there several times. I was\nthere. That was camp not only for Jews. That was for Poles, for Ukraines -- Gypsy -- that\nwas mix-it camp. So that also was one a policeman took care there, and he guarded there. So\nI made friends with him. So he sometimes he went there, and he called this brother Isaac (ph)\n-- my husband will show picture, I think, is here. And I brought food sometimes to him, and\nmessage. And so, I was lucky. I don't know why really, but I made it friends with people.",
        "Q: Can you describe the camp?",
        "A: I wasn't inside. I just this, this policeman, he took me one day to inside. But there came other\nguard, and he said, \"It's forbidden to people from outside to bring inside to the camp.\" He\n' \u201cNo, no, no!\u201d (German).\n* Murderous campaigns undertaken for political, racial, or eugenic ends (German).\nsaid, \"I am here working. I will not let my wife come here, or somebody else.\" So I saw just\na little. So then this, this policeman said, \"Ok, come on out.\"",
        "Q: But you brought food with you?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Were you able to get it in to the --",
        "A: Yes, yes. They called, they called this Isaac (ph). They call, and he came to this special room\n-- visit room. So I gave sometimes shirt clean or underwear, or something like that. And food\nI gave. But I came one day, and I -- we make arrangement. And this Isaac (ph), he asked me\n-- he wanted to run away. And he asked me to bring some old glasses and pair of shoes, that\nhe will dress differently, like on the street. And he will run away when I will come next time.\nOk. So I came next time. I brought everything. But I was late, and maybe three hours,\nbecause on the, on that -- well, you don't know but during the war was nothing in time.\nWhen I went by trolley, so soldiers stopped the trolley; because that the Germans, they called\nNachschub.\u201d Germans army was passing. And for them, that was first way supposed to be,\nnot for civilian. Just for the soldiers. So the train was waiting maybe two hours. Then one\nhour took me to get there. And this Isaac (ph), he waited for me. And, was another, some\nwoman that was maybe similar to me. And he thought that that's me, that I am waiting there,\nand he ran from the camp. And some guard saw him and ran after him, and took him back.\nAnd I don't know what happened there; but anyway, he was dead. That everything told me,\nfew hours later. His friend, whom I knew, also, from the same city -- they were neighbors.\nAnd he said \u201cIsaac (ph) is dead.\u201d And he said how that happened. And so I gave him this\nbread? What I brought -- this food. And I gave him, and then I, I returned back. And that\nwhat, what happened. And you see, I returned back. And then again was Aktion 1n the\nghetto, and ghetto was smaller and smaller. And one day, one brother with his fianc\u00e9e, he\nworks in some on the field, field with some with some farmers. They worked. They\ncultivated some vegetables. And they knew if German will have, will finish this war, so they\nwill not needed them anymore. And next day, I heard that the -- again there's no more\nghettos -- so ghetto still was, but again they took a lot of people to the concentration camp.\nAnd then that time, they took present my husband and his brothers, and others people they\ntook. And like he said that on the way, he knew that they will not survive. They will go --\nthey, they were going to -- for a death. Nothing more. So he wanted to commit suicide. He --\nhe wanted to jump from running train, and he will be killed anyway. He wanted to commit\nsuicide. And he bro-- broked the barbed wire from the window, make a hole and he jumped.\nAnd he told his brother also to jump after him. That they will be killed, and they will not\nhave to go anymore to concentration camp. But he jumped, and he wasn't killed. And brother\ndidn't jump. What he said later, Joe, when he jumped he had a bread. And this bread, he\n\u00b0 Supplies, either personal or material (German).\ncovered it here on the chest. When he jumped, and he was slide because the, the, the force of\nthe air pushed him and he was slide. And he stopped on the post, some post, and the post hit\nhim here on the chest in exactly what was the bread. And he had big hole on the bread, but\nthis bread saved his chest.",
        "Q: It was a bag? I'm sorry. I don't understand.",
        "A: Bread.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Loaf of bread, he had here. And this bread, loaf of bread, saved his chest.",
        "Q: A loaf of bread? Ok.",
        "A: Yes. And when he woke up, the train was far away; and he looked and he didn't find his\nbrother. He didn't jump; but jumps other two people, some strange people. And he found\nthem. One was broken here, this clavicle area, however, so he helped him. The other man\njumped, young man. He had -- was broken something, hand here. So he helped them, and\nthey walked a little. And they went to some man that Joe knew him before war. They went\nsometimes to skiing. And he, this man, had like some little cafeteria, and they came to him,\nand Joe said, \"You remember me.\" So this man said, \"Oh, yes. I remember.\" But he said,\n\"You know, I am a Jew. And I jumped from the run-- running train that goes to the\nconcentration camp. So can you accept me? Can I stay here only one night?\" Because was\ncold. And he said, \"Ok, ok. You can stay.\" And he asked about friends. He said, \"Ok, stay\nwith your friends.\" And they let him stay and give what he could, some warm coffee and\nsome little -- he washed them, helped them, and in the morning they left. Early in the\nmorning. So the next, in the evening, he went to another friend that he -- in Przemysl, the\nother friend, that he -- same city in Przemysl. And this man -- so he let him stay during -- all\nday he let him stay. But at night, in the evening, he said, \"My wife is scared.\u201d Because of the\nGestapo law, who was, \u201cWho will help the Jews will be punished by death.\" Of course,\neverybody was afraid. So this man said, \"My wife is afraid. I have children. So if somehow\nGestapo will discover, so we will be all killed. So maybe you will find some -- another place,\nsome-- somehow maybe somebody will take you.\"\nSo Joe, he didn't know if I am still living in the same place or no. And he -- but this man\nbrought him to the city; because he, this man, lived a little behind the city. He brought him,\nand he let him go. And Joe said, \"Ok, I will go out.\" And this man said, \"Maybe God will\nhelp you. Maybe after the war we will meet again. And good luck.\" And he left. And Joe\nwent to the same building where I lived and his parents before lived, and he went to the\nbasement because he didn't know what will, if he can come to me or no. For he, he thought\nthat few days he will be in the, in the basement. When he came there. Well, basement the\nbasement. Was some rats, mice, cats, sometimes were fighting, and that was maybe 11\no'clock in the evening. He was afraid also. And he was thirsty, hungry. And he was wounded\nalso from the running train. When he jumped, he was wounded -- hands and face and knees;\nand he was afraid sometimes maybe some neighbors will come to the basement and will see\n-- find him. So he took the risk to come out. Maybe I will let him go if I am still in the same\nplace and the same room. So he knocked. I was surprised for this knocking to my door so\nlate in the evening. So I asked, \"Who is there?\" He said, \"Joe.\" \"Joe who?\" And he said,\n\"Well, you remember Joe. You worked with my mother. Is Joe from this little shop.\" \"Ok.\" I\nopened. Well, I saw Joe. But that was no Joe. That was like three disasters together. Dirty,\nwounded, the blood on the face, blood on the hands, hands were very swollen. And so, \"Ok,\"\nI said. And he asked -- and he said, \"If you let me stay through the night, only one night. And\ntomorrow in the morning I will go out some place. But one night. I said, \"Ok, come on.\" And\nmy sister, she didn't know who was the Joe, and she didn't know who are the Jews, really.\nShe didn't know the difference.",
        "Q: How old was she?",
        "A: She was six and a half at that time. So I explain. I said, \"That is my friend, the Joe.\" And she\nasked, \"Why he is so dirty? Why he has some blood on the hands?\" I said, \"He fell, fell\ndown some place.\" And so she helped me to washed him, and little so.... And I didn't have\npajama for him, and I gave him my nightgown. And my sister, she laughed and she said,\n\"Oh, now we have two Fusia, not one.\" She called me from Stefania, the Fusia. I'm Fusia.\nAnd she laughed, and she -- \"Well, that is Fusia, and that is another Fusia.\" And he, I put him\nto the bed and he couldn't sleep because he was so excited and that he lost everything, and all\nnight -- and he had a fever also. All night he was calling, \"Mother!,\" \"Father!,\" and\n\"Brother!\" Why he didn\u2019t, didn't jump. All night: \"I am jumping, I am -- jump after me.\" He\ncalled still that this, this brother, that he should jump. All night I was sitting behind -- beside\nhis bed, and quiet because I was afraid maybe somebody will heard this girl have a man in\nher room. In the morning, he felt a little better. So I made some tea, and then I bought some\nlittle milk and he felt a little better. And still he had a high fever. So he was a few days. And\nduring the day came friend of mine. So I didn't -- her -- didn't want to see her, a man, so I\nsaid to, to Joe, \"Jump under the bed.\" So he jump under the bed, and all his clothes I put, put\nwith, with him. And I said, \"Keep you feet, feet cannot sticking out. And don't, don't breathe\ntoo loud. Don't sneeze.\" And I covered the bed longer with a blanket, that nobody will see\nhim. And he was stayed, I think, week or, or week and a half he was in, in my home. And\nthis man, my bed. And I slept in the other bed with my sister.\nAnd I have to enlighten my sister a little: who is the, the Joe, who are the Jews. And so\nsometimes I took her around the ghetto, and I show her that is the Jews. And she asked a\nquestion, \"Who are they, these Jews? What kind of people?\" She didn't know. So I explain\nher, and I told her that Joe is a Jew; and she said, \"But he is the same like you, like me. Like\nother men. He's the same!\" I said, \"Yes, he is the same.\" So I have to explain her the same\nwhat I heard this worker told to this little boy, who are the Jews: the same skin, the same\neverything, only the name is a the difference. And I told her, \"You remember the mother,\none time she said that God 1s one for all people. Only people choose some leaders, like she\nsaid Jews took the, the Moses. That is sust a counsel. But God is one. The other people\nchoose their counsel. But they, all these leaders counsels go to one God.\" And so I explained\nthe same to my sister, because I had no -- I had no other way. So that she can understand a\nlittle more who are the Jews and why Gestapo are killing Jews. I, I said, \"I don't know really\nwhy. I cannot tell you why, but they killed them. So we will try to help.\" And so she, she was\nenlightened a little who are the Jews. And, and then I --",
        "Q: You have a picture -- excuse me. You have a picture here of you and your sister during this\ntime.",
        "A: Yes, yes. This is the pictures during the war and this picture 1s a little later.",
        "Q: Hold it up a little just a little.",
        "A: Yes. This is earlier. This is a little later. That 1s almost before, when war was ended. Almost,\nthis picture. But that, that is a little earlier. You see this skirt, that is not mine. That is one of\nthe women whom I hid in the bunker. She was -- why? Because was time where when they\nhad no more money, so I have to exchanged dresses for our food. So I exchange all my better\ndresses for a food, and then I had only one dress.\nAnd then I started to -- they started to, to look among themselves what they have to\nexchange. So I had only one dress, and the Sunday -- sometimes if I wanted to go out and\nhave something, I didn't have dress. Only to work. So this woman, she was with two\nchildren. And she said, \"Well, maybe this skirt...you will take mine.\" She said, \"It's in good\ncondition, so try.\" And I tried, ok. And that is her, her skirt, because I didn't have. I\nexchanged for a food. Listen, 13 people that I needed a lot of food for them. 13 them, two of\nus. That was together 15 people. I needed a lot of food. So that is my sister, and that's me.\nAnd that is later, almost when war was ended.",
        "Q: Let us go back now. Sorry to interrupt you.",
        "A: That\u2019s all right.",
        "Q: So you have been hiding Joe under your bed for a week and a half, or --",
        "A: Yes. And then I, I went where work his brother. When he works there on the field with his\nfianc\u00e9e. I went there to tell him that Joe is all right; and he jumped from the train and he\ncame to me. I went there and I told him. And he said, \"Ok, but anyway he will be dead now\nor later. He -- they will kill us.\" And his fianc\u00e9e, Danuta (ph) her name was, and she asked\nme maybe they will come to me also because when they will not needed them anymore, so\nthey will kill them. I said, \"I don't know. I have only one room.\" And the evening when they\nwent back to the ghetto, she run away. She asked Henick (ph) -- her fianc\u00e9, Joe's brother --\nthat maybe he will run away from the way. And he was afraid, and she said, \"You are going,\nor no?\" He said, \"No, I am not going.\" And she ran away by herself, and she came to me. So\nnow I, I have two Jews.\nBut she two days later greeted me also unexpectedly friend of mine, and Joe were jumping\nunder the bed, and I wanted her to jump, but at that moment friend of mine opened the door.\nAnd I just pretended that I am making the bed, to cover Joe under the bed with the blanket.\nAnd she saw this Danuta (ph), and she asked me, \"Oh, who is that?\" I said, \"Well, that 1s a\nfriend of mine.\" And, \"What's she doing here? When she came?\" Because she knows\neverything. Only was two of us in whole building. So you know, I don't know how these lies\ncame to me. I told her that this friend, she's pregnant and she didn't want her parents know\nthat she 1s pregnant. And she wanted to make abortion, and she ran away from parents and\nshe came to me, yes. I don't know how I make up these stories. And this friend had -- she\ntold, \"Well, that's very easy.\" And she asked how months she's pregnant. I said, well, that is\ntwo months. And I really didn't know how, how, how long she was to say she was pregnant,\nbecause I didn't know the difference. The shorter, the longer -- I said, \"Two months.\" And\nshe said -- she gave advice, and she said to her, \"Well, first of all, you have to make a hot\nbath. And you will, will sit there in the hot water maybe half an hour. Then you make\nexercise -- very, very strong exercise. Then again hot water, and then a run on the steps.\" I\nlived on the third floor. She said, \"Run on the steps several times: up and down, up and\ndown. And make strong exercise, and that will go out.\" I said, \"Well, you have experience!\"\nShe said, \"Well, a little.\" And I told to Danuta (ph), I said, \"Listen carefully. You have to do\nthat.\" And I asked her, this neighbor, I said, \"Well, how I will make bath, hot bath for her? I\nhave no bath here. There is nothing.\" She said, \"Well, all right.\" And she said, \"I will borrow\nyou...\" She had like a big, big, some rounded -- some pot.\nShe said, \"You will warm water in the pot, and then put here warm water. And she will sit,\nand you will add every so 10 minutes or 15 minutes hot water. And that will be all nght. And\nthen exercises.\" And I said to Danuta (ph), \"Listen, you have to do that if you want to get rid\nof these things when you have that.\" And then my friend, she left. And then she brought me\nthis big pot. And I thanked her very much for her advice, and I said to Danuta (ph), \"You\nthanks her, because that was for you.\" And she said, \"Thank you very much.\" And she asked,\n\"That will help?\" She said, \"Ok, that will help. You will see that will help.\" \"Ok.\" So the\nneighbor left, and we laugh a little. I said, \"Will you jump?\" And next day I went to the\nghetto, and this brother, he was waiting around. He knew the place that mostly I were\ncoming there. And I met him there; and he said, \"Well, here in the ghetto everything 1s quiet.\nIt's all right. They can return back.\" I said, \"I don't know.\" So he said, \"I already found a\nroom.\" \"Ok.\" So I went back, and I told Danuta (ph) and Joe how it is. She said, \"I will not\ngo back.\" And Joe also told, \"I will not go back for a death there. There, there is only death,\nnothing more. But what is doing this Henick (ph)?\"",
        "Q: Let's hold it a minute please. We need to change the tape. Let them do that and --",
        "A: Ok.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: Ok, we are now back there. You started talking about Henick (ph), is that his name?",
        "A: Yes. Oh, I did not finish about the ghetto, yes. So that night came back, and I told that\nHenick (ph) is back in the ghetto and everything 1s all right there. And they said they will not\ngo back. But after noon, came some men knocking to the door. And I asked who. He said,\n\"Friend.\" \u201cWhat a friend?\u201d I didn't know this voice. So I opened the door; and this man\npushed the door and he came into the room. And that's good that Joe, in time, jumped under\nthe bed.\nBut Danuta (ph) was -- wasn't. And he came this man, and he pointed out on Danuta (ph).\nAnd he said, \"Oh, this is the girl. This is the Jewish girl from the ghetto.\" And I was\nsurprised and I thought, \"Oh, that is....\"\" Because I heard that the Germans had a lot of spies.\nThere are spies. They were around. And spies. So I thought that is probably German spy.\nAnd he knew her and he came; and now probably he will kill me and Danuta (ph), and\nHelena, too. And he -- this man said, \"Yes, that is the ghetto, Jewish ghetto. She run away\nfrom the ghetto. And you fianc\u00e9, Henick (ph), he told me that you have to come back to the\nghetto. He begged me that I will come here and I will bring you back to the ghetto.\" And you\nsee, when I heard that I was really angry. I said, \"What a miserable thing!\" How could he\nsend someone that I don't know? Who is he to send and tell her -- him my name, my\naddress? And he told who was the girl, that she is the Jewish girl and she is in my home. I\nwas angry. But Danuta (ph) said, \"I will not go back to the ghetto.\" He said, \"Oh, girl, you\nhave to go. You are a Jew, and your fianc\u00e9 said that I have to bring you back.\" So I said later,\nand he doesn't, he, he said that Henick (ph) will not pay him until he will bring her back. So I\nsaid, \"I will bring her back to the ghetto if she will not go with you. So you will be sure he\nwill pay you.\" He said, \"Ok, I will leave you here during the day.\" And he said to me, \"But\nyou have to bring her back.\" And she signed her signature and word that Henick (ph), Josef's\n-- her fianc\u00e9, Josef's brothers, he have to pay this man and she will return back to the ghetto.\nAnd the man left. And I was really angry, and Joe was angry, too. And Danuta (ph). How\ncould he do that? But anyway, sometimes that is --. So in the evening, they said they will go\nback to the ghetto. They will not longer risk my life for them. If the ghetto still there, they\nwill go back, ok. I will give them the food what I had, and I dressed them like on the street in\nthe evening. So Danuta (ph), I gave some my dress, some jacket that she will look like a girl,\nand we took Joe between us. And we walked and we laugh and we joking sometimes when.,\nwhen Germans.... I said to her, \"Hey, you laugh a little and be joking that this looks like a\ngirl's walk with a man.\" And they are smile and joking, and something like that. And we\ncame around the ghetto. Henick (ph) was waiting there. And I said, \"How could you do that?\nYou are skunk. You couldn't go or come by yourself!\" Because he was too afraid. \"You sent\nsome man that I didn't know him. Nobody knows him. And you told him my address, my\nname!\" He said, \"Ah, that 1s good man.\" I said, \"You know him?\" \"No, but I heard he is a\ngood man.\"\nAnd Joe was also angry. And Danuta (ph) said to him, \"Listen, Henick (ph), I will scratch\nyou eye or you, you face. Everything.\" She was so angry at him, ok. We say -- said goodbye,\nand they went there. I went home. And every second day, Joe were coming to me.\nSometimes twice a week from the ghetto, because they needed food. Was difficult to get\nfood there. And I -- and he brought sometimes skirt, sometimes glove, sometimes dress. I ran\nto the, to the market, and I exchanged for the food and I gave them. Later one day, he came,\nand came friends -- one boy from work -- and Joe jumped under the bed and then he came\nfrom under the bed. He got ide maybe I will find a bigger apartment, that I will take them\nfrom the ghetto to hide them. I said, \"Where did you get this idea? Under the bed?\" He said,\n\"Yes.\" I said, \"Go back under the bed.\" \"And to think about something else if you are\nthinking under the bed. So go back and think.\" He laughed. I said, \"Reverse your thinking.\"\nHe said, \"Ok, I am going back.\" And you see, exactly this time, a girl was knocked on -- to\nthe door; and again came the same neighbors. And we talk a little, and she ask, \"That this\nfriend, this friend, she had abortion? She, she made miscarriage?\" I said, \"Yes, you, you\nadvice was wonderful. Wonderful.\" She said, \"If you need it, do the same.\" So all the time,\ntwice a week, Joe was coming to me and still drilling a little to find apartment, to find\napartment. And one day, he came and he said in the ghetto his brother was ill. He got the\ntyphus. And his friend and they needed more food and better food -- like a milk, like a butter,\na little cheese.\nAnd again I have to run on the street or sometimes go on the village. Sometimes I walked\nthirty miles on the village, because I knew there someone to exchange some dresses and\nbring the food to the ghetto. So one day he said maybe I will ask this -- my neighbor, this\nMary who lived on the first floor -- she was a good friend -- maybe we together we will find\nsome apartment, and we will take him, his brother, and his friend from the ghetto because\nthey, they heard the ghetto will be finished. They will take all Jews to the concentration\ncamp, or to kill. I don't know what -- will be no more ghetto. So they wanted to run away\nfrom the ghetto. Maybe together with friend, we will take some apartment and we will take\nfew Jews from him and other. So I invite friend of mine, this Mary, and I told her. And I\nsaid, \"Listen, Mary. You see the Jews are killing and taken to concentration camp. Maybe\nwe will help few of them. Maybe we will find bigger apartment, and we will take few Jews -\n- these friends, some. You have also friends, some friends, Jewish friends. So we will maybe\nhelp them.\" \"You know,\" she said to me, \u201cStefusia,\u201d she said, \u201cI am 21. You are 17,\nprobably. You know Gestapo law. We saw on the on the street there was the posters that was\nthat sign by Gestapo: \u2018who will help the Jews will be punished by death.\u2019\" And was posters\nalso on the same, on our building also, the same poster sign by Gestapo. She said, \"You read\nthat. If you forget, go read again. That is maybe one percentage on the million that we can\nhelp and be alive. But this million, one million, that we can be dead.\" And she said to me, \"I\nam too young to go to the grave for a Jew. If you want it, that is your life. If you wanted to\nbe killed, to go to the grave in your young age, you can go. That is your choice.\"\nBut she said, \"I don't like to be dead. And I am too young to be buried.\" And she said, \"No, I\nam sorry. I will not help you. I will not take Jews and help, because that 1s death.\" And I\nsaid, \"Ok, Mary. If you don't like, maybe I will not take also.\" And I told her, \"Mary, please\ndon't tell -- don't mention to nobody.\" She said, \"Don't worry. I already got amnesia. I\nalready forget everything. Don't worry. Everything gone from my head and my mind.\" And\nok. So Joe came in the evening. I told him how Mary refused. He said, \"Well, ok.\" I said,\n\"Well, maybe I will take by myself. I will look for apartment.\" And I looked. I didn't know\nreally where to go. But I look. And Joe advised me to go there, where was mostly Jewish\nstreet. And now was empty. That. Go there. Maybe there you will find apartment, ok. I went\nthere. Was really empty, whole street. But was every apartment, I running up and down. Was\nno floor, was no doors, was no windows. No nothing. So I thought, \"Well, floors is not\nnecessary. But doors and windows, that is necessary!\" Then I looked -- oh, sorry, then I\nlooked around. If I will find some apartment there, I will take in these people where I will\nhide him, them. But was not apartment, was nothing. I thought, \"Maybe from another\nbuilding I will take some windows, some doors.\" But was no-- nothing. You see, I went out\nand I stood on the street and I thought, \"Where to go now?\" I didn't know where to go.\nEmpty. And I was frightening a little, so ghostly. You were laughing, really, but I heard a\nvoice. I heard a voice. When I stood and thinking, and I asked, \"Dear God, where I supposed\nto go now to look for apartment? Where?\" I looked around, and was a little scared because\nwas nobody there.\nAnd then I heard the voice. Some voice told me, \"Don't be afraid, and go a little farther there.\nAfter this corner, there 1s standing two women, women who clean the street, and they are\nsupporting on the brooms. And ask them for apartment. They will tell you.\" So I was\nlistening; and then I said, \"Well, what is with ordinary women who clean the street? What\nthey will know about apartment?\" And this voice said to me, \"Go and ask. They will know.\nThey will tell you.\" So I still thought, \"Well, what they will know?\" And this voice again\ntold me, \"Go. Please go.\" And I felt like a little pushed, and said, \"Go and ask, and ask for a\njanitor there.\" And I said, \"All right, all right. What I can lose?\" And I am going exactly this\nway, like this voice told me. And aft-- after the corner, and I saw two women, and they are,\nthey were talking together and supporting on the brooms, ok. I approached them. And I\nasked, \"Ladies, maybe you know some apartment? I am looking for apartment. And there's\nnothing here. I looked here, but there's nothing. Maybe you familiar with this area or\nsomething?\" They said, \"All right. We know apartment.\" And one of them, she said, \"Oh, 1s\napartment empty. Tatarska (ph) 3. You go this way, Tatarska (ph) 3 -- that is little small\ncottage, one family.\nAnd over there is woman janitor, and you ask for this woman janitor, and she will show you\nthis apartment. Is nice, nice apartment.\" And go, and they show me the way. And they said,\n\"Tatarska (ph) 3, go that way and ask for this apartment. And janitor is there, woman. She\nwill tell you.\" I thanked them, and I went there. And I went to this janitor; and I told her,\nasked her for apartment. She said, \"Ok.\" There across is apartment. And she said, \"Ok, I will\ntake the keys. I will show you.\" And she opened the door and I went inside. It's really -- it's\ntwo rooms, something wrong. It's two rooms and a kitchen, separate attic. It's very nice. I\nlooked around. She said, \"Well, only bad thing is here is no running water inside. There's no\nelectricity. Toilet 1s outside. It's primitive. But is nice.\" And she asked me, \"How many\npeople is?\" \"T have,\" I said, \"By myself and my sister.\" She said, \"Oh, that 1s big apartment\nfor you. You not have to have electricity. You can have a candle, or...or kerosene la...lamp.\nAnd to go to the toilet, you not have to use at night. It's enough daytime.\" \"Ok,\" I said. And\nshe told me where to go to...to reach man that he will give me application and everything.\nAnd he is, he takes care of everything around these apartments, all apartments. All right. So I\ncame home. In the evening, Joe came; and I told him that I saw apartment and I told him,\n\"Primitive, very primitive.\" He said, \"Ok, that may be better.\" And in the evening he dressed\nlike.... He said, \"I have to see that apartment.\" And he told me, \"You will tell that I am your\nbrother. I have to see this apartment.\" \"Ok.\" He make artificial mustache and make up a little\nand everything; and evening, we run there. And I went to the janitor, and I said, \"That is my\nbrother. He wanted to see apartment.\" And she gave me the keys. And I went, opened, and\nhe looks around and he said, \"That is perfect.\" And he looked at attic, and he said, \"That will\nbe very nice.\"\nAnd I said, \"That is like a dream for this deadly business.\" So I told the janitor that I will take\nthis apartment. And...but that was evening. She said, \"Ok, tomorrow morning you can go to\nthis and this man, and he will give you application and everything.\" Ok. In the morning, in\nthis same evening, Joe went back to the ghetto. In the morning, I didn't went to work so I ran\nto, to this man. He sent me to the building apartment. He gave me, \"Here's\nrecommendation.\" And I went to the building apartment; and they gave me application and I\nwent back, I came home. I filled up everything, and I went back there. And the secretary\nwere there, there was a lot of people for apartment, but secretary is woman, very fine. She\nsaw me and she heard: \"You are back!\" I said, \"Yes. I have everything all ready.\" And she\ntook it from me; and she said, \"In four days, come back. I think we be ready.\" I said, \"Really,\nyou will take care of it?\" She said, \"Yes.\" And ok. In four day, after four days, I came, and\nshe saw me and she yelled to me, \"I have for you. I have, I have.\" So I came, and she gave\nme and I kissed her. She said, \"Yes, now you have a bigger apartment. Not just a studio.\"\nAnd I kissed her and man who stood on the line for apartment, too. And he -- she -- he told,\n\"Maybe....\" To the secretary, \"Maybe...maybe I will kiss you. Maybe you will give me\napartment, also.\" She said, \"No, this girl was before you a few days.\" So -- and then I had\nthis license my. And in the evening -- and I ran directly to the ghetto, and I told Joe that I\nhave already apartment. And he start to organize there people and everything, a little money.\nAnd little by little, I -- first of all, I moved with my sister there. And my sister, when she saw\ntwo rooms and a kitchen separate. Oh, she, she lied on the floor and she, she rolled. And she\nsaid, \"So big place!\" And we moved right away to this bigger apartment.\nAnd she was happy. And then start to -- first Joe and another man also with father, first when\nwas everything ready. So from the ghetto they came. I went six o'clock, before six o'clock,\nunder the ghetto. They were ready there. And then we met in some place -- not under the\nghetto, a little farther -- and they were dressed like a workers, and they kept the hands like\nsome can with coffee or something like that. And they are going to the work. And I brought\nthem home. And two by two, with time, they came. And I had already seven people.",
        "Q: Who were the seven?",
        "A: Third came Joe with this man other, his friend -- Zenek his name. Then came girl from the\nghetto. She is in Brussels now. Then came another man with his friend. Then came this two\nfather -- men from -- father from this man who came with Joe first time and father this girl\nwho was already in my home. You see what happen? Also little tragic, but a comedy. When\nthese two father were prepared to come, I came to the ghetto and they arrange with the\nJewish postman that they will take them from the ghetto as a post office man. That nobody\nwill control them. Because postman from the ghetto every day comes out of the ghetto to the\ncity to take mail, and comes and brings to the ghetto.\nSo they make arrangement with the postman to take them as his helpers, to take them out\nfrom the ghetto. But they paid him to take them out of the ghetto. But somehow -- I don't\nknow if this man or other some, they denounce them to the German police. And what\nhappened, I said, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d These men, they took them from the -- by mail, wagon\nmail, from the ghetto. And he knew the city of Przemysl very well, this man. Every day he\nwas going from the ghetto to the, to the mail box, and that time that day he forgot the way.\nAnd he was surrounding three times around the city. He couldn't go straight to the mail box.\nHe forgot! But what happened, I saw, we were waiting for them, for these two father. The\npolicemen are waiting on the -- our street. Was two, two Polish policemen, and two German\npolicemen. And they were walking up and down, up and down. Exactly at Tatarska (ph) 3.\nUp and down. I was a little angry. So we wait. Past one hour, two hour. They didn't come. So\nI talk. I said to Joe, \"I will go out.\" He said, \"No, don't go out. If you will go out, exactly this\nfather can come here. So who will open the door?\" I said, \"No, I have to go out. I have to\nsomething, some -- take some walks.\" And I am passing this policeman. And I said, \"Good\nday!\" And I said, \"Oh, I surprised that you are here. What happened here? Somebody was\nkilled, or something like that?\" They said, \"No, something, something maybe will be.\" I said,\n\"Well, maybe you protecting us. Maybe we'll be -- we're landing here Hitler and Stalin, and\nwe'll fight here. That you are here, maybe you will protect us.\" They said, \"Well, if they will\ncome here and fight, we will maybe help you to kill them both and will be war over.\"\nAnd we laughed together, really. And I wanted to pass them, and they wanted also to talk.\nAnd they said, \"Well, miss. Talk a little!\" I said, \"No, I have to go some place. At least if you\nwill tell me why you are standing here...\" And passing exactly German policeman, and he\nasked something then and they told them something. I don't know what. I was not\ninteresting. And they pass, and they walk up and down. And I said, \"If you will tell me why\nyou are standing here, I will talk to you. If no, bye.\" So came another policeman, and he said,\n\"Well, of course, we can tell you. Why not?\" And they said, \"German policeman -- police\nreceived yesterday a note, a telephone, that today will leave ghetto some two rich Jews. And\nthey order us to, to catch them. And you see, these two German policemen, they watch -- are\nwatching us, too. They don't believe us. They watching us. We watching them. And we all\nwatching for these two Jews. Two rich Jews. Probably German wanted to have also their\nmoney, or something like that.\" You see, when I heard that, and I was inspected -- expected -\n- these two fathers, my heart fell down to the heels. And I said, \"Oh, God, what will be\ntoday? Will, will I, will I be killed today or no? What will happen today?\" You see, and I\nwent -- I said, \"Well, thank you.\" And I said, \"I don't think if some Jews will risk their life to\ngo out of the ghetto. They know they will be killed if they will leave ghetto. I don't know if\nthey will risk their life.\" Policeman said, \"Well, I don't know. I think also this same way, but\nwe received the note that we have to watch. So...\"\nAnd I asked, \"But why you standing exactly here, Tatarska (ph) 3?\" \"Because,\" he said,\n\"they don't know which number they will come. But some -- someplace between 5 in 1 --\nand 1. So we stand here, 3. We observe for 1, 2 and 4, 5. And we have good view, so we\nobserve. And that is in the middle, 3.\" I said, \"Oh.\" I thought, \"Dear God, they had the right\nnumber.\" And I said, \"Ok, thank you.\" And I said, \"I don't think that they will come, that\nthey will risk their lives to come.\" And I went a little farther. That was a church, and I went\nto this church, and I prayed and I asked God to take somehow this Germans and this other\npoliceman from here, that these two fathers will be not caught here. I prayed and I really\nasked God to help, to take out somehow these policemen. And I -- ok, and then I came home.\nStill was nobody. And sadly, this one, the Zenek one, the fathers -- the son of one of these\nfathers, he stand at the window a little farther and nobody can see him. And he observed.\nAnd exactly that time the policemen went up. All of them. And they talked, and came one\nfather. This girl's father. And he came on the back yard, and he didn't know where to go. And\nhe met the janitor, the woman, and he asked but -- before we talked together with this man if\nhe will met someone that he will tell that he is from work, because that time I will not go to\nwork, that he will a little angry at me why I didn't come to work. That he is from work. And\nhe came, and he asked the janitor and why I didn't come to work. And he was angry a little,\nand janitor said, \"Well, she is a good girl. She lives here, but she is a good girl. She's work\nvery hard, and she has a, a little sister. So she have to take care of little sister. Don't be bad to\nher. She is a good girl.\" And she show him where I am living. And I opened the door, and I\nsaid, \"Oh,\" what his name was, this mister who was in the in the factory. I said, \"I am sorry I\ndidn't come to work today, but I had a pain in my knee. I am so sorry. But I will be\nafternoon, for sure, tomorrow.\" And he said, \"You miserable girl! You didn't come to work\ntoday.\"\nAnd I closed the door, and -- ok. And I asked him, \u201cWhere 1s the other father?\u201d The, the\nHirsch (ph) is the -- name of Hirsch (ph). He said, \"I don't know. This man, he, he was lost,\nthe mail man. And he -- three times around and around the city, and he lost his way.\" And he\nsaid, \"He put us out of his carriage. And I lost the, the, the Hirsch (ph), the Schilinger.\" And I\nthought they, all my people were a little nervous. And after few minutes the son, who was\nwatching, and he said, \"Oh, it's my father! It's my father!\" And here came the other father.\nHe came. And he did -- the Zenek came, \"Oh, Miss Fusia! Miss Fusia, my father!\" And he\ntooked me and he lifted me up. And he said, \"Go out. Bring my father. Go out. Meet my\nfather.\" And I opened the door, and I asked, \"Oh, you again? Also from the work?\" And I\ntook him home. And my feeling...he came home, and he said, \"Oh, God, we are discovered!\nWe are discovered. Look, Gestapo will be here. We are discovered.\" And he start to running\nfrom one corner to the other. \"We are discovered!\" \"What happened?\" I said, \"Mr. Hirsch\n(ph), what happened?\" \"Be quiet.\" \"What happened?\" \"Gestapo will be here. We are all\nkilled. We are all killed.\" And I said, \"Quiet! What happened?\" And he said, \u201cStory -- what,\nwhat happened?\u201d And that he said, \"I lost Schilinger, this foreman. I lost him.\" And then he\nsaid, \"I went here to this Tatarska (ph) 3. And exactly a few doors before, one man caught\nme and put me to the inside to the building. And he said to me, 'I know you are a Jew and I\nknow you are going to hide here 'til some Polish people.' Said, 'But I needed money. Give me\nsome money. I know you are rich. Your people know that you will come here.\" And this\nfather, he was prepared for that. And he had ten thousand zlotys* in the pocket, and he --\n[TECHNICAL PROBLEM]\nOh, yes, and he said he gave him this, this 10,000 zlotys. And he asked, \"May I go now?\"\nThis man said, looked out and he said exactly the German policemen was crossing, walking.\nHe took him back and he said, \"No, you cannot go now.\" He said to him, \"I am a thief, but I\nam not killer.\" He said, \"I got what I wanted. I don't like -- I don't want you life. So go to this\nfamily. I know you are going to be hide some Catholic family, whoever they are. And good\nluck. Maybe after war we will meet.\" And he again went out. He looked that policemen were\nout, higher a little. He said, \"Now it is all night. Go.\" And he let him go, then. Because he\n* Polish monetary unit (Polish).\nwas angry when he came. He had -- he said, \"We are discovered. We are discovered.\nGestapo will be here. Gestapo will be here.\" \"We quiet him,\" I said. \"Maybe we will be not\nGestapo. Quiet!\" But anyway, I was afraid because that is some, some man; we didn't know\nwho. Maybe he observed where, where he were going. But everything was all right.",
        "Q: How did you get the other four people? You have a total of 13?",
        "A: The other, yes. You see, one day came to me two, really, some street boys. And they brought\nme a letter. They gave me a letter, and they said some woman gave them from the ghetto.\nAnd she paid them to, to deliver this letter to me. I start to read, and I see some woman\nnamed Zimmerman (ph)n (ph). I don't know who 1s she. I said, \"I don't know who 1s she.\"\nAnd they said they required my signature to, to, to give her back, that she will pay them. And\nshe will have proof that they delivered me this letter. I said, \"I don't know. I don't know her.\"\nBut anyway, I went to my people and I asked them. And they said, \"Ok, give them your\nsignature.\"\nAnd this woman asked me to come there to the ghetto, and she said 1n this letter that she\nknows that I will take Jews, and she knows that I have a few. And she mentioned the names\nthe people and, and she said that I had to take her and her two children. If no, she will\ndenounce me to Gestapo. I a little was upset. But I gave my signature, and I said, \"Go back. I\ndon't know who 1s the woman.\" And we discussed among this people, my people, and they\nsaid they don't know who its she. Next day these same boys came. And Joe's brother was still\nin the ghetto, still was there, and his fianc\u00e9e. And these boys came, and I read this letter\nagain. And again this same question, blackmail, to take her and her, her children. If no, she\nwill go to Gestapo. She knows whom I have already. So I said, \"I gave my signature.\" They,\nthe boys, left. And I told to my people, I said, \"I will go. I will say -- see what she wanted\nand who is she.\" I came there. I went to the ghetto. And I met Joe's brother, his fianc\u00e9e, and\nthey introduced me to, to, to this woman. And I said to her, \"You know, you are miserable.\nYou know, you are a killer.\" I said, \"You -- ok, you sent a letter. You can tell in the letters\nthat you wanted to meet me. You...you could say that the Henick (ph) is sick, or Danuta (ph)\nis sick. That they wanted to see me, and here we can talk. But in the letter, you, you sent\nsome streets boy. I didn't know who are they. And you mentioned the people, that I have the\nJews, a few Jews. And you blackmail me, and you said that you will go to Gestapo if, if I\nwill not take you.\" I said, \"Did you have do that? You are killer!\" I said, \"You go, you go to\ntell, 'Come on to visit because Henick (ph) is very, very sick, or Danuta (ph).' And here we,\nwe could talk. But not to mention in the letter everything.\" She start to cry, and she start to\nkiss my knee. And she said, \"I don't know how to behave. I tho-- I thought that is the best\nway. But I wanted to be alive. I wanted to save my children. I wanted to be alive to hear that\nthis is dead, not, not nothing more.\"\nAnd she started to, to embrace -- kiss me, and my hand. And she said, \"Please, I beg you. I\nbeg you. I wanted to save my children. I don't want to die, and my children.\"\nI said, \u201cThat was a very bad way, very low quality way.\u201d She said, \u201cBut I didn\u2019t know\nanother way.\u201d So I said, \u201cOk, if I have so many people, three more people makes no\ndifference for me. If they will kill me, they will kill once. Not many times. Not for every Jew\nkill. Just one death.\u201d So we make arrangement; and first, two days later, I took her children,\ngirl and boy. Boy was maybe eight, eight years maybe, maybe seven. I don\u2019t remember\nexactly. Daughter was 15. So I brought them. Then she came. Then came Joe\u2019s brother and\nhis fianc\u00e9e. Also was trouble with him. He didn\u2019t want to leave the ghetto, because was very\nquiet there at that time. And he said, \u201c\u201cWhy I supposed to sit in, in the bunker and be closed?\nHere I have apartment. I have fresh air and I have food.\u201d Because he had the money to -- and\nhe bought the food. Sometimes I brought the food, and was everything all right. So I said,\n\u201cThat will be not too long.\u201d And one day I heard on the street that ghetto will be finished.\nWill be end of the ghetto. And they, you know, during the war my ears were very long. My\neyes were very wide. So I heard what people were telling, and I came home, and I said to the\nJoe what I heard on the street. And he was frightened and he said, \u201cOh, please, Fusia. Go to\nthe ghetto and tell Henick (ph) that he is supposed to come right away. He is only one of my\nbrothers, only one left brother. And you have to bring him here.\u201d I said, \u201cHow I can bring\nhim? I cannot take him under my arms or hands and bring him here if he doesn\u2019t like to\ncome.\u201d And he said, \u201cGo!\u201d And he start to cry, \u201cGo, and bring him here.\u201d I went, and I told\nHenick (ph) what I heard. He said, \u201cOh, if something will be bad, we will hear first. Not on\nthe street, but here. And the Jews, they have a good spies. They first know what will be.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cListen, Henick (ph). Ghetto will be not long. If you will not come today or tomorrow,\nyou will not come to me anymore. Because you will be not in this world. You will be\nsomeplace else in another world. You will be killed. And I will not come here anymore. If\nyou don\u2019t like to come, stay. I will not come. But you will not, you will not come to me\nanymore, because you will be already dead.\u201d And I left. Next day, in the morning, early in\nthe morning, he was dressed a little like a young Wehrsoldat, like a little, some youngsters,\nGerman youngsters dressed. Jackets, like that. And he was dressed also and early 1n the\nmorning with his fianc\u00e9e, Danuta (ph), he came. He frightened me.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION\nEnd of Tape #2\n> Defense Soldier (German).\nTape #3",
        "Q: Ok, tape's on.",
        "A: Yes. And you see, a few days later I heard that in the ghetto is Aktion. Aktion -- that means\nthey call will be Judenfreid,\u00b0 without Jews. And you know Germans you -- Jew is \u201cJude.\u201d\nBe Judenfreid. So they take all Jews to the concentration camp. And ok...is Aktion. Maybe\nweek or week and a half later, so I worked normally. I went to work, the factory. Everything\nis all nght. Took care of these people, food and everything.",
        "Q: How? How did you get them food?",
        "A: Well, I pretended that my sister and I, to make more money, that we buy food and sell food.\nWhen sister sometimes brought the bread, one or two. So to bring home, sometimes\nneighbors ask. My sister was prepared for that, because Joe taught her how to say to, to\nneighbors, to friends. And she said -- neighbors ask, she said, \"Oh, today I didn't sell\nnothing. Maybe later I will go, I will sell something. And I will make money for one bread\nfor us.\" Yes. And you see, that was the story. And maybe a week, or maybe two weeks later,\nI came -- I work at night at that time. In the morning I came home, so my people start to --\nJoe and the Zenek -- they start to ask me what I will say if two people more will come to me.\nI said, \"What you mean, what I will say? There is no more ghetto. No more Jews. How they\nwill come? From where? From the other side of the war?\" They said, \"Well, what -- how you\nwill behave? What you will say?\"\nI said nothing. What I can say? I know they cannot come. \"But if...\" I said, \"...all right, if\nthey will come they will stay with you. That's all.\" And they said, \"You know, yesterday in\nthe evening, when you left, came two people more. One couple. They were married not long\nago, and they came.\" I said, \"Ok.\" And they ca-- and they introduced me. And they came and\nthey said, \"Oh, please. Don't throw out us, please.\" And still kiss my hand. I said, \"All right,\nall right. I tell you, they will kill me, if they will kill us all, only once.\" So that was 12 people\nalready. So I said, \" 12 people, 12 troubles. Ok. Will be no more people.\" And a few days\nlater, the same story. I came home from work, the same story. \"What you will say if one man\nwill come more?\" I said, \"What you are talking about? There's no more ghetto. There's no\nmore Jews in the ghetto. No more Jews in this, 1n this city.\" \"But what you will say?\" I said,\n\"The same I will say like before. If will come, will stay. Ok! Come on in!\" In came, and\ncame this man that time, this man.\n\u00b0 Actually \u201cJudenfrei,\u201d meaning \u201cfree of Jews\u201d (German).\n\"Jew (German).",
        "Q: Hold it close to you and up.",
        "A: And this man came at night -- not at night, before curfew he came. And they introduced me.\nAnd he said, \"Oh, I am sorry really. But I, I wanted to live. I don't wanted to die. So I am so\nyoung, and I don't wanted to die.\" And I said, \"Where you been all this time?\" And this\ncouple and he, they had friends, Catholic friends; and they ran from the ghetto through the\nsewer sometime. Something like that. And they went to them, to this Catholic family, and\nthey kept them three days. And they said, \"I am sorry. We cannot keep you any longer,\nbecause my family will be dead and we all will be killed.\"\nBut they knew my address, these, these Jews. They knew my address, so they said, \"Ok,\nmaybe we will go to this girl.\" But what happened, this man, special, he sent this woman to\nme, to ask me if I will take him. I tho-- I thought that again some blackmail me somehow.\nMaybe this woman knows that I have already this twelve Jews. She wanted to blackmail me,\nthat they give her a money. When she told me that one Jew sent her, and he asked me to take\nhim. So I said, \"I am sorry. I don't know who ts here he. I don't know any Jew, so...\" And I --\nand she said that I have Jews. I said, \"I am sorry. I have no Jews. And I don't like specially\nJews. If you wanted me to blackmail me, you will not get from me money. Just if you want it\nyou can go to Gestapo. Maybe they will kill me, but money I will not give you because I\nhave no money. And I have no Jews. And I will not take a Jew, because I don't know who is\nhere he. And I will not take him. If you want it, you keep him. If he is really Jew. But if you\ncame to blackmail me, I am sorry. You have to...\" And I opened the letter in the bun-- bunker\nthat time. And I opened all the rooms, and the rooms were, were -- went to the, to the attic.\nThis small room I opened, I show her. I said, \"Look at. Everything is empty. I am here only\nwith my sister. You see, nothing happened. And nothing will happen. And I will not take\nJew. And I don't like Jews, and I will not take this Jew what you said. And I am sorry. Please\nleave my home. If you wanted to blackmail me, I will not give you money, because I have\nno money.\" And she left. She left. But in the evening what she told this man; and he said,\n\"Well, I will go by myself.\" And he came in the evening. When he came, I said, \"Hey, you\nmiserable! You shouldn't come by yourself. You so comfortable like maharajah! You sent\nsomebody else, you couldn't come -- could come by yourself.\" I said, \"You miserable! I\ndidn't -- I didn't know who 1s this woman. You sent her to me.\" And I was really angry. And,\nlike otherwise, \"I'm sorry. I'm this, I'm that.\"\nSo -- and so I had 13 people. But, you see, what, what is started when was no money\nanymore for the food. This couple, they wanted me to sell jewelries what they had. I couldn't\ngo to sell, because I didn't know where. And how I can go to sell to some, some jewelry,\nsome, some shop to sell some earrings or, or rings, or something like that? So I couldn't go.\nSo they talked together, and this woman who was married who came, she said, \"We will go\ntogether. And I will go to her because I know her, and I will tell her everything. But I will\nnot tell her that Iam here. Only someplace else. And she will help.\" Really, we were went in\nthe evening there. I was waiting outside; and she went there. And this woman: \"Oh, good\nthat you are alive! Good that somebody helped you.\" And she took -- I don't know what she\ngave her, but she took it, and she prepared the next day food. And we came in the evening.\nShe brought out, and we carry home. And then when German moved to my apartment, I had\nfour German -- another story. Because in my story I title, they gave me two hour to move out\nof my apartment to a free apartment. How could I move and leave 13 people for a certain\ndeath? Whole story.",
        "Q: Let's back up. You are now -- you have come home with this woman. She has sold the\njewelry. You have food. You are putting it in the bunker. Describe the bunker. Was this in\nthe attic? Where was it?",
        "A: In the attic, yes. First of all, was in the attic. Everything. But later, they saw that it is too\ndangerous to be in the open attic. So they, Joe, and this Zenek, who came first with him, they\nlooked and they said that they can divide the attic. And they can build false wall.\nSo now was trouble. They said to me, and they called me because they have to tell me\neverything. They call me, they told -- they showed me, and they said, \"That will be better,\nbecause if sometime someone can come accidentally on the attic they will find us. So on it\nwill be bunker. We will sit there. All day we can sit here in the open air, and if some it will\nbe dangerous, we will go there.\" Now how I can find the same old wall boards? How I can\nfind? They asked me the old to find, because they -- the old was old. And I was everyday,\nwhen I went out in the morning from the work, I was running around the streets and look.\nBecause sometimes after the bombs was falling and destroy the buildings, the people were\nand taking the woods for burnings. Was difficult to buy some, some coal, something like\nthat. Just wood. And I was running and looking for some boards. But who were selling was\nsometimes new, was not old. But Joe, every day when I came from the work, I found the big\ncard, paper with the letters, big letters, boards -- \"Buy a Boards.\" \"Buy a Boards.\" -- old\nboards. Sometimes we laugh, really. I said, \"Where I get?\" He said, \"I don't know where. But\nbuy. Look.\" And everyday, few days I went running every morning from the work around.\nAnd sometimes I went to the market, because over there was gathering everything. And they\n-- and one day, had man some, some things. So I asked him how much that cost, and that\nwas some instrument to, to dig the soil, soil there. And he asked me, \"Well, miss, for what\nkind? For what you needed that?\" \"To bury Germans.\" \"If you want it to bury Germans, I\nwill help you.\" I said, \"No, I want it to correct something.\" And when I returned from there\nhome, I met on the street friend of mine from work -- two men -- and they had -- they selled\nalso from the buildings the, the boards. And they took it and they sell it additional, so they\nmake money. And I, I saw, and really old.\nAnd I asked, \"Well,\" They said, \"High. High. It\u2019s morning.\" And I asked, \"Well, that is good\nboard, and good wood, too, for burning.\" I said, \"How much do you want?\" They said,\n\"Well, we set some price.\" They said, \"But for you, will, will be lower.\" And they told me a\nprice, and was not too high. Was really low. And I said, \"Ok, I will take.\" And was really\nperfect. Was old, dirty, and a little black like other. So -- and they brought me home. This --\nthis things, this board old. And then they wanted to bring me inside. I said, \"No, thank you. I\nhave to exercise my muscles, and my sister, too.\" And I paid them, and they put in front, and\nI said, \"Thank you.\" And I took really with my sister inside, and inside they helped me. And\nthey took and they start to build a new wall to cut -- to, to divide this, this attic. And they\nbuilt a new false wall, and they make a bunker up there. And that was -- and something was\nreally. Some friend came, or something like that, so they went to the bunker. And all day,\nthey were free. It was nobody. They were, they were in the room. They sit all day in the\nroom, and downstairs. But if somebody came, so they run up. And I said, \"Remember, take\neverything after you. Especially men things.\" So and I called them a ghost, my ghosts. I had\nthirteen ghosts. So when I wrote my story, I didn't know to, to, to write, to title -- Thirteen\nGhosts, or something like that. So friend of mine, she said, \"Well, I had one day thirteen\nghosts. But that was really ghosts. But that is not the real ghosts.\u201d So I said, \"Well, maybe\nFight for Thirteen.\" She said, \"That will be ok, all right.\" So title is Fight for Thirteen -- not\nThirteen Ghosts. But otherwise I called them ghosts. They, they worked without shoes,\nbarefoot, because not make the noise. And one day, one day, I had a boyfriend and he loved\nme very much, and he wanted to marry me. And I couldn't afford to have a boyfriend,\nbecause I didn't know if I will be alive today. Or maybe tomorrow I will be dead, or\nsomething. How I can have a boyfriend?\nSo to all my boys who wanted to date with me, I said, \"After war. After war.\" And this boy\nalso, he came to me too often, maybe. Maybe too often; and when he came, always I had\nsome excuses to get rid of him. And I walked with him out, but not all the, all the, time my\nexcuses worked. And he start to talk about marriage, absolutely. I said, \"Listen, after war.\nDuring the war is no, no sense.\" But he start to bother me, really. If I wouldn't have this, this\n13 -- my deadly business -- I really wouldn\u2019t hesitate, because that was a good boy and\nhandsome boy. So one day, I thought and I said -- I didn't sleep all night, and I thought what\nto do. How to scare him? Then came to me idea that friend of mine, she had a photo studio.\nAnd boy's, this boy's girlfriend, before he had some girl and she had some, some German\nboyfriends she met later. And I, and he left her because she date with Germans, this boy.\nAnd there came to me ide \"Well, if I will have also German some photo, studio some photo--\nphotograph of Germans, maybe I will scare him, too.\" And I ran to -- in the morning, to\nfriend of mine. And I told her, \"Listen, Emilka (ph), maybe you have some photograph,\nsome picture -- could be SS man or Gestapo, but very handsome. Very handsome.\" She\nlooked at me, and she said, \"Well, for what purpose you needed that? If I know you, you not\nspecially in love with them.\" I said, \"But with this one, I will be.\" And I told her story. She\nsaid, \"Well, for this purpose I make yesterday SS picture, and he is handsome.\" And she\nsaid, \"I will make him more handsome. I will take out all the ruddish (ph)....\"_-- like she call,\nall this some, some spots or something -- \"And I will make you -- him handsome.\" And I\ncame home, and Joe had the same idea. Real-- really, like, like my mind went to him, and the\nsame idea. I said, \"I already was, and I order.\"\nAnd you see, two days later I came to this friend of mine, and she had already framed this SS\nman. And he was really handsome. And you see we are standing together. And I keep this\npicture, and I said to her, \"You know, he is handsome.\" She said, \"Yes, he is handsome. If\nwill be no war, or before war, really that this boy is nice.\" And we laugh a little. And I said\nto her, \"Well, if I will hang on the wall and my boy will come, I don't know his reaction.\"\nAnd I keep this picture, and then watch, and she told -- and this, the same SS man is coming.\nIs coming, because he came maybe picture is all ready. And she said to me, \"Oh, trouble\ncame.\" And this SS man came, and he show -- saw his picture. And he looked, and he looked\nat me, and he said, \"Oh, Fraulein, Fraulein.\"* I have his picture. And the friend of mine, she\nspoke very well German. And she asked him that I asked her that he is very handsome, if I\ncan have his picture. And he said, \"Oh, Fraulein, Namsie (ph)! Namsie (ph)!\" And he raised\nme, and he lifted me up. And he said, \"Namsie (ph)!\" And he kissed me. And he, and he\nlifted me up, and he said, \"Ah, all right! Namsie (ph)!\" And this friend of mine, she said to\nme, \"Stefie, run away. Run away!\" So through the teeth, she told me, \u201cRun away. And fast.\u201d\nAnd I said to him, \"Danke sehr schon, sehr sch\u00e9n.\"\u201d And he said, \"Ah, Fraulein, Fraulein.\"\nAnd my friend looked at me: \"Run away! Run away!\" And I went out. And I brought home\nthis picture, and I hanged on the wall over my bed. Next day, this boy of mine came. And he\nlooked, and he said, \"Well, what is that?\" I said, \"What? Who 1s that, not what!\" And he said,\n\"What he is doing here?\" I said, \"Well, that is my new boyfriend.\" He said, \"What! He and\nyou!\" I said, \"Yes.\" And he said, \"I don't believe.\" I said, \"Don't. But that is true. I am dating\nwith him, and I will stay with him.\"\nAnd I was so little aggressive, and you know. And this boy looked at that picture, then at me,\nand I saw that he was like a paralyze. And he looked at that picture, and then at me, and he\nbecame like older man. And he couldn't moved. A few minutes he stood and he looked, and\nhe wanted to open mouth. He couldn't. Now, you know, my heart was broken. I wanted to\ncry, really. Because I, I loved him. But I repelled this thing, this my mind from him, that I\ncannot love. But I wanted to cry. I -- and was a moment that I wanted to tell him everything.\nI wanted to tell him, \"Listen, I have 13 Jews. I have to save them. I have to help them.\" I\nwanted to tell him. But, you know, but some things, some mind told me, \"No, don't tell him.\"\nAnd second was that I wanted to tell him, and the, the other second told me no, not to tell.\nBut inside, my heart, heart was broken and I wanted to cry, but I kept my tears. And I, I\nwanted to embrace him and tell him everything, but I couldn't. I couldn't. I thought, \"God, I\n\u201cOh, young lady, young lady.\u201d (German)\n\u201d \"Thank you very much, very much.\" (German)\nhave to help these people. If I will tell him, I don't know what his reaction will be.\" And I\ndidn't tell nothing. And he -- then he moved, and he looked at me and he said, \"You? You\nand SS? You?\" I said, \"Yes, me and SS. Me and SS man.\" And I said, \"Look how handsome\nhe is!\" And he turned, and he still look at me and he went out. And I watched at the window,\nand he walked really like old man. I tell you how much I wanted to cry. I wanted to run and\nafter him and cry. But I said, \"No, no.\" And he left. But otherwise, he was after me, behind\nme. He was at work. I saw him far away, but he was with his friend or someone, or\nsometimes alone. Sometimes on the street, I saw him. Otherwise I saw him. But he didn't\ntalk to me. I didn't talk to him. Then another boy I met on the party, my friend party. And the\nfirst time he met me and I met him, we danced all evening like some.... If you study physics,\nyou know some things just go together; and this, this like some things just come together.\nAnd like we came together, really; and we dance all night together and then he asked me...so\ncame a curfew. So I said, \"Before curfew, I have to go back home.\" And he wanted to bring\nme home. I said, \"No, I am sorry. You know I have a little sister. It's not nice for me to bring\nmen to home, something like that. No time, no nice for a little girl to see.\" OK. And we make\ndate on the Sunday. We will meet on the Sunday. But in the Sunday, I arranged with one\nman around work... factory that will bring food from village, bring him food to the store. He\nhad a little store. They will bring food--things like cabbage, potatoes, kasha, all these things.\nSo in the Sunday in the afternoon, they will bring him. So I told him, \"Leave for me some\nfew pounds these. Few kilos this.\" He said, \"Ok. Come Sunday. I will leave for you.\" So I\n.. sunday, I was running to this shop and I saw this boy was waiting for me. But I couldn't go\nto him, because I had to first to buy food. And he was so handsome, really. But I ran there to\nthe shop; and exactly came this religious people and this was, this man was alone in his shop.\nSo I help him to, to weigh these...these potatoes and the cabbage, and to bring inside and\neverything. And for that, he gave me gave me a few kilos something for nothing. So...so I\nhad maybe 50 kilo--I had a little potatoes, maybe ten kilo potatoes, and three kilos kasha and\nsome cabbage, some other things, some piece of cheese he give me without nothing. Piece of\nbutter, he gave me without nothing. He said, \"Oh, you so pretty, you have to have this little\nnourishment.\" Ok.",
        "Q: Tell me about the Germans. You brought, you brought the food home. Where did you store it\nfirst?",
        "A: Well, mostly they kept in the bunker.",
        "Q: Ok.",
        "A: They kept. A little I kept in, in my -- in the kitchen, but mostly they kept. All bread and\nbutter. Only a little I had in my kitchen, and rest they kept there in the bunker. Also potatoes.\nI couldn't have too much. Just a little, for two girls, just a little. So they kept there.",
        "Q: Tell me how Germans came to live in your apartment?",
        "A: Well, across my apartment that was -- before that was a school. Like a college, big building.\nBut that time, we don't -- we didn't know that Russia came closer and they repelled German\nfrom this moving and they fight with Germany. And German were a little repelled. And they\nhave to have a hospital for a military people, for soldiers -- wounded soldiers. So they looked\nfor a some big building. And they found exactly this building -- college across, big building.\nAnd they took it for a hospital, and they make their hospital exactly from my, from across\nmy building. So they make up a hospital over there, and they went -- walked around\nneighbors and around street, they looked for apartment for their personnel, hospital\npersonnel. Like nurses, doctors. Some they lived there, inside; but was not so much place so\nthey look around. And they took here one room, there one room. And they came to me, two\nSS men and they looked around and they saw two girls, two rooms -- big two rooms and the\nkitchen. They said, \"You not need it so much. Two girls, they not need it so big apartment.\"\nAnd these two SS men told to me, they gave me order just two hours to move out of my\napartment and to leave for them empty apartment. They will come in two hours. If I will be\nstill here, they will kill me.\nThey have to have this apartment. That is big apartment. They have to have it, this\napartment. Two hours. So you see, I went out and I looked for apartment, and I still went to\nthis street where was before lived Jews. I was still running up and down, up and down. Was\nno available apartment that I can take it. Was nothing. Nothing. Doors, windows, kitchen --\nnothing. Nothing. Just ruined, nothing more. Past two, one and a half hours. So I came home.\nI start to cry. I said, \"How I can leave 13 people for a certain death? I can run out, but these\npeople will be dead. And I have no apartment.\" So they advised me to go for another -- some\nstreet. There look for apartment. For sure I will find something. I ran there. Was nothing\navailable, nothing. Was 20 only minutes. I came home. I said, \"Nothing.\" You see, all my 13\ncame down; and these three children, they pressed all to me. And they that was so tight to\nme, and all 13, they looked at me. My decision. Will I leave? My decision. Will I leave them\nor no? And -- [Technical problem] I have to keep my hand, but I am a little too nervous. I am\nnot here. Sorry.",
        "Q: Ok, go ahead.",
        "A: And you see, all 13, they said to me, and Joe and these older people, and they all said to me,\nand this Zenek, \"Run away! You not have to die with us. We have to. But you don't have to\ndie with us. You cannot help us anymore. Save your life and your little sister. And run away,\nbecause still you have time, 10 minutes.\" And they said -- and Zenek and Joe, they pushed\nme. They said, \"Run away! Don't die with us. You cannot help us anymore. What you could,\nyou helped us. But not now. Save your life and Helena. Go. Run away.\" And these all people\nwatched me, and the children were so pressed to me that I heard their breathing. And my\nsister watched me. And so I really, you see, I didn't know what to do. I said to them, \"Well,\nfirst of all, come on. We will pray. We will ask God.\"\nAnd you see, I had a picture when I bought when I was a little girl -- Jesus and his mother\npicture. And I bought it. And always hanged on my wall. And I said, \"Come on. We will\npray. We will ask God.\" And first I knelt, my sister and all the 13 after me, behind me. And I\nprayed, and I turned. All 13 were in deep, deep prayer. And I asked God not to let us killed.\nHelp somehow. I cannot leave this apartment. I cannot leave 13 people for a certain death. I\nwill be alive if I will go out, but 13 people, 13 lives will be bad, will be killed. That is the\nchildren also. And young people. I asked God, \"Help, somehow.\" Again I heard a voice,\nwoman voice. Was so beautiful. Was so nice. Was so quiet. She said to me, \"Don't worry.\nWill be everything all right. You will not leave your apartment. You will stay here, and they\nwill take only one room. And will be everything all nght. I am with you.\" And she talked to\nme. \"Be quiet.\" And she advised me what to do. She said, \"Send your people to the bunker.\nOpen the door. Open the windows. Clean your apartment, and sing.\" You see, I had my\nhands like that in prayer. When I heard this voice. I was like hypnotized. My hands was bent\ndown, and I was listening, listening. And then voice said, \"Will be all right.\" And\ndisappeared. And after few minutes, I listened. Was nothing more. And I got up. And I said\nto my people, \"Go to the bunker.\" Exactly like the lady told me. And I said, \"I will not move\nfrom my apartment. I will stay here. And go to the bunker, and be quiet very quiet.\" And you\nsee, and I was completely like different people. And they looked at me. They thought -- all\nmy 13 -- they thought that my mind, there's something wrong with my mind. And I said,\n\"Ok, go out -- go in the bunker. Will be everything all right. And stay quiet over there.\" And\nI opened the window and the doors, and I clean. I start to sing. I don't know how I became so\nhappy. And the all neighbors came. And they said, \"Miss Podgorska, what happened? Why\nyou not moved? Gestapo, SS will come. They will kill you. That is the war. That is the, the\nmilitary. That is the, the -- they said they have no mercy for an for an enemy. They are our\nenemy. Go out. We don't like to see you to killed. You're too nice, too young to be dead.\"\nI said, \"I have no place to go. If SS man wanted to kill me, they can kill me. I will not leave\nmy apartment. I have no place to go.\" They said, \"You can go to your friend's. You know,\nyour friend. She has two rooms. You can stay there.\" I said, \"No, I will not go from my\napartment.\" And they thought also something wrong, and came janitor's husband. And he\nsaid, \"Miss Podgorska, I will throw you out. Go out. I don't like to see you to be killed. I\nhave no place to bury you.\" And serious -- he was serious. He said, \"That is, that is enemy.\nThat is, you know, that is Gestapo and SS, that is the same. And that is wartime. Nobody has\nfor nobody mercy.\" I said, \"No, I am sorry. I will not move from my apartment.\" And he\nsaid, \"Something is wrong,\" you see, and he left. He left, and I am singing and cleaning my\napartment. And past exactly two hours, this 10 minutes, 1s coming only one SS man. And he\nwas so friendly. He was laughing to me from a few yards. And he came closer to the\nwindow. And he said, he spoke a little Polish. Very broken, but he spoke. And he said good\nthat I didn't moved from my apartment, because they will take only one room. This last room\nthey will take. And he said, \"Very well, you can stay. It is good that you were not moving.\"\nSo ok. And he looked, and he laughed. And you know, he saw letter was on the table from\nmy mother, and my mother was in Germany in the Salzburg, and he saw this letter. This\nletter and the address and the Salzburg, and he said, \"Oh, who, who you are in the\nSalzburg?\" I said, \"Whom? My mother. You took my mother to the Germany, and my\nbrother.\"\nHe said, \"Oh, your mother is in the Salzburg!\" And he looked, and he said, \"Oh, I know this\naddress. And that is my friend's, and I will go there next month. Can I give the best regards\nto, to your mother?\" I said, \"Ok.\" What I can say? And he said, \"Ok. I will go next month. I\nwill be on my vacation. I will be back two or three weeks after that.\" He said, \"And I will\ncome back, and I will tell what your mother are you're doing there. And I will bring regards\nfrom your mother. And I will see your mother.\" And he talked. He was so friendly. And he\nsaid that he has also two sisters about my age and younger, and he said sometimes he would\nlike to go. He missed family and sisters. They sometimes fight, but what is family? And he\nleft. And maybe ten minutes later, came two sisters from this hospital with luggage. And this\n-- and he came with them. And I opened the door, of course, and he took this one last room.\nAnd bunker was exactly over they\u2019s room. And every night, they had two boyfriends there.\nSoldiers, German soldiers. And they slept with them. And every night, these two boyfriends\n-- these, these soldiers -- came to them every evening with their rifles, you know, when I saw\nold rifles and soldiers. I thought, \"Oh, maybe they will kill me today.\" And they slept with\nthem. In the morning, they left. And sometimes I think they suspect, because they probably\nheard the noise over their head. And they maybe suspect that maybe something is there.\nBecause one day came, I came from work, and came these two German and also one SS\nman. And the -- these two sisters came also from the hospital. And one sister caught me, and\nshe started to talk, ask something. And the soldiers, too. And one sister went -- one woman\nwent to the, to this, this room where it was exit to the attic. But Joe, and these people -- when\nthey saw that Germans came to my home again and the sisters came from the hospital and\nthey all came -- he said, in the last moment, \"Go to the bunker.\" And he closed the door, and\nhe said, \"Be quiet, because we never know. Maybe they suspect sometime -- something.\"\nAnd when this sister and these soldiers kept me busy and I wanted -- because I saw she is\nrunning there, and to the -- to the other room, to the, to the exit to the attic. I wanted to run\nafter her, and they caught me. They, they hold me. They didn't let me go after her. And she\nwent there, and lift the ladder up and she went on the attic and she looked around. But you\nsee, before, when they built this, this wall, I put there old things, old, some junks. Old, that if\nsomebody will come, will see that I have storage there. Old some dresses, some, some, some\njunk, all old. And she looked around carefully, this side and this side. And she saw nothing.\nJust storage things -- dirty, and old. And she came out and probably she gave them a sign,\nand they let me go and they left. But I tell you, this moment I knew that -- I thought that she\nwill see them. Because I didn't told them, \"Go.\" And over, I think over eight months, every\nday, every night, I had at home four Germans and 13 Jews over their head upstairs. Do you\nknow, can you imagine my feeling? I don't think so. If you will not through, be not through\nby this things, this horrible time, you will not imagine my feeling. When I went, came from\nfactory sometimes, I walked in the morning -- after seven o'clock, after work. Otherwise I\nask God, \"Dear God, what I will see at home? Maybe all, they already killed. Maybe they are\nwaiting for me to be, to kill me. Maybe something.\" Oh, I tell you.... But one day, when I\nreturned from work afternoon, this same SS man who gave -- I took the picture, with his\nfriend he waited close to the factory, and he called me. And he call -- he knew that my name\nis Stefie, but in the German they don't pronounce it clearly. Shtefie (ph) -- they add \"s,\" and\nthey and they pronounce \"Shtefie (ph).\"\nAnd they call me, \"Shtefie! Shtefie! Shtefie (ph)!\" And I looked. \"Who called me Shtefie\n(ph)?\" Friend of mine said, \"Oh, look at your boyfriend!\" Because she saw one day. And he\ncalled me, and friend of mine said, \"Ok, go to him. I will wait farther.\" And you know, I am\ngoing in his direction, and I still ask God. Oh, probably he ran away from my wall. And\nsome, you know, my imagination were -- was running. I imagine everything. I thought,\n\"Well, maybe from the picture he saw my 13 Jews, and maybe he already killed them. And\nhe came here and now he is calling me. He will kill me. Oh, probably Helena is killed and all\n13 are killed. Now he will kill me.\" And I said, \"Oh, dear God, don't, don't let kill me.\" Oh,\noh. You see, but all my mind was working. And I came closer, and this -- he said, that is his\nfriend and he embraced me, and they talked together. And then this, this SS man whom I had\nhis picture, he said in Polish -- they argued between themselves something, I don't know\nwhat, but he -- the SS man -- he said to me so much broken Polish that I should run away\nquickly, fast. Run away, run away. And I in a minute, I said, \"All right, all right. Gute Nacht.\nGute Nacht, auf Wiedersehen.\"'\u201d And when I came to friend of mine, and she heard what\nthey are were talking. This other SS man, he told him to take me to their room for a night.\nAnd he said, this other, he said \"No, she is too young. And she 1s nice girl, and young. Why\nwe have to kill her in the morning to throw her out?\" He said, \"The war. She is our, our\nenemy.\" And he said, \"We are her enemy.\" And they argued together between themselves.\nAnd this, this other, his friend, he wanted to take me for the night. And this said, \"No.\" And\nbecause he told me run away. And I ran -- and this, and you see, he, he somehow he saved\nmy life. I said, \"God help-- helped me, protect me to save my life that I will save, save other\nlives. And you see --",
        "Q: That's almost an ending for the tape. We\u2019re just about done.",
        "A: I'm sorry.\n'\u201d \u201cGood night. Good night, and see you again.\u201d (German)",
        "Q: Tell me the end of the war very briefly.",
        "A: Well in the end of the war, that was another story.",
        "Q: We have three minutes.",
        "A: Three minutes, ok. That was fighting, fighting all night. And in the morning we didn't know\nwho won. German or Russia? So they stood all at the window, and I stood with them. Who\nwin we\u2019 ll, we\u2019ll see to first, German or Russia? Well, first of all we saw German. I said,\n\"Back to the, to the bunker! Nothing. We will wait.\" Then after few minutes comes Russian\nsoldiers. Oh, and he called to, to, to this, this soldiers, German. \"Ruck Gewehr, Ruck\nGewehr!\"\"' Like, \"Hello!\" He put up his rifle and hands up, and he took him. So I said, \"It's\nRussia now.\" So all my people, they wanted -- oh, it's not all. But a few hours later, I said,\n\"You still be in the bunker. Be out, and I will see what will be next, because after a few\nhours German can come back.\" And they went there. And I had opened the window and\neverything. And I was singing a little, because it was reason, maybe. It will be freedom. And\ntwo Russian soldiers passing, and they saw me and they come to my window. And we start\nto talk a little. I didn't know Russian, few words from before. And they asked if they can\ncome in. I said, \"Ok\" They ask if I have vodka. I said, \"Well, not too much.\" But a little I\nsaved, so I have. I put on the table vodka. So they have some little chocolate, some, some\nsomething. So they asked me questions. How was Germans? How -- what I worked, and\neverything. So I asked them, \"Where is the German? Where is the front?\" And everything.\nAnd one of them, they said, \"Well, why is so question like a spy?\" I said, \"You gave me\nquestions. Now I give you question. You know that is war. We had Russ-- German. Now I\nask you, where is the German? Maybe they will come back.\" And one of them: \"Oh, no.\nThey will not come back. We are far, far away after them. They will not come back.\" So\nwhen this all my 13, they were listening under the door. When they heard that the German\nwill not come anymore, they all opened the door and they come. And these two Russians,\nthey with their rifles, they didn't know who they are with the rifles. So I kept the rifle down. I\nsaid, \"Be quiet. Let us quiet, people.\" \"And who are there? Who are there?\" So then I told\nthem that they're Jewish people, and I kept them with this, my little sister. And I saved them,\nand they are quiet people. They are not bad people. And they all came, and they start to, to\nkiss these two, two, two soldiers. And when this they heard that they are Jews and they are\nsafe, they start to kiss. And because, they said in Russia they heard a lot what happened in\ntheir country, too. And they, they looked at me and my sister; and they said, \"Two girls!\"\nNot two girls, a girl and a half. And they embraced me, and they lifted me up. And they said,\n\u201cSwing rifle, swing rifle!\u201d (German)\n\"Hero! Hero!\" And sister, too. And they said that I am more a hero, bigger hero like the\nsoldiers on the front because soldiers are fighting with the rifles, with their friends against\nthe enemy. I didn't have nothing. So they said I am bigger hero. I fought with, with enemy\nwith nothing. Ah, that was -- and so they came out. And these soldiers were -- came back\nagain, and again and again. And otherwise they looked at me. They said, \"Oh, geroi,\ngeroi\u2019!\" -- \"Hero! Hero!\"",

        "A: Oh, that is close to, to the city called Bircza. And when I was born, sometimes hard to say\nbecause I never saw my certificate birth. So what mother told me at that time I was 16. So I\nhave to believe that. And during the war I went to, to city hall, and I made papers because I\nneed it. So I told what mother told me, so I am going with these papers until now.",
        "A: But really when I don't know. I don't need it know. Absolutely.",
        "A: Well, life was very good. My father and mother, you see, they didn't talk about too much\nwith, with children about what happened, how. But what I heard, that my grandfather\nreceived from some king a big possession, big land and home for some heroic things, but I\ndon't know what. And because the parents did tell. So we had, we had a lot of land and big\nhome, building, big. And what I remember...the people worked on the land, and the parents\npaid them, and, and I was little girl. So I remember also we had a lot of horses -- I think six\nhorses was, and a lot of animals, cows and chickens, what I hated. And we played around,\nrunning around; and, and that's all what was.\nThen maybe a year before war, father died. Yes. So mother was with us, and mostly sisters,\ntwo sisters older. They went to the city. They found the work there, and they worked. And\nthen I was maybe 12 years of age, I visit my sister with my mother, and I love it. They, they\nwork in Przemysl, where I was later; and when I came there first time, I don't know. I love\ncity. And I told to mother, \"Maybe I will stay.\" Mother said, \"No. You're too young.\" And I\nwanted to stay, but they didn't let me. But a few months later, I was visit again, with mother,\nmy sisters. So I said -- start to cry, and then I said to mother, \"I have to stay. I will not go\nback.\" You know, I don't know, maybe that was my destiny. I really don't know, but I hated\non the village this noise of the chickens and cows. I tell you, really, exactly at 12 o'clock at\nnight, roosters start to crow. Oy, that\u2019s makes me nervous. And in the morning, early in the\nmorning, chickens say \u201cCock-cock-cock-cock-cock\u201d That makes me nervous. So when I\nvisit the second time my sisters, was for me city was very quiet and was beautiful, and I start\nto cry, and I said to mother, \"I have to stay. I will not go back there.\" So was no rooster at\nnight that did crow.",
        "A: I think I was maybe 12 or 13. So my sister said, \"Ok, if--\" she said to mother, \" --1f she\nwanted to stay, she can stay. We have apartment. Not too big, but she can stay. We will find\nfor her some light, not too difficult work, and she will work. She can be not lazy here.\" So\nmother said, \"Ok, but how will it be with school?\" So I said to mother, \"Well, I will see later.\nNow is vacation.\" So I stayed with her, my sister. Mother returned. And older sister Mary,\nshe found work for me in some bakery. So I was putting the rolls and bread on the shelves,\nbut sometimes was too heavy for me. So one day sister came, and she saw and she said,\n\"Well, I will look something else for you. And that was special some woman who looks for a\nwork for a girl or some sister. And I went to her; and she said, \"Oh, for this little girl, I will\nthink I will have the work.\" And she went with me to some shop; and that was older woman,\na little corpulent, and a small shop with everything. And she saw me, and they talked\ntogether with this woman, and she said, \u201cWell, I, I really don't know the price,\u201d\u2019 what she\nwanted to pay me. Because she talked to this woman, and this woman later talked to my\nsister. So then she said I can stay with her, ok. And that was mother of present my husband,\nyes. And after few days, really she start to laughing, because, you see, I was young and I was\njumping, running, singing, dancing. And she was lonely. She had four sons, and they -- some\nworks. The other went to school, and husband was at home. He was old. So she was in this\nlittle shop alone, and lonely. But she said one day that I brought life to her life, to this little\nshop. So sometimes I was jumping through the -- these tables and, and she was -- sometimes\nshe tried to do also a little exercise, because she was sitting all day behind this, this, this\ndesk. And, and what I saw this part was too big.\nAnd sometimes, sometimes she had it difficult to go out; because it was really -- I don't\nknow how many years she was sitting there and that gathered all this fat. And also, when I\nstart to sell things went, came sometimes young people, and especially boys. I sell them\nchocolates. And some day, I gave them one. They said, \"Two.\" Ok. I gave them two, and\nthey paid for two. And some, they gave me, one for them. So how many chocolate I can eat?\nSo I put back. And she said, \"That is a double!\" I make money double for her, because I -- I\nam selling twice the same chocolate. So, you see. And I worked there maybe a year. And\nthen one day, I had enough. So, was too boring. And I found another work. And 1n a few\ndays I walked through this street and close to her shop, and she saw me. She called, and she\nstart to cry. She embraced me. And she said, \u201cIt is so sad in this little shop,\u201d and she's lonely,\nand she will double my pension and if I will return back. I said, \"I will see.\" And she said, \"T\n-- | cannot live without you.\" You see, sometimes her friends...she had a daughter, but\nsomething happened. Her daughter was sick, and she was in hospital; and some her friend,\nthey thought I am her daughter. Sometimes she said, \u201cYes, I am her daughter.\u201d So -- and she,\nshe really -- she was lonely. And so, why I said to you, I, I was jumping, dancing. And she\nsometimes she would smile all day. And then I returned back to her. And so I work with her.\nSometimes in the morning, when was not clients, so I run to her home back to bring her\nsome lunch. Something. Sometimes I ran to, to the market. I make some shopping, because\nthe husband was not capable to, to do that. For me that was fun. Run out.",
        "A: When the war began, and so I still was there, there. And my sisters were, were -- mother\ncame one day, and they said.",
        "A: Six. That was six. Mother had six girls and two boys -- really, she had three boys. One died.\nThat was later. Stayed two boys and six girls. That's a lot! So when war start, so I work,\nwork still there. And then my sisters lost the apartment, and I didn't have apartment. So this\nlady, she said, \"You can sleep in my house.\" But was no place, but it was little hole. And I\nsaid, \"Well, I can sleep here in this hole.\" So her husband, he make like a courtesan to cover\nmy bed, and that was rolling bed on the dirt at night. I make this bed, and daytime I put back\ntogether and to the corner. That was all. And that was few months. Then war start; and , the -\n- her sons and came German first. Her sons ran away to another city, to Lvov called, because\ncloser to Russia. Because all youngsters they wanted to run away from Germany to the\nRussia. And they went there, to Lvov, and they couldn't go farther. So after, I think, few\nweeks they returned back, and Russia came. And Russia conquered this part. But the other\npart, after the river San, that was still German. So this lady was very afraid what will be if\nGermany will come back.",
        "A: Well, that was normal. That was normal. Only difficult was with language. So that was few\nweeks was German. So on the street, mostly I was running on the street to buy some bread,\nto buy milk, everything. Was no shop or market, \"Star Market\" or \"Stop and Shop\" like here.\nJust on the street from the village women. So we were buying milk or butter, or something\nlike that. So mostly in the morning, I was on the street running to, to, to buy everything.\nSoon I heard on the street Germans speaking and so, German soldiers. Came Russia, just\nRussian soldiers and the Russian language. For me, was not really different because some\nfriends, they said, \"Well, now we have Russia. We don't know, maybe later we will have\nsomebody else. We have to use, be use to that.\" And our life start to be again normal. And\nshops were opened, and I was still living with my old lady in this shop. And then start again\nwar, again fighting, fighting; and again Germans were coming. And again these sons were\nrunning to the Russia border and to on the way to the Russia. Again to the Lvov. And so\ncame German and start to segregate people. And also after the few weeks, the sons returned\nback because the German were there also. So was no sense. They couldn't run away with the\nGer-- with the Russian soldiers. Something happened. I don't know why. They didn't run\naway there. So they coming back. And they, the German start to segregate people. They start\nto talk about all Jewish people start to wear this arm bands with stars. So for me that was\nsomething strange because I, I didn't know why the Germans start to segregate people, and\nwhy they mark these people with, with stars and white armbands. For me, this -- and for all\nour friends, we sometimes talked and we said what happened. After war -- before war -- was\neverything all right, really together; and we were all friends, more or less. But we were\nfriends. And now when Germans came to the country, they start to segregate people. So\nsometimes we were very disagreed with that, but we couldn't do nothing.\nSo then -- and you see, maybe why I later also helped, because when Germans were -- I'm\nsorry. I'm jumping so with.... So, on the street one day I walked, and I was surprised\neverything, some people start to talk something wrong about that. About Germans, war and,\nand when walked, some boy -- Jewish boy -- maybe 10 years of age, and the other boy was\nnot a Jew, and the other boy start to a little yell at this Jewish boy. And what -- so ordinary\nworker man, maybe 30 -- and he asked this boy, \"Why you yell at him?\" And this boy said,\n\"Well, be--because he is a Jew.\" And this man said, \"What he is a Jew? Look at him. He 1s\nthe same like you. You see he is not difference. Just German makes difference. Before was\nno difference. Look at him. He is a Jew, ok? Because that is his people gave this name -- a\nJew -- like you has the name of Pole. Every -- some groups, they give themselves some\nname. But look at him --the same skin like yours, like mine, like all of these people. The\nsame color of hair -- some are, some are darker, some are blonde. That depend.\" And said,\n\"And what that he's a Jew? You have to be friendly.\" That now is a war; and war will finish,\nand we will be all again friendly. And these boys, and, and this man said, \"Shake the\ntogether hands. Be friends.\" And for me that was something also new. You see, I looked and\nI said, \"Of course, we are the same.\" And you will laugh, but when I came home I looked at\nmy skin. Because I, I have no, no chance to educate myself about people. Was, was no, no\ntelevision -- like today, you can hear television, you can listen and people are talking. But\nwasn't that time. Radio some only people had. So, I, I just learned what I heard on the street.\nThat's all was.\nSo later I was surprised also that Germans segregate people. They start to talk about ghetto,\nand, and they made the ghetto. I helped to moved this -- my old lady with sons, with\nhusband, to move to ghetto. We, we are carrying a little something -- a chair not too heavy,\nsome luggages, some valises -- and they advised me also to, to find for myself some room.\nFor me, especially, with my name. I really didn't know where to look, but they told me, they\nshow me. And the same apartment, that was one room separate. And her husband told me\nwhere to go, and I went there. I brought paper. And he filled up everything, so I went there\nback to the city hall, and of building apartment. And they gave me permission for this one\nroom. And I was so proud that I have my own room.",
        "A: I think, at, at that time, I was maybe 17, maybe 16, 17 -- something like that, yes. So I had\nmy own room; and I was proud, very proud. So they went to ghetto. And all apartment, all\nthese building was empty, because there lived only Jews. And on the first floor, that was\nsome Catholic girl there. She lived there a long time ago. And sometimes we are laughing.\nWe came together, and she said -- she was older, she was maybe 21 -- and she said, \"Well,\nnow we are here host. We are owner of this building.\" And sometimes I was afraid, because I\nwas alone on the third floor. Was nobody there. But you see, then one night, I heard that\npeople were taken from the ghetto to concentration camp. And one night I heard the\nscreaming, my old lady and her apartment at that was across, and that was her voice. And in\nthe morning, I ran to the ghetto. And I, I had my special hole there, under the screen, and I\nknew there a, a few policemen and few German policemen. I often were a guest around the\nghetto. They, they knew me.\n101:23:57",
        "A: When I sneaked to the ghetto sometimes, that was -- the ghetto was around with barbed wire.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "A: No, absolutely no.",
        "A: I never was in the ghetto. I Just visit, yes. So when I ran to the ghetto, and I, I run to ghetto\nand I met there policeman who knew that me that I was very often there. And I told him I\nwanted to go inside. He said, \"You cannot go there. It is very dangerous.\" I said, \"I have to\ngo there! I have to visit my friend and tell him something.\" He said that was the -- they took\nthe people to the concentration camp, and some place. Anyway, it's very danger. You cannot\ngo there. And then came German policeman. I said, also, I didn't speak German, just few\nwords; but I told to this policeman, he Polish policeman -- he spoke very well German -- I\nsaid, told him that I've -- he have to disappear, and you, too, because I have to go to the\nghetto. And this German policeman said to me, \"Nein, nein, nein!\" He will not let me go\nthere. I said, \"I have to go there!\" And I said to this Po-- Polish policeman, \"Take him out\nsome place to the building, and you and go and disappear. Because I have to go there.\" And\nthey talked together and they went to some building. And I pulled out a little this screen, this\nwire, and I sneaked there and I went to, to their house, there to their apartment. So the\nparents that night were taken to the concentration camp. And because I heard screaming --\nthis lady, I heard voice -- because she cried that she left the children, and she didn't know\nwhat will be with her, with her husband. And they never returned back. And then again was\n\"Aktion;\"\u201d \"Aktion\" -- that called when they took the people to concentration camp. That\nwas the Aktion in the ghetto.",
        "A: Oh, yes. I saw when they took it very often to the wagon, people. So that was bridge,\nconnected from this place where I lived to the other side, to the ghetto. Before that was no\nghetto. That was normal streets there. People lived. But that was the bridge through by the\ntrain were passing under, the bridge that was train, that was tracks. So very often I was\nstanding on this bridge with some my friends. So I saw them, how they took the people to\nthe trains, and the wagon left. And very often I went to the ghetto. I smuggled the food there,\nand sometimes they gave me there. So they, these four brothers, they didn't have any more\nparents. So they were alone. Then they took their other brother -- one brother also to the\nconcentration camp, to Lvov -- that was a camp. And I visited there several times. I was\nthere. That was camp not only for Jews. That was for Poles, for Ukraines -- Gypsy -- that\nwas mix-it camp. So that also was one a policeman took care there, and he guarded there. So\nI made friends with him. So he sometimes he went there, and he called this brother Isaac (ph)\n-- my husband will show picture, I think, is here. And I brought food sometimes to him, and\nmessage. And so, I was lucky. I don't know why really, but I made it friends with people.",
        "A: I wasn't inside. I just this, this policeman, he took me one day to inside. But there came other\nguard, and he said, \"It's forbidden to people from outside to bring inside to the camp.\" He\n' \u201cNo, no, no!\u201d (German).\n* Murderous campaigns undertaken for political, racial, or eugenic ends (German).\nsaid, \"I am here working. I will not let my wife come here, or somebody else.\" So I saw just\na little. So then this, this policeman said, \"Ok, come on out.\"",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes. They called, they called this Isaac (ph). They call, and he came to this special room\n-- visit room. So I gave sometimes shirt clean or underwear, or something like that. And food\nI gave. But I came one day, and I -- we make arrangement. And this Isaac (ph), he asked me\n-- he wanted to run away. And he asked me to bring some old glasses and pair of shoes, that\nhe will dress differently, like on the street. And he will run away when I will come next time.\nOk. So I came next time. I brought everything. But I was late, and maybe three hours,\nbecause on the, on that -- well, you don't know but during the war was nothing in time.\nWhen I went by trolley, so soldiers stopped the trolley; because that the Germans, they called\nNachschub.\u201d Germans army was passing. And for them, that was first way supposed to be,\nnot for civilian. Just for the soldiers. So the train was waiting maybe two hours. Then one\nhour took me to get there. And this Isaac (ph), he waited for me. And, was another, some\nwoman that was maybe similar to me. And he thought that that's me, that I am waiting there,\nand he ran from the camp. And some guard saw him and ran after him, and took him back.\nAnd I don't know what happened there; but anyway, he was dead. That everything told me,\nfew hours later. His friend, whom I knew, also, from the same city -- they were neighbors.\nAnd he said \u201cIsaac (ph) is dead.\u201d And he said how that happened. And so I gave him this\nbread? What I brought -- this food. And I gave him, and then I, I returned back. And that\nwhat, what happened. And you see, I returned back. And then again was Aktion 1n the\nghetto, and ghetto was smaller and smaller. And one day, one brother with his fianc\u00e9e, he\nworks in some on the field, field with some with some farmers. They worked. They\ncultivated some vegetables. And they knew if German will have, will finish this war, so they\nwill not needed them anymore. And next day, I heard that the -- again there's no more\nghettos -- so ghetto still was, but again they took a lot of people to the concentration camp.\nAnd then that time, they took present my husband and his brothers, and others people they\ntook. And like he said that on the way, he knew that they will not survive. They will go --\nthey, they were going to -- for a death. Nothing more. So he wanted to commit suicide. He --\nhe wanted to jump from running train, and he will be killed anyway. He wanted to commit\nsuicide. And he bro-- broked the barbed wire from the window, make a hole and he jumped.\nAnd he told his brother also to jump after him. That they will be killed, and they will not\nhave to go anymore to concentration camp. But he jumped, and he wasn't killed. And brother\ndidn't jump. What he said later, Joe, when he jumped he had a bread. And this bread, he\n\u00b0 Supplies, either personal or material (German).\ncovered it here on the chest. When he jumped, and he was slide because the, the, the force of\nthe air pushed him and he was slide. And he stopped on the post, some post, and the post hit\nhim here on the chest in exactly what was the bread. And he had big hole on the bread, but\nthis bread saved his chest.",
        "A: Bread.",
        "A: Loaf of bread, he had here. And this bread, loaf of bread, saved his chest.",
        "A: Yes. And when he woke up, the train was far away; and he looked and he didn't find his\nbrother. He didn't jump; but jumps other two people, some strange people. And he found\nthem. One was broken here, this clavicle area, however, so he helped him. The other man\njumped, young man. He had -- was broken something, hand here. So he helped them, and\nthey walked a little. And they went to some man that Joe knew him before war. They went\nsometimes to skiing. And he, this man, had like some little cafeteria, and they came to him,\nand Joe said, \"You remember me.\" So this man said, \"Oh, yes. I remember.\" But he said,\n\"You know, I am a Jew. And I jumped from the run-- running train that goes to the\nconcentration camp. So can you accept me? Can I stay here only one night?\" Because was\ncold. And he said, \"Ok, ok. You can stay.\" And he asked about friends. He said, \"Ok, stay\nwith your friends.\" And they let him stay and give what he could, some warm coffee and\nsome little -- he washed them, helped them, and in the morning they left. Early in the\nmorning. So the next, in the evening, he went to another friend that he -- in Przemysl, the\nother friend, that he -- same city in Przemysl. And this man -- so he let him stay during -- all\nday he let him stay. But at night, in the evening, he said, \"My wife is scared.\u201d Because of the\nGestapo law, who was, \u201cWho will help the Jews will be punished by death.\" Of course,\neverybody was afraid. So this man said, \"My wife is afraid. I have children. So if somehow\nGestapo will discover, so we will be all killed. So maybe you will find some -- another place,\nsome-- somehow maybe somebody will take you.\"\nSo Joe, he didn't know if I am still living in the same place or no. And he -- but this man\nbrought him to the city; because he, this man, lived a little behind the city. He brought him,\nand he let him go. And Joe said, \"Ok, I will go out.\" And this man said, \"Maybe God will\nhelp you. Maybe after the war we will meet again. And good luck.\" And he left. And Joe\nwent to the same building where I lived and his parents before lived, and he went to the\nbasement because he didn't know what will, if he can come to me or no. For he, he thought\nthat few days he will be in the, in the basement. When he came there. Well, basement the\nbasement. Was some rats, mice, cats, sometimes were fighting, and that was maybe 11\no'clock in the evening. He was afraid also. And he was thirsty, hungry. And he was wounded\nalso from the running train. When he jumped, he was wounded -- hands and face and knees;\nand he was afraid sometimes maybe some neighbors will come to the basement and will see\n-- find him. So he took the risk to come out. Maybe I will let him go if I am still in the same\nplace and the same room. So he knocked. I was surprised for this knocking to my door so\nlate in the evening. So I asked, \"Who is there?\" He said, \"Joe.\" \"Joe who?\" And he said,\n\"Well, you remember Joe. You worked with my mother. Is Joe from this little shop.\" \"Ok.\" I\nopened. Well, I saw Joe. But that was no Joe. That was like three disasters together. Dirty,\nwounded, the blood on the face, blood on the hands, hands were very swollen. And so, \"Ok,\"\nI said. And he asked -- and he said, \"If you let me stay through the night, only one night. And\ntomorrow in the morning I will go out some place. But one night. I said, \"Ok, come on.\" And\nmy sister, she didn't know who was the Joe, and she didn't know who are the Jews, really.\nShe didn't know the difference.",
        "A: She was six and a half at that time. So I explain. I said, \"That is my friend, the Joe.\" And she\nasked, \"Why he is so dirty? Why he has some blood on the hands?\" I said, \"He fell, fell\ndown some place.\" And so she helped me to washed him, and little so.... And I didn't have\npajama for him, and I gave him my nightgown. And my sister, she laughed and she said,\n\"Oh, now we have two Fusia, not one.\" She called me from Stefania, the Fusia. I'm Fusia.\nAnd she laughed, and she -- \"Well, that is Fusia, and that is another Fusia.\" And he, I put him\nto the bed and he couldn't sleep because he was so excited and that he lost everything, and all\nnight -- and he had a fever also. All night he was calling, \"Mother!,\" \"Father!,\" and\n\"Brother!\" Why he didn\u2019t, didn't jump. All night: \"I am jumping, I am -- jump after me.\" He\ncalled still that this, this brother, that he should jump. All night I was sitting behind -- beside\nhis bed, and quiet because I was afraid maybe somebody will heard this girl have a man in\nher room. In the morning, he felt a little better. So I made some tea, and then I bought some\nlittle milk and he felt a little better. And still he had a high fever. So he was a few days. And\nduring the day came friend of mine. So I didn't -- her -- didn't want to see her, a man, so I\nsaid to, to Joe, \"Jump under the bed.\" So he jump under the bed, and all his clothes I put, put\nwith, with him. And I said, \"Keep you feet, feet cannot sticking out. And don't, don't breathe\ntoo loud. Don't sneeze.\" And I covered the bed longer with a blanket, that nobody will see\nhim. And he was stayed, I think, week or, or week and a half he was in, in my home. And\nthis man, my bed. And I slept in the other bed with my sister.\nAnd I have to enlighten my sister a little: who is the, the Joe, who are the Jews. And so\nsometimes I took her around the ghetto, and I show her that is the Jews. And she asked a\nquestion, \"Who are they, these Jews? What kind of people?\" She didn't know. So I explain\nher, and I told her that Joe is a Jew; and she said, \"But he is the same like you, like me. Like\nother men. He's the same!\" I said, \"Yes, he is the same.\" So I have to explain her the same\nwhat I heard this worker told to this little boy, who are the Jews: the same skin, the same\neverything, only the name is a the difference. And I told her, \"You remember the mother,\none time she said that God 1s one for all people. Only people choose some leaders, like she\nsaid Jews took the, the Moses. That is sust a counsel. But God is one. The other people\nchoose their counsel. But they, all these leaders counsels go to one God.\" And so I explained\nthe same to my sister, because I had no -- I had no other way. So that she can understand a\nlittle more who are the Jews and why Gestapo are killing Jews. I, I said, \"I don't know really\nwhy. I cannot tell you why, but they killed them. So we will try to help.\" And so she, she was\nenlightened a little who are the Jews. And, and then I --",
        "A: Yes, yes. This is the pictures during the war and this picture 1s a little later.",
        "A: Yes. This is earlier. This is a little later. That 1s almost before, when war was ended. Almost,\nthis picture. But that, that is a little earlier. You see this skirt, that is not mine. That is one of\nthe women whom I hid in the bunker. She was -- why? Because was time where when they\nhad no more money, so I have to exchanged dresses for our food. So I exchange all my better\ndresses for a food, and then I had only one dress.\nAnd then I started to -- they started to, to look among themselves what they have to\nexchange. So I had only one dress, and the Sunday -- sometimes if I wanted to go out and\nhave something, I didn't have dress. Only to work. So this woman, she was with two\nchildren. And she said, \"Well, maybe this skirt...you will take mine.\" She said, \"It's in good\ncondition, so try.\" And I tried, ok. And that is her, her skirt, because I didn't have. I\nexchanged for a food. Listen, 13 people that I needed a lot of food for them. 13 them, two of\nus. That was together 15 people. I needed a lot of food. So that is my sister, and that's me.\nAnd that is later, almost when war was ended.",
        "A: That\u2019s all right.",
        "A: Yes. And then I, I went where work his brother. When he works there on the field with his\nfianc\u00e9e. I went there to tell him that Joe is all right; and he jumped from the train and he\ncame to me. I went there and I told him. And he said, \"Ok, but anyway he will be dead now\nor later. He -- they will kill us.\" And his fianc\u00e9e, Danuta (ph) her name was, and she asked\nme maybe they will come to me also because when they will not needed them anymore, so\nthey will kill them. I said, \"I don't know. I have only one room.\" And the evening when they\nwent back to the ghetto, she run away. She asked Henick (ph) -- her fianc\u00e9, Joe's brother --\nthat maybe he will run away from the way. And he was afraid, and she said, \"You are going,\nor no?\" He said, \"No, I am not going.\" And she ran away by herself, and she came to me. So\nnow I, I have two Jews.\nBut she two days later greeted me also unexpectedly friend of mine, and Joe were jumping\nunder the bed, and I wanted her to jump, but at that moment friend of mine opened the door.\nAnd I just pretended that I am making the bed, to cover Joe under the bed with the blanket.\nAnd she saw this Danuta (ph), and she asked me, \"Oh, who is that?\" I said, \"Well, that 1s a\nfriend of mine.\" And, \"What's she doing here? When she came?\" Because she knows\neverything. Only was two of us in whole building. So you know, I don't know how these lies\ncame to me. I told her that this friend, she's pregnant and she didn't want her parents know\nthat she 1s pregnant. And she wanted to make abortion, and she ran away from parents and\nshe came to me, yes. I don't know how I make up these stories. And this friend had -- she\ntold, \"Well, that's very easy.\" And she asked how months she's pregnant. I said, well, that is\ntwo months. And I really didn't know how, how, how long she was to say she was pregnant,\nbecause I didn't know the difference. The shorter, the longer -- I said, \"Two months.\" And\nshe said -- she gave advice, and she said to her, \"Well, first of all, you have to make a hot\nbath. And you will, will sit there in the hot water maybe half an hour. Then you make\nexercise -- very, very strong exercise. Then again hot water, and then a run on the steps.\" I\nlived on the third floor. She said, \"Run on the steps several times: up and down, up and\ndown. And make strong exercise, and that will go out.\" I said, \"Well, you have experience!\"\nShe said, \"Well, a little.\" And I told to Danuta (ph), I said, \"Listen carefully. You have to do\nthat.\" And I asked her, this neighbor, I said, \"Well, how I will make bath, hot bath for her? I\nhave no bath here. There is nothing.\" She said, \"Well, all right.\" And she said, \"I will borrow\nyou...\" She had like a big, big, some rounded -- some pot.\nShe said, \"You will warm water in the pot, and then put here warm water. And she will sit,\nand you will add every so 10 minutes or 15 minutes hot water. And that will be all nght. And\nthen exercises.\" And I said to Danuta (ph), \"Listen, you have to do that if you want to get rid\nof these things when you have that.\" And then my friend, she left. And then she brought me\nthis big pot. And I thanked her very much for her advice, and I said to Danuta (ph), \"You\nthanks her, because that was for you.\" And she said, \"Thank you very much.\" And she asked,\n\"That will help?\" She said, \"Ok, that will help. You will see that will help.\" \"Ok.\" So the\nneighbor left, and we laugh a little. I said, \"Will you jump?\" And next day I went to the\nghetto, and this brother, he was waiting around. He knew the place that mostly I were\ncoming there. And I met him there; and he said, \"Well, here in the ghetto everything 1s quiet.\nIt's all right. They can return back.\" I said, \"I don't know.\" So he said, \"I already found a\nroom.\" \"Ok.\" So I went back, and I told Danuta (ph) and Joe how it is. She said, \"I will not\ngo back.\" And Joe also told, \"I will not go back for a death there. There, there is only death,\nnothing more. But what is doing this Henick (ph)?\"",
        "A: Ok.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: Yes. Oh, I did not finish about the ghetto, yes. So that night came back, and I told that\nHenick (ph) is back in the ghetto and everything 1s all right there. And they said they will not\ngo back. But after noon, came some men knocking to the door. And I asked who. He said,\n\"Friend.\" \u201cWhat a friend?\u201d I didn't know this voice. So I opened the door; and this man\npushed the door and he came into the room. And that's good that Joe, in time, jumped under\nthe bed.\nBut Danuta (ph) was -- wasn't. And he came this man, and he pointed out on Danuta (ph).\nAnd he said, \"Oh, this is the girl. This is the Jewish girl from the ghetto.\" And I was\nsurprised and I thought, \"Oh, that is....\"\" Because I heard that the Germans had a lot of spies.\nThere are spies. They were around. And spies. So I thought that is probably German spy.\nAnd he knew her and he came; and now probably he will kill me and Danuta (ph), and\nHelena, too. And he -- this man said, \"Yes, that is the ghetto, Jewish ghetto. She run away\nfrom the ghetto. And you fianc\u00e9, Henick (ph), he told me that you have to come back to the\nghetto. He begged me that I will come here and I will bring you back to the ghetto.\" And you\nsee, when I heard that I was really angry. I said, \"What a miserable thing!\" How could he\nsend someone that I don't know? Who is he to send and tell her -- him my name, my\naddress? And he told who was the girl, that she is the Jewish girl and she is in my home. I\nwas angry. But Danuta (ph) said, \"I will not go back to the ghetto.\" He said, \"Oh, girl, you\nhave to go. You are a Jew, and your fianc\u00e9 said that I have to bring you back.\" So I said later,\nand he doesn't, he, he said that Henick (ph) will not pay him until he will bring her back. So I\nsaid, \"I will bring her back to the ghetto if she will not go with you. So you will be sure he\nwill pay you.\" He said, \"Ok, I will leave you here during the day.\" And he said to me, \"But\nyou have to bring her back.\" And she signed her signature and word that Henick (ph), Josef's\n-- her fianc\u00e9, Josef's brothers, he have to pay this man and she will return back to the ghetto.\nAnd the man left. And I was really angry, and Joe was angry, too. And Danuta (ph). How\ncould he do that? But anyway, sometimes that is --. So in the evening, they said they will go\nback to the ghetto. They will not longer risk my life for them. If the ghetto still there, they\nwill go back, ok. I will give them the food what I had, and I dressed them like on the street in\nthe evening. So Danuta (ph), I gave some my dress, some jacket that she will look like a girl,\nand we took Joe between us. And we walked and we laugh and we joking sometimes when.,\nwhen Germans.... I said to her, \"Hey, you laugh a little and be joking that this looks like a\ngirl's walk with a man.\" And they are smile and joking, and something like that. And we\ncame around the ghetto. Henick (ph) was waiting there. And I said, \"How could you do that?\nYou are skunk. You couldn't go or come by yourself!\" Because he was too afraid. \"You sent\nsome man that I didn't know him. Nobody knows him. And you told him my address, my\nname!\" He said, \"Ah, that 1s good man.\" I said, \"You know him?\" \"No, but I heard he is a\ngood man.\"\nAnd Joe was also angry. And Danuta (ph) said to him, \"Listen, Henick (ph), I will scratch\nyou eye or you, you face. Everything.\" She was so angry at him, ok. We say -- said goodbye,\nand they went there. I went home. And every second day, Joe were coming to me.\nSometimes twice a week from the ghetto, because they needed food. Was difficult to get\nfood there. And I -- and he brought sometimes skirt, sometimes glove, sometimes dress. I ran\nto the, to the market, and I exchanged for the food and I gave them. Later one day, he came,\nand came friends -- one boy from work -- and Joe jumped under the bed and then he came\nfrom under the bed. He got ide maybe I will find a bigger apartment, that I will take them\nfrom the ghetto to hide them. I said, \"Where did you get this idea? Under the bed?\" He said,\n\"Yes.\" I said, \"Go back under the bed.\" \"And to think about something else if you are\nthinking under the bed. So go back and think.\" He laughed. I said, \"Reverse your thinking.\"\nHe said, \"Ok, I am going back.\" And you see, exactly this time, a girl was knocked on -- to\nthe door; and again came the same neighbors. And we talk a little, and she ask, \"That this\nfriend, this friend, she had abortion? She, she made miscarriage?\" I said, \"Yes, you, you\nadvice was wonderful. Wonderful.\" She said, \"If you need it, do the same.\" So all the time,\ntwice a week, Joe was coming to me and still drilling a little to find apartment, to find\napartment. And one day, he came and he said in the ghetto his brother was ill. He got the\ntyphus. And his friend and they needed more food and better food -- like a milk, like a butter,\na little cheese.\nAnd again I have to run on the street or sometimes go on the village. Sometimes I walked\nthirty miles on the village, because I knew there someone to exchange some dresses and\nbring the food to the ghetto. So one day he said maybe I will ask this -- my neighbor, this\nMary who lived on the first floor -- she was a good friend -- maybe we together we will find\nsome apartment, and we will take him, his brother, and his friend from the ghetto because\nthey, they heard the ghetto will be finished. They will take all Jews to the concentration\ncamp, or to kill. I don't know what -- will be no more ghetto. So they wanted to run away\nfrom the ghetto. Maybe together with friend, we will take some apartment and we will take\nfew Jews from him and other. So I invite friend of mine, this Mary, and I told her. And I\nsaid, \"Listen, Mary. You see the Jews are killing and taken to concentration camp. Maybe\nwe will help few of them. Maybe we will find bigger apartment, and we will take few Jews -\n- these friends, some. You have also friends, some friends, Jewish friends. So we will maybe\nhelp them.\" \"You know,\" she said to me, \u201cStefusia,\u201d she said, \u201cI am 21. You are 17,\nprobably. You know Gestapo law. We saw on the on the street there was the posters that was\nthat sign by Gestapo: \u2018who will help the Jews will be punished by death.\u2019\" And was posters\nalso on the same, on our building also, the same poster sign by Gestapo. She said, \"You read\nthat. If you forget, go read again. That is maybe one percentage on the million that we can\nhelp and be alive. But this million, one million, that we can be dead.\" And she said to me, \"I\nam too young to go to the grave for a Jew. If you want it, that is your life. If you wanted to\nbe killed, to go to the grave in your young age, you can go. That is your choice.\"\nBut she said, \"I don't like to be dead. And I am too young to be buried.\" And she said, \"No, I\nam sorry. I will not help you. I will not take Jews and help, because that 1s death.\" And I\nsaid, \"Ok, Mary. If you don't like, maybe I will not take also.\" And I told her, \"Mary, please\ndon't tell -- don't mention to nobody.\" She said, \"Don't worry. I already got amnesia. I\nalready forget everything. Don't worry. Everything gone from my head and my mind.\" And\nok. So Joe came in the evening. I told him how Mary refused. He said, \"Well, ok.\" I said,\n\"Well, maybe I will take by myself. I will look for apartment.\" And I looked. I didn't know\nreally where to go. But I look. And Joe advised me to go there, where was mostly Jewish\nstreet. And now was empty. That. Go there. Maybe there you will find apartment, ok. I went\nthere. Was really empty, whole street. But was every apartment, I running up and down. Was\nno floor, was no doors, was no windows. No nothing. So I thought, \"Well, floors is not\nnecessary. But doors and windows, that is necessary!\" Then I looked -- oh, sorry, then I\nlooked around. If I will find some apartment there, I will take in these people where I will\nhide him, them. But was not apartment, was nothing. I thought, \"Maybe from another\nbuilding I will take some windows, some doors.\" But was no-- nothing. You see, I went out\nand I stood on the street and I thought, \"Where to go now?\" I didn't know where to go.\nEmpty. And I was frightening a little, so ghostly. You were laughing, really, but I heard a\nvoice. I heard a voice. When I stood and thinking, and I asked, \"Dear God, where I supposed\nto go now to look for apartment? Where?\" I looked around, and was a little scared because\nwas nobody there.\nAnd then I heard the voice. Some voice told me, \"Don't be afraid, and go a little farther there.\nAfter this corner, there 1s standing two women, women who clean the street, and they are\nsupporting on the brooms. And ask them for apartment. They will tell you.\" So I was\nlistening; and then I said, \"Well, what is with ordinary women who clean the street? What\nthey will know about apartment?\" And this voice said to me, \"Go and ask. They will know.\nThey will tell you.\" So I still thought, \"Well, what they will know?\" And this voice again\ntold me, \"Go. Please go.\" And I felt like a little pushed, and said, \"Go and ask, and ask for a\njanitor there.\" And I said, \"All right, all right. What I can lose?\" And I am going exactly this\nway, like this voice told me. And aft-- after the corner, and I saw two women, and they are,\nthey were talking together and supporting on the brooms, ok. I approached them. And I\nasked, \"Ladies, maybe you know some apartment? I am looking for apartment. And there's\nnothing here. I looked here, but there's nothing. Maybe you familiar with this area or\nsomething?\" They said, \"All right. We know apartment.\" And one of them, she said, \"Oh, 1s\napartment empty. Tatarska (ph) 3. You go this way, Tatarska (ph) 3 -- that is little small\ncottage, one family.\nAnd over there is woman janitor, and you ask for this woman janitor, and she will show you\nthis apartment. Is nice, nice apartment.\" And go, and they show me the way. And they said,\n\"Tatarska (ph) 3, go that way and ask for this apartment. And janitor is there, woman. She\nwill tell you.\" I thanked them, and I went there. And I went to this janitor; and I told her,\nasked her for apartment. She said, \"Ok.\" There across is apartment. And she said, \"Ok, I will\ntake the keys. I will show you.\" And she opened the door and I went inside. It's really -- it's\ntwo rooms, something wrong. It's two rooms and a kitchen, separate attic. It's very nice. I\nlooked around. She said, \"Well, only bad thing is here is no running water inside. There's no\nelectricity. Toilet 1s outside. It's primitive. But is nice.\" And she asked me, \"How many\npeople is?\" \"T have,\" I said, \"By myself and my sister.\" She said, \"Oh, that 1s big apartment\nfor you. You not have to have electricity. You can have a candle, or...or kerosene la...lamp.\nAnd to go to the toilet, you not have to use at night. It's enough daytime.\" \"Ok,\" I said. And\nshe told me where to go to...to reach man that he will give me application and everything.\nAnd he is, he takes care of everything around these apartments, all apartments. All right. So I\ncame home. In the evening, Joe came; and I told him that I saw apartment and I told him,\n\"Primitive, very primitive.\" He said, \"Ok, that may be better.\" And in the evening he dressed\nlike.... He said, \"I have to see that apartment.\" And he told me, \"You will tell that I am your\nbrother. I have to see this apartment.\" \"Ok.\" He make artificial mustache and make up a little\nand everything; and evening, we run there. And I went to the janitor, and I said, \"That is my\nbrother. He wanted to see apartment.\" And she gave me the keys. And I went, opened, and\nhe looks around and he said, \"That is perfect.\" And he looked at attic, and he said, \"That will\nbe very nice.\"\nAnd I said, \"That is like a dream for this deadly business.\" So I told the janitor that I will take\nthis apartment. And...but that was evening. She said, \"Ok, tomorrow morning you can go to\nthis and this man, and he will give you application and everything.\" Ok. In the morning, in\nthis same evening, Joe went back to the ghetto. In the morning, I didn't went to work so I ran\nto, to this man. He sent me to the building apartment. He gave me, \"Here's\nrecommendation.\" And I went to the building apartment; and they gave me application and I\nwent back, I came home. I filled up everything, and I went back there. And the secretary\nwere there, there was a lot of people for apartment, but secretary is woman, very fine. She\nsaw me and she heard: \"You are back!\" I said, \"Yes. I have everything all ready.\" And she\ntook it from me; and she said, \"In four days, come back. I think we be ready.\" I said, \"Really,\nyou will take care of it?\" She said, \"Yes.\" And ok. In four day, after four days, I came, and\nshe saw me and she yelled to me, \"I have for you. I have, I have.\" So I came, and she gave\nme and I kissed her. She said, \"Yes, now you have a bigger apartment. Not just a studio.\"\nAnd I kissed her and man who stood on the line for apartment, too. And he -- she -- he told,\n\"Maybe....\" To the secretary, \"Maybe...maybe I will kiss you. Maybe you will give me\napartment, also.\" She said, \"No, this girl was before you a few days.\" So -- and then I had\nthis license my. And in the evening -- and I ran directly to the ghetto, and I told Joe that I\nhave already apartment. And he start to organize there people and everything, a little money.\nAnd little by little, I -- first of all, I moved with my sister there. And my sister, when she saw\ntwo rooms and a kitchen separate. Oh, she, she lied on the floor and she, she rolled. And she\nsaid, \"So big place!\" And we moved right away to this bigger apartment.\nAnd she was happy. And then start to -- first Joe and another man also with father, first when\nwas everything ready. So from the ghetto they came. I went six o'clock, before six o'clock,\nunder the ghetto. They were ready there. And then we met in some place -- not under the\nghetto, a little farther -- and they were dressed like a workers, and they kept the hands like\nsome can with coffee or something like that. And they are going to the work. And I brought\nthem home. And two by two, with time, they came. And I had already seven people.",
        "A: Third came Joe with this man other, his friend -- Zenek his name. Then came girl from the\nghetto. She is in Brussels now. Then came another man with his friend. Then came this two\nfather -- men from -- father from this man who came with Joe first time and father this girl\nwho was already in my home. You see what happen? Also little tragic, but a comedy. When\nthese two father were prepared to come, I came to the ghetto and they arrange with the\nJewish postman that they will take them from the ghetto as a post office man. That nobody\nwill control them. Because postman from the ghetto every day comes out of the ghetto to the\ncity to take mail, and comes and brings to the ghetto.\nSo they make arrangement with the postman to take them as his helpers, to take them out\nfrom the ghetto. But they paid him to take them out of the ghetto. But somehow -- I don't\nknow if this man or other some, they denounce them to the German police. And what\nhappened, I said, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d These men, they took them from the -- by mail, wagon\nmail, from the ghetto. And he knew the city of Przemysl very well, this man. Every day he\nwas going from the ghetto to the, to the mail box, and that time that day he forgot the way.\nAnd he was surrounding three times around the city. He couldn't go straight to the mail box.\nHe forgot! But what happened, I saw, we were waiting for them, for these two father. The\npolicemen are waiting on the -- our street. Was two, two Polish policemen, and two German\npolicemen. And they were walking up and down, up and down. Exactly at Tatarska (ph) 3.\nUp and down. I was a little angry. So we wait. Past one hour, two hour. They didn't come. So\nI talk. I said to Joe, \"I will go out.\" He said, \"No, don't go out. If you will go out, exactly this\nfather can come here. So who will open the door?\" I said, \"No, I have to go out. I have to\nsomething, some -- take some walks.\" And I am passing this policeman. And I said, \"Good\nday!\" And I said, \"Oh, I surprised that you are here. What happened here? Somebody was\nkilled, or something like that?\" They said, \"No, something, something maybe will be.\" I said,\n\"Well, maybe you protecting us. Maybe we'll be -- we're landing here Hitler and Stalin, and\nwe'll fight here. That you are here, maybe you will protect us.\" They said, \"Well, if they will\ncome here and fight, we will maybe help you to kill them both and will be war over.\"\nAnd we laughed together, really. And I wanted to pass them, and they wanted also to talk.\nAnd they said, \"Well, miss. Talk a little!\" I said, \"No, I have to go some place. At least if you\nwill tell me why you are standing here...\" And passing exactly German policeman, and he\nasked something then and they told them something. I don't know what. I was not\ninteresting. And they pass, and they walk up and down. And I said, \"If you will tell me why\nyou are standing here, I will talk to you. If no, bye.\" So came another policeman, and he said,\n\"Well, of course, we can tell you. Why not?\" And they said, \"German policeman -- police\nreceived yesterday a note, a telephone, that today will leave ghetto some two rich Jews. And\nthey order us to, to catch them. And you see, these two German policemen, they watch -- are\nwatching us, too. They don't believe us. They watching us. We watching them. And we all\nwatching for these two Jews. Two rich Jews. Probably German wanted to have also their\nmoney, or something like that.\" You see, when I heard that, and I was inspected -- expected -\n- these two fathers, my heart fell down to the heels. And I said, \"Oh, God, what will be\ntoday? Will, will I, will I be killed today or no? What will happen today?\" You see, and I\nwent -- I said, \"Well, thank you.\" And I said, \"I don't think if some Jews will risk their life to\ngo out of the ghetto. They know they will be killed if they will leave ghetto. I don't know if\nthey will risk their life.\" Policeman said, \"Well, I don't know. I think also this same way, but\nwe received the note that we have to watch. So...\"\nAnd I asked, \"But why you standing exactly here, Tatarska (ph) 3?\" \"Because,\" he said,\n\"they don't know which number they will come. But some -- someplace between 5 in 1 --\nand 1. So we stand here, 3. We observe for 1, 2 and 4, 5. And we have good view, so we\nobserve. And that is in the middle, 3.\" I said, \"Oh.\" I thought, \"Dear God, they had the right\nnumber.\" And I said, \"Ok, thank you.\" And I said, \"I don't think that they will come, that\nthey will risk their lives to come.\" And I went a little farther. That was a church, and I went\nto this church, and I prayed and I asked God to take somehow this Germans and this other\npoliceman from here, that these two fathers will be not caught here. I prayed and I really\nasked God to help, to take out somehow these policemen. And I -- ok, and then I came home.\nStill was nobody. And sadly, this one, the Zenek one, the fathers -- the son of one of these\nfathers, he stand at the window a little farther and nobody can see him. And he observed.\nAnd exactly that time the policemen went up. All of them. And they talked, and came one\nfather. This girl's father. And he came on the back yard, and he didn't know where to go. And\nhe met the janitor, the woman, and he asked but -- before we talked together with this man if\nhe will met someone that he will tell that he is from work, because that time I will not go to\nwork, that he will a little angry at me why I didn't come to work. That he is from work. And\nhe came, and he asked the janitor and why I didn't come to work. And he was angry a little,\nand janitor said, \"Well, she is a good girl. She lives here, but she is a good girl. She's work\nvery hard, and she has a, a little sister. So she have to take care of little sister. Don't be bad to\nher. She is a good girl.\" And she show him where I am living. And I opened the door, and I\nsaid, \"Oh,\" what his name was, this mister who was in the in the factory. I said, \"I am sorry I\ndidn't come to work today, but I had a pain in my knee. I am so sorry. But I will be\nafternoon, for sure, tomorrow.\" And he said, \"You miserable girl! You didn't come to work\ntoday.\"\nAnd I closed the door, and -- ok. And I asked him, \u201cWhere 1s the other father?\u201d The, the\nHirsch (ph) is the -- name of Hirsch (ph). He said, \"I don't know. This man, he, he was lost,\nthe mail man. And he -- three times around and around the city, and he lost his way.\" And he\nsaid, \"He put us out of his carriage. And I lost the, the, the Hirsch (ph), the Schilinger.\" And I\nthought they, all my people were a little nervous. And after few minutes the son, who was\nwatching, and he said, \"Oh, it's my father! It's my father!\" And here came the other father.\nHe came. And he did -- the Zenek came, \"Oh, Miss Fusia! Miss Fusia, my father!\" And he\ntooked me and he lifted me up. And he said, \"Go out. Bring my father. Go out. Meet my\nfather.\" And I opened the door, and I asked, \"Oh, you again? Also from the work?\" And I\ntook him home. And my feeling...he came home, and he said, \"Oh, God, we are discovered!\nWe are discovered. Look, Gestapo will be here. We are discovered.\" And he start to running\nfrom one corner to the other. \"We are discovered!\" \"What happened?\" I said, \"Mr. Hirsch\n(ph), what happened?\" \"Be quiet.\" \"What happened?\" \"Gestapo will be here. We are all\nkilled. We are all killed.\" And I said, \"Quiet! What happened?\" And he said, \u201cStory -- what,\nwhat happened?\u201d And that he said, \"I lost Schilinger, this foreman. I lost him.\" And then he\nsaid, \"I went here to this Tatarska (ph) 3. And exactly a few doors before, one man caught\nme and put me to the inside to the building. And he said to me, 'I know you are a Jew and I\nknow you are going to hide here 'til some Polish people.' Said, 'But I needed money. Give me\nsome money. I know you are rich. Your people know that you will come here.\" And this\nfather, he was prepared for that. And he had ten thousand zlotys* in the pocket, and he --\n[TECHNICAL PROBLEM]\nOh, yes, and he said he gave him this, this 10,000 zlotys. And he asked, \"May I go now?\"\nThis man said, looked out and he said exactly the German policemen was crossing, walking.\nHe took him back and he said, \"No, you cannot go now.\" He said to him, \"I am a thief, but I\nam not killer.\" He said, \"I got what I wanted. I don't like -- I don't want you life. So go to this\nfamily. I know you are going to be hide some Catholic family, whoever they are. And good\nluck. Maybe after war we will meet.\" And he again went out. He looked that policemen were\nout, higher a little. He said, \"Now it is all night. Go.\" And he let him go, then. Because he\n* Polish monetary unit (Polish).\nwas angry when he came. He had -- he said, \"We are discovered. We are discovered.\nGestapo will be here. Gestapo will be here.\" \"We quiet him,\" I said. \"Maybe we will be not\nGestapo. Quiet!\" But anyway, I was afraid because that is some, some man; we didn't know\nwho. Maybe he observed where, where he were going. But everything was all right.",
        "A: The other, yes. You see, one day came to me two, really, some street boys. And they brought\nme a letter. They gave me a letter, and they said some woman gave them from the ghetto.\nAnd she paid them to, to deliver this letter to me. I start to read, and I see some woman\nnamed Zimmerman (ph)n (ph). I don't know who 1s she. I said, \"I don't know who 1s she.\"\nAnd they said they required my signature to, to, to give her back, that she will pay them. And\nshe will have proof that they delivered me this letter. I said, \"I don't know. I don't know her.\"\nBut anyway, I went to my people and I asked them. And they said, \"Ok, give them your\nsignature.\"\nAnd this woman asked me to come there to the ghetto, and she said 1n this letter that she\nknows that I will take Jews, and she knows that I have a few. And she mentioned the names\nthe people and, and she said that I had to take her and her two children. If no, she will\ndenounce me to Gestapo. I a little was upset. But I gave my signature, and I said, \"Go back. I\ndon't know who 1s the woman.\" And we discussed among this people, my people, and they\nsaid they don't know who its she. Next day these same boys came. And Joe's brother was still\nin the ghetto, still was there, and his fianc\u00e9e. And these boys came, and I read this letter\nagain. And again this same question, blackmail, to take her and her, her children. If no, she\nwill go to Gestapo. She knows whom I have already. So I said, \"I gave my signature.\" They,\nthe boys, left. And I told to my people, I said, \"I will go. I will say -- see what she wanted\nand who is she.\" I came there. I went to the ghetto. And I met Joe's brother, his fianc\u00e9e, and\nthey introduced me to, to, to this woman. And I said to her, \"You know, you are miserable.\nYou know, you are a killer.\" I said, \"You -- ok, you sent a letter. You can tell in the letters\nthat you wanted to meet me. You...you could say that the Henick (ph) is sick, or Danuta (ph)\nis sick. That they wanted to see me, and here we can talk. But in the letter, you, you sent\nsome streets boy. I didn't know who are they. And you mentioned the people, that I have the\nJews, a few Jews. And you blackmail me, and you said that you will go to Gestapo if, if I\nwill not take you.\" I said, \"Did you have do that? You are killer!\" I said, \"You go, you go to\ntell, 'Come on to visit because Henick (ph) is very, very sick, or Danuta (ph).' And here we,\nwe could talk. But not to mention in the letter everything.\" She start to cry, and she start to\nkiss my knee. And she said, \"I don't know how to behave. I tho-- I thought that is the best\nway. But I wanted to be alive. I wanted to save my children. I wanted to be alive to hear that\nthis is dead, not, not nothing more.\"\nAnd she started to, to embrace -- kiss me, and my hand. And she said, \"Please, I beg you. I\nbeg you. I wanted to save my children. I don't want to die, and my children.\"\nI said, \u201cThat was a very bad way, very low quality way.\u201d She said, \u201cBut I didn\u2019t know\nanother way.\u201d So I said, \u201cOk, if I have so many people, three more people makes no\ndifference for me. If they will kill me, they will kill once. Not many times. Not for every Jew\nkill. Just one death.\u201d So we make arrangement; and first, two days later, I took her children,\ngirl and boy. Boy was maybe eight, eight years maybe, maybe seven. I don\u2019t remember\nexactly. Daughter was 15. So I brought them. Then she came. Then came Joe\u2019s brother and\nhis fianc\u00e9e. Also was trouble with him. He didn\u2019t want to leave the ghetto, because was very\nquiet there at that time. And he said, \u201c\u201cWhy I supposed to sit in, in the bunker and be closed?\nHere I have apartment. I have fresh air and I have food.\u201d Because he had the money to -- and\nhe bought the food. Sometimes I brought the food, and was everything all right. So I said,\n\u201cThat will be not too long.\u201d And one day I heard on the street that ghetto will be finished.\nWill be end of the ghetto. And they, you know, during the war my ears were very long. My\neyes were very wide. So I heard what people were telling, and I came home, and I said to the\nJoe what I heard on the street. And he was frightened and he said, \u201cOh, please, Fusia. Go to\nthe ghetto and tell Henick (ph) that he is supposed to come right away. He is only one of my\nbrothers, only one left brother. And you have to bring him here.\u201d I said, \u201cHow I can bring\nhim? I cannot take him under my arms or hands and bring him here if he doesn\u2019t like to\ncome.\u201d And he said, \u201cGo!\u201d And he start to cry, \u201cGo, and bring him here.\u201d I went, and I told\nHenick (ph) what I heard. He said, \u201cOh, if something will be bad, we will hear first. Not on\nthe street, but here. And the Jews, they have a good spies. They first know what will be.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cListen, Henick (ph). Ghetto will be not long. If you will not come today or tomorrow,\nyou will not come to me anymore. Because you will be not in this world. You will be\nsomeplace else in another world. You will be killed. And I will not come here anymore. If\nyou don\u2019t like to come, stay. I will not come. But you will not, you will not come to me\nanymore, because you will be already dead.\u201d And I left. Next day, in the morning, early in\nthe morning, he was dressed a little like a young Wehrsoldat, like a little, some youngsters,\nGerman youngsters dressed. Jackets, like that. And he was dressed also and early 1n the\nmorning with his fianc\u00e9e, Danuta (ph), he came. He frightened me.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION\nEnd of Tape #2\n> Defense Soldier (German).\nTape #3",
        "A: Yes. And you see, a few days later I heard that in the ghetto is Aktion. Aktion -- that means\nthey call will be Judenfreid,\u00b0 without Jews. And you know Germans you -- Jew is \u201cJude.\u201d\nBe Judenfreid. So they take all Jews to the concentration camp. And ok...is Aktion. Maybe\nweek or week and a half later, so I worked normally. I went to work, the factory. Everything\nis all nght. Took care of these people, food and everything.",
        "A: Well, I pretended that my sister and I, to make more money, that we buy food and sell food.\nWhen sister sometimes brought the bread, one or two. So to bring home, sometimes\nneighbors ask. My sister was prepared for that, because Joe taught her how to say to, to\nneighbors, to friends. And she said -- neighbors ask, she said, \"Oh, today I didn't sell\nnothing. Maybe later I will go, I will sell something. And I will make money for one bread\nfor us.\" Yes. And you see, that was the story. And maybe a week, or maybe two weeks later,\nI came -- I work at night at that time. In the morning I came home, so my people start to --\nJoe and the Zenek -- they start to ask me what I will say if two people more will come to me.\nI said, \"What you mean, what I will say? There is no more ghetto. No more Jews. How they\nwill come? From where? From the other side of the war?\" They said, \"Well, what -- how you\nwill behave? What you will say?\"\nI said nothing. What I can say? I know they cannot come. \"But if...\" I said, \"...all right, if\nthey will come they will stay with you. That's all.\" And they said, \"You know, yesterday in\nthe evening, when you left, came two people more. One couple. They were married not long\nago, and they came.\" I said, \"Ok.\" And they ca-- and they introduced me. And they came and\nthey said, \"Oh, please. Don't throw out us, please.\" And still kiss my hand. I said, \"All right,\nall right. I tell you, they will kill me, if they will kill us all, only once.\" So that was 12 people\nalready. So I said, \" 12 people, 12 troubles. Ok. Will be no more people.\" And a few days\nlater, the same story. I came home from work, the same story. \"What you will say if one man\nwill come more?\" I said, \"What you are talking about? There's no more ghetto. There's no\nmore Jews in the ghetto. No more Jews in this, 1n this city.\" \"But what you will say?\" I said,\n\"The same I will say like before. If will come, will stay. Ok! Come on in!\" In came, and\ncame this man that time, this man.\n\u00b0 Actually \u201cJudenfrei,\u201d meaning \u201cfree of Jews\u201d (German).\n\"Jew (German).",
        "A: And this man came at night -- not at night, before curfew he came. And they introduced me.\nAnd he said, \"Oh, I am sorry really. But I, I wanted to live. I don't wanted to die. So I am so\nyoung, and I don't wanted to die.\" And I said, \"Where you been all this time?\" And this\ncouple and he, they had friends, Catholic friends; and they ran from the ghetto through the\nsewer sometime. Something like that. And they went to them, to this Catholic family, and\nthey kept them three days. And they said, \"I am sorry. We cannot keep you any longer,\nbecause my family will be dead and we all will be killed.\"\nBut they knew my address, these, these Jews. They knew my address, so they said, \"Ok,\nmaybe we will go to this girl.\" But what happened, this man, special, he sent this woman to\nme, to ask me if I will take him. I tho-- I thought that again some blackmail me somehow.\nMaybe this woman knows that I have already this twelve Jews. She wanted to blackmail me,\nthat they give her a money. When she told me that one Jew sent her, and he asked me to take\nhim. So I said, \"I am sorry. I don't know who ts here he. I don't know any Jew, so...\" And I --\nand she said that I have Jews. I said, \"I am sorry. I have no Jews. And I don't like specially\nJews. If you wanted me to blackmail me, you will not get from me money. Just if you want it\nyou can go to Gestapo. Maybe they will kill me, but money I will not give you because I\nhave no money. And I have no Jews. And I will not take a Jew, because I don't know who is\nhere he. And I will not take him. If you want it, you keep him. If he is really Jew. But if you\ncame to blackmail me, I am sorry. You have to...\" And I opened the letter in the bun-- bunker\nthat time. And I opened all the rooms, and the rooms were, were -- went to the, to the attic.\nThis small room I opened, I show her. I said, \"Look at. Everything is empty. I am here only\nwith my sister. You see, nothing happened. And nothing will happen. And I will not take\nJew. And I don't like Jews, and I will not take this Jew what you said. And I am sorry. Please\nleave my home. If you wanted to blackmail me, I will not give you money, because I have\nno money.\" And she left. She left. But in the evening what she told this man; and he said,\n\"Well, I will go by myself.\" And he came in the evening. When he came, I said, \"Hey, you\nmiserable! You shouldn't come by yourself. You so comfortable like maharajah! You sent\nsomebody else, you couldn't come -- could come by yourself.\" I said, \"You miserable! I\ndidn't -- I didn't know who 1s this woman. You sent her to me.\" And I was really angry. And,\nlike otherwise, \"I'm sorry. I'm this, I'm that.\"\nSo -- and so I had 13 people. But, you see, what, what is started when was no money\nanymore for the food. This couple, they wanted me to sell jewelries what they had. I couldn't\ngo to sell, because I didn't know where. And how I can go to sell to some, some jewelry,\nsome, some shop to sell some earrings or, or rings, or something like that? So I couldn't go.\nSo they talked together, and this woman who was married who came, she said, \"We will go\ntogether. And I will go to her because I know her, and I will tell her everything. But I will\nnot tell her that Iam here. Only someplace else. And she will help.\" Really, we were went in\nthe evening there. I was waiting outside; and she went there. And this woman: \"Oh, good\nthat you are alive! Good that somebody helped you.\" And she took -- I don't know what she\ngave her, but she took it, and she prepared the next day food. And we came in the evening.\nShe brought out, and we carry home. And then when German moved to my apartment, I had\nfour German -- another story. Because in my story I title, they gave me two hour to move out\nof my apartment to a free apartment. How could I move and leave 13 people for a certain\ndeath? Whole story.",
        "A: In the attic, yes. First of all, was in the attic. Everything. But later, they saw that it is too\ndangerous to be in the open attic. So they, Joe, and this Zenek, who came first with him, they\nlooked and they said that they can divide the attic. And they can build false wall.\nSo now was trouble. They said to me, and they called me because they have to tell me\neverything. They call me, they told -- they showed me, and they said, \"That will be better,\nbecause if sometime someone can come accidentally on the attic they will find us. So on it\nwill be bunker. We will sit there. All day we can sit here in the open air, and if some it will\nbe dangerous, we will go there.\" Now how I can find the same old wall boards? How I can\nfind? They asked me the old to find, because they -- the old was old. And I was everyday,\nwhen I went out in the morning from the work, I was running around the streets and look.\nBecause sometimes after the bombs was falling and destroy the buildings, the people were\nand taking the woods for burnings. Was difficult to buy some, some coal, something like\nthat. Just wood. And I was running and looking for some boards. But who were selling was\nsometimes new, was not old. But Joe, every day when I came from the work, I found the big\ncard, paper with the letters, big letters, boards -- \"Buy a Boards.\" \"Buy a Boards.\" -- old\nboards. Sometimes we laugh, really. I said, \"Where I get?\" He said, \"I don't know where. But\nbuy. Look.\" And everyday, few days I went running every morning from the work around.\nAnd sometimes I went to the market, because over there was gathering everything. And they\n-- and one day, had man some, some things. So I asked him how much that cost, and that\nwas some instrument to, to dig the soil, soil there. And he asked me, \"Well, miss, for what\nkind? For what you needed that?\" \"To bury Germans.\" \"If you want it to bury Germans, I\nwill help you.\" I said, \"No, I want it to correct something.\" And when I returned from there\nhome, I met on the street friend of mine from work -- two men -- and they had -- they selled\nalso from the buildings the, the boards. And they took it and they sell it additional, so they\nmake money. And I, I saw, and really old.\nAnd I asked, \"Well,\" They said, \"High. High. It\u2019s morning.\" And I asked, \"Well, that is good\nboard, and good wood, too, for burning.\" I said, \"How much do you want?\" They said,\n\"Well, we set some price.\" They said, \"But for you, will, will be lower.\" And they told me a\nprice, and was not too high. Was really low. And I said, \"Ok, I will take.\" And was really\nperfect. Was old, dirty, and a little black like other. So -- and they brought me home. This --\nthis things, this board old. And then they wanted to bring me inside. I said, \"No, thank you. I\nhave to exercise my muscles, and my sister, too.\" And I paid them, and they put in front, and\nI said, \"Thank you.\" And I took really with my sister inside, and inside they helped me. And\nthey took and they start to build a new wall to cut -- to, to divide this, this attic. And they\nbuilt a new false wall, and they make a bunker up there. And that was -- and something was\nreally. Some friend came, or something like that, so they went to the bunker. And all day,\nthey were free. It was nobody. They were, they were in the room. They sit all day in the\nroom, and downstairs. But if somebody came, so they run up. And I said, \"Remember, take\neverything after you. Especially men things.\" So and I called them a ghost, my ghosts. I had\nthirteen ghosts. So when I wrote my story, I didn't know to, to, to write, to title -- Thirteen\nGhosts, or something like that. So friend of mine, she said, \"Well, I had one day thirteen\nghosts. But that was really ghosts. But that is not the real ghosts.\u201d So I said, \"Well, maybe\nFight for Thirteen.\" She said, \"That will be ok, all right.\" So title is Fight for Thirteen -- not\nThirteen Ghosts. But otherwise I called them ghosts. They, they worked without shoes,\nbarefoot, because not make the noise. And one day, one day, I had a boyfriend and he loved\nme very much, and he wanted to marry me. And I couldn't afford to have a boyfriend,\nbecause I didn't know if I will be alive today. Or maybe tomorrow I will be dead, or\nsomething. How I can have a boyfriend?\nSo to all my boys who wanted to date with me, I said, \"After war. After war.\" And this boy\nalso, he came to me too often, maybe. Maybe too often; and when he came, always I had\nsome excuses to get rid of him. And I walked with him out, but not all the, all the, time my\nexcuses worked. And he start to talk about marriage, absolutely. I said, \"Listen, after war.\nDuring the war is no, no sense.\" But he start to bother me, really. If I wouldn't have this, this\n13 -- my deadly business -- I really wouldn\u2019t hesitate, because that was a good boy and\nhandsome boy. So one day, I thought and I said -- I didn't sleep all night, and I thought what\nto do. How to scare him? Then came to me idea that friend of mine, she had a photo studio.\nAnd boy's, this boy's girlfriend, before he had some girl and she had some, some German\nboyfriends she met later. And I, and he left her because she date with Germans, this boy.\nAnd there came to me ide \"Well, if I will have also German some photo, studio some photo--\nphotograph of Germans, maybe I will scare him, too.\" And I ran to -- in the morning, to\nfriend of mine. And I told her, \"Listen, Emilka (ph), maybe you have some photograph,\nsome picture -- could be SS man or Gestapo, but very handsome. Very handsome.\" She\nlooked at me, and she said, \"Well, for what purpose you needed that? If I know you, you not\nspecially in love with them.\" I said, \"But with this one, I will be.\" And I told her story. She\nsaid, \"Well, for this purpose I make yesterday SS picture, and he is handsome.\" And she\nsaid, \"I will make him more handsome. I will take out all the ruddish (ph)....\"_-- like she call,\nall this some, some spots or something -- \"And I will make you -- him handsome.\" And I\ncame home, and Joe had the same idea. Real-- really, like, like my mind went to him, and the\nsame idea. I said, \"I already was, and I order.\"\nAnd you see, two days later I came to this friend of mine, and she had already framed this SS\nman. And he was really handsome. And you see we are standing together. And I keep this\npicture, and I said to her, \"You know, he is handsome.\" She said, \"Yes, he is handsome. If\nwill be no war, or before war, really that this boy is nice.\" And we laugh a little. And I said\nto her, \"Well, if I will hang on the wall and my boy will come, I don't know his reaction.\"\nAnd I keep this picture, and then watch, and she told -- and this, the same SS man is coming.\nIs coming, because he came maybe picture is all ready. And she said to me, \"Oh, trouble\ncame.\" And this SS man came, and he show -- saw his picture. And he looked, and he looked\nat me, and he said, \"Oh, Fraulein, Fraulein.\"* I have his picture. And the friend of mine, she\nspoke very well German. And she asked him that I asked her that he is very handsome, if I\ncan have his picture. And he said, \"Oh, Fraulein, Namsie (ph)! Namsie (ph)!\" And he raised\nme, and he lifted me up. And he said, \"Namsie (ph)!\" And he kissed me. And he, and he\nlifted me up, and he said, \"Ah, all right! Namsie (ph)!\" And this friend of mine, she said to\nme, \"Stefie, run away. Run away!\" So through the teeth, she told me, \u201cRun away. And fast.\u201d\nAnd I said to him, \"Danke sehr schon, sehr sch\u00e9n.\"\u201d And he said, \"Ah, Fraulein, Fraulein.\"\nAnd my friend looked at me: \"Run away! Run away!\" And I went out. And I brought home\nthis picture, and I hanged on the wall over my bed. Next day, this boy of mine came. And he\nlooked, and he said, \"Well, what is that?\" I said, \"What? Who 1s that, not what!\" And he said,\n\"What he is doing here?\" I said, \"Well, that is my new boyfriend.\" He said, \"What! He and\nyou!\" I said, \"Yes.\" And he said, \"I don't believe.\" I said, \"Don't. But that is true. I am dating\nwith him, and I will stay with him.\"\nAnd I was so little aggressive, and you know. And this boy looked at that picture, then at me,\nand I saw that he was like a paralyze. And he looked at that picture, and then at me, and he\nbecame like older man. And he couldn't moved. A few minutes he stood and he looked, and\nhe wanted to open mouth. He couldn't. Now, you know, my heart was broken. I wanted to\ncry, really. Because I, I loved him. But I repelled this thing, this my mind from him, that I\ncannot love. But I wanted to cry. I -- and was a moment that I wanted to tell him everything.\nI wanted to tell him, \"Listen, I have 13 Jews. I have to save them. I have to help them.\" I\nwanted to tell him. But, you know, but some things, some mind told me, \"No, don't tell him.\"\nAnd second was that I wanted to tell him, and the, the other second told me no, not to tell.\nBut inside, my heart, heart was broken and I wanted to cry, but I kept my tears. And I, I\nwanted to embrace him and tell him everything, but I couldn't. I couldn't. I thought, \"God, I\n\u201cOh, young lady, young lady.\u201d (German)\n\u201d \"Thank you very much, very much.\" (German)\nhave to help these people. If I will tell him, I don't know what his reaction will be.\" And I\ndidn't tell nothing. And he -- then he moved, and he looked at me and he said, \"You? You\nand SS? You?\" I said, \"Yes, me and SS. Me and SS man.\" And I said, \"Look how handsome\nhe is!\" And he turned, and he still look at me and he went out. And I watched at the window,\nand he walked really like old man. I tell you how much I wanted to cry. I wanted to run and\nafter him and cry. But I said, \"No, no.\" And he left. But otherwise, he was after me, behind\nme. He was at work. I saw him far away, but he was with his friend or someone, or\nsometimes alone. Sometimes on the street, I saw him. Otherwise I saw him. But he didn't\ntalk to me. I didn't talk to him. Then another boy I met on the party, my friend party. And the\nfirst time he met me and I met him, we danced all evening like some.... If you study physics,\nyou know some things just go together; and this, this like some things just come together.\nAnd like we came together, really; and we dance all night together and then he asked me...so\ncame a curfew. So I said, \"Before curfew, I have to go back home.\" And he wanted to bring\nme home. I said, \"No, I am sorry. You know I have a little sister. It's not nice for me to bring\nmen to home, something like that. No time, no nice for a little girl to see.\" OK. And we make\ndate on the Sunday. We will meet on the Sunday. But in the Sunday, I arranged with one\nman around work... factory that will bring food from village, bring him food to the store. He\nhad a little store. They will bring food--things like cabbage, potatoes, kasha, all these things.\nSo in the Sunday in the afternoon, they will bring him. So I told him, \"Leave for me some\nfew pounds these. Few kilos this.\" He said, \"Ok. Come Sunday. I will leave for you.\" So I\n.. sunday, I was running to this shop and I saw this boy was waiting for me. But I couldn't go\nto him, because I had to first to buy food. And he was so handsome, really. But I ran there to\nthe shop; and exactly came this religious people and this was, this man was alone in his shop.\nSo I help him to, to weigh these...these potatoes and the cabbage, and to bring inside and\neverything. And for that, he gave me gave me a few kilos something for nothing. So...so I\nhad maybe 50 kilo--I had a little potatoes, maybe ten kilo potatoes, and three kilos kasha and\nsome cabbage, some other things, some piece of cheese he give me without nothing. Piece of\nbutter, he gave me without nothing. He said, \"Oh, you so pretty, you have to have this little\nnourishment.\" Ok.",
        "A: Well, mostly they kept in the bunker.",
        "A: They kept. A little I kept in, in my -- in the kitchen, but mostly they kept. All bread and\nbutter. Only a little I had in my kitchen, and rest they kept there in the bunker. Also potatoes.\nI couldn't have too much. Just a little, for two girls, just a little. So they kept there.",
        "A: Well, across my apartment that was -- before that was a school. Like a college, big building.\nBut that time, we don't -- we didn't know that Russia came closer and they repelled German\nfrom this moving and they fight with Germany. And German were a little repelled. And they\nhave to have a hospital for a military people, for soldiers -- wounded soldiers. So they looked\nfor a some big building. And they found exactly this building -- college across, big building.\nAnd they took it for a hospital, and they make their hospital exactly from my, from across\nmy building. So they make up a hospital over there, and they went -- walked around\nneighbors and around street, they looked for apartment for their personnel, hospital\npersonnel. Like nurses, doctors. Some they lived there, inside; but was not so much place so\nthey look around. And they took here one room, there one room. And they came to me, two\nSS men and they looked around and they saw two girls, two rooms -- big two rooms and the\nkitchen. They said, \"You not need it so much. Two girls, they not need it so big apartment.\"\nAnd these two SS men told to me, they gave me order just two hours to move out of my\napartment and to leave for them empty apartment. They will come in two hours. If I will be\nstill here, they will kill me.\nThey have to have this apartment. That is big apartment. They have to have it, this\napartment. Two hours. So you see, I went out and I looked for apartment, and I still went to\nthis street where was before lived Jews. I was still running up and down, up and down. Was\nno available apartment that I can take it. Was nothing. Nothing. Doors, windows, kitchen --\nnothing. Nothing. Just ruined, nothing more. Past two, one and a half hours. So I came home.\nI start to cry. I said, \"How I can leave 13 people for a certain death? I can run out, but these\npeople will be dead. And I have no apartment.\" So they advised me to go for another -- some\nstreet. There look for apartment. For sure I will find something. I ran there. Was nothing\navailable, nothing. Was 20 only minutes. I came home. I said, \"Nothing.\" You see, all my 13\ncame down; and these three children, they pressed all to me. And they that was so tight to\nme, and all 13, they looked at me. My decision. Will I leave? My decision. Will I leave them\nor no? And -- [Technical problem] I have to keep my hand, but I am a little too nervous. I am\nnot here. Sorry.",
        "A: And you see, all 13, they said to me, and Joe and these older people, and they all said to me,\nand this Zenek, \"Run away! You not have to die with us. We have to. But you don't have to\ndie with us. You cannot help us anymore. Save your life and your little sister. And run away,\nbecause still you have time, 10 minutes.\" And they said -- and Zenek and Joe, they pushed\nme. They said, \"Run away! Don't die with us. You cannot help us anymore. What you could,\nyou helped us. But not now. Save your life and Helena. Go. Run away.\" And these all people\nwatched me, and the children were so pressed to me that I heard their breathing. And my\nsister watched me. And so I really, you see, I didn't know what to do. I said to them, \"Well,\nfirst of all, come on. We will pray. We will ask God.\"\nAnd you see, I had a picture when I bought when I was a little girl -- Jesus and his mother\npicture. And I bought it. And always hanged on my wall. And I said, \"Come on. We will\npray. We will ask God.\" And first I knelt, my sister and all the 13 after me, behind me. And I\nprayed, and I turned. All 13 were in deep, deep prayer. And I asked God not to let us killed.\nHelp somehow. I cannot leave this apartment. I cannot leave 13 people for a certain death. I\nwill be alive if I will go out, but 13 people, 13 lives will be bad, will be killed. That is the\nchildren also. And young people. I asked God, \"Help, somehow.\" Again I heard a voice,\nwoman voice. Was so beautiful. Was so nice. Was so quiet. She said to me, \"Don't worry.\nWill be everything all right. You will not leave your apartment. You will stay here, and they\nwill take only one room. And will be everything all nght. I am with you.\" And she talked to\nme. \"Be quiet.\" And she advised me what to do. She said, \"Send your people to the bunker.\nOpen the door. Open the windows. Clean your apartment, and sing.\" You see, I had my\nhands like that in prayer. When I heard this voice. I was like hypnotized. My hands was bent\ndown, and I was listening, listening. And then voice said, \"Will be all right.\" And\ndisappeared. And after few minutes, I listened. Was nothing more. And I got up. And I said\nto my people, \"Go to the bunker.\" Exactly like the lady told me. And I said, \"I will not move\nfrom my apartment. I will stay here. And go to the bunker, and be quiet very quiet.\" And you\nsee, and I was completely like different people. And they looked at me. They thought -- all\nmy 13 -- they thought that my mind, there's something wrong with my mind. And I said,\n\"Ok, go out -- go in the bunker. Will be everything all right. And stay quiet over there.\" And\nI opened the window and the doors, and I clean. I start to sing. I don't know how I became so\nhappy. And the all neighbors came. And they said, \"Miss Podgorska, what happened? Why\nyou not moved? Gestapo, SS will come. They will kill you. That is the war. That is the, the\nmilitary. That is the, the -- they said they have no mercy for an for an enemy. They are our\nenemy. Go out. We don't like to see you to killed. You're too nice, too young to be dead.\"\nI said, \"I have no place to go. If SS man wanted to kill me, they can kill me. I will not leave\nmy apartment. I have no place to go.\" They said, \"You can go to your friend's. You know,\nyour friend. She has two rooms. You can stay there.\" I said, \"No, I will not go from my\napartment.\" And they thought also something wrong, and came janitor's husband. And he\nsaid, \"Miss Podgorska, I will throw you out. Go out. I don't like to see you to be killed. I\nhave no place to bury you.\" And serious -- he was serious. He said, \"That is, that is enemy.\nThat is, you know, that is Gestapo and SS, that is the same. And that is wartime. Nobody has\nfor nobody mercy.\" I said, \"No, I am sorry. I will not move from my apartment.\" And he\nsaid, \"Something is wrong,\" you see, and he left. He left, and I am singing and cleaning my\napartment. And past exactly two hours, this 10 minutes, 1s coming only one SS man. And he\nwas so friendly. He was laughing to me from a few yards. And he came closer to the\nwindow. And he said, he spoke a little Polish. Very broken, but he spoke. And he said good\nthat I didn't moved from my apartment, because they will take only one room. This last room\nthey will take. And he said, \"Very well, you can stay. It is good that you were not moving.\"\nSo ok. And he looked, and he laughed. And you know, he saw letter was on the table from\nmy mother, and my mother was in Germany in the Salzburg, and he saw this letter. This\nletter and the address and the Salzburg, and he said, \"Oh, who, who you are in the\nSalzburg?\" I said, \"Whom? My mother. You took my mother to the Germany, and my\nbrother.\"\nHe said, \"Oh, your mother is in the Salzburg!\" And he looked, and he said, \"Oh, I know this\naddress. And that is my friend's, and I will go there next month. Can I give the best regards\nto, to your mother?\" I said, \"Ok.\" What I can say? And he said, \"Ok. I will go next month. I\nwill be on my vacation. I will be back two or three weeks after that.\" He said, \"And I will\ncome back, and I will tell what your mother are you're doing there. And I will bring regards\nfrom your mother. And I will see your mother.\" And he talked. He was so friendly. And he\nsaid that he has also two sisters about my age and younger, and he said sometimes he would\nlike to go. He missed family and sisters. They sometimes fight, but what is family? And he\nleft. And maybe ten minutes later, came two sisters from this hospital with luggage. And this\n-- and he came with them. And I opened the door, of course, and he took this one last room.\nAnd bunker was exactly over they\u2019s room. And every night, they had two boyfriends there.\nSoldiers, German soldiers. And they slept with them. And every night, these two boyfriends\n-- these, these soldiers -- came to them every evening with their rifles, you know, when I saw\nold rifles and soldiers. I thought, \"Oh, maybe they will kill me today.\" And they slept with\nthem. In the morning, they left. And sometimes I think they suspect, because they probably\nheard the noise over their head. And they maybe suspect that maybe something is there.\nBecause one day came, I came from work, and came these two German and also one SS\nman. And the -- these two sisters came also from the hospital. And one sister caught me, and\nshe started to talk, ask something. And the soldiers, too. And one sister went -- one woman\nwent to the, to this, this room where it was exit to the attic. But Joe, and these people -- when\nthey saw that Germans came to my home again and the sisters came from the hospital and\nthey all came -- he said, in the last moment, \"Go to the bunker.\" And he closed the door, and\nhe said, \"Be quiet, because we never know. Maybe they suspect sometime -- something.\"\nAnd when this sister and these soldiers kept me busy and I wanted -- because I saw she is\nrunning there, and to the -- to the other room, to the, to the exit to the attic. I wanted to run\nafter her, and they caught me. They, they hold me. They didn't let me go after her. And she\nwent there, and lift the ladder up and she went on the attic and she looked around. But you\nsee, before, when they built this, this wall, I put there old things, old, some junks. Old, that if\nsomebody will come, will see that I have storage there. Old some dresses, some, some, some\njunk, all old. And she looked around carefully, this side and this side. And she saw nothing.\nJust storage things -- dirty, and old. And she came out and probably she gave them a sign,\nand they let me go and they left. But I tell you, this moment I knew that -- I thought that she\nwill see them. Because I didn't told them, \"Go.\" And over, I think over eight months, every\nday, every night, I had at home four Germans and 13 Jews over their head upstairs. Do you\nknow, can you imagine my feeling? I don't think so. If you will not through, be not through\nby this things, this horrible time, you will not imagine my feeling. When I went, came from\nfactory sometimes, I walked in the morning -- after seven o'clock, after work. Otherwise I\nask God, \"Dear God, what I will see at home? Maybe all, they already killed. Maybe they are\nwaiting for me to be, to kill me. Maybe something.\" Oh, I tell you.... But one day, when I\nreturned from work afternoon, this same SS man who gave -- I took the picture, with his\nfriend he waited close to the factory, and he called me. And he call -- he knew that my name\nis Stefie, but in the German they don't pronounce it clearly. Shtefie (ph) -- they add \"s,\" and\nthey and they pronounce \"Shtefie (ph).\"\nAnd they call me, \"Shtefie! Shtefie! Shtefie (ph)!\" And I looked. \"Who called me Shtefie\n(ph)?\" Friend of mine said, \"Oh, look at your boyfriend!\" Because she saw one day. And he\ncalled me, and friend of mine said, \"Ok, go to him. I will wait farther.\" And you know, I am\ngoing in his direction, and I still ask God. Oh, probably he ran away from my wall. And\nsome, you know, my imagination were -- was running. I imagine everything. I thought,\n\"Well, maybe from the picture he saw my 13 Jews, and maybe he already killed them. And\nhe came here and now he is calling me. He will kill me. Oh, probably Helena is killed and all\n13 are killed. Now he will kill me.\" And I said, \"Oh, dear God, don't, don't let kill me.\" Oh,\noh. You see, but all my mind was working. And I came closer, and this -- he said, that is his\nfriend and he embraced me, and they talked together. And then this, this SS man whom I had\nhis picture, he said in Polish -- they argued between themselves something, I don't know\nwhat, but he -- the SS man -- he said to me so much broken Polish that I should run away\nquickly, fast. Run away, run away. And I in a minute, I said, \"All right, all right. Gute Nacht.\nGute Nacht, auf Wiedersehen.\"'\u201d And when I came to friend of mine, and she heard what\nthey are were talking. This other SS man, he told him to take me to their room for a night.\nAnd he said, this other, he said \"No, she is too young. And she 1s nice girl, and young. Why\nwe have to kill her in the morning to throw her out?\" He said, \"The war. She is our, our\nenemy.\" And he said, \"We are her enemy.\" And they argued together between themselves.\nAnd this, this other, his friend, he wanted to take me for the night. And this said, \"No.\" And\nbecause he told me run away. And I ran -- and this, and you see, he, he somehow he saved\nmy life. I said, \"God help-- helped me, protect me to save my life that I will save, save other\nlives. And you see --",
        "A: I'm sorry.\n'\u201d \u201cGood night. Good night, and see you again.\u201d (German)",
        "A: Well in the end of the war, that was another story.",
        "A: Three minutes, ok. That was fighting, fighting all night. And in the morning we didn't know\nwho won. German or Russia? So they stood all at the window, and I stood with them. Who\nwin we\u2019 ll, we\u2019ll see to first, German or Russia? Well, first of all we saw German. I said,\n\"Back to the, to the bunker! Nothing. We will wait.\" Then after few minutes comes Russian\nsoldiers. Oh, and he called to, to, to this, this soldiers, German. \"Ruck Gewehr, Ruck\nGewehr!\"\"' Like, \"Hello!\" He put up his rifle and hands up, and he took him. So I said, \"It's\nRussia now.\" So all my people, they wanted -- oh, it's not all. But a few hours later, I said,\n\"You still be in the bunker. Be out, and I will see what will be next, because after a few\nhours German can come back.\" And they went there. And I had opened the window and\neverything. And I was singing a little, because it was reason, maybe. It will be freedom. And\ntwo Russian soldiers passing, and they saw me and they come to my window. And we start\nto talk a little. I didn't know Russian, few words from before. And they asked if they can\ncome in. I said, \"Ok\" They ask if I have vodka. I said, \"Well, not too much.\" But a little I\nsaved, so I have. I put on the table vodka. So they have some little chocolate, some, some\nsomething. So they asked me questions. How was Germans? How -- what I worked, and\neverything. So I asked them, \"Where is the German? Where is the front?\" And everything.\nAnd one of them, they said, \"Well, why is so question like a spy?\" I said, \"You gave me\nquestions. Now I give you question. You know that is war. We had Russ-- German. Now I\nask you, where is the German? Maybe they will come back.\" And one of them: \"Oh, no.\nThey will not come back. We are far, far away after them. They will not come back.\" So\nwhen this all my 13, they were listening under the door. When they heard that the German\nwill not come anymore, they all opened the door and they come. And these two Russians,\nthey with their rifles, they didn't know who they are with the rifles. So I kept the rifle down. I\nsaid, \"Be quiet. Let us quiet, people.\" \"And who are there? Who are there?\" So then I told\nthem that they're Jewish people, and I kept them with this, my little sister. And I saved them,\nand they are quiet people. They are not bad people. And they all came, and they start to, to\nkiss these two, two, two soldiers. And when this they heard that they are Jews and they are\nsafe, they start to kiss. And because, they said in Russia they heard a lot what happened in\ntheir country, too. And they, they looked at me and my sister; and they said, \"Two girls!\"\nNot two girls, a girl and a half. And they embraced me, and they lifted me up. And they said,\n\u201cSwing rifle, swing rifle!\u201d (German)\n\"Hero! Hero!\" And sister, too. And they said that I am more a hero, bigger hero like the\nsoldiers on the front because soldiers are fighting with the rifles, with their friends against\nthe enemy. I didn't have nothing. So they said I am bigger hero. I fought with, with enemy\nwith nothing. Ah, that was -- and so they came out. And these soldiers were -- came back\nagain, and again and again. And otherwise they looked at me. They said, \"Oh, geroi,\ngeroi\u2019!\" -- \"Hero! Hero!\"",
        "A: Thank you. Oh, I have to come back. I have to come back to myself.",
        "A: I have to bring myself from the Poland. From Tatarska (ph) here back.\nConclusion of Interview\n'* \u201cOh, hero, hero!\u201d (Russian)\n"
