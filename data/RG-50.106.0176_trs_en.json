        "Q: And do you know how far back her generations went, or not?",
        "A: I haven\u2019t made up a family tree, it\u2019s something that I\u2019m -- I\u2019ve been talking about, in fact,\nwith a cousin\u2019s daughter in Israel. But they went back for quite some time in that area. That was\npart of this -- the [indecipherable] of settlement in --",
        "Q: And did she have brother and sisters?",
        "A: She did. My mother had -- well, it men -- her family -- originally my grandmother had 10\nchildren. Four survived. A son didn\u2019t survive childbirth.

        "A: Yes, he was, and my father -- my paternal grandparents, Admonis and Rachel had three\nchildren. My father, Yorel, his little brother, Zisa, or Zisl, and his sister, Leia. My father and my\nmother\u2019s younger brother, who also was killed in -- in -- by the Nazis, her younger brother\nRuvin, married each other\u2019s sisters. He -- he was best friends -- my father was best friends with\nRuvin and he married my mother and -- and Ruvin married Leia. Sadly, when we ran away to the\nforests later on, and my father and Ruvin had already been taken away at that point, Leia refused\nto go. She had -- they had three children, three di -- girls, and they also perished.",
        "Q: Do you know what your father did as a trade, or a --",
        "A: They -- they were in the textile business and I can\u2019t tell you how sig -- my mother would as it\nwas a significant business, I have no idea whether it was a dry goods shop, or you know, really\nsomething more significant, but they were in that business. They were fairly well-to-do 1n -- in\nthat small town.",

        "Q: Uh-huh, okay.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure they would have had more children if -- if -- you know, they were quite young at the\ntime. My mother and my father were in their early 20\u2019s. And -- and my mother incidentally came\nfrom a -- the poorer part of town, she was from the wrong side of the tracks, so my fu -- she\nmarried into -- somebody of more means than her, because my -- my mother, like I in some\nways, I lost my father when I was one and a half, she lost her father when she was five. So may -\n- my grandmother, after whom I\u2019m named, Menachem Mendel, died when she was five. So they\ngrew up and so my grandmother was left with all these children and they grew up in utter\npoverty.",

My -- my uncles and my grandmother,\nmay she rest in peace, who also survived the war, my -- my maternal grandmother, Chava, you\nknow, she was with us until \u201948, when they left for Israel. But she was quite a religious woman,\nas were my uncles, my mother\u2019s brothers. And my mother and her sister, maybe it was partly life\nin the United States, became, you know, less -- I mean, they were more secular as the years wore\non.",

        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: -- when we were liberated, because we were in the forests and the Russian army advance -- it\ncould have been \u201944, I may be -- it -- it -- it probably would have been \u201944, passed the Russian\narmy as it advanced westward --",
        "Q: Okay.",

        "A: No, they didn\u2019t stay in the town.",
        "Q: Okay, what\u2019d they do after then? That\u2019s what I want to know --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- what happened with your family? Obviously you don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: Yeah -- no, Pll -- Pll -- Pll -- Pll try to fill that in.",
        "Q: Between \u00b040 and \u00b044.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We lived in the town and in fact my mother said that we even had a German officer who was\none of the nice ones at that time, quartered in our house, because what they used to do 1s to put\nthe officers into people\u2019s homes, very often. And she said he was quite sympathetic to the Jews,\nbut was removed at some -- at some point. My father and my Uncle Ruvin, when -- when rumors\nstarted to come up that bad things -- that there was a threat -- rumors of threat were in the air,\nand my father and his -- and -- and my Uncle Ruvin actually started to moo -- to try to get into\nRussia and then maybe bring the families with them. But a lot of Jews were going east to Russia,\neven though they knew it was no picnic and they\u2019d wind up in Siberia very often. But for some\nreason they couldn\u2019t get in and they were turned back and they came back into town and then\neventually, when the Germans began to round up all able-bodied men and take them away for\nlabor, and we never heard from them again. And -- and my mother variously said -- I still don\u2019t\nknow and I still want to do some research in the newly opened ar-archives in Germany that he --\nthey were killed in Chelmno in the extermination camp, or whatever. But meanwhile we were\nleft behind in the town and when -- one day -- and I don\u2019t remember, I wish my mother were\naround now to fill in the gaps, we -- she got wind that there was going to be some action against\nthe Jews. So my mother alerted her brothers and sisters -- and sister and -- and my grandmother,\nand we left and ran away to the woods surrounding that town. And we remained -- that was the\nbeginning of our period in the forests of the Ukraine, which lasted for a bit over two years, living\n-- if you\u2019ve seen the movie \u201cDefiance\u2019\u2019, living in holes in the ground or in huts made out of\nbranches, but also moving around. People think it was a stationary, you s -- you settled down in\none place, no, you didn\u2019t settle down in one place, you moved to -- from dangerous places to\nsafer places. And you\u2019re constantly -- were on the lookout. So going through that kind of, you\nknow, typical stuff, looking for food from surrounding villages or peasants.",
        "Q: Did your mother ever tell you who was in the group? Were there other children? Were you\nthe only child?",
        "A: Well initially we -- when we left it was just our family unit. It was my mother\u2019s two brothers\nand their families, my aunt, who was a single woman. My Aunt Rachel was single, and my --",
        "Q: So you were not part of a partisan group or anything?",
        "A: Not initially.",
        "Q: Not initially.",
        "A: But eventually what happened was we were in --",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk about initially first.",
        "A: Well initially -- the first night I can tell you my mother claims th -- because she -- they ran\naway, She said she didn\u2019t even have time to take wa -- it was already tow -- it\u2019s towards fall, I\nbelieve, getting close to winter and she didn\u2019t take any clothing for me. So come nighttime, you\nknow, I was crying and you know, and she was ready to go back and she started to go back and\nshe met a peasant along the way who said, where you going? And she said, we\u2019re going back to\nNisregin, he said, the town\u2019s been burnt down.",
        "Q: Are we talking about fall of \u00b041? Is that what you --",
        "A: Probably, 1s my hunch. But I -- you know, I -- I --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I\u2019m not keen on the dates. In any case, when we -- when we ran -- so she turned back and we\nstayed in the forests, you know, and we continued in our wanderings, so we\u2019d meet up with other\ngroups, and what happened was that people find each other. So there was other stragglers, other\ncivilians, Jews, but in our peregrinations we also wound up meeting with partisan groups\neventually, sometimes hostile and sometimes friendly. Sometimes -- we didn\u2019t have Jewish\npartisan groups like you -- you had sometimes further north in Lithuania, per se, but we met up\nwith a number of different non-Jewish partisan groups. And they weren't all friendly. And -- but\nI do begin to remember -- you know, it\u2019s hard to distinguish sometimes what you\u2019ve dreamed\nand what stories you\u2019ve integrated from other people. I do begin to remember the lib -- the\nliberation, when the Russians came in and -- and -- and thereafter. I was very sick in the forest,\nand this I was told by my mother. I developed -- because I was an infant, I was what, less than\ntwo years old when the war -- and I developed diphtheria and I was close to death, I mean, I -- s -\n- you know, so my mother took me to a field hospital, miles away, where the Russians treated --\nth-the partisans and the military had a field hospital and she wanted them to treat me and -- and\nthe officer in charge says look at all the people, we have soldiers in there and I don\u2019t have time\nfor -- for you. So she took me back and -- to our encampment and through some -- I forget what\nshe told me, they -- in e -- in essence they gave me what would today be considered a vaporizer\ntreatment and it seemed to work, some remedy that they found, and I survived.",
        "Q: Are there any other -- I hate to used the word anecdotes, but stories that your mother told you\nabout that time, before you remembered.",
        "A: Y-Yeah, I mean, she would tell me about what it was like to go and search for food, for\nexample, and how dangerous that was. And some of the people, because you would -- you would\nhave to leave -- you were in the forest. The forest was both safety, but it was also deprivation.\nSafety in the sense that organized armies don\u2019t go into forests. Not out of fear, but you know, it\u2019s\n-- you -- you just don\u2019t. I mean, you don\u2019t bring in tanks and armor and what have you into\nforests. So you -- you -- so people can hide in a forest. On the other hand, you\u2019re deprived of\nfood and y-you know, we weren\u2019t hunters, you know what I mean, it\u2019s not like -- yeah, I mean\npeople ate -- you know, they ate berries or they ate mushrooms of they f -- whatever they found.\nBut they would also go out, leave the forest and go to some peasants that they knew or some\nfarmer, because the woods were still in the area and we wa -- we had not yet wandered far\nenough into it, so you were able to leave and go and get some food. But of course that\npresupposed that the -- th-the peasant you were going to was not going to sell you out and was\nnot going to inform the Germans that you were there. So it was fraught with danger and of\ncourse some of the people that they knew, other Jews, were killed on these missions. So she\nwould tell me about these things.",
        "Q: How would you describe your mother? She sounds like a very strong woman to have gone\nthrough this, and kept you alive.",
        "A: She was -- I do [indecipherable] describe her, an-and the way I have described her is she was\ngreat in a crisis, but she was not so great in dealing with normal day to day life. And I really\nmean that. And there are certain people who, when they face a crisis can galvanize and mobilize\nall their -- you know, their -- their resources, psychological, physical etcetera and move into\ngear. And there are others who are paralyzed by it. And she was able to do that.",
        "Q: Well, here she was a young woman in her 20\u2019s --",
        "A: She was a young --",
        "Q: -- with a baby.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, a young woman with a baby. And it\u2019s something that -- 1t wasn\u2019t until I was\nmuch older that I was able to appreciate what it took.",
        "Q: All right, now let\u2019s move up to your [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- and what -- what you said your first memory in [indecipherable] before --",
        "A: My first memory was actually being liberated.",
        "Q: Well, describe that, what your memory --",
        "A: Oh, there\u2019s another anecdote, you asked for anecdotal information. I actually had my first\ntaste of alcohol when I was a child in the forest, because one of the groups, the -- this again my\nmother told me, not that I remember it, one of the partisan groups we met up with -- and -- and\nthe relation with the partisan group, even if they were unfriendly, they were like protectors, you\nknow, so you wanted -- civilians wanted to be near partisans. On the other hand, you were also --\nsometimes feared them. This group was not well disposed to Jews apparently, but they took a\nliking to me because I was a cute -- according to my mother, a cute child. So they took me --\nthey would take me away. They would ad -- literally take me away from her and take me to their\ncamp, a military camp and there taught me how to drink booze. So -- but my own memory that I\ncan, you know, say this, I remember this, was actually riding out of the forest on an ox drawn\ncart heaped with whatever belongings people had. So when you see those films of refugees, you\nknow, and in that\u2019s -- you know, I remember sitting on top of that cart and being afraid I'd fall\ndown.",
        "Q: Did you have any idea, being a toddler at the time, what was happening? Was it something\ngood, was it something scary? You know, do you remember being scared or do you remember\nbeing excited?",
        "A: No, probably scared.",
        "Q: Yeah, because you were in the car --",
        "A: I -- I would say that the -- the -- at that time, you know, there were, a little bit later -- because\nthe war was still going on.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And we were, in our part of western Ukraine, because don\u2019t forget, the -- the geography is -- I\nmean, not --\n[interruption] Excuse me, does anybody want tea or anything? No?",
        "A: Anyway, when we were liberated, this was only the beginning of the westward march in a\nsense, not -- not quite the beginning, but it -- I would say the -- the war still had a long ways to\ngo. But our area was clear, but it doesn\u2019t mean the war stopped, we still experienced air -- air\nraids, for example, constantly the Germans would come over and bomb, and I remember those.",
        "Q: What were they like?",
        "A: SO We -- we were --",
        "Q: Can you describe --",
        "A: When we were liberated -- yeah, I can -- I -- I can describe it. I remember running with my\nmother into -- we think of air raid shelters as being something under a building and you know,\nroom, and you sit there and -- you know. Poor lighting maybe, but you -- you know, you\u2019re\ncomfortable inside some place. The air raid shelters very often that the Russians or Ukrainians\nhad were simply ditches dug around the perimeter of the town or sometimes in the town, but\nsometimes on the outskirts of the town, because they knew they would bomb in the town. So\nthey would dig a ditch -- ditches on the outskirts of the town and when the bomb -- when the sky\nwas lit up by these lights, the planes would come over and the search lights would go up, you\nknow, to look for the planes and stuff, you would be running, the civilians would be running to\nthe outskirts of town to these ditches and would, you know, jump in them and you'd sit there,\nyou know, hoping they wouldn\u2019t have a stray bomb hit you on the head, and seeing these planes,\nyou got, you know, all the stuff going on around you. So I do remember that.",
        "Q: You have memories.",
        "A: Yeah, I have memories of that. When we were liberated we moved to a town by the name of -\n- this I remember, is Rafalovka.",
        "Q: What langu -- by the way, what language were you speaking to your mother?",
        "A: Well, my native tongue is Yiddish.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: My -- I mean, had I grown up in normal circumstances I would have also spoken Ukrainian or\nRussian or whatever. I did speak Russian when I was a child.",
        "Q: But at that time did you understand Russian -- at the -- before --",
        "A: When I wa -- we were liberated --",
        "Q: You -- you -- you --",
        "A: -- an-and we lived -- and we moved back into town, I learned Russian.",
        "Q: Okay, but up to that point you only knew Yiddish",
        "A: Basically --",
        "Q: Up to the lib -- liberate --",
        "A: -- basically, because in -- in the house -- in the home we -- we spoke Yiddish.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. But I meant when you were in the forest and -- and of course you were -- were\ntoo young.",
        "A: Well, I probably learned some Russian too --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- but -- but it wasn\u2019t like going to school --",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t [indecipherable |",
        "A: -- I wasn\u2019t old enough to go to school, so I would -- obviously I had to communicate with the\nRussian partisans and stuff to the extent that I could. So I did speak Russian, I can -- yeah.",
        "Q: Where did your mother get clothes for you di -- while you were still a two year old, three year\nold, four year old?",
        "A: Well, whatever I had, I had, I mean I have no idea where she got additional stuff. They could\nhave sewn things, or you know, or gotten them from, you know, surrounding connections, I\ndon\u2019t know.",
        "Q: So you said now you\u2019re -- you\u2019re [indecipherable |",
        "A: Yeah, so we\u2019re in a town Rafalovka, th-that -- when we were liberated, and we had -- I\nremember this -- that we had -- we lived -- again, it was my -- my mother, my aunt, my\ngrandmother, Chava, my uncle at that point, one of my uncles, Herschel was taken away to the\ncoal mines in the Doniets basin, Donbass, which is one of the world\u2019s big coal mines -- coal mi-\nmining areas. So he was taken away with his family. My other uncle, Zelig was drafted, so after\nspending two and a half years in the forests, he\u2019s drafted int-into the Russian army. We stayed in\nRafalovka with -- and we had a cow. I remember that we had a cow for milk.",
        "Q: Where did you live in the town?",
        "A: You know, I don\u2019t remember. Probably in some bombed out building, I don\u2019t remember that.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And then we moved from Rafalovka -- we -- we stayed there for maybe a couple of months,\nthree months, I\u2019m not sure. But then we moved to Kowal, which is the town I was born in. And\nthey\u2019re all in the same area, basi -- I think Rafalovka is north of Kowal, northeast. And we\nmoved to Kowal and we moved into a -- what people did was to move -- find the housing that\nwas not totally shattered. So even if a house had been damaged by bombing raids, but it was in\nreasonably good shape, you moved in. You fixed it up and you lived .And that\u2019s what we did.\nAnd we -- again, we lived as a -- as a family unit. And -- which included my mother, her sister\nRachel, my grandmother. My Uncle Zelig had been taken away but his wife, my Aunt Sosil\nremained with us, and he had two sons, Aaron and Menachem and they stayed with us. And they\nwere like older brothers to me, they\u2019re -- they -- I was five, four or five and they were six, seven\nyears older than I, maybe eight years.",
        "Q: Do -- do you remember seeing other little children your age?",
        "A: That\u2019s interesting. I wasn\u2019t old enough to go to school. I don\u2019t really, not at that point\nremember other little children. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s interesting, I do later. But I do remember my -- my\ncousin Aaron, may he rest in peace, who was like an older brother to me, and I going to the train\nstation -- and people had to make a living you know, we -- the war was going on. So one of the\nthings that I know they did is the women started to bake bread. And they would bake bread and\ngive it to me and to Aaron and we\u2019d take it down to the train station and try to sell it.",
        "Q: Sell it.",
        "A: Sell it to soldiers, sell it to whoever was willing to buy it. I remember that. I remember long,\nmile long marches of Russian troops coming through from the east and going to the front.",
        "Q: As a little boy --",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: -- what did that mean to you? Did you want to be a soldier? Was it scary, or was it wonderful\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: The Russians at that time were my heroes. And one had a very -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s hard today\nand -- and -- and you know, knowing with hindsight. W-We -- we were liberated by the\nRussians. We knew their shortcomings and the shortcomings of the system they were trying to\nimpose. But they were also our liberators and our heroes. And yeah, I admired them. And in fact,\nI remember in Kowal, because my mother also -- at some point they started to sell vodka. How\nthey s -- made vodka, I have no idea, but somebody got -- knew how to do it and they -- and it\nwas a barter economy at the end of the war. So people with -- salt was, for example was -- was a\ncommodity that was amazingly expensive to get. And you need salt. I mean, you can\u2019t do\nwithout salt. So people would trade vodka for salt. And I remember one of the Russian soldiers\nwho came in, and I wish I could remember his name, but he was a tailor and I wanted a uniform.\nYou\u2019re talking about how I felt about the Russians and -- and he made me a uniform. The only\nthing I remember he -- I even had epaulets on me so I could look like a Russian soldier. The only\nthing I couldn\u2019t get was the red star that they wore, and that was my big disappointment. But\nthat\u2019s the way, you know, 1-it -- 1t was, life was ironic that way, I mean --",
        "Q: Do you know, going back --",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: -- some years earlier, if your parents were members of the communist party?",
        "A: No, not at all. My father was very active in Betar, so he was a -- he was a right winger. They\nused to call -- call us because I joined Betar in DP camp when I was a -- a -- six, and they used to\ncall us the Jewish fascists. But no, we -- we didn't have any -- any communists 1n -- in the\nfamily.",
        "Q: So he was a Zionist",

        "A: Ardent Zionist. And my mother was too.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: My mother was too, and ma -- in -- and the rest of the family, I\u2019d say those that were\npolitically conscious at all were more left wing Zionists. They wound up in Israel and today\nthey\u2019re more right wing than I am, so --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",

        "A: Right. Yeah. Well, my father --",
        "Q: Anything else?",
        "A: Yes, my father was very active and there is no doubt in my mind that Israel could have been a\ndestination had he survived the war, for us. I know that I wanted to go to Israel. When I wound\nup -- when my mother decided to come to the United States, for me, I had a deep sense of\ndisappointment.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. Okay, that\u2019s -- we\u2019re back in Kowal you said, and you -- you --",

I remember the first one of them demonstrated me\none evening how to fire a rifle, and of course f-for a little kid that\u2019s -- I mean, I didn\u2019t fire it, I\ncouldn\u2019t even hold it, it was -- but -- and I learned to sing Russian songs, some of which I can\nstill remember. A couple.",
        "Q: Can you sing -- can you sing a line or two?",

        "Q: Okay, okay. Did you -- do you know if there were any incidents of anti-Semitism between the\nRussians and the Jews at that time? Or did you exper -- did anybody say anything to you --",
        "A: We experienced it later, a little bit later --",
        "Q: But at this point --",
        "A: -- down the road. Not at this point, although we did know the misgivings. We had a neighbor\nthat the -- the Russians themselves, non-Jewish Russians had about the system. We had\nneighbors -- the-they were -- admired the United States greatly. We had a neighbor who was a\nprosecutor, they call them procurator in the -- in the system. But they were quietly critical of the\nsystem they had and that that was our first ec -- exposure that maybe things were -- you know, I\nwas -- little kids are not politically sophisticated. But we left Kowal I would say -- I\u2019m trying to\nsort -- I would say probably in \u00b044 - \u201945, we left Kowal. We stayed there for awhile. We moved\non to Chelm, which is connected to Kowal actually by railroad, it\u2019s -- they\u2019re both railroad\njunctions. So Kowal -- Chelm is further west. And Chelm is already Poland proper.",

        "Q: -- you don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: -- I don\u2019t really remember, but I remember living in Chelm, you know, I remember living in\nChelm in a also semi-bombed out building. I remember -- one of the childhood memories I had\nwas the -- one stairway didn\u2019t have a railing and walking up was always scary to me. I said, what\nif I fall off, you know.",
        "Q: Why did your mother move to Chelm? Why did she choose that?",
        "A: I can\u2019t really say, but the urge to move west was there, somehow, I -- unspoken, I don\u2019t know,\nI -- I never asked her. People also -- one of the things people don\u2019t understand is there was no\nhome to go -- left to go to. So you kind of -- you\u2019d go elsewhere, you know what I mean, but\ngoing deeper into Russia was not something that they would have found attractive. So you went\nwest. I mean, you -- you -- going back to our town was not an option, and with that -- that was\nthe case for many Jews, most Jews I would say.",
        "Q: Do you have a sense of your mother\u2019s frame of mind that time? Was she full of tension, or --\nshe was your mother and you were a small child. Did you have an -- a sense as a child that she\nwas tightly wound going through all these very challenging --",

        "A: -- no, no, no, I\u2019m sure she was. She -- she was -- she was -- yeah, she was a nervous woman,\nbut she was also an enterprising one. And even there when we moved to Poland -- I mean, don\u2019t\nforget, Poland was no long -- Poland was now occupied by the Russians.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: We were Polish citizens. I mean my -- that little card I showed you says place of birth,\nPoland. So I -- we were not stateless in that sense, we were Polish citizens, because western\nUkraine where I was born was Poland when I was born there. But you asked about anti-Semitism\nor do I -- in Chelm -- in Chelm we did experience anti-Semitism, and I -- and I remember it. I\nremember it as in --",

        "Q: And how did you handle that?",
        "A: Probably I me -- I don\u2019t remember, but I probably ran home crying to my mother. But we also\nremember a small pogrom that took place.",

        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And we also lived, but this one I can\u2019t place, we -- we moved from Chelm to L\u00e9dz, which is\nanother big Polish [indecipherable]",

        "A: A few months. Maybe six months.",
        "Q: A few months, oh, okay. And then to L\u00e9dz?",
        "A: Then to Lodz. One of the things that happened and I -- I should interject that I forgot to, 1s my\n-- is son -- th -- my uncles -- my uncle who had been sent to the coal mines, Herschel and with\nhis family, and my Uncle Zelig, who went to the army, we were all reunited. How Herschel got\nout of the coal mines I don\u2019t remember, but he came back with great stories. One ince -- well,\nmy Uncle Zelig I remember c -- his army unit was passing through Kowal and he said, I want to\nvisit my family. And they said okay, you have an hour or whatever, and he came back and -- to\nvisit his family. And we said, you\u2019re not going back to the army. And that same night we left and\nwe crossed over into Poland.",
        "Q: Oh my [indecipherable]",
        "A: Of course he would have been shot had he been -- you know, the Russians realized it. So he\nessentially deserted the -- the Russian army. But one of the incidents that I didn't tell you, and --\nand that is significant, when I -- many, many years later when I went to Israel, because after the\nwar the family split and two brothers went to Israel, two sisters to America. My Uncle Herschel\nwould tell me this story, that when we were in the woods, there was one night early on when it\nwas cold and I -- I was crying. And my Uncle Zelig was -- got panicky that my crying would\nattract attention from the Germans, and he -- according to Herschel, started to strangle me, and --\nuntil they were able to overcome him and stop him. He always told that story -- I mean, I loved\nboth my uncles dearly. They were very -- two different characters and he would -- so I never --\nyou know, I never knew whether he told the story to provoke him or to -- you know, but that\u2019s\nwhat it was like. So -- so, anyway, to come back, we wen -- we then --",
        "Q: To Lodz?",
        "A: -- Lodz and then we --",
        "Q: How long were you in L\u00e9dz?",
        "A: I -- you know, I don\u2019t remember. I -- I would say by the beginning of, or middle of -- trying to\nremember -- \u201945 - \u00b046. Again, we didn\u2019t spend more time than a few months, maybe half a year\nin each town.",
        "Q: In each town, yeah.",
        "A: And then we moved to -- to Germany.",
        "Q: So up til that time you don\u2019t remember really playing with other little boys your age, or\nanything like that? You didn\u2019t have a childhood, an early childhood?",
        "A: I remember -- no, I don\u2019t really. I mean, I di -- [Il tell you someth -- I remember some of the\nPolish kids, but I remember not being -- being wary of them. I remember --",
        "Q: Even at the age of five you had that knowledge.",
        "A: Oh yeah. Oh yes, oh yes.",
        "Q: These children were different than you.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Could you understand Polish?",
        "A: Polish was actually something I never learned.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I -- I spoke Russian, but I didn\u2019t speak Polish. I don\u2019t remember anyway. My mother did, my\nmother spoke Polish and Ukrainian and Russian and all that. I -- one of my early memories when\nwe were liberated was going to synagogue with my Uncle Zelig, the one who allegedly tried to\nchoke me. And was a very -- it\u2019s a wonderful memory which I stored away. I mean simply -- I\nremember it was a beautiful, sunny day and was kind of a sense in wa -- it was a Sabbath. It was\na very peaceful kind of experience.",
        "Q: Can you describe any more, or --",
        "A: No, I mean that\u2019s -- I mean --",
        "Q: Where -- where -- where was this at the time?",
        "A: Thi-This was in Poland.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: This was in Poland and it\u2019s the first experience I remember having in a synagogue, other than\nin Kowal, when we went back to Kowal, I\u2019m trying to remember if I visited th -- the synagogue\nthere with writing -- because the Germans often used the synagogues as round-up places and --\nand there\u2019d be writing on the wall from the -- but then we wound up, after Lodz we wound up in\nEast Berlin, my mother and I, and --",
        "Q: How did you get there, by train?",
        "A: We -- we crossed borders illegally.",
        "Q: How did you do that?",
        "A: On trucks, backs of trucks, or wa -- you know, people or -- ther-there was an organized -- I\ncan\u2019t say Israeli, but it was like -- there was something called the Bricha, which got a lot of Jews\nlike us out of eastern Europe, you know, to points west or points south. Sometimes people\nwound up in Italy, too. We wound up in East Berlin, my mother and I in a bombed out building\nin East Berlin, my uncles in different zones, I\u2019m trying to remember where they were. But they\nwere not in the communist -- they were not in the Russian zone. They got into the American\nzone, I think one may have been in the British zone.",
        "Q: And you and your --",
        "A: There were four zones --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- 1-1n -- in Berlin.",
        "Q: Wi -- and you are in the --",
        "A: We were in the Russian zone.",
        "Q: Russian zone.",
        "A: And of course this was in the early days and right after the war, 40 -- middle of 1945 and so\nthings were still a sense of -- I mean, it\u2019s like if you look at films, American films from that time,\nthey speak about Uncle Joe and that everything was friendly and these were our allies and blah,\nblah, blah. But of course shortly thereafter the Iron Curtain came down in \u00b046.",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about Uncle Joe Stalin?",
        "A: Yeah, oh yeah, absolutely. And so there was a different spirit that existed then. And so we\nwere in the Russian zone, but then at some point people said well, you know, things are\nbecoming a little more strained in terms of relations. Maybe we better get out of here, because\nthe restrictions will be imposed. Because before that you were able to get on a train and -- and\nthere was no wall, of course, there. The wall was built much later, the Berlin wall. But you were\nable to get on a subway and go from one point of the city to another, no problem. So the fact that\nyou -- somebody lived in the French zone, or the British zone, or the American zone, didn\u2019t\nmatter, you could come and visit them. But we got out of the Russian zone and came to the\nAmerican zone and sort of towards the end of \u201945, maybe beginning of \u201946. And we wound up in\nMunich and then in one of the first of five different DP camps, displaced persons camps.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: One of the e -- es -- asides I want to say, one of the things that always fascinated me is in the\nforest my grandmother was with us, but she was a kosher and a very observant woman, is how\nshe survived the war never eating anything un-kosher just amazed me. I have no idea how she --",

        "Q: In -- yeah.",
        "A: -- in -- in -- in the very early days. Later on I do, I mean, when we got to Germany and we got\nto the first DP camp, which was Poking, P-o-k-1-n-g. That\u2019s the one, the picture I showed you\nbefore.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: We standed -- and we lived in barracks essentially. These wer -- these were long rows and\nbarracks just like you see in stalag --",
        "Q: How did your family know to go to that particular one?",
        "A: Well, I think by that point when we got to Munich, we probably got in contact with the\nJewish community and -- and some of the relief organizations, because what was set up at that\ntime, it may have be -- been the be -- it was the very beginning of the United Nations. And so\nthey had an organization even before the United Nations, the relief works association, whatever\nthey called it, they had something called the IRO, the International Relief Organization. And so\nwe -- we would have contacted them. My mother certainly would have. She was -- I told you she\nwas enterprising. Even in Poland, I mean, she started to do a little bit of -- of you know, handling\nand -- and -- and you know, moving around in -- to make a living, scrounge up a living. So she\nwould go on trips to various places and so when we got to Germany, she would -- we would\nhave -- you know, by \u201946 we would have been in touch with the Jewish community, or the --\nsome of the relief organizations and we wound up -- how the decision was made to go to Poking,\nI mean, it probably wasn\u2019t our decision, they just sent you there.",
        "Q: Was this, for a six year old child a fearful time? Do you have memories --",
        "A: I-It was a -- a time I -- I will descri -- well, let me -- let me -- I -- y-y -- I was interviewed a\nnumber of years ago. Somewhere if I find it I'll send it to you, but -- an article in the Washington\nPost, somebody wanted to know why I was a Zionist. And the woman who was conducting the\ninterview, and I said, well, I can give you a sh -- very short answer, or I can give you the long\nanswer. She said no, I want the long answer. So I told her about -- a bit about my background,\nthis. And I tried to describe the feeling of what it meant for Israel, because I was in DP camp\nwhen Israel was established. The world was very gray, very threatening, s-still -- still threatening\nin some ways. You felt defeated in spirit. Not just personally, but also as part of a people. You\ndidn\u2019t even -- you know, I -- I know I sensed that. In other words, if you were a Jew, how could\nyou not feel defeated? But also, of course, if you\u2019re a child who has lost the parent and who has\nlost -- you know. So you feel -- you feel a s -- a sense of anguish about ya -- everything. So,\nwhen Israel was established it was just the opposite. It was sunshine, it was freedom, 1t was\nstrength. So suddenly people who are ex -- terribly weak and have been beaten by everybody are\nsuddenly on the ascent. So that early time was definitely a period of grayness and -- and no\nquestion. And just like our barracks, I mean, if you look at them, they were just these dingy, gray\non the outside barracks, in which each family got a room, essentially. My grandmother, my\nmother, my aunt and I shared one large room, and we put up a curtain across, you know, a\nblanket or something.",
        "Q: What did you do during the day?",

        "A: I\u2019m six years old, I start school and I remember that. But my grandmother -- and I told you,\nmy grandmother was -- was Orthodox, observant woman, and she was in [indecipherable] the\nschool was conducted in Hebrew, everything in Hebrew, because even though it was 1946, they\nhad to choose a language that would suit everybody, so they said Hebrew. And all the subjects\nwe\u2019re talking here [indecipherable] it wasn\u2019t taught as a language. It meant my math books were\nin Hebrew, my geography, history books, blah, blah, blah. But my grandmother said well, but\nwhat about Yiddishkeit? She understood that there\u2019s a distinction between learning secular\nsubjects in Hebrew and so she also put me in something called a chayder, and I wound up going\nto a chayder from Lubovich. I -- first they put me in with satmar, we had a very large contingent\nof satmar in the camp. But I didn\u2019t like satmar for lots of reasons including the fact that they\u2019re\nanti-Zionist and so I wound up going to Lubovich, and you know, learning Hebrew the way it\u2019s\npronounced in Israel in the morning, daytime, and learning it differently pronounced in the\nafternoon. So I was getting two different points of view of Jewish history and pers -- my\nperspective was totally schizophrenic.",

Walking to the outskirts of the camp, where there\nwere craters from bombs that unexpl -- finding unexploded bombs, or going to -- I remember\nthere was -- there were like warehouses, huge warehouses on the outskirts which had been\nbombed out, it was dangerous to even walk in there. And we\u2019d go, you know, kids are like that.\nYou know, walking around and of course when my mother would find out she\u2019d be very upset\nand very angry. Walking around, finding all sorts of stuff at th-the -- this is what wartime is, nan\n-- and aftermath of a war is like, I mean you find stuff. You find unexploded shells, you find\ngoodness knows, you know. But we were in a camp of our own, we were not in touch. The adults\nwere, some of the adults. My mother learned German.

        "A: I can\u2019t remember was -- what happened in \u201948 was also important. My two cousins, the ones I\nwas telling you about, Aaron and Menachem, my like two older brothers -- because I didn\u2019t have\nany siblings, my -- my Uncle Herschel had two daughters and my Uncle Zelig had two sons. My\n-- my older cousin Menachem just passed away this year, so [indecipherable] he was a source of\n-- he was like a brother. They want -- they wanted to get into Israel. And we all joined Zionist\nyouth movements in the camps because --",
        "Q: In the camps.",
        "A: Yeah, 1-in -- in -- in Poking. So I joined the right wing movement, I joined Betar, they joined\nleft wing movements. And they wanted to go and get into what was at that time still Palestine\nillegally, and they wound up getting turned back. But they didn\u2019t get sent to Cyprus, they wound\nup on the French Riviera, which was one of the -- we used to crack up about that. And they\nwound up in Nice, but then they said we still -- we\u2019re going back and they eventually got in and\nfought in the War of Independence. So their parents, of course, said we\u2019re not going to leave\nthem in Israel alone, we\u2019re going after them. So they left. And then my other brother als --\nmother\u2019s other brother, my other uncle, also went to Israel. So they wound up in Israel and we\nwound up, you know, coming here eventually. But it wa -- so they left from Poking. We then\nwent to another camp, the second camp, Heidenheim. And in Heidenheim --",
        "Q: Why did you change camps?",
        "A: We were not asked, we were -- they were -- they sent us there. They sometime disbanded\ncamps. I don\u2019t remember what happened with Poking exactly. It -- it may have been, but\nsometimes they said this camp is at an end, you gotta go elsewhere. Or someth -- you know, I\nreally don\u2019t recall what the reason was. We went to Heidenheim where we had -- which was a\nmuch nicer in terms of the living arrangements, cause we were in a -- I remember it being a\nhouse. Now whether we had one apartment in the house, which is probably likely, and we had a\ngarden in the back. Even in Poking in the -- in the barracks, I remember we s -- the people\nstarted to raise chickens and I had my own little garden that I planted. I ra -- my interest -- I have\nan interest in gardening, it goes back to then. My Uncle Zelig and I raised pigeons together,\nexcept I saw them as pets and he saw them as, you know, a food source. But when we moved to\nHeidenheim is when, in the school, th -- I was in the choir and they taught us songs. I still have\nthe songbook, which was written out by hand, to sing on the occasion of Israel\u2019s establishment.",
        "Q: You gotta sing one or two sentences of a song. Can you sing one or two sentences?",
        "A: Oh God, yeah, I ju -- I -- I -- I remember those songs, yeah.",
        "Q: Just one. Can you do one line, or two?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: [sings] That\u2019s it.",
        "Q: One more line. One -- one more line. One more line.",
        "A: Anyway. I mean I -- I have -- I have -- I have my report cards from those schools.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So you stayed in a second camp?",
        "A: We stayed in the second camp for I -- you know, I can\u2019t remember exactly how long. This\nwas \u00b048? I would say probably til the beginning of \u201949, maybe. And then we moved to a third\ncamp --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- called Wasseralfingen.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection\ninterview with Melvin Gal-Galun. This is tape number two, side A, and we were talking about\nyour life in the DP camp. Were there newspapers or publications?",
        "A: Yeah, there were publications, there were newspapers, and --",
        "Q: Such as?",
        "A: -- and there was radio. I mean, I\u2019d -- we listened to the radio to get the news. I was always\ninterested in -- in news, of course, especially from news about the Jewish community and\nPalestine, the nascent state of Israel. We all joined Zionist youth movements. What happened\nwas that emissaries came from Palestine, Israel. In those days a Palestinian referred to a Jew, you\nknew -- you knew the other residents of that area as Arabs, they were not called Palestinians. So\nemissaries came over to organize the kids into sports clubs, youth groups, etcetera. Some of them\nwere -- had specific ideologies. So the s -- so you had labor Zionists, you had religious Zionists,\nand you had -- you know, the -- the one I joined, which was Betar, which was considered right\nwing Zionists, or nationalists. But I was very much aware of the news in pre-state Israel, no ca --\nand -- and -- and you know, pre-state Palestine when the Haganah and the Irgun were fighting\nthe British, for example. So the Haganah at that time had a policy called Havlagah, restraint.\nIrgun was not, the Irgun believed in hitting back, which some considered to be too provocative\nand that -- you know. I actually used to cheer for -- for Irgun, you know, as the -- you know,\nother Jews, different places, but that depended on your own outlook and your own -- your own\nexperience. But I was very much aware of what was -- what was going on, as were the other\nkids, I think. Yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. I know you said you were at the next camp at the time of the establishment of the\nstate of Israel --",
        "A: Th-The [indecipherable] yeah.",
        "Q: But preceding that, had you heard of a man named Hitler? Did that name mean anything to\nyou?",
        "A: Oh of course, of course.",
        "Q: What -- what --",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: -- again as a six year old, what is a six year old\u2019s perception, seven year old\u2019s perception of\nsome --",
        "A: Well, I mean I -- I think --",
        "Q: Or did you know what had happened the pri -- I mean, did your mother tell you what had\nhappened, or wa -- what does a mother tell a six year old child about the terrible things that\nhappened?",
        "A: Well, I mean, I -- I think you certainly knew who Hitler was. I mean, that -- not -- not just\nknew, but you knew that 1 -- I had a sense of the --",
        "Q: In other words, I\u2019m trying to get a six year old\u2019s perception.",
        "A: Right, no, I -- I understand and I can -- I can relate to that more easily on the positive side. I\nknow that the Russians were my heroes because they liberated us.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The Americans were heroes, but the Americans were also sometimes seen as not being tough\nenough on the Germans, an -- oddly. So the stuff, 1f you read history now, that -- you know, th-\nthe Russians did some terrible, brutal things when they went west and we all -- we know that. I\njust got finished reading a book not long ago about the -- you know, the battle of -- of Berlin.\nAnd so they did some awful things. But don\u2019t forget, 1f you\u2019re a victim of Nazism, you want\nrevenge. So war means some terrible things are done on all sides, so you mean as a child I\ncertainly was aware of Hitler as the -- you know, the ultimate evil to beset the Jewish people, but\nI was also aware, from what my mother told me about, that he was only the latest and greatest if\nyou will, in a long line of people as -- as the Hagadah says, in every generation somebody rises\nagainst us to destroy us. So I was aware of that. I was also -- there was something else that -- that\nmaybe my -- when you don\u2019t know who your father is or was, you can grow up with -- you hear\nstories. And my mother helped in some ways to give me this mythic vision of my father. What\nkind of man he was or would have been, I have no idea. I can speculate about it because I knew\nsome -- you know. And -- and -- and -- and -- and on my father\u2019s side, I mean sadly, of the\nfamily there was almost nobody left that I could even say, well he would have been like this, or\nlike this guy, or somebody else. My father\u2019s side there were only two relatives left that I met.\nOne in the United States, the one who actually brought us over, who was his -- his -- my father\u2019s\nuncle, my great uncle and his sister in Brazil. I never even knew what my father looked like until\nmy aunt -- great aunt in Brazil sent us a photo. So yeah, I mean, you grow up with a child\u2019s\nperception of all these -- these things, but -- but I think was also fairly grounded in reality.",
        "Q: Well now we\u2019re in your second camp, [indecipherable] the state of Israel has been formed.\nWere there specific celebrations at the time when you heard?",
        "A: Oh sure.",
        "Q: What did -- what --",
        "A: I mean we had -- they had celebrations throughout, it\u2019s not like -- the ki -- the camps --",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t a specific --",
        "A: -- the camps, it -- the camps developed, and this 1s the -- the -- the -- the beauty about the\nJewish people is the ability to bounce back from utter despair and -- and grief is -- 1s amazing,\nbecause di -- don\u2019t forget -- I mean, I was in the first camp a year or half a year after the end of\nthe war.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And people started writing newspapers, and people published newspapers, people started\nschools again and people -- so there\u2019s a whole -- they started an institutional framework. My\naunt -- my Aunt R-Rachel was married in the camp, I remember that wedding, I remember going\nthere. I mean, I ca -- you know, we had meetings, we had political groups. So life swung back\ninto action. I don\u2019t remember specifically -- I do remember singing in the choir and how exciting\nit was when Israel was born. But I don\u2019t remember any other -- yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. And anything else about that second camp you want to describe?",
        "A: I remember just -- I -- I remember in the second camp we already would go into the town,\nbecause th-this camp, unlike the other one, which was kind of a circumscribed area was closer to\nthe town, you could actually walk out -- it was actually part of the town but sort of on the\noutskirts. And -- and I reme-member feeling a sense of jealousy. Yo-You know, the Germans\nwere not back yet, but somehow this was their country and --",
        "Q: Jealousy on whose part, on your --",
        "A: On my part. On my -- that -- that this was their turf, this was, you know --",
        "Q: That you really didn\u2019t belong there, is that what you\u2019re saying?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And it was a beautiful place. I mean, the outskirts I remember really liking. We\nwent -- I remember going with my mother and some of her friends, because she had some\nfriends, she had -- you know, she was socializing. She met my stepfather, whom she would later\nmarry in the United States, actually in the first camp. He was the movie projectionist, we had a\nmovie the -- set up in the barracks. Which was a whole other story, that\u2019s an experience I\nremember. But we -- we -- the second camp was -- was -- oh, we would go on trips to some -- th-\nthis was part of Bavaria, the camps were in Bavaria, which was beautiful. And parts of Bavaria\nwas like being in the Swiss Alps. So we -- I remember one place we went to called Ludwigsburg,\nnamed after German King Ludwig. And it was gorgeous, you know. So -- but I knew that wasn\u2019t\nus, you know what I mean, I knew it wasn\u2019t ours in the -- in the -- I thought I -- I -- I lost my\ntrain of thought, yeah.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s jump back, you said your mother met your stepfather.",
        "A: Yeah, in -- in -- what happened in the -- I -- I said that li-life sprang back, you know, in terms\nof institutions. We had a movie theater in camp.",
        "Q: First camp.",
        "A: In the first camp. I\u2019m sure we did in the other too, but I don\u2019t remember it. And was -- it was\nset up in a -- in large barracks again, and my stepfather Saul -- Shaul, whom she wound up\nmarrying when she got to the States was the projectionist. And he was a jack of all trades, he was\na very talented electrician and he could make things. So he made me -- he took a cigar box, I\nremember this, and sh -- he made me my own little slide projector with a cigar box so that I\ncould take bits of film that they snip off from a movie trailer or something and show it like -- pu-\npush the film through the opening and it -- he\u2019d project it on the wall. He used to have me -- let\nme sit in the back, you know, where they sit, the projectionist sits. So they made up, he lost his\nentire family in the war. He had been newlywed when the war broke out. Lost his wife, lost his\nparents, his brothers. And he came from White Russia. And --",
        "Q: His -- his full name?",
        "A: Shaul -- Saul Pikus. P-1-k-u-s, that was my mother\u2019s second name. And his father was a\nschool -- headmaster of a -- of the school and h-he -- he had nobody left.",
        "Q: Mm. Now, you are -- y-you had gone -- y-you had been 1n two camps.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And then?",
        "A: And then we wound up going to a third camp called Wasseralfingen. I don\u2019t remember much\nabout that camp except having a crush on an older girl. Oh, and the family split. My aunt, who\nhad gotten married -- I told you my Aunt Rachel married and from Heidenheim they were sent to\n-- and she had a -- a kid, my cousin Susan was born in camp also. She was -- I -- I loved Susie.\nOh, she was -- she\u2019s seven years younger than I am, so she was like -- and -- and they left to\nanother camp, we split, and we went to Wasseralfingen. And in that camp I remember there was\na girl whose name I no longer remember. But I would have been nine and she was probably 11\nor 12 or something. I remember having a giant crush on her, but other than that I don\u2019t remember\nanything. And of course continued going to school there, same kind of thing. And the -- and the\nfoundation, I speak some Hebrew now, a bit. Enough to kind of get around Israel. But the\nfoundation for it was really based on those schools, the first three years of my schooling was in\nthese camps.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: And then from there -- all these camps were -- Heidenheim and -- and Wasseralfingen were\nboth shorter term camps, like six, seven months. Poking was three years, \u201946 - \u201947 - \u00b048. And\nthen we went to a place called -- now it escapes me. There was -- there was a final destination.",
        "Q: Another -- another camp?",
        "A: Another camp before, but that was for a short period before we went to -- to -- to port, to\nBremerhaven -- Bremenhaven to come to America.",
        "Q: So that\u2019s when your mother decided to --",
        "A: My mother decided that -- you know --",
        "Q: Not to go to Israel.",
        "A: Not to go to Israel. She felt that as a widow with a child that Israel was a nice new state, but\nas such she --",
        "Q: Too hard.",
        "A: -- she would have to face greater hardship there. So we had -- my -- my father had an uncle\nhere and he signed an affidavit to sponsor us. We were able to accelerate the process and --",
        "Q: What did the new -- the United States mean to a nine year old? Were you looking forward to\ngoing?",
        "A: No, I told you, I had my heart set on going to Israel.",
        "Q: Right. But once --",
        "A: So in some ways it was disappointing. It was daunting. It was certainly daunting, I mean wa -\n- but I remember the ship, I remember coming over, I remember the ship, the u --",
        "Q: What was it?",
        "A: -- the USS General McCray. It was an army transport and we took -- we arrived -- next\nThanksgiving 1s 60 years since I arrived. We arrived on Thanksgiving day, they didn\u2019t even let\nus disembark until the following day cause it was a holiday.",
        "Q: Now this is nine --",
        "A: 1949.",
        "Q: -- nine.",
        "A: And so --",
        "Q: How -- how long a voyage was it?",
        "A: 10 days, a week? I\u2019m not sure. Not sure.",
        "Q: And you pulled into New York?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did that -- did you see the Statue of Liberty?",
        "A: We saw the Statue of Liberty, we came in -- I can\u2019t remember if it was at night with all the\nlights. I had never been in that big a city, you know, with --",
        "Q: You were coming into New York harbor?",
        "A: Right. I remember being met by our American relatives and being taken to -- guess they lived\nin Burrough Park in Brooklyn.",
        "Q: You did not know English, of course.",
        "A: I did not speak a word of English. And the first memory, I walked into the place, their place\nand they were watching -- or my cousin -- they had an adopted daughter, was watching Six Gun\nPlayhouse. I don\u2019t know if you are old enough to remember that. And then I remember they were\ntaking me, cause it was already getting chilly, shopping for a heavier jacket than I had.",
        "Q: When you arrived in New York and your mother --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- mother saw relatives, was that a -- was it a particularly emotional time for this young\nwoman to be in United States after all that she\u2019d lived through, now losing her husband, raising\nthis young child? Do you have any memories of that being an emotional scene, getting off the\nboat and seeing the relatives?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember an emotional scene.",
        "Q: But you were young to --",
        "A: Yeah, I -- I don\u2019t remember an emotional scene. They -- I mean, I\u2019m sure they were warm and\nfriendly --",
        "Q: I know. I just meant --",
        "A: -- but if it wasn\u2019t -- yeah --",
        "Q: -- 1t wasn\u2019t overwhelming for your mother --",
        "A: Right --",
        "Q: -- going through so much.",
        "A: -- and it -- it wasn\u2019t close family. It wasn\u2019t like being reunited with your brother.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: These were -- these were cousins who had left many years before.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And, you know, we went to live with this uncle who had signed the affidavit for us, so we\nessentially had a furnished room in an apartment. The building belonged to my uncle, but we had\njust one room. And my mother went to work almost immediately in the garment district, sewing\nin a -- ina shop, making children\u2019s clothing. And -- and I, after having my first hot dog, this is\nanother early memory, is being taken to Nathan\u2019s in Brooklyn to have my first hot dog, which\nprobably cost 10 cents at the time, and -- and then s-starting school here.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. What was that like for a child who doesn\u2019t speak English?",
        "A: Tough. Tough. It di -- 1t didn\u2019t take me a long time. I was fortunate that it didn\u2019t take me long\nto learn the language or the -- the fundamentals, but the first couple of months were tough, yeah.\nI remember feeling very strange and out of it and 1 --",
        "Q: Were there other refugee children?",
        "A: Some, but most of the kids were American kids. It wi -- my mother enrolled me in a Yeshiva.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: So the advantage I had was that -- and it was an Orthodox Yeshiva, my -- th-the -- the -- the\nrabbis spoke Yiddish. The other children spoke English, by and large. And it was tough. I\nremember feeling left out. You know, I have to check on -- my oldest and best friend also came\nover at the same time, we met at that Yeshiva. He was -- he\u2019s a survivor from Paris and lost both\nhis parents in Auschwitz. When I met him in Yeshiva, I remember I felt lucky that I had lost one\nparent, he lost both. So --",
        "Q: Did the teachers ask you about what happened to you during the war?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I -- I -- I think they -- no, I think they just accepted it. I mean, in some ways\nit -- we -- I also became a bit of a behavior problem to some of them, because I was -- I was\nahead of -- they -- they put me, because of the language inability -- I was much more advanced\nin my year -- now, in a Yeshiva you have studies in the religious section --",
        "Q: And in -- in the secular.",
        "A: -- which 1s like in the morning.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And the secular subjects in the afternoon. You\u2019d have lunch in between. I was doing bang up\njob in my religious studies because of my knowledge of Hebrew, blah, blah, blah. They thought I\nwas going to be a genius and I was good at my -- I mean, I got to the top class in my religious\nstudies two years ahead of time, so I had the same teacher for three years in a row. I -- I loved\nthat rabbi. In my secular subjects I was also good, but in -- only in math.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Because that\u2019s an international language, so I was actually ahead of the kids. The teacher\nwould give me the test papers to grade. I knew more than the rest of the class. But of course in\nthe other subjects, where language wa-was an issue, I had to catch up.",
        "Q: Struggled, mm.",
        "A: And it was a struggle, but it wasn\u2019t so much an intellectual struggle, cause -- cause I wasn\u2019t a\ndummy, but it was a sense of loneliness and you know, isolation and that -- that kind of stuff. So\nthat was kind of tricky. But it -- you know, kids make friends kind of easily. All right.",
        "Q: And then you stayed in that school for how long?",
        "A: Stayed in that school from -- from 1950, I guess, \u201949, cause we arrived at the end of \u201949, so I\nfigure until *54.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: They had a -- actually the first year of high school was like a middle school [indecipherable]\nyou know, was -- was there. And then went on to Yeshiva Universities High School in Brooklyn.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And oh, 1-it was in some ways fun, I have some good memories of that first Yeshiva.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: We used to cu -- Yeshiva [indecipherable] we used to call it YTC, your torture chamber. But I\nhad -- th-they used to use me because of my proficiency in Hebrew to greet visiting dignitaries\nfrom Israel and I remember there was an Israeli wrestler around at the time. I don\u2019t know if you\nremember this, Raphael Halperin was his name. He was like oh, big stuff. He\u2019d be on television.\nSo when he came to America to visit and I had to greet him, that was really --",
        "Q: He came to your school?",
        "A: At my school. And then they, one day -- and this man is no longer alive, the Minister for\nSocial Welfare in the Israeli government, Yosef Burg came, and I greeted him. So, it was kind of\nfun.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And then you -- so you -- you became an American teenager?",
        "A: Yeah, not your typical teenager, I -- I won some nice awards at the school, for my Jewish\nstudies primarily. I did pretty well, I was in -- in -- in my English studies til I was wo -- what are\nthey -- I was salutatorian. Number two, didn\u2019t make number one. The number one guy was a -- a\nclassmate of ours who used to memorize books. He was like amazing guy.",
        "Q: Were you interested in athletics?",
        "A: Yes and no. I -- the answer is -- and [Il tell you what I mean. I -- I regret that I never actually\nplayed enough.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But I was interested as a spectator, you know what I mean? You ask me any question, to this\nday, although I have senior moments, of course, about scores and baseball. I mean, I got into --\nbaseball is such a foreign game, and I really got into that. It\u2019s -- I still remember my first in --\nfrom the school -- you know, the triple A has these school crossing guards with the -- we used\nthe wear the -- took us to our first baseball game in the early 50\u2019s. A no-hitter pitched by Carl\nErskine against the Chicago Cubs, five nothing.",
        "Q: By the time you were finishing high school, did you feel then like an American, or did you\nstill feel like a refugee?",
        "A: No, I felt I -- I felt like an American. There were always little things that happened, you\nknow, I remember when -- this is -- when my English was really good, very quickly, after few\nmonths.",
        "Q: With no acc -- with no accent?",
        "A: With an acce -- well, I had th-this spi -- that\u2019s what I was going to tell you about. My English\nwas good. To this day there will always be somebody in a crowd who will say, are you American\nborn? Somebody can pick up. I couldn\u2019t pronounce the A. I couldn\u2019t distinguish between Barry\nand berry. And what I remember, we went to camp. I went to a summer camp run by a -- an\noutfit that\u2019s no longer around, the Hebrew Educational Society. They ran a camp in Bear\nMountain, New York. The kids would make fun of my inability to pronounce the A. They also\nmade fun of my name. You know, my name is Menachem Mendel. And how did I get the name\nMelvin? Well, the American relatives got together. There was a powwow, I remember this. And\nthey said, let\u2019s choose a name with an M. And they said Melvin. Well, a few months later Jerry\nLewis -- remember Martin and Lewis, when they used to be on? Jerry Lewis made fun of the\nname Melvin. And it became like the worst name that you can have. So hence I was Mel after\nthat. Did I feel -- the answer is yes, I continued to feel like a refugee even -- I mean, part of me\nbecame very American, but even in high school there would be periods when I felt that these\nother kids are more fortunate than I am because they\u2019re real Americans and I\u2019m not.",
        "Q: When did you become a citizen?",
        "A: I beca -- that\u2019s a very good question. I -- actually my citizenship was a -- what they call a\nderivative citizenship. My mother became a citizen first and then for me it was just, you know.\nSo I don\u2019t remember the exact year. Probably -- I want to say --",
        "Q: Five years after you got here?",
        "A: Maybe a little later, maybe -- maybe a year or two later.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Did that mean anything to you, to become a citizen?",
        "A: To become a citizen?",
        "Q: Yeah, that many --",
        "A: Oh sure, yeah. My mother went to night school and she took -- she took courses and -- and\nshe pa -- you know, I still remember the questions and all that. Yeah, I did -- it did mean a lot to\nme. But I also have -- people who grew up with that kind of sense and th-this unrequited love, if\nyou will, for -- you know, and regret that I never went to -- didn\u2019t go to zi -- I mean, I\u2019ve been to\nIsrael umpteen times and very close to my family there and all that. And I love America, I mean\nI -- you know, it goes without saying. I mean, I\u2019m a patriot. I mean, I really consider myself a\npatriot and I -- and I find some of the stuff I read now in the paper, the -- th -- some\ndevelopments intolerable, you know, when people kind of disparage the country, or -- you know.\nBut as -- as a kid here, ye -- it -- you -- there are certain things that leave scars and they never go\naway. It\u2019s like if I go to a doctor and get -- I -- I had, when I was a teenager, I had a -- a duodenal\nulcer. Went away. It healed completely. If I go to a -- and they take an x-ray somebody will say,\noh, there\u2019s a scar there. The same with this. If you -- I -- I had -- there 1s a sense of homelessness\none grows up with, with that kind of background, and it\u2019s hard to fill that. And that\u2019s no\nreflection on -- on America, which is -- gives a home to so many people. But if you\u2019ve had that\nkind of background and -- and you\u2019ve moved around a lot as a kid, that\u2019s hard to fill that void.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",

        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- people with your background would have.",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: Did it stay with you all these years?",
        "A: It has stayed with me all these years and I would say that it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a special sensitivity,\nokay? It\u2019s like if you grow up -- and I think a lot of these things are foundational, I\u2019m not saying\nanything profound, but it -- it\u2019s simply that if you grow up with -- with a sense of rootedness\nwhen you\u2019re young, that stays with you the rest of your life. It doesn\u2019t mean that when you\u2019re\ntraveling to a foreign country you don\u2019t experience a certain discomfort at not knowing the\nlanguage, oh -- but you -- it\u2019s different. If you have -- don\u2019t grow up with that, and if you\u2019ve\nmissed it for the first 10 years of your life, it\u2019s very hard to replace something like that, and it\nmeans you carry it with you into all sorts of situations. It may take you a little bit longer to adjust\nto a particular thing, or may -- you know. But you do carry it with you and it\u2019s not that you can\u2019t\n-- you know, we learn to articulate certain things and we become aware of them, but that doesn\u2019t\nmean that they -- there aren\u2019t certain predispositions that remain there. And I think that -- that\nhappens, and I -- and I know about it, bu -- you know, and -- and -- and also attempts I made to\novercome it. I -- I had a job for ORT, wonderful organization that did a lot for Jewish youngsters\nlike me in the camps. I remember ORT and I rem -- when I wa -- came for the interview with\nORT, the m-man interviewing me, who was David Dubinsky\u2019s son-in-law, Shelley Appleton, a\nwonderful man, and Shelley said -- asked me what I knew about ORT. I said, I don\u2019t know\nanything about your American organization, nothing whatsoever. But I said, I do remember it. I\nremember the ORT workshops from my childhood. That impressed him. So later on I had a job\nworking for the international office of ORT and I traveled the world. When I would travel to\ndifferent countries, whether it was in South America, or di -- I would feel -- re-experience that\nsense of rootlessness that I\u2019m telling you about, but in a more, I think in a more heightened sense\nof it than another person would. And I felt that sense -- so we carry our sense of home in us. And\nI think that it\u2019s -- it\u2019s hard to replace. If y -- if y -- if you didn\u2019t develop it by a certain a -- it\u2019s\nhard to replace it and it does have -- leave an impact, cause that\u2019s what I talked about, leaving a\nscar. It\u2019s there.",
        "Q: You finished high school, and then --",
        "A: I finished high school and -- in Brooklyn Talmudical Academy used to be called it\u2019s --\nYeshiva University used to have two high schools, one in Manhattan, one in Brooklyn. And then\nwent on to Brooklyn College, majored in political science, and didn\u2019t have a particularly\ndistinguished academic career, and graduated in 1961. And my mother asked me what I would\nlike for a present upon graduation, and I said I wanted a trip to Israel. And so my friend Gil, the\none I was telling you about who lost both his parents in Auschwitz, he and I -- he had just lost\nhis grandmother, he and I decided to go to Israel together. And I decided, having a bit of a flair\nfor the dramatic that I didn\u2019t want to notify my relatives in Israel that I was coming. And my\nmother said, my ga -- you can\u2019t do that. You can\u2019t -- I mean, it\u2019s a fi -- another country, it\u2019s\nthousands of miles away and what if they\u2019re not home, this and that. I said look, we both speak\nYiddish. I speak Hebrew, he speaks French, we both speak English. How can we get lost in\nIsrael? So we get to Israel and sure enough I go to my uncle\u2019s house, nobody home. And I -- but\nI had -- I won\u2019t bore you with these stories, I had the most dramatic and memorable reunion with\nmy family whom I had last seen when I was eight years old in DP camp. And it was really\nwonderful. So that -- that sort of brought things full circle.",
        "Q: You stayed there how long?",

And when I wound up\nworking in the Jewish world, in nonprofit Jewish world, I actually was responding to a blind ad\nin -- in the newspaper. And my boss, knowing of my right, and the sort of right of center Jewish\nleanings and wi -- he hi -- we were hosting, I remember, a visit by Ariel Sharon one time.

So people usually wound up\nteaching or, I don\u2019t know, working for the welfare department at that time, whatever. I just\nfinished the -- the -- reading a very good book where the guy -- I\u2019m reading this and I\u2019m saying,\ngee, he had the same experience I did.

        "A: Teaching -- I was teaching junior high school. Joyce also. Joyce was teaching in Bedford-\nStuyvesant. Both of us were very liberal, but liberal in the context of those days. We actually\nmoved into Ebbets Field apartments, which was built on the gravesite of Ebbets Field. And it\nwas an integrated development, you know, one-third Hispanic, one-third Jewish, one-third\nBlack. And we both taught in ghetto schools.",

The -- my friends used to call me\nSuperJew because Jewish affairs was always part of me, not just because of intim -- intellectual\ninterest, it was in my gut. So her uncle, who also -- her aunt and uncle were both teachers, so\nthey were in the same position. And he called up and he said, there\u2019s an ad in the \u201cNew York\nTimes\u201d Sunday Times education section, you know, the week in review. He said, it\u2019s you. So I\napplied for the ad.

So it meant doing\nessentially what -- what ha -- life comes full circle -- what I had been doing on the college\ncampuses I was now doing internationally for ORT. So that if they needed a new organization in\nSao Paolo or somewhere, my boss would say, go in there and form a new committee or\nstrengthen a committee and so on. It was working with the volunteer dimension, cause ORT has\ntwo dimensions, there\u2019s the -- the school system, the educational programs and there are the\nsupport organizations that -- volunteers that help to sustain the school system.

        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: -- at the moment. Do you think it was an advantage that you were so young at the time that\nyou really weren't aware of the danger of what your mother was going through? Was it an\nadvantage being young instead of being a lit -- a bit older and maybe knowing more of what was\nhappening?",
        "A: Mm. It\u2019s a good question. I think I suppose so, I -- I -- on -- on balance. Not everybody had\nthat advantage, I mean they had -- there\u2019s also a disadvantage of being young. I mean, y-you just\nreminded me of a very painful memory or story that I -- my Uncle Herschel -- I told you my\nmother had two brothers who went to Israel. The one with the two daughters, who always\nregretted he didn\u2019t have a son, but he did have a son. And they had a child and -- who was\nabandoned in -- in the forest. Anyway, so th-there are 1 -- you know, the same pain 1s\nexperienced somewhat differently by children and by adults. So yes, to answer your question,\nthere are advantages, but there are also disadvantages. And the -- the ability of an adult to\narticulate or to do certain things, an-and certain actions that an adult can take that a child can\u2019t,\nare -- you know. But the advantages are also burdens. And I remember feeling as a child, one of\nthe things I remember, the burden that a child feels, especially when you\u2019re a certain age, not --\nnot when you\u2019re very little, but when you\u2019re older, when you\u2019re like eight, nine or so and you\u2019re\nalready developing a little bit of a sense of yo -- of yourself is being very, very much upset about\nthis sense of impotence and weakness. An-And I felt it both as -- as a child, knowing what -- you\nknow, feeling all the resentment, feeling all the -- you know, the anger, and not being able to do\nanything about it.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: A-And that\u2019s something that -- it -- 1t\u2019s very hard to relate to unless I -- this is where I\nsometimes tal -- when I talk to my friend Gil, the one I was telling you about, he and I can both\nrelate to that, we don\u2019t have -- you know, we know what we\u2019re talking about. It\u2019s not just an\nintellectual abstraction for us, it\u2019s an experience, and it\u2019s very tough.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: So, y-you know -- and I -- and I understand survivors. I\u2019m not talking 1 -- you know, there are\nlots of reason why y-you know, I\u2019ve never spoken about it, even with my own kids. Some of\nthem are not necessarily -- s-some 1s -- is that it\u2019s very painful to talk about this stuff. So it\u2019s\neasier just to block things off and to kind of -- I think one of the great things, and I say this, that\nin what you\u2019re doing, and what the museum -- I mean, I remember when I worked in the\nAmerican Zionist Youth Foundation, when one of the first exhibits came around. This was\nactually like a precursor of the museum in a sense, that was sent to -- we were sent, because I\nwas working with colleges, with campuses, we were organizing a tour for this exhibit. And was a\npri -- 1t was -- who was involved in it? God. Eli Zborowski, I don\u2019t know if you know Eli. Eli\nZborowski 1s -- has been for many years the chairman of Yad Vashem, or American Friends of\nYad Vashem, sorry.",

        "Q: You couldn\u2019t do it because of what?",
        "A: I -- I find it too painful to deal with it.",
        "Q: Painful.",
        "A: Yeah. My friend Gil went to one of the 1 -- gone -- when we went to Israel, \u201960 w -- \u201961 - \u201962\nand then he said I\u2019m going to do research and write about the Holocaust. He\u2019s a sociologist.\nGreat. He went to the Hebrew University or wherever, I mean, he started to look through the\nstacks, couldn\u2019t do it. You know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So you know, you appreci -- but there are different people, you know, there are people who\ncan do it. My old boss Harmatz at ORT that I\u2019m telling you about, one day I put on \u201cNightline.\u201d\nRemember \u201cNightline\u201d with what -- what\u2019s his name, I forget his name already.",
        "Q: Ted Koppel.",
        "A: Ted Koppel, thank you. So you can say Howdy Doody. But Ted Koppel suddenly says, and I\nhave here Mr. Josef Harmatz. He was doing a program and I said, it\u2019s Yosul, what\u2019s he doing\nhere, on Ted Koppel? Ted Koppel did a program. After the war there were a bunch of Jews who\nwanted to go and kill ex-Nazis. Koppel did a program on it on \u201cNightline.\u201d And Harmatz was\none of those. So, you know, I\u2019m saying there were all sorts of people. But of course he\u2019s older\nthan I am so he would have been probably in his late teens by then. When you\u2019re a kid of eight\nor nine, or five or six, you f -- you\u2019re aware already of what\u2019s going on around you, and what wa\n-- what happened, and you heard the stories, but you feel a utter sense of helplessness. You feel\nyour -- you feel, really feel a sense of victimhood. I had to talk to kids here at the Jewish Day\nSchool a few years ago. My friend [indecipherable] finagles me always at -- and she said, can\nyou talk to the kids about, you know, your experience? I said sure, okay, I\u2019ll do it. I tried to get\nthe kids to understand. I said, I\u2019m not a hero. Cause the kids a -- I -- I\u2019m not a hero. I\u2019m not\nbeing falsely modest, I\u2019m really not a hero. I\u2019m a victim. There\u2019s a difference, you know.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s -- with some of the things that you\u2019ve just been saying, do you feel that you would be a\ndifferent adult today if you had not gone through what you went through?",
        "A: Oh, un -- unquestionably, yeah, no doubt.",
        "Q: In what way?",
        "A: I mean, I don\u2019t know, I mean I can tell you wha -- in one way is that I would probably be less\ncosmopolitan in a certain way. There\u2019s a certain, you know, knowledge of the world, that you\nmay not have gone about it through positive experience, but that\u2019s what happens. You\u2019ve been\naround, you\u2019ve been wandering around and so that brings a certain familiarity with things that\nother people didn\u2019t grow up with. I -- I don\u2019t know. I mean, I don\u2019t know if any -- I can ar-\narticulate it more. I think that the -- all you can do is, in a certain sense is that the suffering\nmakes you able to, if y -- there\u2019s a big if in between, is you -- you can teach others, perhaps,\nsometimes about it. But to do that you have to be able to open up and in a lot of -- a1 -- a lot of\nus can\u2019t, u-unfortunately. That\u2019s just the fact. It\u2019s hard. But I\u2019ve also learned as I got older, not to\n-- not to be too self confident in my hunches sometimes. You know, I would think that when I\nwas growing up that these kids who grew up here and had it -- you know, had stable home life,\nthey had it better and all. Well, not necessarily. In certain ways they did, in some ways they\ndidn\u2019t, I mean it\u2019s -- you know.",

But old liberals change. I mean\n[ -- I did more. I mean, I -- I sort of became more closer to a NeoCon than -- yeah.

        "Q: When you say there was a barrier, you mean a psychological barrier?",
        "A: Yeah, a psychological barrier. I really didn\u2019t like the Germans. That\u2019s to put it mildly. Joyce\nwhen I met her had a German pen-pal and it became an issue, became like a -- a -- an irritant in\nour relationship. And that pen-pal\u2019s sister came to visit, and we invited her to our apartment.\nThis -- way back when we were young. And I said, look, I can -- I can deal with individuals and\nI judge them as individuals, but if you ask me how do I feel about Germany, I still had, you\nknow. And -- and I don\u2019t say that I\u2019ve even overcome it, except it\u2019s many years thereafter, I\u2019m\naware of what Germany means and what it -- its government is like and what its relationship\nwith Israel is all about. So, you know. Have I come to terms with what the Germans did to the\nJews? Absolutely not, I will never come to terms with that. But you know, do I think that\nGermany has been at the forefront of countries that have really tried to come to grips with its\nhistory and with this issue? Yes, absolutely. I have to acknowledge that. And I d -- and I -- and I\ndon\u2019t want to give vent, sometimes, you know, we all deal with periods of paranoia and you\nknow. I think the Germans have tried in -- in all sorts of ways to come to terms -- even in their\nrelationship with Israel. I was just reading a wonderful piece about that, how they, you know,\nsome can feel a real sense of responsibility.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: SO --",
        "Q: Do you speak German?",
        "A: I don\u2019t speak German, but I can, because of my knowledge of Yiddish, I can read sometimes\nsome stuff in German and make some sense out of it. And it\u2019s a language that I probably -- well,\nI was toying with the idea of maybe learning it. But its grammar is too complex and kind of -- I\nfind grammar can be -- I -- I have a -- a -- a -- an ear for languages, and -- and I -- my\npronunciation is usually very good, but I can\u2019t stand grammar. And the German grammar is too\ncomplicated.",

        "Q: What were your reactions dur -- during the Eichmann trial? Do you have memories of that?",
        "A: A sense of pride in the people who had abducted him. I followed the trial like everybody did,\nalmost daily on television. I felt -- y-you know I feel -- listen, we felt -- I felt a sense of the\nhistorical justice, but I -- you know, did it mean that it evened the score? Absolutely not. It was -\n- I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if I have any -- any thoughts beyond that. I\u2019m a great -- I -- even at\nthat time there was controversy about did Israel conform to international law, was it the right\nthing to abduct somebody and all that. I\u2019m a great believer, unapologetic, in Jewish power,\nabsolutely. So I was very -- that was ma -- the overriding thing was it\u2019s about time that we did\nthis. I\u2019m glad Israel executed him. I\u2019m glad he is the only one that Israel ever executed 1n its\nhistory. Israel has no capital punishment. But we -- we have -- I mean, I -- we\u2019re\n[indecipherable] we have a sense of loss, which is -- is there, it can\u2019t be -- you know, even --\neven a State of Israel, let\u2019s say, cannot even out the score for the loss we experienced. That\u2019s just\nthe way it is. It\u2019s a great gain, but it doesn\u2019t -- and this is something else. The loss that we\nsuffered was not just in people, it was on history. I was talking to my cousin Menachem who just\ndied this year and my aunt, my mother\u2019s sister is still alive. So she\u2019s approaching her 90\u2019s, but\nMenachem, unfortunately was very ill and died in his 70\u2019s. My aunt, however, has dementia so I\ncan\u2019t ask her anything and I\u2019m -- and we don\u2019t have a family so I was on the phone with my\ncousin Menachem\u2019s daughter, who is now 50. And of course she wants to know her history. I\nsaid, we gotta do a family tree. But now it means filling in gaps, you know. So we lost that\nhistorical thread. That\u2019s why I do appreciate the kind of work you\u2019re doing here and what, you\nknow, what everybody does. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s fabulous.",
        "Q: Have you been to -- back to Poland or Ukraine -- the Ukraine?",
        "A: I want to go. I e -- I have -- no, the answer is no, I haven\u2019t been back. I\u2019ve toyed with that\nidea, I want to do it. In fact, I spoke to Mishelin about doing this. I did a lot of traveling but\nnever got to eastern Europe or even -- or to central Europe. I\u2019ve -- \u2019ve thought about it, I -- and -\n- and I know people who did, who -- who went back to -- to the town where I was born, to\nKowal. And today you can, you know, go on Google Earth and you -- it\u2019s amazing what you can\ndo. But I -- I have mixed feelings about that too, I really do.",
        "Q: In what sense?",
        "A: Yeah, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking for. You know, I don\u2019t know why I would want to go\nback. There are lots of places on earth which I enjoyed traveling to. I mean, I enjoyed ga -- a few\nyears ago going to Peru, or to Mexico or something. So why am I going there? What am I going\nto find there? I don\u2019t know. I am interested, I mean in -- in one respect, I do want to do\nsomething about filling in the gaps in my own family history, just so -- so my kids and my\ngrandkids will know. And it\u2019s something we all fall prey to, I have a -- a vanity book that I have\ndownstairs that it was given to me by a man who was -- when Reagan was president\n[indecipherable] very wealthy man from a s -- Iraqi Jewish banking family. I mean a billionaire.\nAnd he gave me a signed copy of his book, and he said it\u2019s a history of his family. I said why\u2019d\nyou do it? And of course he, you know, he hired somebody to write it for him. He said, because I\nwant my children and grandchildren to know where they were coming from. So I said wow, this\nguy\u2019s a billionaire, if he -- he -- but he also delayed. It happens to all of us, you know, so I feel I\ndelayed, I mean, I should have started this process and -- and -- and your call was important in\nthat, it really was.",
        "Q: Are you -- d-do you consider yourself religious?",

        "Q: Because -- I-I\u2019m -- not because of your education at let\u2019s say Yeshiva High School and so\nforth, but because of what you went through? What are your thoughts in that general --",
        "A: It\u2019s an amalgam of things. It was partly my mother\u2019s influence. My mother\u2019s influence is very\nimportant because quite frankly, it was important in my Zionist beliefs. It was important in my\nreligious -- in my grandmother\u2019s. I sh -- I should say my grandmother. And in some way -- and\nwhen I think about it sometimes I say I -- because I became ultimately, after winding -- I -- I --\nmy first half of my career or first third if you will, was in youth work, organizing people in\ncollege campuses.",
        "Q: College.",
        "A: Leon Wieseltier of the \u201cNew Republic\u201d was my campus rep, to give you an idea. I had a good\n-- the one talent I think I had was sizing people up. My mother was interested in a business\ncareer for me. My grandmother, Yiddishkeit, so I combined the two of them, became a Jewish\nfundraiser. I said, this is like. My religion, I would say was transi -- a religious sensitivity, if you\nwill, was transmitted by these two women, but also by the Yeshiva, and by some of the teachers I\nhad in Yeshiva, more importantly. The -- the -- my mother\u2019s and grandmother\u2019s may have been\ntinged a bit with superstition, which also comes from that part of [indecipherable]. I -- ve\nalways -- I\u2019ve -- one of my good buddies who is also one of my former kids, ise -- I -- in\nquotation marks. I just -- he\u2019s a very successful lawyer in New York whom we just had dinner\nwith. And he and I would always argue cause his grandfather was very important to him, his --\nhis grandfather was from Lithuania though, so they were the midnagdin. I came from there, I\nsaid Ukraine was the birthplace of Hasidism, right? There\u2019s always a little bit of -- you know,\nHasidim are emotional and the others are rational and intellectual. I got the emotional part from\nmy mother and grandmother and if you will, the rational part from some of my rabbis. I am\nreligious. Was I -- but I was also angry at God. And I had this discussion with my oldest and best\nfriend Gil, cause he\u2019Il always say -- we\u2019ll have conversa -- I -- I have used reference points from\nGenesis and from different books of the Bible, and he\u2019ll say how come you remember this stuff?\nI don\u2019t remember anything. And he says -- he always said he was a non-believer. And I said to\nhim once, because he was talking wi -- full of anger at God, I said, are you sure you don\u2019t\nbelieve? Because if you\u2019re angry at God, presupposes that you believe. So I was angry at God.\nNo doubt about it, and still am from time to time. But that doesn\u2019t preclude the fact, quite the\nopposite, it affirms it. And -- and th -- th -- I had -- one privilege I had and I -- I told you I had\ngreat experience working in -- in -- and when I was working as a college -- I was really a field\norganizer. I took around some wonderful people. I\u2019d come back all excited at the end of the day.\nSo one of the guys I took around was Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, I don\u2019t know if you know --\nfamiliar with him. And I -- this is many years, it was probably his first trip to America. And they\nsaid, take him around to Jewish Day Schools or whatever. And I came back and I told Joyce, I\nsaid, [indecipherable] this blew my mind, you know? And I only dealt with bright peop -- they\u2019re\nall bright, you know what I mean, th -- you know. So I said, but he -- he -- I still remember what\nhe said. He said, I would rather, when I\u2019m working with students, I'd rather work with somebody\nwho is angry at God than somebody who is indifferent to God. Because if he says he -- if he\u2019s\nangry, he cares, and I can turn that around. If he\u2019s indifferent it\u2019s much tougher. So in that sense,\nyeah, I mean I felt myself like a lot of other Jewish people and kids especially, felt myself\nvictimized, then abandoned and all of that. On the other hand, you know, go -- ge -- God can be\nthe source of your anger, in a sense, or the object of your anger, but can also be a sense of your\nregeneration of spirit.",

But, I mean, it -- it\u2019s not as though I went from\none extreme to another, I mean, they had something, you know, they -- they -- they -- they\ncertainly know.

I would very\nmuch like to reconne -- it\u2019s hard to maintain a -- even your all -- it\u2019s easier today with email to\nmaintain certain things, you know, but -- but still, to maintain a relationship geographically\ndistanced 1s -- is tough.

Do I think -- but I\ndon\u2019t know about appropriateness, I mean in terms of would another place be more appropriate, I\ndon\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know, but I think it\u2019s a great museum, it\u2019s a great institution.",
        "Q: I\u2019m just saying when it first went up, some people said, you know, it didn\u2019t happen here, it\nhappened --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- far away. Why do we have the museum here?",
        "Q: Well, I mean, I can speculate, or let\u2019s say -- I mean, I\u2019m sure I -- I don\u2019t remember reading\nthe -- the arguments, but America is the locus and we\u2019ve got three -- well two actually, two and a\nhalf if you will, great Jewish communities, each of which numbers about six million nowadays,\nironically, Israel and the United States, although we\u2019re always at 5.8 or whatever, we\u2019re all --\nwe ve been at that number for -- since I arrived in this country. So I suppose in that sense it -- it -\n- there is some sense, since we have large survivor communities, that this 1s a Jewish -- this, if\nyou will, it\u2019s a -- you know, you have Jerusalem and you had Babylon -- th-the -- the Babylon\nJewish community. So we\u2019re in the place of bab -- we\u2019re -- we\u2019re two great Jewish communi --\nRussia -- Russia still has a large Jewish community but it\u2019s much smaller, it\u2019s about two -- two\npoint five million, maybe. These are two great Jewish communities, so it\u2019s thoroughly fitting that\nthere should be a serious Holocaust institution in the United States, thoroughly appropriate. Is it -\n- it -- and -- and in Israel. Can I see it in another city in America? Yeah, could be in New York.\nNew York has the Museum of the Jewish Herit -- which is nice in its own way, it\u2019s a different\nkind of institution.

        "A: God, you -- I -- I get very cynical some days because I spend too much time reading articles\non the internet, but has the world learned? It has, but it\u2019s also unlearned. The answer is yes to\nboth. It has unlearned and has learned. And that\u2019s the sad part and it means that great challenges\nstill confront us. They\u2019re -- all one has to do is look at the daily news. Lo-Look at -- I mean, it\u2019s\nnot just us. And y -- holocausts have been visited in Rwanda and in Darfur and in -- you know.\nMaybe smaller scale, but big enough. So yeah, th-th-the lessons haven\u2019t been fully learned, no\nquestion about it. I mean, how can you countenance what a guy like Ahmadinejad says? And\nthen he gets feted at the U.N. and then he gets invited to Columbia? I mean, come on, you know?\nBut people don\u2019t realize this 1s a crazy world. Hitler was on the -- on -- on a list to be -- people\nrecommended he get the peace prize back when, you know. So what makes us think that we are\ndifferent, that we, you know, we\u2019ve outsmarted everybody. I mean I -- I don\u2019t want to get totally\ncynical. Yes, we do learn, but we also unlearn lessons and we forget. And a new -- and this is th\n-- it\u2019s the same thing, I was just talking to somebody sitting next to me -- oh, that Bat Mitzvah\nwe went to in New York. Wonderful guy. He said yeah, he was [indecipherable] talking about\nthe exodus story and th-the -- a new pharaoh arose in Egypt who didn't know Joseph. It\u2019s a new\nballgame.

And -- and my mother incidentally came\nfrom a -- the poorer part of town, she was from the wrong side of the tracks, so my fu -- she\nmarried into -- somebody of more means than her, because my -- my mother, like I in some\nways, I lost my father when I was one and a half, she lost her father when she was five. So may -\n- my grandmother, after whom I\u2019m named, Menachem Mendel, died when she was five. So they\ngrew up and so my grandmother was left with all these children and they grew up in utter\npoverty.",
        "A: They were traditional. They weren't the -- I mean --",
        "A: They were observant, yeah, they observed holidays. My -- my uncles and my grandmother,\nmay she rest in peace, who also survived the war, my -- my maternal grandmother, Chava, you\nknow, she was with us until \u201948, when they left for Israel. But she was quite a religious woman,\nas were my uncles, my mother\u2019s brothers. And my mother and her sister, maybe it was partly life\nin the United States, became, you know, less -- I mean, they were more secular as the years wore\non.",
        "A: Right.",

        "A: Right.",
        "A: We lived in the town and in fact my mother said that we even had a German officer who was\none of the nice ones at that time, quartered in our house, because what they used to do 1s to put\nthe officers into people\u2019s homes, very often. And she said he was quite sympathetic to the Jews,\nbut was removed at some -- at some point. My father and my Uncle Ruvin, when -- when rumors\nstarted to come up that bad things -- that there was a threat -- rumors of threat were in the air,\nand my father and his -- and -- and my Uncle Ruvin actually started to moo -- to try to get into\nRussia and then maybe bring the families with them. But a lot of Jews were going east to Russia,\neven though they knew it was no picnic and they\u2019d wind up in Siberia very often. But for some\nreason they couldn\u2019t get in and they were turned back and they came back into town and then\neventually, when the Germans began to round up all able-bodied men and take them away for\nlabor, and we never heard from them again. And -- and my mother variously said -- I still don\u2019t\nknow and I still want to do some research in the newly opened ar-archives in Germany that he --\nthey were killed in Chelmno in the extermination camp, or whatever. But meanwhile we were\nleft behind in the town and when -- one day -- and I don\u2019t remember, I wish my mother were\naround now to fill in the gaps, we -- she got wind that there was going to be some action against\nthe Jews. So my mother alerted her brothers and sisters -- and sister and -- and my grandmother,\nand we left and ran away to the woods surrounding that town. And we remained -- that was the\nbeginning of our period in the forests of the Ukraine, which lasted for a bit over two years, living\n-- if you\u2019ve seen the movie \u201cDefiance\u2019\u2019, living in holes in the ground or in huts made out of\nbranches, but also moving around. People think it was a stationary, you s -- you settled down in\none place, no, you didn\u2019t settle down in one place, you moved to -- from dangerous places to\nsafer places. And you\u2019re constantly -- were on the lookout. So going through that kind of, you\nknow, typical stuff, looking for food from surrounding villages or peasants.",
        "A: Well initially we -- when we left it was just our family unit. It was my mother\u2019s two brothers\nand their families, my aunt, who was a single woman. My Aunt Rachel was single, and my --",

So come nighttime, you\nknow, I was crying and you know, and she was ready to go back and she started to go back and\nshe met a peasant along the way who said, where you going? And she said, we\u2019re going back to\nNisregin, he said, the town\u2019s been burnt down.",
        "A: Probably, 1s my hunch. But I -- you know, I -- I --",
        "A: I\u2019m not keen on the dates. In any case, when we -- when we ran -- so she turned back and we\nstayed in the forests, you know, and we continued in our wanderings, so we\u2019d meet up with other\ngroups, and what happened was that people find each other. So there was other stragglers, other\ncivilians, Jews, but in our peregrinations we also wound up meeting with partisan groups\neventually, sometimes hostile and sometimes friendly. Sometimes -- we didn\u2019t have Jewish\npartisan groups like you -- you had sometimes further north in Lithuania, per se, but we met up\nwith a number of different non-Jewish partisan groups. And they weren't all friendly. And -- but\nI do begin to remember -- you know, it\u2019s hard to distinguish sometimes what you\u2019ve dreamed\nand what stories you\u2019ve integrated from other people. I do begin to remember the lib -- the\nliberation, when the Russians came in and -- and -- and thereafter. I was very sick in the forest,\nand this I was told by my mother. I developed -- because I was an infant, I was what, less than\ntwo years old when the war -- and I developed diphtheria and I was close to death, I mean, I -- s -\n- you know, so my mother took me to a field hospital, miles away, where the Russians treated --\nth-the partisans and the military had a field hospital and she wanted them to treat me and -- and\nthe officer in charge says look at all the people, we have soldiers in there and I don\u2019t have time\nfor -- for you. So she took me back and -- to our encampment and through some -- I forget what\nshe told me, they -- in e -- in essence they gave me what would today be considered a vaporizer\ntreatment and it seemed to work, some remedy that they found, and I survived.",
        "A: Y-Yeah, I mean, she would tell me about what it was like to go and search for food, for\nexample, and how dangerous that was. And some of the people, because you would -- you would\nhave to leave -- you were in the forest. The forest was both safety, but it was also deprivation.\nSafety in the sense that organized armies don\u2019t go into forests. Not out of fear, but you know, it\u2019s\n-- you -- you just don\u2019t. I mean, you don\u2019t bring in tanks and armor and what have you into\nforests. So you -- you -- so people can hide in a forest. On the other hand, you\u2019re deprived of\nfood and y-you know, we weren\u2019t hunters, you know what I mean, it\u2019s not like -- yeah, I mean\npeople ate -- you know, they ate berries or they ate mushrooms of they f -- whatever they found.\nBut they would also go out, leave the forest and go to some peasants that they knew or some\nfarmer, because the woods were still in the area and we wa -- we had not yet wandered far\nenough into it, so you were able to leave and go and get some food. But of course that\npresupposed that the -- th-the peasant you were going to was not going to sell you out and was\nnot going to inform the Germans that you were there. So it was fraught with danger and of\ncourse some of the people that they knew, other Jews, were killed on these missions. So she\nwould tell me about these things.",
        "A: She was -- I do [indecipherable] describe her, an-and the way I have described her is she was\ngreat in a crisis, but she was not so great in dealing with normal day to day life. And I really\nmean that. And there are certain people who, when they face a crisis can galvanize and mobilize\nall their -- you know, their -- their resources, psychological, physical etcetera and move into\ngear. And there are others who are paralyzed by it. And she was able to do that.",
        "A: She was a young --",
        "A: That\u2019s right, a young woman with a baby. And it\u2019s something that -- 1t wasn\u2019t until I was\nmuch older that I was able to appreciate what it took.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: My first memory was actually being liberated.",
        "A: Oh, there\u2019s another anecdote, you asked for anecdotal information. I actually had my first\ntaste of alcohol when I was a child in the forest, because one of the groups, the -- this again my\nmother told me, not that I remember it, one of the partisan groups we met up with -- and -- and\nthe relation with the partisan group, even if they were unfriendly, they were like protectors, you\nknow, so you wanted -- civilians wanted to be near partisans. On the other hand, you were also --\nsometimes feared them. This group was not well disposed to Jews apparently, but they took a\nliking to me because I was a cute -- according to my mother, a cute child. So they took me --\nthey would take me away. They would ad -- literally take me away from her and take me to their\ncamp, a military camp and there taught me how to drink booze. So -- but my own memory that I\ncan, you know, say this, I remember this, was actually riding out of the forest on an ox drawn\ncart heaped with whatever belongings people had. So when you see those films of refugees, you\nknow, and in that\u2019s -- you know, I remember sitting on top of that cart and being afraid I'd fall\ndown.",
        "A: No, probably scared.",
        "A: I -- I would say that the -- the -- at that time, you know, there were, a little bit later -- because\nthe war was still going on.",
        "A: And we were, in our part of western Ukraine, because don\u2019t forget, the -- the geography is -- I\nmean, not --\n[interruption] Excuse me, does anybody want tea or anything? No?",
        "A: Anyway, when we were liberated, this was only the beginning of the westward march in a\nsense, not -- not quite the beginning, but it -- I would say the -- the war still had a long ways to\ngo. But our area was clear, but it doesn\u2019t mean the war stopped, we still experienced air -- air\nraids, for example, constantly the Germans would come over and bomb, and I remember those.",
        "A: SO We -- we were --",
        "A: When we were liberated -- yeah, I can -- I -- I can describe it. I remember running with my\nmother into -- we think of air raid shelters as being something under a building and you know,\nroom, and you sit there and -- you know. Poor lighting maybe, but you -- you know, you\u2019re\ncomfortable inside some place. The air raid shelters very often that the Russians or Ukrainians\nhad were simply ditches dug around the perimeter of the town or sometimes in the town, but\nsometimes on the outskirts of the town, because they knew they would bomb in the town. So\nthey would dig a ditch -- ditches on the outskirts of the town and when the bomb -- when the sky\nwas lit up by these lights, the planes would come over and the search lights would go up, you\nknow, to look for the planes and stuff, you would be running, the civilians would be running to\nthe outskirts of town to these ditches and would, you know, jump in them and you'd sit there,\nyou know, hoping they wouldn\u2019t have a stray bomb hit you on the head, and seeing these planes,\nyou got, you know, all the stuff going on around you. So I do remember that.",
        "A: Yeah, I have memories of that. When we were liberated we moved to a town by the name of -\n- this I remember, is Rafalovka.",
        "A: Well, my native tongue is Yiddish.",
        "A: My -- I mean, had I grown up in normal circumstances I would have also spoken Ukrainian or\nRussian or whatever. I did speak Russian when I was a child.",
        "A: When I wa -- we were liberated --",
        "A: -- an-and we lived -- and we moved back into town, I learned Russian.",
        "A: Basically --",
        "A: -- basically, because in -- in the house -- in the home we -- we spoke Yiddish.",
        "A: Well, I probably learned some Russian too --",
        "A: -- but -- but it wasn\u2019t like going to school --",
        "A: -- I wasn\u2019t old enough to go to school, so I would -- obviously I had to communicate with the\nRussian partisans and stuff to the extent that I could. So I did speak Russian, I can -- yeah.",
        "A: Well, whatever I had, I had, I mean I have no idea where she got additional stuff. They could\nhave sewn things, or you know, or gotten them from, you know, surrounding connections, I\ndon\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yeah, so we\u2019re in a town Rafalovka, th-that -- when we were liberated, and we had -- I\nremember this -- that we had -- we lived -- again, it was my -- my mother, my aunt, my\ngrandmother, Chava, my uncle at that point, one of my uncles, Herschel was taken away to the\ncoal mines in the Doniets basin, Donbass, which is one of the world\u2019s big coal mines -- coal mi-\nmining areas. So he was taken away with his family. My other uncle, Zelig was drafted, so after\nspending two and a half years in the forests, he\u2019s drafted int-into the Russian army. We stayed in\nRafalovka with -- and we had a cow. I remember that we had a cow for milk.",
        "A: You know, I don\u2019t remember. Probably in some bombed out building, I don\u2019t remember that.",
        "A: And then we moved from Rafalovka -- we -- we stayed there for maybe a couple of months,\nthree months, I\u2019m not sure. But then we moved to Kowal, which is the town I was born in. And\nthey\u2019re all in the same area, basi -- I think Rafalovka is north of Kowal, northeast. And we\nmoved to Kowal and we moved into a -- what people did was to move -- find the housing that\nwas not totally shattered. So even if a house had been damaged by bombing raids, but it was in\nreasonably good shape, you moved in. You fixed it up and you lived .And that\u2019s what we did.\nAnd we -- again, we lived as a -- as a family unit. And -- which included my mother, her sister\nRachel, my grandmother. My Uncle Zelig had been taken away but his wife, my Aunt Sosil\nremained with us, and he had two sons, Aaron and Menachem and they stayed with us. And they\nwere like older brothers to me, they\u2019re -- they -- I was five, four or five and they were six, seven\nyears older than I, maybe eight years.",
        "A: That\u2019s interesting. I wasn\u2019t old enough to go to school. I don\u2019t really, not at that point\nremember other little children. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s interesting, I do later. But I do remember my -- my\ncousin Aaron, may he rest in peace, who was like an older brother to me, and I going to the train\nstation -- and people had to make a living you know, we -- the war was going on. So one of the\nthings that I know they did is the women started to bake bread. And they would bake bread and\ngive it to me and to Aaron and we\u2019d take it down to the train station and try to sell it.",
        "A: Sell it to soldiers, sell it to whoever was willing to buy it. I remember that. I remember long,\nmile long marches of Russian troops coming through from the east and going to the front.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: The Russians at that time were my heroes. And one had a very -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s hard today\nand -- and -- and you know, knowing with hindsight. W-We -- we were liberated by the\nRussians. We knew their shortcomings and the shortcomings of the system they were trying to\nimpose. But they were also our liberators and our heroes. And yeah, I admired them. And in fact,\nI remember in Kowal, because my mother also -- at some point they started to sell vodka. How\nthey s -- made vodka, I have no idea, but somebody got -- knew how to do it and they -- and it\nwas a barter economy at the end of the war. So people with -- salt was, for example was -- was a\ncommodity that was amazingly expensive to get. And you need salt. I mean, you can\u2019t do\nwithout salt. So people would trade vodka for salt. And I remember one of the Russian soldiers\nwho came in, and I wish I could remember his name, but he was a tailor and I wanted a uniform.\nYou\u2019re talking about how I felt about the Russians and -- and he made me a uniform. The only\nthing I remember he -- I even had epaulets on me so I could look like a Russian soldier. The only\nthing I couldn\u2019t get was the red star that they wore, and that was my big disappointment. But\nthat\u2019s the way, you know, 1-it -- 1t was, life was ironic that way, I mean --",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: No, not at all. My father was very active in Betar, so he was a -- he was a right winger. They\nused to call -- call us because I joined Betar in DP camp when I was a -- a -- six, and they used to\ncall us the Jewish fascists. But no, we -- we didn't have any -- any communists 1n -- in the\nfamily.",
        "A: He was a Zionist, oh yeah, absolute. Ardent, ardent Zionist.",
        "A: Ardent Zionist. And my mother was too.",
        "A: My mother was too, and ma -- in -- and the rest of the family, I\u2019d say those that were\npolitically conscious at all were more left wing Zionists. They wound up in Israel and today\nthey\u2019re more right wing than I am, so --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: Right. Yeah. Well, my father --",
        "A: Yes, my father was very active and there is no doubt in my mind that Israel could have been a\ndestination had he survived the war, for us. I know that I wanted to go to Israel.

        "A: -- down the road. Not at this point, although we did know the misgivings. We had a neighbor\nthat the -- the Russians themselves, non-Jewish Russians had about the system. We had\nneighbors -- the-they were -- admired the United States greatly. We had a neighbor who was a\nprosecutor, they call them procurator in the -- in the system. But they were quietly critical of the\nsystem they had and that that was our first ec -- exposure that maybe things were -- you know, I\nwas -- little kids are not politically sophisticated. But we left Kowal I would say -- I\u2019m trying to\nsort -- I would say probably in \u00b044 - \u201945, we left Kowal. We stayed there for awhile. We moved\non to Chelm, which is connected to Kowal actually by railroad, it\u2019s -- they\u2019re both railroad\njunctions. So Kowal -- Chelm is further west. And Chelm is already Poland proper.",

        "A: I can\u2019t really say, but the urge to move west was there, somehow, I -- unspoken, I don\u2019t know,\nI -- I never asked her. People also -- one of the things people don\u2019t understand is there was no\nhome to go -- left to go to. So you kind of -- you\u2019d go elsewhere, you know what I mean, but\ngoing deeper into Russia was not something that they would have found attractive. So you went\nwest. I mean, you -- you -- going back to our town was not an option, and with that -- that was\nthe case for many Jews, most Jews I would say.",

        "A: -- but she was --",
        "A: -- no, no, no, I\u2019m sure she was. She -- she was -- she was -- yeah, she was a nervous woman,\nbut she was also an enterprising one. And even there when we moved to Poland -- I mean, don\u2019t\nforget, Poland was no long -- Poland was now occupied by the Russians.",
        "A: We were Polish citizens. I mean my -- that little card I showed you says place of birth,\nPoland. So I -- we were not stateless in that sense, we were Polish citizens, because western\nUkraine where I was born was Poland when I was born there.

How Herschel got\nout of the coal mines I don\u2019t remember, but he came back with great stories. One ince -- well,\nmy Uncle Zelig I remember c -- his army unit was passing through Kowal and he said, I want to\nvisit my family. And they said okay, you have an hour or whatever, and he came back and -- to\nvisit his family. And we said, you\u2019re not going back to the army.

My Uncle Herschel\nwould tell me this story, that when we were in the woods, there was one night early on when it\nwas cold and I -- I was crying. And my Uncle Zelig was -- got panicky that my crying would\nattract attention from the Germans, and he -- according to Herschel, started to strangle me, and --\nuntil they were able to overcome him and stop him.

        "A: This was in Poland and it\u2019s the first experience I remember having in a synagogue, other than\nin Kowal, when we went back to Kowal, I\u2019m trying to remember if I visited th -- the synagogue\nthere with writing -- because the Germans often used the synagogues as round-up places and --\nand there\u2019d be writing on the wall from the -- but then we wound up, after Lodz we wound up in\nEast Berlin, my mother and I, and --",
        "A: We -- we crossed borders illegally.",
        "A: On trucks, backs of trucks, or wa -- you know, people or -- ther-there was an organized -- I\ncan\u2019t say Israeli, but it was like -- there was something called the Bricha, which got a lot of Jews\nlike us out of eastern Europe, you know, to points west or points south. Sometimes people\nwound up in Italy, too. We wound up in East Berlin, my mother and I in a bombed out building\nin East Berlin, my uncles in different zones, I\u2019m trying to remember where they were. But they\nwere not in the communist -- they were not in the Russian zone. They got into the American\nzone, I think one may have been in the British zone.",
        "A: There were four zones --",
        "A: -- 1-1n -- in Berlin.",
        "A: We were in the Russian zone.",
        "A: And of course this was in the early days and right after the war, 40 -- middle of 1945 and so\nthings were still a sense of -- I mean, it\u2019s like if you look at films, American films from that time,\nthey speak about Uncle Joe and that everything was friendly and these were our allies and blah,\nblah, blah. But of course shortly thereafter the Iron Curtain came down in \u00b046.",
        "A: Yeah, oh yeah, absolutely. And so there was a different spirit that existed then. And so we\nwere in the Russian zone, but then at some point people said well, you know, things are\nbecoming a little more strained in terms of relations. Maybe we better get out of here, because\nthe restrictions will be imposed. Because before that you were able to get on a train and -- and\nthere was no wall, of course, there. The wall was built much later, the Berlin wall. But you were\nable to get on a subway and go from one point of the city to another, no problem. So the fact that\nyou -- somebody lived in the French zone, or the British zone, or the American zone, didn\u2019t\nmatter, you could come and visit them. But we got out of the Russian zone and came to the\nAmerican zone and sort of towards the end of \u201945, maybe beginning of \u201946. And we wound up in\nMunich and then in one of the first of five different DP camps, displaced persons camps.",
        "A: One of the e -- es -- asides I want to say, one of the things that always fascinated me is in the\nforest my grandmother was with us, but she was a kosher and a very observant woman, is how\nshe survived the war never eating anything un-kosher just amazed me. I have no idea how she --",
        "A: Yeah, probably.",
        "A: Yeah, later, yeah. She -- she was --",
        "A: Yeah, I mean we --",
        "A: But I don\u2019t remember, you know, how we observed them --",
        "A: -- in -- in -- in the very early days. Later on I do, I mean, when we got to Germany and we got\nto the first DP camp, which was Poking, P-o-k-1-n-g. That\u2019s the one, the picture I showed you\nbefore.",
        "A: We standed -- and we lived in barracks essentially. These wer -- these were long rows and\nbarracks just like you see in stalag --",
        "A: Well, I think by that point when we got to Munich, we probably got in contact with the\nJewish community and -- and some of the relief organizations, because what was set up at that\ntime, it may have be -- been the be -- it was the very beginning of the United Nations. And so\nthey had an organization even before the United Nations, the relief works association, whatever\nthey called it, they had something called the IRO, the International Relief Organization. And so\nwe -- we would have contacted them. My mother certainly would have. She was -- I told you she\nwas enterprising. Even in Poland, I mean, she started to do a little bit of -- of you know, handling\nand -- and -- and you know, moving around in -- to make a living, scrounge up a living. So she\nwould go on trips to various places and so when we got to Germany, she would -- we would\nhave -- you know, by \u201946 we would have been in touch with the Jewish community, or the --\nsome of the relief organizations and we wound up -- how the decision was made to go to Poking,\nI mean, it probably wasn\u2019t our decision, they just sent you there.",
        "A: I-It was a -- a time I -- I will descri -- well, let me -- let me -- I -- y-y -- I was interviewed a\nnumber of years ago. Somewhere if I find it I'll send it to you, but -- an article in the Washington\nPost, somebody wanted to know why I was a Zionist. And the woman who was conducting the\ninterview, and I said, well, I can give you a sh -- very short answer, or I can give you the long\nanswer. She said no, I want the long answer. So I told her about -- a bit about my background,\nthis. And I tried to describe the feeling of what it meant for Israel, because I was in DP camp\nwhen Israel was established. The world was very gray, very threatening, s-still -- still threatening\nin some ways. You felt defeated in spirit. Not just personally, but also as part of a people. You\ndidn\u2019t even -- you know, I -- I know I sensed that. In other words, if you were a Jew, how could\nyou not feel defeated? But also, of course, if you\u2019re a child who has lost the parent and who has\nlost -- you know. So you feel -- you feel a s -- a sense of anguish about ya -- everything. So,\nwhen Israel was established it was just the opposite. It was sunshine, it was freedom, 1t was\nstrength. So suddenly people who are ex -- terribly weak and have been beaten by everybody are\nsuddenly on the ascent. So that early time was definitely a period of grayness and -- and no\nquestion. And just like our barracks, I mean, if you look at them, they were just these dingy, gray\non the outside barracks, in which each family got a room, essentially. My grandmother, my\nmother, my aunt and I shared one large room, and we put up a curtain across, you know, a\nblanket or something.",
        "A: Well, Pm --",
        "A: First camp I actually start school.",
        "A: I\u2019m six years old, I start school and I remember that. But my grandmother -- and I told you,\nmy grandmother was -- was Orthodox, observant woman, and she was in [indecipherable] the\nschool was conducted in Hebrew, everything in Hebrew, because even though it was 1946, they\nhad to choose a language that would suit everybody, so they said Hebrew. And all the subjects\nwe\u2019re talking here [indecipherable] it wasn\u2019t taught as a language. It meant my math books were\nin Hebrew, my geography, history books, blah, blah, blah. But my grandmother said well, but\nwhat about Yiddishkeit? She understood that there\u2019s a distinction between learning secular\nsubjects in Hebrew and so she also put me in something called a chayder, and I wound up going\nto a chayder from Lubovich. I -- first they put me in with satmar, we had a very large contingent\nof satmar in the camp. But I didn\u2019t like satmar for lots of reasons including the fact that they\u2019re\nanti-Zionist and so I wound up going to Lubovich, and you know, learning Hebrew the way it\u2019s\npronounced in Israel in the morning, daytime, and learning it differently pronounced in the\nafternoon. So I was getting two different points of view of Jewish history and pers -- my\nperspective was totally schizophrenic.",
        "A: Going to school in the afternoons, I wa --",
        "A: Oh yeah. Oh yeah.",
        "A: It was fun, I mean I -- I just --",

        "A: Yes --",
        "A: -- absolutely.",
        "A: Yeah, I still remember some of my childhood friends, very much so. And I -- and I remember\nsome of the adventures we had.",
        "A: Oh, we g-going to the surrounding farms, there were German farms that surrounded us,\nstealing vegetables and -- from their fields. Walking to the outskirts of the camp, where there\nwere craters from bombs that unexpl -- finding unexploded bombs, or going to -- I remember\nthere was -- there were like warehouses, huge warehouses on the outskirts which had been\nbombed out, it was dangerous to even walk in there. And we\u2019d go, you know, kids are like that.\nYou know, walking around and of course when my mother would find out she\u2019d be very upset\nand very angry. Walking around, finding all sorts of stuff at th-the -- this is what wartime is, nan\n-- and aftermath of a war is like, I mean you find stuff. You find unexploded shells, you find\ngoodness knows, you know. But we were in a camp of our own, we were not in touch. The adults\nwere, some of the adults. My mother learned German. But I had no contact with, let\u2019s say,\nGerman kids. You lived in Germany, but this camp was a community unto itself.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: They probably did, but I don\u2019t remember it --",
        "A: -- and I -- maybe we didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t focus on that.",
        "A: You know what I mean, I -- I had --",
        "A: Yeah, we --",
        "A: -- yes, we -- we had a soccer field, I remember people started, we -- we\u2019d go there, we started\nto -- trying to re -- we -- we got -- started to get stuff from the States, I mean, packages from --\nwith crayons and pencils and coloring books and things like that.",
        "A: You had communal --",
        "A: Yeah, communal -- I th -- I -- I think so. I think so. Except for the Shabbas meal. I think I ate\nmy Sabbath meals at my uncle\u2019s, cause they lived across the hall in the same building and the\nSabbath was always spent eating at their table.",
        "A: Yes, yes, absolutely. Absolutely. I also remember going to a summer camp.",
        "A: In this first camp, I -- my cousin Aaron, may God rest his soul, took me -- he and I went\ntogether, he was in the older unit, but he took good care of me. I don\u2019t remember that. In a\ndifferent mo -- ba -- in a different camp in Germany, which was sort of nicer than ours was.",
        "A: I probably did mind, but you know, it was a necessary experience for me. Yeah.",
        "A: First camp we stayed until 1948. Early \u201948, maybe like -- yeah, early \u201948. My -- my --",
        "A: No. I-Israel was born in May \u201948 --",
        "A: -- and we moved --",
        "A: We moved before that.",
        "A: I can\u2019t remember was -- what happened in \u201948 was also important. My two cousins, the ones I\nwas telling you about, Aaron and Menachem, my like two older brothers -- because I didn\u2019t have\nany siblings, my -- my Uncle Herschel had two daughters and my Uncle Zelig had two sons. My\n-- my older cousin Menachem just passed away this year, so [indecipherable] he was a source of\n-- he was like a brother. They want -- they wanted to get into Israel. And we all joined Zionist\nyouth movements in the camps because --",
        "A: Yeah, 1-in -- in -- in Poking. So I joined the right wing movement, I joined Betar, they joined\nleft wing movements. And they wanted to go and get into what was at that time still Palestine\nillegally, and they wound up getting turned back. But they didn\u2019t get sent to Cyprus, they wound\nup on the French Riviera, which was one of the -- we used to crack up about that. And they\nwound up in Nice, but then they said we still -- we\u2019re going back and they eventually got in and\nfought in the War of Independence. So their parents, of course, said we\u2019re not going to leave\nthem in Israel alone, we\u2019re going after them. So they left. And then my other brother als --\nmother\u2019s other brother, my other uncle, also went to Israel. So they wound up in Israel and we\nwound up, you know, coming here eventually. But it wa -- so they left from Poking. We then\nwent to another camp, the second camp, Heidenheim. And in Heidenheim --",
        "A: We were not asked, we were -- they were -- they sent us there. They sometime disbanded\ncamps. I don\u2019t remember what happened with Poking exactly. It -- it may have been, but\nsometimes they said this camp is at an end, you gotta go elsewhere. Or someth -- you know, I\nreally don\u2019t recall what the reason was. We went to Heidenheim where we had -- which was a\nmuch nicer in terms of the living arrangements, cause we were in a -- I remember it being a\nhouse. Now whether we had one apartment in the house, which is probably likely, and we had a\ngarden in the back. Even in Poking in the -- in the barracks, I remember we s -- the people\nstarted to raise chickens and I had my own little garden that I planted. I ra -- my interest -- I have\nan interest in gardening, it goes back to then. My Uncle Zelig and I raised pigeons together,\nexcept I saw them as pets and he saw them as, you know, a food source. But when we moved to\nHeidenheim is when, in the school, th -- I was in the choir and they taught us songs. I still have\nthe songbook, which was written out by hand, to sing on the occasion of Israel\u2019s establishment.",
        "A: Oh God, yeah, I ju -- I -- I -- I remember those songs, yeah.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: [sings] That\u2019s it.",
        "A: Anyway. I mean I -- I have -- I have -- I have my report cards from those schools.",
        "A: We stayed in the second camp for I -- you know, I can\u2019t remember exactly how long. This\nwas \u00b048? I would say probably til the beginning of \u201949, maybe. And then we moved to a third\ncamp --",
        "A: -- called Wasseralfingen.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Yeah, there were publications, there were newspapers, and --",
        "A: -- and there was radio. I mean, I\u2019d -- we listened to the radio to get the news. I was always\ninterested in -- in news, of course, especially from news about the Jewish community and\nPalestine, the nascent state of Israel. We all joined Zionist youth movements. What happened\nwas that emissaries came from Palestine, Israel. In those days a Palestinian referred to a Jew, you\nknew -- you knew the other residents of that area as Arabs, they were not called Palestinians. So\nemissaries came over to organize the kids into sports clubs, youth groups, etcetera. Some of them\nwere -- had specific ideologies. So the s -- so you had labor Zionists, you had religious Zionists,\nand you had -- you know, the -- the one I joined, which was Betar, which was considered right\nwing Zionists, or nationalists. But I was very much aware of the news in pre-state Israel, no ca --\nand -- and -- and you know, pre-state Palestine when the Haganah and the Irgun were fighting\nthe British, for example. So the Haganah at that time had a policy called Havlagah, restraint.\nIrgun was not, the Irgun believed in hitting back, which some considered to be too provocative\nand that -- you know. I actually used to cheer for -- for Irgun, you know, as the -- you know,\nother Jews, different places, but that depended on your own outlook and your own -- your own\nexperience. But I was very much aware of what was -- what was going on, as were the other\nkids, I think. Yeah.",
        "A: Th-The [indecipherable] yeah.",
        "A: Oh of course, of course.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "A: Well, I mean I -- I think --",
        "A: Well, I mean, I -- I think you certainly knew who Hitler was. I mean, that -- not -- not just\nknew, but you knew that 1 -- I had a sense of the --",
        "A: Right, no, I -- I understand and I can -- I can relate to that more easily on the positive side. I\nknow that the Russians were my heroes because they liberated us.",
        "A: The Americans were heroes, but the Americans were also sometimes seen as not being tough\nenough on the Germans, an -- oddly. So the stuff, 1f you read history now, that -- you know, th-\nthe Russians did some terrible, brutal things when they went west and we all -- we know that. I\njust got finished reading a book not long ago about the -- you know, the battle of -- of Berlin.\nAnd so they did some awful things. But don\u2019t forget, 1f you\u2019re a victim of Nazism, you want\nrevenge. So war means some terrible things are done on all sides, so you mean as a child I\ncertainly was aware of Hitler as the -- you know, the ultimate evil to beset the Jewish people, but\nI was also aware, from what my mother told me about, that he was only the latest and greatest if\nyou will, in a long line of people as -- as the Hagadah says, in every generation somebody rises\nagainst us to destroy us. So I was aware of that. I was also -- there was something else that -- that\nmaybe my -- when you don\u2019t know who your father is or was, you can grow up with -- you hear\nstories. And my mother helped in some ways to give me this mythic vision of my father. What\nkind of man he was or would have been, I have no idea. I can speculate about it because I knew\nsome -- you know. And -- and -- and -- and -- and on my father\u2019s side, I mean sadly, of the\nfamily there was almost nobody left that I could even say, well he would have been like this, or\nlike this guy, or somebody else. My father\u2019s side there were only two relatives left that I met.\nOne in the United States, the one who actually brought us over, who was his -- his -- my father\u2019s\nuncle, my great uncle and his sister in Brazil. I never even knew what my father looked like until\nmy aunt -- great aunt in Brazil sent us a photo. So yeah, I mean, you grow up with a child\u2019s\nperception of all these -- these things, but -- but I think was also fairly grounded in reality.",
        "A: Oh sure.",
        "A: I mean we had -- they had celebrations throughout, it\u2019s not like -- the ki -- the camps --",
        "A: -- the camps, it -- the camps developed, and this 1s the -- the -- the -- the beauty about the\nJewish people is the ability to bounce back from utter despair and -- and grief is -- 1s amazing,\nbecause di -- don\u2019t forget -- I mean, I was in the first camp a year or half a year after the end of\nthe war.",
        "A: And people started writing newspapers, and people published newspapers, people started\nschools again and people -- so there\u2019s a whole -- they started an institutional framework. My\naunt -- my Aunt R-Rachel was married in the camp, I remember that wedding, I remember going\nthere. I mean, I ca -- you know, we had meetings, we had political groups. So life swung back\ninto action. I don\u2019t remember specifically -- I do remember singing in the choir and how exciting\nit was when Israel was born. But I don\u2019t remember any other -- yeah.",
        "A: I remember just -- I -- I remember in the second camp we already would go into the town,\nbecause th-this camp, unlike the other one, which was kind of a circumscribed area was closer to\nthe town, you could actually walk out -- it was actually part of the town but sort of on the\noutskirts. And -- and I reme-member feeling a sense of jealousy. Yo-You know, the Germans\nwere not back yet, but somehow this was their country and --",
        "A: On my part. On my -- that -- that this was their turf, this was, you know --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And it was a beautiful place. I mean, the outskirts I remember really liking. We\nwent -- I remember going with my mother and some of her friends, because she had some\nfriends, she had -- you know, she was socializing. She met my stepfather, whom she would later\nmarry in the United States, actually in the first camp. He was the movie projectionist, we had a\nmovie the -- set up in the barracks. Which was a whole other story, that\u2019s an experience I\nremember. But we -- we -- the second camp was -- was -- oh, we would go on trips to some -- th-\nthis was part of Bavaria, the camps were in Bavaria, which was beautiful. And parts of Bavaria\nwas like being in the Swiss Alps. So we -- I remember one place we went to called Ludwigsburg,\nnamed after German King Ludwig. And it was gorgeous, you know. So -- but I knew that wasn\u2019t\nus, you know what I mean, I knew it wasn\u2019t ours in the -- in the -- I thought I -- I -- I lost my\ntrain of thought, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, in -- in -- what happened in the -- I -- I said that li-life sprang back, you know, in terms\nof institutions. We had a movie theater in camp.",
        "A: In the first camp. I\u2019m sure we did in the other too, but I don\u2019t remember it. And was -- it was\nset up in a -- in large barracks again, and my stepfather Saul -- Shaul, whom she wound up\nmarrying when she got to the States was the projectionist. And he was a jack of all trades, he was\na very talented electrician and he could make things. So he made me -- he took a cigar box, I\nremember this, and sh -- he made me my own little slide projector with a cigar box so that I\ncould take bits of film that they snip off from a movie trailer or something and show it like -- pu-\npush the film through the opening and it -- he\u2019d project it on the wall. He used to have me -- let\nme sit in the back, you know, where they sit, the projectionist sits. So they made up, he lost his\nentire family in the war. He had been newlywed when the war broke out. Lost his wife, lost his\nparents, his brothers. And he came from White Russia. And --",
        "A: Shaul -- Saul Pikus. P-1-k-u-s, that was my mother\u2019s second name. And his father was a\nschool -- headmaster of a -- of the school and h-he -- he had nobody left.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: And then we wound up going to a third camp called Wasseralfingen. I don\u2019t remember much\nabout that camp except having a crush on an older girl. Oh, and the family split. My aunt, who\nhad gotten married -- I told you my Aunt Rachel married and from Heidenheim they were sent to\n-- and she had a -- a kid, my cousin Susan was born in camp also. She was -- I -- I loved Susie.\nOh, she was -- she\u2019s seven years younger than I am, so she was like -- and -- and they left to\nanother camp, we split, and we went to Wasseralfingen. And in that camp I remember there was\na girl whose name I no longer remember. But I would have been nine and she was probably 11\nor 12 or something. I remember having a giant crush on her, but other than that I don\u2019t remember\nanything. And of course continued going to school there, same kind of thing. And the -- and the\nfoundation, I speak some Hebrew now, a bit. Enough to kind of get around Israel. But the\nfoundation for it was really based on those schools, the first three years of my schooling was in\nthese camps.",
        "A: And then from there -- all these camps were -- Heidenheim and -- and Wasseralfingen were\nboth shorter term camps, like six, seven months. Poking was three years, \u201946 - \u201947 - \u00b048. And\nthen we went to a place called -- now it escapes me. There was -- there was a final destination.",
        "A: Another camp before, but that was for a short period before we went to -- to -- to port, to\nBremerhaven -- Bremenhaven to come to America.",
        "A: My mother decided that -- you know --",
        "A: Not to go to Israel. She felt that as a widow with a child that Israel was a nice new state, but\nas such she --",
        "A: -- she would have to face greater hardship there. So we had -- my -- my father had an uncle\nhere and he signed an affidavit to sponsor us. We were able to accelerate the process and --",
        "A: No, I told you, I had my heart set on going to Israel.",

And the first memory, I walked into the place, their place\nand they were watching -- or my cousin -- they had an adopted daughter, was watching Six Gun\nPlayhouse. I don\u2019t know if you are old enough to remember that. And then I remember they were\ntaking me, cause it was already getting chilly, shopping for a heavier jacket than I had.",

To this day there will always be somebody in a crowd who will say, are you American\nborn? Somebody can pick up. I couldn\u2019t pronounce the A. I couldn\u2019t distinguish between Barry\nand berry. And what I remember, we went to camp. I went to a summer camp run by a -- an\noutfit that\u2019s no longer around, the Hebrew Educational Society. They ran a camp in Bear\nMountain, New York. The kids would make fun of my inability to pronounce the A. They also\nmade fun of my name. You know, my name is Menachem Mendel. And how did I get the name\nMelvin? Well, the American relatives got together. There was a powwow, I remember this. And\nthey said, let\u2019s choose a name with an M. And they said Melvin. Well, a few months later Jerry\nLewis -- remember Martin and Lewis, when they used to be on? Jerry Lewis made fun of the\nname Melvin. And it became like the worst name that you can have. So hence I was Mel after\nthat. Did I feel -- the answer is yes, I continued to feel like a refugee even -- I mean, part of me\nbecame very American, but even in high school there would be periods when I felt that these\nother kids are more fortunate than I am because they\u2019re real Americans and I\u2019m not.",

        "A: It has stayed with me all these years and I would say that it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a special sensitivity,\nokay? It\u2019s like if you grow up -- and I think a lot of these things are foundational, I\u2019m not saying\nanything profound, but it -- it\u2019s simply that if you grow up with -- with a sense of rootedness\nwhen you\u2019re young, that stays with you the rest of your life. It doesn\u2019t mean that when you\u2019re\ntraveling to a foreign country you don\u2019t experience a certain discomfort at not knowing the\nlanguage, oh -- but you -- it\u2019s different. If you have -- don\u2019t grow up with that, and if you\u2019ve\nmissed it for the first 10 years of your life, it\u2019s very hard to replace something like that, and it\nmeans you carry it with you into all sorts of situations. It may take you a little bit longer to adjust\nto a particular thing, or may -- you know. But you do carry it with you and it\u2019s not that you can\u2019t\n-- you know, we learn to articulate certain things and we become aware of them, but that doesn\u2019t\nmean that they -- there aren\u2019t certain predispositions that remain there. And I think that -- that\nhappens, and I -- and I know about it, bu -- you know, and -- and -- and also attempts I made to\novercome it. I -- I had a job for ORT, wonderful organization that did a lot for Jewish youngsters\nlike me in the camps. I remember ORT and I rem -- when I wa -- came for the interview with\nORT, the m-man interviewing me, who was David Dubinsky\u2019s son-in-law, Shelley Appleton, a\nwonderful man, and Shelley said -- asked me what I knew about ORT. I said, I don\u2019t know\nanything about your American organization, nothing whatsoever. But I said, I do remember it. I\nremember the ORT workshops from my childhood. That impressed him. So later on I had a job\nworking for the international office of ORT and I traveled the world. When I would travel to\ndifferent countries, whether it was in South America, or di -- I would feel -- re-experience that\nsense of rootlessness that I\u2019m telling you about, but in a more, I think in a more heightened sense\nof it than another person would. And I felt that sense -- so we carry our sense of home in us. And\nI think that it\u2019s -- it\u2019s hard to replace. If y -- if y -- if you didn\u2019t develop it by a certain a -- it\u2019s\nhard to replace it and it does have -- leave an impact, cause that\u2019s what I talked about, leaving a\nscar.

And so my friend Gil, the\none I was telling you about who lost both his parents in Auschwitz, he and I -- he had just lost\nhis grandmother, he and I decided to go to Israel together.

So it\u2019s\neasier just to block things off and to kind of -- I think one of the great things, and I say this, that\nin what you\u2019re doing, and what the museum -- I mean, I remember when I worked in the\nAmerican Zionist Youth Foundation, when one of the first exhibits came around.

But old liberals change. I mean\n[ -- I did more. I mean, I -- I sort of became more closer to a NeoCon than -- yeah.

I have to think of my father as a --\nas a kid. But I think that -- no, it\u2019s appreciating the difficulty and -- and -- and that, you know,\nyo-young people are -- think they know it all, and I thought I knew it all, that\u2019s all.",

        "A: Yeah, a psychological barrier. I really didn\u2019t like the Germans. That\u2019s to put it mildly. Joyce\nwhen I met her had a German pen-pal and it became an issue, became like a -- a -- an irritant in\nour relationship. And that pen-pal\u2019s sister came to visit, and we invited her to our apartment.\nThis -- way back when we were young. And I said, look, I can -- I can deal with individuals and\nI judge them as individuals, but if you ask me how do I feel about Germany, I still had, you\nknow. And -- and I don\u2019t say that I\u2019ve even overcome it, except it\u2019s many years thereafter, I\u2019m\naware of what Germany means and what it -- its government is like and what its relationship\nwith Israel is all about. So, you know. Have I come to terms with what the Germans did to the\nJews? Absolutely not, I will never come to terms with that. But you know, do I think that\nGermany has been at the forefront of countries that have really tried to come to grips with its\nhistory and with this issue? Yes, absolutely. I have to acknowledge that. And I d -- and I -- and I\ndon\u2019t want to give vent, sometimes, you know, we all deal with periods of paranoia and you\nknow. I think the Germans have tried in -- in all sorts of ways to come to terms -- even in their\nrelationship with Israel. I was just reading a wonderful piece about that, how they, you know,\nsome can feel a real sense of responsibility.",
        "A: SO --",
        "A: I don\u2019t speak German, but I can, because of my knowledge of Yiddish, I can read sometimes\nsome stuff in German and make some sense out of it. And it\u2019s a language that I probably -- well,\nI was toying with the idea of maybe learning it. But its grammar is too complex and kind of -- I\nfind grammar can be -- I -- I have a -- a -- a -- an ear for languages, and -- and I -- my\npronunciation is usually very good, but I can\u2019t stand grammar. And the German grammar is too\ncomplicated.",

        "A: A sense of pride in the people who had abducted him. I followed the trial like everybody did,\nalmost daily on television. I felt -- y-you know I feel -- listen, we felt -- I felt a sense of the\nhistorical justice, but I -- you know, did it mean that it evened the score? Absolutely not. It was -\n- I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if I have any -- any thoughts beyond that. I\u2019m a great -- I -- even at\nthat time there was controversy about did Israel conform to international law, was it the right\nthing to abduct somebody and all that. I\u2019m a great believer, unapologetic, in Jewish power,\nabsolutely. So I was very -- that was ma -- the overriding thing was it\u2019s about time that we did\nthis. I\u2019m glad Israel executed him. I\u2019m glad he is the only one that Israel ever executed 1n its\nhistory. Israel has no capital punishment. But we -- we have -- I mean, I -- we\u2019re\n[indecipherable] we have a sense of loss, which is -- is there, it can\u2019t be -- you know, even --\neven a State of Israel, let\u2019s say, cannot even out the score for the loss we experienced. That\u2019s just\nthe way it is. It\u2019s a great gain, but it doesn\u2019t -- and this is something else. The loss that we\nsuffered was not just in people, it was on history. I was talking to my cousin Menachem who just\ndied this year and my aunt, my mother\u2019s sister is still alive. So she\u2019s approaching her 90\u2019s, but\nMenachem, unfortunately was very ill and died in his 70\u2019s. My aunt, however, has dementia so I\ncan\u2019t ask her anything and I\u2019m -- and we don\u2019t have a family so I was on the phone with my\ncousin Menachem\u2019s daughter, who is now 50. And of course she wants to know her history. I\nsaid, we gotta do a family tree. But now it means filling in gaps, you know. So we lost that\nhistorical thread. That\u2019s why I do appreciate the kind of work you\u2019re doing here and what, you\nknow, what everybody does. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s fabulous.",
        "A: I want to go. I e -- I have -- no, the answer is no, I haven\u2019t been back. I\u2019ve toyed with that\nidea, I want to do it. In fact, I spoke to Mishelin about doing this. I did a lot of traveling but\nnever got to eastern Europe or even -- or to central Europe. I\u2019ve -- \u2019ve thought about it, I -- and -\n- and I know people who did, who -- who went back to -- to the town where I was born, to\nKowal. And today you can, you know, go on Google Earth and you -- it\u2019s amazing what you can\ndo. But I -- I have mixed feelings about that too, I really do.",
        "A: Yeah, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking for. You know, I don\u2019t know why I would want to go\nback. There are lots of places on earth which I enjoyed traveling to. I mean, I enjoyed ga -- a few\nyears ago going to Peru, or to Mexico or something. So why am I going there? What am I going\nto find there? I don\u2019t know. I am interested, I mean in -- in one respect, I do want to do\nsomething about filling in the gaps in my own family history, just so -- so my kids and my\ngrandkids will know. And it\u2019s something we all fall prey to, I have a -- a vanity book that I have\ndownstairs that it was given to me by a man who was -- when Reagan was president\n[indecipherable] very wealthy man from a s -- Iraqi Jewish banking family. I mean a billionaire.\nAnd he gave me a signed copy of his book, and he said it\u2019s a history of his family. I said why\u2019d\nyou do it? And of course he, you know, he hired somebody to write it for him. He said, because I\nwant my children and grandchildren to know where they were coming from. So I said wow, this\nguy\u2019s a billionaire, if he -- he -- but he also delayed. It happens to all of us, you know, so I feel I\ndelayed, I mean, I should have started this process and -- and -- and your call was important in\nthat, it really was.",
        "A: Yes. Yes, I do.",
        "A: It\u2019s an amalgam of things. It was partly my mother\u2019s influence. My mother\u2019s influence is very\nimportant because quite frankly, it was important in my Zionist beliefs. It was important in my\nreligious -- in my grandmother\u2019s. I sh -- I should say my grandmother. And in some way -- and\nwhen I think about it sometimes I say I -- because I became ultimately, after winding -- I -- I --\nmy first half of my career or first third if you will, was in youth work, organizing people in\ncollege campuses.",
        "A: Leon Wieseltier of the \u201cNew Republic\u201d was my campus rep, to give you an idea. I had a good\n-- the one talent I think I had was sizing people up. My mother was interested in a business\ncareer for me. My grandmother, Yiddishkeit, so I combined the two of them, became a Jewish\nfundraiser. I said, this is like. My religion, I would say was transi -- a religious sensitivity, if you\nwill, was transmitted by these two women, but also by the Yeshiva, and by some of the teachers I\nhad in Yeshiva, more importantly. The -- the -- my mother\u2019s and grandmother\u2019s may have been\ntinged a bit with superstition, which also comes from that part of [indecipherable]. I -- ve\nalways -- I\u2019ve -- one of my good buddies who is also one of my former kids, ise -- I -- in\nquotation marks. I just -- he\u2019s a very successful lawyer in New York whom we just had dinner\nwith. And he and I would always argue cause his grandfather was very important to him, his --\nhis grandfather was from Lithuania though, so they were the midnagdin. I came from there, I\nsaid Ukraine was the birthplace of Hasidism, right? There\u2019s always a little bit of -- you know,\nHasidim are emotional and the others are rational and intellectual. I got the emotional part from\nmy mother and grandmother and if you will, the rational part from some of my rabbis. I am\nreligious. Was I -- but I was also angry at God. And I had this discussion with my oldest and best\nfriend Gil, cause he\u2019Il always say -- we\u2019ll have conversa -- I -- I have used reference points from\nGenesis and from different books of the Bible, and he\u2019ll say how come you remember this stuff?\nI don\u2019t remember anything. And he says -- he always said he was a non-believer. And I said to\nhim once, because he was talking wi -- full of anger at God, I said, are you sure you don\u2019t\nbelieve? Because if you\u2019re angry at God, presupposes that you believe. So I was angry at God.\nNo doubt about it, and still am from time to time. But that doesn\u2019t preclude the fact, quite the\nopposite, it affirms it. And -- and th -- th -- I had -- one privilege I had and I -- I told you I had\ngreat experience working in -- in -- and when I was working as a college -- I was really a field\norganizer. I took around some wonderful people. I\u2019d come back all excited at the end of the day.\nSo one of the guys I took around was Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, I don\u2019t know if you know --\nfamiliar with him. And I -- this is many years, it was probably his first trip to America. And they\nsaid, take him around to Jewish Day Schools or whatever. And I came back and I told Joyce, I\nsaid, [indecipherable] this blew my mind, you know? And I only dealt with bright peop -- they\u2019re\nall bright, you know what I mean, th -- you know. So I said, but he -- he -- I still remember what\nhe said. He said, I would rather, when I\u2019m working with students, I'd rather work with somebody\nwho is angry at God than somebody who is indifferent to God. Because if he says he -- if he\u2019s\nangry, he cares, and I can turn that around. If he\u2019s indifferent it\u2019s much tougher. So in that sense,\nyeah, I mean I felt myself like a lot of other Jewish people and kids especially, felt myself\nvictimized, then abandoned and all of that. On the other hand, you know, go -- ge -- God can be\nthe source of your anger, in a sense, or the object of your anger, but can also be a sense of your\nregeneration of spirit.",
        "A: I\u2019ve told them s -- y-yes, I have told them certainly, I mean, it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve tried to a -- that\nI\u2019ve tried to withhold things from them, no. And -- but it was kind of as an aside if you know\nwhat I mean. I -- I would tell them things, if it came up or if it was you know, but I -- I -- I wish I\nhad done more. But I did tell them.",
        "A: I -- I guess I\u2019m -- I wish I had undertaken a more structured way, ongoing way to educate\nthem about the family, the history and all that. But, I mean, it -- it\u2019s not as though I went from\none extreme to another, I mean, they had something, you know, they -- they -- they -- they\ncertainly know. They went to Israel with us a few times, they knew the family. I would very\nmuch like to reconne -- it\u2019s hard to maintain a -- even your all -- it\u2019s easier today with email to\nmaintain certain things, you know, but -- but still, to maintain a relationship geographically\ndistanced 1s -- is tough. But I would like them to maintain a connection to -- yeah, to the Jewish\npeople, to their family and hopefully to a sense of, you know, belief.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I\u2019ve --",
        "A: -- been there a few times. Do I have a certain feeling? Yeah, I mean, I have lots of feelings. I -\n- I -- once we went -- God, I\u2019m trying to remember the first time. Once we went with\n[indecipherable] because they -- there was something there that\u2019s dedicated to the stepmother of\none of our friends, this lawyer I was telling you about, his wife\u2019s stepmother was one of the\nRighteous who saved -- and is mentioned in one of the exhibits in -- in the museum. I think it\u2019s a\ngreat place. I think it\u2019s a -- how can I put it? I haven\u2019t been to the new Yad Vashem, which I\u2019m\ntold is fantastic.",
        "A: Oh, that\u2019s a good question. That\u2019s a very good question. I\u2019m glad it is. Do I think -- but I\ndon\u2019t know about appropriateness, I mean in terms of would another place be more appropriate, I\ndon\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know, but I think it\u2019s a great museum, it\u2019s a great institution.",
        "A: -- far away. Why do we have the museum here?\nironically, Israel and the United States, although we\u2019re always at 5.8 or whatever, we\u2019re all --\nwe ve been at that number for -- since I arrived in this country. So I suppose in that sense it -- it -\n- there is some sense, since we have large survivor communities, that this 1s a Jewish -- this, if\nyou will, it\u2019s a -- you know, you have Jerusalem and you had Babylon -- th-the -- the Babylon\nJewish community. So we\u2019re in the place of bab -- we\u2019re -- we\u2019re two great Jewish communi --\nRussia -- Russia still has a large Jewish community but it\u2019s much smaller, it\u2019s about two -- two\npoint five million, maybe. These are two great Jewish communities, so it\u2019s thoroughly fitting that\nthere should be a serious Holocaust institution in the United States, thoroughly appropriate. Is it -\n- it -- and -- and in Israel. Can I see it in another city in America? Yeah, could be in New York.\nNew York has the Museum of the Jewish Herit -- which is nice in its own way, it\u2019s a different\nkind of institution. But I think it\u2019s a great museum and it does everybody proud, inclu --\nincluding the government, including, you know, the Jewish community.",
        "A: God, you -- I -- I get very cynical some days because I spend too much time reading articles\non the internet, but has the world learned? It has, but it\u2019s also unlearned. The answer is yes to\nboth. It has unlearned and has learned. And that\u2019s the sad part and it means that great challenges\nstill confront us. They\u2019re -- all one has to do is look at the daily news. Lo-Look at -- I mean, it\u2019s\nnot just us. And y -- holocausts have been visited in Rwanda and in Darfur and in -- you know.\nMaybe smaller scale, but big enough. So yeah, th-th-the lessons haven\u2019t been fully learned, no\nquestion about it. I mean, how can you countenance what a guy like Ahmadinejad says? And\nthen he gets feted at the U.N. and then he gets invited to Columbia? I mean, come on, you know?\nBut people don\u2019t realize this 1s a crazy world. Hitler was on the -- on -- on a list to be -- people\nrecommended he get the peace prize back when, you know. So what makes us think that we are\ndifferent, that we, you know, we\u2019ve outsmarted everybody. I mean I -- I don\u2019t want to get totally\ncynical. Yes, we do learn, but we also unlearn lessons and we forget. And a new -- and this is th\n-- it\u2019s the same thing, I was just talking to somebody sitting next to me -- oh, that Bat Mitzvah\nwe went to in New York. Wonderful guy. He said yeah, he was [indecipherable] talking about\nthe exodus story and th-the -- a new pharaoh arose in Egypt who didn't know Joseph. It\u2019s a new\nballgame. So -- and I think we\u2019re living through a particularly delicate time, but I don\u2019t want to\nget into politics, cause I know that\u2019s not your purpose here.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m gonna think of a lot of things after you leave, but I c -- I can\u2019t -- you\nknow. I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yeah. I think that what I\u2019d like to sta -- say to them is to stay strong and it\u2019s t -- 1t\u2019s two\nthings, actually, re-remember, it says that at the end, when you finish the Bible, it says, Chazak\nve amatz. And the other is, you gotta believe. You gotta believe. And I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t care\nwhether it\u2019s in a secular sense or in a religious sense. People see that -- that kind of dichotomy. I\nsaid, even if you believe in a secular context, you also gotta believe.",
        "A: Believe in the integrity of an idea, that in -- 1-1n -- in essence -- I mean, I don\u2019t want to get too\ndeep. In the -- in -- in the Hebrew language there is really no word that is the equivalent of\nreligion.",
