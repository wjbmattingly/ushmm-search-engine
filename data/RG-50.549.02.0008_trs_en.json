        "Question: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.\nThis is an interview with Rene Slotkin, conducted by Regina Baier on September 18th,\n1997 at Mr. Slotkin\u2019s home in New York City. This is a follow-up interview to the\nUnited States Holocaust Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for\nmaking this interview possible. This is tape number one, side A. Let\u2019s start with what\nyour name was originally and what it is now.",
        "Answer: My name originally was Rene Guttman and today I\u2019m Rene Slotkin, my adopted\nname.",
        "Q: And when were you born and where?",
        "A: I was born December 21st, 1937, in Tepledseshanof, Czechoslovakia.",
        "Q: Where -- whereabouts 1s that?",
        "A: That\u2019s north -- north of Prague. I understand now that that was abarbel Jewish\ncommunity at the time. And then my next rec -- my only recollection -- I don\u2019t have\nrecollection of Tepledseshanof, I do have recollection of Prague, as where we spent our\ntime before the war.",
        "Q: This interview will focus on your life experience after liberation, through the present\nday. However, would you tell us, just very briefly, a little bit about your family before the\nwar?",
        "A: My memories are very, very hazy about family before the war. I just have little\nvignettes of happenings, that happened with my sister -- us playing on the porch, a storm,\na staircase, me falling on a staircase and hurting my chin, requiring some kind of very\nburning ointment to -- to heal it. I honestly don\u2019t remember my mother. I remember our\nsurrounding, somewhat -- the apartment, or -- I do not remember my mother, my father.",
        "Q: But how large was your family? So you had a twin sister?",
        "A: [ha -- I had a twin sister and there was my mother and my father. All this 1s now\nconfirmed by the pictures that we have. We were very, very lucky to be able to obtain\npictures of the four of us, of the three of us, of the two of us, in that way.",
        "Q: What happened then, when you were forced to -- away from your home? Where --\nwhere did you go?",
        "A: First time away from home was we were taken to Theresienstadt. That was with my\nmother only, my father had been taken away from us months or maybe a year before.\nTime, to me didn\u2019t really register too well. But we were taken to Theresienstadt, my\nmother, my sister and myself. That\u2019s my first memory of being away from -- from our\napartment in Prague.",
        "Q: And do you know now when that was, roughly?",
        "A: I now know, yes. It was at the beginning of *43 or the end of *42. That\u2019s roughly the\ntime frame. And we were there almost a year, before they took us from there to\nAuschwitz.",
        "Q: In Theresienstadt you were together with your mother and your sister?",
        "A: Yes, we were together as a family, we lived as a family.",
        "Q: Did you go through the Auschwitz experience also together with both of them?",
        "A: Well, what I know now, is that we were taken to Auschwitz. It was the winter of \u201843,\nDecember \u201843. We did live together for a couple of months until that Czech lager was\ndisbanded and must have been exterminated, except for the exception of some twins and\nsome people that they needed for either work or experiments. So, up to that point we\nlived together, after that we were separate. My mother was gone at this point. My sister\nand I were separated because we lived according to our sexes.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about the -- the days or the time leading up to liberation. What -- in\nwhat kind of state were you, in ph-physical, mental state. Can -- do you have any\nrecollections?",
        "A: I can\u2019t really tell you what I looked like or what I real -- I felt like -- it felt the same to\nme all the time, but externally I could tell that there was an activity in the camps that\nwasn\u2019t there always before. The soldiers were much more lax, there were more numerous\nair raids. There was arterler -- artillery fire that you could hear in -- 1n the -- on the\nhorizons and they we -- it was not as orderly as it was just bef -- during -- it wasn\u2019t as\norderly as it was before.",
        "Q: Do you remember any -- any particular sounds, or any particular intense images from\nthat time?",
        "A: Sounds -- just a drone of the aircraft and artillery, but nothing else, sound-wise, no.",
        "Q: And when liberation came, what happened? What happened then?",
        "A: Well, liberation to me specifically came while we were on the march and we were\nbeing marched out of the camp, destination who knows and people were having a very\nhard time. It was -- it was winter, snow was on the ground and anybody that fall out of\nline or couldn\u2019t keep it up, they ju -- they would just kill. They were shot or pushed\noverboard and that was the end of them. That kept up for a very long time, I can\u2019t tell you\nexactly how much, but it was on for a very, very long time and all of a sudden the -- our\nGerman guards disappeared, they were gone. And we were surrounded by Russian\nsoldiers dressed in white and that was -- that was the liberation.",
        "Q: Do you remember what happened then, how they treated you?",
        "A: Well, the Russians -- the memory that I have, they marched us off into a -- into a food\nwarehouse and there was a general stampede for -- for everything that you could get your\nhands on and I being very little, I couldn\u2019t really get through to anything, except I do\nremember very distinctly, being able to grab a hold of a gold can of something and -- and\nrolling it in front of me. It turned out to be sauerkraut when we opened it afterwards.",
        "Q: Did you eat it, did you taste it?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I must -- the smell of 1t I remember, but I don\u2019t remember really\ntasting it, no.",
        "Q: Do you remember how people responded to -- to this food intake all of a sudden, after\nSO --",
        "A: It -- it was frenzied. That\u2019s the only way I can describe it. I don\u2019t have any real visuals\nabout people fainting from or dying, but it was a frenzy of -- of getting at it.",
        "Q: How old were you then?",
        "A: I had just turned seven. It was -- my birthday was in December and we were liberated\nin January.",
        "Q: What happened then? What is your next memory? Where were you taken?",
        "A: Next memory is -- is a hospital setting in -- in -- and I know now it was -- it was pra --\nit was Bratislava in -- in Slovakia. And I do remember being under doctor\u2019s care and\nhaving x-ray work done. Roentgen, I think, was the name that they used a lot. And I\nunderstand that I -- I was a bit sick. From there, my real clear memory is in -- I was sent\nto a orphanage in -- in Kosheetza.",
        "Q: How was it -- do you remember what it was like being there, in the orphanage?",
        "A: I -- again, I just remember events that happened to me -- not so much my feelings. I\nfelt -- no, I-I really should say, I -- I was -- I felt loved, taken care of. These were nuns\nthat took care of me. And we felt -- we felt that we were being taken care of. I remember\nat on point in time, one of the nuns gave me a very big hug -- I\u2019ve mentioned this before -\n- and she gave me such a strong hug, she actually loosened one of my teeth. It was about\nto fall out anyway, but it happened at that point in time and I do remember that, that\u2019s a\nmemory I'll take with me.",
        "Q: What was your -- sort of your relationship to the other boys? I -- th -- yeah, what was\nyour relationship to the other boys, did you talk about things, did you --",
        "A: In the orphanage, no, no. I -- I really -- I really don\u2019t remember. I suspect that I wasn\u2019t\nthere very, very long in the orphanage setting, because the next memories that come up --\nand this is where I now start to become a person and I do communicate with people, was\nwhen Dr. Kalina, who was one of the administrators of this hospital/orphanage complex,\ntook me into his home. And I -- I -- I suspect that one of the reasons why he did that was\nbecause he and his wife were childless and that was a nice experience while it lasted.\nSubsequently, they did have a daughter born to them, Mimi was her name, the mother\u2019s\nname was Helena and he was Dr. Kalina. Nown Dr. Kalina. I can\u2019t remember his first\nname, though. Could be Frank or could -- that could have been his brother, but I\u2019 Il tr --\nDr. Kalina is a sure thing. And I live with them.",
        "Q: Did you remember at that point, did you think back to your parents and to your sister,\nwhile you lived there?",
        "A: I honestly did not connect to the past in any way. I just lived in the present. My sister\nwas though, however, constantly on my mind. I knew I had a sister and I knew that\nsomehow I was going to meet her and whenever things got tough, I said to myself, \u201c\u201cThis\nis -- I\u2019m going to do this for my sister.\u201d Whatever it was, whether it was a small problem\nor a big problem. But I lived in the present and I must say that the people really treated\nme very nicely. We lived in an apartment building and I do remember there was a\ncourtyard in the back and I don\u2019t know if they bought this for me or for their daughter\nthat was born, but I suspect it was more for me, because she was really a baby. They\nbought a little goat. This story I don\u2019t think has been told ever. A little goat and I had sort\nof responsibly for it, it was in a sort of a gardened off or a fenced off area. And it was a\nvery sweet sort of little thing and I fed it. I remember it pulling lettuce from my hands.\nThat\u2019s a very sweet experience. He also -- Dr. Kalina, now that I\u2019m thinking about it -- he\nwas -- he had an -- obviously an important position and he was somewhat well-to-do. He\n-- he had one of the few cars that private citizens owned at the time. It was a green\nconvertible and I guess as a boy I would have -- I would have loved to have driven that\nthing, but I enjoyed riding in it tremendously. There are other things about that\nexperience with the Kalinas. They allowed me to do things and I especially remember\nSundays. I don\u2019t know why I think of it as Sundays, but I\u2019m sure it was a Sunday, they\nwould always give me a couple of coronas -- money -- Czecho -- Czechoslovakian. And\nthey would let me go to -- to the local butcher store and I was able to purchase 10\ndecagrams of salami, which was the delicacy bar none for me. Once a week I was able to\ndo that -- that little bit of pielites living with the Kalinas also. There were other things I\nrecollect. It\u2019s the first time I think ve ever heard a phonograph. And they had a very\nfancy phonograph combination bar set, that opened up, the lights went on and there were\nglasses and played beautiful waltzes, music. These just -- little details, little details. Ho-\nHo-Home with ka -- with the Kalinas.",
        "Q: You mentioned salami. At that point, you were not educated in the Jewith -- Jewish\nfaith?",
        "A: Mm-hm. No, not at all, I had no idea about the laws of Kashrut or anything like that. I\nthink at th-that point in time -- I -- I don\u2019t think they were observant to any -- a great deal\neither. At that point in time, food was more the important thing, rather than yo -- than any\nof the restrictions on it. Kashrut was -- I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever -- in Czechoslovakia -- I\u2019ve\nheard the term, I\u2019ve seen the -- in Kosheetza, I went to slaughterhouses even -- not\nslaughterhouses as such, but places where they kill chickens. So -- so I know there was a\nritual to it, but I -- as far as forbidden foods, no. I -- I had no idea of anything being truly\nforbidden, no.",
        "Q: Did you go to school?",
        "A: Yes, I went to -- to school in Czechoslovakia, 1n Kosheetza. And that was quite an\nexperience. I think I was the only Jew, besides one other, in my whole school and I\u2019m\nreally sad to say and til this day I -- I find it so difficult to understand why we were really\nso disliked. W-We looked just like the rest of the kids, we didn\u2019t publicly appear -- I\nmean we did not appear Jewish in any way. We didn\u2019t wear hats or yarmulkes or had\nlong hair or anything like that. My only mark was my number. That branded me a Jew,\nhowever. And this other fellow, his name was Sobol, I don\u2019t think he had a number from\nany camp, but he was Jewish, they knew he was Jewish. Maybe he looked more Jewish\nthan I did, if there\u2019s such a thing. But th-the boys, even the -- at that age, we were like\neight, nine, 10, they were -- they were out there to beat us. Every day they could catch us\nafter school, they -- they actually waited for us and we had to run. Run for our -- not for\nour lives, because we were not old enough to really do that kind of harm to each other,\nbut we had to run, because we were going to be beaten.",
        "Q: Do you think they knew anything about what that number meant or does it just --\nnumber, Jewish?",
        "A: I think they just thought it was Jewish -- Jewish and -- Jewish connotation, I think,\neven -- even while the war was right there, still hot. And the e-extermination, I\u2019m sure,\nwas known about, but the hatred, I don\u2019t think was wiped out of the people. Or of this\ninnate insensitivity to Jewishness, or anti-Semitism, whatever you want to call it, people\nwere brought up with this sort of thing and even though the war was over and done with,\nit was still there. I think the Germans most probably had -- looking back now, part -- part\nof that is -- as -- as their plan to -- to make -- make their actions seem -- seem plausible,\nreasonable, even likable. So they had this propaganda machine and I\u2019m sure that they\nspread very not nice things about the Jews. So it just carried on.",
        "Q: Did you tell anybody? Did you tell Dr. Kalina about the persecution at school or the\nbeatings?",
        "A: Well, Dr. Kalina and that beatings at school, that did not quite overlap together. Those\nbeatings at school came a little bit later. Dr. Kalina -- I was with him -- out of the -- my\nentire stay in -- in Kosheetza, not very long. I would think maybe about a fifth of the time\nthat I was there. He had to run off because somebody in the organization of his\nadministration had something against him and they spread some news about him -- he\nwas Jewish also and somehow he had to flee. So he left me with his sister, the Maun\nfamily. Edith Maun, here -- that\u2019s Frank Maun. Yes, that\u2019s the name, Frank. The Maun\nfamily. And they had two children, Otto and Beebe and they lived almost a -- just a block\naway or maybe even less than a block away from the school. This is the school that I\u2019m\nreferring to, where these -- where these things took place. And so it was with them, not\nthe Kalinas that -- that this -- these chases and beatings and whatnot took place.",
        "Q: Was it difficult for you to so quickly change, after you had just found people you liked\nin Dr. Kalina and then move onto another family or was that more like the extended\nfamily of --",
        "A: It was -- it -- it -- I -- 1t didn\u2019t seem to affect me. L-Life had so many changes 1n it. I\u2019m\n-- I\u2019m just trying to philosophize, now looking backwards. It did not seem to phase me.\nThings happened quickly, differently and it was just -- 1t was -- I think I just lived more\nor less for the moment, for the very immediate future time -- a day or two. I -- 1t did not\nbother me, no, no.",
        "Q: Do you remember anything else, any particular impressions from -- from that time that\nare important, that have stayed with you?",
        "A: Oh. That\u2019s a four - five year period there, there are lots of things -- lots of things. My\nwife being a school teacher, I\u2019m a little bit of -- of -- sort of into school authority kind of\nthing and I do remember, in -- in -- in Kosheetza, when you misbehaved in school, in\nclass, that was a very -- very difficult thing to deal with. Teachers actually had\npermission -- in fact I think they insisted that they hit you. I do remember, we used to\ncarry our own sticks with us and when we were bad, we\u2019d call -- be called to the front of\nthe room in front of the teacher\u2019s desk and we would hand him the stick and he would\ndish out on our hands, which we extended, you know one, two or whatever the\npunishment was. And I do remember that -- that as boys we had the discussion -- did we\nbring thick sticks or very thin sticks? Because the thin sticks would sting and the thick s-\nsticks would sort of, you know, just hit you flat. But I must say that order was maintained\nin the school. There was none of this that you hear today, in 1997, where you -- where a\nteacher looks at a kid the wrong way and the teacher runs -- and the -- and the child runs\nhome to his parents, then the parents come to school and the teacher\u2019s in big trouble and\nso 1s the administration in big trouble. This is like -- it\u2019s so absurd to me, that things like\nthis happen today and when I think of what happened then. And nobody really -- was\nreally hurt by this -- by this punishments. It was -- 1t was scolding 1n a way that kids\nunderstood, I think, at the time. And that\u2019s one of the things I do remember of the\nschools.",
        "Q: So, for you the punishment in school was more -- yo-you took it to be an -- an act of\njust normal discipline in certain ways --",
        "A: Oh, absolutely, after --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] it did not bring -- it did not make -- you did not make a connection to\nmistreatment in your earlier life in any way\u201d?",
        "A: No, no and in fact it was -- there was a ca -- it was almost an orderly thing to be\nhappening, just to be hit and then be told to go back to your seat and behave, rather than\nbeing shot and never getting up again. I mean, you were taken care of properly, in a way,\nproperly. Schooling, since -- since we\u2019re on the subject of schooling, the last two years\nthat I was in Czechoslovakia, in Kosheetza, the Russians began to take hold and we had\nto take Russian language as a -- as a language, that was a re-requ-requirement that we all\nhad to do. And so I learned the Russian alphabet, we -- this 1s -- this was a must, we had\nto do all this. Things that I didn\u2019t want to do in school, that was one of them. Another\nthing that sort of -- I had trouble with in school was religious instruction. We had priests\ngiving us instructions and they even took us to -- to church many times. I don\u2019t know\nhow, but I always ended up at the end of the line and many times I didn\u2019t quite make it\ninto the church itself, but I do remember having to have to go at times and crossing\nmyself. Which was -- I know not the right thing for me to do. Don\u2019t ask me how I knew,\nbut I knew this wasn\u2019t the right thing for me to do. But it happened.",
        "Q: Were there aspects of it that you liked?",
        "A: Hm. That\u2019s a very interesting question. I -- I\u2019ve never focused on anything that I liked\nin school, other than I did enjoy playing soccer, yes. Yes, we did -- we did devise games\nof soccer and that was -- that was a very -- that was very exciting for me, but it was also,\nit was -- it sort of got all that extra energy out of me. When you were able to run -- yeah,\nrunning was always -- seemed to be the thing I\u2019ve been doing, either to good things or to\nbad things or for bad things. Yes, playing soccer was a very enjoyable kind of a activity\nin school -- school grounds or away, because they were lot -- we were not far from fields\n-- from out of town, anywhere you were in Kosheetza at the time, so we pl -- wherever\nwe could, we set up a soccer thing.",
        "Q: Did you have any relatives anywhere who were looking for you in the meantime while\nyou were there?",
        "A: Well, it seems yes, I\u2019ve had some relatives left in Germany. They were looking for me\n-- this is my father\u2019s brother. And there were other relatives alive, but I don\u2019t think they\nwere actively looking to -- to -- to get me -- to get a hold of me. My -- my mother had a\nsister alive in London, so I had a cousin there and an uncle. And my -- the Slotkins were\nnot my relatives yet, but I have a feeling they were starting to look for me, too. They\nwere looking for me, I think, much before I even heard of it, because I think that Irene,\nmy twin, when she told them that she had had a brother, not knowing whether he\u2019s alive\nor not alive, I think they started to wonder about it and they being the kind of people that\nthey are, I think they made some inquiries about tt.",
        "Q: Before we go ahead with your life, could you just tell us very briefly what happened\nin the meantime to Irene, because wh-where was she?",
        "A: Well, after liberation, I know now that she was taken to -- to Poland to live with a\nfamily and as the years go by now and we start to hear about some of her experiences,\nand I\u2019m going back only to 1985, because before then, Irene and I never talked about it --\nand I mean never. [ringing]",
        "Q: We will stop the tape. -- \u201885.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: So you just mentioned that you never talked to Irene about the -- both of your\nexperiences until 1985.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. So then slowly, in 1985, she let us know, even though we knew -- I\nknew from records that she had been taken into Poland and she spent some very, very\nunpleasant, indeterminate num-number of months with a Polish family that -- right now I\ncan almost surely say abused her, in terms of her being a child who was taken into a\nhome to be taken care of. I think she was more like a servant, made to do things. Some of\nthe things that she tells me are -- later on were to -- were to really go back, return to the\nsite of Auschwitz and -- and hunt for the -- for some valuables in terms of gold -- gold\nteeth or what -- whatever. But not -- not the kind of home that you would expect a child\nwould get. So -- and the stories that she has, I think are locked in her and perhaps one day\nPll find out myself, more about it. But then -- then she was rescued from there by -- by a\nrescue organization -- rescue child organization from United States, that actually made it\na point, because they knew that a lot of the Polish families would grab -- grab children\nand a lot of the Polish had hidden children that really didn\u2019t belong to them, but -- they\nwere Jewish children and this being a Jewish oriented organization, they wanted to\nextricate the Jewish children from there and they went into a lot of trouble in terms of\nchecking birth records, birth certificates and so on. And when something didn\u2019t quite\nmatch up in a family, they would know that they had a Jewish child and they took the\nJewish child out. And from there she went to -- when she was taken out, she was taken --\nas far as I know, to -- to France, to an orphanage in France.",
        "Q: This organization was rescue children?",
        "A: Rescue child. Herbert Tenzer was an active member. There\u2019s a rabbi that lives and\nstill -- Rabbi Fourhand, that I\u2019ve met here on the West Side -- I\u2019ve gone to his little\nsynagogue a few times, he was also very active and he remembered me and he even has a\npicture of us kids and he\u2019s a very sweet man and obviously there were a lot of people\ninvolved in this organization and this is how Irene got here.",
        "Q: How did your two lives come together again, how did you meet again?",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m living in -- in the -- with Maun family in -- in -- in Kosheetza, and I have to\njust mention a few things about them. Mrs. Maun, Edith Maun was a -- was a wonderful\nwoman. She somehow had the understanding of what a boy should be or what a boy\nwould like and there in that home, I first saw candles -- Friday night candles. And from\nthat home I was also, for the first time taking in -- taken into a synagogue. I don\u2019t know if\nit was Orthodox -- it most probably was, cause Conservative and Reform were not born\nyet -- I don\u2019t believe were being practiced publicly in the little town of Kosheetza. And I\nremember being there on holidays, being dressed special. Not being inside the synagogue\nall that much, but I do remember having a lot of fights with the boys outside in the\ncourtyard, we were throwing the chestnuts at ea -- at each other. But Mrs. Maun, getting\nback to her, cause I -- I have to just say some things about her that she understood so\nwell. She knew that I wanted to play -- be a boy, be a real boy. And she managed\nsomehow to -- to -- to get a bicycle for me. And it wasn\u2019t a child\u2019s bicycle, was a man\u2019s\nbicycle and I was smaller than a normal child, even for my age. So, to learn to ride this\nthing -- I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever seen a child riding a man\u2019s bicycle. The foot goes\nunderneath the bar and holding on for dear life and you\u2019re peddling just totally sideways,\nbut I managed to do it and she knew that this was important to me and she -- she -- she\ntrained me and she made me learn how to do this and I did it and I was very proud of it.\nWith her and her other children, I also went ice skating on the river, where -- when it was\nfrozen. And it -- 1t was a river, I knew that, because many times you could see the water\nflowing underneath, perhaps the ice wasn\u2019t thick enough for us, but we went on it\nanyway. What I do remember about the ice skates was that you would just screw these\nthings onto your normal regular shoes, because we didn\u2019t have special shoes for skating,\nwe just -- those were our -- our shoes and we just forced them onto our feet and there was\na special key and they would just lock onto the shoes and we\u2019d be skating. I don\u2019t think I\never told that story to anyone, but it\u2019s wa -- some of the things I remember from there.\nAlso, somewhere along the line, after this bicycle episode, somebody obtained for me, a\nvery fancy -- they call it a jek -- there\u2019s a kolabeshka, but I think it\u2019s a -- I don\u2019t even\nknow what the English word for it is here. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s some wheels, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a platform, a\nwheel on the back and the front and then there\u2019s a stand, what do you call that, a -- I\u2019m at\na loss, totally at a loss. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s got a wheel on the front, wheel on the back and\nhandlebars coming out from the bottom of it.",
        "Q: Is it a scooter-type?",
        "A: It\u2019s like a scooter kind of a thing.",
        "Q: Did you push with one foot?",
        "A: One foot, yes. You push with one foot. But this was a very fancy model, so I suspect\nsomehow America had something to do with it, because it had a spring on the back,\nspring on the front and a brake on -- in the back, which you just press and it would just\nsort of hold against the rear wheel. That turned out to be my means of locomotion in -- in\n-- in Kosheetza. And I was seen through the streets, I mean I was really fast with -- at\nleast I thought I was very fast, I was -- was my -- my vehicle to -- my escape wagon, my\nlittle scooter. Was red, chrome, beautiful little thing.",
        "Q: So that was the first time that you could really play and -- and be a boy.",
        "A: Probably. Probably the first time, probably the first time. And thanks to Mrs. Maun, I\nhave to give her that credit, she -- she knew that I needed this -- something and 1-1t was\nwonderful. She -- she -- she gave it to me, it was wonderful.",
        "Q: I would like to stop here, this is the end of tape one, side A.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nRene Slotkin. This is tape number one, side B. I would like you to say a little bit more\nabout the two children in the Maun family. Did you get along together well, or was there\nsome jealousy on their part, maybe or -- what was the -- the feeling?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. They were younger than I, much younger and I could tell that from\nthe pictures even now. So we didn\u2019t really play as equals. We played as children would\nplay with each other, living in the same home. I do remember Otto being sort of a -- he\nwasn\u2019t as sports oriented and as outgoing and -- and as devilish as I was. He wouldn\u2019t --\nnever try that bicycle that I had tried and there were a lot of things that he wouldn\u2019t do.\nSo that factor and the fact that he was much younger, didn\u2019t allow us to really play a lot\ntogether. And then there was Beebe, she was a little baby girl and -- what does a te -- nine\nyear old, 10 year old have to do with a baby girl? Nothing. So there wasn\u2019t much there,\nbut duf -- I did feel a real family there, because Mr. Maun was a -- he\u2019s a very quiet but\nvery strong man. He was a dental technician, yes. And Mrs. Maun was an outspoken\nlady, but very strong also and together they -- they ruled this family and I felt some\nstructure, real structure there.",
        "Q: But eventually you did meet Irene again and you were still thinking [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, it was while I lived with them, that we start to get communiqu\u00e9s from -- from\nthe States, that there were people looking for me. And also, at the same time, we were\nsomehow connected to the people in -- to my uncle in Germany. And there was sort of\ntalk, letting it known -- be known that I might be going to -- to one of these places, that\nI'd be leaving them. And I -- there wa -- it was just talk and it didn\u2019t really phase me one\nway or the other, it was just talk. The -- the first thing that did happen, though as -- as a\nmovement away from the Maun family -- at one point in time, I do remember going with\n-- I\u2019m not quite sure now whether it was both of them or just one of them, the parents --\nthey were taking me to the -- to the border of Czechoslovakia and Germany, where I was\nto be met and taken to Germany. But we got to the border and somehow it never\nhappened. We came back. I suspect now, from what I can gather, that at the same time,\nthe Slotkin\u2019s somehow came on the scene and they, at this point had Irene, who was my\ntwin sister and I guess it seemed much more sensible to try and unite the two twins into a\nhome or just unite them, rather than keep them apart. So I came back into\nCzechoslovakia, back -- I mean I went back to Kosheetza with the Maun\u2019s and there we\nwaited until some move was made by the Slotkin\u2019s. And that -- that this happened, it\nhappened -- they had sent a Mr. Enright, who I think on his own right worked for -- for\nthe children, possibly for this organization, but he was specifically sent out to see if he\ncould find me. And he spent quite a few months -- over a year I think, maybe even two\nyears, looking for me until I was located. But there are lots of coincidences that I\u2019d like to\nmention -- I should mention -- that happened, which made this possible. In -- in 1947,\nLife Magazine ran an issue which depicted my twin sister Irene as sort of a poster girl\nfrom -- from France, with a boy, Charles Karro and somehow th-their publicity was to\nraise funds for this organization and for the orphanage and for the children\u2019s welfare care.\nThe Slotkins somehow got a hold of Irene, cause they were actively involved in helping\nwar orphans and they were very close friends to Herbert Tenzer also, who lived 1n th -- in\nthe same area that they lived in. And Irene came -- came to them. And that wasn\u2019t a --\nquick as I make it sound, she went through a couple of homes, but she ended up with\nthem and she told them that she had a brother somewhere. And so they started to look for\nme, realizing, I guess the importance -- as I think as a father now -- grandfather, I would\ndo the same thing -- I -- I -- I -- if I knew that I had in possession a child who had a twin,\nespecially from -- from that kind of a background, I would see if I -- if I could do\nsomething, especially since they were able to do this. So they started looking for me.\nNow the Life Magazine that I mentioned before, this Life Magazine was obviously read\nby more than just the United States, but it -- 1t was read by people in Europe and in Israel,\nwhere Dr. Kalina was at the time. He saw the article and he realized that Irene Guttman,\nwho was mentioned, I think, in the article as Guttman, maybe even Renata, I\u2019m not sure\nnow. Renata or Irene, but Guttman was the -- was the name which I was under and the\ntwin story and all that. So he made the connection and he said, \u201cI have this twin, I have\nthe brother. I know where the brother 1s.\u201d So contacts were made and I was located in\nKosheetza and then came the -- the red tape of getting me out, getting a -- I -- I look at it\nnow and I laughing, I wa -- that little orphan, took them two years to get me out and even\nonce I got here, I still had to go back once -- back into Germany, but that -- that\u2019s just a\nside issue of mine. But it took two years of red tape to get me out. I must say that in the\ntime I spent in getting ready for it and the travel and -- and in France and -- I went to\nschool in Switzerland. Went -- had to go to Frankfort and then once I got here, I had --\nwas returned back to Frankfort again. Was a red tape kind of a thing, I had to appear just\nfor a weekend in Frankfort and then come back. But each one of these is -- is a little story\nby itself. My s -- my stay in France, my -- my trip to France. My stay in -- in Switzerland.\nThey\u2019re all little stories and I\u2019ll be glad to tell you if you\u2019d like to hear about it.",
        "Q: Let me ask you one question --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- before we -- I would like to hear those -- those stories.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Why was it so difficult? Was it because Czechoslovakia then was under Communist\nrule or how -- do you know now\u201d?",
        "A: I don\u2019t really know why. That could have been it, possibly because I was a Jewish\ndisplaced child and I was oriented to go or my -- the easiest way to get me out was to get\nme -- get me a visa to the newly created state of Israel. And since I was headed for Israel,\nAmerica was not the way to go. It wa -- would have been a stopover, but it wasn\u2019t the\nfinal destination, so the -- these things didn\u2019t quite match, so they had to make them\nmatch. I think that\u2019s what made it so difficult. There are other difficulties too. They\nweren\u2019t legal, political maneuvers, but I -- I think that\u2019s truly -- the Mauns really cared\nfor me. I mean I -- I think I spent -- I ha -- \u2019'm guessing, but I think I spent at least three\nyears with them. And I think that, in that time frame, I could see me falling in love with a\nchild that I took care of three years, even if the child wasn\u2019t the best child in the world.\nWhich I\u2019m sure I wasn\u2019t, but I guess I was cute enough, judging from the pictures. I\nseemed to get along and obviously she showered me -- they showered me with their --\nwith their caring and I -- I remembered it\u2019s -- obviously there was a good relationship. I\nmean, so there are other things in play, but I think they realize that -- that my place would\nbe -- I'll be better off in the long run with my sister in America. So, that was one issue. I -\n- | think that the Kalinas, who were in a -- who made the connection and originally took\nme out of the orphanage also weren\u2019t quite sure whether to send me into this unknown\nand they had some say, because I was staying with their sister. So, I guess there was a\nlittle bit of negotiation going on there, on -- on an -- on an adult level, which I wasn\u2019t\nprivy to, so I -- I really can\u2019t tell you about that. As far as I was -- I was ready to go. I had\nsome things which I unfortunately had to leave behind. I was an avid book reader and if I\nremember correctly, I don\u2019t think there were any libraries in Kosheetza, so whenever I\nwanted a book, I had to save for it and I had to buy it. So they became my personal\npossessions and I had quite a few of them and there were a few that -- they were\nAmerican, or at least you\u2019d recognize them. James Fenimore Cooper, \u201cThe Last of the\nMohicans\u201d was one of the books that I had translated -- that was translated into -- into\nSlovak and I was able to read that, so I was totally familiar with -- with the story. There\nwas one word I -- that comes to mind, which I could never understand in -- in the west, it\nwas greenhorn. The word greenhorn, I -- I just didn\u2019t know what it was. I know it wasn\u2019t\na complimentary sort of a thing, but I could never understand it until I came to the States\nmany, many years later, I learned what the true meaning of the word greenhorn was.\nThere were other books that I loved. Jules Verne was my -- one of my favorite authors,\nscience fiction. There\u2019s another man, Carrol May. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s -- hits anybody,\nbut I mentioned it to a few people and apparently it hasn\u2019t, but I read some of his books.\n\u201cRobinson Crusoe\u201d was also one of my most favorite books.",

        "A: Carl -- Carl May, yeah so maybe that\u2019s -- that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about, but then I --\nthese we -- these books, these were my treasures and I was told that I couldn\u2019t really take\nthem with me. I remember I could take only very little. And I don\u2019t -- can\u2019t understand\nwhy, but I -- I didn\u2019t even have a suitcase to take, I only had a briefcase that I could fill\nup and the books were not the most important thing, even though I tried. I wanted to\nreally take some books with me, but it just didn\u2019t go. So that was one of my losses. Took\nawhile to get used to.",
        "Q: So you made little excursions of sorts, into Switzerland and into France. Why and\nwhat happened?",
        "A: Right. Well, my first -- when I first left Czechoslovakia, it was -- I was alone on a\nplane to Paris. I was met by Mr. Enright -- his secretary, a lady, don\u2019t remember her\nname, but Mr. Enright played a real big role in my life for the next -- oh, at least half a\nyear. He -- we -- we were in Paris together. I remember we stayed at the Grand Hotel and\nnow we were sort of closer to the Slotkins, away from the Mauns and I\u2019Il never forget the\nfirst ttme they made a telephone connection with the Slotkins, I -- I hid under the bed. I\ndidn\u2019t want to somehow respond or talk, even though I knew about them, I knew who\nthey were. I mean, didn\u2019t know about them, but I knew they were the Slotkins, who --\nwhere my sister was. But I was just totally shaken up by this. I\u2019m not even sure whether I\ntalked to them that one time. But we lived in Switzerland together and -- I mean in -- in\nParis together and there he would carry on during the day, doing his thing, whatever he\nhad to do to get clearances for me and whatnot. And he engaged a teacher for me at the\ntime, to teach me -- start teaching me Slovak. And part of the education was to go ahead\nand see as many foreign movies -- American movies, also English movies, so I would get\nused to -- I\u2019m sorry, I have to take all that back, not to teach me Slovak, to teach me\nEnglish. And part of this whole thing was to take me to see English movies. And one of\nthe first movies that I remember was \u201cLassie Come Back.\u201d Elizabeth Taylor, she was a\ngirl at the time, a very beautiful girl, blue eyes, black hair, white skin. And there was this\nbeautiful black horse. No, no, that\u2019s \u201cBlack Beauty\u2019, that\u2019s another one that I saw. But\n\u201cLassie\u201d was the first one. Also, there were cowboy movies I saw -- if I can try to\nremember some of those old names. That was way before Hopalong Cassidy came on the\nscene, it was -- oh, maybe I\u2019ll remember later. But that was part of it, Laurel and Hardy\nwas certainly part of it. Abbott and Costello. These were movies I went to see, just to get\nthe feel of the language and -- and with the help of this tutor, I sort of somehow got\nmyself started in English. I don\u2019t know how -- what I really achieved other than I was\nexposed to it. It seemed that though, that Mr. Enright didn\u2019t have much luck in getting\nwhatever papers were necessary to get me over here right away, so -- there was -- and he\ncouldn\u2019t spend any more time or something like that, so I had to be brought somewhere,\nput away somewhere -- who to leave we -- me with. So it was decided to send me to -- to\nSwitzerland, to a boarding school. Institute Usher, in Balaban, which was Jewish oriented\nI\u2019m sure, because the headmaster of the school had a beard and a yarmulke and I do\nremember Friday night services, now that I think about it and we always stood up to La\nhoda di lacross kallor, which is one of the prayers that we say in our Friday nights also,\nbut we sit down, where we always stood there. Now I know why I stand. I always stand,\nfor some reason, La hoda di lacross kallor, sa -- sa -- about two pages responsive kind of\nreading on Friday night. But most people sit down. I always stand. There are a few other\npeople that stand, but now I know where I got it from. They always stood over there.\nThat was Switzerland. And that was a -- that was a really, really wonderful experience. I\nwent skiing there. I do remember going skiing. We would get on to buses, which would\ntake us, even though it was a rainy, cloudy day, would take -- they would -- the buses\nwould take us into the mountains, above the clouds, into bright blue skies and sunshine\nand we would ski. The school also has other -- lots of good memories. At this point, I had\nthe funds, now I had the backer -- a rich backer in America, my sister and her -- her\nfuture adoptive parents. So I had some money, I had some credit, come to think of it, it\nwasn\u2019t even money, I had credit at the school office where I could buy candy. I\nremember it was a very specific kind of a marshmallow chocolate covered candy, very\ndelicious. One other thing about the school, which I remember very, very clearly. We\nlived in a dorm -- in dormitory -- rooms and every morning we went to the showers in\nanother building, while it was still dark and cold sometimes -- very, very cold. So we ran\nthrough whatever yard there was in our nightclothes and into these showers, which were\nsomehow automatically regulated. You get into them -- they lasted only so long, the\nwater started from lukewarm to warm and then it slowly start to cool. So you had to do\nyour thing. You had to get soaped up and you had to get clean and still try and enjoy\nsome of the warmth that was left after you\u2019ve done what you had to do. But, that it ran\ncold and if you were brave enough, you stayed in. And it turned out to be a lot of kids did\nstay in, most of us did. And it sort of -- it was a very healthy thing to do, because I don\u2019t\never remember being sick. None of them ever got sick and we ran wet -- half wet into our\n-- into our rooms from -- from the bathhouse. I do -- that was something I remember\nagain about my stay in Switzerland. There I learned also -- there they put me on a\nprogram to learn Hebrew. So I started writing, copying things in Hebrew, even though I\nhad no idea what I was -- what I was saying, but writing, copying things in Hebrew and\ntrying to pronounce some of the things, Hebrew started then for me.",
        "Q: How many languages did you -- did you learn by then in this -- in a rudimentary\nform? At least Slova -- Czech?",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m sure that my parents spoke German to one another. Czech will be the other.\nOh definitely, Czech definitely. As a matter of fact, when I -- when I came to the States, I\ndid manage to sneak out one book -- yes, I had one book called \u201cOatsa lubby luge.\u201d I\ndon\u2019t even remember what it -- actual -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a ray, some metallic ray, was a ship of\nsome kind. But I did my first book report on a -- in the United States, on a book that I\nread in Czech and I guess the teacher trusted me that I wasn\u2019t going to distort the story\ntoo much and I wrote a book report on it, in English for my first school book report here.\nSo, Czechoslo -- Czech was the other language, Hebrew, of course, start to come in very\nstrong and English, which I had to communicate in. And Russian, which I took in -- in --\nin -- in Czechoslovakia and Kosheetza, which I had to take. So -- and whatever language\nwas spoken in -- in Auschwitz, which was many, many languages. They\u2019 re --",
        "Q: So five -- five languages? [inaudible]",
        "A: Probably -- posht -- at least five languages.",
        "Q: So what happened after Switzerland?",
        "A: Switzerland was my last stop, I think, before I came here. On the way, we went back\nto -- to Paris, I think that\u2019s where we boarded a plane to come to the United States. Was a\nbig, big plane. I think it was the double-decker -- propeller driven plane, but it was a\ndouble decker, was one of the first. And we landed at Idlewild Airport, which is now\nKennedy Airport. Idlewild Airport was nothing but a long Quonset hut with -- with dirt\non the ground and you just had sections which designated the different airlines. I\nremember the night, 1t was a night -- March -- March 29th, 1950 and my mother came to\npick me up -- my mother -- Mrs. Mey -- Mrs. Dinah Slotkin. It comes very easy to say\nmy mother to her. And came with Mr. Enright and it was evening, it was raining -- misty\nrain. And I don\u2019t think I saw my sister that evening, yet, because it was -- must have been\ntoo late, she must have been asleep already and I remember that we were told to sleep in\nthe master bedroom and M-Mr. Enright, like we slept in the hotels, he slept in one bed, I\nslept in the other bed and the following morning I met my sister in front of the house and\nno words were spoken, none. Just looked at each other. I knew who she was, she knew\nwho I was, that was it. We were reunited in 1950, in Orange, Long Island, New York.",
        "Q: Had you communicated before with each other in some way until you -- until you\nmet?",
        "A: We wrote some letters, but th-they were newsy kind of things. Well, as I said, we truly\ncommunicated -- we didn\u2019t even communicate truly til 1985, when we touched our\nparents, our backgrounds, our past. We communicate yes, superficially, on the level that,\nyou know, what -- where you going, what are you doing. We went to the same school\ntogether. We -- we grew up together, we took dance lessons together, we -- we ate at the\nsame table f -- we had the same family, but truly, truly, to find out what she\u2019s really,\nreally thinking, what really went on, we -- we didn\u2019t start to really do until 1985 in\nJerusalem.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back to the beginning of a new family. The Slotkins, what -- what was the --\nthat family like? What was the house? Do you remember the first time you felt really at\nhome there?",
        "A: Well, they were -- the Slotkins were fairly well-to-do, I guess, so they had a home. I\nhad my own room, which was different than the -- what I\u2019ve had before, although I had\nprivacy in -- in the slo -- in the Maun house. They -- they recognize that I needed the\nprivacy. Here I had my own bedroom, my own furniture, my own desk, my own chair.\nOne of the first things that they did was to get me a bicycle. Again bicycle. Pretty\nimportant, I guess, to a -- to a 12 year old. And they were giving me everything that they\nthought I didn\u2019t have -- physically, materially. I think that they -- they both were very\nintelligent people. They gave me everything they knew how to give me. How -- what --\ntheir best of ability, they gave me whatever they could. Whether they were like real\nparents -- because this question I ask myself, Pll never know. I\u2019ll never know what it\u2019s\nlike to really have a real parent. What do you owe a real parent? What sort of honor you\nowe a parent when they\u2019re -- when you know that they\u2019re not yours, really, when you\nmeet them first when you\u2019re 12 years old or when you -- when you know that they\u2019re\nyour real blood? That\u2019s the question I -- it\u2019s a question. It\u20191l remain a question, I don\u2019t\nknow. I don\u2019t imagine it\u2019s the same thing, because I -- otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be asking\nwhy -- all these questions. So there must be some difference, but I -- I must say that they\ndid everything to their maximum ability -- capability to make us happy, even though I\nthink that -- looking back now, that they made some mistakes, but the -- for example, at\none point, German government was -- was ready or somehow in the news to -- to -- they\nwere ready to give some reparation to -- some financial aid to -- or -- or -- make some\nreparations to Holocaust victims. And yet -- or even -- but they didn\u2019t want to have\nanything to do with it, they totally shielded us from the fact, protected us. They didn\u2019t\nwant us to associate the facts that we had that sort of a background and -- they just didn\u2019t\nwant to. There were people who wanted to write books about, very famous Jewish\nauthor, escapes my -- my memory right now, but he wanted to write a book about us. But\nthey didn\u2019t want to dig up any of the old memories and they totally shielded Irene and\nmyself from anything. So they sign -- signed away some of the rights that we might have\nhad and I think that was a mistake, in a sense, because sooner or later, we would grow up\nand we did grow up and we do question these things and -- and we feel that we have a\nresponsibility to our past and therefore to the future. And we have a responsibility to our\nown children and these things should be known. It\u2019s not something to hide, to be\nashamed of. It happened. It happened and -- and you have to admit it that it happened and\nwe have to bring it to the forefront if you want to learn something from it. So, I think\nthey made a big mistake in that -- in that sense.",
        "Q: So that was a subject matter that was sort of taboo in -- in -- in the Slotkin house?\nAnd it was also not talked about between you and Irene at all?",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: Did you talk to others? You went to school, right?",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Did you talk to -- what kind of education, I guess, did you have and did you talk to\nyour new friends or to schoolmates about this?",
        "A: Well, I -- I -- I -- we did go to Hebrew school, Yeshiva schools. My sister, as I recall,\ncovered her number with a cosmetic at all times. It was not talked about. I -- I don\u2019t think\nthe Jewish community on the whole was ready to even talk about it. They were still in a\nstate of shock. I mean historically speaking, it just happened and -- and they were not\nready to talk about it or to discuss it and I think that, in the very beginning, my sister\nmight have even felt ashamed. Incredible as that may seem. I -- I think I felt a little bit of\nthat, too. I did not always expose my number freely. It was always a sign of a Jew and in\n-- the sign of a Jew in Europe was not a good sign, it\u2019s something to -- a low sign,\nsomething to be ashamed of. It wasn\u2019t something that you were proud of. Today I -- I\u2019m\nvery proud of it and I feel very lucky that I\u2019m a survivor of this thing. But at that time, it -\n- it was not. So in school, I think the teachers knew about us. I think the community knew\nabout us. But very few really discussed it with us. I think they treated us gently because\nof it, but I don\u2019t -- nobody ever talked about it, it was not -- 1t was a taboo subject and I\nthink Slotkins most probably made a contribution to that, but they were just like the rest\nof the people. They would not want to talk about -- this 1s something -- let\u2019s -- let\u2019s --\nlet\u2019s give them what they missed, let\u2019s shield them, let\u2019s -- let\u2019s forget about it. And I\nthink a lot of parents did this to their children that were linked closely to the Holocaust. I\nthink they did it to their offsprings. Why should they -- why should they suffer, why\nshould they know about this? Just looking back, I -- I don\u2019t think that was exactly the\nright thing, but it was understandable.",
        "Q: Did you feel at the time, I mean wh -- you were now becoming a teenager, getting to\nbe 14 - 15 years old, did you feel that you fit in? Did you feel that you were truly\nAmericanized, slowly, or was -- were there other feelings that were more complex,\ndifficult?",
        "A: No, I -- I -- I felt -- I had no trouble. I really had no trouble getting to like the\nAmerican things. The television -- I played basketball -- I was high school basketball, I\nlearned to drive the day I turned 16. I had always a car that I could borrow from my\nmother or my father. I didn\u2019t have my own car, but I mean I could always borrow a car\nand there were parties and I was a very social and outgoing -- it wasn\u2019t though, with --\nwith the public school crowd, it was with the -- the Jewish crowd. But that Jewish crowd\nwasn\u2019t anywhere -- the Yeshiva crowd wasn\u2019t anywhere near as observant as -- as the\nJewish Yeshivas are today. In other words, the Jewish high school then, there was\nnothing -- nobody thought very badly about having dance classes -- social learning, how\nto do social dancing with boys and girls together and in those days social dancing meant\ntouching one another. Now this I think would be totally looked upon as a no-no in\ntoday\u2019s age in -- in the high school -- Yeshiva high school. Because I know my -- my\ndaughter goes to a high school -- a girl\u2019s high school. [telephone ringing]",
        "Q: We will stop the tape for a minute. This 1s the end of tape one, side B, of the interview\nwith Rene Slotkin.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nRene Slotkin. This is tape number two, side A. And we just talked about the different\natmosphere at the Jewish schools then and today. Maybe you can pick up on -- you talked\nabout dancing and touching.",
        "A: Yeah, dancing would have been a real, real difference that I recall. We did sort of\nhave classes with the girls. We did social things with the girls, we attended parties.\nDating, in my circles was a allowed thing. Today in -- in -- in the Jewish world, Jewish\nhigh schools, even though boys and girls have contact, it\u2019s not for the purpose of dating\nand having fun with each other. Because that is not really looked upon as a -- as a serious\nrelationship which will go anywhere, at this point. I mean, how far can it go when you\u2019re\n15 - 16 years old? So, there\u2019s -- I think, a lot of wisdom in what goes on in -- in -- in --\nand obviously my background is showing -- in -- in what the Yeshiva world of today\nexpects from their kids and I -- I agree with it 100 percent. But I think at the time, I fit in\nvery well. I think looking back now and having met survivors over the years, I think --\nmyself personally -- I\u2019m not even going to speak for Irene, but I think my thinking and I\nturn out to be as -- as normal, if there is such a thing as normal, as one could be. Much\nmore so than some of the others that I\u2019ve met and I\u2019ve met most of them, especially in\nIsrael in 1985, when we had a -- a convention to have a mock trial for Dr. Mengele and I\nmet -- were twins from all over the world and I must say that maybe five percent are what\nI would consider normal at the time. But again, I\u2019m speaking for myself and how normal\nam I? So I think my adjustment to American life was -- was -- was easy.",
        "Q: Specifically, what schools did you go to?",
        "A: I started out in the Hebrew Institute of Long Island. This is in Far Rockaway. They\nthen, as we finished the eighth grade, they built a high school and so I was the first class\nof that Hebrew Institute High School. And it was a very small school, because we were\nthe first class and there were, I think, only 11 of us, inc -- my sister was one of them --\nfirst senior class. But that was a good thing, because we were always the seniors, we were\nalways the eldest. And we got to do everything that needed to be done for high school.\nWe always managed to play basketball. We were the first string. I mean, we played\nagainst seniors I remember distinctly, in the Yeshiva High School Leagues and we were\ntrampled. But we had a good time. We had all the American things that the other high\nschools had. We had a basketball team, we had a coach, we had uniforms. We had\ncheerleaders. My -- Irene was a cheerleader. She had a cheerleaders uniform on. She was\ndancing around, she was a cheerleader. And it was -- it was a fun time, it was a easy time.\nIt was -- no, it wasn\u2019t easy, because we were growing up and growing up, I guess, is not\nan easy thing to do. You\u2019re facing the future and here I was, in a -- what seemed the lap\nof luxury. What do I have to worry about? I remember my father saying, \u201cYou have to\npick a profession. You have to become a professional.\u201d And I was fighting it. \u201cWhat do I\nhave to do this for?\u201d I remember. \u201cI don\u2019t have to be a professional. I have -- we have\neverything we need. What do I have to be a professional for?\u201d So it was -- 1t was growing\nup, I think with the similar problems that all of America grows up. It was not -- it was\nonly clouded in the back scene by the fact where we came from. And I guess my parents\nkept that in mind. I didn\u2019t really focus on it. I was too busy having a good time.",
        "Q: So what kind of professional did you become, then?",
        "A: I did not become a professional. I won and maybe lost. Well, the -- the problem was\nthat -- again, here I have to -- and I hope I\u2019m not faulting, pointing at my father, but he --\nto him professional meant you were a doctor, a lawyer or an accountant. That\u2019s it. I\nwould have loved to have become a math teacher. But that wasn\u2019t the big three. So I\nsettled for things in between. Accounting courses, this kind of courses, business, bachelor\nof this and -- so I never be -- really became a professional. But I was -- I was having a\ngood time. Even while in college, I was having a good time. Whereas my sister was a\nstudent. I\u2019m sure that she would agree now, that she should have maybe had a little bit\nmore fun than be a student, but here we were, living in the same house, twins, somewhat\nsimilar backgrounds, yet, because of who she was -- and maybe she was -- she was shyer,\nmore introverted. She would turn to her books for -- to occupy her time, study. That\u2019s\nhow she gained her strength. Whereas I got my strength through dating, playing ball and\ndoing all the things that young teenagers do.",
        "Q: Did you have trouble at all to have intimate relationships with -- with people, period?\nDid you have close friends? Was it difficult to have intimate relationships with girls?",
        "A: I -- I -- no, I never had any trouble with people. I\u2019ve always had close friends, both\nsexes. Girls -- very close girlfriend, not the kind that you take on a date on, but very close\nfriend. And I had very close boy friends. No, I -- I never had any trouble. I -- I consider\nmyself -- even today I consider myself a very personable, friendly sort of a chap.",
        "Q: What happened after college?",
        "A: Well, after college -- this was like 1958 - \u201859. \u201859 is more I think the year. There was a\nwar on that the United States was involved in and th-the draft was still in full swing. And\nI was seriously seeing a girl. I was, I think 21. 20 - 21, something like that. And my life at\nhome, I think because of this friction of, \u201cYou will be a professional or it\u2019s not going to\nwork for you too well.\u201d I -- I have to admit as an -- as an ol-older person, like 19, older\nteenager, there -- there was friction in the house, because -- and I think that\u2019s a normal\nkind of a thing, I think kids want to -- tend to get up and do their own thing and -- and f-\nfly out on their own. I -- I -- I was married. I got married to this girl, despite objections of\nmy parents. Now, she came from the same community, but not on the same observant\nlevel as I was. Her father was an attorney. I mean, intelligent people, but they were just\nnot on the same observant level. Now this was very important to my -- my family, my --\nthe Slotkins. I -- I didn\u2019t realize -- I don\u2019t realize until today how important something\nlike that really is to parents. But I also know -- and I think he realized also, that there\u2019s\nnot all that much that he could do -- if these two young people wanted to get married,\nthey were going to do it. So, 1t happened, with everybody\u2019s blessings and we were\nmarried. But, at that same time, I was -- I notice -- I -- I was notified by the draft that my\nturn had come and at the time, I think the only way you could be excused, exempt from\nservice was if -- if your wife was pregnant, you were about to become a father, or some\nof the other usual things. If you were the sole caretaker of somebody, your family,\nwhatnot. But none of these things applied to me, so they were going to draft me for two\nyears, send me over somewhere and -- to fight in a war. Now, when I told my family\nabout this and my friends, they all said, \u201cYou? In a war? At this point in your life? What\nare you -- there\u2019s no way -- no way you can go. There\u2019s no way they\u2019 ll take you if you\neven -- if you tell them what your background is and that you can\u2019t do it.\u201d But I -- I never\n-- I listened to what they said, but I never took advantage of that -- sort of -- of that\nsituation, 1n -- in the sense that I would use it as an excuse. I didn\u2019t want to go into a war\nor anything like that, either. To me, at the time, the only thing that was really worth dying\nfor, was maybe the Jewish state. But I -- I wasn\u2019t going to fight the United States -- I\nwasn\u2019t going to fight being inducted or anything like that on the basis of -- that \u2019ma\nsurvivor from Auschwitz and I have this and I have bad this when I really didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t\nwant to go, but I -- I was going to submit to it. So I did the next best thing, I joined a six\nmonths -- which for me was the best thing -- I joined a six months active unit and then I\nwas in the reserve for the next seven years, which means going to meetings throughout\nthe year and every summer for two years I had to go to Camp Drum, upstate New York to\ntrain and whatnot. So I -- I joined the National Guard and I was inducted into the army at\nFort Dix, New Jersey, had my basic training there, went through all the bologna. But, I\nmaintained a strict kosher Jewish front. I had the strength to do that. I wore my yarmulke,\nI refused any food, I refused to work on Saturdays. But I was a good soldier. I did\neverything I was supposed to do. And it worked. I was really -- I saw the difference that -\n- between people, for the first time, I -- I got some respect from some people when I did\nthe thing the right way. My commander was -- was very proud of me. Here, I had this --\nthey were talk -- I heard them talking, the commanders talk about their Jews that they had\nin their -- in their -- in their units, who were giving them trouble in terms of not wanting\nto work on Saturdays, not wanting to eat the food in the mess hall, wearing a hat which\nwas against army regulations and so on. So, he was very proud of me. My Slotkin, he\u2019s a\nsharpshooter. I was a sharpshooter. But I went strictly by the laws, the -- at the time, in\nNew Jersey, Fort Dix, they had a chaplain, chaplain -- a Lieutenant Colonel Angle, I\nthink was his name. But he had made a set of rules for all the observant Jews. If they\nwant to maintain their observance while they\u2019re in the army, they have to follow the rules\nto the letter, not deviate, they\u2019ll be no deviation. Everybody had to do exactly the same\nthing. And it worked. I mean, I was respected, I -- Friday afternoon the -- the truck came\nto the fields, picked me off -- cleaned my rifle and they sent me either home or I was put\naway into -- into -- into the chapel which was used on Saturday for the Jews, on Sunday\nfor the -- for the non-Jews, but I was away for Saturday. And it -- it never ran into a\nproblem, except for some of the unintelligent people who -- who didn\u2019t know what\nJewish was or what a yarmulke was or what kosher food was and they almost -- some of\nthe southern sergeants, they almost looked for horns under my hat, every once in awhile.\nI mean, there was a lot of ignorance, stupidity and whatnot out there and -- and outrage\nreally. When some of them -- when they saw the number and this 1s now early fi -- late\n50\u2019s, not that far from the war -- should know what -- what the -- nothing. Totally\nignorant and not sensitive to -- to the issues. But I went through the -- through the army\nand my first son was born while I was in the army. So, if they had had more sensitive\ntests at the time, we most probably could have proved that my wife was pregnant and I\nwouldn\u2019t have had to go through this, but I consider it a -- a valuable experience. So,\nwhen army jokes come up, I know exactly what everybody\u2019s talking about. No, army is --\nis -- was a part of life and -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m not all that unhappy that I had to go through it. It\nwas a big waste, but I -- I recognize where -- where army has to be 1n readiness. You\nhave to have defense forces, any country has to have defense forces and the only way to\nhave it 1s to have trained people and the only way to train them 1s to -- even -- you know,\nis to train them. And you have to participate, so -- 1t\u2019s a given -- given. It\u2019s too bad that\nwe have such things 1n the first place, but I went through it.",
        "Q: Do you remember a particular story about certain insensitivities? You mentioned that\nyour commander was proud, but is there another story that illuminates a little bit, the kind\nof comments that you got, or --",
        "A: Well, as I -- as I said, the -- the mess hall sergeants, from -- from down south or -- I\nshouldn\u2019t really say south, they were from all over. If they were ignorant, they were\nignorant and they would not have the sensitivity to -- to even understand -- yo -- it\u2019s just\ntalking to -- to -- to a -- somebody totally out of this world, they would say, \u201cWhat would\nyou do if somebody was shooting at you?\u201d Well, of course the answer is you\u2019d most\nprobably shoot them back, even if it was the Sabbath. And if you had to survive, to eat --\nour religion teaches us you have to do anything to survive, so you\u2019|l eat non-kosher. But\nthis was peace-time New Jersey, not too far away from kosher hotels, where you could\nhave -- and there\u2019s just no need for it. They didn\u2019t understand that -- this duality, that the\n-- that you could be a human being, you don\u2019t have to turn yourself into a total animal,\neven though this is what the army -- well, this is what the army really teaches. They try to\nbreak your spirit. They break your spirit when they br-bring you in. They give you a\nhaircut, make you look like -- tot -- take your individuality away. They give you a\nnumber and they give you a tag and they ca -- you know, they -- they -- they -- they do\nthis for a reason, so you\u2019 ll stop questioning. But I think at the same time, when you stop\nquestioning, you lose sensitivity. So, you have to be very careful with that. So -- it\nhappened many times, I was -- you know, my hat was -- my hat -- my yarmulke. I\nwouldn\u2019t wear a hat, because that -- that would be totally against rule -- but the little\nyarmulke, knocked off my head by a sergeant. There was -- there\u2019s no need for that sort\nof thing. But, of course he didn\u2019t know where I was coming from. Maybe if he did,\nmaybe he would have acted differently. But, my friends -- my -- that I -- that I -- in my\nunit, not necessarily Jewish, they knew about me, because we talked. I mean we saw each\nother in the showers, they knew I had a number and they asked about it. And when I told\nthem about it, they were absolutely shocked. They were shocked that I was even in the\narmy. They couldn\u2019t believe that I was in the army. But they took care and I took ca --\nmy care and we -- we did the thing that we had to do. I was fine.",
        "Q: You mentioned your -- your son. When -- when was he born?",
        "A: If lremember correctly, it was \u201861 or \u201862. I think \u201c61 -- 1961 I think it was.",
        "Q: What\u2019s his name?",
        "A: I -- Zebbe. Actually, his name on the birth certificate reads Randolf, but he became\nknown to us as Zebbe, that\u2019s what everybo -- and he likes to be called Zebbe and he\u2019s my\neldest, my firstborn and he was born while I was at the army.",
        "Q: And the second -- you have -- how many children do you have?",
        "A: [have four. Three with my first wife, whom I divorced -- we were divorced seven\nyears after our marriage, we had -- there were three children. Zebbe, oldest, David came\nnext -- 20 months later. And then Corrie, my daughter, she came what -- two years later.\nSo that\u2019s the first -- my first marriage and then I have Mia with my second wife of now\n25 years. And I must say that when you have a child when you\u2019re a little bit older, it\u2019s a\ntotally different experience, in terms of your output to her -- he -- your input from her to\nyou, it\u2019s a totally, totally different thing. You -- you understand, you have -- you\nappreciate so much more, you have -- so much more sensitive to what childbirth 1s all\nabout. And -- including the real, actual childbirth methods at the time, were totally\ndifferent. In the early 60\u2019s, the husband spent his time in the waiting room, smoking\ncigarettes -- which I did too, and the waiting for the doctor to emerge from -- from some\ndark hallway, wishing you congratulations or whatever. And you had no -- no role in it.\nWhen my -- Mia was born in 1982, I was part of the operating team, I was in the room, I\nwas helping my wife -- not with anything real, but just moral support and I was there and\nthe doctors wanted me there to give her that moral support. And it was a wonderful\nexperience, and a big difference.",
        "Q: Sort of generally speaking, or in particular -- di-did you have -- did you develop a\ncertain philosophy of how to bring up your children, or certain rules? Something that s --\n5 --",
        "A: Well, it -- it -- it was difficult to develop something like this because when my first\nmarriage start to break up, and the kids were still pretty young. After seven years, my --\nthe oldest was maybe six and down the line of four, sometimes two years apart and then\ntwo more years apart. So, when that split took place -- first of all, community looked at\ndivorce differently than it does today. It was a -- almost a taboo kind of a situation,\nespecially in Orthodox circles. And obviously there was going to be a -- there was a -- an\nactual separation from me and my children. I did spend an awful lot of time with them,\nthough, while we were together and I think that always showed. And one of my\nstipulations to our separation agreement was that I must -- must have the children on --\non weekends. I mean, not every weekend, but there must be a time, I felt, when -- when\nthe father and his children have to live together like a family. Because visitation for two\nhours on a Sunday afternoon, I felt was an absolute waste of time. Maybe better not to\neven have it. Cause it would interfere too much. In the long run with -- kids have parties,\nkids have this to do. Why do you we have to w-wait until he picks us up to take us to a --\nI think life had to be lived together. An evening had to be spent, a -- a bath had to be\ngiven. Sa -- you know, you had to live together. So that was part of my sep-separation\nagreement, that I would have them at least two -- I think it was at least every other\nweekend and also in the summertime, I would have them for at least a month, full time.\nSo, my philosophy at the time, or what my goals were -- to try to make their lives as\nnormal as -- or as -- without too much change, which 1s very strange now that I\u2019m\nthinking about it. I had so much change, I tried to keep their lifestyle flowing, as it was\nbefore, when I was there. In other words, I tried to keep them in the same schools, in the\nsame environment, with the same friends. That was my -- my goal to do and try to keep\neverything as normal as -- as possible. Even keeled with me and so on. And I don\u2019t really\nknow, even now, to what extent I succeeded. I -- my two -- David and Corrie are married.\nMy oldest son is not married yet. So I always wonder -- 1s he not married because\nsomething I did? Did I put some guilt or did he s -- is he suffering from the divorce, or is\nhe suffering from second generation syndromes, which are very popular now, that\neverybody talks about -- I just wonder. But I -- I have to say that all three of them are\ntotally different individuals, I recognized it early in life. They had different interests.\nThey had to be treated differently, they were little, individual people. And when my\noldest son I -- I mean even when he start to -- when he became an adult, which I -- I term\nroughly after voting age, you know, I gave him more free reign. You can no longer\ndictate what he\u2019s to do and how to do it. You can advise, I realize that -- which is\nsomething I -- I think I learned in a negative way from my father, Meyer Slotkin, which\nhe didn\u2019t really allow me. But I allowed this, that it\u2019s his own -- it\u2019s going to be his life\nand I wish he would take my advice and this and that, but you know, you can\u2019t -- even\ntoday I can\u2019t -- I won\u2019t even get into a real hassle with my son about anything that he\nreally wants to do. We can talk about it, but we don\u2019t -- we don\u2019t confront each other. I\nwon\u2019t -- you know -- they\u2019Il be no confrontation. And my -- my -- my Mia, the lo-love of\nmy life, with the love of my life, June. I -- I -- I have to say about June, she is the best\nwoman in the world, my wife of 25 years. She helped me raise those three children. I\nmean she\u2019s -- it wasn\u2019t a sacrifice to her. She had them with me and we had them in our\nhouse. Now here she is, a woman, three children -- my children, they were not her\nchildren and I must say she treated them, she treated them as well as she treats Mia -- like\nin -- I have a source for comparison. She treated them as her own, as much as that was\npossible under the circumstances, for the weekends that we had and the summers that\nthey spent together. And I say they spent together -- she\u2019s a teacher, so they went out to --\nto a resort -- Fire Island, specifically speaking -- and they had a wonderful time. The kids\nstill talk about it. And I went to work most of the week -- I took a lot of time off also. I --\nI worked -- actually I did everything in reverse. I worked three days and the rest of the\ntime I spent out there. Right. I worked three days a week and the rest of the time I spent\nout there with them. We had a wonderful time as a family. We lived there as a family. It\nwas -- it was wonderful. And just brings to mind, my daughter Mia, whenever we show\npictures of -- of Fire Island and the -- June and myself and the three kids, she says, \u201cWell,\nwhere am I? Where am I?\u201d And we have to tell her that she wasn\u2019t on the scene yet, she\nwasn\u2019t even born yet. And -- but she -- she knows, she -- they were very close -- my\ndaughter Mia 1s very close with the three kids. They -- they know that they\u2019re brothers\nand sister. They\u2019re related and they -- they talk constantly, they keep in touch. And that\u2019s\none of the things that I -- now that we\u2019re talking about a little bit philosophy, I keep\ntelling my children, \u201cIn the long run, you only have each other to really depend on.\nYou\u2019re --\u201d And here comes this blood thing, I guess. \u201cYou\u2019re all related, blood related,\nyou have the same father -- same parentage.\u201d So, I keep stressing that and I -- and I think\nthat they know that, they understand it. They\u2019re all in touch with each -- with each other.\nAnd perhaps my son Zebbe was affected by that a little bit in a negative way. Maybe he\nfelt responsible for the two others and somehow he lost something of his own identity in\nit. But, I really can\u2019t worry about that, because that\u2019s not a healthy thing to do. It\u2019s his\nlife, he had all the options -- he has all the options -- he still does. I mean, he can do\nwhatever he wants, as long as he\u2019s behaving himself now. He ca -- he\u2019s -- he\u2019s a free\nman, he\u2019s -- he\u2019s a free man. My philosophy basically was to let them do, know that they\nshould depend on each other, stick together as a family. I never tried to push my -- my f -\n- my background into them. I never told them the stories, never force fed them. They --\nthey were starting to come out and ask. They started asking in 1985, when they first\nbecame aware. And my son Zebbe, especially now, he\u2019s -- he\u2019s truly into it. He really is\ninto the -- he\u2019s a photographer also, so he -- he does a lot with that. Somehow he\nmanages to express, he -- he took all the photos that we were able to get from Europe and\nhe arranged them, I have the albums here. And he sort of put meaning to them, I mean he\n-- he -- he\u2019s very meticulous and he tried to s -- you know, put them in chronological\norder and he -- I think he made an album for Irene, a copy for myself and he -- he\u2019s into -\n- he\u2019s into it. He watches all the latest on -- on Holocaust movies, \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u2019 for\nexample, he -- he -- he must have seen it many times. I saw it once. Very good film,\ncredit is due there, both from artistic point of view and from -- from a point of view\nauthenticity, even though some of the scenes, they were not quite real, as only I would\nknow. But the idea was very authentic and what took place was -- seemed very authentic.\nBut the scenes weren\u2019t quite as dirty as I remembered them and quite as bloody and -- but\ngood movie, good movie, so -- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s my philosophy with the -- with the kids.",
        "Q: I would like to talk a little bit more about the very important year of 1985, when you\nand Irene began to search a little bit more, but I\u2019d like to backtrack just -- just a bit.",

        "A: Just generally speaking? Well, I was always math and science minded and Jules Verne\nwas one of my -- one of my favorite authors, so when America finally landed on the\nmoon, I -- that was mind-boggling to me. I remember -- this is 1959 or \u201860, I\u2019m not su --\nquite sure, it was in that time frame, but -- was it that, or was it much later? Well,\nwhatever the time frame was -- I th-think it was late 60\u2019s, now that I\u2019m thinking about it,\nyeah, \u201869 was probably more like it, yeah. And that -- that was mind blowing to me. It\nwas a superb achievement, but at the same time, we -- we advanced so scientifically, I -- I\nknew there was so much -- so much suffering still going around the world. Even today,\n1997, 1-it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s mindboggling that somehow our -- our -- our scientific achievement\nhasn\u2019t matched our social growth or m-moral growth or what have you. Politics included.\nSo it -- as impressive as it was -- it was maybe a little disappointing also, that we had to --\nbut it was a race between Russia and the United States and we won.",
        "Q: I would like to just do a brief follow up question. You mentioned that your s -- one of\nyour son, the oldest, is a photographer?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: What -- what are the other children and what did you do for a living or do you do for a\nliving?",
        "A: Oh. My -- all three of the children, in fact all four of the children went to Israel. The\nthree children went after high school, they went for a year to study 1n Israel. It -- it was a\npopular thing, I guess, for parents to do and I felt it was an excellent vehicle for them to\nspend a time, to mature a little bit, to orient themselves and to know a little bit more what\nthey\u2019re doing. Which I didn\u2019t know what to do when I was finished with high school. I\nmean I truly didn\u2019t know what to do. And I felt it was a good maturing experience and\nalso, I secretly -- I almost felt, getting the reports from people who spent a year in Israel,\nthey never wanted to come back. I was sort of hoping that maybe something would --\nwould keep them there and somehow maybe I would end up there for -- going there. I --\nthat\u2019s still sort of a dream in the back of my mind, because somehow -- I know I\u2019m\nJewish, there\u2019s no escaping it, there\u2019s just no escaping the fact that you\u2019re Jewish, no\nmatter how friendly, how welcoming an environment is and the United States is the most\n-- probably the -- the friendliest country for a Jew to live in today, maybe even Israel. But\nhome 1s -- 1s -- the homeland -- the Jewish homeland, which -- which was always in -- in\nmy f -- you know, background of an -- or focus on and off, Israel is the place -- 1s the\nonly place and it -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m glad I sent them, I\u2019m glad they went. Even my\ndaughter Mia, she hasn\u2019t finished high school yet, but she already went last -- two\nsummers ago, for an extended stay of three weeks and she loved it. Of course loving it at\n14 is differently than loving it when you\u2019re 16 or 17, but they all had a very good\nexperience there. My son David is somewhat of a student. He studied there in the\nYeshiva. And he eventually became a -- got a degree of rabbi, which 1s just like a\ndoctorate in Jewish studies, but he became a rove, he got the smeeha, which 1s the\nequivalent of a doctorate in rabbinical studies, I guess, from Yeshiva University and he\nnow is -- he\u2019s a teacher in Westchester, in Mamaranak. And his wife is also a teacher, she\nteaches handicapped people -- hard of hearing and unable to speak, she talks in sign\nlanguage. So they\u2019re both teachers and they have three boys, which means of course I\nhave at least three grandchildren. And they have a wonderful life together. They -- they\nhave summers off together, which is -- which is something that I always encouraged my\nkids. My -- my secret desire to be a math teacher, part of that plan was to have summers\noff, so that I could be with kids. I love kids. So, as it turns out -- as -- I love children, I\nlove to teach. I mean I could -- I just -- thought came back to me, which will throw me\nback into the Slotkin house, if -- 1f I could. They sent me to summer camp and I became -\n- | was always athletic alee in class. I became a swimmer and I ended up getting a water\nsafety\u2019s instructor\u2019s certificate from the Red Cross, which made me a lifeguard and -- so I\ndid that for quite a few summers, late high school and -- no, actually college years and\nduring that course, I taught. I became a teacher -- at least I was teaching something. Not\nmath, but swimming. And it was a very rewarding experience, especially when -- when --\nwhen I managed to teach a non-swimmer, who was totally afraid of the water, or a\nhandicapped person -- to get them into the pool, to get them to relax, to gain that\nconfidence, to be able to float and to move in water, which is so life-threatening to most\npeople if they are afraid of it. So, it was a -- it was a wonderful experience and I think\nthat teaching 1s something that I pushed a little bit on as a -- as a professional. I thought\nthat was a good profession and my son David I think took -- took us up on it. I think\nJune, my wife, who is a teacher, also saw the wisdom in that, so we pushed him, really.\nWe re -- we really forced him a little bit. And he -- he took us up on it. He\u2019s very happy\nnow. And my daughter Corrie also went to Israel... more of a secular type. She didn\u2019t --\nwasn\u2019t engaged in the Torah and the Talmudic studies that the boys are -- are sort of\nexpected to do in the -- in the -- in the Orthodox way of doing things.

She\u2019s -- she gave up working because she really wants to spend time\nwith her children, even though she can afford to do otherwise. And she\u2019s very happy --\nshe\u2019s very happy. And my little Mia, well, we\u2019re going to wait.",
        "Q: How did you meet your second wife and why did you marry\u201d?",
        "A: Well, I knew, when I really divorced, that I could never live alone. I mean, I knew that\nth-there -- I would have to be, cause I\u2019m that type of a person, I\u2019m not a loner, I -- I need\nto be around people, with people. And so I knew I would marry, but obviously right after\ndivorce I wasn\u2019t ready. I-It\u2019s strange. I met her through a coincidence of -- of the Slotkins\nagain, believe it or not. My father, Meyer Slotkin was best friend with -- with a\ngentleman called Daniel Meyers, this is down in Lawrence, Long Island, who used to\npick us up. My memory 1s -- of him is pick us up Friday afternoons, half wet from a\nShabbas preparation shower, cigarette dangling out of his mouth, driving 100 miles an\nhour, picking us up to go to Shul Friday night. And they were best of friends and Daniel\nMeyers had a son who was younger than I, but we -- nevertheless, we knew of each other\nand this fellow, Jonathan Meyers, used to live one house down from here, where I live\ntoday. He married a girl and they used to spend summers out on Hampton -- in the\nHamptons -- Amagansett, Long Island. And my wife, being a teacher -- teachers all have\nsummers off. They also spend time on the beaches, if they like beaches. So they met up\nthere. And then when my separation came about, Jonathan and his wife -- Jonathan and\nhis wife and I -- f -- Pll try and remember her name later -- they thought that -- that June\nwould be a excellent match for me, because they knew here very well, she lived with\nthem for awhile and they knew of me. So they introduced us. And so we actually met for\nthe first time, a few hundred yards from where I sit now. And this was 1970, I think. \u201869 -\n- 1970. And our first impressions -- I remember I didn\u2019t want to come into the city, but he\nsaid, \u201cOh come, please, we --\u2019\u2019, I said, \u201cLook, I know you want to meet -- you want to\nmake us some kind of a shiddock, you wanted me -- me to meet some girl, or this,\u201d said,\n\u201cplease, I am not interested, I don\u2019t want it, I\u2019m not ready for any of this. You want me to\ncome in for dinner, I'll come in for dinner, we\u2019 ll talk,\u201d and this and this, wi -- I walked in\nand there is June. And I was pretty disturbed, in a negative way, I didn\u2019t want any part of\nthis. I found out later -- many years later, that when June saw me walk through the door,\nshe said to herself, \u201c\u201cThere\u2019s the man I\u2019m going to marry.\u201d So first impressions is what\nsometimes work and sometimes they don\u2019t work. But they\u2019re a valuable tool for some, I\nguess. So that\u2019s where I met June. And we started dating very, very slowly. I must admit,\nshe was first much more aggressive than I was. But I saw the value of her -- she\u2019s a\nwonderful person, just a marvelous person. Then, after a couple of years, I turned to -- I\nturned to be more aggressive, because she was going away every summer and I started\nfeeling lonely and this and that and so once we made up our minds, we -- I proposed to\nher. I tried to pick a spot -- a romantic spot, because I\u2019m that way in my heart. I tried to\npick a spot that would always be here. So I picked the Metropolitan Museum. They used\nto have a pool garden around them, with fountains and the cafeteria -- caf\u00e9 around it. It\nwas magnificent. The pool was huge and it had statues and water was flowing out. It was\na beautiful setting there. The piano bar and this -- this is where I wanted to get engaged\nbecause I wanted to always be able to come back to the place and -- and somehow\ncelebrate. By the -- just by the way, on the side note on this -- this same location was\nused I think, by Sybill, the picture Sybill -- if anybody knows about that. But that\u2019s where\nit can be seen. So, we were engaged and married three weeks later and happy. Happy,\nhappy, happy. I don\u2019t think we ever had a real fight. Disagreements, yes, but not any real\nout and out fight, ever. And she\u2019s been a mother to the three children. [phone message\nmachine]",
        "Q: We\u2019re going to stop the tape for a second. How -- how old were your children when\nyou got married again? They were fairly young?",
        "A: Yes, yes. I remember we -- b-before I even go on to that, I just have to say, in the\ncontext of what we were talking before, that as -- as wonderful as June was and what a\nwonderful contribution a woman can make to a -- to a -- to a husband, to a family, to a\nman like me. It required, I guess, special understanding, because she is very special. But\nit -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s been wonderful. For me, life has been wonderful since I met June. And the\ncon -- to contrast that, it could be the worst thing if you have the wrong mate, which I\nalso had before. So -- I sort of -- I\u2019m just saying, I know what I\u2019m talking about. A wife -\n- a true partner, can make or break you, is -- 1s my whole point. And when the -- the\nchildren, when -- when I got married to June were quite, quite young and I think in their\nidealistic way, they still sort of hoped that somehow things would go back to where they\nwere. Even though they spent so much time here with us, so they knew that this was the\nright way. I -- I have to mention at this point also that at one point in time, the two oldest\nones, they actually left their mother\u2019s homes to come to us -- to live with us. And we\nmade provisions here for that. Corrie, my ol -- the youngest, the last one left, didn\u2019t have\nthe strength or didn\u2019t want to -- or didn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t leave her mother alone or something.\nSo that never happened. But -- at the -- when the marriage took place, it was still --\nfeelings were still very raw. There was a lot of animosity and there was -- was a new\nthing. So, we wanted the kids to come to the wedding, but we couldn\u2019t announce it freely\nto my ex-wife, because that would not have worked. So -- and the children were so\nyoung, that we couldn\u2019t even tell them, the wedding is going to take place at a certain\ntime and we had to have them dressed. So I remember, very distinctly, we --we went to\nbuy them suits. We purchased them at J.C. Penney, I remember that very distinctly, they\nwere the suits -- we tried to guess their sizes and dress and whatnot and that weekend that\nthey came -- we were married on a Sunday -- we told them about this and it was quite a\nshock for them to realize that we were going to get married, cause -- I mean they knew us\nas being together, but this is a different ball game. This sort of made it irreversible or\nwhatever. But it -- 1t was hard and I even at the -- at the wedding, I have a few pictures\nwhere I see Zebbe sitting alone and some photographer caught me tal -- trying to talk to\nhim, his head down and -- he wasn\u2019t upset about the food, he was upset about what was\ntaking place. So I think it was a hard thing for them, but I think that now they realize how\nhappy we are and they -- they constantly want to come here. My -- Corrie wants to be h-\nhere every Shabbas now, even though she has a house which could house all of us on\nLong Island, but this is where she wants to be, on the living room floor here. She would\nrather be here with -- with the family. So I think I -- I managed to get a certain point\nacross to them. [telephone ringing]",
        "Q: We will stop for a second. Let me go back just -- just for one second. Do you think the\ndifficulties, without necessarily going into detail, but the difficulties that you experienced\nduring your first marriage -- marriage, had to do with, in part at least, with who you were\nbecause of your particular experience?",
        "A: No, not really. I think 1t was simply having the wrong partner. Also, when you\u2019re\nyoung -- well it\u2019s the wrong partner, because you married, as a course of event at the\ntime. You finish school, the next step is marriage and you just stepped into it without too\nmuch thinking and perhaps there was a little bit of pressure from -- a negative pressure\nfrom my house to get out and I just wanted out. But basically I think it\u2019s because it was\nthe wrong partner. Because the difference is unbelievable.",
        "Q: When did you begin to talk to your family and to Irene about the earlier experience\nagain? Or for the first time.",
        "A: For the first time, Irene and I, although we lived in the same house, under the same\nroof, we had the same friends, we had so many common interests -- the first time we\ntalked about it was in 1985, in Jerusalem. Two years prior to \u201885, there was a convention\nin Philadelphia, a Holocaust convention, which I never really paid much attention to by --\nby Mr. Mead and his wife and they had these annual get-togethers, but it never interest\nus, because we were protected from it, we were -- we\u2019re just not part of that scene at all.\nBut we had a special invitation from a lady, Eva Core, who formed a twin organization.\nNow this was more our speed, because we knew we were twins and -- and it sort of hit\nhome a little bit. She was a very forceful lady and she said we -- we -- we owe it to\nourselves, we owe it to our children, we owe it to the future, we owe it to mankind\nperiod, just to talk a little bit and let them know what -- what happened. Whatever the\nresult of that 1s, 1s -- is up to history to judge, but we owe it to the people. We owe it to\nourselves. And being that I and a -- I and -- and my sister and we never talked about it, it\n-- it was just -- seemed like might be very interesting to hear it from somebody else, even\nthough we knew that we were there, 100 percent, because we had some pictures, we had\nthe numbers. We wanted to, I think, make contact with others who were in the same --\nsame situation. So, we -- we\u2019ve -- we made contact with them, we joined the organization\nand in 1985, Eva Core made this -- was the head -- head of this mock trial for Dr.\nMengele, to which all the twins in the world were invited. She searched them out and we\nwere all there, that -- that she could get. There were scores. There were scores there. I\nthink maybe like 80 - 85 twins or something like that. And -- some single twins, because\ntheir partners, their tw -- other twins didn\u2019t survive. But -- there were some small people -\n- what do you call them? Not pygmies.",
        "Q: No. Dwarfs.",
        "A: Dwarfs. Dwarfs, yeah. There were -- and I think they\u2019re might have been one or two\nGypsy, but I -- I don\u2019t believ -- I -- I don\u2019t think -- I don\u2019t remember seeing them in\nJerusalem, but there were definitely some dwarfs there in 1985. And the -- the -- the\nmock trial of Dr. Mengele took place in Yad Vashem and in -- and it was given a lot of\npublicity throughout the world. Dr. Mengele came on the scene because that was his trial\nand the -- the testimony given by eyewitnesses against him were -- were -- were just\nunbelievable. We talked -- not so much during the trial itself, but after the trial, in our\nhotels, we talked to the other twins and they told us what had taken place with them and\nsome of the stories were just unbelievable. Even to us, even though we were there. There\nwas just -- horrible. But it -- we made contact, for the first time and this is where I saw\nthe effects that this war had on -- on -- on -- on people, on -- on -- and this 1s where I\ncame to the -- to the realization that I am so lucky, because I think I -- I sort of escaped it,\nrelatively unscathed. I -- maybe because -- maybe I\u2019m hiding it, maybe it\u2019s repressed,\nmaybe it\u2019s in there somewhere. But I felt -- I felt so much more at ease with the world.\n[phone answering machine]",
        "Q: We\u2019ll stop for one second please. -- with the world?",
        "A: Yeah, I -- I -- P\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve looked around me and I saw all these people that were hurt,\nsome actually, physically, were on -- on kidney machines. Emotionally, I saw 50 year old\ngirls, twins -- they were dressed alike, they had the little ponytails, braided tails and\nthey\u2019re holding hands together and walking around like this. Now, these people\nobviously were hurt, emotionally, spiritually -- there -- there\u2019s something wrong with\nthem. And they all had this look in their eye. This -- this -- a certain look that -- a wild,\nyou know, a hurt look. And only maybe 10 percent -- less than 10 percent, five percent\nof the people were people that I could relate to, speak to normally and -- and not be afraid\nthat I would offend them in any way because certainly we -- we were talking to each\nother much more openly, because we all knew who we were. We were saying things that\nwe wouldn\u2019t normally say, but we\u2019re still being very careful and had to be careful, except\nfor a handful. Truly maybe five percent of the people that we could really talk to freely.\nAnd I think, as a result of all this -- this -- this created a -- a -- an environment for my\nsister and I, cause I think one of the evenings, we sat down in our room and we just\nstarted. It just poured out. We started talking and this and -- and you know, recalling our\nmemories, our this -- slowly at first, but g -- and we felt so much, so much relief. I don\u2019t\nknow what kind of relief, but just relief that finally we were able to talk. And I guess 1-1t\nwas time. It was just time t-to unload all this and only to ourselves. We still did not feel\nfree to talk to the Slotkins. Now, my father had passed away already. He passed away in\n81 - \u201882, but my mother was still around. She was still from the old school and even\nthough she now knew that we were public with it, and we appeared on shows and Irene\nlectures and this and that, she still -- it wasn\u2019t something that was good for Irene to do,\nbecause she was totally protected. For me, she -- she knew I was a little flightier and\nmaybe less easily hurt or more extroverted or had 1t more hidden in me, or whatever. But,\nso in 1985 -- 40 years after. 40? Yeah.",
        "Q: Were you recognized by somebody at this -- at this conference in Jerusalem?",
        "A: Yeah. Yes, there were a couple of people that -- that recognized me as that little boy,\nbecause I was truly one of the youngest blond-headed kid, they recognized me and they --\nthey let me know that they remembered me. And that didn\u2019t do all that much for me.\nWell, of course you remember me, I was there, you were there. But in the negative sense,\nIrene wasn\u2019t recognized by anyone. And this hurt her, I think, even though she\u2019s now an\nadult and I think she still would have liked to have been remembered by somebody --\ncreated enough of a -- an impression. But I\u2019m not all that surprised, because from what\nshe tells me, she was mostly always in the background. Nobody took care of her. As the\nmen seemed to have -- for some reason they took much better care of -- of their -- of the\nyounger twins. They somehow had an organization and they -- they -- they took care of\nthe younger ones. That ladies, for some reason -- and I can\u2019t understand why, but they\ndid not have the same sort of a set up.",
        "Q: So when you and Irene talked together for the first time, you pieced your memories\ntogether, what -- what -- what -- give me -- what happened?",
        "A: I -- I don\u2019t think we bothered really to piece the memories, cause we -- we had them.\nWhat we -- what we tried to -- to do is to -- for the few -- one specific example I can give\nyou -- when we were in Auschwitz, after we were separated and we were -- like she was\nin the women\u2019s camp, I was in the men\u2019s camp and we were taking to the doctor on an\nindividual basis, even though I guess they knew who I was -- I was a twin to the other\none. But we saw each other once, through a fence, a barbed wire. And at that eye contact,\nno words, nothing was spoken, but we both remembered that. That one moment, that one\ninstant. And I think that\u2019s the instant that -- that gave us the -- the -- the -- the impetus to -\n- to say, \u201cHe\u2019s alive. He\u2019s always going to be alive -- or she\u2019s alive. I\u2019m going to find her,\nI\u2019m going to do --\u201d. So we talked about that moment of recognition, cause I knew it was\nher, but I wasn\u2019t sure that she knew that it was me. But we got that straightened out very\nquickly. So we talked, but even though we talked for the first time and we were as open\nas we could, Irene still held back a lot of things. And I guess I held back a lot of things,\ntoo and I\u2019m only saying this empirically speaking now, because I know how much more\ninformation we let out since 1985. But we talked about it and it felt good. It was a relief.\nIt really was a relief. And for -- I think from that point on, we realized we\u2019re going to\nhave to talk about it. And that it -- good will come of it. And it -- it has to be. Because\nquestions are asked by people close to you, by your family. They have to be answered,\nthey can\u2019t be -- you -- you can\u2019t put them aside, they have to be answered. And they -- in\norder to answer them, they have to be answered truthfully. As fully and as truthfully as\nwe can answer them.",
        "Q: What happened in your family, when you begin to talk about 1t? Did you do on your\nown, or did it --",
        "A: No, no, here I -- I have to say that I allowed the Slotkins to -- to -- to -- to manipulate\nmy mind. Not manipulate by my -- but th-they -- I was always sort of in the same\nframework. I didn\u2019t want to tell the kids about my horrors. I never hid anything from\nthem, conscio -- but I never wanted to either tell them. So, as they grew older, their\nquestions became more intense and I tried to tell them whatever I could gear to their age.\nYou know, at -- at six, seven, eight years old, when -- you know, you -- you can tell a kid\nsomething, but you can\u2019t -- so but now it\u2019s ou -- all out and they know everything and\nwhenever there is something that\u2019s happening, they want to be part of it. And I think they\nfeel sort of an honor that their father survived it all. I -- I really do. I think -- that\u2019s how\nthey make me feel, anyway, so it\u2019s good. I mean, I don\u2019t mind.",
        "Q: You began to speak publicly about it as well, in schools?",
        "A: Yes. I don\u2019t know how you knew that, but it\u2019s true. In addition to the media exposure\nthat -- when we were hot, in 1985 and Mengele was on the front page and we were flown\nout to California once, I remember, to a show -- we were on the Good Morning Show\nhere and this and that, but, you know, this was just few short questions, answering to the\npeople and -- and, you -- you know, you were prepped for this, basically. You still\nanswered truthfully, but you were prepped for it, for -- but to really get the message\nhome, I thought -- and Irene, whenever she speaks, you can\u2019t do it as a factual thing. \u201cOh\nyes, we went -- we were -- so many were killed, we saw people getting killed every day -\n- where they kept marching them to the ovens, and there were piles of bones.\u201d Everybody\nhas seen this. But we thought, to bring it home, really to -- to -- to bring it home, is to\npersonalize the message. To -- to make you as real as you possibly can make it. So Irene\ndoes it in a way -- she\u2019s a wonderful speaker, I -- she really is, she -- I\u2019ve -- ve heard\nher speak to congregations and to gatherings and people are absolutely spellbound. When\nshe finishes, they -- they just look at each other and there\u2019s nothing to say. I\u2019m not that\nway. I like to go to schools. I -- I would -- I remember twice -- on two occasions, I went\nto schools. I actually put the kids on the floor, in a circle around me and let them touch\nme, let them ask. I didn\u2019t start telling them. I tol -- they were prepped by their teacher,\nknowing that here is a man from concentration, comes from a -- and I just let them -- let\nthem loose. And, you know some of them ask questions about -- kids -- some ask, you\nknow, \u201cDid they -- did they feed you? Did you starve?\u201d And did you this and that. These\nare youngsters. But older people -- much more intelligent, much more sensitive\nquestions, they really want to know. And they know so little from the history books.\nThere\u2019s no history out there of this. History doesn\u2019t teach this, the Holocaust. It\u2019s just\nsomething that happened. And the Bronx High School of Science, that was the last one\nthat I a-attended a class there -- a -- high school students. And there were -- they\u2019re\nstudying the Holocaust and they have a very extensive Holocaust exhibition down in\ntheir basement as part of their library. Very, very intense, one of the best. And they --\nthey really wanted to get into it, because they ju -- there was just no way they could get it\nfrom history. So getting to talk to them, I got them to really feel -- I try to make them feel\nthat I\u2019m real, you\u2019re real, it really happened. And I think they believe me and that was\none of my greatest rewards, because today there are a lot of people out there who say it\nnever happened. What -- what their motivation is, I don\u2019t know. But there are people\nlistening.",
        "Q: There is concern, or there -- there is concern among the Jewish community to not put\nso much emphasis, all the time on the Holocaust as not to take away from other Jewish\nexperiences. Is that something you are sympathetic with or that you have feelings about?",
        "A: There is, unfortunately Jews, like all other people, we\u2019re -- we\u2019re somewhat slaves to\nthe current markets and -- and if the pop -- the topic 1s popular, people get on it. There\u2019s\nsome people who -- who actually force a living out of the Holocaust. Very few, but there\nare some. So, all I\u2019m really saying 1s that -- th-that a lot has been done, a lot has been\nsaid, because it\u2019s timely. It seems to be the thing. Whether you were -- you can ever\ntotally overkill the issue, I -- I -- I don\u2019t know, I -- I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think that you\nreally can, I think it\u2019s a very important part of the Jewish history, but certainly it\u2019s not the\nhappening. I think the happening happened a long time ago, when God took Moses and\nchildren of Israel out of Egypt. And I think that was the happening. And if all Jews\nfocused on that, they would get a little better understanding of what really 1s worthwhile -\n- or what they should concentrate on. But, certainly history -- and this is the same, it\u2019s\nhistorical, you have to look at your history in order to live today and prepare for\ntomorrow. You just have to do that. You have to do that and the -- the Holocaust is what\nhappened to us, unfortunately. And it\u2019s my life, I was turtle -- totally immersed in it for\nawhile and I\u2019m still immersed in it many years later. The -- the just -- you just don\u2019t\nforget about it. You know it every day. You know that you\u2019re different. How different,\nI\u2019m not sure. I honestly don\u2019t know, but I know that my background 1s different than --\njust as I\u2019m different from any other person living.",
        "Q: You have obviously managed to lead a very fruitful life, a rich life -- still leading it.\nAre there nightmares left? Fears that lead back to that time? Tra -- memories that get\ntriggered at certain moments?",
        "A: I have to disagree with you a little bit. A little bit. Yes, I have a fruitful life. I\u2019ve -- I\nhave grandchildren, I have children. But somehow I -- I feel that all this -- this -- all this\ncoincidence -- I can\u2019t even say luck, it was sort of my destiny, I feel somehow, to escape\nand to come here to the United States. To be in the army, to be divorced, to -- to find\nJune. To -- to work for a synagogue. To -- to do whatever I\u2019ve done. But somehow I\ndon\u2019t quite feel fulfilled. I don\u2019t feel this richness of having lived a truly fruitful life.\nMaybe nothing to do with the Holocaust. Maybe if I would have been a math teacher, it\nwould have been fulfilling. But I haven\u2019t done that and there\u2019s something still missing. I\ndon\u2019t know what to attribute this to. There is something not quite -- 1t seems that I\u2019ve\nescaped something that was so horrendous that I -- I feel maybe I should have done\nsomething unbelievable, but I haven\u2019t. Even though, some say an ordinary life -- a -- a\nrich life or children and education, this is -- is an achievement of it\u2019s own, but I -- I just --\nI wonder. I wonder about this. I feel that maybe I should have -- I\u2019ve been destined for\nsomething -- maybe still to come, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Is there something that you would like to say in conclusion to this interview?",
        "A: I think I just said it. I feel very, very lucky that I escaped. I\u2019m very fortunate with\nwhat I -- what I have. I have what I think are the true riches. I have a wife that loves me,\nthat I love. I have a family. I belong to a synagogue, I\u2019m a member of a community. I\nhave good friends, I have -- I seem to be healthy, which unfortunately my sister doesn\u2019t\nhave the health. But then there 1s this -- still this -- there\u2019s a little bit of emptiness.\nUnfulfilled something in me that -- that I haven\u2019t satisfied yet. But perhaps I will, perhaps\n-- maybe this is one of the means by which I -- I do this, is when I do an interview like\nthis, or when I expose my emotions like this, it takes a few days to come back -- to sort of\nget back into total norm. Perhaps this is something -- perhaps these comments, perhaps\nthe tapes that I\u2019ve done, perhaps the shows that we\u2019ve recorded, perhaps in the future,\nmaybe that is the thing that\u2019s going to count and -- and -- and serve, which I don\u2019t feel\nright now. Perhaps.",

        "Answer: My name originally was Rene Guttman and today I\u2019m Rene Slotkin, my adopted\nname.",
        "A: I was born December 21st, 1937, in Tepledseshanof, Czechoslovakia.",
        "A: That\u2019s north -- north of Prague. I understand now that that was abarbel Jewish\ncommunity at the time. And then my next rec -- my only recollection -- I don\u2019t have\nrecollection of Tepledseshanof, I do have recollection of Prague, as where we spent our\ntime before the war.",
        "A: My memories are very, very hazy about family before the war. I just have little\nvignettes of happenings, that happened with my sister -- us playing on the porch, a storm,\na staircase, me falling on a staircase and hurting my chin, requiring some kind of very\nburning ointment to -- to heal it. I honestly don\u2019t remember my mother. I remember our\nsurrounding, somewhat -- the apartment, or -- I do not remember my mother, my father.",
        "A: [ha -- I had a twin sister and there was my mother and my father. All this 1s now\nconfirmed by the pictures that we have. We were very, very lucky to be able to obtain\npictures of the four of us, of the three of us, of the two of us, in that way.",
        "A: First time away from home was we were taken to Theresienstadt. That was with my\nmother only, my father had been taken away from us months or maybe a year before.\nTime, to me didn\u2019t really register too well. But we were taken to Theresienstadt, my\nmother, my sister and myself. That\u2019s my first memory of being away from -- from our\napartment in Prague.",
        "A: I now know, yes. It was at the beginning of *43 or the end of *42. That\u2019s roughly the\ntime frame. And we were there almost a year, before they took us from there to\nAuschwitz.",
        "A: Yes, we were together as a family, we lived as a family.",
        "A: Well, what I know now, is that we were taken to Auschwitz. It was the winter of \u201843,\nDecember \u201843. We did live together for a couple of months until that Czech lager was\ndisbanded and must have been exterminated, except for the exception of some twins and\nsome people that they needed for either work or experiments. So, up to that point we\nlived together, after that we were separate. My mother was gone at this point. My sister\nand I were separated because we lived according to our sexes.",
        "A: I can\u2019t really tell you what I looked like or what I real -- I felt like -- it felt the same to\nme all the time, but externally I could tell that there was an activity in the camps that\nwasn\u2019t there always before. The soldiers were much more lax, there were more numerous\nair raids. There was arterler -- artillery fire that you could hear in -- 1n the -- on the\nhorizons and they we -- it was not as orderly as it was just bef -- during -- it wasn\u2019t as\norderly as it was before.",
        "A: Sounds -- just a drone of the aircraft and artillery, but nothing else, sound-wise, no.",
        "A: Well, liberation to me specifically came while we were on the march and we were\nbeing marched out of the camp, destination who knows and people were having a very\nhard time. It was -- it was winter, snow was on the ground and anybody that fall out of\nline or couldn\u2019t keep it up, they ju -- they would just kill. They were shot or pushed\noverboard and that was the end of them. That kept up for a very long time, I can\u2019t tell you\nexactly how much, but it was on for a very, very long time and all of a sudden the -- our\nGerman guards disappeared, they were gone. And we were surrounded by Russian\nsoldiers dressed in white and that was -- that was the liberation.",
        "A: Well, the Russians -- the memory that I have, they marched us off into a -- into a food\nwarehouse and there was a general stampede for -- for everything that you could get your\nhands on and I being very little, I couldn\u2019t really get through to anything, except I do\nremember very distinctly, being able to grab a hold of a gold can of something and -- and\nrolling it in front of me. It turned out to be sauerkraut when we opened it afterwards.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I must -- the smell of 1t I remember, but I don\u2019t remember really\ntasting it, no.",
        "A: It -- it was frenzied. That\u2019s the only way I can describe it. I don\u2019t have any real visuals\nabout people fainting from or dying, but it was a frenzy of -- of getting at it.",
        "A: I had just turned seven. It was -- my birthday was in December and we were liberated\nin January.",
        "A: Next memory is -- is a hospital setting in -- in -- and I know now it was -- it was pra --\nit was Bratislava in -- in Slovakia. And I do remember being under doctor\u2019s care and\nhaving x-ray work done. Roentgen, I think, was the name that they used a lot. And I\nunderstand that I -- I was a bit sick. From there, my real clear memory is in -- I was sent\nto a orphanage in -- in Kosheetza.",
        "A: I -- again, I just remember events that happened to me -- not so much my feelings. I\nfelt -- no, I-I really should say, I -- I was -- I felt loved, taken care of. These were nuns\nthat took care of me. And we felt -- we felt that we were being taken care of. I remember\nat on point in time, one of the nuns gave me a very big hug -- I\u2019ve mentioned this before -\n- and she gave me such a strong hug, she actually loosened one of my teeth. It was about\nto fall out anyway, but it happened at that point in time and I do remember that, that\u2019s a\nmemory I'll take with me.",
        "A: In the orphanage, no, no. I -- I really -- I really don\u2019t remember. I suspect that I wasn\u2019t\nthere very, very long in the orphanage setting, because the next memories that come up --\nand this is where I now start to become a person and I do communicate with people, was\nwhen Dr. Kalina, who was one of the administrators of this hospital/orphanage complex,\ntook me into his home. And I -- I -- I suspect that one of the reasons why he did that was\nbecause he and his wife were childless and that was a nice experience while it lasted.\nSubsequently, they did have a daughter born to them, Mimi was her name, the mother\u2019s\nname was Helena and he was Dr. Kalina. Nown Dr. Kalina. I can\u2019t remember his first\nname, though. Could be Frank or could -- that could have been his brother, but I\u2019 Il tr --\nDr. Kalina is a sure thing. And I live with them.",
        "A: I honestly did not connect to the past in any way. I just lived in the present. My sister\nwas though, however, constantly on my mind. I knew I had a sister and I knew that\nsomehow I was going to meet her and whenever things got tough, I said to myself, \u201c\u201cThis\nis -- I\u2019m going to do this for my sister.\u201d Whatever it was, whether it was a small problem\nor a big problem. But I lived in the present and I must say that the people really treated\nme very nicely. We lived in an apartment building and I do remember there was a\ncourtyard in the back and I don\u2019t know if they bought this for me or for their daughter\nthat was born, but I suspect it was more for me, because she was really a baby. They\nbought a little goat. This story I don\u2019t think has been told ever. A little goat and I had sort\nof responsibly for it, it was in a sort of a gardened off or a fenced off area. And it was a\nvery sweet sort of little thing and I fed it. I remember it pulling lettuce from my hands.\nThat\u2019s a very sweet experience. He also -- Dr. Kalina, now that I\u2019m thinking about it -- he\nwas -- he had an -- obviously an important position and he was somewhat well-to-do. He\n-- he had one of the few cars that private citizens owned at the time. It was a green\nconvertible and I guess as a boy I would have -- I would have loved to have driven that\nthing, but I enjoyed riding in it tremendously. There are other things about that\nexperience with the Kalinas. They allowed me to do things and I especially remember\nSundays. I don\u2019t know why I think of it as Sundays, but I\u2019m sure it was a Sunday, they\nwould always give me a couple of coronas -- money -- Czecho -- Czechoslovakian. And\nthey would let me go to -- to the local butcher store and I was able to purchase 10\ndecagrams of salami, which was the delicacy bar none for me. Once a week I was able to\ndo that -- that little bit of pielites living with the Kalinas also. There were other things I\nrecollect. It\u2019s the first time I think ve ever heard a phonograph. And they had a very\nfancy phonograph combination bar set, that opened up, the lights went on and there were\nglasses and played beautiful waltzes, music. These just -- little details, little details. Ho-\nHo-Home with ka -- with the Kalinas.",
        "A: Mm-hm. No, not at all, I had no idea about the laws of Kashrut or anything like that. I\nthink at th-that point in time -- I -- I don\u2019t think they were observant to any -- a great deal\neither. At that point in time, food was more the important thing, rather than yo -- than any\nof the restrictions on it. Kashrut was -- I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever -- in Czechoslovakia -- I\u2019ve\nheard the term, I\u2019ve seen the -- in Kosheetza, I went to slaughterhouses even -- not\nslaughterhouses as such, but places where they kill chickens. So -- so I know there was a\nritual to it, but I -- as far as forbidden foods, no. I -- I had no idea of anything being truly\nforbidden, no.",
        "A: Yes, I went to -- to school in Czechoslovakia, 1n Kosheetza. And that was quite an\nexperience. I think I was the only Jew, besides one other, in my whole school and I\u2019m\nreally sad to say and til this day I -- I find it so difficult to understand why we were really\nso disliked. W-We looked just like the rest of the kids, we didn\u2019t publicly appear -- I\nmean we did not appear Jewish in any way. We didn\u2019t wear hats or yarmulkes or had\nlong hair or anything like that. My only mark was my number. That branded me a Jew,\nhowever. And this other fellow, his name was Sobol, I don\u2019t think he had a number from\nany camp, but he was Jewish, they knew he was Jewish. Maybe he looked more Jewish\nthan I did, if there\u2019s such a thing. But th-the boys, even the -- at that age, we were like\neight, nine, 10, they were -- they were out there to beat us. Every day they could catch us\nafter school, they -- they actually waited for us and we had to run. Run for our -- not for\nour lives, because we were not old enough to really do that kind of harm to each other,\nbut we had to run, because we were going to be beaten.",
        "A: I think they just thought it was Jewish -- Jewish and -- Jewish connotation, I think,\neven -- even while the war was right there, still hot. And the e-extermination, I\u2019m sure,\nwas known about, but the hatred, I don\u2019t think was wiped out of the people. Or of this\ninnate insensitivity to Jewishness, or anti-Semitism, whatever you want to call it, people\nwere brought up with this sort of thing and even though the war was over and done with,\nit was still there. I think the Germans most probably had -- looking back now, part -- part\nof that is -- as -- as their plan to -- to make -- make their actions seem -- seem plausible,\nreasonable, even likable. So they had this propaganda machine and I\u2019m sure that they\nspread very not nice things about the Jews. So it just carried on.",
        "A: Well, Dr. Kalina and that beatings at school, that did not quite overlap together. Those\nbeatings at school came a little bit later. Dr. Kalina -- I was with him -- out of the -- my\nentire stay in -- in Kosheetza, not very long. I would think maybe about a fifth of the time\nthat I was there. He had to run off because somebody in the organization of his\nadministration had something against him and they spread some news about him -- he\nwas Jewish also and somehow he had to flee. So he left me with his sister, the Maun\nfamily. Edith Maun, here -- that\u2019s Frank Maun. Yes, that\u2019s the name, Frank. The Maun\nfamily. And they had two children, Otto and Beebe and they lived almost a -- just a block\naway or maybe even less than a block away from the school. This is the school that I\u2019m\nreferring to, where these -- where these things took place. And so it was with them, not\nthe Kalinas that -- that this -- these chases and beatings and whatnot took place.",
        "A: It was -- it -- it -- I -- 1t didn\u2019t seem to affect me. L-Life had so many changes 1n it. I\u2019m\n-- I\u2019m just trying to philosophize, now looking backwards. It did not seem to phase me.\nThings happened quickly, differently and it was just -- 1t was -- I think I just lived more\nor less for the moment, for the very immediate future time -- a day or two. I -- 1t did not\nbother me, no, no.",
        "A: Oh. That\u2019s a four - five year period there, there are lots of things -- lots of things. My\nwife being a school teacher, I\u2019m a little bit of -- of -- sort of into school authority kind of\nthing and I do remember, in -- in -- in Kosheetza, when you misbehaved in school, in\nclass, that was a very -- very difficult thing to deal with. Teachers actually had\npermission -- in fact I think they insisted that they hit you. I do remember, we used to\ncarry our own sticks with us and when we were bad, we\u2019d call -- be called to the front of\nthe room in front of the teacher\u2019s desk and we would hand him the stick and he would\ndish out on our hands, which we extended, you know one, two or whatever the\npunishment was. And I do remember that -- that as boys we had the discussion -- did we\nbring thick sticks or very thin sticks? Because the thin sticks would sting and the thick s-\nsticks would sort of, you know, just hit you flat. But I must say that order was maintained\nin the school. There was none of this that you hear today, in 1997, where you -- where a\nteacher looks at a kid the wrong way and the teacher runs -- and the -- and the child runs\nhome to his parents, then the parents come to school and the teacher\u2019s in big trouble and\nso 1s the administration in big trouble. This is like -- it\u2019s so absurd to me, that things like\nthis happen today and when I think of what happened then. And nobody really -- was\nreally hurt by this -- by this punishments. It was -- 1t was scolding 1n a way that kids\nunderstood, I think, at the time. And that\u2019s one of the things I do remember of the\nschools.",
        "A: Oh, absolutely, after --",
        "A: No, no and in fact it was -- there was a ca -- it was almost an orderly thing to be\nhappening, just to be hit and then be told to go back to your seat and behave, rather than\nbeing shot and never getting up again. I mean, you were taken care of properly, in a way,\nproperly. Schooling, since -- since we\u2019re on the subject of schooling, the last two years\nthat I was in Czechoslovakia, in Kosheetza, the Russians began to take hold and we had\nto take Russian language as a -- as a language, that was a re-requ-requirement that we all\nhad to do. And so I learned the Russian alphabet, we -- this 1s -- this was a must, we had\nto do all this. Things that I didn\u2019t want to do in school, that was one of them. Another\nthing that sort of -- I had trouble with in school was religious instruction. We had priests\ngiving us instructions and they even took us to -- to church many times. I don\u2019t know\nhow, but I always ended up at the end of the line and many times I didn\u2019t quite make it\ninto the church itself, but I do remember having to have to go at times and crossing\nmyself. Which was -- I know not the right thing for me to do. Don\u2019t ask me how I knew,\nbut I knew this wasn\u2019t the right thing for me to do. But it happened.",
        "A: Hm. That\u2019s a very interesting question. I -- I\u2019ve never focused on anything that I liked\nin school, other than I did enjoy playing soccer, yes. Yes, we did -- we did devise games\nof soccer and that was -- that was a very -- that was very exciting for me, but it was also,\nit was -- it sort of got all that extra energy out of me. When you were able to run -- yeah,\nrunning was always -- seemed to be the thing I\u2019ve been doing, either to good things or to\nbad things or for bad things. Yes, playing soccer was a very enjoyable kind of a activity\nin school -- school grounds or away, because they were lot -- we were not far from fields\n-- from out of town, anywhere you were in Kosheetza at the time, so we pl -- wherever\nwe could, we set up a soccer thing.",
        "A: Well, it seems yes, I\u2019ve had some relatives left in Germany. They were looking for me\n-- this is my father\u2019s brother. And there were other relatives alive, but I don\u2019t think they\nwere actively looking to -- to -- to get me -- to get a hold of me. My -- my mother had a\nsister alive in London, so I had a cousin there and an uncle. And my -- the Slotkins were\nnot my relatives yet, but I have a feeling they were starting to look for me, too. They\nwere looking for me, I think, much before I even heard of it, because I think that Irene,\nmy twin, when she told them that she had had a brother, not knowing whether he\u2019s alive\nor not alive, I think they started to wonder about it and they being the kind of people that\nthey are, I think they made some inquiries about tt.",
        "A: Well, after liberation, I know now that she was taken to -- to Poland to live with a\nfamily and as the years go by now and we start to hear about some of her experiences,\nand I\u2019m going back only to 1985, because before then, Irene and I never talked about it --\nand I mean never. [ringing]",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. So then slowly, in 1985, she let us know, even though we knew -- I\nknew from records that she had been taken into Poland and she spent some very, very\nunpleasant, indeterminate num-number of months with a Polish family that -- right now I\ncan almost surely say abused her, in terms of her being a child who was taken into a\nhome to be taken care of. I think she was more like a servant, made to do things. Some of\nthe things that she tells me are -- later on were to -- were to really go back, return to the\nsite of Auschwitz and -- and hunt for the -- for some valuables in terms of gold -- gold\nteeth or what -- whatever. But not -- not the kind of home that you would expect a child\nwould get. So -- and the stories that she has, I think are locked in her and perhaps one day\nPll find out myself, more about it. But then -- then she was rescued from there by -- by a\nrescue organization -- rescue child organization from United States, that actually made it\na point, because they knew that a lot of the Polish families would grab -- grab children\nand a lot of the Polish had hidden children that really didn\u2019t belong to them, but -- they\nwere Jewish children and this being a Jewish oriented organization, they wanted to\nextricate the Jewish children from there and they went into a lot of trouble in terms of\nchecking birth records, birth certificates and so on. And when something didn\u2019t quite\nmatch up in a family, they would know that they had a Jewish child and they took the\nJewish child out. And from there she went to -- when she was taken out, she was taken --\nas far as I know, to -- to France, to an orphanage in France.",
        "A: Rescue child. Herbert Tenzer was an active member. There\u2019s a rabbi that lives and\nstill -- Rabbi Fourhand, that I\u2019ve met here on the West Side -- I\u2019ve gone to his little\nsynagogue a few times, he was also very active and he remembered me and he even has a\npicture of us kids and he\u2019s a very sweet man and obviously there were a lot of people\ninvolved in this organization and this is how Irene got here.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m living in -- in the -- with Maun family in -- in -- in Kosheetza, and I have to\njust mention a few things about them. Mrs. Maun, Edith Maun was a -- was a wonderful\nwoman. She somehow had the understanding of what a boy should be or what a boy\nwould like and there in that home, I first saw candles -- Friday night candles. And from\nthat home I was also, for the first time taking in -- taken into a synagogue. I don\u2019t know if\nit was Orthodox -- it most probably was, cause Conservative and Reform were not born\nyet -- I don\u2019t believe were being practiced publicly in the little town of Kosheetza. And I\nremember being there on holidays, being dressed special. Not being inside the synagogue\nall that much, but I do remember having a lot of fights with the boys outside in the\ncourtyard, we were throwing the chestnuts at ea -- at each other. But Mrs. Maun, getting\nback to her, cause I -- I have to just say some things about her that she understood so\nwell. She knew that I wanted to play -- be a boy, be a real boy. And she managed\nsomehow to -- to -- to get a bicycle for me. And it wasn\u2019t a child\u2019s bicycle, was a man\u2019s\nbicycle and I was smaller than a normal child, even for my age. So, to learn to ride this\nthing -- I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever seen a child riding a man\u2019s bicycle. The foot goes\nunderneath the bar and holding on for dear life and you\u2019re peddling just totally sideways,\nbut I managed to do it and she knew that this was important to me and she -- she -- she\ntrained me and she made me learn how to do this and I did it and I was very proud of it.\nWith her and her other children, I also went ice skating on the river, where -- when it was\nfrozen. And it -- 1t was a river, I knew that, because many times you could see the water\nflowing underneath, perhaps the ice wasn\u2019t thick enough for us, but we went on it\nanyway. What I do remember about the ice skates was that you would just screw these\nthings onto your normal regular shoes, because we didn\u2019t have special shoes for skating,\nwe just -- those were our -- our shoes and we just forced them onto our feet and there was\na special key and they would just lock onto the shoes and we\u2019d be skating. I don\u2019t think I\never told that story to anyone, but it\u2019s wa -- some of the things I remember from there.\nAlso, somewhere along the line, after this bicycle episode, somebody obtained for me, a\nvery fancy -- they call it a jek -- there\u2019s a kolabeshka, but I think it\u2019s a -- I don\u2019t even\nknow what the English word for it is here. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s some wheels, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a platform, a\nwheel on the back and the front and then there\u2019s a stand, what do you call that, a -- I\u2019m at\na loss, totally at a loss. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s got a wheel on the front, wheel on the back and\nhandlebars coming out from the bottom of it.",
        "A: It\u2019s like a scooter kind of a thing.",
        "A: One foot, yes. You push with one foot. But this was a very fancy model, so I suspect\nsomehow America had something to do with it, because it had a spring on the back,\nspring on the front and a brake on -- in the back, which you just press and it would just\nsort of hold against the rear wheel. That turned out to be my means of locomotion in -- in\n-- in Kosheetza. And I was seen through the streets, I mean I was really fast with -- at\nleast I thought I was very fast, I was -- was my -- my vehicle to -- my escape wagon, my\nlittle scooter. Was red, chrome, beautiful little thing.",
        "A: Probably. Probably the first time, probably the first time. And thanks to Mrs. Maun, I\nhave to give her that credit, she -- she knew that I needed this -- something and 1-1t was\nwonderful. She -- she -- she gave it to me, it was wonderful.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. They were younger than I, much younger and I could tell that from\nthe pictures even now. So we didn\u2019t really play as equals. We played as children would\nplay with each other, living in the same home. I do remember Otto being sort of a -- he\nwasn\u2019t as sports oriented and as outgoing and -- and as devilish as I was. He wouldn\u2019t --\nnever try that bicycle that I had tried and there were a lot of things that he wouldn\u2019t do.\nSo that factor and the fact that he was much younger, didn\u2019t allow us to really play a lot\ntogether. And then there was Beebe, she was a little baby girl and -- what does a te -- nine\nyear old, 10 year old have to do with a baby girl? Nothing. So there wasn\u2019t much there,\nbut duf -- I did feel a real family there, because Mr. Maun was a -- he\u2019s a very quiet but\nvery strong man. He was a dental technician, yes. And Mrs. Maun was an outspoken\nlady, but very strong also and together they -- they ruled this family and I felt some\nstructure, real structure there.",
        "A: Well, it was while I lived with them, that we start to get communiqu\u00e9s from -- from\nthe States, that there were people looking for me. And also, at the same time, we were\nsomehow connected to the people in -- to my uncle in Germany. And there was sort of\ntalk, letting it known -- be known that I might be going to -- to one of these places, that\nI'd be leaving them. And I -- there wa -- it was just talk and it didn\u2019t really phase me one\nway or the other, it was just talk. The -- the first thing that did happen, though as -- as a\nmovement away from the Maun family -- at one point in time, I do remember going with\n-- I\u2019m not quite sure now whether it was both of them or just one of them, the parents --\nthey were taking me to the -- to the border of Czechoslovakia and Germany, where I was\nto be met and taken to Germany. But we got to the border and somehow it never\nhappened. We came back. I suspect now, from what I can gather, that at the same time,\nthe Slotkin\u2019s somehow came on the scene and they, at this point had Irene, who was my\ntwin sister and I guess it seemed much more sensible to try and unite the two twins into a\nhome or just unite them, rather than keep them apart. So I came back into\nCzechoslovakia, back -- I mean I went back to Kosheetza with the Maun\u2019s and there we\nwaited until some move was made by the Slotkin\u2019s. And that -- that this happened, it\nhappened -- they had sent a Mr. Enright, who I think on his own right worked for -- for\nthe children, possibly for this organization, but he was specifically sent out to see if he\ncould find me. And he spent quite a few months -- over a year I think, maybe even two\nyears, looking for me until I was located. But there are lots of coincidences that I\u2019d like to\nmention -- I should mention -- that happened, which made this possible. In -- in 1947,\nLife Magazine ran an issue which depicted my twin sister Irene as sort of a poster girl\nfrom -- from France, with a boy, Charles Karro and somehow th-their publicity was to\nraise funds for this organization and for the orphanage and for the children\u2019s welfare care.\nThe Slotkins somehow got a hold of Irene, cause they were actively involved in helping\nwar orphans and they were very close friends to Herbert Tenzer also, who lived 1n th -- in\nthe same area that they lived in. And Irene came -- came to them. And that wasn\u2019t a --\nquick as I make it sound, she went through a couple of homes, but she ended up with\nthem and she told them that she had a brother somewhere. And so they started to look for\nme, realizing, I guess the importance -- as I think as a father now -- grandfather, I would\ndo the same thing -- I -- I -- I -- if I knew that I had in possession a child who had a twin,\nespecially from -- from that kind of a background, I would see if I -- if I could do\nsomething, especially since they were able to do this. So they started looking for me.\nNow the Life Magazine that I mentioned before, this Life Magazine was obviously read\nby more than just the United States, but it -- 1t was read by people in Europe and in Israel,\nwhere Dr. Kalina was at the time. He saw the article and he realized that Irene Guttman,\nwho was mentioned, I think, in the article as Guttman, maybe even Renata, I\u2019m not sure\nnow. Renata or Irene, but Guttman was the -- was the name which I was under and the\ntwin story and all that. So he made the connection and he said, \u201cI have this twin, I have\nthe brother. I know where the brother 1s.\u201d So contacts were made and I was located in\nKosheetza and then came the -- the red tape of getting me out, getting a -- I -- I look at it\nnow and I laughing, I wa -- that little orphan, took them two years to get me out and even\nonce I got here, I still had to go back once -- back into Germany, but that -- that\u2019s just a\nside issue of mine. But it took two years of red tape to get me out. I must say that in the\ntime I spent in getting ready for it and the travel and -- and in France and -- I went to\nschool in Switzerland. Went -- had to go to Frankfort and then once I got here, I had --\nwas returned back to Frankfort again. Was a red tape kind of a thing, I had to appear just\nfor a weekend in Frankfort and then come back. But each one of these is -- is a little story\nby itself. My s -- my stay in France, my -- my trip to France. My stay in -- in Switzerland.\nThey\u2019re all little stories and I\u2019ll be glad to tell you if you\u2019d like to hear about it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: I don\u2019t really know why. That could have been it, possibly because I was a Jewish\ndisplaced child and I was oriented to go or my -- the easiest way to get me out was to get\nme -- get me a visa to the newly created state of Israel. And since I was headed for Israel,\nAmerica was not the way to go. It wa -- would have been a stopover, but it wasn\u2019t the\nfinal destination, so the -- these things didn\u2019t quite match, so they had to make them\nmatch. I think that\u2019s what made it so difficult. There are other difficulties too. They\nweren\u2019t legal, political maneuvers, but I -- I think that\u2019s truly -- the Mauns really cared\nfor me. I mean I -- I think I spent -- I ha -- \u2019'm guessing, but I think I spent at least three\nyears with them. And I think that, in that time frame, I could see me falling in love with a\nchild that I took care of three years, even if the child wasn\u2019t the best child in the world.\nWhich I\u2019m sure I wasn\u2019t, but I guess I was cute enough, judging from the pictures. I\nseemed to get along and obviously she showered me -- they showered me with their --\nwith their caring and I -- I remembered it\u2019s -- obviously there was a good relationship. I\nmean, so there are other things in play, but I think they realize that -- that my place would\nbe -- I'll be better off in the long run with my sister in America. So, that was one issue. I -\n- | think that the Kalinas, who were in a -- who made the connection and originally took\nme out of the orphanage also weren\u2019t quite sure whether to send me into this unknown\nand they had some say, because I was staying with their sister. So, I guess there was a\nlittle bit of negotiation going on there, on -- on an -- on an adult level, which I wasn\u2019t\nprivy to, so I -- I really can\u2019t tell you about that. As far as I was -- I was ready to go. I had\nsome things which I unfortunately had to leave behind. I was an avid book reader and if I\nremember correctly, I don\u2019t think there were any libraries in Kosheetza, so whenever I\nwanted a book, I had to save for it and I had to buy it. So they became my personal\npossessions and I had quite a few of them and there were a few that -- they were\nAmerican, or at least you\u2019d recognize them. James Fenimore Cooper, \u201cThe Last of the\nMohicans\u201d was one of the books that I had translated -- that was translated into -- into\nSlovak and I was able to read that, so I was totally familiar with -- with the story. There\nwas one word I -- that comes to mind, which I could never understand in -- in the west, it\nwas greenhorn. The word greenhorn, I -- I just didn\u2019t know what it was. I know it wasn\u2019t\na complimentary sort of a thing, but I could never understand it until I came to the States\nmany, many years later, I learned what the true meaning of the word greenhorn was.\nThere were other books that I loved. Jules Verne was my -- one of my favorite authors,\nscience fiction. There\u2019s another man, Carrol May. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s -- hits anybody,\nbut I mentioned it to a few people and apparently it hasn\u2019t, but I read some of his books.\n\u201cRobinson Crusoe\u201d was also one of my most favorite books.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Uh-huh, uh-huh.",
        "A: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: Right, right so --",
        "A: Carl -- Carl May, yeah so maybe that\u2019s -- that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about, but then I --\nthese we -- these books, these were my treasures and I was told that I couldn\u2019t really take\nthem with me. I remember I could take only very little. And I don\u2019t -- can\u2019t understand\nwhy, but I -- I didn\u2019t even have a suitcase to take, I only had a briefcase that I could fill\nup and the books were not the most important thing, even though I tried. I wanted to\nreally take some books with me, but it just didn\u2019t go. So that was one of my losses. Took\nawhile to get used to.",
        "A: Right. Well, my first -- when I first left Czechoslovakia, it was -- I was alone on a\nplane to Paris. I was met by Mr. Enright -- his secretary, a lady, don\u2019t remember her\nname, but Mr. Enright played a real big role in my life for the next -- oh, at least half a\nyear. He -- we -- we were in Paris together. I remember we stayed at the Grand Hotel and\nnow we were sort of closer to the Slotkins, away from the Mauns and I\u2019Il never forget the\nfirst ttme they made a telephone connection with the Slotkins, I -- I hid under the bed. I\ndidn\u2019t want to somehow respond or talk, even though I knew about them, I knew who\nthey were. I mean, didn\u2019t know about them, but I knew they were the Slotkins, who --\nwhere my sister was. But I was just totally shaken up by this. I\u2019m not even sure whether I\ntalked to them that one time. But we lived in Switzerland together and -- I mean in -- in\nParis together and there he would carry on during the day, doing his thing, whatever he\nhad to do to get clearances for me and whatnot. And he engaged a teacher for me at the\ntime, to teach me -- start teaching me Slovak. And part of the education was to go ahead\nand see as many foreign movies -- American movies, also English movies, so I would get\nused to -- I\u2019m sorry, I have to take all that back, not to teach me Slovak, to teach me\nEnglish. And part of this whole thing was to take me to see English movies. And one of\nthe first movies that I remember was \u201cLassie Come Back.\u201d Elizabeth Taylor, she was a\ngirl at the time, a very beautiful girl, blue eyes, black hair, white skin. And there was this\nbeautiful black horse. No, no, that\u2019s \u201cBlack Beauty\u2019, that\u2019s another one that I saw. But\n\u201cLassie\u201d was the first one. Also, there were cowboy movies I saw -- if I can try to\nremember some of those old names. That was way before Hopalong Cassidy came on the\nscene, it was -- oh, maybe I\u2019ll remember later. But that was part of it, Laurel and Hardy\nwas certainly part of it. Abbott and Costello. These were movies I went to see, just to get\nthe feel of the language and -- and with the help of this tutor, I sort of somehow got\nmyself started in English. I don\u2019t know how -- what I really achieved other than I was\nexposed to it. It seemed that though, that Mr. Enright didn\u2019t have much luck in getting\nwhatever papers were necessary to get me over here right away, so -- there was -- and he\ncouldn\u2019t spend any more time or something like that, so I had to be brought somewhere,\nput away somewhere -- who to leave we -- me with. So it was decided to send me to -- to\nSwitzerland, to a boarding school. Institute Usher, in Balaban, which was Jewish oriented\nI\u2019m sure, because the headmaster of the school had a beard and a yarmulke and I do\nremember Friday night services, now that I think about it and we always stood up to La\nhoda di lacross kallor, which is one of the prayers that we say in our Friday nights also,\nbut we sit down, where we always stood there. Now I know why I stand. I always stand,\nfor some reason, La hoda di lacross kallor, sa -- sa -- about two pages responsive kind of\nreading on Friday night. But most people sit down. I always stand. There are a few other\npeople that stand, but now I know where I got it from. They always stood over there.\nThat was Switzerland. And that was a -- that was a really, really wonderful experience. I\nwent skiing there. I do remember going skiing. We would get on to buses, which would\ntake us, even though it was a rainy, cloudy day, would take -- they would -- the buses\nwould take us into the mountains, above the clouds, into bright blue skies and sunshine\nand we would ski. The school also has other -- lots of good memories. At this point, I had\nthe funds, now I had the backer -- a rich backer in America, my sister and her -- her\nfuture adoptive parents. So I had some money, I had some credit, come to think of it, it\nwasn\u2019t even money, I had credit at the school office where I could buy candy. I\nremember it was a very specific kind of a marshmallow chocolate covered candy, very\ndelicious. One other thing about the school, which I remember very, very clearly. We\nlived in a dorm -- in dormitory -- rooms and every morning we went to the showers in\nanother building, while it was still dark and cold sometimes -- very, very cold. So we ran\nthrough whatever yard there was in our nightclothes and into these showers, which were\nsomehow automatically regulated. You get into them -- they lasted only so long, the\nwater started from lukewarm to warm and then it slowly start to cool. So you had to do\nyour thing. You had to get soaped up and you had to get clean and still try and enjoy\nsome of the warmth that was left after you\u2019ve done what you had to do. But, that it ran\ncold and if you were brave enough, you stayed in. And it turned out to be a lot of kids did\nstay in, most of us did. And it sort of -- it was a very healthy thing to do, because I don\u2019t\never remember being sick. None of them ever got sick and we ran wet -- half wet into our\n-- into our rooms from -- from the bathhouse. I do -- that was something I remember\nagain about my stay in Switzerland. There I learned also -- there they put me on a\nprogram to learn Hebrew. So I started writing, copying things in Hebrew, even though I\nhad no idea what I was -- what I was saying, but writing, copying things in Hebrew and\ntrying to pronounce some of the things, Hebrew started then for me.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m sure that my parents spoke German to one another. Czech will be the other.\nOh definitely, Czech definitely. As a matter of fact, when I -- when I came to the States, I\ndid manage to sneak out one book -- yes, I had one book called \u201cOatsa lubby luge.\u201d I\ndon\u2019t even remember what it -- actual -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a ray, some metallic ray, was a ship of\nsome kind. But I did my first book report on a -- in the United States, on a book that I\nread in Czech and I guess the teacher trusted me that I wasn\u2019t going to distort the story\ntoo much and I wrote a book report on it, in English for my first school book report here.\nSo, Czechoslo -- Czech was the other language, Hebrew, of course, start to come in very\nstrong and English, which I had to communicate in. And Russian, which I took in -- in --\nin -- in Czechoslovakia and Kosheetza, which I had to take. So -- and whatever language\nwas spoken in -- in Auschwitz, which was many, many languages. They\u2019 re --",
        "A: Probably -- posht -- at least five languages.",
        "A: Switzerland was my last stop, I think, before I came here. On the way, we went back\nto -- to Paris, I think that\u2019s where we boarded a plane to come to the United States. Was a\nbig, big plane. I think it was the double-decker -- propeller driven plane, but it was a\ndouble decker, was one of the first. And we landed at Idlewild Airport, which is now\nKennedy Airport. Idlewild Airport was nothing but a long Quonset hut with -- with dirt\non the ground and you just had sections which designated the different airlines. I\nremember the night, 1t was a night -- March -- March 29th, 1950 and my mother came to\npick me up -- my mother -- Mrs. Mey -- Mrs. Dinah Slotkin. It comes very easy to say\nmy mother to her. And came with Mr. Enright and it was evening, it was raining -- misty\nrain. And I don\u2019t think I saw my sister that evening, yet, because it was -- must have been\ntoo late, she must have been asleep already and I remember that we were told to sleep in\nthe master bedroom and M-Mr. Enright, like we slept in the hotels, he slept in one bed, I\nslept in the other bed and the following morning I met my sister in front of the house and\nno words were spoken, none. Just looked at each other. I knew who she was, she knew\nwho I was, that was it. We were reunited in 1950, in Orange, Long Island, New York.",
        "A: We wrote some letters, but th-they were newsy kind of things. Well, as I said, we truly\ncommunicated -- we didn\u2019t even communicate truly til 1985, when we touched our\nparents, our backgrounds, our past. We communicate yes, superficially, on the level that,\nyou know, what -- where you going, what are you doing. We went to the same school\ntogether. We -- we grew up together, we took dance lessons together, we -- we ate at the\nsame table f -- we had the same family, but truly, truly, to find out what she\u2019s really,\nreally thinking, what really went on, we -- we didn\u2019t start to really do until 1985 in\nJerusalem.",
        "A: Well, they were -- the Slotkins were fairly well-to-do, I guess, so they had a home. I\nhad my own room, which was different than the -- what I\u2019ve had before, although I had\nprivacy in -- in the slo -- in the Maun house. They -- they recognize that I needed the\nprivacy. Here I had my own bedroom, my own furniture, my own desk, my own chair.\nOne of the first things that they did was to get me a bicycle. Again bicycle. Pretty\nimportant, I guess, to a -- to a 12 year old. And they were giving me everything that they\nthought I didn\u2019t have -- physically, materially. I think that they -- they both were very\nintelligent people. They gave me everything they knew how to give me. How -- what --\ntheir best of ability, they gave me whatever they could. Whether they were like real\nparents -- because this question I ask myself, Pll never know. I\u2019ll never know what it\u2019s\nlike to really have a real parent. What do you owe a real parent? What sort of honor you\nowe a parent when they\u2019re -- when you know that they\u2019re not yours, really, when you\nmeet them first when you\u2019re 12 years old or when you -- when you know that they\u2019re\nyour real blood? That\u2019s the question I -- it\u2019s a question. It\u20191l remain a question, I don\u2019t\nknow. I don\u2019t imagine it\u2019s the same thing, because I -- otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be asking\nwhy -- all these questions. So there must be some difference, but I -- I must say that they\ndid everything to their maximum ability -- capability to make us happy, even though I\nthink that -- looking back now, that they made some mistakes, but the -- for example, at\none point, German government was -- was ready or somehow in the news to -- to -- they\nwere ready to give some reparation to -- some financial aid to -- or -- or -- make some\nreparations to Holocaust victims. And yet -- or even -- but they didn\u2019t want to have\nanything to do with it, they totally shielded us from the fact, protected us. They didn\u2019t\nwant us to associate the facts that we had that sort of a background and -- they just didn\u2019t\nwant to. There were people who wanted to write books about, very famous Jewish\nauthor, escapes my -- my memory right now, but he wanted to write a book about us. But\nthey didn\u2019t want to dig up any of the old memories and they totally shielded Irene and\nmyself from anything. So they sign -- signed away some of the rights that we might have\nhad and I think that was a mistake, in a sense, because sooner or later, we would grow up\nand we did grow up and we do question these things and -- and we feel that we have a\nresponsibility to our past and therefore to the future. And we have a responsibility to our\nown children and these things should be known. It\u2019s not something to hide, to be\nashamed of. It happened. It happened and -- and you have to admit it that it happened and\nwe have to bring it to the forefront if you want to learn something from it. So, I think\nthey made a big mistake in that -- in that sense.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: Well, I -- I -- I -- we did go to Hebrew school, Yeshiva schools. My sister, as I recall,\ncovered her number with a cosmetic at all times. It was not talked about. I -- I don\u2019t think\nthe Jewish community on the whole was ready to even talk about it. They were still in a\nstate of shock. I mean historically speaking, it just happened and -- and they were not\nready to talk about it or to discuss it and I think that, in the very beginning, my sister\nmight have even felt ashamed. Incredible as that may seem. I -- I think I felt a little bit of\nthat, too. I did not always expose my number freely. It was always a sign of a Jew and in\n-- the sign of a Jew in Europe was not a good sign, it\u2019s something to -- a low sign,\nsomething to be ashamed of. It wasn\u2019t something that you were proud of. Today I -- I\u2019m\nvery proud of it and I feel very lucky that I\u2019m a survivor of this thing. But at that time, it -\n- it was not. So in school, I think the teachers knew about us. I think the community knew\nabout us. But very few really discussed it with us. I think they treated us gently because\nof it, but I don\u2019t -- nobody ever talked about it, it was not -- 1t was a taboo subject and I\nthink Slotkins most probably made a contribution to that, but they were just like the rest\nof the people. They would not want to talk about -- this 1s something -- let\u2019s -- let\u2019s --\nlet\u2019s give them what they missed, let\u2019s shield them, let\u2019s -- let\u2019s forget about it. And I\nthink a lot of parents did this to their children that were linked closely to the Holocaust. I\nthink they did it to their offsprings. Why should they -- why should they suffer, why\nshould they know about this? Just looking back, I -- I don\u2019t think that was exactly the\nright thing, but it was understandable.",
        "A: No, I -- I -- I felt -- I had no trouble. I really had no trouble getting to like the\nAmerican things. The television -- I played basketball -- I was high school basketball, I\nlearned to drive the day I turned 16. I had always a car that I could borrow from my\nmother or my father. I didn\u2019t have my own car, but I mean I could always borrow a car\nand there were parties and I was a very social and outgoing -- it wasn\u2019t though, with --\nwith the public school crowd, it was with the -- the Jewish crowd. But that Jewish crowd\nwasn\u2019t anywhere -- the Yeshiva crowd wasn\u2019t anywhere near as observant as -- as the\nJewish Yeshivas are today. In other words, the Jewish high school then, there was\nnothing -- nobody thought very badly about having dance classes -- social learning, how\nto do social dancing with boys and girls together and in those days social dancing meant\ntouching one another. Now this I think would be totally looked upon as a no-no in\ntoday\u2019s age in -- in the high school -- Yeshiva high school. Because I know my -- my\ndaughter goes to a high school -- a girl\u2019s high school. [telephone ringing]\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Yeah, dancing would have been a real, real difference that I recall. We did sort of\nhave classes with the girls. We did social things with the girls, we attended parties.\nDating, in my circles was a allowed thing. Today in -- in -- in the Jewish world, Jewish\nhigh schools, even though boys and girls have contact, it\u2019s not for the purpose of dating\nand having fun with each other. Because that is not really looked upon as a -- as a serious\nrelationship which will go anywhere, at this point. I mean, how far can it go when you\u2019re\n15 - 16 years old? So, there\u2019s -- I think, a lot of wisdom in what goes on in -- in -- in --\nand obviously my background is showing -- in -- in what the Yeshiva world of today\nexpects from their kids and I -- I agree with it 100 percent. But I think at the time, I fit in\nvery well. I think looking back now and having met survivors over the years, I think --\nmyself personally -- I\u2019m not even going to speak for Irene, but I think my thinking and I\nturn out to be as -- as normal, if there is such a thing as normal, as one could be. Much\nmore so than some of the others that I\u2019ve met and I\u2019ve met most of them, especially in\nIsrael in 1985, when we had a -- a convention to have a mock trial for Dr. Mengele and I\nmet -- were twins from all over the world and I must say that maybe five percent are what\nI would consider normal at the time. But again, I\u2019m speaking for myself and how normal\nam I? So I think my adjustment to American life was -- was -- was easy.",
        "A: I started out in the Hebrew Institute of Long Island. This is in Far Rockaway. They\nthen, as we finished the eighth grade, they built a high school and so I was the first class\nof that Hebrew Institute High School. And it was a very small school, because we were\nthe first class and there were, I think, only 11 of us, inc -- my sister was one of them --\nfirst senior class. But that was a good thing, because we were always the seniors, we were\nalways the eldest. And we got to do everything that needed to be done for high school.\nWe always managed to play basketball. We were the first string. I mean, we played\nagainst seniors I remember distinctly, in the Yeshiva High School Leagues and we were\ntrampled. But we had a good time. We had all the American things that the other high\nschools had. We had a basketball team, we had a coach, we had uniforms. We had\ncheerleaders. My -- Irene was a cheerleader. She had a cheerleaders uniform on. She was\ndancing around, she was a cheerleader. And it was -- it was a fun time, it was a easy time.\nIt was -- no, it wasn\u2019t easy, because we were growing up and growing up, I guess, is not\nan easy thing to do. You\u2019re facing the future and here I was, in a -- what seemed the lap\nof luxury. What do I have to worry about? I remember my father saying, \u201cYou have to\npick a profession. You have to become a professional.\u201d And I was fighting it. \u201cWhat do I\nhave to do this for?\u201d I remember. \u201cI don\u2019t have to be a professional. I have -- we have\neverything we need. What do I have to be a professional for?\u201d So it was -- 1t was growing\nup, I think with the similar problems that all of America grows up. It was not -- it was\nonly clouded in the back scene by the fact where we came from. And I guess my parents\nkept that in mind. I didn\u2019t really focus on it. I was too busy having a good time.",
        "A: I did not become a professional. I won and maybe lost. Well, the -- the problem was\nthat -- again, here I have to -- and I hope I\u2019m not faulting, pointing at my father, but he --\nto him professional meant you were a doctor, a lawyer or an accountant. That\u2019s it. I\nwould have loved to have become a math teacher. But that wasn\u2019t the big three. So I\nsettled for things in between. Accounting courses, this kind of courses, business, bachelor\nof this and -- so I never be -- really became a professional. But I was -- I was having a\ngood time. Even while in college, I was having a good time. Whereas my sister was a\nstudent. I\u2019m sure that she would agree now, that she should have maybe had a little bit\nmore fun than be a student, but here we were, living in the same house, twins, somewhat\nsimilar backgrounds, yet, because of who she was -- and maybe she was -- she was shyer,\nmore introverted. She would turn to her books for -- to occupy her time, study. That\u2019s\nhow she gained her strength. Whereas I got my strength through dating, playing ball and\ndoing all the things that young teenagers do.",
        "A: I -- I -- no, I never had any trouble with people. I\u2019ve always had close friends, both\nsexes. Girls -- very close girlfriend, not the kind that you take on a date on, but very close\nfriend. And I had very close boy friends. No, I -- I never had any trouble. I -- I consider\nmyself -- even today I consider myself a very personable, friendly sort of a chap.",
        "A: Well, after college -- this was like 1958 - \u201859. \u201859 is more I think the year. There was a\nwar on that the United States was involved in and th-the draft was still in full swing. And\nI was seriously seeing a girl. I was, I think 21. 20 - 21, something like that. And my life at\nhome, I think because of this friction of, \u201cYou will be a professional or it\u2019s not going to\nwork for you too well.\u201d I -- I have to admit as an -- as an ol-older person, like 19, older\nteenager, there -- there was friction in the house, because -- and I think that\u2019s a normal\nkind of a thing, I think kids want to -- tend to get up and do their own thing and -- and f-\nfly out on their own. I -- I -- I was married. I got married to this girl, despite objections of\nmy parents. Now, she came from the same community, but not on the same observant\nlevel as I was. Her father was an attorney. I mean, intelligent people, but they were just\nnot on the same observant level. Now this was very important to my -- my family, my --\nthe Slotkins. I -- I didn\u2019t realize -- I don\u2019t realize until today how important something\nlike that really is to parents. But I also know -- and I think he realized also, that there\u2019s\nnot all that much that he could do -- if these two young people wanted to get married,\nthey were going to do it. So, 1t happened, with everybody\u2019s blessings and we were\nmarried. But, at that same time, I was -- I notice -- I -- I was notified by the draft that my\nturn had come and at the time, I think the only way you could be excused, exempt from\nservice was if -- if your wife was pregnant, you were about to become a father, or some\nof the other usual things. If you were the sole caretaker of somebody, your family,\nwhatnot. But none of these things applied to me, so they were going to draft me for two\nyears, send me over somewhere and -- to fight in a war. Now, when I told my family\nabout this and my friends, they all said, \u201cYou? In a war? At this point in your life? What\nare you -- there\u2019s no way -- no way you can go. There\u2019s no way they\u2019 ll take you if you\neven -- if you tell them what your background is and that you can\u2019t do it.\u201d But I -- I never\n-- I listened to what they said, but I never took advantage of that -- sort of -- of that\nsituation, 1n -- in the sense that I would use it as an excuse. I didn\u2019t want to go into a war\nor anything like that, either. To me, at the time, the only thing that was really worth dying\nfor, was maybe the Jewish state. But I -- I wasn\u2019t going to fight the United States -- I\nwasn\u2019t going to fight being inducted or anything like that on the basis of -- that \u2019ma\nsurvivor from Auschwitz and I have this and I have bad this when I really didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t\nwant to go, but I -- I was going to submit to it. So I did the next best thing, I joined a six\nmonths -- which for me was the best thing -- I joined a six months active unit and then I\nwas in the reserve for the next seven years, which means going to meetings throughout\nthe year and every summer for two years I had to go to Camp Drum, upstate New York to\ntrain and whatnot. So I -- I joined the National Guard and I was inducted into the army at\nFort Dix, New Jersey, had my basic training there, went through all the bologna. But, I\nmaintained a strict kosher Jewish front. I had the strength to do that. I wore my yarmulke,\nI refused any food, I refused to work on Saturdays. But I was a good soldier. I did\neverything I was supposed to do. And it worked. I was really -- I saw the difference that -\n- between people, for the first time, I -- I got some respect from some people when I did\nthe thing the right way. My commander was -- was very proud of me. Here, I had this --\nthey were talk -- I heard them talking, the commanders talk about their Jews that they had\nin their -- in their -- in their units, who were giving them trouble in terms of not wanting\nto work on Saturdays, not wanting to eat the food in the mess hall, wearing a hat which\nwas against army regulations and so on. So, he was very proud of me. My Slotkin, he\u2019s a\nsharpshooter. I was a sharpshooter. But I went strictly by the laws, the -- at the time, in\nNew Jersey, Fort Dix, they had a chaplain, chaplain -- a Lieutenant Colonel Angle, I\nthink was his name. But he had made a set of rules for all the observant Jews. If they\nwant to maintain their observance while they\u2019re in the army, they have to follow the rules\nto the letter, not deviate, they\u2019ll be no deviation. Everybody had to do exactly the same\nthing. And it worked. I mean, I was respected, I -- Friday afternoon the -- the truck came\nto the fields, picked me off -- cleaned my rifle and they sent me either home or I was put\naway into -- into -- into the chapel which was used on Saturday for the Jews, on Sunday\nfor the -- for the non-Jews, but I was away for Saturday. And it -- it never ran into a\nproblem, except for some of the unintelligent people who -- who didn\u2019t know what\nJewish was or what a yarmulke was or what kosher food was and they almost -- some of\nthe southern sergeants, they almost looked for horns under my hat, every once in awhile.\nI mean, there was a lot of ignorance, stupidity and whatnot out there and -- and outrage\nreally. When some of them -- when they saw the number and this 1s now early fi -- late\n50\u2019s, not that far from the war -- should know what -- what the -- nothing. Totally\nignorant and not sensitive to -- to the issues. But I went through the -- through the army\nand my first son was born while I was in the army. So, if they had had more sensitive\ntests at the time, we most probably could have proved that my wife was pregnant and I\nwouldn\u2019t have had to go through this, but I consider it a -- a valuable experience. So,\nwhen army jokes come up, I know exactly what everybody\u2019s talking about. No, army is --\nis -- was a part of life and -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m not all that unhappy that I had to go through it. It\nwas a big waste, but I -- I recognize where -- where army has to be 1n readiness. You\nhave to have defense forces, any country has to have defense forces and the only way to\nhave it 1s to have trained people and the only way to train them 1s to -- even -- you know,\nis to train them. And you have to participate, so -- 1t\u2019s a given -- given. It\u2019s too bad that\nwe have such things 1n the first place, but I went through it.",
        "A: Well, as I -- as I said, the -- the mess hall sergeants, from -- from down south or -- I\nshouldn\u2019t really say south, they were from all over. If they were ignorant, they were\nignorant and they would not have the sensitivity to -- to even understand -- yo -- it\u2019s just\ntalking to -- to -- to a -- somebody totally out of this world, they would say, \u201cWhat would\nyou do if somebody was shooting at you?\u201d Well, of course the answer is you\u2019d most\nprobably shoot them back, even if it was the Sabbath. And if you had to survive, to eat --\nour religion teaches us you have to do anything to survive, so you\u2019|l eat non-kosher. But\nthis was peace-time New Jersey, not too far away from kosher hotels, where you could\nhave -- and there\u2019s just no need for it. They didn\u2019t understand that -- this duality, that the\n-- that you could be a human being, you don\u2019t have to turn yourself into a total animal,\neven though this is what the army -- well, this is what the army really teaches. They try to\nbreak your spirit. They break your spirit when they br-bring you in. They give you a\nhaircut, make you look like -- tot -- take your individuality away. They give you a\nnumber and they give you a tag and they ca -- you know, they -- they -- they -- they do\nthis for a reason, so you\u2019 ll stop questioning. But I think at the same time, when you stop\nquestioning, you lose sensitivity. So, you have to be very careful with that. So -- it\nhappened many times, I was -- you know, my hat was -- my hat -- my yarmulke. I\nwouldn\u2019t wear a hat, because that -- that would be totally against rule -- but the little\nyarmulke, knocked off my head by a sergeant. There was -- there\u2019s no need for that sort\nof thing. But, of course he didn\u2019t know where I was coming from. Maybe if he did,\nmaybe he would have acted differently. But, my friends -- my -- that I -- that I -- in my\nunit, not necessarily Jewish, they knew about me, because we talked. I mean we saw each\nother in the showers, they knew I had a number and they asked about it. And when I told\nthem about it, they were absolutely shocked. They were shocked that I was even in the\narmy. They couldn\u2019t believe that I was in the army. But they took care and I took ca --\nmy care and we -- we did the thing that we had to do. I was fine.",
        "A: If lremember correctly, it was \u201861 or \u201862. I think \u201c61 -- 1961 I think it was.",
        "A: I -- Zebbe. Actually, his name on the birth certificate reads Randolf, but he became\nknown to us as Zebbe, that\u2019s what everybo -- and he likes to be called Zebbe and he\u2019s my\neldest, my firstborn and he was born while I was at the army.",
        "A: [have four. Three with my first wife, whom I divorced -- we were divorced seven\nyears after our marriage, we had -- there were three children. Zebbe, oldest, David came\nnext -- 20 months later. And then Corrie, my daughter, she came what -- two years later.\nSo that\u2019s the first -- my first marriage and then I have Mia with my second wife of now\n25 years. And I must say that when you have a child when you\u2019re a little bit older, it\u2019s a\ntotally different experience, in terms of your output to her -- he -- your input from her to\nyou, it\u2019s a totally, totally different thing. You -- you understand, you have -- you\nappreciate so much more, you have -- so much more sensitive to what childbirth 1s all\nabout. And -- including the real, actual childbirth methods at the time, were totally\ndifferent. In the early 60\u2019s, the husband spent his time in the waiting room, smoking\ncigarettes -- which I did too, and the waiting for the doctor to emerge from -- from some\ndark hallway, wishing you congratulations or whatever. And you had no -- no role in it.\nWhen my -- Mia was born in 1982, I was part of the operating team, I was in the room, I\nwas helping my wife -- not with anything real, but just moral support and I was there and\nthe doctors wanted me there to give her that moral support. And it was a wonderful\nexperience, and a big difference.",
        "A: Well, it -- it -- it was difficult to develop something like this because when my first\nmarriage start to break up, and the kids were still pretty young. After seven years, my --\nthe oldest was maybe six and down the line of four, sometimes two years apart and then\ntwo more years apart. So, when that split took place -- first of all, community looked at\ndivorce differently than it does today. It was a -- almost a taboo kind of a situation,\nespecially in Orthodox circles. And obviously there was going to be a -- there was a -- an\nactual separation from me and my children. I did spend an awful lot of time with them,\nthough, while we were together and I think that always showed. And one of my\nstipulations to our separation agreement was that I must -- must have the children on --\non weekends. I mean, not every weekend, but there must be a time, I felt, when -- when\nthe father and his children have to live together like a family. Because visitation for two\nhours on a Sunday afternoon, I felt was an absolute waste of time. Maybe better not to\neven have it. Cause it would interfere too much. In the long run with -- kids have parties,\nkids have this to do. Why do you we have to w-wait until he picks us up to take us to a --\nI think life had to be lived together. An evening had to be spent, a -- a bath had to be\ngiven. Sa -- you know, you had to live together. So that was part of my sep-separation\nagreement, that I would have them at least two -- I think it was at least every other\nweekend and also in the summertime, I would have them for at least a month, full time.\nSo, my philosophy at the time, or what my goals were -- to try to make their lives as\nnormal as -- or as -- without too much change, which 1s very strange now that I\u2019m\nthinking about it. I had so much change, I tried to keep their lifestyle flowing, as it was\nbefore, when I was there. In other words, I tried to keep them in the same schools, in the\nsame environment, with the same friends. That was my -- my goal to do and try to keep\neverything as normal as -- as possible. Even keeled with me and so on. And I don\u2019t really\nknow, even now, to what extent I succeeded. I -- my two -- David and Corrie are married.\nMy oldest son is not married yet. So I always wonder -- 1s he not married because\nsomething I did? Did I put some guilt or did he s -- is he suffering from the divorce, or is\nhe suffering from second generation syndromes, which are very popular now, that\neverybody talks about -- I just wonder. But I -- I have to say that all three of them are\ntotally different individuals, I recognized it early in life. They had different interests.\nThey had to be treated differently, they were little, individual people. And when my\noldest son I -- I mean even when he start to -- when he became an adult, which I -- I term\nroughly after voting age, you know, I gave him more free reign. You can no longer\ndictate what he\u2019s to do and how to do it. You can advise, I realize that -- which is\nsomething I -- I think I learned in a negative way from my father, Meyer Slotkin, which\nhe didn\u2019t really allow me. But I allowed this, that it\u2019s his own -- it\u2019s going to be his life\nand I wish he would take my advice and this and that, but you know, you can\u2019t -- even\ntoday I can\u2019t -- I won\u2019t even get into a real hassle with my son about anything that he\nreally wants to do. We can talk about it, but we don\u2019t -- we don\u2019t confront each other. I\nwon\u2019t -- you know -- they\u2019Il be no confrontation. And my -- my -- my Mia, the lo-love of\nmy life, with the love of my life, June. I -- I -- I have to say about June, she is the best\nwoman in the world, my wife of 25 years. She helped me raise those three children. I\nmean she\u2019s -- it wasn\u2019t a sacrifice to her. She had them with me and we had them in our\nhouse. Now here she is, a woman, three children -- my children, they were not her\nchildren and I must say she treated them, she treated them as well as she treats Mia -- like\nin -- I have a source for comparison. She treated them as her own, as much as that was\npossible under the circumstances, for the weekends that we had and the summers that\nthey spent together. And I say they spent together -- she\u2019s a teacher, so they went out to --\nto a resort -- Fire Island, specifically speaking -- and they had a wonderful time. The kids\nstill talk about it. And I went to work most of the week -- I took a lot of time off also. I --\nI worked -- actually I did everything in reverse. I worked three days and the rest of the\ntime I spent out there. Right. I worked three days a week and the rest of the time I spent\nout there with them. We had a wonderful time as a family. We lived there as a family. It\nwas -- it was wonderful. And just brings to mind, my daughter Mia, whenever we show\npictures of -- of Fire Island and the -- June and myself and the three kids, she says, \u201cWell,\nwhere am I? Where am I?\u201d And we have to tell her that she wasn\u2019t on the scene yet, she\nwasn\u2019t even born yet. And -- but she -- she knows, she -- they were very close -- my\ndaughter Mia 1s very close with the three kids. They -- they know that they\u2019re brothers\nand sister. They\u2019re related and they -- they talk constantly, they keep in touch. And that\u2019s\none of the things that I -- now that we\u2019re talking about a little bit philosophy, I keep\ntelling my children, \u201cIn the long run, you only have each other to really depend on.\nYou\u2019re --\u201d And here comes this blood thing, I guess. \u201cYou\u2019re all related, blood related,\nyou have the same father -- same parentage.\u201d So, I keep stressing that and I -- and I think\nthat they know that, they understand it. They\u2019re all in touch with each -- with each other.\nAnd perhaps my son Zebbe was affected by that a little bit in a negative way. Maybe he\nfelt responsible for the two others and somehow he lost something of his own identity in\nit. But, I really can\u2019t worry about that, because that\u2019s not a healthy thing to do. It\u2019s his\nlife, he had all the options -- he has all the options -- he still does. I mean, he can do\nwhatever he wants, as long as he\u2019s behaving himself now. He ca -- he\u2019s -- he\u2019s a free\nman, he\u2019s -- he\u2019s a free man. My philosophy basically was to let them do, know that they\nshould depend on each other, stick together as a family. I never tried to push my -- my f -\n- my background into them. I never told them the stories, never force fed them. They --\nthey were starting to come out and ask. They started asking in 1985, when they first\nbecame aware. And my son Zebbe, especially now, he\u2019s -- he\u2019s truly into it. He really is\ninto the -- he\u2019s a photographer also, so he -- he does a lot with that. Somehow he\nmanages to express, he -- he took all the photos that we were able to get from Europe and\nhe arranged them, I have the albums here. And he sort of put meaning to them, I mean he\n-- he -- he\u2019s very meticulous and he tried to s -- you know, put them in chronological\norder and he -- I think he made an album for Irene, a copy for myself and he -- he\u2019s into -\n- he\u2019s into it. He watches all the latest on -- on Holocaust movies, \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u2019 for\nexample, he -- he -- he must have seen it many times. I saw it once. Very good film,\ncredit is due there, both from artistic point of view and from -- from a point of view\nauthenticity, even though some of the scenes, they were not quite real, as only I would\nknow. But the idea was very authentic and what took place was -- seemed very authentic.\nBut the scenes weren\u2019t quite as dirty as I remembered them and quite as bloody and -- but\ngood movie, good movie, so -- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s my philosophy with the -- with the kids.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: Bu -- I -- I assume that you mean because of my background, that -- that somehow\nthat would -- I would do a different take on it than a normal American?",
        "A: Just generally speaking? Well, I was always math and science minded and Jules Verne\nwas one of my -- one of my favorite authors, so when America finally landed on the\nmoon, I -- that was mind-boggling to me. I remember -- this is 1959 or \u201860, I\u2019m not su --\nquite sure, it was in that time frame, but -- was it that, or was it much later? Well,\nwhatever the time frame was -- I th-think it was late 60\u2019s, now that I\u2019m thinking about it,\nyeah, \u201869 was probably more like it, yeah. And that -- that was mind blowing to me. It\nwas a superb achievement, but at the same time, we -- we advanced so scientifically, I -- I\nknew there was so much -- so much suffering still going around the world. Even today,\n1997, 1-it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s mindboggling that somehow our -- our -- our scientific achievement\nhasn\u2019t matched our social growth or m-moral growth or what have you. Politics included.\nSo it -- as impressive as it was -- it was maybe a little disappointing also, that we had to --\nbut it was a race between Russia and the United States and we won.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Oh. My -- all three of the children, in fact all four of the children went to Israel. The\nthree children went after high school, they went for a year to study 1n Israel. It -- it was a\npopular thing, I guess, for parents to do and I felt it was an excellent vehicle for them to\nspend a time, to mature a little bit, to orient themselves and to know a little bit more what\nthey\u2019re doing. Which I didn\u2019t know what to do when I was finished with high school. I\nmean I truly didn\u2019t know what to do. And I felt it was a good maturing experience and\nalso, I secretly -- I almost felt, getting the reports from people who spent a year in Israel,\nthey never wanted to come back. I was sort of hoping that maybe something would --\nwould keep them there and somehow maybe I would end up there for -- going there. I --\nthat\u2019s still sort of a dream in the back of my mind, because somehow -- I know I\u2019m\nJewish, there\u2019s no escaping it, there\u2019s just no escaping the fact that you\u2019re Jewish, no\nmatter how friendly, how welcoming an environment is and the United States is the most\n-- probably the -- the friendliest country for a Jew to live in today, maybe even Israel. But\nhome 1s -- 1s -- the homeland -- the Jewish homeland, which -- which was always in -- in\nmy f -- you know, background of an -- or focus on and off, Israel is the place -- 1s the\nonly place and it -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m glad I sent them, I\u2019m glad they went. Even my\ndaughter Mia, she hasn\u2019t finished high school yet, but she already went last -- two\nsummers ago, for an extended stay of three weeks and she loved it. Of course loving it at\n14 is differently than loving it when you\u2019re 16 or 17, but they all had a very good\nexperience there. My son David is somewhat of a student. He studied there in the\nYeshiva. And he eventually became a -- got a degree of rabbi, which 1s just like a\ndoctorate in Jewish studies, but he became a rove, he got the smeeha, which 1s the\nequivalent of a doctorate in rabbinical studies, I guess, from Yeshiva University and he\nnow is -- he\u2019s a teacher in Westchester, in Mamaranak. And his wife is also a teacher, she\nteaches handicapped people -- hard of hearing and unable to speak, she talks in sign\nlanguage. So they\u2019re both teachers and they have three boys, which means of course I\nhave at least three grandchildren. And they have a wonderful life together. They -- they\nhave summers off together, which is -- which is something that I always encouraged my\nkids. My -- my secret desire to be a math teacher, part of that plan was to have summers\noff, so that I could be with kids. I love kids. So, as it turns out -- as -- I love children, I\nlove to teach. I mean I could -- I just -- thought came back to me, which will throw me\nback into the Slotkin house, if -- 1f I could. They sent me to summer camp and I became -\n- | was always athletic alee in class. I became a swimmer and I ended up getting a water\nsafety\u2019s instructor\u2019s certificate from the Red Cross, which made me a lifeguard and -- so I\ndid that for quite a few summers, late high school and -- no, actually college years and\nduring that course, I taught. I became a teacher -- at least I was teaching something. Not\nmath, but swimming. And it was a very rewarding experience, especially when -- when --\nwhen I managed to teach a non-swimmer, who was totally afraid of the water, or a\nhandicapped person -- to get them into the pool, to get them to relax, to gain that\nconfidence, to be able to float and to move in water, which is so life-threatening to most\npeople if they are afraid of it. So, it was a -- it was a wonderful experience and I think\nthat teaching 1s something that I pushed a little bit on as a -- as a professional. I thought\nthat was a good profession and my son David I think took -- took us up on it. I think\nJune, my wife, who is a teacher, also saw the wisdom in that, so we pushed him, really.\nWe re -- we really forced him a little bit. And he -- he took us up on it. He\u2019s very happy\nnow. And my daughter Corrie also went to Israel... more of a secular type. She didn\u2019t --\nwasn\u2019t engaged in the Torah and the Talmudic studies that the boys are -- are sort of\nexpected to do in the -- in the -- in the Orthodox way of doing things. And I will con --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",

Now she\u2019s married and ... she lives on Long Island, she\u2019s very\nclose to her family. She\u2019s -- she gave up working because she really wants to spend time\nwith her children, even though she can afford to do otherwise. And she\u2019s very happy --\nshe\u2019s very happy. And my little Mia, well, we\u2019re going to wait.",
        "A: Well, I knew, when I really divorced, that I could never live alone. I mean, I knew that\nth-there -- I would have to be, cause I\u2019m that type of a person, I\u2019m not a loner, I -- I need\nto be around people, with people. And so I knew I would marry, but obviously right after\ndivorce I wasn\u2019t ready. I-It\u2019s strange. I met her through a coincidence of -- of the Slotkins\nagain, believe it or not. My father, Meyer Slotkin was best friend with -- with a\ngentleman called Daniel Meyers, this is down in Lawrence, Long Island, who used to\npick us up. My memory 1s -- of him is pick us up Friday afternoons, half wet from a\nShabbas preparation shower, cigarette dangling out of his mouth, driving 100 miles an\nhour, picking us up to go to Shul Friday night. And they were best of friends and Daniel\nMeyers had a son who was younger than I, but we -- nevertheless, we knew of each other\nand this fellow, Jonathan Meyers, used to live one house down from here, where I live\ntoday. He married a girl and they used to spend summers out on Hampton -- in the\nHamptons -- Amagansett, Long Island. And my wife, being a teacher -- teachers all have\nsummers off. They also spend time on the beaches, if they like beaches. So they met up\nthere. And then when my separation came about, Jonathan and his wife -- Jonathan and\nhis wife and I -- f -- Pll try and remember her name later -- they thought that -- that June\nwould be a excellent match for me, because they knew here very well, she lived with\nthem for awhile and they knew of me. So they introduced us. And so we actually met for\nthe first time, a few hundred yards from where I sit now. And this was 1970, I think. \u201869 -\n- 1970. And our first impressions -- I remember I didn\u2019t want to come into the city, but he\nsaid, \u201cOh come, please, we --\u2019\u2019, I said, \u201cLook, I know you want to meet -- you want to\nmake us some kind of a shiddock, you wanted me -- me to meet some girl, or this,\u201d said,\n\u201cplease, I am not interested, I don\u2019t want it, I\u2019m not ready for any of this. You want me to\ncome in for dinner, I'll come in for dinner, we\u2019 ll talk,\u201d and this and this, wi -- I walked in\nand there is June. And I was pretty disturbed, in a negative way, I didn\u2019t want any part of\nthis. I found out later -- many years later, that when June saw me walk through the door,\nshe said to herself, \u201c\u201cThere\u2019s the man I\u2019m going to marry.\u201d So first impressions is what\nsometimes work and sometimes they don\u2019t work. But they\u2019re a valuable tool for some, I\nguess. So that\u2019s where I met June. And we started dating very, very slowly. I must admit,\nshe was first much more aggressive than I was. But I saw the value of her -- she\u2019s a\nwonderful person, just a marvelous person. Then, after a couple of years, I turned to -- I\nturned to be more aggressive, because she was going away every summer and I started\nfeeling lonely and this and that and so once we made up our minds, we -- I proposed to\nher. I tried to pick a spot -- a romantic spot, because I\u2019m that way in my heart. I tried to\npick a spot that would always be here. So I picked the Metropolitan Museum. They used\nto have a pool garden around them, with fountains and the cafeteria -- caf\u00e9 around it. It\nwas magnificent. The pool was huge and it had statues and water was flowing out. It was\na beautiful setting there. The piano bar and this -- this is where I wanted to get engaged\nbecause I wanted to always be able to come back to the place and -- and somehow\ncelebrate. By the -- just by the way, on the side note on this -- this same location was\nused I think, by Sybill, the picture Sybill -- if anybody knows about that. But that\u2019s where\nit can be seen. So, we were engaged and married three weeks later and happy. Happy,\nhappy, happy. I don\u2019t think we ever had a real fight. Disagreements, yes, but not any real\nout and out fight, ever. And she\u2019s been a mother to the three children. [phone message\nmachine]",
        "A: Yes, yes. I remember we -- b-before I even go on to that, I just have to say, in the\ncontext of what we were talking before, that as -- as wonderful as June was and what a\nwonderful contribution a woman can make to a -- to a -- to a husband, to a family, to a\nman like me. It required, I guess, special understanding, because she is very special. But\nit -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s been wonderful. For me, life has been wonderful since I met June. And the\ncon -- to contrast that, it could be the worst thing if you have the wrong mate, which I\nalso had before. So -- I sort of -- I\u2019m just saying, I know what I\u2019m talking about. A wife -\n- a true partner, can make or break you, is -- 1s my whole point. And when the -- the\nchildren, when -- when I got married to June were quite, quite young and I think in their\nidealistic way, they still sort of hoped that somehow things would go back to where they\nwere. Even though they spent so much time here with us, so they knew that this was the\nright way. I -- I have to mention at this point also that at one point in time, the two oldest\nones, they actually left their mother\u2019s homes to come to us -- to live with us. And we\nmade provisions here for that. Corrie, my ol -- the youngest, the last one left, didn\u2019t have\nthe strength or didn\u2019t want to -- or didn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t leave her mother alone or something.\nSo that never happened. But -- at the -- when the marriage took place, it was still --\nfeelings were still very raw. There was a lot of animosity and there was -- was a new\nthing. So, we wanted the kids to come to the wedding, but we couldn\u2019t announce it freely\nto my ex-wife, because that would not have worked. So -- and the children were so\nyoung, that we couldn\u2019t even tell them, the wedding is going to take place at a certain\ntime and we had to have them dressed. So I remember, very distinctly, we --we went to\nbuy them suits. We purchased them at J.C. Penney, I remember that very distinctly, they\nwere the suits -- we tried to guess their sizes and dress and whatnot and that weekend that\nthey came -- we were married on a Sunday -- we told them about this and it was quite a\nshock for them to realize that we were going to get married, cause -- I mean they knew us\nas being together, but this is a different ball game. This sort of made it irreversible or\nwhatever. But it -- 1t was hard and I even at the -- at the wedding, I have a few pictures\nwhere I see Zebbe sitting alone and some photographer caught me tal -- trying to talk to\nhim, his head down and -- he wasn\u2019t upset about the food, he was upset about what was\ntaking place. So I think it was a hard thing for them, but I think that now they realize how\nhappy we are and they -- they constantly want to come here. My -- Corrie wants to be h-\nhere every Shabbas now, even though she has a house which could house all of us on\nLong Island, but this is where she wants to be, on the living room floor here. She would\nrather be here with -- with the family. So I think I -- I managed to get a certain point\nacross to them. [telephone ringing]",
        "A: No, not really. I think 1t was simply having the wrong partner. Also, when you\u2019re\nyoung -- well it\u2019s the wrong partner, because you married, as a course of event at the\ntime. You finish school, the next step is marriage and you just stepped into it without too\nmuch thinking and perhaps there was a little bit of pressure from -- a negative pressure\nfrom my house to get out and I just wanted out. But basically I think it\u2019s because it was\nthe wrong partner. Because the difference is unbelievable.",
        "A: For the first time, Irene and I, although we lived in the same house, under the same\nroof, we had the same friends, we had so many common interests -- the first time we\ntalked about it was in 1985, in Jerusalem. Two years prior to \u201885, there was a convention\nin Philadelphia, a Holocaust convention, which I never really paid much attention to by --\nby Mr. Mead and his wife and they had these annual get-togethers, but it never interest\nus, because we were protected from it, we were -- we\u2019re just not part of that scene at all.\nBut we had a special invitation from a lady, Eva Core, who formed a twin organization.\nNow this was more our speed, because we knew we were twins and -- and it sort of hit\nhome a little bit. She was a very forceful lady and she said we -- we -- we owe it to\nourselves, we owe it to our children, we owe it to the future, we owe it to mankind\nperiod, just to talk a little bit and let them know what -- what happened. Whatever the\nresult of that 1s, 1s -- is up to history to judge, but we owe it to the people. We owe it to\nourselves. And being that I and a -- I and -- and my sister and we never talked about it, it\n-- it was just -- seemed like might be very interesting to hear it from somebody else, even\nthough we knew that we were there, 100 percent, because we had some pictures, we had\nthe numbers. We wanted to, I think, make contact with others who were in the same --\nsame situation. So, we -- we\u2019ve -- we made contact with them, we joined the organization\nand in 1985, Eva Core made this -- was the head -- head of this mock trial for Dr.\nMengele, to which all the twins in the world were invited. She searched them out and we\nwere all there, that -- that she could get. There were scores. There were scores there. I\nthink maybe like 80 - 85 twins or something like that. And -- some single twins, because\ntheir partners, their tw -- other twins didn\u2019t survive. But -- there were some small people -\n- what do you call them? Not pygmies.",
        "A: Dwarfs. Dwarfs, yeah. There were -- and I think they\u2019re might have been one or two\nGypsy, but I -- I don\u2019t believ -- I -- I don\u2019t think -- I don\u2019t remember seeing them in\nJerusalem, but there were definitely some dwarfs there in 1985. And the -- the -- the\nmock trial of Dr. Mengele took place in Yad Vashem and in -- and it was given a lot of\npublicity throughout the world. Dr. Mengele came on the scene because that was his trial\nand the -- the testimony given by eyewitnesses against him were -- were -- were just\nunbelievable. We talked -- not so much during the trial itself, but after the trial, in our\nhotels, we talked to the other twins and they told us what had taken place with them and\nsome of the stories were just unbelievable. Even to us, even though we were there. There\nwas just -- horrible. But it -- we made contact, for the first time and this is where I saw\nthe effects that this war had on -- on -- on -- on people, on -- on -- and this 1s where I\ncame to the -- to the realization that I am so lucky, because I think I -- I sort of escaped it,\nrelatively unscathed. I -- maybe because -- maybe I\u2019m hiding it, maybe it\u2019s repressed,\nmaybe it\u2019s in there somewhere. But I felt -- I felt so much more at ease with the world.\n[phone answering machine]",
        "A: Yeah, I -- I -- P\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve looked around me and I saw all these people that were hurt,\nsome actually, physically, were on -- on kidney machines. Emotionally, I saw 50 year old\ngirls, twins -- they were dressed alike, they had the little ponytails, braided tails and\nthey\u2019re holding hands together and walking around like this. Now, these people\nobviously were hurt, emotionally, spiritually -- there -- there\u2019s something wrong with\nthem. And they all had this look in their eye. This -- this -- a certain look that -- a wild,\nyou know, a hurt look. And only maybe 10 percent -- less than 10 percent, five percent\nof the people were people that I could relate to, speak to normally and -- and not be afraid\nthat I would offend them in any way because certainly we -- we were talking to each\nother much more openly, because we all knew who we were. We were saying things that\nwe wouldn\u2019t normally say, but we\u2019re still being very careful and had to be careful, except\nfor a handful. Truly maybe five percent of the people that we could really talk to freely.\nAnd I think, as a result of all this -- this -- this created a -- a -- an environment for my\nsister and I, cause I think one of the evenings, we sat down in our room and we just\nstarted. It just poured out. We started talking and this and -- and you know, recalling our\nmemories, our this -- slowly at first, but g -- and we felt so much, so much relief. I don\u2019t\nknow what kind of relief, but just relief that finally we were able to talk. And I guess 1-1t\nwas time. It was just time t-to unload all this and only to ourselves. We still did not feel\nfree to talk to the Slotkins. Now, my father had passed away already. He passed away in\n81 - \u201882, but my mother was still around. She was still from the old school and even\nthough she now knew that we were public with it, and we appeared on shows and Irene\nlectures and this and that, she still -- it wasn\u2019t something that was good for Irene to do,\nbecause she was totally protected. For me, she -- she knew I was a little flightier and\nmaybe less easily hurt or more extroverted or had 1t more hidden in me, or whatever. But,\nso in 1985 -- 40 years after. 40? Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. Yes, there were a couple of people that -- that recognized me as that little boy,\nbecause I was truly one of the youngest blond-headed kid, they recognized me and they --\nthey let me know that they remembered me. And that didn\u2019t do all that much for me.\nWell, of course you remember me, I was there, you were there. But in the negative sense,\nIrene wasn\u2019t recognized by anyone. And this hurt her, I think, even though she\u2019s now an\nadult and I think she still would have liked to have been remembered by somebody --\ncreated enough of a -- an impression. But I\u2019m not all that surprised, because from what\nshe tells me, she was mostly always in the background. Nobody took care of her. As the\nmen seemed to have -- for some reason they took much better care of -- of their -- of the\nyounger twins. They somehow had an organization and they -- they -- they took care of\nthe younger ones. That ladies, for some reason -- and I can\u2019t understand why, but they\ndid not have the same sort of a set up.",
        "A: I -- I don\u2019t think we bothered really to piece the memories, cause we -- we had them.\nWhat we -- what we tried to -- to do is to -- for the few -- one specific example I can give\nyou -- when we were in Auschwitz, after we were separated and we were -- like she was\nin the women\u2019s camp, I was in the men\u2019s camp and we were taking to the doctor on an\nindividual basis, even though I guess they knew who I was -- I was a twin to the other\none. But we saw each other once, through a fence, a barbed wire. And at that eye contact,\nno words, nothing was spoken, but we both remembered that. That one moment, that one\ninstant. And I think that\u2019s the instant that -- that gave us the -- the -- the -- the impetus to -\n- to say, \u201cHe\u2019s alive. He\u2019s always going to be alive -- or she\u2019s alive. I\u2019m going to find her,\nI\u2019m going to do --\u201d. So we talked about that moment of recognition, cause I knew it was\nher, but I wasn\u2019t sure that she knew that it was me. But we got that straightened out very\nquickly. So we talked, but even though we talked for the first time and we were as open\nas we could, Irene still held back a lot of things. And I guess I held back a lot of things,\ntoo and I\u2019m only saying this empirically speaking now, because I know how much more\ninformation we let out since 1985. But we talked about it and it felt good. It was a relief.\nIt really was a relief. And for -- I think from that point on, we realized we\u2019re going to\nhave to talk about it. And that it -- good will come of it. And it -- it has to be. Because\nquestions are asked by people close to you, by your family. They have to be answered,\nthey can\u2019t be -- you -- you can\u2019t put them aside, they have to be answered. And they -- in\norder to answer them, they have to be answered truthfully. As fully and as truthfully as\nwe can answer them.",
        "A: No, no, here I -- I have to say that I allowed the Slotkins to -- to -- to -- to manipulate\nmy mind. Not manipulate by my -- but th-they -- I was always sort of in the same\nframework. I didn\u2019t want to tell the kids about my horrors. I never hid anything from\nthem, conscio -- but I never wanted to either tell them. So, as they grew older, their\nquestions became more intense and I tried to tell them whatever I could gear to their age.\nYou know, at -- at six, seven, eight years old, when -- you know, you -- you can tell a kid\nsomething, but you can\u2019t -- so but now it\u2019s ou -- all out and they know everything and\nwhenever there is something that\u2019s happening, they want to be part of it. And I think they\nfeel sort of an honor that their father survived it all. I -- I really do. I think -- that\u2019s how\nthey make me feel, anyway, so it\u2019s good. I mean, I don\u2019t mind.",
        "A: Yes. I don\u2019t know how you knew that, but it\u2019s true. In addition to the media exposure\nthat -- when we were hot, in 1985 and Mengele was on the front page and we were flown\nout to California once, I remember, to a show -- we were on the Good Morning Show\nhere and this and that, but, you know, this was just few short questions, answering to the\npeople and -- and, you -- you know, you were prepped for this, basically. You still\nanswered truthfully, but you were prepped for it, for -- but to really get the message\nhome, I thought -- and Irene, whenever she speaks, you can\u2019t do it as a factual thing. \u201cOh\nyes, we went -- we were -- so many were killed, we saw people getting killed every day -\n- where they kept marching them to the ovens, and there were piles of bones.\u201d Everybody\nhas seen this. But we thought, to bring it home, really to -- to -- to bring it home, is to\npersonalize the message. To -- to make you as real as you possibly can make it. So Irene\ndoes it in a way -- she\u2019s a wonderful speaker, I -- she really is, she -- I\u2019ve -- ve heard\nher speak to congregations and to gatherings and people are absolutely spellbound. When\nshe finishes, they -- they just look at each other and there\u2019s nothing to say. I\u2019m not that\nway. I like to go to schools. I -- I would -- I remember twice -- on two occasions, I went\nto schools. I actually put the kids on the floor, in a circle around me and let them touch\nme, let them ask. I didn\u2019t start telling them. I tol -- they were prepped by their teacher,\nknowing that here is a man from concentration, comes from a -- and I just let them -- let\nthem loose. And, you know some of them ask questions about -- kids -- some ask, you\nknow, \u201cDid they -- did they feed you? Did you starve?\u201d And did you this and that. These\nare youngsters. But older people -- much more intelligent, much more sensitive\nquestions, they really want to know. And they know so little from the history books.\nThere\u2019s no history out there of this. History doesn\u2019t teach this, the Holocaust. It\u2019s just\nsomething that happened. And the Bronx High School of Science, that was the last one\nthat I a-attended a class there -- a -- high school students. And there were -- they\u2019re\nstudying the Holocaust and they have a very extensive Holocaust exhibition down in\ntheir basement as part of their library. Very, very intense, one of the best. And they --\nthey really wanted to get into it, because they ju -- there was just no way they could get it\nfrom history. So getting to talk to them, I got them to really feel -- I try to make them feel\nthat I\u2019m real, you\u2019re real, it really happened. And I think they believe me and that was\none of my greatest rewards, because today there are a lot of people out there who say it\nnever happened. What -- what their motivation is, I don\u2019t know. But there are people\nlistening.",
        "A: There is, unfortunately Jews, like all other people, we\u2019re -- we\u2019re somewhat slaves to\nthe current markets and -- and if the pop -- the topic 1s popular, people get on it. There\u2019s\nsome people who -- who actually force a living out of the Holocaust. Very few, but there\nare some. So, all I\u2019m really saying 1s that -- th-that a lot has been done, a lot has been\nsaid, because it\u2019s timely. It seems to be the thing. Whether you were -- you can ever\ntotally overkill the issue, I -- I -- I don\u2019t know, I -- I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think that you\nreally can, I think it\u2019s a very important part of the Jewish history, but certainly it\u2019s not the\nhappening. I think the happening happened a long time ago, when God took Moses and\nchildren of Israel out of Egypt. And I think that was the happening. And if all Jews\nfocused on that, they would get a little better understanding of what really 1s worthwhile -\n- or what they should concentrate on. But, certainly history -- and this is the same, it\u2019s\nhistorical, you have to look at your history in order to live today and prepare for\ntomorrow. You just have to do that. You have to do that and the -- the Holocaust is what\nhappened to us, unfortunately. And it\u2019s my life, I was turtle -- totally immersed in it for\nawhile and I\u2019m still immersed in it many years later. The -- the just -- you just don\u2019t\nforget about it. You know it every day. You know that you\u2019re different. How different,\nI\u2019m not sure. I honestly don\u2019t know, but I know that my background 1s different than --\njust as I\u2019m different from any other person living.",
        "A: I have to disagree with you a little bit. A little bit. Yes, I have a fruitful life. I\u2019ve -- I\nhave grandchildren, I have children. But somehow I -- I feel that all this -- this -- all this\ncoincidence -- I can\u2019t even say luck, it was sort of my destiny, I feel somehow, to escape\nand to come here to the United States. To be in the army, to be divorced, to -- to find\nJune. To -- to work for a synagogue. To -- to do whatever I\u2019ve done. But somehow I\ndon\u2019t quite feel fulfilled. I don\u2019t feel this richness of having lived a truly fruitful life.\nMaybe nothing to do with the Holocaust. Maybe if I would have been a math teacher, it\nwould have been fulfilling. But I haven\u2019t done that and there\u2019s something still missing. I\ndon\u2019t know what to attribute this to. There is something not quite -- 1t seems that I\u2019ve\nescaped something that was so horrendous that I -- I feel maybe I should have done\nsomething unbelievable, but I haven\u2019t. Even though, some say an ordinary life -- a -- a\nrich life or children and education, this is -- is an achievement of it\u2019s own, but I -- I just --\nI wonder. I wonder about this. I feel that maybe I should have -- I\u2019ve been destined for\nsomething -- maybe still to come, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I think I just said it. I feel very, very lucky that I escaped. I\u2019m very fortunate with\nwhat I -- what I have. I have what I think are the true riches. I have a wife that loves me,\nthat I love. I have a family. I belong to a synagogue, I\u2019m a member of a community. I\nhave good friends, I have -- I seem to be healthy, which unfortunately my sister doesn\u2019t\nhave the health. But then there 1s this -- still this -- there\u2019s a little bit of emptiness.\nUnfulfilled something in me that -- that I haven\u2019t satisfied yet. But perhaps I will, perhaps\n-- maybe this is one of the means by which I -- I do this, is when I do an interview like\nthis, or when I expose my emotions like this, it takes a few days to come back -- to sort of\nget back into total norm. Perhaps this is something -- perhaps these comments, perhaps\nthe tapes that I\u2019ve done, perhaps the shows that we\u2019ve recorded, perhaps in the future,\nmaybe that is the thing that\u2019s going to count and -- and -- and serve, which I don\u2019t feel\nright now.
