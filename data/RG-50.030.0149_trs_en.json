        "Q: Can you give us your name please?",
        "A: My name 1s Laura Margolis.",
        "Q: And would you tell us where and when you were born?",
        "A: I was born in Constantinople, Turkey, in 1903.",
        "Q: Would you tell us something about your family and your early life?",
        "A: Yes. I was born in Turkey of Austria-Hungarian grand...grandparents and parents really.\nAnd...uh...my grandfather was Dr. Schwartz who...uh...was head of the ____ Jewish\ncommunity in...uh... Turkey and also consultant to the...uh...Sultan of ____. My father, on the\nother hand, was born in Russia. I'll get to the marriage part and how they met which is also\nhistory...uh...and as graduated high school. But because of the anti-Semitic regulations there,\nhe couldn't go on to college, so he decided to come to Palestine and see if there wasn't\nsomething there that he could do, and he spent a little bit of time in Palestine\nand...uh...decided that the thing for him to do was go to back to his father, get some money,\ngo to Berlin and study agronomy, and eventually settle in Palestine. Now in Germany where\nhe studied in Berlin, his professor of Botany was Dr. Otto Warberg, and...uh...there was a\nvery close warm friendships between student and professor. They somehow clicked. Parallel\nwith this period, my grandfather, Dr. Saloman Schwartz, in Constantinople had...uh...wanted\nsome of his own medicines patented in Germany and was also in contact with...uh...\nProfessor Otto Warberg for patenting his own medicines. This was all 19th century almost.\nAnd...uh...when my father graduated, his destination would have been Palestine straight, but\nDr. Otto Warberg suggested to him that he first go to Constantinople and meet Dr. Schwartz\nand maybe he would put off his going to Palestine for a few years because Dr.\nOtto...Professor Warberg's idea was that there was land up in Asia-Minor and...uh...that with\nmy father's training, he would...and with Dr. Warberg's money, he would be able to do some\nsettling of Jews who were already running from the Soviet...from Russia, not the Soviet\nUnion then...from Russia to Constantinople, and were becoming beggars on the streets, and\nhe was already in those years thinking of making them farmers eventually to go to Russia.\nThis was before EXKA_ which was established in Paris and EKA was a philantrophic Jewish\norganization that was settling Jews in Russia. And Dr....or Professor Warberg really wanted\nto do an experiment with his own money up in Asia-Minor. So my father agreed. He was\nyoung. There was no reason why he couldn't do this, and he adored his professor. He came to\nConstantinople to Dr. Schwartz who had all the contacts with the Turks and my mother\nopened the door, and that's where the romance started. Now, they went together up to Asia-\nMinor. That's where they spent their honeymoon. And it was...uh...absolutely wild up there.\nAnd...uh...they did...were able to bring some of the Jews who were just hanging around and\nbecoming beggars in Constantinople. They were prepared to take on these people, teach\nthem farming, agriculture, and train them for eventually going to Palestine.",
        "Q: What year were they married?",
        "A: They were married...1903. I was born in 1903. I think they were born in 1904. No. No. No.\nOh, no. They were married in 1902, I think.",
        "Q: I see. You were born in 1903.",
        "A: That's right.",
        "Q: On the honeymoon. Right. The story was that...uh...actually I think I was conceived in Asia-\nMinor (laughing). And...uh...in order to...I know that in order to give...uh...birth, my mother\nhad to come down...she tells how she came down to her father, the doctor, in an ox cart.\n(clearing throat) Anyway, my...uh...these...in...1n Hebrew it's called __. This\nfarming...this agricultural training 1n...uh...Asia-Minor was very successful, but there was a\ntime when Professor Otto Warberg simply said he couldn't finance it anymore and...uh...so\nthe job...my father still wasn't thinking of America at all. He was still thinking of...uh...uh...\nPalestine. My father was offered another job to go back to Russia and...uh...begin training\nJews there on the spot. My father didn't want to go back to Russia. In the meantime, his\nfather and the whole family had immigrated to the United States and...uh...my mother said, at\none point, that she'd had enough of being...uh...uh...a farmer. She was not trained for that.\nShe was a beautiful musician. And so my father...they agreed that my father would go to\nAmerica where all...where his father and all the Margolis family had settled in Dayton, Ohio.\nHe would see how he liked it. In the meantime, my brother was born, and his name is Otto.\nHe's named after Professor Warberg. And so we waited in Constantinople until my father\nsuccumbed to the influences of his whole family and decided that we should come\nand...come to the United States. At that time, I was 5 and my brother was 2, and so we\nshipped off and that's the beginning of the family history in the United States.",
        "Q: Now can you tell us what happened in your earlier life without going into great detail but\nmaybe bringing us up to the time when your activities with regards to the war and the Jewish\ncommunity began.",
        "A: Uh...How far back do you?",
        "Q: Well, from the time you came to the United States.",
        "A: From the time I came to the United States. Okay. (clearing throat) Well, I was 5 years old.\nNow when I came to the United States, anyone who knows anything about the Middle East\nknows that you don't have to be literate or educated in order to speak 5 or 6 or 7 languages.\nAnd...uh...I came to the United States speaking French, German, Greek, Turkish and\nSpanish. But no English. And...uh...my mother brought the...uh...we...we sailed over to the\nUnited States with a maid because she couldn't handle two little babies. And...uh...the maid\nwas Spanish speaking, so for several years after I entered kindergarten in Dayton, Ohio,\nthese languages became...had become a part of me. And...uh...some of this will later maybe\nexplain why I even got started in the work that I did much, much later in my life.\nUh...Anyway, we lived in America where we...my father went into the business of his\nfamily. My mother continued with her music. We were educated. We moved from Dayton,\nOhio, eventually to Lima, Ohio, where I went to...uh...where my father opened a shop. And\nwe ended up really...I won't go through all the different stages of where we lived in Ohio.\nWe ended up in Cleveland which was the important city for all of us. And that's where my\nfather...uh...went into the insurance business. My mother continued with her music and her\nhouse. But at the end of the first world war, 1918, my mother took my brother and myself\nback to Constantinople for a whole year. My grandfather had died and she very much\nwanted to see her own mother and sister. So I spent a whole year sitting on a bench in a\nGerman school. That was our first trip back. Then we returned to Cleveland.",
        "Q: Is that where your completed your high school and college education? In Cleveland?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Where did you go to college?",
        "A: I went to college at...uh...well, I started my...uh...my first...the college I went to\nsub...sub...not professional...uh...Ohio State, where I got my B.A. And then I continued with\nprofessional education at Western Reserve, School of Social Sciences they used to call it in\nmy day where I graduated as a social worker.",
        "Q: And what sort of a career did you embark upon at that point?",
        "A: Very traditional career. Uh...I worked...always worked in the Jewish community. The Jewish\nWelfare Society, I think it was called in those years, of Cleveland, Ohio. Case work.\nAnd...uh...I think I...1f I can remember at all, I did leave that work. I did leave Cleveland at\none point. I felt that I had...I wasn't growing. I wasn't learning anything. I was becoming\nrepetitive, and so I took a year off and...uh...came to New York. And...uh...without getting a\ndegree of any kind, but just wanting to get some new ideas. And so I spent a year in New\nYork, and then I was called back to Cleveland by the Jewish Welfare Society, offering me a\njob of training volunteers to do Big Sister work. And that became a challenge. Seems to me\nthat I was always reacting to challenges, you know. To do something different and\nsomething new. So I came back to Cleveland and trained volunteers for the National Council\nof Jewish Women, I think about 3 or 4 years. (Pause)",
        "Q: At what point did you become involved with the...with the Joint.",
        "A: Well, the Joint comes much later. I'll tell you first...uh...after a couple of years of that in\nCleveland, the same restlessness showed up. And I heard that there was a job in Buffalo,\nNew York. In fact, I was told that there was a job and they were looking for a Director of\ntheir Jewish welfare work. I went down for an interview. This was already in the 30s. And I\nwas hired. So I left Cleveland, and that's the first time I ever left my parents' home, and was\non my own. And...uh...started working for the Jewish wel...became...became actually the\nDirector of the Jewish Welfare Society of Buffalo, New York. It took a long time to set up a\ngood welfare service there which would be accept...where students would be accepted by\nthe...uh... University of Buffalo. It took me about 4 years to do that job. I liked Buffalo very\nmuch. I had many friends. I was settled there. And then one day I got a telephone call from\nNew York. 19...Christmas 1938. And it was Cecilia Rasoski on the telephone, head of\nthe...uh...not Joint at that point...1t was the...uh...Jewish Refugee Service because already\nHitler was in. Refugees were coming tn in the 30s, but they weren't running like much later.\nThey were people who had means. Most of them professionals who saw the handwriting on\nthe wall in time and got out. And we were receiving them in Buffalo like in other\ncommunities in the United States. And...uh...I thought I was really there for good until the\ntelephone call came from Cecilia Rasoski of the Refugee Service, which was working\ntogether with the JDC, and now we'll call it the Joint. And she said to me she had heard from\nsomewhere, somehow that I knew Spanish, and there was a very serious problem in Havana,\nCuba. Refugees were beginning to flee from Germany and from other countries in Europe,\nand...uh...the boats were coming in, but there were problems in Havana. The money at that\npoint was being given by the JDC, but the JDC didn't have the official...uh...it was working\ntogether with the National Refugee Service. I didn't even know that I was a\nemploy...employed by the Joint at that time. And so what Cecilia asked me to do was to,\nwith my experiences as a social worker, with my Spanish language...there were multiple\nproblems down in Havana. Would I just go out or go...nobody flew those days...sail to\nHavana and look over the picture and be helpful? Also with...because of my language\nabilities with the Cuban government, which at that point in time was very corrupt. It was the\ntime of Batista. (clearing throat) Some...uh...some people...there were two ways of coming\ninto Havana. One was to get a false visa somewhere in Germany for $165, and the other was\nto find...to...uh...to...uh... really...uh...have a $500 legal bond which relatives in America\nwould send...would send down to Havana. And...uh... would eventually ended in the S...in\nSt. Louis...the famous affair of the St. Louis, was that...uh...Jews were coming in or the\noffice I was heading was called the Joint Relief Committee. Already the Joint was coming in\nto it. Actually, the Joint financially always was there. And...uh...they...uh...those who had\nlegal $500 bond were allowed to land and some of them were taken into jails. It was very\nchaotic. And we heard that ships were on the way, and there was at...at one point my whole\ndiagnosis of the situation was that this is no job for just a person like myself to deal with the\ngovernment, and that's when I called the JDC on the phone direct.",
        "Q: Where were you at the time?",
        "A: In Havana.",
        "Q: You joined the Havana office.",
        "A: Havana. Still in Havana. Expecting boats to come in, ships to come in with refugees and\nknowing that we wouldn't be allowed eventually to land them all because of this corruption\ninside of Cuba with Batista. And...uh...I phoned and told...uh...uh...whole story. And then we\nheard that the next ship that was to come in was the S.S. St. Louis. See, the JDC had offices\nin Paris, and we were in communications like this: New York, Paris, Havana. And so I\ninsisted that this 1s nothing which I felt I should handle alone. It was more political than\nsocial. My Spanish language didn't do any good. Uh...And they did. The JDC went down.\nAnd I can't remember the name of the lawyer at this point, but a very competent, legal\nlawyer...uh...man and was sent down by the JDC who...uh...had his ends with Batista. And I\ndon't think I have to repeat...there're books and stories. and everyone knows what the S:S. St.\nLouis meant. (Clearing throat) Our great problem was there were hundreds...I don't\nremember the statistics, but there were at least 5 to 6 hundred people on that ship. Only a few\ncould disembark who had real $500 bonds, and that ship was stationed there and not allowed\nto come into the harbor by the...by the Cubans, and it was going to go back to Germany.\nWell, the last thing we wanted was for that boat...that boat to go back to Germany because\nthat would have been the end. So for about a week...this 1s 39...uh...we in Havana, JDC New\nYork, JDC Paris...and it wasn't like today where you could fax and you could phone and you\ncould do things...there weren't all those tech...tech...technological facilities, but we could\ntelephone. I don't think we ever went to sleep. (laughing) Anyway, books have been written,\nstories been told. The S.S. did not go back to Germany. It was...disembarked in Holland,\nParis, London. (Pause) And from then on there was no more illegal immigration into\nHavana. It was all legal or...or not, but... And here I'd like to say that only...in...uh... in\nretrospect it became...the whole thing became so sad, although we thought and we did our\nbest to save these people from going back to Germany, many of them were caught when the\nGermans invaded Belgium, Holland, and France. But a lot of them were saved. Anyway, I\nthen decided that I was going to stay on and do a...a nice job, a quiet job in Havana. And one\nof the things that I learned...I call this my in-service training period. I knew nothing about\nAmerican immigration laws when I came there, but because of my own knowledge of the\nGerman language and I had a staff...we had a staff of refugees who knew many languages\nand the...uh...the American Consulate in Havana trusted us completely, we really became the\nright hand of the...of the...uh... American Consulate. Helping with interviews, with languages,\nwith evaluations. They did the technical jobs, but we would...could do the interviewing. We\ncould do...what they felt at least at that point...they really felt that what we could do was of\ngreat help to them. There were understaffed. And so I stayed on in Havana....39, 40, 41.\nAnd...uh...I...for some...I liked...I liked Cuba. I liked the climate. I liked the people. And I\nwasn't even restless at that point because we were...I thought we were doing a job. We were\nhelping to get people to the United States. But one day, one morning the phone rang. And the\nboss at that time was Mo Levitt, Moses Levitt. And he said, \"Laura, how are you doing?\"\n(laughing) 'How are you doing' was not an expression in those years, but he said, \"How are\nyou?\" I said, \"Fine.\u201d \"Busy?\" \"Yal, we're very busy here.\u201d Well...so...uh...he said, \"How\nwould you like to go to China?\" (Laughing) I have to laugh when I think of it. I said,\n\"China? Where in China?\" \"Shanghai.\u201d I said, \"Oh, Yal. Sure. I'd like to go.\u201d (Laughing) I\nhad no idea what he was talking about. I said, \"What's the problem?\" He said, \"Well, we've\nbeen...first of all we've had a request from the State Department that you should go to China.\nYou should go to Shanghai. Because refugees are pouring in from Germany. It's a open port.\nNo visas are necessary. The Chinese don't care who comes in. We've been sending money to\na Jewish committee of local leaders there and..uh...the Embassy is swamped. The Consulate\nis swamped. The Embassy was in Peking at that time. The Embassy needs help.\nThe...uh...the State Department doesn't have anyone who knows the German, and\nso...uh...and they've seen the kind of work you've been doing in Havana. Will you go?\" I\nsaid, \"Alright, I'll go.\u201d (Laughing) That's about as much of decision making as I've ever\nmake. Anyway, I flew up to get really some basic orientation of what was going on there.\nNothing was really going on. The Embassy...the Consulate was swamped. There was\nrefugees there who had visas, valid visas that the U.S. was ready for accept for their coming\nto the United States, but there was no personnel. So...uh...and then, of course, by the time I\ngot there, in 41...much later in 41, May 41...uh...there were almost...there were thousands\nand thousands of refugees. The situation as very chaotic. But I wasn't supposed to do much\nabout that. I was supposed to help the Consulate. Just in retrospect which is (clearing throat)\ndifferent from the way we travel now...uh...it took... went over on the first Pan American\nclipper that ever trans...that ever sailed in the Pacific. It took 5 days and 4 nights. But it was\nvery much more civilized than the way we travel now. Anyway, my...my...I had to get to\nHong Kong first. I couldn't get to China on...on a Pan American, and I had to wait for a\nwhole week in Hong Kong before I could get a ship up the coast to Shanghai. And when I\ngot there my first...first place I went to as the embassy...the Consulate. They gave me an\noffice, and I began interviewing, helping them. But at the same time I had to get to know the\nJewish community structure there of local residents. The chairman was an ex-Dutchman\ncalled Spillman, very nice man. And they were they ones who were receiving the JDC\nmoney to feed these 8,000 people who needed feeding. So...uh...all this was done with JDC\nmoney. I got to...I got to...uh...but the refugees were already...had already heard that\nsomeone from the Joint was there. I wasn't supposed to get mixed up...and they were coming\nto my hotel. At the same time I was sending in all my reports of the situation I found among\nthe refugees and how it was being handled. All of it went through the pouch, and I...very\nsoon...it took me a month. In June...I got there in May...1n June I issued a definite ultimatum\nto the JDC in which I wrote that if I were to stay on they would have to...this is not a one-\nman job. They would have to send out someone else to work with me. And I knew...I knew\nthat Manny Segal, who also was a social worker whom I knew from Buffalo who was\nworking with me in Havana, always said he'd like to come out. So I said, \"Either you send\nManny or someone else, but this is not a problem I can handle alone. Or else I'll come\nhome.\u201d In June 1941, that ultimatum had been issued. I had no reply yet, but in June 1941, I\nthink it was...the...the exact date isn't important. I think it was the 21st of June, the Germans\nhad walked into the Soviet Union. We, of course, knew this by radio, but it was very distant.\nSo I got a cable from the JDC a few days after that saying, \"In case communications are cut,\nyou are authorized to borrow on the promise of us to repay the amount of money which is\nrequired to take care of the needy\" (because we had 8,000 eating out of our kitchen; we had a\nhospital to support, and there was a school). Now these sums seem like nothing today, but in\nthose years it was a lot of money. And...uh...so I had this cable. That was June, July, August\n1941. And I was just beginning to get to know the whole refugee problem. I continued to\nwork with the...with the embassy...with the Consulate, but my focus was really upon helping\nthese people. And...uh...August 1941, I got another cable. SHIP OUT TO MANILA.\nDON'T...DON'T COME HOME. SHIP OUT TO MANILA AND AWAIT\nINSTRUCTIONS. Well, to get out at that point...the American marines were all leaving.\nThere was a feeling of war, but nobody was thinking of Pearl Harbor, of course, as you will\nhear later. The Japanese had been fighting the Chinese for years before that, but they had\nnever come into the international settlement. So to get a ship...the only ships coming out\nwere ships with Army soldiers. Through the American Embassy, I managed to get on the\nship. And I got to Manila. And I had the cable, DON'T COME HOME. So...uh...what does\none do? There were...there was a nice Jewish community there. I used to take trips around\nthe island, but I never could stay away very long because I was waiting for instructions. And\nfinally, this is already August. Right?\nQ; August 41.",
        "A: Huh? 41. Uh Huh. September. Telephone call. (clearing throat) September 1941.\nSeptember. Telephone call from Mo Levitt from New York. \"Laura, we've just come from\nWashington. We've been to the State Department. They assure us there will be no war in the\nFar East.\u201d You can go back and Manny Segal is on his way. So I went back. And it was clear\nthat we were taking over the whole program, using the local Jewish committee as advisory,\nbut the money was coming to...1n the bank to us. Manny Segal arrived December Ist, 1941.\nBy that time I had a pretty good idea what was going on over in Hong Q which 1s a section\nof Shanghai where the Japanese were already...had already occupied, but they had not come\nover to the International Settlement yet. The refugees were all...those who couldn't afford to\nstay in the International Settlement were all housed in the Japanese sector. Uh...I had then,\nbefore Manny came, I had a pretty good idea what the problems were and what kind of\nreorganization was required, you know. So...uh...Manny arrived, I think it was December Ist,\nand I gave him an orientation and we started going out to Hong Q, and we organizing the\nwhole thing and in Shanghai on December 8th in the morning in...uh...uh...Hawaii...where\nthe Japanese struck.",
        "Q: Pearl Harbor.",
        "A: Pearl Harbor where the Japanese struck. It was December 7th, 1941. By us, it was December\n8th, 4:00 AM. And our hotel was on the...on the _____, on the shore where all the ships were.\nShips of all nations. Was the biggest port of China. We were bombed out of our hotel beds\npractically with the bombing. And we looked out the window and all the ships in the Harbor\nwere burning. Japanese had come across the bridge, marched into our hotel, occupied the\nhotel. We were at war. That was it. People gathering in the streets below. We were...the first\nthing we did when we realized what it was all about was to tear up all the reports we had\nbeen sending to New York. We always kept...we didn't have a secretary. You couldn't\ntrust...you couldn't have a secretary. You couldn't trust anyone at that point. We had been\nkeeping carbon copies for ourselves and doing our own typing. But we realized we were at\nwar and this is it, so the first thing we did, Manny and I, was to tear up all our papers, flush it\ndown the toilet. Because we didn't know what was going to happen next. We were held in\nour rooms...there was an English broadcasting. The Japanese took over and broadcast in\nEnglish. We were just sitting there and watching broadcasting...listening to broadcasting.\nAnd down below people just mulling. Mulling, mulling, mulling. Millions of people. Couple\nof times, we went down to the lobby. We couldn't go out because every door, every exit,\nthere were Japanese soldiers with bayonets. Then we got...uh...we were just listening...we\nwere able to get food. Uh...we were listening to the radio the whole time, what was next. I\nthink it was about 6 o'clock in the evening when the English broadcasting came over saying\nthat people are now free to go out. So we went out and some friends of ours already, both\nChinese and foreigners, were downstairs waiting for us. They had been waiting for us all day\nlong. We went out and we had a good Chinese dinner. But what do we did next? Now,\nShanghai in the pre-Pearl Harbor days was a very social kind of place. And...uh...I had to go\nthrough...my round...my round of dinner parties and entertainment and at many of these\naffairs, horse races, I had met Captain...Japanese Captain Inasuka. Captain Inasuka had been\nliving in Shanghai for many years. He's Japanese. And...uh...I was told that he was very...he\nliked Jews. And that after that...Pearl Harbor, he had moved into the same hotel that we are\nliving in, which was the best hotel in Shanghai and he was already up in the Pent House. He\nhad already occupied Sir Victor Sassoon's Penthouse. So what do we do next? Refugees\nwere in the lobby, scared stiff. They were all stateless. No passports. No identify of any kind.\nAnd I, Manny and I talked it over. I said, \"Manny, go down and tell them we're working on\nit. Not to get excited. Not to worry. Something's bound to happen.\u201d And I made this decision.\nI had my telegram from JDC that I could raise money to be repaid at the end of the\nhostilities, wherever these hostilities would be. So I phoned up to Captain Inasuka. He\nremembered me...he remembered me because we had been to social affairs together and\nreceived me very nicely. Made the tea ceremony. Very nice. Very cordial. Then we got to\nthe nitty gritty of what I came for. Showed him the cable. (Pause) And I told him that I was\nprepared to help him. It's true that I am an enemy alien. I don't know what's going to happen\nwith me ext, but for the foreseeable future apparently I'm free, and I'm able to help him,\nmeaning helping the Japanese. That I would be able to take over, Manny and I, the whole\noperation in Shanghai and keep feeding the people if he would give me permission to raise\nthe money. Because without his permission I wouldn't be able to do it. And I think my\nlast...what was my last sentence, which I didn't learn in the school of social work. Uh...I said,\n\"Look,\" I said, \"You, as an occupying power, cannot afford to have hungry people riot.\nYou're responsible for them. On the other hand, I can help you, so they won't riot if you'll\ngive me an okay to raise the money.\u201d And he did it. On one condition. That I do not...now\nwhat was it he said, \"I do not take money from enemy aliens,\" meaning Europeans, but\nwherever I could raise it I...he also did something else that was very nice. The banks were\nclosed. We had a remittance a few days before Pearl Harbor of money which I was already\ncoming in our name, Joint Distribution Committee. He arranged for the bank to open so that\nwe could get money out, because it was there, before we could start raising money. And then\nhe also...then the American Red Cross had lots of cracked wheat which had been shipped\nover and stored and I...I had contact with the American Red Cross and they said, \"Look, take\nit.\u201d But I had to have his permission. He gave it to me. So we had cereals that we could give\nto our kitchens. That's about where we were when I had to start raising the money. Break\u2019?",
        "Q: No. Go ahead.",
        "A: Now. People who... There was plenty of money. Shanghai was a city of wheelers and dealers\nwith all kinds of black money, black market money. (Pause) I let it get around that we had\nsomething to sell. And money started coming in. The banks opened. Eventually the money\nstarted coming in and Manny and I took over. We went out to Hong Q every day. The whole\nyear of 1942 we were free. We weren't interned yet. And...uh...",
        "Q: We want to...we want to break now. We need a break now.",
        "A: We need a break now. We really do.",
        "Q: You're doing fine.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: Okay. Would you please continue?\nA; Yes. Anyway, it was clear we were beginning to raise money and...uh...all of 1942, and we\ntook over the program in Hong Q and...uh...we were giving IOU's to the people. And we also\nset up an entirely new committee. The committee which where...which I found when I\noriginally came to Shanghai, most of them had already been interned by the Japanese. They\nweren't around anymore. And...uh...uh...so that I...we began to take on some of the old\ntimers...uh...Polish, non---non-enemy nationals, Jewish...all Jewish who had been there for a\nlong time and whom we could trust. And gradually while on the one hand we were working\nin Hong Q and trying to set up the programs for the helping and the hospital and the money\nad all that and raising the money, we were also beginning to train another committee,\nvoluntary committee, to take over because it began to be clear that we were not going to be\nable to stay out forever because we were enemy aliens. And we got a very good committee.\nVery, very good committee. Many of them had been...uh...there for many years. Russians\nwho had fled the revolution and who had made their home 1n Shanghai and who were very\nfine community leaders and whom we could trust. And the...the one committee that we set\nup, Mr. Bitker...we called it the Bitker Committee, Mr. Bitker was the Chairman, and we felt\nvery secure in giving him power of attorney after...1f anything should happen to us to ensure\nthat part. Then, of course, in the middle of all this, we did a very...uh...unusual thing. Uh...the\nold kitchens that were feeding the refugees when we arrived...when we took over, were very\nold Chinese kitchens. And they had to be stoked all the time with coal and more money was\ngoing...we made an analysis that more money was going into coal than into nutrition. So\nwhat can we do? Then we heard that one day that out in the French concession of Shanghai,\nthere were some new boilers that had just arrived the day before Pearl Harbor and were\nstanding there...uh...assigned to the Sassoon Company, but were never used. So I went up to\nthe Sassoon Company, which was still in business at that point, and I asked them for\npermission and they said, \"We'd be glad to give them to you but they...we as British...as a\nBritish company, can't give you that permission. We're as much enemy aliens as you are.\u201d So\nwhat did we do? We had a very good friend, a Polish engineer who looked at\nthose...uh...boilers and said, \"Laura, you've got to get them.\u201d So one night when it was dark\nand...uh...there were millions of people buzzing around on the streets all the time and\nthe...and the rickshaws were going back and forth and nobody was paying any attention to\nanybody. We hired a group of coolies and this engineer, Manny and I went out to the French\nconcession and we highjacked the two big (laughing) boilers, and brought them through the\nmasses of people going into the...buzzing around in the streets of Shanghai. Nobody was\npaying any attention to us. Taking them over the bridge, and we got them to Hong Q. And\nfrom that point on, we built a new kitchen which was really giving nutrition and we burned\nup the old kitchens. That's one of our fun stories. Anyway, it got to be around the end\nof...uh...October, November 42, the rumors came and one day we were notified by\nradio...there were no television in those years...that the Japanese authorities are asking all\nenemy aliens to prepare themselves for internment. You would be allowed to take in\nanything you like to your camp. They didn't tell us which camp at that point. Your beds,\nyour...uh...linens, anything that you want to take in. Food...this is...they were beginning to\nprepare us. And then Manny got notified (pause) I think it was January 43 already that he\nwas going to an all-men's camp over in Paoting. I had not received a notice yet. So we\npacked him off, and a month later I got notice. And...uh...I actually took my own folding bed\nand my own mattress and...and...uh....a trunk full of canned goods and stuff and things\nand...and then...the...the Japanese were a peculiar race. It's a...an interesting group of people.\nUh...They were very, very permission with us, and I was taken to another camp of couples,\nand single men and single women outside of Shanghai. Right now the name of the camp\nescapes me, but it isn't important. It was the beginning of 43, I think February or something\nlike that. We got to the camp which, of course, was surrounded by barbed wire. It was a old\nschool house that had been bombed during the Japanese-Chinese wars and it was leaking\nhere and there and everywhere. And...uh...I got into a room with 40 women, and...uh...first\nthing I did, when I saw the room was to see at the very end there were windows\ngoing...getting out to the campus. It was an old school. It had a beautiful campus, and I\nquickly took my bed and dumped it in that area so that I would...all the 40 women would be\nin back of me and I would see the campus. That was the first thing I thought of. Anyway, it\nwas very cold. That night we turned on...they gave us fuel and they gave us an oven...stoves,\nand all of them lit...all of them were smoking, and so that was the end of that. We never\nburned them again. We just put on more clothes. Now, the Japanese were very good to us I\nthink. Now some of the...some of the high and mighty people who had been the old\nShanghailanders that we called it, were very resentful of having to be in those conditions and\nunder the Japanese. But that's something I've never had. I've never had any kind of feeling\nabout race, color, anything. I think they were absolutely correct in terms of the Geneva\nconvention. They gave us everything that was due to us. They brought in the food. We had to\ncook it ourselves. And they said to us, \"Listen, get organized. Put up your committees. Do\nwhat you like. We'll bring in the food. And organize your own social activities. Do anything\nyou like, but do it yourselves, knowing that we are here and that we are supervising.\u201d And so\nthe first thing that got...one of the things that go around in the camp was that I was there.\nAnd someone came to me and said, \"We want you to chair our committee because you've\nhad experience.\u201d I said, \"I am Laura Margolis with no experience. I am a number. I have a\nnumber. I don't want to be...I don't want to be known. I don't want to have anything to do\nwith all this. But you had to choose two...uh...everybody had to take on two jobs. So I made\navery quick ___ as we say. I...uh...realized that when you're near the food, it's important so I\ntook kitchen duty. And...uh...the other thing was...oh...the camp...there was barbed wire all\naround the camp. And out there were fields, and we were supposed to grow are own\nvegetables. And I've always liked farming anyway so...uh...and just being out of it is...1s very\nimportant for me. So I chose the second chore and that was to go out and work on the farm.\nAnd that worked very well. But then came 4, 5, 6 months of that and people were getting\nsick. And that's natural in all of China. I mean they were carrying them out by the dozens to\nthe hospitals, diarrhea and all that kind of thing. And...uh...nothing was happening to me. I\nwas as healthy as a horse. But I decided I had to get out because I just could stand the\ncollective. So I knew I wasn't going to commit suicide but I had sleeping pills and I wasn't\ngoing to commit suicide. But what I did was to eat less, grow weaker and...uh...put on my\nSarah Burnhart act. And so I was sent to the doctor...to the doctor in the camp who was an\nAmerican doctor. And he gave me a permit to get out to the hospital because he said I was\nvery sick, which I wasn't. And I got out to the...uh...hospital. It was a English hospital and\nDr. Veal who an Italian was the head of the hospital and he remembered me from...from\ncontacts we had before Pearl Harbor. And they put me in a ward, and when he came to make\nhis rounds in the evening and he saw me there, he caught on immediately because no matter\nwhat he did, I was in good shape. But he said I was very sick and so he said, \"Now, there are\ntwo things. You shouldn't be in a ward. I can get you a private room, but if you want a\nprivate room you'll have to...I have to notify...I have to write to Japan for permission. But I\ncan give you a room with another lady on my own responsibility.\u201d I said, \"I'd rather take the\nlady...the room with the lady.\u2019 And what happened there was that she was really a lovely,\nlovely Russian girl who was a mistress of the director of the German bank in Shanghai and\nhe used to come to visit her every day. And I had no right for visitors. And one day he said to\nme...he said, \"You know,\" he said, \"You are not allowed visitors. Wouldn't you like to tell\nyour friends outside that they can use my friend's name and come up and see you?\" And\nthat's the way I saw Mr. Bitker. I saw my friends. I got...I got the message out. And...uh...I\nwas there for 3 months. They kept me out in the hospital and then came August...July,\nAugust 43. Right? And...uh...Italy surrendered in the war...gave up as being one of the Axis\nand the next morning when that happened Dr. Veal came right in to see me and he said,\n\"Laura, now I'm an enemy alien and I don't know what's going to be with me next, but before\ncoming here I went to the Swiss Consulate because the Swiss had the authority over all\nenemy aliens.\u201d And he said, \"You're on the list for the next prisoner of war exchange. So I'm\ngoing to release you now. You go back, start packing and in September you will...uh...be\nre...on that...on that exchange. Your name 1s on it.\u201d He said I also found out that your name\nwas on the first exchange which was a diplomatic exchange, but the Japanese took you off\nbecause they needed you. (Laughing) So I went back. Before I went back, I sw Bitker once.\nFor the last time! And I got a...because he had power of attorney to raise money and in...1n\nthe name of the JDC to repay. And...uh...nobody knew when the war would end you know.\nSo I said, \"Look, I'm going to be out of this pretty soon. Just give me a...uh...up to date\naccount of what the situation 1s financially so I can get it back to New York. Well, he gave\nme the whole accounting up-to-date. When we were prepared in our camp...that was\nSeptember 43, that we were to pack and we were going to go on a ship. This was the\nbeginning of our repatriation exchange of prisoners of war. I had always these figures, and I\ntook toilet paper because I knew that there would be a body of search...body search before\nthey...before we were left to go. And...uh...I took the...uh...the toilet paper. I wrote every\npiece of...all the figures down, rolled it up and put it in the rubber pants...the... uh...top of my\npanties, so that...uh...1t was invisible and... uh...started packing. And in September 43, I\nforget the date exactly, we were...those of us who were on the list from our camp and from\nother camps were taken on a...to go on a Japanese ship as far as Goa where the exchange\nwould take place. That was in...1t was Portugese Goa which was part of the Indian mainland.\nAnd...uh...we got on that ship. It was...uh...a ship...a Japanese ship which had a passenger\ncapacity for about 100, and we were hundred and...one thousand five hundred, because we\npicked up people on the way. And what they gave us women were...uh...like stalls hat you\nput horses on and mattresses. And the mattresses were full of fleas. So the first...the first\nnight we took all our mattresses (laughing)",
        "Q:",
        "A: The first...uh...night...we tried to sleep with those fleas, but we couldn't. We took...all of us\nwomen, took all the mattresses out and threw them into the Chinese sea and slept on board.\nJust took a blanket and slept on board all the way through. We picked up people in the\nPhilippines. We picked up people in...uh...uh...what was...before Vietnam, what was it? A\nFrench...uh...anyhow, French port, and finally we got to Goa, where they...uh... Japanese\nwere coming in on the beautiful, beautiful, beautiful... uh...uh...Swedish ship, the Gripsholm.\nAnd...uh... so we packed. We got...they got...they...they...uh...uh... they were coming from\ntheir beautiful ship to our Japanese ship and we were leaving the Japanese ship to go on to\nthe Gripsholm. And it was...it was like...uh...a school, you know, each one going a different\ndirection, not looking at each other. And when I got on to the Gripsholm, I felt like for the\nfirst time I was totally free. And it was my 40th birthday. And...uh...of course, we had the\nsmorgasbord and we had a swimming pool, and then we started with the _Gripsholm. From\nthere on, it was all the way around South Africa where we stopped for 2 nights and\nthe...uh...uh... Jewish community there took us and we had...it was fun. And then around\nthe...around the Cape. That's right. We went around the Cape up to South Atlantic to Rio de\nJaneiro. And by...we got to Rio, the JDC had sent someone down to meet me, and...uh...to\ngive me money. I didn't have a penny. And to...we were there for 2 nights, and so we went\ndancing. And it was fun, and then we up the South Atlantic to New York. And...uh...1n New\nYork, I got a message, we're not allowed...uh...ships were not allowed to dock in New York.\nNo. Ships were allowed to dock...uh...to dock, but no one was allowed to come to the port. It\nwas the height of the war. And the first shock I had was when I got the message that I should\ncome to the...to which hotel I should come, that the...my friends in the JDC were going to be\nthere...uh...that New York was standing. All the news we had...uh...way back in...in the...in\nthe camps was that bomb...that...that the Hell had been bombed out of New York, and here\nwere people were complaining about rations. Anyway, it was a wonderful, wonderful\nreunion. And...uh...I stayed in New York, and then before I was allowed to even go and see\nmy family in Cleveland, I went to...uh...we went to...uh... Washington to give a report. I went\nwith Joseph Swartz who was the then Director of the JDC in Europe, and with Mo Levitt and\nmyself, we...we went by train to Washington. UNRRA had already become organized. That\nwas the first time I knew about Hitler. I knew about Jews in camps, but I never, never\nknew...never heard the words Auschwitz, Bergen-Belsen, and all that had really happened. I\nwas...had been completely detached from all that. And (pause) the JDC at that point was\ngiving a report. We went to the State Department. We reported to...uh... UNRRA, and then\nto the Treasury, Morganthal. Now, the JDC had been totally cut off from any communication\nwith me. They could not get an okay from the Treasury, I guess, to send money through\nSwitzerland to Mr. Bitker. And so we went to the Treasury and I...we had a long session with\nMorganthal, and gave him the whole story of how it's working. And he had one question.\nAre the Japanese getting any of this money? And I said, \"Not a penny. It's all in the hands of\nthe Bitker Committee,\" and I said, \"This is what is keeping the 8,000 people we are feeding\nalive.\u201d And it was from that point on that the Treasury gave the JDC...this is the way...this is\nthe way I remember it...uh...authorization, because we always had a delegate in...uh...during\nall the wars. We always had a delegate in Switzerland. Sally Myer, a very famous,\ninteresting man, a Swiss. And they...we were able to give an okay. They gave\nus... Morganthal gave us an okay to send money...uh...to the Bitker committee to keep the\n8,000 Jews alive. Now, of course, the JDC was sweet and very nice and...and...uh...they put\nme in the hospital. They wanted to be sure that I (laughing) was okay, and I came out okay.\nAnd then they said, \"Laura, you've really had it. We have another job. We don't want you to\nleave us, but we have another job for you. That's in Santi de Mingo, where there\nwere...uh...Jewish farmers.\u201d They were training refugees to be Jewish farmers 1n Santi de\nMingo. After I heard what I heard, I said, \"No. I'm not going to go and sit under a palm tree\nanymore. I can't do that.\u201d \"I...uh...\", said, \"that if you don't, it's alright. Don't want to send me\nto Europe, it's okay with me. I'll go to Europe with UNRRA because they'll be going.\u201d So\nthat's...so one night I had dinner with Dr. Joseph Swartz who was the boss\nin...uh...1n...uh...Paris, in Europe...not...at that time our office was in Lisbon, Portugal, and\nneutral countries. We operated in Europe through neutral countries. And...uh...he said,\n\"Laura, forget it. You're coming with me to...uh...uh...Lisbon\" where we had our office. And\nhe said, \"I have two assignments for you in Europe.\u201d Alright, my first assignment...[...I\nshipped off. I shipped off to Portugal, and the first job that I did there was I...I went up to\nSpain. Uh...We're already in 40...45, aren't we? I think so. Uh...The...France was occupied as\nwe all know by the...uh...Germans and there were in...1nternment camps in France and\nchildren were becoming separated from their parents. The parents were being sent to where\nthey were being sent. The children were hanging around and so the underground...the Jewish\nresistance movement in France organized a transport of children without parents at that point\nto be brought over the Pyrenees to Barcelona. But there was no one in Barcelona...we had an\noffice in Barcelona, but there was no one who would know how to handle children, who\nwould know how to handle...they could handle the money, the financial...uh...but we needed\nto set up a children's home to receive these children and to...uh...to feed them and to...uh...to\nstaff the place and Dr. Swartz asked me if I would do that, and I certainly did. I certainly\nwould. And so I spent 2 or 3 months up in Barcelona, going up...into the border lines, with\nthe...uh...staff, ..the rest of the staff and bringing the kids down, and...uh...staffing the whole\nplace so that the children wouldn't be in a panic. And thus...and those children...many, many\nyears later, I met as grownup mothers and fathers in...in Israel. We had a nice reunion.\nAnyway, when that job was done, I went back to...uh...to...uh...what do you call it?\nTo...uh...Lisbon, and then Joe said to me, \"Look, Laura. I need someone to fly to Sweden.\u201d\nSo I said, \"Sweden's neutral. What's the problem?\" He said, \"Yes, but it's because it's neutral\nthat we are able through the ___ the German...the Jewish...the...uh...Swedish-Jewish\ncommunity to send parcels of food into the Germans...the camps in Germany for our people.\nAnd he said, \"I would like very much...it means...it's a dangerous job. You have to hang\naround London for awhile and the...uh...the...uh... Germans are bombing the Hell out of\nLondon still. The flight, which is not a civilian flight, from somewhere in the British Isles\nand we never know where it's going to be from...to Sweden is not going to be an easy one.\nWill you do it?\" I said, \"Okay, I'll do it.\u201d I flew to London. And there's a very, very nice\nstory in connection with that. London, of course, was bombed out as we all know. I had a\nreservation in the hotel for 2 nights. I could hear the\nB-1s, but I didn't have the sense...I didn't have enough sense...I slept through them. And then,\nI was told by the hotel that my reservation was out, to please pack and go. Where do I go? I\ndidn't know anybody in London. I knew where the JDC office was in London. So I took\nmy...aS we say in German, my __, packed up, went to the office. And it was a bank holiday.\nOf course, it was closed. But the...uh...the janitor was there. I told him who I was and I said,\n\"Just leave me in the office, that's all. Everybody will be in the office tomorrow, and they'll\ntake care of me. And tonight I'm alright, so I'll put my fur coat on the floor and I'll sleep on\nthe floor. What else can I do?\" He let me in, and as I'm...just as I'm getting in the phone\nrings. I'll tell you there is a God that watches over me. The phone rings, and who do you\nthink it is? It's one of the couples from Shanghai that I was able to get out in the last minute\nthrough my work in the Consulate through their uncle in New York. And they went on to\nLondon and this uncle had been...had been following me and wondering from\nJDC...constantly asking from JDC where is she now? And found out that I was in London,\ntold his niece and nephew where I was. They phoned me at the office, came over right away,\nand took me to their house. Didn't have to sleep on the floor. Alright? Then I hung around\nLondon, and then I got all through this...all through the American Embassy. I had to report\neveryday...I had to report every place where I was in case we got the clearance to...to fly.\nSo...uh...one day when I checked in they said, \"You're flying tomorrow morning.\u201d And we\nwere picked up. All this was done for us. We didn't have to do a thing. Uh...We flew to\nsomewhere...I've never figured it out yet on the Iris sea. And the only other...other two\npeople who were in the place cause no...cause there was no civilian flying...uh...were there\nand...uh...we were just hanging around waiting for orders what to do next. Just like the\nArmy. And then one day we were picked up and taken to the airport and told that we had to\nget into parachutes. This was never told to us before. Because the last plane that flew over to\nSweden was...uh...bombed down over the Fjords by the Germans who were in...uh...what's\nthe other Scandinavian country? Huh?",
        "Q: Denmark.",
        "A: Denmark. Yal. Not Denmark. No. The other one.",
        "Q: Norway.",
        "A: Norway. Thank you. Norway. The last one didn't get through. So here put on your... There\nwere two men going to the Embassy and myself. And you'll find blackout. When we're over\nNorway, the lights will go on. But if, by chance, the pilot tells you...he's opening the door\nand you jump, all you have to do 1s just take this zipper and zip it up. Everyone asks me,\n\"When did you feel the most alive?\" I said, \"I think I felt the most alive in a parachute\n(laughing) when I didn't know what the next moment would bring?\" Anyway, we got\nthrough. And then I did my bit. We had the money and consent already from the Jewish\ncommunity there. They were able to make parcels and we started the...uh...parcel sending\nto...uh...Bergen-Belsen, Auschwitz...I don't think Auschwitz was 1n that vicinity. It was\nmostly in the English and the...uh...English area, near....where they could. And after 2 or 3\nmonths there, I again flew back and this time I flew back in a...uh...bomber where\nthe...American.... You see, in Sweden you had to be so careful because the Germans were\nalso there. It was neutral. Anyway, an...an American Captain and myself flew in the hub with\nthe...uh...with the crew. And we got to an air base in London. We didn't know where we\nwere flying. We got to an air base in London and we...we got out. All of...all the...the\nwhole...the whole base was around the plane. And we couldn't understand what was the big\nreception. Well, they had had a plane before that had been shot down, and they were\nwondering if this one would come through. So there we were! In order to get back to\nLondon, I had to sit in the camp there for a week, and...uh...that was a terrible thing because I\ncould...I was there and I saw the boys fly out in the morning. And not all the planes came\nback at night. Wasn't nice. And then one day they said to me, \"Alright, now there's a train\ngoing into London. Go ahead. Here's your ticket. Get into London.\u201d So I finally got back to\nLondon, went to the JDC office, and...uh...then Joe Schwartz was there and he said to me,\n\"You know the...uh...the landings are going to take place very soon, and we'll be going\ninto...uh...Germany...no, we'll be going into...uh ...France.\u201d And he said, \"I'd like you, if you\nwill, to...to cross when...when I tell you you can cross, when they...when they tell us you can\ncross, and ..uh...get into Belgium. But you have to get...you can't go into Belgium or Holland\nbecause the war is still on, but it...1n France, in Paris that we are preparing staff, and you will\nhave to get a uniform and you'll have to get army status for travel, but you can cross safely.\nSo I crossed. When they time when they told me I could go, I went. In fact, that's the\nway...the only way you could work. You didn't ask questions. And...uh...and you didn't ask\nfor a ticket either or a hotel. And...uh...I got to Paris, and there was...Paris was liberated\nalready. And...uh...there was the...uh...office, what they called the Adjutant General's office,\nAGO. So I got my uniform. I got my army card. I got the rank of Colonel, which meant that I\ncould fly back and forth all over Europe anytime with that card. And to get to Brussels,\nhowever, I had to take a train, and that took a whole day. Now, it takes an hour. Uh...I got to\nBrussels, and the Germans had just cleared Brussels. They had cleared the south of Holland.\nBelgium was finished. They...they had finished with Belgium. In fact, I think I was in\nBrussels on V.E. Day, when the war in Europe ended. Was the month of May V.E. day? I\nthink so. But I was made...I had an office in Brussels, but I was...the Germans were still\nin...1n Holland. They were just evacuating. Anyway...uh...I did get up to the south Eindhoven\nand there I found a Jewish community that had survived, went with an ambulance into\nAmsterdam. And we got into Amsterdam...I went with one of my staff. I wasn't alone. We\ngot into Amsterdam, I think 24 hours after...uh...the Germans left, evacuated. I met with the\nJewish community, got all the information we needed. I wasn't going to stay there. I stayed\nthere a few days, but it was really to get a...a...a. view of the situation and to be able to report\nback. I had that, and then it was time to go back to Brussels where my office was. And on the\nway back, I began to feel sick...tired. Tired! Tired! By the time I got to Brussels, I felt sick.\nAnd the doctor called...someone called the Belgium doctor, and he examined me and he said,\n\"In your condition, you'll never be able to work again.\u201d So...uh...I said, \"Alright, so I'll be\ngoing home.\u201d At the same time, Shave Mission, the American Shave Mission of Belgium\nwas in Brussels, and Eddie Warberg, who was also the President, then and later became\nPresident of JDC was also at Shave Mission. And...uh...he and I used to see each other. And\nwhen he heard that I was sick, he came right over, and he said, \"Don't take any Belgium\ndoctor.\u201d He said, \"Forget it. I'm putting you in the Army hospital.\u201d I was in the Army\nhospital for 3 days, and came out very healthy. And then I said to my boss, I said, \"Joe, I'm\ntired. I want to go back to the States, spend time with my family, take a vacation in Havana.\u201d\nHe said, \"Yal, but you're not going to stop?\" I said, \"No, I'm not going to stop. I just need a\nbreak.\u201d Which is exactly the way it worked, and when I got back, really had a good rest, felt\ngood, fine, he said, \"Laura, how would you like to go to Paris and take over the operation\nthere?\" That was already 46?",
        "Q: This is after the war is all over?",
        "A: The war is all over, thank God. Oh, sure. I said...uh...\"Paris? Why not? A very attractive\nidea.\u201d I got to Paris in June 46. Headquarters of JDC were already open, but we were not in\nthe same building. We had...they had their...their European office in one building and I was\nin the French...French operation. We had a different building. Joe Schwartz was there\nall...most of the time. That was the period when the camps were...the...the...uh...\nconcentration camps were being emptied out of the survivors. Germany was a big operation.\nUh...And Joe had his office in the office for France, in the office...in the...uh... Headquarters\noffice, and I had...I was just...just France. I didn't want any more. I had enough. And that was\na very challenging experience, a very challenging experience, because first of all I was\nalready in good shape again, you know. And...uh...I had the feeling that now I could do some\ncreat...some creative work. And...uh...it was a good idea, because that's where I met my\nhusband. He's a very active person in the Jewish community and...uh...we were absolutely\nand completely working on the same thing. I as a pro, he as a layman. And one of the things\nwe were doing and we were working with the illegal immigration to of Palestine with the\nJewish Brichah as we used to call it. The survivors that were going to go, but illegally to\nPalestine. That was 46. And we really...that...that was a wonderful period, because I was no\nlonger saving lives. I had a feeling of a...of a future. And then came the time when I decided\nthat it was time for me to get married. (laughing) Because I found...I had found the person\nthat I wanted to marry. (laughing) Some times when people in silly magazine interviews\nwould interview me, they'd say, \"What made you do all these things?\" I said, \"Well, I went\naround the world looking for my husband, and I found him.\"",
        "Q: And he found you.",
        "A: We found each other. Uh huh. And...uh...then...uh...we did. We just went to the __ and got\nmarried and that was the end of it. No big wedding. He'd lost his wife during the...uh...well,\nshe had really been with him all the time, but when the time came toward the end where they\nhad to...where they came back and could find no house, no nothing and all his library was\ngone. The...the Germans had taken everything from him, he says...he once said...he had a\nwonderful sense of humor and he used to say, \"The only time I enjoyed being...the only time\nI was ever on the sameness with the Rothchilds was when the Germans had my name on the\nlist of people they were after.\u201d (laughing) So, anyway after I married I said, \"Look, I'm so\ntired of running...very tired of running. How about our going to Israel?\" That was before\nthe...no...state was declared in 48...and this...I think I had this idea already in 47, but...uh...I\ndidn't feel that my job in Paris was finished in building a new community and helping the\ncommunity to build itself. For the first time I was able to use the real skills that I was trained\nfor. And so we made our decision that in 53, we would both...uh...just...that was after the\nstate already, we would go to Palestine...we would go to Israel. And there I continued\nworking and so does my husband, but...uh...I felt for the first time that I had roots. I had been\nfloating. And...uh...1t was really... uh...L..[I think the first time in all my years since\nConstantinople that I felt...uh...real good and at peace.",

        "A: That's right. That's right. My husband died in...uh...(pause)...1n 75. I continued working, but...",
        "Q: What sort of work were you doing?",
        "A: In Israel? Well, I was doing something more...much more creative. Something that I was...I\nwas learning at the same time that I was working cause I really knew nothing about\nhandicapped children. First of all, I was not working as an American there. I was working in\nthe...1n the frame of the JDC because there was the money, but I was...uh...not being paid in\ndollars anymore. I didn't want to. I really felt so strongly about that that I just wanted to be\none of the country. I had to learn Hebrew, but this was one language I didn't... wasn't born\nwith, but I do have an ear and I used to go to the...to a teacher at 6:30 in the morning and\ntake my lessons, and I was provided with a bilingual secretarial help, and I bluffed my way\nthrough Hebrew because of my ear, I could just pick up things. And...uh...after his death, I\nstill kept working, kept our house, and it was only really after my family in America began\nsaying, \"Look, why don't you come and join us?\" To this day, I don't know whether I did the\nright thing, but doesn't matter. Uh...I think the only time in all of my life that I ever felt that I\nbelonged, that I had roots...there were many things that I didn't like there, just as you don't\nlike anywhere else. You don't like everything.",

        "A: No. I have my own apartment. That was one condition because ...uh...I love them dearly, but\nI wanted to have my own life. And...uh...1t's been a very good life. It's been a very satisfying\nlife in the sense that I don't know how any of these things ever happened because I've never\nreached out. Uh...I have had students from the Hebrew University who are doing their thesis.\nOne about anti-Semitism in Japan. One about anti-Semitism in...uh...in...uh...Cuba, so\nthese...these young people catch up with me. And...uh...also, survivors of the Shanghai\nexperience have caught up with me.

I can\nonly be platonic. I'm a voracious reader. I think since I'm back I've enjoyed the pleasure of\ncatching up on my love for history, and understanding so many things that I never\nunderstood before when I was in action.",

        "A: I've lived through history, yes, and I'm very grateful for it, but...uh...I still feel that I...I don't\nknow how to put it. That if I had a wish at all and I...I say this honestly, I would rather be in\nIsrael than here, although I am very, very unhappy with what is happening there. But it...1t's\nbecome a part of me. Now does it go back to my father and his love for the country? He also\nmade the compromise and came to America. I don't know. I really don't know.",

        "A: My name 1s Laura Margolis.",
        "A: I was born in Constantinople, Turkey, in 1903.",
        "A: Yes. I was born in Turkey of Austria-Hungarian grand...grandparents and parents really.\nAnd...uh...my grandfather was Dr. Schwartz who...uh...was head of the ____ Jewish\ncommunity in...uh... Turkey and also consultant to the...uh...Sultan of ____. My father, on the\nother hand, was born in Russia. I'll get to the marriage part and how they met which is also\nhistory...uh...and as graduated high school. But because of the anti-Semitic regulations there,\nhe couldn't go on to college, so he decided to come to Palestine and see if there wasn't\nsomething there that he could do, and he spent a little bit of time in Palestine\nand...uh...decided that the thing for him to do was go to back to his father, get some money,\ngo to Berlin and study agronomy, and eventually settle in Palestine. Now in Germany where\nhe studied in Berlin, his professor of Botany was Dr. Otto Warberg, and...uh...there was a\nvery close warm friendships between student and professor. They somehow clicked. Parallel\nwith this period, my grandfather, Dr. Saloman Schwartz, in Constantinople had...uh...wanted\nsome of his own medicines patented in Germany and was also in contact with...uh...\nProfessor Otto Warberg for patenting his own medicines. This was all 19th century almost.\nAnd...uh...when my father graduated, his destination would have been Palestine straight, but\nDr. Otto Warberg suggested to him that he first go to Constantinople and meet Dr. Schwartz\nand maybe he would put off his going to Palestine for a few years because Dr.\nOtto...Professor Warberg's idea was that there was land up in Asia-Minor and...uh...that with\nmy father's training, he would...and with Dr. Warberg's money, he would be able to do some\nsettling of Jews who were already running from the Soviet...from Russia, not the Soviet\nUnion then...from Russia to Constantinople, and were becoming beggars on the streets, and\nhe was already in those years thinking of making them farmers eventually to go to Russia.\nThis was before EXKA_ which was established in Paris and EKA was a philantrophic Jewish\norganization that was settling Jews in Russia. And Dr....or Professor Warberg really wanted\nto do an experiment with his own money up in Asia-Minor. So my father agreed. He was\nyoung. There was no reason why he couldn't do this, and he adored his professor. He came to\nConstantinople to Dr. Schwartz who had all the contacts with the Turks and my mother\nopened the door, and that's where the romance started. Now, they went together up to Asia-\nMinor. That's where they spent their honeymoon. And it was...uh...absolutely wild up there.\nAnd...uh...they did...were able to bring some of the Jews who were just hanging around and\nbecoming beggars in Constantinople. They were prepared to take on these people, teach\nthem farming, agriculture, and train them for eventually going to Palestine.",
        "A: They were married...1903. I was born in 1903. I think they were born in 1904. No. No. No.\nOh, no. They were married in 1902, I think.",
        "A: That's right.",
        "A: Uh...How far back do you?",
        "A: From the time I came to the United States. Okay. (clearing throat) Well, I was 5 years old.\nNow when I came to the United States, anyone who knows anything about the Middle East\nknows that you don't have to be literate or educated in order to speak 5 or 6 or 7 languages.\nAnd...uh...I came to the United States speaking French, German, Greek, Turkish and\nSpanish. But no English. And...uh...my mother brought the...uh...we...we sailed over to the\nUnited States with a maid because she couldn't handle two little babies. And...uh...the maid\nwas Spanish speaking, so for several years after I entered kindergarten in Dayton, Ohio,\nthese languages became...had become a part of me. And...uh...some of this will later maybe\nexplain why I even got started in the work that I did much, much later in my life.\nUh...Anyway, we lived in America where we...my father went into the business of his\nfamily. My mother continued with her music. We were educated. We moved from Dayton,\nOhio, eventually to Lima, Ohio, where I went to...uh...where my father opened a shop. And\nwe ended up really...I won't go through all the different stages of where we lived in Ohio.\nWe ended up in Cleveland which was the important city for all of us. And that's where my\nfather...uh...went into the insurance business. My mother continued with her music and her\nhouse. But at the end of the first world war, 1918, my mother took my brother and myself\nback to Constantinople for a whole year. My grandfather had died and she very much\nwanted to see her own mother and sister. So I spent a whole year sitting on a bench in a\nGerman school. That was our first trip back. Then we returned to Cleveland.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I went to college at...uh...well, I started my...uh...my first...the college I went to\nsub...sub...not professional...uh...Ohio State, where I got my B.A. And then I continued with\nprofessional education at Western Reserve, School of Social Sciences they used to call it in\nmy day where I graduated as a social worker.",
        "A: Very traditional career. Uh...I worked...always worked in the Jewish community. The Jewish\nWelfare Society, I think it was called in those years, of Cleveland, Ohio. Case work.\nAnd...uh...I think I...1f I can remember at all, I did leave that work. I did leave Cleveland at\none point. I felt that I had...I wasn't growing. I wasn't learning anything. I was becoming\nrepetitive, and so I took a year off and...uh...came to New York. And...uh...without getting a\ndegree of any kind, but just wanting to get some new ideas. And so I spent a year in New\nYork, and then I was called back to Cleveland by the Jewish Welfare Society, offering me a\njob of training volunteers to do Big Sister work. And that became a challenge. Seems to me\nthat I was always reacting to challenges, you know. To do something different and\nsomething new. So I came back to Cleveland and trained volunteers for the National Council\nof Jewish Women, I think about 3 or 4 years. (Pause)",
        "A: Well, the Joint comes much later. I'll tell you first...uh...after a couple of years of that in\nCleveland, the same restlessness showed up. And I heard that there was a job in Buffalo,\nNew York. In fact, I was told that there was a job and they were looking for a Director of\ntheir Jewish welfare work. I went down for an interview. This was already in the 30s. And I\nwas hired. So I left Cleveland, and that's the first time I ever left my parents' home, and was\non my own. And...uh...started working for the Jewish wel...became...became actually the\nDirector of the Jewish Welfare Society of Buffalo, New York. It took a long time to set up a\ngood welfare service there which would be accept...where students would be accepted by\nthe...uh... University of Buffalo. It took me about 4 years to do that job. I liked Buffalo very\nmuch. I had many friends. I was settled there. And then one day I got a telephone call from\nNew York. 19...Christmas 1938. And it was Cecilia Rasoski on the telephone, head of\nthe...uh...not Joint at that point...1t was the...uh...Jewish Refugee Service because already\nHitler was in. Refugees were coming tn in the 30s, but they weren't running like much later.\nThey were people who had means. Most of them professionals who saw the handwriting on\nthe wall in time and got out. And we were receiving them in Buffalo like in other\ncommunities in the United States. And...uh...I thought I was really there for good until the\ntelephone call came from Cecilia Rasoski of the Refugee Service, which was working\ntogether with the JDC, and now we'll call it the Joint. And she said to me she had heard from\nsomewhere, somehow that I knew Spanish, and there was a very serious problem in Havana,\nCuba. Refugees were beginning to flee from Germany and from other countries in Europe,\nand...uh...the boats were coming in, but there were problems in Havana. The money at that\npoint was being given by the JDC, but the JDC didn't have the official...uh...it was working\ntogether with the National Refugee Service. I didn't even know that I was a\nemploy...employed by the Joint at that time. And so what Cecilia asked me to do was to,\nwith my experiences as a social worker, with my Spanish language...there were multiple\nproblems down in Havana. Would I just go out or go...nobody flew those days...sail to\nHavana and look over the picture and be helpful? Also with...because of my language\nabilities with the Cuban government, which at that point in time was very corrupt. It was the\ntime of Batista. (clearing throat) Some...uh...some people...there were two ways of coming\ninto Havana. One was to get a false visa somewhere in Germany for $165, and the other was\nto find...to...uh...to...uh... really...uh...have a $500 legal bond which relatives in America\nwould send...would send down to Havana. And...uh... would eventually ended in the S...in\nSt. Louis...the famous affair of the St. Louis, was that...uh...Jews were coming in or the\noffice I was heading was called the Joint Relief Committee. Already the Joint was coming in\nto it. Actually, the Joint financially always was there. And...uh...they...uh...those who had\nlegal $500 bond were allowed to land and some of them were taken into jails. It was very\nchaotic. And we heard that ships were on the way, and there was at...at one point my whole\ndiagnosis of the situation was that this is no job for just a person like myself to deal with the\ngovernment, and that's when I called the JDC on the phone direct.",
        "A: In Havana.",
        "A: Havana. Still in Havana. Expecting boats to come in, ships to come in with refugees and\nknowing that we wouldn't be allowed eventually to land them all because of this corruption\ninside of Cuba with Batista. And...uh...I phoned and told...uh...uh...whole story. And then we\nheard that the next ship that was to come in was the S.S. St. Louis. See, the JDC had offices\nin Paris, and we were in communications like this: New York, Paris, Havana. And so I\ninsisted that this 1s nothing which I felt I should handle alone. It was more political than\nsocial. My Spanish language didn't do any good. Uh...And they did. The JDC went down.\nAnd I can't remember the name of the lawyer at this point, but a very competent, legal\nlawyer...uh...man and was sent down by the JDC who...uh...had his ends with Batista. And I\ndon't think I have to repeat...there're books and stories. and everyone knows what the S:S. St.\nLouis meant. (Clearing throat) Our great problem was there were hundreds...I don't\nremember the statistics, but there were at least 5 to 6 hundred people on that ship. Only a few\ncould disembark who had real $500 bonds, and that ship was stationed there and not allowed\nto come into the harbor by the...by the Cubans, and it was going to go back to Germany.\nWell, the last thing we wanted was for that boat...that boat to go back to Germany because\nthat would have been the end. So for about a week...this 1s 39...uh...we in Havana, JDC New\nYork, JDC Paris...and it wasn't like today where you could fax and you could phone and you\ncould do things...there weren't all those tech...tech...technological facilities, but we could\ntelephone. I don't think we ever went to sleep. (laughing) Anyway, books have been written,\nstories been told. The S.S. did not go back to Germany. It was...disembarked in Holland,\nParis, London. (Pause) And from then on there was no more illegal immigration into\nHavana. It was all legal or...or not, but... And here I'd like to say that only...in...uh... in\nretrospect it became...the whole thing became so sad, although we thought and we did our\nbest to save these people from going back to Germany, many of them were caught when the\nGermans invaded Belgium, Holland, and France. But a lot of them were saved. Anyway, I\nthen decided that I was going to stay on and do a...a nice job, a quiet job in Havana. And one\nof the things that I learned...I call this my in-service training period. I knew nothing about\nAmerican immigration laws when I came there, but because of my own knowledge of the\nGerman language and I had a staff...we had a staff of refugees who knew many languages\nand the...uh...the American Consulate in Havana trusted us completely, we really became the\nright hand of the...of the...uh... American Consulate. Helping with interviews, with languages,\nwith evaluations. They did the technical jobs, but we would...could do the interviewing. We\ncould do...what they felt at least at that point...they really felt that what we could do was of\ngreat help to them. There were understaffed. And so I stayed on in Havana....39, 40, 41.\nAnd...uh...I...for some...I liked...I liked Cuba. I liked the climate. I liked the people. And I\nwasn't even restless at that point because we were...I thought we were doing a job. We were\nhelping to get people to the United States. But one day, one morning the phone rang. And the\nboss at that time was Mo Levitt, Moses Levitt. And he said, \"Laura, how are you doing?\"\n(laughing) 'How are you doing' was not an expression in those years, but he said, \"How are\nyou?\" I said, \"Fine.\u201d \"Busy?\" \"Yal, we're very busy here.\u201d Well...so...uh...he said, \"How\nwould you like to go to China?\" (Laughing) I have to laugh when I think of it. I said,\n\"China? Where in China?\" \"Shanghai.\u201d I said, \"Oh, Yal. Sure. I'd like to go.\u201d (Laughing) I\nhad no idea what he was talking about. I said, \"What's the problem?\" He said, \"Well, we've\nbeen...first of all we've had a request from the State Department that you should go to China.\nYou should go to Shanghai. Because refugees are pouring in from Germany. It's a open port.\nNo visas are necessary. The Chinese don't care who comes in. We've been sending money to\na Jewish committee of local leaders there and..uh...the Embassy is swamped. The Consulate\nis swamped. The Embassy was in Peking at that time. The Embassy needs help.\nThe...uh...the State Department doesn't have anyone who knows the German, and\nso...uh...and they've seen the kind of work you've been doing in Havana. Will you go?\" I\nsaid, \"Alright, I'll go.\u201d (Laughing) That's about as much of decision making as I've ever\nmake. Anyway, I flew up to get really some basic orientation of what was going on there.\nNothing was really going on. The Embassy...the Consulate was swamped. There was\nrefugees there who had visas, valid visas that the U.S. was ready for accept for their coming\nto the United States, but there was no personnel. So...uh...and then, of course, by the time I\ngot there, in 41...much later in 41, May 41...uh...there were almost...there were thousands\nand thousands of refugees. The situation as very chaotic. But I wasn't supposed to do much\nabout that. I was supposed to help the Consulate. Just in retrospect which is (clearing throat)\ndifferent from the way we travel now...uh...it took... went over on the first Pan American\nclipper that ever trans...that ever sailed in the Pacific. It took 5 days and 4 nights. But it was\nvery much more civilized than the way we travel now. Anyway, my...my...I had to get to\nHong Kong first. I couldn't get to China on...on a Pan American, and I had to wait for a\nwhole week in Hong Kong before I could get a ship up the coast to Shanghai. And when I\ngot there my first...first place I went to as the embassy...the Consulate. They gave me an\noffice, and I began interviewing, helping them. But at the same time I had to get to know the\nJewish community structure there of local residents. The chairman was an ex-Dutchman\ncalled Spillman, very nice man. And they were they ones who were receiving the JDC\nmoney to feed these 8,000 people who needed feeding. So...uh...all this was done with JDC\nmoney. I got to...I got to...uh...but the refugees were already...had already heard that\nsomeone from the Joint was there. I wasn't supposed to get mixed up...and they were coming\nto my hotel. At the same time I was sending in all my reports of the situation I found among\nthe refugees and how it was being handled. All of it went through the pouch, and I...very\nsoon...it took me a month. In June...I got there in May...1n June I issued a definite ultimatum\nto the JDC in which I wrote that if I were to stay on they would have to...this is not a one-\nman job. They would have to send out someone else to work with me. And I knew...I knew\nthat Manny Segal, who also was a social worker whom I knew from Buffalo who was\nworking with me in Havana, always said he'd like to come out. So I said, \"Either you send\nManny or someone else, but this is not a problem I can handle alone. Or else I'll come\nhome.\u201d In June 1941, that ultimatum had been issued. I had no reply yet, but in June 1941, I\nthink it was...the...the exact date isn't important. I think it was the 21st of June, the Germans\nhad walked into the Soviet Union. We, of course, knew this by radio, but it was very distant.\nSo I got a cable from the JDC a few days after that saying, \"In case communications are cut,\nyou are authorized to borrow on the promise of us to repay the amount of money which is\nrequired to take care of the needy\" (because we had 8,000 eating out of our kitchen; we had a\nhospital to support, and there was a school). Now these sums seem like nothing today, but in\nthose years it was a lot of money. And...uh...so I had this cable. That was June, July, August\n1941. And I was just beginning to get to know the whole refugee problem. I continued to\nwork with the...with the embassy...with the Consulate, but my focus was really upon helping\nthese people. And...uh...August 1941, I got another cable. SHIP OUT TO MANILA.\nDON'T...DON'T COME HOME. SHIP OUT TO MANILA AND AWAIT\nINSTRUCTIONS. Well, to get out at that point...the American marines were all leaving.\nThere was a feeling of war, but nobody was thinking of Pearl Harbor, of course, as you will\nhear later. The Japanese had been fighting the Chinese for years before that, but they had\nnever come into the international settlement. So to get a ship...the only ships coming out\nwere ships with Army soldiers. Through the American Embassy, I managed to get on the\nship. And I got to Manila. And I had the cable, DON'T COME HOME. So...uh...what does\none do? There were...there was a nice Jewish community there. I used to take trips around\nthe island, but I never could stay away very long because I was waiting for instructions. And\nfinally, this is already August. Right?\nQ; August 41.",
        "A: Huh? 41. Uh Huh. September. Telephone call. (clearing throat) September 1941.\nSeptember. Telephone call from Mo Levitt from New York. \"Laura, we've just come from\nWashington. We've been to the State Department. They assure us there will be no war in the\nFar East.\u201d You can go back and Manny Segal is on his way. So I went back. And it was clear\nthat we were taking over the whole program, using the local Jewish committee as advisory,\nbut the money was coming to...1n the bank to us. Manny Segal arrived December Ist, 1941.\nBy that time I had a pretty good idea what was going on over in Hong Q which 1s a section\nof Shanghai where the Japanese were already...had already occupied, but they had not come\nover to the International Settlement yet. The refugees were all...those who couldn't afford to\nstay in the International Settlement were all housed in the Japanese sector. Uh...I had then,\nbefore Manny came, I had a pretty good idea what the problems were and what kind of\nreorganization was required, you know. So...uh...Manny arrived, I think it was December Ist,\nand I gave him an orientation and we started going out to Hong Q, and we organizing the\nwhole thing and in Shanghai on December 8th in the morning in...uh...uh...Hawaii...where\nthe Japanese struck.",
        "A: Pearl Harbor where the Japanese struck. It was December 7th, 1941. By us, it was December\n8th, 4:00 AM. And our hotel was on the...on the _____, on the shore where all the ships were.\nShips of all nations. Was the biggest port of China. We were bombed out of our hotel beds\npractically with the bombing. And we looked out the window and all the ships in the Harbor\nwere burning. Japanese had come across the bridge, marched into our hotel, occupied the\nhotel. We were at war. That was it. People gathering in the streets below. We were...the first\nthing we did when we realized what it was all about was to tear up all the reports we had\nbeen sending to New York. We always kept...we didn't have a secretary. You couldn't\ntrust...you couldn't have a secretary. You couldn't trust anyone at that point. We had been\nkeeping carbon copies for ourselves and doing our own typing. But we realized we were at\nwar and this is it, so the first thing we did, Manny and I, was to tear up all our papers, flush it\ndown the toilet. Because we didn't know what was going to happen next. We were held in\nour rooms...there was an English broadcasting. The Japanese took over and broadcast in\nEnglish. We were just sitting there and watching broadcasting...listening to broadcasting.\nAnd down below people just mulling. Mulling, mulling, mulling. Millions of people. Couple\nof times, we went down to the lobby. We couldn't go out because every door, every exit,\nthere were Japanese soldiers with bayonets. Then we got...uh...we were just listening...we\nwere able to get food. Uh...we were listening to the radio the whole time, what was next. I\nthink it was about 6 o'clock in the evening when the English broadcasting came over saying\nthat people are now free to go out. So we went out and some friends of ours already, both\nChinese and foreigners, were downstairs waiting for us. They had been waiting for us all day\nlong. We went out and we had a good Chinese dinner. But what do we did next? Now,\nShanghai in the pre-Pearl Harbor days was a very social kind of place. And...uh...I had to go\nthrough...my round...my round of dinner parties and entertainment and at many of these\naffairs, horse races, I had met Captain...Japanese Captain Inasuka. Captain Inasuka had been\nliving in Shanghai for many years. He's Japanese. And...uh...I was told that he was very...he\nliked Jews. And that after that...Pearl Harbor, he had moved into the same hotel that we are\nliving in, which was the best hotel in Shanghai and he was already up in the Pent House. He\nhad already occupied Sir Victor Sassoon's Penthouse. So what do we do next? Refugees\nwere in the lobby, scared stiff. They were all stateless. No passports. No identify of any kind.\nAnd I, Manny and I talked it over. I said, \"Manny, go down and tell them we're working on\nit. Not to get excited. Not to worry. Something's bound to happen.\u201d And I made this decision.\nI had my telegram from JDC that I could raise money to be repaid at the end of the\nhostilities, wherever these hostilities would be. So I phoned up to Captain Inasuka. He\nremembered me...he remembered me because we had been to social affairs together and\nreceived me very nicely. Made the tea ceremony. Very nice. Very cordial. Then we got to\nthe nitty gritty of what I came for. Showed him the cable. (Pause) And I told him that I was\nprepared to help him. It's true that I am an enemy alien. I don't know what's going to happen\nwith me ext, but for the foreseeable future apparently I'm free, and I'm able to help him,\nmeaning helping the Japanese. That I would be able to take over, Manny and I, the whole\noperation in Shanghai and keep feeding the people if he would give me permission to raise\nthe money. Because without his permission I wouldn't be able to do it. And I think my\nlast...what was my last sentence, which I didn't learn in the school of social work. Uh...I said,\n\"Look,\" I said, \"You, as an occupying power, cannot afford to have hungry people riot.\nYou're responsible for them. On the other hand, I can help you, so they won't riot if you'll\ngive me an okay to raise the money.\u201d And he did it. On one condition. That I do not...now\nwhat was it he said, \"I do not take money from enemy aliens,\" meaning Europeans, but\nwherever I could raise it I...he also did something else that was very nice. The banks were\nclosed. We had a remittance a few days before Pearl Harbor of money which I was already\ncoming in our name, Joint Distribution Committee. He arranged for the bank to open so that\nwe could get money out, because it was there, before we could start raising money. And then\nhe also...then the American Red Cross had lots of cracked wheat which had been shipped\nover and stored and I...I had contact with the American Red Cross and they said, \"Look, take\nit.\u201d But I had to have his permission. He gave it to me. So we had cereals that we could give\nto our kitchens. That's about where we were when I had to start raising the money. Break\u2019?",
        "A: Now. People who... There was plenty of money. Shanghai was a city of wheelers and dealers\nwith all kinds of black money, black market money. (Pause) I let it get around that we had\nsomething to sell. And money started coming in. The banks opened. Eventually the money\nstarted coming in and Manny and I took over. We went out to Hong Q every day. The whole\nyear of 1942 we were free. We weren't interned yet. And...uh...",
        "A: We need a break now. We really do.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2\nA; Yes. Anyway, it was clear we were beginning to raise money and...uh...all of 1942, and we\ntook over the program in Hong Q and...uh...we were giving IOU's to the people. And we also\nset up an entirely new committee. The committee which where...which I found when I\noriginally came to Shanghai, most of them had already been interned by the Japanese. They\nweren't around anymore. And...uh...uh...so that I...we began to take on some of the old\ntimers...uh...Polish, non---non-enemy nationals, Jewish...all Jewish who had been there for a\nlong time and whom we could trust. And gradually while on the one hand we were working\nin Hong Q and trying to set up the programs for the helping and the hospital and the money\nad all that and raising the money, we were also beginning to train another committee,\nvoluntary committee, to take over because it began to be clear that we were not going to be\nable to stay out forever because we were enemy aliens. And we got a very good committee.\nVery, very good committee. Many of them had been...uh...there for many years. Russians\nwho had fled the revolution and who had made their home 1n Shanghai and who were very\nfine community leaders and whom we could trust. And the...the one committee that we set\nup, Mr. Bitker...we called it the Bitker Committee, Mr. Bitker was the Chairman, and we felt\nvery secure in giving him power of attorney after...1f anything should happen to us to ensure\nthat part. Then, of course, in the middle of all this, we did a very...uh...unusual thing. Uh...the\nold kitchens that were feeding the refugees when we arrived...when we took over, were very\nold Chinese kitchens. And they had to be stoked all the time with coal and more money was\ngoing...we made an analysis that more money was going into coal than into nutrition. So\nwhat can we do? Then we heard that one day that out in the French concession of Shanghai,\nthere were some new boilers that had just arrived the day before Pearl Harbor and were\nstanding there...uh...assigned to the Sassoon Company, but were never used. So I went up to\nthe Sassoon Company, which was still in business at that point, and I asked them for\npermission and they said, \"We'd be glad to give them to you but they...we as British...as a\nBritish company, can't give you that permission. We're as much enemy aliens as you are.\u201d So\nwhat did we do? We had a very good friend, a Polish engineer who looked at\nthose...uh...boilers and said, \"Laura, you've got to get them.\u201d So one night when it was dark\nand...uh...there were millions of people buzzing around on the streets all the time and\nthe...and the rickshaws were going back and forth and nobody was paying any attention to\nanybody. We hired a group of coolies and this engineer, Manny and I went out to the French\nconcession and we highjacked the two big (laughing) boilers, and brought them through the\nmasses of people going into the...buzzing around in the streets of Shanghai. Nobody was\npaying any attention to us. Taking them over the bridge, and we got them to Hong Q. And\nfrom that point on, we built a new kitchen which was really giving nutrition and we burned\nup the old kitchens. That's one of our fun stories. Anyway, it got to be around the end\nof...uh...October, November 42, the rumors came and one day we were notified by\nradio...there were no television in those years...that the Japanese authorities are asking all\nenemy aliens to prepare themselves for internment. You would be allowed to take in\nanything you like to your camp. They didn't tell us which camp at that point. Your beds,\nyour...uh...linens, anything that you want to take in. Food...this is...they were beginning to\nprepare us. And then Manny got notified (pause) I think it was January 43 already that he\nwas going to an all-men's camp over in Paoting. I had not received a notice yet. So we\npacked him off, and a month later I got notice. And...uh...I actually took my own folding bed\nand my own mattress and...and...uh....a trunk full of canned goods and stuff and things\nand...and then...the...the Japanese were a peculiar race. It's a...an interesting group of people.\nUh...They were very, very permission with us, and I was taken to another camp of couples,\nand single men and single women outside of Shanghai. Right now the name of the camp\nescapes me, but it isn't important. It was the beginning of 43, I think February or something\nlike that. We got to the camp which, of course, was surrounded by barbed wire. It was a old\nschool house that had been bombed during the Japanese-Chinese wars and it was leaking\nhere and there and everywhere. And...uh...I got into a room with 40 women, and...uh...first\nthing I did, when I saw the room was to see at the very end there were windows\ngoing...getting out to the campus. It was an old school. It had a beautiful campus, and I\nquickly took my bed and dumped it in that area so that I would...all the 40 women would be\nin back of me and I would see the campus. That was the first thing I thought of. Anyway, it\nwas very cold. That night we turned on...they gave us fuel and they gave us an oven...stoves,\nand all of them lit...all of them were smoking, and so that was the end of that. We never\nburned them again. We just put on more clothes. Now, the Japanese were very good to us I\nthink. Now some of the...some of the high and mighty people who had been the old\nShanghailanders that we called it, were very resentful of having to be in those conditions and\nunder the Japanese. But that's something I've never had. I've never had any kind of feeling\nabout race, color, anything. I think they were absolutely correct in terms of the Geneva\nconvention. They gave us everything that was due to us. They brought in the food. We had to\ncook it ourselves. And they said to us, \"Listen, get organized. Put up your committees. Do\nwhat you like. We'll bring in the food. And organize your own social activities. Do anything\nyou like, but do it yourselves, knowing that we are here and that we are supervising.\u201d And so\nthe first thing that got...one of the things that go around in the camp was that I was there.\nAnd someone came to me and said, \"We want you to chair our committee because you've\nhad experience.\u201d I said, \"I am Laura Margolis with no experience. I am a number. I have a\nnumber. I don't want to be...I don't want to be known. I don't want to have anything to do\nwith all this. But you had to choose two...uh...everybody had to take on two jobs. So I made\navery quick ___ as we say. I...uh...realized that when you're near the food, it's important so I\ntook kitchen duty. And...uh...the other thing was...oh...the camp...there was barbed wire all\naround the camp. And out there were fields, and we were supposed to grow are own\nvegetables. And I've always liked farming anyway so...uh...and just being out of it is...1s very\nimportant for me. So I chose the second chore and that was to go out and work on the farm.\nAnd that worked very well. But then came 4, 5, 6 months of that and people were getting\nsick. And that's natural in all of China. I mean they were carrying them out by the dozens to\nthe hospitals, diarrhea and all that kind of thing. And...uh...nothing was happening to me. I\nwas as healthy as a horse. But I decided I had to get out because I just could stand the\ncollective. So I knew I wasn't going to commit suicide but I had sleeping pills and I wasn't\ngoing to commit suicide. But what I did was to eat less, grow weaker and...uh...put on my\nSarah Burnhart act. And so I was sent to the doctor...to the doctor in the camp who was an\nAmerican doctor. And he gave me a permit to get out to the hospital because he said I was\nvery sick, which I wasn't. And I got out to the...uh...hospital. It was a English hospital and\nDr. Veal who an Italian was the head of the hospital and he remembered me from...from\ncontacts we had before Pearl Harbor. And they put me in a ward, and when he came to make\nhis rounds in the evening and he saw me there, he caught on immediately because no matter\nwhat he did, I was in good shape. But he said I was very sick and so he said, \"Now, there are\ntwo things. You shouldn't be in a ward. I can get you a private room, but if you want a\nprivate room you'll have to...I have to notify...I have to write to Japan for permission. But I\ncan give you a room with another lady on my own responsibility.\u201d I said, \"I'd rather take the\nlady...the room with the lady.\u2019 And what happened there was that she was really a lovely,\nlovely Russian girl who was a mistress of the director of the German bank in Shanghai and\nhe used to come to visit her every day. And I had no right for visitors. And one day he said to\nme...he said, \"You know,\" he said, \"You are not allowed visitors. Wouldn't you like to tell\nyour friends outside that they can use my friend's name and come up and see you?\" And\nthat's the way I saw Mr. Bitker. I saw my friends. I got...I got the message out. And...uh...I\nwas there for 3 months. They kept me out in the hospital and then came August...July,\nAugust 43. Right? And...uh...Italy surrendered in the war...gave up as being one of the Axis\nand the next morning when that happened Dr. Veal came right in to see me and he said,\n\"Laura, now I'm an enemy alien and I don't know what's going to be with me next, but before\ncoming here I went to the Swiss Consulate because the Swiss had the authority over all\nenemy aliens.\u201d And he said, \"You're on the list for the next prisoner of war exchange. So I'm\ngoing to release you now. You go back, start packing and in September you will...uh...be\nre...on that...on that exchange. Your name 1s on it.\u201d He said I also found out that your name\nwas on the first exchange which was a diplomatic exchange, but the Japanese took you off\nbecause they needed you. (Laughing) So I went back. Before I went back, I sw Bitker once.\nFor the last time! And I got a...because he had power of attorney to raise money and in...1n\nthe name of the JDC to repay. And...uh...nobody knew when the war would end you know.\nSo I said, \"Look, I'm going to be out of this pretty soon. Just give me a...uh...up to date\naccount of what the situation 1s financially so I can get it back to New York. Well, he gave\nme the whole accounting up-to-date. When we were prepared in our camp...that was\nSeptember 43, that we were to pack and we were going to go on a ship. This was the\nbeginning of our repatriation exchange of prisoners of war. I had always these figures, and I\ntook toilet paper because I knew that there would be a body of search...body search before\nthey...before we were left to go. And...uh...I took the...uh...the toilet paper. I wrote every\npiece of...all the figures down, rolled it up and put it in the rubber pants...the... uh...top of my\npanties, so that...uh...1t was invisible and... uh...started packing. And in September 43, I\nforget the date exactly, we were...those of us who were on the list from our camp and from\nother camps were taken on a...to go on a Japanese ship as far as Goa where the exchange\nwould take place. That was in...1t was Portugese Goa which was part of the Indian mainland.\nAnd...uh...we got on that ship. It was...uh...a ship...a Japanese ship which had a passenger\ncapacity for about 100, and we were hundred and...one thousand five hundred, because we\npicked up people on the way. And what they gave us women were...uh...like stalls hat you\nput horses on and mattresses. And the mattresses were full of fleas. So the first...the first\nnight we took all our mattresses (laughing)",
        "A: The first...uh...night...we tried to sleep with those fleas, but we couldn't. We took...all of us\nwomen, took all the mattresses out and threw them into the Chinese sea and slept on board.\nJust took a blanket and slept on board all the way through. We picked up people in the\nPhilippines. We picked up people in...uh...uh...what was...before Vietnam, what was it? A\nFrench...uh...anyhow, French port, and finally we got to Goa, where they...uh... Japanese\nwere coming in on the beautiful, beautiful, beautiful... uh...uh...Swedish ship, the Gripsholm.\nAnd...uh... so we packed. We got...they got...they...they...uh...uh... they were coming from\ntheir beautiful ship to our Japanese ship and we were leaving the Japanese ship to go on to\nthe Gripsholm. And it was...it was like...uh...a school, you know, each one going a different\ndirection, not looking at each other. And when I got on to the Gripsholm, I felt like for the\nfirst time I was totally free. And it was my 40th birthday. And...uh...of course, we had the\nsmorgasbord and we had a swimming pool, and then we started with the _Gripsholm. From\nthere on, it was all the way around South Africa where we stopped for 2 nights and\nthe...uh...uh... Jewish community there took us and we had...it was fun. And then around\nthe...around the Cape. That's right. We went around the Cape up to South Atlantic to Rio de\nJaneiro. And by...we got to Rio, the JDC had sent someone down to meet me, and...uh...to\ngive me money. I didn't have a penny. And to...we were there for 2 nights, and so we went\ndancing. And it was fun, and then we up the South Atlantic to New York. And...uh...1n New\nYork, I got a message, we're not allowed...uh...ships were not allowed to dock in New York.\nNo. Ships were allowed to dock...uh...to dock, but no one was allowed to come to the port. It\nwas the height of the war. And the first shock I had was when I got the message that I should\ncome to the...to which hotel I should come, that the...my friends in the JDC were going to be\nthere...uh...that New York was standing. All the news we had...uh...way back in...in the...in\nthe camps was that bomb...that...that the Hell had been bombed out of New York, and here\nwere people were complaining about rations. Anyway, it was a wonderful, wonderful\nreunion. And...uh...I stayed in New York, and then before I was allowed to even go and see\nmy family in Cleveland, I went to...uh...we went to...uh... Washington to give a report. I went\nwith Joseph Swartz who was the then Director of the JDC in Europe, and with Mo Levitt and\nmyself, we...we went by train to Washington. UNRRA had already become organized. That\nwas the first time I knew about Hitler. I knew about Jews in camps, but I never, never\nknew...never heard the words Auschwitz, Bergen-Belsen, and all that had really happened. I\nwas...had been completely detached from all that. And (pause) the JDC at that point was\ngiving a report. We went to the State Department. We reported to...uh... UNRRA, and then\nto the Treasury, Morganthal. Now, the JDC had been totally cut off from any communication\nwith me. They could not get an okay from the Treasury, I guess, to send money through\nSwitzerland to Mr. Bitker. And so we went to the Treasury and I...we had a long session with\nMorganthal, and gave him the whole story of how it's working. And he had one question.\nAre the Japanese getting any of this money? And I said, \"Not a penny. It's all in the hands of\nthe Bitker Committee,\" and I said, \"This is what is keeping the 8,000 people we are feeding\nalive.\u201d And it was from that point on that the Treasury gave the JDC...this is the way...this is\nthe way I remember it...uh...authorization, because we always had a delegate in...uh...during\nall the wars. We always had a delegate in Switzerland. Sally Myer, a very famous,\ninteresting man, a Swiss. And they...we were able to give an okay. They gave\nus... Morganthal gave us an okay to send money...uh...to the Bitker committee to keep the\n8,000 Jews alive. Now, of course, the JDC was sweet and very nice and...and...uh...they put\nme in the hospital. They wanted to be sure that I (laughing) was okay, and I came out okay.\nAnd then they said, \"Laura, you've really had it. We have another job. We don't want you to\nleave us, but we have another job for you. That's in Santi de Mingo, where there\nwere...uh...Jewish farmers.\u201d They were training refugees to be Jewish farmers 1n Santi de\nMingo. After I heard what I heard, I said, \"No. I'm not going to go and sit under a palm tree\nanymore. I can't do that.\u201d \"I...uh...\", said, \"that if you don't, it's alright. Don't want to send me\nto Europe, it's okay with me. I'll go to Europe with UNRRA because they'll be going.\u201d So\nthat's...so one night I had dinner with Dr. Joseph Swartz who was the boss\nin...uh...1n...uh...Paris, in Europe...not...at that time our office was in Lisbon, Portugal, and\nneutral countries. We operated in Europe through neutral countries. And...uh...he said,\n\"Laura, forget it. You're coming with me to...uh...uh...Lisbon\" where we had our office. And\nhe said, \"I have two assignments for you in Europe.\u201d Alright, my first assignment...[...I\nshipped off. I shipped off to Portugal, and the first job that I did there was I...I went up to\nSpain. Uh...We're already in 40...45, aren't we? I think so. Uh...The...France was occupied as\nwe all know by the...uh...Germans and there were in...1nternment camps in France and\nchildren were becoming separated from their parents. The parents were being sent to where\nthey were being sent. The children were hanging around and so the underground...the Jewish\nresistance movement in France organized a transport of children without parents at that point\nto be brought over the Pyrenees to Barcelona. But there was no one in Barcelona...we had an\noffice in Barcelona, but there was no one who would know how to handle children, who\nwould know how to handle...they could handle the money, the financial...uh...but we needed\nto set up a children's home to receive these children and to...uh...to feed them and to...uh...to\nstaff the place and Dr. Swartz asked me if I would do that, and I certainly did. I certainly\nwould. And so I spent 2 or 3 months up in Barcelona, going up...into the border lines, with\nthe...uh...staff, ..the rest of the staff and bringing the kids down, and...uh...staffing the whole\nplace so that the children wouldn't be in a panic. And thus...and those children...many, many\nyears later, I met as grownup mothers and fathers in...in Israel. We had a nice reunion.\nAnyway, when that job was done, I went back to...uh...to...uh...what do you call it?\nTo...uh...Lisbon, and then Joe said to me, \"Look, Laura. I need someone to fly to Sweden.\u201d\nSo I said, \"Sweden's neutral. What's the problem?\" He said, \"Yes, but it's because it's neutral\nthat we are able through the ___ the German...the Jewish...the...uh...Swedish-Jewish\ncommunity to send parcels of food into the Germans...the camps in Germany for our people.\nAnd he said, \"I would like very much...it means...it's a dangerous job. You have to hang\naround London for awhile and the...uh...the...uh... Germans are bombing the Hell out of\nLondon still. The flight, which is not a civilian flight, from somewhere in the British Isles\nand we never know where it's going to be from...to Sweden is not going to be an easy one.\nWill you do it?\" I said, \"Okay, I'll do it.\u201d I flew to London. And there's a very, very nice\nstory in connection with that. London, of course, was bombed out as we all know. I had a\nreservation in the hotel for 2 nights. I could hear the\nB-1s, but I didn't have the sense...I didn't have enough sense...I slept through them. And then,\nI was told by the hotel that my reservation was out, to please pack and go. Where do I go? I\ndidn't know anybody in London. I knew where the JDC office was in London. So I took\nmy...aS we say in German, my __, packed up, went to the office. And it was a bank holiday.\nOf course, it was closed. But the...uh...the janitor was there. I told him who I was and I said,\n\"Just leave me in the office, that's all. Everybody will be in the office tomorrow, and they'll\ntake care of me. And tonight I'm alright, so I'll put my fur coat on the floor and I'll sleep on\nthe floor. What else can I do?\" He let me in, and as I'm...just as I'm getting in the phone\nrings. I'll tell you there is a God that watches over me. The phone rings, and who do you\nthink it is? It's one of the couples from Shanghai that I was able to get out in the last minute\nthrough my work in the Consulate through their uncle in New York. And they went on to\nLondon and this uncle had been...had been following me and wondering from\nJDC...constantly asking from JDC where is she now? And found out that I was in London,\ntold his niece and nephew where I was. They phoned me at the office, came over right away,\nand took me to their house. Didn't have to sleep on the floor. Alright? Then I hung around\nLondon, and then I got all through this...all through the American Embassy. I had to report\neveryday...I had to report every place where I was in case we got the clearance to...to fly.\nSo...uh...one day when I checked in they said, \"You're flying tomorrow morning.\u201d And we\nwere picked up. All this was done for us. We didn't have to do a thing. Uh...We flew to\nsomewhere...I've never figured it out yet on the Iris sea. And the only other...other two\npeople who were in the place cause no...cause there was no civilian flying...uh...were there\nand...uh...we were just hanging around waiting for orders what to do next. Just like the\nArmy. And then one day we were picked up and taken to the airport and told that we had to\nget into parachutes. This was never told to us before. Because the last plane that flew over to\nSweden was...uh...bombed down over the Fjords by the Germans who were in...uh...what's\nthe other Scandinavian country? Huh?",
        "A: Denmark. Yal. Not Denmark. No. The other one.",
        "A: Norway. Thank you. Norway. The last one didn't get through. So here put on your... There\nwere two men going to the Embassy and myself. And you'll find blackout. When we're over\nNorway, the lights will go on. But if, by chance, the pilot tells you...he's opening the door\nand you jump, all you have to do 1s just take this zipper and zip it up. Everyone asks me,\n\"When did you feel the most alive?\" I said, \"I think I felt the most alive in a parachute\n(laughing) when I didn't know what the next moment would bring?\" Anyway, we got\nthrough. And then I did my bit. We had the money and consent already from the Jewish\ncommunity there. They were able to make parcels and we started the...uh...parcel sending\nto...uh...Bergen-Belsen, Auschwitz...I don't think Auschwitz was 1n that vicinity. It was\nmostly in the English and the...uh...English area, near....where they could. And after 2 or 3\nmonths there, I again flew back and this time I flew back in a...uh...bomber where\nthe...American.... You see, in Sweden you had to be so careful because the Germans were\nalso there. It was neutral. Anyway, an...an American Captain and myself flew in the hub with\nthe...uh...with the crew. And we got to an air base in London. We didn't know where we\nwere flying. We got to an air base in London and we...we got out. All of...all the...the\nwhole...the whole base was around the plane. And we couldn't understand what was the big\nreception. Well, they had had a plane before that had been shot down, and they were\nwondering if this one would come through. So there we were! In order to get back to\nLondon, I had to sit in the camp there for a week, and...uh...that was a terrible thing because I\ncould...I was there and I saw the boys fly out in the morning. And not all the planes came\nback at night. Wasn't nice. And then one day they said to me, \"Alright, now there's a train\ngoing into London. Go ahead. Here's your ticket. Get into London.\u201d So I finally got back to\nLondon, went to the JDC office, and...uh...then Joe Schwartz was there and he said to me,\n\"You know the...uh...the landings are going to take place very soon, and we'll be going\ninto...uh...Germany...no, we'll be going into...uh ...France.\u201d And he said, \"I'd like you, if you\nwill, to...to cross when...when I tell you you can cross, when they...when they tell us you can\ncross, and ..uh...get into Belgium. But you have to get...you can't go into Belgium or Holland\nbecause the war is still on, but it...1n France, in Paris that we are preparing staff, and you will\nhave to get a uniform and you'll have to get army status for travel, but you can cross safely.\nSo I crossed. When they time when they told me I could go, I went. In fact, that's the\nway...the only way you could work. You didn't ask questions. And...uh...and you didn't ask\nfor a ticket either or a hotel. And...uh...I got to Paris, and there was...Paris was liberated\nalready. And...uh...there was the...uh...office, what they called the Adjutant General's office,\nAGO. So I got my uniform. I got my army card. I got the rank of Colonel, which meant that I\ncould fly back and forth all over Europe anytime with that card. And to get to Brussels,\nhowever, I had to take a train, and that took a whole day. Now, it takes an hour. Uh...I got to\nBrussels, and the Germans had just cleared Brussels. They had cleared the south of Holland.\nBelgium was finished. They...they had finished with Belgium. In fact, I think I was in\nBrussels on V.E. Day, when the war in Europe ended. Was the month of May V.E. day? I\nthink so. But I was made...I had an office in Brussels, but I was...the Germans were still\nin...1n Holland. They were just evacuating. Anyway...uh...I did get up to the south Eindhoven\nand there I found a Jewish community that had survived, went with an ambulance into\nAmsterdam. And we got into Amsterdam...I went with one of my staff. I wasn't alone. We\ngot into Amsterdam, I think 24 hours after...uh...the Germans left, evacuated. I met with the\nJewish community, got all the information we needed. I wasn't going to stay there. I stayed\nthere a few days, but it was really to get a...a...a. view of the situation and to be able to report\nback. I had that, and then it was time to go back to Brussels where my office was. And on the\nway back, I began to feel sick...tired. Tired! Tired! By the time I got to Brussels, I felt sick.\nAnd the doctor called...someone called the Belgium doctor, and he examined me and he said,\n\"In your condition, you'll never be able to work again.\u201d So...uh...I said, \"Alright, so I'll be\ngoing home.\u201d At the same time, Shave Mission, the American Shave Mission of Belgium\nwas in Brussels, and Eddie Warberg, who was also the President, then and later became\nPresident of JDC was also at Shave Mission. And...uh...he and I used to see each other. And\nwhen he heard that I was sick, he came right over, and he said, \"Don't take any Belgium\ndoctor.\u201d He said, \"Forget it. I'm putting you in the Army hospital.\u201d I was in the Army\nhospital for 3 days, and came out very healthy. And then I said to my boss, I said, \"Joe, I'm\ntired. I want to go back to the States, spend time with my family, take a vacation in Havana.\u201d\nHe said, \"Yal, but you're not going to stop?\" I said, \"No, I'm not going to stop. I just need a\nbreak.\u201d Which is exactly the way it worked, and when I got back, really had a good rest, felt\ngood, fine, he said, \"Laura, how would you like to go to Paris and take over the operation\nthere?\" That was already 46?",
        "A: The war is all over, thank God. Oh, sure. I said...uh...\"Paris? Why not? A very attractive\nidea.\u201d I got to Paris in June 46. Headquarters of JDC were already open, but we were not in\nthe same building. We had...they had their...their European office in one building and I was\nin the French...French operation. We had a different building. Joe Schwartz was there\nall...most of the time. That was the period when the camps were...the...the...uh...\nconcentration camps were being emptied out of the survivors. Germany was a big operation.\nUh...And Joe had his office in the office for France, in the office...in the...uh... Headquarters\noffice, and I had...I was just...just France. I didn't want any more. I had enough. And that was\na very challenging experience, a very challenging experience, because first of all I was\nalready in good shape again, you know. And...uh...I had the feeling that now I could do some\ncreat...some creative work. And...uh...it was a good idea, because that's where I met my\nhusband. He's a very active person in the Jewish community and...uh...we were absolutely\nand completely working on the same thing. I as a pro, he as a layman. And one of the things\nwe were doing and we were working with the illegal immigration to of Palestine with the\nJewish Brichah as we used to call it. The survivors that were going to go, but illegally to\nPalestine. That was 46. And we really...that...that was a wonderful period, because I was no\nlonger saving lives. I had a feeling of a...of a future. And then came the time when I decided\nthat it was time for me to get married. (laughing) Because I found...I had found the person\nthat I wanted to marry. (laughing) Some times when people in silly magazine interviews\nwould interview me, they'd say, \"What made you do all these things?\" I said, \"Well, I went\naround the world looking for my husband, and I found him.\"",
        "A: We found each other. Uh huh. And...uh...then...uh...we did. We just went to the __ and got\nmarried and that was the end of it. No big wedding. He'd lost his wife during the...uh...well,\nshe had really been with him all the time, but when the time came toward the end where they\nhad to...where they came back and could find no house, no nothing and all his library was\ngone. The...the Germans had taken everything from him, he says...he once said...he had a\nwonderful sense of humor and he used to say, \"The only time I enjoyed being...the only time\nI was ever on the sameness with the Rothchilds was when the Germans had my name on the\nlist of people they were after.\u201d (laughing) So, anyway after I married I said, \"Look, I'm so\ntired of running...very tired of running. How about our going to Israel?\" That was before\nthe...no...state was declared in 48...and this...I think I had this idea already in 47, but...uh...I\ndidn't feel that my job in Paris was finished in building a new community and helping the\ncommunity to build itself. For the first time I was able to use the real skills that I was trained\nfor. And so we made our decision that in 53, we would both...uh...just...that was after the\nstate already, we would go to Palestine...we would go to Israel. And there I continued\nworking and so does my husband, but...uh...I felt for the first time that I had roots. I had been\nfloating. And...uh...1t was really... uh...L..[I think the first time in all my years since\nConstantinople that I felt...uh...real good and at peace.",
        "A: 30 years. Yal.",
        "A: Uh?",
        "A: I didn't hear you.",
        "A: That's right. That's right. My husband died in...uh...(pause)...1n 75. I continued working, but...",
        "A: In Israel? Well, I was doing something more...much more creative. Something that I was...I\nwas learning at the same time that I was working cause I really knew nothing about\nhandicapped children. First of all, I was not working as an American there. I was working in\nthe...1n the frame of the JDC because there was the money, but I was...uh...not being paid in\ndollars anymore. I didn't want to. I really felt so strongly about that that I just wanted to be\none of the country. I had to learn Hebrew, but this was one language I didn't... wasn't born\nwith, but I do have an ear and I used to go to the...to a teacher at 6:30 in the morning and\ntake my lessons, and I was provided with a bilingual secretarial help, and I bluffed my way\nthrough Hebrew because of my ear, I could just pick up things. And...uh...after his death, I\nstill kept working, kept our house, and it was only really after my family in America began\nsaying, \"Look, why don't you come and join us?\" To this day, I don't know whether I did the\nright thing, but doesn't matter. Uh...I think the only time in all of my life that I ever felt that I\nbelonged, that I had roots...there were many things that I didn't like there, just as you don't\nlike anywhere else. You don't like everything.",
        "A: Uh huh. Living in Teaneck.",
        "A: No. I have my own apartment. That was one condition because ...uh...I love them dearly, but\nI wanted to have my own life. And...uh...1t's been a very good life. It's been a very satisfying\nlife in the sense that I don't know how any of these things ever happened because I've never\nreached out. Uh...I have had students from the Hebrew University who are doing their thesis.\nOne about anti-Semitism in Japan. One about anti-Semitism in...uh...in...uh...Cuba, so\nthese...these young people catch up with me. And...uh...also, survivors of the Shanghai\nexperience have caught up with me. And...uh...I...uh...and so actually I would say it's been a\nvery good, comfortable, satisfying life.",
        "A: But this is the greatest experience I've had yet, coming and...and talking into so many\nmachines. (Laughing)",
        "A: I wish I were 10, 15 years younger. Not much more. Because I find the world so interesting.\nI find what's happening now in the world very exciting. I can't be a part of 1t anymore. I can\nonly be platonic. I'm a voracious reader. I think since I'm back I've enjoyed the pleasure of\ncatching up on my love for history, and understanding so many things that I never\nunderstood before when I was in action.",
        "A: I've lived through history, yes, and I'm very grateful for it, but...uh...I still feel that I...I don't\nknow how to put it. That if I had a wish at all and I...I say this honestly, I would rather be in\nIsrael than here, although I am very, very unhappy with what is happening there. But it...1t's\nbecome a part of me. Now does it go back to my father and his love for the country? He also\nmade the compromise and came to America. I don't know. I really don't know.",
        "A: I and not only I.",
        "A: I do.",
