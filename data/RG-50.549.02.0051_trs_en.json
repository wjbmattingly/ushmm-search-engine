        "Answer: The -- Well, as you probably know, Holland was invaded in May 1940, when I\nlived with my father and my mother and my two brothers, who are eight and 10 years\nyounger than I -- than -- than I am, in a little town called Delft, in Holland. And my father\nwas all his life a musician, and had recently opened a little clothing store, to see if he\ncould get away from the -- th -- wi -- away from the music. On the 10\" of May, two days\nafter my 14\" birthday, the Germans suddenly -- I looked out the -- out the window, and\nthere was all German planes and paratroopers in the sky. And five days later, we were, of\ncourse -- the Dutch government ran away, the queen ran away to London, and we were an\noccupied country. And it didn\u2019t worry us too much, because the -- the war was going to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nbe over anyway very soon, we all knew that, and the Germans would never do in Holland\nwhat they had done in Germany, to the German Jews. But, pretty soon, of course, we\nbegan to find anti-Semitic ordinances in the -- in -- in the -- in the paper, and things\nprogressed rapidly. Two years later, 1942, after I couldn\u2019t go to school any more, and we\nwere all wearing yellow stars on our clothing, two years later, in October 23\", 1942, we\nwent into hiding. We were actually all set to go on the trains to what the Germans\neuphemistically called work relief, in Germany. We were all set, we had our backpacks\nready, but my grandfather, who happened to come over fo-for a visit from Amsterdam,\nwarned us that -- warned my parents that we -- we might not at all be going to work in\nGermany, that the Germans were lying, that there were rumors going around, and\nalthough no one knew where -- where we were yes going, he said don\u2019t ever go. It seems\nto have made a deep impression upon my parents, because at some point, they decided\nwe\u2019re not going to go on those trains, like most of the Jew -- Dutch Jews, and we were\ngoing to go into hiding, although we had no places prepared. So, as I said, on the 23 of\nOctober, 1942, we walked -- in the morning we walked out of our home, and never to\nreturn to that same house again. And that night my family spread around. My na -- They -\n- My -- My parents went one way, and my brothers went another way, I didn\u2019t know\nwhere they went. And I was left, for awhile, in that -- with our friends where we had\nwalked to, in the suburbs of Delft. I stayed there for a little while. And from there I went\nto -- first address in Utrecht, two old ladies who took me in, but very soon got scared, and\nI had to go. My mother, who 1s -- really became the -- the hero of this -- of our hiding\nstory -- of our wartime story in general, was the only one who traveled on trains, and she\nwent around finding places for all of us. She fou -- She decided that -- She suggested that\nI would bleach my hair and pretend to be a Christian boy, and work as a stable boy, s --\ngo find work on a sta -- as a stable boy on a Dutch farm. She then found a little farm\nsomewhere, little farmer who had five cows, dairy farm, and that\u2019s where I went to work.\nThat was my first farm, and it was absolute hell. I was this Jewish city kid, and I was\nsupposed to go out at five o\u2019clock in the morning, in the pouring rain, and -- and milk\ncows, and so, and I did. I -- I learned all that. I walked with bleeding feet 1-1n -- in\nwooden shoes, and -- very -- well, I don\u2019t know how long I was there. My guess is -- My\nguess is maybe -- oh, maybe -- maybe a half a year, I -- I\u2019m not quite sure. The\nchronology is sometimes a little difficult to follow, but anyway, I -- I decided to give\nmyself up to the Germans. I couldn\u2019t stand the -- the fear of being maybe discovered, and\nthe loneliness. I was all by myself. I was 16 years old, and I decided that I couldn\u2019t stay\nin there, I would give myself up. I figured, sooner or later, the Germans are going to find\nme anyway, and -- but my mother again, it\u2019s always my mother in this story, who came to\nvisit me sometimes, secretly, we would meet somewhere in the fields, talked me out of it,\nand said she would try and find another place for me. And she found, through a whole\nlong story that I can\u2019t go into now, but she found a police officer called Oskam, was his\nlast name, O-s-k-a-m, who ostensibly was a - was a Nazi Dutch police officer, came froma completely Nazi family, and -- but -- but -- in -- in reality was a member of the\nunderground, and was hiding about 30 Jewish men, women and children, in the little\nvillage not too far from Utrecht. And my mother had asked him if he would know a place\nfor me, and I talked with him, and he said, \u201cI have a place for you, but it\u2019s very\ndangerous. You will not be able to leave there, and you will not be able to see any\nmembers of your family. Do you still want to go there?\u201d And I said, well -- I figured\neverything was better -- anything was better than being isolated by myself on a farm. And\nhe -- when I said yes, I would like to go there, he took me to a -- a hut in the middle of\nthe woods, where he left me with seven Dutch Resistance men, mostly -- they were\nmostly of the -- what shall I say? The m -- More intellectual class o-of Dutch people.\nThey didn\u2019t look like what you would think of partisans, or anything, didn\u2019t wear\nmachine guns, or an-anything like that, but they had built this hut. And I stayed there\nfrom -- my guess is August 1943, until -- the exact date is 29\" of December, 1943. I was\nthe only Jew, I was the youngest, I was 16 - 17 then -- I was 17 years old then, and let\u2019s\nsee, the men would go out at night and raid police stations, and -- and ci-city halls, and --\nand break in and get identity claus -- get identity cards, and -- and official German\nstamps, and -- and weapons. And so we were sort of a center, people would stop in, a-and\ntake away weapons, and -- and -- and papers, and so on and so forth. I should go just --\nbecause it will relate to later on in this story, I should mention that one day two men were\nbrought in, one who claimed to be a Canadian, and one who claimed to be an\nEnglishman, and claimed to have been on a raid in -- in the -- in the Royal Air Force, on a\nra -- in on a raid to Germany, and were -- their bomber was shot down, and they bailed\nout, and they wound up in the -- and the Resistance got them before the Germans got\nthem, and they brought them into our hut. So here were these two men, and I was\nassigned to interview them, because I spoke English well. I don\u2019t quite know why, but I\nthink I have a hint of why. My parents had lived in the United States for three years, in\n1929 to 1932. So I interviewed these men, and found out that they were not German\nspies, but they were a bona fide RAF people. They w -- They -- They spent awhile with\nus in the hut, but eventually they were smuggled out by the Resistance, through Belgium,\nthrough France, and Spain, and I guess Portugal, and -- and smuggled back to England. I\ndon\u2019t know if they ever flew again, I will find that out in -- in August. There\u2019s a --\nThere\u2019s a story connected with that. On the tr -- In December, towards the end of the --\n1943, we got a message, somehow another, an intercepted message that the Germans had\nbecome suspicious of the -- of the area, the woods where we were. We were -- We were\nin the -- in the middle of a small parcel of woods. In Holland, you don\u2019t really have\nforests. These were planted parcels of woods, rectangles, one after another, about four or\nfive, and they had the very dense undergrowth of evergreens. You couldn\u2019t walk through\nthem, you would have to smash your way through -- through the undergrowth, however,\nwe had a secret path to the hut. As I said, in December, the men in the hut got the\nmessage that the Germans had become suspicious, and we were -- they then decided we\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nshould set out guards, and so a companion and I drew the lot for the 29\" of December, I\nthink four to eight A.M. watch, standing right inside the periphery of the -- in the woods.\nNow, on the -- on the -- on the woods, in -- within the first line of trees, and that\u2019s where\nwe saw the Germans coming, in the half dark, and it was, of course, traumatic, because I\nrealized they had come to kill me. I was very tempted to run away, I didn\u2019t. The both of\nus ran back into the hut, warned the men. There was a total confusion there, cause they\nwere sleeping in the bunkbeds, and we pulled the blankets off them, and shouted, \u201cIt\u2019s a\nraid, get up.\u201d And when -- when we saw that they were all out of the bunkbeds, we ran,\nand we ran to the edge of our parcel of wood -- of woods, and as I always say when I --\nwhen -- when -- when I looked to the left and to the right, it seemed to me the Germans\nwere coming around the corners of the woods, and I feared that nobody that we had left\nbehind, would survive. We then jumped across the dirt road, into the next parcel of\nwoods, and crashed through, and we ran and ran and ran and ran, until we wound up in a\ncity called Hilversum, which you probably have heard about, it\u2019s the center of Dutch\nradio -- radio transmitter. And I can\u2019t go into the details now, but somehow another, we\nwound up at night in the woods again, about five miles away from where the hut was,\nbecause that was the spot where we were supposed to reassemble in case of a raid. It had\nbeen previously agreed upon. And my buddy and I, my -- my partner and I waited there\nin the dark. We had guns, we had nine millimeter Mauser, and we had them at the ready,\nbecause we didn\u2019t know if the men would have been tortured to reveal the place that the\nGermans would -- might come and -- and ser -- I had pretty well decided then that -- that\nif they would come, that I would defend myself, I would -- I would try to kill, and be\nkilled, probably, in a short gunfight. So, I was all prepared to die. It was very quiet, and\nthen after awhile I did hear some noise coming through the woods, sounded like old\nmetal rattling away, and thumping over -- wh-wheels on the dirt, and this bicycle rattled\nin the little clearing, and with a little flashlight somebody was shining ahead of it. And\nwe didn\u2019t know who it was, we were ready to -- to -- to shoot. But nothing followed, and\nthen we approached with drawn guns, and found out that it was not the Germans, and it\nwas neither one of the men, it was my mother, who had heard about the raid, and had\ndecided immediately to rescue us. Well, I think most of that escape, and so on, and my\nmother\u2019s part in that is probably in the -- in the video interview. We escaped. My buddy -\n- My mother gave the old bicycle to my -- my friend, my -- my partner, and she gave him\nalso the little flashlight, and he peddled away into the darkness, he said he knew a place\nwhere to hide. And my mother and I pretended to be lovers, and as we approached the\nGerman guard, we talked very loud, and we giggled, and we -- you know, with -- with\nterror in our hearts, but we put our arms around each other, and we made kissing sounds,\nand the -- and the German guard whom we approached seemed to want to stop us for a\nsecond, but he didn\u2019t, and we walked by him, and as I always say, to live another day in\n[indecipherable] of that circle of death. After that I was close to a nervous breakdown, I\nneeded help. Two -- Two older people, two Dutch people who lived in a very nicemansion, put me up in a room, very peaceful room overlooking a gorgeous garden, and\nthere I s -- recuperated slowly, I stopped shaking, and I became very religious, I found a\nBible, and for the first time read something about the Jewish history, and became devoted\nto it, and for the rest of the war, tried to be a religious Jew. When I felt strong enough\nagain, I left that place, and I got myself a new pair of wooden shoes, and I went out and\nfound a new farm, now in a better part of Holland. And in the more eastern part, where\nthe farms are bigger, and the people are [indecipherable] and I started to work this time as\na real farmhand. By then I seemed to have had enough experience to work with horses,\nand plow, and -- and of course I had bleached my hair again, and matter of fact, I had the\nchutzpah to go and register myself with my false identity card in -- in the town hall, to\nallay suspicion. It worked pretty well, I -- I wasn\u2019t -- I worked on a couple of farms. The\nfarmers were happy with me. Of course, every second was always a challenge if anyone\napproached the farm. It was like, this is maybe it. In May, 1944, my mother, coming back\non the train from visiting my brother Fred, my youngest brother who was sick, was -- she\nhad managed to put in a hospital in the south of Holland. On the way back, she ran into a\nexpert on the train, German -- a Gestapo expert on the train, zeesha hites a deest expert,\nprobably, and he immediately recognized that she had a falsified identity card, and he\narrested her. And she -- And he put her into a -- into a separate compartment in the train,\nwhere she was guarded by a Dutch policeman on the way to Amsterdam, and that she\nlater tells him -- I\u2019m not quite sure any more at this point, by the way, let me interrupt\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nmyself here for a second. I\u2019m not quite sure how much of this is in the videotape. I\u2019m not\nquite sure. I\u2019m quoting here things that my mother and my father said in interviews\nconducted -- audio interviews conducted by my brother Fred. My brother Fred conducted\naudio interviews with the whole family, my father, my mother, myself, my brother Ott,\nmy cousins, my wife. I have a tray with audio interviews, with the voices of my parents\nand everyone, and he later also transcribed it in book form, together with his son. Now,\nall that, I think happened after the Holocaust Memorial Museum interview. So, I don\u2019t\nknow, you can ask me later on it -- if it\u2019s not clear, I can go back to it. As my mother said\n-- now I go back to what my mother as -- she was arrested, as my mother later on told in\ninterview with my brother Fred, she ate all the paperwork that was in her -- in her\nhandbag, so the -- so that there was -- sh -- and she swallowed it. So by the time that she\ngot to the interrogation in Amsterdam, when they ask her what her real name was, she\nlied, and she said that her name was Angeline Elizabeth Van Leer, which was her maiden\nname. She never mentioned her -- her married name. And since she didn\u2019t have any other\npapers, except her false identity card, they wrote it down, and as she said, a-as a -- out of\nthe blue sky she added, \u201cAnd you have no right to keep me here, because I\u2019m an\nAmerican citizen.\u201d I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s in the -- in the video interview, either. In any\ncase, she was sent to -- to Westerbork, Dutch camp, and from there she was sent to\nBergen-Belsen, which we didn\u2019t know, of course. When I somehow heard that my mother\nhad been arrested, I found my father and my two little brothers in a little cottage together,in the -- not too far from Arnhem, in Holland, where -- that little cottage my mother had\nrented just before she was arrested, in order to be a -- a -- just a week together with her\nhusband and her two little sons. And of course, for her this didn\u2019t work out, but my father\nhad gone there, and my two little brothers were there, and I found them there, and I\ndecided that rather than work on the farm, my father would need help to survive in hiding\nwith my two little brothers. So I quit the farm, and bicycled over to this little cottage, and\nthat\u2019s where we spent the last winter of the war. Together with my two brothers and my\nfather, we begged, borrowed and stole whatever we could to survive, and thus we reached\nthe spring of 1945, when we were liberated by the Canadian army, and where -- I really\nshould say this part of your interview ends, because it was the end of the war. Many\nsurprising things happened after that. If you want me to just go on with this now, or do\nyou want to take a break\u2019?",
        "Q: Well I -- Iam curious through the war -- you talked -- you had your family scattered\nin many different places, and your mom would -- would travel [indecipherable] and I\u2019m\nsure it\u2019s -- what [indecipherable] look like. How much do you know what the other\nmembers of your family were doing, where they were, did you [indecipherable] see them\nfrom time to time.",
        "A: It\u2019s very interesting question, and -- and as I go out speaking a lot to schools and so\non, that question always comes up, people ask, \u201cHow did you know where your father\nwas?\u201d An-And I usually don\u2019t have an answer for this. I can tell you this, I did not know\nin the very beginning where my father and mother were, until the raid on the hut, when I\nspent one night after the raid, after my mother and I escaped out of that -- out of the\nwoods there, I spent one night at their hi -- their hiding place, which was in Soest, in\nHolland. So then I knew where they were. My brothers, I never knew. But there was a\nlittle time, which I don\u2019t remember too clearly, when my brother Ott, my middle brother,\ns -- came to the farm where I worked, and this was my little brother who came from the\ncity, and who needed to be fattened up a little bit, and -- of course, he was also in hiding,\nbut -- and he spent some time with me on this farm, I don\u2019t know how long. From --\nFrom his interview later on, I -- I deducted he was there at least three weeks, or maybe\neven a month. I thought it was only a week. So, that period, I knew where my brother Ott\nwas, he was with me. But then he disappeared again, and of course, from the fall of 1944,\nuntil the liberation 1945, my father, my two brothers and I were all together. Some of the\ncommunication was achieved through my grandfather\u2019s second wife. My grandfather\nlived in Amsterdam, my grandmother had died years before, he marred a non-Jewish\nwoman, and had a daughter by her. And I| think that daughter, who was not Jewish, at\nleast she was half Jewish, did not wear a star, and traveled, and I think she managed to\nsend some messages around, and I think it must have been through her that I found where\nmy father and my two little brothers were hiding in that little summer cottage. That\u2019s as\nbest as I can tell you. Course we had no phones, we didn\u2019t write letters, was -- we\ncouldn\u2019t. And -- So sometimes it -- I just -- it\u2019s all conjecture, you know?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: How much were you aware of what was going on in the country, or with the war, or --\nor in terms of what and where, with interest to Jews? How would -- How would you get\nyour information?",
        "A: The minute that we went underground, of course, we were isolated from the rest of the\npopulation of the world, you could say. But here and there, you would pick up an illegal\npiece of newspaper. You know, there were -- there were illegal newspapers that consisted\nusually out of two or four pages, badly printed, and sometimes you would find -- find\none of those, or somebody would ha-hand you one of those. During my time in the\nResistance hut, of course I found out more, because the men listened to the BBC, and we\nhad a map there, and we charted the progress of the Russians and whatever else was\nhappening. And we knew about the -- the bombardments in Germany and so on. So, at\nthat time, I was pretty well aware of where the -- where the Germans stood, and where\nthe Russians were, and where the English were, and the Americans, and so on, and so\nforth. But after the raid, when I went back to the farm, I was totally isolated. The farmers\nhad -- they would talk about the war, but they -- they didn\u2019t know what was going on.\nWhat we could see were, of course, a thousand B17 bombers flying over almost every\nday, and by night we heard the English, a thousand planes going overnight. We knew\nthere was enormous bombardments. And I had several interesting -- interesting\nhappenings at one time. A liberator bomber came down right around the corner from the\nfarm where I worked, and that was the time my brother Ott was there, it seems, because\nhe, in detail, describes how that plane came down, and how we ran there, and -- and how\nwe found a little piece of -- of Plexiglas, little piece of -- from one of the -- one of the\nwindows of the bomber, or the -- we -- we savored it like a piece of -- this was a piece of\nfreedom. That was one. On another farm -- this must have been already in the summer of\n\"44, a Messerschmitt 109 was shot down, and crashed right into the ground, right near by\nthe farm where I worked, there\u2019s -- there was another farm. And I don\u2019t where I had the\nchutzpah, that I -- I was devoted to flying and -- and planes before the war, already. I\nloved planes, and build model planes. Anything that would -- flew was to me, was\nfascinating. And here was a Messerschmitt 109 lying pretty much undamaged except for\nit\u2019s gear and so on. I-It\u2019s propeller bent, and -- and there was a German on guard there,\njust a soldier guarding the -- the plane there. And I approached on bike, and I asked him\nif I could take a look, and he said, yeah, that\u2019s all right, and I actually walked around the\nGod damn plane, and touched it, and [indecipherable] all fascinating. How did I get onto\nthat? Oh, you asked me about what I knew about the war. During our ha -- last hiding,\nwith my two brothers and my father, in the little summer cottage, we found out nearby,\nabout a five minute walk through the fields, there was a big mansion type house, and in\nthat house lived a whole collection of people, young and old. Later on, we found that\nseveral of them were in hiding themselves. But, they listened every day to the BBC radio.\nSo, some might say the fall of 1944, until the liberation, we knew pretty well what was\ngoing on because of the evening -- in the evening we would go there, and we wouldn\u2019t\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nlisten ourselves, but somebody would go up and listen in the attic, where they had a radio\nhidden, and they would tell us, \u201cThe Russians are right near Berlin,\u201d you know, \u201cand the\n-- the invasion is going well.\u201d By this time, of course, the sixth of June, 1944, the allied\ninvasion of France, we knew it was happening. And then, of course, we had gone to\nArnhem, which was not too far away, the disastrous attempt from the English to -- with\nparatroopers to capture the bridges, and being wiped out, and we thought we would be\nfree then. So anyway, that much we knew. Arnhem, we didn\u2019t know the disaster,\nalthough it was only a half an hour away from us, we heard all --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Ed Lessing. This is tape one, side B. We were just discussing again, your ex-\nexperiences during the war, and you were mentioning the -- the various places that you\nwere in hiding, and one question I wanted to ask is, how many of the places where you\nhid, how many knew that you were Jewish?",
        "A: The very first place, two old ladies, knew I was Jewish. The next one on the farm, the\nfirst farm, dairy farm, they did not know. In the Resistance hut, of course they knew I\nwas a Jew, and weren\u2019t too happy about it, by the way. After the Resistance hut, when I\nstarted going back to farming, on several farms, I registered as a -- as a -- as an Christian.\nAnd then we come to -- there are little pieces in between that I don\u2019t even want to go --\nwhere I was a week , or I was a week and a half, or two weeks. I was with my aunt in The\nHague for -- for two weeks or something, and of course she knew was -- I was Jewish,\nbut -- and then we come to the fall of 1944, when I joined my father and my two brothers,\nand there\u2019s no question, of course, there. So, the only places where people didn\u2019t know\nthat I -- that I was Jewish, was on the farms where I worked.",
        "Q: And again, you mentioned how your mother sort of set everything -- everything up,\ndid a lot of the arrangements.",
        "A: Especially in the beginning. Not for me later on, I found -- after the raid on the hut, I\nfound my own farms. I was -- I would say I worked there, and w -- I\u2019m not quite sure\nwhy I left to go from one farm to another. I probably thought that it was safer to not stay\ntoo long in one place. It\u2019s very hard to explain the intensity of -- of the deceit you had to\npractice. Your -- Your whole mind was set on deceit. What -- What hint could a farmer,\nlet\u2019s say, get from me that I was not who I said I was, you know. Wa -- My -- My mind\nwas constantly at work, so that I probably decided that it was not a good idea to stay too\nlong in one place, because eventually something escapes.",
        "Q: What sort of things do you remember, were you worried that would give you away?\nSomething you would say, or the way you act?",
        "A: I\u2019m not quite sure at this point. See, this was a 24 hour a day, seven days a week\ncomedy you played. This is like being on stage, practically 24 hours a day, every day,\neven when y -- when you went to sleep, you had to watch out that somebody wouldn\u2019t\nhear you dreaming, or something, and say something. I had a false name. I might, by\nmistake, whisper my own name in my sleep or something, or s -- tell about my mother. I\ndidn\u2019t have a mother, you know, and the mother and father had died years ago in\nbombardments, both of them. I mean, the stories that you made up, to -- in order t -- tho -\n- it was a whole -- 1 -- this was a whole false lifetime of history. Where did you come\nfrom, did you have family? Where did you live? How come you\u2019re working on a farm?\nYou\u2019re from the city. How come you work so well? You know. Why -- We\u2019ve had city\nboys here, they -- they never worked that well, they didn\u2019t know how to go plow a field\nwith a horse. How come you know? You know, this kind of stuff, and what is he\nthinking? Is he talking with his neighbors about this guy we have from the city, who\nworks so well?",
        "Q: And was that a time where farmers may have been suspicious, that -- since that sort of\nthing was happening, and --",
        "A: That I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. You see, in Holland, a Jew would stand out like a --\nhow do I say that? A mouse on a billiard table. I could instantly recognize if I saw\nanother Jew someplace in Holland. And I\u2019ve seen some on the -- on the railroad station,\nonce, when I was waiting for my mother to show up, and -- and I saw a man, and I\nimmediately recognized this guy is -- is a hidden Jew, you know. So, I thought, why\ndon\u2019t the other recognize me, maybe, you know?

It was like -- And you had to make sure that you didn\u2019t slip up anywhere, not a\nstreet address, not where you were 10 years ago, not where your father and mother had\ndied. You know, you know, this kind -- not show any dislike of big chunks of -- of bacon,\nor ham being put on your -- you know, not the nice bacon that we get, with slices like a\nhalf inch thick, you know, it\u2019s with all the fat on it, and farmers gleefully ate. And I ate\nthem, and I said in my head, I said -- asked God for forgiveness that I had to do this. But\nall that was a -- it\u2019s like being onstage, and it\u2019s very, very tiresome, you know? So\nanyway, it\u2019s hard to -- very hard to explain what -- what it took to stay out of the clutches\nof the Germans. And I -- There was a second time when I almost -- almost got caught.\nThe first time was, of course, the raid on the hut, second one was later on when my --\nwhen we all lived in that little cottage, and I -- we went every day to get some food in the\nvillage. There was a central kitchen then, food being scarce, and all that. And all of a\nsudden I ran into a German on this dirt road leading to the village. I was on this crummy\nbicycle that we had, and -- and this German stopped me, and wanted to see my identity\ncard. I was lucky, he was -- I th -- I have no idea w-what he was. You see, this is another\npart, to immediately gauge, if you saw a German, what kind of a German is this? Is this\njust a -- a -- Wehrmacht soldier? He doesn\u2019t know shit from shinola, you know, he\ndoesn\u2019t know about Jews, or identity cards. But, I once ran into an SS man, and that\u2019s a\nseparate story. But -- But this guy questioned me, and I couldn\u2019t figure out -- he was not\nSS, he didn\u2019t have the SS on his -- on his collar, and yet, he seemed to intensely question\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nme, you know? And I just said that I lived -- that I was a farmer\u2019s [indecipherable] farmer\nhere down the road. I was on -- on a -- and could see him swaying back and forth. But\nwhat the hell he would have done, I have no idea, because this was -- we\u2019re talking now,\nprobably late fall 1944, when -- when everything was already in disarray for the\nGermans. Any case, that was a moment when everything sort of tightened up, and you\nstood there, and you said, is it going to go right, or is it going to go wrong? Is this the last\n-- is this it? You know? And it wasn\u2019t, but it was almost. Okay, I don\u2019t know if I\nanswered your question, but --",
        "Q: Well, another question I had, from the video interviews, is that -- I -- I\u2019m interested in\n-- in your father, it seems like, to a certain extent, he tried to maintain a normal life,\nduring -- throughout the hiding is -- you mentioned that he had painting lessons once a\nweek, for example.",
        "A: Yes, he did.",
        "Q: He -- He sounds like -- like an interesting character.",
        "A: My father was an interesting man, he -- he was a kind of an ineffective man, 1 -- that --\nand my mother always held him up as the artist in the family, and she was the one who\ntook care of everything. Even -- I mean, after the war, before the war, she was the driving\nfactor, sort of, in -- in -- you know, getting everything done. But here they were, these\ntwo people, in a room, for two and a half years. You ever sat in a room for two and a half\nyears without going out? It\u2019s not easy. And he began to do sketches, put little still lifes on\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthe table, or -- and then he started painting with watercolors a little bit, and pastels, and\nmy mother got him art materials, and it was a God given thing, you know, cause he\nwould have gone crazy there. And then, through somehow another, they found this\npainter -- I have a painting of him [indecipherable] upstairs. I have several painting of my\nfather, and also of his teacher. Found this teacher where he went once a week. I didn\u2019t\nwant to go into the details about it, but I told you about the raid on the hut, and that my\nmother came to rescue us in the woods. The reason why she knew was, when my buddy\nand I ran off from the raid, we wound up in the city of Hilversum, I remember that my\nfather took painting lessons from a man named Shlutter, a painter, well-known painter in\n-- in -- in Holland. And that this man lived in a village near Hilversum, where we were,\nand I decided that -- we didn\u2019t know where the hell to go, that I would to this Shlutter,\nbecause obviously he was all right, he was somebody we could trust, because he gave my\nfather painting lessons. It so happened when we -- we took a little train there, a little -- a\nlittle sht -- a little -- little -- a -- a s-- a tram, and it so happened when we got there, my\nfather was there, painting, you know, very quiet in the studio of this man. And my father\nsaid, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d And my father never was very perceptive in things, and\nI told him, \u201cPop, we were raided,\u201d you know? \u201cAnd I think all the men probably are --\nare going to be dead.\u201d And he said, \u201cGee, gee, hm.\u201d But he didn\u2019t interrupt his lesson or\nanything. And he said, \u201cSo where you going to be today?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, we don\u2019t know,\nwe're,\u201d -- and I don\u2019t know where we were all day, until we wound up in the woods that\nnight. But one thing is for sure, my father eventually went back to his hiding place, and\ntold my mother, and my mother immediately grasped the seriousness of the situation. My\nfather didn\u2019t. And she -- how she found out, I don\u2019t know, I think probably to Mr.\nOskam, the policeman, where the hell we would meet that night. So my father painted,\nand my mother -- and my mother took care of the -- tried to save the rest of her family,\nand did, and saved herself, too, of which I will tell you. But his -- his glor-glory period\ncame when we were all hiding in that little cottage, from the fall of 1944, until the\nliberation, 1945. He became a real strong father, you could almost say a brother to me.\nHe and I took care of the boys, and ourselves. But he and I decided what -- how to find\nfood, where to steal trees, you know. Where to beg for sandwiches from the farmers, or\nsomething, anything. It was like a team. When my father died, probably about 10 years\nago, or so, I really felt like one of our team had died, you know? He shouldn\u2019t have died,\nwe should have all died together, my two brothers, my father, and I, we were a team, a\nwonderful team of -- that managed to survive. And my father died, of course he died, but\nit was like losing a member of a string quartet, you know, and say God, you know,\nirreplaceable. Anyway, so I have many funny stories about my father. My father mostly\nis known in the family for his funny stories, because he did so many things out of -- I\ndon\u2019t know, re -- because he didn\u2019t -- he wasn\u2019t aware. My wife always says, \u201cYour\nfather never was aware.\u201d My father wasn\u2019t aware of what the hell was going on. Hewasn\u2019t even aware that I was in -- wa -- you know, wa -- my life was threatened when I\nwas there, you know, with my buddy. So, I hope that answers that question, maybe.",
        "Q: I wonder from a certain sense that -- that led him -- that let him get through the\nexperiences in a way different from other people.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t understand that. What did you say?",
        "Q: That him being aware -- sh -- maybe shutting things out, allowed him to sort of\nmaintain some of his former life all through that -- the war.",
        "A: That\u2019s probably -- probably so, yeah. He\u2019s an interesting man, I was never very close\nto him, except for that period then. I could tell you for hours about him, but I don\u2019t think\nthis is the place to do it. He -- He tried all his life to not be a musician, and yet, he only\nwas a musician, he always went back to it. And after the war, when we moved to -- or\nwhen they moved to Springfield, Massachusetts, my father really had -- I said, well, his\nonly glory period was during the war, that isn\u2019t quite true. After they moved to\nSpringfield, Massachusetts, and my father began to play in the Springfield Symphony,\nand he played in the Hartford Symphony, he was a cellist, and he set up a string quartet\nwith friends, and they gave concerts in -- in Pittsfield, in the Fine Arts Museum, those\nwere glorious times for him, because he loved music. So -- But during the war, and of\ncourse, I don\u2019t know all of it, because they were in hiding, my father and mother together,\nand somehow another -- I think my father probably had an easier time of it than my\nmother, because he could lose himself for hours in sketching a glass of water, and -- anda little jar, you know? I have many of his sketchbooks still upstairs. So, where do we go\nfrom here?",
        "Q: Well, let\u2019s go -- let\u2019s continue after the war.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk about the war ended, and -- and what happened with you and the family\nfrom there?",
        "A: All right. I may duplicate some of it that was in the -- oh no, I ge -- I don\u2019t know\nwhere the original video -- video interview ended.",
        "Q: It ends pretty much at the end of the war.",
        "A: When we were liberated?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Nothing after that?",
        "Q: Very little.",
        "A: Very little. All right, the first thing I have to tell you about 1s -- its\u2019 a little bit difficult,\nthe structure is a little bit different. I must first tell you about what happened to my\nmother, because it -- then I can go back to -- to us. My mother, as I said, was sent to\nBergen-Belsen. And interestingly enough, she had a -- she had a dream -- my mother was\nalways a little psychic, by the way, very interesting. There were times that she would say\nto my father, \u201cI think your father is maybe coming for a visit from Amsterdam today.\u201d\nAnd I don\u2019t know, three out of five times, there was my grandfather in the afternoon, youknow, ringing the doorbell. So we always thought she was, what we call in Dutch,\nhelderzingda, clear -- clear voyant -- clairvoyant. She had a dream. I think -- I think it\nwas in Westerbork, in the Dutch camp. She had a dream in which she saw a newspaper, a\nmasthead of a newspaper, and that said, January 21, very big, and she woke up from it.\nAnd she thought, \u201cI wonder what that means, if it means something.\u201d And she thought,\n\u2018Either I will be dead by then, or I will be free.\u201d But then, how could she be free? I mean,\nshe was in a concentration camp in Holland, and soon after that, she was sent to Bergen-\nBelsen. And one day in January, a friend of hers, who she slept with in the same\nbunkbed, you know, the wooden bunkbeds they had there, said, \u201cYou know, Lene,\u201d she\nwas always called Lene, from -- from Angeline, \u201cLene,\u201d she said, \u201cthere is an SS guy\nsitting in -- in the barracks, and he\u2019s checking on people who have foreign nationality.\u201d\nAnd my mother said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have foreign nationality.\u201d And her friend said, \u201cBut\nyeah, you said when you were interrogated in Amsterdam, you told him you don\u2019t have\nany right to keep me here, because I am an American citizen?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said my mother,\n\u2018so what? You know, I don\u2019t have any papers. I\u2019m not really an American.\u201d Okay, I got\nto go back, I got to b-backtrack, got to backtrack for a second to the interrogation in May\n1944, when she was caught in Amsterdam, in front of the Gestapo there.\n[indecipherable]. They asked her what\u2019s your name, and I told you she gave her maiden\nname, Angeline Elizabeth Van Leer, and as an afterthought they said -- she said, \u201cAnd\nyou don\u2019t have any right to keep me here, because I am an American citizen.\u201d And they\nasked her, \u201cIf you\u2019re an American citizen, where did you live in the United States? Give\nus an address.\u201d And she rattled off 121 LaMartine Street, Jamaica Plains, Boston. And\nit\u2019s a wonderful thing, because it was one of the addresses where we had lived in 1929,\nwhen my parents for three years, emigrated from Holland to the United States. It was a\nlousy year to come to the States, 1929, my father got sick, he got tuberculosis, and so on,\neverything went wrong. In 1932 they returned again to Holland. But they did live at 121\nLaMartine Street, Jamaica Plains, Boston, and my mother remembered it, and rattled it\noff in front of the Gestapo, and they wrote it down. They must have laughed, but they\nwrote it down. So, now we go back to Bergen-Belsen, and it\u2019s January 1945, and things\nare really getting bad in Bergen-Belsen. I -- Sorry, I have to s-suddenly think of S-\nSpiegelman\u2019s, \u201cMaus Two,\u201d which bears the title -- when his father arrives in Bergen-\nBelsen, either from Auschwitz, or wherever he came from, some horror, comes to\nBergen-Belsen, and says, \u201cAnd here\u2019s where my troubles really began.\u201d It\u2019s -- It\u2019s tragic,\nbut it\u2019s funny. Anyway, my mother came to Bergen-Belsen, and here\u2019s where our\ntroubles really began. Sh -- Her friend said, \u201cGo to this S -- SS guy.\u201d My mother said,\n\u201cWhy, ba, ba.\u201d Says, \u201cGo, go, go anyway. So what do you have to lose?\u201d So she went to\nthis barracks, there was an SS guy sitting, and he was just closing the books, and sh -- he\nsaid, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d And she said, \u201cWell, I hear you\u2019re checking on people with\nforeign papers?\u201d And he said, \u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I just finished.\u201d And she begged him\nto open the book again, and he opened the list again, and he said, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\nAnd she said, \u201cAngeline Elizabeth Van Leer.\u201d And he went down the list and he said,\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d he said, \u201cyou get yourself ready, and two days from n-now, you will be -- you\nwill be exchanged for a German.\u201d And she didn\u2019t believe a word for it -- of it, you know?\nBut two days later, there was a train standing. There was not a railroad spur into Bergen-\nBelsen camp, as you may ha -- may know, but there was -- people had to walk for two\nmiles outside of the camp to -- to Bergen-Belsen, or Belsen-Bergen station, whatever it\nwas. And there was a train standing there with a big red cross on it, and she went in there\nwith 301 other Bergen-Belsen inmates, and as she came in -- she tells this all later on, I\u2019m\nre -- I\u2019m retelling now what she told to my brother Fred in interviews later on. She said\nthere was an SS sitting there at a little table, and she said, \u201cCould I have a little water?\nI\u2019m very thirsty.\u201d She had been walking. And he said, \u201cSit down, you\u2019re going to get\ncoffee soon.\u201d And of course, she didn\u2019t believe a word of that, either, but a little later, a\nnurse came in with a tray with real coffee, whi -- nobody had seen in years. And then she\nbegan to believe that maybe it wasn\u2019t a ruse, you know? What they used to do to\nGermans wa -- load 1,000 people in the train, promising them to go to -- you know, be\nfreed, and they, you know, two days later, they\u2019d be all gassed in Auschwitz, or Sobibor.\nSo that train really started out and went through -- was very secure, there\u2019s a route --\nroute through Germany, and my mother later on says very gleefully, they all saw the\nbombed out cities of Germany. We\u2019re talking now January 1945, of course. We\u2019re\napproaching the end of the war. And that train would up in, I forget, Saint Dollan, I thinkshe mentioned. It\u2019s in Switzerland. And they came in on one side of the -- of the\nplatform, and -- an-and another train came on the other side, and they were exchanged for\nGermans. And I got to tell you the rest of this, because otherwise what I tell you later\nmakes no sense. The first night, they spent, sh -- this is a footnote to the Swiss treatment\nof dying -- 300 s -- terribly sick and dying Bergen-Belsen inmates. They put them in an\nabandoned school building on straw, and for the few -- first meal, my mother said, \u201cThey\ngave us white bread, and cans of sardines.\u201d And she said -- she couldn\u2019t help herself, she\nsaid she opened the can of sardines and poured the oil in the sardines over the white\nbread, and just ate and ate and ate. And she said, \u201cI never was as sick in the camp as I\nwas that night.\u201d And finally she found some relief in the morning by throwing up. It was\na terrible night, she said. She\u2019d never been so sick in all those -- in all her -- all her time\nin -- in the -- in the camps, or in hiding. And it got to be morning, and the others were\nstill asleep, I think, and a little boy came by, and she had been in camp, and hadn\u2019t -- did\nnot know what was happening in the world. And she asked the boy if it was possible to\nget a newspaper somewhere, and he said he could, and he ran off, and he came back with\na newspaper, a Swiss newspaper, and she opened it. It said January 21\u2018, and she was free.\nNow magical things, you know? That\u2019s amazing. My mother was a pretty amazing\nperson. Anyway, the train went on, or another train, and they wound up in Marseilles, and\nthere she was given a choice. She could go either to her sister in Massachusetts, or she\ncould go to Palestine. And she decided she -- and the third choice was she could go to\nUnited Nations rehabilitation camp someplace. And she decided she\u2019d go to her sister in\nMassachusetts, and for there there was a -- a ship lying there, the Gripsholm,\nScandinavian ship. And that was transporting wounded American soldiers. And she was\nalready on board of the ship, and then suddenly she changed her mind, and she ran off,\nand one of the officers there said, \u201cYou can\u2019t do this, you already,\u201d -- but sh -- he could\nnever impress my mother, and she ran off the -- off the ship, and said she changed her\nmind, she wanted to go to rehabilitation camp, United Nations camp. And so they put her\non another boat, and I think they traveled for a whole week over the Mediterranean, I\ndon\u2019t know why it took so damn long, but she finally wound up in a United Nations\nrehabilitation camp called Jeandark, which was located in Philipville, in Algiers, North\nAfrica. That\u2019s where she stayed until the end of the war. Now, okay, we\u2019ll leave her\nthere, sitting there, safe. Go back to Forthausen, where we were in hiding in the little\ncottage, and we are a couple of weeks liberated, and I could tell you many stories, I don\u2019t\nknow how long you want to do this interview. I could tell you a funny -- I think I really\nshould tell you this story, cause it is so funny. The Canadians came, and we spent three\ndays in a dugout shelter, until -- under a fierce artillery bombardment, and then we came\nout, and we were free, and the Canadians settled all around us in camps, and there were\ntanks there, and God knows, and it was -- it was wonderful. But we didn\u2019t have anything\nmuch more to eat, so my father went -- and we had been making something that was\ncalled coffee, but it was made out of ground up shells of -- of -- what do you call that\nfruit that comes from a oak tree?",
        "Q: An acorn?",
        "A: Acorns, ground up acorn shells. It was horrible stuff. My father went and persuaded\nthe Canadian cook in one of the camps that this was the best stuff, and he exchanged it\nfor three cans of corned beef, or something, which we hadn\u2019t seen in years. And so --\nAnd we went into the woods, and we found in -- we found in -- a German mortar, and\nwith the ammunition, and we went and sold that to the Canadians for -- for sugar and tea,\nand -- anyway, but -- oh no, not for sugar, for tea, an-an-and -- and bread, and -- but we\ndidn\u2019t have any sugar. So my father peddled on this old little bike into town, and he saw\nthere was a detachment of military police, huge guys, as he explained to them, broad\nshoulders, and they had these enormous gloves, and they had Harley-Davidson\nmotorcycles with MP on it. These were tough bastards, you know? And my father went\nup to -- to one of them, [indecipherable] already, went up to one of them, and said, \u201cSir,\nwould you have some sugar for us? We -- We\u2019ve been -- hadn\u2019t had any sugar.\u201d Guy was\na redhead, with a red moustache, as my father ex -- described him. The guy said, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s\nthe matter with you, begging around here? Say, you a Jew?\u201d My father -- this is after two\nand a half years of not being a Jew, he said, \u201cNo, no, no, no, I\u2019m not a Jew. I,\u201d -- you\nknow -- he says, \u201cNo, I just need -- wanted some sugar.\u201d He said, \u201cGet the hell out of\nhere.\u201d And my father went -- left him. The next day he happened to be in town again, and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthey were breaking up. The whole first division Canadian army was pulling through the\nvillage. Endless, you know, miles and miles of -- of kitchens, and tanks, and carriers, and\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a interview with Ed Lessing, tape two, side A, and we were just continuing on\nyour story.",
        "A: All right, this little story when my father came back into the village, and saw the\nmilitary police unit breaking up, and he went up again, to the redhead guy, who was just\nabout getting on his huge Harley-Davidson motorcycle, and revving up the engine, and\nmy father said -- and the guy said, \u201cAre you here again?\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d said my father. \u201cI\nwondered if you left behind any sugar.\u201d The guy said, \u201cI asked you yesterday, are you a\nJew?\u201d And my father said, \u201cNo, no, I told you I\u2019m not a Jew.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cyou see,\nI\u2019m Jewish. I would have given you sugar if you were a Jew, but I don\u2019t give to any\ngoyim.\u201d And he roared off on his motorcycle. Ah, this is a lovely, lovely story. You --\nYou got to realize that my family is a story telling family, both my brothers, and my\nfather, and I, we all tell stories, and we remember them. So, our whole family is suffused\nwith stories, and this is -- this is a -- a cutie from -- from the war. Anyway -- from right\nafter the war. Okay, get -- let\u2019s get serious again. A couple of weeks after our liberation,\nmy father tells me, he said, \u201cYou know, they told me in Barnfeld,\u201d -- a little town nearby,\n\u201cthere are Some men -- some men who have lists, and they take care of -- of -- of -- of --\nof our Jewish people.\u201d That was all he knew, you know. So he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to go\nthere, find out about mutter,\u201d the Dutch word for mother, we always called her mutter. I\nsaid, \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d And he rattled off on this old bike, and th -- and -- and by that time, I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nal-always keep on talking about rattling bikes. You see, we didn\u2019t have any air tires any\nmore. Tires were made then either out of wooden strips, very cleverly, wound around\nwith steel wire around the rim, or if you were a little bit better, old car tires were stripped,\nthe rubber -- solid rubber was then wound around, and so -- but you can imagine, within\nabout a month, everything rattled loose on your bike, so they always rattled. Anyway, my\nfather set off, and he went to Barnfeld, and as he -- and now I\u2019 Il have to quote him,\nbecause he tells this later, also in the interview, he -- he -- he reaches Barnfeld, and he\ngoes there into a building, and behind a rickety table, he find three older -- older men,\nyeah, three older, Jewish men, and the -- and they said, \u201cCan we help you?\u201d And as -- he\nsaid, \u201cYes,\u201d he said, and -- and I\u2019m trying to express this as naive as we were still. My\nfather says, \u201cYes, my -- my wife was -- was arrested, and she was in -- in -- in\nWesterbork, in a camp, and then she was sent somewhere to Germany, I would like to\nfind out where she is.\u201d So they said, \u201cWell, you\u2019re in luck, because we don\u2019t know\nanything right now,\u201d he said, \u201cbut s -- one of a -- one of our men is in Germany, and he 1s\ncoming back with all the lists, and where everybody is.\u201d And we\u2019re talking about 110,000\nDutch Jews, shipped out. And my father said, \u201cOh, thank you. Ill be back in a week.\u201d\nAnd a week later -- And he tells this to me when he comes back to our little hut, we\u2019re\nstill living in that little cottage, not a hut, a cottage. And a week later, he goes again. And\nas he tells it later, he said, \u201cThere I saw the three men again,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they weren\u2019t\nthe same.\u201d He said physically they were the same, but mentally they were completely\nbeaten down. They said, \u201cMr. Lessing, we have just found out about concentration\ncamps, and there were gas chambers there. And there\u2019s a very -- hardly anybody 1s alive\nstill.\u201d In my speeches I always say this is the moment that they found out what we now\ncall the Holocaust. We didn\u2019t know. We didn\u2019t know what happened to those trains that\nleft every Tuesday out of Westerbork to that work relief in Germany. My father found out\nthen, right there and then. And they found it out, too. So, it was a terrible thing, and --\nand -- and they said that we have lists, but there\u2019s hardly anybody on them. He said,\n\u201cThey all murdered? Murdered?\u201d He couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cWell,\u201d my father said, \u201cbut,\ncould you just look, maybe my wife is on there?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, we give you very\nlittle chance, Mr. Lessing,\u201d he didn\u2019t want to [indecipherable]. And he went down the\nlist, Red Cross list, and he said, \u201cBut she\u2019s here, your wife is here. Angeline Elizabeth\nLessing Van Leer.\u201d \u201cGod,\u201d my father said. \u201cHow wonderful,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere is she?\u201d\nAnd this little old man said, \u201cShe\u2019s in Philipville.\u201d My father said, \u201c\u201cWhere\u2019s Philipville?\u201d\nThey said, \u201cPhilipville is -- 1-1-it says here, Algiers, in North Africa.\u201d And -- And another\nfunny story. My father said, \u201cNo, that\u2019s impossible, cause we never had anything to do\nwith Africa. We never were in Africa.\u201d He said, \u201cTha -- those -- that\u2019s ca-can\u2019t be,\u201d you\nknow? And as he said that, the little old man got kind of insulted, and he said, \u201cMr.\nLessing, the Red Cross never makes a mistake. She must be there. Now, you better go\nhome and tell your children.\u201d And so my father went back, and he came back, and he told\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nus, \u201cYour mother is alive.\u201d It was exactly a year, practically to the day that she was\narrested. It was May, 1945. Well, that was one surprising thing.",
        "Q: When were you reunited with -- with your mother?",
        "A: I\u2019m not quite sure, but I think 1t must have been in August. We -- A couple of weeks\nlater, we went on a -- on a Canadian army truck, and voyaged back to our hometown,\nDelft. And I must say, we were helped enormously by the members of the Resistance, the\npeople who have been in the Resistance, who were still in charge then, before the other\ncreeps from -- who had never done anything, came back from London, and started to take\nover, and they [indecipherable]. But it was still in disarray, you know, and the Resistance\npeople were in charge, and my father and his three sons came there, back to Delft, and\nthey said, \u201cAh, Mr. Lessing.\u201d They knew him, and they said, \u201c\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d And\nmy father said, \u201cOh, we need a place to live.\u201d \u201cWell, we\u2019ll give you a house, you know.\nWe got houses from Nazis, Dutch Nazis. We\u2019ve thrown them -- We\u2019ve thrown them out,\nyou know. They\u2019re in jail now,\u201d and so we got a -- we got a house, three floors, I mean,\nthey\u2019re all been a -- you know, not detached houses, they\u2019re row houses, with three\nfloors. And they said, \u201cWhat else do you need?\u201d And he said -- \u201cWell,\u201d my father said,\n\u201cTI need some furniture.\u201d And, \u201cOkay, we give you furniture.\u201d And they gave us a -- a\n[indecipherable]. They had a whole warehouse full of stuff confiscated from Dutch Nazis,\nand we got that, and we got spoons, and forks, and knives, and even some curtain\nmaterials, you know. And -- And they said, \u201cWhat else do you need?\u201d My father said,\n\u201cWell, I -- you know, I\u2019m a music teacher, I -- I had a piano.\u201d \u201cOh, we\u2019ll give you a\npiano.\u201d They gave him a piano. So, my father and I fixed up this new abode as well as we\ncould. We put the furniture, which was all disjointed pieces, you know, I mean, non-\nmatching pieces, and where we thought it would do the best good, and -- and we hung up\ncurtains on strings, and -- and that\u2019s how we started out. And my brothers went back to\nschool. God, I wished I could read to you the piece that my brother wrote about going\nback to school. He was -- See, born in 1936, must have been about nine years old when\nhe went back to school. He wrote recently in a speech to the Michigan State Assembly,\nhe -- he wrote a little piece about going back to school. He said that we were -- as if\nnothing had happened, open your book to page number 25, and he said, after two and a\nhalf years of being shit, you know, after being in hiding, after -- after denying our -- our -\n- Our -- Our -- Our -- OUr names, and our religion, and -- it was like -- I mean, the way he\nsays it, a beautiful speech. Anyway, the boys went back to school, and right around the\ncorner there was a -- there were buildings of the university, and they became a -- a -- a pr\n-- a prisoner of war camp for -- for Germans. And the engl -- There were English soldiers\nguarding them, and every day we would see them march through town, you know, they\nwent to -- God knows what they did. Oh, they -- they -- I don\u2019t know what they did, and -\n- and then one day, something magic hap -- magical happened. My brothers, who would\ngo and hang around there, to see those German prisoners there in the camp, and they\u2019re\nlooking through the gates, and one day they came, and there were no longer English\nsoldiers there, they were soldiers who had a Jewish star on their sleeve. And it said,\nJewish Brigade. They came home, and they said, \u201cThey had Jewish soldiers there.\u201d I\ndon\u2019t know, but my father and I didn\u2019t believe a word at first. What do you mean Jewish\nsol -- there are no Jewish soldiers. So we went to look, son of a bitch, there was these\neuys, just like the English standing there, you know, guarding the gate. So, the way that\nmy brother told it later on, my -- my little brothers went there, and they -- they said,\n\u201cHow do we make clear to them that we are Jewish boys?\u201d So, my brother Ott, who was\nalways kind of inventive, said, \u201cYeah, I know something. Let\u2019s go, and I\u2019ll stand next to\nhim, and I\u2019Il sing us the only Jewish song I know.\u201d And he started to hum, didn\u2019t know\nany words. And he started [sings notes] which I think it -- I\u2019m not quite sure what it is,\nbut he said -- 1t\u2019s a well known song, I think, that people sing at Passover, or you know.\nAnd the soldier looked at him, and said, \u201cCome here.\u201d He said, \u201cAre you Jewish boys?\u201d\nThey said, \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cCome in.\u201d And they brought them into the camp, and they became the\nmascots of that battalion, and every day trucks would pull up in front of the house, and\nsoldiers\u2019d say, \u201cAre the boys here? We want to take them up to a trip.\u201d And it was all\nwonderful. In August, I think, 1945, I came back from a Zionist meeting in The Hague.\nWe lived again in Delft, which is about 20 minutes by train one way. I came back from\nThe Hague, from a Zionist meeting. My cousin had said, \u201cYou better go to The Hague,\nthere\u2019s a group of kids there, they all were in hiding, and they sing songs, and they dance,\nand then there are also nice girls there.\u201d Well, I -- here I was, I was 18 or 19, never been\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nkissed, never been to bed with a girl, you know? I mean, my teenage years were gone.\nGirls, God. I wa -- In no time, I was on the train, and it was wonderful. There was all\nthese boys and girls, and then there were the soldiers of the Jewish Brigade, who brought\nfood and drink, and they took us for weekends, and I joined this Zionist group. There\u2019s\nalso a girl there called Carla Hymons, but she was three years younger, and kind of a kid.\nI didn\u2019t pay too much attention to her. Course, now I been married to her for 50 years.\nAnyway, I came back one evening from a Zionist meeting, Sunday -- Sunday morning,\ncame back. It was -- It was dusk, and I approached our new home, and there was an\nEnglish army truck standing in front of the house, which was nothing special, because the\n-- the Jewish Brigade always had trucks standing there in -- but a-as I ran by, from under\nthat -- that camouflage canvas, a woman\u2019s voice called, and said, \u201cOh sir, could you tell\nme where the Lessings live?\u201d It was my mother\u2019s voice. I\u2019ve always been warned, when\ndoing interviews for the Shoah Foundation, watch out, departures and reu -- when people\nreunite, that\u2019s when people start to cry, and it\u2019s true. It always -- It always happens that\nway, because that was my mother -- my mother\u2019s voice, and I barely had strength to -- to\nsay, \u201cMother, it\u2019s me, it\u2019s Eddie.\u201d And she came out of that truck, not at all what we\nexpected. She was all tanned. She came in an army jumpsuit. I mean, we ex-expected this\nBergen-Belsen emaciated, sick person, but of course, she had recuperated marvelously\nout there in Algiers, and as a matter of fact, typically like my mother, in no time at all, I\nunderstand, a few weeks after she arrived there, she was in charge of the office already.Anyway, there she was, and we rang the doorbell, and my father came, and -- and he was\njust, you know, he just -- he kept on saying to her, \u201cJust sit down, I just want to look at\nyou.\u201d And she walked around [indecipherable] and she had -- she had boxes full of stuff\nto eat. And we had saved one chocolate bar, that had fallen out of the sky one day when\nwe were still hiding in that little cottage during the winter of 1944 - \u201945. The English\nmade a mistaken drop of an enormous amount of weapons and radios, and also food\ncanisters. And I had managed to get one of the food canisters, and hide it until the\nGermans had taken everything. The Germans had been warned, and they came and took\neverything, but they didn\u2019t get this. Out of that, we had saved, for all those months, one\nlittle chocolate bar for my mother when she -- when she would come back, maybe. And\nhere she was with boxes full of stuff, you know, with chocolates, and cigarettes, and\nwhatever she could have got of there, out in that -- anyway, well there she was. She had\nflown back -- two bombers had flown from Algiers to Paris, and as I later h-heard -- this\nis -- I mean, this is the God damnedest ironic and horrible thing, one of the -- one of the\nbombers, w-with survivors, had flown from Algiers back to Europe, to France. Most of\nthem were Dutch. One of them -- One of the planes crashed, and everybody was killed,\nbut the other one arrived in Paris, and my mother from there hitchhiked, [indecipherable]\nand finally wound up in front of our house, and there she was. And my brother Ott, in his\nhurry to see her, he fell down the stairs, I remember. He rolled down two floors of -- of\nstairs, and it was pandemonium, but it was glorious, glorious, glorious. And my mother\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwalked around, and she said, \u201cOh, beautiful, this 1s -- 1s this ours? And my father said,\n\u201cYes, this is our h-home now.\u201d And she said, \u201cOh look at all the furniture you have, and -\n- and,\u201d -- this is the -- my father telling, you know, again, a little story, a mini story, he\nsays, and she walked around, and she said, \u201cOh, it\u2019s so beautiful, and -- and look, you\neven put curtains, and I,\u201d -- she was so impressed. She said -- But the next morning,\nwhen she got up, she said, \u201cWell, the couch 1s not right there, we got to move that, and\nthose curtains, they got to go. Th-That\u2019s -- That\u2019s a mess, and,\u201d he said -- my father starts\nshifting everything. Typically, like a woman. And then my brother said, \u201cMom, there are\nJewish soldiers around in, and they guarding prisoners of war.\u201d You know what my\nmother said? She said, \u201cI never want to see another Jew in my life.\u201d Oh, it was shocking.\nHowever, three weeks later, at a party in the Jewish Brigade, Italian camp, she was a\nperformer, she was an amateur singer. She sang Yiddish and Jewish songs for them, and\nshe just loved it, so.",
        "Q: What did that mean to her, or to you at that point that she [inaudible] see another Jew\nin her life?",
        "A: If you read what she tells about Bergen-Belsen, she said everybody stole from\neveryone else. She said you couldn\u2019t leave a -- a hanky lying around, you find the next\nday it was gone. If you -- well, at one point -- I -- I can\u2019t tell you the whole story of my\nmother, but th-there -- she tells about one night, she ca -- she wa -- she -- she managed to\nget a job in the kitchen, from I think midnight until seven in the morning, or something\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nlike that, where she was once in a while be able to steal some -- a potato or something,\nwhich would -- she would then divide with her friend, or something else, a lit -- tiny bit\nof extra food. And she said, \u201cOne morning I came back from my job, and the whole\nbarracks was empty.\u201d And she said the Germans had this crazy mania, like every two\nweeks or so, they would move everybody around into different barracks, for no God\ndamn reason that anybody could see. But then you had to move your stuff, and if you\nweren\u2019t there when you, as she wasn\u2019t -- she -- she came, and it -- it was in the middle of\nthe winter, it was very cold, she says, bitterly cold. Snow everywhere. And she said, \u201cI\ncame, and there was no one there, and all my stuff was gone.\u201d And she said, \u201cI sat at the\ndoorstep of the barracks, the empty barracks,\u201d she said, \u201cand I cried.\u201d And she said, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t want to go on, this is the end, I -- I don\u2019t want to go fight any more.\u201d And that\u2019s her\n-- with her magical thing, she said, \u201cI heard a voice saying, you must go on, don\u2019t give\nup, don\u2019t give up, you must go on, you must live,\u201d she says, \u201cand then I -- I schlepped\nmyself to the barracks where they had gone, and I pushed somebody aside so I could get\na place in a bunkbed, and -- to sleep. And I borrowed a blanket from a friend,\u201d or\nsomething. Anyway, she continued on. So -- But she said you couldn\u2019t trust anyone. They\nwould sell your -- their -- your -- their souls for -- for -- you know, they\u2019ll sell you for a --\nfor a piece of bread. So her impression of Jews was like, what do you expect, you know\u2019?\nAnyway, let me continue with the story, otherwise we\u2019ll sit here until a long, long time\nyet, because there\u2019s more to come on this. So, my mother was back, and I went back toschool. Now I was -- I was a terrible scholar, I -- I -- I had been to high school, and\nfailed, had been held back. In -- In -- In desperation my father had asked a neighbor,\n\u201c\u201cWh-What should I do with my son?\u201d And the neighbor had said, \u201cDo you know what\u2019s\na good profess -- send him to trade school, he learn profession.\u201d And then my father,\n\u201cWhat -- What kind of a trade school? What kind of a profession,\u201d and -- and this man\nsaid, \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI work with people who are instrument makers. They -- They --\nThey -- They make and repair scientific instruments.\u201d He said, \u201cIt\u2019s a good job,\u201d he said,\n\u201cand maybe your son can learn that.\u201d So, I don\u2019t know if you know the Yiddish\nexpression, ashander? It means -- It means -- It means a -- it\u2019s a terrible thing in the\nfamily. It used to be said if a -- if a girl marries a non-Jew, that\u2019s ashander, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s\nYiddish, and it means -- it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a terrible thing. So here my -- I probably was\nthe only Jewish boy who ever was in that trade school. I mean, there were no Jewish kids\nin trade schools. They became lawyers and doctors and writers, and whatever, but here I\nwas. I had gone to the trade school, and during the war, when the Germans decided\nJewish kids couldn\u2019t go any longer in school, I was out of trade school. And now the war\nwas over, and I went back to the trade school, and I finished one year of -- to get a\ndiploma in instrument making. It didn\u2019t take very long after that, I worked at one jo -- I\nworked at two jobs, and -- with instrument companies in Delft, and first as an apprentice\nin the shop, and later on -- my mother made another decision for me, come to think of it.\nMy mother said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a little vacation before,\u201d you know, and -- oh, the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nfirst job I had, I worked in a machine shop, as an apprentice tool maker, or instrument\nmaker, and I had a -- I found out I had an anti-Semitic boss, a g -- a guy who said Jews\nare no good. And I told this at home, and my mother said, \u201cYou quit, right now.\u201d And I\nquit. She says, \u201cNow you to-take a vacation,\u201d oh no, first, \u201cgo around, see if you get\nanother job.\u201d And I went to another -- there was another instrument company, very\nprestigious one, and I asked for a job there, and they said, \u201cWell, we don\u2019t have aj -- we\ndon\u2019t have a position in -- in the -- in the sh -- in the -- the shop, but w-we could take you\non as an apprentice draftsman.\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, I -- I work in the shop.\u201d My mother\nsaid, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go take a vacation for a week? Go visit friends.\u201d Which I did.\nWhen I came back, she says, \u201cYou have a job as a draftsman.\u201d I said, \u201cBut I said no.\u201d She\nsaid, \u201cI took it for -- I told them you would take it.\u201d And that was it.",
        "Q: Let me ask you, you mentioned that your brother had gone back to school, and how\nstrange it was to sort of all of a sudden be studying, you know, open your book to page\none.

What was that sort of, you know, getting back\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: From my memory -- It\u2019s going to be hard to believe what I\u2019m going to tell you. We\ndidn\u2019t talk about the war. We sort of went right into picking up where we left off. I\u2019m still\nsaying it today in my speeches to -- to -- to adult -- when I speak to adult audiences. I say,\n\u201cWe thought we would just pick up where we left off, and we did. We thought that two\nand a half years of hiding was an interruption, but now we were back.\u201d And life -- I\njoined this -- this group, my father started teaching music, my brothers went to school.\nNobody talked about the war. Nobody talked about. There was no Holocaust. The word\ndidn\u2019t exist, the beginning. I was together in this -- this group of -- of -- of we went with\nhundreds of kids who had been in hiding. We went on weekends, provided by the Jewish\nBrigade. Nobody talked about what had happened. It was as if we -- as if we were ger --\nnormal kids. When I think it back ows -- it seems incredible, it\u2019s unbelievable that w --\nbut -- but I guess we had to do it, in order to get started again. So my answer to you 1s\nthat life seemed to resume normally where -- where th -- where we had left off, two and a\nhalf years before. Course, we weren\u2019t Polish Jews, who came back and then were\nmurdered. Or, later on a Czech friend of mine here in the United States, says, \u201c\u201cWhen I\nwent back to my village, they tried to kill me, when I tried to get my parents house back.\u201d\nWe were welcomed, and well, friends said, \u201cWe\u2019re glad you\u2019re back.\u201d We got a nice\nletter from the little -- the maid, who had -- we had had that -- a maid before we left, and\nshe wrote us a nice letter, \u201cDear Mr. and Miss,\u201d -- to my parents, \u201cDear Mr. and Mrs.\nLessing.\u201d She was a simple soul. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re back, because I already thought you\nhad kicked the bucket.\u201d She say -- She wrote it, something very similar in that. Life\nresumed. For all those who didn\u2019t -- who had disappeared, there was no -- we didn\u2019t talk\nabout that.",
        "Q: Even within your family, you didn\u2019t talk about it?",
        "A: Even within our family, nobody talked about it. There was no discussion. The\ndiscussions came 50 years later. And pretty soon -- well, a -- as I said, I was in this\nZionist group, I met this girl, and she was three years younger, but then a year later, my\nfather and I, we got a -- we got a visa for the -- for the United States, which was very\nunusual, and my parents said, \u201cAre you coming to the United States?\u201d And I said, \u201cNo,\nI\u2019m a Zionist, I\u2019m going to go to Israel.\u201d Palestine, then. And they said, well -- they\ntalked me out of if, they said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come with me? You have a visa now,\ncome with us to the States. We need help to get started. Maybe you can save some money\nand help us get started.\u201d We didn\u2019t have any money. And so, I agreed. But I managed to -\n- like, a month before I agreed to leave, before we supposed to leave, I fell in love with\nthis girl. And when I left, we made an agreement that if we would keep on writing letters,\nthen it would be something, but if we didn\u2019t keep on writing letters, well then, 1t was\nnothing. And so, my father and I left for the United States. My father went to Springfield,\nMassachusetts. And I got a job, my first job, with -- we actually went both to my aunt and\nuncle, liv -- the aunt that my mother was supposed to go to. Aunt and uncle lived in\nHolyoke, Massachusetts. And from there, my father went to Springfield, and started\nteaching music, and my uncle got me a job in General Electric, in Schenectady, New\nYork, as a toolmaker, and that\u2019s where I went. And so, the first year, my first year in the\nUnited States was spent in Schenectady. And I would call that the armpit of -- of New\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nYork State, 1t was about the worst place. And I think that\u2019s where, maybe the first\nintimations of what had happened to me began to -- to be felt a little bit, because I had no\none there. I was almost in the same situation when I was -- as I was on my first farm. I\nknew nobody. I lived in a -- the room I -- if somebody had said to me, \u201cIf you -- You\nneed a room?\u201d And I said yes. Oh, the man at General Electric, at the employment office\nthere said -- personnel office, he said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go to the YMCA, they have an\nannouncement board and people post rooms for rent sometimes.\u201d So I went there, and I\nfound the McDuffys, or something like that, and -- on the street, and I rented a room from\ntwo older ladies. And they had some more rooms, there were other students, there were --\nthere were some Latin American students there.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is interview with Ed Lessing, this is tape two, side B. And you were just talking\nabout coming to the United States.",
        "A: Yeah, I rented this room from these two -- two Catholic ladies, and after a month, they\nsaid, \u201cEd, we\u2019re sorry, we -- we need the room for someone else.\u201d And I was out. And I\nthought it was a little strange. In the meantime, I had contacted -- I found out there was a\nJewish Community Center, something I never knew about, and I went there, and I spoke\nwith the director there, and I said, \u201cYou know, I had this room, and,\u201d -- he said, \u201c\u201cWho\nwas it?\u201d I said, \u201cMr. and Mrs. McDuffy, on the,\u201d -- whatever, \u201cCedar Street,\u201d or\nsomething.

My first -- My\nfirst hit with anti-Semitism in the United States. I haven\u2019t found any after that, I must say,\nyou know, but it was a revelation. I thought, \u201cOh, my God. That\u2019s still going on in this\ncountry?\u201d And I thought, \u201cI\u2019m not going to take this. I had this for two and a half years.\u201d\nAnd it began to dawn on me that I was different from -- from the regular -- what should I\nsay? American -- American Jews, that I had -- I had a past. And I met -- Well, I got\nanother room with a very old Jewish lady, who spoke mostly Yiddish, and she was very\nsweet, but I didn\u2019t have any heat in my room, so I had to always leave the door opened.\nBut she was very sweet, and was my first touch of Yiddish. I had never heard Yiddish\nbefore. And here was a lady who spoke mostly Yiddish.",
        "Q: Y-You mentioned that that was when you started to feel that you were different from\nother Jews who hadn\u2019t had that experience. In what way do you mean, like h-how did you\nstart to feel different?",
        "A: Well, it c -- it came about because I met -- through the people I met at the Jewish\nCommunity Center. I met a guy called Phil, forget his last name. He was the all American\nJewish teenager, I guess. A little bit older. Yeah, he was pre-college, he was -- yeah, he\nwas teenager, he was in -- probably in high school. And he and I made friends, somehow\nanother. And Phil, well, I realized, was a happy guy. He had a car, he did some -- he did\nsome amateur -- no, not amateur, he did some photography for the local newspaper. You\nknow, he would take -- go to a fire, or something like that. What they call it, a stringer,\nprobably, right? Anyway, Phil -- Phil seemed to have -- was terribly unlike me. H-He\nwasn\u2019t serious about life. He wasn\u2019t worry about de -- worried about death. He -- He was\n-- Life was happy. He went to school dances, and to reunions of his class, and he invited\nme for New Year\u2019s Eve, \u201cYou want to spend New Year\u2019s Eve with me and my family?\u201d I\nsays, \u201cYeah, great.\u201d In Holland, on New Year\u2019s Eve, the whole family comes together,\nand you make special pastries and so. So I came to his house that evening, about nine\no\u2019clock, and I just bumped into his father and mother, who are on their way out. They\nsaid, \u201cHi, Ed, we\u2019re,\u201d -- I said, \u201cWhere you going?\u201d \u201cOh, we\u2019re going to a party.\u201d Oh, oh,\nand so they left. Then his sister came out with her boyfriend. \u201cWell, Ed, have a nice\nevening.\u201d I said, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d \u201cOh, we\u2019re going to celebrate somewhere, New\nYear\u2019s Eve, with friends.\u201d So it was Phil and me. I realized this is different. These\npeople, they just have fun, they go out, they party. New Year\u2019s Eve was a serious\nbusiness in Holland, you remembered, you know, life and death, and -- so Phil said,\n\u201cWhat shall we do tonight?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, what do you do on New Year?\u201d He\nsays, \u201cYou want to cruise around with the car?\u201d He had this big Chevy convertible. I\ndon\u2019t know, we -- we cruised around through Schenectady until it was after 12, and then I\nwent back to my little old Yiddish lady, and -- and I realized I\u2019m different, this 1s -- then I\nmet someone else. A -- A man who seemed a little older than me, and he was from\nCzechoslovakia, and he -- I realized it years later, he was a Holocaust survivor. But I\ndidn\u2019t know what a Holocaust survivor was. He said, \u201cI have a car. You want it,\u201d --\nsomehow another, I guess he -- he said where were you, and I said I was in Holland, in\nhiding. And -- And he said, \u201cOh.\u201d He said, \u201cI was in camps.\u201d And he -- who knows what\ncamps he may have been in. Auschwitz for all I know. The name didn\u2019t -- if he had said\nAuschwitz, it wouldn\u2019t have rung a bell with me even then. And we spent a little time\ntogether, and he told me -- he was the man who said, \u201cWhen I tried to go back to my\nvillage, and get to my father and mother\u2019s home, who had been killed in camps,\u201d he said,\n\u201cthey tried to kill me, and I ran off.\u201d And he was a butcher in the A&P. I think it\u2019s the\nfirst time that I met up with a camp survivor. I\u2019ve always remembered him. So I realize\nthere was a little bit of a kinship there. Anyway --",
        "Q: And yet -- And yet, you didn\u2019t\u2019 talk about your experiences there? It was just\nsomething that was [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, we did not talk at length about what had gone behind. Survivors didn\u2019t talk about\nwhat happened then. You were busy making your life. Anyway, let me see if I -- let me\nnot forget anything. I worked for about a year at General Electric.",
        "Q: What was your family doing at this point? When did you all",
        "A: Well, my mother and -- no, my mother wasn\u2019t over yet, my mother and brothers were\nstill in -- in Holland, and my father was in Springfield, Massachusetts, beginning to set up\na teaching schedule, and I was in Schenectady. And my girlfriend was in Holland, and I\nwrote letters like crazy. Man, did I write. And after a year, I -- I quit at General Electric,\nas my plan had been. I just had joined General Electric in order to learn the American\nsystem for measuring, and the tool names, and all that, the -- you know, the -- how -- we -\n- we di -- we had the metric system in Europe, and I wasn\u2019t used to the system they had\nhere, and so -- so I took that year, and I learned, and I worked, and it was very interesting,\nI had a very good time, and working with -- with American men, and my boss was a\ngreat guy, I -- was totally unknown 1-in Holland, something like -- first day I was there,\nhe said, \u201cEd, call me George.\u201d I said, \u201cThat\u2019s my boss, I can\u2019t call -- call -- call him --\ncan\u2019t call him George.\u201d But he insisted, it -- it was like Jesus. When I left one of the -- an\nold man, Hank Kruger, old toolmaker, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve been here for 35 years. What are you\nleaving for?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I want to go back to drafting, you know, become a drafts -- I\nwas -- I was a draftsman when I left home.\u201d He said -- \u201cI on -- I only took this j -- this job\nto learn about tools, and so on.\u201d He said, \u201cYou\u2019ll never get a job like this again. You can\nstay here forever,\u201d you know, and -- and I thought, \u201cGee, d-d-don\u2019t they fire people\nhere?\u201d He said, \u201cYeah, you got to commit a murder in order to fire someone,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBeside, the union would -- union -- union wouldn\u2019t let the -- let you be fired.\u201d I was a\nmember of a union, electrical workers. But I did quit, after a year, and my mother came\nover. I went to New York, and my mother, and my brothers came. We all went to Radio\nCity Music Hall, saw Gene Kelly in \u201cThe Pirate.\u2019 Grace -- Great days, and -- and I found\na job in Ossening, little bit up the river from -- you know, Ossening, New York. Which --\nLife is very strange, I -- I had written down some names when I -- when I left Holland, of\ncompanies similar to the ones -- the one where I worked as a draftsman in Holland, a\nscientific instrument company. One of them was the Cambridge Instrument Company,\nand I called them, and I explained that I had worked for Kip and Sons in Holland. And\noh, they said, \u201cOh, w-we make the same things here. We\u2019d love to meet you, Mr.\nLessing.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhere do I go?\u201d And they said, \u201cWell, our headquarters is in\nGrand Central Station, in New York, in the office building.\u201d And I traveled to Grand\nCentral, and -- and oh, they were delighted with my resume, and -- as it was at that time.\nAnd they said, \u201cWell, we\u2019d gladly -- gladly h-have you,\u201d he said, \u201cbut all we want you to\ndo is -- is do meet our -- our chief engineer, Mr. Digby, an Englishman.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cSo, I\u2019ll take the train to Cambridge then.\u201d They said, \u201cNo, no, our -- our -- our\nfactory is located in Ossening.\u201d I said, \u201cAren\u2019t you in Cambridge?\u201d They said, \u201cNo.\u201d\nThey said, \u201cWhy would you want to be in Cambridge?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, my parents live in\nSpringfield, and I figured Cambridge near Boston, and -- and Springfield, it\u2019s an easy --\nthere\u2019s a train connection, and a -- you know, it\u2019s an hour,\u201d and -- \u201cOh, no,\u201d they said. I\nsaid, \u201cWell, what\u2019s Cambridge Instrument Company then?\u201d They said, \u201cOh yeah, well\nyears ago, we used to be a sister company of Cambridge Instrument Company in\nEngland, but what -- what had nothing to do with us any more, we\u2019re now located in\nOssening.\u201d And that\u2019s how I wound up in Ossening, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m living here in\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nWestchester still. Anyway, I got the job there, and started working, and then my girl\ncame over. And -- But before that, I should tell you another little incident with my\nmother. I lived on the houseboat, I -- When I got the job in Ossening, I lived on a\nhouseboat in the river, on a dock in the river. It was a houseboat somebody else had lent\nme. He said, \u201cWould you take care of the houseboat? You can have it for a year, with no\nrent.\u201d Okay. So I wrote all my letters from the houseboat in Ossening, and one day I got a\nletter from my mother, and said, \u201cI want to send you here this little advertisement that\nI\u2019ve cut out of the Jewish newspaper in Holland.\u201d And I plucked it out of there, and it\nsaid that Ed Lessing was engaged to Carla Hymons. And so I was engaged. My mother\nhad decided that we were engaged, so -- it always makes a wonderful hit because at our\n50\" wedding anniversary, I told this story about our engagement. People -- Americans,\nthey -- they look at you -- \u201cYou were -- your mother told you were engaged?\u201d I said\nyeah. I didn\u2019t think it was strange. My mother had seen that we wrote a lot of letters, and\nshe figures here\u2019s a nice girl, Ed, you\u2019re engaged. So we were engaged to get married,\nand so we married. She came over, and we got married in -- what 1s it, 1948, I think, in\nChicopee, Massachusetts.",
        "Q: What sort of things did you write in your letters? I mean --",
        "A: Oh, desire, love, forever. I mean, I had three little black and white photographs of her,\nand they just drove me crazy. I could look -- look at them for hours. I -- I just crazy with\nlove for this girl. Oh, it was endless letters about -- I told her about what I was doing, andwhat -- you know, but each let -- I wrote at least -- at least four letters a week, and each\none had a least eight, if not 12 pages. When the -- When it was all over, when they come\n-- | had a -- we filled a suitcase with -- and she would write back once in awhile also, but\nnot that much. She would also write I love you. I wrote -- anyway --",
        "Q: Was it important that you both had similar experiences during the war, that she was in\nhiding as well, or did that -- was that not even part of the conversation?",
        "A: Of course, because that\u2019s how we met. We met in -- We met in the Zionist\norganizations. Both of us didn\u2019t want to live in Holland, both of us wanted to go to\nPalestine. I mean, all the girls, all the boys, nobody want to stay in Holland, although\nsome did, but we all wanted to get -- get the hell out, and go to the -- many went to the\nUnited States, others went to -- to Palestine. Carla\u2019s brother went -- helped by the Jewish\nBrigade to get to Palestine illegally. It was the end. We didn\u2019t realize why it was the end,\nI think even. It\u2019s just strange, when I think back of it. We wanted to get out. None of us\nknew the numbers, by the way. None of us knew at that time that 75 percent of the Dutch\nJewish population had been -- had been murdered. A lot of people went on those trains,\nand they -- yeah, well, you heard, I have an uncle, or somebody had -- that his father\nwas killed, or -- but it didn\u2019t form a picture. Again, the Holocaust did not exist yet. The --\nThe scope of this -- of this horror, was this -- was unknown to us. It had been bad, and a\nlot of people got killed, 1t seemed, but what can I tell you? That\u2019s how I remember it,\nanyway.",
        "Q: So what changed? When did people start to see it as this [indecipherable |",
        "A: Well, I got to jump way ahead, but let me see. I better stay a little bit chronologically,\notherwise it doesn\u2019t make any s -- we got married, and in 1950 we decided now was the\ntime to go to -- to Israel. 1948, the state had been declared, in 1950 we left. We left on the\nLaGuardia, a ship of the American export line, and we had a marvelous trip across. We\nstopped in various places, Gibraltar, and Paraeus, and -- and we wound up in Haifa, and\nCarla\u2019s brother was there, and we went to where Carla\u2019s brother and sister-in-law lived in\na kibbutz called Dovrat, in Israel. And there we lived for five years, as kibbutniks --\nkibbutzniks. Idealists. You didn\u2019t make, you know, no money, and I started working at\nfirst as a blacksmith there, because I had some experience with metal working, of course,\na-and later on I became a tractor driver, I had my own little tractor, and I spend most of\nmy time spraying poisons on apples, and pears, and grapes, and -- and Carla worked in\nthe children\u2019s houses, with -- with the babies, and with little children, and -- and our\ndaughter was born in 1952, I guess, and we named her Noa, N-o-a, for figure out of the --\nout of the Bible. And I wasn\u2019t very happy in the kibbutz. I had already tasted individual\nlife, and it was very hard to adjust. I had been an independent guy. When I come to think\nof my whole life, I\u2019ve been -- always been more or less a -- a lo -- a -- a-- a-- a guy who\ndid better as a -- as as -- as a loner. Not -- Not necessarily completely detached from life,\nbut -- but as one who took care of himself. I took care of myself during the war, most of\nthe time. I was not with anyone else, I was by myself, except for la -- at the end. Beforethat, I had two brothers, but they were eight and 10 years younger. They were always\ntogether, like twins, and I was by myself out there, you know, 10 years older. So, I had\nworked in the States, I had worked in Holland, in my own profession, and here I was a\ntractor driver. So I wasn\u2019t too happy there. My daughter got sick, she got tuberculosis,\nwhich runs in the family, and almost died in the hospital. And strangely enough, we had\nnot made any decision to go back to the United States, but it -- it happened through a\nbunch of strange coincidences. I had no family in Israel, none whatsoever, all my family\nwas in the United States, and it was quite a -- quite a group by then. My two brothers, my\nfather and mother, my cousins had come over, with wives, with their children. It grew\nhere in the States, all around Springfield, and so on. And I was -- I was sitting out in -- 1-\nin Israel, and everybody was poor, they didn\u2019t have money to travel to Israel to -- in those\ndays everything was different, you know, you didn\u2019t say, \u201cOh well, we go, you know,\nspend a couple of weeks in Israel,\u201d you know, wh-what the hell, a couple of thousand\nbucks, so what? 20 dollars was a lot of money. So, I had actually no prospect of seeing\nmy family again. Carla had her brother, and an uncle, and she had some family in Israel, I\ndidn\u2019t. And my mother wants us -- when we -- when we left the United States to go to\nIsrael, Carla and I, we had asked for a re-entry permit, which you needed in those days.\nYou needed a re-entry permit if you wanted to come back into the States, as a non-\ncitizens. We weren\u2019t citizens, you know? I had sent the money to Washington, but the re-\nentry permit never came. Oh, we said, so what. It was just -- It was like a -- a -- a safety\nline in -- in case we wouldn\u2019t like it in -- in Israel, then we could always come back. But,\nyou know, we liked it well enough, and five years went by, and then my mother wrote.\nShe said, \u201cDid you ever get that re-entry permit?\u201d And I wrote back, \u201cNo, we didn\u2019t. We\nsent the money, but we didn\u2019t get it.\u201d She -- Well, my mother being well, my mother,\nimmediately spoke with her senator. \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s going on here? My son sent money\nto Washington for re-entry permit.\u201d \u201cI\u20191] look into it.\u201d Two weeks later a letter came from\nthe embassy in Tel Aviv, that, \u201cYou are hereby requested to reapply for a visa to the\nUnited States,\u201d and I hadn\u2019t planned to apply for a visa -- send photographs. And we\nthought, well, my daughter hadn\u2019t been s -- been so sick, and almost died, and maybe we\nshould go back for some time, and -- well, from there it rolled on and on and on and on.\nThey needed photographs, you needed documents, you need to go to the local police to\ntell you that you were a good character. And one day a letter arrived in the kibbutz, and\nsomebody in -- the letters in the kibbutz all come to the office, and then they get\ndistributed. And somebody in the office said, \u201cHey, I\u2019m going to open this letter.\u201d He\nopened our letters from the embassy, and said, \u201cHey, these people are applying to go\nback to the United States.\u201d Now, it\u2019s hard to imagine at this point in the history of Israel,\nbut then, if you left the kibbutz, just leave it and go to the city, you were an outcast\nalready, sort of. They would give you a table, and two chairs and a bed, and 20 bucks,\nand goodbye Charlie, that was nice of you to be in the kibbutz. We don\u2019t want to have\nfurther anything to do with you. To go back to the country where you came from, you\nwere yuradeem. There are two words in Israel, one it alleyah, which means going up,\nwhen you go to Israel, you make alleyah, you go to Israel, you go up. The word El Al\ncomes from there, by the way, the airline. When you leave Israel, you yurate, you go\ndown. We were yuradeem, people who go down. It was, again the word ashander, an-and\nit was a terrible thing. And in the general meeting, in the kibbutz, the members decided\nthat we had no right to live there any more, even though we had worked for five years,\nour butts off, and all that, but -- and we had been bona fide members, they voted us out.\nBut they didn\u2019t want to throw us out right away, first -- they would throw us out as soon\nas I found a job, some -- outside of the kibbutz. So I went, and I applied for a job, and I\ngot a job as a draftsman, in an English company, the refineries, the oil refineries in Haifa.\nAnd I don\u2019t know any more what happened, but we didn\u2019t -- we decided that we wouldn\u2019t\nstay in Israel after all. However, we couldn\u2019t go to the United States either, because of\nmy daughter\u2019s tuberculosis that she had had. They took x-rays, and they said, \u201cYou'll\nhave to wait a year.\u201d In those days tuberculosis was like AIDS today. You had it, you\ndidn\u2019t get into the States, and that was the worst. So, they said, \u201cYou'll have to wait a\nyear.\u201d And I don\u2019t know, we decided, you know what, if we have to wait a year, let\u2019s go\nto Holland, and we\u2019ll wait a year there, and then we\u2019ll apply to the American embassy\nthere. And so we got on a ship, and left Israel with our daughter, and went back to\nHolland, and we lived there for one year in 1956. I went back to the same place where I\nhad worked before as a draftsman, found out about a new profession that I had neverheard about, and immediately decided that was the profession that I wanted to learn. It\nwas called industrial design. I\u2019d never heard of it. It was ideal for me. It was a\ncombination of art, and technology. Industrial designers are the people who design cars\non the outside, and telephones and refrigerators, and -- in other words, people who give\nshape to modern industrial products. Anyway, we spent a year in Holland, had a\nwonderful time. One of the best years of our lives, I don\u2019t know why, but it was just\nwonderful. My daughter, in quick succession, dropped her Hebrew, which she spoke\nfluently, and learned Dutch, and at the end of the year, when we went to the United\nStates, she dropped her Dutch, and in three weeks spoke fluent English. So, went through\nthree languages in no time at all. And so we got back to the United States.",
        "Q: But let\u2019s just go back to Israel for a moment. Again, being identified as people who\nhad survived the war, an-and what was t -- as you say, to later become the Holocaust, was\nthere -- were people 1-identified in different ways, [indecipherable] didn\u2019t feel like they\nwere different [indecipherable]. Were there conversations about that?",
        "A: It\u2019s g -- It\u2019s a good question you ask, because it brings me back to our five years in\nkibbutz. It\u2019s astounding. In the kibbutz, there was a group of youngsters who had come\nfrom Romania, they were all orphans, their parents had all been killed. They worked a\nhalf a day in the morning, and in the afternoon they learned, they had school lessons. I\nactually set up a little drafting course for some of them, for some of the boys that wanted\nto learn drafting. Do you know that it never occurred to me that they were Holocaust\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nsurvivors? That they had gone through hell? That these kids were -- I mean, that they\ncouldn\u2019t even imagine what these children had gone through. They were just kids to us,\nyeah, and they were not such good kids either, because sometimes they would steal\nthings. Sometimes, you -- you know, you were supposed to work with them. I had s -- a\nkid who were helping me on the tractor, and he wouldn\u2019t work very well, and I thought,\n\u201cOh, he\u2019s a rotten kid.\u201d When I think back of it now, I cannot even imagine that I didn\u2019t\nrealize, that I didn\u2019t have the compassion. There were two ladies in the kibbutz, who were\nHolocaust survivors from camps. One, Margit, big woman, would scream at night in her\ndreams. And aft -- you know, when we heard it the first time, we\u2019d say, \u201cWho was this\nscreaming last night, this awful screaming?\u201d \u201cOh that\u2019s -- that\u2019s Margit, she\u2019s dreaming\nabout the camps, oh yeah.\u201d That was it. And I think about that now, I can\u2019t even imagine\nthat either, that it didn\u2019t ring a bell, it didn\u2019t do anything, it -- oh well, that was the\nHolocaust survi -- we had a father on a -- a father of one of the members of the kibbutz,\nan old man, he had been in the camps. Every meal, he would take from the communal\ndining room, he would take pieces of bread, and put them in his pocket, take them to his\nroom and hide them. It was a big joke. Abba Bower. Abba Bower, who would take bread.\nYou look back and you don\u2019t understand it. I guess we -- we were busy. We were busy\nworking, we were busy building a family, we -- we were busy with our children, we were\nbusy having fun sometimes. We were busy sitting on the lawn in the evening, and talking\nabout the neighbors, and about Holland, and how much of what we did in our childhood,and the fun we had, and -- and remembering old class songs, or stuff like that. Nobody\nmentioned a word about what had happened to us. And Carla\u2019s brother had gone through\nthe Holocaust, he was in hiding with her, he was there.",
        "Q: Was it considered a weakness to dwell on that, or --",
        "A: I think it probably was. There -- There are many -- I mean, this is in hindsight now, of\ncourse, and I\u2019ve heard -- we all have heard now, the stories of -- that the Holocaust\nsurvivors weren\u2019t particularly welcome in Israel after the war, because they represented\ndefeat, and what Israel was about was victory. And then there were these people who\nkept on talking about the horrors they had seen, and nobody wanted to hear this. Nobody\nwanted to hear the stories. And the hidden children -- that term by ca -- didn\u2019t exist, of\ncourse, but those who had been in hiding, we -- when you heard a story from a -- from a\nHolocaust survivor who had been in Auschwitz, you weren\u2019t going to talk about, hey, I\nwas in a room for two and a half years. They would laugh. Nothing happened to you. You\nweren\u2019t in the camps, you didn\u2019t see anybody die, did you? No, but -- anyway. No, it -- I\nguess there was something like that, but I\u2019m not sure that that influenced us at all. We\nlived with a little group of o-other Dutch kibbutznikim, some of who had also gone\nthrough hiding, and we worked hard, we got children, and we didn\u2019t talk about the war,\ntalked about everything but the war. Talked about the crummy bastards in the kibbutz\nwho were freeloading, on -- on us who were working so hard, and they talked about the --\nthe guy, the sadana witha the guy who puts you in work places every day, and he always\ngave you the lousy jobs. And talked about tractors, that they weren\u2019t working right, or\nstuff like that. Years went -- went by talking about that.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re -- After the war, you know, you -- you sort of welcome this, you know\nZionism, and -- and identified in that way with -- did it feel like giving up a -- a dream, or\nwas it the [indecipherable]",
        "A: Wait a minute, I didn\u2019t get that. Say it -- Would you reformulate that?",
        "Q: After the war you -- you were a Zionist, and you [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- these groups. And so your experience in Israel, did that sort of -- [indecipherable]",
        "A: Cure me of Zionism?",
        "Q: or--",
        "A: I guess I wasn\u2019t enough of an idealist to stick it out. Life in a kibbutz was hard. Carla\nwould have liked to stay. I opted for leaving Israel. She said she would have stayed. As a\nmatter of fact, she once said that someone in the kibbutz, and I never found out who it\nwas, some man had said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay with me? Let Ed go back to United\nStates?\u201d And she decided not to do that.",
        "Q: Was that hard for both of you, that conversation about whether to go or stay?",
        "A: Yeah, I\u2019m not quite sure, you see, I\u2019m not quite sure what happened there. I had this\njob --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: -- a continuation of the interview with Ed Lessing, and this is tape three, side A. So we\nwere just -- you were just on your way back from Holland to the United States. Pick --\nWe can pick up there.",
        "A: Yeah. We came back, and of course now we had a daughter, and I started looking\naround for a job, and an apartment, and we -- we found that in the next village where --\nfrom where we are right now, in Dobb\u2019s Ferry. And I started a job with a -- with an\ninstrument company. Let\u2019s see, a son -- we got a son. He was born here in the -- in here,\nin the area, and we moved from an apartment in Dobb\u2019s Ferry to this house in Hastings,\n36 years ago. In the meantime, I started going to school at night. I went to Pratt Institute,\nand got a degree in Industrial design, and started working on Madison Avenue, and then\ngot laid off there, because they ran out of work. This is just about the time Kennedy got\nassassinated. And then I sort of slid into doing free lance work for myself. And life went\non, and Carla started going to school, and she graduated, and she -- she first went -- got a\nBachelors, and then she got a Master\u2019s from Columbia, and she became a Social Worker.\nAnd was all -- that was a great accomplishment for us, because we had missed our\neducation in a sense. So now I was free-lancing, and then -- and I got a studio in New\nYork City for awhile, on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 42\" Street, in a prestigious\nbuilding, and a -- we were very busy, and the kids were growing up, and so on and so\nforth. I thought that our life -- my life would be pretty well without surprises further on. I\nlooked at it -- I forget what birthday that was, but it\u2019Il be my 40\" -- my 40\" would have --\nwould have been in \u201966, right? Born in \u201926. Anyway, somewhere, one of these birthdays,\nI said, \u201cWell, I think I\u2019ve seen it about.\u201d You know? Sounds a little cynical, but I had a\nbig birthday party, and at the end of the day I thought, probably it\u2019s going to go on until\nmy death wi -- about the same way, you know? With working, and kids growing up and\nleaving the home, and so on and so forth, and -- and two things happened. Actually, three\nthings happened, but -- but the first one happened in -- let me see, I think 19 -- 19 --\n1980. [inaudible] 1980? 1981. My wife got involved with a couple of other ladies in\nsetting up a -- something that hadn\u2019t been done before, a special kind of meeting of\npeople who had been in hiding. And now, she was always involved in reading Holocaust\nliterature, and especially Dutch 1s -- tr -- poetry, and stories written by Holocaust\nsurvivors. I never touched it. My brother sent me the standard work in Holland, about the\ndestruction of the Dutch Jewry, a two volume book, and it stood on the shelf. I once\nlooked, there were a couple of photographs in it, I was horrified, I put it back on the shelf,\nnever touched it. Anyway, in 1981, she started to organize this -- this business with -- but\nbefore that, there was an article in New York magazine, I\u2019m sure she had -- she must\nhave told you about all this -- was an article in New York magazine in which there was a\n-- a couple of stories, a bunch of stories of -- of hidden -- what they suddenly were called,\nhidden children, children who had been in hiding. It hit the -- It hit the -- the -- the -- the -\n- the -- the media, you know? In short order, CBS, NBC, ABC, the magazines, Time, Idon\u2019t know, Newsweek, everybody wanted to know -- a new buzz word there was,\nhidden children, who had ever heard of hidden children? Here we had been for 50 years\nsurrounded -- now we -- we didn\u2019t think about it ourselves. Anyway, that\u2019s the time we\ngot in -- we got asked to be interviewed by the Holocaust museum, I guess, and in short\norder we -- I got onto all kinds of television programs. I was on CNBC, we were -- the\nwhole family was on ABC Good Morning America, and -- it was amazing -- amazing\ntime. Anyway, the conference was in sight. It was on Memorial Day, 1981, I think. And\nCarla said to me, \u201cAre you coming to this conference?\u201d She had been very busy\norganizing this. I had heard the news, you know, and -- and -- and I -- I think my --  a-\nanswer was -- is -- is a classic by now, I -- I said, \u201cAh no, why should I come? I mean,\nyou will be busy, running around here -- there -- at the conference, and I'll just be\nhanging out, you know, waiting til it\u2019s over.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cyou know, my brother is\nespecially coming from Israel, and he\u2019ll be wandering around by himself. Couldn\u2019t you\njust come?\u201d And I said, \u201cAll right, all right.\u201d I\u2019ve been married for many years, you learn\nwhen to -- when to be acquiescent, you know? And so, there we gathered, on Memorial\nDay weekend, in -- on Times Square in the -- in the Marriott. And I think it was Friday\nnight when the first registration was supposed to be on, and I -- Carla was busy up there\non the seventh floor. They were -- They had the -- like, sort of places where you could\nregister. And I positioned myself between those windows, where people stood behind\nthem, had all these kits for they -- for those who had registered, and the elevators. Nowthe elevators 1-1-in -- in that hotel are made out of glass, sort of. They -- They -- They rise\nfrom -- from -- from the bottom on the -- in -- in an atrium. And then, when they come to\nthe floor, they open up, and they disgorge their people. And I stood there, and I watched\nthe elevators bringing up these people, these gray haired men and women, of all kinds of\nheights and sizes, and girth, and -- and then I saw them go to the -- to the windows there,\nwhere the volunteers of -- were standing, and they were getting their kits, and then they\ngot the tags, and they put the tags on, and they wrote on there where -- who they were,\nand where they had been in hiding. And I can\u2019t -- to this day I cannot explain to you, but\nas they got -- started to crowd around on the floor, and I began to read their tags, sort of\nfurtively, you know, I wasn\u2019t with anyone, and they began to form groups and talk, and I\nlooked at the tags, and the tags said, I was hidden in Belgium, I was hidden in France, I\nwas hidden in Holland. I came from Poland, I came from Romania. And this -- very\nstrange, but I began to cry. I began to cry, and it was to me as if I always had believed\nthat I was the only one who had been in hiding. Is a thing so strange, I mean, I knew, you\nknow. I mean, my o -- my own brothers, and friends, and everybody had been -- but here\nthey were, the hidden children, s -- 1600 of them. And they crowded around, and they\ntalked, and I just stood and looked at them, and I cried. And they were suddenly like I\nhad all these brothers and sisters, but of course, I had very little in common with most of\nthem, sum -- you know. There was very little in common between somebody who has\nbeen in hi -- in hiding in Poland, and somebody who has been hi -- in hiding in -- in\nFrance, let\u2019s say, or in Belgium. The situation w-were vastly different, but it didn\u2019t\nmatter. And the conference started up, and Carla\u2019s brother came, and we sat in the\nconference, 1600 people, we listened to Abe Foxman, you know, of the Anti-Defamation\nLeague, who was a hidden child. And we listened to other people. And I cried, and\neverybody cried. I cried for three days. Something magical happened there. I, who had\nnever read a book on the Holocaust, I suddenly was -- it was like, I don\u2019t know, like my\nmind opened up suddenly to something that I could -- you asked me, did you t -- earlier,\ndid you talk about the war, either in New Yor -- in -- in the Zionist organization or in the\nkibbutz? Never a word. Carla and I didn\u2019t talk about the war with each other. And it\nhappened there. It changed my life. I -- It went on for three days, and wherever I went, I\ntalked with people, and they talked to me, and I got to tell you funny thing, that people\nnever stopped talking, and they couldn\u2019t get enough of telling what happened to them, as\nif they had never -- as if -- as if they had never told it to anyone, you know. Or maybe\nthey didn\u2019t. It was -- It was so bad, I stood in the men\u2019s room next to a guy -- next -- the -\n- the guy next to me in the urinal said to me, \u201cSo, where were you in hiding?\u201d And I said\nin Holland. I said, \u201cSo where were you in hiding?\u201d He said, \u201cI was in Poland.\u201d And we\ntalked while we peed. And even there, you didn\u2019t stop talking with -- and -- and\n[indecipherable] what happened to me, and then we zipped up, and then we talked some\nmore outside. It was astounding. It was an astounding experience. And when it was over,\nthree days later, we left, and it was as if I had suddenly acquired, you know, like 1600\nsisters and brothers. I didn\u2019t want to leave. Nobody wanted to leave. There were people\nsitting downstairs in the lobby that -- that cried because it was over. When you ask people\ntoday, who were at that conference, they all remember it exactly. I was there. I\nexperienced it. It was as if the door suddenly opened, after 50 years. It was as if we were\nsuddenly allowed to remember. Anyway, I went home, it was very strange, as -- the car\nwas in the garage downstairs, as I drove out, an enormous thunderstorm broke out over\nManhattan. The sky was blue with lightning every second, and the rain poured down, and\nit thundered b-between those buildings, it sounded -- it was like hell had broken loose, it\nwas like God himself sort of thundered out on -- on us for -- you know, it was very\nstrange. Got home, started reading every -- every book, every pamphlet, every story I\ncould lay my hands on. And my life changed. It -- It\u2019s never been the same. I became a\nspeaker, became an interviewer for a -- Spielberg\u2019s Shoah Foundation. I -- I\u2019m a-about\nthe best speaker they have of the Hidden Child Foundation. I spoke last month at the\ncommemoration at the Supreme Court of New York state, to the judges and the lawyers.\nIt\u2019s -- All this happened after that day. So --",
        "Q: Let me ask you, based on -- on what has happened since then, and that you\u2019ve become\nso involved, do you look back on all those years of not talking about it, and wonder why\nyou and man -- and many others didn\u2019t really discuss the story?",
        "A: Yes, of course I have, and there\u2019s all sorts of theories about it. If you ask Carla, who is\na Social Worker, and who psychologically knows much more than I do, you heard her\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nsay earlier, when we were talking about it, briefly, about needing four decades to -- to be\nable to talk about it, but that -- that still doesn\u2019t -- I still don\u2019t understand. But th-the\nexperience is -- I\u2019m not the only one. There are so many who said -- I\u2019ve interviewed\npeople myself, not hidden children, but the camp survivors, who said, \u201cAh, Mr. Lessing,\nthis is the first time that I will be speaking about it. I\u2019ve never spoken about it like this\nwith anyone else.\u201d What is it? I don\u2019t know. I -- I -- Really, I\u2019m stupid, as far as that\u2019s\nconcerned, I have -- I have no idea why it took 50 years for me, but it -- for me there was\na definite epiphany, that -- that moment there, I could look, I could take you to the place\non that floor in the Marriott Marquis on Times Square, and say, here\u2019s where I stood.\nHere is where suddenly everything changed. No, no, come back in another 10 years,\nmaybe Ill have an answer. Maybe Carla had an answer, I\u2019m not quite sure. Anyway, I\nbecame quite active, slowly, not -- not immediately, but Carla, of course, had the --\nbecame vice-president of The Hidden Child Foundation, and I -- I began to -- and she\nformed a group here in Westchester, and I decided that my forte was maybe writing some\nthings, I have written little pieces, and I began to write a newsletter, every month I write a\nnewsletter, there\u2019s only two pages, but I love to write a little editorial for it, and I\u2019ve\nwritten those, and -- and then later I started a newsletter, same thing, two page newsletter\nfor The Hidden Child Foundation in New York, and that has a circulation of about 3,000\npeople, and that goes around, you know, the -- the whole New York region. That\u2019s my\ninvolvement, and the speaking -- the speaking involvement is much more intense. I spoke\nto, I don\u2019t know, maybe 15 - 20 places this -- during the Holocaust commemoration\nseason, you know, these -- these speech days come in seasons. Anyway, that was one --\none thing that changed my life. Now, I got to go to something very important. That was\nin 19 -- was that 1990, or 1991, the big [inaudible] 1991 -- 1981, I think. In 1982, there\nwas a decision that in -- of the Dutch Jews, that they would hold a conference for hidden\nchildren in Amsterdam. And of course we were invited to come, and of course we\ndecided, you know, we were hidden children from Holland, so Carla and I decided yes,\nwe will go there. Okay, tickets, airline tickets and so on, so forth, and -- about two\nmonths before -- about two months er -- before the conference, I decided that -- are you\ncomfortable? You could lean back, maybe, if that\u2019s easier for you.",
        "Q: No, that\u2019s fine.",
        "A: Are you okay?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: About a month and a half, or two months before conference in Amsterdam, I suddenly\ndecided that I had actually never said enough -- given enough thanks to one man in\nHolland, who had helped me save my life. I don\u2019t know if you remember I talked to you\nabout a police officer, Oskam, a great model of a naz -- Dutch Nazi, but he was really a\nwonderful guy. I thought, I wonder if Oskam is still li -- I didn\u2019t know his name. I\nwonder if that police officer is still alive. And I couldn\u2019t find his name in my mind. I\nasked my brother Fred, who did all the interviews, he said, \u201cYeah, something like\nBoscamp, or something like that.\u201d Anyway, I sent a letter to the Bureau of War dec --\ndocumentation in Amsterdam, and said -- described the hut where I had been, and\ndescribed Oskam, and I sent a little picture, a little photograph of Oskam, his wife, and\ntheir son, who was then three and a half, four years old, and sent it off to war document --\nand asked them, is Mr. Oskam -- Mr. Boscamp, or whatever his name 1s still alive, and I\ndescribed him. And I got a letter back that said, \u201cNo, we\u2019re sorry, but that gentleman has\ndied, and so -- his wife has also died. But his son, Oskam junior is still alive, and he\u2019s a\nretired plumber, and we sent your letter with the photograph, on to him.\u201d So I got a letter\nback from Oskam, junior. And he said, \u201cMr. Lessing, I don\u2019t know who you are, but I\u2019m\nvery grateful for the little photograph you sent me, I\u2019ve never seen that photograph.\u201d Of\ncourse he hadn\u2019t, because I had taken it just before I left for the United States. And he\nsaid, \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d And I said to him, \u201cI\u2019m sorry your father died, but I would\nlike to, when I come to Holland for the conference, I would like to get together with you,\nand talk about your father, he -- who saved my life, you know.\u201d And I got a letter back\nfrom him, it said, \u201cWell listen, I was only four -- four, four and a half years old, and I\ndon\u2019t know much. My father was a very closed man. I -- I don\u2019t know what to -- what I\ncould tell you.\u201d And I said, \u201cI don\u2019t really care, but I would like to find out a little bit\nabout your father, who was he, what -- what background did he come from.\u201d Suddenly, I\n-- it had to do with the whole hidden children business, too. Suddenly I decided I must\nfind out about what happened to me. I must find out what happened to all the Jews during\nthe Holocaust, and here was a chance. So I wrote to him, we\u2019re coming to Holland, and\ncan we meet with you. And he said, \u201cYeah, okay. I don\u2019t know what I can do for you, but\nokay.\u201d We go on the plane, and we are 10 minutes away from Amsterdam airport\nSchiphol, and the captain comes on. As they always do, it\u2019s, \u201cLadies and gentlemen,\nthank you for flying KLM, we\u2019ll be landing in 10 minutes in Schiphol, and don\u2019t forget\nany of your stuff,\u201d whatever, you know. And I burst out in crying -- crying, next to Carla.\nI\u2019m sobbing sitting there. She said, \u201c\u201cWhat happened, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d I said, \u201cThis\nshit makes no sense at all, but when we land, when this plane land in Schiphol, I see at\nthe end of the runway, there\u2019s a line of black trucks, with SS, waiting for me, and they\nwill kill me.\u201d A direct remembrance of the morning of the raid in the woods. And she\nsaid, \u201cWell, you know that that\u2019s not true.\u201d I said, \u201cI know that\u2019s not true,\u201d but that\u2019s how\nI felt it. It was like -- It was like I was right back there, you know? Well, we wer -- We\nlanded, of course, and my cousin was there with her little blue Honda, and of course the\nSS disappeared from my mind. Anyway, the next day we meet Oskams, junior. By this\ntime I found out the name is Oskam, not Boscamp, and Oskam ju -- Oskam junior, who\ndoesn\u2019t look at all like his father, but he looks like his mother, you know, have a round\nface, and round body, and very jolly guy, and he\u2019s a retired plumber, and then we meet\nhim in this tiny little doll\u2019s house, like they have in Holland. The whole house fits about\nin this -- in this room, you know? And they have the coffee, and the cake, as always in\nHolland, you know, you have to eat coffee, and you know, and big cakes with great\nalmond paste in it, lovely. And we sitting down, and we meet his wife, and -- so he said,\n\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d I said, \u201cWell I -- I didn\u2019t know who your father was, really,\nbecause it was all so secret.\u201d And he tells me a little bit about his father, and it comes out\nthat Oskam came from a family of all Nazis, Dutch Nazis, and bad ones, anti-Semites.\nPeople who tried to discover where Jews were hidden, and found them, and -- and\ndenounced them to the Germans. The worst. The whole family was one big heap of\ngarbage, you know? He was the only good one. But because the whole family was so\nbad, his reputation was -- was bad -- for the Germans was excellent, because he came\nfrom this virulent Nazi family, they thought he was so too, and when -- when I show you\na picture of him, he looks like it, like a Nazi in black uniform, and everything. He was a\ngood man. Anyway, we\u2019re talking, and he tells me about this br -- his father, and then --\nand then I said, \u201cListen, did you know there was a hut in the woods not far from here?\u201d\nAnd he said, \u201cYes, I -- I knew that, my father told me that.\u201d I said, \u201cDid you know who\nwas in the hut?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t know. My father didn\u2019t tell me too much about it.\u201d\nI said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t know that I was in there?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, I -- I don\u2019t.\u201d He said to me,\n\u201cWhy are you asking me these questions?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I had this crazy idea,\u201d -- all this\ncomes after the revelations in 1991, the conference. I -- I had to find out everything now.\nI said, \u201cI thought if maybe there were a group of men in there, and I probably saw them\nfor the last time when they were alive. And I thought maybe a brother or a sister, or\nmaybe even a father or a mother might still be alive, and I could tell them at least, for that\nlast morning, when we ran into the hut and warned them, and,\u201d -- and he\u2019s listening to\nme, and he says to me, \u201cBut Mr. Lessing, I just want to tell you something wrong with\nyour story.\u201d Is -- And I thought, \u201cWhat the hell does he know? He was four years old at\nthe time.\u201d I-I -- I said, \u201cWhat do you mean there\u2019s something wrong with my story?\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know much what happened there,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I know one thing.\nNobody was arrested that morning. They all escaped.\u201d Now, you\u2019ve got to realize, for 50\nyears I have lived with the idea, on and off, not every day, not every week, but at least\nonce a month, I would think about the morning of the raid on the hut, and how we\nstormed in, my buddy and I, and warned the men, and pulled the blankets off them, and\nshouted, \u201cIt\u2019s a raid, it\u2019s the SS, get up, the Germans are here.\u201d And then, when we saw\nthat they were all up and out and awake, we fled. And always the question came up, we\nshould have stayed, maybe. We should have stayed with them, helped them more. But\nthen it went in my mind, then, not the seven that were there, but we would have been\ncaught, too, and we\u2019d have been killed. This way, there were seven killed, at least two\nescaped. And that went on through the years, this feeling of guilt that we -- I didn\u2019t stay\nlong enough. I should have spent more time there. I -- I -- So what? I might have been\nkilled with them, but -- but then that didn\u2019t make any sense. We did warn them, and you\nknow, and we did our best, and so we couldn\u2019t help it, you know, this kind of stuff. And\nhere this man tells me they all escaped. So instead of being guilty of maybe not doing\nenough, it now comes out, I\u2019ve actually saved their lives, or helped save their lives. So, I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ncome out of that conference with this man -- this man, and my cousin is there, and she\nsays, \u201cSo, how was it?\u201d I said, \u201cYou can\u2019t -- I can\u2019t believe this. The men whom I\nthought were killed, all survived.\u201d \u201cGod,\u201d she says, \u201cthat\u2019s amazing. Who were they?\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cHe didn\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know either.\u201d By the way, I should backtrack for one\nsecond. At the beginning of the conference of my talk -- it is not a conference, but a talk\nwith -- with Oskam junior, he said, \u201cMr. Lessing, I went into the basement to see if\nthere\u2019s anything I could find on my father, and you know, there were thousands of paper\nmy father had gathered through the years. They were all the old tickets that he had given\nto people,\u201d you know, where you don\u2019t have a -- you don\u2019t have a na -- an a -- license\nplate in the back of your car, or people didn\u2019t have a | -- a light on the front of their\nbicycle, and there were thousands of those tickets, or copies of tickets. And he said, \u201cI\nthrew all those away. I saved a few things,\u201d and he came up with a picture. \u201cBut,\u201d he\nsays, \u201cI have something here, and it had -- was sent to my father by your mother.\u201d I said,\n\u201cMy mother? From where?\u201d He says, \u201cI don\u2019t know. It looks like from Africa someplace.\nAlgiers?\u201d He fishes out -- now this is 1992 I\u2019m talking about, so it\u2019s seven years ago, he\ndigs out of there a postcard sent by my mother, to his father, saying that she came out of\nBergen-Belsen, she doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s the mat -- what -- what happened to her\nhusband and s -- and her -- and her three sons. She wonder if they\u2019re still alive. Would he\nknow something more? And he hands me this postcard, it was like a postcard you get\nafter somebody dies, and it reaches you. It wasn\u2019t addressed to me, but it was my\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nmother\u2019s, she had written it, you know? She had typed it on the office typewriter there. I\nhave it here. That\u2019s how it started out already. He says, \u201cThis something that interests\nyou?\u201d I said, \u201c\u201cWhat do you mean it interests me? This is from my mother. She sent it\nafter she came out of Bergen-Belsen, she,\u201d -- I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s amazing, anyway. You\nsee, life was full of surprises, and -- so anyway, as I said, my cousin said, \u201cDo you know\nwho was in the c -- in -- in that hut?\u2019 I said no. She said to me, \u201cYou know, there\u2019s a\nradio program on here, comes on once a week, on Friday morning, it\u2019s called Address\nUnknown, goes on the Catholic radio station, and they interview people, there\u2019s a guy\nwho interviews people, and -- who are sic -- looking for people they have lost years ago.\u201d\nI said, \u201cYeah, well, you know, I lost people 50 years ago. Sh -- Who the hell would\nknow?\u201d And she said, \u201cOh, you could try.\u201d So I call up the radio station, and I got a -- got\nthe producer on the phone, and -- very nice lady, and she said -- I told -- I told her a little\nbit about this story, and she said, \u201cThat\u2019s a fascinating story, Mr. Lessing. Are you going\nto be here next month?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I -- I\u2019m here just for a conference, I\u2019m -- got to go\nback to the United States.\u201d And, she said, \u201cAh, that\u2019s too bad, because it takes us about a\nmonth to put program together, you know. We have already,\u201d and so on, so forth. You\nprobably know all about this, and -- okay, we went to the conference -- there\u2019s something\nelse I didn\u2019t tell you, and I should tell you about it. I don\u2019t --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the interview with Ed Lessing. This 1s tape three, side B. You\nwere just talking about going back to Holland.",
        "A: I said, \u201cNo, I have to go back to the United States.\u201d And we went to the conference.\nWe went to visit a lady in Brussels who was -- played a part in a friend of mine\u2019s life, and\n-- which I haven\u2019t told you about, and I sort of should backtrack on that later, because it\u2019s\nan important part also, what happened to me. Anyway, we go to the conference, we come\nback to my cousin again, who lives in the center of Holland. She lives, by the way, very\nclose to where I had been in hiding in the -- in the hut, and where Oskam junior lives,\nthat\u2019s all around Utrecht, the area they\u2019re in now. So, she says, \u201cCall the radio station,\nthey\u2019ve been calling here all -- all -- all the time.\u201d So I call them up, I get the producer\nupon the phone. \u201cYeah, Mr. Lessing, we -- we -- we decided that your story is so\nfascinating. Could you come next Friday morning?\u201d I said, \u201cSure.\u201d So, Friday morning\nvery early, Carla and I went to the radio station, and my cousin went also with us, and --\nand I said to my -- said, \u201cCarla,\u201d I said, \u201cthis is a waste of time,\u201d sit -- sitting there talking\nabout something that happened 50 years ago, who the hell would remember an obscure\nhut in an obscure piece of wood somewhere in an obscure little village?\u201d You\u2019re going to\nget that on. So -- But we were there, and there\u2019s a guy, he was sort of like -- you could\nsay a little bit like, oh, the Letterman of the -- of the Dutch air waves, a very popular\nman. Hans Frombilihamber, Hans Frombilihamber, should put his name in here. And\nHans seats me there, sits me down, and this is an hour program. They make a break after\nthe half hour, and then they gave our telephone number, and then people can call in if\nthey have any -- have any [indecipherable]. Anyway, he interviews me, and I tell him the\nstory about the hiding in the woods, and the -- the raid, and I tell him about finding\nOskam junior back, and about the terrible surprise, or the wonderful surprise, to find out\nthat I didn\u2019t -- what say -- did do enough, that I helped those people -- to save seven\npeople, to save their lives, and -- and -- and he makes a break, and they play some music,\nand then the program goes on, and at the end, he says, \u201cWell, thank you very much,\u201d and\nhe -- \u201cPll show you where we have the telephone.\u201d So we go back to a room, and they\nhave a dozen telephones there, and they have six people. And they do this every week, by\nthe way, it\u2019s been going on for years. There\u2019s six people, they take the telephone calls,\nand they write on slips whatever call comes in. And so, I come there, and these dozen\nphones are ringing off the hook. And they\u2019ve got a little stack of slips already this big.\nAnd they ask me, you know, as it goes on, as they\u2019re writing it, \u201cIs this something?\u201d And\nthey hold it in front of me. And there was very strange things. There\u2019s a -- \u201cYes, my --\nmy sister was in there, in the hut with a dog,\u201d You know, I -- there\u2019s all kinds of stupid\nthings. But, there was one -- th-there were several that were very interesting, one -- once -\n- one was -- said, \u201cMy brother was with you 1n the hut, but he is -- doesn\u2019t live here any\nmore in Holland, he 1 -- lives now in Indonesia, and he -- I\u2019m sure he would love to hear\nfrom you.\u201d His name on -- Herman Mueninghof. Okay, I don\u2019t know Herman\nMueninghof, you know, but might be true. And a little later, another message comes 1n, it\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nsays, \u201cI was with you in the hut, and I\u2019m listening to this broadcast, and I live right\naround the corner from the radio station. Please come and visit me afterwards.\u201d Lou\nFontichilin. I don\u2019t know Lou Fontichilin, but it says he was there. So anyway, we got --\nthe phone keeps on ringing, and finla -- finally it dies down, and -- and I got this big stack\nof p-pieces of paper, and they -- not only -- that -- that\u2019s not where it stops for them, any\nmessages that are important, they research, no matter where they are. They go all over the\nworld, find these people, and make contact with them. Okay, so it was wonderful. We get\ninto my cousin\u2019s little blue Honda, and we go around the corner, and I ring the door of an\napartment house, and this huge woman comes out, and throws her arms around me, and\nsays, \u201cEddie, I didn\u2019t think you would make it.\u201d I said, \u201c\u201cWho are you?\u201d She said, \u201cDon\u2019t\nyou remember me?\u201d I said, \u201cNo.\u201d She says, \u201cMy name was Perk.\u201d Her secret name was\nPerk during the war, \u201cBut,\u201d she says, \u201cI kept it. Cut me -- Call me Perk Fontichilar. And I\nremember you very well,\u201d she says. \u201cI used to be courier for the underground.\u201d Vaguely I\nbegan to remember something. She says, \u201cCome, Lou wants to meet you.\u201d Leads me into\nthe living room, and there\u2019s an old man sitting, with white hair, but I immediately\nrecognized him as one of the men I had left behind that morning. Ah, we cried, and we\nhugged, and we did, and -- I tell you, it was like -- couldn\u2019t believe it, that all this was\nhappening. Well, finally we settled down, and his wife brought some coffee, of course,\nand -- and we talked about the morning, and he said he ran away in his pajamas, and --\nand without shoes, and everyone managed to get out. I said, \u201cLou, who were the people\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwho were in the hut?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, I have some photographs that I took in the\nhut.\u201d I said, \u201cYou do?\u201d He said, \u201cYes, Pll show you.\u201d And he -- his wife brought out a\nbox of photographs, and there was photographs with all the men in the hut, and not only\nthat, but also the Canadian, and the Englishman, the flyers from the RAF on there. But I\nwasn\u2019t on there. And he said, \u201cBut I also have a picture of you.\u201d I says, \u201cYou do?\u201d And\nyes, and he came out with a photograph of -- of me standing in the hut, cynical young\nman.",
        "Q: Can you describe it for me?",
        "A: Well, what you\u2019re seeing here is -- looking at the bunk beds, the upright posts are\nmade from pine trees that were cut by the men, and you can see there\u2019s an upper bunk,\nsomebody\u2019s si-sitting on there eating a sandwich, and there\u2019s a lower bunk, where\nsomebody\u2019s eating an apple, or something like that, and I\u2019m leaning against one of the\nposts of the bed, in shorts, and a woolen jacket, and I\u2019m looking directly into the camera.\nI\u2019m the -- this man that I was talking with, had taken this photograph. It was taken in the\nfall of 1943, before the hut was raided. Now, I said to Lou -- and he described all the\nmen, and their names. So now I knew who had been in the hut. And then I ask him the\nfinal question, I said, \u201cLou, everything is revealed except one thing. Who was my buddy,\nwho was my partner that morning, who stood guard with me that morning, who escaped?\nWho was the man who my mother gave her bicycle to, and -- and the flashlight?\u201d And he\nsaid, \u201cI don\u2019t know, don\u2019t you know?\u201d I said, \u201cNo.\u201d He said, \u201cDon\u2019t you remember\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nanything of him?\u201d I said, \u201cI seem to remember a man who was a shoemaker in the regular\nlife.\u201d\u2019 And he said, \u201c\u201cOh, well, he wasn\u2019t a shoemaker, his father was a shoemaker, and his\nname was,\u201d -- I said, \u201c\u201cWhat was his name?\u201d He says, \u201cHis name was Jan Carman, Jan\nCarman.\u201d So now I knew who had been my buddy. I said, \u201cWhere is he, what happened\nto him?\u201d He said, \u201cEd, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re -- it can be, because Jan Carman was with me\nthat morning. We fled together.\u201d I said, \u201cLou, it can\u2019t be, he was with me. I think your\nmemory must be mixed up.\u201d He said, \u201cWell, maybe it is, you know, it\u2019s years ago, and\nI\u2019m old, and,\u201d -- I said, \u201cWhat happened to Jan Carman?\u201d He said, \u201cHe was with me\nthree weeks later, we were raided in -- in unrelated raid on a house with Jews, and he was\n-- he was taken, and he was executed in the dunes. And he 1s buried in the cemetery for\nthe martyrs, the -- of the Resistance, in Holland.\u201d So the picture changed again. The man\nwho were de -- who I thought were dead, were -- had -- had lived, the two who had\nescaped, one -- one had been caught, and was -- was executed. So, with that, I went one\nmore -- once more back with -- with Oskam junior, to the place where the hut had been.\nAnd then I knew 50 years had gone by, because where there had been an impenetrable\nwood of young pine trees, now there was a forest you could look right through, with tall\npine trees, and you could walk right through it. It poured that morning. It rained cats and\ndogs. I had a yellow slicker, and one of these plastic coats over me, and it poured, it was\na dismal day. And we went to where the hut had been, and the only thing there was was a\nslight depression in the ground. I tried to find a splinter of wood, a little piece of glass,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nsomething to take back, and there was nothing. And then finally he took me to the edge\nof the wood, where I stood that morning and watched the Germans come, and I stood\nthere in the rain, and they distanced themselve a little bit -- there was some more people\nthere. There were people from the -- the -- the nursing home next door. Anyway -- and I\nstood there, at the same place where I had stood that -- you know. And you know, it\u2019s\nweird, and it sound very dramatic, but it -- I stood there, and it was almost as if I could\nhear tires coming up again, up on the road. It was scary, it was scary being there. Must\nhave been a little bit like Holocaust survivors going back to Auschwitz, you know\u2019?\nAnyway, there is -- there\u2019s too much to tell, because it\u2019s all in little details, there -- the\nones who had given us food during the days when we were in the hut, were the nuns next\ndoor. Next to the wood was a fence, and then next to that, there was a -- what do they call\nthat, where nuns live?",
        "Q: A convent.",
        "A: The convent. And the sisters at the convent, every day put food next to the fence, and\nwe had cut a hole in it, and I would -- was one of the persons who was designated to\nbring the food to the hut. In the meantime, it had been converted from a convent to a\nnursing home for older nuns, and for other Catholics, and these people had heard the\nbroadcast. They had never known what had happened next door to them. And so, I was\ninvited to come to there, and we did that, and then I met some people who had been --\nthat same day had been incarcerated by the SS, who had just been caught hanging around.\nThe gardener, for instance, of the grounds of the convent had been -- he had come to see\nwhat was going on, he was thrown in jail. The Mother Superior, they had knocked on the\ndoor of the convent, and when she opened the door, they said, \u201c\u201cWe want to come in,\u201d and\n-- the SS said, and she had said, \u201cYou have nothing to li -- look for here,\u201d and they\nSlapped her in the face, and she fell on the ground, and they walked right over her, and\nthrew her in jail for three months, also. And Oskam, the policeman, was found walking\naround with a gun, which he was allowed to have, but in civilian clothes, because he had\nheard about the raid. And they took him in for awhile, he came back three weeks later,\nemaciated, and beaten up, and all this stuff was coming out of what had happened that\nday. Anyway, it was time to go back to the United States. I came -- I had -- I had a bunch\nof photographs from Lou, and I had made a whole slew of new friends from the radio\nstation, and -- and from, you know, the people, and it was all wonderful. And so Carla\nand I went back, and I settled down here, in this room, and I\u2019m sitting right here working,\nin December, 1992, I get a call. \u201cHi, this is Hans Frontikel in Holland, from the radio\nstation, remember me, I\u2019m -- I interviewed you?\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, how you doing, Hans?\u201d\n\u2018Fine. I wonder if you could come to Holland, I have a TV program, and we\u2019re going to\ndo a half an hour on the -- the Dutch Resistance, and also about the Jewish persecution,\nand I thought you, being involved in both, maybe I could interview you again, but now\non television.\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, well that\u2019s very nice, but I don\u2019t have a budget to go for 20\nminutes to Amsterdam.\u201d \u201cOh no,\u201d he said, \u201cwe pay your flight, and we pay your hotelsand everything.\u201d I said, \u201cI'll be there.\u201d And so all of a sudden I found myself back in s --\nin December, and this is what happened. H-Hans, my interviewer send his -- wh-what is\nit called, his -- the guy you -- an -- an editor. Tall guy, and he said, \u201cEd, I would like to\ngo over the story once more with you, just quickly, for the interview, the day after\ntomorrow.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d I said, \u201cFirst of all,\u201d -- no, I -- I -- I -- I said, \u201cOkay, but,\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cyou know the story.\u201d \u201cYeah, we sed -- like to -- tell me a little bit shortly, again.\u201d\nAnd so I said, \u201cWell,\u201d [indecipherable], it was in the camp, and [indecipherable] you\nknow, and we got raided, and I was -- was out with a buddy, and\u201d -- and he said, \u201cDo you\nknow who your buddy was?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t know in August, but now I\u2019ve heard\nthat it was a cert -- a -- a certain Jan Carman.\u201d And they said, \u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d\nAnd he said -- I -- I -- Is -- I said, \u201c\u201cHe was shot in the dunes. He 1s buried, and,\u201d I said, \u201cI\nvisited his grave yesterday.\u201d I had in the mean time, gone to the graveyard of the\nResistance people, and there I cried over Jan\u2019s grave, and -- and -- Tong was his name,\nTong, the editor. He said, \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, \u201cnow, the day after tomorrow, Ill come and\npick you up, and first we\u2019ll go to the museum of the Dutch Resistance.\u201d I said, \u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cwell, I want to show you a film there, and,\u201d -- okay. So, we went there,\nand I sat there, and this was in the former synagogue, and so I sat there, and I watched\nthis film, which seemed like an old film, it didn\u2019t seem -- I said, \u201c\u201cWhy are you showing\nme this?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI was told to do this,\u201d and I couldn\u2019t figure it out, you know?\nAnyway, when it was over, we went to the TV studio, and there on the set was a nice\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthick couch, and on the end of the couch was a little Christmas tree, cause the program\nwas going to be aired on -- on Christmas day. And it was a live audience. Oskam junior\nand his wife was there, and my cousin with her husband were there, and as -- my second\ncousin from -- from The Hague come over. And I was alone, Carla hadn\u2019t come with me\nya -- you know. So, the lights went on, and there was Hans with a nice Christmas tie, and\nme, in little -- nice little Jewish boy, sitting next to a Christmas tree. So, by then I had\nbeen on TV a couple of times, and I had some idea, you know, I was here on channel 13,\nand I\u2019ve been there with CNBC, and a couple other places, and -- and so I sort of knew\nwhat the routine was, you know, and the interviewer asks the questions, and you give the\nright answers, you know, and don\u2019t embarrass anybody, and you don\u2019t be idiot, you\nknow. So, he said, \u201cMr. Lessing, many will remember you from this summer, when I\ninterviewed you on radio, but now here you are again, and I want to ask you a few\nquestions.\u201d And so he asked me where I was during the war. I said I was in hiding. And\nwhere were you in hiding? I -- Well, I was, among other places, was in this hut. And what\nhappened? Well, we were raided. And -- And the interview went along fine, you know,\nstandardized. By then I got a little bit, shall I say, blas\u00a2\u00e9 about the whole thing, you know\u201d?\nBut it was fun to be there, and -- and he said, \u201cSo, Mr. Lessing, what happened?\u201d I said,\n\u201cWell, we stood guard, a buddy of mine, and -- and -- and I, and we happened to see the\nGermans coming, and we went back and warned the others, and,\u201d -- he said, \u201cDo you\nknow who your buddy was?\u201d I said, \u201cWell yes, he is Jan Carman, and he -- I visited his\ngrave yesterday, and he got executed by the Germans, near the dunes in Holland.\u201d And\nthen he said something that did not fit in the thing, and he said, \u201cMr. Lessing, I want to\ntell you that we have received a part of a diary of the man -- your buddy, your partner\nwho stood guard with you that morning, describing that morning, the raid, and\neverything, just like you tell it.\u201d And I thought for a second, and I thought, he is wrong,\nthat can\u2019t be. Cause Jan Carman\u2019s date on his grave says he was -- he was executed in\nFebruary, 1945 -- 1944, and we were raided on the 29\" of December, 1943. There had\nonly been a couple of weeks in between, and he was on the run all the time, I knew that\nfrom Lou. So I thought this -- something -- something is screwed up here, and -- but, you\nknow, live audience, you\u2019re not going to -- so I said, \u201cOh.\u201d And then he said something\nthat really chilled me to the bone. He said, \u201cMr. Lessing, I want to tell you that the man\nwho was with you that morning, who stood guard with you then, was here -- is here to\ntalk with you.\u201d And I became ice cold, and I thought, I just visited his grave, and the dead\ndon\u2019t rise from the grave, and -- and he is so fucked up here, you know with this, I\u2019m\nsorry, excuse my language, but I didn\u2019t know what to think. And a light went on on the\nfar end of the stage, and this man walks out, tall man, who I\u2019d seen in the photographs,\nwho was described to me as the man who lived in Indonesia. And out walks this man,\nHerman Mueninghof. And he walks over to me, and he grabs my hand, and he said,\n\u201cEddie, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re alive.\u201d And I said, \u201cHerman, it\u2019s wonderful.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat\nare you doing here?\u201d He said, \u201cThe TV people brought me here.\u201d I said, \u201cAll the way\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nfrom Indonesia?\u201d I said, \u201cWhat do you do there?\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m a Catholic bishop, and I\nlive in New Guinea.\u201d I said, \u201cBut why are you here?\u201d He said, \u201cThey wanted me to meet\nyou.\u201d I said, \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful,\u201d I said. He said, \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to remember that --\nhow we stood guard together that morning. You don\u2019t -- don\u2019t you remember how we --\nhow your mother saved our lives? How your mother, that night, gave me her bicycle, and\nthe flashlight?\u201d And all of a sudden I realized I was wrong. It -- It wasn\u2019t the other man,\nit was this man, this bishop, this Catholic bishop, Herman Mueninghof. And again the\npicture changed. The -- Again we -- the two of -- two of us had survived, and the others\nhad survived also, the only one who had not survived was this poor Jan Carman, who had\nbeen in the hut, who I had remembered vaguely. And we talked, and we cried, and this\njust -- I said -- he said to me, \u201cYour mother saved -- saved our lives.\u201d I said, \u201cYes, I\nknow.\u201d He said, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d I said, \u201c\u201cWhat do you mean I don\u2019t?\u201d He said, \u201cDo you\nremember how your mother gave me her bike, and a little flashlight?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, I do\nremember. You went out, you -- you pedaled away in -- in the darkness.\u201d He said, \u201cI\nhadn\u2019t gone more than two minutes away when a German sprang out in the middle of --\nof the road -- the path, and said, halt, get off the bike, stand against the wall.\u201d There was a\nlittle pumphouse there. He said, \u201cAnd I stood against the wall, with my face to the wall,\nand he frisked me from top to bottom, to feel if I had any weapons. If your mother hadn\u2019t\ntold us to bury the weapons that we had, our -- our nine millimeter Mausers,\u201d he said,\n\u201cthey would have shot me, probably, on -- on the spot.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat happened then?\u201d\nHe said, \u201cI don\u2019t know where I got the guts, but I said, what are you doing? Why are you\nstopping me like this?\u201d And the German said, \u201cI know you\u2019re one of these -- these\nterrorists from the hut.\u201d And Herman said, \u201cWhat hut? I don\u2019t know any hut. What are\nyou talking about?\u201d And he said, \u201cYes, don\u2019t deny it, you\u2019re one of the terrorists from the\nhut. We have orders to arrest you all, and we\u2019ll get you.\u201d He said, \u201cI have no idea what\ny, -- he said, \u201cI come from night school.\u201d He says, \u201cYou come from night school, what?\nWhere night school?\u201d He says, \u201cI come from night school in Zeist, and,\u201d -- he said,\n\u201cWhat are you studying there?\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m studying to be a Notary Public,\u201d which was\ntrue, Herman was studying to be a Notary Public. And he said -- and he said, \u201cI felt that\nthe guy, what he really wanted, was the little flashlight.\u201d Now this wasn\u2019t an ordinary\nflashlight, 1t was something that was worth gold in the last -- in -- during the war. It was\nmade by Philips. It was a little hand generator, you squeezed it, and 1t made light. And in\na time that there were absolutely no batteries any more, these things were worth gold.\nPeople would buy -- pay hundreds of gilders to get one. And the guy wanted this, you\nknow, it was worth something to him. And Herman was very smart, he says, \u201cI thought\nthat if he arrested me, he would have to hand everything over to his superior officer, but\nif he let me go, he could keep the flashlight. So he -- I said to him, give me the bike, the\nbike is no good to you, it\u2019s solid tires.\u201d He said, \u201cWhat I -- M-My mother is waiting with\ndinner, you know.\u201d And he said, \u201cI could see the guy thinking, and then he said, \u201cNah,\nalza gazie, go.\u201d And he said, \u201cI got on the bike, and I pedaled away. And if it hadn\u2019t beenfor your mother telling us to drop the weapons and bury them,\u201d he says, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be\nhere.\u201d Another surprise. There was no end to the -- to the surprises.",
        "Q: Let me ask you some general questions, because it\u2019s interesting how you talk about\nthe picture changing, and even over the last 10 years, all this information that you\u2019ve now\nlearned from, you know, about ha -- what happened 50 years ago, can you just talk just\ngenerally about what it\u2019s been like for the last decade, to revisit the history, and have it\nall change, you know, fill in all those holes.",
        "A: Wh-What about it?",
        "Q: Just what that experience is like, to -- to now, all this time later, be learning the history\nof what you went through?",
        "A: It\u2019s a little bit like being hungry, and never really having enough to eat. It\u2019s a weird\nthing to say, I guess. I am daily still trying to find out what happened, not exactly to me,\nbut what happened to -- to the Dutch Jews. I read articles, I -- my cousin send -- the same\ncousin with her little blue Honda, sends me, almost weekly, articles from the Dutch\nnewspapers describing the things that had happened in Holland. The money that\u2019s\nmissing, the paintings that were stolen. The -- The archive of -- of -- of -- of name cards\nthat was found recently, abandoned by the Dutch government, somewhere in -- in it -- on\nthe third floor. All these things still are filling out my picture of what happened in\nHolland, to the Dutch Jews. Every new book that comes out, I immediately buy, and they\nsend me from Holland, in Dutch, or whatever. That story seems to never be completely\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ncomplete. There\u2019s always new -- seem to be new little things coming out. Because it\u2019s\nimpossible to remember two and a half years, every minute of it. So, I found out some of\nthe things, and -- and -- but there\u2019s still the desire to find out exactly where was I, what\ndid I think, what happened? It\u2019s an ongoing thing, it will go on til the end of my life now,\nbecause the -- the -- the clarific -- it -- 1t\u2019s like -- it\u2019s like troubled water that slowly\nbecomes clarified, more and more and more and more, who we were then, what we were,\nwhat we did, why did I do this, why did I? So, that\u2019s the best that I can tell you, it -- itis a\nneed to find out, still. And it all started in that God damn moment there, on that seventh\nfloor of that hotel. It all started there. It\u2019s very strange. It was time to go home. I got on\nthe plane, very, very tired, because so much has been revealed to me now again. And I\ngot back to JFK, to the JFK airport in New York, and Carla was waiting for me there.\nAnd she said, \u201cWell, how did it go?\u201d I said, \u201cI got to tell you something. It\u2019s very strange,\nbut for a Jewish boy like me, has now ha -- I have a friend who 1s a Catholic bishop in\nNew Guinea, in Indonesia.\u201d I subsequently asked Herman to send me the complete diary,\nand when I got it there were pages missing. And I send him a letter, and I said -- I call\nhim Herman, I don\u2019t -- don\u2019t call him Your Holiness, or Your Worship, or whatever. Or\nbishop. And I said, \u201cHerman, where are the pa -- missing pages, again?\u201d He said, \u201cThere\nwere things in there that were not so nice.\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t care. I want -- would like to\nknow.\u201d And he send me the pages. There were remarks made by the members of the\nResistance in the hut, about Jews not being reliable enough, you couldn\u2019t trust them with\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nyour life. I mean, this is -- this is ironic. They had this 17 year old Jewish kid, he was not\nin the Resistance, he was just in hiding. They didn\u2019t really want him in the hut, but\nOskam, who was very influence -- influential in that area for the Resistance, and he was\npivotal for them, had asked them to take in this Jewish kid, and so they had to take him\nin. But it wasn\u2019t -- there were several members who said, \u201cWell, we ca -- we can\u2019t really\ntrust him, you know?\u201d What is so superiorally ironic is that I later on saved the God damn\nlives of these men. I mean, it\u2019s interesting how things evolve. Let me see. You don\u2019t want\nto go forever with this -- with this -- are you running out of tape?",

        "Q: Let\u2019s stop for a second.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "Q: This is the continuation of an interview with Ed -- with Ed Lessing, and this is tape\nfour, side A. And we were just going to talk in general, sort of, thinking about how\nyou\u2019re a different person than you might have been without the experiences you went\nthrough during the war. Let\u2019s first start in terms of religion, cause you had mentioned\nduring -- during the war that you had made that promise to continue -- you made a\npromise to God to continue with religion, I wonder if you\u2019d talk about that, a-and how\nthat didn\u2019t work out.",
        "A: They say that in the -- in the first World War, I guess, that in the trenches, every --\nevery soldier becomes religious, and prays. And in a sense that\u2019s, I guess, what happened\nto me. And my mother would have certainly approved of it when I s -- when I said that --\nI promised God that I would try to keep his -- the laws he had given to Moses on Mount\nSinai, and in the desert, that I would follow them all my life, if he would just spare my\nfamily. And they survived. And I held on for years afterward, in this country, I would -- I\nhad my own kind of Jewish religion. On Yom Kippur, I would take a prayer book -- no, I\nwouldn\u2019t -- not -- not a prayer book, I would take the Old Testament, and I would go out\nto the Hudson river, and I\u2019d sit there all day long, and I\u2019d fast, and I read. I read about the\nJews, and their history, and the battles, and King David, and King Solomon, and all the\nwonderful stories of the Old Testament, and of my people. But at -- again, as I began to\nfind out what the Holocaust really had -- had been, it all seemed -- religion seemed like a\nfarce. God had taken his own people, and murdered one and a half -- let the Germans\nmurder one and a half million of his own children, little children, innocents. It didn\u2019t\nmake any sense. Like so many other Holocaust survivors, I guess, there was no thinking\nof God after Auschwitz. And so I slowly, slowly left it all. I became -- I read more, and\nmore, and more, and none -- none of it pointed to the existence of -- of God. It all pointed\nout to the -- to the terrible things that human beings can do. So, religion became not\nimportant any more to me. What did become more and more important, though, is the\nfate of the Jewish people. I am very fervent in my defense of the j -- of the Jewish people,\nas a most marvelous, marvelous people. Difficult people. Moses knew that already, goes\nup for a couple of days on the mountains, come back, and they already screwed it up,\nthey made a golden calf. There\u2019s a lesson there. I mean, the J-Jews are difficult, and they\nare impossible, but they\u2019re also genius, they are the salt of the earth. And to me, the\nJewish people in Israel, they\u2019re -- our country, I mean, this is all miraculous, after 2,000\nyears. Jews have waited for this, and we\u2019ve got a country. And I thank God. We have\nworked -- We have gone there for five years at least, and given our lives to it. It was well\nworth it. So, religion is sort of evolved into a fervent nationalism, and -- and a defense of\nthe Jewish people. I will accept no blame whatsoever to Israel, what they do, or whatever\nthey do. It\u2019s -- I\u2019m like the old fashioned English -- Englishman, you know? My country -\n- Or maybe it was an American, I don\u2019t know. I think it was an Englishman who said, my\ncountry right or wrong. To me, the -- the security of the Jewish people is uppermost, and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nit sounds horrendous, but if it would be necessary to throw every Arab out of -- out of\nIsrael in order to secure it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- the safety of it\u2019s people, I\u2019d say, don\u2019t hesitate, do it.\nWe have suffered for 2,000 years, murder and mayhem. I mean hangings, burnings, it\u2019s\nhorrible, the whole Jewish history is -- is one of -- of -- of suffering. Enough. Now it\u2019s\nour time. And so, I guess, my religion became really my love for -- for my people. And\nit\u2019s difficult sometimes you know? I -- We had to -- Carla has two grand -- had a\ngrandnephew here, very nice young man who worked for the Israeli embassy here, and he\ncame with his girlfriend, and they stayed here for three months upstairs in a little room.\nAnd we had this -- we had this conversation, and they said, \u201cOh, we don\u2019t -- we don\u2019t\ngive a damn for politics in Israel, it\u2019s horrible. We don\u2019t want to know anything about\npolitics, and we don\u2019t want to -- and I think we should give the land back to the -- to the -\n- to the Palestinians, or whoever, and th-the Syrians, and -- and we don\u2019t want to be\ninvolved in this.\u201d And I -- These were the people I admire, these are the sabbers, the\npeople who are born there, and I said, \u201cLet me tell you something. Let me give you at\nleast a view of a Holocaust survivor. We had no country, we had nowhere to go. There\nwas no way out, they murdered us by the millions.\u201d I said, \u201cThe Jewish people suffered\nunbelievably, [indecipherable]. Now there\u2019s a country, and you are our hope.\u201d I said,\n\u201cThe first thing for us as -- as survivors, is a Security, a safe haven, where Jews can go,\nwhere Jews can be defended. So don\u2019t say that you\u2019re not interested, please.\u201d And they\nunderstood. So, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s an answer for your question, but that\u2019s as close as I\ncan come. Religion is no longer of an -- any importance to me at this point, but the fate of\nmy people is, very much so.",
        "Q: Let me ask you about the -- the interviews that your brother Fred did with -- with the\nfamily. First of all, when did -- when did that happen, did that start to begin this process\nof being interested in [indecipherable] this --",

The family\u2019s recollection of the Holocaust years, and there are one,\ntwo, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 tapes, and everybody that I\nknow is like -- Carla, my wife, and Hans, my cousin, Carla -- Fred, my brother.

        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Transcription. No, it doesn\u2019t give -- has a wonderful preface, by the way, and the first\ninterview, I think was probably 1979.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q: So, these interviews began long before your process of realizing that this was\nimportant to go back, and --",
        "A: Well, not so -- not so long, a couple of years before, yes. We had -- The first\ninterview, with my mother is really -- I would love to write a play around it, a one act\nplay, maybe. It is an interview that is at the same time serious, I\u2019ve quoted some of it to\nyou, and it\u2019s also hilarious, because everybody 1s sitting around a round table, and it\u2019s not\njust the -- it started out as a regular interview with my mother, but it finally -- everybody\nthrew in their two cents worth, there are interruptions, and -- and -- and my father says I -\n- should I bring the dog to the vet tomorrow? And it\u2019s like -- it\u2019s a wonderful interview, I\nwould love to see it on stage, as a beginning of my mother\u2019s story. So, the other dates, I --\nI -- I don\u2019t know if you want to know them all, but [indecipherable] has -- he transcribed\nthis, by the way, with his son Ben, who doesn\u2019t know any Dutch, and half of my\nmother\u2019s story is in Dutch. [indecipherable] Pll just give you another date. Oh, this is\neven earlier, 1985. He interviewed my father at 1985. And he interviewed me, I'll do the\nlast one, okay? He interviewed me in 1983, and my -- my other brother even later, I\nthink. Did I answer your question, or did I digress again?",
        "Q: [indecipherable] Another question I would ask, from the -- your interview, you talked\na lot about going back to therapy, and sort of looking back at that time, and I wanted to\nsort of ask, not a specific question, but how that process has sort of changed your other\nviews, too?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: The therapy? Oh, night and day. About 25 years ago, I had ulcer symptoms, and I\nwent to my mem -- my -- my house doctor, and -- that\u2019s a typical Dutch translation, isn\u2019t\nit, my house doctor? I don\u2019t know what they call it [indecipherable |",
        "Q: Family doctor?",
        "A: Yeah, family doctor. In Holland they say your house doctor. Every once in awhile I\ncatch myself with these Dutch translations. And he said, \u201cWell, you know you -- you\nhave to get an -- undergo a G.I. series, you -- you have like ulcer symptoms, you may\nhave an ulcer. Anyway, it came out I didn\u2019t have an ulcer yet, but I was very close, and\nhe said -- he recommended that I go to a clinic in a hospital nearby, where it -- for very\ncheap, and you could get therapy, you know, but -- and it was -- c-could be seen by a --\nso I contacted a -- a doctor there, and he said -- and when he found out that I was a\nHolocaust survivor -- that was just sort of be -- people began to be aware that there was\nsomething special with people who have come through that, and -- and I started going\nevery -- once a week to this -- to this clinic. Unfortunately, after awhile, that doctor\ncouldn\u2019t see me any more, but he recommended me to another doctor, Doctor Hillel\nSwiller, and I went to him for about -- one of the first sessions I had with him, I said,\n\u201cLook, I want to tell you something doctor,\u201d I said, \u201cI am not one of these guys who\nbelieves in going for years and years and years into psychotherapy. I see it more or less,\nexactly the way, if I break a leg, I go to a doctor, and he puts a cast around it, and then\nlike a month later, or you know, whenever, two months later, the cast comes off, andthat\u2019s the end of it, you know?\u201d Well, that was 23 years ago, and -- and I don\u2019t go now\nany more, I -- but he totally changed me, because I was a very angry person. I can still get\nvery angry, but at least I -- I calm down again. I was very depressed, skies were gray all\nthe time, and I was very angry. I was not a very good father, I\u2019m afraid, with my children,\nI got very angry sometimes, I would throw things against walls, and ooh, when I think\nback of it, it\u2019s almost unbelievable that I was like that, but I -- I was. Had no insight in\nmyself. That is all changed, you know, you begin to -- maybe just age, but also, again,\nfinding out about what happened to us then, has clarified my own personality a lot, you\nknow? I can see myself now as -- as that -- the little boy, who -- how he grew up, and\nhow he -- the 1929 episode in -- in the United States was a terrible one. My mother had to\nfarm me out. She farmed me out to a young woman who -- I don\u2019t know if she beat me,\nbut she was very bad for me. I remember crying, and doing -- and finally my mother\nfound out, and she took me away from there, and farmed me out to old people, grandma,\ngrandpa they were called, and they were lovely for me. But that first -- first experience,\nbeing separated from my mother, who had to go to work because my father was in the\nhospital then, and being alone, and being mistreated, when the war came, and the whole\nthing started all over again, the loneliness, and the danger and the fear, I think it all\naccumulated. And then we had, what, 25 years of doing nothing, and then you wind up\nwith a psychiatrist. It\u2019s -- You know, it\u2019s funny. One of the last sessions -- recently I had\nto go back to him for just the one session, because I have interviewed a man nearby here,\nwho had been in Auschwitz with his brother, and the story was so terrible that I had\nnightmares overnight, wh-what happened to him, happened to me during the night, and\nthe next morning I was crazy, I -- I couldn\u2019t clear my head, and I -- my wife said,\n\u201cYou've got to go see -- see a shrink because, you know, this has been too much of a\nthing.\u201d And I went back to him, and we tal -- and he helped me immediately, and we\ntalked about it, and he -- he explained to me why it upset me so much, because it was --\nthis man had been with his brother in Auschwitz, and it brought all my war stories back,\nthe danger, and the fear with my little brothers, and -- and I said, \u201cYou know, I never\ntalked about the Holocaust with you, did I?\u201d And he began to laugh, he said, \u201cYou did\nnothing else.\u201d He says, \u201cYou did -- you did all the time,\u201d he said. I said, \u201cI can\u2019t\nremember that, did I talk about? I thought I only talked about sex, and -- and -- and\nwomen, and,\u201d -- he said, \u201cYou crazy.\u201d He said, \u201cYou,\u201d -- no, he didn\u2019t say I was crazy.\nHe said, \u201cEd,\u201d he said, \u201cevery session you talked about the Holocaust.\u201d \u201cOh, I did? All\nright.\u201d So, I don\u2019t know where we started with this question, I lost myself in the answer,\nbut -- oh, did th -- did therapy change me, how did it change me? It made me into a more\nwise person, I think. More livable person. I don\u2019t think our marriage would have lasted if\nI hadn\u2019t, was pretty impossible, you know? Carla is very even person, 1s like -- the whole\nfamily, her mother was like that, her brother is like that, they\u2019re wonderful people. They -\n- They\u2019re not -- don\u2019t have great emotional outbursts on the up side, but also not on the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ndown side. They\u2019re very, very stable, and I was very unstable. So, Iam more stable now,\nlet\u2019s put it that way.",
        "Q: In -- In terms of what\u2019s made you and Carla so involved now, recently, the last 10\nyears, where maybe other people, other survivors, they\u2019 ve withdrawn more, what\u2019s made\nyou do -- choose that path, and also how is it -- how has that changed you?",
        "A: You know, I -- I\u2019ve thought about it, and I\u2019ve come up with an answer that may not be\nthe right one, but when you deal with Holocaust survivors, as you do now, and as I have\ndone in interviews, you realize there\u2019s an enormous range of suffering. Those people --\nand I\u2019ve interviewed people who were lying 1n a hole in the ground in the woods for nine\nmonths, frozen practically to death. That is not comparable to what I -- what happened to\nme. They saw th -- I\u2019ve interviewed people where, first their fa -- their mother, then their\nfather was killed, then the brothers, a -- a woman had seven brothers, she wound up with\none after the war. One by one they were killed in Polish forests where they were in\nhiding. One by one, she saw them being slaughtered. That woman is probably -- it is\nprobably impossible for her to go out and do interviews -- interview other Holocaust\nsurvivors. I come from a family that survived complete. An oddity in Holland, by the\nway. Holland has a -- has a -- I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar with the statistics of\nHolland. Holland is the worst country after Poland and Greece, and certainly by far the --\nthe worst country for survivors in -- in the -- in -- west of Europe, western Europe. So,\nmy k -- my family survived. I came out with a father, I came out with a mother, I came\nout with two brothers. I came out with cousins, I came with uncles, aunts, a whole family.\nI think that because of that, it is possible for me to go and interview other people, and not\ngo completely to pieces. I think if I had been like the woman who saw her family\nslaughtered one by one in the Polish forest, I don\u2019t think I could be like -- sitting here,\ntalking with you like this. So -- Then there is something else, this is usually not talked\nabout. There is an intellectual range in Holocaust survivors, as well as non-Holocaust\nsurvivors, course. It makes a big difference what -- where you come from, intellectually.\nIf you come from a Polish farming family, a Jewish family, somewhere in a shtetl, where\nthe father was a shoemaker, and the mother did the household, and -- and life was fairly\nprimitive, but wonderful, but then, that\u2019s not my background either. I come from a\nfamily, my father was an artist. My mother was a telegraph operator when she -- when --\nwhen no women were practically working. I come from a family that loved music, loved\nliterature, loved all the kinds of things. I come from a family where I have one -- two\nbrothers who were college professors, one -- one has changed in the meantime, to be an --\na psych -- a psychotherapist. You know, this makes a big difference. I-It\u2019s possible for --\nfor Carla and me, come from a little different group, little different level, to help others.\nWhen -- When we go to national conferences, and I see the others, they\u2019re not that many\nthat -- I cried when I saw them the first time, the 1600 hidden children, and I still feel,\nyou know, love for them, but -- but I realize now that not all Holocaust survivors are\npeople that -- that I can -- that I can feel at home with, you know? And it\u2019s interesting in\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nmany of the interviews that I\u2019ve done, the interviewee said, \u201cEd, we got to get together\nafterwards, you know. Let\u2019s go out, you and my -- my wife, and -- a-a-and I, and you and\nyour wife, and we\u2019re going to have dinner together.\u201d And I thought, \u201cI can\u2019t do this, not\nwith you.\u201d I mean, very primitive people sometimes. Lovely people, but primitive, I\ncouldn\u2019t -- you know, I couldn\u2019t. There was nothing we had in common, except that I\ninterviewed them. So -- Let\u2019s see, what was the qu -- what was the question? Oh, why do\nwe -- why can we do this, and others cannot? I think it had to do with our background,\nthe fact that we\u2019re not too damaged, and the fact that we came from backgrounds where\nreading, and -- and -- and culture was of -- of importance. And you\u2019|I find this all over, if\nyou look at the people who, let\u2019s say, are important in -- in the Holocaust community,\nthey\u2019re most -- mostly people who were not that terribly damaged, and who -- who can\nwrite, and read, and understand, and so -- or a psychologist, or whatever. I don\u2019t kn -- I --\nI think -- that is my view of it.",
        "Q: Is there anything else that you want to --",
        "A: Yeah. I forgot something. And I think he deserves a place, and I don\u2019t think he is in\nthe original interview, because he couldn\u2019t be. After the conference, in 1981, of the\nHidden Children, a letter arrived at my -- my wife\u2019s desk in New York, of the Hidden\nChildren, from a man in Yonkers, his name was Eddie Strauss, have you heard of him?\nNo. Eddie Strauss wrote a letter, and it said, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m a hidden child from\nBelgium, and I\u2019m so terribly sorry I couldn\u2019t come to the conference, because I was in the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nhospital, but I would like to take up contact with you.\u201d And Carla came home with this\nletter, and she handed it to me, and said, \u201cListen, I\u2019m very busy, and this man writes, and\nhe lives right nearby here, about 10 minutes away, in Yonkers. Maybe you can contact\nhim.\u201d Okay. So one day I call -- called up this man, and I got him on the phone, and I --\nand I said, \u201cAh, Mr. Strauss?\u201d \u201cYes?\u201d I said, \u201cMy wife handed me this letter, could I\ncome and say hello to you?\u201d You know. \u201cYeah, I heard you -- you were sorry you\ncouldn\u2019t come to the conference.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d he said. So I went down, straight down\nBroadway, same Broadway you have in New York, and entered a dark apartment,\nclimbed five stairs, five steps up from street level, and entered a dark apartment, and\nthere in the far -- far end of the dark apartment sat a man in a wheelchair, with one leg. I\nhadn\u2019t expected this. He was overweight, and I shook his hand, and I said, \u201cSo, tell me\nabout yourself.\u201d And out comes this story that he was -- he lived in Antwerp, in Belgium,\nand he was play -- out playing one day, and he stayed out too late, and when he came\nback, a neighbor grabbed him from the street, and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t go home.\u201d And he\nfound out later that his mother, his grandmother, his three year old sister, and his one year\nold baby brother had been snatched away from the house that day by -- by the Germans,\nput in a truck. They were sent to Auschwitz, and the day that they arrived, they were all\ngassed, all murdered. That was Eddie\u2019s background, and his family. He wound up in an\norphan home in -- Belgium had six or seven orphan homes that were set up by the -- by\nthe Judenrat, and with help of the Belgian Queen Mother, and the Germans knew about it.\nSo these children were really, I say, hostages of the Germans. But they were cared for,\nand taken care of, and Eddie had been one of them. He had, after the war, he had come to\nthe United States. He -- He went to an uncle of his in Manhattan, and -- and his\ngrandfather lived there, and it didn\u2019t work out. They were German Jews, and they\ncouldn\u2019t understand this boy who had, at one time, been found in the street, totally full of\nlice, and -- and full of wounds, and -- so Eddie was placed somewhere in New Jersey,\nwith people who were very good for him, and he went to -- he went to college, and he\ngraduated, very smart. Joined the American army -- was drafted into the American army,\nand of all places was sent to Germany, because he knew fluent German, and he knew\nFrench fluently, and English. And he worked for the adjutant general, or something like\nthat, in -- in -- in -- in Munchen, or so-someplace, interviewing Germans to see if they\nwere Nazis, and so on. He came back, and he invented a story about himself, he made an\nartificial life. The people didn\u2019t know that he was Jewish. He st -- He said that when\npeople asked about his parents, he said they had died in a car accident in Texas, and he\nhad had -- he had a sister somewhere, but also in Texas, and he hadn\u2019t seen her in years,\nand so on. He told me all this. His name was Eddie, like mine. Our birthdates happened\nto be the same, the eighth of May. And somehow another, I decided that I would adopt\nthis man. And I began to do what in Jewish we call mitzvahs, good deeds. I got him --\nfirst of all, I got him money. I helped him with everything he needed, as much as I could,\nand he became like a brother to me, and I was his brother, you know, I\u2019m the brother that\nhad died. And I took care of him as much as I could, for years. He went -- He had only\none leg, he had diabetes, and about a year after I met him, his other leg had to be\namputated, so now he had no legs at all, and he wanted to commit suicide, he had tried\nonce to commit suicide. Ha -- But he got a new apartment, a nice, clean apartment, and\nhe had electric wheelchair, which made him very happy. And I gi -- brought him gifts,\nand I brought him books, and I talked with him, and -- and I took him to Hidden Child\nmeetings in New York, on Purim, or you know. And he was here, we sat in this room\nwith him for Passover, to the seder, we invited him, and brought him with. Lot of trouble,\nalways, getting him with the wheelchair to there -- places. And we took him to\nWashington, I took him to Washington when the Hidden Children, our group from\nWestchester, went to the Holocaust museum, he wanted to go there, and you can\u2019t\nimagine what we went through, took Eddie in the wheelchair to -- to Washington. And\nFebruary, 1997, he died in front of the computer I had gotten him. He wanted to learn the\ncomputer, and he learned, and then he was suddenly dead, and he was gone. And it fell to\nme to take care of his stuff, little stuff that he had. And it fell to me, about a year ago, to\nput a -- to take care of his funeral, and then later to put a stone on -- on his grave. And I\ndecided that there was more to him than just -- more to his grave, and there should be\nmore to that grave, and I had a gra -- on the gravestone, I had a stonemason chisel that --\nsomething like, in this place -- let this place remember not only Eddie Strauss, whose\nname was really Abraham Katz, but also his mother, with her name, and his father, and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nhis sister Esther, and his little one year old brother. I put all their names on there, with the\ndates, all killed in Auschwitz. So that gravestone is nearby here, and I\u2019m very proud of\nthat, that at least that\u2019s the last thing I could do for Eddie. And I wanted to put that in, it\nwas also a part of my development after the war, as a -- an aware Jew, let me put it that\nway.\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nConclusion of Interview\n"

        "Answer: The -- Well, as you probably know, Holland was invaded in May 1940, when I\nlived with my father and my mother and my two brothers, who are eight and 10 years\nyounger than I -- than -- than I am, in a little town called Delft, in Holland. And my father\nwas all his life a musician, and had recently opened a little clothing store, to see if he\ncould get away from the -- th -- wi -- away from the music. On the 10\" of May, two days\nafter my 14\" birthday, the Germans suddenly -- I looked out the -- out the window, and\nthere was all German planes and paratroopers in the sky. And five days later, we were, of\ncourse -- the Dutch government ran away, the queen ran away to London, and we were an\noccupied country. And it didn\u2019t worry us too much, because the -- the war was going to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nbe over anyway very soon, we all knew that, and the Germans would never do in Holland\nwhat they had done in Germany, to the German Jews. But, pretty soon, of course, we\nbegan to find anti-Semitic ordinances in the -- in -- in the -- in the paper, and things\nprogressed rapidly. Two years later, 1942, after I couldn\u2019t go to school any more, and we\nwere all wearing yellow stars on our clothing, two years later, in October 23\", 1942, we\nwent into hiding. We were actually all set to go on the trains to what the Germans\neuphemistically called work relief, in Germany. We were all set, we had our backpacks\nready, but my grandfather, who happened to come over fo-for a visit from Amsterdam,\nwarned us that -- warned my parents that we -- we might not at all be going to work in\nGermany, that the Germans were lying, that there were rumors going around, and\nalthough no one knew where -- where we were yes going, he said don\u2019t ever go. It seems\nto have made a deep impression upon my parents, because at some point, they decided\nwe\u2019re not going to go on those trains, like most of the Jew -- Dutch Jews, and we were\ngoing to go into hiding, although we had no places prepared. So, as I said, on the 23 of\nOctober, 1942, we walked -- in the morning we walked out of our home, and never to\nreturn to that same house again. And that night my family spread around. My na -- They -\n- My -- My parents went one way, and my brothers went another way, I didn\u2019t know\nwhere they went. And I was left, for awhile, in that -- with our friends where we had\nwalked to, in the suburbs of Delft. I stayed there for a little while. And from there I went\nto -- first address in Utrecht, two old ladies who took me in, but very soon got scared, and\nI had to go. My mother, who 1s -- really became the -- the hero of this -- of our hiding\nstory -- of our wartime story in general, was the only one who traveled on trains, and she\nwent around finding places for all of us. She fou -- She decided that -- She suggested that\nI would bleach my hair and pretend to be a Christian boy, and work as a stable boy, s --\ngo find work on a sta -- as a stable boy on a Dutch farm. She then found a little farm\nsomewhere, little farmer who had five cows, dairy farm, and that\u2019s where I went to work.\nThat was my first farm, and it was absolute hell. I was this Jewish city kid, and I was\nsupposed to go out at five o\u2019clock in the morning, in the pouring rain, and -- and milk\ncows, and so, and I did. I -- I learned all that. I walked with bleeding feet 1-1n -- in\nwooden shoes, and -- very -- well, I don\u2019t know how long I was there. My guess is -- My\nguess is maybe -- oh, maybe -- maybe a half a year, I -- I\u2019m not quite sure. The\nchronology is sometimes a little difficult to follow, but anyway, I -- I decided to give\nmyself up to the Germans. I couldn\u2019t stand the -- the fear of being maybe discovered, and\nthe loneliness. I was all by myself. I was 16 years old, and I decided that I couldn\u2019t stay\nin there, I would give myself up. I figured, sooner or later, the Germans are going to find\nme anyway, and -- but my mother again, it\u2019s always my mother in this story, who came to\nvisit me sometimes, secretly, we would meet somewhere in the fields, talked me out of it,\nand said she would try and find another place for me. And she found, through a whole\nlong story that I can\u2019t go into now, but she found a police officer called Oskam, was his\nlast name, O-s-k-a-m, who ostensibly was a - was a Nazi Dutch police officer, came froma completely Nazi family, and -- but -- but -- in -- in reality was a member of the\nunderground, and was hiding about 30 Jewish men, women and children, in the little\nvillage not too far from Utrecht. And my mother had asked him if he would know a place\nfor me, and I talked with him, and he said, \u201cI have a place for you, but it\u2019s very\ndangerous. You will not be able to leave there, and you will not be able to see any\nmembers of your family. Do you still want to go there?\u201d And I said, well -- I figured\neverything was better -- anything was better than being isolated by myself on a farm. And\nhe -- when I said yes, I would like to go there, he took me to a -- a hut in the middle of\nthe woods, where he left me with seven Dutch Resistance men, mostly -- they were\nmostly of the -- what shall I say? The m -- More intellectual class o-of Dutch people.\nThey didn\u2019t look like what you would think of partisans, or anything, didn\u2019t wear\nmachine guns, or an-anything like that, but they had built this hut. And I stayed there\nfrom -- my guess is August 1943, until -- the exact date is 29\" of December, 1943. I was\nthe only Jew, I was the youngest, I was 16 - 17 then -- I was 17 years old then, and let\u2019s\nsee, the men would go out at night and raid police stations, and -- and ci-city halls, and --\nand break in and get identity claus -- get identity cards, and -- and official German\nstamps, and -- and weapons. And so we were sort of a center, people would stop in, a-and\ntake away weapons, and -- and -- and papers, and so on and so forth. I should go just --\nbecause it will relate to later on in this story, I should mention that one day two men were\nbrought in, one who claimed to be a Canadian, and one who claimed to be an\nEnglishman, and claimed to have been on a raid in -- in the -- in the Royal Air Force, on a\nra -- in on a raid to Germany, and were -- their bomber was shot down, and they bailed\nout, and they wound up in the -- and the Resistance got them before the Germans got\nthem, and they brought them into our hut. So here were these two men, and I was\nassigned to interview them, because I spoke English well. I don\u2019t quite know why, but I\nthink I have a hint of why. My parents had lived in the United States for three years, in\n1929 to 1932. So I interviewed these men, and found out that they were not German\nspies, but they were a bona fide RAF people. They w -- They -- They spent awhile with\nus in the hut, but eventually they were smuggled out by the Resistance, through Belgium,\nthrough France, and Spain, and I guess Portugal, and -- and smuggled back to England. I\ndon\u2019t know if they ever flew again, I will find that out in -- in August. There\u2019s a --\nThere\u2019s a story connected with that. On the tr -- In December, towards the end of the --\n1943, we got a message, somehow another, an intercepted message that the Germans had\nbecome suspicious of the -- of the area, the woods where we were. We were -- We were\nin the -- in the middle of a small parcel of woods. In Holland, you don\u2019t really have\nforests. These were planted parcels of woods, rectangles, one after another, about four or\nfive, and they had the very dense undergrowth of evergreens. You couldn\u2019t walk through\nthem, you would have to smash your way through -- through the undergrowth, however,\nwe had a secret path to the hut. As I said, in December, the men in the hut got the\nmessage that the Germans had become suspicious, and we were -- they then decided we\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nshould set out guards, and so a companion and I drew the lot for the 29\" of December, I\nthink four to eight A.M. watch, standing right inside the periphery of the -- in the woods.\nNow, on the -- on the -- on the woods, in -- within the first line of trees, and that\u2019s where\nwe saw the Germans coming, in the half dark, and it was, of course, traumatic, because I\nrealized they had come to kill me. I was very tempted to run away, I didn\u2019t. The both of\nus ran back into the hut, warned the men. There was a total confusion there, cause they\nwere sleeping in the bunkbeds, and we pulled the blankets off them, and shouted, \u201cIt\u2019s a\nraid, get up.\u201d And when -- when we saw that they were all out of the bunkbeds, we ran,\nand we ran to the edge of our parcel of wood -- of woods, and as I always say when I --\nwhen -- when -- when I looked to the left and to the right, it seemed to me the Germans\nwere coming around the corners of the woods, and I feared that nobody that we had left\nbehind, would survive. We then jumped across the dirt road, into the next parcel of\nwoods, and crashed through, and we ran and ran and ran and ran, until we wound up in a\ncity called Hilversum, which you probably have heard about, it\u2019s the center of Dutch\nradio -- radio transmitter. And I can\u2019t go into the details now, but somehow another, we\nwound up at night in the woods again, about five miles away from where the hut was,\nbecause that was the spot where we were supposed to reassemble in case of a raid. It had\nbeen previously agreed upon. And my buddy and I, my -- my partner and I waited there\nin the dark. We had guns, we had nine millimeter Mauser, and we had them at the ready,\nbecause we didn\u2019t know if the men would have been tortured to reveal the place that the\nGermans would -- might come and -- and ser -- I had pretty well decided then that -- that\nif they would come, that I would defend myself, I would -- I would try to kill, and be\nkilled, probably, in a short gunfight. So, I was all prepared to die. It was very quiet, and\nthen after awhile I did hear some noise coming through the woods, sounded like old\nmetal rattling away, and thumping over -- wh-wheels on the dirt, and this bicycle rattled\nin the little clearing, and with a little flashlight somebody was shining ahead of it. And\nwe didn\u2019t know who it was, we were ready to -- to -- to shoot. But nothing followed, and\nthen we approached with drawn guns, and found out that it was not the Germans, and it\nwas neither one of the men, it was my mother, who had heard about the raid, and had\ndecided immediately to rescue us. Well, I think most of that escape, and so on, and my\nmother\u2019s part in that is probably in the -- in the video interview. We escaped. My buddy -\n- My mother gave the old bicycle to my -- my friend, my -- my partner, and she gave him\nalso the little flashlight, and he peddled away into the darkness, he said he knew a place\nwhere to hide. And my mother and I pretended to be lovers, and as we approached the\nGerman guard, we talked very loud, and we giggled, and we -- you know, with -- with\nterror in our hearts, but we put our arms around each other, and we made kissing sounds,\nand the -- and the German guard whom we approached seemed to want to stop us for a\nsecond, but he didn\u2019t, and we walked by him, and as I always say, to live another day in\n[indecipherable] of that circle of death. After that I was close to a nervous breakdown, I\nneeded help. Two -- Two older people, two Dutch people who lived in a very nicemansion, put me up in a room, very peaceful room overlooking a gorgeous garden, and\nthere I s -- recuperated slowly, I stopped shaking, and I became very religious, I found a\nBible, and for the first time read something about the Jewish history, and became devoted\nto it, and for the rest of the war, tried to be a religious Jew. When I felt strong enough\nagain, I left that place, and I got myself a new pair of wooden shoes, and I went out and\nfound a new farm, now in a better part of Holland. And in the more eastern part, where\nthe farms are bigger, and the people are [indecipherable] and I started to work this time as\na real farmhand. By then I seemed to have had enough experience to work with horses,\nand plow, and -- and of course I had bleached my hair again, and matter of fact, I had the\nchutzpah to go and register myself with my false identity card in -- in the town hall, to\nallay suspicion. It worked pretty well, I -- I wasn\u2019t -- I worked on a couple of farms. The\nfarmers were happy with me. Of course, every second was always a challenge if anyone\napproached the farm. It was like, this is maybe it. In May, 1944, my mother, coming back\non the train from visiting my brother Fred, my youngest brother who was sick, was -- she\nhad managed to put in a hospital in the south of Holland. On the way back, she ran into a\nexpert on the train, German -- a Gestapo expert on the train, zeesha hites a deest expert,\nprobably, and he immediately recognized that she had a falsified identity card, and he\narrested her. And she -- And he put her into a -- into a separate compartment in the train,\nwhere she was guarded by a Dutch policeman on the way to Amsterdam, and that she\nlater tells him -- I\u2019m not quite sure any more at this point, by the way, let me interrupt\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nmyself here for a second. I\u2019m not quite sure how much of this is in the videotape. I\u2019m not\nquite sure. I\u2019m quoting here things that my mother and my father said in interviews\nconducted -- audio interviews conducted by my brother Fred. My brother Fred conducted\naudio interviews with the whole family, my father, my mother, myself, my brother Ott,\nmy cousins, my wife. I have a tray with audio interviews, with the voices of my parents\nand everyone, and he later also transcribed it in book form, together with his son. Now,\nall that, I think happened after the Holocaust Memorial Museum interview. So, I don\u2019t\nknow, you can ask me later on it -- if it\u2019s not clear, I can go back to it. As my mother said\n-- now I go back to what my mother as -- she was arrested, as my mother later on told in\ninterview with my brother Fred, she ate all the paperwork that was in her -- in her\nhandbag, so the -- so that there was -- sh -- and she swallowed it. So by the time that she\ngot to the interrogation in Amsterdam, when they ask her what her real name was, she\nlied, and she said that her name was Angeline Elizabeth Van Leer, which was her maiden\nname. She never mentioned her -- her married name. And since she didn\u2019t have any other\npapers, except her false identity card, they wrote it down, and as she said, a-as a -- out of\nthe blue sky she added, \u201cAnd you have no right to keep me here, because I\u2019m an\nAmerican citizen.\u201d I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s in the -- in the video interview, either. In any\ncase, she was sent to -- to Westerbork, Dutch camp, and from there she was sent to\nBergen-Belsen, which we didn\u2019t know, of course. When I somehow heard that my mother\nhad been arrested, I found my father and my two little brothers in a little cottage together,in the -- not too far from Arnhem, in Holland, where -- that little cottage my mother had\nrented just before she was arrested, in order to be a -- a -- just a week together with her\nhusband and her two little sons. And of course, for her this didn\u2019t work out, but my father\nhad gone there, and my two little brothers were there, and I found them there, and I\ndecided that rather than work on the farm, my father would need help to survive in hiding\nwith my two little brothers. So I quit the farm, and bicycled over to this little cottage, and\nthat\u2019s where we spent the last winter of the war. Together with my two brothers and my\nfather, we begged, borrowed and stole whatever we could to survive, and thus we reached\nthe spring of 1945, when we were liberated by the Canadian army, and where -- I really\nshould say this part of your interview ends, because it was the end of the war. Many\nsurprising things happened after that. If you want me to just go on with this now, or do\nyou want to take a break\u2019?",
        "A: It\u2019s very interesting question, and -- and as I go out speaking a lot to schools and so\non, that question always comes up, people ask, \u201cHow did you know where your father\nwas?\u201d An-And I usually don\u2019t have an answer for this. I can tell you this, I did not know\nin the very beginning where my father and mother were, until the raid on the hut, when I\nspent one night after the raid, after my mother and I escaped out of that -- out of the\nwoods there, I spent one night at their hi -- their hiding place, which was in Soest, in\nHolland. So then I knew where they were. My brothers, I never knew. But there was a\nlittle time, which I don\u2019t remember too clearly, when my brother Ott, my middle brother,\ns -- came to the farm where I worked, and this was my little brother who came from the\ncity, and who needed to be fattened up a little bit, and -- of course, he was also in hiding,\nbut -- and he spent some time with me on this farm, I don\u2019t know how long. From --\nFrom his interview later on, I -- I deducted he was there at least three weeks, or maybe\neven a month. I thought it was only a week. So, that period, I knew where my brother Ott\nwas, he was with me. But then he disappeared again, and of course, from the fall of 1944,\nuntil the liberation 1945, my father, my two brothers and I were all together. Some of the\ncommunication was achieved through my grandfather\u2019s second wife. My grandfather\nlived in Amsterdam, my grandmother had died years before, he marred a non-Jewish\nwoman, and had a daughter by her. And I| think that daughter, who was not Jewish, at\nleast she was half Jewish, did not wear a star, and traveled, and I think she managed to\nsend some messages around, and I think it must have been through her that I found where\nmy father and my two little brothers were hiding in that little summer cottage. That\u2019s as\nbest as I can tell you. Course we had no phones, we didn\u2019t write letters, was -- we\ncouldn\u2019t. And -- So sometimes it -- I just -- it\u2019s all conjecture, you know?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: The minute that we went underground, of course, we were isolated from the rest of the\npopulation of the world, you could say. But here and there, you would pick up an illegal\npiece of newspaper. You know, there were -- there were illegal newspapers that consisted\nusually out of two or four pages, badly printed, and sometimes you would find -- find\none of those, or somebody would ha-hand you one of those. During my time in the\nResistance hut, of course I found out more, because the men listened to the BBC, and we\nhad a map there, and we charted the progress of the Russians and whatever else was\nhappening. And we knew about the -- the bombardments in Germany and so on. So, at\nthat time, I was pretty well aware of where the -- where the Germans stood, and where\nthe Russians were, and where the English were, and the Americans, and so on, and so\nforth. But after the raid, when I went back to the farm, I was totally isolated. The farmers\nhad -- they would talk about the war, but they -- they didn\u2019t know what was going on.\nWhat we could see were, of course, a thousand B17 bombers flying over almost every\nday, and by night we heard the English, a thousand planes going overnight. We knew\nthere was enormous bombardments. And I had several interesting -- interesting\nhappenings at one time. A liberator bomber came down right around the corner from the\nfarm where I worked, and that was the time my brother Ott was there, it seems, because\nhe, in detail, describes how that plane came down, and how we ran there, and -- and how\nwe found a little piece of -- of Plexiglas, little piece of -- from one of the -- one of the\nwindows of the bomber, or the -- we -- we savored it like a piece of -- this was a piece of\nfreedom. That was one. On another farm -- this must have been already in the summer of\n\"44, a Messerschmitt 109 was shot down, and crashed right into the ground, right near by\nthe farm where I worked, there\u2019s -- there was another farm. And I don\u2019t where I had the\nchutzpah, that I -- I was devoted to flying and -- and planes before the war, already. I\nloved planes, and build model planes. Anything that would -- flew was to me, was\nfascinating. And here was a Messerschmitt 109 lying pretty much undamaged except for\nit\u2019s gear and so on. I-It\u2019s propeller bent, and -- and there was a German on guard there,\njust a soldier guarding the -- the plane there. And I approached on bike, and I asked him\nif I could take a look, and he said, yeah, that\u2019s all right, and I actually walked around the\nGod damn plane, and touched it, and [indecipherable] all fascinating. How did I get onto\nthat? Oh, you asked me about what I knew about the war. During our ha -- last hiding,\nwith my two brothers and my father, in the little summer cottage, we found out nearby,\nabout a five minute walk through the fields, there was a big mansion type house, and in\nthat house lived a whole collection of people, young and old. Later on, we found that\nseveral of them were in hiding themselves. But, they listened every day to the BBC radio.\nSo, some might say the fall of 1944, until the liberation, we knew pretty well what was\ngoing on because of the evening -- in the evening we would go there, and we wouldn\u2019t\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nlisten ourselves, but somebody would go up and listen in the attic, where they had a radio\nhidden, and they would tell us, \u201cThe Russians are right near Berlin,\u201d you know, \u201cand the\n-- the invasion is going well.\u201d By this time, of course, the sixth of June, 1944, the allied\ninvasion of France, we knew it was happening. And then, of course, we had gone to\nArnhem, which was not too far away, the disastrous attempt from the English to -- with\nparatroopers to capture the bridges, and being wiped out, and we thought we would be\nfree then. So anyway, that much we knew. Arnhem, we didn\u2019t know the disaster,\nalthough it was only a half an hour away from us, we heard all --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: The very first place, two old ladies, knew I was Jewish. The next one on the farm, the\nfirst farm, dairy farm, they did not know. In the Resistance hut, of course they knew I\nwas a Jew, and weren\u2019t too happy about it, by the way. After the Resistance hut, when I\nstarted going back to farming, on several farms, I registered as a -- as a -- as an Christian.\nAnd then we come to -- there are little pieces in between that I don\u2019t even want to go --\nwhere I was a week , or I was a week and a half, or two weeks. I was with my aunt in The\nHague for -- for two weeks or something, and of course she knew was -- I was Jewish,\nbut -- and then we come to the fall of 1944, when I joined my father and my two brothers,\nand there\u2019s no question, of course, there. So, the only places where people didn\u2019t know\nthat I -- that I was Jewish, was on the farms where I worked.",
        "A: Especially in the beginning. Not for me later on, I found -- after the raid on the hut, I\nfound my own farms. I was -- I would say I worked there, and w -- I\u2019m not quite sure\nwhy I left to go from one farm to another. I probably thought that it was safer to not stay\ntoo long in one place. It\u2019s very hard to explain the intensity of -- of the deceit you had to\npractice. Your -- Your whole mind was set on deceit. What -- What hint could a farmer,\nlet\u2019s say, get from me that I was not who I said I was, you know. Wa -- My -- My mind\nwas constantly at work, so that I probably decided that it was not a good idea to stay too\nlong in one place, because eventually something escapes.",
        "A: I\u2019m not quite sure at this point. See, this was a 24 hour a day, seven days a week\ncomedy you played. This is like being on stage, practically 24 hours a day, every day,\neven when y -- when you went to sleep, you had to watch out that somebody wouldn\u2019t\nhear you dreaming, or something, and say something. I had a false name. I might, by\nmistake, whisper my own name in my sleep or something, or s -- tell about my mother. I\ndidn\u2019t have a mother, you know, and the mother and father had died years ago in\nbombardments, both of them. I mean, the stories that you made up, to -- in order t -- tho -\n- it was a whole -- 1 -- this was a whole false lifetime of history. Where did you come\nfrom, did you have family? Where did you live? How come you\u2019re working on a farm?\nYou\u2019re from the city. How come you work so well? You know. Why -- We\u2019ve had city\nboys here, they -- they never worked that well, they didn\u2019t know how to go plow a field\nwith a horse. How come you know? You know, this kind of stuff, and what is he\nthinking? Is he talking with his neighbors about this guy we have from the city, who\nworks so well?",
        "A: That I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. You see, in Holland, a Jew would stand out like a --\nhow do I say that? A mouse on a billiard table. I could instantly recognize if I saw\nanother Jew someplace in Holland. And I\u2019ve seen some on the -- on the railroad station,\nonce, when I was waiting for my mother to show up, and -- and I saw a man, and I\nimmediately recognized this guy is -- is a hidden Jew, you know. So, I thought, why\ndon\u2019t the other recognize me, maybe, you know? The -- The skill and deception was like\n-- it was like a spy story, spy who could construct a whole false -- false background, you\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nknow? It was like -- And you had to make sure that you didn\u2019t slip up anywhere, not a\nstreet address, not where you were 10 years ago, not where your father and mother had\ndied. You know, you know, this kind -- not show any dislike of big chunks of -- of bacon,\nor ham being put on your -- you know, not the nice bacon that we get, with slices like a\nhalf inch thick, you know, it\u2019s with all the fat on it, and farmers gleefully ate. And I ate\nthem, and I said in my head, I said -- asked God for forgiveness that I had to do this. But\nall that was a -- it\u2019s like being onstage, and it\u2019s very, very tiresome, you know? So\nanyway, it\u2019s hard to -- very hard to explain what -- what it took to stay out of the clutches\nof the Germans. And I -- There was a second time when I almost -- almost got caught.\nThe first time was, of course, the raid on the hut, second one was later on when my --\nwhen we all lived in that little cottage, and I -- we went every day to get some food in the\nvillage. There was a central kitchen then, food being scarce, and all that. And all of a\nsudden I ran into a German on this dirt road leading to the village. I was on this crummy\nbicycle that we had, and -- and this German stopped me, and wanted to see my identity\ncard. I was lucky, he was -- I th -- I have no idea w-what he was. You see, this is another\npart, to immediately gauge, if you saw a German, what kind of a German is this? Is this\njust a -- a -- Wehrmacht soldier? He doesn\u2019t know shit from shinola, you know, he\ndoesn\u2019t know about Jews, or identity cards. But, I once ran into an SS man, and that\u2019s a\nseparate story. But -- But this guy questioned me, and I couldn\u2019t figure out -- he was not\nSS, he didn\u2019t have the SS on his -- on his collar, and yet, he seemed to intensely question\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nme, you know? And I just said that I lived -- that I was a farmer\u2019s [indecipherable] farmer\nhere down the road. I was on -- on a -- and could see him swaying back and forth. But\nwhat the hell he would have done, I have no idea, because this was -- we\u2019re talking now,\nprobably late fall 1944, when -- when everything was already in disarray for the\nGermans. Any case, that was a moment when everything sort of tightened up, and you\nstood there, and you said, is it going to go right, or is it going to go wrong? Is this the last\n-- is this it? You know? And it wasn\u2019t, but it was almost. Okay, I don\u2019t know if I\nanswered your question, but --",
        "A: Yes, he did.",
        "A: My father was an interesting man, he -- he was a kind of an ineffective man, 1 -- that --\nand my mother always held him up as the artist in the family, and she was the one who\ntook care of everything. Even -- I mean, after the war, before the war, she was the driving\nfactor, sort of, in -- in -- you know, getting everything done. But here they were, these\ntwo people, in a room, for two and a half years. You ever sat in a room for two and a half\nyears without going out? It\u2019s not easy. And he began to do sketches, put little still lifes on\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthe table, or -- and then he started painting with watercolors a little bit, and pastels, and\nmy mother got him art materials, and it was a God given thing, you know, cause he\nwould have gone crazy there. And then, through somehow another, they found this\npainter -- I have a painting of him [indecipherable] upstairs. I have several painting of my\nfather, and also of his teacher. Found this teacher where he went once a week. I didn\u2019t\nwant to go into the details about it, but I told you about the raid on the hut, and that my\nmother came to rescue us in the woods. The reason why she knew was, when my buddy\nand I ran off from the raid, we wound up in the city of Hilversum, I remember that my\nfather took painting lessons from a man named Shlutter, a painter, well-known painter in\n-- in -- in Holland. And that this man lived in a village near Hilversum, where we were,\nand I decided that -- we didn\u2019t know where the hell to go, that I would to this Shlutter,\nbecause obviously he was all right, he was somebody we could trust, because he gave my\nfather painting lessons. It so happened when we -- we took a little train there, a little -- a\nlittle sht -- a little -- little -- a -- a s-- a tram, and it so happened when we got there, my\nfather was there, painting, you know, very quiet in the studio of this man. And my father\nsaid, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d And my father never was very perceptive in things, and\nI told him, \u201cPop, we were raided,\u201d you know? \u201cAnd I think all the men probably are --\nare going to be dead.\u201d And he said, \u201cGee, gee, hm.\u201d But he didn\u2019t interrupt his lesson or\nanything. And he said, \u201cSo where you going to be today?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, we don\u2019t know,\nwe're,\u201d -- and I don\u2019t know where we were all day, until we wound up in the woods that\nnight. But one thing is for sure, my father eventually went back to his hiding place, and\ntold my mother, and my mother immediately grasped the seriousness of the situation. My\nfather didn\u2019t. And she -- how she found out, I don\u2019t know, I think probably to Mr.\nOskam, the policeman, where the hell we would meet that night. So my father painted,\nand my mother -- and my mother took care of the -- tried to save the rest of her family,\nand did, and saved herself, too, of which I will tell you. But his -- his glor-glory period\ncame when we were all hiding in that little cottage, from the fall of 1944, until the\nliberation, 1945. He became a real strong father, you could almost say a brother to me.\nHe and I took care of the boys, and ourselves. But he and I decided what -- how to find\nfood, where to steal trees, you know. Where to beg for sandwiches from the farmers, or\nsomething, anything. It was like a team. When my father died, probably about 10 years\nago, or so, I really felt like one of our team had died, you know? He shouldn\u2019t have died,\nwe should have all died together, my two brothers, my father, and I, we were a team, a\nwonderful team of -- that managed to survive. And my father died, of course he died, but\nit was like losing a member of a string quartet, you know, and say God, you know,\nirreplaceable. Anyway, so I have many funny stories about my father. My father mostly\nis known in the family for his funny stories, because he did so many things out of -- I\ndon\u2019t know, re -- because he didn\u2019t -- he wasn\u2019t aware. My wife always says, \u201cYour\nfather never was aware.\u201d My father wasn\u2019t aware of what the hell was going on. Hewasn\u2019t even aware that I was in -- wa -- you know, wa -- my life was threatened when I\nwas there, you know, with my buddy. So, I hope that answers that question, maybe.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t understand that. What did you say?",
        "A: That\u2019s probably -- probably so, yeah. He\u2019s an interesting man, I was never very close\nto him, except for that period then. I could tell you for hours about him, but I don\u2019t think\nthis is the place to do it. He -- He tried all his life to not be a musician, and yet, he only\nwas a musician, he always went back to it. And after the war, when we moved to -- or\nwhen they moved to Springfield, Massachusetts, my father really had -- I said, well, his\nonly glory period was during the war, that isn\u2019t quite true. After they moved to\nSpringfield, Massachusetts, and my father began to play in the Springfield Symphony,\nand he played in the Hartford Symphony, he was a cellist, and he set up a string quartet\nwith friends, and they gave concerts in -- in Pittsfield, in the Fine Arts Museum, those\nwere glorious times for him, because he loved music. So -- But during the war, and of\ncourse, I don\u2019t know all of it, because they were in hiding, my father and mother together,\nand somehow another -- I think my father probably had an easier time of it than my\nmother, because he could lose himself for hours in sketching a glass of water, and -- anda little jar, you know? I have many of his sketchbooks still upstairs. So, where do we go\nfrom here?",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: All right. I may duplicate some of it that was in the -- oh no, I ge -- I don\u2019t know\nwhere the original video -- video interview ended.",
        "A: When we were liberated?",
        "A: Nothing after that?",
        "A: Very little. All right, the first thing I have to tell you about 1s -- its\u2019 a little bit difficult,\nthe structure is a little bit different. I must first tell you about what happened to my\nmother, because it -- then I can go back to -- to us. My mother, as I said, was sent to\nBergen-Belsen. And interestingly enough, she had a -- she had a dream -- my mother was\nalways a little psychic, by the way, very interesting. There were times that she would say\nto my father, \u201cI think your father is maybe coming for a visit from Amsterdam today.\u201d\nAnd I don\u2019t know, three out of five times, there was my grandfather in the afternoon, youknow, ringing the doorbell. So we always thought she was, what we call in Dutch,\nhelderzingda, clear -- clear voyant -- clairvoyant. She had a dream. I think -- I think it\nwas in Westerbork, in the Dutch camp. She had a dream in which she saw a newspaper, a\nmasthead of a newspaper, and that said, January 21, very big, and she woke up from it.\nAnd she thought, \u201cI wonder what that means, if it means something.\u201d And she thought,\n\u2018Either I will be dead by then, or I will be free.\u201d But then, how could she be free? I mean,\nshe was in a concentration camp in Holland, and soon after that, she was sent to Bergen-\nBelsen. And one day in January, a friend of hers, who she slept with in the same\nbunkbed, you know, the wooden bunkbeds they had there, said, \u201cYou know, Lene,\u201d she\nwas always called Lene, from -- from Angeline, \u201cLene,\u201d she said, \u201cthere is an SS guy\nsitting in -- in the barracks, and he\u2019s checking on people who have foreign nationality.\u201d\nAnd my mother said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have foreign nationality.\u201d And her friend said, \u201cBut\nyeah, you said when you were interrogated in Amsterdam, you told him you don\u2019t have\nany right to keep me here, because I am an American citizen?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said my mother,\n\u2018so what? You know, I don\u2019t have any papers. I\u2019m not really an American.\u201d Okay, I got\nto go back, I got to b-backtrack, got to backtrack for a second to the interrogation in May\n1944, when she was caught in Amsterdam, in front of the Gestapo there.\n[indecipherable]. They asked her what\u2019s your name, and I told you she gave her maiden\nname, Angeline Elizabeth Van Leer, and as an afterthought they said -- she said, \u201cAnd\nyou don\u2019t have any right to keep me here, because I am an American citizen.\u201d And they\nasked her, \u201cIf you\u2019re an American citizen, where did you live in the United States? Give\nus an address.\u201d And she rattled off 121 LaMartine Street, Jamaica Plains, Boston. And\nit\u2019s a wonderful thing, because it was one of the addresses where we had lived in 1929,\nwhen my parents for three years, emigrated from Holland to the United States. It was a\nlousy year to come to the States, 1929, my father got sick, he got tuberculosis, and so on,\neverything went wrong. In 1932 they returned again to Holland. But they did live at 121\nLaMartine Street, Jamaica Plains, Boston, and my mother remembered it, and rattled it\noff in front of the Gestapo, and they wrote it down. They must have laughed, but they\nwrote it down. So, now we go back to Bergen-Belsen, and it\u2019s January 1945, and things\nare really getting bad in Bergen-Belsen. I -- Sorry, I have to s-suddenly think of S-\nSpiegelman\u2019s, \u201cMaus Two,\u201d which bears the title -- when his father arrives in Bergen-\nBelsen, either from Auschwitz, or wherever he came from, some horror, comes to\nBergen-Belsen, and says, \u201cAnd here\u2019s where my troubles really began.\u201d It\u2019s -- It\u2019s tragic,\nbut it\u2019s funny. Anyway, my mother came to Bergen-Belsen, and here\u2019s where our\ntroubles really began. Sh -- Her friend said, \u201cGo to this S -- SS guy.\u201d My mother said,\n\u201cWhy, ba, ba.\u201d Says, \u201cGo, go, go anyway. So what do you have to lose?\u201d So she went to\nthis barracks, there was an SS guy sitting, and he was just closing the books, and sh -- he\nsaid, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d And she said, \u201cWell, I hear you\u2019re checking on people with\nforeign papers?\u201d And he said, \u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I just finished.\u201d And she begged him\nto open the book again, and he opened the list again, and he said, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\nAnd she said, \u201cAngeline Elizabeth Van Leer.\u201d And he went down the list and he said,\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d he said, \u201cyou get yourself ready, and two days from n-now, you will be -- you\nwill be exchanged for a German.\u201d And she didn\u2019t believe a word for it -- of it, you know?\nBut two days later, there was a train standing. There was not a railroad spur into Bergen-\nBelsen camp, as you may ha -- may know, but there was -- people had to walk for two\nmiles outside of the camp to -- to Bergen-Belsen, or Belsen-Bergen station, whatever it\nwas. And there was a train standing there with a big red cross on it, and she went in there\nwith 301 other Bergen-Belsen inmates, and as she came in -- she tells this all later on, I\u2019m\nre -- I\u2019m retelling now what she told to my brother Fred in interviews later on. She said\nthere was an SS sitting there at a little table, and she said, \u201cCould I have a little water?\nI\u2019m very thirsty.\u201d She had been walking. And he said, \u201cSit down, you\u2019re going to get\ncoffee soon.\u201d And of course, she didn\u2019t believe a word of that, either, but a little later, a\nnurse came in with a tray with real coffee, whi -- nobody had seen in years. And then she\nbegan to believe that maybe it wasn\u2019t a ruse, you know? What they used to do to\nGermans wa -- load 1,000 people in the train, promising them to go to -- you know, be\nfreed, and they, you know, two days later, they\u2019d be all gassed in Auschwitz, or Sobibor.\nSo that train really started out and went through -- was very secure, there\u2019s a route --\nroute through Germany, and my mother later on says very gleefully, they all saw the\nbombed out cities of Germany. We\u2019re talking now January 1945, of course. We\u2019re\napproaching the end of the war. And that train would up in, I forget, Saint Dollan, I thinkshe mentioned. It\u2019s in Switzerland. And they came in on one side of the -- of the\nplatform, and -- an-and another train came on the other side, and they were exchanged for\nGermans. And I got to tell you the rest of this, because otherwise what I tell you later\nmakes no sense. The first night, they spent, sh -- this is a footnote to the Swiss treatment\nof dying -- 300 s -- terribly sick and dying Bergen-Belsen inmates. They put them in an\nabandoned school building on straw, and for the few -- first meal, my mother said, \u201cThey\ngave us white bread, and cans of sardines.\u201d And she said -- she couldn\u2019t help herself, she\nsaid she opened the can of sardines and poured the oil in the sardines over the white\nbread, and just ate and ate and ate. And she said, \u201cI never was as sick in the camp as I\nwas that night.\u201d And finally she found some relief in the morning by throwing up. It was\na terrible night, she said. She\u2019d never been so sick in all those -- in all her -- all her time\nin -- in the -- in the camps, or in hiding. And it got to be morning, and the others were\nstill asleep, I think, and a little boy came by, and she had been in camp, and hadn\u2019t -- did\nnot know what was happening in the world. And she asked the boy if it was possible to\nget a newspaper somewhere, and he said he could, and he ran off, and he came back with\na newspaper, a Swiss newspaper, and she opened it. It said January 21\u2018, and she was free.\nNow magical things, you know? That\u2019s amazing. My mother was a pretty amazing\nperson. Anyway, the train went on, or another train, and they wound up in Marseilles, and\nthere she was given a choice. She could go either to her sister in Massachusetts, or she\ncould go to Palestine. And she decided she -- and the third choice was she could go to\nUnited Nations rehabilitation camp someplace. And she decided she\u2019d go to her sister in\nMassachusetts, and for there there was a -- a ship lying there, the Gripsholm,\nScandinavian ship. And that was transporting wounded American soldiers. And she was\nalready on board of the ship, and then suddenly she changed her mind, and she ran off,\nand one of the officers there said, \u201cYou can\u2019t do this, you already,\u201d -- but sh -- he could\nnever impress my mother, and she ran off the -- off the ship, and said she changed her\nmind, she wanted to go to rehabilitation camp, United Nations camp. And so they put her\non another boat, and I think they traveled for a whole week over the Mediterranean, I\ndon\u2019t know why it took so damn long, but she finally wound up in a United Nations\nrehabilitation camp called Jeandark, which was located in Philipville, in Algiers, North\nAfrica. That\u2019s where she stayed until the end of the war. Now, okay, we\u2019ll leave her\nthere, sitting there, safe. Go back to Forthausen, where we were in hiding in the little\ncottage, and we are a couple of weeks liberated, and I could tell you many stories, I don\u2019t\nknow how long you want to do this interview. I could tell you a funny -- I think I really\nshould tell you this story, cause it is so funny. The Canadians came, and we spent three\ndays in a dugout shelter, until -- under a fierce artillery bombardment, and then we came\nout, and we were free, and the Canadians settled all around us in camps, and there were\ntanks there, and God knows, and it was -- it was wonderful. But we didn\u2019t have anything\nmuch more to eat, so my father went -- and we had been making something that was\ncalled coffee, but it was made out of ground up shells of -- of -- what do you call that\nfruit that comes from a oak tree?",
        "A: Acorns, ground up acorn shells. It was horrible stuff. My father went and persuaded\nthe Canadian cook in one of the camps that this was the best stuff, and he exchanged it\nfor three cans of corned beef, or something, which we hadn\u2019t seen in years. And so --\nAnd we went into the woods, and we found in -- we found in -- a German mortar, and\nwith the ammunition, and we went and sold that to the Canadians for -- for sugar and tea,\nand -- anyway, but -- oh no, not for sugar, for tea, an-an-and -- and bread, and -- but we\ndidn\u2019t have any sugar. So my father peddled on this old little bike into town, and he saw\nthere was a detachment of military police, huge guys, as he explained to them, broad\nshoulders, and they had these enormous gloves, and they had Harley-Davidson\nmotorcycles with MP on it. These were tough bastards, you know? And my father went\nup to -- to one of them, [indecipherable] already, went up to one of them, and said, \u201cSir,\nwould you have some sugar for us? We -- We\u2019ve been -- hadn\u2019t had any sugar.\u201d Guy was\na redhead, with a red moustache, as my father ex -- described him. The guy said, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s\nthe matter with you, begging around here? Say, you a Jew?\u201d My father -- this is after two\nand a half years of not being a Jew, he said, \u201cNo, no, no, no, I\u2019m not a Jew. I,\u201d -- you\nknow -- he says, \u201cNo, I just need -- wanted some sugar.\u201d He said, \u201cGet the hell out of\nhere.\u201d And my father went -- left him. The next day he happened to be in town again, and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthey were breaking up. The whole first division Canadian army was pulling through the\nvillage. Endless, you know, miles and miles of -- of kitchens, and tanks, and carriers, and\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: All right, this little story when my father came back into the village, and saw the\nmilitary police unit breaking up, and he went up again, to the redhead guy, who was just\nabout getting on his huge Harley-Davidson motorcycle, and revving up the engine, and\nmy father said -- and the guy said, \u201cAre you here again?\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d said my father. \u201cI\nwondered if you left behind any sugar.\u201d The guy said, \u201cI asked you yesterday, are you a\nJew?\u201d And my father said, \u201cNo, no, I told you I\u2019m not a Jew.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cyou see,\nI\u2019m Jewish. I would have given you sugar if you were a Jew, but I don\u2019t give to any\ngoyim.\u201d And he roared off on his motorcycle. Ah, this is a lovely, lovely story. You --\nYou got to realize that my family is a story telling family, both my brothers, and my\nfather, and I, we all tell stories, and we remember them. So, our whole family is suffused\nwith stories, and this is -- this is a -- a cutie from -- from the war. Anyway -- from right\nafter the war. Okay, get -- let\u2019s get serious again. A couple of weeks after our liberation,\nmy father tells me, he said, \u201cYou know, they told me in Barnfeld,\u201d -- a little town nearby,\n\u201cthere are Some men -- some men who have lists, and they take care of -- of -- of -- of --\nof our Jewish people.\u201d That was all he knew, you know. So he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to go\nthere, find out about mutter,\u201d the Dutch word for mother, we always called her mutter. I\nsaid, \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d And he rattled off on this old bike, and th -- and -- and by that time, I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nal-always keep on talking about rattling bikes. You see, we didn\u2019t have any air tires any\nmore. Tires were made then either out of wooden strips, very cleverly, wound around\nwith steel wire around the rim, or if you were a little bit better, old car tires were stripped,\nthe rubber -- solid rubber was then wound around, and so -- but you can imagine, within\nabout a month, everything rattled loose on your bike, so they always rattled. Anyway, my\nfather set off, and he went to Barnfeld, and as he -- and now I\u2019 Il have to quote him,\nbecause he tells this later, also in the interview, he -- he -- he reaches Barnfeld, and he\ngoes there into a building, and behind a rickety table, he find three older -- older men,\nyeah, three older, Jewish men, and the -- and they said, \u201cCan we help you?\u201d And as -- he\nsaid, \u201cYes,\u201d he said, and -- and I\u2019m trying to express this as naive as we were still. My\nfather says, \u201cYes, my -- my wife was -- was arrested, and she was in -- in -- in\nWesterbork, in a camp, and then she was sent somewhere to Germany, I would like to\nfind out where she is.\u201d So they said, \u201cWell, you\u2019re in luck, because we don\u2019t know\nanything right now,\u201d he said, \u201cbut s -- one of a -- one of our men is in Germany, and he 1s\ncoming back with all the lists, and where everybody is.\u201d And we\u2019re talking about 110,000\nDutch Jews, shipped out. And my father said, \u201cOh, thank you. Ill be back in a week.\u201d\nAnd a week later -- And he tells this to me when he comes back to our little hut, we\u2019re\nstill living in that little cottage, not a hut, a cottage. And a week later, he goes again. And\nas he tells it later, he said, \u201cThere I saw the three men again,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they weren\u2019t\nthe same.\u201d He said physically they were the same, but mentally they were completely\nbeaten down. They said, \u201cMr. Lessing, we have just found out about concentration\ncamps, and there were gas chambers there. And there\u2019s a very -- hardly anybody 1s alive\nstill.\u201d In my speeches I always say this is the moment that they found out what we now\ncall the Holocaust. We didn\u2019t know. We didn\u2019t know what happened to those trains that\nleft every Tuesday out of Westerbork to that work relief in Germany. My father found out\nthen, right there and then. And they found it out, too. So, it was a terrible thing, and --\nand -- and they said that we have lists, but there\u2019s hardly anybody on them. He said,\n\u201cThey all murdered? Murdered?\u201d He couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cWell,\u201d my father said, \u201cbut,\ncould you just look, maybe my wife is on there?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, we give you very\nlittle chance, Mr. Lessing,\u201d he didn\u2019t want to [indecipherable]. And he went down the\nlist, Red Cross list, and he said, \u201cBut she\u2019s here, your wife is here. Angeline Elizabeth\nLessing Van Leer.\u201d \u201cGod,\u201d my father said. \u201cHow wonderful,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere is she?\u201d\nAnd this little old man said, \u201cShe\u2019s in Philipville.\u201d My father said, \u201c\u201cWhere\u2019s Philipville?\u201d\nThey said, \u201cPhilipville is -- 1-1-it says here, Algiers, in North Africa.\u201d And -- And another\nfunny story. My father said, \u201cNo, that\u2019s impossible, cause we never had anything to do\nwith Africa. We never were in Africa.\u201d He said, \u201cTha -- those -- that\u2019s ca-can\u2019t be,\u201d you\nknow? And as he said that, the little old man got kind of insulted, and he said, \u201cMr.\nLessing, the Red Cross never makes a mistake. She must be there. Now, you better go\nhome and tell your children.\u201d And so my father went back, and he came back, and he told\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nus, \u201cYour mother is alive.\u201d It was exactly a year, practically to the day that she was\narrested. It was May, 1945. Well, that was one surprising thing.",
        "A: I\u2019m not quite sure, but I think 1t must have been in August. We -- A couple of weeks\nlater, we went on a -- on a Canadian army truck, and voyaged back to our hometown,\nDelft. And I must say, we were helped enormously by the members of the Resistance, the\npeople who have been in the Resistance, who were still in charge then, before the other\ncreeps from -- who had never done anything, came back from London, and started to take\nover, and they [indecipherable]. But it was still in disarray, you know, and the Resistance\npeople were in charge, and my father and his three sons came there, back to Delft, and\nthey said, \u201cAh, Mr. Lessing.\u201d They knew him, and they said, \u201c\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d And\nmy father said, \u201cOh, we need a place to live.\u201d \u201cWell, we\u2019ll give you a house, you know.\nWe got houses from Nazis, Dutch Nazis. We\u2019ve thrown them -- We\u2019ve thrown them out,\nyou know. They\u2019re in jail now,\u201d and so we got a -- we got a house, three floors, I mean,\nthey\u2019re all been a -- you know, not detached houses, they\u2019re row houses, with three\nfloors. And they said, \u201cWhat else do you need?\u201d And he said -- \u201cWell,\u201d my father said,\n\u201cTI need some furniture.\u201d And, \u201cOkay, we give you furniture.\u201d And they gave us a -- a\n[indecipherable]. They had a whole warehouse full of stuff confiscated from Dutch Nazis,\nand we got that, and we got spoons, and forks, and knives, and even some curtain\nmaterials, you know. And -- And they said, \u201cWhat else do you need?\u201d My father said,\n\u201cWell, I -- you know, I\u2019m a music teacher, I -- I had a piano.\u201d \u201cOh, we\u2019ll give you a\npiano.\u201d They gave him a piano. So, my father and I fixed up this new abode as well as we\ncould. We put the furniture, which was all disjointed pieces, you know, I mean, non-\nmatching pieces, and where we thought it would do the best good, and -- and we hung up\ncurtains on strings, and -- and that\u2019s how we started out. And my brothers went back to\nschool. God, I wished I could read to you the piece that my brother wrote about going\nback to school. He was -- See, born in 1936, must have been about nine years old when\nhe went back to school. He wrote recently in a speech to the Michigan State Assembly,\nhe -- he wrote a little piece about going back to school. He said that we were -- as if\nnothing had happened, open your book to page number 25, and he said, after two and a\nhalf years of being shit, you know, after being in hiding, after -- after denying our -- our -\n- Our -- Our -- Our -- OUr names, and our religion, and -- it was like -- I mean, the way he\nsays it, a beautiful speech. Anyway, the boys went back to school, and right around the\ncorner there was a -- there were buildings of the university, and they became a -- a -- a pr\n-- a prisoner of war camp for -- for Germans. And the engl -- There were English soldiers\nguarding them, and every day we would see them march through town, you know, they\nwent to -- God knows what they did. Oh, they -- they -- I don\u2019t know what they did, and -\n- and then one day, something magic hap -- magical happened. My brothers, who would\ngo and hang around there, to see those German prisoners there in the camp, and they\u2019re\nlooking through the gates, and one day they came, and there were no longer English\nsoldiers there, they were soldiers who had a Jewish star on their sleeve. And it said,\nJewish Brigade. They came home, and they said, \u201cThey had Jewish soldiers there.\u201d I\ndon\u2019t know, but my father and I didn\u2019t believe a word at first. What do you mean Jewish\nsol -- there are no Jewish soldiers. So we went to look, son of a bitch, there was these\neuys, just like the English standing there, you know, guarding the gate. So, the way that\nmy brother told it later on, my -- my little brothers went there, and they -- they said,\n\u201cHow do we make clear to them that we are Jewish boys?\u201d So, my brother Ott, who was\nalways kind of inventive, said, \u201cYeah, I know something. Let\u2019s go, and I\u2019ll stand next to\nhim, and I\u2019Il sing us the only Jewish song I know.\u201d And he started to hum, didn\u2019t know\nany words. And he started [sings notes] which I think it -- I\u2019m not quite sure what it is,\nbut he said -- 1t\u2019s a well known song, I think, that people sing at Passover, or you know.\nAnd the soldier looked at him, and said, \u201cCome here.\u201d He said, \u201cAre you Jewish boys?\u201d\nThey said, \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cCome in.\u201d And they brought them into the camp, and they became the\nmascots of that battalion, and every day trucks would pull up in front of the house, and\nsoldiers\u2019d say, \u201cAre the boys here? We want to take them up to a trip.\u201d And it was all\nwonderful. In August, I think, 1945, I came back from a Zionist meeting in The Hague.\nWe lived again in Delft, which is about 20 minutes by train one way. I came back from\nThe Hague, from a Zionist meeting. My cousin had said, \u201cYou better go to The Hague,\nthere\u2019s a group of kids there, they all were in hiding, and they sing songs, and they dance,\nand then there are also nice girls there.\u201d Well, I -- here I was, I was 18 or 19, never been\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nkissed, never been to bed with a girl, you know? I mean, my teenage years were gone.\nGirls, God. I wa -- In no time, I was on the train, and it was wonderful. There was all\nthese boys and girls, and then there were the soldiers of the Jewish Brigade, who brought\nfood and drink, and they took us for weekends, and I joined this Zionist group. There\u2019s\nalso a girl there called Carla Hymons, but she was three years younger, and kind of a kid.\nI didn\u2019t pay too much attention to her. Course, now I been married to her for 50 years.\nAnyway, I came back one evening from a Zionist meeting, Sunday -- Sunday morning,\ncame back. It was -- It was dusk, and I approached our new home, and there was an\nEnglish army truck standing in front of the house, which was nothing special, because the\n-- the Jewish Brigade always had trucks standing there in -- but a-as I ran by, from under\nthat -- that camouflage canvas, a woman\u2019s voice called, and said, \u201cOh sir, could you tell\nme where the Lessings live?\u201d It was my mother\u2019s voice. I\u2019ve always been warned, when\ndoing interviews for the Shoah Foundation, watch out, departures and reu -- when people\nreunite, that\u2019s when people start to cry, and it\u2019s true. It always -- It always happens that\nway, because that was my mother -- my mother\u2019s voice, and I barely had strength to -- to\nsay, \u201cMother, it\u2019s me, it\u2019s Eddie.\u201d And she came out of that truck, not at all what we\nexpected. She was all tanned. She came in an army jumpsuit. I mean, we ex-expected this\nBergen-Belsen emaciated, sick person, but of course, she had recuperated marvelously\nout there in Algiers, and as a matter of fact, typically like my mother, in no time at all, I\nunderstand, a few weeks after she arrived there, she was in charge of the office already.Anyway, there she was, and we rang the doorbell, and my father came, and -- and he was\njust, you know, he just -- he kept on saying to her, \u201cJust sit down, I just want to look at\nyou.\u201d And she walked around [indecipherable] and she had -- she had boxes full of stuff\nto eat. And we had saved one chocolate bar, that had fallen out of the sky one day when\nwe were still hiding in that little cottage during the winter of 1944 - \u201945. The English\nmade a mistaken drop of an enormous amount of weapons and radios, and also food\ncanisters. And I had managed to get one of the food canisters, and hide it until the\nGermans had taken everything. The Germans had been warned, and they came and took\neverything, but they didn\u2019t get this. Out of that, we had saved, for all those months, one\nlittle chocolate bar for my mother when she -- when she would come back, maybe. And\nhere she was with boxes full of stuff, you know, with chocolates, and cigarettes, and\nwhatever she could have got of there, out in that -- anyway, well there she was. She had\nflown back -- two bombers had flown from Algiers to Paris, and as I later h-heard -- this\nis -- I mean, this is the God damnedest ironic and horrible thing, one of the -- one of the\nbombers, w-with survivors, had flown from Algiers back to Europe, to France. Most of\nthem were Dutch. One of them -- One of the planes crashed, and everybody was killed,\nbut the other one arrived in Paris, and my mother from there hitchhiked, [indecipherable]\nand finally wound up in front of our house, and there she was. And my brother Ott, in his\nhurry to see her, he fell down the stairs, I remember. He rolled down two floors of -- of\nstairs, and it was pandemonium, but it was glorious, glorious, glorious. And my mother\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwalked around, and she said, \u201cOh, beautiful, this 1s -- 1s this ours? And my father said,\n\u201cYes, this is our h-home now.\u201d And she said, \u201cOh look at all the furniture you have, and -\n- and,\u201d -- this is the -- my father telling, you know, again, a little story, a mini story, he\nsays, and she walked around, and she said, \u201cOh, it\u2019s so beautiful, and -- and look, you\neven put curtains, and I,\u201d -- she was so impressed. She said -- But the next morning,\nwhen she got up, she said, \u201cWell, the couch 1s not right there, we got to move that, and\nthose curtains, they got to go. Th-That\u2019s -- That\u2019s a mess, and,\u201d he said -- my father starts\nshifting everything. Typically, like a woman. And then my brother said, \u201cMom, there are\nJewish soldiers around in, and they guarding prisoners of war.\u201d You know what my\nmother said? She said, \u201cI never want to see another Jew in my life.\u201d Oh, it was shocking.\nHowever, three weeks later, at a party in the Jewish Brigade, Italian camp, she was a\nperformer, she was an amateur singer. She sang Yiddish and Jewish songs for them, and\nshe just loved it, so.",
        "A: If you read what she tells about Bergen-Belsen, she said everybody stole from\neveryone else. She said you couldn\u2019t leave a -- a hanky lying around, you find the next\nday it was gone. If you -- well, at one point -- I -- I can\u2019t tell you the whole story of my\nmother, but th-there -- she tells about one night, she ca -- she wa -- she -- she managed to\nget a job in the kitchen, from I think midnight until seven in the morning, or something\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nlike that, where she was once in a while be able to steal some -- a potato or something,\nwhich would -- she would then divide with her friend, or something else, a lit -- tiny bit\nof extra food. And she said, \u201cOne morning I came back from my job, and the whole\nbarracks was empty.\u201d And she said the Germans had this crazy mania, like every two\nweeks or so, they would move everybody around into different barracks, for no God\ndamn reason that anybody could see. But then you had to move your stuff, and if you\nweren\u2019t there when you, as she wasn\u2019t -- she -- she came, and it -- it was in the middle of\nthe winter, it was very cold, she says, bitterly cold. Snow everywhere. And she said, \u201cI\ncame, and there was no one there, and all my stuff was gone.\u201d And she said, \u201cI sat at the\ndoorstep of the barracks, the empty barracks,\u201d she said, \u201cand I cried.\u201d And she said, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t want to go on, this is the end, I -- I don\u2019t want to go fight any more.\u201d And that\u2019s her\n-- with her magical thing, she said, \u201cI heard a voice saying, you must go on, don\u2019t give\nup, don\u2019t give up, you must go on, you must live,\u201d she says, \u201cand then I -- I schlepped\nmyself to the barracks where they had gone, and I pushed somebody aside so I could get\na place in a bunkbed, and -- to sleep. And I borrowed a blanket from a friend,\u201d or\nsomething. Anyway, she continued on. So -- But she said you couldn\u2019t trust anyone. They\nwould sell your -- their -- your -- their souls for -- for -- you know, they\u2019ll sell you for a --\nfor a piece of bread. So her impression of Jews was like, what do you expect, you know\u2019?\nAnyway, let me continue with the story, otherwise we\u2019ll sit here until a long, long time\nyet, because there\u2019s more to come on this. So, my mother was back, and I went back toschool. Now I was -- I was a terrible scholar, I -- I -- I had been to high school, and\nfailed, had been held back. In -- In -- In desperation my father had asked a neighbor,\n\u201c\u201cWh-What should I do with my son?\u201d And the neighbor had said, \u201cDo you know what\u2019s\na good profess -- send him to trade school, he learn profession.\u201d And then my father,\n\u201cWhat -- What kind of a trade school? What kind of a profession,\u201d and -- and this man\nsaid, \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI work with people who are instrument makers. They -- They --\nThey -- They make and repair scientific instruments.\u201d He said, \u201cIt\u2019s a good job,\u201d he said,\n\u201cand maybe your son can learn that.\u201d So, I don\u2019t know if you know the Yiddish\nexpression, ashander? It means -- It means -- It means a -- it\u2019s a terrible thing in the\nfamily. It used to be said if a -- if a girl marries a non-Jew, that\u2019s ashander, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s\nYiddish, and it means -- it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a terrible thing. So here my -- I probably was\nthe only Jewish boy who ever was in that trade school. I mean, there were no Jewish kids\nin trade schools. They became lawyers and doctors and writers, and whatever, but here I\nwas. I had gone to the trade school, and during the war, when the Germans decided\nJewish kids couldn\u2019t go any longer in school, I was out of trade school. And now the war\nwas over, and I went back to the trade school, and I finished one year of -- to get a\ndiploma in instrument making. It didn\u2019t take very long after that, I worked at one jo -- I\nworked at two jobs, and -- with instrument companies in Delft, and first as an apprentice\nin the shop, and later on -- my mother made another decision for me, come to think of it.\nMy mother said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a little vacation before,\u201d you know, and -- oh, the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nfirst job I had, I worked in a machine shop, as an apprentice tool maker, or instrument\nmaker, and I had a -- I found out I had an anti-Semitic boss, a g -- a guy who said Jews\nare no good. And I told this at home, and my mother said, \u201cYou quit, right now.\u201d And I\nquit. She says, \u201cNow you to-take a vacation,\u201d oh no, first, \u201cgo around, see if you get\nanother job.\u201d And I went to another -- there was another instrument company, very\nprestigious one, and I asked for a job there, and they said, \u201cWell, we don\u2019t have aj -- we\ndon\u2019t have a position in -- in the -- in the sh -- in the -- the shop, but w-we could take you\non as an apprentice draftsman.\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, I -- I work in the shop.\u201d My mother\nsaid, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go take a vacation for a week? Go visit friends.\u201d Which I did.\nWhen I came back, she says, \u201cYou have a job as a draftsman.\u201d I said, \u201cBut I said no.\u201d She\nsaid, \u201cI took it for -- I told them you would take it.\u201d And that was it.",
        "A: From my memory -- It\u2019s going to be hard to believe what I\u2019m going to tell you. We\ndidn\u2019t talk about the war. We sort of went right into picking up where we left off. I\u2019m still\nsaying it today in my speeches to -- to -- to adult -- when I speak to adult audiences. I say,\n\u201cWe thought we would just pick up where we left off, and we did. We thought that two\nand a half years of hiding was an interruption, but now we were back.\u201d And life -- I\njoined this -- this group, my father started teaching music, my brothers went to school.\nNobody talked about the war. Nobody talked about. There was no Holocaust. The word\ndidn\u2019t exist, the beginning. I was together in this -- this group of -- of -- of we went with\nhundreds of kids who had been in hiding. We went on weekends, provided by the Jewish\nBrigade. Nobody talked about what had happened. It was as if we -- as if we were ger --\nnormal kids. When I think it back ows -- it seems incredible, it\u2019s unbelievable that w --\nbut -- but I guess we had to do it, in order to get started again. So my answer to you 1s\nthat life seemed to resume normally where -- where th -- where we had left off, two and a\nhalf years before. Course, we weren\u2019t Polish Jews, who came back and then were\nmurdered. Or, later on a Czech friend of mine here in the United States, says, \u201c\u201cWhen I\nwent back to my village, they tried to kill me, when I tried to get my parents house back.\u201d\nWe were welcomed, and well, friends said, \u201cWe\u2019re glad you\u2019re back.\u201d We got a nice\nletter from the little -- the maid, who had -- we had had that -- a maid before we left, and\nshe wrote us a nice letter, \u201cDear Mr. and Miss,\u201d -- to my parents, \u201cDear Mr. and Mrs.\nLessing.\u201d She was a simple soul. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re back, because I already thought you\nhad kicked the bucket.\u201d She say -- She wrote it, something very similar in that. Life\nresumed. For all those who didn\u2019t -- who had disappeared, there was no -- we didn\u2019t talk\nabout that.",
        "A: Even within our family, nobody talked about it. There was no discussion. The\ndiscussions came 50 years later. And pretty soon -- well, a -- as I said, I was in this\nZionist group, I met this girl, and she was three years younger, but then a year later, my\nfather and I, we got a -- we got a visa for the -- for the United States, which was very\nunusual, and my parents said, \u201cAre you coming to the United States?\u201d And I said, \u201cNo,\nI\u2019m a Zionist, I\u2019m going to go to Israel.\u201d Palestine, then. And they said, well -- they\ntalked me out of if, they said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come with me? You have a visa now,\ncome with us to the States. We need help to get started. Maybe you can save some money\nand help us get started.\u201d We didn\u2019t have any money. And so, I agreed. But I managed to -\n- like, a month before I agreed to leave, before we supposed to leave, I fell in love with\nthis girl. And when I left, we made an agreement that if we would keep on writing letters,\nthen it would be something, but if we didn\u2019t keep on writing letters, well then, 1t was\nnothing. And so, my father and I left for the United States. My father went to Springfield,\nMassachusetts. And I got a job, my first job, with -- we actually went both to my aunt and\nuncle, liv -- the aunt that my mother was supposed to go to. Aunt and uncle lived in\nHolyoke, Massachusetts. And from there, my father went to Springfield, and started\nteaching music, and my uncle got me a job in General Electric, in Schenectady, New\nYork, as a toolmaker, and that\u2019s where I went. And so, the first year, my first year in the\nUnited States was spent in Schenectady. And I would call that the armpit of -- of New\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nYork State, 1t was about the worst place. And I think that\u2019s where, maybe the first\nintimations of what had happened to me began to -- to be felt a little bit, because I had no\none there. I was almost in the same situation when I was -- as I was on my first farm. I\nknew nobody. I lived in a -- the room I -- if somebody had said to me, \u201cIf you -- You\nneed a room?\u201d And I said yes. Oh, the man at General Electric, at the employment office\nthere said -- personnel office, he said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go to the YMCA, they have an\nannouncement board and people post rooms for rent sometimes.\u201d So I went there, and I\nfound the McDuffys, or something like that, and -- on the street, and I rented a room from\ntwo older ladies. And they had some more rooms, there were other students, there were --\nthere were some Latin American students there.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: Yeah, I rented this room from these two -- two Catholic ladies, and after a month, they\nsaid, \u201cEd, we\u2019re sorry, we -- we need the room for someone else.\u201d And I was out. And I\nthought it was a little strange. In the meantime, I had contacted -- I found out there was a\nJewish Community Center, something I never knew about, and I went there, and I spoke\nwith the director there, and I said, \u201cYou know, I had this room, and,\u201d -- he said, \u201c\u201cWho\nwas it?\u201d I said, \u201cMr. and Mrs. McDuffy, on the,\u201d -- whatever, \u201cCedar Street,\u201d or\nsomething. He said, \u201cYou rented from Catholic people?\u201d I said, \u201cYeah.\u201d He said, \u201cWell,\ndid they know you were Jewish?\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, I told them, you know, I said I was a\nZionist, and,\u201d -- he said, \u201cOf course y -- th-they didn\u2019t want you in the house.\u201d He said,\n\u201cWa -- You,\u201d he said, \u201cWe have rooms here for rent with Jews,\u201d he said. My first -- My\nfirst hit with anti-Semitism in the United States. I haven\u2019t found any after that, I must say,\nyou know, but it was a revelation. I thought, \u201cOh, my God. That\u2019s still going on in this\ncountry?\u201d And I thought, \u201cI\u2019m not going to take this. I had this for two and a half years.\u201d\nAnd it began to dawn on me that I was different from -- from the regular -- what should I\nsay? American -- American Jews, that I had -- I had a past. And I met -- Well, I got\nanother room with a very old Jewish lady, who spoke mostly Yiddish, and she was very\nsweet, but I didn\u2019t have any heat in my room, so I had to always leave the door opened.\nBut she was very sweet, and was my first touch of Yiddish. I had never heard Yiddish\nbefore. And here was a lady who spoke mostly Yiddish.",
        "A: Well, it c -- it came about because I met -- through the people I met at the Jewish\nCommunity Center. I met a guy called Phil, forget his last name. He was the all American\nJewish teenager, I guess. A little bit older. Yeah, he was pre-college, he was -- yeah, he\nwas teenager, he was in -- probably in high school. And he and I made friends, somehow\nanother. And Phil, well, I realized, was a happy guy. He had a car, he did some -- he did\nsome amateur -- no, not amateur, he did some photography for the local newspaper. You\nknow, he would take -- go to a fire, or something like that. What they call it, a stringer,\nprobably, right? Anyway, Phil -- Phil seemed to have -- was terribly unlike me. H-He\nwasn\u2019t serious about life. He wasn\u2019t worry about de -- worried about death. He -- He was\n-- Life was happy. He went to school dances, and to reunions of his class, and he invited\nme for New Year\u2019s Eve, \u201cYou want to spend New Year\u2019s Eve with me and my family?\u201d I\nsays, \u201cYeah, great.\u201d In Holland, on New Year\u2019s Eve, the whole family comes together,\nand you make special pastries and so. So I came to his house that evening, about nine\no\u2019clock, and I just bumped into his father and mother, who are on their way out. They\nsaid, \u201cHi, Ed, we\u2019re,\u201d -- I said, \u201cWhere you going?\u201d \u201cOh, we\u2019re going to a party.\u201d Oh, oh,\nand so they left. Then his sister came out with her boyfriend. \u201cWell, Ed, have a nice\nevening.\u201d I said, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d \u201cOh, we\u2019re going to celebrate somewhere, New\nYear\u2019s Eve, with friends.\u201d So it was Phil and me. I realized this is different. These\npeople, they just have fun, they go out, they party. New Year\u2019s Eve was a serious\nbusiness in Holland, you remembered, you know, life and death, and -- so Phil said,\n\u201cWhat shall we do tonight?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, what do you do on New Year?\u201d He\nsays, \u201cYou want to cruise around with the car?\u201d He had this big Chevy convertible. I\ndon\u2019t know, we -- we cruised around through Schenectady until it was after 12, and then I\nwent back to my little old Yiddish lady, and -- and I realized I\u2019m different, this 1s -- then I\nmet someone else. A -- A man who seemed a little older than me, and he was from\nCzechoslovakia, and he -- I realized it years later, he was a Holocaust survivor. But I\ndidn\u2019t know what a Holocaust survivor was. He said, \u201cI have a car. You want it,\u201d --\nsomehow another, I guess he -- he said where were you, and I said I was in Holland, in\nhiding. And -- And he said, \u201cOh.\u201d He said, \u201cI was in camps.\u201d And he -- who knows what\ncamps he may have been in. Auschwitz for all I know. The name didn\u2019t -- if he had said\nAuschwitz, it wouldn\u2019t have rung a bell with me even then. And we spent a little time\ntogether, and he told me -- he was the man who said, \u201cWhen I tried to go back to my\nvillage, and get to my father and mother\u2019s home, who had been killed in camps,\u201d he said,\n\u201cthey tried to kill me, and I ran off.\u201d And he was a butcher in the A&P. I think it\u2019s the\nfirst time that I met up with a camp survivor. I\u2019ve always remembered him. So I realize\nthere was a little bit of a kinship there. Anyway --",
        "A: No, we did not talk at length about what had gone behind. Survivors didn\u2019t talk about\nwhat happened then. You were busy making your life. Anyway, let me see if I -- let me\nnot forget anything. I worked for about a year at General Electric.",
        "A: Well, my mother and -- no, my mother wasn\u2019t over yet, my mother and brothers were\nstill in -- in Holland, and my father was in Springfield, Massachusetts, beginning to set up\na teaching schedule, and I was in Schenectady. And my girlfriend was in Holland, and I\nwrote letters like crazy. Man, did I write. And after a year, I -- I quit at General Electric,\nas my plan had been. I just had joined General Electric in order to learn the American\nsystem for measuring, and the tool names, and all that, the -- you know, the -- how -- we -\n- we di -- we had the metric system in Europe, and I wasn\u2019t used to the system they had\nhere, and so -- so I took that year, and I learned, and I worked, and it was very interesting,\nI had a very good time, and working with -- with American men, and my boss was a\ngreat guy, I -- was totally unknown 1-in Holland, something like -- first day I was there,\nhe said, \u201cEd, call me George.\u201d I said, \u201cThat\u2019s my boss, I can\u2019t call -- call -- call him --\ncan\u2019t call him George.\u201d But he insisted, it -- it was like Jesus. When I left one of the -- an\nold man, Hank Kruger, old toolmaker, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve been here for 35 years. What are you\nleaving for?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I want to go back to drafting, you know, become a drafts -- I\nwas -- I was a draftsman when I left home.\u201d He said -- \u201cI on -- I only took this j -- this job\nto learn about tools, and so on.\u201d He said, \u201cYou\u2019ll never get a job like this again. You can\nstay here forever,\u201d you know, and -- and I thought, \u201cGee, d-d-don\u2019t they fire people\nhere?\u201d He said, \u201cYeah, you got to commit a murder in order to fire someone,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBeside, the union would -- union -- union wouldn\u2019t let the -- let you be fired.\u201d I was a\nmember of a union, electrical workers. But I did quit, after a year, and my mother came\nover. I went to New York, and my mother, and my brothers came. We all went to Radio\nCity Music Hall, saw Gene Kelly in \u201cThe Pirate.\u2019 Grace -- Great days, and -- and I found\na job in Ossening, little bit up the river from -- you know, Ossening, New York. Which --\nLife is very strange, I -- I had written down some names when I -- when I left Holland, of\ncompanies similar to the ones -- the one where I worked as a draftsman in Holland, a\nscientific instrument company. One of them was the Cambridge Instrument Company,\nand I called them, and I explained that I had worked for Kip and Sons in Holland. And\noh, they said, \u201cOh, w-we make the same things here. We\u2019d love to meet you, Mr.\nLessing.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhere do I go?\u201d And they said, \u201cWell, our headquarters is in\nGrand Central Station, in New York, in the office building.\u201d And I traveled to Grand\nCentral, and -- and oh, they were delighted with my resume, and -- as it was at that time.\nAnd they said, \u201cWell, we\u2019d gladly -- gladly h-have you,\u201d he said, \u201cbut all we want you to\ndo is -- is do meet our -- our chief engineer, Mr. Digby, an Englishman.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cSo, I\u2019ll take the train to Cambridge then.\u201d They said, \u201cNo, no, our -- our -- our\nfactory is located in Ossening.\u201d I said, \u201cAren\u2019t you in Cambridge?\u201d They said, \u201cNo.\u201d\nThey said, \u201cWhy would you want to be in Cambridge?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, my parents live in\nSpringfield, and I figured Cambridge near Boston, and -- and Springfield, it\u2019s an easy --\nthere\u2019s a train connection, and a -- you know, it\u2019s an hour,\u201d and -- \u201cOh, no,\u201d they said. I\nsaid, \u201cWell, what\u2019s Cambridge Instrument Company then?\u201d They said, \u201cOh yeah, well\nyears ago, we used to be a sister company of Cambridge Instrument Company in\nEngland, but what -- what had nothing to do with us any more, we\u2019re now located in\nOssening.\u201d And that\u2019s how I wound up in Ossening, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m living here in\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nWestchester still. Anyway, I got the job there, and started working, and then my girl\ncame over. And -- But before that, I should tell you another little incident with my\nmother. I lived on the houseboat, I -- When I got the job in Ossening, I lived on a\nhouseboat in the river, on a dock in the river. It was a houseboat somebody else had lent\nme. He said, \u201cWould you take care of the houseboat? You can have it for a year, with no\nrent.\u201d Okay. So I wrote all my letters from the houseboat in Ossening, and one day I got a\nletter from my mother, and said, \u201cI want to send you here this little advertisement that\nI\u2019ve cut out of the Jewish newspaper in Holland.\u201d And I plucked it out of there, and it\nsaid that Ed Lessing was engaged to Carla Hymons. And so I was engaged. My mother\nhad decided that we were engaged, so -- it always makes a wonderful hit because at our\n50\" wedding anniversary, I told this story about our engagement. People -- Americans,\nthey -- they look at you -- \u201cYou were -- your mother told you were engaged?\u201d I said\nyeah. I didn\u2019t think it was strange. My mother had seen that we wrote a lot of letters, and\nshe figures here\u2019s a nice girl, Ed, you\u2019re engaged. So we were engaged to get married,\nand so we married. She came over, and we got married in -- what 1s it, 1948, I think, in\nChicopee, Massachusetts.",
        "A: Oh, desire, love, forever. I mean, I had three little black and white photographs of her,\nand they just drove me crazy. I could look -- look at them for hours. I -- I just crazy with\nlove for this girl. Oh, it was endless letters about -- I told her about what I was doing, andwhat -- you know, but each let -- I wrote at least -- at least four letters a week, and each\none had a least eight, if not 12 pages. When the -- When it was all over, when they come\n-- | had a -- we filled a suitcase with -- and she would write back once in awhile also, but\nnot that much. She would also write I love you. I wrote -- anyway --",
        "A: Of course, because that\u2019s how we met. We met in -- We met in the Zionist\norganizations. Both of us didn\u2019t want to live in Holland, both of us wanted to go to\nPalestine. I mean, all the girls, all the boys, nobody want to stay in Holland, although\nsome did, but we all wanted to get -- get the hell out, and go to the -- many went to the\nUnited States, others went to -- to Palestine. Carla\u2019s brother went -- helped by the Jewish\nBrigade to get to Palestine illegally. It was the end. We didn\u2019t realize why it was the end,\nI think even. It\u2019s just strange, when I think back of it. We wanted to get out. None of us\nknew the numbers, by the way. None of us knew at that time that 75 percent of the Dutch\nJewish population had been -- had been murdered. A lot of people went on those trains,\nand they -- yeah, well, you heard, I have an uncle, or somebody had -- that his father\nwas killed, or -- but it didn\u2019t form a picture. Again, the Holocaust did not exist yet. The --\nThe scope of this -- of this horror, was this -- was unknown to us. It had been bad, and a\nlot of people got killed, 1t seemed, but what can I tell you? That\u2019s how I remember it,\nanyway.",
        "A: Well, I got to jump way ahead, but let me see. I better stay a little bit chronologically,\notherwise it doesn\u2019t make any s -- we got married, and in 1950 we decided now was the\ntime to go to -- to Israel. 1948, the state had been declared, in 1950 we left. We left on the\nLaGuardia, a ship of the American export line, and we had a marvelous trip across. We\nstopped in various places, Gibraltar, and Paraeus, and -- and we wound up in Haifa, and\nCarla\u2019s brother was there, and we went to where Carla\u2019s brother and sister-in-law lived in\na kibbutz called Dovrat, in Israel. And there we lived for five years, as kibbutniks --\nkibbutzniks. Idealists. You didn\u2019t make, you know, no money, and I started working at\nfirst as a blacksmith there, because I had some experience with metal working, of course,\na-and later on I became a tractor driver, I had my own little tractor, and I spend most of\nmy time spraying poisons on apples, and pears, and grapes, and -- and Carla worked in\nthe children\u2019s houses, with -- with the babies, and with little children, and -- and our\ndaughter was born in 1952, I guess, and we named her Noa, N-o-a, for figure out of the --\nout of the Bible. And I wasn\u2019t very happy in the kibbutz. I had already tasted individual\nlife, and it was very hard to adjust. I had been an independent guy. When I come to think\nof my whole life, I\u2019ve been -- always been more or less a -- a lo -- a -- a-- a-- a guy who\ndid better as a -- as as -- as a loner. Not -- Not necessarily completely detached from life,\nbut -- but as one who took care of himself. I took care of myself during the war, most of\nthe time. I was not with anyone else, I was by myself, except for la -- at the end. Beforethat, I had two brothers, but they were eight and 10 years younger. They were always\ntogether, like twins, and I was by myself out there, you know, 10 years older. So, I had\nworked in the States, I had worked in Holland, in my own profession, and here I was a\ntractor driver. So I wasn\u2019t too happy there. My daughter got sick, she got tuberculosis,\nwhich runs in the family, and almost died in the hospital. And strangely enough, we had\nnot made any decision to go back to the United States, but it -- it happened through a\nbunch of strange coincidences. I had no family in Israel, none whatsoever, all my family\nwas in the United States, and it was quite a -- quite a group by then. My two brothers, my\nfather and mother, my cousins had come over, with wives, with their children. It grew\nhere in the States, all around Springfield, and so on. And I was -- I was sitting out in -- 1-\nin Israel, and everybody was poor, they didn\u2019t have money to travel to Israel to -- in those\ndays everything was different, you know, you didn\u2019t say, \u201cOh well, we go, you know,\nspend a couple of weeks in Israel,\u201d you know, wh-what the hell, a couple of thousand\nbucks, so what? 20 dollars was a lot of money. So, I had actually no prospect of seeing\nmy family again. Carla had her brother, and an uncle, and she had some family in Israel, I\ndidn\u2019t. And my mother wants us -- when we -- when we left the United States to go to\nIsrael, Carla and I, we had asked for a re-entry permit, which you needed in those days.\nYou needed a re-entry permit if you wanted to come back into the States, as a non-\ncitizens. We weren\u2019t citizens, you know? I had sent the money to Washington, but the re-\nentry permit never came. Oh, we said, so what. It was just -- It was like a -- a -- a safety\nline in -- in case we wouldn\u2019t like it in -- in Israel, then we could always come back. But,\nyou know, we liked it well enough, and five years went by, and then my mother wrote.\nShe said, \u201cDid you ever get that re-entry permit?\u201d And I wrote back, \u201cNo, we didn\u2019t. We\nsent the money, but we didn\u2019t get it.\u201d She -- Well, my mother being well, my mother,\nimmediately spoke with her senator. \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s going on here? My son sent money\nto Washington for re-entry permit.\u201d \u201cI\u20191] look into it.\u201d Two weeks later a letter came from\nthe embassy in Tel Aviv, that, \u201cYou are hereby requested to reapply for a visa to the\nUnited States,\u201d and I hadn\u2019t planned to apply for a visa -- send photographs. And we\nthought, well, my daughter hadn\u2019t been s -- been so sick, and almost died, and maybe we\nshould go back for some time, and -- well, from there it rolled on and on and on and on.\nThey needed photographs, you needed documents, you need to go to the local police to\ntell you that you were a good character. And one day a letter arrived in the kibbutz, and\nsomebody in -- the letters in the kibbutz all come to the office, and then they get\ndistributed. And somebody in the office said, \u201cHey, I\u2019m going to open this letter.\u201d He\nopened our letters from the embassy, and said, \u201cHey, these people are applying to go\nback to the United States.\u201d Now, it\u2019s hard to imagine at this point in the history of Israel,\nbut then, if you left the kibbutz, just leave it and go to the city, you were an outcast\nalready, sort of. They would give you a table, and two chairs and a bed, and 20 bucks,\nand goodbye Charlie, that was nice of you to be in the kibbutz. We don\u2019t want to have\nfurther anything to do with you. To go back to the country where you came from, you\nwere yuradeem. There are two words in Israel, one it alleyah, which means going up,\nwhen you go to Israel, you make alleyah, you go to Israel, you go up. The word El Al\ncomes from there, by the way, the airline. When you leave Israel, you yurate, you go\ndown. We were yuradeem, people who go down. It was, again the word ashander, an-and\nit was a terrible thing. And in the general meeting, in the kibbutz, the members decided\nthat we had no right to live there any more, even though we had worked for five years,\nour butts off, and all that, but -- and we had been bona fide members, they voted us out.\nBut they didn\u2019t want to throw us out right away, first -- they would throw us out as soon\nas I found a job, some -- outside of the kibbutz. So I went, and I applied for a job, and I\ngot a job as a draftsman, in an English company, the refineries, the oil refineries in Haifa.\nAnd I don\u2019t know any more what happened, but we didn\u2019t -- we decided that we wouldn\u2019t\nstay in Israel after all. However, we couldn\u2019t go to the United States either, because of\nmy daughter\u2019s tuberculosis that she had had. They took x-rays, and they said, \u201cYou'll\nhave to wait a year.\u201d In those days tuberculosis was like AIDS today. You had it, you\ndidn\u2019t get into the States, and that was the worst. So, they said, \u201cYou'll have to wait a\nyear.\u201d And I don\u2019t know, we decided, you know what, if we have to wait a year, let\u2019s go\nto Holland, and we\u2019ll wait a year there, and then we\u2019ll apply to the American embassy\nthere. And so we got on a ship, and left Israel with our daughter, and went back to\nHolland, and we lived there for one year in 1956. I went back to the same place where I\nhad worked before as a draftsman, found out about a new profession that I had neverheard about, and immediately decided that was the profession that I wanted to learn. It\nwas called industrial design. I\u2019d never heard of it. It was ideal for me. It was a\ncombination of art, and technology. Industrial designers are the people who design cars\non the outside, and telephones and refrigerators, and -- in other words, people who give\nshape to modern industrial products. Anyway, we spent a year in Holland, had a\nwonderful time. One of the best years of our lives, I don\u2019t know why, but it was just\nwonderful. My daughter, in quick succession, dropped her Hebrew, which she spoke\nfluently, and learned Dutch, and at the end of the year, when we went to the United\nStates, she dropped her Dutch, and in three weeks spoke fluent English. So, went through\nthree languages in no time at all. And so we got back to the United States.",
        "A: It\u2019s g -- It\u2019s a good question you ask, because it brings me back to our five years in\nkibbutz. It\u2019s astounding. In the kibbutz, there was a group of youngsters who had come\nfrom Romania, they were all orphans, their parents had all been killed. They worked a\nhalf a day in the morning, and in the afternoon they learned, they had school lessons. I\nactually set up a little drafting course for some of them, for some of the boys that wanted\nto learn drafting. Do you know that it never occurred to me that they were Holocaust\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nsurvivors? That they had gone through hell? That these kids were -- I mean, that they\ncouldn\u2019t even imagine what these children had gone through. They were just kids to us,\nyeah, and they were not such good kids either, because sometimes they would steal\nthings. Sometimes, you -- you know, you were supposed to work with them. I had s -- a\nkid who were helping me on the tractor, and he wouldn\u2019t work very well, and I thought,\n\u201cOh, he\u2019s a rotten kid.\u201d When I think back of it now, I cannot even imagine that I didn\u2019t\nrealize, that I didn\u2019t have the compassion. There were two ladies in the kibbutz, who were\nHolocaust survivors from camps. One, Margit, big woman, would scream at night in her\ndreams. And aft -- you know, when we heard it the first time, we\u2019d say, \u201cWho was this\nscreaming last night, this awful screaming?\u201d \u201cOh that\u2019s -- that\u2019s Margit, she\u2019s dreaming\nabout the camps, oh yeah.\u201d That was it. And I think about that now, I can\u2019t even imagine\nthat either, that it didn\u2019t ring a bell, it didn\u2019t do anything, it -- oh well, that was the\nHolocaust survi -- we had a father on a -- a father of one of the members of the kibbutz,\nan old man, he had been in the camps. Every meal, he would take from the communal\ndining room, he would take pieces of bread, and put them in his pocket, take them to his\nroom and hide them. It was a big joke. Abba Bower. Abba Bower, who would take bread.\nYou look back and you don\u2019t understand it. I guess we -- we were busy. We were busy\nworking, we were busy building a family, we -- we were busy with our children, we were\nbusy having fun sometimes. We were busy sitting on the lawn in the evening, and talking\nabout the neighbors, and about Holland, and how much of what we did in our childhood,and the fun we had, and -- and remembering old class songs, or stuff like that. Nobody\nmentioned a word about what had happened to us. And Carla\u2019s brother had gone through\nthe Holocaust, he was in hiding with her, he was there.",
        "A: I think it probably was. There -- There are many -- I mean, this is in hindsight now, of\ncourse, and I\u2019ve heard -- we all have heard now, the stories of -- that the Holocaust\nsurvivors weren\u2019t particularly welcome in Israel after the war, because they represented\ndefeat, and what Israel was about was victory. And then there were these people who\nkept on talking about the horrors they had seen, and nobody wanted to hear this. Nobody\nwanted to hear the stories. And the hidden children -- that term by ca -- didn\u2019t exist, of\ncourse, but those who had been in hiding, we -- when you heard a story from a -- from a\nHolocaust survivor who had been in Auschwitz, you weren\u2019t going to talk about, hey, I\nwas in a room for two and a half years. They would laugh. Nothing happened to you. You\nweren\u2019t in the camps, you didn\u2019t see anybody die, did you? No, but -- anyway. No, it -- I\nguess there was something like that, but I\u2019m not sure that that influenced us at all. We\nlived with a little group of o-other Dutch kibbutznikim, some of who had also gone\nthrough hiding, and we worked hard, we got children, and we didn\u2019t talk about the war,\ntalked about everything but the war. Talked about the crummy bastards in the kibbutz\nwho were freeloading, on -- on us who were working so hard, and they talked about the --\nthe guy, the sadana witha the guy who puts you in work places every day, and he always\ngave you the lousy jobs. And talked about tractors, that they weren\u2019t working right, or\nstuff like that. Years went -- went by talking about that.",
        "A: Wait a minute, I didn\u2019t get that. Say it -- Would you reformulate that?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Cure me of Zionism?",
        "A: I guess I wasn\u2019t enough of an idealist to stick it out. Life in a kibbutz was hard. Carla\nwould have liked to stay. I opted for leaving Israel. She said she would have stayed. As a\nmatter of fact, she once said that someone in the kibbutz, and I never found out who it\nwas, some man had said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay with me? Let Ed go back to United\nStates?\u201d And she decided not to do that.",
        "A: Yeah, I\u2019m not quite sure, you see, I\u2019m not quite sure what happened there. I had this\njob --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: Yeah. We came back, and of course now we had a daughter, and I started looking\naround for a job, and an apartment, and we -- we found that in the next village where --\nfrom where we are right now, in Dobb\u2019s Ferry. And I started a job with a -- with an\ninstrument company. Let\u2019s see, a son -- we got a son. He was born here in the -- in here,\nin the area, and we moved from an apartment in Dobb\u2019s Ferry to this house in Hastings,\n36 years ago. In the meantime, I started going to school at night. I went to Pratt Institute,\nand got a degree in Industrial design, and started working on Madison Avenue, and then\ngot laid off there, because they ran out of work. This is just about the time Kennedy got\nassassinated. And then I sort of slid into doing free lance work for myself. And life went\non, and Carla started going to school, and she graduated, and she -- she first went -- got a\nBachelors, and then she got a Master\u2019s from Columbia, and she became a Social Worker.\nAnd was all -- that was a great accomplishment for us, because we had missed our\neducation in a sense. So now I was free-lancing, and then -- and I got a studio in New\nYork City for awhile, on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 42\" Street, in a prestigious\nbuilding, and a -- we were very busy, and the kids were growing up, and so on and so\nforth. I thought that our life -- my life would be pretty well without surprises further on. I\nlooked at it -- I forget what birthday that was, but it\u2019Il be my 40\" -- my 40\" would have --\nwould have been in \u201966, right? Born in \u201926. Anyway, somewhere, one of these birthdays,\nI said, \u201cWell, I think I\u2019ve seen it about.\u201d You know? Sounds a little cynical, but I had a\nbig birthday party, and at the end of the day I thought, probably it\u2019s going to go on until\nmy death wi -- about the same way, you know? With working, and kids growing up and\nleaving the home, and so on and so forth, and -- and two things happened. Actually, three\nthings happened, but -- but the first one happened in -- let me see, I think 19 -- 19 --\n1980. [inaudible] 1980? 1981. My wife got involved with a couple of other ladies in\nsetting up a -- something that hadn\u2019t been done before, a special kind of meeting of\npeople who had been in hiding. And now, she was always involved in reading Holocaust\nliterature, and especially Dutch 1s -- tr -- poetry, and stories written by Holocaust\nsurvivors. I never touched it. My brother sent me the standard work in Holland, about the\ndestruction of the Dutch Jewry, a two volume book, and it stood on the shelf. I once\nlooked, there were a couple of photographs in it, I was horrified, I put it back on the shelf,\nnever touched it. Anyway, in 1981, she started to organize this -- this business with -- but\nbefore that, there was an article in New York magazine, I\u2019m sure she had -- she must\nhave told you about all this -- was an article in New York magazine in which there was a\n-- a couple of stories, a bunch of stories of -- of hidden -- what they suddenly were called,\nhidden children, children who had been in hiding. It hit the -- It hit the -- the -- the -- the -\n- the -- the media, you know? In short order, CBS, NBC, ABC, the magazines, Time, Idon\u2019t know, Newsweek, everybody wanted to know -- a new buzz word there was,\nhidden children, who had ever heard of hidden children? Here we had been for 50 years\nsurrounded -- now we -- we didn\u2019t think about it ourselves. Anyway, that\u2019s the time we\ngot in -- we got asked to be interviewed by the Holocaust museum, I guess, and in short\norder we -- I got onto all kinds of television programs. I was on CNBC, we were -- the\nwhole family was on ABC Good Morning America, and -- it was amazing -- amazing\ntime. Anyway, the conference was in sight. It was on Memorial Day, 1981, I think. And\nCarla said to me, \u201cAre you coming to this conference?\u201d She had been very busy\norganizing this. I had heard the news, you know, and -- and -- and I -- I think my --  a-\nanswer was -- is -- is a classic by now, I -- I said, \u201cAh no, why should I come? I mean,\nyou will be busy, running around here -- there -- at the conference, and I'll just be\nhanging out, you know, waiting til it\u2019s over.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cyou know, my brother is\nespecially coming from Israel, and he\u2019ll be wandering around by himself. Couldn\u2019t you\njust come?\u201d And I said, \u201cAll right, all right.\u201d I\u2019ve been married for many years, you learn\nwhen to -- when to be acquiescent, you know? And so, there we gathered, on Memorial\nDay weekend, in -- on Times Square in the -- in the Marriott. And I think it was Friday\nnight when the first registration was supposed to be on, and I -- Carla was busy up there\non the seventh floor. They were -- They had the -- like, sort of places where you could\nregister. And I positioned myself between those windows, where people stood behind\nthem, had all these kits for they -- for those who had registered, and the elevators. Nowthe elevators 1-1-in -- in that hotel are made out of glass, sort of. They -- They -- They rise\nfrom -- from -- from the bottom on the -- in -- in an atrium. And then, when they come to\nthe floor, they open up, and they disgorge their people. And I stood there, and I watched\nthe elevators bringing up these people, these gray haired men and women, of all kinds of\nheights and sizes, and girth, and -- and then I saw them go to the -- to the windows there,\nwhere the volunteers of -- were standing, and they were getting their kits, and then they\ngot the tags, and they put the tags on, and they wrote on there where -- who they were,\nand where they had been in hiding. And I can\u2019t -- to this day I cannot explain to you, but\nas they got -- started to crowd around on the floor, and I began to read their tags, sort of\nfurtively, you know, I wasn\u2019t with anyone, and they began to form groups and talk, and I\nlooked at the tags, and the tags said, I was hidden in Belgium, I was hidden in France, I\nwas hidden in Holland. I came from Poland, I came from Romania. And this -- very\nstrange, but I began to cry. I began to cry, and it was to me as if I always had believed\nthat I was the only one who had been in hiding. Is a thing so strange, I mean, I knew, you\nknow. I mean, my o -- my own brothers, and friends, and everybody had been -- but here\nthey were, the hidden children, s -- 1600 of them. And they crowded around, and they\ntalked, and I just stood and looked at them, and I cried. And they were suddenly like I\nhad all these brothers and sisters, but of course, I had very little in common with most of\nthem, sum -- you know. There was very little in common between somebody who has\nbeen in hi -- in hiding in Poland, and somebody who has been hi -- in hiding in -- in\nFrance, let\u2019s say, or in Belgium. The situation w-were vastly different, but it didn\u2019t\nmatter. And the conference started up, and Carla\u2019s brother came, and we sat in the\nconference, 1600 people, we listened to Abe Foxman, you know, of the Anti-Defamation\nLeague, who was a hidden child. And we listened to other people. And I cried, and\neverybody cried. I cried for three days. Something magical happened there. I, who had\nnever read a book on the Holocaust, I suddenly was -- it was like, I don\u2019t know, like my\nmind opened up suddenly to something that I could -- you asked me, did you t -- earlier,\ndid you talk about the war, either in New Yor -- in -- in the Zionist organization or in the\nkibbutz? Never a word. Carla and I didn\u2019t talk about the war with each other. And it\nhappened there. It changed my life. I -- It went on for three days, and wherever I went, I\ntalked with people, and they talked to me, and I got to tell you funny thing, that people\nnever stopped talking, and they couldn\u2019t get enough of telling what happened to them, as\nif they had never -- as if -- as if they had never told it to anyone, you know. Or maybe\nthey didn\u2019t. It was -- It was so bad, I stood in the men\u2019s room next to a guy -- next -- the -\n- the guy next to me in the urinal said to me, \u201cSo, where were you in hiding?\u201d And I said\nin Holland. I said, \u201cSo where were you in hiding?\u201d He said, \u201cI was in Poland.\u201d And we\ntalked while we peed. And even there, you didn\u2019t stop talking with -- and -- and\n[indecipherable] what happened to me, and then we zipped up, and then we talked some\nmore outside. It was astounding. It was an astounding experience. And when it was over,\nthree days later, we left, and it was as if I had suddenly acquired, you know, like 1600\nsisters and brothers. I didn\u2019t want to leave. Nobody wanted to leave. There were people\nsitting downstairs in the lobby that -- that cried because it was over. When you ask people\ntoday, who were at that conference, they all remember it exactly. I was there. I\nexperienced it. It was as if the door suddenly opened, after 50 years. It was as if we were\nsuddenly allowed to remember. Anyway, I went home, it was very strange, as -- the car\nwas in the garage downstairs, as I drove out, an enormous thunderstorm broke out over\nManhattan. The sky was blue with lightning every second, and the rain poured down, and\nit thundered b-between those buildings, it sounded -- it was like hell had broken loose, it\nwas like God himself sort of thundered out on -- on us for -- you know, it was very\nstrange. Got home, started reading every -- every book, every pamphlet, every story I\ncould lay my hands on. And my life changed. It -- It\u2019s never been the same. I became a\nspeaker, became an interviewer for a -- Spielberg\u2019s Shoah Foundation. I -- I\u2019m a-about\nthe best speaker they have of the Hidden Child Foundation. I spoke last month at the\ncommemoration at the Supreme Court of New York state, to the judges and the lawyers.\nIt\u2019s -- All this happened after that day. So --",
        "A: Yes, of course I have, and there\u2019s all sorts of theories about it. If you ask Carla, who is\na Social Worker, and who psychologically knows much more than I do, you heard her\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nsay earlier, when we were talking about it, briefly, about needing four decades to -- to be\nable to talk about it, but that -- that still doesn\u2019t -- I still don\u2019t understand. But th-the\nexperience is -- I\u2019m not the only one. There are so many who said -- I\u2019ve interviewed\npeople myself, not hidden children, but the camp survivors, who said, \u201cAh, Mr. Lessing,\nthis is the first time that I will be speaking about it. I\u2019ve never spoken about it like this\nwith anyone else.\u201d What is it? I don\u2019t know. I -- I -- Really, I\u2019m stupid, as far as that\u2019s\nconcerned, I have -- I have no idea why it took 50 years for me, but it -- for me there was\na definite epiphany, that -- that moment there, I could look, I could take you to the place\non that floor in the Marriott Marquis on Times Square, and say, here\u2019s where I stood.\nHere is where suddenly everything changed. No, no, come back in another 10 years,\nmaybe Ill have an answer. Maybe Carla had an answer, I\u2019m not quite sure. Anyway, I\nbecame quite active, slowly, not -- not immediately, but Carla, of course, had the --\nbecame vice-president of The Hidden Child Foundation, and I -- I began to -- and she\nformed a group here in Westchester, and I decided that my forte was maybe writing some\nthings, I have written little pieces, and I began to write a newsletter, every month I write a\nnewsletter, there\u2019s only two pages, but I love to write a little editorial for it, and I\u2019ve\nwritten those, and -- and then later I started a newsletter, same thing, two page newsletter\nfor The Hidden Child Foundation in New York, and that has a circulation of about 3,000\npeople, and that goes around, you know, the -- the whole New York region. That\u2019s my\ninvolvement, and the speaking -- the speaking involvement is much more intense. I spoke\nto, I don\u2019t know, maybe 15 - 20 places this -- during the Holocaust commemoration\nseason, you know, these -- these speech days come in seasons. Anyway, that was one --\none thing that changed my life. Now, I got to go to something very important. That was\nin 19 -- was that 1990, or 1991, the big [inaudible] 1991 -- 1981, I think. In 1982, there\nwas a decision that in -- of the Dutch Jews, that they would hold a conference for hidden\nchildren in Amsterdam. And of course we were invited to come, and of course we\ndecided, you know, we were hidden children from Holland, so Carla and I decided yes,\nwe will go there. Okay, tickets, airline tickets and so on, so forth, and -- about two\nmonths before -- about two months er -- before the conference, I decided that -- are you\ncomfortable? You could lean back, maybe, if that\u2019s easier for you.",
        "A: Are you okay?",
        "A: About a month and a half, or two months before conference in Amsterdam, I suddenly\ndecided that I had actually never said enough -- given enough thanks to one man in\nHolland, who had helped me save my life. I don\u2019t know if you remember I talked to you\nabout a police officer, Oskam, a great model of a naz -- Dutch Nazi, but he was really a\nwonderful guy. I thought, I wonder if Oskam is still li -- I didn\u2019t know his name. I\nwonder if that police officer is still alive. And I couldn\u2019t find his name in my mind. I\nasked my brother Fred, who did all the interviews, he said, \u201cYeah, something like\nBoscamp, or something like that.\u201d Anyway, I sent a letter to the Bureau of War dec --\ndocumentation in Amsterdam, and said -- described the hut where I had been, and\ndescribed Oskam, and I sent a little picture, a little photograph of Oskam, his wife, and\ntheir son, who was then three and a half, four years old, and sent it off to war document --\nand asked them, is Mr. Oskam -- Mr. Boscamp, or whatever his name 1s still alive, and I\ndescribed him. And I got a letter back that said, \u201cNo, we\u2019re sorry, but that gentleman has\ndied, and so -- his wife has also died. But his son, Oskam junior is still alive, and he\u2019s a\nretired plumber, and we sent your letter with the photograph, on to him.\u201d So I got a letter\nback from Oskam, junior. And he said, \u201cMr. Lessing, I don\u2019t know who you are, but I\u2019m\nvery grateful for the little photograph you sent me, I\u2019ve never seen that photograph.\u201d Of\ncourse he hadn\u2019t, because I had taken it just before I left for the United States. And he\nsaid, \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d And I said to him, \u201cI\u2019m sorry your father died, but I would\nlike to, when I come to Holland for the conference, I would like to get together with you,\nand talk about your father, he -- who saved my life, you know.\u201d And I got a letter back\nfrom him, it said, \u201cWell listen, I was only four -- four, four and a half years old, and I\ndon\u2019t know much. My father was a very closed man. I -- I don\u2019t know what to -- what I\ncould tell you.\u201d And I said, \u201cI don\u2019t really care, but I would like to find out a little bit\nabout your father, who was he, what -- what background did he come from.\u201d Suddenly, I\n-- it had to do with the whole hidden children business, too. Suddenly I decided I must\nfind out about what happened to me. I must find out what happened to all the Jews during\nthe Holocaust, and here was a chance. So I wrote to him, we\u2019re coming to Holland, and\ncan we meet with you. And he said, \u201cYeah, okay. I don\u2019t know what I can do for you, but\nokay.\u201d We go on the plane, and we are 10 minutes away from Amsterdam airport\nSchiphol, and the captain comes on. As they always do, it\u2019s, \u201cLadies and gentlemen,\nthank you for flying KLM, we\u2019ll be landing in 10 minutes in Schiphol, and don\u2019t forget\nany of your stuff,\u201d whatever, you know. And I burst out in crying -- crying, next to Carla.\nI\u2019m sobbing sitting there. She said, \u201c\u201cWhat happened, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d I said, \u201cThis\nshit makes no sense at all, but when we land, when this plane land in Schiphol, I see at\nthe end of the runway, there\u2019s a line of black trucks, with SS, waiting for me, and they\nwill kill me.\u201d A direct remembrance of the morning of the raid in the woods. And she\nsaid, \u201cWell, you know that that\u2019s not true.\u201d I said, \u201cI know that\u2019s not true,\u201d but that\u2019s how\nI felt it. It was like -- It was like I was right back there, you know? Well, we wer -- We\nlanded, of course, and my cousin was there with her little blue Honda, and of course the\nSS disappeared from my mind. Anyway, the next day we meet Oskams, junior. By this\ntime I found out the name is Oskam, not Boscamp, and Oskam ju -- Oskam junior, who\ndoesn\u2019t look at all like his father, but he looks like his mother, you know, have a round\nface, and round body, and very jolly guy, and he\u2019s a retired plumber, and then we meet\nhim in this tiny little doll\u2019s house, like they have in Holland. The whole house fits about\nin this -- in this room, you know? And they have the coffee, and the cake, as always in\nHolland, you know, you have to eat coffee, and you know, and big cakes with great\nalmond paste in it, lovely. And we sitting down, and we meet his wife, and -- so he said,\n\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d I said, \u201cWell I -- I didn\u2019t know who your father was, really,\nbecause it was all so secret.\u201d And he tells me a little bit about his father, and it comes out\nthat Oskam came from a family of all Nazis, Dutch Nazis, and bad ones, anti-Semites.\nPeople who tried to discover where Jews were hidden, and found them, and -- and\ndenounced them to the Germans. The worst. The whole family was one big heap of\ngarbage, you know? He was the only good one. But because the whole family was so\nbad, his reputation was -- was bad -- for the Germans was excellent, because he came\nfrom this virulent Nazi family, they thought he was so too, and when -- when I show you\na picture of him, he looks like it, like a Nazi in black uniform, and everything. He was a\ngood man. Anyway, we\u2019re talking, and he tells me about this br -- his father, and then --\nand then I said, \u201cListen, did you know there was a hut in the woods not far from here?\u201d\nAnd he said, \u201cYes, I -- I knew that, my father told me that.\u201d I said, \u201cDid you know who\nwas in the hut?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t know. My father didn\u2019t tell me too much about it.\u201d\nI said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t know that I was in there?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, I -- I don\u2019t.\u201d He said to me,\n\u201cWhy are you asking me these questions?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I had this crazy idea,\u201d -- all this\ncomes after the revelations in 1991, the conference. I -- I had to find out everything now.\nI said, \u201cI thought if maybe there were a group of men in there, and I probably saw them\nfor the last time when they were alive. And I thought maybe a brother or a sister, or\nmaybe even a father or a mother might still be alive, and I could tell them at least, for that\nlast morning, when we ran into the hut and warned them, and,\u201d -- and he\u2019s listening to\nme, and he says to me, \u201cBut Mr. Lessing, I just want to tell you something wrong with\nyour story.\u201d Is -- And I thought, \u201cWhat the hell does he know? He was four years old at\nthe time.\u201d I-I -- I said, \u201cWhat do you mean there\u2019s something wrong with my story?\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know much what happened there,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I know one thing.\nNobody was arrested that morning. They all escaped.\u201d Now, you\u2019ve got to realize, for 50\nyears I have lived with the idea, on and off, not every day, not every week, but at least\nonce a month, I would think about the morning of the raid on the hut, and how we\nstormed in, my buddy and I, and warned the men, and pulled the blankets off them, and\nshouted, \u201cIt\u2019s a raid, it\u2019s the SS, get up, the Germans are here.\u201d And then, when we saw\nthat they were all up and out and awake, we fled. And always the question came up, we\nshould have stayed, maybe. We should have stayed with them, helped them more. But\nthen it went in my mind, then, not the seven that were there, but we would have been\ncaught, too, and we\u2019d have been killed. This way, there were seven killed, at least two\nescaped. And that went on through the years, this feeling of guilt that we -- I didn\u2019t stay\nlong enough. I should have spent more time there. I -- I -- So what? I might have been\nkilled with them, but -- but then that didn\u2019t make any sense. We did warn them, and you\nknow, and we did our best, and so we couldn\u2019t help it, you know, this kind of stuff. And\nhere this man tells me they all escaped. So instead of being guilty of maybe not doing\nenough, it now comes out, I\u2019ve actually saved their lives, or helped save their lives. So, I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ncome out of that conference with this man -- this man, and my cousin is there, and she\nsays, \u201cSo, how was it?\u201d I said, \u201cYou can\u2019t -- I can\u2019t believe this. The men whom I\nthought were killed, all survived.\u201d \u201cGod,\u201d she says, \u201cthat\u2019s amazing. Who were they?\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cHe didn\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know either.\u201d By the way, I should backtrack for one\nsecond. At the beginning of the conference of my talk -- it is not a conference, but a talk\nwith -- with Oskam junior, he said, \u201cMr. Lessing, I went into the basement to see if\nthere\u2019s anything I could find on my father, and you know, there were thousands of paper\nmy father had gathered through the years. They were all the old tickets that he had given\nto people,\u201d you know, where you don\u2019t have a -- you don\u2019t have a na -- an a -- license\nplate in the back of your car, or people didn\u2019t have a | -- a light on the front of their\nbicycle, and there were thousands of those tickets, or copies of tickets. And he said, \u201cI\nthrew all those away. I saved a few things,\u201d and he came up with a picture. \u201cBut,\u201d he\nsays, \u201cI have something here, and it had -- was sent to my father by your mother.\u201d I said,\n\u201cMy mother? From where?\u201d He says, \u201cI don\u2019t know. It looks like from Africa someplace.\nAlgiers?\u201d He fishes out -- now this is 1992 I\u2019m talking about, so it\u2019s seven years ago, he\ndigs out of there a postcard sent by my mother, to his father, saying that she came out of\nBergen-Belsen, she doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s the mat -- what -- what happened to her\nhusband and s -- and her -- and her three sons. She wonder if they\u2019re still alive. Would he\nknow something more? And he hands me this postcard, it was like a postcard you get\nafter somebody dies, and it reaches you. It wasn\u2019t addressed to me, but it was my\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nmother\u2019s, she had written it, you know? She had typed it on the office typewriter there. I\nhave it here. That\u2019s how it started out already. He says, \u201cThis something that interests\nyou?\u201d I said, \u201c\u201cWhat do you mean it interests me? This is from my mother. She sent it\nafter she came out of Bergen-Belsen, she,\u201d -- I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s amazing, anyway. You\nsee, life was full of surprises, and -- so anyway, as I said, my cousin said, \u201cDo you know\nwho was in the c -- in -- in that hut?\u2019 I said no. She said to me, \u201cYou know, there\u2019s a\nradio program on here, comes on once a week, on Friday morning, it\u2019s called Address\nUnknown, goes on the Catholic radio station, and they interview people, there\u2019s a guy\nwho interviews people, and -- who are sic -- looking for people they have lost years ago.\u201d\nI said, \u201cYeah, well, you know, I lost people 50 years ago. Sh -- Who the hell would\nknow?\u201d And she said, \u201cOh, you could try.\u201d So I call up the radio station, and I got a -- got\nthe producer on the phone, and -- very nice lady, and she said -- I told -- I told her a little\nbit about this story, and she said, \u201cThat\u2019s a fascinating story, Mr. Lessing. Are you going\nto be here next month?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I -- I\u2019m here just for a conference, I\u2019m -- got to go\nback to the United States.\u201d And, she said, \u201cAh, that\u2019s too bad, because it takes us about a\nmonth to put program together, you know. We have already,\u201d and so on, so forth. You\nprobably know all about this, and -- okay, we went to the conference -- there\u2019s something\nelse I didn\u2019t tell you, and I should tell you about it. I don\u2019t --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A: I said, \u201cNo, I have to go back to the United States.\u201d And we went to the conference.\nWe went to visit a lady in Brussels who was -- played a part in a friend of mine\u2019s life, and\n-- which I haven\u2019t told you about, and I sort of should backtrack on that later, because it\u2019s\nan important part also, what happened to me. Anyway, we go to the conference, we come\nback to my cousin again, who lives in the center of Holland. She lives, by the way, very\nclose to where I had been in hiding in the -- in the hut, and where Oskam junior lives,\nthat\u2019s all around Utrecht, the area they\u2019re in now. So, she says, \u201cCall the radio station,\nthey\u2019ve been calling here all -- all -- all the time.\u201d So I call them up, I get the producer\nupon the phone. \u201cYeah, Mr. Lessing, we -- we -- we decided that your story is so\nfascinating. Could you come next Friday morning?\u201d I said, \u201cSure.\u201d So, Friday morning\nvery early, Carla and I went to the radio station, and my cousin went also with us, and --\nand I said to my -- said, \u201cCarla,\u201d I said, \u201cthis is a waste of time,\u201d sit -- sitting there talking\nabout something that happened 50 years ago, who the hell would remember an obscure\nhut in an obscure piece of wood somewhere in an obscure little village?\u201d You\u2019re going to\nget that on. So -- But we were there, and there\u2019s a guy, he was sort of like -- you could\nsay a little bit like, oh, the Letterman of the -- of the Dutch air waves, a very popular\nman. Hans Frombilihamber, Hans Frombilihamber, should put his name in here. And\nHans seats me there, sits me down, and this is an hour program. They make a break after\nthe half hour, and then they gave our telephone number, and then people can call in if\nthey have any -- have any [indecipherable]. Anyway, he interviews me, and I tell him the\nstory about the hiding in the woods, and the -- the raid, and I tell him about finding\nOskam junior back, and about the terrible surprise, or the wonderful surprise, to find out\nthat I didn\u2019t -- what say -- did do enough, that I helped those people -- to save seven\npeople, to save their lives, and -- and -- and he makes a break, and they play some music,\nand then the program goes on, and at the end, he says, \u201cWell, thank you very much,\u201d and\nhe -- \u201cPll show you where we have the telephone.\u201d So we go back to a room, and they\nhave a dozen telephones there, and they have six people. And they do this every week, by\nthe way, it\u2019s been going on for years. There\u2019s six people, they take the telephone calls,\nand they write on slips whatever call comes in. And so, I come there, and these dozen\nphones are ringing off the hook. And they\u2019ve got a little stack of slips already this big.\nAnd they ask me, you know, as it goes on, as they\u2019re writing it, \u201cIs this something?\u201d And\nthey hold it in front of me. And there was very strange things. There\u2019s a -- \u201cYes, my --\nmy sister was in there, in the hut with a dog,\u201d You know, I -- there\u2019s all kinds of stupid\nthings. But, there was one -- th-there were several that were very interesting, one -- once -\n- one was -- said, \u201cMy brother was with you 1n the hut, but he is -- doesn\u2019t live here any\nmore in Holland, he 1 -- lives now in Indonesia, and he -- I\u2019m sure he would love to hear\nfrom you.\u201d His name on -- Herman Mueninghof. Okay, I don\u2019t know Herman\nMueninghof, you know, but might be true. And a little later, another message comes 1n, it\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nsays, \u201cI was with you in the hut, and I\u2019m listening to this broadcast, and I live right\naround the corner from the radio station. Please come and visit me afterwards.\u201d Lou\nFontichilin. I don\u2019t know Lou Fontichilin, but it says he was there. So anyway, we got --\nthe phone keeps on ringing, and finla -- finally it dies down, and -- and I got this big stack\nof p-pieces of paper, and they -- not only -- that -- that\u2019s not where it stops for them, any\nmessages that are important, they research, no matter where they are. They go all over the\nworld, find these people, and make contact with them. Okay, so it was wonderful. We get\ninto my cousin\u2019s little blue Honda, and we go around the corner, and I ring the door of an\napartment house, and this huge woman comes out, and throws her arms around me, and\nsays, \u201cEddie, I didn\u2019t think you would make it.\u201d I said, \u201c\u201cWho are you?\u201d She said, \u201cDon\u2019t\nyou remember me?\u201d I said, \u201cNo.\u201d She says, \u201cMy name was Perk.\u201d Her secret name was\nPerk during the war, \u201cBut,\u201d she says, \u201cI kept it. Cut me -- Call me Perk Fontichilar. And I\nremember you very well,\u201d she says. \u201cI used to be courier for the underground.\u201d Vaguely I\nbegan to remember something. She says, \u201cCome, Lou wants to meet you.\u201d Leads me into\nthe living room, and there\u2019s an old man sitting, with white hair, but I immediately\nrecognized him as one of the men I had left behind that morning. Ah, we cried, and we\nhugged, and we did, and -- I tell you, it was like -- couldn\u2019t believe it, that all this was\nhappening. Well, finally we settled down, and his wife brought some coffee, of course,\nand -- and we talked about the morning, and he said he ran away in his pajamas, and --\nand without shoes, and everyone managed to get out. I said, \u201cLou, who were the people\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwho were in the hut?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, I have some photographs that I took in the\nhut.\u201d I said, \u201cYou do?\u201d He said, \u201cYes, Pll show you.\u201d And he -- his wife brought out a\nbox of photographs, and there was photographs with all the men in the hut, and not only\nthat, but also the Canadian, and the Englishman, the flyers from the RAF on there. But I\nwasn\u2019t on there. And he said, \u201cBut I also have a picture of you.\u201d I says, \u201cYou do?\u201d And\nyes, and he came out with a photograph of -- of me standing in the hut, cynical young\nman.",
        "A: Well, what you\u2019re seeing here is -- looking at the bunk beds, the upright posts are\nmade from pine trees that were cut by the men, and you can see there\u2019s an upper bunk,\nsomebody\u2019s si-sitting on there eating a sandwich, and there\u2019s a lower bunk, where\nsomebody\u2019s eating an apple, or something like that, and I\u2019m leaning against one of the\nposts of the bed, in shorts, and a woolen jacket, and I\u2019m looking directly into the camera.\nI\u2019m the -- this man that I was talking with, had taken this photograph. It was taken in the\nfall of 1943, before the hut was raided. Now, I said to Lou -- and he described all the\nmen, and their names. So now I knew who had been in the hut. And then I ask him the\nfinal question, I said, \u201cLou, everything is revealed except one thing. Who was my buddy,\nwho was my partner that morning, who stood guard with me that morning, who escaped?\nWho was the man who my mother gave her bicycle to, and -- and the flashlight?\u201d And he\nsaid, \u201cI don\u2019t know, don\u2019t you know?\u201d I said, \u201cNo.\u201d He said, \u201cDon\u2019t you remember\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nanything of him?\u201d I said, \u201cI seem to remember a man who was a shoemaker in the regular\nlife.\u201d\u2019 And he said, \u201c\u201cOh, well, he wasn\u2019t a shoemaker, his father was a shoemaker, and his\nname was,\u201d -- I said, \u201c\u201cWhat was his name?\u201d He says, \u201cHis name was Jan Carman, Jan\nCarman.\u201d So now I knew who had been my buddy. I said, \u201cWhere is he, what happened\nto him?\u201d He said, \u201cEd, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re -- it can be, because Jan Carman was with me\nthat morning. We fled together.\u201d I said, \u201cLou, it can\u2019t be, he was with me. I think your\nmemory must be mixed up.\u201d He said, \u201cWell, maybe it is, you know, it\u2019s years ago, and\nI\u2019m old, and,\u201d -- I said, \u201cWhat happened to Jan Carman?\u201d He said, \u201cHe was with me\nthree weeks later, we were raided in -- in unrelated raid on a house with Jews, and he was\n-- he was taken, and he was executed in the dunes. And he 1s buried in the cemetery for\nthe martyrs, the -- of the Resistance, in Holland.\u201d So the picture changed again. The man\nwho were de -- who I thought were dead, were -- had -- had lived, the two who had\nescaped, one -- one had been caught, and was -- was executed. So, with that, I went one\nmore -- once more back with -- with Oskam junior, to the place where the hut had been.\nAnd then I knew 50 years had gone by, because where there had been an impenetrable\nwood of young pine trees, now there was a forest you could look right through, with tall\npine trees, and you could walk right through it. It poured that morning. It rained cats and\ndogs. I had a yellow slicker, and one of these plastic coats over me, and it poured, it was\na dismal day. And we went to where the hut had been, and the only thing there was was a\nslight depression in the ground. I tried to find a splinter of wood, a little piece of glass,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nsomething to take back, and there was nothing. And then finally he took me to the edge\nof the wood, where I stood that morning and watched the Germans come, and I stood\nthere in the rain, and they distanced themselve a little bit -- there was some more people\nthere. There were people from the -- the -- the nursing home next door. Anyway -- and I\nstood there, at the same place where I had stood that -- you know. And you know, it\u2019s\nweird, and it sound very dramatic, but it -- I stood there, and it was almost as if I could\nhear tires coming up again, up on the road. It was scary, it was scary being there. Must\nhave been a little bit like Holocaust survivors going back to Auschwitz, you know\u2019?\nAnyway, there is -- there\u2019s too much to tell, because it\u2019s all in little details, there -- the\nones who had given us food during the days when we were in the hut, were the nuns next\ndoor. Next to the wood was a fence, and then next to that, there was a -- what do they call\nthat, where nuns live?",
        "A: The convent. And the sisters at the convent, every day put food next to the fence, and\nwe had cut a hole in it, and I would -- was one of the persons who was designated to\nbring the food to the hut. In the meantime, it had been converted from a convent to a\nnursing home for older nuns, and for other Catholics, and these people had heard the\nbroadcast. They had never known what had happened next door to them. And so, I was\ninvited to come to there, and we did that, and then I met some people who had been --\nthat same day had been incarcerated by the SS, who had just been caught hanging around.\nThe gardener, for instance, of the grounds of the convent had been -- he had come to see\nwhat was going on, he was thrown in jail. The Mother Superior, they had knocked on the\ndoor of the convent, and when she opened the door, they said, \u201c\u201cWe want to come in,\u201d and\n-- the SS said, and she had said, \u201cYou have nothing to li -- look for here,\u201d and they\nSlapped her in the face, and she fell on the ground, and they walked right over her, and\nthrew her in jail for three months, also. And Oskam, the policeman, was found walking\naround with a gun, which he was allowed to have, but in civilian clothes, because he had\nheard about the raid. And they took him in for awhile, he came back three weeks later,\nemaciated, and beaten up, and all this stuff was coming out of what had happened that\nday. Anyway, it was time to go back to the United States. I came -- I had -- I had a bunch\nof photographs from Lou, and I had made a whole slew of new friends from the radio\nstation, and -- and from, you know, the people, and it was all wonderful. And so Carla\nand I went back, and I settled down here, in this room, and I\u2019m sitting right here working,\nin December, 1992, I get a call. \u201cHi, this is Hans Frontikel in Holland, from the radio\nstation, remember me, I\u2019m -- I interviewed you?\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, how you doing, Hans?\u201d\n\u2018Fine. I wonder if you could come to Holland, I have a TV program, and we\u2019re going to\ndo a half an hour on the -- the Dutch Resistance, and also about the Jewish persecution,\nand I thought you, being involved in both, maybe I could interview you again, but now\non television.\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, well that\u2019s very nice, but I don\u2019t have a budget to go for 20\nminutes to Amsterdam.\u201d \u201cOh no,\u201d he said, \u201cwe pay your flight, and we pay your hotelsand everything.\u201d I said, \u201cI'll be there.\u201d And so all of a sudden I found myself back in s --\nin December, and this is what happened. H-Hans, my interviewer send his -- wh-what is\nit called, his -- the guy you -- an -- an editor. Tall guy, and he said, \u201cEd, I would like to\ngo over the story once more with you, just quickly, for the interview, the day after\ntomorrow.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d I said, \u201cFirst of all,\u201d -- no, I -- I -- I -- I said, \u201cOkay, but,\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cyou know the story.\u201d \u201cYeah, we sed -- like to -- tell me a little bit shortly, again.\u201d\nAnd so I said, \u201cWell,\u201d [indecipherable], it was in the camp, and [indecipherable] you\nknow, and we got raided, and I was -- was out with a buddy, and\u201d -- and he said, \u201cDo you\nknow who your buddy was?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t know in August, but now I\u2019ve heard\nthat it was a cert -- a -- a certain Jan Carman.\u201d And they said, \u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d\nAnd he said -- I -- I -- Is -- I said, \u201c\u201cHe was shot in the dunes. He 1s buried, and,\u201d I said, \u201cI\nvisited his grave yesterday.\u201d I had in the mean time, gone to the graveyard of the\nResistance people, and there I cried over Jan\u2019s grave, and -- and -- Tong was his name,\nTong, the editor. He said, \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, \u201cnow, the day after tomorrow, Ill come and\npick you up, and first we\u2019ll go to the museum of the Dutch Resistance.\u201d I said, \u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cwell, I want to show you a film there, and,\u201d -- okay. So, we went there,\nand I sat there, and this was in the former synagogue, and so I sat there, and I watched\nthis film, which seemed like an old film, it didn\u2019t seem -- I said, \u201c\u201cWhy are you showing\nme this?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI was told to do this,\u201d and I couldn\u2019t figure it out, you know?\nAnyway, when it was over, we went to the TV studio, and there on the set was a nice\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthick couch, and on the end of the couch was a little Christmas tree, cause the program\nwas going to be aired on -- on Christmas day. And it was a live audience. Oskam junior\nand his wife was there, and my cousin with her husband were there, and as -- my second\ncousin from -- from The Hague come over. And I was alone, Carla hadn\u2019t come with me\nya -- you know. So, the lights went on, and there was Hans with a nice Christmas tie, and\nme, in little -- nice little Jewish boy, sitting next to a Christmas tree. So, by then I had\nbeen on TV a couple of times, and I had some idea, you know, I was here on channel 13,\nand I\u2019ve been there with CNBC, and a couple other places, and -- and so I sort of knew\nwhat the routine was, you know, and the interviewer asks the questions, and you give the\nright answers, you know, and don\u2019t embarrass anybody, and you don\u2019t be idiot, you\nknow. So, he said, \u201cMr. Lessing, many will remember you from this summer, when I\ninterviewed you on radio, but now here you are again, and I want to ask you a few\nquestions.\u201d And so he asked me where I was during the war. I said I was in hiding. And\nwhere were you in hiding? I -- Well, I was, among other places, was in this hut. And what\nhappened? Well, we were raided. And -- And the interview went along fine, you know,\nstandardized. By then I got a little bit, shall I say, blas\u00a2\u00e9 about the whole thing, you know\u201d?\nBut it was fun to be there, and -- and he said, \u201cSo, Mr. Lessing, what happened?\u201d I said,\n\u201cWell, we stood guard, a buddy of mine, and -- and -- and I, and we happened to see the\nGermans coming, and we went back and warned the others, and,\u201d -- he said, \u201cDo you\nknow who your buddy was?\u201d I said, \u201cWell yes, he is Jan Carman, and he -- I visited his\ngrave yesterday, and he got executed by the Germans, near the dunes in Holland.\u201d And\nthen he said something that did not fit in the thing, and he said, \u201cMr. Lessing, I want to\ntell you that we have received a part of a diary of the man -- your buddy, your partner\nwho stood guard with you that morning, describing that morning, the raid, and\neverything, just like you tell it.\u201d And I thought for a second, and I thought, he is wrong,\nthat can\u2019t be. Cause Jan Carman\u2019s date on his grave says he was -- he was executed in\nFebruary, 1945 -- 1944, and we were raided on the 29\" of December, 1943. There had\nonly been a couple of weeks in between, and he was on the run all the time, I knew that\nfrom Lou. So I thought this -- something -- something is screwed up here, and -- but, you\nknow, live audience, you\u2019re not going to -- so I said, \u201cOh.\u201d And then he said something\nthat really chilled me to the bone. He said, \u201cMr. Lessing, I want to tell you that the man\nwho was with you that morning, who stood guard with you then, was here -- is here to\ntalk with you.\u201d And I became ice cold, and I thought, I just visited his grave, and the dead\ndon\u2019t rise from the grave, and -- and he is so fucked up here, you know with this, I\u2019m\nsorry, excuse my language, but I didn\u2019t know what to think. And a light went on on the\nfar end of the stage, and this man walks out, tall man, who I\u2019d seen in the photographs,\nwho was described to me as the man who lived in Indonesia. And out walks this man,\nHerman Mueninghof. And he walks over to me, and he grabs my hand, and he said,\n\u201cEddie, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re alive.\u201d And I said, \u201cHerman, it\u2019s wonderful.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat\nare you doing here?\u201d He said, \u201cThe TV people brought me here.\u201d I said, \u201cAll the way\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nfrom Indonesia?\u201d I said, \u201cWhat do you do there?\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m a Catholic bishop, and I\nlive in New Guinea.\u201d I said, \u201cBut why are you here?\u201d He said, \u201cThey wanted me to meet\nyou.\u201d I said, \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful,\u201d I said. He said, \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to remember that --\nhow we stood guard together that morning. You don\u2019t -- don\u2019t you remember how we --\nhow your mother saved our lives? How your mother, that night, gave me her bicycle, and\nthe flashlight?\u201d And all of a sudden I realized I was wrong. It -- It wasn\u2019t the other man,\nit was this man, this bishop, this Catholic bishop, Herman Mueninghof. And again the\npicture changed. The -- Again we -- the two of -- two of us had survived, and the others\nhad survived also, the only one who had not survived was this poor Jan Carman, who had\nbeen in the hut, who I had remembered vaguely. And we talked, and we cried, and this\njust -- I said -- he said to me, \u201cYour mother saved -- saved our lives.\u201d I said, \u201cYes, I\nknow.\u201d He said, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d I said, \u201c\u201cWhat do you mean I don\u2019t?\u201d He said, \u201cDo you\nremember how your mother gave me her bike, and a little flashlight?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, I do\nremember. You went out, you -- you pedaled away in -- in the darkness.\u201d He said, \u201cI\nhadn\u2019t gone more than two minutes away when a German sprang out in the middle of --\nof the road -- the path, and said, halt, get off the bike, stand against the wall.\u201d There was a\nlittle pumphouse there. He said, \u201cAnd I stood against the wall, with my face to the wall,\nand he frisked me from top to bottom, to feel if I had any weapons. If your mother hadn\u2019t\ntold us to bury the weapons that we had, our -- our nine millimeter Mausers,\u201d he said,\n\u201cthey would have shot me, probably, on -- on the spot.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat happened then?\u201d\nHe said, \u201cI don\u2019t know where I got the guts, but I said, what are you doing? Why are you\nstopping me like this?\u201d And the German said, \u201cI know you\u2019re one of these -- these\nterrorists from the hut.\u201d And Herman said, \u201cWhat hut? I don\u2019t know any hut. What are\nyou talking about?\u201d And he said, \u201cYes, don\u2019t deny it, you\u2019re one of the terrorists from the\nhut. We have orders to arrest you all, and we\u2019ll get you.\u201d He said, \u201cI have no idea what\ny, -- he said, \u201cI come from night school.\u201d He says, \u201cYou come from night school, what?\nWhere night school?\u201d He says, \u201cI come from night school in Zeist, and,\u201d -- he said,\n\u201cWhat are you studying there?\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m studying to be a Notary Public,\u201d which was\ntrue, Herman was studying to be a Notary Public. And he said -- and he said, \u201cI felt that\nthe guy, what he really wanted, was the little flashlight.\u201d Now this wasn\u2019t an ordinary\nflashlight, 1t was something that was worth gold in the last -- in -- during the war. It was\nmade by Philips. It was a little hand generator, you squeezed it, and 1t made light. And in\na time that there were absolutely no batteries any more, these things were worth gold.\nPeople would buy -- pay hundreds of gilders to get one. And the guy wanted this, you\nknow, it was worth something to him. And Herman was very smart, he says, \u201cI thought\nthat if he arrested me, he would have to hand everything over to his superior officer, but\nif he let me go, he could keep the flashlight. So he -- I said to him, give me the bike, the\nbike is no good to you, it\u2019s solid tires.\u201d He said, \u201cWhat I -- M-My mother is waiting with\ndinner, you know.\u201d And he said, \u201cI could see the guy thinking, and then he said, \u201cNah,\nalza gazie, go.\u201d And he said, \u201cI got on the bike, and I pedaled away. And if it hadn\u2019t beenfor your mother telling us to drop the weapons and bury them,\u201d he says, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be\nhere.\u201d Another surprise. There was no end to the -- to the surprises.",
        "A: Wh-What about it?",
        "A: It\u2019s a little bit like being hungry, and never really having enough to eat. It\u2019s a weird\nthing to say, I guess. I am daily still trying to find out what happened, not exactly to me,\nbut what happened to -- to the Dutch Jews. I read articles, I -- my cousin send -- the same\ncousin with her little blue Honda, sends me, almost weekly, articles from the Dutch\nnewspapers describing the things that had happened in Holland. The money that\u2019s\nmissing, the paintings that were stolen. The -- The archive of -- of -- of -- of name cards\nthat was found recently, abandoned by the Dutch government, somewhere in -- in it -- on\nthe third floor. All these things still are filling out my picture of what happened in\nHolland, to the Dutch Jews. Every new book that comes out, I immediately buy, and they\nsend me from Holland, in Dutch, or whatever. That story seems to never be completely\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ncomplete. There\u2019s always new -- seem to be new little things coming out. Because it\u2019s\nimpossible to remember two and a half years, every minute of it. So, I found out some of\nthe things, and -- and -- but there\u2019s still the desire to find out exactly where was I, what\ndid I think, what happened? It\u2019s an ongoing thing, it will go on til the end of my life now,\nbecause the -- the -- the clarific -- it -- 1t\u2019s like -- it\u2019s like troubled water that slowly\nbecomes clarified, more and more and more and more, who we were then, what we were,\nwhat we did, why did I do this, why did I? So, that\u2019s the best that I can tell you, it -- itis a\nneed to find out, still. And it all started in that God damn moment there, on that seventh\nfloor of that hotel. It all started there. It\u2019s very strange. It was time to go home. I got on\nthe plane, very, very tired, because so much has been revealed to me now again. And I\ngot back to JFK, to the JFK airport in New York, and Carla was waiting for me there.\nAnd she said, \u201cWell, how did it go?\u201d I said, \u201cI got to tell you something. It\u2019s very strange,\nbut for a Jewish boy like me, has now ha -- I have a friend who 1s a Catholic bishop in\nNew Guinea, in Indonesia.\u201d I subsequently asked Herman to send me the complete diary,\nand when I got it there were pages missing. And I send him a letter, and I said -- I call\nhim Herman, I don\u2019t -- don\u2019t call him Your Holiness, or Your Worship, or whatever. Or\nbishop. And I said, \u201cHerman, where are the pa -- missing pages, again?\u201d He said, \u201cThere\nwere things in there that were not so nice.\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t care. I want -- would like to\nknow.\u201d And he send me the pages. There were remarks made by the members of the\nResistance in the hut, about Jews not being reliable enough, you couldn\u2019t trust them with\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nyour life. I mean, this is -- this is ironic. They had this 17 year old Jewish kid, he was not\nin the Resistance, he was just in hiding. They didn\u2019t really want him in the hut, but\nOskam, who was very influence -- influential in that area for the Resistance, and he was\npivotal for them, had asked them to take in this Jewish kid, and so they had to take him\nin. But it wasn\u2019t -- there were several members who said, \u201cWell, we ca -- we can\u2019t really\ntrust him, you know?\u201d What is so superiorally ironic is that I later on saved the God damn\nlives of these men. I mean, it\u2019s interesting how things evolve. Let me see. You don\u2019t want\nto go forever with this -- with this -- are you running out of tape?",
        "A: Okay, then let\u2019s -- this is a good --\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "A: They say that in the -- in the first World War, I guess, that in the trenches, every --\nevery soldier becomes religious, and prays. And in a sense that\u2019s, I guess, what happened\nto me. And my mother would have certainly approved of it when I s -- when I said that --\nI promised God that I would try to keep his -- the laws he had given to Moses on Mount\nSinai, and in the desert, that I would follow them all my life, if he would just spare my\nfamily. And they survived. And I held on for years afterward, in this country, I would -- I\nhad my own kind of Jewish religion. On Yom Kippur, I would take a prayer book -- no, I\nwouldn\u2019t -- not -- not a prayer book, I would take the Old Testament, and I would go out\nto the Hudson river, and I\u2019d sit there all day long, and I\u2019d fast, and I read. I read about the\nJews, and their history, and the battles, and King David, and King Solomon, and all the\nwonderful stories of the Old Testament, and of my people. But at -- again, as I began to\nfind out what the Holocaust really had -- had been, it all seemed -- religion seemed like a\nfarce. God had taken his own people, and murdered one and a half -- let the Germans\nmurder one and a half million of his own children, little children, innocents. It didn\u2019t\nmake any sense. Like so many other Holocaust survivors, I guess, there was no thinking\nof God after Auschwitz. And so I slowly, slowly left it all. I became -- I read more, and\nmore, and more, and none -- none of it pointed to the existence of -- of God. It all pointed\nout to the -- to the terrible things that human beings can do. So, religion became not\nimportant any more to me. What did become more and more important, though, is the\nfate of the Jewish people. I am very fervent in my defense of the j -- of the Jewish people,\nas a most marvelous, marvelous people. Difficult people. Moses knew that already, goes\nup for a couple of days on the mountains, come back, and they already screwed it up,\nthey made a golden calf. There\u2019s a lesson there. I mean, the J-Jews are difficult, and they\nare impossible, but they\u2019re also genius, they are the salt of the earth. And to me, the\nJewish people in Israel, they\u2019re -- our country, I mean, this is all miraculous, after 2,000\nyears. Jews have waited for this, and we\u2019ve got a country. And I thank God. We have\nworked -- We have gone there for five years at least, and given our lives to it. It was well\nworth it. So, religion is sort of evolved into a fervent nationalism, and -- and a defense of\nthe Jewish people. I will accept no blame whatsoever to Israel, what they do, or whatever\nthey do. It\u2019s -- I\u2019m like the old fashioned English -- Englishman, you know? My country -\n- Or maybe it was an American, I don\u2019t know. I think it was an Englishman who said, my\ncountry right or wrong. To me, the -- the security of the Jewish people is uppermost, and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nit sounds horrendous, but if it would be necessary to throw every Arab out of -- out of\nIsrael in order to secure it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- the safety of it\u2019s people, I\u2019d say, don\u2019t hesitate, do it.\nWe have suffered for 2,000 years, murder and mayhem. I mean hangings, burnings, it\u2019s\nhorrible, the whole Jewish history is -- is one of -- of -- of suffering. Enough. Now it\u2019s\nour time. And so, I guess, my religion became really my love for -- for my people. And\nit\u2019s difficult sometimes you know? I -- We had to -- Carla has two grand -- had a\ngrandnephew here, very nice young man who worked for the Israeli embassy here, and he\ncame with his girlfriend, and they stayed here for three months upstairs in a little room.\nAnd we had this -- we had this conversation, and they said, \u201cOh, we don\u2019t -- we don\u2019t\ngive a damn for politics in Israel, it\u2019s horrible. We don\u2019t want to know anything about\npolitics, and we don\u2019t want to -- and I think we should give the land back to the -- to the -\n- to the Palestinians, or whoever, and th-the Syrians, and -- and we don\u2019t want to be\ninvolved in this.\u201d And I -- These were the people I admire, these are the sabbers, the\npeople who are born there, and I said, \u201cLet me tell you something. Let me give you at\nleast a view of a Holocaust survivor. We had no country, we had nowhere to go. There\nwas no way out, they murdered us by the millions.\u201d I said, \u201cThe Jewish people suffered\nunbelievably, [indecipherable]. Now there\u2019s a country, and you are our hope.\u201d I said,\n\u201cThe first thing for us as -- as survivors, is a Security, a safe haven, where Jews can go,\nwhere Jews can be defended. So don\u2019t say that you\u2019re not interested, please.\u201d And they\nunderstood. So, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s an answer for your question, but that\u2019s as close as I\ncan come. Religion is no longer of an -- any importance to me at this point, but the fate of\nmy people is, very much so.",

Unfortunately, after awhile, that doctor\ncouldn\u2019t see me any more, but he recommended me to another doctor, Doctor Hillel\nSwiller, and I went to him for about -- one of the first sessions I had with him, I said,\n\u201cLook, I want to tell you something doctor,\u201d I said, \u201cI am not one of these guys who\nbelieves in going for years and years and years into psychotherapy.

I can see myself now as -- as that -- the little boy, who -- how he grew up, and\nhow he -- the 1929 episode in -- in the United States was a terrible one. My mother had to\nfarm me out. She farmed me out to a young woman who -- I don\u2019t know if she beat me,\nbut she was very bad for me.

But that first -- first experience,\nbeing separated from my mother, who had to go to work because my father was in the\nhospital then, and being alone, and being mistreated, when the war came, and the whole\nthing started all over again, the loneliness, and the danger and the fear, I think it all\naccumulated. And then we had, what, 25 years of doing nothing, and then you wind up\nwith a psychiatrist. It\u2019s -- You know, it\u2019s funny. One of the last sessions -- recently I had\nto go back to him for just the one session, because I have interviewed a man nearby here,\nwho had been in Auschwitz with his brother, and the story was so terrible that I had\nnightmares overnight, wh-what happened to him, happened to me during the night, and\nthe next morning I was crazy, I -- I couldn\u2019t clear my head, and I -- my wife said,\n\u201cYou've got to go see -- see a shrink because, you know, this has been too much of a\nthing.\u201d And I went back to him, and we tal -- and he helped me immediately, and we\ntalked about it, and he -- he explained to me why it upset me so much, because it was --\nthis man had been with his brother in Auschwitz, and it brought all my war stories back,\nthe danger, and the fear with my little brothers, and -- and I said, \u201cYou know, I never\ntalked about the Holocaust with you, did I?\u201d And he began to laugh, he said, \u201cYou did\nnothing else.\u201d He says, \u201cYou did -- you did all the time,\u201d he said. I said, \u201cI can\u2019t\nremember that, did I talk about? I thought I only talked about sex, and -- and -- and\nwomen, and,\u201d -- he said, \u201cYou crazy.\u201d He said, \u201cYou,\u201d -- no, he didn\u2019t say I was crazy.\nHe said, \u201cEd,\u201d he said, \u201cevery session you talked about the Holocaust.\u201d \u201cOh, I did? All\nright.\u201d So, I don\u2019t know where we started with this question, I lost myself in the answer,\nbut -- oh, did th -- did therapy change me, how did it change me? It made me into a more\nwise person, I think. More livable person. I don\u2019t think our marriage would have lasted if\nI hadn\u2019t, was pretty impossible, you know? Carla is very even person, 1s like -- the whole\nfamily, her mother was like that, her brother is like that, they\u2019re wonderful people. They -\n- They\u2019re not -- don\u2019t have great emotional outbursts on the up side, but also not on the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ndown side. They\u2019re very, very stable, and I was very unstable. So, Iam more stable now,\nlet\u2019s put it that way.",
        "A: You know, I -- I\u2019ve thought about it, and I\u2019ve come up with an answer that may not be\nthe right one, but when you deal with Holocaust survivors, as you do now, and as I have\ndone in interviews, you realize there\u2019s an enormous range of suffering. Those people --\nand I\u2019ve interviewed people who were lying 1n a hole in the ground in the woods for nine\nmonths, frozen practically to death. That is not comparable to what I -- what happened to\nme. They saw th -- I\u2019ve interviewed people where, first their fa -- their mother, then their\nfather was killed, then the brothers, a -- a woman had seven brothers, she wound up with\none after the war. One by one they were killed in Polish forests where they were in\nhiding. One by one, she saw them being slaughtered. That woman is probably -- it is\nprobably impossible for her to go out and do interviews -- interview other Holocaust\nsurvivors. I come from a family that survived complete. An oddity in Holland, by the\nway. Holland has a -- has a -- I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar with the statistics of\nHolland. Holland is the worst country after Poland and Greece, and certainly by far the --\nthe worst country for survivors in -- in the -- in -- west of Europe, western Europe. So,\nmy k -- my family survived. I came out with a father, I came out with a mother, I came\nout with two brothers. I came out with cousins, I came with uncles, aunts, a whole family.\nI think that because of that, it is possible for me to go and interview other people, and not\ngo completely to pieces. I think if I had been like the woman who saw her family\nslaughtered one by one in the Polish forest, I don\u2019t think I could be like -- sitting here,\ntalking with you like this. So -- Then there is something else, this is usually not talked\nabout. There is an intellectual range in Holocaust survivors, as well as non-Holocaust\nsurvivors, course. It makes a big difference what -- where you come from, intellectually.\nIf you come from a Polish farming family, a Jewish family, somewhere in a shtetl, where\nthe father was a shoemaker, and the mother did the household, and -- and life was fairly\nprimitive, but wonderful, but then, that\u2019s not my background either. I come from a\nfamily, my father was an artist. My mother was a telegraph operator when she -- when --\nwhen no women were practically working. I come from a family that loved music, loved\nliterature, loved all the kinds of things. I come from a family where I have one -- two\nbrothers who were college professors, one -- one has changed in the meantime, to be an --\na psych -- a psychotherapist. You know, this makes a big difference. I-It\u2019s possible for --\nfor Carla and me, come from a little different group, little different level, to help others.\nWhen -- When we go to national conferences, and I see the others, they\u2019re not that many\nthat -- I cried when I saw them the first time, the 1600 hidden children, and I still feel,\nyou know, love for them, but -- but I realize now that not all Holocaust survivors are\npeople that -- that I can -- that I can feel at home with, you know? And it\u2019s interesting in\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nmany of the interviews that I\u2019ve done, the interviewee said, \u201cEd, we got to get together\nafterwards, you know. Let\u2019s go out, you and my -- my wife, and -- a-a-and I, and you and\nyour wife, and we\u2019re going to have dinner together.\u201d And I thought, \u201cI can\u2019t do this, not\nwith you.\u201d I mean, very primitive people sometimes. Lovely people, but primitive, I\ncouldn\u2019t -- you know, I couldn\u2019t. There was nothing we had in common, except that I\ninterviewed them. So -- Let\u2019s see, what was the qu -- what was the question? Oh, why do\nwe -- why can we do this, and others cannot? I think it had to do with our background,\nthe fact that we\u2019re not too damaged, and the fact that we came from backgrounds where\nreading, and -- and -- and culture was of -- of importance. And you\u2019|I find this all over, if\nyou look at the people who, let\u2019s say, are important in -- in the Holocaust community,\nthey\u2019re most -- mostly people who were not that terribly damaged, and who -- who can\nwrite, and read, and understand, and so -- or a psychologist, or whatever. I don\u2019t kn -- I --\nI think -- that is my view of it.",
        "A: Yeah. I forgot something. And I think he deserves a place, and I don\u2019t think he is in\nthe original interview, because he couldn\u2019t be. After the conference, in 1981, of the\nHidden Children, a letter arrived at my -- my wife\u2019s desk in New York, of the Hidden\nChildren, from a man in Yonkers, his name was Eddie Strauss, have you heard of him?\nNo. Eddie Strauss wrote a letter, and it said, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m a hidden child from\nBelgium, and I\u2019m so terribly sorry I couldn\u2019t come to the conference, because I was in the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nhospital, but I would like to take up contact with you.\u201d And Carla came home with this\nletter, and she handed it to me, and said, \u201cListen, I\u2019m very busy, and this man writes, and\nhe lives right nearby here, about 10 minutes away, in Yonkers. Maybe you can contact\nhim.\u201d Okay. So one day I call -- called up this man, and I got him on the phone, and I --\nand I said, \u201cAh, Mr. Strauss?\u201d \u201cYes?\u201d I said, \u201cMy wife handed me this letter, could I\ncome and say hello to you?\u201d You know. \u201cYeah, I heard you -- you were sorry you\ncouldn\u2019t come to the conference.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d he said. So I went down, straight down\nBroadway, same Broadway you have in New York, and entered a dark apartment,\nclimbed five stairs, five steps up from street level, and entered a dark apartment, and\nthere in the far -- far end of the dark apartment sat a man in a wheelchair, with one leg. I\nhadn\u2019t expected this. He was overweight, and I shook his hand, and I said, \u201cSo, tell me\nabout yourself.\u201d And out comes this story that he was -- he lived in Antwerp, in Belgium,\nand he was play -- out playing one day, and he stayed out too late, and when he came\nback, a neighbor grabbed him from the street, and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t go home.\u201d And he\nfound out later that his mother, his grandmother, his three year old sister, and his one year\nold baby brother had been snatched away from the house that day by -- by the Germans,\nput in a truck. They were sent to Auschwitz, and the day that they arrived, they were all\ngassed, all murdered. That was Eddie\u2019s background, and his family. He wound up in an\norphan home in -- Belgium had six or seven orphan homes that were set up by the -- by\nthe Judenrat, and with help of the Belgian Queen Mother, and the Germans knew about it.\nSo these children were really, I say, hostages of the Germans. But they were cared for,\nand taken care of, and Eddie had been one of them. He had, after the war, he had come to\nthe United States. He -- He went to an uncle of his in Manhattan, and -- and his\ngrandfather lived there, and it didn\u2019t work out. They were German Jews, and they\ncouldn\u2019t understand this boy who had, at one time, been found in the street, totally full of\nlice, and -- and full of wounds, and -- so Eddie was placed somewhere in New Jersey,\nwith people who were very good for him, and he went to -- he went to college, and he\ngraduated, very smart. Joined the American army -- was drafted into the American army,\nand of all places was sent to Germany, because he knew fluent German, and he knew\nFrench fluently, and English. And he worked for the adjutant general, or something like\nthat, in -- in -- in -- in Munchen, or so-someplace, interviewing Germans to see if they\nwere Nazis, and so on. He came back, and he invented a story about himself, he made an\nartificial life. The people didn\u2019t know that he was Jewish. He st -- He said that when\npeople asked about his parents, he said they had died in a car accident in Texas, and he\nhad had -- he had a sister somewhere, but also in Texas, and he hadn\u2019t seen her in years,\nand so on. He told me all this. His name was Eddie, like mine. Our birthdates happened\nto be the same, the eighth of May. And somehow another, I decided that I would adopt\nthis man. And I began to do what in Jewish we call mitzvahs, good deeds. I got him --\nfirst of all, I got him money. I helped him with everything he needed, as much as I could,\nand he became like a brother to me, and I was his brother, you know, I\u2019m the brother that\nhad died. And I took care of him as much as I could, for years. He went -- He had only\none leg, he had diabetes, and about a year after I met him, his other leg had to be\namputated, so now he had no legs at all, and he wanted to commit suicide, he had tried\nonce to commit suicide. Ha -- But he got a new apartment, a nice, clean apartment, and\nhe had electric wheelchair, which made him very happy. And I gi -- brought him gifts,\nand I brought him books, and I talked with him, and -- and I took him to Hidden Child\nmeetings in New York, on Purim, or you know. And he was here, we sat in this room\nwith him for Passover, to the seder, we invited him, and brought him with. Lot of trouble,\nalways, getting him with the wheelchair to there -- places. And we took him to\nWashington, I took him to Washington when the Hidden Children, our group from\nWestchester, went to the Holocaust museum, he wanted to go there, and you can\u2019t\nimagine what we went through, took Eddie in the wheelchair to -- to Washington. And\nFebruary, 1997, he died in front of the computer I had gotten him. He wanted to learn the\ncomputer, and he learned, and then he was suddenly dead, and he was gone. And it fell to\nme to take care of his stuff, little stuff that he had. And it fell to me, about a year ago, to\nput a -- to take care of his funeral, and then later to put a stone on -- on his grave. And I\ndecided that there was more to him than just -- more to his grave, and there should be\nmore to that grave, and I had a gra -- on the gravestone, I had a stonemason chisel that --\nsomething like, in this place -- let this place remember not only Eddie Strauss, whose\nname was really Abraham Katz, but also his mother, with her name, and his father, and\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nhis sister Esther, and his little one year old brother. I put all their names on there, with the\ndates, all killed in Auschwitz. So that gravestone is nearby here, and I\u2019m very proud of\nthat, that at least that\u2019s the last thing I could do for Eddie. And I wanted to put that in, it\nwas also a part of my development after the war, as a -- an aware Jew, let me put it that\nway.\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nConclusion of Interview\n"
