        "Q: We're on. We're about to start. Would you tell me your full name please?",
        "A: Chaim Engel. C- H- A-I-M.",
        "Q: Where and when were you born?",
        "A: I born in January 1916 in -- I born in a small place really, Brudzew, B- R- U- D-Z-E-\nW, but when I was five years old my father moved to Lodz. I remember when he lived in this\nplace, they had a textile store -- they called him \"the millionaire.\" He probably made a living,\nthat's all. But wasn't, not -- one of the not many Jews there. He had a store, so automatically\nhe called a \"millionaire.\" And that's the reason my father left, was just afraid. It's the\nantisemitisms for Jews, so he left. He left, he went, moved to L\u00e9dz. It was when I was\naround five years old. And he started different thing. My father was really not a\nbusinessman. He was really a scholar. He studied for rabbi. He never practiced it, but a very\nTalmudistic -- he was really a -- let me call a scholar. That's probably the right word. But he\nhad to make a living, so he had this textile and then he came to L\u00e9dz to live and he started\ndifferent kind of business; and, we, we were not poor but we made it all the years, we made a\nliving, nice living. And my youth was, in a big city. I went to schools, to a Jewish school\nwhich also had, from the government, you had to go to school to make, regular school. How\ndo you call it? The...",
        "Q: Public school?",
        "A: Public schools. So while you -- there were schools, Jewish schools, what they had it\nconnected together. That covered that, too. So you had both things in the same. And that's\nthe kind of school I went. And I finished, the middle school, called middle school, maybe till\naround 14 years or 15 years.\nAnd then I started to work. My uncle had, a factory, a textile \u2014 stockings, they made\nstockings there, also textile. And I worked with him there for a year and then I--",
        "Q: What, what was life like for a teenager at that point?",
        "A: Well, well, we always felt that we are Jews. We were sections in Lodz I wouldn't go as a\nJew, because you were a Jew. I don't know -- discrimination of, 1t was so much against Jews\nI assume I didn't really felt it so much because I lived more in the area of Jews and I maybe\ndidn't have so much contact with not-Jews, but the -- you always were aware that you are a\nJew. You didn't go in certain sections which was not Jewish. You felt that you are a Jew\nbecause the laws which were there or the surroundings what not-Jews, how they acted and\nreacted to your being a Jew. So that was really what was as far as I can remember as a as a as\na teenager.",
        "Q: Did you join clubs? Were you part of a group?",
        "A: not really. Not really, not really. We were more -- Jews, my friends who are Jewish, mostly,\nand we not really lived in an area where were just Jews living. We were also in an area what\nlived other people, but your contact mostly you had with the Jewish, because you were\nresented very much from the not-Jewish. Very seldom that you had a not-Jewish friend. And\nmy time was that I worked, I worked till, when, we are 20, 20, you had to go to the army.\nWhen you are 20 you went to army for one and a half year. And that was in 1938. And, but\nmy mother died in 1936. She was sick, I don't know exactly what, I think bronchitis or\nwhatever. Anyway she died and I was about 20 and there come the time I had to go in the\narmy and my father remarried after a short time, married, and I resented this. So as it came I\nhad to go to the army and I served in the Polish army, for almost one and a half year. My\ntime expired. You -- after one and a half year would have been on September the 15th, 1939,\nand the war broke out on Ist, September the Ist, so I ended up being a soldier while the war\nbroke out, so I was in the war as a soldier, Polish army, against the Germans. Now talking\nabout the reaction of non-Jews to the Jews, when I was in the army I went in the war. I was\njust as afraid from my comrades and from my sergeant as much as, as I was from the\nGermans. I didn't trust them. They mentioned, \"You are a Jew,\" and things like that. So I was\nreally afraid in a time like that can happen anything with you. So, we fought till the 25th,\nseventh, whatever the two weeks, three weeks; and I ended up, I became a prisoner of war.\nAnd the first reaction I had on the front with that soldier, the German soldier what took me\nsaid, \"Are you a Jew?\"\nI just said, \"Yes.\" But he didn't react. He could shoot me or whatever. He didn't -- said, \"Go,\ngo, go.\" And they didn't do anything to me. So, but anyway they took us as prisoners of war.\nThey kept us for two days outside 1n the field and it was cold already and they sent us to\nGermany as, as prisoner of war. And as prisoner of war we worked; it was very bad. I got\nsick and they did hardly fed you. They didn't get hardly any food, and you know any -- may,\nmaybe I need some medication or whatever. I didn't get anything. And most of all was our\nwork. We went cleaning the streets in Leipzig. It was -- must have been near to Leipzig, I\nremember that. And there we cleaned the street and, and -- till the one day came that all the\nJewish prisoners of war from Pole had to be sent back to Pole. That was in March of 1940,\nand they sent us back to the place, to Pole, because they figured for the Jewish prisoners of\nwar still has some more privileges than a Jew in Poland and they wanted to get rid of the\nJews. That's the reason they send us back. And I came and I thought I go back to the place\nwhere my father lived. When I came there I found out that in '39 already, in December, they\nalready took all the Jews out. There was a big apartment house, so all the Jews took out and\nsent them away to Lublin. So I followed them. I didn't know exactly where, but somehow -- I\ndon't remember how I found him. I found him where he is, and I came there and he had a\nhard time because they took only with them whatever they had on their shoulder and they\nhad on them. They didn't, could take -- you couldn't take anything with them. So that was a\nhard time. Didn't have anything. So was very, a very hard time. So when I came back and I\nlooked down what's going on, so I figured -- I went, I went to a farmer and asked if I can be a\nhelp there, as farmer's help. And he agreed to it, and he kept me there as a farm's worker, and\nI just did farm work. Was a Ukraine family and, he paid me. They gave me food and shelter\nand I think he paid me by the year with so much bags of corn or whatever, what I could sell\nand that I could help my family with that. And I was there for one and a half year, and then\nmy brother what was nine years old, younger, was in the age that he could -- he was about 18\nor something -- so he could -- 17, 18, that he -- I found for him a job too.",
        "Q: What was it like on the farm for you?",
        "A: Now they were, they were nice people and they took me like a farm's help, and probably I\nwas cheaper than anybody else, but they were nice people. They were pretty good to me.\nThey were not really to mistreat me or something like that. And, I had to do all the work.\nThey were very nice people. I cannot, say they mistreated me; but my father lived in a place\nnot in the village where I work on the farm. It was a small place, not far from the farm, about\nfive miles away, things like that. So sometimes when I had a day off I could go back there\nand I walked. A matter of fact back then there was not any transportation there, and there\nwas very hard for the people, for the Jews. Very hard. Very restricted, curfew. They couldn't\ndo things much, but the mostly what they lived 1s they went to Lublin, brought some\nmerchandise and sold it and that's the way they could live, 'cause it was not that -- they\nprobably they didn't much trade and there was not any industry whatever. So they had really\na hard time and, and the Germans mistreated the Jews. If he saw one on the street and he\ndidn't like him, he could shoot him like that and they buried him 1n a place where he stood\nwhere he shot him. So we had places where you have to watch just not to go on these places\nbecause there's somebody buried there, so this really was a sad time. It was also very\ndangerous to go from my village to the place where I, where my father lived because if a\nGerman saw you on the road and he didn't like you for whatever reason, he shot you and no,\nwas no recourse. He couldn't tell anybody, nobody will listen. He was king, as far as a Jew\nconcerned. He didn't need any laws to ever, to adhere to it. He just, just did whatever he\nliked, he felt like. So that was really -- you got used to live with it. You took it already for\nnormal the way it is. You just watched out that you are not around what get shot or whatever,\nso we worked there and the restrictions for the Jews became every time more restrictions and\nmore restrictions till, one day the only things what Jews could do is working at a farm as a\nfarmer's help. So we were still safe for a little ttme because in meantime they sent all these\nJews, sent away to all these concentration camps.\nAnd in June of 1942 when they, they sent a transport of Jews away from the place, and my\nfather was in this group with the second wife, with my step-mother. They were in this\ntransport. Later when being tn, in Sobibor I found out that this transport went to Sobibor\nbecause I met people, younger ones, what went with this transport and they worked there, so\nthey knew about it. So, to come back to about my story, when I -- so I, as I say we still were\nable to work at the farmer, till one day all they came the restrictions Jews couldn't work at\nfarmers. Everybody has to concentrate in the next place, nearest place, bigger place -- all the\nJews around what work for the farmers, so in other words it was strict, no, no Jews anymore.\nSo we know what's going on, so we didn't go, so my brother and my friend were -- all three\nwe worked at the farmer's. So we decided not to go to this place. We thought, \"Let's go in the\nwoods. Maybe we'll find some, some partisans, or something like that.\" So we went in the\nwoods instead to go to the place, and we walked around in the woods. We didn't have any\nfood. It was cold and no shelter, nothing, so we had to come, find our way out of it because\nwe didn't find any partisans and you couldn't live that and the people, the Polish people,\nwouldn't help you. They didn't. First of all we were afraid to show our face and if we did\neven they were very reluctant have anything to do with you. You were afraid they might go\nto tell the Germans that you are there. So we heard somehow that in Izbica--was a city about\nmaybe 10, 15 miles away, 20 miles, whatever--that there are still some Jews in this place, so\nwe walked till we came there. We came there in the evening. And we came, there were still\nJews there and we talked with the other Jews what lived still there and surely everybody was\nhelpful to do. We told them where we come from and what -- sure -- they took us in. Every\nstranger, they took us in, in the house and there was full with Jews, you know, on the floor\nand everybody just took care of a shelter; and the same night the Germans came at night and\ndrove all the people out of the houses to collect them in the center of the city and to go to\nsend them away to the camps. Now we were still -- there was this old houses, you had this\nattics and things like that, so we tried to hide there in the building not to come out, but they\ndidn't do any effort to get you out because they figured eventually you will have to come out.\nNo food, no shelter, no facilities, you have to come out, and that is what happened. After\nthree nights hiding and not having food, whoever was hiding came out of this place and the\nothers went already what they collected, they went already sent them back to a camp and we\nwere the ones what were hiding, so they later they took us to the trains, to the freight trains;\nand, whatever people they collected, they pushed us in, in this freight trains, as many people\nas they could squeeze in and we were standing, no moving, nothing and the whole night we\ntraveled in this train. Now there was people fell down. People had to go to the bathroom and\nthere was, there was a mess -- you cannot imagine. But you had no, any choice, nothing. So\nthat after the morning -- in the morning we ended up arriving in Sobibor. That is the way we\narrived in Sobibor. So I was with my brother and myself and my friend; and we all meet the\nother rest of the people, about seven, 800 people and they took us out from the trains and\nthey put us 1n two lines and they start collecting -- picking out people. I didn't know what the\npicking out means, so one German asked me, \"Where are you from?\" I said, \"From L\u00e9dz.\"\n\"Out.\" And then they went further. \"What are you?\" \"A carpenter.\" \"Out.\" Things like that,\nso they picked about 18 to 20 people. Well, let me maybe say that we hear in Poland that that\nhappens with the Jews. They kill Jews and they gas Jews and things like that; but we really,\nas young people, we really didn't believe that something like that is possible. We thought,\n\u201cMaybe the younger people will take to work. Maybe only the older people....\u201d You just\ndidn't want to be -- wan-- wanted to believe, because it was so incomprehensible, so\nunbelievable that something like that can happen that you just -- even if you had the\nintelligence you didn't believe it, so when they picked us out in the camp, I really didn't\nknow what means the picking out means, whether life or death.\nSo they took us -- the 20 people -- they took us in one side and the others went to the camp,\nto the gas chambers -- what we found out later. So we worked in there. Went -- in the\nafternoon, in the afternoon, they took us with all the other people to separate the clothes.\nThat started to be our work and I started to separate my clothes -- that was the clothes from\npeople who just arrived with the transport what we came with, and while I did that I found\nthe clothes of my brother, the pictures from the family, so I knew already -- they already told\nme what's going on, so I knew already what happened, that he went to the gas chamber with\nmy friend and I am here separating his clothes. So you can imagine what went through my\nmind when that happened.",
        "Q: What did you do? How did you handle that?",
        "A: Well, I really don't know. I, I -- everything stopped on me, like I stopped functioning. I just --\nalso I heard all the stories before that didn't penetrate in me, I didn't accepted it, but that\nmade it already accepting. That is the truth. That's what happened, because I saw what\nhappened. So it's hard to tell the feelings. It's -- it 1s just -- you stop thinking. You stop\nfunctioning. It is just like somebody hits you with a hammer in your head, something like\nthat, so -- but you had to do your work. You were not your own. You had to function just to\nfunction, to move, to go, to do things like that, so we finished our work and surely constantly\nin my mind what happened and, and, and that was really our work, what we do, day in, day\nout and, and then we went back and then after the work they always kept us around five\no'clock, before it gets dark, back to the barracks, where we, we slept. Selma told the work\nabout it was divided. It was a section where the Germans lived, and that was really fixed up\nnicely with gardens and things like that. And then was barracks where we lived, mostly\nwhere, we slept in other words. And there was a few places in the park or call it camp or\nwhatever -- there were also places where they had a shoemaker, a goldsmith, a tailor, a\nregular smith, things like that, but that was mostly not for the camp. That was mostly work\ndone for the Germans in the camp. What they need some work, they did it; like the goldsmith\nthat did for them good different things, made for them up rings. You see, the camp really was\n-- that was one of many camps, of about four or five camps what was really a death camp.\nIt was not a concentration camp. The distinction is the death camp, people came there, they\nwere directed to the gas chamber. They -- the small group what worked, like us, was just to\nkeep the things going; in other words separating the clothes, cleaning out.... Before we came,\nbefore I came, about a few months before, they start, it was different. When a transport\ncame, they picked out about 50, 60 people from this transport and when all the people were\nalready in, gone to the gas chamber, they cleaned up after them and then these people were\nshot in the gas chamber, often in the camp, Camp Three. later they found out it's more\nefficient for them to have the same people do always the same work, so they start to have\npermanent people doing the cleaning up, the separating all the kind of thing, and that what\nstarted to be a permanent group in this camp what worked there. And we were the ones what,\nwhat did this kind of work. So it was, as I have to explain maybe, the camp was so as I say\nwe lived apart where the Germans lived. We lived, the place where we worked and there was\nLager Three, or Camp Three, where the people went to the gas chambers and there, there\nwere in the beginning was as burying and later.... Is that the right word?",
        "Q: Buried.",
        "A: Buried them. And later, they came they burned. They had a big roaster thing that they burned\nthe people. Now, also, we had hard times. Everyday, almost, they beat you, they, they\nmistreated you. They made you working, day and night and all the kind of thing, but you\nwere young and you could take it as much as you could take it. Whoever couldn't take it was\ntaken to the camp, to Camp Three and was shot and a lot of people couldn't make and they\nfell, just fell from the from the kind of work and the food you have and things like there was\na change of people. Very often a lot of people were changed because they just couldn't make\nit. They couldn't, physically they couldn't have it. Now the people what work in Lager Three\nwas often a change of it, because the people worked directly with the bodies and having to\nwork on that, it -- most people, mentally, they just couldn't have it; and they were changed.\nThey had to change the group. They killed, they killed them and they picked out another\ngroup of people and they took them, or they took some of ours or things like that. They took;\nand if you once came there, you never came out of it because that was the real end, the real\nend. Nobody could come out from that. So, in camp itself the food what they gave you really\nwas -- we called it a straw soup. That was something you couldn't even swallow. You had to\nspit out and in the morning, black water and a slice of bread for the 24 hours.\nNow if you had to live on that, you couldn't really live there; but because we work with this,\nclothes, separating the clothes and the people came -- they always brought with them -- you\nsaw -- they couldn't take much with them, the people what got sent on the transport. They\njust took them from the houses and say, \"Go,\" so they took with them -- usually what you\ntake, you take with you the valuables what you can in small things like diamonds, rings and\nthings like that. They figure, \"They'll let me take something. You never know what happen.\"\nAnd also some food. They took cans of food, things like that, so we were the ones what\nreally worked with that, so knowing that we don't have much to, to eat, so we took the risk to\nsteal this food and we brought it back and we ate it. Now if they caught you, you were shot\non the place. You had a piece, a can, or whatever, they shot you. They didn't even question,\nask you nothing. Just shot you. Now lot of times they did it, they caught somebody, they\ntook us out to show what happens if somebody steals, but we still kept doing it, regardless;\nand so we really had -- sometimes we had food to eat. So even the time when we didn't have\nthe food one evened out with the other, so we were not -- as far as that's concerned, not they\nfed us but we fed ourself. We took the food, we stole the food and so we had sometimes\nfrom the transport, we had the food.\nAnd also, as for clothes, what I mentioned -- people ask you, \u201cIn the camp you look not so\nbad dressed,\u201d and things like that. Now we work with these clothes, so if, if we had a ripped\njacket and we saw another one, we took another jacket and we didn't have special camp\nclothes. We had our regular clothes what we came in, so there as far as that, but there was\nalways the -- if you didn't look right or the German maybe had just a drink and he didn't like\nyour look, he took you out and shot you. There was nothing. He didn't have to give any\naccount to anybody what he is doing. He just did whatever he felt like. Now we had some\nwhat we had to be very careful, because they always were suspicious. And if they had any\nsuspicion, justified or not justified, you could be a target of it. What they did, sometimes they\ntook us out from the bed and they, they took us and shot people and things like that, you\ndidn't look right, you didn't walk right. And also when they took us out on Appell! and you\ndidn't stay right, he decided, gives you 25 whips -- they had whips -- 25 whips on the, on the\non, on, on your bare, bare bottom. So, I had it a few times. I got beaten, so, so I took when I\nwas on my work I saw some other pants, so I took two pair of pants. I figured if they beat me\nit wouldn't be so bad. So they found out that, so I got beaten and I had to take off both my\npants. And so you got beaten on 25 whips and if you, you had to count it. If you didn't --\nstopped counting in the middle, you had to start from the beginning and he gave you another\n25. So that was really one of the minor things. The main thing was we always were living\nwith that people seeing what we -- the transports that came and they went to these gas\nchambers -- men, women, children, and that was always a heart-breaking thing to see and,\nand that was really.... Ours is beating alright, the next day you were better, but that is not so\nimportant. But that what we saw what happens, and that what really always touched us. But,\nbut it is strange that even, even, if you were young and even if you see what happen and you\nknow it's no way out of here, even if you think, \"It's just a fantasy,\" that you think, \"T will\ncome out of here all right.\" It just -- you hope, your hope is justified hope -- not justified\nhope, but you think because your will for life is so -- you think, \"Ah, one day I will come out\nof it.\" There was really not any reason to believe it will happen, because it was, it was around\nwith barbed wires, mines around, in the woods, guards around, dogs around, and even if you\nget out you wouldn't know where to go even. So there was not really any, any real hope\nwhatever, not any spark of hope there that you would can come out ever. But still, you know,\n' roll call (German).\nas I say, you're young. You think -- a matter of fact sometimes being in a camp and you're\nnot fully alert, you were not -- you couldn't believe that what happened happens here because\nit was so far from reality really, thinking that -- how can you imagine -- they burn people --\nthey, they kill people, young people, children. You couldn't believe that. So if you're not\nreally fully aware you thought that is not true, you just dream. But really that was, was what\nhappened. So, in general to say that really what, what was the situation in camp. So there are\ndifferent, cases that happened that people -- it is in the movie, is it about -- there was a group\nwhat worked outside the camp, about 10 people, 15 people, whatever; and they went out\nwith two Ukrainians to work there. Now and there was in this group -- one day, they and\nwere in this, in this Ukraines, the guards -- and they killed one and, and they start to run\naway, So a few got away and the rest were caught and brought back to the camp. And when\nthat happened, they -- we had to go on Appell and they took us to show how they shot all\nthese people and we had to see it as a lesson when you ran away. That was one accident.\nThere was another one, a similar story happened something -- somebody ran away so this\ntime they took different. They took each 10th -- they put us on an Appell and every 10th of\nthe line they picked out; and every 10th, the group what they collected from that they took\nthem with them and they shot them together with the other ones. Now I happened to be\nnumber nine in a line where they picked the 10th of it, so luck was with me somehow I\nguess. So they, they shot this group; so things like that happened very, very often. I really\ncouldn't recall how many times -- probably Selma told about this -- 72 Dutch people, there\nwas a rumor that they want to ran away so they took the whole 72 to Camp Three and they\nshot them all.\nThings like that happened very often. Somebody -- I told you about the -- we were on this\ntrial in Germany and I testified that Frenzel\u2019, one of the Germans, he shot a dentist for no\nreason. We had to see how he put him down and turned around and shot him 1n his back, in\nthe neck here and he fell down, and I testified for that. Now that's one of the few cases that I\nremember things that they did, things like that.",
        "Q: Can you tell us a little more about Frenzel and the kinds of things he did?",
        "A: Well, the -- each German was really an, an individual by himself. Although they all had --\nthey came for one purpose, just to treat the Jews there, but each one had reacted to his\ncharacter. As I mentioned once, there was one what was there for some whatever reason, but\nhe was not the worst one.\nHe could give a Jew another piece of bread; but the other one like Frenzel, he looked for\ntrouble not for him, for the Jews. He didn't like somebody, he shot them. He would -- people\n* Oberscharfiihrer Karl Frenzel\nwould -- sometimes you couldn't go to work. They were in the barrack for a day. He didn't\nlike you are so long there for a day. He took them out and took them to Camp Three and they\nshot all of them, so each individual really was what he was by himself. It was not a\ncommand they had to do that. Like we had another one, Wagner, what was -- that was the\nworst one of all of them. The worst thing about him 1s he was very sharp and very\nsuspicious. If he has his eye and his intuition and his feeling for so he could smell out\nsomething there will be trouble tomorrow, so we were always careful. When he was around -\n- we had a name for him, \"VaYikru\". Now that means -- we called him \"VaYikru,\" because\nwe didn't want any name, popular name, that you don't recognize it, so we knew when we\nsaid -- when he came near to the camp we said \"VaYikru,\" so everybody knew to be alert\nand out of his way because it always happened with him something. He always took\nsomebody. He killed him or he beat him or whatever, so we always were very careful as far\nas that. So what I want to point out, the claim that these guards say they had to do the things,\nare definitely not true. First of all, a lot of time they asked for volunteers because they didn't\nwant to work they went there, but they were not commanded to particularly shoot this one or\ndo this one. Their function was to go there and to see that if work functions, that the people\ngo, come from the train, go to the gas chamber and do the things, but each individual showed\nhis character there and when he was one what he wanted to hurt personally something, he\ndid it there; and he didn't have to give any, any account of it, what he 1s doing.\nSo the Frenzel was really one of the bad ones. He, he really -- if he could kill people, he did.\nwe had one, for example, what worked in Lager Three and he used to be a boxer, Gomerski\u2019,\nand for him they made a special whip what was heavier and one day he came back from\nLager Three and we were on Appell and he came -- this Frenzel was with us -- and he was\nbragging to Frenzel -- we understood, we speak German -- so he says to him that he just\nkilled a Jew with 12 hits with his whip. So, so they chose that each character lived out his\ncharacter there. It was not that he had to do that; they did it, so the excuse that they had to\nthat is nonsense. So, there's -- well, also my work was separating clothes when transport\ncame at night. Sometimes they took people out any time, anybody to do different kind of\nworks. What they did, they cut the hair of the women. The women went to the gas chamber\nafter the men and then they stopped, about one or two barracks before the gas chamber was a\nbarrack where they left their luggage and they had to undress; and there was a barrack the\nnext to the gas chamber where they cut at randomly, they cut the hair of the women. They\nutilized it. They send it back to Germany; they did for brushes, for everything. So we were\nsometimes picked out at night to cut the hair, and it happens once I happened to be one of\nthis group. I had to go also to cut the hair. Now we were about 10 feet from the gas chamber.\nThere was -- the gas chamber was here and there was like the barrack like I say next to it so\nand they came. If the Polish transports were-- the Polish Jews knew more what's going on.\nThey knew they're going to death and also they were more religious and the women came in\n* Oberscharfiihrer Gustav Wagner\n* Oberscharfiihrer Hubert Gomerski\nand we were young boys, 20, 22, five, and we were standing there.\nThey came naked in, and we had to cut their hair. There was a horrible yelling and\nscreaming for all these, from knowing, from feeling they go to the gas chamber. On top of\nthat, they're ashamed to put it in. But with the Dutch transport, was quieter. They didn't know\nreally -- they didn't realize really that they're going to the camp, to death, so I have I\nhappened to cut somebody's hair and they started to talk to me. Say, \"How, how is it here\nand what...?\" They still didn't believe already, and the Germans around the small room but a\nlittle bigger than that. So they around so we couldn't, we couldn't talk to them so I didn't say\na word. I couldn't, because they didn't want us we talk to them. They were afraid we tell\nthem or things like that, so we couldn't say anything, but that was a horrible thing to see\nthese women with children and all ages and things like that. I mean know -- we knew where\nwould they go. So as I say hard to, to tell this picture. They cut randomly the hair, something\nlike they chopped up down here and send away those people, so to the lowest point these\npeople were brought down when they went to the.... It's, it's unbelievable how takes it to tell\nthat. Whoever didn't see it cannot describe it how that really looks or feeling it. We were\nalways were sick from it when we came back from that, but as I say that was random.\nSometimes they took us to this kind of work. And, we had other things. Like for example we\nhad one times we had, on a Sunday was that and they locked us up in the barracks. We were\nnot allowed to go out and a train arrived and there came some, some people came 1n this\ncamp. And there was full with guards and all the guards were in, all the Germans and\neverything, and they took them further down where they usually people arrive and they go\nand take their luggage and we heard a lot of shooting. So much shooting and shooting, we\ndidn't know what's going on. The next day they took us to work to separate the clothes, and\nwe're separating the clothes from these people what were shot.\nThey're full with blood -- terrible, and, and while we are separating the clothes we -- I found in a\npocket of one of these of one of these trousers -- I found a little note written in Yiddish and it\nsays, \"We come from Belzec,\" what was another camp like that and where the people that\ndid the kind of work that we do; and to liquidate the Belzec, they brought them to Sobibor.\nAnd the people knew where they go, so they put a resentment, so they shot them. They just\nshot them in the train, so all these people, and they say, and the note says, \"We are from\nthere, we know where we go. Take revenge for us.\" So that was -- we knew the people or so.\nSo our hopes for coming out was really no hopes whatever, no hopes whatever. We knew\nwhat the end is. It's just if the transport are finished, we are finished and we go and we will\nbe shot, all of us. I don't remember, there's so many de-- so many accidents -- incidents that\nhappened in camp what so horrible I really don't come to fresh in my mind to tell what it is,\nbut stories like that happened almost every other day. Almost every other day. It was if we\nlived through a day -- if we made it through the day, if you make it to the evening you know\nyou lived today. Otherwise you didn't know what tomorrow is, because tomorrow morning if\nhe didn't like what you looked like, you could be dead. Constantly like that. So we lived with\nthis. It is hard to say how you live a life like that. You just live with the minute. You don't\nmake plans. You don't think far. You don't -- you concentrate, you just concentrate on the\nminute, \"I want to make the, the first 10 minutes, the next minute, the next minute,\" and that\nis the way we really lived because, it's really impossible to explain what it means to live in a\nsituation like that. And nobody -- if somebody tries to say something about -- it's impossible\nto say. Even the one what lived it through couldn't explain really how that was, to live like\nthat. So -- but -- and there was a group what, was thinking of, of running away.",
        "Q: Let's hold it for a minute. Before we get to the uprising, we -- would you tell me, um, how\nyou met your wife?",
        "A: I guess by at work. By at work. Because we worked in with separating the clothes and in the\nevening we came back to barracks. The men and women lived in the same compartments, or\nbig -- the camp was circled round with barbed wire and woven with branches from the green\n-- evergreen trees, and -- but there was many barracks was in that. There was a section where\nthe women slept and we slept in another. The kitchen was there and the work places were\nthey set, so in the evening when we arrived they gave us to eat something and, and then we\nhave about nine o'clock or eight-thirty depending when it was dark, we had to go and sleep\nin our barracks, so the few hours between eating and sleeping so we could see each other,\nwalk around in this half of this, court, court round and we could talk with each other; and I,\nand I met Selma. She probably knows the details better than I do, but anyway we met and we\nstayed always together. So I think that also was really a -- that makes it also easier,\nsubconsciously, easier for us to endure 1n this camp because we had each other. We liked\neach other, and we could, communicate together and we were young, so I think it's a normal\nreaction to it.",
        "Q: How did you see -- keep seeing her, given the camp and the way it was set up?",
        "A: Yeah. Well, we tried to be as much as we can together. In other words when we went on\nAppell, we tried to be together and, when -- after work we were together. So we worked, we\nwent separating the clothes, if possible, we were together, so we were pretty often and pretty\n\u2014 very -- and very often together as far as the work didn't interfere with -- if the work wasn't\nthe same location, the same thing, we could be together with.",
        "Q: You had started before to tell us about some of the Nazis. Can you tell us about Wagner?\nCan you tell me the story about him?",
        "A: Yeah. well, Wagner, as I said, was really somebody the most we had to be careful with. He\nwas the most brutal one and a vicious one. He was really -- he looked for the occasion to\nmurder somebody, to do some something bad to him. He was, he was himself and he had the\noccasion to do things like that, so he very often he sneaked tn at night, you know, or in the\nevening when we are just walking around in this lot, in the place where we lived, just to, to,\nto sneak out, to suspicious, to see something. Maybe he's stalking to somebody. I know he\nwent in once to the barrack, one of -- there was a young fellow, he was a Kapo and he slept,\nand he went in, in his room, he start to wake him and he wasn't reacting quick enough so he\ntook him out with a -- he killed him. He killed him because he didn't react rightly on it. A\nmatter of fact, the uprising later maybe I will tell -- we geared it so -- they went every three\nmonths they went on vacation, so we all -- we planned it to have anything -- when we\nplanned the uprising we planned it so that he 1s not 1n that time there. He is on vacation in\nthat time. Now, while I'm talking about reminds me, the Germans went every, as I say, every\nthree months they went to vacation. Now when they do that, when they went there, they\nalways prepared them to go on vacation. What that mean 1s, they took all the best clothes\nwhat they could find, they -- some of the valuables what the people had with them -- that\nthey had the biggest suitcase and they filled up all these things. They filled it up till they\ncouldn't even carry it, it was so heavy. And each, each one of them took home these big\nsuitcases and with especially the Dutch people brought really nice things with them, and they\ntook all these things. They took them home for themselves, so that was really for them a big\nholiday. To go home, they took with them valuables what never more could -- they probably\nin their private life could never afford this kind of things, so, that was really what they did.\nSo, that that really was for them, that was the purpose of being there, so they could steal and\ntake the things. On top of that what they murdered, that they could steal and take the things\nwith them. Now Wagner, the end of Wagner was after the war, he ran away.\nHe ended up in Argentina and one of the survivors, Szmajzner\u2019, what he recently died -- he\nwas in Argentina, too; and when it was Hitler's birthday, they, all these Germans make a\ncoming together and he happens to be there and this Szmajzner, Szmajzner, he, he somehow\nfound out that he saw that -- he went looking for these people. He saw him there and he\nrecognized him, and he said, \"You are Wagner.\" He said, \"No, no, no.\" Anyway, it ended up\nthat they took him to jail, and while he was in jail he hanged himself. So that was the story\nwith Wagner. But while being in a camp, we were really -- if we were afraid to the most it\nwas for him. So really that was really a beast. He, he was so vicious. He was looking already\nthat he can murder somebody, kill somebody. I never saw a person like that. Some of them\nstill had sometimes, human feelings, you know. You could caught them, and catch them in a\nlighter moment, but this one was really just vicious. You couldn't afford even to look in his\nface. He didn't like you look at him and things like that, so there were -- before me were\nthere even also were others what I didn't -- Stangl\u00ae, I think, but I, I didn't -- I was not in the\ntime when Stang] was. I don't know anything. I only from I heard from the others telling --\nhe had a dog and he martyred people with the dog and things like that. Now I, I was not my\ntime. I came in, in \u2014 no \u2014 yeah, I came I think in September 1942. So I was 11 months I was\nin camp because the uprising was in October, so that was not my time. there was transport\n> Stanislaw Szmajzner\n\u00b0 SS-Hauptsturmfihrer Franz Stangl\ncame really -- sometimes they came -- I remember just talking about -- I remember there\ncame a transport. There was a big transport and there was a lot of people, half-dead, dead, no\nclothes.\nTerrible, I never saw something like that. It's just unbelievable -- half-skeletons. The people\nlooked just unbelievable. They must have had a big trip, no food, muddled up before that, so\nthey want to get it over as quick as possible, so we had these trolleys, like the wagons what\nyou have in the coal mines, what you swing back and forth, you might have seen them. So\nthey said all the bodies we had to throw on, on this to take it to the Camp Three. And there\nwere half-live people. We just had to throw them together with the, with the live people --\nwith the dead people together, so I see an old lady, a gentle face and things like that and it\nwas on top of all these bodies. She couldn't hardly talk, and they all went just like that. Put\nhalf-life on, whatever lived still, on the fire there. So things like that really -- I couldn't -- I, I\ncouldn't bring up everything. It was so many of them I couldn't really remember everyone of\nthem. It was horrible, horrible. I just don't have words for it. You cannot, you cannot, you\ncannot tell a story like that. You can tell a story, the words have not the same meaning to the\nlistener that 1t has to me, because I saw it and I see the picture before me. And it's different\ntelling a story -- no matter how good words you find for it, it still cannot give you the right\npicture what it 1s. So that is to say the most horrible thing imaginable, that what it was. If\nyou, you cannot imagine, but, but if you could have a horrible picture of the worst of a\npicture, the picture, even if I were to tell 1t, because so bad was it.",
        "Q: What kind of food and living conditions did you have?",
        "A: Well, as I said, we all got -- the food was -- you had in the -- we got -- well in the morning\nwe got our slice of bread, a heavy slice of bread, black bread and black water. It was not to\ndrink but that's all you get, and in the evenings we had a soup. As I said, we called it the\nstraw soup. It was from corn, I don't know exactly the name of it, it's with the peels, the corn\nwith the peels, so you couldn't really swallow that and we called that the \"spit soup.\" Now\nsome people couldn't eat it and they just didn't eat and die. They couldn't eat it. Especially\nthe Dutch people, what were used to a little bit better life, so they couldn't, and if you had to\nlive on that you couldn't make it long. You couldn't make it long, and they -- a lot of people\ndidn't. But we were the ones who were next to the food and we stole it. That's the reason we\nhad more people. It was illegal, dangerous. They would have shot you if they catch you, but\nwe nevertheless we did it, so the -- as far as food concerns, that was really the situation, but\nif you think about how they fed you -- forget about it. You couldn't make it at all. You\ncouldn't make it. And, clothes -- as I said, we came with different clothes and we just\nchanged. If, 1f it was ripped or whatever, we changed to another clothes. Just that what kind\nof thing, but they didn't supply you anything. They gave you -- they treated you like a\ncommodity, not like a, a human being, not at all. You were not a human being. You just had\nto listen the order what you got and to do it, just like the robot. You had to do things what\nyou are told and if you didn't do it right, they did away with you. No fooling around.\nAnd then was, a punishment for whatever reason, the whole evening instead after eating we\ncould go and be in the barracks. They didn't bring you to eat and they take you around,\nrunning around, put down -- as a punishment; they let you ran, ran, and ran, fell down and\nget up, fell down and get up for hour, two hours, till you got so exhausted and tired, some\npeople died on the place. They couldn't make it, and some, the younger ones, they, they did\nit, so there was a punishment. Things like that happen. As I say, they tried to martyr you.\nThey tried to take away any thinking of you, that you don't -- you're not on a human being,\nyou're not functioning as a human being. Just you have to be a robot and to kill you, any\nthinking, any initiative, anything -- just to do what you're told and to keep you as long as\nthey need you. So we really were not human beings in their thinking and their functioning\nand in regard to us, so they didn't come for that. So they exploit us as much as they could.",
        "Q: At this point I want to stop and pause and we're going to change tapes.\n[Technical Conversation]\nEnd of Tape 1\nTAPE #2",
        "Q: OK. We're on. Let's pick up now.",
        "A: Well, we were always knowing what's going on. We were talking about an uprising. In other\nwords, we talking about running away somehow, organized. There was a small group. I was\nnot involved in this group. And there was a lot of talking about how to run away. Now there\nwere many plans how to do it. It was not an easy task. There were always mines around,\nguards around, and there were about a 150, 200 Ukrainian guards in the camp on top of the\nGermans, so that was really a very difficult task to find somehow a way to get out. And -- till\none day came a transport of Jewish Russian prisoners of war from Minsk. That was about --\non -- not far from the Russian border where the Germans caught them, the prisoners of war,\nso they took out the Jewish prisoners of war and send them to Sobibor. From this group they\npicked out around 30 people to work in the camp and these people when they came in and\nthey heard what's going on. They're all soldiers so, and a different spirit, said they want to\nrun away the first day. So we tried to explain to them that it is not so easy. \u201cWhere do you\nrun? You don't have the cooperation from the people outside even if you make it already\noutside, and, it's not so easy.\u201d And we told them also that we have our own plans and we\nwanted to do the same thing. Maybe we can talk together and come up with a common\nthings, and we all can do the same thing together, what made sense, and they agreed on it.\nAnd after many secretive meetings in the evening, we, after work, we came together and we\ntalk with them and we talked on different plans, different possibilities, so -- till one day we\ncame upon a plan that we make an uprising on this way.\nWe worked till it was the time of October, what about five o'clock they brought us back\nalready to the living quarters because they want us always bring back before dark, so we\ndecided at four o'clock we start to make an uprising in this way. In each group what worked\nlike we, for example, with separating the clothes; we had two three Germans what were\nsupervision over us. They supervised us and each group what worked in different ways had\ntwo or three Germans what they were there to watch them, how they work. So we decided in\neach group to assign two people and these people with some pretext, they will have to get\nthem to a warehouse or somewhere and quietly kill them with a knife or an axe or whatever\nand just do it like nothing happened and in, in the meantime also to cut the, the wires and as I\nsaid, as I said before, we tried to gear to do it in the time when Wagner was on vacation; so\nthat was really not safe, but safer. And that was -- and so as I say, we was assigned people in\neach group to do this kind of work. Now there were in the barracks where we lived, there\nwas a goldsmith, a tailor, a shoemaker and that they made for them clothes, shoes, these\npeople there; so they made, they had to come to fit, so they told them, \"In this day I will have\nthe fit for you. Come then, and I will have the fit for you your shoes or your clothes.\"\nAnd when they came there they were already people with this axe of knives. They were\nhiding behind a, a curtain or something, and they killed them on the spot. When they came in\nto fit, they overwhelmed them and they killed them, and shoved them in under the, under\nsomewhere that nobody sees, and, and the work went through like nothing happened. And so\nI was not assigned to anything because, you see, I went with Selma and Selma didn't speak\nPolish and the whole plan was very secretive. Although it was planned for all of people in\nthe camp, because everybody could run away, but not many people were told were about --\nbe afraid it might come out, leak out and then we all gone, so whoever was, didn't speak the\nlanguage, didn't know somebody, so it was secretive. So I had my friends there and I knew\neverything that's going on; but I was not assigned to anything because of that, because I was\nwith, with Selma, because she didn't speak Polish. So where I worked there, there were some\npeople assigned to kill by the clothes where I worked, the separating the clothes. And then\nthere were two people what assigned to go to kill somebody in the office, a German in the\noffice, and the last minute one of them got scared and he didn't want to go. And I was there\nand I heard the story and I knew already that there's 10 to 12 Germans were already killed, so\nI know -- the ordeal I know already.\nWe are already -- unless we get out, otherwise we are dead. So, Selma brought me a knife\nwith a point, knife. I said I wanted to go. You see, from all these people what people brought\nfrom the transport, utensils and all the things, there were a warehouse for it, and we're not far\nfrom this warehouse, so she went there in and she picked a knife, a pointed knife. She gave\nme a knife, and I went with the other fellow. I don't think I was a big hero or a big,\ncourageous man, but I figured it's self-defense and survival. If I don't do it, it might spoil the\nwhole thing. So I, I instinctively -- is not decision. It's not a decision. You just react,\ninstinctively you react to that, and I figured, \"Let us to do, and go and do it.\" And I went. I\nwent with the man in the office, and we killed this German. With every jab, I said, \"That is\nfor my father, for my mother, for all these people, all the Jews you killed;\" and I -- my knife\nslipped out, slid out from my hand and I cut myself and I was full with blood and when he\nwas dead we ran out of the office and we were lucky. Just came a big truck came with\nGermans on it, but I somehow -- there was -- the, the idea was when at this comes five\no'clock that we all go back to from work to the living quarters like nothing happened, and\nthat was just in that time and Selma went with this group and she saw me and she took a, a\nnap-- napkin or whatever she had with them, she tied me up there, wiped off the blood from\nme and I went with this group till the main quarters where we where we came in and all the\ngroups in all the places came in, because it was five o'clock. Then we all start to run away.\nEverybody ran in different directions. I tell it so quick, but, it, 1t was more tension because it\nwas a whole hour was going on, so we were very tense. We knew there were already\nGermans killed. We knew already it's going on, so we just hoped that nobody unexpectedly\ncomes a place where he doesn't supposed to come and finds out what happened. If that 1s,\nthen we all killed and lost, so somehow we are lucky with that. We killed these Germans\nwherever we worked and everything went accordingly to the plan, till we came to the main\ngate. Now we could -- people ran, ran all over, so the whole camp knew already what's going\non by then, so some ran on the mines, got killed. Some people didn't ran at all. They gave up.\nThey didn't want to run. They just gave up. They, they just waited till they get killed. But the\nyounger people, most of them, and whoever was courageous enough to run, they ran away\nand then a lot ran on the main gate. Now we started to run and we were next to a barrack and\nthen I saw Frenzel with a machine gun, and he started to shoot and more people were\nrunning and I, I wanted to hold back because afraid for the machine gun, and I figured, \"Here\nis dead. Here is maybe something.\" So I pulled Selma's hand and we ran through and\nsomehow, some fell and we made it through the through the gate. So we were lucky we\ncame through. So that is really, I think some luck was with us. So we came through that and\nthen we ended up -- it started to be dark, and Sobibor was in the woods, so when we came\nout from the camp we ended up in the woods, and it was rainy and it was wet and she had\nsome boots on and somehow the boots didn't right, so she pulled it off and she couldn't get it\non, so she ran with one boot, half on the foot and on the, on the heel like that, you know, she\nran. We ran the whole night and we didn't know where we ran; and till it started to get light,\ndawn. And what I forgot to tell you is when we knew when we go away, we took money\nfrom the people. The money what we should have given to the Germans or sabotage, we\ntook with us some because we figured if we go out, we probably will need it if we have any\nchance to survive. So we took some with us, so when we came -- we figured -- the first night\nwe came next to a village and we saw a house and I figured, \"Let me go and ask if they can\nkeep us over the day,\" because they were searching there all over. So, and I told them I --\nwhatever the figure was -- I had dollars, gold, things like that, so I told them I would give\nthem so much money. He probably never heard so much money what I gave him, so he\nagreed to hold us over the day. They took us in. And it happened we were six miles from the\ncamp. And later we heard that in the same village they were searching the whole day. They\nfound a lot of people. I don't know if all of them -- they found of them and took them back to\ncamp and shot them.\nAnd it happened we were lucky, they didn't, didn't find us. So, and then we, we, we ran, we -\n- no -- when it got dark, we left this farmer and he told us a little direction. Now I was\nthinking because I didn't know where to go, what to go, so I was thinking I worked at the\nfarmer before I went to Sobibor, I figured, \"Let me try. Maybe, you never know, maybe -- he\nwas a nice person as I said, he was a nice person. Maybe he might do something.\" Now I\ndidn't know direction. We couldn't go on the roads. We went in the field always, because we\nare afraid they will catch us and not to be found, so we went in the woods. We didn't -- what\nwe looked is on the, on the Big Wagen\u2019, on Der Nipper\u2019, Nipper. I don't know I went the\nright direction. Anyway, that was our guide to where to go where to go, so we ended up at\n\u2019 wagon (German); \u201cDer Groke Wagen\u201d or \u201cThe Big Wagon\u201d is a colloquial German term for\nthe constellation Ursula Major.\n* the sipper (German)\nnight, we walked in dark, and during the day we tried to hide. Either, we tried to go into a\nfarmer in the morning, very early in the morning, give him money; or sometimes we were\nnot so lucky so we were hiding in sometimes in the woods during the day or on an open field\nor we went in a hoykh barg\u201d or something. And one day we couldn't find a farmer, we\ncouldn't find anybody, and we ended up on a top of a high barge\u2019, and it happened during the\nday some children came there to play and there was a sport to go on this and they found us,\nand they started right, \"Jews, Jews, Jews.\" I said, \"Selma, let's quick run away,\" and we ran\naway. They couldn't find anyone, so we ran away. I don't know, we got out and while we\nwere running there were two wagons haul-- wooden wagons with farmers. They didn't know\nthat I speak Polish, and he said, \"Come, we will take you. Come, we'll take you.\" And I was\non one wagon and Selma was on the other one, and I hear in Polish they say, \"Let them take\nit -- we will, we will do something for them,\" whatever -- not, not good, so I screamed to\nSelma, \"Jump! Jump!\" And I jumped and she jumped, and I let them go and we went away,\nSO We ran away.\nSo for about two weeks we ran, sometimes coming to a farmer, sometimes not, but every\ntime when we were at a farmer, we tried to tell them that we have some money. We want to\ngive them this money, and if he wants to keep us over the war. It was already in the end of\n'43 and, the Russians moved back and forth, so, so maybe they figured that maybe it\nwouldn't take so long and they might willing to do it, till one day we came to a farmer and\nwe asked him that. And he said, \"Listen. I am too near to my neighbors and I am not able to\ndo it for you, but I have a brother of mine what lives about 10 miles away or 10 kilometers\naway. Let me bring you there to him and maybe -- he lives a little isolated. He might be\nwilling to do it.\" And that what he did. So he put Selma, dressed up some as an old lady, and\nme he put on a wagon, the long wagons what they had, covered me with branches and he\ndrove on the road. Now I don't think he realized the danger of what he imposed on himself.\nIf they caught us, if the Germans on the road caught us, we all had been dead and all his\nfamily dead. Of course, really very dangerous. I assume he didn't realize what he is doing,\nbecause that was so dangerous and they were all over, the Germans. And especially they\nwere look-- we were not too far from the camp anyway, so they were looking for everything.\nSo anyway we were lucky. He brought us to his brother, and his brother said, \"Yes, I can\nkeep you.\" So there we end up -- we gave him what we had. Don't ask me what it was, was --\ngold pieces, diamonds, things like that, I don't know. Anyway, we gave him all these things\nand he decided to keep us, and he put us on top of the cows on the straw -- made a -- more\nstraw put on and, and then, a bucket for your toilet and once a day he brought us some food,\nand he kept us there for -- that was in October -- he kept us till June 1944. That was, when\nthe Russians came, till the Bug, till, till the Weichsel. The war was -- the Russian came\nalready in '44 till the Weichsel -- there was six months no fi-- no fighting in this side.",
        "Q: Excuse me. What was it like? You said he kept you. Describe where he kept you and how\n\u201d high mountain (Yiddish)\n'\u201d mountain(Yiddish)\nyou were given and all of that?",
        "A: Well, as I say, we were where the cows were downstairs it was full with flies on the top and\nwe could never get straight. Once in a while he took us down for -- to wash ourselves, and\nthe food -- we had once a day food. It was not enough but at least we could live. Selma had\nsca-- scab-- the right word, is it?",
        "Q: Scabies?",
        "A: Scabies. She had scabies, and we knew with -- we knew.... What is the material you use on\nmatches?",
        "Q: Sulfur.",
        "A: Sulfur. Sulfur. And with that you could get rid of it, so we didn't have any money more. I\nremember I had a gold-filled, a gold, pen, a fountain pen, and I gave him. I said, \"Why don't\nyou sell that and buy us this sulfur,\" so -- and then he had to drive to the city because in the\nvillage they had nothing. So I think that what he did once, but it was not enough. So we\nended up she had sulfur all the time. So, she -- we lived with that. I had it too, so we had it\nboth. We had to -- so I was not so, contagious to it. I didn't have it so bad, but she had it very\nbad. They, they treated us well. This how you want to think about: we were lucky and happy\nthat they kept us alive and they gave us whatever food they gave us; and also no matter what\ncondition, because we knew, we knew somehow a friend of ours what also was asking a\nfarmer to keep him, and he said, \"Keep me.\" And at night he came with the hay fork and\nkilled him and took all the money from him, so knowing all this kind of things, we were, we\nthought--\n[Beeping noise]",
        "Q: Excuse me. Can we stop the tape please?\n[Technical conversation |",
        "Q: Okay. We're back on tape.",
        "A: So, knowing that, that what can happen, so we really felt very lucky that we find people that\nthey kept us, no matter what conditions. So that's the way always we look at it, because they\nsaved our life. Now, when the Russian -- no. A few days before the Russian came, somehow\na family child came from-- eight years, 10 years or whatever years old--he came to this\nuncle. That was his uncle, and he came to, to the barn. Now a bird happens to fly up there\nwhere we were, and he climbed up and he saw us, and he was.... That was a secret for the\nfamily, because nobody knew what's going -- they had young children, one or two, so\nnobody knew and when they saw that so that was really dangerous. We had to do something.\nBut two days later the Russian came, so we came down. We came down and the Russians,\nsaw -- we saw the Russians. We all -- before we heard already the Germans leaving and the\nshooting of the big guns came nearer and nearer till the Ger-- Russian came, so then we were\nsafe. So when we came out from there, so he brought us to Chelm, what is about 10\nkilometers from where we were hidden. And then we found more Jews there and so, you\nknow, there was from all different places came different Jews were hidden or whatever, or\nwere with the partisans. Somehow, I don't know what happened exactly in that time but, after\na short time we moved away. We went away, whatever. And, and then we ended up in a\nsmall place in Parczew, the name of the place. Now, Selma was pregnant at that time and\nwhen we came out, she went, she had a child in Parczew, in a hospital, and then we move\nalready with the child. And in Parczew what I started to do to make a living is where the\nGermans left, was there to buy things to bring to the area where we lived, because there was\n-- where we lived was nothing, and where the Germans were there was more, so I tried to\nhitchhike and travel some and bring home different things. It tooks me one time a week or\ntwo weeks till I came to a certain place and I bought things and I brought it back and I sold\nit, so that's the way we make our living, right. When I sold the things, I went for a new trip.\nBut Selma was always alone, not speaking the language, with a child. So there was her\nfriend, what she mentioned before, her friend -- there was also a Dutch girl, this, Ula Stern,\nand she was a good friend for her before. So I decided that she come -- she came from the\npartisans and she had a hard time and she couldn't go by herself, so I said, \"Why don't she\ncome and live with us,\" so Selma has company and not alone for all the time I am away. And\nthat is the way we kept her for a time. She was with us, and I was traveling back and forth.\ntill one day they say they go to kill all the Jews at night in Parczew. The partisans go to kill\nall the Jews. So, I said to Selma, \"Now we go.\" We tooks, took some -- I had some freight, a\ntruck or something like that, somehow; somebody took us to Lublin. And we went to Lublin\nto some Jews what was other survivor from Sobibor, and he was one of the two what ran\naway in camp when they outside, what I told you, they had the two Ukrainian guards. They\nkilled one and they ran away. He was one of the two what survived, so he had there -- he was\nalready longer there. He was -- some business did, whatever, and he took in Jews and they\ntook us also in.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Podchlebnik'\u2019. Podchlebnik. He died in the meantime. He, he lived in Vineland not far\nfrom, Esther. He died a few years ago, some years ago. So anyway, and so we were with him\nfor a little time and I did the same thing. I bought whatever I could and sell that we could\nmake a living. till one day, one day we heard there was also in Lublin -- it was a bigger place\n-- there was also a lot of Dutch prisoners of war what were freed by the Germans, so there\nwas some more Dutch people in Lublin and somehow, either through the Red Cross or\n\u2018 Shlomo Podchlebnik\nwhatever, they organized into bring them back to Holland, bring them back from the Russian\n-- | don't know from where, but it went out. So they start to concentrate all these Dutch\npeople together. Now Selma was Dutch, but I was not Dutch and I didn't speak the language,\nso it was a little of problem, so I tried to talk as much -- as little as I talk I talked less, and so\nI didn't talk at all. I tried to be like I'm also Dutch but I don't talk too much and we happened\nto have -- Selma got acquainted -- there was a Dutch officer what he happened to be a nice\nman and she told him about me, so he tried to help us. He helped me that I don't have to\ncome and to tell things like that, so and I went through as a Dutch person. I went through as\na Dutch person, not much exposed you know. That was always my policy. Keep away as\nmuch as possible. In camp, too. If I could avoid seeing or talking to any of the Germans,\nthings like that, I was always on the side. I tried to be not around \u2018less I had no choice, so I\nfigured the less that I am exposed, the, the less chances I have to be hurt, so here the same\nthing. I kept like as much as I could I avoid everything. I just went, went with the masses.\nNow I'm not -- to don't know me. And that probably helped, and then they took us, because\nthe war was still going on, to the other side of the Weichsel. In other words from Poland\nWeichsel till that was still a front, so they brought us through Russia, through Odessa, the\nBlack Sea, if you can picture it, through Odessa, the Black Sea to the Mediterranean to\nMarseille, to France. But to come so far they took us -- we had to go with -- they brought us\nto Odessa with a freight train. there was -- the train was split in half, with -- they maked a\nceiling of, a division, so half that more people can go -- there was an up and down in the\nfreight trains, you know, a freight train. They make a division that people lived downstairs\nupstairs and slowly the train went. For three months we make it till Odessa. They must have\ngiven us some food because we got some food from them and, sometimes the train stopped\nso we could go, to facilities or washing something quick because we had the baby and so --\nbut, we made it till Odessa and then they kept us in Odessa till our boat was ready. They kept\nus there. What we got I think from the Red Cross, we got some packages. The Red Cross\nsupplied some packages and so that was in Odessa, and then came, one day came the boat.\nThe boat supposed us to take to Holland. Now there was really a strict control on that,\nbecause I came on the boat. And there was one girl, she said she 1s Dutch; they found out she\nis not Dutch, so the whole boat left and this one girl -- still seeing stand there -- she couldn't\ngo with. So we were on the boat and crossed my fingers that everything, already we go. And\non the sea the child -- probably Selma told the story -- the child got sick from food\npoisoning. They gave it -- this, this was the powdered milk or whatever, was too strong or\nwhatever, and then the stomach and there was no medication, nothing. So the child died on\nthe boat and it was in the sea during -- the Aegean Sea, next to Nexon-- Naxos Island, was\nthe child was buried there in the sea, and we arrived later in Odessa. And, in Odessa they\nkept us for a day or two till we arrived in Holland. Now the part of Holland, probably Selma\ntold more pri-- more about than I, so that's basically the way we ended up in Holland.",
        "Q: How long did you stay in Holland?",
        "A: Now, in Holland I stayed till -- we arrived in '45 and, we left '51. About six and a half year.",
        "Q: And you came to the United States then?",
        "A: No. No, no. We came -- Selma didn't like Holland and also it was for me hard. In Holland, if\nyou wanted to start a business, you have to have some special permit and you cannot just\nstart a business like here: you go out, you open four walls and put in merchandise, you have\na business. So it was a hard time for me. Now I had also from Selma's family was a permit\nlike that what I could get and I got and I got apartment and we started in the textile business,\nand we didn't begin -- we did very well, and later my partner just, cheated me out and I, we\nlost all the money and I had -- I couldn't start another business so I was decided to go away.\nSo Selma always wanted to go to Israel and I liked to go America; so to America was a\nPolish quota and it was very hard and -- but to Israel we could go easier, so I decided, \"Let's\ngo to Israel.\" So we sold everything we had and we -- in the meantime we bought, built a\nnew house and we had, a whole and everything and in the house, so we sold that everything,\nand we went to Israel in, like a kibbutz, Moshav Shittufi, what we lived on our own but we\nworked together. But I was not I think made for this kind of life. I, I, I couldn't -- from the\nfirst day on I said to Selma, \"How do we go back?\"\nI, I couldn't have it. I was in the age about 40\u2014 what was I? Forty-two? Forty-four? And I\nhad to go every so often to the military for, to the army for six weeks and I had enough with\nthe camp, with all the kind of things, and I didn't feel like that, so from the first day on my\nmind starts to work how to get away from it, how to go America. And, I worked -- I couldn't\nbe in this Moshav Shittufi. I couldn't live there. I was really mentally sick. I went -- I worked\nspecially two weeks together that I can have two days to go away for the weekend. We got a\nfree day, so I went to an uncle's of her in the Carmel for the two days to look for something\nelse, so when I came there and Selma told him that I am sick there, she couldn't believe it,\nbecause I came there. I was in another world. I didn't have this problem, so I really -- my\nmind went already to come out, at least from that, because that was a dead-end for me. I\nknew where I'll be buried. I knew, what tomorrow will lead me. You know, you live in\nMoshav Shittufi, is taking care of you, everything. They know what you eat today and what\nyou get tomorrow and where you'll be buried and if you are sick, instead. They know\neverything about you and I couldn't live this life. It was -- I had -- and all my private\ninitiative went and I just couldn't stand it. I couldn't stand it. So I ended up, I ended up -- we\nbrought with us a lot of things where we came from Holland. We brought with us Frigidaire,\nwhat was in that time was in very scarce in Israel, and 'frigerator, a washing machine and all\nthe things; so we had something we could sell what had a value. So I decided we'd go. We\nended up in a place where Dutch families lived there and the people said, \"Oh, why don't you\ncome here. You find a some job and you do something,\" and things like that, so I went out\nfor it and I looked and I found someplace in Netanya. I, I started to be -- I, I said, \"What can\nI do?\" I have no special trade and I don't money to start a business, so I ended up I wanted to\ngo as a waiter, I work as a waiter. I worked there for two months, the summer season or\nthings like that; and in the meantime we moved to Beth Yitzhak, next to these people and it\nhappened in the same Beth Yitzhak was there a woman what had a vegetable store. And, and\nthese Dutch people we met, he said, \"You know, you should buy this store,\" he said. \"It's\nreally a -- you, you will make money. If you don't have enough I will give you some money\nand you borrow some money and start this business,\" and what I did. And I took this -- I said\nfirst, \"How can you have, in a village where everybody grows everything, how can you sell\nvegetables?\" Anyway, it worked out good and I opened in two villages, two more business;\nwhat I went one or twice I went there, and we made a good living and made good money\nwith it, and, so I got a little money and I start to think how do I come to the United States\n\u2018cause I didn't want to stay there. So through different -- talking with people, things like that,\nI could find out that there's a way of doing it. I was very desperate. I wanted to do anything\njust to go, till I came one day and through the uncle I got an affidavit here in America and,\nand so I went it up and we went, we went in '57, we went, we came to the United States. we\nwent by boat. I don't know what the reason, had with me two children. and we were through\nthe way we stopped in Italy because the boat, that's the way the schedule went and then we\ncame here. Now, our plan was to go -- Selma had a brother in Canada, and we thought we\ncan go to Canada just being a little while with him, and then we start whatever starting and\nwe can go to the States. Well, we couldn't do that because if you have a permit to come here,\nyou have to come here first, so were in a dilemma. We didn't know what to do, so it happens\nin Westport, excuse me, in Westport was a family what came from the same place where we\nwere living, came to a sister of hers in Westport, and so we had written to them that, so they\nsaid, \"No problem. Come to us.\" So we came to these people. They live in a small house.\nOne, two children.\nTwo bedrooms and they said, \"Come, just live with us,\" so we went there for a week and we\nrented a house and he worked at Gristede's, as like a clerk at Gristede's, so he got me a job\nthere for taking orders on the phone. I didn't understand the language. I didn't know even\nwhat the material what they told me. Anyway I hold out there for five weeks, for five\nmonths, hold out. As I said, we had a little money with us, and, saved a little bit. With the\nlittle bit I made I saved and we bought something else and we started to do our own business.\nAnd we built it up and we ended up having another business and then, we ended up having a\njewelry store. That 1s, briefly told, my story. So--",
        "Q: Is there anything you would like to add?",
        "A: Well, we always say when I talk to the children in the high school, we always tell them that\nthey should be always alert when something happen. You shouldn't minimize if you see\nsomething like you see the Ku Klux Klan or the skin-heads or the others. You said, \"Ah,\"\nyou minimize it. They said, \"What is -- it's nothing. Forget about them.\" Don't minimize it,\nbecause Hitler also started very small. You never know how it can grew, whether I believed\nthat here is it not the same situation, that 1s too many minorities here to be able to have\nsomething like that, but it is not an impossibility, so I think we always can think about it is\npossible. Don't minimize it. If you see something, react to it. Don't say it is nothing. It is\nnothing in the moment, so that's the reason if you get a reminder or if you get to the B'nai\nBrith or everything, they warn you, they tell you. You think, \"Ah, they always come up with\nthe new story.\" It is very important because we cannot prevent it. Eventually it might happen\nagain. I hope not in our generation, not our children's generation. We were scapegoat all the\nyears, and we have to be very alert. We still, we still went through the whole story so we\nknow more about. Surely our children will know less about, so, so we still -- the survivors or\nthe people what generation what went through or were part of it, should really understand\nthat don't, you don't minimize things like that. They can grow. From a small seeds can grow\na big tree. I think that is what I wanted to add, unless you have questions.",

        "A: Chaim Engel. C- H- A-I-M.",
        "A: I born in January 1916 in -- I born in a small place really, Brudzew, B- R- U- D-Z-E-\nW, but when I was five years old my father moved to Lodz. I remember when he lived in this\nplace, they had a textile store -- they called him \"the millionaire.\" He probably made a living,\nthat's all. But wasn't, not -- one of the not many Jews there. He had a store, so automatically\nhe called a \"millionaire.\" And that's the reason my father left, was just afraid. It's the\nantisemitisms for Jews, so he left. He left, he went, moved to L\u00e9dz. It was when I was\naround five years old. And he started different thing. My father was really not a\nbusinessman. He was really a scholar. He studied for rabbi. He never practiced it, but a very\nTalmudistic -- he was really a -- let me call a scholar. That's probably the right word. But he\nhad to make a living, so he had this textile and then he came to L\u00e9dz to live and he started\ndifferent kind of business; and, we, we were not poor but we made it all the years, we made a\nliving, nice living. And my youth was, in a big city. I went to schools, to a Jewish school\nwhich also had, from the government, you had to go to school to make, regular school. How\ndo you call it? The...",
        "A: Public schools. So while you -- there were schools, Jewish schools, what they had it\nconnected together. That covered that, too. So you had both things in the same. And that's\nthe kind of school I went. And I finished, the middle school, called middle school, maybe till\naround 14 years or 15 years.\nAnd then I started to work. My uncle had, a factory, a textile \u2014 stockings, they made\nstockings there, also textile. And I worked with him there for a year and then I--",
        "A: Well, well, we always felt that we are Jews. We were sections in Lodz I wouldn't go as a\nJew, because you were a Jew. I don't know -- discrimination of, 1t was so much against Jews\nI assume I didn't really felt it so much because I lived more in the area of Jews and I maybe\ndidn't have so much contact with not-Jews, but the -- you always were aware that you are a\nJew. You didn't go in certain sections which was not Jewish. You felt that you are a Jew\nbecause the laws which were there or the surroundings what not-Jews, how they acted and\nreacted to your being a Jew. So that was really what was as far as I can remember as a as a as\na teenager.",
        "A: not really. Not really, not really. We were more -- Jews, my friends who are Jewish, mostly,\nand we not really lived in an area where were just Jews living. We were also in an area what\nlived other people, but your contact mostly you had with the Jewish, because you were\nresented very much from the not-Jewish. Very seldom that you had a not-Jewish friend. And\nmy time was that I worked, I worked till, when, we are 20, 20, you had to go to the army.\nWhen you are 20 you went to army for one and a half year. And that was in 1938. And, but\nmy mother died in 1936. She was sick, I don't know exactly what, I think bronchitis or\nwhatever. Anyway she died and I was about 20 and there come the time I had to go in the\narmy and my father remarried after a short time, married, and I resented this. So as it came I\nhad to go to the army and I served in the Polish army, for almost one and a half year. My\ntime expired. You -- after one and a half year would have been on September the 15th, 1939,\nand the war broke out on Ist, September the Ist, so I ended up being a soldier while the war\nbroke out, so I was in the war as a soldier, Polish army, against the Germans. Now talking\nabout the reaction of non-Jews to the Jews, when I was in the army I went in the war. I was\njust as afraid from my comrades and from my sergeant as much as, as I was from the\nGermans. I didn't trust them. They mentioned, \"You are a Jew,\" and things like that. So I was\nreally afraid in a time like that can happen anything with you. So, we fought till the 25th,\nseventh, whatever the two weeks, three weeks; and I ended up, I became a prisoner of war.\nAnd the first reaction I had on the front with that soldier, the German soldier what took me\nsaid, \"Are you a Jew?\"\nI just said, \"Yes.\" But he didn't react. He could shoot me or whatever. He didn't -- said, \"Go,\ngo, go.\" And they didn't do anything to me. So, but anyway they took us as prisoners of war.\nThey kept us for two days outside 1n the field and it was cold already and they sent us to\nGermany as, as prisoner of war. And as prisoner of war we worked; it was very bad. I got\nsick and they did hardly fed you. They didn't get hardly any food, and you know any -- may,\nmaybe I need some medication or whatever. I didn't get anything. And most of all was our\nwork. We went cleaning the streets in Leipzig. It was -- must have been near to Leipzig, I\nremember that. And there we cleaned the street and, and -- till the one day came that all the\nJewish prisoners of war from Pole had to be sent back to Pole. That was in March of 1940,\nand they sent us back to the place, to Pole, because they figured for the Jewish prisoners of\nwar still has some more privileges than a Jew in Poland and they wanted to get rid of the\nJews. That's the reason they send us back. And I came and I thought I go back to the place\nwhere my father lived. When I came there I found out that in '39 already, in December, they\nalready took all the Jews out. There was a big apartment house, so all the Jews took out and\nsent them away to Lublin. So I followed them. I didn't know exactly where, but somehow -- I\ndon't remember how I found him. I found him where he is, and I came there and he had a\nhard time because they took only with them whatever they had on their shoulder and they\nhad on them. They didn't, could take -- you couldn't take anything with them. So that was a\nhard time. Didn't have anything. So was very, a very hard time. So when I came back and I\nlooked down what's going on, so I figured -- I went, I went to a farmer and asked if I can be a\nhelp there, as farmer's help. And he agreed to it, and he kept me there as a farm's worker, and\nI just did farm work. Was a Ukraine family and, he paid me. They gave me food and shelter\nand I think he paid me by the year with so much bags of corn or whatever, what I could sell\nand that I could help my family with that. And I was there for one and a half year, and then\nmy brother what was nine years old, younger, was in the age that he could -- he was about 18\nor something -- so he could -- 17, 18, that he -- I found for him a job too.",
        "A: Now they were, they were nice people and they took me like a farm's help, and probably I\nwas cheaper than anybody else, but they were nice people. They were pretty good to me.\nThey were not really to mistreat me or something like that. And, I had to do all the work.\nThey were very nice people. I cannot, say they mistreated me; but my father lived in a place\nnot in the village where I work on the farm. It was a small place, not far from the farm, about\nfive miles away, things like that. So sometimes when I had a day off I could go back there\nand I walked. A matter of fact back then there was not any transportation there, and there\nwas very hard for the people, for the Jews. Very hard. Very restricted, curfew. They couldn't\ndo things much, but the mostly what they lived 1s they went to Lublin, brought some\nmerchandise and sold it and that's the way they could live, 'cause it was not that -- they\nprobably they didn't much trade and there was not any industry whatever. So they had really\na hard time and, and the Germans mistreated the Jews. If he saw one on the street and he\ndidn't like him, he could shoot him like that and they buried him 1n a place where he stood\nwhere he shot him. So we had places where you have to watch just not to go on these places\nbecause there's somebody buried there, so this really was a sad time. It was also very\ndangerous to go from my village to the place where I, where my father lived because if a\nGerman saw you on the road and he didn't like you for whatever reason, he shot you and no,\nwas no recourse. He couldn't tell anybody, nobody will listen. He was king, as far as a Jew\nconcerned. He didn't need any laws to ever, to adhere to it. He just, just did whatever he\nliked, he felt like. So that was really -- you got used to live with it. You took it already for\nnormal the way it is. You just watched out that you are not around what get shot or whatever,\nso we worked there and the restrictions for the Jews became every time more restrictions and\nmore restrictions till, one day the only things what Jews could do is working at a farm as a\nfarmer's help. So we were still safe for a little ttme because in meantime they sent all these\nJews, sent away to all these concentration camps.\nAnd in June of 1942 when they, they sent a transport of Jews away from the place, and my\nfather was in this group with the second wife, with my step-mother. They were in this\ntransport. Later when being tn, in Sobibor I found out that this transport went to Sobibor\nbecause I met people, younger ones, what went with this transport and they worked there, so\nthey knew about it. So, to come back to about my story, when I -- so I, as I say we still were\nable to work at the farmer, till one day all they came the restrictions Jews couldn't work at\nfarmers. Everybody has to concentrate in the next place, nearest place, bigger place -- all the\nJews around what work for the farmers, so in other words it was strict, no, no Jews anymore.\nSo we know what's going on, so we didn't go, so my brother and my friend were -- all three\nwe worked at the farmer's. So we decided not to go to this place. We thought, \"Let's go in the\nwoods. Maybe we'll find some, some partisans, or something like that.\" So we went in the\nwoods instead to go to the place, and we walked around in the woods. We didn't have any\nfood. It was cold and no shelter, nothing, so we had to come, find our way out of it because\nwe didn't find any partisans and you couldn't live that and the people, the Polish people,\nwouldn't help you. They didn't. First of all we were afraid to show our face and if we did\neven they were very reluctant have anything to do with you. You were afraid they might go\nto tell the Germans that you are there. So we heard somehow that in Izbica--was a city about\nmaybe 10, 15 miles away, 20 miles, whatever--that there are still some Jews in this place, so\nwe walked till we came there. We came there in the evening. And we came, there were still\nJews there and we talked with the other Jews what lived still there and surely everybody was\nhelpful to do. We told them where we come from and what -- sure -- they took us in. Every\nstranger, they took us in, in the house and there was full with Jews, you know, on the floor\nand everybody just took care of a shelter; and the same night the Germans came at night and\ndrove all the people out of the houses to collect them in the center of the city and to go to\nsend them away to the camps. Now we were still -- there was this old houses, you had this\nattics and things like that, so we tried to hide there in the building not to come out, but they\ndidn't do any effort to get you out because they figured eventually you will have to come out.\nNo food, no shelter, no facilities, you have to come out, and that is what happened. After\nthree nights hiding and not having food, whoever was hiding came out of this place and the\nothers went already what they collected, they went already sent them back to a camp and we\nwere the ones what were hiding, so they later they took us to the trains, to the freight trains;\nand, whatever people they collected, they pushed us in, in this freight trains, as many people\nas they could squeeze in and we were standing, no moving, nothing and the whole night we\ntraveled in this train. Now there was people fell down. People had to go to the bathroom and\nthere was, there was a mess -- you cannot imagine. But you had no, any choice, nothing. So\nthat after the morning -- in the morning we ended up arriving in Sobibor. That is the way we\narrived in Sobibor. So I was with my brother and myself and my friend; and we all meet the\nother rest of the people, about seven, 800 people and they took us out from the trains and\nthey put us 1n two lines and they start collecting -- picking out people. I didn't know what the\npicking out means, so one German asked me, \"Where are you from?\" I said, \"From L\u00e9dz.\"\n\"Out.\" And then they went further. \"What are you?\" \"A carpenter.\" \"Out.\" Things like that,\nso they picked about 18 to 20 people. Well, let me maybe say that we hear in Poland that that\nhappens with the Jews. They kill Jews and they gas Jews and things like that; but we really,\nas young people, we really didn't believe that something like that is possible. We thought,\n\u201cMaybe the younger people will take to work. Maybe only the older people....\u201d You just\ndidn't want to be -- wan-- wanted to believe, because it was so incomprehensible, so\nunbelievable that something like that can happen that you just -- even if you had the\nintelligence you didn't believe it, so when they picked us out in the camp, I really didn't\nknow what means the picking out means, whether life or death.\nSo they took us -- the 20 people -- they took us in one side and the others went to the camp,\nto the gas chambers -- what we found out later. So we worked in there. Went -- in the\nafternoon, in the afternoon, they took us with all the other people to separate the clothes.\nThat started to be our work and I started to separate my clothes -- that was the clothes from\npeople who just arrived with the transport what we came with, and while I did that I found\nthe clothes of my brother, the pictures from the family, so I knew already -- they already told\nme what's going on, so I knew already what happened, that he went to the gas chamber with\nmy friend and I am here separating his clothes. So you can imagine what went through my\nmind when that happened.",
        "A: Well, I really don't know. I, I -- everything stopped on me, like I stopped functioning. I just --\nalso I heard all the stories before that didn't penetrate in me, I didn't accepted it, but that\nmade it already accepting. That is the truth. That's what happened, because I saw what\nhappened. So it's hard to tell the feelings. It's -- it 1s just -- you stop thinking. You stop\nfunctioning. It is just like somebody hits you with a hammer in your head, something like\nthat, so -- but you had to do your work. You were not your own. You had to function just to\nfunction, to move, to go, to do things like that, so we finished our work and surely constantly\nin my mind what happened and, and, and that was really our work, what we do, day in, day\nout and, and then we went back and then after the work they always kept us around five\no'clock, before it gets dark, back to the barracks, where we, we slept. Selma told the work\nabout it was divided. It was a section where the Germans lived, and that was really fixed up\nnicely with gardens and things like that. And then was barracks where we lived, mostly\nwhere, we slept in other words. And there was a few places in the park or call it camp or\nwhatever -- there were also places where they had a shoemaker, a goldsmith, a tailor, a\nregular smith, things like that, but that was mostly not for the camp. That was mostly work\ndone for the Germans in the camp. What they need some work, they did it; like the goldsmith\nthat did for them good different things, made for them up rings. You see, the camp really was\n-- that was one of many camps, of about four or five camps what was really a death camp.\nIt was not a concentration camp. The distinction is the death camp, people came there, they\nwere directed to the gas chamber. They -- the small group what worked, like us, was just to\nkeep the things going; in other words separating the clothes, cleaning out.... Before we came,\nbefore I came, about a few months before, they start, it was different. When a transport\ncame, they picked out about 50, 60 people from this transport and when all the people were\nalready in, gone to the gas chamber, they cleaned up after them and then these people were\nshot in the gas chamber, often in the camp, Camp Three. later they found out it's more\nefficient for them to have the same people do always the same work, so they start to have\npermanent people doing the cleaning up, the separating all the kind of thing, and that what\nstarted to be a permanent group in this camp what worked there. And we were the ones what,\nwhat did this kind of work. So it was, as I have to explain maybe, the camp was so as I say\nwe lived apart where the Germans lived. We lived, the place where we worked and there was\nLager Three, or Camp Three, where the people went to the gas chambers and there, there\nwere in the beginning was as burying and later.... Is that the right word?",
        "A: Buried them. And later, they came they burned. They had a big roaster thing that they burned\nthe people. Now, also, we had hard times. Everyday, almost, they beat you, they, they\nmistreated you. They made you working, day and night and all the kind of thing, but you\nwere young and you could take it as much as you could take it. Whoever couldn't take it was\ntaken to the camp, to Camp Three and was shot and a lot of people couldn't make and they\nfell, just fell from the from the kind of work and the food you have and things like there was\na change of people. Very often a lot of people were changed because they just couldn't make\nit. They couldn't, physically they couldn't have it. Now the people what work in Lager Three\nwas often a change of it, because the people worked directly with the bodies and having to\nwork on that, it -- most people, mentally, they just couldn't have it; and they were changed.\nThey had to change the group. They killed, they killed them and they picked out another\ngroup of people and they took them, or they took some of ours or things like that. They took;\nand if you once came there, you never came out of it because that was the real end, the real\nend. Nobody could come out from that. So, in camp itself the food what they gave you really\nwas -- we called it a straw soup. That was something you couldn't even swallow. You had to\nspit out and in the morning, black water and a slice of bread for the 24 hours.\nNow if you had to live on that, you couldn't really live there; but because we work with this,\nclothes, separating the clothes and the people came -- they always brought with them -- you\nsaw -- they couldn't take much with them, the people what got sent on the transport. They\njust took them from the houses and say, \"Go,\" so they took with them -- usually what you\ntake, you take with you the valuables what you can in small things like diamonds, rings and\nthings like that. They figure, \"They'll let me take something. You never know what happen.\"\nAnd also some food. They took cans of food, things like that, so we were the ones what\nreally worked with that, so knowing that we don't have much to, to eat, so we took the risk to\nsteal this food and we brought it back and we ate it. Now if they caught you, you were shot\non the place. You had a piece, a can, or whatever, they shot you. They didn't even question,\nask you nothing. Just shot you. Now lot of times they did it, they caught somebody, they\ntook us out to show what happens if somebody steals, but we still kept doing it, regardless;\nand so we really had -- sometimes we had food to eat. So even the time when we didn't have\nthe food one evened out with the other, so we were not -- as far as that's concerned, not they\nfed us but we fed ourself. We took the food, we stole the food and so we had sometimes\nfrom the transport, we had the food.\nAnd also, as for clothes, what I mentioned -- people ask you, \u201cIn the camp you look not so\nbad dressed,\u201d and things like that. Now we work with these clothes, so if, if we had a ripped\njacket and we saw another one, we took another jacket and we didn't have special camp\nclothes. We had our regular clothes what we came in, so there as far as that, but there was\nalways the -- if you didn't look right or the German maybe had just a drink and he didn't like\nyour look, he took you out and shot you. There was nothing. He didn't have to give any\naccount to anybody what he is doing. He just did whatever he felt like. Now we had some\nwhat we had to be very careful, because they always were suspicious. And if they had any\nsuspicion, justified or not justified, you could be a target of it. What they did, sometimes they\ntook us out from the bed and they, they took us and shot people and things like that, you\ndidn't look right, you didn't walk right. And also when they took us out on Appell! and you\ndidn't stay right, he decided, gives you 25 whips -- they had whips -- 25 whips on the, on the\non, on, on your bare, bare bottom. So, I had it a few times. I got beaten, so, so I took when I\nwas on my work I saw some other pants, so I took two pair of pants. I figured if they beat me\nit wouldn't be so bad. So they found out that, so I got beaten and I had to take off both my\npants. And so you got beaten on 25 whips and if you, you had to count it. If you didn't --\nstopped counting in the middle, you had to start from the beginning and he gave you another\n25. So that was really one of the minor things. The main thing was we always were living\nwith that people seeing what we -- the transports that came and they went to these gas\nchambers -- men, women, children, and that was always a heart-breaking thing to see and,\nand that was really.... Ours is beating alright, the next day you were better, but that is not so\nimportant. But that what we saw what happens, and that what really always touched us. But,\nbut it is strange that even, even, if you were young and even if you see what happen and you\nknow it's no way out of here, even if you think, \"It's just a fantasy,\" that you think, \"T will\ncome out of here all right.\" It just -- you hope, your hope is justified hope -- not justified\nhope, but you think because your will for life is so -- you think, \"Ah, one day I will come out\nof it.\" There was really not any reason to believe it will happen, because it was, it was around\nwith barbed wires, mines around, in the woods, guards around, dogs around, and even if you\nget out you wouldn't know where to go even. So there was not really any, any real hope\nwhatever, not any spark of hope there that you would can come out ever. But still, you know,\n' roll call (German).\nas I say, you're young. You think -- a matter of fact sometimes being in a camp and you're\nnot fully alert, you were not -- you couldn't believe that what happened happens here because\nit was so far from reality really, thinking that -- how can you imagine -- they burn people --\nthey, they kill people, young people, children. You couldn't believe that. So if you're not\nreally fully aware you thought that is not true, you just dream. But really that was, was what\nhappened. So, in general to say that really what, what was the situation in camp. So there are\ndifferent, cases that happened that people -- it is in the movie, is it about -- there was a group\nwhat worked outside the camp, about 10 people, 15 people, whatever; and they went out\nwith two Ukrainians to work there. Now and there was in this group -- one day, they and\nwere in this, in this Ukraines, the guards -- and they killed one and, and they start to run\naway, So a few got away and the rest were caught and brought back to the camp. And when\nthat happened, they -- we had to go on Appell and they took us to show how they shot all\nthese people and we had to see it as a lesson when you ran away. That was one accident.\nThere was another one, a similar story happened something -- somebody ran away so this\ntime they took different. They took each 10th -- they put us on an Appell and every 10th of\nthe line they picked out; and every 10th, the group what they collected from that they took\nthem with them and they shot them together with the other ones. Now I happened to be\nnumber nine in a line where they picked the 10th of it, so luck was with me somehow I\nguess. So they, they shot this group; so things like that happened very, very often. I really\ncouldn't recall how many times -- probably Selma told about this -- 72 Dutch people, there\nwas a rumor that they want to ran away so they took the whole 72 to Camp Three and they\nshot them all.\nThings like that happened very often. Somebody -- I told you about the -- we were on this\ntrial in Germany and I testified that Frenzel\u2019, one of the Germans, he shot a dentist for no\nreason. We had to see how he put him down and turned around and shot him 1n his back, in\nthe neck here and he fell down, and I testified for that. Now that's one of the few cases that I\nremember things that they did, things like that.",
        "A: Well, the -- each German was really an, an individual by himself. Although they all had --\nthey came for one purpose, just to treat the Jews there, but each one had reacted to his\ncharacter. As I mentioned once, there was one what was there for some whatever reason, but\nhe was not the worst one.\nHe could give a Jew another piece of bread; but the other one like Frenzel, he looked for\ntrouble not for him, for the Jews. He didn't like somebody, he shot them. He would -- people\n* Oberscharfiihrer Karl Frenzel\nwould -- sometimes you couldn't go to work. They were in the barrack for a day. He didn't\nlike you are so long there for a day. He took them out and took them to Camp Three and they\nshot all of them, so each individual really was what he was by himself. It was not a\ncommand they had to do that. Like we had another one, Wagner, what was -- that was the\nworst one of all of them. The worst thing about him 1s he was very sharp and very\nsuspicious. If he has his eye and his intuition and his feeling for so he could smell out\nsomething there will be trouble tomorrow, so we were always careful. When he was around -\n- we had a name for him, \"VaYikru\". Now that means -- we called him \"VaYikru,\" because\nwe didn't want any name, popular name, that you don't recognize it, so we knew when we\nsaid -- when he came near to the camp we said \"VaYikru,\" so everybody knew to be alert\nand out of his way because it always happened with him something. He always took\nsomebody. He killed him or he beat him or whatever, so we always were very careful as far\nas that. So what I want to point out, the claim that these guards say they had to do the things,\nare definitely not true. First of all, a lot of time they asked for volunteers because they didn't\nwant to work they went there, but they were not commanded to particularly shoot this one or\ndo this one. Their function was to go there and to see that if work functions, that the people\ngo, come from the train, go to the gas chamber and do the things, but each individual showed\nhis character there and when he was one what he wanted to hurt personally something, he\ndid it there; and he didn't have to give any, any account of it, what he 1s doing.\nSo the Frenzel was really one of the bad ones. He, he really -- if he could kill people, he did.\nwe had one, for example, what worked in Lager Three and he used to be a boxer, Gomerski\u2019,\nand for him they made a special whip what was heavier and one day he came back from\nLager Three and we were on Appell and he came -- this Frenzel was with us -- and he was\nbragging to Frenzel -- we understood, we speak German -- so he says to him that he just\nkilled a Jew with 12 hits with his whip. So, so they chose that each character lived out his\ncharacter there. It was not that he had to do that; they did it, so the excuse that they had to\nthat is nonsense. So, there's -- well, also my work was separating clothes when transport\ncame at night. Sometimes they took people out any time, anybody to do different kind of\nworks. What they did, they cut the hair of the women. The women went to the gas chamber\nafter the men and then they stopped, about one or two barracks before the gas chamber was a\nbarrack where they left their luggage and they had to undress; and there was a barrack the\nnext to the gas chamber where they cut at randomly, they cut the hair of the women. They\nutilized it. They send it back to Germany; they did for brushes, for everything. So we were\nsometimes picked out at night to cut the hair, and it happens once I happened to be one of\nthis group. I had to go also to cut the hair. Now we were about 10 feet from the gas chamber.\nThere was -- the gas chamber was here and there was like the barrack like I say next to it so\nand they came. If the Polish transports were-- the Polish Jews knew more what's going on.\nThey knew they're going to death and also they were more religious and the women came in\n* Oberscharfiihrer Gustav Wagner\n* Oberscharfiihrer Hubert Gomerski\nand we were young boys, 20, 22, five, and we were standing there.\nThey came naked in, and we had to cut their hair. There was a horrible yelling and\nscreaming for all these, from knowing, from feeling they go to the gas chamber. On top of\nthat, they're ashamed to put it in. But with the Dutch transport, was quieter. They didn't know\nreally -- they didn't realize really that they're going to the camp, to death, so I have I\nhappened to cut somebody's hair and they started to talk to me. Say, \"How, how is it here\nand what...?\" They still didn't believe already, and the Germans around the small room but a\nlittle bigger than that. So they around so we couldn't, we couldn't talk to them so I didn't say\na word. I couldn't, because they didn't want us we talk to them. They were afraid we tell\nthem or things like that, so we couldn't say anything, but that was a horrible thing to see\nthese women with children and all ages and things like that. I mean know -- we knew where\nwould they go. So as I say hard to, to tell this picture. They cut randomly the hair, something\nlike they chopped up down here and send away those people, so to the lowest point these\npeople were brought down when they went to the.... It's, it's unbelievable how takes it to tell\nthat. Whoever didn't see it cannot describe it how that really looks or feeling it. We were\nalways were sick from it when we came back from that, but as I say that was random.\nSometimes they took us to this kind of work. And, we had other things. Like for example we\nhad one times we had, on a Sunday was that and they locked us up in the barracks. We were\nnot allowed to go out and a train arrived and there came some, some people came 1n this\ncamp. And there was full with guards and all the guards were in, all the Germans and\neverything, and they took them further down where they usually people arrive and they go\nand take their luggage and we heard a lot of shooting. So much shooting and shooting, we\ndidn't know what's going on. The next day they took us to work to separate the clothes, and\nwe're separating the clothes from these people what were shot.\nThey're full with blood -- terrible, and, and while we are separating the clothes we -- I found in a\npocket of one of these of one of these trousers -- I found a little note written in Yiddish and it\nsays, \"We come from Belzec,\" what was another camp like that and where the people that\ndid the kind of work that we do; and to liquidate the Belzec, they brought them to Sobibor.\nAnd the people knew where they go, so they put a resentment, so they shot them. They just\nshot them in the train, so all these people, and they say, and the note says, \"We are from\nthere, we know where we go. Take revenge for us.\" So that was -- we knew the people or so.\nSo our hopes for coming out was really no hopes whatever, no hopes whatever. We knew\nwhat the end is. It's just if the transport are finished, we are finished and we go and we will\nbe shot, all of us. I don't remember, there's so many de-- so many accidents -- incidents that\nhappened in camp what so horrible I really don't come to fresh in my mind to tell what it is,\nbut stories like that happened almost every other day. Almost every other day. It was if we\nlived through a day -- if we made it through the day, if you make it to the evening you know\nyou lived today. Otherwise you didn't know what tomorrow is, because tomorrow morning if\nhe didn't like what you looked like, you could be dead. Constantly like that. So we lived with\nthis. It is hard to say how you live a life like that. You just live with the minute. You don't\nmake plans. You don't think far. You don't -- you concentrate, you just concentrate on the\nminute, \"I want to make the, the first 10 minutes, the next minute, the next minute,\" and that\nis the way we really lived because, it's really impossible to explain what it means to live in a\nsituation like that. And nobody -- if somebody tries to say something about -- it's impossible\nto say. Even the one what lived it through couldn't explain really how that was, to live like\nthat. So -- but -- and there was a group what, was thinking of, of running away.",
        "A: I guess by at work. By at work. Because we worked in with separating the clothes and in the\nevening we came back to barracks. The men and women lived in the same compartments, or\nbig -- the camp was circled round with barbed wire and woven with branches from the green\n-- evergreen trees, and -- but there was many barracks was in that. There was a section where\nthe women slept and we slept in another. The kitchen was there and the work places were\nthey set, so in the evening when we arrived they gave us to eat something and, and then we\nhave about nine o'clock or eight-thirty depending when it was dark, we had to go and sleep\nin our barracks, so the few hours between eating and sleeping so we could see each other,\nwalk around in this half of this, court, court round and we could talk with each other; and I,\nand I met Selma. She probably knows the details better than I do, but anyway we met and we\nstayed always together. So I think that also was really a -- that makes it also easier,\nsubconsciously, easier for us to endure 1n this camp because we had each other. We liked\neach other, and we could, communicate together and we were young, so I think it's a normal\nreaction to it.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, we tried to be as much as we can together. In other words when we went on\nAppell, we tried to be together and, when -- after work we were together. So we worked, we\nwent separating the clothes, if possible, we were together, so we were pretty often and pretty\n\u2014 very -- and very often together as far as the work didn't interfere with -- if the work wasn't\nthe same location, the same thing, we could be together with.",
        "A: Yeah. well, Wagner, as I said, was really somebody the most we had to be careful with. He\nwas the most brutal one and a vicious one. He was really -- he looked for the occasion to\nmurder somebody, to do some something bad to him. He was, he was himself and he had the\noccasion to do things like that, so he very often he sneaked tn at night, you know, or in the\nevening when we are just walking around in this lot, in the place where we lived, just to, to,\nto sneak out, to suspicious, to see something. Maybe he's stalking to somebody. I know he\nwent in once to the barrack, one of -- there was a young fellow, he was a Kapo and he slept,\nand he went in, in his room, he start to wake him and he wasn't reacting quick enough so he\ntook him out with a -- he killed him. He killed him because he didn't react rightly on it. A\nmatter of fact, the uprising later maybe I will tell -- we geared it so -- they went every three\nmonths they went on vacation, so we all -- we planned it to have anything -- when we\nplanned the uprising we planned it so that he 1s not 1n that time there. He is on vacation in\nthat time. Now, while I'm talking about reminds me, the Germans went every, as I say, every\nthree months they went to vacation. Now when they do that, when they went there, they\nalways prepared them to go on vacation. What that mean 1s, they took all the best clothes\nwhat they could find, they -- some of the valuables what the people had with them -- that\nthey had the biggest suitcase and they filled up all these things. They filled it up till they\ncouldn't even carry it, it was so heavy. And each, each one of them took home these big\nsuitcases and with especially the Dutch people brought really nice things with them, and they\ntook all these things. They took them home for themselves, so that was really for them a big\nholiday. To go home, they took with them valuables what never more could -- they probably\nin their private life could never afford this kind of things, so, that was really what they did.\nSo, that that really was for them, that was the purpose of being there, so they could steal and\ntake the things. On top of that what they murdered, that they could steal and take the things\nwith them. Now Wagner, the end of Wagner was after the war, he ran away.\nHe ended up in Argentina and one of the survivors, Szmajzner\u2019, what he recently died -- he\nwas in Argentina, too; and when it was Hitler's birthday, they, all these Germans make a\ncoming together and he happens to be there and this Szmajzner, Szmajzner, he, he somehow\nfound out that he saw that -- he went looking for these people. He saw him there and he\nrecognized him, and he said, \"You are Wagner.\" He said, \"No, no, no.\" Anyway, it ended up\nthat they took him to jail, and while he was in jail he hanged himself. So that was the story\nwith Wagner. But while being in a camp, we were really -- if we were afraid to the most it\nwas for him. So really that was really a beast. He, he was so vicious. He was looking already\nthat he can murder somebody, kill somebody. I never saw a person like that. Some of them\nstill had sometimes, human feelings, you know. You could caught them, and catch them in a\nlighter moment, but this one was really just vicious. You couldn't afford even to look in his\nface. He didn't like you look at him and things like that, so there were -- before me were\nthere even also were others what I didn't -- Stangl\u00ae, I think, but I, I didn't -- I was not in the\ntime when Stang] was. I don't know anything. I only from I heard from the others telling --\nhe had a dog and he martyred people with the dog and things like that. Now I, I was not my\ntime. I came in, in \u2014 no \u2014 yeah, I came I think in September 1942. So I was 11 months I was\nin camp because the uprising was in October, so that was not my time. there was transport\n> Stanislaw Szmajzner\n\u00b0 SS-Hauptsturmfihrer Franz Stangl\ncame really -- sometimes they came -- I remember just talking about -- I remember there\ncame a transport. There was a big transport and there was a lot of people, half-dead, dead, no\nclothes.\nTerrible, I never saw something like that. It's just unbelievable -- half-skeletons. The people\nlooked just unbelievable. They must have had a big trip, no food, muddled up before that, so\nthey want to get it over as quick as possible, so we had these trolleys, like the wagons what\nyou have in the coal mines, what you swing back and forth, you might have seen them. So\nthey said all the bodies we had to throw on, on this to take it to the Camp Three. And there\nwere half-live people. We just had to throw them together with the, with the live people --\nwith the dead people together, so I see an old lady, a gentle face and things like that and it\nwas on top of all these bodies. She couldn't hardly talk, and they all went just like that. Put\nhalf-life on, whatever lived still, on the fire there. So things like that really -- I couldn't -- I, I\ncouldn't bring up everything. It was so many of them I couldn't really remember everyone of\nthem. It was horrible, horrible. I just don't have words for it. You cannot, you cannot, you\ncannot tell a story like that. You can tell a story, the words have not the same meaning to the\nlistener that 1t has to me, because I saw it and I see the picture before me. And it's different\ntelling a story -- no matter how good words you find for it, it still cannot give you the right\npicture what it 1s. So that is to say the most horrible thing imaginable, that what it was. If\nyou, you cannot imagine, but, but if you could have a horrible picture of the worst of a\npicture, the picture, even if I were to tell 1t, because so bad was it.",
        "A: Well, as I said, we all got -- the food was -- you had in the -- we got -- well in the morning\nwe got our slice of bread, a heavy slice of bread, black bread and black water. It was not to\ndrink but that's all you get, and in the evenings we had a soup. As I said, we called it the\nstraw soup. It was from corn, I don't know exactly the name of it, it's with the peels, the corn\nwith the peels, so you couldn't really swallow that and we called that the \"spit soup.\" Now\nsome people couldn't eat it and they just didn't eat and die. They couldn't eat it. Especially\nthe Dutch people, what were used to a little bit better life, so they couldn't, and if you had to\nlive on that you couldn't make it long. You couldn't make it long, and they -- a lot of people\ndidn't. But we were the ones who were next to the food and we stole it. That's the reason we\nhad more people. It was illegal, dangerous. They would have shot you if they catch you, but\nwe nevertheless we did it, so the -- as far as food concerns, that was really the situation, but\nif you think about how they fed you -- forget about it. You couldn't make it at all. You\ncouldn't make it. And, clothes -- as I said, we came with different clothes and we just\nchanged. If, 1f it was ripped or whatever, we changed to another clothes. Just that what kind\nof thing, but they didn't supply you anything. They gave you -- they treated you like a\ncommodity, not like a, a human being, not at all. You were not a human being. You just had\nto listen the order what you got and to do it, just like the robot. You had to do things what\nyou are told and if you didn't do it right, they did away with you. No fooling around.\nAnd then was, a punishment for whatever reason, the whole evening instead after eating we\ncould go and be in the barracks. They didn't bring you to eat and they take you around,\nrunning around, put down -- as a punishment; they let you ran, ran, and ran, fell down and\nget up, fell down and get up for hour, two hours, till you got so exhausted and tired, some\npeople died on the place. They couldn't make it, and some, the younger ones, they, they did\nit, so there was a punishment. Things like that happen. As I say, they tried to martyr you.\nThey tried to take away any thinking of you, that you don't -- you're not on a human being,\nyou're not functioning as a human being. Just you have to be a robot and to kill you, any\nthinking, any initiative, anything -- just to do what you're told and to keep you as long as\nthey need you. So we really were not human beings in their thinking and their functioning\nand in regard to us, so they didn't come for that. So they exploit us as much as they could.\n[Technical Conversation]\nEnd of Tape 1\nTAPE #2",
        "A: Well, we were always knowing what's going on. We were talking about an uprising. In other\nwords, we talking about running away somehow, organized. There was a small group. I was\nnot involved in this group. And there was a lot of talking about how to run away. Now there\nwere many plans how to do it. It was not an easy task. There were always mines around,\nguards around, and there were about a 150, 200 Ukrainian guards in the camp on top of the\nGermans, so that was really a very difficult task to find somehow a way to get out. And -- till\none day came a transport of Jewish Russian prisoners of war from Minsk. That was about --\non -- not far from the Russian border where the Germans caught them, the prisoners of war,\nso they took out the Jewish prisoners of war and send them to Sobibor. From this group they\npicked out around 30 people to work in the camp and these people when they came in and\nthey heard what's going on. They're all soldiers so, and a different spirit, said they want to\nrun away the first day. So we tried to explain to them that it is not so easy. \u201cWhere do you\nrun? You don't have the cooperation from the people outside even if you make it already\noutside, and, it's not so easy.\u201d And we told them also that we have our own plans and we\nwanted to do the same thing. Maybe we can talk together and come up with a common\nthings, and we all can do the same thing together, what made sense, and they agreed on it.\nAnd after many secretive meetings in the evening, we, after work, we came together and we\ntalk with them and we talked on different plans, different possibilities, so -- till one day we\ncame upon a plan that we make an uprising on this way.\nWe worked till it was the time of October, what about five o'clock they brought us back\nalready to the living quarters because they want us always bring back before dark, so we\ndecided at four o'clock we start to make an uprising in this way. In each group what worked\nlike we, for example, with separating the clothes; we had two three Germans what were\nsupervision over us. They supervised us and each group what worked in different ways had\ntwo or three Germans what they were there to watch them, how they work. So we decided in\neach group to assign two people and these people with some pretext, they will have to get\nthem to a warehouse or somewhere and quietly kill them with a knife or an axe or whatever\nand just do it like nothing happened and in, in the meantime also to cut the, the wires and as I\nsaid, as I said before, we tried to gear to do it in the time when Wagner was on vacation; so\nthat was really not safe, but safer. And that was -- and so as I say, we was assigned people in\neach group to do this kind of work. Now there were in the barracks where we lived, there\nwas a goldsmith, a tailor, a shoemaker and that they made for them clothes, shoes, these\npeople there; so they made, they had to come to fit, so they told them, \"In this day I will have\nthe fit for you. Come then, and I will have the fit for you your shoes or your clothes.\"\nAnd when they came there they were already people with this axe of knives. They were\nhiding behind a, a curtain or something, and they killed them on the spot. When they came in\nto fit, they overwhelmed them and they killed them, and shoved them in under the, under\nsomewhere that nobody sees, and, and the work went through like nothing happened. And so\nI was not assigned to anything because, you see, I went with Selma and Selma didn't speak\nPolish and the whole plan was very secretive. Although it was planned for all of people in\nthe camp, because everybody could run away, but not many people were told were about --\nbe afraid it might come out, leak out and then we all gone, so whoever was, didn't speak the\nlanguage, didn't know somebody, so it was secretive. So I had my friends there and I knew\neverything that's going on; but I was not assigned to anything because of that, because I was\nwith, with Selma, because she didn't speak Polish. So where I worked there, there were some\npeople assigned to kill by the clothes where I worked, the separating the clothes. And then\nthere were two people what assigned to go to kill somebody in the office, a German in the\noffice, and the last minute one of them got scared and he didn't want to go. And I was there\nand I heard the story and I knew already that there's 10 to 12 Germans were already killed, so\nI know -- the ordeal I know already.\nWe are already -- unless we get out, otherwise we are dead. So, Selma brought me a knife\nwith a point, knife. I said I wanted to go. You see, from all these people what people brought\nfrom the transport, utensils and all the things, there were a warehouse for it, and we're not far\nfrom this warehouse, so she went there in and she picked a knife, a pointed knife. She gave\nme a knife, and I went with the other fellow. I don't think I was a big hero or a big,\ncourageous man, but I figured it's self-defense and survival. If I don't do it, it might spoil the\nwhole thing. So I, I instinctively -- is not decision. It's not a decision. You just react,\ninstinctively you react to that, and I figured, \"Let us to do, and go and do it.\" And I went. I\nwent with the man in the office, and we killed this German. With every jab, I said, \"That is\nfor my father, for my mother, for all these people, all the Jews you killed;\" and I -- my knife\nslipped out, slid out from my hand and I cut myself and I was full with blood and when he\nwas dead we ran out of the office and we were lucky. Just came a big truck came with\nGermans on it, but I somehow -- there was -- the, the idea was when at this comes five\no'clock that we all go back to from work to the living quarters like nothing happened, and\nthat was just in that time and Selma went with this group and she saw me and she took a, a\nnap-- napkin or whatever she had with them, she tied me up there, wiped off the blood from\nme and I went with this group till the main quarters where we where we came in and all the\ngroups in all the places came in, because it was five o'clock. Then we all start to run away.\nEverybody ran in different directions. I tell it so quick, but, it, 1t was more tension because it\nwas a whole hour was going on, so we were very tense. We knew there were already\nGermans killed. We knew already it's going on, so we just hoped that nobody unexpectedly\ncomes a place where he doesn't supposed to come and finds out what happened. If that 1s,\nthen we all killed and lost, so somehow we are lucky with that. We killed these Germans\nwherever we worked and everything went accordingly to the plan, till we came to the main\ngate. Now we could -- people ran, ran all over, so the whole camp knew already what's going\non by then, so some ran on the mines, got killed. Some people didn't ran at all. They gave up.\nThey didn't want to run. They just gave up. They, they just waited till they get killed. But the\nyounger people, most of them, and whoever was courageous enough to run, they ran away\nand then a lot ran on the main gate. Now we started to run and we were next to a barrack and\nthen I saw Frenzel with a machine gun, and he started to shoot and more people were\nrunning and I, I wanted to hold back because afraid for the machine gun, and I figured, \"Here\nis dead. Here is maybe something.\" So I pulled Selma's hand and we ran through and\nsomehow, some fell and we made it through the through the gate. So we were lucky we\ncame through. So that is really, I think some luck was with us. So we came through that and\nthen we ended up -- it started to be dark, and Sobibor was in the woods, so when we came\nout from the camp we ended up in the woods, and it was rainy and it was wet and she had\nsome boots on and somehow the boots didn't right, so she pulled it off and she couldn't get it\non, so she ran with one boot, half on the foot and on the, on the heel like that, you know, she\nran. We ran the whole night and we didn't know where we ran; and till it started to get light,\ndawn. And what I forgot to tell you is when we knew when we go away, we took money\nfrom the people. The money what we should have given to the Germans or sabotage, we\ntook with us some because we figured if we go out, we probably will need it if we have any\nchance to survive. So we took some with us, so when we came -- we figured -- the first night\nwe came next to a village and we saw a house and I figured, \"Let me go and ask if they can\nkeep us over the day,\" because they were searching there all over. So, and I told them I --\nwhatever the figure was -- I had dollars, gold, things like that, so I told them I would give\nthem so much money. He probably never heard so much money what I gave him, so he\nagreed to hold us over the day. They took us in. And it happened we were six miles from the\ncamp. And later we heard that in the same village they were searching the whole day. They\nfound a lot of people. I don't know if all of them -- they found of them and took them back to\ncamp and shot them.\nAnd it happened we were lucky, they didn't, didn't find us. So, and then we, we, we ran, we -\n- no -- when it got dark, we left this farmer and he told us a little direction. Now I was\nthinking because I didn't know where to go, what to go, so I was thinking I worked at the\nfarmer before I went to Sobibor, I figured, \"Let me try. Maybe, you never know, maybe -- he\nwas a nice person as I said, he was a nice person. Maybe he might do something.\" Now I\ndidn't know direction. We couldn't go on the roads. We went in the field always, because we\nare afraid they will catch us and not to be found, so we went in the woods. We didn't -- what\nwe looked is on the, on the Big Wagen\u2019, on Der Nipper\u2019, Nipper. I don't know I went the\nright direction. Anyway, that was our guide to where to go where to go, so we ended up at\n\u2019 wagon (German); \u201cDer Groke Wagen\u201d or \u201cThe Big Wagon\u201d is a colloquial German term for\nthe constellation Ursula Major.\n* the sipper (German)\nnight, we walked in dark, and during the day we tried to hide. Either, we tried to go into a\nfarmer in the morning, very early in the morning, give him money; or sometimes we were\nnot so lucky so we were hiding in sometimes in the woods during the day or on an open field\nor we went in a hoykh barg\u201d or something. And one day we couldn't find a farmer, we\ncouldn't find anybody, and we ended up on a top of a high barge\u2019, and it happened during the\nday some children came there to play and there was a sport to go on this and they found us,\nand they started right, \"Jews, Jews, Jews.\" I said, \"Selma, let's quick run away,\" and we ran\naway. They couldn't find anyone, so we ran away. I don't know, we got out and while we\nwere running there were two wagons haul-- wooden wagons with farmers. They didn't know\nthat I speak Polish, and he said, \"Come, we will take you. Come, we'll take you.\" And I was\non one wagon and Selma was on the other one, and I hear in Polish they say, \"Let them take\nit -- we will, we will do something for them,\" whatever -- not, not good, so I screamed to\nSelma, \"Jump! Jump!\" And I jumped and she jumped, and I let them go and we went away,\nSO We ran away.\nSo for about two weeks we ran, sometimes coming to a farmer, sometimes not, but every\ntime when we were at a farmer, we tried to tell them that we have some money. We want to\ngive them this money, and if he wants to keep us over the war. It was already in the end of\n'43 and, the Russians moved back and forth, so, so maybe they figured that maybe it\nwouldn't take so long and they might willing to do it, till one day we came to a farmer and\nwe asked him that. And he said, \"Listen. I am too near to my neighbors and I am not able to\ndo it for you, but I have a brother of mine what lives about 10 miles away or 10 kilometers\naway. Let me bring you there to him and maybe -- he lives a little isolated. He might be\nwilling to do it.\" And that what he did. So he put Selma, dressed up some as an old lady, and\nme he put on a wagon, the long wagons what they had, covered me with branches and he\ndrove on the road. Now I don't think he realized the danger of what he imposed on himself.\nIf they caught us, if the Germans on the road caught us, we all had been dead and all his\nfamily dead. Of course, really very dangerous. I assume he didn't realize what he is doing,\nbecause that was so dangerous and they were all over, the Germans. And especially they\nwere look-- we were not too far from the camp anyway, so they were looking for everything.\nSo anyway we were lucky. He brought us to his brother, and his brother said, \"Yes, I can\nkeep you.\" So there we end up -- we gave him what we had. Don't ask me what it was, was --\ngold pieces, diamonds, things like that, I don't know. Anyway, we gave him all these things\nand he decided to keep us, and he put us on top of the cows on the straw -- made a -- more\nstraw put on and, and then, a bucket for your toilet and once a day he brought us some food,\nand he kept us there for -- that was in October -- he kept us till June 1944. That was, when\nthe Russians came, till the Bug, till, till the Weichsel. The war was -- the Russian came\nalready in '44 till the Weichsel -- there was six months no fi-- no fighting in this side.\n\u201d high mountain (Yiddish)\n'\u201d mountain(Yiddish)\nyou were given and all of that?",
        "A: Well, as I say, we were where the cows were downstairs it was full with flies on the top and\nwe could never get straight. Once in a while he took us down for -- to wash ourselves, and\nthe food -- we had once a day food. It was not enough but at least we could live. Selma had\nsca-- scab-- the right word, is it?",
        "A: Scabies. She had scabies, and we knew with -- we knew.... What is the material you use on\nmatches?",
        "A: Sulfur. Sulfur. And with that you could get rid of it, so we didn't have any money more. I\nremember I had a gold-filled, a gold, pen, a fountain pen, and I gave him. I said, \"Why don't\nyou sell that and buy us this sulfur,\" so -- and then he had to drive to the city because in the\nvillage they had nothing. So I think that what he did once, but it was not enough. So we\nended up she had sulfur all the time. So, she -- we lived with that. I had it too, so we had it\nboth. We had to -- so I was not so, contagious to it. I didn't have it so bad, but she had it very\nbad. They, they treated us well. This how you want to think about: we were lucky and happy\nthat they kept us alive and they gave us whatever food they gave us; and also no matter what\ncondition, because we knew, we knew somehow a friend of ours what also was asking a\nfarmer to keep him, and he said, \"Keep me.\" And at night he came with the hay fork and\nkilled him and took all the money from him, so knowing all this kind of things, we were, we\nthought--\n[Beeping noise]\n[Technical conversation |",
        "A: So, knowing that, that what can happen, so we really felt very lucky that we find people that\nthey kept us, no matter what conditions. So that's the way always we look at it, because they\nsaved our life. Now, when the Russian -- no. A few days before the Russian came, somehow\na family child came from-- eight years, 10 years or whatever years old--he came to this\nuncle. That was his uncle, and he came to, to the barn. Now a bird happens to fly up there\nwhere we were, and he climbed up and he saw us, and he was.... That was a secret for the\nfamily, because nobody knew what's going -- they had young children, one or two, so\nnobody knew and when they saw that so that was really dangerous. We had to do something.\nBut two days later the Russian came, so we came down. We came down and the Russians,\nsaw -- we saw the Russians. We all -- before we heard already the Germans leaving and the\nshooting of the big guns came nearer and nearer till the Ger-- Russian came, so then we were\nsafe. So when we came out from there, so he brought us to Chelm, what is about 10\nkilometers from where we were hidden. And then we found more Jews there and so, you\nknow, there was from all different places came different Jews were hidden or whatever, or\nwere with the partisans. Somehow, I don't know what happened exactly in that time but, after\na short time we moved away. We went away, whatever. And, and then we ended up in a\nsmall place in Parczew, the name of the place. Now, Selma was pregnant at that time and\nwhen we came out, she went, she had a child in Parczew, in a hospital, and then we move\nalready with the child. And in Parczew what I started to do to make a living is where the\nGermans left, was there to buy things to bring to the area where we lived, because there was\n-- where we lived was nothing, and where the Germans were there was more, so I tried to\nhitchhike and travel some and bring home different things. It tooks me one time a week or\ntwo weeks till I came to a certain place and I bought things and I brought it back and I sold\nit, so that's the way we make our living, right. When I sold the things, I went for a new trip.\nBut Selma was always alone, not speaking the language, with a child. So there was her\nfriend, what she mentioned before, her friend -- there was also a Dutch girl, this, Ula Stern,\nand she was a good friend for her before. So I decided that she come -- she came from the\npartisans and she had a hard time and she couldn't go by herself, so I said, \"Why don't she\ncome and live with us,\" so Selma has company and not alone for all the time I am away. And\nthat is the way we kept her for a time. She was with us, and I was traveling back and forth.\ntill one day they say they go to kill all the Jews at night in Parczew. The partisans go to kill\nall the Jews. So, I said to Selma, \"Now we go.\" We tooks, took some -- I had some freight, a\ntruck or something like that, somehow; somebody took us to Lublin. And we went to Lublin\nto some Jews what was other survivor from Sobibor, and he was one of the two what ran\naway in camp when they outside, what I told you, they had the two Ukrainian guards. They\nkilled one and they ran away. He was one of the two what survived, so he had there -- he was\nalready longer there. He was -- some business did, whatever, and he took in Jews and they\ntook us also in.",
        "A: Podchlebnik'\u2019. Podchlebnik. He died in the meantime. He, he lived in Vineland not far\nfrom, Esther. He died a few years ago, some years ago. So anyway, and so we were with him\nfor a little time and I did the same thing. I bought whatever I could and sell that we could\nmake a living. till one day, one day we heard there was also in Lublin -- it was a bigger place\n-- there was also a lot of Dutch prisoners of war what were freed by the Germans, so there\nwas some more Dutch people in Lublin and somehow, either through the Red Cross or\n\u2018 Shlomo Podchlebnik\nwhatever, they organized into bring them back to Holland, bring them back from the Russian\n-- | don't know from where, but it went out. So they start to concentrate all these Dutch\npeople together. Now Selma was Dutch, but I was not Dutch and I didn't speak the language,\nso it was a little of problem, so I tried to talk as much -- as little as I talk I talked less, and so\nI didn't talk at all. I tried to be like I'm also Dutch but I don't talk too much and we happened\nto have -- Selma got acquainted -- there was a Dutch officer what he happened to be a nice\nman and she told him about me, so he tried to help us. He helped me that I don't have to\ncome and to tell things like that, so and I went through as a Dutch person. I went through as\na Dutch person, not much exposed you know. That was always my policy. Keep away as\nmuch as possible. In camp, too. If I could avoid seeing or talking to any of the Germans,\nthings like that, I was always on the side. I tried to be not around \u2018less I had no choice, so I\nfigured the less that I am exposed, the, the less chances I have to be hurt, so here the same\nthing. I kept like as much as I could I avoid everything. I just went, went with the masses.\nNow I'm not -- to don't know me. And that probably helped, and then they took us, because\nthe war was still going on, to the other side of the Weichsel. In other words from Poland\nWeichsel till that was still a front, so they brought us through Russia, through Odessa, the\nBlack Sea, if you can picture it, through Odessa, the Black Sea to the Mediterranean to\nMarseille, to France. But to come so far they took us -- we had to go with -- they brought us\nto Odessa with a freight train. there was -- the train was split in half, with -- they maked a\nceiling of, a division, so half that more people can go -- there was an up and down in the\nfreight trains, you know, a freight train. They make a division that people lived downstairs\nupstairs and slowly the train went. For three months we make it till Odessa. They must have\ngiven us some food because we got some food from them and, sometimes the train stopped\nso we could go, to facilities or washing something quick because we had the baby and so --\nbut, we made it till Odessa and then they kept us in Odessa till our boat was ready. They kept\nus there. What we got I think from the Red Cross, we got some packages. The Red Cross\nsupplied some packages and so that was in Odessa, and then came, one day came the boat.\nThe boat supposed us to take to Holland. Now there was really a strict control on that,\nbecause I came on the boat. And there was one girl, she said she 1s Dutch; they found out she\nis not Dutch, so the whole boat left and this one girl -- still seeing stand there -- she couldn't\ngo with. So we were on the boat and crossed my fingers that everything, already we go. And\non the sea the child -- probably Selma told the story -- the child got sick from food\npoisoning. They gave it -- this, this was the powdered milk or whatever, was too strong or\nwhatever, and then the stomach and there was no medication, nothing. So the child died on\nthe boat and it was in the sea during -- the Aegean Sea, next to Nexon-- Naxos Island, was\nthe child was buried there in the sea, and we arrived later in Odessa. And, in Odessa they\nkept us for a day or two till we arrived in Holland. Now the part of Holland, probably Selma\ntold more pri-- more about than I, so that's basically the way we ended up in Holland.",
        "A: Now, in Holland I stayed till -- we arrived in '45 and, we left '51. About six and a half year.",
        "A: No. No, no. We came -- Selma didn't like Holland and also it was for me hard. In Holland, if\nyou wanted to start a business, you have to have some special permit and you cannot just\nstart a business like here: you go out, you open four walls and put in merchandise, you have\na business. So it was a hard time for me. Now I had also from Selma's family was a permit\nlike that what I could get and I got and I got apartment and we started in the textile business,\nand we didn't begin -- we did very well, and later my partner just, cheated me out and I, we\nlost all the money and I had -- I couldn't start another business so I was decided to go away.\nSo Selma always wanted to go to Israel and I liked to go America; so to America was a\nPolish quota and it was very hard and -- but to Israel we could go easier, so I decided, \"Let's\ngo to Israel.\" So we sold everything we had and we -- in the meantime we bought, built a\nnew house and we had, a whole and everything and in the house, so we sold that everything,\nand we went to Israel in, like a kibbutz, Moshav Shittufi, what we lived on our own but we\nworked together. But I was not I think made for this kind of life. I, I, I couldn't -- from the\nfirst day on I said to Selma, \"How do we go back?\"\nI, I couldn't have it. I was in the age about 40\u2014 what was I? Forty-two? Forty-four? And I\nhad to go every so often to the military for, to the army for six weeks and I had enough with\nthe camp, with all the kind of things, and I didn't feel like that, so from the first day on my\nmind starts to work how to get away from it, how to go America. And, I worked -- I couldn't\nbe in this Moshav Shittufi. I couldn't live there. I was really mentally sick. I went -- I worked\nspecially two weeks together that I can have two days to go away for the weekend. We got a\nfree day, so I went to an uncle's of her in the Carmel for the two days to look for something\nelse, so when I came there and Selma told him that I am sick there, she couldn't believe it,\nbecause I came there. I was in another world. I didn't have this problem, so I really -- my\nmind went already to come out, at least from that, because that was a dead-end for me. I\nknew where I'll be buried. I knew, what tomorrow will lead me. You know, you live in\nMoshav Shittufi, is taking care of you, everything. They know what you eat today and what\nyou get tomorrow and where you'll be buried and if you are sick, instead. They know\neverything about you and I couldn't live this life. It was -- I had -- and all my private\ninitiative went and I just couldn't stand it. I couldn't stand it. So I ended up, I ended up -- we\nbrought with us a lot of things where we came from Holland. We brought with us Frigidaire,\nwhat was in that time was in very scarce in Israel, and 'frigerator, a washing machine and all\nthe things; so we had something we could sell what had a value. So I decided we'd go. We\nended up in a place where Dutch families lived there and the people said, \"Oh, why don't you\ncome here. You find a some job and you do something,\" and things like that, so I went out\nfor it and I looked and I found someplace in Netanya. I, I started to be -- I, I said, \"What can\nI do?\" I have no special trade and I don't money to start a business, so I ended up I wanted to\ngo as a waiter, I work as a waiter. I worked there for two months, the summer season or\nthings like that; and in the meantime we moved to Beth Yitzhak, next to these people and it\nhappened in the same Beth Yitzhak was there a woman what had a vegetable store. And, and\nthese Dutch people we met, he said, \"You know, you should buy this store,\" he said. \"It's\nreally a -- you, you will make money. If you don't have enough I will give you some money\nand you borrow some money and start this business,\" and what I did. And I took this -- I said\nfirst, \"How can you have, in a village where everybody grows everything, how can you sell\nvegetables?\" Anyway, it worked out good and I opened in two villages, two more business;\nwhat I went one or twice I went there, and we made a good living and made good money\nwith it, and, so I got a little money and I start to think how do I come to the United States\n\u2018cause I didn't want to stay there. So through different -- talking with people, things like that,\nI could find out that there's a way of doing it. I was very desperate. I wanted to do anything\njust to go, till I came one day and through the uncle I got an affidavit here in America and,\nand so I went it up and we went, we went in '57, we went, we came to the United States. we\nwent by boat. I don't know what the reason, had with me two children. and we were through\nthe way we stopped in Italy because the boat, that's the way the schedule went and then we\ncame here. Now, our plan was to go -- Selma had a brother in Canada, and we thought we\ncan go to Canada just being a little while with him, and then we start whatever starting and\nwe can go to the States. Well, we couldn't do that because if you have a permit to come here,\nyou have to come here first, so were in a dilemma. We didn't know what to do, so it happens\nin Westport, excuse me, in Westport was a family what came from the same place where we\nwere living, came to a sister of hers in Westport, and so we had written to them that, so they\nsaid, \"No problem. Come to us.\" So we came to these people. They live in a small house.\nOne, two children.\nTwo bedrooms and they said, \"Come, just live with us,\" so we went there for a week and we\nrented a house and he worked at Gristede's, as like a clerk at Gristede's, so he got me a job\nthere for taking orders on the phone. I didn't understand the language. I didn't know even\nwhat the material what they told me. Anyway I hold out there for five weeks, for five\nmonths, hold out. As I said, we had a little money with us, and, saved a little bit. With the\nlittle bit I made I saved and we bought something else and we started to do our own business.\nAnd we built it up and we ended up having another business and then, we ended up having a\njewelry store. That 1s, briefly told, my story. So--",
        "A: Well, we always say when I talk to the children in the high school, we always tell them that\nthey should be always alert when something happen. You shouldn't minimize if you see\nsomething like you see the Ku Klux Klan or the skin-heads or the others. You said, \"Ah,\"\nyou minimize it. They said, \"What is -- it's nothing. Forget about them.\" Don't minimize it,\nbecause Hitler also started very small. You never know how it can grew, whether I believed\nthat here is it not the same situation, that 1s too many minorities here to be able to have\nsomething like that, but it is not an impossibility, so I think we always can think about it is\npossible. Don't minimize it. If you see something, react to it. Don't say it is nothing. It is\nnothing in the moment, so that's the reason if you get a reminder or if you get to the B'nai\nBrith or everything, they warn you, they tell you. You think, \"Ah, they always come up with\nthe new story.\" It is very important because we cannot prevent it. Eventually it might happen\nagain. I hope not in our generation, not our children's generation. We were scapegoat all the\nyears, and we have to be very alert. We still, we still went through the whole story so we\nknow more about. Surely our children will know less about, so, so we still -- the survivors or\nthe people what generation what went through or were part of it, should really understand\nthat don't, you don't minimize things like that. They can grow. From a small seeds can grow\na big tree. I think that is what I wanted to add, unless you have questions.",
